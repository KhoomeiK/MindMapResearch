A lot of folks spruik CBT but DBT can be more helpful depending on your background. Originally it was aimed at folks with borderline personality disorder, but it’s really helpful for depression and trauma backgrounds."
TooAfraidToAsk,ffepkn5,t1_ffcpke3,1579859052.0,"This is pretty good. Another simpler way to think about it is that it’s really hard to make sure you DON’T get pregnant because cycles are so unreliable.

EatCheapAndHealthy,ffbg0wc,t3_esioud,1579763662.0,Far out your food is super cheap in the US. That’s about a quarter of what it would cost in Australia.
CPTSD,ffbfq3q,t1_ffbetd2,1579763293.0,"Yes, that sounds familiar. I think it’s also the widening gap between rich and poor. Poor are too busy scrambling to survive, and struggle to share themselves around their community. 

I don’t know what the rich are doing, but they’re certainly not contributing to a healthy society. 

Too many people also see doing the bare minimum as adequate. Clothe you, feed you, that’s it. 

My doctor recently talked about how people get the same endorphin rush from offering to help people, as they do from ACTUALLY helping people, so why bother actually following through? It’s hard. 

Thanks for chatting. You sound like a good person."

Then the flat sheet goes on top of you but underneath your blankets to protect them and keep them cleaner for longer. 

Some people don’t bother with the flat sheet but I think that’s a bit gross."
