trees,ff72kyk,t1_ff70fy7,1579639855.0,Yeah but 200.1 grams is automatically a felony still. And any change to legislation would also most likely involve a reevaluation of cultivation and distribution policies. Many smaller communities in ohio also lack many of these decriminalization policies.
trees,ff72aqe,t1_ff6zmx7,1579639694.0,"So you think that's reason enough to not take 3 mins to write to the office? All letters to the office are passed over by someone. It definitely helps when the office starts receiving lots of letters regarding the same thing. It's how offices gather statistics on constituents to create their own ballot measures or weigh policy decisions. So if hundreds or better yet thousands of people start writing the office, it will indeed make a difference. Pecimism, however, achieves absolutely nothing, except maybe getting set back from the goal."

However even citizen initiated ballot measures need some support within the local governments to stand a chance. Having support within out own government will help any proposed Bills citizen initiated or otherwise.

We have the power to show that we are serious to which the many green activists groups in Ohio may start fighting again.  Any bit helps and can go a long way."

In the past it was better to keep a revolving balance on your cards to build credit, this is no longer the case, you want little to no balances on cards, but still, use them.  Things like auto or home loans will also build up your credit score faster than most credit cards will.  Keep your oldest credit accounts open for as long as possible.  Finally, just opening closing or moving a lot of money between accounts can also hurt your score.  My last words of advice are to use credit karma often and don't get discouraged by a dropped score, it may just bounce right back up in a month or two.  Credit is something you will ultimately need someday so it's always best to try and keep building a good report."

You can charge whatever you want to have someone live in your building, but you aren't gonna get many takers if you are priced too high.  Next comes the maintenance,  you have to be able to accurately gauge how much you will spend on maintenance each year(Appliances, landscaping, utilities, etc.).  Through some research of your region, you can find a rough estimate of this as well.  Finally, you should really include the time you are going to have to invest in dealing with tenants.  It's not a monetary thing, but the time investment is definitely something to consider(and is probably greater than you think).  You could hire a property manager to do most of this stuff for you, but at that point, one building will not be profitable.  Honestly, you will just have to do the research for your area, even if you do find a calculator, there is no way it will account for everything.  There is definitely money to be made renting a property, but you have to decide yourself whether the profits justify the extra work/ costs."

Two very separate issues.  Homelessness in many cases is chosen,  there are countless resources in my community for the homeless to get some nice clothes, temporary housing, and job interviews.  Not many of them do it because they don't want to give up their drugs and alcohol.  I'm all for helping the homeless, but giving them free shit is not how you do it.  In fact, it only harms them more as they are less likely to help themselves, which is all that is truly needed.  The homelessness in my area has gotten to the point where they go door to door asking for money or punching out car windows.  It's absolutely deplorable.  Do you really think housing homeless for free would be a good idea?  Because that happens sometimes, we then usually end up calling those houses ""crack dens"" and they tend to be great places to find some human corpses if you were looking.  I don't have an issue with those down on their luck with nowhere to sleep, I just believe, for good reason and from experience, that giving the homeless money or free stuff is not good for anyone."

personalfinance,fdl217a,t3_elts7l,1578515696.0,"Whether you purchase your lease or not is really up to you, and either way is not as big of a financial decision as most people make it out to be.  In most cases, it is technically not the best financial move to make. This is because in a lease you are basically paying for the depreciation of the car, not the car itself.  So it really depends on how good of a deal you got in the lease itself to determine whether you are in the red or black.  Sometimes you may have paid more to lease the car because it depreciated so fast.  To give you a clear cut and dry answer, we would have to know what the car is, your down payment, and the overall condition of the car.  It's a whole different story if you are over your miles or there is heavy damage to the car, in those cases, it may make much more financial sense to purchase the car at the end of the lease.  I have purchased a few leases in my time, as well as pre-owned and new cars.  It can definitely be a good decision, you know the exact history of the car, which is huge IMO.  If you happen to buy it and regret it, you can always sell it afterward, which in some cases can be very easy with a low mileage vehicle.  You may be able to swing some really good trade-in deals depending on time of year.  But be careful of some of those deals, because many dealerships will try to screw you with a trade.  My final word of advice is, if you do purchase the lease, you can certainly try and get a better deal from it, the buyout quote you got at the beginning of your lease IS negotiable some times. (Depends on the creditor)"

I use WMR and purchased Arizona sunshine thru the microsoft store. MAN was I burned on that idiotic choice, although it was on sale.... I'll still never purchase VR games anywhere but steam going forward."

There is not one person who hates exercising, they just hate certain types of it.  Exercise can be very fun once you find what you enjoy.  Hell, if you like video games invest in a VR headset, you'd be surprised how much activity it can make you do.  Also a healthy diet maybe even more important than the exercise, but both need to be done, there are no short cuts here so just take it one step at a time, any progress is great!  And finally, type 2 diabetes is actually reversible with strict dieting and exercise, it's not easy by any means but it can be done!  Don't ever give up hope and keep working towards your health, you will find that it is more than worth the effort.  Above all else is a positive attitude about the situation, yes it absolutely sucks, but I guarantee you, its not the end of the world, and you DO have control over it!"

virtualreality,fc2xq2b,t1_fc27h9f,1577376817.0,HA look at you suckers getting downvoted for no fucking reason what-so-ever.

CRF250L,fc2wlhk,t3_efwceu,1577375969.0,"Yes, you will most likely melt a blinker by removing the spark arrestor on the stock can, unless you shorten the can itself.  The spark arrestor on this can also serves as a tailpipe to direct the hot exhaust down below the blinkers.  IMHO modifying the stock exhaust to sound louder is not a good move.  You are destroying the stock can which you might want later down the line and is very valuable if you want to sell the bike.  Also, modified stock cans do not sound great.  Finally, you still have the biggest issue of the stock exhaust system, the weight.  I also agree with the other commenter, yes loud pipes do help people to know you around, but if you are really having that many issues with close calls, you may want to evaluate your own riding."
