When I lived in South Carolina, there were periods where I wasn’t in areas with sidewalks, and didn’t have access to parks. I was also in a food desert, and it didn’t help that I was around people who ate very unhealthy diets. 

In Sydney, I pretty much always have access to safe walking spaces, and there are a lot of parks...there’s an amazing one down the street. There are also a lot of active people here and so it’s easier to follow by their example. Now of course, there is a pretentious aspect to Sydney, and not all of its suburbs are created equally, and it’s not perfect.

These FAs insist on more representation for “inclusion”, but at the end of the day, the market speaks the way that it wants to. You’re probably not going to get much business as a fat trainer, as you are probably not going to get much business as a fat sex worker. People who are hiring trainers want them to look a certain way for a reason. I probably wouldn’t hire a fat trainer, because they’re not demonstrating fitness in most circumstances, unless I can see proven results with other clients. But, I’d also like a trainer who can keep up with me and be interactive with me during a workout, and that’s just not as likely if they’re fat."

So as you can see by my flair, I’ve lost a decent portion of my body weight. It’s summer where I live, and in case you didn’t know, my state is having a little problem with bushfires at the moment. I’m safe where I live, but we get a lot of smoke. Basically, I’m in an environment that isn’t conducive to clean, cool air at the moment. So, we tend to be sweaty and dirty often. Now, I still sweat like anyone else, but I’ve noticed that since I’ve lost weight...I don’t...smell anymore. Especially, em, downstairs. I’ll explain.

My body type is naturally pretty curvy. I have wide hips and thick thighs. When you’ve got thick thighs that are way too big, even for your overweight body, not only do they rub together and cause evil chafing, but the folds keep a lot of moisture in that area. And I would notice this smell creeping up when I was outside or if it were particularly hot. I’m very diligent about hygiene, and I would need to shower like 3 times a day just to keep it under control and feel ok. I knew that wasn’t normal.

But now? I just don’t reek anymore. And that’s in general. If it’s a particularly hot day, like the 42°C we had the other day, I can be like ok, time to have a wash, but it is absolutely nothing like what it was before.

What makes it even more profound is that FAs are always telling us to love our bodies if they’re fat, but this was something that was actively making me feel bad about myself and it had nothing to do with aesthetics. I was stinky because of my size. It was something I had direct control over if I lost weight. And now I do!"

fatlogic,fdi7269,t3_elcpmx,1578436884.0,"Alright, hopefully this doesn’t make me sound like a bitch...

But there have been so many people on the trains recently who are too big for their seats to the point where they’re spilling over into 3 seats or what have you. Or, they’re spilling over into mine and touching me. 

I get that it’s public transport, and when it’s super busy, that I won’t have the luxury of having a lot of room. I can suck it up and tolerate it. But I’m talking about an otherwise reasonably empty train, and still having my space unnecessarily violated. 

Case in point: I was on the train yesterday, and this large (figuratively and literally) family gets on board. All of them were overweight, and we were in the row of seats against the wall. They choose to sit on my side, which wasn’t the end of the world, except ALL of them were big enough to where they were crossing into the next persons seat. I ended up being the end sardine in essentially a seat can. So I get up to move because I’m not trying to have people unnecessarily touching me...and the (presumable) mom starts making comments about it. Keep in mind, I’m not rude about it. I don’t act over dramatically, I just pick up and move. 

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened either. 

If you’re so big that you’re taking up extra seats on public transport, there’s something wrong. The seats are fine, you’re just too big. And the fact that this whole family was like that just shows that this sort of thing is encouraged. I’ll never bully anyone though because I know people try and you don’t know what they’re dealing with, but I don’t deserve to be treated like that either."
