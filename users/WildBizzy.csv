Master Xehanort needed *massively* more screen time to do the overarching villain of a 17 year arc justice 

I enjoyed the boss gauntlet and the character moments, but I feel the Organisation character moments would have been more impactful if they weren't all like 3 minutes apart from each other

They kind of wrote themselves in to a corner making all the deaths *have* to happen at the Keyblade Graveyard to spawn the keys. 

Been said a thousand times but it should've had a midpoint. Lose but not everybody dies at the KB Graveyard, Xehanort primes Kingdom Hearts ready for the keys to be summoned, fight the org across the worlds to give them all of their own moment, go back to KB Graveyard to fight Young X/Ansem/Xemnas/Terranort/Master Xehanort. Have Master Xehanort show up to collect keys and mock Sora/give exposition when an org member dies, to give him the screen time he deserved

My headcanon on MX's old body is that he made a nobody when he extracted his heart to put in Terra, which was promptly destroyed in the explosion after the final battle.

And then we just handwave away why Xemnas's heart was never used for anything even though it should've been in either Terra or Xehanorts body, either it died with Master Xehanort or is still in Terra or Eraqus purged it"
