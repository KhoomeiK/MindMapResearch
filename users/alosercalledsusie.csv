UnresolvedMysteries,feg4q6g,t1_fdc84he,1579076828.0,"This case somewhat reminds me of the Somerton Man case and my own family's history. 

Due to the timing I reckon he could've been a refugee from WWII. My father's family were Polish refugees who arrived in Australia in 1949.

I think the Somerton Man was displaced and evenually took a refugee ship to Australia probably due to the prospect of a nicer life in a country that wasn't war-torn. He didn't have any friends or family so when he died in Australia anyone he once knew probably assumed he died during the war. I think if he had immigrated with people he knew, his disappearance wouldve been connected to the found body.

So for this man to be a WWII refugee, from any side, and to end up with no identity and in a country he wasn't from is not that shocking to me. There's a lot of people who were displaced during and after the war and unfortunately we may never know their stories of who they really are. I think to assume all people who turned up without an identity is a spy, is just wishful thinking."
