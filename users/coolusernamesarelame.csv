AskReddit,ffa7fha,t1_ff9w59z,1579729345.0,Hmmm
AskReddit,ff9kx7u,t1_ff9gsg1,1579715172.0,Why on earth would you sit through that? I mean wouldn’t you tell em to fuck off and let his boss know why he lost the sale?
trashy,feidu5w,t1_fee8sp0,1579136192.0,Pretty sure you’re a retard.
YouShouldKnow,fdr9y4s,t1_fdqyrbt,1578681558.0,"Ha ha ha!
I’ve had to field that one too. An employee w a crush sucks. I am nothing to look at in my humble opinion btw."
YouShouldKnow,fdqv1a5,t1_fdqj869,1578675225.0,"Don’t get me wrong, I care about my employees. I don’t give a fuck what they think of me though. Some are always going to like you, some are always going to hate you and there are those that move between like/hate.  There are times I have to do things they don’t like and I will not give a shit if they call me an asshole behind my back or the one man legion of doom. If I worried about what they thought about me I wouldn’t be able to make good decisions about the business. I do worry about how changes impact them and their lives and will fight for them, but if there is something they need to do that they don’t like it’s tough titties."
YouShouldKnow,fdqa57h,t1_fdplh92,1578660843.0,Ha! I came here to say bosses don’t give a fuck about whether you think they are a jerk.
