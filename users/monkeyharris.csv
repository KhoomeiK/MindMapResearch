The movie jumps around in time, showing them at various points in their lives. The actors are all in their 60s or 70s, so making them look 30 with makeup would be, dare I say, impossible.
 
They could have cast different actors for each time period, but the technology exists (they actually developed new technology for this film), so it became possible to have the same actors play different ages and the performances were consistent."

Other scenes when they were indoors it was great, and I think Pacino looked perfect, but there definitely were spots in the film where I noticed something off.
