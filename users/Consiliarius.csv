SiegeAcademy,fe52weh,t1_fdxribl,1578865179.0,"Showers, next to dorms, is *insanely* good for mute to play on this site:

One rotation hall into games, reinforce the other half of that wall. Jam behind the reinforcement.

Jammer in the last shower cubicle, next to the window.

Jammer for the top of the stairwell next to dorms (I forget the name) that lead down to nature.


Then it's back into the showers, and hunker down in the shower cubicle next to the showers window. It's a perfect position for the Mossberg - tight angle into the dorms doorway, or into the laundry door across the hall, or push into games from behind cover if need be.

 It punishes any team that try pushing through that whole end of of the objective and really needs a lot of utility to push you out (although it's generally a do or die position)."

todayilearned,fdqxzrt,t1_fdqwqmg,1578676480.0,"That's exactly what it is. I'm psychiatric care rather than medical healthcare, but I have a mental flowchart that basically starts like this:

**Is anyone at immediate risk of death/serious injury?**

No: fine, let's work this out calmly and with time. The situation is safe enough. We can maintain confidentiality, build rapport, give confidence that this can be dealt with.

Yes, there's immediate risk: confidentiality concerns are less essential, get help from other agencies if need be, step in, make this safe. No point flapping myself, because that makes this messier. Calm others down if need be. Think about 999, getting ambulance or police in. Etc etc."

SiegeAcademy,fdlduy4,t1_fdh02cw,1578521911.0,"If the other team aren't landing headshots, a 20% damage reduction on a team's 500hp of health is a whole extra operator of health that needs to be shot away - giving the defenders a real advantage.

(In the real world, ~40% of siege deaths are to headshots, meaning three out of five aren't - dropping the benefit to 20% of 300hp, only 60hp extra health shared across the team).

Of course, it's not the same as having a sixth operator with 60-100hp in your squad, but it's not nothing either."
SiegeAcademy,fdlcs4v,t3_elyfl8,1578521258.0,"They're generally better on defence, while you're roaming. If you fluff your shots, you can rotate and the attacker may not even have registered they were shot at, let alone know where from.

Very high RoF weapons are also worth it - because the impact of the damage reduction is lessened in terms of your time to kill.

High damage, slow automatic RoF weapons are riskier - you're dropping the advantage that the gun has, without the benefit of the rate of fire to make up for it.

High damage DMRs are a middle ground, where so long as you're engaging from long range (and thus, the silencer will be more likely to conceal your position if you miss), you can see some benefit. Don't be tempted to silence the TCSG-12 though, putting the suppressor on it will turn it from 2 to 3 shots required minimum.

Jäger, Lesion, Frost I tend to run it on most of the time. On attack, Twitch's F2, Ash's R4C, Mav's M4 are all worth trying it on."
SiegeAcademy,fdlbrzj,t1_fdl2z6n,1578520652.0,"I'm increasingly adding Gridlock to that list of solid solos. Assuming you've someone anti-gadget and a hard beach, grabbing the defuser and playing her to ensure that:

1. Defuser doesn't get lost a floor/three km away from the site
2. There are smokes for a plant
3. There is a way to slow/stall late flanks by Roamers

Super powerful."

AskReddit,fdf0us3,t3_ekx7gi,1578350772.0,"You say:

""It's because I'm driving without a license isn't it?"", then you tell him that you can't get out the car because you're drunk. When he goes to open the car door, inform him you've an illegal firearm in your glovebox and just before he opens the glovebox, tell him there's a dead hooker in spare wheel well in the boot.


He'll call for backup at this point.

When they arrive they'll check the trunk, and find it empty. They'll also not find a gun in the glovebox, your breathalyser will return negative and you can show them your valid license.

At that point, you say to the backup guys: ""Bet he told you I was speeding, too""."
worldnews,fdeshz0,t1_fdeq8z8,1578345682.0,"In the UK, saying ""To hell with him"" or ""Devil take him"" is an old-fashioned insult that would mean similar; an expression of resentment or frustration or anger in which the words are that you're saying you want the insultee to be dead, but not with any implied intent or harm necessarily being wished directly.

Would this be analogous?"
