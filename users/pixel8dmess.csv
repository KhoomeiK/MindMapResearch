pettyrevenge,fetl71f,t1_fes855x,1579376483.0,"Same. I mean in that ppl presume that they can call me a shortened version of my name. Not that I mind using a shortened version but just not that version. Also just call me by the name I've just said is my name. It isn't hard!

I've had this happen with people at work who have called in wanting me to order from them....instant no and off the supplier list!"
relationships,fer4xbv,t3_eq81ow,1579349870.0,"First of all. I'm sorry for your loss. I hope you can surround yourself with good people. People that don't need to be told to be kind and caring and be a shoulder to cry on. Please be gentle with yourself and allow yourself to grieve...


Next.

This. Is. Unacceptable.

Think he needs to be taught a lesson. That shit doesn't fly. He isn't a boy anymore. You kinda know when stuff is serious and your gf needs you and that maybe going to play with your friends can wait for another day. 

The lack of empathy is astounding and worrying.
Doesn't bode well for the future."
pettyrevenge,fer3ony,t3_eqbpy1,1579349431.0,"One of the most important things to do. When you are introduced to somebody, you call them by that name. It is a common courtesy. Not even trying is just plain disrespectful.

Likewise if they say their name, you don't presume and start shortening it.

Nice one for getting him on board finally."
cats,fd6ckx7,t3_ejrwse,1578188907.0,My condolences on the loss of sweet Cheese. She looked like a wonderful cat. I'm sure she lived her best life with you be her side. Try to remember the good times and take comfort that she isn't suffering now.
galaxys10,fcux51y,t1_fctqqq1,1577990300.0,"Wow! Well where do I start with my reply?! First of thank you to you for your detailed reply. Really appreciate it.

Ah ok Prime photos. So many options for cloud backup. Forgot about this option. So you say they stay in your camera folder until mega backup time. Does this mean they stay on your phone unorganised and when you backup, that is when you actually create folders and file away leaving only what you're not too bothered about?

Making folders for trips, holidays, events, cats etc is exactly how I was picturing it. And then maybe a Misc or an ""everything else"". I like it. It sounds so trivial I know but because it has been so long since I actually organised photos on my phone, well my current one, I wonder what the best way of doing it is. Or finding out other people's workflows!

I can see what you mean about not wanting to be very thorough all the time and starting with the easy stuff. I guess once you've started,like anything, it is a lot easier to keep organised. Yeah I am with you, I was thinking exactly the same easy ones including the cats. Haha did I too mention the cats? ;) 

Ok so I think the ones that are left in the camera folder would be those random ones as you say that either aren't important or only stay in there temporarily either to be filed later, or moved to the home of  everything else or deleted.

You make an interesting point about keeping everything on the internal storage until backed up. I guess it is slightly less likely to fail than the sd card. 
Wow. Lucky that you had fb in this instance. I can imagine the sickening feeling of potentially losing all those photos form Hawaii. Must have been an awesome trip. I'd love to go there maybe even diving there too...I imagine you're a little closer located then I am (across the pond). Anyway glad you still have the photos. 

I shall definitely listen to your advice and be mindful of not moving to sd until backed up. In more than one location at that because backups can fail! I've had more than my fair share of helping colleagues try and save photos/files from dying ssds etc.

Once again really appreciated your detailed response. Thank you."
galaxys10,fcuu02q,t1_fctw69r,1577988464.0,Hmm interesting. Yeah I know Google photos is pretty good in terms of AI..I was trying not to reply on Google too much but I guess it is the easy option. Cheers for the reply.
galaxys10,fcutu9r,t1_fcsxoeo,1577988368.0,"Thanks for the reply. Yeah think I'm going to move them from the camera folder too.
Juat deciding whether to save on internal storage or sd card. I mean either way I'll back them up to Dropbox or Onedrive."
cats,fcsw5sv,t3_eil0c1,1577926638.0,Sending good vibes for you and your cat. Hopefully the lesser of the two options.
androidapps,fc8plem,t1_fc723pf,1577539661.0,Quite a few there. I hadn't heard of Shapikal X and Lens Distortion. I'll be sure to check them out.
androidapps,fc8pbfn,t1_fc7hnew,1577539523.0,Thanks. Never heard of that one.
androidapps,fc70e28,t3_eg0df4,1577494186.0,Pocket Casts for podcasts! I mean you didnt mention that you listen to podcasts but it would definitely always be included in my setup.
androidapps,fc6zrjm,t3_efykuo,1577493716.0,"I know it has already been mentioned but the opportunity to save on tickets by split ticketing would be awesome.

The other things I liked when using the SBB app (swiss rail) is they show how busy the trains usually are at those times before you book and live updates during the journey so you know where you are and when you expect to arrive. This is especially helpful when your train has been delayed as so often is the case here in the UK (not so much in Switzerland where trains run like clockwork)!

They also show the length of the train and where first and second class carriages are located as well as the quiet coaches. Finally if there is a platform change, be awesome to show the new platform."

cats,fc5dslw,t3_eg9eht,1577454551.0,"Happy birthday beautiful. You deserve the best life. 
As daft as it sounds, what has happened to your cat has led it to you.
Have two cats that were left in a compacting bin. They were covered in a black sticky substance and smelt of smoke. They were litter trained so somebody had ""caded"" for them. Apparently more from the litter were found. Anyway I like to think that they don't even remember what happened before and are now living their best life!"
AskReddit,fc416y1,t3_efbygd,1577403929.0,"The questions you get asked on a US landing card. My particular favourite:

Have you ever been or are you now involved in espionage or sabotage; or in terrorist activities; or genocide; or between 1933 and 1945 were you involved, in any way, in persecutions associated with Nazi Germany or its allies?Â YES/NO"
cats,fc1opfj,t3_efmr5y,1577324929.0,"We purposely got brother and sister so they'd always have each other for company.
They kept warm by cuddling up as kittens, now they don't sleep next to each other but are happiest when we're all in the same room in our favourite seats.
Definitely nice to keep them as a pair. Enjoy!"
onebag,fc0gb0x,t3_ef440q,1577290184.0,"Nice one! I got to the coal and the penny dropped!

Where abouts are you on your travels now?
Sadly I don't have a recommendation that fits your list...you never know what Mrs Kringle has left under the tree though.

Merry Christmas and enjoy a well earned break when you get back!

Ps. Thank you for the gifts you left us here! You're doing a stellar job!"
CasualUK,fc0d9er,t1_fc02sf0,1577287561.0,Second that! Who even does that?
CasualUK,fc0cykh,t3_efe7yc,1577287293.0,"What a legend and lovely human being you are. If I had Reddit coins, you'd be the recipient of an award from me.

Loneliness is horrible at the best of times but at Christmas, I can only imagine....

I think it is even more important for us to get in touch with people. Check in with elderly neighbours, message a friend you've not spoken to for a while. A simple message reminding them that they are in your thoughts.  We can all be involved in Project Care. Via the means of Reddit like OP, calling a friend, sending a surprise through the post, smiling at a stranger on the street....I know a smile isn't a fix for loneliness but you should never underestimate the power of a smile. Remember being nice isn't just for Christmas!

If anybody wants to send a message for a chat, please get in touch. 

Merry Christmas to one and all. Be good to each other."
