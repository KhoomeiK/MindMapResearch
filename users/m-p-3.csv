playrust,ffdd7wi,t1_ffcagw1,1579818417.0,"I went on some practice servers and I don't really crash unless I do something stupid.

Here are the basics

* W increases your altitude
* S lowers your altitude
* A turn the heli left (the nose will turn)
* D turns the heli right (the nose will turn)
* Mouse-Up tilts the heli forwards, which allows you to go forward and have the effect of decreasing your altitude the faster you go
* Mouse-Down tilts the heli backwards, which slows you down
* Mouse-Left tilts the heli to the left, like strafing
* Mouse-Right tilts the heli to the right, again like strafing

Tip #1: For mouse-left and mouse right, imagine a pole going perpendicular through the rotor, like from the top to the bottom of the heli. When you tilt, it change the axis of that pole.

Tip #2:  The heli can only reach a maximum altitude relative to what is under you. If you're going down a hill, the heli will lose some altitude to match the terrain.

Tip #3: Be gentle with the mouse and avoid doing large motions.

Tip #4: if you somewhat lose control, try to bring the bottom of the heli parallel to the ground as much as you can without overcompensating. Try to land and keep it steady when you take off again.

Tip #5: Don't hold S when landing, you'll crash hard. Tap it gently until you reach the ground."
