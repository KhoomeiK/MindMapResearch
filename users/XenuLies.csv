I believe this is an example of the latter, demonstrating words and word phrases that happen to be currently prevalent rather than suggesting which words *should* be prevalent."
creepygaming,ff6k7kb,t3_ern8nw,1579628962.0,"The original Tomb Raider game for PS1. 

First you're fighting wolves and dodging basic hazards, but then the enemies upgrade to dinosaurs and the traps get more treacherous, before you're up against grotesque crazed mummies, demonic centaurs and meat-gargoyles inside a firey bloody hellscape that resembles some Silent Hill nightmare more than the mythical Atlantis it's supposed to be."

oddlyterrifying,fdgso4d,t1_fdg7k75,1578407311.0,"Acceleration is sometimes measured in G-forces (G for short), the equivalent of Earth's gravitational forces acting upon something; rapid changes in acceleration can simulate the effects of extreme gravity.

The woman appears to be piloting a jet or similar, the effects of which were like she weighed 7 times heavier for that moment. Face muscles not being able to hold up the suddenly heavier face appears the same as if the muscles drooped from old age. Another factor is that blood circulating the body often rushes to their feet, causing some to lose consciousness, pilots are trained to clench heavily to prevent them from blacking out.

The most extreme roller coasters reach about 5G's on their steepest drops, any more and riders would pass out.

Fun fact: the characters in the Star Fox series canonically have prosthetic legs specifically to prevent their blood from rushing so low into the body, allowing them to pilot their Arwings better."
todayilearned,fdghcxk,t3_el5fyo,1578396840.0,"Human cultures, climate, and wildlife are also factors.

The climate of Greenland is much the same as the northern part of North America, the wildlife distribution is very similar, and the human cultures (both before and after colonization) are similar.

With Australia the climate is relatively unique for the region and and the wildlife is unlike anywhere else on earth. Plus both the aboriginals and modern inhabitants are vastly different culturally from the nearby Southeast Asia"
