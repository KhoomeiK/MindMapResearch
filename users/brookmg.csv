Feedback and comments are highly appreciated"

assholedesign,fe4161w,t3_enj98c,1578854775.0,This is a different level of scam.
freefolk,fe402bi,t3_enodev,1578854515.0,I didn't want to be reminded about the ending today. Thanks
androiddev,fe3lyo5,t1_fe3fx83,1578850535.0,Exactly... the bots are not our friends
androiddev,fe3luz6,t1_fe1odhf,1578850498.0,"As far as i know, you get to send those contracts after a bot suspends your app for copyright or something like that. Probably if you put a link in your privacy policy you might be alright"

androiddev,fd8n0w0,t1_fd8golr,1578220464.0,Actually why didn't you work with Viewpager or Viewpager2 ? But awesome work nonetheless
androiddev,fa6k1mu,t1_fa670at,1575825410.0,"Exactly, Click fraud is a thing and I might end up paying for nothing is my fear. Actual installer would've been fine"
