""If you're driving to a hospital because your passenger is giving birth, and you see a motorcycle accident, where you see the rider has flown away from the road. Do you stop and help?""

This kind of accident specifically, because in a situation like that you might have to stay behind for a long time to make sure the rider stays alive, in case they're hurting and can't move. I mean, you're not supposed to move the neck in a situation like that when you're not trained to do so, and it's not necessary to get him off the road either.

My girlfriend was adamant that you need to just call the emergency number while driving and keep going. I was adamant you stay behind. It got really heated and we eventually stopped.

Fast forward college: we have the mandatory first aid training. Our trainer is an actual doctor, who tells us she works mainly as a midwife actually. Great! So after the training I ask her this exact question. And behold: ""Of course you stay and help! In very rare cases does the baby even come out in the car. And even if it would you're calling the ambulance to that location. Not to mention, while riskier, natural birth isn't a 100% death sentence like some people seem to think.""

Even if that is illegal in my country to do, when I literally aren't a part of it).

People usually tried to ignore me, or blame me for shit I had absolutely no part in, so in the end I started lying about all kinds of stuff to get some other forms of attentions. Sometimes, my lies even got me a ""permission"" to play with some of the other kids. Damn, I even took the opportunity to go and play at my worst bully's house when I got the chance, even if that ended up with her literally locking me in her room and telling me she wouldn't let me out if I didn't clean her room. 

Her father was in it too btw. Hated my guts apparently. 

But yeah, then we moved to a sane place, and while the lying lasted awhile, it was a bigger shock when people DIDN'T automatically hate everything about me and people DIDN'T think I was wrong and broken and a monster, and what the fuck? The teachers actually worked to help me and got me in a social program to...you know... HELP? Instead of shoving me in the school storage room whenever I misbehaved? That was mindblowing.

The hospital is divided in two buildings: one which has everything from ER to maternity wards and operating theatres.

The other is for mental health. Childreb's psychiatric ward. Adult's psychiatric ward. Psychiatric doctors, and yes, even a closed off ward for patients who need constant supervision. These wards are in different floors of the building.

This was a one-time event. But it has made me more wary of the people I meet on the road from the main-hospital (note. OUTDOORS) to the one I see my psychologist in.

WatchPeopleDieInside,feox1ud,t1_feor7g0,1579307248.0,">A well raised child has better chances of not being an asshole, than one who was poorly.

This feels even worse since I can just feel how many things you're not understanding or taking into consideration.

Children are not capable of thinking altruistically, they are inherently selfish. Empathy and thinking of others is a learned skill, learned through...guess what? The kid realizing it's benefitial for THEMSELVES.

Another thing is, do you have siblings? Have you noticed how different you turned out, despite having the same parents, generally same upbringing, and same rules? It's easy to see even at a young age, that there are differences that you can not control. 

I would like to think I was raised well by my parents, but I was still an extremely violent problem child, because of external factors (teacher's and students bullied me because my mother had me out of wedlock. Not her fault I was influenced by it).

I know large families. An ex friend,and my cousins. All the children are vastly different, even early on. Similarities arise, like affinity towards art in one and symptoms of adhd in the other family... but there are always differences.

My ex friend's family had one child who is a textbook narcissist. She absolutely is manipulative, malicious, and cares about nothing but herself (I have seen this behavior first hand, and it's honestly scary. This kid literally manipulated other children to spread false rumours about her big brother, getting people in our school to avoid and bully him, because.... he didn't let her play HIS gameboy. She even admitted this when I was at their house.) The other children are rather well behaved, aside from the ex-friend who got seriously fucked up thanks to his little sister.

Despite many attempts of trying to help,understand, bargain, explain, punish and otherwise parent the kid, she still turned out this screwed up way. When 3 other siblings turned out just fine. And that is just what I've seen.

There are multiple stories I've read too, where a child with nothing extraordinary in their parenting, and who have successful well ""raised"" siblings... turn out to be abusers, criminals, rapists, etc. Out of no fault from their parents, as they are proven to be able to raise the other kids ""right.""



Tldr; 
I think it's absolutely entitled, idiotic and dismissive of you to smack talk parents for ""being shit parents"" when parents honestly don't have that much power over how their child will turn out no matter what."

badwomensanatomy,fduh5n7,t1_fduez3k,1578732910.0,"Let's talk about the girl I mentioned then: her mother is an author of multiple books dwelling into the art of bdsm, female domination, the wonders of condoms, and sexuality of transgender women in today's cultures. 

She once heard a friend of a friend say the N-word and she was completely shocked even hearing it, as she's not used to actually hearing such language used. Honestly, she's probably the most politically correct of our entire friend group, but this is exactly the kind of stuff that would fit right in with her room decor. 

I also think in today's world everything is taken far too seriously. You make a sexist joke, you're immediately a misogynistic pig? Am I a horrible piece of shit making ""woman go in the kitchen and make me a sandwich"" jokes to my girlfriend (both of us being girls?) And her responding with a witty joke about my nonexistent manhood? Am I an absolute ass for sending back and forth sexist as hell memes with another friend, and having a laugh about them when I know this is the kind of man who drove this one girl around, got offered head instead of money, and turned it down, only to later tell me he felt bad the woman was ready to sell herself for 20 bucks and just wanted her to respect herself more?

There are HUGE differences between jokes, items, etc. And the actual people and what they think.

Even here, I don't see the chairs itself as a problem. If a sexist pig buys them, then it's a problem. If someone with a demented sense of humor, but decent morals buys them, I see absolutely no issue here what so ever."

I don't think anyone would want to fuck it, but I know one girl who collects weird and quirky stuff and this would definitely fit the bill. And I know a guy who would find this the funniest thing ever.

 I don't think that immediately makes every single one of us misogynistic ,racists, etc. Next you're going to claim pocket pussies are bad, any sexy depiction of the female body is bad, porn is bad even when made by consenting women who genuinely want to do it as a job(yes.
