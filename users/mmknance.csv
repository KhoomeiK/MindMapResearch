SuicideWatch,fdci05n,t3_ekgmxz,1578275384.0,"As long as you continue to spend time with people who have the same values and hobbies as you, youre bound to find someone. My first boyfriend was embarrassed of being seen with me. He didnt like to hold hands with me at all. I felt very alone back then, this was when I was 16. We broke up a few years later but I continued to tell myself that someone will come along one day. I spent time with decent people who had similar interests and i met my current boyfriend. He's my best friend. After only a few months we kind of understood what the other was thinking without explaining. I feel very safe with him. Physical and emotional warmth are craved by human beings. Its natural. Basically continue to be yourself and do your best to be a decent person and the right one will come along. It sometimes takes a little while"
Advice,fdcglg2,t3_ekkmyr,1578274388.0,"Take a breath. If you know that youre better apart then thats half the battle. Hopefully you both have had a conversation about co-parenting your kids.

Youre always going to care for him and thats normal. Hopefully you have family or friends nearby to talk to or stay with. Youre going to need some time to yourself. Youre gonna need to figure out who you are without him as your S.O. Dont think about relationships for at least a year or so. Focus on your job hunt and your kids right now. Going jogging or biking will give you time to think and is good for your health. Focus on you and do things that you want to do. Have fun, as long as you dont indulge in too much unhealthy behavior, you dont want to use unhealthy behavior as a coping mechanism so try to avoid heavy drinking or reckless sexual behavior."
SuicideWatch,fdcftgx,t3_ekks44,1578273843.0,When you guys are alone in the house just kinda casually ask how shes doing. Ask about her friends. She'll most likely be kinda weirded out and give short responses or she'll know that you found her note. I feel like she mightve left it there on purpose hoping someone would find it. You can also have the conversation about how you know you guys arent close because of the age difference but that youre still her older sibling and you'll always be there if she needs you. Other than that pay close attention to her without making it obvious. Don't leave her alone at anytime until you have a conversation about either mental health in general or about her note. If you feel like shes acting strangely itd probably be best to let your parents know.

What were your problems in your relationship before this? Did he explain why he cheated?"
raisedbynarcissists,fd1ovwm,t3_ejtd9d,1578134489.0,"Umm. Your mother died from a mysterious fire. He then basically stole large amounts of money? Don't go. Jesus christ dont go. Speaking as someone from a family where my uncle stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from an account belonging to him and 5 siblings, money obsessed people will do anything. Including bribing police officers to destroy evidence and having female family members savagely beaten up in front of young children. Your father took less money and someone around him is dead. Do not go. File a restraining order. Stay as far away as possible. Make sure your family stays away."
SuicideWatch,fd1nxvu,t1_fd1ewjd,1578134030.0,"I understand, but purchasing a house with someone is a life long decision. Dating is not as serious a commitment as marriage, not emotionally or financially. If you decide to breakup, youre both still stuck in the house with each other. You'll be in the same exact situation as before except it'll be way more messy legally. If he stops paying because you brokeup and you cant afford the mortgage by yourself, your credit is shot and you'll get your house repossessed. You wont be able to rent a hole in the wall.
 I highly recommended living on your own for a little to get used to freedom from you ex. Get some space to yourself. Get to know yourself again and speak to a financial adviser about your plans. This is a potentially messy and complicated situation and you already have other things going on. Not at all saying that your boyfriend would do these things, but its happened so many times to so many people.  If you think youre in a bad situation now, it can always get worse. I know youre probably thinking of settling down and i really hope that this guy's the one to do that with, but I'm just saying think everything through and talk to a financial advisor before making your decision. Anyway best of luck"
Advice,fd1jw3k,t3_eji5wi,1578132261.0,"This is not normal, as youve already figured out. The reason why society looks down on this is because in the case that you ever accidentally have children, your children will either be mentally or physically handicapped. This is why in most countries, marrying your cousin is illegal, not to mention siblings.

Relationships between blood relatives happens enough to where it's been documented. There were a few cases in the US where a long lost parent/ sibling would meet their child/sibling and be attracted to them. Apparently it has something to do with family members having similar personalities and looks or something. Anyway dude. Please stop. I know you think youre in love, this is not love. I'm worried about both your mental well being, the well being of any future children, and the mental health of your parents. This is not normal or healthy in anyway. Please please talk to someone about this. I know you dont think this is affecting anyone but it is and it will"

SuicideWatch,fd1g1bu,t3_ejsdey,1578130887.0,It doesnt work. Youd have to be taking way more than 60 pills which at that point your body would make you vomit them all up. You'll feel like shit for a few days. I repeat: this will not work.
SuicideWatch,fd1f6ev,t3_ejrl18,1578130707.0,"I guarantee that the breakup is deeply affecting her decisions to attempt this, especially if she already has some issues. You need to talk to her, either over the phone or in person. Let her know that you still care for her, that you'll be there if she needs, and that even if you guys arent together youre still her friend.

Can I ask why exactly you felt you needed a break?"
SuicideWatch,fd1e9i4,t3_ejtzz4,1578130347.0,"The ""boomers"" youre talking about are right. You shouldnt be looking at buying a house when you have only $3,000 saved. You should not be thinking about buying a house with a boyfriend when youre obviously recently divorced. 

I completely understand the situation youre in as I'm in a very similar one. There are 2 things you need to do for yourself.
1) Get yourself financially stable
2) Move out of your Ex's

You need to save up, whether that means getting a second job or something. The job you have now, you need better. You deserve better. You need guaranteed hours. Start by looking into government jobs in your area. They at least guarantee hours and pay rates. If you cant find a better job, then you need to start doing something on the side. I highly recommend Uber or something of that sort. If you cant do that, look into realty. Food delivery. Weekend jobs, you name it. Anything to save up extra money. And you dont touch this money. 

Once you have a few grand extra to fall back on, then you start looking at options of moving out. It would be best to live with roommates for at least a year, to help save while youre going to school. You may have to move out of your city or state if it means making ends meet. But above all, do not talk about making lifelong commitments like purchasing a house with someone youre not at least engaged to. You need to take a long hard look at what youre doing. Step back and think about logistics. It wont be fun, but this needs to happen if you want to have a better future"

It will be painful. It will be awkward. Be willing to have a conversation because he may want to work things out. He might have some other things going on, but if you love him and he even just cares about you, you need to have a discussion. Just lay everything on the table and be honest about what you feel and why."

Advice,fcl47gw,t3_ehn8qm,1577739444.0,"None of this is your fault. He should never yell at you in public let alone hold you by the throat. He has proven that he can and will seriously hurt someone if he would do something like that to someone hes supposed to love. You and your daughter are not safe around him. No one should ever treat anyone the way hes treated you. This behavior is not normal in any way, it doesnt matter if other people do some similar things in Scotland. This is not normal, functional, or safe behavior.

When children are as young as your daughter, they copy behaviors. You dont want your daughter thinking this behavior is normal. The best thing, for both you and your daughter, is to take your diary and go to the police. These acts need to be reported. You need to immediately speak to the police and a lawyer about the safety of you and your daughter."
Advice,fci79ie,t1_fcgc6b8,1577658573.0,"This ❤. Youre very brave. If you decide to raise your baby, there are pregnancy resource centers out there. Some are religious, not sure if thats an issue, but they usually give free supplies or free child care until the babys about 3. If youre thinking about adoption, the adopting couple pays for all medical fees. Either way try to contact LetThemLive or Live Action. I think for the most part they try to help abortion minded women but at the very least they can give you some info on where you can get financial help if you need. Especially if you think your parents might react violently. Feel free to message me if you need. I'll try to find more resources now

Advice,fchkid7,t3_eh5p9s,1577651291.0,"A very recent study came out in the last few months saying that humans only cause about 1/10 of a percent of climate change. Whether you believe that or not, people have been saying the that the Earth was going to end from an ice age in the 70s, then it became global warming. Al Gore (a politician) in the early 2000s stated that sea levels would rise something like 20ft worldwide ""in the near future"" while actual scientists have stated by 2100 sea levels will rise by 6 inches. Gore also stated that the ice caps would be completely gone by 2014, but right now we have the most ice caps from anytime in the last few hundred years.

Basically what im saying is, we've had people telling us about the ""imminent danger"" for the last 50 years or more. Scientists today are saying that these changes will be very slow and people alive today will be dead by the time these changes start happening. Pollution is down in most parts of the world while its up in India and China. Nothing youre doing right now will negatively affect anyone. You'll be fine, everyone you know and love will be fine. Live your life and if this bothers you this much, enjoy your youth and as an adult work as some type of scientist to find fuel sources or ways to reduce pollution."
Advice,fchf95w,t1_fch0pa1,1577649899.0,"I see these types of posts and I'm entirely convinced that they should never be taken down for a few reasons. 
1) People need to see that nutjobs like this are out there. Removing their posts deletes the evidence of their insanity.
2) Censoring people like this will only embolden them. When people are censored, strangers are more willing to jump to their aid. This draws more people to their way of thinking
3) If the evidence of these thought processes are open for anyone to see, people can report them to authorities. The authorities are more likely to keep an eye on these people in case they ever decide to act on these thoughts.

No matter how screwed up these people are, trying to control their thoughts and opinions is fascism and will only backfire"

When these thoughts happen frequently, then its time to worry.

Also with your attraction to your female friend, I understand that you feel kind of strange about it since you've only considered yourself as a homosexual until now. I didnt really get being Bi until recently. I thought I was straight, im not but i definitely lean more towards guys.

At least you have another group of friends, even though youre not as close as you were with your old friends.

Sometimes people get very uncomfortable when emotions like sadness are involved since they dont know how to help, it might be easier for them to pretend they dont know youre sad. But if you feel like you really need to talk to someone, you can try to ask your parents for advice, talking to a teacher or school counselor, or keeping a diary.
