IsItBullshit,fddb6gh,t1_fdc9bs8,1578303610.0,"I think it really depends on the company culture and your team/manager, which is why it's important to ask questions of the interviewers.  I was really worried about this before my new job because I was kind of spoiled with time off at my previous employer, but I asked all the team members in my interviews and they made me feel better about how our manager handles it."
IsItBullshit,fddah7r,t1_fdccdso,1578302543.0,"Mine is like that and varies by manager. My manager suggests 4 weeks, others strongly encourage only like one 1-week vacation a year and then if you take a day or two a few times throughout the year, no biggie.

I hate how it's kind of a crapshoot, just another thing that can make coworkers resentful"
IsItBullshit,fddaadf,t1_fdcezee,1578302262.0,"> Full time employees at larger companies might get 2 weeks paid max.

The last 4 jobs I've had (which is all the full-time jobs I've had) gave at least 2 weeks starting paid time off plus pretty standard holidays (new year's, memorial day, Independence Day, labor day, Thanksgiving, Christmas). People with the company 20+ years would get 4 weeks per year and could carry over like 6 weeks.

I get that certainly not all jobs have that, but saying that it's capped at 2 weeks is a bit much."
