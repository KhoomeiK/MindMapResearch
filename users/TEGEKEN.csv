aww,ff429ge,t1_ff3pznn,1579553969.0,"""Pit bulls make up only 6% of the dog population, but they’re responsible for 68% of dog attacks and 52% of dog-related deaths since 1982, according to research compiled by Merritt Clifton, editor of Animals 24-7, an animal-news organization that focuses on humane work and animal-cruelty prevention.""

I kinda feel bad for using ""crime statistics"" as proof for violence coming from a breed because its the same thing people do when they want to prove black people are more violent, but before you call me a racist for this, i want to explain the difference.

While there are many, many factors that influence crime statistics such as arrestation rates, socioeconomic conditions, historical events etc. There arent actually that many factors that influence the percentages of attacks by breed of dogs, especially not since 1982 because dogfighting was outlawed many years prior to that. 

""for the 32 years he’s been recording, there has never been a year when pit bulls have accounted for less than half of all attacks.""

""Another report published in the April 2011 issue of Annals of Surgery found that one person is killed by a pit bull every 14 days, two people are injured by a pit bull every day, and young children are especially at risk.""

It's just wrong to ignore all of these sources that you asked for. Also whats up with the ""pit bulls arent even a breed"" thing you brought up 3 times?It doesn't matter if its a determined breed or not, its a category that includes a few breeds with similar characteristics."

Bilgi arşivinin büyük olması hepsinin doğru olduğu anlamına gelmiyor, doğru, ancak bilgi arşivinin binlerce kişi tarafından kontrol edilmesi ve düzene sokulması, bilgilerin çok büyük bir kısmının doğru, neredeyse yok denilebilecek kadar küçük kısmının yanlış olduğu anlamına geliyor. Ayrıca vikipedide hep objektif bir dil kullanılmaya çalışılıyor ve hiçbir yazıda taraf tutulmuyor. “tarihi kendilerine uyduğu gibi yazmaları”nın sebebi kullandıkları belki kaynaklarda olan yalanlar olabilir ama o konuda yapabilecekleri bir şey yok, oldukça seçici davranıyorlar aslında.

ToiletPaperUSA,feg8z64,t1_feci8qq,1579082784.0,"Different guy here, im personally a leftist but you both bring up interesting points. I just wanted to say my problem with capitalism and unregulated free market is the existence of inferior jobs. Why do you believe a trashman, for example, deserves worse living conditions than say, a landlord? Its definitely not determined by effort and i would say a trashman is indeed necessary for society to continue working in the same way. Please dont use the “but mud pies are useless” strawman argument because it obviously does not reflect reality. When you leave payments entirely in peoples hands, you will try to pay as little as possible in every scenario, and charge people as much as you possibly can, since low level jobs will always be replaceable because of the amount of people struggling to survive and the only way out is to get a higher level job, which will always be harder because they will be less replaceable. If all low level workers stop working, no one will be there to clean the streets, workplaces, do jobs that are frowned upon but necessary, and society will fail to function normally, so there is always a need for lower class workers with less money. How does the free market solve that? In real life, its solved by the fact that a global strike will not just happen. In theory, supply and demand says the wages would increase if supply drops and demand stays the same but because of the increase in wages there will be a surge in workers which, again, according to supply and demand means the wages would go down again. So unless im skipping something there is no way to escape poverty without a specific scenario even in theory, let alone real life, although you seem more knowledgeable in economics so i might learn something here.

What im trying to say is capitalism punishes people for doing necessary work purely because it ends up being “easy” and i dont find that fair, you can respond to that with “nature isnt fair” as you did in the previous comment but obviously we dont have to abide by the “rules” of nature when we have this kind of modern society that defies all those rules on a regular basis."

CompetitiveMinecraft,fdh1eye,t3_elcz24,1578413285.0,"120 something star with 7 fkdr here (not the best but its alright), aggressive playstyles are more fun, less repetitive and more effective. Rush the person next to you as soon as you get 16 iron, make a wool or wood defense, depending on how confident you are that others will not rush you (learn to read your opponents) and rush one of your 2 sides, on certain maps its very clear which one you should rush first, but on some of them youre about equally close, usually go for the one that is rushing you, or at least planning on doing it (again, learn to predict, youll get that with practice), learn how to play better on certain maps, get faster at doing stuff you do every game like: bridging, defending your bed, buying stuff from the shop. Bridge up at least 4-5 blocks above the surface of whatever it is that you are rushing, so that they will not be able to rush you back as fast, you will have the high ground, you can jump down whenever you want or prevent them from rushing you to keep pressure and they will not be able to hit you while youre up there. Learn how to ninja bridge (shift unshift), you dont have to learn all these crazy bridging techniques because the difference they make is usually pretty minor, but the difference between regular bridging and even average ninja bridging is a LOT, so practice that, in about 10 minutes youll be able to do it consistently, in a while you will be able to do it faster. Dont ever make a defense bigger than 3-4 layers, it damages you more than it helps, on most maps it blocks your entrance disallowing you from getting out as fast as possible, and also it gives better players a chance to hide inside your defense. Thats all i can think of right now, if you play like this you will be able to win most games, good luck"

CompetitiveMinecraft,fbx8m76,t1_fbwlrt1,1577174333.0,"In 1.8 fighting back is not very hard, those long combos where you cant even hit the person comboing you are usually caused by lag, or hypixels weird kb. Also as both of us have said, in 1.9 you get punished less for your mistakes since your opponent cant follow up their attacks without you hitting them, and its easier to not make those mistakes because you have a longer time to aim. Which makes it more approachable for less skilled players, but at the same time it makes it less competitive because no matter how good you are, there is a huge hard cap limiting how much better you can become, and the difference between the best player, and a good player will be pretty much negligible."
CompetitiveMinecraft,fbvwgsd,t1_fbvttlc,1577137078.0,"well you knew what i was going to say, said it yourself and skipped a few comments which is nice, although you mentioned how its impossible to get out of a combo in 1.8 without getting hit a few times while ignoring how that is how it works in every game, if you make a mistake you get punished for it, theres usually not a second chance.
CSGO: you miss a shot, you get shot
Smash: you miss a grab, you get comboed
Racing games: you make a mistake, others pass you
Minecraft 1.8: you miss a hit, you get comboed
Minecraft 1.9: you miss a hit, you get hit once

Every combat system has a way of punishing people when they make mistakes, the punishment being more or less significant doesnt make a game more or less competitive, although, the fact that a very high skilled player will not be much better than an average player kind of shows a game isnt very competitive."
