depression,feho0os,t1_feh0e2h,1579120424.0,I got to the point that I just constantly think about things that‚Äôs bring me down as a reminder to not fall for the same trap.
depression,fdoxcb2,t3_emfnfz,1578615024.0,"This happens to me the most when I try to go to bed. I barely sleep to avoid my mind going to bad places. I‚Äôll remember only the things that made me sad and depressed. I don‚Äôt know when I stopped feeling happiness, and everything I do everyday feels like a chore/job. I do it because that‚Äôs the norm, because everyone else is doing it. At this point, I can‚Äôt care less if other people are doing it anymore. Nothing is fun and life boils down to routines and random bullshits."
depression,fdohwtx,t3_emfngp,1578605485.0,This is amazing. I don‚Äôt really know how to do a better job describing what depression feels like than this.

depression,fdod5h3,t3_em5w9m,1578602981.0,I used to thought boredom is what‚Äôs going to kill me but it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the stupid amount of nonsense bullshit tries to beat you down in this boring and meaningless life. What‚Äôs hard for me is getting back up everytime having  to deal with them. Now I got anxiety and don‚Äôt even know what I want in life anymore. I just want a moment of peace away from all the bullshit.
depression,fdo9kbq,t3_cml6ni,1578601243.0,Feeling like shit is like my default operation mode now. Even if nothing happens I still tear up and my mind keeps ringing with ‚Äúmake it stop‚Äù.
worldnews,fbddj6i,t1_fbdanrc,1576758558.0,"The ones that do immediately disappear the next day. They can‚Äôt organize anything either as all media is heavily state controlled. Good example for this is the protest in Hong Kong. People willing to lead and organize the protest are immediately captured, which leaves chaos and gives China all the more reason to use the police/military. Exactly what they wanted in the first place."
