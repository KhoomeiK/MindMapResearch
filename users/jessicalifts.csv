Your friend has high ticket items on her amazon gift registry because if people buy off her registry amazon with gift her cash to buy the remaining items on her registry. So if people buy all the small stuff off her list, then she'll get like 50 or a hundred bucks off the stroller or car seat or whatever to purchase herself off her registry.

If you are really worried, talk to your friend in private before the event and let her know that times are tough and you are planning to gift a high quality handmade gift and you hope she will understand and want to support her by lending a helping hand after baby arrives.

I was also optimistic we might see more unannounced releases (maybe more indie stuff?) a little more frequently but I appreciate that was probably expecting a little too much and we do have our recent ""120 games"" announcement so that's good.  I'd also like to see more games that are more amenable to short play sessions.  For all the talk of the Dadias out there, maybe it's different for moms because I definitely don't have my baby's whole nap in which to game, that's also the only opportunity I get to shower and eat without somebody trying to crawl into my shirt!

So he waited until after his adoptive parents passed out of curiosity. At this point he was in his 60s and very secure in his identity and his life and his own family with his wife and daughter. He was glad to meet them and understand that part of his own back story. The difference is of course that his mom was passed and didn't know. 

It's hard to say that anybody is TA in your situation, I think it is very normal and understandable for your daughter to be curious, and it's understandable that it would cause you heartache. It's even understandable that birth mom may have had some heartache to have given her up in the first place. I don't anybody is at fault or TA here though emotions are understandably running high.

We want her to decide how online she wants to be when she grows up and it's age-appropriate.  My friend doesn't put her daughter's name and the associated image descriptions are sometimes vague.  People who really know her know exactly who's in that photo but maybe ""social media friends"" might not explicitly know.  So are you sure you know your ex's motivations for the way that he posts to social media?  What does it really matter to you if people who follow his feed explicitly know he's a dad or not?  I don't know enough about his overall social media habits to really know why he posts the way he does, and if it comes from a place of assholery or not.

I think her traffic infraction is serious too, but she recieved the appropriate fine and temporary suspension. It doesn't sound like much time has passed between then and when you went to the DMV. Do you really know your ex-wife wouldn't come around to your point of view? 

Also, have fun driving her home from late-night weekend and summer job shifts for 2 years. I mean, potentially, you are the one getting punished here."

hisdarkmaterials,fdredgc,t3_em6fp5,1578683327.0,I think an animated HDM would be cool.  I am a little anime-lapsed so I don't really know who I would want to do it as an anime exactly.
