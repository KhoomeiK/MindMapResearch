NoahGetTheBoat,ffeocll,t1_ffentd8,1579857190.0,Dammit.  You got me.  I have been trying to come up with something clever and you served it.  Props to you!
unpopularopinion,ffc8laf,t1_ffc8huo,1579794019.0,"Other than that, I completely agree with you.  100 percent."
unpopularopinion,ffc87h4,t3_esqhc3,1579793772.0,"I have to disagree with this commentary based on 1 thing alone.... My wife doesn't work.  She doesn't work because she has a rare incurable brain disorder and a migraine disorder.  She did not choose to stay home.  Because of this, I do not think that she is responsible for the house work.  I still feel like the responsibility should be shared as her not working is a result of her neurologist's orders.  In this case I don't believe she is responsible for more than half of the housework even though I am working full time."
insanepeoplefacebook,ffbqhrg,t3_esoq7r,1579778611.0,"Yup, Obama was the harbinger of renewed racism.  I'm glad someone else finally noticed that the only president who was not white set us back 60 years and now everything is segregated again.  Thanks for the support of the KKK and the neo-Nazis, Obama.  This is an example of everything that is wrong with this nation... I really think there needs to be some sort of IQ test administered to people before allowing them to post on social media...../s
Edit: added /s in case anyone thought I was serious."
insanepeoplefacebook,ffbq9lg,t3_esf3c4,1579778307.0,"I like that whenever there is a discussion regarding anything to do with ""unChristian acts"" such as abortion, the immediate response is somehow worshipping Satan or demons.  Like, I didn't realize that not taking the communion means I'm now a Satanist.  As always, I'm flabbergasted."
intermittentfasting,ffbq36n,t3_eshkny,1579778059.0,Get it girl!  You got this!
NoahGetTheBoat,ffbpkmc,t3_esiwt6,1579777332.0,"It's ""dick in a box"" the female edition."
unpopularopinion,ff9x24z,t3_esbzgm,1579723373.0,"There is never a situation where people don't find this statement to be relevant..... For me, it was yes I know both your parents died before you turned 40 but think of the holocaust survivors.  I know there have been so many people who have had it worse, but shit, let me grieve and stop giving me advice about how someone somewhere has it worse than me.  Just. Be. Fucking. Present. For. Me."
BobsBurgers,ff0recw,t3_eqyo1y,1579471596.0,This now needs to be an episode.
unpopularopinion,feac2s3,t1_fe6qdgs,1578946845.0,Thank you
unpopularopinion,fe61xea,t1_fe5zzu4,1578879948.0,With my spelling it is female.  But it can be make or female depending on the spelling...
unpopularopinion,fe4jwf8,t3_enpqsa,1578860116.0,"My name is Taryn.  Not hard.  Not even spelled strangely.  Yet the mispronounciations of it have been pretty impressive.  My wife's mother named her Meaghan (yes, just Megan) but because of all the letters, she is called a variety of things from MEEgan to MeHeGAhan.  Granted, we never found our names on Keychains at the beach, but our names are pretty normal when I consider ANY OF THE NAMES of the poor children I had to investigate when I worked for child services.  NEVEAH (heaven backwards), Abcde (absidee), La-A (Ladasha), and my personal favorite Jdubyah (J  Dub Ya)"
2meirl4meirl,fe4hsct,t3_eno5d6,1578859472.0,"Bahahaha.  Omg, I'm actually crying I laughed so hard at that."
intermittentfasting,fe4hd49,t3_enpvv6,1578859311.0,You can really see it in your chest and belly though.  Keep it up brother.
BobsBurgers,fe4b8ie,t3_enpn36,1578857510.0,"I think the first half of season one, they definitely started going down the family pitted against each other rabbit hole but thankfully they reeled it back and gave us the best animated series.  My wife and I re-watch all the seasons over and over and constantly find new things that make us die laughing.  I love that the family, regardless of whatever the issue is, always pulls together and is there for each other."

intermittentfasting,fdug50y,t3_emz1ca,1578732467.0,Looking amazing and happier brother.  Keep it up!
cats,fdod1cd,t3_ema20o,1578602927.0,Good Luck to Maximus!  Our little Gus had her left eye removed and is so much the better for it.  (traumatic glaucoma)
CatsAreAssholes,fdfpnea,t1_fdfpda6,1578367202.0,She makes me laugh she's so naughty.  Like her naughtiness literally tickles me.
intermittentfasting,fdfpgtt,t3_el47z7,1578367078.0,You got this!
cats,fdforjg,t3_el3rpt,1578366615.0,So so sorry for your loss.  There are no words.  Hugs and love to you.
CatsAreAssholes,fdfoirf,t3_ekveit,1578366452.0,Our one eyed demon hellcat Gus waits until we have put all the clean laundry away before she systematically pulls all of my wife's underwear out of the drawer and unfolds every single pair of panties.  It's her second favorite game.  Her first?  Dragging the 2.5 gallon gravity waterer around the house and tipping it over for her entertainment.
intermittentfasting,fdfn1kr,t3_el3x76,1578365482.0,Keep it up!  You're doing great!  Hugs
insanepeoplefacebook,fdfm18f,t3_ekyzzp,1578364823.0,I literally just threw up in my mouth.

intermittentfasting,fdfku0h,t3_ekwkkw,1578364037.0,Fucking fantastic.  Congrats brother!
insanepeoplefacebook,fdfkm65,t3_ekxwzp,1578363893.0,Wow Australia...... And Gomorrah apparently
cats,fdfjrt5,t3_ekym3c,1578363346.0,"That is legit the nicest part of being a cat owner.  Soon enough, you'll wish for the days that they only lay on your book...... Lol (I married a cat lady.  I am now a cat lady.)"
intermittentfasting,fdda3zi,t3_eklsae,1578302000.0,Great job bro!  Keep it up.  You're doing fantastic and look great.

cats,fdcvhjt,t3_ekkeoc,1578285486.0,The Calvin and Hobbes tattoo is what makes this photo so perfect.  A boy and his tiger and a man and his kitty.  Bliss
