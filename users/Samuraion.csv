This may seem like a silly question (I'm artistically challenged after all lol) but do you use primer on your minis? The mini I'm getting soon will be a premium plastic Hero Forge mini like the one you've painted here, do they need primer?

Thanks so much for your help!"

If she were truly sorry she would have accepted your verdict of not forgiving her. Part of apologizing and asking forgiveness is knowing that there's a chance you wont be forgiven. She even had to say ""So we're cool now? Do you forgive me?"" just so she could get some sort of validation.

For the sake of giving her the benefit of the doubt: maybe she had actually been regretting it and truly did want to say sorry for years, and maybe being told no like that made her feel vulnerable in ways she hadn't felt before, due to the fact she probably got everything she wanted through force.

aww,feng0a8,t1_femoldz,1579283882.0,"One more thing that people haven't mentioned yet is that hedgehogs are self-anointing creatures, what this means is that they try and find fragrant or odorous things they can chew up and spit on their quills to kind of ""mask"" their scent. The downside is that a lot of the time in a controlled environment (living as a pet for example) the only thing they can find is... their poop. Hedgies will chew up their own poop and spit in on their quills.

Also male hedgehogs masturbate. Just a bonus piece of trivia for ya.

p.s. I loved my hedgehog Boba, he honestly looked just like the one in OP's video, except he was 100% antisocial. He didn't like cuddling and the only bonding he was cool with was laying on my belly under a blanket because it was warm. He would bite more often than other hedgies seemed to and he would rather *DIE* than let me clip his nails (which is 100% necessary or they can hurt themselves and get infected). Despite all this I loved him and it was fun having a hedgehog, but they are tricky pets to have and require a lot of patience and care. If you do still want one by chance, do LOTS of research, they are nocturnal and need constant ~80 degree F tempurature or they will attempt to hibernate and can die. Heat lamps are required.

Good luck!"
aww,fen61rk,t1_fen57wj,1579277763.0,"They poop wet for sure. Hedgehogs usually need ""foot baths"" every day or so because they poop when they run and they just run over the fresh poop and give themselves ""poop shoes. If they're feet stay dirty like that they can get infections, so baths are necessary.

As a side note, hedgehog skin is really sensitive and will dry out super fast, so you only truly bathe them when they really need it, but the feet can be washed daily if you only use a small amount of water at the bottom of a sink."

I didn't do any of the enchantment glitching or anything because once you get to a certain point it really makes no difference. But I used the Chaos enchantment you get from the Champions Cudgel in the DLC area to maximize my damage.

2. God of War. Such an amazing reboot with very fun combat and an excellent story.

3. Spider-Man. Basically the same description as God of War, but in an open world setting and web swinging.

4. The Last of Us. Another amazing game with a fantastic story.

5. Dying Light. A fun and fast paced zombie action game, lots of free running and zombie fighting. Story isn't so great in my opinion, but I think it's worth a playthrough.

6. Monster Hunter World. This was basically my first steps into the Monster Hunter franchise and it is a fantastic game. I spent hundreds of hours playing before I got burnt out, and even then I still want to play more sometimes.

7. Persona 5. Beautiful RPG, amazing music, lovable characters, flashy turn based combat. If you like turn based RPGs there is zero reason to not get this game.

8. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Made by FromSoft, who of course made Bloodborne which is also in my list. If you are more into action games rather than RPGs, pick this over Bloodborne. The combat is so fast, fluid, and precise, you will actually feel like a shinobi.

Sorry, but expecting someone else to do something for you because you lack the motivation to do it yourself is kinda lame.

But if she is trying to wake you and you are being a jerk to her, why would she want to do it at all? You need to try harder to wake yourself up. Maybe try one of the alarm clocks that simulate a sunrise and see if that gets you up easier.
