I have dermatographia for the first time this winter (I'm 50), and I have also been having heartburn/weird (painful) reflux. My doctor recommended Pepcid, as well as Claritin. So far, I've not taken either, as I have identified what causes the heartburn (a new dairy-free yogurt I was eating, all/any sugar, and vinegar). The dermatographia has not gone away, although it has lessened. I feel like the super-dryness of my skin this winter is also a factor, but can't account for all of the trouble I'm having!"
