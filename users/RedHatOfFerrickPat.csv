politics,ffeeanx,t1_ffc59w9,1579844805.0,">the only time people seemed to care about drone strikes...

People care when they expect other people to care. If there's no expectation that anybody else will care, then they don't judge that any efforts they might make will be worthwhile (e.g. one person spontaneously protesting city hall is unlikely to be seen as effective), and that realisation leads to less interest. That's what Bruce Wayne meant when he said ""people need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy"". People need something that they know everybody else will be paying attention to. That's why it works to flood the news with lies and in general to commit many egregious acts rather than just one. In such cases, nobody knows where everybody else's focus is going to be and unified public backlash is impossible.

A lot of people have cared about drone strikes. But the seeming (on your part) is a result of the very mechanism that I just described."

If there was no compulsory voting, there'd be no expectation that the person next to you had any interest in politics and it wouldn't be discussed as small talk. But there is. And politics does qualify for small talk apparently, which means that every ignorant piece of shit with eight opinions he received from the news or Facebook thinks it's fair game to spout them all because political discussion is part of the status quo. The thing about Facebook, Reddit, and other such venues is that someone inclined to adjudicate their opinions based on how little resistance they're likely to receive can do just that. They see shitty opinions packaged with hugely inflated confidence and in many cases aggression, and they think that since the person issuing them either doesn't get much criticism and/or succeeds in seeming confident when he does, this is an effective way to deal with the problem of being a complete fucking idiot without taking an enormous hit to the self-esteem.

In many cases, the stupidity of an opinion is a feature, not a bug.
