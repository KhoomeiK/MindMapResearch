beyondthebump,ff8qije,t3_es8ogj,1579691877.0,"Yes. I went back to work 4 weeks PP with PPD. Honestly for me it helped because it meant I was leaving the apartment a lot more and the 4 minute drive to work for some reason was really relaxing. It reestablished a norm in my life (I’ve been working consistently since I was 14). It’s possible, but honestly I don’t think all women should. It helped my recovery but I wouldn’t do it if you feel like it will be detrimental to yours."
Assistance,ff4sbxe,t1_ff4rsq2,1579571261.0,Oh my gosh thank you!!
beyondthebump,ff29qby,t3_er792f,1579497997.0,I love people like this! I was giving baby boy a bottle in a coffee shop after an awful mommy and me meeting that made me feel like poop for formula feeding (I had just quit a few weeks earlier and was in the heat of PPD) and this old man stopped and told me a mother feeding her baby is a beautiful sight no matter how the baby is fed because it’s a sign of love. I almost broke down crying. Seriously the people who are kind and understanding are wonderful and give us such hope.🥰
JUSTNOMIL,ff298hn,t3_er7wmp,1579497554.0,"Being the child in a similar situation, I 100% agree. My mom suddenly cut off contact with her parents when I was 13 and made it clear to me it was because of their choices. Well, 13 year old me did not process that right and I’m now in therapy for
PTSD because of all of the issues that separation caused me. I recommend cutting off JN people when your kids are young, not older."
beyondthebump,feyr953,t3_eqxxoq,1579449665.0,Honestly high waisted has become my friend. I wear high waisted pants with looser shirts and large sweaters. This has adapted well for my student teaching too. It’s comfy and easy and looks like I’m trying. Plus high waisted gives the illusion I’m still an hourglass even though I’m not.
beyondthebump,fevtrr8,t1_fevh5f4,1579401395.0,I can second this with Dr. Brown bottles and gas drops. Get simethecone drops. They are lifesavers and helped our baby boy’s colic so much.
fatlogic,fevtgj3,t1_feuy4vq,1579401272.0,I agree with this. I battled OSFED for years and went through phases that exercise was incredibly triggering for anxiety. I had to do exposure therapy to overcome it. In recovery and currently love to exercise but it took about 18 months of therapy and support. But if this is what is happening to this person I am concerned.
beyondthebump,fejwcm0,t1_fejseq4,1579187357.0,It took a couple days to adjust because it’s kind of weird at first. But a month later I’m more rested than I’ve ever been in my life.
beyondthebump,fejs2l8,t3_epjtn5,1579184454.0,"If you can afford it, get a weighted blanket. I’ve had insomnia my entire life and have had my weighted blanket for a little over a month and NEVER slept this well before. They are magical cloaks of sleep. I don’t know how they work just that they do and it’s been helpful that even nights baby boy is up a lot I’m getting good quality sleep which has helped my energy levels majorly. Highly recommend them."
beyondthebump,fei4avo,t3_ep9l22,1579129973.0,"Me. My son has a lip and tongue tie. Possibly a reason he couldn’t latch, but he takes a bottle fine and honestly I don’t see the point of having someone clip them. He’s 6 1/2 months, happy, healthy, growing, and doing awesome. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence surrounding the surgery being beneficial, but I’m yet to see actual evidence."
fatlogic,fegi1v7,t3_ep1h5f,1579093422.0,So she’s actually contracted to lose weight on her show. She has lost a lot but it’s in certain intervals depending on the storyline. It’s really interesting.
BabyBumps,feewioq,t3_eot3t8,1579042735.0,"I had to self diagnose SPD. It developed at 16 weeks for me and was horrendous. I had to push for something more than Tylenol. My symptoms prevented sleep so I was given a pregnancy safe sleep aid. I also made my doctor tell me my restrictions. I told him I was going to physical therapy and needed a referral. It was a good practice in self advocating. SPD is not taken seriously and it’s seriously not normal aches and pains. It is hell. Definitely push your OB to do more. Demand, don’t ask."
beyondthebump,fedim5m,t3_eolym3,1579012474.0,My husband changes a ton of diapers and he’s still like this 😂😂😂
beyondthebump,fedfzc8,t1_fedbdbp,1579010490.0,My son’s clothes don’t have them. Honestly not all babies are chunky. My son is 6 months around the waist but 12-18 months in height. I’ve started having to take in some pants so they fit right. If we didn’t live in a place that was consistently below 20 degrees Fahrenheit I wouldn’t worry about it but I have to so he has warm clothing under his snow suit.
beyondthebump,fece27a,t1_fec8jpq,1578971703.0,Haha I have no clue why it does that either😂😂😂
beyondthebump,febmqt9,t3_eocwb8,1578960503.0,I’ve been asking myself that since he was born. And what the heck is with decorative draw strings??? If they don’t work don’t add them. My y’all and skinny baby needs dang drawstrings on his pants.
JUSTNOMIL,fe61esg,t3_envpjw,1578879627.0,... ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME????? Your sorry excuse of an incubator is a bitch. That man is a creep and you followed your gut and good one you. Being sexually assaulted is NEVER your fault. EVER. I want to slap that woman. I’m so sorry that was her reaction. I’m fuming. My gosh.... I just can’t handle women like her.
fatlogic,fe5amn2,t1_fe55wt5,1578867081.0,"Yes, but her work out DVDs are seriously some of my favorite to do at home. If I consistently do them I lose fat and gain muscle and don’t have to have a panic attack at the gym to do it."
beyondthebump,fdzqqti,t3_engv58,1578793629.0,We sing Secret Agent Man as “Little [baby’s name] man” when we get him out of bed 😂
beyondthebump,fddsre3,t1_fddqtqu,1578323035.0,So I do a 21 day fix class at home. It’s 30 minutes of good paced cardio. Sucks because the company that hosts it is an MLM but the exercises work really well and I’m not being asked to join.
beyondthebump,fddelta,t1_fdde121,1578308716.0,Highly recommend the weighted blanket. Got it for panic attacks and now use it for sleep in general. It’s seriously the greatest thing ever invented.
beyondthebump,fdd030w,t3_ekoe46,1578289576.0,"Lifelong insomniac here. I’ve learned some helpful coping skills over the year.

1) Exercise. 2 hours before bed ideally. This always seems to help me sleep.
2) No blue light 1 hour before bed. No phones or computers in your room. Reading a physical book is a great way to wind down. I also journal to clear my head.
3) Quickest fix was investing in a weighted blanket. It’s a magical sleepy time blanket that seriously somehow puts me to sleep and helps me stay asleep. Works better than any sleeping pill I’ve ever been on.

Best of luck. Insomnia sucks."
beyondthebump,fdcyvvl,t1_fdcw3xz,1578288447.0,I should have mentioned he’s formula fed and on purées and cereal so meal time isn’t  a problem. Good to know there weren’t issues.
beyondthebump,fdb16wo,t3_ekhoot,1578252574.0,"There is a brand of books called Indestructibles that creates rip proof, chew proof, books. They are awesome."
beyondthebump,fdasybb,t3_ekcy8i,1578249707.0,"Honestly my baby reminds me of a clumsy, energetic puppy. He doesn’t understand how his body moves yet. He pants to express himself when he gets excited. He also never stops moving. Ever."
JUSTNOMIL,fcytcjm,t1_fcysj86,1578086647.0,"It’s her favorite thing in the world. Grandma has lived through an abusive marriage, some horrors during her service in Vietnam, homelessness, and so much crap. She just wants to teach kids how to paint and love her life doing it."
JUSTNOMIL,fcy849o,t1_fcy6iuv,1578076134.0,No clue. Grandma hasn’t seen them since she got home from the hospital.
beyondthebump,fcotzsk,t1_fcosb77,1577841511.0,"Maybe not a nanny, but if someone could come do my laundry for me that would be amazing."
beyondthebump,fcm5air,t3_ehxf7v,1577764604.0,Like Nuvaring? I love it. It’s my favorite and will forever be my go to for birth control until my husband gets a vasectomy. It works. It’s easy. And it gets out of your system fast if you have a bad reaction.
beyondthebump,fcbtny1,t3_egyy7g,1577590847.0,"So if I had had a winter baby, I would have the same mindset. 3 months. Visits with only people who I knew for a fact have flu shot and updated TDAP. Extremely strict hand washing. I had a summer baby, so I was comfortable taking him out on day 4 to the grocery store. Honestly, I don’t blame you for being cautious this time of year."
beyondthebump,fc5jy98,t3_egc2xx,1577459638.0,"Carters, Old Navy, H&M. Clearance racks. I get his jeans and other pants at Walmart because he’s growing so fast I can’t justify spending more money on them."
JUSTNOMIL,fc5gnu3,t1_fc5dbu3,1577457065.0,"We are going to seek a second opinion at the recommendation of another redditor. The state is bizarrely protective of woo believers and it disgusts me. I’ve always disliked anti-vaxxers, but I will be the first on the picket line supporting elimination of exemptions not based on actual medical need after this."
beyondthebump,fc5ael2,t3_eg82nc,1577450968.0,"You do not have to have a reason to switch to formula other than the fact you want to. I hate the pressure to breastfeed. It CAN be detrimental to your mental health. Eff I’m in therapy because of how traumatic my experience trying to breastfeed was. If you are feeling this way, tell them all to eff off it’s your body. My EFF infant has gotten sick significantly less than the 2 babies next door who are EBF. I genuinely think it will come out once the baby friendly hospital initiative goes under that breastfeeding isn’t nearly as helpful in building immunity as it’s claimed (and not really scientifically backed when looking at the meta-analysis). 

Honestly, you are being looked at like a food dispenser not a human. Moms matter. Make the switch. It’s 100% your choice because you are the one sacrificing your body and mind to do this."
beyondthebump,fc5a2mx,t1_fc54jza,1577450579.0,"Second this. It’s cheap, smaller, and easy to clean. Love this high chair."
JUSTNOMIL,fc3sht6,t1_fc3r0b7,1577397496.0,I’ll have to see if the doctors already have. All I know is my dad said her main doctor was livid that this happened. But if not it’s at least something I can do to get some justice.
BabyBumps,fc3q1hp,t3_eg19ax,1577395772.0,Already gave birth but distinctly remember this. I’m a vocalist and was taking voice lessons while pregnant. My voice coach said that the baby can take most of your oxygen and you feel completely out of breath. It sucks.
JUSTNOMIL,fc3n8u1,t1_fc3midc,1577393762.0,Yeah I can. This saga will probably not be over. I can imagine it will get worse with the trip itself happening.
JUSTNOMIL,fc3iw0w,t1_fc3gj7c,1577390789.0,We do have a pretty good law school in the major city. I’ll recommend grandma get a second opinion from the clinic there if they have one. That’s a really good idea. Thank you!
beyondthebump,fc3fzg3,t3_efz6eu,1577388956.0,"I don’t understand it either. Like other, though, 90% of the socks I own for baby boy are white. I hate patterned socks because I just don’t want to hear the BS about matching. I do have some but those were from my mom  who got me 3 pairs of each matching set so if we lose them it isn’t the end of the world haha."
JUSTNOMIL,fc3folu,t1_fc3bkjp,1577388770.0,Her lawyer is looking into it. We are hoping she can sue for something but the state has weird laws around stuff like this.
JUSTNOMIL,fc39c0p,t1_fc3921p,1577384599.0,Right? My grandma May never get time with LO again and it’s not fair to them? I’m just so mad and hurt. No empathy. No sympathy. Nothing. And thanks for the hugs. I’m just glad she’s still around.
JUSTNOMIL,fc399aq,t1_fc38vp5,1577384545.0,The state she’s in doesn’t allow for it. Her lawyer has been trying to find grounds to sue and just can’t. We are very lucky to still have her. I’m just grateful she lives 15 minutes away from on the of the best research hospitals in the states and they were able to help her. She wouldn’t have survived otherwise.
beyondthebump,fc2we1p,t1_fc2w13a,1577375813.0,No I haven’t seen those ones. I’ll have to order one and see if it works. I just don’t want anymore clothing removed while he’s asleep and this might work.
beyondthebump,fc2vuox,t1_fc2po49,1577375413.0,He hates them and is too tall for the ones we’ve found that he can’t easily slip out of. He’s tall and skinny.
beyondthebump,fc1vcry,t3_efprgz,1577330881.0,Ewwwww I didn’t even have to read the post. The title was enough. Follow your gut. This man outed himself as a creep. Makes it easy for you to know to avoid him.
JUSTNOMIL,fbzbs8g,t3_efa9lu,1577241459.0,"JustYesMom listened when I mentioned we were looking at getting stainless steel cookware because all of our current pots and pans are so worn out. We have a brand new, perfect 16-piece stainless steel set that will make cooking so much easier❤️"
beyondthebump,fbxgwqq,t3_ef053t,1577186866.0,Nope. We had to switch twice for my son. He was on Enfamil Neuro Pro. We switched to Similac Advanced and then to Total Comfort and finally found one that worked for him. Switching formula can be necessary for their sensitive tummies.
JUSTNOMIL,fbtjvk8,t3_eegmqb,1577081636.0,My MIL keeps dating crappy men. She screwed over my FIL in their divorce and now she’s back with an abusive ex. It’s pissing me off but I dropped the rope so DH can deal with it.
