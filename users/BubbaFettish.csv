CrappyDesign,ff7nwyy,t1_ff7l2tg,1579654074.0,"It‚Äôs not. This is the [Loop Variant of the Trolly problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem?wprov=sfti1).  Basically act to kill one or do nothing to kill 5. Look closer and you can see tiny skulls over people defining the choice. 

>	As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people and you can divert it onto a secondary track. However, in this variant the secondary track later rejoins the main track, so diverting the trolley still leaves it on a track which leads to the five people. But, the person on the secondary track is a fat person who, when he is killed by the trolley, will stop it from continuing on to the five people. Should you flip the switch?"

No one wants to read a long article, though I'm not opposed to it if it's a good murder. it's the complete dissection of an argument that I'm here for. 

Someone's bad assumptions is like an unlit fire cracker. Someone out there says something really stupid and / or obnoxious and it has like 5 dumb assumptions associated with it. It's super satisfying to read someone blow up each and every one of these bad dumb arguments. 

What I don't like about comebacks is that they can ignore the argument and they make a joke about the other person.  
I don't get to see any dumb assumptions destroyed, instead I see someone called dumb or ugly or both or they make some other joke. In my analogy, it's like someone walking past all these unlit firecrackers and instead of blowing any of them up, they walk past them and  make a joke about the person's hair. Sure it can be funny, but that's not why I'm here.
