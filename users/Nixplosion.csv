Nino and Yotsuba seem to be on good ground now and have arrived at the mutual understanding that Nino isn't upset or mad at Yotsuba and supports them but WILL steal away with Futaro if she gets the chance. Gotta love her determination and honesty. Nino never hides how she feels and that makes her so endearing. 

Miku doesn't know how to express herself but feels the same way as Nino.

Itsuki's uneasy feeling wasn't romantic love for Futaro but was an affection of sorts for him as a friend and hearing her sisters discuss their love for him made her realize she didn't have *those* feelings for him or if she did it was for a short time and is comfortable with how she feels now. (Her keeping the photo booth picture! Ugh my heart!)

Yotsuba wants the blessing of each sister before going all in with Futaro because she doesn't want to face their resentment and have everyone upset with eachother. 

Much like when they were kids, Yotsuba is the first one to ""pull away"" from the pack again by dating Futaro. 

Seems the drama is winding down and we will come in for a smooth landing to the final chapters with everything wrapped up in a pretty bow (pun intended?)"

My wife was diagnosed with Thyroid cancer in April of 2018 (spoiler: she's perfectly healthy now) but during the diagnosis phase and leading up to surgery she was a nervous wreck (even though she was aware of the extremely high survival rate). Paralyzed with fear that it was going to spread and something worse was going to happen. She wouldn't eat, lost 30 pounds because of anxiety.

She turned to Disney movies to distract herself and landed on Moana. The ""disease"" in the movie spreading from island to island was remeniscant of her disease and perhaps seeing a happy outcome at the end was soothing and so everynight we watched Moana because it was the only thing that could keep her calm and allow her to sleep.
