beatsaber,fco4mb0,t3_ehz0r6,1577823981.0,"I love Crab Rave, it's a very well put together map. The trick I find is to get the patterns down, even if that means slowing the song down for the first couple of times until you get the feel for it. There's also a tendency to go too fast and lose your rhythm with it!"
beatsaber,fco4gu9,t3_ehya4x,1577823901.0,"I don't like that kind of song, I like the ones with a bit of style to them, rather than how much can I simulate having a real-life seizure before having a real-life seizure."
