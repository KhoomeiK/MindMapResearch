Me and my husband had a chance to move to Atlanta two years ago for work and chose to stay here because we would have had to downsize from owning a 3 bed/2 bath house to renting a 2 bed condo or having an hour commute every day to work- and that was with the cost of living increase my work offered factored in.

My health insurance through my job covers everything I need. And if that didn't, my husband's would. Workplace equality,  from what I've seen where I've worked, has been stellar. And speaking with friends, they feel the same. Kay Ivey, IMO, has been a disease on this state (and dont get me started on the luvguv). I think a lot of people share the same sentiment, and I'm really hoping they rally behind a new candidate this coming election. I'm pretty conservative in a lot of areas, but am seriously considering voting dem because the old-time Republicans that have been running this state are failing at a lot of stuff I hold in high regard.

The only alligators you'll see walking around are in/near water in Mobile/South Alabama. Although there was one found in central alabama on Lay Lake, it's thought to have been someone's pet that was set free. The only time women wear those fancy dresses are if there is a festival that they are dressing up to be a part of a reenactment. I've heard rumor of them being worn at debutante balls, but I'm not high class enough to be a part of that fancy crap lol Southerne Belles are a thing: from what I gather they're a club that does philanthropy and is supposed to represent the best of the southern woman. I think the more upper-class the are the more they resemble the ones from Hart of Dixie. I've seen them in news papers and online but never in person lol



We do have parades with floats! If a parade doesnt have at least 5 floats, it's not a parade. We also let random people who own horses hold up the back of the parade just because they're on horses and everyone loves watching horses trot down the street. They don't even toss candy- they are just on cool horses. Summers are pretty freaking awful. It's the humidity that kills us. Typically 80-95°F and 60-80% humidity in central alabama. Worse in South Alabama. It's always humid here. 


Now I have to ask: what do Switzerland parades have if no floats?!?"
CasualConversation,fddw4ag,t1_fddt9qb,1578325426.0,"It's extremely safe. There are some back-woods areas that house asshole racists, but in the past 30 years of living I've never heard of a violent occurrence due to race. The things I've witnessed are backhanded remarks or disgruntled facial expressions pointed towards other-than-white people. No threats, just prejudice. And those that I've heard talk like that were hicks. If you hear someone say something racist, you'll see them met with eye rolls or told to shut the ef up. I hear Green County us still pretty racist, but again, I dont know of anything violent. I can actually remember visiting my grandparents in Green Co. when I was a kid and there still being segregated swimming. It wasn't advertised as segregated, but it was understood that this pool was for whites and that one for non-whites. My whole family was completely weirded out and disgusted by it, but to the locals that was normal. Green County is Po-dunkville, though, and should not be seen as a representation of Alabama.

CasualConversation,fdctqpb,t3_ekmzr5,1578284060.0,"A similar thing happened to me about 9 years ago. I was writing and playing music and thought I would maybe start playing out eventually. My brother suddenly decided to sing a song he wrote and happened to be near pitch-perfect and could play piano a hella lot better than me. Long story short, 2 years later I gave up on it because everyone was into his stuff more and I felt left in the dust. He didn't mean to overshadow me- he was just doing what he enjoyed- and looking back I wish I would have kept going and would probably have been happy with what I did, but i was so frustrated that my little brother could just steal the show like he did. Life got busy and I forgot my passion. Now, 9 years later, I want to start sharing my music again. But in the back of my head all I can think is how he's got a band and making albums and playing out and I'll forever be labeled the sibling of so-and-so. I dont want to do it for approval or money anymore though-just because I love it and want to share. I guess my thoughts are do what you love because you love it. I never stopped writing- I just stopped sharing. And I stopped sharing only because I felt overshadowed. If it's a passion you'll stay with it regardless of who's watching. Maybe eventually you'll want to start sharing your stuff again or maybe not. But speaking from experience,  don't let the fear or frustration of being overshadowed get you down. I wish I had stuck with it until I decided to stop for the right reasons."

But I think a lot of that has to do with how spankings were handled in my family. It wasn't a parent just smacking me as soon as I did something bad. And it was never done while a parent was out of control angry.  It always went: bad thing done, parent reprimands me and tells me go to my room, parent cools off before entering room, we sit down on the bed and discuss what I did wrong and why it was wrong, parent then takes out the paddle and issues the spankings. It was never a first response- we would have chances to stop acting that way before parent resorted to spanking. Spanking was only used if we had done something that we absolutely without a doubt knew was wrong.


 I had friends growing up who would get spanked for the stupidest shit- and in front of people. And it always did and always will make me sick. I remember multiple times my friend handing her checked homework to her dad and him seeing a B as her grade and he spanked her right there in front of me. It was effed up."

When I stepped out of the car, I dropped my bag which caused my soup to pop open and soak the bag through. Instead of making a mess through the lobby and hallways,  I decided to suck it up and eat the sushi outside on the patio all by my lonesome as a group of fellow guests sat around the nearby firepit chatting. 


Now, I'm 5'5"" 135lb, but eat like I'm 6' 250lb. This particular evening I ordered myself the soup (which I still had half of), 2 apps of gyoza, and a platter of sushi, sashimi and sushi rolls that was meant to feed two. This $50 worth of food that I was had sitting in front of me. And you can bet your ass I ate every last bit of it. It was delish!
