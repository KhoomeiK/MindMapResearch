Thisismylifemeow,ff6kddq,t3_errm7b,1579629061.0,Looks like a kitty spaceship!
cats,ff6ay12,t1_ff67y7d,1579623206.0,Guess we can't blame the cat. Looks innocent.
morrissey,ff62881,t3_erjduw,1579617278.0,"When I lost a cat to a road accident years and years ago I must have played ""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"" a dozen times. RIP Dude."
morrissey,fein3nx,t3_ep64zr,1579142397.0,I love this song.
GolfGTI,fed731q,t1_feaap5d,1579001975.0,That's so dynamic!
watchcatsdieinside,fe8bdnu,t3_enwqox,1578924464.0,"Maybe seeing that it wasn't food, he did a quick r/Catculations and aborted the catch?"
GolfGTI,fe8a610,t1_fe73k6z,1578924126.0,Great shot! Would you mind sharing the other photo as a link? I'd love to see it.
blackcats,fdqwk5a,t1_fdquawe,1578675879.0,"I love it! One black kitty, one gray (that's my current household as well) and a Dane puppy diplomatically decked out in black and tan stripes and swirls. You're making me want another Dane!

I have such fond memories. One time one of my black cats was being chased into my backyard by a neighborhood cat. She ran over and stood by the Great Dane. That other cat probably set a land-speed record in its retreat. It must not have known much about Great Dane personality."
blackcats,fdq6c5o,t1_fdpbpod,1578656795.0,I had a Void named Pepper. She was a fascinating cat. Also the years I had black cats and a Great Dane were some of the best I've known. I'm sure they gave you memories to last a lifetime.
blackcats,fdl6u1u,t3_ely5re,1578518036.0,I have loving 9 month old black female kitten. I can confirm that this is a superior cuddle position. Ysabel would spend hours like this if she could.
aww,fdhvnvg,t3_elegoj,1578430976.0,"You're a saint. 

Adopting an old stray was one of the best gifts ever given to me by the universe. 

She showed up in my backyard in 2016 and was there every day while I built a garage out of wood from my family's old barn. I was at the time still heartbroken over the deaths (old age) of my previous two cats.

She taught me how to love again.

I had two glorious years with that cat and was so happy to give her a home and love."

IllegallySmolCats,fdhjebl,t3_elct96,1578423904.0,Thank you for putting her under house arrest.
cats,fdglb9w,t1_fdg5n0h,1578401164.0,Hi Toby!
cats,fdgl6ue,t1_fdfcl6w,1578401044.0,Wise cat.  Air is an important ingredient in successful biscuits but nobody ever lists it as an ingredient.
cats,fdept63,t3_eky0fl,1578344089.0,"Those are gonna be some good biscuits. Cathead biscuits are his preference, I assume?

P.S.: My Jasper says Hi to your Jasper. He has yet to learn such skills."
Catswithjobs,fddttgv,t3_ekvb7e,1578323805.0,I have coin! Need gem!
cats,fddrivz,t3_eksg1x,1578322091.0,I love the look in his eyes as he deals with the conflict of suspending his instincts in order to receive a greater pleasure.
bikewrench,fddqw99,t3_ekpqg5,1578321599.0,"With a cat in the shop, you've probably enjoyed the adventure of tracking down that screw you just sat down on the bench and now can't find. It's gonna be on the floor somewhere. It's called cat tax â€”  and you never know when it's going to be collected.

cats,fd9qh9x,t3_ekbln9,1578236690.0,I am always so happy for grown cats who get another opportunity to live well and lift the spirits of new hoomans.
blackcats,fcqgxvg,t3_eihfj8,1577885800.0,r/IllegallySmolCats is going to want to know the whereabouts of this small fluff. What an adorable kitten!
bmacSBDs,fckc9at,t3_dyl0ii,1577722079.0,"Would you upload 11/5 again?   
Much appreciated!"
Catswithjobs,fcjwqd4,t1_fcjcspp,1577708387.0,Yes too young and too smol for even a desk job.
cats,fbp85yh,t3_edyr1v,1577018549.0,"I have a gray boy and black girl and a reachable bag of Temptations. 

 This is the moment I realize that ""it could have been me."""
