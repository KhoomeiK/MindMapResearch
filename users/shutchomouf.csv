In other words, the President, VP, etc are other home owners voted in by property owners. It is common for these folks to hire management companies to perform much of the management at the direction of the HOA board. 

Some people might be surprised at the effect they can have on an HOA by simply getting involved by attending board meetings or volunteering for a position on the board. 

HOAs are also typically responsible for keeping financial records and meeting minutes. The recent history of records are usually required to be provided during escrow of a home purchase. Because HOA composition and quailty vary significantly, at a minimum its a  really good idea to read through the historical records for one you are considering moving into during the escrow period to get a very good sense of what sort of HOA situation you might be getting into."
