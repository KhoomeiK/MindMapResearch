AskReddit,ffar2x9,t3_esh49y,1579742508.0,"AI and to an alternate aspect, automated weapons.

Everybody likes to claim that this or that advancement is bringing us dangerously close to a Skynet type moment. As a robotics engineer...this just isn't true.

Will we eventually get to such a time? Sure we will, but that time is optimistically 50+ years away. We still have trouble getting a camera to recognize that a pen is in fact a pen and not a new object once you change the lighting of the room.

The real near-term danger of AI isn't really the AI per se, but unintelligent use of automation. Skynet won't be causing a human extinction war just to get rid of us, but automated reaction programs might cause a minor border scuffle to escalate out of hand before people realize what is going on. Imagine having an automated CIWS (close in weapon system) on the border of the Koreas. Someone pops off a mortar round from the north, or even more benignly, someone from the south sends up one of those balloons with moon pies (seriously, that's a thing) and the CIWS is in a high automation threat mode, it spots the object and fires at it. Systems on the other side spot all of these incoming rounds and reacts to handle them, which causes the other systems to react, and before you know it troops are rushing to their tanks and artillery as what appears to be a pitched battle rages.

You didn't need AI to make that happen, just simplistic automation. To clarify, an AI is a computerized system that attempts to examine and learn from the environment whereas an automated system isn't one that ever changes, it just has a state machine ""If I see an incoming object, shoot. If not, don't."" and has no capacity to adjust its programming based on experience. That's not a great description, but it gives you an idea.

To use a more human oriented example. In the Cold War there were numerous instances of times where an equivalent to this almost triggered a nuclear exchange. Humans receiving data from instruments, then refusing to take the action they were required to take (which theoretically amounted to treason, as they were allowing an enemy nuclear strike to happen), which turned out to be the correct action. Some of the treaties between the US and the Soviet Union existed partly to try and make things take longer should someone decide to push the button (ex: the one that had everyone set their targets to ocean locations instead of keeping Moscow, DC, etc locked in.), because everyone was worried about shaving minutes off the response time, it left VERY little wiggle room for determining if something real was happening.

On the topic of automated weapons however, people are terrified of what happens when you pull humans away from aspects of warfare without realizing some simple truths. My automated tank will never fire on a crowd of innocents and claim ""I thought I saw a gun."" because the other day its fellow tank was destroyed from an IED and was wanting revenge. If the tank DOES fire on a crowd of innocents, its reasoning will be 100% logged and can be retraced by a forensics team, determining the exact reason the tank did what it did. The lesson learned from that event can then be corrected in software (or possibly hardware) and then near-instantly the entire fleet of tanks is updated such that the particular corner case won't ever happen again. With humans, the incident will result in yet another training class that will slowly be rolled out to the current soldiers over the course of several years, with no guarantee that it's going to do anything at all.

Much like self-driving cars, the automated weapons system DOES NOT NEED TO BE PERFECT. It just needs to be better than a human. Lets say an accident means that the automated weapons system results in 1 unnecessary death per year, compared with (a completely made up statistic) 100 unnecessary deaths per year from humans. Does the fact that we still have ONE incident mean we shouldn't replace humans? No.

What's better, in theory if you set things up right, each incident an actually be checked against a human. Take the logged kill data and the telemetry leading up to the incident, craft a virtual reality simulation, and have a hundred soldiers run through it. If the average soldier would fire, then you've demonstrated the hardware is merely as bad as a human. If the average soldier would NOT fire, then you know you need improvements. In particular, you can now tweak the simulation in order to try and determine what triggered the humans to not fire (or if reversing things, what caused us to fire when the robot didn't) and use those lessons to generate new algorithms to improve the robots, which can again be instantly updated fleet-wide.

Should humans be totally brought out of the loop? Certainly not. There's far too much potential for abuse, both internally and externally (ex: an enemy nation hacks the tanks, or a commander directs his tanks into doing something they shouldn't.), but we shouldn't be AFRAID of this technology, not when it can improve a lot of problematic areas. Humans are going to wage war on each other. It's sad, but it's true. The tactical and strategic advantages of automated weapons are, without overstatement, as massive as the difference between a nuclear armed nation and one without nukes. They WILL be built. You can create all the laws and treaties you want, but unlike nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, there is ZERO giveaway that these devices are being constructed. A microcontroller could be bought for use running a water pump...or for running the servomotor on a robotic tank turret. You can't tell just by looking at the purchases. Coding environments have no giveaway as to what is being worked on without access to the codebase being developed.

These devices WILL be created, there's no stopping it. What we CAN do is mandate via treaties and such, specific methods of improvement that require people to make the devices better and more effective...which can help avoid a lot of the problems we are afraid of.

Granted, there's eternally the issue of ""What if the leader uses them improperly."" but this has been an issue with armed forces going back to the times of Caesar and is more a matter for individual countries to decide than a global mandate of humanity (which, strictly speaking would decide that we just shouldn't have any and should work together. But sans a world-government, that will never happen.).

And just to head off the idea of Asimov's 3 laws, unfortunately automation doesn't really work that way. You would outright need to have a nearly-sentient machine just to make those work...a nearly-sentient machine which is now also a slave incidentally.

tldr: AI development is NOWHERE near the point of accidentally making a self aware system to kill us all. The risk is purely in how we decide to use the system, not the system itself. Similarly, Automated Weapons WILL be built, we shouldn't foolishly try to stop this, we should instead mandate specific methods of improving them which will help avoid the real problems with their use. (No army wants to waste bullets on false targets. If the civilians are not your targets, then everybody wants to make their systems better at not shooting them. If they are your targets...well, that's a problem with your government and not the robots.)."
news,ffann7m,t1_ff9hozh,1579740196.0,"Strictly speaking an HOA exists to act as a collective for various services the neighborhood needs, all towards the end of maintaining the value of the neighborhood.

Effectively, you don't have the value-lowering aspect of someone who refuses to cut their yard excepting for the legally mandated minimum of care, simply because the HOA pays for (using the dues you agree to pay as part of the act of purchasing the house) a lawn care service that will do it for you.

There can be other cases as well. In the HOA my dad used to manage, the neighborhood was coming up on the time it needed to redo the roofing shingles. Two of the members were demanding that the cheapest option be used because they were planning to sell their homes in the next year or two and so they wouldn't see the benefit of the more expensive ~20-25 year roof ratings (which are necessary in this area of high winds, roofs last a lot shorter than the ratings suggest). He enforced that the purpose of the HOA was to protect the value of the neighborhood as a whole, which doesn't mean making it cheaper for someone that's intending to dump and run. Granted, he had the support of the majority of voting households, but it's the sort of issue that an HOA exists to handle, partly because an entire neighborhood getting a quote for roofing can end up getting a cheaper per-home quote than if each home did things on their own.

Now, all that said, an HOA has a LOT of room for bullshit to happen. My dad was ousted as the head of the HOA...because one person was creating a huge amount of bullshit over the fact that the one house that didn't happen to have a deck, which necessitates an enclosing safety fence, enclosed their porch using the same materials our gardeners use to secure our plants from the wildlife. For five years or so, every meeting had this person screaming about how terrible and unfair it was that this person was ""claiming communal land for personal use""...even though the porch is legally their land. So they conspired and did all this stuff to get a vote to have dad replaced. Then they got their way, declared the person has to take down the gardening fence...and now wants my dad to take it back over because they don't want to do any of the other duties. Fun response? My dad's like ""Nope, you said you could do it better in the face of my 'gross mismanagement of HOA resources', so I refuse a nomination to the post."" and since nobody else wants it, the guy is stuck with it.

They literally wanted control just to force someone to make it so that if this person WANTS to, they can go up and sit on a neighbors porch and use it for their own purposes...even though the person can legally cite them for trespassing for doing so. They didn't actually think they could do it better or even want to do the job, they just didn't like that this other person was preventing other people from using their porch as was their legal right."

gamedev,ff8ezem,t3_es7uxz,1579675626.0,"Both Unreal and Unity have their strengths and weaknesses.

In the gaming industry for larger companies, you have a tendency towards C++ use, which coincides nicely with Unreal. Unreal is ""more powerful"" in that C++ has less inefficiencies than C#, but in no way is this a serious problem with C#. You can do outstanding things with both and a great many video games do not need to eek out that extra tiny bit of performance that C++ provides.

Indie studios generally, but not always, tend towards Unity because with a few exceptions (namely, two people cannot work in the same scene at the same time), Unity is a bit easier to develop in as a small team. It's Inspector window also makes certain aspects of game development a LOT easier (linking disparate aspects of the program together without necessarily needing to screw around with singletons or information calls that crawl all through the program).

There also is the appearance that Unity has a lot more support in the form of YouTube/Web tutorials than Unreal, but how applicable this is to anybody is on a case-by-case basis for what it is you are looking to do.

As a programmer that's been doing it for a few years, switching back and forth between C++/C# isn't that hard for me to do, but it could be confusing in your early days of coding, so for that reason alone it MIGHT be better to stick with Unreal. The only caution I'll give you is that you shouldn't get too drawn into the Blueprints. They are nice, convenient, and entire games have been made using them, but they are supposed to be an aid, not the entire structure of your game.

Good luck!"

You are going to be looking at a sealant of some type to get that.

The wax variant isn't perfect either because any real jostling and the seal will break, improper storage conditions can result in it melting or having other issues. Largely you can fix that by simply having a LOT of wax...but at that point you are probably adding enough mass to the product that the increased carbon-cost of shipping it around has undone the progress gained in saving on plastic.

Mission Control cares.

If somehow there's an eruption of smoke from the rocket and yet telemetry datalinks are still active, then this means there's something they can do. That might simply be to send a manual abort command (which for unmanned rockets would detonate whatever remains of the fuel supplies up high, potentially preventing dangerous concentrations of things like Hydrazine on the ground). It might mean something else which is still recoverable to some extent. If the first stage detonated during stage-separation, the second stage might be automatically recovering and the loss of telemetry is simply due to the shock causing the on-board radios to lose their necessary orientation to the normal transceivers. The call of LoS will definitely result in one of the Mission Control people working to try and use other means to reestablish signal in the hopes that this is the case.

> What are you going to do with that data? Nothing.

Figure out what went wrong. Yes, you have the telemetry data leading up to the moment of the incident, but as long as the telemetry stream is continuing the data can help post-incident analysis. For example, if one of the engines ruptured in such a way that it produced the requisite cloud while the others are firing (and before you say that there's no way this could happen, this happened on [CRS-1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvTIh96otDw) and the rocket was still able to complete it's mission with one engine having literally exploded in flight), you will be able to tell that this was the case (and likely even WHY it happened based on what systems are still reporting from the wreckage of that engine).

> They literally just announce the loss of telemetry because they feel like it.

Incorrect.

They say it because it is part of a rather thick book of procedures covering all sorts of situations. Once LoS is declared, it triggers all sorts of events in mission control. Attempts at secondary and tertiary communications. Contact with down-range vessels/aircraft to determine if there is any debris siting. Verification that data recorders are active. The ""lock the doors"" order is given to prevent anyone from leaving for a variety of purposes (shift changes can result in lost information, maybe this was an act of sabotage, etc).

So in short, there's EVERY reason to announce it."

Chairbound also runs into the problem that while there IS a difference between sitting at a keyboard and mouse and using a VR rig, it makes the cost of upgrade to VR a little less palatable for many consumers.

One day we will have a hardware solution, like the Virtuix Omni, where the user can stand in one place and walk/run/jump and such, but...like the VO, they are EXPENSIVE. Frequently dwarfing the cost of the rest of the VR rig. When I bought my VO from the Kickstarter, it was like ~$800. It is now expensive enough, particularly when including shipping (which was like ~$250 more), that they no longer sell to individuals but businesses."

spacex,fepv3qb,t1_feot6b4,1579332377.0,"While you do raise a fair point about super heavy lift compared with other systems, I think part of what people are getting at is that in a fairly big way, the number of lesser launches you get for the same amount of money so wildly exceeds the capabilities of the system that is being designed that it would have been a cheaper engineering problem to have instead designed your cargoes to be lifted up in smaller batches and assembled in orbit by robots or crew.

Based on the chart, if NASA were to have instead of building the SLS, reimbursed SpaceX for the F9 costs and then bought F9 costs, they would have been able to launch something approximating ~170 SLS launches worth of mass into space (taking into account the development of Orion and related items as well), and that's before any money was spent actually launching the SLS (which is estimated at somewhere around 1.2B per launch).

And since the non-Orion cargoes the SLS is meant to launch haven't even been designed yet, I believe the proposals are still open for the Artemis Gateway Station and such, there's no real reason they couldn't have just had the system designed to have been launched in smaller pieces than already (the SLS is expected to need several launches to get the AGS and such up there and assembled)."

Specifically, there are 32 states (and the District of Columbia) that have rules regarding how their electors must vote based on the popular votes of their citizens. Some mandate winner-take-all, others mandate proportional, etc.

This case exists to determine if a state can punish its own electors for ignoring those rules and voting however they want.

If they decide that no, you cannot punish your electors for violating laws you've passed regarding your internal elections, then there are not ~130M people voting. There are 538 people voting.

worldnews,feptea1,t1_fepi5cm,1579330637.0,"As an American, all things considered WW2 wasn't really that bad of a time over here compared to pretty much everywhere else.

When German U-boat captains surfaced near NYC and other locations to attack shipping, they were confused that we weren't even taking the slightest of sensible precautions despite being involved in a two-front war.

All things considered, life was considerably improved for the average person in WW2 when compared with the Great Depression previously. If you want to go by just deaths, the US is estimated to have given ~405,000 lives during WW2. Meanwhile some estimates claim that 7 MILLION people died in the Great Depression due to malnutrition and such.

todayilearned,fej9hec,t1_fej8xjg,1579162764.0,"Ultimately those are engineering questions that can spiral out of control as far as I understand it.

If you've got an infinitely long wing and you can move it forward, you'd generate infinite lift, but you'd also have infinite weight.

Quite frequently altitude (you are just moving ""forward"" without doing something like rising straight up) is determined entirely by speed, but not all planes are created equal. That faster a specific plane goes in level flight, the higher it will climb. Take the same plane and give it smaller wings that weighed the same as the larger wings, it will now need to move faster to get to the same altitudes as before. Conversely, weight ends up being extremely important. If you can suddenly slice out half the weight of a plane and change nothing else about it, the plane will fly higher.

The U2 has flown to ~73,000 ft weighing ~30,000 lbs and the SR-71 has reached 85,068 ft weighing at most 172,000 lbs. How can the Blackbird reach higher despite weighing several times as much? It moved faster. The U2's max speed was Mach ~0.538, the Blackbird's max speed was Mach ~3.32.

Long story short, the design of your aircraft is going to influence your flight characteristics, so in the case of the Karman line, I believe they use a somewhat idealized craft design, but I'm not 100% sure on that."

Strictly speaking Trump has done tons of things that are impeachment worthy, even if you ignore the catch-all clause that grants the actual ability to impeach for no reason whatsoever, but the punishment system was designed with the expectation that Congress and the President would always be in a fight, not that a majority Congress would approve of the President breaking the law.

Knowing the stats of the truck told them its weight and load bearing capacity, knowing the spaces the thing could move through established an absolute maximum size of the radar mounted in the back, and the depths of the depressions told them how heavy the truck must have been which told them the weight of the radar system.

All that pieced together gave them a rough idea of basically how ""dense"" the system was, and with a fair idea already of this from other radars they'd seen they were able to calculate an estimated set of radar specs that we were told were within 1% or so of the real specs of the system.

These miners, what would it gain them to camp out with guns? Nothing more than they have right now, and a whole lot of risk that now they can be put into a LOT of trouble even if things go their way.

And quite frequently gun owners are similar. They don't care about what the government does to anybody else, so long as THEY are unimpacted. For years whenever anybody, face to face or online, says they have a gun to protect against the government, I ask them the same question. ""Under what exact circumstances would you actually use your gun against the government?"". And I've gotten exactly two types of answers, if I get one at all. The first is ""I'll use my gun against them if they come for my gun."", which is cyclic and self serving.
