Anything north of that is to dangerous for a machine not going in anything but a straight line.  Of course speed records have exceeded the GT40. \~760 mph. That's just not doable on an asphalt course.  You can only go so fast and still be maneuverable--it was just figured out pretty soon in the 60's that's all. Safer road course construction, safer cockpits and braking systems allow for a bit more speed like in the Bugatti. Still need to be a professional quality driver to achieve it safely."

todayilearned,fckgw06,t3_ehale4,1577725054.0,"Most forefathers followed the reason-religion of Deism. Popular among the educated at the time. Reason of man dictates over the revelations of men's imaginings. Although they also had their whacky concepts. Reason didn't coincide with the scientific method. So they conjectured about ""Nature"" in many incorrect ways. Poor man's logic.  It soon fell out of favor. It's not for the masses. They desired the magic and ceremony."
