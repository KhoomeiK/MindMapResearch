GenderCritical,ff9vnbi,t1_ff9valw,1579722496.0,I don't bring gender into it. Whether they're a cow or a bull they end up same place. Abused. Weird that u eat dairy considering its enslaving females of another species. It's literally breast milk
GenderCritical,ff9tajw,t1_ff9swrg,1579720791.0,I cba to read that but I'm gonna say I hope you don't think it is. It's purely about the animals. Us vegans hate this so much that people think veganism is about people. It's nothing to do with people. It's about the animals and equality

GenderCritical,fe55ivu,t1_fe53oea,1578865817.0,"No. Being ""ugly"" isn't a thing. It's an opinion, you can only THINK someone is ugly. It's not a state of being where u just accept it. It's an insult. End of. Don't call anybody ugly otherwise you're as bad as them calling you it. Don't forget men have feelings too, they aren't robots and calling them ugly can damage their confidence depending on the person. And tbh that's not a man woman thing that's an individual thing. If a man tries to be sexy and femenine and it ain't working... ppl will shade. Same thing w a woman."
GenderCritical,fe52wlc,t1_fe52f8x,1578865180.0,It's an insult!!! Oh my god. It's just about being kind in general like. I'm gonna make a wild guess that you're older than me since it's Reddit and say I can't believe I'm being more mature.
GenderCritical,fe114ox,t1_fe0ykxz,1578821356.0,"If their makeup is bad, fair dues. But you would give criticism. Not straight up call them ugly. Makes u just as bad"
GenderCritical,fdzp0mo,t1_fdzowz8,1578792633.0,"Regardless, they called people ugly.
That particular thing was for makeup and women aren't punished for wearing makeup now days"

socialanxiety,fdljbd8,t1_fdlihj0,1578525279.0,"I label it negative because it feels bad. So u label a negative emotion positive? And even tho thats true , they feel different. I was at work and I was anxious about the queue so I said in my head ""I'm not anxious for the queue I'm excited!"" Cause I saw a video by this man. But it still feels bad."

socialanxiety,fdlatxe,t1_fdlae9k,1578520091.0,"Thing is I have a job and my social anxiety there is pretty much gone unless something stressful happens. That's gotten better and I'm not really scared. 

But in college everyone's made their friends, they're going about their day w their group. It would seem odd for a stranger to randomly approach them. I know I'd be so confused"
socialanxiety,fdl46x4,t1_fdkla3c,1578516756.0,"I smiled and said hi to two girls a while back and they just looked confused, turned to each other ""who is she"" ""idk but she said hi to me??"" And laughed :( it was mortifying. I can't approach people that are already friends together."
socialanxiety,fdkguq7,t1_fdkgn0w,1578503594.0,"I'm too sensitive as a person. Usually when you know someone and are very close, you might say ""shut up"" or insult them. And cause Ur so close u know it's a joke. 
Whereas they're straight up like that from first meeting. They're so overly outgoing. They ENJOY giving presentations if that gives u an idea.

Also idk how id be apart of their group outside class. They'd just separate from me as soon as we leave. How can I say ""hey I have no friends can I join"". 

And bare in mind everyone has about 4 lessons a day. I have one or two. I'm alone regardless"
socialanxiety,fdkg81m,t1_fdkfths,1578503210.0,"I don't know how to though. I'd be meeting new people in the new one too, my old friend has a group I'd meet. 

I just don't mesh with the extroverted loud girls in my class"

insomnia,fdbk0ud,t3_egkjg5,1578258140.0,Agreed. They don't realise some of us go to work on hour 39 of being awake. They don't know the cycles of feeling dizzy and sick to having jitters and adrenaline.
thanksimcured,fdbfwok,t3_ejphh0,1578257003.0,Did they know that when they commented?

lgbt,fcatklq,t1_fcater2,1577576342.0,The word doesn't describe the relationship though. If I call myself femme it doesn't describe the other person. So a bisexual woman that is with a man could still be femme as it describes her alone- who is queer
lgbt,fcat361,t1_fcasvmj,1577576067.0,Why tho. I thought femme just described one woman's self
lgbt,fcat0b3,t1_fcasvxt,1577576022.0,It's still women that love woman tho
lgbt,fcaspbi,t1_fcasjgv,1577575854.0,I've seen so many lesbians claiming bisexuals are stealing things from them by using the word femme and I find that ridiculous.
bisexual,fbmaa4p,t1_fbm9uiv,1576980823.0,She wishes he'd see it the same but it's sort of like 'what can u do' . She told me to slowly bring her name up and ease her into conversation. And I agree my safety is first but I'm saying I wouldn't get into a relationship if I wasn't out. Not shaming anyone that's my preference. I mean that would be cool w me tbhhh. But I don't think it'd be fair to her. Like keeping her a secret. My mum agrees
