opera,ffa7z83,t3_esbkyu,1579729653.0,"I recently got into Opera, too. Wasn’t really expecting to, just happened upon a performance of Massenet’s *Manon* and fell absolutely in love. I’d definitely go with that one. There’s a lovely audio recording from EMI, it’s the one starring Victoria de los Angeles, that I would really recommend. If you can get your hands on a copy of the Met’s recent production, that’s great, too. 

Someone already said this, but I second the recommendation of Berg’s *Wozzeck.* very interesting look at the psychology of the burdened worker with some really interesting music.

Can’t go wrong with Humperdinck’s *Hansel and Gretel,* and I was also a fan of *La Rondine* by Puccini."

EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff3ketn,t1_ff31v3x,1579542927.0,"It’s not even if we want to show a film in more than one theatre. If the studio expects a movie to be big, they force us to buy multiple prints. For example, when the new Star Wars came out, they wanted a start time each hour. We have 8 theatres and had to dedicate four of them to Star Wars to meet the compliance. That means four prints of the film, and we weren’t able to show movies in those theatres which is hurting the other movies. Then the studios of those movies get upset and it’s all just one big expensive suck fest."
EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff31v0h,t1_ff31hwz,1579531478.0,"I wish. I wish this so much. I’ve worked at busier AMCs quite often and I really wish we were more like them. Since we have generally low attendance, people feel more at liberty to make a big mess. We also have more shenanigans because people feel they can get away with it. I think the most disrespectful thing we’ve had happen would either be people who turn full drink cups upside down and then break the edges of the lids so they fall off when you pick up the cup, or these dumb-a kids who snuck cupcakes in and left them upside down in the cup holders as a “prank.”"
EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff314yj,t1_ff30ojz,1579530896.0,"Not that anyone asked, this is just a cool sort of fact, I guess, but there’s a common misconception that movie theatres don’t make money off of tickets. I’d say probably 90% of the people we catch sneaking into movies use this as an excuse. We do make money, it’s just not profit. We have to purchase prints of the movies we get, and the ticket prices go towards paying off that large sum, usually a couple grand. After we hit that mark, then the majority of the money goes back to the studio, yes, but we still keep a small portion of the ticket to cover payroll and the electricity used to run the films. When determining which theatres get what films, studios look at attendance records to determine if they think the theatre can pay back the cost of the print. It kind of sucks because some studios usually force us to buy multiple prints (one print per auditorium) of a single film, which can really hurt us if attendances are down for that specific film."
EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff30kas,t1_ff304ze,1579530432.0,"Actually it’s the studios. While my boss does make the show schedule, the studios have different requirements for showtimes which can get really difficult to work around at times when more than one studio has a big release."
EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff2exav,t1_ff2d4ad,1579503291.0,"Crawfordsville, though they often send me to Perry Crossing, Castleton and one time up to the Dine-In in Chicago. What about you?"
EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff2ev3q,t3_er2h02,1579503221.0,"We’re an AMC classic with no reserved seating, and when big movies come out, we usually have people showing up before the last movies are even over. The worst is when people are impatient and fill the hallway so it’s hard for people in past movies to leave. Then we have to deal with them going into the theatre before we can clean it, which sucks because they always complain about the mess."
assholedesign,ff2czga,t1_ff2bwlz,1579501184.0,"Ads can get really ridiculous sometimes. I grew up in a very Christian part of Indiana and for some reason, Planned Parenthood decided to geolocate their ads to our area. Let’s just say that the backlash wasn’t pretty."
assholedesign,ff2btvh,t3_er906x,1579500009.0,"I think this is just one of those situations where they paid for heavy advertisement in certain areas (including yours) and hope that the constant bombardment of your home page will sway your opinion. Unfortunately for them, the lack of respect for your privacy (you blocking them and then them forcing the ad back onto your home page) likely turns you off of him more the more you see it. Really wish we could find a better way to advertise, but you think they’d realize that if you block an ad, forcing you to keep seeing it is a bad move."
EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff29t52,t1_ff236fa,1579498067.0,"With the exception of emergencies and people misbehaving, we’re really not allowed to ask people to leave. I’ve worked here for a few years and the only exception I’ve seen is when *Joker* came out. The first few days, we had so many people complaining that they stayed for the entire credits for nothing that our DO told us we could inform people when they bought tickets that there wasn’t anything at the end."
EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff22r4w,t1_ff225zc,1579492221.0,"On behalf of all theatre workers, we hate you. Seriously though, ever since the Marvel movies popularized the use of an after-credits scene, it’s become incredibly common for people to wait until the end of the credits. It makes it hard on us because we’re usually not allowed to clean until the theatre is empty and don’t have much time. When people wait until the end in a busy show, it’s really hard to fully clean by the time people start coming in for the next show. It’s also really hard to get the job done when people come really early for a movie."

As a man who was dragged an entire year through a relationship where my partner was secretly considering breaking up with me for another guy, I can tell you wholeheartedly that it sucks to be put through that. I only found out because her best friend showed me her fake Instagram account one day which was filled with a year full of “I love him, but I really don’t think I have a future with him” while she’d turn around and act like everything’s fine when she was with me. I gave up so many opportunities to work elsewhere because I didn’t want to be too far from her, I started considering marriage, all to find out that she had no plans for us for the future.

People are being taught from a young age to raise their own self-worth above realistic expectations. While you definitely should know not to cut yourself short, a quick look around today will show you so many people who are so certain of ability they don’t have that they’re willing to make your life a living hell if you don’t acknowledge the person on the level they do. I worked as a hiring manager for a brief period in my life and the sheer amount of people (and to be honest, it was mostly young white females, though not always) who were OBVIOUSLY the less qualified choice who came back into my office after learning of their rejection, claiming some sort of bias or prejudice. My response was always and (if the need ever rises again) will always be to sit the person down with their resume and discuss what areas they can improve on.
