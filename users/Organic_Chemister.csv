The 37% of our population who wouldn’t care if he stabbed a baby with a pitchfork couldn’t care less but if there isn’t a real trial with witnesses what slim chance Trump has to not be seen for all time as Nixon II or worse, and all the Republicans who helped him escape justice along with him, is up in smoke. 

FYI I posted that very reasonable idea on r/trump and my post was quickly deleted.   Last thing they want to hear is a realistic, nonpartisan perspective on the legacy of their poor, failing hero."

Tweeting about how unfair it is isn’t enough to save Trump from a legacy of shame which is virtually guaranteed unless they let all witnesses be examined and bring Trump into the Senate to face his accusers and tell his side.  It’s about history.   However, Trump doesn’t seem to know much about history and as a result how he looks in the history books isn’t that important to him.
