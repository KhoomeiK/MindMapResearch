korea,fem6cu7,t3_epsmql,1579241332.0,"We have this weird culture of ""you go I go, I go you go"" type of together thing that's pretty dominant in almost everything. You go to the movies, you must bring a friend. You want to go somewhere? Get a companion or you'll embarrass yourself for some reason. You eating? Well too bad it's a crime to eat alone around these parts.

It's okay if you guys are close friends but when this manifests to people who are not either friendly or hostile to anyone (basically the awkward zone), this can be a real awkward pain in the ass.

However I did notice the change recently as many young people started eating alone outside, and they even enjoy it. I hope more people in Korea find joy in eating in solitude from time to time, and not constrain themselves to this ""together always"" fad."
