depression,fecr0ht,t1_fecpq5c,1578981393.0,"It's difficult to see a future in which you'll be able to ""function"" when you're so deep in the pit (as I like to describe it). You mentioned that you are financially able to quit your job. If that's the case, spending some time focusing 100% on your health could be incredibly beneficial. Speaking from personal experience, I quit my job back in May and spent 7 months in an intesive DBT program which helped me get back on my feet. I am currently back working again and feeling stronger. 

Perhaps there are some mental health services in your area you can get connected with?"
AmItheAsshole,fecqewa,t3_eoh02y,1578980821.0,"NAH. It's your birthday and you can make the choice as to what you want to do to celebrate. At the same time, I see where your wife is coming from. It sounds like you do a lot for her and she wants to do the same for you. Perhaps you two could reach a compromise, that way she can do something for you but it won't be out of your comfort zone."
depression,fecpg6q,t3_eogw8b,1578979955.0,I'm really sorry you're struggling. Does your job have the option to take stress leave or short-term disability? I've had to do this and usually all it requires is a doctors note. It would give you some time to take care of yourself and do what you need to do to build up your strength.
depression,feajzlc,t3_eo6mab,1578949732.0,"I had a very similar thing happen to me last year. I got full-time at a job I had been working at for 3 years. 1 month later, I had to take short term disability because of my mental health for 2 weeks. 4 months later, I had to take 1 month off. I ended up leaving that job shortly after. 
I had the exact same anxieties ""what will people think of me?"" ""Am I being judged?"". Eventually I realized that taking time to make sure I was healthy was WAY more important than any job or what anyone else thought of me. Your mental health and health in general ALWAYS comes first."
depression,feai5zn,t3_eo9u9v,1578949042.0,"As a former addict, I can say from experience your brother is desperate and will stop at nothing to get what he needs. If you ever feel you are in harms way, never hesitate to call the police to come remove him for your safety. 

I agree with the previous comment about telling an adult you trust; a teacher, counselor, community member. This is an issue that no one should be dealing with alone, let alone a teenager. Best of luck to you. Stay safe"
depression,fe8w2gf,t1_fe8obzk,1578931654.0,"Oddly enough, it helps a little knowing that somewhere out there, there are people who can relate to me. Thanks"
depression,fe8vyrx,t1_fe8ro04,1578931595.0,"I appreciate that I'm not alone in feeling this way. I know people say that people only put the good things about their lives on social media and hide the bad - but at this point, I have no ""good"" to share."
depression,fe6g3j9,t3_eny188,1578889844.0,Thank you for sharing. You're obviously going through so much and it must be quite overwhelming. You're wanted here ðŸ’œ
depression,fe6fw59,t3_enyh4f,1578889668.0,Some people just love to feel helpful in the moment but have nothing to offer futher than that.
depression,fe6ffzs,t3_enx6ff,1578889292.0,"I binge watch the same shows over and over again to help distract myself from my intrusive thoughts. It's gotten to the point where I can't do menial tasks (laundry, washing my face, brushing my teeth etc.) without having some sort of show on.

When I was with my last partner of 5 years, he had school age children and instead of spending time with them in the last year of the relationship, I would hide in the bedroom and just watch TV. It was easier than exposing them to how depressed I really was. I regret that to this day."
AskReddit,fe3a15g,t3_enpnrf,1578847361.0,"Start with small goals that are easily achievable. When you try to focus on the big stuff, it's easy to get overwhelmed and psych yourself out. Small goals can inevitably lead to larger change!"

TrueOffMyChest,fdhmkef,t3_elam6b,1578425828.0,"He's not your responsibility. The fact that he hasn't made any arrangements all while knowing that this day was coming just shows that he has been taking advantage of you. You'd be doing him no favours by enabling him by letting him stay with you longer. It's time for him to stand on his own two feet, and if that means him having to stay at a shelter or outside, so be it. Sounds like he may need a good ol' shock to the system to get his ass in gear."

abortion,fd9wesi,t3_ekdp60,1578238814.0,"I got mine 10 weeks after surgical. During the ten weeks, I kept getting sporadic spotting which I kept thinking was my period starting but never was. It was really nerve wracking, waiting for it but it did eventually came.

Edit: also, this is the longest, and one of the heaviest/ painful periods I've ever had. Usually mine are over in 3-5 days. This is day 5 and it's still just as heavy as day 1."
