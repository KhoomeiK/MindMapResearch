apexlegends,fe9q03b,t1_fe9h5un,1578940400.0,"Just because you say it's a fact, doesn't mean it is. I'm not sure what your super defensive and and belittling attitude is all about, but maybe chill out a bit?

You can absolutely get better at the game while playing against players less skilled than you. Ever heard of target practice?

Who hurt you and your ego?"
apexlegends,fe9nhlx,t3_eo7fre,1578939752.0,"The only caustic issue I want to see resolved is the gas slowing down teammates. My buddy uses caustic as main and I use bang. I shutter when he starts throwing canisters everywhere causing me to crawl around painstakingly.

Then again, this might make him even more op than he is... 

To the original remark. I don't think his smoke density and opacity is an issue."

apexlegends,fe9ksp6,t1_fe9jpbd,1578938745.0,"I can see your point there but I also see where making things balanced becomes a big issue. In my case I'm setting the curve way too high for my teammates. But in random match making, a team of top tier players will wreck anything but other full experienced teams."
apexlegends,fe9c7fm,t1_fe9anmm,1578936267.0,"With my alt account that will work. With my regular account he will get sploded with the swiftness! Unless we glitch the lobby, but that's kinda back to the original issue. 

Fortunately he's getting better and we just drop hot every time. It's working but dang it's painful lol"
apexlegends,fe9bpyp,t1_fe9afoq,1578936120.0,"Yeah. Never done an alt before. I venture some people do it a lot and that would certainly cause problems. We've bumped into a few others in these lower tier lobies, even whole squads that are pretty obviously cheesing the matchmaking. 

I am going to have to handicap myself though. Wrecking the fun for all the noobs isn't what I get off on."
apexlegends,fe98xw7,t3_eo2z52,1578935473.0,Teaming became a big problem when I was playing PUBGMobile. Clans would have 4-6 teams in a map at times. I agree fully that bans would be appropriate for this.
apexlegends,fe97tbt,t1_fe96giz,1578935122.0,"Didn't mean to sound as though there are no issues. I've experienced the same. I buddy up with a guy that is a Predetor from time to time and WOW the lobbies are ridiculous, like 30k kills for the winning team. 

I think my alt is a level 8 or 10 now and we're already playing in matches with 2k kill winning teams and aggressive play styles. It was nice to see the game account for my KD and damage averages rather than just rank. Not so good for my brother though. Might have to start playing no armor and p2020 or something :)"

AskReddit,fde1udo,t1_fdcupn0,1578329285.0,"Man, I got involved with this year's back. I was doing real estate investments at the time so it seemed like a good fit. Total scam. Everyone lied about their income. Products were sold that had zero chance of improving client's financial well being. SEC rules were loosely followed and I ended up leaving when my up stream convinced my aunt to ""invest"" money she did not have I to a cash fire every month against my repeated warnings to her not to invest and my upstream to cease. 

Blood suckers the lot of them. I felt horrible for getting people involved in that. I had 7 down stream when I called them all and convinced them to leave with me.

Embarrassing times!

Edit: sec accronym was wrong"
