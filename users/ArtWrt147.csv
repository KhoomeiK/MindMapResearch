But the problem is, when they'd have to make an algorithm for those rare cases, they'd have to there and then decide which life the car must choose over the other.

In other words, where human makes an instant decision ""in a moment"", car must be thought which life is worth to save, and which can be lost. That's not a decision anyone has a right to make, but someone might have to. Who? The programmer? The company? Government, judge, president, who could make that call?

harrypotter,ff4m7yv,t1_ff4ktmi,1579567005.0,"Brown was supposedly to mean ""tanned"" and she's also described as turning pink. White person can easily be pale, tanned and flushed. Kinda hard to do when you're black. Also kinda weird to describe several minor characters as black, yet leave it for your main character. Also kinda weird to literally sketch the character being white and then claiming she could be black. That was a lie."
harrypotter,ff4lrr4,t1_ff4kg6o,1579566691.0,"There are dozens of little moments that point out to Hermione being white. She turns pink few times - feat impossible for someone with black skin. She's also described as being tanned - when was the last time you noticed a tan on a black person? Also, there are black students - we know this bc Rowling specifically mentioned them being black. But she didn't for Hermione. Maybe bc she never thought of her as black? Bc she definitely didn't when she drew sketches, where Hermione is clearly white.

Those are retcons bc they modify pre-existing work. They introduce changes to the narrative. Gay Dumbledore doesn't affect the story, but it does paint a character in a knew light - it modifies his parameters. To me, that's retcon, but I understand that under most uses for this word, it's not.

Hermione being black is, however, as retcon as it can get. And it's not an issue that they casted a black lady - she was chosen bc of her skill and that's fine. What's not fine is Rowling lying and insulting people that pointed it out."

Dumbledore being gay is not a change, bc it doesn't affect the story. Hermione being black is a change bc it contradicts what she wrote in the books. Both are retcons, the latter is just also conflicting."
harrypotter,ff4j61a,t1_ff4hy8c,1579564877.0,"Oh, the palm of stupidity must go to black Hermione thing.

Just to specify - I'm sure the actress was great, and she was chosen on base of her talent, which is a good decision. Don't know why they haven't specified they're looking for Caucasian actress, maybe they didn't care, maybe that was their plan - doesn't matter. That's really not a big deal for me, it could just as well be a retelling, sure - everyone expected a white Hermione mostly due to the movies I think, but it doesn't matter bc CC is shit anyway.

But Rowling handled it in the worst way imaginable, contradicting her own work, in other words, lying. She lied to the public to protect PC driven agenda. Calling people taking issues with misrepresentation of a known characters ""idiots"" or ""racists"" is not the best way to protect your retcon bullshit.
That's where I take issue. There'd be nothing wrong with black Hermione in the books, or on stage. But Rowling decided to just throw her own work out the window."
harrypotter,ff4hw7p,t1_ff4hhmy,1579564010.0,I can't give you a recent example. Bc I don't care about what she recently said.
harrypotter,ff4ha8y,t1_ff4ada3,1579563586.0,"You mean that in a way to suggest that books state that? Bc they don't.

Dumbledore being gay is just not important. It doesn't change the story, it's just a detail about a character we didn't knew before. So I don't really care.

But Hermione was clearly white. She can't be black. And there's nothing really wrong with that, bc there's nothing wrong with having white main characters. Just like there'd be nothing wrong if she was written as a black girl, bc obviously nobody would care (except for racist lunatics, but who gives a crap what they think?)"

Please, make more judgments on a person you know nothing about, that makes you look so smart and not condescending at all.

And I couldn't care less about what she's up to know. I just understand the anger that some people have towards her shenanigans. It's not a sign of a good writer to come retcon your own work. You either create a story you'll be proud off ten years later, or you accept the fact you might regret not writing something into your story. You can still expand upon it, but Twitter is not the way to do it. It's just disrespectful to your own story."
