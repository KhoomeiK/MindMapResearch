I have pushed back against every landlord I rented from and not a single rejection. Most landlords are accidental landlords who inherit property and don’t have the capital to keep the house in good repair or balance their own budget wisely. If they are willing to kick you out because they don’t want to improve the property leave before a fire breaks out. If they are to cheap to make repairs you point out imagine the ones you don’t point out. Due to fees being abolished you can always move without needing money saved up besides half a months pay for security. Some of the scare mongering on reddit is over blow. Before it was correct but since the fair housing act was passed in 2018 things have changed a lot. Now you can fight back against landlords using government guidance.

How about people who rent call their council and contact shelter. Take direct action against landlords. The fair housing act recently have given tenants way more power than before to take landlords to court and councils more push to sort things out. It worked out really well for me by reading shelter website and about rented housing on the government website. You have to keep pushing and fighting until they give in. If they increase your rent? - they were going to increase it anyway. It’s a business and has to keep up with inflation.
cambridge,fehmdts,t1_fehctpu,1579119482.0,No but it should give you more rights to have a say on how your city looks and what is a priority. If there is a clash point like traffic in this case then those who live in the city should have more say than those who live outside. Pedestrians and cyclist who live in the city should have a greater right over car drivers coming for a visit/work. Maybe the city should be re planned to avoid anyone going to the centre for business.

>Why do you think he was in Iraq

Quds forces have been fucking with America for 20 years. Why do you think a county like Iraq has been such a tough fight for USA? because Iraqi's are witty and nimble? no Iranians have been helping fuck with USA in Iraq for years by training and arming Shia milita. They want USA to stay in Iraq and drown. 

>prosperous nation again like it was before it was taken over by a fascist government.

Iran did have a prosperous government. In fact it was doing so well in nationalising the oil and resources the UK and USA killed their leader and installed a puppet Shah who brutalised the people with illegal killings. Then the Islamic revolution happened. Even the USA and UK historians agree the USA and UK went too far with the puppet Shah. They should have allowed Iran to become socialist and they would not have had this mess. 

>maintain your hatred of Trump.

Hillary Clinton would have kept American dominance. Trump is isolating America which in my mind is a great thing. The more isolation the better. What is not good is antagonising Iran. I support Trump because he exposes how strange it is for US troops to be based around the world. To bully others. I hope he wins in 2020.  

>It will still be Iran to be blamed.

Iran never attack directly. You won't know the truth if the USA isn't willing to fight a land war with Iran. It will be blamed on generic Terorrist and everyone will move on.

No because they already replaced him 24 hours after General Qassam was killed. The general wasn't going around middle east personally killing people with his own hands. The replacement could be more ruthless. 


>Iran's economy has completely tanked.

A strategy Obama put in place against Russians and Iranians seems to work. Blowing up people only creates Martyrs in the eyes of Iranians. 

They should have waited for the sanctions to play out. But now it's USA's turn to wait to see where the next boom will be. It might be a long wait or a short one. Who knows but Trump put himself in this position. He will have to own the consequences like Kissinger and Regan had to own the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings. 


>But yeah, sure, they own the middle east

Lebanon (Hezbollah), Syria, Yemen, Iraq (Shia majority) and Afgans (Taliban) have been armed to the teeth with iranian missles and wepons. They have been bleeding the USA resources in Iraq for 20 years. They happy to go for another 20. In a fucked up way the more USA pushes forward the more they lose like in Vietnam. The more they pull back the more the Iranians give them reason to stay in Iraq. The USA are trapped in a 'forever war' and have no chance of fighting Iran directly if Russia and China have any say which they do. Iran is winning."
