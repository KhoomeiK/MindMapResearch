The Macross Saga attempts to bring the Robotech license to the world of  shmups, but unfortunately it fails horribly. Although there are  horizontal scrolling levels for your ship to fly through, it can also  transform itself into a walking mech and opt for a run-n-gun style of  gameplay instead. Though this is a somewhat interesting concept, the  actual levels are overly long and filled with terribly boring enemies  who pose very little threat. Add to this mix music that sounds like it  was programmed for the original Game Boy and you have a very  underwhelming shooter as the result.

The performance impact for having a secondary display is negligible. I was worried about that, too, when I first hooked up my PC to the home theater, but I assure you that it won’t make your games run any worse, and it’s a much better solution than having to deal with audio delay issues.

I edited my original comment with some more information regarding how Windows operates when seeing two displays, even if one of those is your AVR. Hope it helps!

P.S.: Cloning your display can also present issues, since either resolutions or audio formats will be limited by the lowest common denominator.

If cloning your TV, Windows will only recognize two speakers (stereo audio). When cloning your AVR, you’ll most likely end up losing resolutions higher than 1080p, depending on the AVR (and it can also cause issues with framerates higher than 60 fps, not to mention VRR/G-Sync).

You could use a software like CRU and edit the TV’s or the AVR’s EDID to include the required information, but a much easier solution is to just extend your primary display to the secondary one, and position the latter accordingly, so that it doesn’t get in the way of your everyday use.

P.P.S.: I edited my original comment again because I said DVI, but I meant DisplayPort. DVI only carries video, while DP carries both video and audio."
nvidia,fegpngm,t3_ep2xdk,1579099563.0,"Yes. There are a few ways to do it:

1.	I believe that no 1080 Ti has more than one HDMI out, so you could use the HDMI port on your GPU to connect it directly to your TV, and a DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter to plug a second HDMI cable between the GPU (using one of its DP outs) and the receiver;
2.	If your motherboard has an HDMI out (most Intel chipsets offer integrated graphics), you could also use that for audio, connecting an HDMI cable between the GPU and the TV for video, and another HDMI cable between the mobo and the AVR for audio;
3.	Alternatively, you could use a single HDMI cable between the GPU and the TV, and enable ARC or eARC on both your TV and AVR, if they’re both compatible, so that the TV would send audio back to the AVR through its own, separate HDMI connection.

The problem with solution #1: 

Because of multiple HDMI and DisplayPort standards, there are multiple DP-to-HDMI adapters. For 5.1 audio, your AVR needs to be capable of receiving 1080p and HD audio through HDMI, so a DisplayPort 1.4 to HDMI 2.0b adapter is recommended. I’d strongly advise against using an adapter for video.

The problem with solution #2:

Separate audio drivers for Intel HD audio. Can cause issues with some codecs, and, particularly, Atmos (Atmos has been working correctly with Nvidia HD Audio drivers, can’t vouch for Intel). If going with that solution, you can use NVCleanInstall to select which components you want to install, and leave out the Nvidia HD audio drivers to avoid compatibility issues.

The problem with solution #3:

ARC and eARC are a mess. The former has issues with audio delay, and can only pass “standard” HD audio (no DTS:X or Atmos). eARC *can* pass those, but both your TV and AVR have to be compatible with it, and even then, depending on their models, eARC may not work at all (looking at you, LG and Denon).

Edit: When using two or more connections from your GPU, Windows will see the TV and AVR as two separate displays, so you’ll have to either clone or extend your main display. 

Make sure that the AVR is seen as the secondary display (it should have a large “2” on the visual representation of its screen), select 1080p as its resolution (for the appropriate HD audio formats to be enabled) and move it adjacent to one of the corners of the primary display, so your mouse cursor doesn’t disappear into the limbo when moving it past the borders of your screen."

Damnthatsinteresting,fe2ny6c,t1_fe0yx2p,1578841008.0,"Technically, “an episode of hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%/mo. for 30 consecutive days”, as described [in this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevehanke/2019/01/01/venezuelas-hyperinflation-hits-80000-per-year-in-2018/amp/).

Also, there’s a reason why the effects of inflation are so devastating: it‘s because wages never keep up with the increase in the cost of living.  

Hard to make anyone’s life easier when goods and services keep increasing in price (in Brazil, items in grocery stores would be marked up multiple times per day, by hand, with the use of [price tag machines](https://acervo.estadao.com.br/imagens/105x65/remarca_600.jpg))."

However, simply changing the nominal value of a country’s currency doesn’t solve its hyperinflation problem.

Brazil tried the same approach in the late ‘80s/early ‘90s, changing their currency a handful of times in the span of a few short years, without tackling the actual causes of inflation.

It was only after instituting a serious fiscal reform and stabilization program, that a new, definitive currency was introduced, in 1994, pegged to the US dollar. Because it was also accompanied by appropriate policies, inflation was brought down to single digit annual figures (down from more than 30 percent a month).

That currency has lasted to this day, even if it has suffered a major devaluation in the last 10-15 years, due to disastrous economic reforms by the previous administration and their involvement in billion-dollar corruption scandals (not unlike Venezuela).

The same party stayed in power for almost four terms (16 years), before being impeached for their crimes. That absolutely sunk Brazil’s economy, and the country’s only recently started to recover."

1. You've failed yet again to provide any actual sources backing up your claims.

3. Does the iPod Touch feature a click wheel? No? Oh, right. Also, its first generation was released in 2007. New thing is not new, and hasn't been new in years. The original iPod is from 2001!

Like I said, this is an attempt at r/fellowkids humor, not an anti-boomer comic. It's a boomer trying to act like they're ""in the know"", citing an iPod with a click wheel as some sort of revolutionary new device. Who even buys portable MP3 players nowadays? Spotify launched in 2008, ffs."

Not gonna argue about balding hipsters (even if hipster man buns [are literally making men bald](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3249155/Hipster-knots-making-men-BALD-Man-buns-place-extreme-tension-hair-roots-triggering-permanent-hair-loss.html)), since my main point is that the iPod is outdated tech, and has been for quite a while. Even if the comic was posted as early as 2015, as another user pointed out, only a boomer would consider the iPod (with the click wheel, as seen on the hands of the kid sitting by the window) as something that ""the kids"" are using.

Some people are mistaking the comic as “anti-boomer” likely because they’re so young that they’re not even aware of the vinyl resurgence, and assume that vinyl is somehow a newer invention than the iPod (thanks, again, to hipsters bringing it back).

It’s a boomer comic targeting millennials (as usual), that zoomers just don’t get."

I stopped watching Inside Gaming because they'd stretch news that could be presented in 3-5 minutes, tops, into 15 minutes videos, simply by delivering the same news three times (only worded differently each time).

For all its faults, I miss The Know, which would actually use those 10-15 minutes to deliver at least three **different** pieces of news.

And it's no surprise why they make those videos 10-15 minutes long. Veritasium explains [here](https://youtu.be/fHsa9DqmId8?t=840). Watch time is fundamental for a video to go viral. And the actual time that a video is watched by each person has to be about 7 or 8 minutes, which means that videos need to be longer (15 minutes) to reach an average of 7-8 minutes of watch time."

I’d read about monitoring programs being inaccurate, but since I always play games in full screen mode, it’s hard to monitor temps in real time through any other means (not sure where AB is getting the temps displayed by RTSS, though). 

I’ll try running the games at least in borderless windowed so that I can compare temps using HWiNFO64.

My fan curves are pretty similar to yours, with 65C being the threshold for 100% operation on most fans (four other ML 120 Pro RGB case fans; and four fans for my GPU’s AIO, in push-pull - 2x ML 120 Pro RGB and 2x stock Aorus RGB fans). The only difference is the AIO curve, which is based on the liquid’s temperature, as I mentioned. 

What software are you using to control your fans? And from which sensor/program are you picking up the CPU temperature?"
AMDHelp,fde4c2d,t1_fddx3ua,1578330887.0,"I’ll test with The Outer Worlds later and let you know how it goes. Are you also using AB/RTSS to monitor temps? Not sure if it’s an AMD thing or not, but temps are displayed as the same across all cores, even if voltages and frequencies vary. On Intel, temps were within 2-3C of each other, between cores (before and after the delid).

I’m using iCue to control fan speeds. I set up a custom fan curve, but it’s based on the liquid’s temperature, rather than the actual CPU. Because CPU temps fluctuate so much, if you were to base fan speeds on the package’s or any of the cores’ temps, the fans would be constantly winding up and down, which isn’t ideal for longevity or noise concerns.

Thanks for explaining the difference between “auto” and “normal”. That AMD rep recommended not to undervolt, as it could impact performance, so I’m avoiding doing that, unless there’s really no other way to get those temps down."

There are people who swear it’s planned obsolescence by Nvidia, while others try to dismiss those claims as conspiracy theories. 

Regardless of what side you’re on, until very recently, I still had a 1080 Ti, and for the longest time, I remained on pre-Turing drivers, as they did deliver improved performance. 

This is my anecdotal experience, and I can’t speak for others."
AMDHelp,fdd48tn,t1_fdcabjt,1578294124.0,"Thanks for answering. A couple of other users also shared u/AMD_Robert’s post regarding idle voltages, and that helped me to better understand what exactly’s going on, although I still find the temperatures to be a bit high.

I haven’t done any benchmarking, but I was playing RDR2 (in 4K, with a 2080 Ti) and keeping a close eye on the temps (using MSI AB and RTSS to monitor them). They seemed to never drop below 65C, occasionally rising to 70-75C, and sometimes, even upwards of 80C!

Like I said, my OC’ed 7700K (4.9GHz), pre-delid, never went above 65C in games (always in high resolutions, so not pushing the CPU that hard) - and that was with a less capable cooler and smaller rad (280mm, versus 360mm).

Most documentation and videos that I can find are from around the time of Ryzen 3’s launch, and they’re not very helpful, since Ryzen 3 had many issues that were later fixed with updates to the BIOS, chipset drivers and even Windows.

Hard to tell what are normal temps for that CPU, nowadays. I’m also still trying to find out if I should use Ryzen’s “Balanced” or “High Performance” power modes. Any tips?

Finally, Robert mentioned that the XMP profile should only be enabled for testing. Is that still accurate? I thought that XMP should be enabled in definitive."

I thought that high voltages were detrimental to the CPU regardless of clock speeds? To me, it doesn't make sense to maintain such high voltages with 1-2% of CPU utilization, but, like I said, I'm not used to AMD.

Checking the idle core clocks, the majority of clocks seem to boost to 4.3GHz (8 or 10 at a time, of the total 12). The others shift between 3.460GHz and 3.775GHz. Again, kind of pointless when idling, no?"

I’ll copy and paste the same comment that I wrote on the extremist sub (which was also downvoted):

Kathleen Kennedy joined Lucasfilm [in June of 2012](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kathleen-kennedy-co-chair-lucasfilm-332171), as co-chair, right before George Lucas sold his company to Disney. By December of that year, the deal was done: Disney had acquired Lucasfilm, Lucas had stepped down, and Kennedy was now president.

As early as October of 2015, and even before *The Force Awakens* had been released, Kennedy discussed [the possibility of a female helmer](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/14/star-wars-new-female-character-extremely-significant-says-producer), in an interview with The Guardian. She was quoted as saying: “There’s nothing we’d like more than to find a female director for ‘Star Wars’”.

In that same interview, she also said that “the movie industry bore a responsibility to do something about making sure more women came through the pipeline”, and explained her reasons as to why she still hadn’t done anything about it by stating the following:

>It’s a lot to do with opportunity and there has to be a concerted effort to create the opportunity. Part of our job is to nurture talent. We need to not go to a filmmaker who’s done one movie and expect them to come in and do something the size of “Star Wars” without having an opportunity to find other movies they can do along the way.

A year later, in November of 2016, she reaffirmed her position [in an interview with Variety](https://variety.com/2016/film/features/star-wars-rogue-one-lucasfilm-jj-abrams-kathleen-kennedy-1201923806/). This is what she had to add:

>We want to make sure that when we bring a female director in to do “Star Wars,” they’re set up for success. They’re gigantic films, and you can’t come into them with essentially no experience.”

She got a lot of flack for that, and rightly so. That statement, as The Verge writer Kaitlyn Tiffany puts it, [is bullshit](https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/22/13717046/star-wars-disney-lucasfilm-female-director-quote). She tried to [walk back on her remarks](https://www.polygon.com/2016/12/4/13835966/star-wars-women-directors-kathleen-kennedy), but her reasoning was still flawed. You can’t point to Gareth Edwards and say “This gentleman did Godzilla before we hired him to direct the movie” after having expressed concern over a “filmmaker who’s done one movie”. That’s not how the Force works!

Casey​ Cipriani​, from Women and Hollywood, talks precisely about that [in her piece](https://womenandhollywood.com/kathleen-kennedy-doesnt-think-there-s-a-woman-director-ready-for-star-wars-c67efa621e0/). Here’s a direct quote:

>Basically, Kennedy wants to groom an up-and-coming female director for the gig. But this sentiment completely ignores the fact that plenty of male directors are given the chance to direct big budget films without such grooming, or are fresh off of helming smaller indies. There’s “Star Wars Episode 9” director Colin Trevorrow, who got the $150 million “Jurassic World” gig after making “Safety Not Guaranteed” for $750,000. Gareth Edwards was offered the $160 million “Godzilla” after he made “Monsters” with a budget of $500,000. Or Marc Webb of “The Amazing Spiderman” who made that $230 million film after the $7.5 million “500 Days of (Summer).” Sure, “Chronicle” director Josh Trank may have tanked “The Fantastic Four,” his first tent-pole, but we bet he won’t stay in “movie jail” as long as, say, Karyn Kusama.

People have been adamant that a woman will direct Star Wars [since 2014](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/future-film-woman-star-wars-director/) ([including J.J. Abrams](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/17/star-wars-director-jj-abrams-women-the-force-awakens-daisy-ridley-lupita-nyongo-carrie-fisher), in 2015). Kate Erbland, from IndieWire, [recently wrote a great article about the hypocritical actions by Kennedy](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/06/star-wars-female-leadership-films-directors-1202150806/). As president of Lucasfilm, she reports directly to Bob Iger, and has the power and the freedom to put her money where her mouth is.

Going even further back from the Disney era, Variety‘s Maureen Ryan crunched the numbers on the franchise as a whole, and found out that [96% of its film universe writers and directors are white men](https://variety.com/2018/film/columns/star-wars-film-universe-game-of-thrones-weiss-benioff-white-creators-1202689891/). The sole exception? Leigh Brackett, [who wrote the first script draft of *The Empire Strikes Back*](https://io9.gizmodo.com/they-mocked-her-science-fantasy-then-she-wrote-empir-489586578). You could say that *Star Wars* films were **more** diverse when a white man was at the helm of Lucasfilm.
