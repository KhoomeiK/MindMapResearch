The only argument of whether the holodomor is a genocide or not is whether it follows the definition.

""(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;""

The only other question is intent, but saying that it isn't a genocide because it affected more than one people is not relevant to the definition at all.

Edit: Intent is entirely based off of opinion and there aren't too many facts about the intent so I don't feel like arguing for hours on that part, but other than intent the holodomor completes the qualifications of genocide."

pcgaming,fco36d4,t1_fco1laq,1577823202.0,"What I mean is that let's say you're looking at a building 200 meters away, you can see the building but a lot of the details are out of your eyes focus. A photorealistic rendering can provide a higher clarity even without being blown up, and your eye will focus to the image as it is, as far as your eye is from the monitor. So a photorealistic image could look better than what your eye can actually see, without zooming in or being blown up."
pcgaming,fcnt3h2,t1_fcnqw2g,1577817892.0,"What I meant is that based on your vision, (20/20 etc.) Your eyes provide a depth of field effect and even with 20/20 your eyes focus differently. While with a photorealistic rendering there is no focus at all unless simulated.
I completely agree that a simulated depth of field is even less realistic because when you try to focus on something that is out of focus in the picture it becomes completely unrealistic.

BUT a photorealistic rendering can provide focus to something that even a 20/20 eye cannot focus on, and if you wear glasses, you will understand that a photorealistic rendering can be as if a 20/20 person put on glasses that made them see even better, therefore better than real life.

EDIT: this is obviously not considering 3D and whatnot so it obviously wouldn't be confused with reality."

pcgaming,fcncvfc,t1_fcnc0s0,1577808991.0,"If you took a photo in real life it would have focusing issues based on distance, in a photorealistic rendering it would not. Therefore, if you were shown 2 pictures side by side, one of a photorealistic rendering and one of a real picture, you would most likely mix them up.
