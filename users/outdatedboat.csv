Fake fans of what? Smash? Fire emblem?

If you mean smash, what about if Mashtooth from The Legend of Starfy was added as a dlc character? If people weren't super thrilled about that and voiced their opinion, would they be fake smash fans since they're not happy about a character they know nothing about getting into the game?

Same logic applies here. Fire emblem isn't near as big in the west as it is in Japan, and that's fine because smash is a Japanese game. But it's totally okay for western fans of smash to not be happy with getting yet another fire emblem character.

Tap notes are generally used for sections that are far too fast to be able to do with one hand. So you use both hands on the fret buttons. When it transitions from a crazy fast tapping section to a normal strumming section, it can be a huge pain to try and get back to the strum bar fast enough."

So I put my switch back in the dock to let it download that patch. I was pretty stoked to find any game for that cheap. So if it's even halfway decent it'll be $6 well spent."
SmashBrosUltimate,fdm6f52,t1_fdm4v88,1578540931.0,"Yeah I figured. I'm currently downloading a huge update for Starlink so I haven't played it yet. I just thought this joycon grip thing looked hilarious.

I honestly kinda just got it because I didn't mind paying $6 for an arwing model. I've heard some not so great things about the game itself."
SmashBrosUltimate,fdm4lwo,t3_em3prd,1578539666.0,Got Starlink that came with this monstrosity today for $6. All I could think is that a new smash rule for my house is all spacies must use this hunk of junk.
smashbros,fdm30ik,t1_fdltbh9,1578538600.0,"Please show me sources of those players saying jiggs is the best character in melee unironically.

Jiggs is good, no doubt about that. But hbox and mango are the only people to ever push the characters to the limits. Especially hbox in the current meta. Meanwhile, there have been far more top fox, Marth, sheik, and Falco players"
SmashBrosUltimate,fdm2iq3,t1_fdkayn2,1578538260.0,"You're not wrong. I've seen so many posts/comments where people have said their GSP is around 300k. I've only had a switch for like 5 days and my GSP hasn't dipped below 4 million. I had never even played ultimate before last Friday. Granted, I've been playing melee competitively for 8 years, so that definitely helps."
