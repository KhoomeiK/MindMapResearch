StardewValley,ff967pe,t1_ff951wv,1579705800.0,"I think it works a lot better to thin it out from time to time as opposed to going through all of it. I usually have to plant 30 or so the first day of spring, and then I'm set.

OP, try planting grass in front of your barn/coop and place lightning rods evenly spaced in front of them. Animals won't eat the grass underneath a lightning rod, allowing it to spread every day."
StardewValley,ff78klw,t3_erw68k,1579643249.0,"According to the wiki, the only difference between rods is whether you can use bait or tackle or not. On PC I've never noticed a difference, but it's possible that what you're describing is true for mobile."

StardewValley,fenwbp2,t1_fenik4o,1579291799.0,"I think we'll have to agree to disagree on this one. Your whole argument hinges on him doing this on purpose, and I don't see it.

Robin and Demetrius get caught up in the fruit versus vegetable detail, when the real issue is that Demetrius has an actual need for people to be very specific when they talk to him.

An easy resolution is for Robin to make the effort to be more clear, and for Demetrius to make the effort to ask for clarification when there's room for interpretation."
StardewValley,fentil9,t1_fenot9m,1579290609.0,Why are you so certain he's doing it on purpose?

1.4 brought so many new and cool things, but Fashiondew Valley will always own me."
StardewValley,fendbof,t1_fencqhr,1579282246.0,But you aren't Demetrius. Isn't there any possibility that it was an honest misunderstanding?
StardewValley,fenbpnn,t1_fena78b,1579281263.0,"My problem with your argument is that you only allow him two possibilities: either he's autistic, or he's intentionally being a douche. I'm arguing that they simply had a misunderstanding, which either of them could have very easily fixed by recognizing that it was a misunderstanding and trying again to make themselves clear.

Edit: my bad, I thought someone else was responding. Please excuse me"

StardewValley,fem9ubu,t1_fem7bvk,1579245180.0,"Can't you see things from his point of view? He's a scientist because of the way he thinks. In his mind, tomato=fruit, and that's as far as it goes.

Everyone knows tomato doesn't go in fruit salad. If you send Demetrius to the store for apples, grapes, and cherries, he'll bring exactly that. If you send him for fruit, he'll do his best."
StardewValley,fem9htj,t3_epw687,1579244758.0,This is so wholesome I'd normally punch a wall to feel my toxic masculinity again but I don't want to ruin what you've got going so I'm going to tell the people I care about that I love them instead.

StardewValley,fe9msrr,t3_eo49xl,1578939508.0,"Strawberries for spring (even if you can't buy them on day one, blueberries in summer, and cranberries in fall.

After you have kegs, crops with the highest sell value are typically the most profitable because turning them into wine multiplies their value.

Someone already mentioned ancient fruit, which take a while to get going with the greenhouse and even longer without it, but once you have a lot of seeds from the seed maker, planting them the first day of spring will make you a fortune throughout the year."
StardewValley,fe9le6n,t3_eo4fdt,1578939072.0,"At farming level two, you unlock the basic sprinkler recipe. I believe most players opt to not use those, but wait until they can make quality sprinklers to save resources. 

I'm a huge fan of the basic sprinklers. I rush mining so I can make 20, which allows me to plant 80 blueberries in summer. I have to spend basically an entire day on it, but for the rest of the season I ignore them until harvest days.

I usually start swapping out for quality sprinklers as I can, so by the time fall hits I can plant 160 cranberries. 

All the best~"

StardewValley,fe0bp2h,t3_enjqxg,1578808928.0,"Friendship is unfortunately a grind. A coop full of rabbits won't make much money, but nearly everyone loves rabbit foot. You can also hoard gems, most food is liked by everyone.

If friendship is your whole focus, you'll have to read up on what everyone likes and maybe set a schedule to make sure everyone gets two gifts a week. Also keep an eye on birthdays with the calendar outside Pierre's, or buy one for your house.

Finally, it's only one a year but the right ingredient at the Luau will get you friendship with everyone."

I did start a new game where, for the first time ever, I'm intentionally not minmaxing. I'm taking it easy and enjoying things instead of dealing with the early game panic of needing everything right now."

If you look at gold per day, it's not much, but it's different if you look at it as gold per item.

There are situations where you can actually lose money by using casks. For instance, if you have more ancient fruit than kegs, you'd make more money by filling the cellar with more kegs instead of casks.

I think people really like the big pay day from wine twice a year, and depending on what you age, you can still make a lot of money from them if you sell all your excess while the casks work."
StardewValley,fdp2tg3,t3_emezxj,1578618659.0,"There are also a ton of mods for aesthetics, and some that change the entire game.

A nice, simple one is Fast Animations, which makes you eat faster and speeds up Clint breaking geodes.

I'm also a fan of Automate, but it can make things game breakingly easy. For instance, if you put a chest full of ore and copper next to a furnace, the furnace will smelt until it runs out of one or the other."

StardewValley,fd7yfjv,t3_ek2wby,1578211864.0,"Pigs are by far the most profitable, rabbits the least. You need to get 9 of 10 regular chicken eggs to be large in order for them to make more money than void chickens.

If you're doing a coop, I'd suggest regular chickens until you get a void egg and you can replace them.

If you're doing a barn, cows until you can afford pigs, as long as you're only interested in money. 

PSA buying animals is statistically more profitable than incubating eggs or waiting for pregnancy, which at best has a small chance of occurring."
