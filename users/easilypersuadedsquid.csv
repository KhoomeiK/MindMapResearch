submitted 12 hours ago by HammerMan2563

Asking because some have suggested this is legally questionable and he did threaten to call the oplice

I had a friend who turned out to be a bit of a twat and learned he had a hamster that wasn't being properly cared for and was being mistreated. Little hammer wasn't abused persay but he wasn't being properly cleaned out (stank of ammonia and wet bedding), wasn't being fed properly (it wasnt being changed or properly topped up) water wasn't being done fresh and my 'friend' teased him by dropping food pellets on him, bedding and just generally agitating and antagonising him. I agonised over it for a bit before deciding to rescue the lad and walked out of my friend's place with the cage and took it home with me.

Technically it isn't even his hamster, it was his ex's he was supposed to be looking after but they had a falling out where he thought she was cheating and he lied to her that it died - that was probably around late November. I've been trying to find out his ex's name/details but I'm not even sure if she lives in the area anymore. If she does I'll return the little dude but he's growing on me especially since he lets me handle him. If I eat chicken he gets chicken, if I eat sunday dinner he gets a little bit. And some muesli type mix and kaytee bedding. He nibbles on my fingers but it's not nasty, it's really endearing. If I don't get him out at least once each night he'll stand on top of a 'bridge' in his cage looking for me.

I've had my 'friend' threaten me when he found out accusing me of stealing his 'friend' and claiming they had a bond but I told him to stfu and kicked him out when he came throwing his weight around on my doorstep. Told him to call the police if he disagreed but I'm on the fence if he'll actually do it.

TO be clear - it was definitely mistreatment just not abuse on the level of flinging the hamster around, just poking and tormenting him, not letting him rest and like I said he wasn't being fed or watered properly and left in an absolute shit state. He got fed more when I was around than from my friend - he claimed they had a 'bond' but he never actually spent real time with the hamster he was always out, when I was over (which was a fair bit) he ignored it and like I said it was his ex's he kind of stole from her"
lectures,ffditni,t3_et1f0y,1579821776.0,"Alice Roberts, Professor of Public Engagement in Science at the University of Birmingham presents a lecture in association with the Great Read At Birmingham (GRAB) project.

Clinical anatomist, author and broadcaster Alice Roberts gave her lecture as part of the Darwin Day celebrations, with a focus on the anatomy and evolution of humans as a species.

'We are all members of a very special species. Whilst our anatomy and physiology is undoubtedly that of an ape, we have done things that no other ape can do, and become the most successful ape on the planet. Today, our global population numbers almost seven billion; we survive and thrive everywhere from the tropics to the Arctic.

So just what is it that makes us so special? In some ways we are so similar to our closest cousins, chimpanzees, but it's also clear that we are a world apart. But we can understand ourselves, how we got to where we are today, by going back into our deep past, to the time when we were just another African ape. And then tracing the small changes that over time, and unpredictably, led to us becoming human.

The answers to the question of 'what makes us human?' lie buried in the ground in the form of fossils and traces of our ancestors, but also lie deep within the form and function of our bodies.'"

All I can think of suggesting is that you try something like Relaxation Therapy. I found this very helpful and nowadays sometimes I listen to guided relaxation videos on youtube. You learn to relax each muscle in your body and focus on pleasant imagery whilst breathing calmly. Other related therapies might also help, but relaxation therapy is a good way to train yourself to be able to relax at will when you are feeling anxious. You might also find other therapies that you enjoy - personally I got a lot out of pottery classes in an occupational therapy centre, but we also did all sorts of things from Assertiveness Training to belly dancing.

I also suggest that you get some therapy for your other issues- PTSD and Depression. CBT has the most evidence behind it, but again see what you can find and what appeals to you. I also tried martial arts for PTSD.

Some people still feel effects for years after coming off benzos but with a bit of luck these things will help a bit.

domesticviolence,feuh2oy,t3_eqmznx,1579386520.0,":( I suggest getting some counselling for yourself so you can work out what you want to do. You could also phone a domestic abuse helpline in your area to talk to someone about what happened. In my experience though once you feel that a line has been crossed and you are deeply hurt by your partner that feeling never really goes away and they will keep doing the abusive behaviour until you eventually leave. Do you have any friends you can talk to? Also I would talk to whoever is in charge of your graduate program about the threats about getting you kicked out. There should also be a students union that you can contact for support and maybe even a legal dept.

It hurts but in most abusive relationships the victim really loves the abuser ... at least when they are being nice. The trouble is all the bad stuff is real too. Nowadays I just tend to think that if either party feels like hitting the other one it's over... it just didn't work out. Fundamentally you aren't on the same page about something and that will never change. It just gets worse with time.

If you want to save the marriage maybe you could have a trial separation while she gets anger management training or something."

AskPsychiatry,femqsje,t3_epycyx,1579266897.0,"I've had psychosis after doing lsd and it cleared up on its own after a few weeks and I went back to normal. Over 10 years later I had psychosis that wasn't due to drug use and I was put in hospital and went on risperidone for a few months. Post psychotic depression is a thing and it can take a long time to recover, but in my case risperidone definitely made it much worse. Terrible crippling depression and anxiety and awful panic attacks. I stopped taking the meds as soon as people stopped watching me. I was hospitalised again about 9 years later with another psychosis, was on abilify for a couple of months, then a couple of years after that it happened again and I was put on invega injections. These I really like despite its similarity to risperidone. I have no noticeable side effects and it really helps my mood. I don't know if it is really doing anything for psychosis or not but I feel much better in general and I am afraid that if I stopped taking it they would put me on a community treatment order if I was hospitalised again. YMMV.

Also just as a side note it's not really strange for lsd to last 14 hours, that doesn't mean there was anything wrong with the lsd.

legaladvice,fed24xq,t3_eoc1q4,1578994927.0,">So a few months ago I tried to setup a meeting with a high-end escort (who turns out is actually a pornstar also). After I stupidly sent her my information, she asked that I send her $500 in electronic gift cards to a sports apparel store popular with women, as a deposit to secure a date with her. After much reluctance I complied, but it took a day for her to get her e-cards and she refused to meet me until then. By the time she got them, she kept saying that she couldn't see me anymore because she was booked and that she was heading back to Vegas the next day, and that I'd have to wait on another occasion. I was understandably upset at the fact she couldn't tell me this before and asked if I could get my money back. She told me no, as it was not her fault that the cards took forever to go through and that i could wait til next time.

>I played it cool and told her fine. But later on I called my bank and told them that the purchase was unauthorized so they could get me a refund. This all happened in summer of 2019. Today in January of 2020, I get a text and email on my phone telling me that I need to send the escort $3k for canceling her $400 gift card, and I'm like WTF? How does that make sense? She goes on to threaten putting my info out there for everyone and that she will go to my wife (never been married btw) and family for the money. She also texts me very threatening sounding messages such as ""...I am going to fucking ruin you,"" and ""you have until tonight or your done for."" I simply reply that I dont know what shes talking about, with her replying not to play stupid and calling me things like a dumb fuck and cheap shit. 
From here I just block every avenue of communication with her. My question is, can she actually harm me and am I able to go to the police in NYC to report this? I have all the texts and emails she sent me that sound threatening, and although I did send her those gift cards, i never even ended up seeing her. I am a bit worried, but feel that she is simply trying to extort me for what she can get from me thru fear and intimidation. It makes no sense for her to demand $3k for losing a $500 gift card, does it?

It sounds like you had a conversation with someone about having a hard time over a relationship breakup and they tried to persuade you to move on. That all sounds pretty benign to me. 

As far as therapy goes you might want to try DBT."

We had a few tantrums when my daughter was 12 but even then it was much easier than dealing with a small child. I really enjoyed reading the books she was reading as a teen and watching her favourite tv shows and movies with her and hearing all the gossip about kids at school. By that stage they are also pretty independant."

news,fdorilq,t1_fdnu674,1578611271.0,I have read comments on r/legaladvice a few weeks ago about being careful when opening accounts with someone else present and wanting to make an immediate deposit because tellers are on the lookout for human traffickers doing that. I'm not too clear on the details I just remember being surprised it was a thing and thinking that it seemed paranoid. I guess this is what was going on here but the bank can't give their version of events for legal reasons hence the vague reference to extenuating circumstances.
