Oh no! I've got some bad news, it will just get worse when you've qualified. 

Good news is, you are clearly very sensible and have a strong sense of exactly where you stand. It takes a lot to stand up for yourself (more so against family) and state your limits. That's going to contribute to you having a great professional foundation.

You are doing everything admirably well, I applaud your honesty and integrity.  Now may be a really good time to establish those boundaries. You might have to put a few noses out of joint and people are going to get pissy with you but I think you are strong enough so ride it out. 

Maybe play ignorant; ""Im sorry, I dont know. That's not really something Ive any experience in, but you could always look it up or better yet, ask your doctor if it's right for you."""
vaxxhappened,febg5xi,t3_eo38rs,1578958488.0,"But... vit K is administered as part of the major Hamehorrage protocol in adults. It's absolutely not a vaccine, we cant vaccinate against a major trauma (wouldn't that be great?). 

We give it to adults whose clotting is super shaky (trauma, liver failure, major haemhorrage).

I work in an adult ICU and this astounds me, one of these parents gets walloped by a truck we would give EVERYTHING in best interests of the patient, same for any injured children. Why would you NOT do everything available to you to prevent a hamehorrage in your baby?  

And I agree with the commenter above who points out that effectively there is no such thing as a MINOR brain bleed, especially in a tiny brain."

Most names appear in all cultures if you go back far enough. Dimitri, for example is from Ancient Greece. It's not even Russian! And has derivatives all over Europe. Sadly this judgy thing is a modern issue, unlike that name, which is absolutely Classic. There are people out there calling their kids all kinda of weird and wonderful shit, and you get issues giving your son a classic name that honours a great person in your life? Bollocks to that."

aww,fcguw7c,t1_fcgrrzl,1577644232.0,"Its wasnt a reference to who does what chores, nor lauding a father for simply doing his bit. Just a public image of tenderness and affection between father and child that is something not as often seen.  

I agree with you, there are imbalances in portrayal for the perceived roles, parenting, and workload of mothers and fathers. 

Surely anything that challenges preconceptions of those roles and relationships... such as it being ""womans work"" is a good thing?

In this instance, it addreses one for the fathers."
