Cross-National Correlations of Quantifiable Societal Health

with Popular Religiosity and Secularism in the Prosperous

Democracies

Gregory S. Paul, Baltimore, Maryland Kripke Center 

&#x200B;

Keep in mind that the Kripke Center is not secular it is a religious cross denominational organisation.

&#x200B;

""indeed, the data examined in this study demonstrates that only the more secular, pro-evolution democracies have, for the first time in history, come closest to achieving practical cultures of life that feature low rates of lethal crime, juvenile-adult mortality, sex related dysfunction, and even abortion. 

&#x200B;

""The least theistic secular developed democracies such as Japan, France, and Scandinavia have been most successful in these regards. The non-religious, pro-evolution democracies contradict the dictum that a society cannot enjoy good conditions unless most citizens ardently believe in a moral creator. The widely held fear that a Godless citizenry must experience societal disaster is therefore refuted. Contradicting these conclusions requires demonstrating a positive link between theism and societal conditions in the first world with a similarly large body of data a doubtful possibility in view of the observable trends.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""there is evidence that within the U.S. strong disparities in religious belief versus acceptance of evolution are correlated with similarly varying rates of societal dysfunction, the strongly theistic, anti-evolution south and mid-west having markedly worse homicide, mortality, STD, youth pregnancy, marital and related problems than the northeast where societal conditions, secularization, and acceptance of evolution approach European norms""

&#x200B;

""In general, higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide, juvenile and early adult mortality, STD infection rates, teen pregnancy, and abortion in the prosperous democracies.""

&#x200B;

Also please note that this study does not even consider the developing world where violence, social ill, and religion go hand in glove.

Atheism, Secularity, and Well-Being: How the Findings

of Social Science Counter Negative Stereotypes and

Assumptions

&#x200B;

Phil Zuckerman\*

Pitzer College, Claremont, California

&#x200B;

Cited by Misinformation and facts about secularism and religion

&#x200B;

""Criminal Behavior:

&#x200B;

Citing four different studies, Zuckerman states: ""Murder rates are actually lower in more secular nations and higher in more religious nations where belief in God is widespread."" He also states: ""Of the top 50 safest cities in the world, nearly all are in relatively non-religious countries.""

&#x200B;

Within the United States, we see the same pattern. Citing census data, he writes: ""And within America, the states with the highest murder rates tend to be the highly religious, such as Louisiana and Alabama, but the states with the lowest murder rates tend to be the among the least religious in the country, such as Vermont and Oregon.""

&#x200B;

And these findings are not limited to murder rates, as rates of all violent crime tend to be higher in ""religious"" states. Zuckerman also points out that atheists are very much under-represented in the American prison population (only 0.2%).

&#x200B;

Marriage and Family:

&#x200B;

Zuckerman cites a 1999 Barna study that finds that atheists and agnostics actually have lower divorce rates than religious Americans.

&#x200B;

He also cites another study, in Canada, that found conservative Christian women experienced higher rates of domestic violence than non-affiliated women.

&#x200B;

Unprotected Sex:

&#x200B;

As for Plante's claim that studies have ""consistently "" found that religious people are less likely to engage in unprotected sex, that claim is directly refuted by a 2009 study that found the reverse - teens who make religion-inspired ""virginity pledges"" are not only just as likely as their non-pledging peers to engage in premarital sex, but more likely to engage in unprotected sex.

&#x200B;

Other Findings of Interest:

&#x200B;

Happiness: The most secular nations in the world report the highest levels of happiness among their population.

&#x200B;

Altruism: Secular nations such as those in Scandinavia donate the most money and supportive aid, per capita, to poorer nations. Zuckerman also reports that two studies show that, during the Holocaust, ""the more secular people were, the more likely they were to rescue and help persecuted Jews.""

&#x200B;

Outlooks and Values: Zuckerman, citing numerous studies, shows that atheists and agnostics, when compared to religious people, are actually less likely to be nationalistic, racist, anti-Semitic, dogmatic, ethnocentric, and authoritarian. Secularism also correlates to higher education levels. Atheists and other secular people are also much more likely to support women's rights and gender equality, as well as gay and lesbian rights. Religious individuals are more likely to support government use of torture."""

I'm pretty sure I said ""pretty much every measure"". Secularism correlates with lower levels of murder, rape, domestic abuse, and every other violent crime, with lower levels of divorce, abortion, STDs, teen pregnancy, sex related dysfunction, juvenile-adult mortality.  Secularism also correlates with happiness, higher educational outcomes, and charity.  Secular societies are are less likely to be nationalistic, racist, anti-Semitic, dogmatic, ethnocentric, and authoritarian, more likely to support women's rights and gender equality, as well as gay and lesbian rights. Religious individuals are more likely to support government use of torture.
