That's nice, but then you're spending way more than you should. I get it, but she needs to do her best as well, again, and it's good she's seeing someone and getting help, but that also means she needs to take some responsibility and work extra hard on her issues, she can't rely on you 100% and you need to be understanding to a certain degree. 


>Wish her family would offer her some fucking support as I feel like I'm the only one who actually gives a fuck

I feel and felt the same about my partner, and even now in our situation, I still do. His family didn't and don't support him the way he needs, his mother even told him to ""get over it"" when he opened up about his depression and anxiety. You can't lead her on, you need to be honest, but this needs to be done face-to-face, not through text. It won't be easy, but if you're clearly not in this relationship anymore, I don't see the point in continuing.

>This is why I never got in relationships before...

Look man, relationships take work. You need to understand that, and it takes compromise and communication. Sure, paying for her and listening to her is nice, but there's more to it than that, there needs to be a mutual give and take, and sometimes, a bit more take from one when necessary. 

I think she needs to work on herself and you need to figure yourself out a bit."

I mean, I would spend a fair bit every month on flights to his state (AU), but learnt to be smart as to when to buy them and such, and I had no work and relied solely on what I got every month from my family, which wasn't much. Again, if this is to work, she has to help you pay, or make a couple trips too, or understand the situation. She would benefit from seeing a mental health professional and I think you should suggest it, seems to me like being away has put her in a horrible emotional state.

BreakUps,ffflg6d,t1_fffjix4,1579886512.0,">My problem is possibly down to me working a lot, having friends etc. and her having a lot of free time makes me think I put in more effort than I do.

You need to understand that she's in a high stress environment now, she has more free time but I assume not because she *wants* to. You can talk once a day if you're busy, just let her know ""hey I have this thing so I can't talk much today"" - guaranteed she's more anxious and worried because of the situation, but now that you've suddenly mentioned other issues, can you blame her for being worried?

2.5 years when you see each other once every 3 weeks isn't a big issue. Some people don't even get to see their partners once a year, you've got it quite well. Some people have a time difference too, and you never mentioned "" other issues"" in your post, but depending on what those issues are, they can be resolved with time and effort.

My partner and I did it when we were long distance, and even now with our complicated relationship, not seeing each other for over a year, we still have daily chit chat. Doesn't have to be a lot, and if either of us are busy, we let the person know. 

Seems to me like you just don't want to put the effort into communication, which will bite you in the ass eventually. That being said, if you don't want to bother anymore, then sure, break it off - just don't regret it later. 

Long distance is hard, and she's having a harder time being away, not having friends, family, etc - it's no surprise she goes to you, her partner, for comfort and company. Ngl, you seem a bit selfish, because in this case you can't seem to see her side on it and instead see daily chitchat as a bother.

She was complaining about a change that hadn't happened for long, bringing her partner down saying his job wasn't that stressful and that as a 20 year old male she doesn't understand why he's not fucking her as much as *she* wants.

If it's so bad, talk to him and such, but understand things taper down with time. I used to have sex every goddamn day, and then it turned to every week, or whenever we could. It happens with long term relationships. What's actually a DB is when things go so stale for so long, etcetc."

Thanks so much for your experience, honestly. It eases the doubts a bit, but definitely will have a chat with a dentist before any major decisions. It will also help my family be less against it (even though I'm an adult)."
piercing,ff1binn,t1_ff1b0ny,1579477173.0,"I've heard about that, but also have been told the fact your mouth has a foreign object makes you salivate more, which in turn can damage your teeth/gums, etc. Thus why I wanna talk to a dentist first, as I do *not* wanna have teeth issues haha. 

Also is it weird having something in your mouth? Do you end up getting used to it?"
piercing,ff1b61x,t1_ff1agr2,1579477035.0,"I really want to get it done, but the fear of fucking up my teeth is strong. Gonna talk to a dentist about it and such, but it's likely I'll never get it done."
piercing,ff18x6z,t3_er48mh,1579476417.0,"Your concern should be more about the longterm damage any piercing in or around the mouth, can cause to yout teeth/gums. I'd research it thoroughly and outweigh the pros/cons.

If you still wanna get it done, pain is pretty relative, but I don't suppose it's much worse than nipples!"

Love her so much you cheat on her, have two kids with another woman and a whole nother life - you're a joke mate. You're definitely the furthest thing from a feminist, and your justifications are absolutely horrid."

You fucked up, lied, insulted a worker without basis and accepted ZERO responsibility."
AmItheAsshole,ff144vw,t1_ff13vf7,1579475046.0,Then you MESSAGE THEM PRIVATELY instead of insulting a cashier and giving them a negative review. Are you a teenager by any chance?
AmItheAsshole,ff13yl2,t1_ff13ica,1579474985.0,"I read the post, and it didn't say that, just that you noticed later on.

You couldn't go back? Message them? How is this just their fault? It was YOUR fuck up. Next time, check your change. How do you pay with a $50 and miss the amount of change, then have the balls to call the cashier a thief when you screwed up? Not cool."

You should've said something when you noticed, too, but instead you were childish and left a negative review AND insulted the cashier. Dude. It's not thar hard to say something and not be an ass."
