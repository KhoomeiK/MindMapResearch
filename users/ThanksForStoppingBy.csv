We're great thanks! I can't believe little munchkin is already a year old!"
breastfeeding,ff661vj,t1_fet0kwq,1579619997.0,How are the ta-tas?
dogswithjobs,ff3t4gn,t1_ff3t1jp,1579548280.0,Always take care of the pupper! GoPro from pup's POV would be great!
dogswithjobs,ff3sy4i,t1_ff3svxq,1579548170.0,Ahh understood. Can't wait to see pt 2!
dogswithjobs,ff3srtz,t3_erg77n,1579548062.0,This feels like just an ad for his harness. I wanted to see some goose-chasing action!
breastfeeding,fet8p4i,t1_fet0kwq,1579372814.0,"If you see the red streaks or start feeling feverish, body aches, run down..then definitely go. 
If you still have the clog, but a hot compress on it 20 min before a feed. When baby is feeding, I put pressure at the back end of the clog and help push it towards my nipple as he sucks. Put an ice pack on it after the feed. Do this religiously until the clog is gone. 

I also lean forward to let gravity help push everything along. If it's not clearing, do a dangle feed (Google it). It sucks (no pun intended), but it can help"
breastfeeding,ferc7hj,t1_ferbnua,1579352294.0,"I take 4 lecithin a day and it does help to make them less frequent, I think I just have sticky milk. It hasn't been amazing for me but other people have great reviews of it. 
Good luck momma! Keep fighting the good fight!"
breastfeeding,fep18a8,t3_eq6ice,1579309867.0,Mine just came back 2 weeks ago. Sad day for me.  Currently feeding twice at night and 3 times during the day
breastfeeding,feorhsy,t1_feorg7x,1579304433.0,Though absolutely zero shame for anyone who doesn't make it to this.
breastfeeding,feorg7x,t1_feold25,1579304410.0,That is an amazing idea
breastfeeding,fe7r2iq,t3_eo1ynm,1578918207.0,"12m PP here. I feel letdown in only one side and not always..but I also never felt it for the first several months. I also think 8oz is pretty optimistic. I was never able to pump more than a few ounces at best (though I mostly just breastfeed) but my baby never drank more than 4 oz the first 5 months I occasionally bottle fed. Pump what you can, I think you're doing fantastically. 

Take some Moringa tablets if you want a bit of a boost too"

AskReddit,fco3cbu,t3_ehxmpw,1577823293.0,I've been writing and illustrating personalised children's stories (I have a bedtime one completed and the stories finished for a first day of school and birthday one). I'm apprehensive to tell anyone in case they royally suck
WatchPeopleDieInside,fclp9lw,t3_ehojwk,1577753152.0,This is a repost. Someone had mentioned before that it's cut to look like that but the audience actually had a pretty good time in reality
breastfeeding,fcbbil9,t3_egz1xq,1577584841.0,"I honestly don't want to answer one way or another because I really don't know ... but my instincts, tell me to trust YOUR instincts. If LO isn't asking for feeds, there could be something wrong. ... It could also just be some sleep confusion, but I'd definitely see a doctor to either get some answers or peace of mind. You don't need the added stress of worrying. 

Best of luck! ðŸ’—"
