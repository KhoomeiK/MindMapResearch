Showerthoughts,fdr27rv,t1_fdr1o70,1578678461.0,"Because there is not an incredibly large number after the comma but an infinite this is not true. The fact that this pi is irrational makes this statement 100% correct. 


You could also say that since pi has no end you can’t precisely say when this time was meaning that it is never. I might be wrong and this time actually happens but you just cannot determine when (which I don’t think)."
Showerthoughts,fdr1lkn,t1_fdr14fm,1578678295.0,The message is still the same that you never have actually pi o’clock

Showerthoughts,fdqg79q,t1_fdpgn1y,1578665864.0,"Of me? Well there are some groups of numbers which you get to know in 9th grade (at least in germany). These include for instance natural numbers (1,2,3,..) whole numbers (-1,0,1,2) and just rational numbers (every number you can write as a fraction) (at least these are the translations which came to my mind rn but they might be different). Pi belongs to the irrational ones so it can’t be Pi o’clock by definition."
Showerthoughts,fdpemjh,t3_emi2ke,1578626655.0,Actually since Pi isn’t a rational number this isn’t true.
depression,fdpe96j,t1_fdpc555,1578626393.0,"So this might sound a bit too easy but, at least in Germany bit I’m quite convinced where ever you life too, there is the oral mark which is about 50-70%. So if you just ask the teacher 2-3 questions per class (they don’t must really intelligent just make them random and the teacher will think you participate in the class quite well) and shut the fuck up besides this and you will probably get a decent oral mark. 

Obviously a bit of studying for the tests is always recommend but the oral mark is usually more important. Also the main problem of not understanding the stuff (main part of the most stuff) is that your teacher is a fucking moron and didn’t understand it neither (even though he doesn’t know this). So the easiest way to get around this is simply looking for some good youtuber that explain stuff actually well as you will see at the lastest 8th/9th grade when you are smart enough to realize that the most teachers are fucking stupid. 

Also I am convinced that nobody or just a few really hates you. Usually the most people just don’t care about you. I mean you don’t care about the most people either so why should they, right? And if there are a actually people hating you that you don’t want to be friends with them just fuck them. It might change either later or just not but right now you shouldn’t care too much about them. With that being said it IS possible to change this from your own but it’s really difficult and exhausting. 

The problem with motivation is that you can’t control it. However what you can control is your daily routine. So if your routine is learning an hour after coming home it will come natural to you to just fucking learn.

Furthermore being a bit selfish is just human noting to worry about"
depression,fdpbvdx,t3_emkcdi,1578624743.0,Sounds pretty depressing to me. However there’s noting really selfish about this. How is your future tucked up in particular?
depression,fdpblhh,t3_emkch5,1578624554.0,I don’t think this will actually be a solution except many people don’t like you in particular tbh. Because if they just don’t care about you it will change nothing.

ReinhardtMains,fdk3rpt,t1_fdj2aez,1578495347.0,"I would recommend to always charge if you don’t feed what (for me) means and you get yourself or the whole team a huge disadvantage. For example you don’t want to charge 100m and get sprayed down at this time. Or you don’t want to end up in a 1v6 standing in the enemy team.

However I find it really useful to charge when the enemy is close to you and relatively close to a wall since this is the shortest time for the enemies to cancel it or straight up burst you down. During a time fight when someone doesn’t see it coming is also great."

StarWars,fdj60ne,t1_fdiewsi,1578459421.0,Well as said in TROS it is a chance of 1:1.000.000 which leads us to the question why she did this. Well I think she was just desperate at that point and knew they will fucking lose if she just don’t destroy this ship. So the only thing she come up with is this little technique which makes sense since why don’t know any other to now.

AskReddit,fdd0ne6,t1_fdbpuv9,1578290149.0,Actually only a really small amount of people can breathe perfect like 10000 or something like that. Since you usually don’t sit perfectly you can’t breathe perfectly as well. In the most cases we breathe too quickly and not deep enough. In German there is a saying “erst einmal tief durchatmen” which means to take a minute and just breathe deeply. By doing this your brain will get way more oxygen which affects your work positively%
