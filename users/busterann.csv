I say fuck that. If someone tells my girls to keep the change, you're damn right we'rez keeping it. Badges are $3 each. I've got 12 girls, that shit adds up! You wanna give my troop a donation bc you can't have the cookies? Thank you very much! This will help my girls earn their bronze and silver awards. I attended cookie training but my service unit's cookie manager, she never mentioned anything about is not being able to keep donations or change. She said that we're not allowed to have a ""tip"" or ""donations"" jar on our at our booth."

The worst part of the whole situation (besides losing my entire friend group overnight) was his mom begged me not to tell the cops that he bit me, this was a woman who was there for me more than my own mother.

I hope that entire family dies in a fire."

I woke up one morning with a decently broken (probably also dislocated) big toe. The only thing that could have caused the damage was my tall dirty clothes hamper near the foot of my bed. You know the kind: cheap, with the decorative holes in it. I think my toe got caught in a hole and I must've moved in my sleep. It's a wonder I didn't wake up when it happened."

AskReddit,fdn37eg,t1_fdmyksm,1578575947.0,"It's not like my mom couldn't afford the utilities, she made enough money for us to live a comfortable life. I grew up thinking I was very poor. When I got older, I realized that my mom was actually just spending as little money as possible so she could build her retirement. 

So instead of me getting a new pair of shoes if I outgrew mine, I'd have to wait until back to school shopping for the next school year. One year for Christmas, all my brother and I got were rolls of bubble wrap. We never had gloves or snow boots, no winter coats, no hats or scarves. All because she wanted to live comfortably when she retired. She's just a terrible person, and an even more terrible parent. Always has been, always will be."

Sheet hung from ceiling by staircase to prevent living room vent from sending all heat upstairs. Lots of baking done.  Of course bathroom and kitchen vents stayed closed year round.

Summer meant thermostat set to 80, all vents downstairs get closed and magnetic sheet put on. Curtains would be drawn 24/7, oven use was kept to a minimum."

Not all moms are terrible pieces of shit, but not all moms are wonderful goddess-like creatures. Moms are human, and all humans are fallible. 

It just so happens that your mom and my mom are both terrible fucking people. At least my mom didn't prevent me from going to school - quite the opposite in fact. She almost killed me by forcing me to go to school when I was deathly ill with gallstones/pancreatitis/jaundice. My mom said I'd have to be dead for her to consider allowing me to miss school."
AskReddit,fdm4v2x,t1_fdm46e2,1578539842.0,"Having to do my own laundry at such a young age made me hate doing laundry. Since my mom was rarely home to supervise me, I would go weeks without doing laundry or even bathing. Kids and teachers alike bullied me about my dirty clothes and how I smelled. Hell, my mom would make comments about how I looked or smelled.

Giving kids chores is a great thing. The chores should be based on the kid's age, abilities, and household need. Making a 5 year old do their own laundry is dumb, making a 5 year old help sweep or help empty the dishwasher makes more sense."
