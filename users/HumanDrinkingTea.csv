I don't like the fact that you just completely ignore all the upsides to specialization and all the downsides to non-specialization. 

One of the upsides to specialization is the amount of money saved on food costs and increased freshness of food. Non-specialized places don't know what they're necessarily going to sell on any given day, so sometimes they have food that either goes to waste or sits around quite a while until it's used. The specialized place always uses the same ingredients, allowing them to buy in bulk (saves money) while also always having fresh ingredients."

college,ff9celh,t1_ff8t1ww,1579709813.0,">  Idk what you mean by 'freshmen classes'

First year classes. Not just gen eds, but the first classes you take for your major. Unless your school is a competitive school, these classes tend to be *really* easy in order to help students ""transition"" from high school to college. There are exceptions, of course (""weed-out"" classes). In my experience, weed-out classes aren't actually hard-- they're just classes that have college-level standards, and they're hard for freshman because they aren't used to the expectations of such classes. The rigor often starts ramping up after the first year, as professors have more of an expectation that students are adults and can handle a challenge. This isn't the case everywhere, though, in which case I'd try to find a place that does challenge students. Being challenged is a sign you're learning, so as much as people complain about classes being ""hard,"" challenging classes are usually a sign you're getting a bang for your buck (it might also be a sign that you have a *really* shitty professor, so your mileage may vary). 

I don't know what you mean by ""red flags"" in your English Comp class, but writing is an *extremely* important skill. I was lucky to have an amazing professor for my English Comp class, but I understand that not everyone does. If it's an adjunct teaching your course, they're probably drastically underpaid, in which case I hardly blame them for not giving a shit. The shitty part is that even though these professors barely get paid, tuition for students is through the roof. The system is broken. Use ratemyprofessor and word of mouth to find the best professors. Professor quality alone can really make college a better experience. 

> Honestly I just want to learn what I need to know to do my job and then go to work.

If this is your attitude, tech school might be a better fit. Don't think that this means you have to go to a vocational or 2-year school, though. While just about every 4-year school in the US will require gen-eds, some require more than others. If programming is your interest, I'd recommend any school that has ""IT"" (Institute of Technology) in it's name. In my experience, these schools tend to be lower in gen eds and higher in more applied/technical classes."

I know that seems like a lot when you're in high school, but remember that these are college level classes. $100 a class is such a steal that if I were your parent I'd be tempted to make you take them (I would never actually do that, but you get the point). The same class taken a few years later could cost you thousands of dollars. Compared to this, $100 is pennies. Do you have to buy your own book for your high school AP classes? Because in college, books alone will cost more than that, and that's not even including the cost of the class. 

Unless your family is really poor and legitimately cannot spare $100 per AP class, taking as many AP classes as possible is most certainly going to be the best *financial* decision. Whether it's the best decision for you is differen (you may not want to overload yourself), but if you can handle the workload, I'd always advise as many AP's as possible *just* because of how little it costs."

No-- they give assignments and have high standards because the point of the class if that students demonstrate a certain level of competency, and this is what it takes to make that happen. 

In my experience, most gen ed professors water down their courses as much as they can when it's only taken by non-majors, but they don't do so to the extent that the integrity of the course is lost. They don't want to water it down so much that you don't learn what the class is meant to teach you, which is likely what would happen if they didn't give so much work.

Also, some gen-eds contain a mix of majors and non-majors. If that's the case, they're keeping standards high because obviously the majors will need it, and so you more or less have to hang along for the ride. The way to avoid that, of course, is to try to take gen-ed classes that are specifically only designated for non-majors."
college,ff3vh68,t1_ff3ox4g,1579549738.0,"> You haven't put forth any sort of legal argument to back this up.

Nor have you. It is clear from the fact that you cited a statute about hospital admission that you do not know what you are talking about-- it can hardly be considered an ""argument."" I didn't say this with the intention of attacking you, but it is important to know the difference. You are acting as if you know what these legal terms mean in the context of mental health commitment, yet you don't. It is Dunning-Kruger. Your legal ""knowledge"" is straight up bullshit. Each state has mental health specific laws that are separate from laws relating to arrest, so your intuition is off, since you don't seem to be aware of mental-health specific laws. And again, it is *very* important to understand the difference between being forcibly transported to the hospital versus forcibly committed. The latter has much higher standards than the former. 

[Here's a good overview about how it works](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4195632/). It's written specifically geared towards physicians, but it does mention the role of the police somewhere in there. I mostly recommend reading just so you have an idea of how the system works.

[Here's the overview relevant to MA specifically](https://mhlac.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/admission_and_discharge.pdf). 

Note that it says

>  Section 12(a) allows for an individual to be brought against his
or her will to such a hospital for evaluation. 

and, under ""who can sign a Section 12(a) appilication,"" it says

> Pursuant to Section 12(a), a physician, nurse practitioner, qualified psychiatric nurse, qualified psychologist, licensed independent clinical social worker, or police officer may apply to admit anyone to a facility if he or she believes that, without hospitalization, the person meets the standard for admission. 

[Here's the form that the MA cops have to fill out to document transportation](https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/10/05/section%2012%20order.pdf).

Note that the standard for legally being able to forcibly *transport* a person is simply a ""belief"" of danger of a person to themselves or others. Hence the fact that I use the phrase ""good faith belief"" so much. It's because that *is* the standard. If a history of self-harm (even if OP stated that they have stopped) is enough for a cop to believe that OP may harm herself, the cop was well withing his/her rights to make the call that he/she did. Should the police get better training so they don't make bad calls? Yes. But legally the police were allowed to do what they did. 

Remember, this is for transportation. Section 12(a) is also an *application* for involuntary admittance (which transportation is not-- anyone with the proper credentials and a good faith belief is allow to transport against the person's will). Section 12(b) is where the physician chooses to admit the patient or reject the application. Clearly, in OP's case, the physician rejected it and OP went home.

All entirely legal. It played out exactly how it is designed to play out by law."

Edit: To clarify, it is legal because cops have the liberty to do this if they believe someone may be a danger to themselves or others. From a legal standpoint, it does not matter whether or not they are *correct* about this, because they are not trained to make that determination. What matters is that the *doctor* is correct, and it is on the police to make sure the person in question makes it safely to an environment where they can be given an appropriate evaluation. This means forcibly transporting them to a hospital. Again, totally legal. Remember, the whole reason the system is set up this way is because random people, cops, and EMS are *not* trained to evaluate these situations, so the only reasonable solution is to get any person in question to a trained mental health professional ASAP.

TooAfraidToAsk,fez5vi9,t1_fewpyhj,1579454087.0,"You're not American, so I want to reiterate what u/BADMANvegeta said:

> I think it’s not easy to understand or notice if you are white or not from the US.

While your theory is a reasonable one for someone who's looking into the US culture from the ""outside,"" it's really off target, imo.

To understand US racism, you have to understand American history, and how strongly slavery was part of the economy back 150+ years ago and how it's role in the economy lead to some pretty inhumane practices. But it's not *just* that slavery was inhumane. It's just that there was an entire culture built around slavery to justify it's existence. After all, abusing human beings in the manner that slave owners did is obviously immoral. But the southern economy would collapse without it. How to handle this cognitive dissonance? Instill a culture where black people are seen as subhuman. It was normal at that time to claim that slave owners were doing slaves a ""favor"" by ""taking care of them."" In fact, I've heard this claim made by Americans alive today (sadly).

It was a dark and atrocious part of our history. But the culture that was built around the institution of slavery was so strong that it would be absurd for it to just disappear. While racism today is not even comparable to racism 150 years ago, attitudes have still been passed on from generation to generation. In the mean time, laws such as Jim Crow had reinforced legal discrimination.  

The whole issue is much more complicated than I even described here, but the main point is that our country was, as they say, ""built on the backs of slaves."" And slaves, for the most part, were black. The entire history of our country consists of the oppression of African Americans specifically (other minorities are a different story with their own separate histories, although many have been oppressed in their own way), and lies about black people being ""lesser than"" their lighter skinned peers have carried through to today. 

Again, the whole thing is pretty complicated, and the nuance is hard to understand if you are not American. Although I am American, I myself am white, and I have had to immerse myself in different communities and to read and listen to the stories and history of our country in order to pick up on additional nuances of the situation, but there is still much that we as Americans are aware of regarding our race issues that is ""obvious"" to us but very foreign and bizarre to non-Americans. 

I have friends from countries all over the world (all different continents) and race issues in America are very confusing regardless of whether a person is from Europe, Africa, or Asia. We Americans grow up knowing our history and being taught it, but I don't know how much of that you're exposed to. Just know that it goes *way* beyond a sense of nationalism/patriotism. In fact, a Balkan friend of mine was explaining that where he is from, there isn't ""racism"" like there is in America, but discrimination that is based on a sense of nationalism, so if the attitudes are more nationalism-based where you live, I see how your assumption/theory would be most intuitive to you. 

As I said, though, the ""nationalism"" theory is off target. Racism has a different flavor in the US, and I have no doubt (based on my interaction with non-Americans) that it would seem extremely weird, bizarre, and foreign to you."

college,feyt7ip,t3_eqxylr,1579450284.0,"> Would recruiters judge on a general degree?

If you mean employers, I'd say yes. You will have disadvantages. A significant part of the advantage a college degree brings is that it signals that you have specific *specialized* skills and knowledge. I've personally noticed that the more general the degree, the more challenging it is for people to find work. 

I have a music degree, which (clueless) people say is ""useless,"" but I had no trouble at all finding work because I had a specialization. If you are an employer looking for someone with a specific set of skills and knowledge, you will always choose someone with the appropriate specialization over someone with a ""general"" degree.

There also, I think, may be a bias or stigma against a general degree because it implies that someone either couldn't hack it in a specialized path or simply weren't willing to follow through. Very few people choose a ""general"" degree from the beginning (which itself looks bad, because it indicates some level of not planning ahead or being directionless). Being able to follow through with things is a positive indicator to employers, as is having direction. They want to know that you know what you're doing and can see a project through. They will want to know why you ""gave up"" on your original major.

Even psychology and neuroscience, which are the better degrees, typically require a graduate level education before you can really land a ""good"" job (although there may be some positions in the business/office world that you can get with just a basic psychology or general degree). I fear that you may be shooting yourself in the foot, though, with a general degree. What if you want to get a graduate degree some time down the road? Will the general degree hurt you (I don't actually know the answer to that one). But I fear that grad school admissions may hesitate to admit a student who couldn't follow through with a more specialized degree.

I want to add, in addition to what I said yesterday, that if you are aiming for ivy tier schools (like Columbia) you really should be challenging yourself with tough AP classes and getting A's in them. I don't want to be a pain in the ass and harp on the ""I don't want to take classes I don't need"" statement, but this attitude is a *serious* turn-off for ivies. They usually look for the ""best of the best,"" and the ""best of the best"" tend to have broad interests and tend to be willing to challenge themselves in areas that they might be less comfortable in. Grade inflation in high school is so high in 2020 that grades alone are not enough to get into a school like Columbia. There are way more students with top grades than there are spots at these schools, so you have to distinguish yourself in additional ways, and one of the ways that students tend to distinguish themselves is to, quite bluntly, take as many AP's as humanly possible and then get A's in them.

I'm not saying this is a good idea or even healthy, but I think you need to have a realistic idea of what you're up against. If this seems a bit much, that's okay. I think being focused on your end goal is fine and that if you want to pick and choose only relevant classes that is a perfectly okay choice and that you'll still have a realistic shot at some really, really good schools that are top schools but maybe not quite ivy tier.  

Honestly, there are many great schools in the northeast, and to start you might just want to check out any school ranked in the top 100. Ranking certainly isn't gospel, but it's a reasonable guide to use absent of any other information about quality. Most people use US News to check rankings.

I don't know if you noticed, but you used ""should of"" twice in this post, and chances are that if you don't change these habits they'll creep into an essay and one of your professors will eventually call you out on it. 

Personally, I had a great k-12 education with several teachers who were straight up grammar nazis. I have minimal ""natural talent"" when it comes to writing skills-- it had to be beaten into me (figuratively, not literally-- my k-12 teachers wouldn't harm a fly). I say this because I've found that having strong writing skills has served me well again and again in my life, and because despite the pain that my teachers put me through, rising to their expectations has paid off. Whether we like it or not, strong written communication skills signal to others that we are ""smart"" and ""well educated."" If you write well, you will undoubtedly be treated better by others (professors, employers, coworkers, colleagues, peers, etc.). It's not a conscious thing, I don't think. It's just that strong writing skills give others more confidence in your competence in other areas. While many people are great at some things and bad at others, there is a very real general tendency for people who are good at some things to be good at other things. In other words, being a strong writer really is a low-key signal that you are a person worth hiring and a person who can be trusted to do a job correctly.

Sorry for the mini-rant. This is all independent of your professor being a jerk (which he very well may be), but I have to stand by his strictness.

If your professor would have otherwise given you 100 on your paper, then you are probably pretty close to being a strong writer.

The reality is that many people in the past decade have been graduating college without the writing skills that are reflective of someone who is well educated. It has lowered the value of the degree. Your professor is trying to make your degree worth something, and he is setting a standard. If you rise to the standard of producing work that is free of errors (and of the high quality that your professor said that you produced), then you will get an A.

Obviously you're still a kid, so your situation is different than mine, but my background has allowed me to get a good ""feel"" for how the act of being a musician is viewed by academics. 

> academic: “How does the student’s achievement rank among that of their peers?” with five options: top 5%, top 10%, top 15%, top 20%, and top 25%

Something that might not be lost on admissions is that those who are good at one thing tend to be good at other things. I went to a competitive music school that was housed in a mediocre university. There was an odd but noticeable tendency for students in the music department to be stronger than STEM majors at this school in general academic subjects. The music school I went to didn't pay much attention to academic achievement when admitting students, yet the average SAT scores within the music department were higher than the SAT scores among students in many of the more academic departments. 

Why was this? Because the best musicians are very often the best students. That's not coincidence. Being a good musician requires a strong work ethic and a reasonable aptitude (reading music and understanding music theory can be a cognitively demanding task for some people). These traits, not so surprisingly, transfer over to other areas of study as well. 

If you are in the top 5% of musicians at your school, it definitely signals something positive about you. 

> 5 more criterion (Cooperation, Initiative, Enthusiasm, Creativity, Responsibility) marked out of 5

This is where you can really get ahead with a recommendation from a music teacher. Because of the nature of music, your music teacher can probably speak in detail to how you have demonstrated these traits. Some of these traits don't show up quite as easily in other academic contexts.

> A “Further Comments” section, AKA “how this student would be successful in a research environment, as well as what skills may still require further development”.

Your band director might not be that familiar with research environments, because it is not typical for musicians to have research experience. Because of this, you may want to discuss with your band director what sort of traits a research environment might be looking for, so he has an idea of how he might want to word his recommendation. 

I'll be honest-- I have no idea what a research internship would expect from a high schooler. However, in general, there are certain traits that I think would reflect very well on a person interested in research. First is personal responsibility. Do you always show up on time and get your shit done, even when no one is breathing down your neck about it? There are many young people who will flake out the moment no one is holding them responsible. You need to be the sort of person who does what they need to do, even when no one is watching.

Next is the ability to work independently. Do you need someone there to hold your hand when you are learning something new, or can you work things out on your own? There are many honors students who do great in school because they have great teachers, helpful parents, and access to tutors, but if you left them alone in a room with just a textbook and google, they wouldn't know where to start. This ability to learn independently is an important life skill, and is extremely important in research, since you're often exploring areas that not many people in your immediate vicinity can help you with, so you'll need to be able to learn about something just from reading up on it on your own. 

Lastly, I'd say that character is important. No one wants to work with a jerk, but there are many jerks all over the place. You seem to be a reasonably decent and professional human being, so you should be fine on this end. Be sure to be humble. Research internships are not common among high school students, and the fact that you are even considering this opportunity indicates that there is a very high chance that you're from a high socioeconomic background. Be mindful of what a privilege that having an opportunity such as this would be. 

To respond to u/Zdawg1202 (in the post you made in r/ApplyingToCollege), I have to say I disagree that you should use a math/science teacher. Presumably, you'll include your transcript on this application, yes? If so, then your grades will speak for themselves. A's in math and science classes will be more than enough to indicate that you are strong in that area. What you need is someone to speak about who you are as a person. Can you handle an environment that has more adult expectations? If you have a math or science teacher who can answer important questions about the quality of your character and your ability to rise up to challenges and to be the responsible and independent worker that you need to be, then ask a math or science teacher. But if you music teacher is the person who can best discuss your most positive traits, then ask your music teacher.

In the end, you need to ask for a recommendation from the individual who can give you the *best* recommendation."

It seems that OP really *prefers* healthcare over engineering, though. It's not an ""I like both and can't decide"" situation. It's an ""I want to be a doctor but I'm afraid I'll fail"" situation. In this sort of situation, I think it's better to just go full speed ahead shooting for the medical route."
college,fet081j,t3_eqjjji,1579370612.0,"Honestly, probably all of those have rough job prospects, but I'm no expert. 

I've heard that it's really tough getting a job with an MPH (master's in public health), and that's a *masters*, so I'd stay away from public health. 

I don't know much about the other two you mentioned. I will say in general that most careers that have to do with ""child and family services"" have good job prospects but low pay. On the flip side, I'd guess that something a bit more niche and ""business-y"" like Fashion Merchandising would be more likely to have bad job prospects but decent pay (as in, it can probably be a good career *if* you can get your foot in the door, which will probably be tough). 

This is all conjecture, though. Do some research on these careers and decide what you value in a career. Pay? Stability? The ability to help others? Creativity? Knowing what you value most will help you make decisions that are more suited to what is a good fit.

Also talk to people in your desired careers, and ask them what they'd recommend you major in. For example, I'm a musician, and I recommend that every person who wants a career as a performing musician major in music education (rather than music performance) because then you have a ""back-up"" in case you can't get work as a performing musician. Teachers can get hired to perform, but performers can't get hired as teachers without the proper credentials, so the better choice is obvious. 

People who are out there working where you want to work probably have some good pieces of wisdom that they can share with you."

That being said, she's in the US and she now makes six-figures, so if you don't plan on practicing in a country where you make so much money in nursing, than it might not be worth fighting with your parents about it.

It's clear that you're more interested in healthcare fields, though. I'd do pre-med and if you don't make it into medical school then your parents will just have to deal with it and you can pivot to another healthcare career (physician's assistant is another option, at least in the US, and they also make good money but it's also competitive, too). 

On the upside, you don't know that you won't be able to make it into medical school. You *definitely* won't make it if you major in engineering, but you'll at least have a chance if you do pre-med."

That being said, I'm pretty sure most large public universities offer these subjects. They are less common than they used to be due to schools pinching pennies and because they are less popular majors than they used to be, but they are still relatively prevalent.

I'm one of the people playing devil's advocate on this thread and saying that the student's culture should be taken into account. I am dissapointed, overall, in two things that I have seen repeatedly on this thread:

1) The number of people who haven't noticed that you said that these two bribes happened around the same time (implying that the student never had a ""second chance""-- many on this thread seem to think that the student already had a ""chance"" to learn), and

2) The number of people who seem to ""know"" that bribery is considered unacceptable everywhere in the world. I don't buy it. 

Because of the latter, my suggestion to you is to, if you can find one, go to a subreddit or forum where individuals from your student's native culture congregate and ask them about the situation. I know that we have r/askanamerican, so maybe you can find something analogous from the student's culture. Also see if you can find people on your campus who are from or are well-versed in your student's native culture.

The reality is that it is hard for us Americans to place ourselves in the student's shoes. Some people don't believe that the background of the student should matter when doling out consequences, which is fine. But that is a belief, and a belief that I disagree with. However, I'd like to push back on anyone who *assumes* that the student is aware the egregiousness of his actions. We are not the student. Some students might take advantage of the willingness of people like me to take into account cultural differences, and I do believe we need to be mindful of this-- I'm not an idiot. But expulsion is a very serious consequence. I don't think that it is a decision that should be made lightly. This is a situation that *needs* input from someone (or several people, even) who are familiar with your student's native culture.

Without a representative to ""translate"" the cultural norms within which your student acts, I'd say that any sort of judgement would be in haste."

college,fes7d06,t1_feps511,1579362164.0,"Not to minimize how tough these classes are for many people, but they aren't upper level classes-- Calc/Linear/Probability are typically 100/200 level classes, which are by definition lower level courses. Classes coded 300/400 are typically considered upper level.

That being said, you're right that CS basically has a math minor embedded into it, and that it's usually a tough major for people who are weak in math. 

That being said ""weak in math"" means different things to different people. Some people enter college with elementary school level math skills, whereas some get a B or a C in high school Calc and lose some confidence in their skills and start considering themselves ""weak,"" even though they'd probably be able to manage a CS degree just fine."
college,fes54bj,t3_eqgffi,1579361468.0,"Yes and no. First, I say no because you really don't have to be a stereotype to be successful at anything. That's all they are-- stereotypes. These youtube ""personalities"" are only a small subset of the population of people who are successful in the business world, and there are people who are successful who don't fit the stereotype. Off of the top of my head, I'm thinking of Tom Steyer, who is an American businessman/billionaire who is running for president as a democrat in the US. He certainly *seems* to be about a lot more than ""hot muscles"" and ""women."" For what it's worth, his platform seems to be decidedly pro-environment and anti-corporate, which again is very much *not* the stereotype for businessmen.

There are many other businessmen I'm sure that are more like you, too. That being said, stereotypes exist for a reason, and I think you are right to question the sort of environment you want to be in for your career. I say this as someone who is changing careers. I was a musician and a music teacher. The reality is that I *like* it, and I love the people who are in that field (so I certainly didn't have issues with personalities like you do), but I'm an introvert and what I was doing was a career that is a great career for people who are extroverts and need to be interacting with people all the time. I had a good job that was a bad ""fit"" for me. In fact, I'm pretty sure I had a job that many people would have loved, but it just wasn't ""me.""

You should consider if being a businessman is a good ""fit"" for you (as you are doing). What will the day to day practice of your target job be like? Will you actually *like* it? *Can* you tolerate the sort of people you'll be surrounded by? Again, stereotypes *do* exist for a reason, and I'm not afraid to admit that most of the questionable personalities I've met in my life have been in business.

That being said, you have options. I don't think it's too late to switch to economics. I made the switch from music to statistics. I'm in my late 20's and haven't finished a graduate degree yet, but I'm getting there and so can you. 

It seems that from this post, a more academic field might be a better fit for you. You seem like more of a ""thinker,"" and (at least in the US-- I don't know how the market is where you are) you can probably go farther with a graduate degree in something quantitative like economics than with a more traditional business degrees.  

I will say that as someone switching to statistics, it might be an area that you'll want to consider as well. I love the field partially because of it's applications to, well, just about everything. Econometrics is it's own field (it's basically the study of statistics as applied to economics), but you can apply statistics to psychology (psychometrics), medicine (biostatistics), or politics (don't know if there's a name for it, but check out the stuff that people like Nate Silver and Andrew Gelman do).

The point is, I relate to your sentiments about being interested in all sorts of field, and I successfully found satisfaction in a different field that allows me to engage thoughtfully in different areas. It might not be for you, of course, but you might want to give it some thought. I'd argue that here in the US, at least, a statistics degree (at the graduate level, at least) is *much* more employable than a business degree. There is nothing superficial about it. You get to *think*, and you get to use it to better understand the world around you. And better yet, most of us are nerds and not at all concerned about women (which is easy for me to say because I'm a straight woman, but I certainly don't see the ""macho"" attitude in this field that I see in business fields)."
college,ferzmhk,t3_eqgn5u,1579359933.0,"> Basically, I don’t want to waste any AP classes that I don’t actually need

I'll be honest-- it's *way* too early for you to know what you'll ""need"" or not. When I was 17, I knew I was going to music school. My major required no math. I took AP Music Theory, of course, but I also took AP Calc BC. 

Since then, I have graduated with that music degree, and I've fostered a passion in math and statistics. You know what? In high school, I didn't think I would need Calculus, but I took it anyway. Turns out it was a great idea in the long run. I'm now getting a graduate degree in statistics, and the AP class was great preparation. 

This isn't to say that you should take all the AP classes-- it's totally fine to pick and choose the AP classes you're most interested in. I mean, I always *liked* math, so it's no coincidence that down the road I ended up using it. 

The point is, even if an AP class doesn't seem like something you ""need,"" if it piques your interest you should go for it. 

Also know that AP classes can help you skip out of gen ed courses that are unrelated to your major.

It seems pretty obvious to me that this situation is likely a cultural misunderstanding, and it surprises me that many people here seem to assume that ""everyone"" has the same notions about the ethics of bribery.

It's reasonable to argue that even if a student doesn't know that bribery is bad, they should still get expelled, but I think saying that ""everyone knows that bribery is not okay"" is completely ignorant to the fact that the entire world does not work the same way as the US."

I'll be honest-- I was about to say that you'll probably need a PhD, but the link I gave you seemed to indicate that you can do fine with just a master's. However, this is actually irrelevant to the point I want to make, which is that people (like myself) who are on the ""career change"" path and who want to jump into a different field but already have a bachelor's typically only worry about taking the prerequisites for graduate programs and then apply for graduate programs once the prerequisites are completed. No second bachelor's necessary.

Of course, you may have a *lot* of prerequisite courses to take, but you don't need any *more* than the prerequisite courses.

I think the student being foreign is worth considering, though. The egregiousness of the situation should be obvious to any student raised in the USA. However, bribery is simply not seen as being anywhere near as bad in some cultures. This is to say that the student might only understand it as ""only"" being as bad as any other type of cheating. 

If the student is from one of these cultures, I think that there is an argument to be made that OP's student deserves the opportunity to take it as a learning experience rather than to be expelled on the spot. Note that OP mentioned that both bribery incidents happened around the same time, meaning that the student never had a chance to ""learn"" from the experience. 

*If* OP's student does this again *after* being warned, then expulsion is reasonable. But context matters. Being in a new culture isn't easy as it is. I'm reminded of a story from some (American) kid who got into trouble for piracy when he was in Germany, I think. We as Americans don't view piracy as all that an egregious a crime, so the kid was quite taken aback when he learned that it is very much seen as ""not okay"" by the new culture in which he was immersing himself.

Given the nature of the circumstances, I think there's a good chance that OP's student needs to have a lesson on ""when in Rome, do as Romans do."" In other words, this is not necessarily an issue of OP's student actively choosing to do something that he knows is egregious. Even if OP's student knows it's wrong, he might not now quite *how* wrong it's viewed as by Americans.

Professors,fen2o80,t1_femlg4w,1579275627.0,"While I think that the problem you speak of is somewhat widespread, I also don't think it's as ubiquitous as you imagine. I don't know what sort of institution you work at, but I'm most familiar with three institutions. Two of these schools are 4-year public schools and one is a community college. All of these schools target and serve a low-income population, with the community college serving almost entirely at-risk students and the public schools serving more mixed demographics. 

Public school#1 is in the situation you describe. I am concerned about the quality of students that they are graduating. 

The community college is, for lack of a better word, a clusterfuck. In fact, that's an understatement. There are extreme political and ideological rifts within the school (as well as corruption and incompetence within the administration). Nearly everyone entering the school is *well* below college level, and graduation rates are in the single digit range. Higher ups want to get graduation rates up, and they don't seem to care much about whether students graduate with the actual skills that their degrees are meant to certify. The tenured professors dig their heels in the sand and say ""no,"" while the adjuncts who are hanging on by a thread give in. It is a toxic work environment, to say the least, and I think the tenured profs do a solid job keeping standards high, but the work is as mentally draining as you'd expect and fail rates in the 90%+ range in some classes is far from unheard of (which certain administrators blame on professors, but I also observe enough of a united front among professors that the professors can maintain *some* vague sense of sanity). The chaos at this school is almost too much to describe, but it is a good example of institution made up of almost entirely of at-risk students.

Public school #2 admits anyone with a pulse, but also doesn't seem to care in the slightest about whether or not students *pass* the classes. In fact, I have word that some years ago there was significant pressure on professors to err in the direction of grade deflation. The school appears to be focusing on improving it's ""rank"" among commonly used lists (which might not be the *best* way to do things, but it's far from the worst thing a school could strive for). What I observe at this particular school is high admittance rates, but also high failure rates in first year courses. I've also noticed that they seem to push some of their weaker students to transfer into Clusterfuck Community College, who then fail out of Clusterfuck CC rather than their own school. I don't condone this, necessarily, but the reality is that Clusterfuck CC offers remedial classes that this public school doesn't offer and that these students need, so to some extent, it is the only reasonable option that the public school #2 can take (other than, you know, *not* admitting unqualified students...).

However, I've heard nothing but good things about the quality of Public School #2's graduates and the quality of education given to the students at this school. It seems to take more of the sink or swim attitude, which might not be the worst approach as long as the students who are going to sink do it early on before too much has been invested in them. There are some students who come into this school at a high school level, and they do offer remedial courses targeted at these students and I have seen some success with these students. 

The students at middle school and elementary school level seem to mostly be stuck at Clusterfuck CC, and while success rates are low, I do see enough of those heartwarming ""success against all odds"" stories that I find myself to be a cheerleader for these opportunities. Some people who are in shitty situations and who have a weak academic background really are meant for highly academic paths, and it the idea of preventing opportunities for these students really pains me. 

There needs to be more gatekeeping, yes, but I think what it comes down to is offering appropriate remedial level classes and then failing the students who deserve to fail. Some schools hesitate to actual fail students, and that's where we're going wrong. 

Sure, not everyone is ""college material,"" but we need to give them a chance. We need to not be afraid to have high standards and we need to fail the students who are not capable of adequate work, and if their GPA dips too low, we need to be able to say ""goodbye"" and maybe tell them to try again in 5 or so years if they feel they're ready.

What I just wrote is already par for the standards at most places-- the only change is that I want schools to *actually* maintain high standards. Basically, we need to ditch the grade inflation. Obviously in practice this would be tough, but maybe it wouldn't be so tough is the taxpayer rather than the students were paying? To be fair, it often already *is* the taxpayer that's paying to some extent (many students have federal grants), but with free college the public will likely have more of a negative sentiment towards the ""everyone passes"" approach that seems to exist at many schools. 

> If anything, I'd like to see trade schools and votech schools become free first, or alongside, in these proposals.

I do agree with this, and I do agree that not everyone is ""college material."" In my experience, though, many poor kids or wealthy but abused or neglected kids who *are* college material get lumped into the ""not college material"" pile just because of bad situations in their early lives. 

I think there needs to be a cultural shift in the ""everyone needs college"" attitude, though. The students who are in college but don't want to be there know who they are. We need to be able to get it into their heads that it's okay for them to leave and to live their lives in a way that is more fulfilling for them, and we need to make sure that they know that there are financially viable options outside of college. I don't see this happening, though, and that's a problem."
