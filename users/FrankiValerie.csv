bulletjournal,fee2l5v,t3_eom21t,1579025089.0,This is amazing and I'm gonna need to copy it next month. Thank you for sharing!!!!!
bulletjournal,fe71skx,t1_fe70aye,1578908911.0,Omg it's totally night mode I love that ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
bulletjournal,fe6q5gb,t1_fe61bn2,1578900213.0,It's an Archer and Olive blackout book. They're a little on the pricier side so this was a Christmas present from my fiance. Their website has a list of stockists for all different countries (US based) [Archer and Olive Website](https://www.archerandolive.com/). I'm in UK and we found it cheapest on a site called [Art From The Heart](http://www.afth.co.uk).
bulletjournal,fe6q0wa,t1_fe6nl1v,1578900052.0,Oh no! The one I've used for this is a Faber castell metallic marker. I've also got signo gel pens in white gold and silver which show up very well but smudge quite a lot. Sakura have a collection of gelly roll pens called moonlight and they show up great and there are some really bright colours. There's also Spectrum Noir metallic brush markers that show up SO beautifully and come in a lot of different colours.
bulletjournal,fe6pus4,t1_fe6fnwp,1578899835.0,"It is! It's kind of a nice creative challenge. There are a lot of stickers I feel like I can't use though, because they're semi transparent or have a thick white border so they look less seamless than I'd like."
bulletjournal,fdn67em,t3_em9gih,1578578397.0,I have a see-through plastic zip bag for mine - probably one intended for a travel toiletries bag.  I have my journal facing out on one side and a zip-wallet from redbubble I use as a pencil case facing out on the other as decoration.  The zip-wallet is covered in my fave pins too and the plastic case means i can display them without worrying about loosing them.
bulletjournal,fdn5xtx,t3_em9y7e,1578578192.0,Pretty new to Reddit too. More of my bujo stuff is over on my art Instagram. It's a mess but I'd appreciate some new eyes to it ðŸ’š always follow back other bujoers and artists @frankidoodlepigeon
