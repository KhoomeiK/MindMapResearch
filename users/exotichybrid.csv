vcu,feilqfm,t3_eovajt,1579141481.0,"I'm speaking from my experience solely.

I graduated with a degree in Biology years ago from my community college. The course load was mainly Biology but I had to take as many chem classes they offered (gen and orgo. biochem was an elective.) Honestly, its implied you know chemistry when you are a bio major, engineering major, physics major, etc. Science curriculum usually overlaps like that.

I don't see it as important because of this. If you really wanted to take Chem 302 (which is orgo 2?) then take it at a community college or graduate and then take it. 

Now if you want to stand out, get a minor in something that will increase your market value: bio major/computer minor or bio major/math minor, etc."

Asexual,fc4edyv,t3_efssqx,1577414247.0,"Grey baby here. 

You both should talk about what you guys need in a relationship. Here a few things to dicuss:
Is her not finding you sexually attractive a problem for you?
Do you need sex in this relationship?
If you need sex, is she ok with giving it?

Things like that you can bring up. But really, just casually talk about the relationship and ask her about her kind of asexuality. Is she sex repulsed, indifferent, or positive? Etc.

Good luck."
