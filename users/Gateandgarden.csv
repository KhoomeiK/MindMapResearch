fatlogic,fed6nod,t3_eoa0ja,1579001432.0,And muscle DOES NOT weigh more than fat. 5lbs is 5lbs. It's dense - this is why two people who are the same height and weight can look very different - depending on the muscle to fat ratios. One will look smaller and leaner than the other if they have more muscle Vs fat.
fatlogic,fe732r0,t3_entcia,1578909320.0,"Amen!

I'd also include: body positivity includes slim and fit people too.
