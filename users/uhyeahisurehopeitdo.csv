KUWTK,febcwph,t3_eoaysv,1578957588.0,"I mean..  I have always loved kuwtk, but when they did what they did to Jordan, I couldn't look at the them in the same light. I just remember Scott saying,
""How is she supposed to talk to you khloe, you guys can be really intimidating""
And the way they ganged up on her, didn't hear her side of the story, it just hurt my heart."

I had my first period at my dad's house when I was 13, and that was a awkward car ride to giant. Idk it's just something to be aware of. You sound like a great dad, and best of luck!!!"
relationship_advice,fdtrb7t,t3_emyq20,1578720981.0,"This is not crazy!!! It is perfectly normal to want those things. You just need to communicate it, and start out slow.

relationship_advice,fds9cb4,t3_emu11b,1578697343.0,"Honestly, just work at being as successful as you can be, and there will be a time when you can repay him. For now, just show him as often as you can, how the sacrifices he made for you, have made you the man you are today. Because of him, you are who you are, and let him know that! You both sound like incredibly kind people, and I wish you the best :)"

Yes, trust is built, but shame is a hard thing to overcome. I would try to be as understanding and non judgemental if you want to keep the relationship. Best of luck, hope it goes well :)"

relationship_advice,fck5567,t3_ehl0km,1577716878.0,"Idk. I feel like you're overthinking this because it's just a playlist, but at the same time since she cheated before I think it's something to watch out for. I definitely don't think it's anything to blow up over because it's not in anyway definitive proof of cheating it's just a playlist. But be on the lookout, and just ask her. If you can't trust somebody your with you shouldn't be with them. you know her well enough to know how she would respond to the question if she was telling the truth so just ask and then deal with it how you see fit."

relationship_advice,fc1chy2,t1_fc0xldr,1577314657.0,"I mean... He has already broken set boundaries. At this point you have to decide what you want, what's best for you, and what's the healthiest option. If you feel like this can be worked out, work it out. But it's all up to what you can handle, and your boundaries (which have already been crossed). Choose the hard but good choice, whatever that may be. Life is too short to be leashed to a mother in law, not a husband. But who knows. Best of luck"
