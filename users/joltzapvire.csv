AmItheAsshole,fdmjx1f,t1_fdj32xu,1578552642.0,"You're taking it to the extreme here and wishing ill because I express an opinion. 


I'm allowed to comment on something I find annoying. Humans should have empathy for one another and for animals, but it's irritating to see so many people lose all sense of reason because a dog is mentioned."
AmItheAsshole,fdgt60m,t1_fdgmh5e,1578407677.0,"The bias is real. It makes me cringe to see logic fly out the window just because a ""pupper"" is mentioned."
AmItheAsshole,fdgg8ao,t1_fdfg4hn,1578395396.0,It's an eye opener lol. It helped me come to terms with a lot of the abuse I experienced that didn't feel/look as serious as physical stuff.

AquaticAsFuck,fd47y0y,t1_fd26dag,1578165202.0,My first thought too.
AquaticAsFuck,fd47wyd,t1_fd2urjt,1578165192.0,Entitled dog owners suck.
AquaticAsFuck,fd47uau,t1_fd3aikg,1578165170.0,You should not be down voted for this. It's 100% true.
Shoestring,fd25t9n,t1_fczy7ah,1578142150.0,"This is true too. 


I was speaking from personal experience more than anything, but I'm sure you can find a lot of low-cost options."
Shoestring,fd25ol3,t1_fd12yvl,1578142083.0,"That's great! Not every airport has cheap flights to ORD. If you're driving into Chicago, it's a different story (parking cost, tolls). 

Plus, having lived near the city for quite some time, many of my experiences there have turned out pricey. Granted I was going for higher end food and shopping."
worldnews,fczncek,t1_fcytqbj,1578104990.0,It isn't as cut and dry as that. Calling out entitlement and ignorance is tantamount to bettering the country.
gaming,fczmzwe,t1_fczicic,1578104776.0,Yep. Spot on.
gaming,fczmtdp,t1_fczkilz,1578104661.0,"Not every service member is concerned with fighting for constitutional rights. In fact, I'd bet that most of them joined the military for their own reasons. Maybe to get a college education paid for by the GI bill, benefits, a steady pay check, travel, experience, whatever. People have their own motivations.

&#x200B;

What are you accomplishing by calling out a service member for not ""upholding the constitution"" and ""respecting the freedoms"" of privileged people like yourself who lord their education over others? Does it make you feel good to wave around your fancy words and learned concepts? Your insults reek of academia.  

&#x200B;

You're adding nothing to this conversation."
worldnews,fczkrjc,t1_fczhs61,1578103381.0,"It sounds like you're completely missing the point of what was said. Everyone here can agree that no one deserves ""life long injuries, psychological or physical."" 

&#x200B;

I have to wonder why you bothered responding to /unloadedboar in the first place. Like, what was your intent in calling his experiences into question? From his comments it seems like he IS an actual service member who likely knows people with PTSD. 

&#x200B;

My point is, there's no need for hateful, spiteful comments  when it adds nothing to the conversation other than putting someone down or calling out a *perceived* mistake."
Shoestring,fcz7ntb,t1_fcysjrt,1578095325.0,The city can get pretty pricey though
AmItheAsshole,fcywbs8,t1_fcyhcnt,1578088504.0,I'm aware. Just making a joke

cats,fcp50fr,t1_fcovcwe,1577850663.0,"I would disagree with this based on personal experience. 


In my household, adding a second cat caused tons of unnecessary social problems for the cats, added extra chores (litter box scooping, more throw up, brushing, hair clean up), and was responsible for an ""us vs. her"" mentality between myself and the cats. I felt less connected to my first cat throughout the whole experience, and we ended up rehoming the second cat after about a year. 


Some cats are also better off in single cat households. And some people work better with only one pet to look after."
cats,fcp493c,t3_ei7ums,1577849989.0,"Just want to add to some of the advice already given here.


Invest in some good cat furniture, like a sisal rope tree or elevated bed. Cats are climbers and feel comfortable being high up (to survey their kingdom). It's also good for their health and fitness to have the option to climb. Plus having furniture that is definitely theirs means less destruction of your nice, people furniture. 


I recommend the AmCat brand if you're in America. Pet Fun if you're in Europe."

cats,fcp3jry,t1_fcohdlx,1577849379.0,I'd be interested to know what food you're feeding them! I've been on the hunt and would love some guidance.
Dogfree,fcizukw,t1_fc2amf1,1577673789.0,I watched it over the holidays too and loved seeing an accurate portrayal of a dog + dog owner! It was refreshing.
femalelivingspace,fbmcv60,t1_fbjn290,1576981889.0,Omg yes. This is perfect!
