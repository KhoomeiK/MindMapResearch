britishproblems,ffdjwx0,t3_et0m0k,1579822448.0,Got blinded SO MANY TIMES on the way home. Yeah there's fog out but the streets are so brightly lit there is no reason for most of my journey home to have my fog lamps on when you can see most of the road still
weightroom,ffbvt4n,t1_ffbveac,1579784439.0,"I've only ever really used hook grip so only thing I can suggest is maybe doing some lighter sets with hook grip and just doing them over and over until you feel like you've got it and then starting to bump the weights up again. It's annoying and feels like you're taking a step back, but I'm a big believer in making sure you have perfect form before bumping your weight up"
AskUK,ffbm9mn,t3_eslwmm,1579772351.0,"Hi! If you're doing this for the money then I'd say please think very carefully about actually doing porn. It's actually incredibly difficult to make a lot of money in that industry unless you build a name for yourself and produce independent work. 

I would honestly think really long and hard about if you feel it is worth living with no money for a long time."

AskUK,fexzp55,t3_eqvmxw,1579438856.0,"Honestly for me, as a northerner who lives closer to the Scottish border than I do to London- I feel like London is a completely different country. So much money and effort is put into London, and London's interests that it feels like we get forgotten. A good example of this would be the train system: some of our local trains have only just been replaced from when they were put in place in the 80's. 

Not just things like that, but on a more personal level: London always has new things, new events, new shows, new bar/restaurant concepts etc etc. It just feels like the rest of the country gets left behind. Yeah we have it cheaper up here (god bless the ¬£2 pint), but it sometimes feels like we miss so much culture that won't leave past the M25 border for another few years."

weightroom,fexotvu,t1_ferl91f,1579434213.0,"Late to the party but: if I'm at home I'll have maybe one can of cider or a glass or two of wine at the weekend. When out socialising I pick things like gin and tonic or spirit and diet mixer- keeps calories down better than pints/wine! 

The whole thing I go for is moderation. I don't want to stop socialising, but I don't go out as much as I used to and I don't drink the way I did when I was 19-21."
britishproblems,fexclsz,t1_fexci2u,1579428696.0,Disclaimer: I used to work retail and my shop opened at the same time as the supermarket near it- not good if you'd forgotten to bring a lunch and forgot it was a Sunday!

A small pot you can get from the supermarket is 500+ calories- it doesn't have quite as much protein as peanut butter but if you pair it with some veggies (carrots, pepper, celery) it's a delicious alternative to peanut butter and apples."

UKPersonalFinance,feqblb0,t1_feq84y3,1579339833.0,"Came here to say this- Grad schemes usually have a pretty set salary they pay to everyone (so I'd imagine they budget the money available for the scheme to the number of grads they take on). It also probably keeps it more fair if everyone is paid pretty much exactly the same. 

&#x200B;

OP: You're probably best taking the grad scheme, getting the experience of the scheme on your CV and THEN thinking about negotiating."

piercing,feon2v1,t3_eq7lrk,1579302488.0,"Horrible answer, but depends. Cause I got pierced with a bar, it seemed to heal quite quick but whenever I would brush past it or accidentally bump it it would remind me it wasn't healed. It was on the same ear as my industrial that I got in the same sitting, so I think my ear was just a bit more sensitive cause of that."

UKPersonalFinance,fduwkq9,t1_fds3zxu,1578740064.0,"That's low for some of these payday loan companies. I've seen them as high as 2000+% . There were massive legal cases brought against them a few years ago which shut down some of the big names for not being clear about their interest rates, but all it's done is make the number bigger on the adverts. But the adverts target people who are desperate, and they know that."
gaming,fduufex,t1_fdutxlc,1578739005.0,"Modding is still huge! I think with The Sims, it always will be a massive part of the fan experience, no matter how much EA tries to capitalise off of our want for more items, decor and clothing!  (There are even some incredibly risqu√© mods that EA will NEVER acknowledge) 

Personally, I can't risk it cause I use my laptop that has my work stuff on it but there is some amazing content out there being made by fans."

Yeah, Sims 2 had a few ‚Äústuff packs‚Äù but they were nothing like the sheer amount of content you have to buy now.
