Tuesday: Looks for cable pulley rope attachment, finds it on floor by another member. “Are you using this?” Yes, one more set.” Finds something else to do while waiting, other member finishes set and starts new exercise with rope attachment.

I don’t know that all areas offer this.

1.  Police get called by somebody at the address.
2. Police give that address to the municipality.
3. Municipality sends a letter to property owner about excessive calls to the property.

Many clubs and bars cannot afford to pay if they are sued because of a drunken brawl, a drunken patron damaging cars or nearby properties, etc.  Insurance companies don’t like to insure bars and clubs because they are risky. In general, the public likes to have bars and clubs so in many states, the government maintains fund that will pay out when a bar gets sued. In exchange, they really want the clubs and bars to monitor their patrons and remove rowdy elements or people who are out of control."

“Fully funded” often only applies to tuition.  The student typically still needs living accommodations when only tuition is covered, as well as books (almost never included), clothing, computer access, and transportation costs.  Secondary education costs so much more than tuition.

Exactly this.  I lived next door to a volatile situation. When I heard something, I did call 911. Both adults in the house had problems and arrests.  They had tried to cause legal problems for me because I had reported them. It’s true that those who intervene are at a physical risk as well.  There were times when other neighbors reported them but I didn’t hear what was happening. So possibly all of the neighbors called 911 but stayed safe in their apartments. You just don’t know."

I was diagnosed with DCIS of the right breast in September and had a double mastectomy, no reconstruction on December 2. 

My team—breast surgeon, oncologist, radio-oncologist, and the nurse navigators—hold a weekly conference to discuss each patient’s condition and treatment plans. My breast surgeon told me I could go to https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/treatment/treatment-of-breast-cancer-by-stage.html to learn the typical treatments for each type/stage of breast cancer. 

Those who say the treatment plan may vary are correct. The DCIS standard of care typically is lumpectomy plus radiation plus hormone therapy. In my case—large area of DCIS, not large breasted, positive mutation for clotting factor II—meant poor appearance after lumpectomy (half of my breast would be gone) and that I couldn’t do hormone therapy (tamoxifen has a increased clot risk).  Team suggested at least a single mastectomy but I chose a double because I wouldn’t need any adjuvant therapy after surgery. So I am a good example of why treatment plans change and why the standard of care doesn’t always apply. 

The MRI often shows better and more detail than the mammogram and the ultrasound do. This can change the diagnosis and treatment plan. In my case, mammogram didn’t show any DCIS in my left breast but the MRI did find areas that appeared to be changing too. The final pathology report after the mastectomy did find benign tissue changes in my left breast. 

You are right to get second opinions. I was diagnosed by a local hospital 10 minutes away. My second opinion came from a service that reviews your records without examining. A breast surgery professor in San Francisco confirmed the original diagnosis and opinion. The third opinion came from a cancer center about an hour away. I didn’t feel that the surgeon had reviewed my medical records and he simply recommended the standard course of treatment. Yes, please, let me walk around with half a right breast and suffer a stroke from tamoxifen! He then tried to push recon.  Get the second opinion but you may not be better treated driving further but only your wife can decide who makes the most sense. 

Breastcancer.org has discussion boards and resources that I found very helpful. 

I was given a book called The Patient’s Guide to Breast Cancer Treatment that also had some helpful information."
