getdisciplined,fd2govd,t1_fd25hgk,1578146959.0,I endorse this one as well. It’s been a huge help for us. I like that I can actually see what’s on the calendar for each day and we can both go in and make additions and notes.
getdisciplined,fd2gbvu,t3_ejsn3g,1578146812.0,I started using Routinist and really like it. I can check things off as I go and it keeps track of time so I stay focused.
getdisciplined,fcvalg4,t3_ej0b36,1577998093.0,I found an app called Routinist that has helped me tremendously in creating a routine and sticking to it. I already notice a big difference and find I have more time in the morning because I’m not lolly-gagging. You set up how long you think each task will take and it keeps track as you go. It will also show you what time to get up in the morning to be out the door by a certain time in order to complete all your tasks. It helps me to not forget certain tasks and keep focused. It also keeps track of your progress by making chains. Highly recommend!
