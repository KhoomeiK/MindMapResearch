We had a cat and he brought his big pitbull, usually a reasonable nice dog we trained and he checked with my husband. You had to walk through our bedroom to get to the bathroom, we had isolated my cat in the bedroom. I wasn't happy about it but it was one night whatever.

Ofcourse he went to the bathroom and left bedroom door open, my cat snuck out to see wtf was going on.  The shitbeast immediately went for the cat got her in his jaws, thankfully didn't shake. To my husband and friends credit they were lightning fast, two marines over 6foot 10 built like tanks grabbed that dog by the ears and tail and slammed his head into the door frame. Never in my life have I seen a dog with such a thick skull have an obvious concussion. Took out the framing. He instantly dropped my cat who fled and his eyes glazed over when he came to the dog was fine. My cat had to go an emergency vet, at least friend paid for the bill.

No one is perfect, just do the best you can and ask for help when you need it. Needing a break from your kid and focusing on yourself is healthy and normal so don't forget to take care of you. 

Also make sure you discuss your mental health issues with your obgyn so they can watch out for post partum depression. My doctor made sure to discuss all the signs with my husband as well, so he could watch out for it and be my advocate for help if I needed it.

Until you have a comfortable set up it's a lot to ask him to move away feeling unsecured in a position. Don't put it off forever obviously but until you are situated I wouldnt push the issue. You need ground to stand on for even footing in the discussion you want to have. 

The driving issue, honestly you really need to address that everything else aside. You have a child that depends on you, only you to make the day to day work. There will be times that this will come up. This is completely independent of everything else and I strongly recommend talking to your therapist about it. Also look into a driving class itself it make make you feel more secure. 

Frankly I think you both just need better communication. You seem to have the same end goals but different ideas how to get there. That's ok! Working it through is how we make relationships work."

Why does driving upset you so much? You have a child, driving is pretty important in USA but less so in Europe. You might want to see a therapist about your anxiety issues. 

Based on the very limited information here I'd say it's to hard to put anyone at fault. If you want this to work you both need to compromise for what is best for the future of your combined families."

When I was about 5 I asked him which team was mine. He told me i could choose any of them (we are in Alaska no local team) and then showed me the logos and mascots and stuff. I picked out the Packers because green was my favorite color and I loved cheese. So my dad ordered me a little cheese hat and had it shipped (1991 alaska shipping is not cheap) so I could wear it for my team.  Farve won their first superbowl with them it was on my birthday.

Calories are the only factor, you can not make something from nothing, calories are an energy measurement. You get x amount of energy from breakfast but you need y amount of energy to exist (think blood flow/breathing/digestion) if x exceeds y you end up with z. Z is excess energy or fat incase you run out of x and need z to support y.  If you never run out of x you keep adding to and become fat or obese. Its math. Math doesn't lie no matter how offensive that is to you its frankly just math. 

Now certainly medication can increase your appetite while lowering your drive to move. Very common situation, depression is a great example. You want to eat and nap for weeks. You end up eating more calories while doing less, of course you gain weight. So you could just, adjust your math while getting therapy so you're physically and mentally happy."

Years later and married we have a wonderful daughter. He was there with a subway sandwich the minute I could eat after labor. He's changed way more diapers than me, dishes are done and house is vacuumed.

My friends once got a German shepherd that they never trained / socialized and just got high all day and played games. (We were all young, not friends with them anymore.)  Anyway they thought she looked cool and dangerous. First time I went to their house she was 6months old and they had to close her in a room before they let me in because she was so aggressive. She broke out and charged me barking and I immediately screamed in my deepest voice to stop and lay down. Spooked the fuck out of her because no ever did and she froze, so I grabbed her muzzle and told her to lay down again full eyecontact. She dropped to the floor and stayed there by my feet, rolled over tail wagging licking my ankles trying to be submissive. Sure as shit her actual owner tried to come over to me later and she growled at him. In her mind I was alpha then her. I told them they needed to find her a proper working home with training or put her down. That was not met well. 

I don't hate dogs, but they are dogs. There is a time, place and a job for many of them. Unfortunately 50% are just sitting in an appartment wasting away all day, 30% are useless little mutts made of breeds that should die and the other 20% are fine."

If they ever bring it up to you, you will immediately leave/ hang up the phone. When this inevitably happens put them in a time out and refuse to contact them for a week or month or whatever. They will get the message quickly hopefully."

Your marriage is over, die on this hill. This is the ultimate betrayal. It was so nice of you to give birth to his and his mother's child. I as a mother want you to understand this is so fucking far beyond therapy.  Do NOT waste another 10 years and another child's birth. Fucking run. Run fast."

I have had your relationship with a girlfriend roommate of mine since both our husbands were deployed. We even took showers together after parties to help wash each other's hair. Crocheted together while watching tv shows and slept in the same bed so we were not lonely. 

You could always have a best friend and a fuck buddy. It's out there, if she wanted to have sex with you she would."
JustNoSO,fccy2am,t3_eh19yr,1577604024.0,"My husband and I hit a very very similar point with our daughter but much sooner when I was on maternity leave. His excuse was I was breastfeeding, I made sure I started pumping more which still my labor but I had a rule, while pumping I don't exist. It built better bonding for him as well being able to feed her himself. We set 5 hour on and off shifts.

This lead into an agreed upon time frame we built that worked for us. I had to be at work at 6am, earliest I'd get off is 4PM on a good day, 6 days a week. I made a deal with him then when I walked through that door I take off my shoes, change, shower and he gives me that girl for 3 hours. I missed her and he's fried, I'm fried but a in a different way I can handle her for a bit. This gave him a light at the end of the tunnel and me one as well. Once my ""baby shift"" was up I'd binge watch Netflix, play a game, read a book, go to bed early. We split dinner / dishes chores and my MIL bless her did our laundry for us since our washer broke. 

Now overtime we realized we weren't spending enough ""us"" time and got a bit snappier then we usually are. So we integrated 1 day a week with my in laws and 1 day a week with my mother in 4 hour shifts.  She's 11 months old now and sleeps through the night and I no longer want to hold a pillow over his face until the snoring stops. We still haven't had an overnight away from her but it gets better so much better.  

I am not sure if you have family / friends to help give you a break, if you don't look at once a week daycare it's not that expensive for one day. Set up some form of schedule / agreement with husband where he is taking 50% of childcare and home responsibilities. Remember, it gets better over time and some men struggle in the baby potato phase. I know a few dads who weren't dads until that first giggle and they regretted not bonding sooner. But above all DO NOT LET HIM OFF THE HOOK YOU ARE PARTNERS!! Good luck."

She didn't flat out say it initially but eased into it over like 30minutes. When I said no one but husband and I will be there she did the whole ""but you need support!"" 

I asked her how many people did she have for ""support"" in the room for her recent colonoscopy? My husband grinned and looked as his feet immediately, my FIL started stifling a laugh and walked away. She changed the subject and I never heard another word. I mean fair's fair..

My mother tried to tell me when I was pregnant she was going to be the first person to hold my daughter. I just dead pan looked at her and she corrected with well after you and husband. Then I told her my ward is locked and no one will be visiting during labor. They may visit if and when deem it time, naturally she ""forgot"" when I went in labor. Still a locked ward ya looney."

As I'm getting older it has hurt me having you miss every holiday (blah blah here is where she gets choked up/cries.) I just want to be a part of your life again.""

Then you can expect all the lovebombing in the world, probably deflecting all the blame to it not being her ect but not actually taking responsibility. If you go for it you can expect her down the line to fess up about how much she's struggling and just a little help here or there and if you say no you will see her mask slip.

Anyway I am hope I am wrong, good luck and protect yourself first because she's likly only worried about herself."

DeadBedrooms,fc0301a,t3_efe1sl,1577276027.0,"You have 2 young children, how young. She might not feel attractive after having them. My husband and I used to have sex 2 to 3 times a day then we had our daughter. He gained 50lbs while I gained 15 when I was pregnant. Even when I tell him I want him he is embarrassed being naked. 

It took some time but he explained that even though he wants me he doesn't like seeing himself naked.

Also another rather large issue men on this sub are less willing to admit to is time sink. Are you making dinner, do you pack the kids lunches, when was the last time you picked out their clothes, went to every dance recital? I am absolutely not trying to accuse you if anything please understand this. But if your wife spends all day at work and every spare moment in ""child care"" mode, ofcourse she is exhausted.

Look to yourself first, your behavior. If you can justify your life or you are the one ""packing lunches"" than get therapy. Or leave."
oddlyterrifying,fbzlcti,t1_fbzk3ul,1577250607.0,"So often there are seasonally employment for snow shoveling by the city. They will dig houses out if someone calls a wellness check because they haven't dug themselves out. This type of situation does not happen often where I grew up because there are precautions against it. I set my alarm ever hour and reshovel the entrance.  

Ok so for the actual logistics, I would grab my closet rod and stab it through to find the light. When it snows this much overnight the snow itself is usually ""fluffier"" the colder it is the more volume but less dense it is. Just tonight the snow was so light because it was so cold we swept it away with a broom at about 2 inches. First move is actually to drag snow inside into a ramp and then melt it as you go. 2 people is best but hey shit happens. This snow is 90% not compacted it's just fluffy nonsense."
oddlyterrifying,fbzcjy7,t1_fbz8mcm,1577242187.0,In my experience we open the fro t door(they open inward). Start shoving into pans / buckets. Melt them on stove / fireplace / heater and dump down the drains. Snow is super low density so a lot of snow is like 1/3 water or less depending. You start at the top and build a little ramp until you're far enough out to actually just shovel it away from the door.
