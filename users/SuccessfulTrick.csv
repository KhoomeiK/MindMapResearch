depression,fd3l0sh,t1_fd2day4,1578159298.0,"Exactly what I did when I was 19 most of the time I was learning skills that will help future me

I've gone backpacking at 22 for 4 months as first time traveling as well and I've had the best time where I've experienced what I didn't experience before as 19 years old.

People who were having ""fun"" just for the gram are now asking me how did you do all of this (related to my job life and traveling ), and it took me some time to realize that not everyone knows what I know..and some people were wasting their years thinking that's how you live and now they regret it."
