AskReddit,fek5sz8,t3_epj100,1579193211.0,"Nintendo DS : Super Robot Taisen OG Saga: Endless Frontier. It is an anime-ish turn based RPG with timing mechanics for the fights to maximize damage and not let the opponent guard break if they hit the ground during your combo. It's a lot of adult humor, boob/sex jokes but I quite enjoyed the characters and story as a whole. The main character Haken Browning is probably my favorite protagonist ever, not to mention a strong cast of supporting characters."
