gaming,ffd9qnh,t3_esxybv,1579816203.0,I got my 4 year old a Switch last year and got Lego Marvel Heroes 2. I'd never played any of the Lego games myself. He absolutely loved it and we spent ages getting all the unlocks together. So I got him Jurassic Park next and then he got a few more for Christmas. Now I spend my days watching YouTube playthroughs so I can unlock all the characters with him and get all the minikits. I also picked up some of the games that weren't available on the Switch in the last Steam sale. I've get 16 Lego games now and I have to share my PC time with him. Worth it though.

All you can really do is leave it in to them to get them to fix it. It's possible you might have a small claims case against them for some of your costs but you could only do that afterwards.

People from Muslim countries banned in case they are terrorists. If you were to treat Christianity the same, Catholic men wouldn't be able to work with children in case they molest them.

When it comes to looking at practitioners of faiths, Christians are treated as innocent until proven guilty and Muslims are treated as guilty until they prove they're innocent.

That's before you get into the backgrounds of the people doing the criticism. Most people on Reddit that criticise Christianity have lived most of their lives surrounded by it. Most people who criticise Islam on Reddit are fairly ignorant of the teachings of it and have had little exposure to it."
