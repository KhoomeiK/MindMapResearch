Professors,ff7poei,t1_ff79zi6,1579655316.0,"Or maybe I just like giving an overview of the class, my expectations, etc?  I realize the meme is that all profs are like, beholden to evil admins who strip of us our autonomy unless we deliver a Karen-approved performance every class, but maybe some of us like explaining things first.  I have an entire semester to dive into the course material."
AskThe_Donald,ff0zj2q,t1_fep7twu,1579473771.0,"The fact you think fellow Americans are the ""bad guys"" is part of the problem.  If you really, really want a civil war, it can only be because you are ignorant of the fact that it will cause untold destruction and the end of the United States as a 1st world country."

law,feen1vo,t1_feegmyp,1579037076.0,"Bentham, as in, human rights as natural law is ""nonsense upon stilts""  and talk of rights is ""terrorist language"" Bentham?  Yeah, I'll pass.  Specifically, I'll pass because my human rights aren't tied to a government approving my rights.  That's more or less monarchism right there, regardless of   how attractive bentham is to ""le redditor"" because of ""logic"" and ""social utility."""
law,feeejh9,t1_fecy1zo,1579032122.0,"I usually just make that comment to let people know that their perspective is not/would not be consistent with the political philosophy -- in this case classical liberalism -- on which the concept of democracy is based.  Americans revere their founding fathers almost reflexively, so I go there instead of saying ""John Locke wouldnt approve of your sentiment.""  I just assume most people on this site are americans since the demographic breakdown of reddit suggests its the most typical user.

But  it's super nice that you lucked into a country in which slavery was never institutionalized! Go you!"
law,fecu6cu,t1_fect5dz,1578984759.0,"I realize lawyers like to think of the law as a sphere separate from politics, from politics gives birth to laws, not the other way around.  If all the laws in the world -- codified and enshrined in stone -- said that people were not equal, all of those laws would be wrong, and all the judges that enforce them would need to be removed. Political philosophy trumps laws, not the other way around.  If you think otherwise, you're on the wrong side of the founding fathers."
college,fdhwt20,t1_fdgkjcy,1578431576.0,"I guess I should have clarified that I'm a professor.  I don't really have 'questions' about grade grievance processes as such. I was simply commenting that grade disputes like this are really common and that your advice isn't really in the student's best interest.  Trying to go over the head of an entire department because you 'feel' that your problem isn't being addressed as fast as you want is just not going to play as well as you think it will with a dean.

Now again, my experience is in the northeast and the midwest... maybe they do things really weird down there in Virginia where you were, but in new england we definitely don't look kindly on this kind of student, right or wrong."
college,fdg3wid,t1_fdfwjmt,1578379047.0,"But if the semester hasn't started yet, s/he just comes across as a bit annoying.  I'm all for student challenging grades for whatever reason, but going straight to an academic dean is just overkill if you havent heard from a chair yet -- especially because many (if not most) schools havent started their semester yet."
college,fdfmvfz,t1_fdfcpoj,1578365370.0,"Emailing a dean before hearing back from a chair is precisely the kind of karen power move you'd expect from a student nowadays. In fact, why not just email a provost/vp?  Go straight to the manager's manager!"
nextfuckinglevel,fcmjz55,t1_fcm4ttc,1577778373.0,"If you listen to the interview of Jack Wilson, they identified this shooter as soon as he walked in as someone to watch -- they even had a camera trained on him the whole time. That 2nd guy shot was a member of the security team who was literally seated behind him in order to prevent what happened.  He obviously failed.

A gun doesn't protect you -- training, preparation, spacing, luck.... and a gun protects you.  That 2nd guy KNEW what might happen and still wasnt able to draw in time.   99.99% of encounters like this, even if you're armed to the teeth, you will very likely be caught unawares, have poor reaction time,  and then only luck will save you.

So it;s not that ""good guys with guns"" don't do shit, it's that for a lot of people  it's still not as strong a guarantee of safety as total disarmament. Of course, since that that is obviously not going to happen in America, those of us in high risk shooting zones live with the possibility of a shooting death pretty much all the time.  I'm holding out for government provided body armor."
UCONN,fbwtkb4,t1_fbwq07k,1577159055.0,"Yes, let the salt flow through you. 

Bro, all your posts are basically drugs and complaining about school.  Hey I'm happy that you're finally getting your BA/BS in your mid twenties and hope your life isn't ruined by your obvious drug habit.

As for my life, I wouldn't change a thing. Sure, I'll probably never make more than $100k p/year, but I work 3 hours a day, have summers off,  AND I have tenure. I LOVE my job and haven't worked a day since I stepped into a classroom.  Teaching is my joy. Enjoy being whatever it is you want to be.

Anyways, I can do this literally all day.  You're like a salt mine."
