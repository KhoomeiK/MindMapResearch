And never once did I say it was not unhealthy. It is possible, however, for him to see where she's coming from and figure things out together from there.

Sometimes people get engaged to the wrong person, and this could well be the case. She could be crazy as fuck. But sometimes people's insecurities come out in bizarre ways, and that can be handled in less extreme ways. It's easy to judge the imperfections in a relationship from way out here with limited info. Assuming it's some fetish she's trying to force on him, which is an even more domineering and fucked up thing to do, is quite a leap with the little info we have.

And again, I'm not at all saying he should ignore his discomfort and coddle her. But she could easily be saying to herself ""why am I insisting on this??"" even as she's doing it."

It seems like OP was so put off by the idea that he might not have been all that reassuring about the fact that it has nothing to do with her looks, especially if his tone conveyed how thoroughly off-put he really is.

Sometimes it's all about wording. Like when I someone asks ""how do I look? Does my outfit work?""  Even though the person responding might not think much of it and just say ""yeah, that outfit's fine"" and that might be enough for some people, other people want to hear ""you look great, that looks so good on you."" The asker would be especially dissatisfied with a ""you look fine"" if the lack of enthusiastic response suddenly makes them embarrassed about asking in the first place.

Sure, it's weird, irrational, and insecure, but sometimes people are weird, irrational, and insecure. I personally would find this kind of thing exhausting, but maybe she's worth it."

You might be peddling that this is a communication issue stemming from understandable stress, but I'm not buying it. If he's clinging to booze this hard at such a critical time, I'd be willing to bet he *can't* stop.

OP, I'd be thinking beyond the delivery room if I were you. You're going to want a partner that's present and capable for a lot longer than that."

Would it though? American pop is pretty big among non-English speaking people all over the world, and I'm pretty sure they don't feel the need to learn English to sing along with the sounds they hear. And how many people do you think have sung Dragostae Din Tei (aka ""the numa numa song"") and completely butchered the Romanian? There's nothing disrespectful about enjoying a song. Hell, English-speaking Americans sing English language music in other *accents* like jibberish all the time. It does not mean they're disrespecting shit, most people just aren't as uptight and weirdly possessive about something like that."
