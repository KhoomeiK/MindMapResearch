The general attitude they have in regards to live and let live would at the very least not hinder my ability to rebuild a foundation for a life. And in this I do speak from experience. The ability to live out of your car for a few months, and then upgrade to a pullbehind rv that you park in some unused rural land is a lifesaver, in a place such as LA or sanfran (going to ignore the drug and crime aspect) any foundation you do build up will in very short order be removed by the same people who talk the game about being for human rights.

science,fc4toki,t1_fc4shq3,1577428019.0,"The words ""very plausible"" are very subjective, and I agree that there is quite a bit of hinky stuff done due to reasons that range from idiocy, malice and profit. 

But when treatments such as this get approved given the state it is in well... it adds credibility to other like claims in the eyes of many people. Now as for that fluoride thing well, there are two aspects of that claim that get conflated together.
    
 One is if fluoride being placed in the water is being done intentionally for the effects it may have on the citizenry. Which if we were to use this abortion reversal treatment as a gauge of the capability and intentions of decision makers it...does not dissuade me of the possibility that the powers that be would not attempt this out of an act of malice, stupidity or profit. Seriously things like this treatment do kinda give the impression that the powers that be do not have our best interests at heart.
    
And the other is if it actually can impair neurological development. Some googling on this topic can find some interesting reading on the effects of fluoride on neurological development but the anti conspiracy types tend to dispute the validity of those studies."

Still when you break it down the main problem with solar is energy storage, I can have 200 panels but they tend not to do much with moonlight. Unfortunately no means of energy storage is very efficient when you consider longer term use and the one advantage hydrogen fuel cells would have in this is that you can harvest peek unused energy and set it away in a medium that is significantly less prone to discharge."
