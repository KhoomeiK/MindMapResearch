educationalgifs,fdx0yay,t1_fdwzrmi,1578764203.0,"Oh dope! Did Alfred have a strong emphasis on traditional ceramics? When I went to Rolla, they really only went into basic chemistry and the various processing methods for traditional to help set up studying advanced ceramics. Or maybe that's just all that I remember."
educationalgifs,fdwyh1s,t1_fdws9s5,1578763535.0,Hey! Another ceramic engineer! Rolla or Alfred?
CHIBears,fdsb3c4,t1_fdrbg5t,1578698522.0,"Honestly, all running schemes are basic. There's only so many (effective) run plays to be made. The issue was just the execution of the OL (and WRs), and Montgomery's vision isn't very good. Almost every play someone was screwing up their blocking assignment, and, if not, Monty was hesitant to hit collapsing gaps or gaps that haven't fully developed yet. In his eyes, an ugly gap was no gap at all but clean gaps are rare in the NFL."
CHIBears,fdsa7bo,t1_fdrrre6,1578697919.0,But that's 2-3 yards more than another back could have gotten which is commendable.
CHIBears,fdsa0jl,t1_fdrra89,1578697793.0,His vision was actually pretty bad tbh.
CHIBears,fds9tm6,t1_fdrr9u7,1578697665.0,"I feel like break away speed is overvalued for a running back, but Montgomery's vision is pretty suspect, which is a concern. Especially with this mediocre at best line, he's gonna have to identify ugly gaps sooner and hit them with more conviction. 

And his physical attributes are just okay, but that is not why they drafted him or think he will be great. What makes him exciting is his contact balance and angry running. He just doesn't stop. The way in which he has turned 5 yard gains into 10 yard gains is really a sight to behold. 

So, yes, his tangibles are definitely replaceable, but his attitude is something special."
CHIBears,fdmnx05,t1_fdmkdd8,1578557344.0,"I was watching some videos of a guy breaking down the Bears run game by watching how the line was blocking to determine which type of run play it was and what the RB's reads are from that. And, well, Montgomery's vision is a little suspect. He primarily struggled with the pacing and not well blocked gaps. Inside zone being a prime example where he was quick to abandon his first read (play side B gap) if it wasn't blocked perfectly or if the gap wasn't there immediately. He was also slow at times hitting the gap in power. 

His vision and pacing did improve towards the end of the season which is promising and will (hopefully) continue to improve as he becomes more experienced and accustomed to nfl blocking, however, he was definitely making rookie mistakes.

This does not absolve the oline however. It was rare that there entire line held good blocks across the board for the entire play. They often gave up on blocks before the whistle and really struggled with the timing on double teams and when to release to linebackers. Which piles onto Montgomery's vision issues because the d lineman anchoring well against the double teams screws with gap positioning and sizing, one of the o linemen releases early leaving the other in poor position to sustain the block, or one of the linemen releases too late and Montgomery had to make a decision based on a linebacker that is not blocked yet.

But once Monty is passed the line of scrimmage, he's exciting to watch and shows a lot of promise and instincts."
nfl,fcso03y,t1_fcslra4,1577920769.0,"YBC is very much so a RB and oline stat, and it's difficult to separate RB and oline in stats but the people who have developed a methodology to minimize the correlation have found that the Bears oline is the 4th worst in the league. So the fact that the YBC is so high would imply that Montgomery was making people miss in the hole."
nfl,fcsi89d,t1_fcs9gjp,1577916998.0,"That stat doesn't tell the whole story though because the Bears run blocking was ranked 29th in the league. They were constantly being pushed off the line of scrimmage, getting beat, and failing to get to the second level. Montgomery averaging higher yards before contact per attempt was not because he had a better oline than other RBs."
nfl,fcrus0m,t1_fcrjxvb,1577906890.0,Don't be shitting in Montgomery. That dude makes moves when he isn't dealing with one or more D linemen in the backfield. That just so happened to be damn near every run.
CHIBears,fcrbfpl,t1_fcr3jet,1577899530.0,He's scheduled for hip surgery this off season for a labrum tear. That's far more likely why he didn't play much or well.
CHIBears,fcpb5kz,t1_fcp0m6c,1577856837.0,Not agreeing with op but he looks like he would be a meth head if he wasn't in the pros.
CHIBears,fcpb22i,t1_fcoxxjz,1577856738.0,"I don't think his anxiety is crippling. If it was, I don't think he would have been a key player for the eagles or even make it to the pros. This whole anxiety thing is blown out of proportion unless something rattled him to the core during the off season or late last year. Which can very well happen, I just don't think that is what happened."
CHIBears,fcpa8u6,t1_fcoyzvt,1577855919.0,Didn't r/nfl constantly bring up that turnovers are not sustainable/predictable on a year to year basis. We probably would have seen a similar defense with fangio if he stayed. Last year's defense also allowed those similar drives
technicallythetruth,fcnwk2q,t1_fcn0qt7,1577819878.0,"No one in this immediate chain of comments nor the original post said anything about it being stupid. The idea that's trying to be conveyed is that, for many, it is a desperate act to better one's situation. Your last paragraph is your own bias of how you think people perceive the situation over what was actually said."
CHIBears,fcmi89w,t1_fcmbzaz,1577776305.0,"I've had a couple people say that Trubisky's God awful pocket awareness made the Bears ""average"" oline look worse than what they were."
CHIBears,fcmi3so,t1_fcm3wrs,1577776159.0,How does being a 1st rounder change his development compared to being a 2nd rounder? He got the same number of college snaps regardless. Correlation/causation and such
CHIBears,fclc7xz,t1_fcl7fad,1577744460.0,"And yet they dominated the saints. Grossman being exposed, and them still making the Superbowl proves my point. The quarterback is not the end all be all. You can still have a fantastic team with a shit QB. 

When a ball hits your hands, you can catch it. End of story. It's a football cliche because it is a fact. The only reason the line looked average in terms of metrics is because they played a quick pass game. There wasn't enough time for the line to fuck up. And Wilson is far better than competent. He is elite, specifically for his ability to scramble and make plays. Of course Mitch looks like shit next to him, the majority of the league would. And even when Trubisky does throw a good screen, the WRs either can't hold a block or run into a DB. And I honestly doubt any Bear QB would have been shit in this offense."
CHIBears,fcl5n03,t1_fcky58r,1577740331.0,"Ooooohh excuse me, third best team in the league. Grossman played great for the first 6 games of the year, got scouted out, and was dogshit for the rest of his career. He may have had as many 100 passer rating games as Manning that year, but he also had far more below 40. He's worse than Trubisky. It just doesn't feel like it because 2006 actually had a running game that could move the chains. 

Mitch didn't waste the season single handedly. The offense did. Receivers dropping the ball when it hits them in the hands isn't his fault. Receivers and linemen failing to block damn near every play isn't his fault. Running backs running to the sidelines instead of up field isn't his fault. Calling failed screen after failed screen isn't his fault. The offense was trash, and he's a major reason why. But he is far from the only reason why the Bears offense was so inept. 9 of the other 10 players contributed to that title as well."
CHIBears,fckpjpp,t1_fckmqre,1577730416.0,"Was the cap an issue when Glennon was signed? I don't remember. But the primary job of the GM is to find quality starters and I think he has effectively done that (minus oline and qb) through the draft and free agency. My biggest gripe about him is that built a team that is centered around a certain play style, but then goes ahead and hires a head coach who prefers a different style scheme."
CHIBears,fcklwv1,t1_fckl7i0,1577728184.0,Yeah. His statement was if the quarterback is bad then the team is bad. The Bears were the 2nd best team in the league with arguably the worst quarterback.
CHIBears,fckhkmq,t1_fckh8vf,1577725491.0,That's fair. Each aspect of the offense brought down the other aspects of the offense. It was like complimentary football of poop.
CHIBears,fckg8io,t1_fckfgsw,1577724638.0,"Green Bay played predominantly dime package the 2nd time around and the run game still went nowhere. They essentially sold out to stop the pass and was still stuffing the run. I like Monty, but the blocking just was not there the whole season"
CHIBears,fckey5y,t1_fck8u6y,1577723817.0,"Hindsight says it was a dumb move. Was it mind bogglingly? Only for some. But I don't think Pace should be fired for it. It is the GM's job to build a quality locker room for the head coach to develop, and I think he has succeeded in that. The Bears have more good/potentially good players than bad players. It is up to the coaching staff to make use of that. 

Plus I don't think it's wise to fire a GM over one dumb QB draft. Let him prove he has learned from his mistake."
CHIBears,fckdlq8,t1_fck8kjd,1577722951.0,"It is not end of story. I have watched the bears drag Rex Grossman to a Superbowl, and Grossman was way worse of a quarterback than Trubisky. QB is the most important position, but it isn't the only position. People put too much stock in a quarterback. Just look at the colts. They had 2 Hall of Fame caliber QBs back to back and have one Superbowl to show for it because there wasn't a team around them."
CHIBears,fck5khn,t1_fcjylzq,1577717223.0,"What does any of that have to do with another player making him look better? I agree he hasn't looked good, but who on the team can you say has made Trubisky look better, minus Robinson. 9/11 players on the offense have been unacceptably awful all season, with only 1 being actually good. Trubisky is bad but so was the rest of the offense. And, no, the rest of the offense was bad because they played bad. He just added onto the pile of shit.

And, dude, calling him Lenny is fucked. Lmao"
CHIBears,fck4nco,t1_fck3olg,1577716469.0,"Trubisky wouldn't be as good as Mahomes in KC because he doesn't have that ridiculous arm strength. As for any development of trubisky and seeing the field as well as Mahomes, I don't know. 

What I do know is the bears have never developed a good quarterback for as long as I have been alive and decades before that. An unpolished quarterback going to the bears team, especially a bad bears team, is at an extreme disadvantage compared to going anywhere else in the league, except for maybe the browns at this point."
CHIBears,fcjiyx9,t1_fcjhn0n,1577689418.0,"That's a fair point, but what are you questioning about him? He is athletic, runs hard, and can make people miss in the hole. The only thing I don't know about him is his vision, but that's because the line was so bad this year that I don't if he wasn't seeing the holes available or if there were actually any holes to hit."
CHIBears,fcjhzny,t1_fciuqm4,1577688323.0,He would also lose games by himself. You could not trust him with the ball in his hands with 3 minutes to go.
CHIBears,fcjhvpn,t1_fcixt1m,1577688203.0,"If he knew what was going on all the time he wouldn't have thrown so many ints. Not defending Trubisky, but Cutler consistently threw game losing interceptions through his career. People look at him with rose tinted glasses. There's a reason the Bears dropped him."
CHIBears,fcjhk74,t1_fcjf148,1577687854.0,Are you really questioning Montgomery? He and Robinson are the only bright spots on the offense. What you saw today is him when he is not getting hit from behind the line of scrimmage every play.
CHIBears,fcjh4pq,t1_fcjd3k1,1577687396.0,And everyone makes Mitch worse (except for Robinson)
CHIBears,fcjh17n,t1_fcjbcre,1577687295.0,"Nobody, that I have seen, has said Watson would be just as bad. And the talk about Mahomes being just as bad has far more to do with the fact that he got sit behind a quality quarterback who was willing to teach him the ins and outs of the offense and with Andy Reid coaching him up, instead of being thrown into the dumpster fire that is the Chicago Bear's offense his rookie year. 

Now if we transplant ""now"" Mahomes in for Trubisky, yeah, he'd be far superior, without a doubt. Throw him in with the bears offense his rookie year and learn the way Trubisky learned, I'm willing to bet he wouldn't be the Mahomes we see today. Would he be better? Yeah probably, just not the superstar."
MurderedByWords,f5hkb6n,t1_f5h7ugu,1572205315.0,"I am 100% with you on everything you just said. I absolutely agree, but at what point does the bastardization of the meaning of a word become the accepted meaning of the word? Because these power hungry liars of the Republican party are who conservatives (generally speaking) are voting for, and they have been election after election. So conservative voters (again, generally speaking) believe that these Republican elected officials represent conservative views, right? That's not too far of a stretch to make.

So with that being said, I will continue to think that the Republican party represents conservative views, no matter how bastardized they are, until conservatives vote otherwise."
