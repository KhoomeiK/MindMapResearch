wartrade,ffb88uv,t1_ffb3vf0,1579754717.0,Sooooooo fucking jealous. My dojo founder got a 60% toxic and I was both dying of jealousy and happy he got it. Lol his GT has toxic literally in it so it’s fair I suppose. Mainly sad it’s only if my last Kuva weapons to get at all STILL
weed,ffawwqy,t1_ffatof2,1579746384.0,"Shit I just took some bud when the guy owed me money but besides bicing (9:10 on accident or cause they always have mine anyway lol) 

But really came to say there’s a big ass difference between bicing someone time to time and straight robbing them for a drug habit. Which I can’t recall a time someone was proud of doing"
wartrade,ffawnqy,t3_esi0gm,1579746218.0,I could be wrong as I’m on XB1 but I’m like 96% sure that’s worth more than that
wartrade,ffawjir,t1_ffaleh8,1579746139.0,Just to add to that what levels are you testing that at? I’d throw some high ass level noxs and this sounds wrong but bombers? Been taking a break on other games while signing in and occasional missions lol. But I’d test that on lvl 85’s and 120’s
NotHowDrugsWork,ffahj7d,t1_ffahbm5,1579735878.0,"Lol “technically” I was investing in a return with the side benefit of being high as a kite or ya know... kinda high due to tolerance usually...  so as much as I was buying something I was more investing in a small business. And once again technically the amount varied but yes I was putting money into an exchange for something else so it’s not a heavy technicality. 

Also sometimes I spent enough the prior month it wasn’t every month if I could help it. Trafficking felonies and all. 

As fun as this was I hope ya have a good one and I’m out"
Warframe,ffagr47,t3_es4m2o,1579735369.0,Lol the little red ones on the right side
NotHowDrugsWork,ffag5cq,t1_ffaftmn,1579734969.0,"Eh. I mean I guess if you wanna clarify where your lost I can explain whatever

Shit I mean I spent that money and made x2-x5 in return despite smoking like a chimney"
NotHowDrugsWork,ffafnw1,t1_ffa8gqb,1579734641.0,Technically was the number. I invested a couple grand originally and started making money and after that it’s hard to say I was just buying some weed lol. And though I smoked almost all day every day for awhile I was profiting doing so. Good times.
NotHowDrugsWork,ffa4lkf,t1_ff9pfzt,1579727773.0,"In one setting? That’s not “absolutely absurd” at all. I did it with a friend more than once. I also technically spent thousands on weed a month. But I mean... we started as broke ass kids who liked weed and ended up making bank talking about weeding and sharing it. 

So I’m completely acknowledging it’s not normal or average and I’ve found out some can’t smoke a GRAM in one setting but it’s also very feasible. 


Last thing I promise: he didn’t technically say he smoked it alone and half an ounce (if it was at all fallowing stoner etiquette would assume they share and or pass) is less out there"
wartrade,ff92qa2,t1_ff8er89,1579703399.0,"What riven did you take sell like that unrollled?!??? 

Also Kuva farming is stupid easy with almost any saryn and a good limbo with a good build and 2 free frames a squad preferably one being Necros. And of course a smeeta and booster if possible. 

I’d add 50 rolls seems a bit much for an average for it being well sellable. I’ve rolled some more but I usually get a decently sellable one in about 20 some rolls but I’ve had idk only about 90-100 rivens and 2-3 MAYBE grolls lol"
wartrade,ff7o1nf,t1_ff7n9pr,1579654167.0,Also I mean... id re-roll for sure with the Kohm. It’s sold for 2-3k with a good roll on XB1 and not even a god roll. So taking it for 250 is yikes. Then again it could roll forever and never be worth that but a good roll is worth the chance I personally think anyway
wartrade,ff7nu5b,t1_ff7lrcf,1579654019.0,lol oh yeah the app in general is amazing. Just can’t open it while the game is open
wartrade,ff7lm9l,t1_ff7hb45,1579652479.0,Screen shots off the app is probably the easiest way to do that. Most forget it’s a thing and I just found fairly recently it shows rivens
Warframe,ff7em8s,t1_ff6ykqz,1579647769.0,Not always. Wisp doesn’t care at all and volts good for it too. A couple others maybe. But I like making wisp special Zaws all in favor of damage and crit or status
NarutoShinobiStriker,ff6vai0,t1_ff6uibm,1579635610.0,"Lmao that’s fair though I’m 90% sure evening elephant would require “paying the price” as he couldn’t use it much at full power without taking serious damage and after his gate closed he was completely incapacitated. 

And I can’t lie I rewatch it every year or two but his moves I rarely remember. Night guy is the hardest to forget in the moment no one could deny he was a badass like always but ya with the names as he just shouts something usually and kicks in the springtime of youth lol"
wartrade,ff6sd0k,t3_erteaa,1579633878.0,Almost forgot. I’m curious how you made a spread like that you could post as a single image
NarutoShinobiStriker,ff6sb2n,t1_ff6pj7f,1579633847.0,"Lol okay jeez... it’s good if it’s one of the 3 and people are amused enough to pay for it or if the others are good and not exactly saying they needed it either but I mean unless his “jutsu” is swing nunchucks with low ass cool down time he doesn’t have a lot of options as he actually didn’t use ninjutsu and taijutsu is basic hand to hand. Hell tbh his moves shouldn’t be anything special and his basic play AS Might Guy should be a buffed to all hell.

Again this “so you think they should-“ no no no no. Buuuut he’s been on more than a few people’s wish list even though he’s not a ninja with a bunch of fancy jutsus. And that makes him sellable so anything but the worst outcome should make him sell alright. He’s the 3rd so far this season I want and first that’s not a healer. I guess I just don’t see the hate"
NarutoShinobiStriker,ff6owpo,t1_ff6hoe9,1579631815.0,Idk about waste but mainly I loved dynamic entry in older games mainly as a laugh your ass off assist. His other should be a buff for speed and attack with longer active times and cool down than lees move maybe?

pokemongo,ff31sqj,t1_ff2wixn,1579531426.0,I’d trade 5 shiny tauros for one perfect heracross
Warframe,ff31hgm,t1_ff0xc12,1579531175.0,Modernly speaking we’re lazy especially for those of us that it’s our only fluent langue and to add to that many got accustomed to short hand from their profession or waaay back in the old days (and some rare services today) charged per text character rather than per message.
trees,ff31477,t1_ff2jv26,1579530879.0,You CAN make them quality/safe enough but then your getting into time and money when the set go enough most will probably realize it’s easier to get a cheap quality $20 one online. I just like making things but smoking plastic aluminum and many other things are so extra bad for you
wartrade,fehc0p9,t1_feh493j,1579113451.0,"They count as their own if there isn’t an existing weapon for it prior its release like the Ayanga, twin Stubba, etc but kohm karak Tonkor etc. use the original rivens"
NarutoShinobiStriker,fegk7li,t1_feg6iwr,1579095262.0,He was reanimated from the first to last time you saw him. He could fight. At worse it’s forced combat with a necro’d child. Which has its own moral lines to cross. Sounds neat though for abilities discussion
weed,fegjte9,t1_feghpc7,1579094937.0,It’ll make Mexicans rape our women and blacks will thirst for white blood- with one hit of the reefer. I can’t see how the fuck these are actual old political propaganda but shit worked and it got voted out

weed,fed60ah,t1_fecw03p,1579000580.0,I swear that’s how most people start. If not they’re often having it just to extend the list of what they can provide and go all in dealing. But that’s just what I’ve noticed personally
weed,fed5wtc,t1_fed43l0,1579000447.0,It’s a trick see. Ya never let yourself run out of weed. Then again if people have problems you dry up when everyone else actually does and see how it goes. Might even up prices just cause. Lol I’ve seen that shit. Helps being one of the only people with legal state bud and one who doesn’t go 20 a g all the way up for it like a ****

wartrade,feb9ke6,t3_eo3xh6,1578956615.0,Thag Kohm is perfect on a few levels and what I’d give for It on XB1 lol. Definitely don’t go under 100 and try for 2. Hate the Seer though it’s a nice stat so ya know
Warframe,feb8or4,t1_feac5pb,1578956436.0,I had them only until the patch came out that removed duplicates. After 4 in I asked my clan if anyone would trade so I didn’t get another. Just started trading them off for any other weapon stats didn’t matter
weed,feb7wil,t1_fe9r807,1578956187.0,He said $500 variance so probably closer to 1000-1500 MAYBE 2000

jumpforce,feb4n9q,t1_feasd3c,1578955353.0,Lol if half the characters where accurate to their power the whole roster would be blown away. Most can destroy planets or countries single handed and if not a city. The others have gimmicks that could help win if they started the fight. But I mean it wouldn’t be Gokus first time blowing up a planet and or Instant transmissioning off it’s unlikely he’d do it to earth... maybe a Kai planet lol

Warframe,fe5ycyz,t1_fe3rlha,1578877682.0,It’d also expand maps to insane levels. Then again... it could be an ability? Hopefully no attack on titan flashbacks for anyone but I mean... frames do weird things than get big and super sizing would easily be a 4th ability level thing. x2 damage x3 range
Warframe,fe5xt7q,t1_fe57zqi,1578877337.0,"Lmao my bad 7 days and one “free day” from standing carrying over. I just remember it happening stupid fast compared to any other and I got lazy and put a few medallions in. It’s been a minute but good catch. I just remembered smashing through without trying to hard thanks to races counting which I hadn’t known about if it was around when I started

Edit: funny part is I swear it was only like 4-5 days which math says isn’t possible but I had just bought and leveled my k-drives to get them out the way and it was R4"

Gloves depend on the type of welder though it’s good for all eye protection is FAR more important and if anything dropped in those open toed sandals...  also I was learning and practicing on a family farm with proper welding mask hence the biggest and long term issue part (as all the other comments say, sandpaper against the eyes pain and blindness plus a spark could literally hit your eyes) and it wasn’t a business. 

No way I’d accept this insurance liability where on the farm I’d either keep my mouth shut if it wasn’t serious enough or just say there was an accident none of your business at the hospital if need be as insurance wouldn’t be involved to complicate things."

I can’t lie I probably will leave it once I get the Kohm until major reworks happen then I’ll hunt the last couple other guns and ephemeras.
