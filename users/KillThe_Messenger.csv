The movie is about the fundamental uncertainty and unknowability of another’s consciousness."
todayilearned,fdsbrow,t1_fdsafuf,1578698972.0,Lol. Alright. Refer to above regarding religious people and their inability to doubt.

Because I’m *yuge*"
Stellaris,fdqsof7,t3_emsr79,1578674037.0,"What part of the fight with the crisis do you fail at?

Do you hemorrhage ships and are unable to replace them? Do you have the economy to support a constant stream of new ships but not the facilities? Do you have the facilities but not the alloys to keep them churning out new craft?

If you’re just straight up losing fights without inflicting any losses on the enemy then composition is your problem.

If you’re winning fights but losing ground then you need to work on the shape and defensive posture of your empire. What does your economy look like? How high and what is the usage level of your fleet cap? Is every fleet headed up by one or ideally two Titans that offer different combat bonuses?

The AI, and particularly the Crisis AI, is not very smart so it’s trivial to work on containment and slow attrition to their expeditionary fleets."
todayilearned,fdqm8xh,t1_fdqlvnt,1578670016.0,"So what evidence did you find to convince you of god then?

See this is why we call out religious faith, because bad actors like yourself can’t even be honest about what you believe or why you believe it."
todayilearned,fdqhzn4,t1_fdnw3q3,1578667144.0,">	As a Christian I try not to have blind faith in anything. If I’m going to trust in something its because I’ve put it to the test and found that it works.

So how do you reconcile your faith, morals and the fact that you so readily just lie?"
todayilearned,fdnuaze,t1_fdnu6gp,1578592980.0,"God, Jesus, heaven all that stuff."
insanepeoplefacebook,fdnu5f2,t1_fdntq46,1578592889.0,"Yeah because social conservatism defines itself through conflict against civil rights.

At a fundamental level you can’t be conservative and a decent person."
todayilearned,fdntnzr,t1_fdntg78,1578592611.0,"So you don’t believe in any of the core Christianity stuff then?

But I rather suspect this is the typical sort of dishonest reframing of the issue I expect from your sort."
AmItheAsshole,fdntavz,t1_fdkb07a,1578592403.0,"Ah yes using the walk up window in a way that is clearly exploitative and not supported by them or by local authorities(otherwise they would have put in parking) makes the assholes you’re apologizing for totally ok.

I hate that this sub is infested with people like you who will always forgive the actual assholes and make it a virtue to be quiet and allow the real assholes to take advantage of everyone."
insanepeoplefacebook,fdnt2cb,t1_fdnqep1,1578592267.0,"No, it really isn’t. And you’re operating with some special stupid sauce yourself if you think they are the same thing.

These people hate minorities because of *who they are*. I hate them because of the consistently shitty behaviour they display.

Fuck off"
todayilearned,fdnh486,t1_fdndzdt,1578585680.0,"It’s their absolute certainty.

To have blind faith is to have certainty, to doubt yourself and always be looking for a more moral path requires constant questioning of your actions and motivations."

AmItheAsshole,f4v6gu5,t1_f4u7eu8,1571837367.0,"Why? They couldn’t even fill the order correctly. They didn’t deserve the business, let alone any sort of extra bonus.

I never tip for pickup."
