exmormon,ff1http,t3_eqxej7,1579479457.0,"I had a srtong identity now i don't know who i am. I gave up every thing that made me, me. I gave it all up because i thought thats what god wanted. I'll never get my youth back or my fun spirt. I'm just another boring mom now. Im so angry and sad. I hate that they push young people to have kids right away. My husband is 10 years older then me he got to enjoy his 20s and i was stuck at home having them one after another. I love my husband but even if i wanted to leave him i have 4 kid's no education almost zero job experience. Im scared what will happen if he finds out i no longer believe in the church."

exmormon,fef6mr6,t3_eotpik,1579049422.0,I loved it at first i had agoraphobia and this one old lad would drag me to church. She was amazing i still don't know how someone at her age has so much life in her. I was the only youth in my area and i loved all the old people they were funny as hell and didn't judge me at all helped me get my GED. Really they saved my life and all always be grateful for that but when i got married my new ward was different the old lady were vary judgmental not all. Some ladys were really cool. I really liked hearing there stores during relief society. The woman my age i had nothing in common with. I got prego with 3 month of are marriage. I go postpartum and depressed my agoraphobia would flair up. I started to hate it my husband would help at all with anything. I'm 30 just had my 4th and last c-section because i had a heart attack during it. It it weren't for that we probably would heve kept trying to have kids. I love my kids they are perfect but it is hard being solely responsible for the entire family then force everyone to got they don't want to in clothes no one wants to wear with mental and physical issues on top of it. Im so glad i stopped guilt training myself because im fucking amazing!!!!

If he's a predator it would be better make him feel like your not worth the risk and if you make a scene in the the store. he'll be scared of all the attention. Don't be embarrassed to make a scene in the store straight just call the cop right in front of him and let them know your being harassed see how fast he drops his stuff and high tails it out of there.

exmormon,fdiqvza,t3_elh27a,1578449021.0,Im not a 17 year old im 30 year old mom of 4. I was not born in the church but i was given the book of mormon and prayed and i felt the holy ghost. And for me im an all or nothing type of person so i whent hard. Got married to a man at the time was a 100% in love with because the holy ghost told me he was the one. We got married in the temple i did everything i was supposed to do. I have cptsd from extreme and prolonged abuse as a child i also have agoraphobia. I just don't fit in and i can't be social in the way the others are i just don't have the skills. When i shake hand i cringe at physical touch from strangers. But i new the church was true. I thought god know me and want's me to be happy like them so put my all into it but i just can't be like them. When i try to tell my husband all have a panic attack he shames me into going. I go i have panic attacks he blames me that we all have to go home. Anyway there's only so much misery you can through. I started questioning my faith and my first experience so i did it again and i felt it again then i prayed that the church was a lie and Joseph smith was not a prophet guess what i also felt the holy ghost. So now im life what do i do. Do i even still believe in god. Im totally terrified mybe  it was the devil playing tricks on me. But them i looked up all the lies and discrepancys. And with all that there's this pice of me that wants to hold on to it. I just don't know.
exmormon,fdim1h7,t3_elbxkk,1578445913.0,Tell him that its been hard on you and you fasted and prayed and the lord told you to stop doing this calling. He's either has to say no to god or call you a liar.

It was hard and i thought about taking my life a lot when i was house bound but i was afraid of surviving and waking up in a hospital. I have times where i can do a lot and sometimes i struggle with going out. This month i only felt once but i never never go alone i use my husband as a security blanket. Last month i did really well i left 4 time.  I pretty much just force myself to do it. I do have a trick for places that i have to do like traveling we live outside the USA and my husband fathers died unexpectedly in October so i had to go support my husband. So what i do is i say to myself im going to the parking but im not going in. When we get there i say to myself im just going inside then im leaving, then baggage check then security then bording. Yeah the more you let it slip the harder it is. Im extremely lucky i have a support system. I have people that give me the right amout of push."

Agoraphobia,fc6zhwz,t3_egdhrs,1577493521.0,Even though im a bit better and can do more i still feel like that i cant seem to make friends or feel normal. I feel like i just don't belong. I don't think these things get easier. I have people willing to help and who want to be my friend and i just cant do it. I can start off okay but eventually its just to much me then i feel guilty and i get this idea that they hate me and I'v spend so much time not talking to them i don't even try anymore. I leave my house ine to two times a month and that's really hard for me. I moved into a new area with my family during a time i was doing well and got into a mommy group. I was so excited and everyone was so nice. But they meet every single week and it was just way too much for me so i slowly just stopped going. I had intentions of going back wants i felt a little better but then i accidentally hurd one them talking badly about me and i just can't. Everything they said total fit my behavior and there was no way for them to know. Why i stopped coming. Iv also have had people that I'v made friends with show up at my house and that always freaks me out. So what i did is i just started to tell people that i have agoraphobia and what i am and are not comfortable with. They seem to be a lot more understanding sorry for ranting didn't know i needed to get that off my chest. Good luck
