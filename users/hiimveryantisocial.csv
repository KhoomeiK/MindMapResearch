AskReddit,fdg59gd,t3_ekwlzh,1578380548.0,"My mom has an extremely abusive boyfriend. After a really bad physical altercation, my mother was resting in my room, my sister in hers, and the boyfriend in the garage smoking a cigarette. 
Next thing I know as I’m dozing off to sleep (this was at 2:00am) I start to smell gasoline. 
This SOB had left the door leading into the garage open, turned the car on and left it running in the closed garage, and was trying to suffocate us all. 
My mom kicked him out for a while but not even two weeks went by until she let him back in. I’m furious. 
This all took place Dec. 29. 2019"

After that focus on finding any place that will hire you. Get that job, get those checks, you’ll be okay. You’re not failure, you’re just going through a rough time. Happens to the best of us. You got this !"
offmychest,fdfy1td,t3_ekyalq,1578373402.0,"Dang that got me. 
I can’t imagine how bad this must be affecting you mentally but don’t let it be a gray filter on your world. You didn’t kill her. You were the kindest person in the world to her and you had one angry outburst. 
I would recommend seeing a counselor or therapist every now and then. It’ll be good to get some professional help on learning how to cope with this. 
Best of luck to you man"

relationship_advice,fdfvy9f,t3_el275u,1578371666.0,There’s no easy way to tell any of them. But it’s a big thing that’ll change everyone’s lives forever so you have to be completely honest with them about it. Sit them down (individually) and let them know what the doctors have said. It’ll be emotional and hard but at least when the time comes they’ll be at least somewhat prepared.
