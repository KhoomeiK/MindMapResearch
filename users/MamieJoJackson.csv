I really can't stand when women of a certain age say nasty things about young women who are just doing the exact things said older women wish they either did when they were younger, or could still do. 

I'm so, so happy this lovely lady hasn't lost her youthful spirit. She's a treasure."

It is very, very difficult not to beat some ass when you see the state of many of the animals, especially the carriage horses. I read a story about a year or so ago about one guy getting arrested because he was caught roadside beating his carriage horse to death when it couldn't make it up this very steep hill. Fucking abhorrent. Not to mention all the molestation and incestuous rape, but that's a tale for another day."
