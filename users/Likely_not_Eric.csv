For still images, though, PNG is likely a better format: it allows multiple encodings that you can select depending on the nature of your image and doesn't suffer from the same pallet restrictions and need for dithering that GIFs require (unless they're in a non-standard form).

But for regular users there just really easy to create: lots of tools were built to make GIF images and while you can do the same stuff with FFMPEG and other tools it's hard to make someone adjust their workflow."

privacy,fcaex5y,t1_fc9q6dl,1577568057.0,"The advantage of DNS-over-HTTPS is that it prevents MITM snooping and alteration. It 120% does improve your privacy with respect to the DNS server you're talking to. It has the same problem that VPNs have: the provider can monitor and alter anything they please and someone between the provider and the source of the information can monitor and modify it. It's only the link between you and the provider is encrypted.

DNS-over-HTTPS is useful if you were already using one of the those providers over plain DNS and you wanted a more secure link to them.

However, few people were doing that so the push to send requests to a small set of US providers with a history of state cooperation is kinda sketchy. Thus I understand the concern for Mozilla partnering with Cloudflare. On the other hand, if I were in Turkey or India I might be more comfortable my ISP unable to snoop/alter my session with Cloudflare and hoping they don't snitch on my to my government.
