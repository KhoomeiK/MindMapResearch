aww,fcxpvmc,t1_fcxpkt0,1578068655.0,"Luckily the pup wonâ€™t grow too big and shouldnâ€™t have to worry about her knocking baby over when she learns to walk and all, pup has been around young children and babies whilst she was still with her mum so shouldnâ€™t have to worry too much"
puppy101,fcxouwf,t1_fcxo9y5,1578068015.0,"I try to let her walk wherever she wants (within reason) if she decides she wanted to walk somewhere sniff something, I bring treats to praise her for walking a certain distance without stopping as well as when she does her business outdoors, i try to walk her for short amounts of time but fairly often (I have a 4 month old baby aswell at home so try to walk the dog after each time I feed the baby) so thereâ€™s less chance of pup having an accident whilst sheâ€™s not house trained."
