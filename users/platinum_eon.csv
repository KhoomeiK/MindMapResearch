college,fee2kk7,t3_eomjwv,1579025079.0,Around 3-5 hours per day. I love organic chemistry so much that the time doesn’t even bother me. I usually stay consistent for 6 days Monday-Friday than Sunday (I like to have Saturday as my day of rest). Only time when the time is less/more is when dealing with other subjects. If it wasn’t for the relaxing Pokémon music out there I’ll probably would’ve forgotten everything
FortNiteBR,fed1o0d,t3_eo5e2a,1578994219.0,"Sorry to say but it’s nearly impossible to reach 500 from your level. You’ll have to level up 11 times PER day just to hit 500. You might want to aim for 350 to get that fully max out 8 ball skin that’s doable since you’ll only need to level up 5 levels PER day. I’ll recommend team rumble since I average out 20k xp per game, knowing to fill up a bar of xp is 8K (since we have 10 bars, it would take 80k total xp to get 1 level up). This results in 4-5 games to get 1 level, since a team rumble game lasts around 15-20 minutes, we can do some calculations if we assume 18 minutes per team rumble game and 5 games (just being nice) so that give us 90 minutes than divide that by 60 (to get our hours) which gives us 1.5 hours. 1.5 times 5 (5 being the levels per day) this gives us 7.5 hours you’ll have to play everyday just to hit 350."
FortNiteBR,fed12yx,t3_eod8yg,1578993367.0,It takes 8K xp to full up 1 bar. There are 10 bars total for a level up. 10 times 8K = 80k. This is even confirm from the stretch goal prestige challenges. Completing one prestige challenges rewards the player with 800k xp resulting in 10 level ups.
FortNiteBR,fed0m4g,t1_fec23i6,1578992700.0,"I heard if you reach 344 it’s fully max out, can you confirm once you hit it?"
FortNiteBR,fe6nb5c,t1_fe6n4od,1578896849.0,Do you think I’ll be able to hit 350? I average out around 20k xp from team rumble
FortNiteBR,fe6n1qk,t1_fe6muuj,1578896572.0,"Strange, when I was researching for the fully virus skin all of them said 300. Even if that’s the case, I’ll be happy enough to get majority of the skin covered"

FortniteFashion,fe6m7iy,t1_fe6j6hn,1578895654.0,I thought it was 300 not 350?

college,fdmmych,t1_fdmm8zk,1578556153.0,"1.9 (by far the worst chem professor I’ve ever had) but due to the class being a summer session I had the opportunity to focus all of my time into the class. Study for 3 hours (sometimes even in lecture), take an hour and 30 min break, and 3 more hours of studying Monday- Friday (I like to have Saturdays as my day off) and a little review on Sunday. Sure my study session where a bit hardcore but since you’re taking the class in a regular semester I’m sure if you fully invest into studying for an hour and 30mins you’ll get the A. I know you didn’t ask but what I did during my those hours of studying was rewriting my notes that I took from the videos (3-4 times) and tell myself “ok what’s going here and how do the concepts get me from point A to point B”. Having some relaxing Pokémon music is always helped me out."
college,fdmlwd8,t3_em60aa,1578554922.0,"Gen chem 2 is IMO way harder than gen chem 1 because of how much equations you needed to understand and some pre calc knowledge. Like many others, I highly recommend watching The Organic chemistry tutor and Khan academy. I took gen chem 2 in the summer and didn’t pay attention to lecture (only showed up for attendance and exams) and I ended up with a B+ (was only 1 point off the A but instead of studying for a final that was worth 33% of my grade i was watching Netflix instead lol) just by strictly watching both of those youtubers. Best of luck!"

DestinyTheGame,fcmlltx,t3_ehz8h2,1577780430.0,You could always have 35 mobility and 100 recovery. With a traction mod and dragon shadow this gives you 100 mobility whenever you dodge. Combine with focus breathing and wraith metal you’re getting infinite doges like crazy. I have tier 4 to almost tier 5 resilience even though it’s useless in pvp.
