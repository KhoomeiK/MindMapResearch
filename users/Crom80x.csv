dogs,fc1mznb,t1_fc0fm6o,1577323650.0,One of my dogs would only fetch well-used tennis balls. Maybe it was a texture thing with new fuzzy balls?

LifeProTips,fbzt8ln,t1_fbzq3da,1577260304.0,How?
dogs,fbzt3ht,t1_fbzpqv8,1577260092.0,That’s super cute. I make their gifts look like garbage and they are usually full of garbage. I think I did some pizza crust one year. Our younger kids get super confused and wonder if it is really from the dogs.
dogs,fbzsy14,t1_fbzri8u,1577259865.0,That’s awesome. Your dogs are classier than my dogs.
