Calgary,ffadjts,t1_ffaa4s6,1579733026.0,"> This question doesn't make sense to me, please rephrase it for me. 

If the O&G companies aren't investing in their own PR to ensure they stay profitable, why should the government (if the company doesn't care, the government shouldn't)?  If this is needed to keep the oil companies profitable, shouldn't it be in their best interest to do it themselves? 

 If the O&G companies are investing in their own PR, why should the government (if they companies are already paying for it, why should the government)?

Pretty straight forward. 

> Is that the bar for success now? The only people who can write  journalistic pieces are direct SMEs? Someone should get Postmedia on the  phone we have a lot of journalists to fire. 

Are they journalistic pieces or are they fact-driven pieces to correct misinformation? Using failed journalists to convey that message isn't good, especially when you're trying to approach it with fact-based legitimacy. 

&#x200B;

> You're misunderstanding the purpose of the CEC here, I've corrected this behaviour above. 

What the intended purpose is, and what the reality is are two different things. The reality is that the the CEC has gotten a lot of negative coverage, and has given information and legitimacy to the very things it's trying to fight, simply by attacking it. 

You're misunderstanding the reality of the CEC, becuase you're focusing on the 'purpose' (which is spurious given who they've put in charge of it).

Which brings us to:

> Its interesting the fixation on the logos. I can respect legitimate  criticism of results but this obsession with manufactured outrage is  leaving the people you want to influence tone deaf to your message.  

Why focus on the logos? Because it's what got press. Negative press. Something people already thought was kind of dumb, did something stupid which dominated the narrative about it. That was bad if the purpose is to reframe the debate. Trying to dismiss it as a non-issue shows how little you're paying attention to how the intended audience reacted to it. The purpose is to win over people, and this isn't how to do it. 

A quick Google search will show what the media is talking about with the CEC, and it isn't their articles (well, aside from their letter telling the Medicine Hat News to publish one of theirs). Not a good look for when you're trying to pump up your legitimacy. 

> I won't hold someones verbal missteps against them, heaven's knows I say  some things that don't quite make sense depending on how much pressure  I'm under. You can certainly do you though. 

When it's somebody's job to clear up misinformation and provide clear communication, I will absolutely hold their communication missteps against them. It's their job. Their *only* job. And they fucked it up in such a comical way, it worked against the 'purpose' of the CEC. Something that was already being treated with derision as a 'government propaganda office' came out and said their job was to disprove true facts. That's absolutely a fuckup worth holding against the CEO of a communication-driven institution. 

Similarly, a company who's purpose is to provide 'journalistic pieces' has in their terms of service that you can't actually link to those articles. Wrap your head around that incompetence. Who discovered they were copying and pasting their terms of service so that you couldn't link to articles (you know, the purpose of the place, apparently)? People who were mocking the CEC and finding as many ways to do it as possible. Further creating the narrative that the CEC shouldn't be taken seriously, which goes against it's purpose. 

If the CEC was a private PR firm and not a government funded one, it would have succumbed to market forces already because they are incompetent."
Calgary,ffa6dnd,t1_ff9qkem,1579728763.0,">So we are to ignore the organized campaign of misinformation that keeps Alberta under the American's thumb on heavy crude? That seems short sighted.

Seems like a job the oil companies PR departments should be doing instead. I wouldn't trust such an important thing with a government operation. 

If the private companies are ignoring it, why should the taxpayers be the ones to do it? If the private companies aren't ignoring it, what the fuck are we wasting $30M on?

If dealing with misinformation is what's important, it shouldn't be run by journalists, it should be run by scientists and industry people countering with cold hard facts, not editorials written by failed journalists (and failed politicians). 

&#x200B;

> The latter part is a benefit not a detriment. So long as there is a  discussion about whats being passed off as fact being questionable its  working as intended. 

No it isn't. It brings more attention to the information they want to suppress. It's giving it more of a platform. 

Medicine Hat News got more hits because the CEC targeted them than they would have had it been ignored. More people saw the editorials, more people agreed with it. That is the opposite of what is intended. Similarly many people had no idea what the 3% Project was until the CEC targeted them. Because it's a government propaganda office, whoever the CEC targets will be seen as far more sympathetic, and by being a target they're also given credibility. 'Big multi-million dollar governement funded mouthpiece attacks young person trying to make the world a better place' becomes the narrative anytime they do that.

That is not ""working as intended.""

&#x200B;

> Good! This is exactly what we should hope for. People seeking out  information rather than accepting whats presented by well known  individuals who don't have a grasp of the subject. Di Caprio for  example. 

So what you're hoping for is people seeking out more information of the thing you're trying to stop? Re-read what I wrote. 

&#x200B;

> You should visit their website and expand your understanding of what they've done so far. 

They've stolen two logos, I'm not allowed to link any of their articles per their TOS, and I now follow an anti-UCP editorial writer from the Medicine Hat news thanks to their information. They also brought more attention to the 3% Project Charity that prompted a donation matching offer by another fund (no CEC information if that fund is also an anti-oil sands operation). They're doing a bang up job. 

They've also publicly stated that their goal is to ""disprove **true** facts."" So yeah, they're on a roll. 

> Please stick to legitimate grievances and not fill the discussion with this conspiratorial noise. 

A legitimate grievance is that it costs $30M a year with no mechanism to see a return on it. In a position where we're calling for tissues and water to be cut to save on budget spending, do I need anything else? Spend $30M a year and maybe our export capacity grows because of factors completely unrelated to the CEC (Supreme Court Decisions allowing pipeline construction), or don't spend $30M and maybe our export capacity grows for the same reasons. But even if things remain status quo, we'd still save $30M by not having it and nothing would change from yesterday or the last five years, and tomorrow and the next five years. 

Another ""legitimate grievance"": The CEC has been completely quiet on Blackrock's CEO talking about the reallocation of investment as a result of climate change. If there were ever a more obvious place to direct the resources of the war room, it would be to that."

You could end up with 14 arts happy injection site pumping ideologues. You could end up with the best council ever that bring in a new golden age.

Add lanes, becomes easier to drive, so more people drive, more development happens further out because the commute time goes down, resulting in even more cars, and therefore more traffic, leaving you with the problem you started with. Induced demand.

If more lanes meant eased off traffic, cities with the most lanes would have the least amount of traffic. The opposite tends to be true, and they pay a fuckton for it. The only way to reduce traffic is to move people to more efficient modes of transit out of their cars. Or fix traffic by reducing the amount of cars, not by making it more appealing for more cars to be on the road."
