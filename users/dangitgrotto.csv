pharmacy,ffbhnun,t1_ffbfp8i,1579765742.0,Thanks. Graduated 2 years ago. Hospital is the side gig. Just found out I can’t do per diem at 2 hospitals so looks like I’m just going to stick to the original plan. Turned down the rxm job already so hopefully I can still float like I have been
pharmacy,ffa3s41,t1_ff9lz8f,1579727310.0,Yep the store you were at. You’ll have to email the form to them and have them sign it and email it back to you. It’s a pain in the ass so I’d bring the form with you in the future and have them sign it the same time they give you floater keys
pharmacy,ff9dzjj,t1_ff8dl10,1579710951.0,I think it has to be the actual store manager not the assistants
pharmacy,ff82h61,t3_ero2ge,1579664248.0,Make sure you get the store manager to sign off on it or they will reject it
pharmacy,ff8240g,t1_ff68tpj,1579663980.0,Ugh. I’m going to lose my precious floating job because all of the managers are stepping down. My DM is basically forcing me to be a manager but I turned it down so now I’m screwed

pharmacy,ff4wbzq,t1_ff4vfd6,1579574007.0,Want? No I didn’t want to but I already gave a few alternatives and couldn’t think of anything else at the time. I didn’t have the guideline in front of me or else I would have suggested a 3rd gen instead of keflex. My mistake
pharmacy,ff2ebji,t3_eqxrei,1579502618.0,"I'm at a crossroad here. Retail floater (64hr) + side gig got me $125k last year. DM said I cant float anymore due to a few rxm stepping down to become floaters and taking my hours. DM offered me a manager position at a store that's an hour away. $136k working 42 hours a week minimum. Other rxms told me they average 45 hours a week. They all tell me not to take the job saying its not worth it. My wife doesn't think I should take it either. I did the math and I'll actually be making basically the same per hour as I am now as a floater

My side gig is willing to give me 2 days a week (10 hour days) at $65 per hour. I landed a per diem gig last week that pays $68 per hour but its only a few days a month at a hospital. Might be able to get another per diem job at a sister location that pays $59 per hour as well

So If I decline the manager offer they will most likely let me go. I can probably get by with the per diems for now until I find something else full time. I will have to pay for insurance out of pocket also since I will lose all of my benefits

I'm about 80% sure I'm going to officially decline the offer tomorrow. I figure I'll post this here hoping to see some outside perspective. Please let me know what you would do in this situation"

PCOS,fezwwyk,t3_eqnlco,1579462732.0,"Yes, pharmacist really do need to ask those questions. Because doctors make mistakes everyday. If a doctor gave you a prescription for metformin and you don’t have diabetes, it’s the pharmacist’s job to make sure you are taking it for a legitimate reason (like having PCOS). So those questions are important to ask. 

I’m a pharmacist and the other day a doctor wrote someone a blood pressure medication with the directions “take one by mouth every day to control blood sugar”. I tried calling the doctor but the office was closed. I had to ask that person if they have diabetes. They said no, and that the blood pressure medication was in fact for blood pressure and they have been taking it for years. Good, problem solved. 

But if they did have diabetes, I obviously wouldn’t have dispensed the blood pressure medication because it would have been harmful.

We ask questions for a reason y’all"

pharmacy,fedr5ju,t1_fedcec4,1579018110.0,"From what I remember, doxy is bacteriostatic and inhibits protein synthesis so the bacteria doesn’t make a cell wall. PCN works at the cell wall, but if there are no cell walls to attack then it’s basically useless. Also, doxy just stops new growth of bacteria so the ones that are still around can develop efflux pumps and become resistant to PCN. This is all theoretical though

You hospital pharmacist? You’re not going to see cefuroxime or cefpodoxime used much in retail. Insurance won’t cover it for the most part"
pharmacy,fedpkfb,t1_fed6s5g,1579017116.0,Thanks for the info. Reminds me that I need to stay up to date when new guidelines are released. It’s hard to stay on top of it in retail when there’s zero down time so it’s something that I’ll have to do outside of work

pharmacy,fdp81cc,t3_emjuxd,1578622165.0,"This all depends if your gf is salaried or paid hourly. If she is a staff rph then she is most likely salaried, which means if she covered 3 hours for her manager, she’s not getting paid those 3 hours. The only way it would be fair is if the manager made up those 3 hours for your gf.

This also depends if the scheduler is aware any of this is happening. Based on what you wrote, it sounds like your gf’s manager is taking advantage of her."
