joker,fel3qef,t3_epomyo,1579213407.0,Joaquin does an intense staring scene in “The Master.” His eyes are already so intense. Mesmerizing.

I’m gonna try to channel your strength. I need to be way better with self care."
antiwork,fd4mx2m,t3_ejuqe2,1578169043.0,"I do believe personal autonomy includes ones right to die at their own hand. That being said, I do agree with those that say there are other options. 
I have survived several suicide attempts and being in a mental hospital for a while. There are many dark days, but there a few precious moments. For me those moments primarily stem from contemplation of wilderness & supporting other living creatures. 
So, perhaps you can find sanctuary somewhere on this planet. A few experiences of joy seem to outweigh the permanence of non-being. But, this is just my personal experience. So, I wish you well whatever path you may choose, even if it may be to step off this mortal coil."
Vegetarianism,fd44l2j,t3_ejlfgl,1578164390.0,"I had some acquaintances visit years ago. They (rather rudely) thought it was appropriate to cook a whole fish for themselves at my house. I cried so hard for that Alaskan salmon. I suppose it could be seen as silly, but I mourned the idea of that fish swimming freely in beautiful Alaskan waters. So, yeah, totally can relate."
Kitten,fd42t7f,t3_ejw2if,1578163843.0,Awwwwzzy!  So adorable!

VeganNewsNow,fbm98rj,t3_edtetw,1576980390.0,"Curious if they’ll use separate fryers, or how they’ll prepare it. I always worry about cross contamination. But I really would like to try it."

depression,fbf2msi,t3_eczhm3,1576799964.0,I truly believe friends are the family you choose. Your friend sounds in need & you have the compassion to recognize this. It’s unfortunate that your family does not share the same empathy.
Catsmirin,fbci5ta,t3_ecm5vh,1576724472.0,You’ve turned my whole world upside down
joker,fbbni6e,t3_ecgi2o,1576704104.0,"I love seeing the process. Which takes they ended up using had such an effect, and I feel like they made such stellar choices for the pacing & character development."
