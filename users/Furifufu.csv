depression,feh0mu2,t3_ep1hd7,1579106656.0,So far I believe one of the best places to find genuine potential friends are video games. There aren't a lot of games with such communities but they are out there

depression,fegw84c,t1_fegu8ab,1579103919.0,Not necessarily. Video games are a coping mechanism which means that the problem lies deeper. It could have been as simple as a little self doubt at a certain moment that snowballed into depression/the need to game to stay sane. At this point the only thing OP can do is keep holding on and wait for an opportunity at least as far as I'm aware of
depression,fegveyq,t3_ep14ev,1579103405.0,That's where videogames come into play I guess. Not all but some communities are really forgiving and sometimes they feel more like family/friends than any you've had so far IRL

depression,fegkjqj,t1_fegjno1,1579095589.0,"Well this one isn't for everybody but I'm playing steam's Dead By Daylight and it's pretty fun although the devs are making some rather questionable changes. The game itself costs 20 bucks with DLCs which are usually withing the 4 bucks price range (I grabbed it while on sale, everything was 40-50% off and I spent around 30 bucks so yeah). The other game I was eyeing recently is Final Fantasy XIV which is considered to be one if not the best mmorpg currently on the market and it was also 50% off but when I purchased it there were some problems so I ended up missing the sale (The full edition, which is what you want if you know you'll play the game, is 60 dollars plus I think a 15 dollars monthly subscription so yeah it's quite expensive but it's also really good. The other option is buying the starter pack for I think was 40 dollars was it? And then buy the DLCs if you want to later on in case you end up not liking the game enough and there's also a free trial up to level 35) be warned though the leveling part is really REALLY long so if you don't like that then well :P

People also say the newest DLC has one of the best stories they've seen in a videogame

Wow this was long but well these are the ones I'm currently interested in. I hope you end up enjoying one of them :)
Edit: The community in FFXIV is also really cool you don't usually get these people that try hard and blame you for not knowing stuff and they actually help you out and stuff. Heck half of the reason I want to buy the game is because of the community"
