>Also, no one said you couldn't make your own CC and make it available for free.

One is fully your creation, the other is using a majority of digital resources that you don't own. It takes skill, that's true, but it isn't the same. And I can tell you, a majority of Sims CC is not hand-painted or hand-meshed, and how far some creators go over their ""copyright"" is a bit ridiculous.

If you do have the skill to mesh and paint models and textures digitally, there are better ways to monetize that skill than making mods for the Sims. For instance, teaching your skills, selling custom models, texturing, etc.

I firmly believe that modding the Sims should be a hobby, not a job. People should do this because they like doing it and sharing it with others, not to make some kind of payday. I believe in donations, but not paid content."
