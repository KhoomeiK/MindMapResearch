Codependency,ff7v7r9,t1_ff7qnkh,1579659145.0,I just watched that one and her boundary story. Thank you- I can’t even explain how much I needed this
CPTSD,ff7ni95,t1_ff6wzyt,1579653787.0,"YES. Or “have you tried yoga”. If one more person tells me this, I will scream"
service_dogs,ff2du5t,t3_er58q3,1579502088.0,"If you’re a big dog person, Great Danes are amazing mobility dogs. There’s an organization by me that is only Danes. I’ve seen a few that can alert to specific things"
CPTSD,ff273ir,t3_er66bo,1579495691.0,YES.
ptsd,few6b5c,t3_eqp8ys,1579405896.0,"These two have both been acting up for me lately and it’s so hard to manage the roller coaster. I wish I could help, but I feel the pain"
SelfCareCharts,fesvfbr,t3_eqjb17,1579369409.0,"Thank you for posting all of these. I’ve noticed it’s just (or at least mainly) you, and it probably takes a lot of time to compile all of these. They are so helpful and not going unnoticed or unappreciated!"
ptsd,felo7l0,t3_eptd57,1579226892.0,"I’m so proud of you for both having the courage to go back AND for using your coping skills- it’s genuinely encouraging to hear. It’s so freaking hard to go back to school. I started this fall semester after a 2 year gap break, and sometimes it feels like I just can’t. It’s so hard to focus, and if you have any tips, I would love to hear them!! Thank you for sharing, and wish you success and happiness and peace. You got this, you already made a HUGE step. You’re amazing!"
drawing,felnsr8,t3_epqwjx,1579226611.0,"This and your instagram are beautiful, and I’m hooked. Switching to IG to follow you!!"
Anxiety,fekqsnv,t3_epnec0,1579205687.0,"Go you! I’m terrified, so reading this gave me hope. Best of luck, you got this!"
offmychest,fejvghq,t3_epjh3s,1579186775.0,"Thank you- as a 20 something trying to recover from atypical anorexia who still is trying to ignore what society wants, I appreciate this and needed it more than I knew"
service_dogs,fejv70h,t3_epjp21,1579186602.0,"You gave her such a fulfilling job and life as a SD. You did your best and all you could with what you knew at the time. It sounds like you two bonded so closely, and I can’t imagine what it’s like to make the decision to retire her. But it’s amazing that you can keep her and give her a beautiful life as a companion. I know it’s easier said than done, but please try not to feel guilty or any shame. Life happens and there’s so much out of our control. Keep your head up and best of luck going forward with both her and your new SD!"
offmychest,fefplid,t3_eouddd,1579061638.0,"I’m so sorry. My younger brother was the one who both parents cared about, and I was the one “who was always fine”. The resentment is hard. Family life/dynamic is hard. Do whatever it is you need to do to keep yourself sane and healthy. Take care of yourself and put yourself first. Try to keep your head up, even on the days you don’t want to move."
SelfCareCharts,fefp1yh,t3_eowcsq,1579061260.0,Thank you- specifically needed regret and frustration today
drawing,fefgj30,t3_eosoka,1579055848.0,Please share more! Line work is my absolute favorite. I
ptsd,fee8da1,t3_eop91f,1579028502.0,"Definitely ask her what you asked us when you feel it’s the right moment and safe for her. She knows best, and maybe you two can figure out things together. It’s so hard because everyone is so different trigger/need wise. Best of luck to the both of you!


I recently found this chart on Pinterest while looking for self care things. It’s really pixely and hard to read, but the titles are somewhat legible. If I’m ever in another relationship, this is something I want to do.

offmychest,fee7k12,t1_fee1zvs,1579028027.0,Thank you. I didn’t realize how much I just needed to hear “you’re not overreacting”. Thank you
Codependency,fe58hm6,t3_enp7nr,1578866582.0,"I wish I had some help or trick or something to give you. I struggle with the same thing. I’ve been getting better about feeling like I need to respond immediately and be passive and be like “I’m going to give it x minutes/hours”. But I still have a hard time figuring out how to deal with keeping in contact. I would love to hear how you guys handle when friendships fade. I’ll get so hurt and resentful that I’m the one messaging first and keeping it going. And when I stop, I know that’s the end and I’m devastated."
service_dogs,fe09pqq,t1_fdw2cqb,1578807051.0,"Thank you! The public is what makes me nervous. I start to dissociate and just recently discovered that I have emotional flashbacks. If you don’t mind me asking, do confrontation/conflict happen often?"
service_dogs,fe09ca7,t1_fdyxiok,1578806711.0,"I never thought about it from that perspective, damn. Thank you, I needed that"
service_dogs,fe099oj,t1_fdwy30t,1578806646.0,"That’s honestly been one of the biggest things holding me back. The stories I’ve read/heard about dealing with the public just leave me speechless. And I’m angry that people’s ignorance and entitlement are a huge part of me doing something that I know will help improve my life. It’s just not fair, and it sucks

But thank you for this"
service_dogs,fe08z30,t1_fdyx297,1578806381.0,"Oh my god, I’m so incredibly sorry. That’s beyond horrific. I’m so proud of you for going back out. It’s so hard. Thank you for sharing with me"
ptsd,fdxqvqo,t3_enbnf0,1578771995.0,"I’m the same way 100% even when I know I’m safe. My friend and I just recently talked about how we both like each other, and he was the most compassionate guy when it came to my triggers. But sometimes just cuddling would send me straight to the bathroom and puking and hyperventilating. I wish I had something to help, some tips or shortcuts. You’re not alone though. I don’t know what it’s called or how to work on it, and it sucks. Keep your head up though ❤️"
service_dogs,fdvpho3,t3_en7c81,1578750077.0,Thank you for this ❤️
CPTSD,fdn96fx,t3_em1f5p,1578580613.0,"I’ve had IBS since middle school. I’ve had an endoscopy and colonoscopy in high school and nothing was found. It took me close to a decade to realize it was tied to trauma. Whenever I get emotional flashbacks or anxiety attacks. I’m so fucking sick of it and tired of it. It can get so inconvenient and I’m working so hard on not being mortified. People think I’m not staying on top of it because I don’t take meds. I tried every med (culturelle, probiotics, etc), and it doesn’t work. It’s so tiring. Keep fighting even though the fight wasn’t your fault. I’m sending you healthy tummy and body vibes!"
service_dogs,fdkxhxn,t1_fdkoaxg,1578513187.0,"If this comes across rude or offensive or personal, I’m so incredibly sorry- do you regret getting a SD? I’m just curious and I’ve been considering a SD for CPTSD for a few years. My therapist and I talked about moving forward. The people are honestly the biggest reason I’ve been apprehensive"
Dogtraining,fde5bgh,t1_fde2l7u,1578331509.0,"Oh not the whole time, it’s so important for them to take a break so there’s no overstimulation. But I know A few daycares around where I worked that were designated daycares but would just keep them in crates. It wasn’t a boarding place but they treated it as such. Sorry, most of where I am say “crate free” and it implies that they’re just not kept isolated."
tattoos,fddox5a,t3_eksdzk,1578319953.0,They have to bandage the tattoo to keep in clean the first few hours (sometimes the first day). Don’t jump to conclusions
Dogtraining,fddor3f,t3_ektmsu,1578319809.0,"Crate free places for sure. I was a manager of a puppy daycare. It’s inhumane that some places define doggie daycare as keeping them in crates for 6+ hours only letting them out to go to the bathroom. Smaller number of dogs (usually) means more one on one time and attention dogs are getting. Look for attentive staff who honestly put the dogs first before anything. Most places won’t give a tour, but definitely ask anyways"
ptsd,fdcuocz,t3_ekhnbj,1578284821.0,Sending air hugs ❤️ I swear one of the hardest feelings is just wanted to be held or want a hug and having no one.
CPTSD,fdcma6r,t1_fdcm0g1,1578278435.0,"We’ve started that recently. I’ve just sat down cross legged for a few moments, and I’ve held out my hand- not to touch her, just holding my hand out. I’ve talked a lot to her and wrote letters. I’m home on break and I tuck in my stuffed animals every night. I’ve held onto a stuffie that I’ve had all through living with my abuser who was like my safety/comfort object, and I sleep with him every night. The biggest thing I’ve done is just reassuring her whenever I think of her"
CPTSD,fdclf1f,t1_fdckoy4,1578277812.0,"The first one I kinda recognized didn’t feel like me was one I had named Vixen (long before I brought her up in therapy”.  She’s the one that “takes over” during sex, every time even if it’s 100% consensual with a partner. But she tells me what face/noise to make, and she reminds me of Jessica Rabbit (if you know that cartoon). The second one I started calling Little One. She’s terrified and always hiding in this shadow. I can feel that she’s just wrapped in this huge blanket and she doesn’t want anyone to see her. I’ve noticed sometimes when I’m with a partner, I fall back into these extremely childlike behaviors (none of which are bad, I think like the fawn reaction?).  It’s hard to describe"
CPTSD,fdckrrf,t1_fdckoy4,1578277352.0,"I have no idea, he’s the most recent (like literally this past week) one I’ve talked to my therapist about."
CPTSD,fdck0cz,t1_fdci8p1,1578276807.0,"It’s like seeing a hologram. He’s like a layer in between my eyes and the “real world”. I’ve been trying to describe it since I was little. My eyes are open and I’m awake, and I can see him, but I know he’s not there- like if I reached out, I couldn’t feel him. Like how you can have a sticker on your window-it’s on one surface of your vision, but it’s not in all layers. I don’t know if any of that makes any sense... he’s not a hallucination, I know he can’t touch or hurt me. He usually doesn’t move. I see him for like a split second, but he’s so scary and terrifying I push back and make myself think of something else"
CPTSD,fdc1u1t,t1_fdbzps6,1578265440.0,That’s the first time she used that term and it completely threw me. I don’t think I’ve heard it before!
CPTSD,fdc1oq5,t1_fdbyn1w,1578265369.0,"Thank you! I knew it was to the level of full out DID, but I feel like there’s so much that can be traced back to CPTSD. My therapist has me do something similar- she has me invite them into the room and sit down my therapist is kinda like the “moderator”. She asks them the question and I answer almost “as them”- if that makes any sense."
asmr,fczy5d6,t3_ejn3s6,1578110642.0,Thank you for the affirmations- these are my favorite ASMR videos
CPTSD,fcru4dz,t1_fcrebrp,1577906640.0,Thank you- I’m good with patience until it comes to myself and healing. I have to let myself be ok with needing to take time
CPTSD,fckgmmf,t3_ehmqxy,1577724889.0,I’m just learning what emotional flashbacks are- thank you. I needed this
service_dogs,fcaom1y,t1_fcagxdm,1577573445.0,I’m so sorry. That’s so unfair
ptsd,fc437em,t3_eg0mys,1577405442.0,"I’m so glad you made it 💕 

I’m terrified to come off it, but I want to so badly. I know everyone’s different, but (and possible trigger warning?) what kinds of things should I prepare for?"
service_dogs,fc1mpfw,t1_fc12uw1,1577323403.0,"Thank you! 

I will never understand why people think some things are ok. I think that’s a little of what makes it hard to prepare for- they do things I would never even think to do!"
CPTSD,fc0z4y5,t1_fc0yay1,1577303650.0,That just made my day 😂
CPTSD,fc0ljpo,t1_fc0hrbt,1577293821.0,Exactly!!
CPTSD,fbzqp7o,t3_efcs3a,1577256732.0,"I’ve been told by a few ex’s that I “burrow”, and for some reason that description just feels comforting. I’m always nuzzling into their side/arms or curling in some way. I thought it was just another weird quirk, I never thought it might have been a response!"
mentalillness,fb6j29n,t3_ebob9f,1576551524.0,"Even despite me asking for not SSRI’s, multiple psychs have put me on them. I, personally, feel no effect on my anxiety whatsoever. But I also know it works for a lot of people- it depends on your body! If you’re not having luck, it might be worth a conversation to see what your psych/dr/prescriber thinks!"
