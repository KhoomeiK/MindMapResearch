HabitExchange,ff9jra8,t3_esdgyr,1579714486.0,"yeah, it's good to have goals, but try not to read for the numbers. read to understand, to explore, to grow, to learn things, because numbers are irrelevant at the end of the day and life.

i don't read constantly, but i have 308 books read already, i just sit and read for several hours a week or a month, i don't want to read every day because it would feel like an obligation for me"
52book,ff7tv9p,t3_ermo4g,1579658235.0,"I read in one sitting. So i choose smaller books. If you read 10-30 minutes a day, its easy to read a book a week. But I don't understand people that read 100-200-300 books every year."

AmItheAsshole,ff75lhb,t3_ervv4n,1579641576.0,"well, i would hate to have a stranger in my life in my mothers place, so i understand him. a divorce is a trauma for a kid, he needed therapy in that period of time. his anger was a way of coping. i dont know if you are an asshole, but usually step-mothers are the worse and this is just my opinion based on what i've seen in my friends families. i bet the story is much longer, so our opinions are irrelevant."
