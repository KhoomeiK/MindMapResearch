I don't think kids will be one way just because you are. Kids will develop their own personalities as they grow. My husband is also opposite of me both our kids have totally different personalities. My parents for instance both kept to their selves, yes I keep to myself too but my older brother is a big business guy with tons of friends and goes out all the time so I think your daughter will be whom ever she's meant to be :)

Just remember it's not just you, there's a lot of us moms... And dads! Who feel the exact same way :)"
stayathomemoms,fdfu0ct,t3_eil54c,1578370184.0,"It could be both!
I deal with depression and anxiety. My kids are now 8 & 11 but after they were born I was always exhausted and down, so tired that I didn't even know someone could be that tired. Just moody and a mess.

After some of those feelings left I was still so tired and no energy. Turns out I have hypothyroidism. So that was a reason I was tired.

Then the depression and anxiety set in.
If I was depressed I had some terrible thoughts, I didn't care if I lived yet in reality I'm terrified to die because I want to be here with my kids forever.
Depression to me felt like I was a different person on the inside. Felt like I was watching myself but couldn't do anything to control my thoughts or feelings. And every once in a while I have a really bad episode again, even though I'm medicated.
And anxiety to me made me scared to leave my house, made me constantly worry about dying to the point where I start panicking. Anxiety can be triggered differently for everyone though.

I'm not sure what thoughts you have in your own head but if you feel like you hate yourself, you don't want to get out of bed, you don't care about  showering or anything like that talking to a doctor may be a good idea.

It never hurts to talk to a doctor regardless of the outcome.
I find that if I talk to people that understand how I feel it really helps me get through knowing I'm not alone :)"
stayathomemoms,fdfsrcv,t3_ekyeld,1578369288.0,"Seems like a lot of us moms are feeling the same way as you.
I was going to say your life sounds similar to my life. Then I see all these other moms said the same thing lol.

It's hard to have friends at all as a stay at home mom. The only friends I have are 2 friends from high school. I love them to death, they both have kids but we never see each other. It seems as though a lot of people are hanging out with family than friends, at least it seems that way to me.

I too am socially awkward. I'm dealing with depression and anxiety, so that's fun!
I honestly think some people are just meant to be home bodies, like me.

I tried baby groups and play groups and all that when my kids were younger and I always felt out of place and usually didn't go back.
I even met other moms at my kids school, super nice moms, added them on Facebook, hung out with the kids once and that was that.

Friends just don't seem to stick for some people. It's like we're born radiating this friend repellent lol.

But when I think hard about my life currently I'm not even 100% sure I want friends. I tell myself I do but it's a big change and I'm not a fan of change. I always say maybe down the road I'll find a friend.

Friends just don't happen as easily as they did in my school days. I look back and think ""I had friends? How did that even happen?"" lol.

It's another world I suppose.

Just know it's not only you, it's like 80% of us moms too :) ♥️

BTW where abouts in the world do you live?"
