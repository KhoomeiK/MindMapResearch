summonerschool,feg9seb,t1_feg9o9c,1579083940.0,"Ah OK, I've only done it once and it led to a pity party from the other 4 about being stuck with ""trash tier mid"". I mean they weren't wrong, but they were in my game and just as bad! xD

I'll try that next time I'm flamed to see what happens, a sample size of 1 never tells you anything."
summonerschool,feg8pa5,t1_feg3ajj,1579082392.0,"Why? I told my team I was muting them once and then didn't to see what happened and they spent the next 20mins spewing toxic nonsense about me to each other. If anything they were MORE distracted by it, it tilted them more. Better to just mute and carry on; if they feel better by typing garbage once and then move on that's better for everyone. I don't need to see it for them to have been able to vent like the petulant children they are!"
summonerschool,fedtlsi,t3_eog5mg,1579019620.0,"Or to put it another way for the low elo players like myself out there:

1. Focus on your own play and rather than deflecting blame to the low hanging fruit (always the jungler); have a think about what you could've done differently. This may help you improve, avoid that death in future and climb in the long run

2. Flaming has never helped win a game in the history of gaming, it's pointless, wastes time and often causes people to play worse (I certainly play more passively once I've been called out aggressively in chat; this helps nobody)

3. Most importantly (imo); look for any opportunity to help your jungler do his thing. As a useless mid main I always keep an eye out for the first dragon attempt in a game. If you get in there and help your jungle secure that objective they are 100 times more likely to help you out later in the game. You want gank assistance? Look to help them whenever you can, they will then like you and return the favour! It's human nature; who is more likely to get help? The guy who teamed up and took down that drake or the top screaming in chat ""WTF 0 GANKS, REPORT JNG"" ?"
aww,fede4ek,t1_fedagqv,1579008979.0,"You're welcome. The internet is so often used for bad so I thought I'd follow schnoodles example and spread a better sentiment for a change; if we were all a little more schnoodle I think the world would be a better place!

Keep smiling buddy, the world often responds in kind if we spread a bit of happiness. However small it can make a difference to someone's day.

If you ever need an ear send me a pm, sometimes getting something off your chest to a stranger can help lift the cloud and provide a perspective you can't see right now.

ChoosingBeggars,fd1gtx1,t1_fcxq6a0,1578131212.0,"This tipping culture is so messed up! Why aren't establishments just paying people a proper wage?! I don't understand it, in the UK you get a tip for good service. It's an optional gratuity, way of showing gratitude for a job well done. In USA it seems like the restaurants pay bugger all and then pressure the customers to make up the difference?! It's insane to me.

Why do customers get vitriol for not tipping but the companies paying jack shit to their hard workers are left alone. It's a fucked up system if you ask me."
