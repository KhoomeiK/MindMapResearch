So seems like if you wanted to have sex last time, do you want to fuck him this time? Sounds like a standard booty call going on

As for telling your mate, high chance the guy has already bragged about getting head off you. If for some reason he hasn't, who cares. None of your mate business what you do, or who in this case. You two broke up ages back."

As for the advice, I generally go before leaving home. But seeing sometimes you can't do that, a lot of self talking happens. Anything like ""you just went, you be fine"". I generally try to push through it. But I'm more anxious about leaving the house, once I'm out I'm mostly fine. 

What really helped me, was the feeling itself. Can normally tell when I needed to go and just felt anxious, if that makes sense? 

It seems like you are focusing so much on it, that you are basically self talking yourself into it happening. Do you have any techniques for your anxiety in general?"

From my own experiences, the more people I told or the more times I talked about it. The easier it made me feel."
depression,ff574i7,t3_erpmb4,1579582153.0,"Keep it simple. Say you are there for them, up for a coffee/chat/walk. Really anything. Whenever they are ready for it. Basically reassurance them that they aren't alone in this."
Anxiety,ff56egz,t3_erotwb,1579581539.0,"This question really depends on many things. Like most things, they can only help you so much. Most of the work is up to you. I have gone to many in the past, where none really helped because I was helping myself. 

My recent one though. Seen him for about 18 months or so. Has helped me massively. But it took awhile for things to really start feeling like change was happening. Maybe 6 months into it, of going every 2-4 weeks, did I start to notice an improvement. A tiny one at that."
Anxiety,ff4qc0k,t1_ff4oyv6,1579569891.0,"Sadly it's what I do as well. It's all a battle, pushing through the feelings, giving into them at times. I basically try to never beat myself up if I give in to them."
Anxiety,ff4nr84,t3_erlxna,1579568087.0,"Not sure if this is the same thing. But having anxiety for many years myself. My doctor once described how my anxiety works like this. Basically the ""normal"" non stress person out of 10 may sit around 1-3, with how stressed they are. If you have been anxious for long periods of time, you sit around 6-8 on the chart. 

So basically, your body is always showing physically sides of being anxious and it does very much become a normal feeling. 

Personally speaking, when I become anxious I get the feeling of need to go to the toilet. So having that anxious feeling all the time. I can't tell if I'm really just anxious or I really need to go to the toilet."

antiwork,ff2mnk2,t3_eqvdqn,1579513551.0,"Honestly life reminds me of some MMOs. You ""grind"" away most of your time and really don't ever spent much time enjoying yourself. But can't ever enjoy yourself, because you never have enough money.

melbourne,ff2m6fe,t1_ff2lxhw,1579512809.0,"Nah. Speeding on a dangerous road, sure. Speeding on a dead straight road that goes on forever, nope. Like today, was caught out in the storm. Most of the roads started flooding really badly, really fast. What was everyone doing? Lights on, driving super slowly, giving each other a lot of breathing room.

Also if speeding was such a serious problem. Europe would have a worse accident rate than we do. But note their speed limits are way higher and have less crashes. Also the amount of people I see crashing in peak hour traffic, where everyone is going 10-20km/h. Just shows, people not paying attention to the road, are going to crash no matter how slow they are going."

Anxiety,ff2kjwp,t3_er9jtn,1579510398.0,"This story took a weird turn. With the title ""anxiety ruined a friendship"". I was expecting, you got so anxious and the other person didn't understand at all. But really, it seems you aren't understanding his viewpoint.

Sure maybe he should have texted you, but since he seems to have anxiety/depression as well.  You wanted to hang out, to then completely ignore him. I understand that you weren't and you just listen to music to calm yourself down. If I met up with some mate, who then completely ghosted me, then didn't message me anything, after walking off. I be left wondering if I did something to upset them. Which brings a whole range of anxious thoughts to me. Edit: But on either side, I wouldn't see a friendship ending from that. It's up to both parties to check on each other.

With what you texted him, honestly, were you pissed? Because that comes across really upset. Basically telling him to ""never message me again"" over what seemed like at worse a huge misunderstanding. Telling a mate that, when you said you are both so close. I don't expect him to reach out, not after that text message.

Side note: Age has nothing to do with being mature. I have met some teenagers more mature than people in their 50s."
Anxiety,ff2jmo8,t3_er9t5b,1579509125.0,"I would suggest go to therapy, which I can understand would be a problem if you are too scared to talk to people. I would say even bringing someone with you, could very much help you in the long run. That aside, the first step would be to figure out what makes you so scared of talking to people. Is it just people you have not talked to before? Does the same thing happen over the phone?"
melbourne,ff2j88v,t1_ff2iri4,1579508584.0,Speeding isn't the problem. It's wankers on the road doing stupid things.

Anxiety,ff2bgl3,t1_ff1h90w,1579499638.0,"It's not just that response it's how your body is reacting to it. Someone explained it to me at some given point. Over just going all at once, your body just lets little bits go at a time. So the thought of ""how can I go so much"" because your body isn't releasing everything.

Having bad anxiety as well, it used to send me into massive panic attacks even thinking about having to deal with them. Which then of course fuelled many other disturbing thoughts. 

Then you get the dickheads, like one in the comments just going at anyone that's on it. Never worrying about how much the fat cats at the top get away with. Sadly people are way too easily controlled. The good old ""look over there, don't look at what I'm doing""."
ChroniclesOfElyria,ff25b1a,t1_ff0q96n,1579494214.0,"That saying doesn't make sense when related to CoE. I could use an example of Cyberpunk, getting delayed another 3 months, awesome. 

But with CoE, we are just wanting for Pre-Elyria to start. The first, super rough testing phase. Not like people are really demanding the game be released right now. 

How long should we wait for an Pre-Alpha product to launch? Before it gets silly? 

I wouldn't even mind being in Alpha 1 for years. Mostly knowing and seeing they are slowly making progress. I'm just confused what is going on now. We have heard nothing about the game in ages. Just about all these events, that supposedly aren't suppose to affect the development of the game."

Tomorrow came (it was friday) I was feeling so sick, didn't end up going to school. Come Monday, he tells me the story of how he lost it. I was feeling bad by this point, went to go get it. It's gone. I hid it in the art room, where the supplies are, in a part no one ever went too. 

What do you know, it's gone. Now I'm freaking out. I look all over the place. Yep someone has taken it.  Several months later, someone else from our class finds it, in the same spot I put it. 

Now I don't know if someone took it, their parents found out and were forced to return it. But didn't want to admit to stealing it, so just put it back where they found it. But at this rate, my mate had got a new scooter and didn't seem to care about the other one."

But the improvement it made, was massive. Wasn't meaning to come across like it would be easy. I know it won't be. Just meaning, gotta try making baby steps towards things that will improve your overall mood and well being. Don't even need to do a hobby. Can just try going for short walks.

Everything he has said on discord. More over-hyping, more completely unrealistic goals. How did it take them a year to change the FAQ? There was people making threads saying ""I just backed the game and saw it's coming out this year, how's the beta going?"". Yep nothing like misleading people. While info is next to impossible to find on the forums. Zero roadmap, to easily show people what stage the game is up to.
