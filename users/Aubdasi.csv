Citation needed tbh, these other countries still have problems with violence and mass violence just not via firearms as often. If 10,000 out of 350,000,000 is an unacceptable number then we have a lot of things to focus on before guns. Then the CDC said that there’s at least 300,000 defensive gun uses which sure sounds like a larger number than 10,000 deaths from guns. 

I’d agree with the whole “common sense” schtick if the people always saying it actually said anything that sounded like common sense. Bans based on whether or not the gun can accept special bits of plastic isn’t common sense, is stupidity incarnate. 

You know what sounds like common sense gun legislation to me? 

* remove sbr, sbs and suppressors from the NFA 

These features and this accessory does nothing to assist crime, and only exist because in the 30’s they were planning on banning pistols and wanted to prevent the poors from poaching. 

* open NICS or start some kind of system to allow consenting adults to run a background check on a private party without there being cost or a wait period that affects the seller or buyer of a firearm. This covers private sales for those who erroneously believe the democrats compromise for private sales being unchecked will affect crime 

UBC are unenforceable without a registration, and are reactionary not preventative. Will not assist with gang violence or mass shootings, the only reasons to push gun control. 


* mandatory firearms education in middle and high school. Not  “abstinence only” education either. legitimate use, repair, maintenance leading to marksmanship education and training for those who get that far. 

Anyone who argues against this simply doesn’t want to solve the problem. You can accomplish all of this with fake firearms or pellet guns even though it’d be inadvisable. nothing is as preventative as education and prevention seems to be the name of the game, to those arguing in good faith. 


* a strong focus on the socioeconomic factors leading to the plague of mass shootings that we’ve seen since they’ve become popular 

We used to be able to ask sears to drop a machine gun off on your doorstep. Now you have to ask the government if it’s okay to own a bolt action or semi-auto rifle. It’s not the firearms leading to mass shootings let’s stop acting like adding more restrictions will help 

—


Anyone who believes restricting firearm access will help either is aiming for complete ban and unconstitutional confiscation of ALL civilian arms or is not actually paying attention to United States firearm laws and the culture that brought them about. 

Some other common no-no’s that get called common sense are: 

* licensing and registration 

Registration only exists for the purpose of confiscation, licensing should either be something given at the end of high school or not be required. 

* waiting periods 

If we had a way to ensure those who already own firearms and those who genuinely need it for a possible emergency could bypass the waiting period, such as a stalker or jealous ex boyfriend or something, maybe I’d be okay with a waiting period. Until someone proposes something like that without registration and licensing then it’s a no-go

* purchase limits 

A mans only got 2 hands and can own land big enough to store all 400+million firearms. Mass shooters rarely use more than 1, hell I can only think of 2 that aren’t the Las Vegas shooting which might as well be a conspiracy theory at this point. Purchase limits won’t do anything that current laws won’t. 

* ammunition background checks 

I understand why but this is the equivalent of background checks on gasoline. You’re asking for a backed up broken system that puts non-criminals in a bind where criminals are just going to ignore it. 

I’d love to go a few years, decades or the rest of my life without hearing about another mass shooting/bombing/truck driving through a crowd/ school stabbing but we live in a world with evil and violence and it is the job of the individual to protect themselves first and then whoever else they can second. Let’s not prevent them from defending themselves because a few people think it’s a good idea to hurt as many others as possible?"

Thanks for that."
progun,feaf5s8,t1_feaddte,1578947894.0,"Damn and here I thought I was alone on all these gun subs with this kind of outlook. 

We can’t prohibit alcohol, drugs, knives or abortions. We can’t enforce the bans under any effective strategy without becoming complete tyrants. Give people access to healthy means of abortion. 

Wanna reduce abortions? Education. Educated people have less unwanted pregnancies and less pregnancies overall. If you want to reduce abortions it’s going to come down to how available contraception is and how educated the people involved are. 

Prohibition doesn’t work~"

SelfAwarewolves,feacntr,t1_fe99wn3,1578947055.0,"Well considering we’ve gone from mail order machine guns to having to go through a background check on any commercial sale, cannot ship guns privately except to an FFL, have to be 21 to buy handguns, cannot purchase any kind of modern machine gun, cannot have a short barreled rifle or suppressor without waiting a year and paying hundreds in taxes, cannot bear these arms in public without further background checks, more poll taxes and licensing fees, some states have useless waiting periods and now California has a broken background check system for ammo and the currently proposed complete disarmament of any modern firearm in Virginia; you’re going to have to excuse gun owners from not wanting to allow further gun control when it obviously doesn’t stop mass shooters, if it did California shouldn’t have any and they seem to have just as many as the rest of the country. 

Give me a democratic candidate that wants to actually focus on reducing gun violence by facing the socioeconomic side of things. We didn’t have mass shootings when all it took was paying sears or another mail order company to send you a machine gun, so it’s not the guns causing these mass killings. We see truck attacks, bombings, and arson killing more than our worst mass shooting in modern day around the globe (if you ignore the governments mass shootings and disarming of native Americans) 

It’s not the guns. We don’t need further restrictions to try to solve a problem that kills less people per year than constipation or blunt objects do. 

The place to start with anything involving reducing firearm deaths would be school-mandated firearm training. Videos showing the terminal ballistics of firearms. How to ensure a firearm is safe. Basic firearm maintenance. The laws and restrictions around firearm ownership. All the basic stuff that goes into responsibly owning, maintaining and safely utilizing firearms and understanding how devastating they actually can be. After that if some students chose to, they could join a marksmanship class or things like that. Let’s get the militia well regulated again. Let’s give them the mental tools required to safely engage in their innate human right to self defense. Let’s remove the boogeyman from gun ownership. 

Attorney General eric holder said “(we need to) just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.""

He’s right. Back then he said we needed to make it uncool to carry a gun. Now we need to make it cool to own one. To be proficient with one. To be able to show healthy ownership. We don’t need everyone and their mother to be terrified of something that won’t magically make their life end by it existing in the world. Help people understand it doesn’t make someone invulnerable or invincible. It’s not a magic talisman of walking death or perfect protection. It is neither what the democrats nor the republicans want people to think it is.

Whether you like it or not the fact of the matter is Democrat’s ride on a platform of pushing voters to the polls because of *maybe* 200 deaths a year in a country of 350+ million people. All they had to do was drop guns as a “vote for us” button and they’d have the moderates as well. The only thing keeping me from voting for the Democratic Party is their stance on guns. I want their social progress but not if it leaves me, my brothers and sisters or the rest of the country vulnerable. 

Luckily women and minorities have been getting concealed carry permits out the wazoo lately. Maybe as they learn more about firearms and how to be responsible for your own protection they’ll see how bad gun control is, it’s roots in racism and oppression and how our society has been doing a great job of reducing overall violence already, without banning bent metal bits. 

Prohibition doesn’t work in alcohol, abortions or knives. It won’t work on guns."
SelfAwarewolves,fe8rykt,t1_fe6n0kp,1578930003.0,"Something 99.8% of the people in this thread don’t understand that guns aren’t like the movies or TV. Nor are most gun owners actually bloodthirsty. Most gun owners I know, including myself, get excited about going to the range and dread the thought of having to shoot someone. It’s accepting that the world sucks and people get put into shitty situations. A gun is the equivalent of a fire extinguisher, except instead of an not-alive fire to protect against its living things with intent to harm. 

It’s baffling people actually go out of their way to demonize something simply because either they can’t understand it or refuse to acknowledge the world they live in."
worldpolitics,fe6cxi6,t1_fe6aga6,1578887277.0,"It gets much less scary when you remember that out of 400,000,000 firearms and around 350,000,000 people, less than 11,000 are actually murdered via firearm. If you’re not in a gang or suicidal you’re more likely to be struck by lightening twice and survive. You’re more likely to die to constipation or due to a kid texting and driving than a malicious or accidental firearm discharge."
