If all you want to see is the negative, then you are correct. But military service is *much* more than ""go kill"". Most servicemembers don't see combat, and the ones that do don't automatically become broken people. That's a horrible take. It's reductionist and disrespectful.

 In the military, you can learn a trade, earn college money, pick up some discipline and adulting skills that your parents may have not taught you. It's not for everyone, but you really don't have the right to look down on the people who are serving."

SeriousConversation,fevo543,t3_eqjc3g,1579399607.0,"Apu is one of the genuinely good characters on the show. Everyone else, with the possible exception of Flanders, is a negative stereotype."
SeriousConversation,fevh373,t1_fev752k,1579397346.0,"Thing is, the show is full of stereotypes, but Apu and maybe Flanders are the only characters that are genuinely good people and have gone through lasting character development.

Look at other characters- Chief Wiggum is a horrible caricature of a fat, incompetent, corrupt cop wrapped up in an impression of Edward G Robinson. Willie is an uneducated, combative, Scottish stereotype that lives in a shack and whose accent is mocked regularly in the show ""bonjourrrrrrrrrr, you cheese eating surrender-mknkeys!""). Has Apu's accent ever been mocked on the show? Barney is a terminal alcoholic who has fallen off the wagon dozens of times. Moe is a suicidal sociopath incapable of holding a relationship

Everyone loves Carl.

But I don't see why everyone is up in arms about Apu when Azaria's Bumblebee Man is probably a much more offensive and coarser stereotype. The show's portrayal of Italians is much, much worse. Where is the outrage there?

 People from India speak with an accent and sometimes misspeak English. But he forgave Homer for making fun of Ganesh. Sang in a rock band and a Grammy-winning barbershop quartet. Married Manjula and had 8 children. Cheated on Manjula. Graduated from Caltech (Calcutta Technical Institute) with a PhD in computer science. Became a US citizen after feeling remorse for attempting to disown his Indian heritage.

Apu is probably one of the most normal and complete characters in the show."
