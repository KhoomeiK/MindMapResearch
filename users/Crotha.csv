RagenChastain,ff5ydic,t1_ff5w0gr,1579614243.0,"With NO speed or time requirements, I already have completed an iron-distance event in the past years, no problem.     
(maybe a few more years for the bike-part. I'm not much of a biker)    

That's the thing, though:  
Without some kind of restriction, nearly everyone can finish it without any problems.   

Edit: regarding the swim speed, on her only ever start of an half-IM, she swam that portion in *nearly* cut off time.   
So, I'd assume thrice that time for the swim part?   
(unfortunately I don't know how much time you have for the swim part in an half-IM)"
RagenChastain,ff5y3w2,t1_ff5rlfs,1579614017.0,"She of course IS fit.   
She was already completely Ironman-ready on her first try (of an half-IM) and is training nearly non-stop with only minor set-backs.   

She probably finishes her Iron-distance event in less than three months!

This isn't really fun, but I also love HP. So...   

May be a more unproductive thing to do, but be damned I will read that damned book. :D

languagelearning,fekj63p,t1_fejcrir,1579201146.0,"Just to add on that:  

There are obviously also German subs on reddit. The language may have some local dialect included in the writing, though.  
But just subbing to the general subs to see a post every now and then, I find, helps me quite a bit.

insanepeoplefacebook,fedq32m,t1_fedmh51,1579017437.0,"Oooh, damn, that's true.   
We also call it Coconut milk. As I barely ever see it and have probably never bought it, I forgot about that.   

Just looked it up, it seems one exception due to the very long use of ""coconut milk"", so it got basically grandfathered.  

Thanks for that, I obviously haven't thought about this one!"
insanepeoplefacebook,fedpqx3,t1_fedo79y,1579017229.0,"Ah, yeah, I write it ""Joghurt"" basically always , but I think spellings like Jogurt and Yoghurt are accepted too? Or maybe my spellings is wrong in german too...     

I honestly don't know what the correct spelling is in either german or english :/    
But I think everyone understands it, despite the spelling :D"
insanepeoplefacebook,fedbdgr,t1_fedanie,1579006538.0,"Funfact:     
In Austria (and maybe in the EU too), ""milk"" (on products) can only be used to sell, well, milk from animals.       
If no animal is named ""milk"" refers to cow's milk, otherwise the animal is to be named (like ""goat's milk"").    

All the plant milks are called, basically, ""plant drink"":    
Rice drink    
Soy drink    
Almond drink    

You get the gist.      
(Same is true for cheese or joghurt: both are fermented MILK products)     

Edit: as pointed out by /u/Skepsis93 : **coconut milk**, called ""Kokosmilch"" in german, is an exception, as the name is basically grandfathered as it was never calles anything else.    
It is not, though, considered milk and if it was used as am ingredient, it is called ""coconut"" only."
RagenChastain,fe1qg3k,t3_enlk34,1578829619.0,"Okay.      
I watched the streamable video: I didn't find it funny but I am generally not a fan of this kind of comedy. It does seem to be decent enough (though not very different from similar sketches of the ""let me tell you funny stories about my life"" comedy), just with a ""HAES / fatlethe"" angle.   
Yeah.          

What I didn't know is her _other_ webpage she mentions: [funny-fat-girl.com](http://archive.is/pvzwY)  (archive.is - link)        
This page, being rather bare, does link to [sizedforsuccess.com](http://archive.is/9gcdR)  (archive.is-link) with all her accomplishments as a speaker and such.    

I didn't even know she had all that pages.     

But I wonder when we will get the next *ironman*-related blogpost on ironfat..."
fatlogic,fdo5dvd,t1_fdnwc57,1578599190.0,"Thanks for the correction!    

I should've known that, because we (I'm a german native speaker) even have the same word too.  
I'm rarely using it, tbh, but we have the same french loan word, written the same (just capitalised).   
Well... I'm dumb. :D"
fatlogic,fdnmhsh,t1_fdn8wyr,1578588880.0,"The random blaming of food is quite rampant, imo.      

The butter craze a few years back, egg and cholesterol, the every few weeks newly emerged superfood, whatever the current one is - as if eating (or excluding) one food suddenly makes you healthy and makes all problems go away...    

Everyone is looking for a simple, easy solution like ""don't eat eggs""."
fatlogic,fdnlyp5,t1_fdn6aez,1578588567.0,"Ah, thanks for that, I went completely blank on the english word ""dessert"" and just used candy instead :/   

Huh, without knowing any advertisements, I just assumed it's a desert or mid-afternoon snack or something.  
On the other hand, typical cereals are sugar bombs too, so it's not that different from that.   
Thanks for the info!"
fatlogic,fdn4it0,t1_fdn3u90,1578577055.0,"If you've ever been on a salt-decrease journey (for whatever reason), after adapting to little-to-no salt in your diet, you notice just how salty especially store bought convenience food is. 
I'd think, that's the same principle.   

Obviously this (both salt and sugar) is only true if you mainly eat (store bought) convenience foods.    

Regarding sweet potatoes: they are rather rare here (and expensive....), but I fucking love them. And they are quite sweet, more so than I though, so making sweet potato puree is such a treat.  
I'd just love to get them more readily and cheaper."
fatlogic,fdn39nq,t1_fdn175h,1578576000.0,"That's probably also (at least a huge part of) the reason why a lot in the USA don't think fruits really as sweet, and that vegetables in general are bitter:   
The normal, general sweetness level is so high, natural sweetness is far too little to really notice, and slight bitter taste is noticed far far more.   

At least, that's what I've been told. As I've never been to the USA, I can't really say anything about their food except poptarts:   
A friend took a few back home from a vacation, and they are only sweet with no other taste (to me) - but obviously I can't judge a country's food by one ~~candy~~ dessert.   

Edit: yuropoor me used the wrong word."

I know I do - in doing something physically hard (but also controlled and finite) my mind can, basically, go blank. A form of meditative state.
Drowning out the godawful gym music with my own music is nearly a prerequisite for that."
ShitAmericansSay,fdjz5aq,t1_fdjxmjh,1578491944.0,"Well, obviously ""Native American"" is just a rebrand for people from India, why else would they previously be called ""Indians"" before it became politically incorrect, hm? HM?

Because then you could abuse your virginity for more and more pizza, even if it's only domino's.  
It would make more sense if they can only take your virginity (card, including the promise!) once, for one free pizza.    

In both cases you sold your virginity to domino's, forced by the school.   
Doesn't seem very christian to me :D"
