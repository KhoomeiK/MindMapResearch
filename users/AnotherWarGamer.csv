worldnews,ff2piwv,t1_ff292qe,1579517975.0,"This is something I've thought about, and reached a satisfactory conclusion. It absolutely matters how the money is made, specifically whether it is done in a zero sum way or not, as well as the other ethics involved.

The ways in which Billionaires reach that kind of wealth are for the most part bad. From worst to best, it would look something like the following. The worst involves ethics violations like toxic dumping (as opposed to spending some of the profits to clean up the waste), or slave labour. Almost as bad are the landlords, who contribute zero to the overall economy and are leeches, and this is according to economic experts. A little better is extraction of natural resources. This actually requires investment and adds to the economy. The problem here is you are consuming a finite opportunity for insane returns, which many others could take advantage of. A slightly better way of making money would be the telecommunications companies which do a lot to improve the world, but over charge and make massive profits in the process.

Additionally, any one company will have many different characteristics simultaneously. Consider Amazon. They are a great company, which produces value in a zero-sum way, adding a lot of value to the world. But they also have a lot of weak points in this regard. This includes working conditions, not paying enough taxes, and consuming tax deductions and other incentives from the government.

We can conclude that reaching the highest levels of wealth requires insane growth, and this always includes a significant amount of ethics violations in the best case scenarios.

A separate topic I want to discuss quickly is how the wealth is made. Normal people work for an hourly wage, but rich people grow investments instead. As much as I hate to say this, investment is necessary to do pretty much anything, and some sort of return is necessary to make them invest their money in the first place. I don't know what the answer to this is, I know it looks very different from what we currently have, but I don't know what the answer is.

Cheers. (And hopefully someone reads my rant)."

freefolk,ff1qy5r,t1_fezq3lf,1579484231.0,"Creating an actual sandbox game based on this would be very hard. If you focus on mechanics it won't have much to do with GOT. If you add the GOTs characters and story it's just a story based adventure. And if it did everything it would be way too expensive and take way too long.

I'm trying to get my first video game funded, and I have the ambition and plans to create games of ever increasing complexity. I would love to one day make something on this scale, maybe not this, but on this scale. But that is probably a decade out. And I'll probably never get the first game out of the gate.

AskReddit,ff1m9re,t1_ff1a4yv,1579481519.0,">Some wanted me to go through three(!) interviews plus a hands-on exercise, and this was not even a technical role.

It's possible they are just using you to improve their interviewing skills. I once interviewed for a software job, where they told me congratulations, you passed the first interview, only one in twenty people make it to the second interview. It really got me thinking, first they must have interviewed like a hundred people minimum to arrive at that stat, second the ethics and absurdity of it.

Over time my understanding of this has improved as I've collected more information that has been used to build up a picture of what goes on. For a candidate friendly job interview, the ratio is roughly 4 people interviewed for every job offer. This is what is stated online, but it is far from the norm for jobs regardless of what they say. It's also likely correlated with company size, as the big established tech businesses for example have perfected the hiring process so they don't  waste people's time. On the otherhand you have various levels of shitty hiring practices in descending order. The next level down would be to interview loads of people for one job. Even worse would be implementing a scoring system for candidates, while trying to collect as much data as possible, even interviewing shitty candidates just to get an idea for the distribution of what exists. The next level down is the always be looking mentality, where they will interview even if there is no opening, in the hope of finding someone so incredibly good that they hire them anyways. This is like looking for a unicorn. The next level down is what we already mentioned. Their is no job, and they are just using you for their own gains, either marketing or practicing their own skills.

My conclusion is as follows. I hate everything about the process. One possible solution would be paying every single person that shows up for an interview. This helps to balance out the lopsided effort being put in by both sides. And if it's ""too expensive"", it means you are interviewing way too many people and you should be paying for it. Another possibility would be a government controlled system for interviews which shows the ratio of interviews to job offers. Those places looking at hundreds of candidates would quickly find that no one even bothers showing up anymore. My final thought is that I can't be a hypocrite, so if I'm ever in a position to be hiring, I do plan on handing out hundred dollar Bill's to every person that walks in on my request."

A few years ago, I dreamt that I was on a bus going to Montreal and that I was very sad. First this is strange, as I've never gone anywhere, and hadn't been to Montreal or had any reason to go there. I also thought why on earth would I be sad, and I concluded the only reason I would be sad is if I wasn't working. Fast forward a few months, I meet this girl on the other side of town, we end up getting married, then she goes to school in Montreal. So sure enough I ended up going to visit her many times, by bus of course. And just to make the dream complete, I was also out of work for over a year. But of course I never told anyone, and even if I did, they would never remember.

In a more recent dream, I dreamt I went back to attending highschool. Now I didn't actually go back to highschool, but I did go for more post secondary education, which I had not been planning on doing. This one doesn't mean much though, since it's pretty general and doesn't match what happened as well."

She was new, but not her first day as I had seen her there before (she struggled with the same order a few days before). Minimum wage is 14$ CND in the entire province over here, so she is being paid well. So paying a living minimum wage isn't going to push out lower skill workers."
Showerthoughts,fefsaum,t1_feeem02,1579063707.0,">Look at how many restaurants have closed in Seattle after they upped the minimum wage to $15/hr.

Makes sense. 15$/hr is cheap if you are busy, but expensive as hell if you struggle for customers. My guess is the saturation point changed, and many restaurants that hardly had customers went under. This isn't really a problem, as it wasn't the thriving businesses that disappeared. And the ones that survived got a huge boom from all the extra customers."

Damnthatsinteresting,feey1wb,t1_feexbj7,1579043716.0,I think that companies want to sell more and more vaccines regardless of if they have any additional benefit. Diminishing return is sure to set in fast which means very little benefit if any for additional vaccines.

Add on the fact that the number of vaccines keep increasing with time and there are many more that have been never made it to market that are waiting in a closet somewhere. It's all business.

I really doubt this. Saudi oil is some of the cheapest in the world to extract. I've heard 1$ per barrel or something like that. Meanwhile the lowest cost a barrel has gone for is like 20$. While that 1$ figure might not be accurate, Saudi oil is still one of the cheapest to produce."

AskReddit,fecla8r,t1_feaeoq8,1578976708.0,">That was the one time I saw the high school completely not have a handle on anyone.

No one has power over anyone, they only have the power you allow them.

I live in Toronto and the dress codes got changed recently. I'm not exactly sure what the new rules are but highschool students (age 13 to 18 over here) are wearing short shorts and showing off their bras and tits (the girls at least). Edit: so basically 20 year old beach clothes in the classroom. I don't know too much about it, but it seems like a single school was responsible, and rather than change the rules for only one schoo, they did it for all of them. The rest would have fallen like dominoes quickly anyways.

My lesson here is this is democracy. We have the internet. The students decide the dress code. The students can choose a dress code and choose a day. The school can't expel everyone. Anything said otherwise is rhetoric to keep you oppressed and powerless. There are 30 students and 1 teacher, if each has 1 vote the teachers voice doesn't matter. I'm not saying this because I care about freedom of dress, it's never bothered or affected me. I'm not even saying this to stir the shit. I'm saying this to clearly show the reality of what is going on."

The weirdest one is limits on going to the bathroom. Of course this is necessary because kids will simply abuse it and skip class. But on the otherhand how do you stop someone from going to the bathroom? I imagine you could just soil yourself then sue the school for making you go through all of that."
