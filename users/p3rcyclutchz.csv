P.S.  stop going 30 over....leave earlier to get to your destination please!"
unpopularopinion,felinc2,t1_felf8az,1579223082.0,"My comment was a reply to the person above to add on to what he was arguing for, not a statement on its own, really.  He made the case America is not 'like a warzone'  as his friend was claiming and it was in relation to the large geographic space and how most of the country is not like a warzone at all."
unpopularopinion,feksjt2,t1_fekh2fu,1579206713.0,"It's been said before on here, but I think a lot of foreigners to the USA do not realize just how large our country is. I think it's a big problem when you start trying to compare countries....like dude your country is the size of 1 of our states. Yes our 'stats' on certain things will be bloated comparatively just based on population alone and I think it gets over looked a lot."

Doesn't seem too hard and doesn't look like it would cost much. More a question if u can get the time with your mom away from your sister to make it happen"

TheMonkeysPaw,fek80c1,t3_epm44a,1579194523.0,Granted. You are teleported back in time as Peter (Ron Livingston) acting out scenes in the movie office space.

legaladvice,fcoanyp,t3_ei904z,1577827613.0,Do you live in his house? How is he threatening to kick you out? And after all of this you're worried about keeping your phone number? Seriously? If you have your own house/rental call the cops and report suspicious person peeping your windows. Tell him he can have his fucking phone and go get your own.

legaladvice,fco8dtl,t3_ei8fyq,1577826047.0,"This used to happen to my ex all the time. They would harass her at work, at home, email....it's all a bunch of horseshit.  They used the same type of language, serving her papers and trying in one way or another to get money out of her. They did have a lot of personal info on her too.  I think they just eventually gaave up, but it went on for over a year I think."
