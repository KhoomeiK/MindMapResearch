You cant lob loblolly, longleaf, and short leaf into the same catagory. They each have a different adaptation towards fire. You can run a fire through a long leaf stand wayyyy more frequently than a short leaf stand. If you ran a fire in a short leaf stand withing 5 years of establishment or every 2 years after the first fire you would kill it. The same can't be said for long leaf. 

Also the grass stage for a long leaf is not 1-3 years. It's around 8 years. 

You copied and pasted your tree 'facts' from the wrong source. 

But good on you for getting 1.1k people to upvote and agree with you."
