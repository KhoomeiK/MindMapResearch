legaladvice,ffck4bl,t1_ffcgyhb,1579801161.0, In parts of Oregon they take it extremely serious at DMV because some rural areas don't have DEQ and others do. If OP doesn't have DEQ and the sister would you could approach it as hey she's scamming you guys because of DEQ. They typically don't like being scammed out of money jmo

I had That dish it was my great grandma's it was in perfect condition (funny she's from Salinas CA). anyhow I sold it for, are you ready 30 bucks cause I couldn't find anything on it although didn't look very hard! The person who bought it was very pushy now I know why ugh that one hurts! I guess we live and learn.  I had the entire blue butterprint and pink gooseberry however recently scam artists took over our rent to own home we had three hours to get everything we owned.  When we were let back in the assholes had gone threw my entire kitchen pulled out every dish and baking pans everything in all my cupboards and China cabinet etc and broke it all ðŸ˜­ so I'm starting at ground zero again.  It's ok though I'll get there again.  Half the fun is the hunt!"

RBNSpouses,ffat2rt,t3_ei8ln2,1579743841.0,Holy cow tell him to look at cost of rent in Portland Oregon. You cant even rent a studio for under 900 your lucky to rent a room in a shared house for under 800 so he's being a spoiled brat in all honesty. You bought your property as an investment. Im sure it wasn't with intent of taking full financial responsibility for your thirty year old son. It should be treated as such! His finances aren't your issues.  If he doesn't make enough maybe he needs a better job or his so should work imo
Parenting,fevwm7j,t1_fetieav,1579402369.0,"My kids school had each class put together a themed basket (ie. Night at the movies, gardening, spa day etc) then they would auction off all the baskets.  Each kid would bring in one item 5-10 dollars and of course if you can a few things incase someone couldn't afford anything.  Parents and community members went crazy there was always a business backing each basket with a gift card or big item.  Some baskets would go for over 180 dollars which is good money."

thingsmykidsaid,fcahuev,t3_ee4j41,1577569504.0,"We made the mistake of calling girl parts peaches. When my now 14yr old son was about 2 we went the local market I asked if he wanted some peaches.  His little eyes got huge and he said umm mom are they real peaches.  Not thinking I was like well of course they are.  He said you mean they cut them off of girls,  no way mom I don't want no peaches! Lol I was like omg no no no so I bought some went home sliced them up and gave him some he looks up after a bite says mom these are better than a unicorn having a sleep over lmao.

raisedbynarcissists,fc14rii,t3_efjhwv,1577308237.0,"Is scary to hear how many others have narccistic mother's.  Mines horribly narcissistic, I've finally gotten to the point where I refuse to speak with her very often and if I do it's on my terms and about nothing important! Merry Christmas to all that are going threw this and because your mom's haven't told you this your all doing wonderful and are amazing people!"
