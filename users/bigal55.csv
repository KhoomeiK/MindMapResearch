And also,HOW can anybody be so self -centred? It's to the point of being evil."
JUSTNOFAMILY,ff2j2tf,t3_er8i36,1579508381.0,Just hang on for a few more days in the realization you'll never have to breathe the same air as these people ever again!
cats,ff2ivmx,t3_eqzt4v,1579508114.0,Treasure every moment like several here have said.  Our happiest hello's and our saddest goodbye's are with our furry wee buggers.
aww,ff2hg78,t3_er0c37,1579506295.0,She's a heart stealer all right!.....and she'll be a bigger one as she grows!  :)
cats,ff2df14,t3_er7fi9,1579501640.0,"Damn,he had you well trained to cough up the treats,didn't he?  He was a really handsome furrball and it sucks beyond belief to say goodbye to the furry lil' bastards.   So sorry for your loss. :("
JustNoSO,ff2cwyr,t3_eqzca0,1579501114.0,I'm an older male and the ONLY way in Hell I would ever suggest something like this if the daughter needed some huge medical costs covered and there was just no other option.  I can't even get into the head of your ol' man suggesting it's okay since your OWN daughter is dead.  That's cold. Sorry you're being put through both this and the loss of a daughter.
cats,ff2chmu,t3_er3s9y,1579500671.0,Happiest hello and the worst goodbye we'll ever have is with our furry companions.  Hopefully the 14 years of memories will get you through the pain.
cats,ff2c8gs,t3_er5r7w,1579500413.0,He's a fine looking furball!  :)  Looks as if he rather enjoys being spoiled.
weddingshaming,ff2bttu,t3_er5r5p,1579500007.0,"She a bitch, pretty simple.  Damn,calling you out for psychological problems and having you babysit her kids and be her servant and she still insults you.  Call her out on it and refuse to even talk to her again ever."
aww,ff1nm3i,t3_er0yqv,1579482171.0,"Thank You for taking the old girl in for a nice old age. :)    I've always thought if you had older relatives or friends with pets the best thing you could ever do for them is tell them if anything happens and they can't take care of their cats or dogs or any other pet, is to guarantee the pet will be taken care of."
cats,feycqln,t3_eqryos,1579443837.0,Now this is the kind of post everybody likes to see!  :)
JUSTNOMIL,feg4zmw,t3_eom7lc,1579077171.0,"Have you tried a nice long,jaw cracking yawn about 2-3 sentences into one of her pity parties?  To be repeated several times."
cats,feg2ssq,t3_eot8ya,1579074424.0,"Sounds like she wanted to be with the one she loved most  after probably starting to feel  the darkness closing in :(   Painful as it is you should look at it as a great honor because often cats will just  hide away when they start to feel  the end..   So sorry for your loss, she was beautiful. :("
aww,feg0ovz,t3_eoqz19,1579071952.0,Now THAT is a good looking cat!   Also looks like could be a lil' bugger at times too!  :)

cats,fecisem,t3_eoe95d,1578974935.0,Amazing how an eight pound bundle of fur can wrap you around their paws and leave a hundred pound sized hole in your heart when they leave!  Sorry for your loss and may your memories of  your fuzzball only bring smiles to your face.
cats,fecgpdy,t3_eo9k1m,1578973499.0,Her black fur sure made her eyes stand out beautifully. May her memories only bring a smile to your face and warmth to your heart.
cats,fec6j14,t3_eo9kga,1578967478.0,Heartbreaking and sucks are the most descriptive words for this.  To get to 17 she must have been loved and cared for   by you very well. I only hope after a bit when the tears dry a bit that her memories only bring a smile  to your face.

Chonkers,fe6r7ae,t3_envp3r,1578901555.0,Sorry for the loss of your Buster. Looks like he quite enjoyed his role as your  furry Overlord.    And may his memories always bring a smile to your face and warmth to your heart.
MaliciousCompliance,fe6qnp1,t3_enquco,1578900855.0,I hated video games till my kids showed me this demo disk out of the old X Box magazine  Microsoft used to publish back then.   Hooked ever since!  :)
antiMLM,fdzp3xw,t3_enbkzr,1578792679.0,"By that level of desperation in her text maybe she got talked into  buying a maximum size ""starter kit"" or company credit card to buy a ton of product to start off with.    When I first started reading this  sub I was wondering if anyone besides the 'associates"" actually buy this stuff to actually use.  It's been answered for me many,many times since."
cats,fdpzgsd,t3_emme28,1578647335.0,A very handsome moggie to be sure!  Looks like he was quite at home being pampered and having you wrapped around his paws.  May his memories bring a smile to your face forever.
JUSTNOMIL,fdp88gk,t1_fdn6cd7,1578622300.0,"Perhaps his wedding present to his Bride(you :) ) should be a really nice,LARGE, colorful,but classy, and VERY visible tattoo.  Done before the wedding of course,so everyone can admire it!"

antiMLM,fcpl3po,t1_fclclve,1577866690.0,Is that Lularoe by any chance that even the thrift stores won't take anymore?  In colours and patterns that  even horse blankets would be ashamed to printed in?
cats,fcoebgf,t3_ei5mup,1577830159.0,So sorry for her and  I hope she went painlessly.   Sometimes even with all the love we can give them they decide to give up.  She was a very pretty wee moogie and I'm sorry it ended this way.

It probably says more about what he thinks of your relationship together then him just being a cheap,thoughtless arsehole."
