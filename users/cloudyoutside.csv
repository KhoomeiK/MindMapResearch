PG&E covered up a huge infrastructure problem and caused several people to die from an explosion. The company walked away almost unscathed from the event. The pipeline was fixed but not out of the pockets of PG&E, but out of the pockets of the customers who has their prices raised in order to cover the cost of the infrastructure issue. 

Large corporations are accountable to no one and Americans sit there and get exploited every day by absurd medical costs, college tuition, utilities, internet, housing costs, and more. America should be revolting for more regulations to be carried out on the rich, and for companies like Amazon to pay their taxes instead of paying less taxes than a single mother working 3 part time jobs."

I’m sure that both sides can all agree that the real issues America faces are still legitimately tearing the country apart. and it doesn’t help that there are literal hundreds of pedophiles in the government and media/entertainment industry.

You’ve hit a lot of points but something I really relate to is the pressure to do something you’re personally not interested in. I was even getting to the point where I was lying to myself and trying to be something I’m not and suppressing my true feelings towards the Bible and god and going to church. 

I would restrict myself in the same way you were restricted. I would block myself from “sinful” things and I would tell myself that I was devoting myself to God and would study the Bible and listen to sermons. I enjoyed some of it sometimes, but it made me depressed that I couldn’t enjoy what I liked because god is telling me I’ll “go to hell”, (which is just me telling myself that).

And then hell made me more confused and upset because I wasn’t allowed to do things I enjoyed out of fear, and the Bible which told me to obey god was confusing in itself. 

I focused so much on playing this game where you get heaven points that I just burned myself out. None of it makes any sense to me. I’m much happier without “church” in my life. And I’m much happier without policing and restricting my desires. But there’s always this thought in the back of my head that when I die, the Christians will be right, and I’ll some how be eternally tortured.

> KOALAS ARE TERRIBLE ANIMALS

KOALAS ARE FUCKING HORRIBLE ANIMALS.
THEY HAVE ONE OF THE SMALLEST BRAIN TO BODY RATIOS OF ANY MAMMAL, ADDITIONALLY - THEIR BRAINS ARE SMOOTH. A BRAIN IS FOLDED TO INCREASE THE SURFACE AREA FOR NEURONS. IF YOU PRESENT A KOALA WITH LEAVES PLUCKED FROM A BRANCH, LAID ON A FLAT SURFACE, THE KOALA WILL NOT RECOGNISE IT AS FOOD. THEY ARE TOO THICK TO ADAPT THEIR FEEDING BEHAVIOUR TO COPE WITH CHANGE. IN A ROOM FULL OF POTENTIAL FOOD, THEY CAN LITERALLY STARVE TO DEATH. THIS IS NOT THE TOKEN OF AN ANIMAL THAT IS WINNING AT LIFE. SPEAKING OF STUPIDITY AND FOOD, ONE OF THE LIKELY REASONS FOR THEIR PRIMITIVE BRAINS IS THE FACT THAT ADDITIONALLY TO BEING POISONOUS, EUCALYPTUS LEAVES (THE ONLY THING THEY EAT) HAVE ALMOST NO NUTRITIONAL VALUE. THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE EXTRA ENERGY TO THINK, THEY SLEEP MORE THAN 80% OF THEIR FUCKING LIVES. WHEN THEY ARE AWAKE ALL THEY DO IS EAT, SHIT AND OCCASIONALLY SCREAM LIKE FUCKING SATAN.
BECAUSE EUCALYPTUS LEAVES HOLD SUCH LITTLE NUTRITIONAL VALUE, KOALAS HAVE TO FERMENT THE LEAVES IN THEIR GUTS FOR DAYS ON END. UNLIKE THEIR BRAINS, THEY HAVE THE LARGEST HIND GUT TO BODY RATIO OF ANY MAMMAL.
MANY HERBIVOROUS MAMMALS HAVE ADAPTATIONS TO COPE WITH HARSH PLANT LIFE TAKING ITS TOLL ON THEIR TEETH, RODENTS FOR INSTANCE HAVE TEETH THAT NEVER STOP GROWING, SOME ANIMALS ONLY HAVE TEETH ON THEIR LOWER JAW, GRINDING PLANT MATTER ON BONY PLATES IN THE TOPS OF THEIR MOUTHS, OTHERS HAVE ENLARGED MOLARS THAT DISTRIBUTE THE WEAR AND BREAK DOWN PLANT MATTER MORE EFFICIENTLY...
KOALAS ARE NO EXCEPTION, WHEN THEIR TEETH ERODE DOWN TO NOTHING, THEY RESOLVE THE SITUATION BY STARVING TO DEATH, BECAUSE THEY'RE FUCKING TERRIBLE ANIMALS.
BEING MAMMALS, KOALAS RAISE THEIR JOEYS ON MILK (ADMITTEDLY, ONE OF THE LOWEST MILK YIELDS TO BODY RATIO... THERE'S A TREND HERE).
WHEN THE YOUNG JOEY NEEDS TO TRANSITION FROM RICH, NOURISHING SUBSTANCES LIKE MILK, TO EUCALYPTUS (A PLANT THAT SEEMS TO BE MAKING IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT IT DOESN'T WANT TO BE EATEN), IT FINDS IT DOES NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY GUT FLORA TO DIGEST THE LEAVES. TO REMEDY THIS, THE YOUNG JOEY BEGINS NUZZLING ITS MOTHER'S ANUS UNTIL SHE LEAKS A LITTLE DIARRHOEA (ACTUALLY FECAL PAP, SLIGHTLY LESS DIGESTED), WHICH HE THEN PROCEEDS TO SLURP ON.
THIS PARTIALLY DIGESTED PLANT MATTER GIVES HIM JUST WHAT HE NEEDS TO START DEVELOPING HIS DIGESTIVE SYSTEM. OF COURSE, HE MAY NOT EVEN HAVE NEEDED TO BOTHER NUZZLING HIS MOTHER. SHE MAY HAVE BEEN SUFFERING FROM INCONTINENCE. WHY?
BECAUSE KOALAS ARE RIDDLED WITH CHLAMYDIA. IN SOME AREAS THE INFECTION RATE IS 80% OR HIGHER. THIS STATISTIC ISN'T HELPED BY THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE FEW OTHER ACTIVITIES KOALAS WILL SPEND THEIR PRECIOUS ENERGY ON IS RAPE.
DESPITE BEING SEASONAL BREEDERS, MALES SEEM TO EITHER NOT KNOW OR CARE, AND WILL SIMPLY OVERPOWER A FEMALE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SHE IS OVULATING. IF SHE FIGHTS BACK, HE MAY DRAG THEM BOTH OUT OF THE TREE, WHICH BRINGS US FULL CIRCLE BACK TO THE BRAIN:
KOALAS HAVE A HIGHER THAN AVERAGE QUANTITY OF CEREBROSPINAL FLUID IN THEIR BRAINS. THIS IS TO PROTECT THEIR BRAINS FROM INJURY... SHOULD THEY FALL FROM A TREE.
AN ANIMAL SO THICK IT HAS ITS OWN LITTLE BUILT IN SPECIAL ED HELMET. I FUCKING HATE THEM.

TLDR; KOALAS ARE STUPID, LEAKY, STI RIDDLED SEX OFFENDERS. BUT, HEY. THEY LOOK CUTE.
