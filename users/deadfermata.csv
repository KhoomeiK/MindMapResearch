nextfuckinglevel,ff08w3d,t1_ff011b1,1579466445.0,"1) *edit* Sorry I didn't really answer your question. There is manual ejection and there is automated ejection. I believe this one was an automated process. This was a test so the rocket booster was intentionally stressed. There is only so much pressure a rocket and withstand. When a booster reaches a certain pressure point it becomes at risk of exploding. When that happens the capsule ejects. This was a test of the dragon capsule which will eventually house astronauts later this year. 

2) Hopefully not. There is telemetry data that is constantly being monitored by mission control. There are tons of signals that can trigger a capsule to eject. That doesn't mean it won't ever happen but rocket science has lowered the risk of these things happening but it's always still a risk. The issue with Challenger is the shuttle was strapped to the booster. The shuttle is heavier, bigger. I don't believe there was a way to 'eject' in the way the capsule does. They cut off engines to the booster which slowed the booster down, detached the capsule, boosted the capsule away to safety. There was forward momentum. With Challenger, the rocket was strapped to the underbelly of the shuttle.

4) The capsule is suppose to be able to withstand a tolerable level of pressure and force. It's probably all calculated into the design of the craft. This is why during ejection the capsule has its own propulsion that pushes it away to safety. You can see how it just flies off while the booster slows down."

It‚Äôs clearly political. Pelosi knew it would never get through the senate but she pushed the impeachment through at speeds that would make a Space X rocket envy. Nadler, Schiff and Pelosi were all saying how urgent it was to impeach because of all the evidence and now suddenly the loud banging went silent. Pelosi says she wants a fair trial when she knew from get go this was never bipartisan. 

The whole process was to trigger Trump‚Äôs sensitive ego and to change public perception of him as being guilty, basically banking on the public‚Äôs ignorance of what the impeachment actually does or says.

Impeachment isn‚Äôt guilt. And technically, this stalling makes Trump look like he was being targeted because of politics rather. Huge loss for Pelosi. Short term gain. Long term loss. For everyone really."
