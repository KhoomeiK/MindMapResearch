And stating that the EC is biased towards smaller states is a fact, not a value judgment. It's possible to consider that either a good thing or a badg thing.

Also, the House should be larger anyway, to better represent size differences of states, and there is also evidence that too many voters per representative helps lobbyists get more power. Increasing the House would alleviate the worst of the unfairness of the EC, which has been getting worse beyond anything the original writers of the constitution ever experienced, ever since 1911, when the House was fixed at 435.

Finland,ff8zf4r,t1_ff8xkj2,1579700869.0,"Yes, losses from trading most investments (not just stocks) can be ""kept"" for 5 years to be deducted from future taxable profits.

I'm assuming that since you say you trade a lot, the little loophole of tiny traders doesn't apply to you: if you sell stocks for a gross value (before fees or taxes) of less than 1000€ in total in a tax=calendar year, any profit is tax free. Any loss isn't deductible either though, in that year or in the next 5.

Whether as a private person you have an ESA or more traditional savings account that you invest from has afaik no effect on the banks' fees. But if you e.g. every year buy 10 kinds of stock at 1000€ per batch, and sell 10 kinds of stock at 1100€ per batch, i.e. 1000€ profit per year, and likely about ~150€ in fees. You would also pay 30% tax = 300€ off that profit. If you're just reinvesting the money, in an ESA you don't pay that tax at all, and get to reinvest that 300€ as well. If you sell and reinvest the ""same"" money several times a year, that matters even more.

As for when you withdraw money from an ESA, let's say that over time you've invested 20k€ into the ESA, which has grown to 40k€ and now want to withdraw 10k€. Afaik (based on that blog I linked earlier) the calculated purchasing cost and profit of the withdrawal is calculated so that it's in the same ratio as the current value vs. originally deposited amount, if that makes sense. So unless I'm mixing something up now, withdrawing 10k€ is out of the current value of 40k€, of which half was originally deposited and half is profit, so out of the 10k€ withdrawn, half is treated as purchasing cost and half as taxable profit. So you don't pay 30% tax off 10k€, you pay 30% tax off 5k€ = 1500€.

Now moving on to you starting a company which would do the investing, and then when you want money for personal use you pay dividends or salary from the company or whatever. Afaik that's allowed, but the company won't be able to have an ESA. I'm not fully aware of how taxes on corporations from investments work, but *assuming* it's not per transaction but only by total profit at the end of the year, yea I guess you'd only pay 20% tax off that. But I have no idea what the banks' fees would be, that depends on their corporate customer pricing. But when you want the money out of the company, you would need to either pay a regular, taxable salary, or dividends. Dividends from unlisted companies are cheaper (if certain conditions are met), with only 25% of it being taxable income for capital gains tax (and even if the conditions are met, still only 75% of the dividend is taxable income), but that's still an extra tax, and I'm not sure it would end up as *that* much lower than 30% when you combine the corporate tax + income or capital gains tax.

edit: and finally, regarding:

> Also what would be the impact on my main job? With the additional company, I assume I will not eligible for unemployment insurance anymore? Would this be any other type of such insurance?

Yea, generally entrepreneurs (which, owning a company, you would count as one) are usually screwed when it comes to unemployment insurance or to be more precise, unemployment benefits, whether it's the ansiosidonnainen or työmarkkinatuki. If you're paying yourself a salary, you also need to factor in pension payments and such."
Finland,ff8xtop,t1_ff8w1p6,1579699564.0,"About the fees: there are obviously some pricing differences. Nordea's minimum fee is only 1% for under 800€, between 800-4000€ it's basically 8€, and from 4000€ up it's 0.2%. Or if you're paying them at least 150€ fees per quarter (so e.g. 19+ transactions of at least 800€), you start getting a bit lower fees. On the other hand, Nordnet starts out with a minimum fee of 9 € for transactions below 4500 € (0.2% from there on up), but if you made even 1 transaction in the previous calendar month, it's 7€ (below 4666,67€, 0.15% from there on up). 

My take so far on mulling the options (I haven't rushed to open an account yet) is that:

* if you just want to make 0-2 times a year and hold for a long time (10+ years; say, buying some stocks for a child after each birthday and/or Christmas, and saving even dividends until then), Nordnet might be best, because they have no storage fees. E.g. Nordea charges 1,95 €/month (=23.4 €/year if you had 0 transactions in the previous quarter. 
* But if you make transactions mostly or exclusively under 1000€ and at least 5+ of them over the year, Nordea is likely cheaper. For example, saving a couple/few hundred euros every monthly, or at least every quarter. 
* At 3-4 yearly transactions the difference is fairly small if your transactions are in the 700-1000€ range, but if you want to make smaller ones, then e.g. Nordea is likely better. 
* However, if your transactions are typically over 700€, and you make at least 1 a month (or especially if you make over 10 a month), Nordnet is likely cheaper due to the lower minimum and percentage fees with that sort of activity. 

I haven't compared the other banks properly: off a quick google it seems OP, Danske, and Mandatum also offer ESAs. Others are still in the ""wait and see"" camp, or are otherwise still only planning their offerings.

And a final thing about the fees is that the banks are allowed to have fees for opening, closing, and transferring the entire ESA account to another bank (which avoids you having to sell everything, pay taxes, and the repurchase the entire portfolio in another bank). [This HS article](https://www.hs.fi/talous/art-2000006361107.html) has a table with all but OP's pricing for those. Basically opening is free everywhere (well, in those 4), and Nordea/Danske don't charge for closing either (but closing can be done only after selling and withdrawing everything, including paying the ensuing taxes). Nordnet charges 100€ to move an ESA account, Nordea 40€, the others 50€.

For the prices mentioned above, I didn't take into account at all how their opening offers work. Those are IMO just intended to lure people to making the accounts, and to reduce the initial burden of making your first investments, as you can't transfer stocks into the ESAs, only cash."
Finland,ff8w1p6,t3_esaobh,1579697988.0,"I think by ESA you mean the new *osakesäästötili* accounts? Those still have about the same or the exact same fees (at least after special offers for opening them end) from the banks for *transactions*, it's just that you don't get *taxed* off the profits off of each individual sale. There is also no immediate tax on dividends from stocks held in such an account that are paid into account (at least assuming those stocks are Finnish ones; it's currently still a bit unclear/not safe to assume that it will apply with foreign stocks). Taxes are only incurred once you withdraw funds from the account.

Also, those ESA accounts are by law limited to one per person, and afaik not allowed for companies at all. They're intended as a tool for ""small investors"" to get started without worrying so much about taxes, not for large investors or companies. And foundations and other charitable nonprofits can already invest freely without paying any capital gains taxes. That target of small investors is reflected in the max. 50k€ that is allowed to be transferred to them (even if you initially transfer e.g. 40k and that grows to 60k, you'll still have 10k left that you're allowed to transfer; i.e. value growth doesn't affect the transfer limit). 

So I think that answers the entire main question: no, you can't have a company with an ESA. I'm actually kind of surprised that you even thought that, have you read e.g. [Nordea's pages](https://www.nordea.fi/en/personal/our-services/savings-investments/investments/equity-savings-account.html) on the topic? Or [this blog seems pretty good at first glance](http://blog.thomasbrand.xyz/2019/05/23/esa-2020-equity-savings-accounts/) (I've actually met the guy years ago, didn't even notice the name at first.

But you're right that the main right-wing party would like to privatize health care a lot more still.

todayilearned,ff8r7ef,t1_ff8il6k,1579692789.0,"Finland. Out healthcare system is pretty stingy, part of why it's so cheap per capita. A lot of stuff has a small fee, but they're always pretty reasonable in my experience, and as I said in other comments medical costs cap out at 600€ per year per adult, and if you're poor enough, social security pays them in full.

Afaik the private ambulances are subcontracted to the public emergency services, work alongside public ambulances in most areas (I think there's a city or two where the whole ambulance operation is subcontracted; there's a few places where even all hospital care is subtracted to a private company) and are generally fairly indistinguishable to patients. We don't need to care about it. The ambulance fee is the same whether you ride in a public or private one. It's called an *omavastuu* which apparently translates as deductible, but as I said above, the per year dedictible is different. And if you have private supplemental health insurance in addition to the compulsory public universal one, those fees might be possible to get part of them reimbursed to you from the private insurance depending on the terms of that insurance, especially it's deductible (which is usually per year for health insurances, I think).

Which is dishonest to say the least.

Regardless, universal healthcare is doable with private care but universal compulsory insurance, basically. Countries with extensive public hospital & clinic systems have chose to use those as their primary source of healthcare because economies of scale make them cheaper. For example, here in Finland primary care is centralized into public health clinics. In Norway the government reimburses private doctor's offices for primary care depending on their amount of registered clients or something like that (a similar system exists as a supplementary one exists in Finland).

Note that the old formula they used to have, with 1 Representative per 30k people or whatever, wouldn't really work. Iirc France and Canada have something like 1 per 100k people, but that's too little for the US too. But while the ideal size of a legislature isn't ""x people per representative"" but rather more likely e.g. the cube root of the population, for a period of several decades it should be ok to set the House at e.g. ""1 Representative per 500k people"" or something thereabouts.

Nebraska & Maine *don't* allocate votes proportionally, that's a misconception (but you're not the only one who is under that impression). They award their two electors from having Senators using the same statewide winner takes all that other states use for all electors. And they allocate the electors they get for having Representatives, using FPTP in each congressional district. Which now means they can gerrymander part of their electoral college votes too. ""Yay"".

And finally, gerrymandering is a result of a two-party system/FPTP/single-seat districts. Which exactly is probably debatable, but all 3 occur as a result of each other, so the difference is kind of academic. It can be legislated against even within that system, but is pretty much automatically rendered obsolete/practically impossible with sufficiently large multi-member districts with proportional representation."

Let's take e.g. [this riding from Saskatchewan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatoon_West#2015%E2%80%93present) as an example, with 48% Conservative, 40% NDP, 7% Liberal, 3% Green, and 2% People's, and even less for others combined. With FPTP, yes, if people just don't want Conservatives to win the seat, they should have chosen even more strongly to just vote tactically for the NDP candidate (in this case). With any kind of preferential single-seat voting, you could avoid that compulsion to some extent. But preferential voting does still allow and even encourage for other more subtle tactical voting.

On the other hand, what if all 14 seats from Saskatchewan were awarded proportionally? Looking at the Saskatchewan results [here], the votes were 64% Conservative, but they got 100% of the 14 seats. NDP got 19.5%, Liberals 11.6%, Greens 2.5%, People's 1.8%. With proportional allocation, depending slightly on the method (=mathematical algorithm used), but not bothering with more complex math right now, Conservatives should get 9 seats (not 14!), NDP probably 3, Liberals 2. The Greens were only about halfway to a seat in that theoretical 14-member district."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff4ar7n,t1_ff418bg,1579559263.0,"1) I agree that this is a fair and good solution, and should be done. **BUT** removing winner takes all requires a constitutional amendment to do so simultaneously across the US. With simple game theory it should be fairly obvious that any individual state implementing proportional elector allocation (which is how it needs to be done, if there isn't a constitutional amendment) is effectively shooting themselves in the foot regarding how much power their state will have. It might be possible in some purple states with idealistic people and methods to force laws or state constitution changes with citizens' initiatives or the unlike, but very unlikely to happen in any reasonable timeframe across the whole US. And even once states change to that, they could just as easily change back (and game theory suggests it would be in the advantage of any strongly red/blue state's majority party to do so). So this is almost certainly achievable to a satisfactory level without a constitutional amendment.

2) The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact suggests doing this, sort of. Should it get enough states to sign on to come into effect, and isn't subsequently struck down by the SC or sabotaged by mass faithless electors (OTOH *that* if anything should cause riots) it awards all of the signatory states' electors to the popular vote winner. And because it's only designed to come into effect once the signatory states comprise a majority of EC votes, that ensures that the popular vote winner will always win the EC. It effectively bypasses the EC to implement a popular vote. **AND** because it doesn't require a constitutional amendment (assuming it's upheld as constitutional), it's much more reasonable *to implement in practice**. Even if it's ""less reasonable"" in the sense that it entirely circumvents the states' role in the presidential election.

I could theoretically see 2) happening with the NPVIC and then power-brokers agreeing to constitutional amendments to the EC, but it's a much harder guess what they'd actually put in said amendment. The US and especially it's politicians has far too little of a sense of governing for the good of the entire country and for democracy instead of just their own power. Too much power-grabbing, too little statesmanship."

> Providing an arena where low population states have an equal voice is designed to prevent things like this from happening.

For a federation like the US with a bicameral legislature, I actually agree, but by design that's the role of the _Senate_, not the EC. But the US House is arguably too small for the country's modern population, and thus because the House's seat allocation to states already ""equalizes"" states a bit, the House already has a bit of ""state power"" in addition to the power derived from the people it should be focused on. This is then compounded in the EC as electors are awarded based off Representatives AND Senators, tossing even more state power into the mix. And if you consider the fact that the Senate appoints judges, there are *no* branches of the US government where some power isn't shared to states, rather all but the Senate are varying mixes of a mandate from the states and a mandate from the people.

> Imagine if California, New York, and New Jersey (who are some of the most aggressive states when it comes to tax pursuit) decided to band together with other high population states to levy a 1% tax on all low population states that would then be split up by the high population states.

In the current system it's mostly the reverse ([one example source](https://www.moneytips.com/is-your-state-a-net-payer-or-a-net-taker/356)). Or rather, the largest states pay, some of the smallest but depending on the metric (in other sources, and varying somewhat from year to year) also swing states benefit. Is that really better, and/or is the sudden reversal of that really a major risk, assuming a lot of those money transfers are to fund e.g. education and social programs? Further, the EC doesn't prevent large states lording it over the rest, if enough people cram into few enough states. [CGP Grey covers that in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3wLQz-LgrM), about 1:26-2:55 if you don't want to watch the whole video (and his others on the topic of the EC). Even now (or rather in 2016) just the eleven largest states were enough to win the EC: California, Texas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois. And that number is more likely to drop than rise, if urbanisation continues.

And again, as I noted above, the slight favoritism of the EC (especially if the House was enlarged to a size more fitting the current US population, and then kept up to date by the same law based off Census results, without further intervention in several decades being necessary; this would reduce the relative effect of the Senate's size on the EC) isn't the worst problem, and IMO actually if the other two would be fixed, it could be left alone if that's the hill pro-EC people want to defend to the last.

I don't view fixing those other two, larger problems with the EC using e.g. state-level proportional allocation of electors and a 2nd (or even 3rd!) runoff round of EC voting as being against or for rural or urban states. That would simply give all voters in all states, including the ~30% Republicans in California, ~35% Republicans in New York, ~45% Democrats in Texas, other small and large minority party voters and all ""independents"" (from the current two main US parties...) everywhere better representation in the presidential election. And referring back to the ""protection against large states"" argument, proportional allocation of electors would break down the power of the largest states into the actual opinions of the people in those states, instead of making the largest states appear more monolithic than they actually are."

The largest is that states award electors with winner-takes-all, and the 2nd is the single-round FPTP-style vote the EC itself takes. If they at least had a runoff, then combined with proportionally allocated electors, that could already allow electors to actually vote for their (or their states'/state parties') preferences instead of being forced to choose among the two ""main"" candidates right off the bat.

Either pure proportional allocation or a Mixed-Member system with both single-member districts and a statewide pool to even things out to be proportional. For Senators and states with only 1 Representative, ranked or runoff voting likely remains the best choice. For the presidency, the vote needs to also have be ranked/runoff, whether it's done by electors or a popular vote.

Winner takes all (of electors in all but 2 states) and FPTP (to the Senate, House, some of those 2 states' electors, and state legislatures) are what enforce the two-party system, not the EC's favoritism towards small states. For a true multi-party system, even ranked voting is a weak attempt, what you really need are multi-member districts with proportional representation. And *then* ranked/runoff voting for US Senators and the president, whether the latter is directly by popular vote or an EC with each state's electors allocated proportionally.

Besides widely agreed-on analysis of the effects of election systems, this comment is based off of history here in Finland, where we had a multi-party runoff-voting proportionally allocated EC until 1988, when it was abolished in favour of just a 2-round runoff popular vote, and the president was simultaneously reduced to be much more clearly just a figurehead.
