NintendoSwitch,fenjpha,t1_fen709a,1579286157.0,I got it when it was first released on the switch. I wasn't really paying attention and next thing I knew I had almost 80 hours played in the first month.... Good luck and have fun.

golf,fekg9e3,t1_feiidxr,1579199411.0,"Depends on where in Chicago you are, there's a huge place in Orland Park that has $30 rounds for league members (non league is like 35 an hour I think). Stony Creek in oak lawn has a couple of simulators as well and as of last year they were only like $20 an hour."

todayilearned,fdp6et9,t1_fdp4nac,1578621081.0,"1. It was bad milk that went out of date and was returned from a couple days off routes. It was supposed to go to the plane and be turned into hog feed but the refrigeration unit on the trailer broke and it just got put out of service and kinda forgotten about.

2. The trailer was going to be scraped since it was junk anyways but we had to clean that shit out first.

3. No just breathing through our shirts.

4. It was mostly slime, mold and maggots."

todayilearned,fdoteig,t1_fdo10rt,1578612456.0,"Im a milkman one day at work I had to move a broken trailer that was supposed to be empty... It wasn't. It was sitting for about 2 years with about 400 gallons of expired milk in the nose of the trailer. I've been doing this for 18 years but nothing has prepared me for what i saw or smelled when i opened the door. The entire floor was 3 inches deep in soupy maggot infested rotten milk, the different colored molds and fungi growing on it was also something I've never seen before, there were sections of green, brown, blue and black. We backed the thing up to a dumpster wrapped ourselves in plastic wrap and took turns with a snow shovel scooping the stuff out in between vomiting. If I think about it long enough I will actually start to gag."

todayilearned,fdot371,t1_fdorovj,1578612259.0,"And the people (like me) who deliver it to the store you buy it from. Dedicated milk delivery trucks for grocery stores, schools, hospitals, gas stations and convince stores (CVS/Walgreens) are still very common. If you are anywhere that serves or sells milk it was very likely delivered by a milk man like me."

NFCNorthMemeWar,fdgmbsj,t1_fdg1lk5,1578402119.0,Yeah and I say this as a Sox fan but it's pretty bad in Chicago when the only team trending upwards are the Sox.

Wellthatsucks,fc5fv9u,t1_fc5f2nh,1577456405.0,"Yeah my Dane knew he was about to do it too. He was walking back and forth between the back door and the living room, we had about 5 minutes left on an episode of how I met your mother when he started and we chose to wait to let him out....we chose poorly."
Wellthatsucks,fc582wp,t3_eg7tcd,1577448006.0,"I have a great Dane, there was a period of about 3 days we noticed he wasn't taking a shit. My wife and I decided to take him to the vet the next day if he didn't go by then. It was coming up on 11 pm and we were wrapping things up for the night and we suddenly hear the worst sounding fart imaginable from the kitchen. We go in the kitchen and the smell hit us like nothing I can explain.... then we see it. There was a puddle of three days worth of great dane diarrhea the size of a twin sized mattress by our kitchen table. Worst part was it had gone under the trim and into the wall so at 11:30 on a work night I'm taking off the trim and cutting as much drywall of as I can trying to get as much of the shit out of the wall be and insulation I can. I ended up spraying a full bottle of bleach in there over the next couple of days before I sealed it back up."
