I disagree, WoW classic just showed me how far we've come since then in terms of game design, I understand why it may appeal to some, but I have nowhere near the time I used to have to devote to games (especially MMOs), and I love how jump in, pick up and play, and customizable retail WoW feels. To me, Classic feels incredibly outdated, I dropped it and returned to retail pretty quickly. 

When it comes to MMOs, the simple fact is that whatever one you happen to find a group that you connect with is ""the best one"".

When did you visit? A lot of the city definitely feels older, but I think those older areas are very quickly being replaced, literally. There's a great facebook page ([DesignersParty](https://www.facebook.com/designersparty/)) that shows just how fast the city (and country) is evolving. I felt like in many ways the Korea I entered in 2014 was not the Korea I left in 2018.

I think Korea is either hyper modern or feels old and run down (I agree, there are definitely some areas that need a touch of love), but as the older generation dies off and is replaced by a generation that grew up using some of the most up-to-date tech in the world, extremely fast internet, and being fully entrenched in modern conveniences (and more exposure to countries outside of Korea), developers are absolutely meeting their needs.

Expats are basically just long term tourists, they move to a country for a long period of time but don't actually intend on staying. They might be there for years working, but they intend to return to their home country or move on to another one at some point. For this reason, they don't really bother with anything more than a work visa. 

Immigrants are people who move to another country with the intention of staying there. These are the people who are actively seeking citizenship. 

I lived abroad for a number of years, had multiple friends of multiple different races and backgrounds, if they didn't intend to stay in the country, they were expats.
