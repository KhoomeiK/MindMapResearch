Be *very* careful rotating out of a missed shot from the ceiling of the goal (Squishy save style). Like OP did. It can easily block your mate's shot. Like OP did. Yes it's a fast recovery, but just be mindful of the play. If your teammate is about to bang a shot, it's okay to recover slower off of your shot to ensure you don't block theirs. 

Yes I've had this happen to me. My teammate missed the most open of all nets, then rotated out via goal ceiling and blocked my follow-up shot on the open net, which was going in with no defenders possibly blocking it (I could post the clip tomorrow, it's pretty funny)"

You could say, ""well OP didn't score any when he was a lower rank"".

RocketLeague,fe4fvmm,t1_fe2l0dx,1578858842.0,"You mean ground to air dribble (starting from dribbling it on top of your car)? 

The key is to learn where on the car the ball needs to be balancing. Too far forward when you jump and you won't be able to get under it, too far back and it'll pop straight up with you getting ahead of it.

To learn this key spot I'd recommend doing a dribble training pack that places the ball a few inches above the ground so you can just drive into it to get it on top of your car. Then just get the ball in different spots in your car and double jump and keep doing it until you can get it to float nicely in front of you. You generally want it around your windshield.

Most often people quicky double jump pop into air dribble, but a single jump into delayed second jump can work too in certain scenarios, you just need to keep doing it over and over to see what works best in what situation. 

Another thing I'd recommend learning is tornado spinning, I've found that sometimes if I pop the ball too far ahead, I can tornado spin under it to regain control of the air dribble. In general just practice air rolling while air dribbling, contrary to some belief it's not just for freestyling, it actually serves a practical purpose in allowing you to control an air dribble that you'd otherwise lose."

>They're both players of the highest level and can hit anything of the norm that isn't just straight out freestyling at the point where it doesn't even matter about in game. 

That's not true at all. Let's take another few players. AztraL is not a freestyler, and Kaydop is of course a top level player. Do you think they're similar mechanically? There's a massive range of mechanical finesse in RLCS and to say otherwise is just wrong.


>Stop treating ayyjayy like hes on some god level above the rest.

I have never heard a pro say this, and even if they did, they surely weren't getting at what you're arguing. ""Skill"" is not a single metric, players are better and worse at a huge variety of things. Kaydop is known as a highly accurate and effective striker, Chaussette is known for excellent reading of his opponents and ability to dribble entire teams, Turbo is known for always being in the right spot positionally, and dare I say it, AyyJayy is known for pulling off incredibly difficult mechanical shots.

To expand a bit, if you're solo queuing, remember this: 

*If the ball is between you and your net, and you have a teammate in net, then rotate far post behind your mate instead of ball chasing*

The closer you are to the ball, the more confused your teammates will be. Remember, they don't know what you're thinking, so make it obvious with your actions. Do you not plan on hitting the ball? Then get away from it, because staying near it will only cause hesitation for your team.

In general, don't ball chase in defense. Make your challenge, go for your clear, and once you lose control or end up in front of the ball, rotate in a wide circle behind your team. Let your teammate move in while you rotate around. 

These tips may be less relevant once you reach GC since the rotation will be need to be faster, but at least as far as Champ 2, rotating wide away from the ball makes play so much easier. 

Especially for Silver, if you keep these tips in mind and try to make your decisions obvious to your teammates, you should hit Gold pretty quick.

Always remember, rotate back post. Always. If your mate has a better position than you to challenge, then get away from the ball to let them know they can push up. Best of luck!"
RocketLeague,fdpepqi,t3_emc292,1578626718.0,"That orange team is a perfect example of how not to be a good solo queue teammate lol. The guy in net hesitated way too much (he had you 100% beat to the ball at 0:03) and the guy driving next to the ball probably caused that hesitation because the goalie didn't know if he would hit it. 

General advice (not for OP, just in general): If you can't get back to the ball, just rotate wide (very wide if solo queue, make your intentions obvious) to the back post. Do not ball chase back to defense, it'll only confuse your teammate who should be challenging. Had the orange guy chasing back rotated wide instead, the goalie could feel more confident coming out of net to challenge."

Back the replay up 10-15 seconds before the goal and watch the lead-up from not just your perspective, but your teammates' perspective as well. Consider your entire team as a unit, and how you all misplayed to allow a goal.

Don't look at it at surface value. I.E. if you tried to make the save and missed, don't just think ""okay next time I have to make the save"" because that doesn't help. Instead consider, why'd you miss? Was it just a whiff plain and simple? That's fine, everyone has blackout moments. Or was it an aerial you're not comfortable with? In that case, you need to practice aerial defense. Find some relevant training packs. Were you boost starved, making the save harder than it should've been? Then practice boost management and learning the placement of the small boost pads to pick up those with your natural pathing. 

Moving on, maybe you weren't the one in net. So it's your teammates fault, right? Not always. Switch to their perspective and apply the same logical analysis. Why couldn't they save the ball? Did your bad rotation put them in a spot where they had to race to net worth 0 boost just to try to make a save? Was there something you could've done to make it easier on your teammates? Were you in a position where you could've challenged early and stopped the shot from even happening? Were you in a position that made it look like you would make the save from your teammates perspective?

Maybe no one was in net and the goal came from a booming clear. Who was supposed to be 3rd man? Watch all three players' perspective. Who pushed up when they should've stayed back? Was it you? If not, rewatch your perspective again. Could you see your 3rd man pushing up too far? Could you have rotated back to help adapt the rotation to his / her mis-play? 

You need to assess replays from a broader perspective. Consider all the small decision making errors that lead to goals. Decisions from entire teams, not just single players.

Of course all these questions aren't going to be something you're constantly asking yourself in-game, the game is too fast paced. Eventually it'll become your natural thought process. But at least for replay review, asking these questions helps shape your positioning habits."

Edit: I can't remember exactly, but it was something like one player said he'd bet all his blueprints that Scrub leaves Vitality and another person responded saying that they'd bet all their Blueprints AND TW Octane that Scrub doesn't leave. He tried to trade Steam IDs but the first player was ps4 or something. Not sure where it went from there"
