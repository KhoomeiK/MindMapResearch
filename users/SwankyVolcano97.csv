depression,fber7db,t1_fbepwa4,1576792046.0,I was so desperate to talk to someone last night that I had went to the local police department with my 1yr old just to talk to someone cause I felt like my husband and  our friends hadn't been hearing me cause they have all been wrapped up in their own stress and have day in day out dumped their own frustration on me that i never could get anything said without the topic being flipped back.
