todayilearned,fewljq9,t1_feumr9h,1579413688.0,Command charged ridiculous price and the places in town wouldn’t copy them as they were stamped with an official message not to.
todayilearned,fewlgcc,t1_fev6ylp,1579413592.0,I was stationed in Yuma Arizona. You can only get away with wearing a jacket for about two nights a year due to the temperature. I just never checked the pocket of that jacket until the next year when it was finally cool enough to wear a jacket. At that point I had given up hope.
todayilearned,festq51,t3_eqhx5n,1579368920.0,When I was in the military I lost the keys to my barracks for almost a year. In that time I got really good at jimmying doors. Years later we heard our neighbors freaking out. We asked them what was going on and they had locked themselves outside their apartment and could not get ahold of the landlord. I was able to get them in on about 5 minutes. I definitely felt like it was a criminal skill to have.

funny,fesqjxc,t1_fesmop9,1579367977.0,I think the point is you shouldn’t have to excuse yourself for walking in public.
funny,fesl8ug,t1_fesjzw6,1579366396.0,It is quite clearly in a corner and there is obviously somewhere to go that they appear to be in front of. Just because you are filming does not immediately give you rights to an area.
funny,fesh5nu,t1_fese9ez,1579365042.0,I am not sure why the feel entitled to take up the entire walk way in a public area to do a dance routine.

Portland,fdt29c0,t1_fdso8hj,1578710977.0,"Please understand that the snow we get is often different than the snow the Midwest, Northeast and mountain regions get. I grew up in eastern Oregon where we get the cold dry snow and never used any sort of traction devices. Here in the valley though it is often a wet heavy snow that turns into a skating rink, even worse than the ice storms we would get out there."

cycling,fdoylb7,t1_fdovjn9,1578615841.0,"I have seen a large number of them that way. Yes you can get handle bar shifters on the old old models, but it will increase the price of course. Having the down tube shifters really teaches you the art of shifting as well. Old bikes will teach you bicycle maintenance as well."

Mountaineering,fcklh2u,t1_fciyq8l,1577727914.0,Yeah I suppose it is hard to tell what kind of cloud you are in when you are in it. No real reference.
WildernessBackpacking,fchqitb,t1_fchalji,1577653087.0,Usually you body will naturally resort to stored energy and won’t be able to process the number of calories you need. You probably won’t be nearly as hungry as you think. Even for two night you could probably cut back and still be fine. But you are saving weight going stoveless.
