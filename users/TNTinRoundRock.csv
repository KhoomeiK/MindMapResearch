Tools,fe5x9bj,t1_fe5s3ef,1578876988.0,"Yeah decent sized shop.  My overall goal is a ClearVue 1800 system - running 8"" in for several feet, to 6"" pipe all the way to the tool then a short run of 4"" flex.  That seems to be the most efficient.  I won't need to filter as we're out in the country (small ranch) and I'm just going to exhaust the dust outside. When the can fills with chips/dust that will go on the floor for our chicken coop, or I can compress it for fire starter bricks.   

For a shop filter,  I was going to do 2-3 box fans 24"" in size and put a Merv 8-10 filter on them, all tied to one switch.   I hope that will help the air as I do want this for better health !!!"
