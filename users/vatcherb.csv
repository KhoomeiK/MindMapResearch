GetMotivated,ff3jh8c,t1_ff3ht1h,1579542359.0,Yeah I am. It's this messed reality that I either choose to live super poor to try and make it or languish in jobs that are not keeping wages up with simple inflation and become poor that way. This exactly why I'm currently on antidepressants and hopeing that I can work out all my issues with the 3 visits a year with a therapist that my health plan provides (all others I have to pay for out of pocket at full price) so yeah I'm in a burn down the system elect Bernie Sanders kinda mood most days. Glad you have avoided this though. Now off to my houre drive for a ten hour shift that still wont pay me enough just to cover my bills and ability to feed my family with nothing left for any kind of going out for any kind of entertainment and relaxation. There is a whole bunch of us out here.
GetMotivated,ff3hqmp,t1_ff3h1o2,1579541290.0,"So what you're saying is in the end the degree is just checking a needed box and holds almost no weight except to keep out those who have lesser access to higher education (read poor and undesirable) while who you are in good with will lift you up and not your hard work (read already privileged and actually doesn't need the help) And being a women or minority only helps you so the employer can check the ""diversity"" box and pay themselves on the back for being ""inclusive"" while still handing out promotions and bonuses to the white men they like even if they didn't earn or deserve them. Glad we can agree."
GetMotivated,ff3h178,t1_ff3emze,1579540856.0,Sounds like a story of extreme privilege not perseverance.
GetMotivated,ff3fr8r,t1_ff3emze,1579540139.0,Wow so glad that you unlike most Americans have the means and ability to walk away from a full time job and not lose everything. Must have been well off before going back to school.
GetMotivated,ff3d359,t1_ff3c2q0,1579538721.0,Not personal but I have talked to others that have had a spouse resent them for never being available due to work load plus classes. It leaves almost all the household work and child care to them while the student/worker is eventually viewed as selfish because they spend almost all the time they have on improving a career while letting family time fall to the way side. Trading your family for future potential money may not pan out if they aren't there when that future finally comes.
GetMotivated,ff3bv8m,t1_ff3bmvh,1579538105.0,Well now I just have another reason to be sad about the state of American healthcare systems. Damn.
GetMotivated,ff3bnl0,t1_ff38uqx,1579537997.0,Behold! A single person or a married person with no kids or a soon to be divorced and disappointed person.
GetMotivated,ff3b0wh,t1_ff392ub,1579537679.0,Are you sure? Why would someone potentially 15 years from retirement be a better choice than someone just entering the work force when both job seekers have the same degree and the same lack of experience using said degree? Older workers would ask for more pay up front because starting pay would be less than whatever job they put many years into while getting the degree. Also they hold a higher potential of missing more work days due to poor health conditions that are brought on through simply aging. So tell me again how the 50yo makes better business sense? Unless you live in some fantasy world where HR departments care about humans and dont just look at the bottom financial line.
GetMotivated,ff3a92l,t1_ff38zl8,1579537275.0,True. Thay are the end of a generation who could get promoted through hard work and on the job training. Now most places won't let you even enter a supervisor position without a bachelor's degree. Even if the job you would be supervising is a job you have been doing for 15 plus years and know it inside and out and have been fiercely loyal to the company. Chances are they will hire a fresh graduate with no experience at all because degree is greater than knowing what the hell you're doing.
GetMotivated,ff37gxs,t3_ere89c,1579535508.0,"Name an employer who will hire a new graduate with only a bachelor's degree at the age of 50? Oh and not try and start them at base salary for the position because they dont ""have experience"" in that position."

FloridaMan,fby7hr6,t3_eez9n8,1577209962.0,Seems fitting.
