No clue how people are going to deal with her almost non-role in the coming story. I guess they'll just fudge her into more scenes.

Sodden Hill was a fucking disgrace. Yennifer isn't some uber Witch. She's medium level, at best. Also Vilgefortz losing to Cahir...I mean come the fuck on. That's just...just...I mean I hope they explain some kind of bullshit ""I let him win"" or something. Vilgefortz literally makes a mockery of Geralt in swordsmenship in the book. He makes Geralt look like an infant in a fight. In this, he can barely match Cahir, who in the books is an average at best swordsmen.
