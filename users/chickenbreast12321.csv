You literally replied with ‚ÄúSometimes... Sometimes it‚Äôs done as a precaution for non emergent anemia‚Äú, then countered yourself with literature that states otherwise. Perhaps you are having trouble reading replies.

tifu,ff26izo,t1_ff22kyl,1579495212.0,"My last sentence is true because they actually aren‚Äôt as concerned as a lawyer or MBA student would be to attend a prestigious university. Here is some lay friendly literature you can read about. If you don‚Äôt care about working at a top ranked academic center, or in an extremely competitive cash focused environment you would absolutely be fine completing any accredited ACGME residency.

https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/11/do-prestigious-residencies-mean-better-doctors/265038/

You must be thinking about the for profit DO schools or schools in the Caribbean with your questionable accreditation‚Äôs sentence. All US MD schools are thoroughly vetted and have stringent requirements and are audited frequently. Also what medical school you go to (if it‚Äôs in the US) does not dictate at all which residency you will end up at: 

https://www.collegeadmissionspartners.com/bsmd-programs/medical-school-affect-residency-placement/ 

You‚Äôd be surprised at how differently competitive programs rank for different specialties, it‚Äôs not just the ivy associated schools that are the top tier programs. 

It is actually less true that the more well known institutions provide better training, if anything, Med students at Johns Hopkins, Stanford and Harvard often have way less hands on time given the amount of faculty, fellows and resources available (Med students are never going to first assist on a surgical case or have much say in any medical decision making at those schools). Training at an understaffed level 1 trauma in downtown Denver would provide you much better hands on experience. Additionally, rural physicians do see a lot of very complex cases and need to have a broader grasp of general medicine then those in bigger institutions that have separate departments for each individual problem. In fact, there are training programs that specialize toward rural care if that would be something that interested you. If you want to focus on research, the prestige of a big name school would help in getting funding/grants, but it also means that a lot of physicians at big name hospitals are only half time clinicians.

A rare diagnoses is more along the lines of a ‚ÄúDr. House‚Äù type of medicine and is why specialists exist. Physicians hearing hoofbeats are going to think of horses, not zebras. 95% of the cases you see at each training hospitals are going to be the same across the board and you should trust that whichever physician you are seeing is just as capable as one you come across in the middle of nowhere for the vast majority of cases. 

I think you are painting a lot of misguided generalizations across a profession you might not be too familiar with, which is understandable given how complex and convoluted the training process is."

tifu,feyjw04,t1_fewk4gf,1579446497.0,"You really should have a look into medical credentialing these days, it‚Äôs nothing even close to most other graduate degrees and has changed significantly even in the last two decades. All US medical students get ~5000 hours of clinical experience by the time they are through medical school, and after residency training end up around having 15000 hours of clinical hours worked before they even start your job. I would be very surprised if you‚Äôve had 15,000 hours of doing accounting work before actually starting out on your own. It‚Äôs called the practice of medicine for a reason, but I honestly don‚Äôt know another profession that is more standardized then the training of an MD. That‚Äôs why a lawyer from some no name school isn‚Äôt the same as a lawyer from a top 10, but a doctor who trained in a some no name hospital is just as qualified as one who trained in Boston at managing general medical issues."
