But the thing is, this thinking is 100% unreasonable. I get where you and the OP are coming from, but every time I see things like this, it's like...

***yeah but those aren't thoughts that people with non-ED prone thought processes have, so we can't say that saying anything about BF% is gonna hit someone with the ED arrow.***

If I knew I was obese by BF%, I'd first of all assume I'd be able to tell, and I'd second of all start working out, not starving myself. That's what I imagine anyone who is thinking outside the parameters of ED town is thinking. Given how few people actually have EDs, I'm also gonna assume that saying something about BF% doesn't have a high chance of putting someone I'm next to into a tailspin.

Basically, those thoughts are one individual's own responsibility to control, and no one made anyone have those thoughts by talking about a real problem and a real metric."

She watches a dude on Youtube, 'Artisan Bread with Steve' or something? And it's literally just... slap the shit together, mix it with a wooden spoon handle, cover it and let it proof overnight, then moosh it again and proof it another time.

Here's a recipe (EDITED lol my mom came and swiftly corrected me):

\-16 oz cool water

\-1.25 tsp salt

\-1/2 tsp yeast

\-2 cups bread flour

1 and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (or just 3.5 cups of bread flour if you just want white bread)

Mix water, salt, and yeast, then add flour and beat it up until it's all combined, then plop the ball in a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap and let it sit for 12-24 hours. (My mom makes it at like 6pm and then lets it sit until 10am-ish the next morning.)

Next morning it's gonna be a big poof lol. Mix it again, plop it in a sprayed/greased loaf pan (ETA: my mom rolls it around a bit in flour, not too much but just so the dough is no longer a sticky thing and in a loaf shape), and cover it and let it proof for another \*hour and a half. Set the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and make sure your oven racks are set up so the bread will be in the middle of the oven.

Bake that thang for 40min and put it on a cooling rack.

The hardest part of making bread is literally just waiting for it to proof and making sure you have a not-chilly place to store it so the yeast can do its thing."

Cops aren't gonna just let you run away from a fuckin traffic stop because if that were the case, traffic laws would not mean anything, dude.

Alright, same thing still applies. If you owe 10,000, and you only pay 9,800 like a self righteous dipshit, then... welcome to Penalty Town? It's not... hard to understand where I'm coming from, IMO. Considering the expenses that people who willfully throw their health away on stupid shit like fast food and cigarettes cost taxpayers in countries with socialized medicine (like England), it'd only be fair that these people be held accountable for those COMPLETELY unnecessary charges with an increased premium (if that's how the healthcare model still works) or higher taxes if it's entirely tax based.

And yes. If you don't pay your taxes, you get your ass arrested. Not for a billion years, but for a slap-on-the-wrist time the first time (no more than a few days) and steadily up from there if you continue to be a dipshit (as in, have no signs of trying to remedy your situation but stay the same weight or don't get any help for quitting cigs or anything).

As for your cop question, that's a stupid question, because unless the person getting arrested flips out or resists arrest (edit: I mean like, actively resists with weapons or some shit), I can see no reason why (assuming the cops aren't total fuckin lunatics) they would use deadly force?

fatlogic,fdelysr,t3_ekylim,1578341833.0,"I mean, in a way this person is *kinda* right in that yeah, not every food has all the nutrients you need, and yeah, a veggie stir fry (which is also decently high in fat depending on how much oil you use) might not necessarily help with *weight loss* goals any more than a cheeseburger, but this person isn't following their own advice. It's not all about one thing.

Let's say we have a calorically equivalent stir fry and cheeseburger. The fat in the stir fry is most likely coming from oils (sesame, maybe olive if you're not specifically shooting for Asian food). The burger's fat is coming from animal fats (dairy, meat), which have been shown to not be as good for your arteries as olive oil. Similarly, yes, nut butters are calorically dense, but that oil won't fuck you up like straight lard from bacon will (if you eat it regularly enough).

Foods as a *concept* aren't a problem. You can eat pizza--IF you're either eating a small amount of a commercial one, or you take the steps to modify it so you can eat more (making a thin or cauliflower crust, using lowfat cheese, skipping oilier meats like pepperoni for ones like ham, using a majority of fresh veggies). You can eat a burger--IF you're eating a reasonable portion of a commercial one (not these fuckin monstrosities they keep coming out with) or make your own with fresh veggies and a simple patty made of lean beef (or turkey, or even veggies!).

It's a game of *balance*, and it seems that to these people, if you can't eat ALL OF IT, UNRESTRAINED, FULLY LOADED, 24/7, then it's some sign of great distress or depravity or general loss. Which is... so stupid."

It is 100% your fault if you gain the weight back. Granted, no one really tells you what the next step of hitting your goal weight is (maintenance, which is a tricky beast at first), but like??????? It's?????? Really not that fuckin hard, fam!!! Eat more, and if you notice the scale creep up, scale it back and eat less than that until you find an amount that helps you stay within a range of a couple pounds or so!!

But these people define having an ED as not eating for 3 people every meal. If we follow that definition, then lmao I will NEVER understand how the patriarchy thinks it's gonna control people by... making them eat normal portions and getting regular, strength-building exercise that increases their abilities??????"
fatlogic,fcvtqv2,t1_fcuii1o,1578009906.0,"Right, so I can see that the FRY part of the fry bread is probably just as big of a culprit, however I'm still going to say that white bread (made of bleached and enriched white flour) is not as good for you as maize, fruits, potatoes, etc. I understand that these people did have carbs, but they also didn't have farm raised dairy and bacon and other things that have become a Western staple, which touches on your point about fat being the real culprit.

I still think that because white bread is simple, it is therefore easier to overeat because it doesn't keep you as full for long. Obviously if you're super hungry after eating a bunch of bread, its easy to think you just didnt eat enough and go back to eat more (and let's remember, to your point again, how much people love butter on their bread). However, the reality is they blew their caloric budget on stuff that doesn't actually have all that they need in it, because it's processed white flour and not grains like oats, rice, or starches like potato.

I wouldn't call this broscience, though. It's common knowledge that more protein and fewer simple carbs (because that does matter; simple carbs don't come with the fiber necessary to break them down and release their sugars slowly for more stable energy) help a lot with satiety, and a lot of convenience snacks, or even just Old Worldâ„¢ food in general, is essentially all carb and not much else (which, to your point about swole dudes eating honey, is made a problem because these people are no longer out there doing the things that keep them swole).

TL;DR: I see what you're saying, and I agree with a lot of it, but also white flour (especially super refined/bleached flour) is still real bad for people in general regardless of time period and sedentary lifestyles do not help this issue lol"

The other day I managed to run 17.5min at 6mph before I had to take a break, but today I couldn't (made it to 12:30 before i took a 60sec break). The difference? The first time I was in total la-la land, zoning out to music. The second time my music playlist wasn't songs I super liked, so I wasn't as In the Zoneâ„¢. Today I thought I'd give out at 23min, but I buckled down and decided to just GOOO until 25. And it happened!

(one day I'll be able to just run 25-30 min straight at 6mph lmaoo)

But the body will always try to go back to the activity of least resistance/discomfort. The body will never *want* to lift a weight multiple times or run like hell; it wants to sit down and do nothing until food floats near it.

If that's not exercising the brain--the ability to buckle down, endure, and not only reach but exceed goals--then IDK what is. Training the body requires an incredibly strong mind to endure and push through the discomfort, to keep proper form, etc."
