TwoXChromosomes,few4sl0,t3_epmn8q,1579405364.0,"If you have to lie about it, don't do it. 

I'm super glad I've overcome the insane trust issues I developed through relationships (mainly one) where I was constantly lied to about this behavior (& physical cheating too). It's taken nearly a decade, lots of therapy and took a few years of my current partner working with me for me to finally be totally comfortable with his life outside of me. My partner even hangs out with an ex! It's wonderful. It's not ok that I developed these controlling tendencies, but it was an effect from THIS kind of behavior (& again, physical cheating). I truly hope that you, OP, get a chance to work through the bullshit your dad (& uncle) put you & your family through."
fatlogic,fe6doo1,t1_fe6dlw3,1578887870.0,I have no idea what my tongue does when I sleep.
fatlogic,fe5h504,t1_fe5d9r8,1578869401.0,"I quite enjoy your doctor. 

I have pretty significant allergies but I don't snore nightly. If my nose isn't clogged, I sleep mouth closed (fat tongue down I suppose üòÇ)."
fatlogic,fe5gvpi,t1_fe5g0v2,1578869275.0,"I went through a sleep study, I didn't have any incidents of not breathing. If it's just making me snore a bit, truly it wasn't even severe snoring only a half hour out of entire night... I think cutting out my tongue to shorten it & shave the sides down seems a bit extreme."
BDSMcommunity,fe5emfr,t3_enqcyy,1578868472.0,"Yupppp. I had a few really great scenes just a few weeks ago that left me satiated but also craving -more-. School started + lots of medical appointments & I don't have time or energy to even have vanilla sex none the less a true scene!! Been frustrated but my Hitachi does a good job at killing the irritability at least (& I don't have to be I'm the right mind set for it to make me cum)! Trying to schedule a nice soothing service scene (as a Top) for tomorrow after a procedure. Sometimes small acts of service (foot rubs, tea time, etc) can reallllly hit the spot when stressed."
fatlogic,fe54qfe,t1_fe3uwtp,1578865640.0,"I had a sleep Dr who recommended I get my tongue shaved down because it's ""too big for my mouth"". I still think he was insane, even after reading this, because I had no incidents of apena... Only some slight snoring."

fatlogic,fdzshev,t1_fdyv9ry,1578794739.0,"THIS. I used to spend a lot of time & energy thinking everyone else was judging me, preaching how fats are people too etc etc. Spoiler alert: no one was judging me but me, no one was justifying my existence but me. 

What a fucking waste of time that was."

benzorecovery,fdx9gb8,t3_en76e5,1578766610.0,"My taper took give or take 3 years. I held A LOT & often. I feel like holding really helped me out, some decreases were harder than others, some felt much easier, sometimes there was something going on in my life that I needed to not be sick for (ie having to move). I was really fortunate to have a NP who agreed with the Ashton's method & was for with me holding. 
Taking your time getting off is essential imo. Take it slow & easy, you'll get there."

fatlogic,fdx1kfd,t3_en3n2o,1578764352.0,"Wowwwwwwwwww.

I've truly experienced a partner projecting their eating disorder onto me, this really pisses me off. It was pretty fucked up to be complimented when too sick to eat, or promised marriage once I was thin enough. It certainly did not look like the person asking this question, at all. The person asking this question seems like such a loving, supportive partner & def should ask an actual supportive fitness friendly person these questions!!"
fatlogic,fdclxir,t1_fdce4st,1578278181.0,"As a diabetic, I support this.

My shits turned around now but I've seen the folks who don't turn it around. Losing a foot or going blind isn't a good time."
fatlogic,fdbsc9h,t1_fdbppsb,1578261185.0,"Yes! Totally agree. Eating well & excerise are not punishments, both are self care. 

Identifying with something so superficial just feels sad now that I feel in control of my life- which is what eating well & excerise has provided me with."
fatlogic,fdbnlei,t1_fda6sop,1578259177.0,"""fat is just an adjective, it's not about your self worth"" üôå I feel the FA/body positive movement started out good & well & with that statement as a baseline. It's just a characteristic, it's not an identity.... But now it's become an identity! Even if feeling stuck and unhappy in their abilities to walk or do everyday tasks because their weight- I fear that these people will never be able to lose because of their attachment to this identity. It started with ""body size doesn't mean anything about a person's worth"".... But now it seems to them it means -everything-."

fatlogic,fd3cpit,t3_ejwt2k,1578156932.0,"Yet I lost 95lbs & my type 2 has ""reversed"" ü§î my bio grandfather had his foot amputated due to diabetes complications, my doctor knows that & still says my pancreas is kicking ass right now. My a1c was highest when my weight was at its highest... My shitty genes are the origin, but the weight encouraged the insulin resistance. I still can fuck up my pancreas if I eat unnecessary sugar daily, even at 95lbs lighter... But come the fuck on, it's clear as day to me that obesity raises risks AND complications from diabetes. Those rare fit people who get type 2 rarely rarely have to get a foot amputated from complications. Do you want to lose your foot, Karen? This logic is how you lose a fucking foot."
fatlogic,fd3b95c,t1_fd379sj,1578156542.0,Exception to the rule. Not the norm.
benzorecovery,fciocpq,t1_fcinxes,1577666043.0,"Valium was rough for me. I had no tolerance built up, so it was very sedating. But it's been over two years since I fully got off & I haven't gone back, I don't have protracted withdrawal! I was on high doses of kolonopin for years & years, I didn't think recovery would be possible. Ashton's method was so successful for me!!!! I hope it's just as successful for you!! You've got this!!! & At the end of the tunnel is a life that's just so much better."
fatlogic,fchp38s,t1_fchodx2,1577652653.0,There's also an anti inflammatory diet that helped me when it was bad (& I still go back to it when my joint pain from hypermobility gets bad.. which isn't so often now that I've lost weight). CBD to get through the bad days.
fatlogic,fchodx2,t1_fchnpv4,1577652399.0,Massage therapy & yoga were recommended to me. My doctor thinks it slid back in during overuse though. I was caregiving & often had to help my dude get off the floor after falls. Dr said sometimes during a potential injury that opens up the vertebra herniated disks can get worse... Or slide back in place. Not to be cliche but I feel very blessed & sympathize greatly for those who endure that pain.
fatlogic,fcgt2qc,t1_fcgq7ks,1577643744.0,"Fat has never stopped people from eye fucking or coming onto me. Now they just loudly do it, when I'm clearly just trying to buy groceries or walk down the street. Honestly, the increased unwanted sexual attention has been my least favorite aspect of weight loss. When attention increased, I decided to start lifting so now I feel capable of protecting myself ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm sure others appreciate the attention, but I truly just want men to leave me alone."
fatlogic,fcgcxsf,t3_eh6ews,1577638748.0,"Even if I don't mention weight loss, people get upset when I mention the gym or lifting or trying to get more protein. People get upset when I turn down treats because it supposedly implies to them that I think less of them for eating treats. I still eat treats, I just don't want your shitty grocery store cupcake, Karen!! The gym is my fucking hobby!! It's also helped me battle my seasonal depression! Lifting helps me feel capable after many years of chronic pain (had a herniated disc that magically slid back into place)!! How come others can discuss what they like but my interests aren't allowed? How come other bodies are allowed to be celebrated, but my new strength which came with -gasp- some weight loss is invalid?? I'm not even thin, I'm still overweight! But suddenly I'm having people turn their backs on me, saying I must think I'm better than them... Seems like an awful lot of fucking projection & hypocrisy."
fatlogic,fcb9db2,t3_egz0q0,1577584061.0,"I mean, I do agree that fitness is supposed to be fun & not a punishment. But, I also give no fucks how other people want to live their lives. Working out as punishment doesn't work for me, maybe it suites others.

Rest of that sub is very.... Wow."
ZeroWaste,fcajet5,t3_egv05j,1577570329.0,I'm a big fan of sea sponges!!! Not great for days I'm in public all day though as it's a bit awkward to wash at a public sink üòÇ I'll have to check these out for those days!

fatlogic,fc9dp6w,t1_fc935g6,1577551069.0,"I met someone who claims to break chairs because they're meant for thin people. Having seen how this person plops their whole body down, HARD along with how they hamfist doors, knobs, etc. I have determined they break chairs (& other things) not because their weight but because of how roughly they treat things. Have tried to mention this, including how they close doors always with a big slam & they say they cannot control the amount of noise their big, huge body makes.


I've weighed as much as they say they weigh, I never broke a chair or slammed a door because of my weight. I was taught to be delicate with things because they couldn't be replaced or fixed. Everytime I hear someone complain about chairs breaking, I can't help but think of this person purposefully being rough on furniture just to blame thin people and their thin people chairs.

Edited to say this person describes their own body as big & huge, not my descriptors."
