aww,fdrukpt,t1_fdriimb,1578689990.0,"Koalas and dogs
The facts
On average, approximately 110 koalas are attacked and killed by dogs each year. 
Records indicate that between 1997 and 2008 the Department of Environment 
and Heritage Protection’s (EHP) Moggill Koala Hospital and the Australian Wildlife 
Hospital at Beerwah admitted around 1400 koalas that had been attacked by dogs. 
Most dog attacks are fatal, making dog attacks the third most common cause of 
death after disease (relating to habitat loss) and vehicle strikes.
A survey of dog attacks in South East Queensland has identified the key elements 
of the issue. These are:

• Most attacks on koalas take place in the dog’s own backyard.

• Not all dogs attack koalas. Dogsover 10 kg were responsible for 96 per cent of 
attacks on koalas. Generally, the larger the dog, the greater the likelihood that 
it could be responsible for a fatal attack on a koala.

• Although dog attacks occur throughout the year, they are more likely to occur 
between July and November (peaking in September). This is when koalas are 
breeding and therefore more mobile.

• If there are two or more dogs present at a property there is a higher 
incidence of attack.

• Attacks on sick koalas are no more frequent than healthy ones.

• It should also be remembered that koalas are capable of defending themselves. 
They have sharp teeth and claws capable of causing deep wounds and any dog 
that attacks a koala may risk serious injury."

Koalas have pretty sharp claws, they're also pretty nasty bastards when they want to be especially when they're in hospital, can you imagine trying to put mittens onto a wild animal who just wants to be left alone to eat eucalyptus leaves. If you want to help the koalas, buy some forest land, donate money but ffs stop sending mittens!"
