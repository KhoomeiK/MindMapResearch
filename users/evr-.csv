You make it sound like they want to balance the game, which would essentially mean they'd have to rework every frame, ability, weapon and arcane, in addition to enemies, their stats and how their AI works. I honestly don't think they can manage it.

There's so many variables affecting things that they'd either have to smooth everything over to the point where the choice of you frame or weapon doesn't matter since it's all viable or just accept that some things till be useless.

They had a chance to prove they could balance things with railjacks since it's a very limited game mode with little variation in weapons, defensive stuff and enemies and they missed the mark. A well equipped railjack is essentially immortal and can wreck hordes of fighters in no time. The only reason we can't just curb stomp crewships is because they decided we can't unless we use the forward artillery.

If they can't manage like 5 defensive Avionics and three varities of shields I don't they can manage 40+ frames with varying defensive abilities,a ton of defensive mods, companions with additional defensive mods and arcanes. And that's not even counting in how offensive abilities help survival."
