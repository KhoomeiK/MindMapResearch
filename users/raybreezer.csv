When I first started with Docker, I had no idea how to do anything but make a LAMP stack in one container per site.

I’m at the point where I am using docker-compose with a mix of my own dockerfiles/images and those I find online. I’m currently using a MySQL container that is networked (because I later found out about linking) to multiple web containers with an Nginx reverse proxy container I found on docker hub. 

I understand how a reverse proxy would normally work in a “normal” LAMP environment, but the container I’m running is doing some behind the scenes magic where it can figure out which container to direct traffic to based off an environment variable with the domain name of the site hosted in that container.

I think there’s some docker data that is brought in as a volume that then is used in conjunction with a script that recreates the config file for the reverse proxy any time a container is added, removed or the IP changes. That’s the part that is fuzzy to me. Thing is, I’m not sure that’s a typical scenario.

What I’d like to see, is something that discusses security as well. There’s a lot that I used to do to harden a LAMP stack that I’m not sure how to translate over to docker."
docker,feo3qr5,t1_feo2p0r,1579294671.0,"Damn, your nutshell just blew my mind.

I didn't realize that I needed Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to make that work. I had heard of the terms before, but I thought that I needed some sort of container that would manage traffic as needed.

Honestly, the fact is that there are very few (if any) resources that walk you through learning Docker from absolutely not knowing anything about it to being able to roll it out in a production environment. I've only gotten as far as I have by running into very specific issues and trying to overcome them.

Like, I understand the basics of needing to create volumes to store persistent data, and I get the theory of running multiple containers to be able to manage load balancing and such. But none of the tutorials I've found go into how to scale a docker environment. Hell, it took me a while to get to the point I am at now where I can actually run a MySQL container and various web containers with an Nginx reverse proxy... but that was because I found a container that was designed to do that...

I'm actually playing the first Hellblade on PS4 at the moment, and they had a small example of that on the PS4 Pro. In the menu, there is an option to allow the game to prioritize reaching 60 FPS by sacrificing a small amount of texture quality or to let it run as best as it can with full quality.

For anyone curious, [here](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2019/12/12/microsoft-unveils-xbox-series-x/) is the Series X article and [here](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/04/11/inside-xbox-one-x-enhanced-hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/) is more info from Hellblade 1.

I've made up my mind that the Series X will be my first Xbox console. I've never owned one, but I've wanted to play some of the many exclusive games that have come out over the years. Because of this, the fact that Series X is going to be fully backward compatible is a huge selling point to me. That being said, I won't be buying it on launch day because having been a long-time Playstation fan, my priority will be the PS5 along with potentially the PSVR 2 if and when that happens.

That being said, I can understand OP's concern from a different standpoint... I am pretty sure that I will only take the plunge of buying the Series X once there is an exclusive game for it that I won't be able to get on PS5. Already with the Switch, I'm finding that the only games I play on it are the exclusive games that were designed with the Switch in mind. Any game that is both available on the PS4 and Switch will automatically lose my interest in getting it for the Switch. While I can't say that I will always prefer getting games on the PS5 once I eventually own both, the fact is that as a selling point, I know that there won't be anything I'll be missing on the PS5 during the first ""year or two"".

I hope that this post isn't coming off as standoffish. I am simply here because I'm interested in discussing this with you all."

I'm trying to come up with some logical reasoning, and the only thing I can think of is that it hadn't been able to connect to the internet and it had now finally been able to respond... Admittedly, there are a lot of problems with this working theory, but its all I've got."

Enjoy your gift OP! Looks like your Santa did great!"
PleX,fe8hfms,t1_fe8h0g5,1578926167.0,"Fair point. I guess I hadn't thought about that one due to the fact that the last time I had a Netflix account, it was way back when they still didn't let you have multiple accounts.  I mean damn, I remember having to tell it if I liked the DVD I just returned... Time flies..."

PleX,fe8gj76,t1_fe8fefn,1578925905.0,">FYI swapping home users is as trivial as changing profiles on netflix

I guess I've never understood that one either...

I didn't mean to sound like I was criticizing, I was just replying similarly to the way you did.

Don't get me wrong, if we had kids, I would definitely set up a new account for them to block certain content, I can even see the need for a couple that isn't living together or are apart often. I just don't see the need for a couple who usually watch TV together.

The reason for my question was due to the assumption that they had a separate account."
PleX,fe8f2z5,t1_fe8emh4,1578925482.0,"My wife and I mostly watch plex via a FireStick on our TV. We do stream to our personal devices some times, but for the most part, any TV shows we watch together, we won't watch without the other and any tv shows we watch by ourselves we just watch by ourselves... Why would I want two separate accounts we would have to constantly be switching on the FireStick?"
PleX,fe8dix3,t1_fe6491x,1578925047.0,"I have a question for you. Is there a particular reason you assumed she had her own account? I know what some of the benefits of having a separate account would be, but my wife and I just have one account for the household and the other accounts for friends are just plex accounts I share my library with.

I guess what I'm asking is, why would a married couple have two separate accounts? I'm genuinely curious."
PleX,fe8cddl,t3_enxgne,1578924745.0,"Man, this almost makes divorce worth it! /s

I love my wife and are happily married, so I guess suffering the shit shows on my plex server will have to do for now. I hope you're doing ok though."

How's everyone else doing?"
funny,fe6n4oh,t1_fe6821n,1578896657.0,So did I... I thought the funny part was going to be how scared she was going to be running from it after it “attacked” her.
technews,fdzuaxj,t1_fdzj6dn,1578795963.0,"I had a Bright House (what is now Spectrum in my area) cable installer force me to allow him to set up my “new email address” on my computer. I told him I was not going to use it as I was happy with Gmail. That’s when he told me that it was required of him to do so.

I imagine this is part of the reason why some people felt they had to use it."
