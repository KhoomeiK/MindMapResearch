ADHD,fbtzg8a,t1_fbtpysa,1577103657.0,"I tried listening to podcasts, and I don’t know if this is weird, but they just annoyed me. Like because I couldn’t see them and only could hear them I hated it, I found it hard to concentrate on what they were saying. I would rather watch a podcast, like H3H3 who posts his podcast on YouTube."
