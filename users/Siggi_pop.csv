As I said, Shadow IT often exist because there isn't a budget for 'professional' IT and software solutions. So it's either a risky solution or no solution. But there are good sides as well! Puting aside the code practices, Shadow IT participants usually have a better in depth understanding of business requirements than outside consultants, because they are often the creators and users at the same time. How often does a professional firm deliver a production that lives up 100% to expectations and has zero bugs? Honestly, probably newer."
badcode,ffdplj9,t1_ffdep69,1579825937.0,"You are right it's not pretty, and yeah author probably did use a globally scoped variable unless it's declared and assigned inline with the rest in the top, outside the screen capture. This person probably doesn't work in a team of developers, but is the smartest (IT) guy in the room of a non-tech office. Shadow IT, fragile and unsecure as it might be, often appears because of a necessity and no budget and most often it creates great value for thoses benefiting from it. It's easy to point out lack of good coding practices of people who aren't hired or payed mainly to code."

badcode,ffdawfl,t1_ffd2sgq,1579816916.0,"The author used it as a flag, it's easier to switch between true/false than to commenting out the code. Sometimes it needs to run, but as default it should be skipped."
badcode,ffd9yfv,t1_ffc6bub,1579816332.0,"It's not likely exposed like you might think. Code is incapsulated in a void method that doesn't take any input parameters so variables are scoped inside the block (as long as no global variables are declared). If you had access and could change the concatenated string, then you most likely already have access to the entire source code. It's more likely a script/batch job that is used- and maintained by single indivudual. Also that constant false if statement, is most likely just a flag that the lazy author changes whenever needed."

badcode,fel2ws5,t3_epf0nn,1579212896.0,"Whish html had some way to do this, like a style section that could somehow be inserted has a part of the html document itself, preferable using xml style tags. And it should be able combine different rules, perhaps in hiracical in order to let design priciples cascade to child elements. And also it would be nice to have the option to refer to styling definition from a common document or sheet so it could be shared and reused over and over. Cascading Style Sheet could be a name candidate!?"
