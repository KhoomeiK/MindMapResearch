The US government ACCUSES Iran of orchestrating it and that's the only link between that incident and Iran. The general may have been behind it, but where's the proof? And that conveniently becomes the excuse to assassinate a sovereign state's military leader. This is no different from the US storming Iraq looking for WMDs; lying to gullible Americans to justify an unnecessary aggression. What's sad is Americans defending this aggression which will result in the loss of many lives just for a stupid flex by a giant orange baby and his ""administration"""
