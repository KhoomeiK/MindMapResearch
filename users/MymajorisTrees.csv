He picked up a really nice kitchen knife set and I found a tea cup with a cartoon character from my childhood. He offered to pay for it which was nice so I let him since it was only .69 cents. Now any time I see that little tea cup (I keep an air plant in it) it makes me think about our first date. We celebrate one year next month and will recreate our first date for our anniversary (:

bulletjournal,fcbi7fx,t3_egspv9,1577587175.0,[here is the link to some of my sprocket photos ](https://imgur.com/gallery/cjsFefd)  I use VSCO to edit them and I typically darken all my photos and then print them. I love my sprocket and it truly changed the game for me and bullet journaling! I keep a planner/diary in my bujo and a monthly reflection with photos and stickers and important things. I personally love my 2nd edition.
