Benzos are without a doubt one of the worst drugs to withdrawal from. Same with alcohol. I gotta ask, how much were you taking and for how long? 

Not only is there a possibility of death (small, but it's there), they both cause DTs (which are what can kill you). Benzo withdrawal entails weeks of feeling psychotic, delirious, horribly anxious, and on the verge of death. On top of that, you continue to suffer from depression, anxiety, insomnia, and muscle aches and twitches for months to years. 

I've withdrawn from opioids, benzos, SSRIs, SNRIs, nicotine, and gabapentin. Benzos are without a doubt at the top of my list. 

SSRIs and SNRIs are probably second, because of how long the withdrawal lasts and how overtly intrusive it all is. Weeks to months of muscles cramps, brain zaps, twitching, irritability, and isnsomia.

Opioids are third because although it fucking sucked balls, the worst of it didn't last that long (in a relative sense) and there weren't any lasting effects in my case. It was unimaginably physically painful, however. I was dependent on hydrocodone, for reference. Hydrocodone doesn't have a particularly long half life like buprenorphine or methadone, nor is it as potent, but I was taking absolutely massive doses. 

I've yet to experience withdrawal from kratom, and I've taken it months at a time in decent sized doses.

I have heard that Phenibut withdrawal is particularly awful, but I've never experienced it myself, so I can't list it.

The problem is that scav runs are timed. I also can't say I agree that scav runs alone are the best way to get ahead (mostly because they're timed).

If you die as a scav, you don't get anything *and* you have to wait around 20 minutes before you can do anything again. That puts a limit on their usefulness. 

As it stands now, alternating between scav runs and pistol runs is probably the best bet until you start getting better gear. 

>None of the suggested fixes would have any impact on people who actually want to try rags to riches, which you are right is an interesting challenge.

Yeah, I took that into account while making those suggestions. Going in with bare minimum loot (pistol and some mags, maybe a vest and bag) and trying to come out ahead is a valid strategy, and in no way is it an exploit. 

The game revolves around a very ""do what you have to do/want to do"" playstyle. It's silly to me to shame someone for playing it how they want to.

I'd also say that the majority of people run into raids wearing some level of gear. I don't see how it's necessary for everyone to bring their best all of the time. It might make it a better experience for *you*, but it's not really practical. Not every raid needs be balls-to-the-wall action.

I'd just really like to drive home the point that rags to riches is a completely valid way to play the game. Even if you aren't broke, it's fun to do and it in no way ""breaks the game"". The game is a sandbox to some degree. It purposefully allows these freedoms, and part of the risk of these runs is that you're much more likely to die during conflict. That's your choice to make.

You may think it's ""lame"", but that doesn't mean you need to gatekeep how others play the game. There's enough geared players to fight as is, even with this so called ""hatchling problem"". When they balance containers, it'll be even more of a non-issue.

Well, neither of us know what his original plan going in was, but we can use the video for context. 

Lots of people will go into a raid with only melee or a pistol, try to kill a scav and get better weapons or find a body, then continue on looking for better loot. Then, once you're satisfied, you extract. 

It seems to me like that was his plan here, as that's exactly what he did (or at least tried to do). Assuming any further than that doesn't really get us anywhere. 

>Why is the community so selective about what is a good hatchling vs a bad hatchling?

Because context matters.

>The fact is, this entire game's premise relies on risk vs. reward and people need to get on board with the fact that it's game breaking that someone can reliably make money with no risk.

The risk with rags to riches is that you still have to extract with the loot. You could very well be gunned down on your way out. You wouldn't have gained anything at that point that you couldn't have gained going in fully geared and dying. 

Someone who goes in with full gear can still rush high-loot areas and stuff their secure container full of goodies. 

It seems to me that this community has a problem with secure containers in general. The ""hatchling problem"" wouldn't exist if secure containers didn't exist. Thus, ultimately, it isn't even a ""hatching problem"". 

You could theoretically put a ""minimum"" on the gear that you need to be able to raid, but then that completely breaks the game for people who don't have anything. You could also make it so that if you disconnect, you only keep what was originally in your container, but people would still rush in and either kill themselves or just rush out. You could also change which items are allowed in your container, but that may affect the difficulty of certain quests. 

At the end of the day, you guys have a lot of misguided anger. Instead of going after the mechanic that allows this behavior, you go after people who play the game differently from you along with the people who exploit the mechanic that the devs implemented. That, to me, is the broken logic.

It's time to accept that there are multiple valid ways to play the game, and that the game itself still needs balancing."

Futurology,fdgx0nq,t1_fdgw1a9,1578410414.0,"Well, you can get distillate which is practically 100% THC. 

Shatter usually hovers between 70 and mid 90s. Any higher and you basically have distillate. 

One of the key features of shatter is that it still contains a medley of cannabinoids and (sometimes) terpenes. Distillate is just a single, isolated chemical (could be CBD, THC, or any other cannabinoid)."

It's definitely a little tricky figuring it out, and I've still got a lot to learn. The shape you're trying to cast is a large variable when it comes to difficulty. Doing knife scales took me a couple tries to figure out, but then I got a few good casts. 

I've definitely had fun doing all of it. Just be prepared to get burned a lot."

I *can* say that it's pretty cruddy in the beginning of the melt, and gets more efficient as it goes on. Either way, I get substantially more metal than I do dross. 

To guesstimate; last time i did a melt, i think I got around 5 or 6 pounds of aluminum and a little under a pound of dross. 

I'll take note of the weights next time I do it.
