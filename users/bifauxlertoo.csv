bipolar2,feosghn,t3_eq2b42,1579304775.0,"NPR drives me bonkers sometimes, this may be why."
bipolar2,feos75w,t3_eq402r,1579304680.0,"My doc has med leave paperwork ready for whenever we need to pull that trigger to save my job. Plus we agreed it would say major depressive disorder instead of bipolar, specifically to avoid the stigma.

Take care of you, friend. I hope new doors open soon for you and any others who need it."
bipolar2,fenfthx,t1_femv2mo,1579283769.0,"Oh I feel this. I missed a meeting and instead of ho-hum no big dealing it, I spun into a wild web of lies, must go home, hate myself, thought how I’m going to lose this job for the most basic shit and now I’m just trying to pick up the pieces and put today and yesterday squarely behind me."
bipolar,fen9xo1,t1_fem67ht,1579280160.0,Oof my friend. It sure isn’t all euphoria and beauty. Don’t let the good manic times fool you. The bad ones are usually just around the corner. Reach for stable. Find your bliss there my friend
bipolar,fen9ql7,t3_epvtl1,1579280040.0,"Over 30 here. Missed a work appointment and that sent me down the dark and twisty path. Couldn’t function for basic tasks, went into a slight rage, lied about the reasons for my behavior, left work in a mental battleground of “you’re a pile of garbage” and “no your not”, cleaned the house, roleplayed what I would do or say about my absence for hours, slept 3 hours, waking up constantly thinking I had to be some where. Now I’m just hoping I get through today so this can be in my past."
Art,fehvamx,t3_ep8oxf,1579124573.0,I love your style. Keep doing you!

bipolar,fdxi4au,t1_fdxba5e,1578768891.0,So so often mania goes anger. And I’m not on Wellbutrin FWIW
actuallesbians,fdxfw5b,t3_en48e4,1578768346.0,"I wish I had that ability to be that tactful, respectful, and articulate in situations with authority."
bipolar2,fdxebmc,t3_en9wsn,1578767919.0,"
That movie triggered me too. Except I was in the theater. 


Consider yourself lucky that the triggering happened when you were in a safe place."
bipolar2,fdxcrza,t3_en56sa,1578767492.0,"I feel like I can’t trust myself to talk to others for fear of taking them on this ride with me.

Can’t trust who I’m going to be. Sucks."
suggestmeabook,fdcb3uk,t1_fdannbx,1578270735.0,"Or how casar in Portuguese means to hunt or to marry. The correct meaning is always conveyed without words.

Appreciate your writing and response."
bipolar,fdc9wf8,t1_fdc4osr,1578269989.0,It immediately had me singing “she’s a maniac”
suggestmeabook,fdaidk4,t1_fda4t9i,1578246457.0,"I’m going to put some real thought to this. I do think it could help.

Though I don’t think it’s social engineering. That would be convincing A to give 3 away, now B has more or close to the same."
bipolar,fdah05m,t3_ekcw5r,1578246027.0,"I reviewed the sub for apps, got all my questions answered (privacy and data concerns mostly), and chose to go w eMoods. Thanks to that user that emailed the author (sorry I forgot your name). I love that I can tune this thing to what I want to stay on top of (meditate, exercise, etc). Worth the $10! (Oh and that user that emailed the author said they will give it to you for free if you email and let them know your situation). I paid so can’t confirm."

bipolar,fc9isxh,t3_egs3v0,1577553285.0,"I have been on rex for a few weeks. Went from .5 to 1. I think it helps and haven’t noticed weight gain.  It is the holidays though. My doc said the weight gain would be minimal w this stabilizer which was promising. I have also skipped a few days and mostly I noticed my brain feeling more squirrelly. But no nausea like with my antidepressant, fetzima.  Hope my experience helps!"

Skincare_Addiction,fc6twco,t3_eganp0,1577489382.0,"I had blackheads similar to yours and used meadowfoam oil as a precleanse and I that did the trick. Perhaps try an oil cleanse with a neutral oil your skin tolerates. I’m guessing it wouldn’t make things worse...(note, I’m not a doc or esthetician)"
