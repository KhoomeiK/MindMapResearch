This happens most in carboys, as the level rises the available surface area shrinks. It stays like this until you poke a hole in it, or internal pressure is stronger than the cap.

Staggered nutrients. Instead of putting all the nutrients in the beginning, you split them into pitch, then again at 24/48/72 hours, and before you use up a third of sugars. (Sugar break) It prevents first generations from going hog wild and eating everything, leaving later generations to starve. Essentially. I can't talk well enough about yeast life cycle to give an in depth answer.

Anyway nutrients are a dry powder, adding them creates nucleation points: spots where gases easily come out of solution. If you do that without degassing, all your co2 will come out at once and paint the ceiling.

So I always advise degassing, then pull a sample to dissolve nutrients in. Then restore that to the jug/bucket."

The character I've used through OC/SOU/HOTU (rog/ftr/WM) has always relied on items for strength, so I don't know how useful the feat set actually is in single player.  

You get 6 stat boosts by level 25, so you'd have to be level 1 with 19 strength.  If you take the epic feats for stat boosts, you can drop that score to 17 or maybe 16.

No it wouldn't. Joe doesn't go to jail because his son did something stupid.

Trump doesn't have authority to cut aid. It is illegal to make it contingent on a private quid pro quo. Did you even read the memo which spelled it out?

Apparently you are."

It is a separate case. 

Let's say you rob me, and later I take a bat to your legs in revenge. I don't get to avoid an assault charge because you stole from me.

If hunter committed a crime and the us wanted to investigate it in another country, then the doj reaches out to say they're opening an investigation and would like help. Head of state calling another head of state saying ""make an announcement about an investigation or I won't give the military aid I already promised"" is not the way. It is a violation of treaties we have. It is directly asking another country to interfere in an election. It is an abuse of power. Trump does not have the ability to withhold payments and aid that has been approved by the Senate."
