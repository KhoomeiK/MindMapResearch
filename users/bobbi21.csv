If I did label it that way without going into a whole rant on what level of abuse of power becomes impeachable, I guarantee I'd get another comment saying ""Well Obama wasn't impeached for his abuse of power so you're just being a partisan hack and saying Trump should be impeached for it but not Obama."" I was hoping by at least saying the name is slightly different, I'd make that distinction but you can't word things appropriately for everyone without going forever. And I get you wanting to try to preserve the phrase abuse of power to mean what it ideally should mean.

My personal opinion on it is that the strikes are largely out of Obama's control. Military tells him this is a high value target that can save thousands of lives and the risk is low so he believes them and authorizes it. I do trust he is making reasoned decisions based on the information he receives as well. I believe he's probably backed off on some strikes since he thought the casualty assessment might be too high or not accurate enough or whatever. But if the generals want a subject dead, I'm sure they'll find ways to phrase it to make sure the subject gets that strike done at some point."

And they were like ""Oh it'll be so easy to fool the AI. I'll just play normally for my shitty hands but when I have a good hand I'll play different. The AI will have no idea what's going on and will lose"" ""uh.. the AI recognizes patterns and will learn to pick up strategies like that"" ""what are you talking about? no it won't.
