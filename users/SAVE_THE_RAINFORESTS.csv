The CPU included as 1600 but AE stepping. AMD released a new batch of 1600 with AF stepping and it is better in every case and cheaper so you should get it instead of the one I included in the build, PCP doesn't have it in their list currently. https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Processor-Wraith-Stealth-YD1600BBAFBOX/dp/B07XTQZJ28/

My rationale for CPU/GPU is Debian using older kernels and getting Ryzen 3000 or 5700/2070 Super means you will be upgrading your kernel. Getting this old and tested combo means you will not experience any support issue.

Motherboard is a basic B450, I think it's the best in its range.

Memory is mid-level 2x8GB RAM. Memory is platform independent so in the future you can get X570 and a 3900X and this RAM will still work so no harm getting that extra head room.

512G + 2TB Storage, just basic stuff.

Case; basic good looking cheap case.

Power supply, 550W or better, 80+ bronze or better, fully modular.

You can cut prices here by getting smaller storage or getting a 570/580 or getting another brand 570/580/590. But I personally believe in Sapphire. I'm not sure if you can find cases for cheaper."

C_Programming,febbjn7,t1_feb1ci6,1578957163.0,"I don't know your level of knowledge so I will layout a plan for a 200 level CS student.

1. Read on IP, TCP, UDP. Try to understand what they are, what they do, how they work, etc.

1. Read on C socket programming. Beej's guide have been the de facto source for some time https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/pdf/bgnet_a4_c_1.pdf

2. Write a TCP server that accepts connections, receives messages and replies back with the message it receives. This is called an echo server. The reason you reply back with the message you receive is to remove reply generation logic from the picture and let you focus on the socket part of the problem.

3. Use netcat to connect to your server. Netcat is a TCP server and client in a single program. Send messages like ""a"" and see if you receive ""a"" back. Then write other inputs like inputs that are too short or too long, or enter inputs too quickly, etc. and try to break your server. Find out what's breaking and try to fix. Use a debugger (gdb if you are using gcc as your compiler or lldb if you are using clang for instance) to find where your error is originating. Properly using a debugger instead of finding errors with random printfs is a merit of C programmers.

4. Read up on HTTP. Find out what do you need to do to allow your TCP server to handle HTTP. Write a server that replies with the same content to all requests.

5. By now you know you need to debug your program until you can't find any errors. But to test a HTTP you can't use netcat. You will be using a HTTP client like curl or Postman.

6. Read HTTP RFCs and make sure your server is compliant to these RFCs to some extent.

7. Make sure your server can handle concurrent connections. Up until now, only you used your server but if you want to get a fully fledged server you need to be able to serve concurrently, serve multiple connections at the same time. You might think it would be easy but OH BOY you are wrong. With C, you can shoot yourself in the foot easily. When you write a concurrent program in C, you will be shooting yourself in the foot with multiple guns at the same time.

I think this would teach you a big portion of sockets, IO, structs, string operations, memory management and most importantly concurrency."

So you should write a basic HTTP server. This will teach you IO,  sockets, memory management, message parsing, concurrency and many more. At first write a basic TCP server. Then a basic HTTP server that serves a set page. Then serve pages according to the path."

C_Programming,fe6qsk9,t3_enq9zo,1578901028.0,"Two most important things having header and source files brings for me are information hiding and (maybe I'm using the wrong term here) polymorphism.

In header files, I only provide the declerations of functions you'll actually use in header file. The tens of functions I wrote just to keep everything readable does not concern you so their decleration is kept in the source file. I also keep the internal data structures in the source file as they are not of importance to you, as well. Working in a large team, my teammates does not need to know how this thing functions, they only want to know what they need to call to execute that functionality.

We also support many different hardware that are alternative of each other. There are many ways to support them. Having many seperate header and source files for each device and one header for the functionality is a popular one if (again I'm probably using a wrong term here) compile-time polymorphism is fine. For example, there are files network.h network_dev1.h network_dev1.c network_dev2.h network_dev2.c, you define USE_NETWORK_DEV1 while building to enable usage of dev1. 

But we need to decide what device we are using at load-time so we write one header file for the functionality and seperate source files for each device. Source file of each device implements the very high level API provided in the common header file. Then we generate many dynamic libraries and symlink to correct one when running the program. For example, there are network.h network_dev1.c network_dev2.c. These generate libnetwork_dev1.so and libnetwork_dev2.so. The program looks for libnetwork.so. We symlink libnetwork.so to libnetwork_dev1.so so we can use the program with dev1. This allows us to compile the project once and run with any combination of devices."
