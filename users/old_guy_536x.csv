coins,ff4vjab,t3_erlzpf,1579573457.0,"Another vote for a cast counterfeit.

My fake Seated Liberty story:  I once was on a business trip to Shanghai and visited a large second hand/junk store that had all sorts of stuff.

I  saw U.S. clad dime for about $0.07, then noticed a bunch of coins including some U.S. silver dollars. Picked one up; it was a Seated Liberty dollar from, I think, 1841. I was immediately suspicious that it was fake, of course, and figured that *maybe* it was actually silver and therefore worth melt or so. I decided to give it the ""ping"" test as silver coins make that nice distinct sound when tapped as OP noted.  I grabbed another silver dollar to tap it with; the second coin was an **1804** U.S. **silver dollar**!  I then laughed and dropped both coins and walked away.

For non-collectors: A real 1804 dollar is worth millions (15 are known to exist), and is one of the most famous numismatic rarities in existence."

personalfinance,feaqaez,t3_enzzoy,1578951309.0,"I own a small property in Florida, in a LCOL area. No mortgage,  perfect tenants (5 years +, never missed a payment).

My costs are mostly taxes, insurance, other costs (lawn and pest control), misc and repairs. 

I've averaged  about 9.5 to 10% return on capital.  I've done better in the stock market over the same time period. 

Additionally, note that I've had NO big repairs other than about $900 for a water heater.  At some point, something big is going to break or something will happen to the tenants (both in their early 80's).  

So....in my view, single-property real estate is a good way to diversify if you have other investments.  If not, you are putting all your eggs in one basket, as noted below by other commenters."
