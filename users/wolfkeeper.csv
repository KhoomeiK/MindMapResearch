Bullshit. It's literally the ONLY thing that matters.

>As more intermittent renewables are out on the grid and fossil fuel  sources reduced, grid integration costs go up almost exponentially.

No. Grid integration costs for the UK grid are not going up exponentially.

You sound like one of those nuclear power weenies. The problem you have is that the UK's grid has no hydroelectricity, and there's a large difference between baseload (about 25GW which is about the most that could in principle be realistically and economically be supplied by nuclear power) and peak load about 55GW (which, basically, cannot.) You'll notice that's rather a big difference.

The UK is right next door to France, and France uses nuclear power. How stupid you must think Britain is not to use it! Except no. The geography is very different. France has a significant amount of hydro it can use to balance its grid, and it's plugged into the rest of the continental grid. The UK is too far to have good connectivity and too flat for hydroelectricity. So nuclear's never taken off. France is best case everything for nuclear power. UK is about worse case everything.

You have not got the faintest idea about any of it."

And storage and intermittency are not even problems right now- the biggest problem is simple lack of renewable capacity; we need more of everything renewable as soon as possible.

In fact storage capacity on the UK grid is growing at 70% per annum. Year before last it had 700MW- I mean just batteries, there is also some pumped storage. Batteries will be well over 1GW now, and next year it will be over 2 GW. That might not sound like much, but (for example) the grid was unable to import miuch green electricity from France overnight because it wouldn't be able to handle it if there was an outage on the 2GW connector. That's not even a renewables issue, it's a reliability one.

But as I stated, we PRIMARILY need more generation, and intermittency is no big problem right now either."
Futurology,ff50fff,t1_ff4zfg4,1579576898.0,"Look, you're making no sense. Scotland is on the same National Grid as the rest of Great Britain, and there's not enough wind power for it to ever max out the grid right now.

But what Scotland can do is produce NET renewable power greater than it's entire yearly demand. Doing that means that Scotland has no yearly NET CO2 emissions for its electricity supply, and to the extent it is not instantaneously producing enough renewable energy, it will be overproducing and shutting down fossil plants in England some other time to make up for it."
Futurology,ff4zyis,t1_ff419m7,1579576554.0,"They don't 'grounded out' anything. That would be dangerous and ridiculous.

In some situations, such as when powerlines get maxed out, wind turbines, and other sources of power, including gas turbines and coal plants, get 'constraint payments' to produce less power. Those payments are in any given year, relatively small amounts of the total costs and recently halved after new power lines were installed connecting Scotland to England. And that energy was never produced so doesn't get counted as part of the supply.

No, ALL of the power produced gets used locally, gets stored, or gets transmitted elsewhere, plus a small percentage is lost in transit."
Futurology,ff4xuxz,t1_ff4jplf,1579575062.0,"The point is that when the wind blows, the non renewables stop generating in the rest of Great Britain, which is on the same grid, so they really do reduce CO2 production.

That's one of the reason natural gas is being so widely deployed- if the wind drops they more or less just turn up the gas; so wind+solar+gas gives you cheap, low carbon, reliable electricity. And the natural gas plants are cheap to build, have energetic efficiencies over 60%, are flexible and half the CO2 pollution of coal.

Hotplates certainly shift quite a bit of power, and could potentially use a lot of energy, but usually the energy used is not that great. Most hotplates are on some kind of thermostat, and so hotplates very often self regulate down to \~0-200W or so (depending on the thermal losses which are mainly due to convection from what's sitting on top.

I mean, sure if you have a hotplate and you're continuously strongly boiling something, yes, that's going to hurt your powerbill a LOT, but most people bring things to a boil and then turn it right down so it's barely simmering. And if you have a hotplate, and it's keeping coffee warm, that's like \~50W or so. Cookery is far from the biggest item on most people's electrical bill. And you would think that bringing something to a boil uses a lot of energy, but that's not actually so, it's boiling water that takes large amounts of energy- the latent heat of vaporisation is super large.

The real heavy hitting energy use is air conditioning and space heaters which frequently use great gobs of energy and power, and electric cars. It's not that difficult to run a 3kW space heater flat out for quarter of an hour to warm a room up, but to boil a 3kW kettle for more than 5 minutes is rare; the water would have boiled.

Also renewable power tends to be a bit feast or famine. Sometimes you just have way too much power. If we could use spare power to grow food that would be very helpful. It's theoretically possible that that could be carbon negative, spare carbohydrates or oils could be buried underground, or used as fuel for carbon neutral shipping."
Futurology,fedk0da,t1_fed84pl,1579013460.0,"Not exactly. It's a naturally occurring mineral which is everywhere. People grew stuff long before they knew about it. But growth is faster when you boost it- it's growth rate limiting. You can extract it from human and animal waste, bones etc. And there are other deposits of it around that aren't being used currently. For example in East Anglia in the UK."
Futurology,fed4n8m,t1_fed2uvv,1578998639.0,"Wrong. Surprisingly, the overall process is far MORE efficient than photosynthesis!

Plant photosynthesis is only about 1-3% efficient- and most of that energy is used for useless things that can't be used like stalks etc. Meanwhile, a solar panel is over 20%, and there's far less waste. Their electrolysis is quite efficient, and the microbes are able to turn the hydrogen that's produced into energy very efficiently. Also, their process can use electricity from wind power, any type of electricity, but plants can't. They pump in carbon dioxide from air so it's carbon neutral.

So it's the agriculture that can't compete. And yes, their process scales fine to millions of tonnes per year.

The fertilizers are essential nutrients for the plants, that's why they're used. And yes, they do turn into food. Notably, the nitrogen compounds turn into proteins as do the phosphorus ones."

It's an essential mineral for all life, and can tend to be a limiting nutrient. Each DNA and RNA nucleotide has a phosphate group on it, and you kinda do need DNA/RNA to live. ;)

There's vast, cheap, easily accessed deposits in Morocco, but they will run out eventually. Modern farming uses bucketloads of it:

Fritz Haber won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, but *nobody* would have given him the Nobel Peace Prize."
Futurology,fecdth9,t1_fecabo1,1578971545.0,"It's not really a question of if, there's plenty of phosphorus around, but a question of cost of making those forms usable."
