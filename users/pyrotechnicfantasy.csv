Yes, sometimes enemies are too powerful to kill in one go (Like Captains and Polemarchs) so you have to be creative, e.g. lure them into lighting the signal fire, which then explodes. Or assassinate then for big damage, blind them, hide, them assassinate again.

Yes, they are despicable. Yes, they are evil for using that salute. But we do not live in a society where it is okay for anyone to hand out vigilante justice based on a photo. 

What happens if they beat up someone who looks like one of the photographed people? What if one of them is a twin? Perhaps one of the people in this photo was incredibly against doing the salute, and did so because of peer pressure - do they deserve to be attacked? What if someone goes and kills one of them and then we have a murder to deal with?

What happens when the next photo gets released, but it's photoshopped, and innocent people get attacked in the street for someone they never did? 

I'm not defending these people, they're evil. But we have a legal system to punish them correctly. It's not the general public's place to do so and that is a very slippery slope to slide down."
