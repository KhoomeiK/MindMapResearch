I mean, you convince a bunch of people that you're a blithering idiot... and somehow the jokes on them?"

facepalm,ffc47y0,t1_ffc2l48,1579791132.0,"True, but I don't think it's a lack of empathy.  Maybe more of an ineptitude for expressing it.  Like it's not that I don't care about your pain, or that I can't recognize and identify with it, but I'm just not good at helping you through it.

If I see someone in pain, my first thought it to try to relieve the pain.  The notion that the person might actually want to continue experiencing it is still a little alien to me.  

Sometimes you have to work through the pain.  Like grieving the loss of a loved one.  Sometimes all you need to do is stop standing on your own hands.  It took me nearly 30 years to realise that sometimes just talking about the pain is enough."
todayilearned,ffc08ng,t1_ffberos,1579788190.0,"I was thinking the same thing.  I mean, it seems cruel to just rip it out of the skin."
insanepeoplefacebook,fenmqqt,t1_fen2ccn,1579287996.0,"For the people who push for it, that's the point.

It's not really about preventing voter fraud, it's about discouraging as many people from voting as possible.  The more forms or fees you can put between people and the polls, the fewer will go to the polls.

And historically, Republicans tend to win when fewer people vote."

Whatcouldgowrong,fehwutn,t1_fehw163,1579125456.0,"I have a half-pit.  A few weeks ago we tried bringing in another dog.  Long story short she attacked the newcomer and my hand got in the way, so I got bit.  

We found the new pup another home, but my gf's family is still freaking out over it, thinking we're going to get attacked one day.  I guarantee they wouldn't worry as much if she weren't part pit.

Some people just don't take the time to understand how dogs work."

The only law I could find regarding the procedures of handling classified information is CIPA, but that specifically applies to the DOJ and a defendant's rights a fair trial."
