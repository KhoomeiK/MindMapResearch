PublicFreakout,fe6qkay,t1_fe687tf,1578900736.0,"I call these the mental shackles...and it's ironic for black people to have a one word command that will make them act exactly as expected, what I don't understand is why they still use the word nigger between blacks ? Do you see gay people calling themselves faggot ? Or middle eastern sand nigger or goat fuckers ? Japanese with whatever their slang is...I have been called by these before and while as a kid it annoyed me with time I learned to just not answer the provocation. But if there is one thing I'm sure is that if black people really hated the word...they wouldn't be using it."
RetroArch,fe6olmo,t3_enbpn6,1578898314.0,"People downvote anyone who criticize the UI ... If this isn't one of the reasons the UI doesn't get better idk what is...

  


Don't get me wrong, I use retroarch, I love the shaders, retroachivememts, same shortcuts for all my platforms... I can forgive the fact that some platforms you are just better at using the emulator iteelf...but the UI good God...

  


So I use neoburn to play neogeo cd... Usually I load neoburn... Load a neogeo cd ans start it. I know sub menu for loading the cd of different consoles looks like a good idea ... But omg why does it goes back to the xmb and I have to go to the sub menu again and go all the way to the console I just loaded to start it...

  


because of this I'm going back to 1.8.2 and I just won't update because if it's not broken don't fix it.

  


I'm thankful for the free software and everything, but sometimes it feels like no one tried to load a CD and start it before making the update because it's just redundant menu navigation that is not only senseless but obnoxious..."
