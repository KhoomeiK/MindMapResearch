depression,fcmoy9p,t1_fcmoser,1577785006.0,Hi Greg. Thanks for the direct and honest answer.  I checked your post history (dont we all?) And i wonder why you're not taking any medication?

I have a shih tzu and I like how they just sit around you in silence, you give them a pat and you know she really likes it. I'd like to hear more stories about your dog too. And I hope you find another to take care of."
