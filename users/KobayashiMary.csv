Catswhoyell,fdorpt1,t1_fdnygg7,1578611400.0,"Just a heads up,  the super sweet and affectionate little girl cat I inherited (from a shitty 3rd roommate who abandoned her when she moved out)  went absolutely bat-shit insane and attacked my roommate and I one day because she was in heat and she saw a stray out the window on her ‚Äúterf.‚Äù I happened to walk into my house at just the wrong moment. She tried to dart out the door (unheard of, she was 100% indoor cat her whole life) and when l tried to stop her she bit my bicep. Hit a major vein. Then my roommate came out and she got bit, through her jeans, in the calf.

Both of us had to go to the ER because we got infections. Turns a legit cat bite almost always get infected because their teeth are so sharp and their mouths are little cesspools. 

After I got her spayed it never happened again. 10/10 would recommend spaying, especially with kids. Better safe than sorry!"

I learned a lot from that job, mainly how forgettable we all are and to only give up my day off because I wanted the hours and not because they were desperate. Turns out most pleading managers are full of shit and never remember their promises tomorrow."

Wellthatsucks,fd07k3g,t1_fd04xik,1578114810.0,"My family dog died 3 months ago. He was a cocker spaniel named was Buddy and his first christmas he slept shivering on on my hip and peed on me in the night. We talked about him christmas dinner and did impressions of his loud noises when my Dad would dare to leave him alone to go to the garage for a couple minutes. 

Life, as George Carlin so eloquently put it, is a series of dogs.  Buddy was a good dog, he wasn‚Äôt our first and he wont be our last. I am not sorry when something reminds me of him nor those who came before him because I think dogs deserve to be remembered.

And let‚Äôs be real, there are a stunning array of subreddits that fit the bill for cheering up the masses that are far more suitable that this one.  Anyone as delicate as all that should probably stop grousing in a subreddit that isn‚Äôt literally gallery of the displeasures ingrained in the human experience and seek out cheerier pastures. Sure the posts can be funny, but it‚Äôs not exactly what I‚Äôd call a safe bet."

Wellthatsucks,fczz0g7,t1_fczt8fs,1578111074.0,"I‚Äôve been on reddit for 8 years. I know my current username doesn‚Äôt reflect that but I was forced to abandoned my previous username. 

I believe it is better to measure the weight of another‚Äôs pain before reacting to my own, especially when it is a degree less than. Hearing that a dog I‚Äôve never met has died is no good reason to snipe at the person who is actually in mourning, which is what too many people in this thread are doing. 

I suppose my metric for what qualifies as a sob story is a little more stringent. I will say this, karma is worth nothing and it cost nothing to be kind."
Wellthatsucks,fczraxo,t1_fczkbwn,1578107285.0,"This is not a post that ‚Äúshows‚Äù animal suffering. This is a post expressing that it sucks that this persons best friend surprisingly died. The post doesn‚Äôt describe why or how, it just states that they woke up and their dog was gone and they thought ‚ÄúWell, this sucks.‚Äù

There is an argument to be made that the posts are usually more lighthearted, sure, but that really depends on your individual perspective. The fact remains that the mods didn‚Äôt remove it so the obvious conclusion is that this is not a rule breaking post.

Regardless of your opinion about the relevancy of the posts to this subreddit I cant imagine what would prompt anyone to support the way so many people have hammered OP after what is clearly a substantial loss. I read the post and thought, ‚ÄúShit, that does suck.‚Äù and I upvoted. 

This comment section is a travesty that honestly warrants its own post r/WellThatSucks post."
