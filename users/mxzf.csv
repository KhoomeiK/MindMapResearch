sw5e,ff7akli,t3_es174i,1579644712.0,"Honestly, this sounds like a bad premise for a oneshot.  

First off, you're trying to set up an encounter that basically guarantees a TPK without completely guaranteeing a TPK for narrative reasons.  Either make it a full intentional TPK (with the buy-in of the players, that's important) and lean into it or make it a reasonably fair fight.

Second, 1v6 is always going to be super weird from a balance standpoint.  Because any enemy strong enough to survive a round of attacks from all the characters is also going to be strong enough to one-shot one or two of those padawans every round and take out the masters quick too.  You want something more like a CR 3-4 with a couple CR 1 enemies supporting it.  

Third, this is a universe lore thing, so DMs can break it, but Jedi don't tend to have ""descendants"", so that part doesn't make a ton of sense thematically.

Fourth, again a lore thing rather than a mechanical thing, Windu and Yoda knowing of a Sith (or even suspecting it) and that Sith not being Sidious, Plagueis, or Maul doesn't fit with the lore either.  Maul could potentially be an option, but it'd only make sense if it was an independent discovery and the Jedi all die instead of Windu/Yoda knowing about it.

That said, 3 and 4 could be addressed by simply setting it in the 1000-4000 BBY time period, where those things are more believable.

Weird paragraph to make the last one show (Reddit's doing something odd with formatting).

However, to get answer your original question, I'd probably make the fight something like an Inquisitor Knight plus a Tuk'ata (or two, depending on exactly how impossible you want the fight to be).  But be prepared for those lvl 1 characters to go down in a hit or two; even if they take the Tuk'ata(s) and the masters take the Knight, it'll still be rough."

2. Maker Select Plus

3. Cura for the slicer.  For modeling, I use a combination of FreeCAD and Blender with a bit of Meshmixer thrown in.

4. The question is kinda antithetical to 3D printing in general.  Part of the whole point of 3D printing is that you aren't locked into producing a limited set of things all the time, you can print new stuff as-needed.  There are a few times when I'll pop off a second or third copy of the same thing, but most of the time it's a new model every time.

5. $0.10-$1.00.  It varies from print to print, but a large portion of prints are in that <$1 range. 

6. Frequently but not exclusively.  I make functional prints when I see a need for them, which varies wildly from month to month.  

6. No huge frustrations.  There are some considerations to keep in mind when you're designing/printing/etc, but most frustrations come from an insufficient understanding rather than mechanical issues.

8. 3D printing is more complicated than just clicking a button and waiting, and not everyone wants to go through more effort.  It also benefits from a slightly more technical mindset than many people have.  

9. Potentially, but the technology isn't at the point where it's plug-and-play enough for the mass market quite yet.  Not everyone wants to put in the effort to learn how to level a bed or make a functional model.  I don't know that it'll ever happen, but definitely not in the near future.  

10. I don't see a tenth question.  Someone miscounted.

In all honesty, however, I don't see how these questions would provide much insight into why it hasn't seen as much mass consumption as some other technologies.  The first seven questions don't really touch on it and the last two just ask for personal speculation."

books,felp01g,t1_felnx02,1579227433.0,"It's not that it wouldn't fit in with the movie from a thematic/plot standpoint, it's that it's not what moviegoers expect from a pacing standpoint.  

The destruction of the ring is the climax of the journey from the standpoint of most viewers.  People generally expect the movie to end ~5-10 min after the climax, not for a subset of the heroes to have another adventure on the way home."
books,feleb1p,t1_feldmci,1579220157.0,I don't disagree.  But at that point it's a question of funding to pay for all the sets/shooting/cast/etc to film an extra 30-60 min of content like that.
books,feldihu,t1_felalng,1579219628.0,"That's probably because they *mostly* followed the content of the book (though with some pointless additions at times).  However, The Hobbit has basically no content covering the Battle of Five Armies, since it's told from Bilbo's perspective and he was out cold for most of the battle.  

There wasn't much material to work with, so they made up a bunch of stuff and it didn't work well at all."
books,feld7mt,t1_felbt6q,1579219424.0,"It's one of those things that would have been enjoyable to see, but wouldn't really fit with the stories.  

Even as-is the ending of the movie feels like it drags on for a while after the climax of the movie (the destruction of the ring) compared to most movies.  Adding in another half hour or so of hobbits leading an uprising in the Shire would have been weird for most watchers.  Even more so when you factor in taking enough time to show everyone traveling and meeting Sarumon and such, it probably would have been more like an hour of extra content.  

That's the kind of thing that might be nice as a bonus feature or whatever for people who are interested, but it wouldn't really fit in a theatrical cut with the rest of the movie."
books,felcp98,t1_fekymor,1579219084.0,"Sure, but the counter-argument is that compromises have to be made to turn a 1-1.5k page book series into movies that can keep the interest of a general audience.  

It likely could have done more character/thematic development, but I don't know how much more could have been done without slowing the movie down too much for general audiences to enjoy.  

When it comes to movie adaptations of books, I can't think of one that did it better than LotR.  It's not word-for-word, but it captured the spirit of the story without being too long/slow/boring."
Libertarian,fel84bv,t1_fekwcyt,1579216115.0,I'm pretty sure the answer to that is a better review process when there is a shooting.  And it should be some impartial reviewer and prosecutor instead of someone with connections to the people involved; either someone at the state or federal level or someone from another state.

IIRC, they were there to take the various regional currencies from people coming to the temple and change the money to the local currency that the religious leaders wanted at painful exchange rates or to sell ""better"" sacrifices at absurd prices.  They weren't providing some helpful spiritual service, they were gouging people who just wanted to do the right thing spiritually."

It's fine to map out the small area around the nest for any pre-grab encounters you want to do, but there's no need to map out a giant path back to the ship when a skill challenge would do just fine."

Skill challenges are basically where players make a series of skill checks instead of RPing out every step along a chase or something similar.  [Matt Colville has a pretty good video on them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvOeqDpkBm8)."
AdviceAnimals,feijj8r,t1_fegd74d,1579139990.0,Turn the subtitles on.  It helps a lot with catching the names that they drop randomly that happen to be referring to characters you see in other parts of the show that are in other timelines.

There's a ***lot*** that isn't obvious.  I spent the second and third episode wondering why a show that seems to be leading into the witcher and this princess traveling together is taking forever to bring them together.  He was just off wandering around for weeks/months killing monsters while she's stumbling around in the woods.

Turns out that you have to either pay *tons* of attention to exactly what people are saying or find a timeline online to realize that the stuff it's showing for him is decades off from what it's showing for her."

3Dprinting,fehpo1d,t3_ep7ymp,1579121376.0,"How cheap are you looking for?  A Creality Ender 3 is <$200 and will serve just fine for a starter printer.

In theory, you might be able to put together a frankenstein machine for a bit cheaper, but it's hard to get the structural/electronic parts for much cheaper, even if you can print all the printable parts.  Add in the time/effort of trying to troubleshoot without even knowing what you're hoping to see and it's just more worthwhile to get an entry-level printer instead.  

Unless you have a large portion of the motors and control circuits already laying around, and enough experience to know what you're doing, you're better off just getting an entry-level printer like the Ender 3."
