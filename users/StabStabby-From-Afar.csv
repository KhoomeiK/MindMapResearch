IMVU and Avkin life are designed for phones, Secondlife is not.

There is a third party app called Lumya, but the reality is that it's for players who already play on PC who want to keep in text-contact with people who they've already met in the game. This app also is not available in the Google Play store anymore.

Secondlife is just too big, and too old of a game to run properly on any phone today.

secondlife,ff4o1h2,t3_erm5en,1579568288.0,"A few people mentioned Kemono for furry mods, but I just want to say that a lot of furries are attempting to switch over to Regalia, and there's not a lot of mods available on the marketplace for that.

That'd be filling a need, definitely, if you made skins for the Regalia body.

You'd need the PSD's for it, and I think it works with appliers \[not entirely sure though\]. So you'd need to know how to use those.

Kemono is great, but it -does- already have a lot of options on the marketplace. People like the Regalia body because it fits clothes for other bodies, such as Maitreya, Slink and stuff like that.

I also want to add that I wanted to use the Regalia body for a human mod, but couldn't find a single fully-human skin mod on the marketplace. I think I'm probably not the only person looking for human mods with this body either, so that may be something to look into. There's a few legs for the Regalia body I'd love to use with a human.

As for human bodies, such as Maitreya and just omega in general, it'd be nice if more people made M4 Anime/Chibi and M4 Venus mods for the omega appliers. I feel like there's not enough skins out for this combo, but the heads have an adapter for the neck of the Maitreya+ bodies, so it makes no sense not to have more options available. That's another need that I feel needs to be filled.

As for tips on how to do it, Youtube has a shitload of tutorials for Secondlife texturing. I make some textures in my spare time, for different mods that I've made. I've just used Youtube when figuring out how to do things.

I'm sure you already understand how to make seamless textures, something I don't even know how to do yet... but if you don't, I'd definitely look into it. Apparently there's plugins for Photoshop? Not entirely sure how that even works.

Lastly, human skins, with Catwa or LeLutka heads, are very popular, but keep in mind there's a metric shit ton of them on the marketplace already."

I did want to say, that I didn't think that I'd get trash talked in an MMORPG, that's typically not an issue from what I've experienced. [WoW, etc.] My point was, the reason that I was getting trash talked was the way the game was created in the first place. It wasn't a very user friendly experience. 

But that aside, I get where you're coming from. I understand that not every game is made for 'every gamer'. I just personally don't agree with loot loss mechanics at their core. Even though I understand it can force players to think differently about the game, I believe there's a better way to do that without making your inventory trivial."

newworldgame,feqvoqw,t1_feqpt4m,1579346613.0,"I play games to have fun, not to feel genuinely discouraged when I lose. 

I feel that loot loss mechanics are extremely discouraging. It makes me not value what's in my inventory, because it can be lost at any moment. 

People are different, but you shouldn't force loot loss on gamers just because a few hardcore gamers enjoy the game like that. A lot of people, like myself, want to play a game once in a while and feel like they're making progress. I'm far from a casual gamer, but I won't lie and say that sitting at my computer 12 hours a day playing the same game is fun to me anymore. I'm not 20 anymore, and I mostly like to relax. I don't want to feel genuinely stressed out in a game because I may lose my loot the next time I get ganked. 

I'm not for babysitting in games, but I feel like a happy medium needs to be found. I'd be lying if I said that I knew exactly what that medium is, but there has to be an in between. I understand that people want to feel like the game has more 'real' impacts, but let's be honest. Loot loss mechanics are a dated mechanic to have. We need new ideas, creative ideas. 

For example. I used to play League of Legends. I played it for five years, and would play between 1-3 matches a day. More casual than the average player I'm assuming, but not exactly a casual. 1-3 matches, at 45 minutes to an hour each, was approximately 2.5 hours of League a day. 

At the end of my five years, I started to realize some things. The game was no longer fun for me. Even though I hadn't played all that much, and definitely not more than I was comfortable playing, the game had gotten more annoying for me than fun. When I died, late game, I had to sit at my base, dead, and watch the enemy team destroy our towers. My team would bitch and fucking moan if I made one mistake, because not only could they probably SEE the mistake I did, but it severely effected them. The enemy team was awarded gold, which allowed them to buy items [which you can't opt out of] which made them stronger. Some builds were stupid effective, and mixing that with masteries, a certain few champions rose to the top with a certain few builds. I spent a lot of my time looking up appropriate builds, and then forming my own later on when more choice was given. But there's even more issues than that, because the items would give things like armor and the ability to one shot. Add in CC to all that, and the game was a fucking mess. One crowd control on you and the whole enemy team would dogpile, kill you, and now you're dead for upwards of 60 seconds. Your team is down a member, the enemy team got stronger, and you're out for a long time.

I could go on, but I'll stop here because at this point I'm just rattling off reasons I dislike League.

Now, I ended up moving on to Overwatch. Dead game, blah blah blah. But Overwatch had a few things that I really enjoyed.

It took out the need for items. Nobody gets items, nobody gets stronger unless the ability is in their kit or another hero's kit on their team. Health stays the same, armor stays the same... and save for patches, everything runs as expected.

CC is relatively rare. Although this will most likely change with added heroes. I think there needs to be a limit on how many CC oriented players you can have on your team one day, because overuse of crowd control really ruins games. The enemy team just needs to pick 3 CCers and coordinate like that, and the game becomes frustrating. This was made clear by the addition of Sigma, a shielding hero who, combined with Orisa, another shielding hero, becomes a very frustrating duo. Snipers were essentially nerfed when that happened. 

Overwatch also made it so... anybody can shine. Even a healer can carry a game, everybody makes a significant impact. 

I don't need to go back to base to buy items, or save up money, or worry about the enemy's item armor or benefits. I can focus on the game play. Killing the enemy team, and working together with my team to get good positioning. 

Allowing players to focus on the game play is extremely beneficial. 

Lastly, and the reason I brought all of this up in the first place, is that Overwatch has extremely short death timers and no reward for the enemy team other than a number's advantage. I sit there and watch how the enemy killed me for five seconds, and then I'm back in the match, running back to my team mates. No longer do I have to sit there and be berated by my team for fucking up. I die, nobody really cares because they may or may not have even noticed, and I run back and do my best not to screw up again. I don't have to be tortured sitting there for 45-60 seconds, watching the enemy destroy everything I've worked so hard for... for the last 45 minutes.

Which brings me to my last point, which is game match time and ability to leave the match. In League, if I left a match, I would be penalized. It would not be autofilled, the enemy team would win and I would face a possible ban for a few weeks from even playing the game. I had to set aside at least an hour's worth of time, but closer to an hour and a half, taking into consideration queue times, going over in time, friends getting ready in time. It was a big decision to play a match of League, and as somebody who has a family and needs to frequently leave my computer, that really doesn't work for me.

Overwatch matches are short, 20 minutes tops normally. I'm able to jump in and out when I need to, the only loss being a ding towards my endorsement level... but because I'm so consistently good with not leaving matches, and being positive towards the teams, it's no big deal when I need to leave once in a while. I also need to leave less because the matches are so short. I can tell my son I'll be five more minutes, then I can do something with him... and if it's an 'emergency' I can get up and leave without the possibility of being punished for something out of my hands. 

Taking out the repercussions of dying severely heightened my game enjoyment. 

I won't even mention the Riot store, the free to play model, and how much money I wasted on that fucking game. 

Making your game player friendly is beneficial, to not only the game creators, but... of course, the player."

I had a song that I was desperately searching for, for ten years, before I finally found it. It was weird because I was listening to a music service I never really listen to, and it was on a radio that I never listened to, and it just happened to play a Johnny Cash cover of the song I was trying to find.

I want to also add, that I would start by searching OSU Hatsune Miku songs, the ones they use on OSU tend to be the nightcore versions, and because OSU was pretty popular between 2011-2016, it's possible somebody recorded an OSU play with a Hatsune Miku song that you're looking for.

I feel like starting there would be your best bet. 

Lastly, the way your brain remembers things can be really weird. So don't discount it being a Hatsune Miku song unless you've scoured the internet and still can't find it.

No. While I appreciate that you're promoting... supposedly your own podcast, this is not news. This is not from a legitimate news source, and it is flat out not news. A podcast does not qualify as news. This subreddit is dedicated to actual news stories, which is why it's called News of the Stupid.

Regardless of whether or not I've known anything in this podcast previously, it is still not 'news'. It's a podcast.

Good luck promoting your podcast. Also, a side note, a lot of subreddits have a 10-1 rule for self promotion. To avoid getting yourself banned from certain subreddits and thus being unable to participate in them, you should do 10 regular, non promotional posts or comments, and 1 promotional comment or post. Reddit for a long time really hated self promotion, and it's still seen as a bit of a shitty thing to do... to use Reddit purely for your own gain. Although big companies do it, a LOT, they have entire teams dedicated to getting that shit out there without offending the Redditors. You're just, again presumably, one person, and you need to follow proper Reddiquette to avoid having issues. Posting your podcast to multiple subreddits and hoping for the best won't work. If it fits into a conversation, and you're already conversing, then go ahead and drop it in. But using Reddit for personal gain is often frowned upon. You will not receive that many upvotes, ever, and your stuff won't be seen by the right people. 

I'd say keep plugging away, and if your content is good, people will notice it. Do proper SEO as well. Get a website going. There's lots of things you can do to promote your podcast. Posting to ten subreddits a day is not going to work."

I love to anthropomorphize my animals, but I can also understand that constantly getting into cat-fights would stress my animals out.

They get enough affection from us imo."
thisismylifenow,fefv0gr,t1_feef6ub,1579066080.0,"I don't know why you're being downvoted so much, it's not an obscene thought.

My cats all came from the same house, not litter mates though and they all pretty much hated each other. There was one cat who was super chill, but the rest would fight amongst one another.

They all grew up together. Basically all were either juveniles or kittens when we got them, and three of them all hated each other... a lot.

The one cat who's left now seems really relaxed now that she's alone. Her personality definitely came out after my other cat passed away, who would regularly beat the still-living cat up.

I think it really did stress them out to live together."

I mean if we're saying one thing is the same as the other, why not?

Think I'm being overly harsh all you like. It's just how I feel. I don't agree with it."

You obviously don't.

Am I alone in that? Seriously? 

Do I really have to answer that? No. I have not hurt my son's feelings by laughing at him in a situation where he can't laugh at it himself as well. Laughing at people is rude, laughing with them is kind and fun.

Why does this even need to be said? Isn't that just basic 'how not to be a bully 101' stuff that everyone is taught?"
WatchPeopleDieInside,fe08kav,t1_fdzpb30,1578806009.0,"No she's not. If she was trying hard not to laugh she'd not be laughing. I've never once laughed at a drawing my son made, and I never would.

That's my opinion and I'm not changing it. Think whatever you like, I give not a single fuck. I don't agree with parents laughing in their kid's face at something they've made."
