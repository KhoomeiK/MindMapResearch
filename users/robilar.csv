I am referring to reasons people take action, and by extension the psychological structures and tools people can use to reinforce behaviors they would like to develop and habitualize. What definition of the term are you using?"

Diamonds are overrated.

Seeds may germinate in darkness, but almost all plants need light to thrive.

Just saying, these metaphors could use some work. ;)

Kidding aside, I don't think it's a great message to teach people that it is unequivocally worthwhile to endure hardship. An abusive partner is pressure. A shitty job is pressure. Wearing a corset is pressure.

Sometimes the pressure leads to powerful, positive transformation. And sometimes it just grinds you down.

The first step is determining if the transformation is taking you someplace you want to go, leading you to being someone you want to be. If not, the healthier choice may be to take off the corset and just wear a good supportive sports bra. Or no bra. Or a different corset. Whatever floats your boat."

GetMotivated,felrp3n,t1_fekzrg8,1579229284.0,"You make some good points about valuing the journey over the destination, but the OP quote doesn't seem to be making that argument.  Please read it again - it is literally saying that you shouldn't question yourself, your hard work, and your decisions. I realize some people get stuck in analysis paralysis, but the inverse (trudging mindlessly forward) is not benign. We should absolutely question ourselves and our decisions, reasonably and purposefully, so we can make better decisions going forward and learn from our mistakes.

I empathize with people wrestling with anxiety and self-esteem issues, and I do think we can do well to take a step back sometimes and not overanalyze, but I would prefer a quote that encourages people to learn to manage their cognitive resources in a healthy way. Self-criticism isn't unequivocally toxic; it's a fundamental component of learning."

JordanPeterson,fee0qf0,t1_fedwzue,1579023967.0,"Thank you for sharing your experiences, and I cannot say I am certain you are incorrect in your assessments or conclusions.

Edit: also thank you for pointing out that happiness is not contingent on being in a romantic relationship. I meant to imply that some relationships are more caustic than beneficial (maybe even many, or most) but you are right to challenge me on the unintentional exclusion of people outside traditional romantic partnerships.

I don't really have any data points that I would consider to be based on a large enough sample size or with adequate controls for other variables to personally draw any conclusive determinations. My only caveat here is that JP is stating a conclusion based on one principle factor, and I don't think that is a rational or logical judgement to make. Omitting the obvious factor of acrimonious relationships makes his point seem more emotional than rational.

It's worth noting that someone elsewhere in this thread has suggested that JP himself was critical of his conduct in this video, citing the interviewer directly insulting him earlier in the conversation leading him to be more combative than he would have liked."

JordanPeterson,fedrzj4,t1_fed17fl,1579018628.0,"I think your binary may not represent all relationships. Take for example a marriage that is passionately destructive - the third option there is staying in the marriage and being verbally and emotionally abusive/abused. Like letting it stagnate, this option is not ideal, but plenty of people do it anyway.

My point is just that marriages that end in divorce are often acrimonious relationships, so there are costs (and harm) associated with maintaining the status quo. That's why I used surgery as a metaphor - there is a cost to ignoring my worsening heartburn (stagnation), and there is a cost to continuing to eat fried foods (active acrimony), and there are costs associated with bypass surgery (divorce). There are even costs associated with learning to eat better and live a healthier life (repairing the marriage). I think JP should include more variables in his calculation."
JordanPeterson,fedrd79,t1_fedb7ck,1579018242.0,"We are all on a continuum of skill and knowledge.

JordanPeterson,fedr7zk,t1_fedf5f7,1579018153.0,"I think it depends on the relationship, and the people.
A lot of people wither in relationships where they feel trapped, and behave poorly or lash out (often at their kids as well). Conversely, while co-parenting and divorce add considerable challenges, both individuals may have a better chance to find a partner or partners that feed them emotionally, making them better people and consequently better parents. I realize there are a lot of uncertainties, but I know a few people in caustic relationships and the aggregate harm to their children is apparent in the attitudes and miscues of their offspring. I also know a handful of parents that are separated, with various degrees of acrimony, and it's hard to say of those kids are better off. Some are definitely struggling, but some are obviously also palpably more content.

I think another person mentioned this earlier, but I think there is something to the idea that a marriage commitment creates a pressure to stay together that can sometimes weather small storms to the benefit of both partners; maybe I'm depressed about work, and I start taking it out on my partner, but after I resolve my work issue we reconcile and I make amends - absent of marriage maybe I (or they) would have been more inclined to cut bait. Conversely, though, I do think that people often chaff when they feel they are trapped, and sometimes resent their partners for it and that can seed a relationship with contempt which can poison future interactions.

Which is all just to say that I don't think it is a certain thing, one or another, which is less acrimonious.  My critique of JP's argument is that he appears to be assessing the harm of divorce, and judging it a net loss, without mentioning (or seemingly accounting for) a significant variable (harm of marriages that might end in divorce)."
JordanPeterson,fecf7kn,t3_eo9nhi,1578972481.0,"This is not one of JP's strongest arguments.
Let's agree that divorces are generally (though not always) acrimonious. To prove his point JP needs to demonstrate they are *more* harmful than acrimonious marriages, not just that they are acrimonious, and he makes no effort to do so.

Surgery is painful, but often life saving.

To be fair, I am not making the argument that divorces are always benign, but a rational person trying to make a cogent argument doesn't ignore obviously critical and relevant variables.

The patriarchy nonsense that follows is far less interesting. Maybe the interviewer is full of shit, but we can't know from the interview because JP didn't wait for her to make her statement.

Not JP's best performance imo. I've heard him do better."

Then they got rid of late fees, but secretly replaced them with ""restocking fees"". Blockbuster was shit.

But they did have a lot of copies.

As to digital content, it should be cheaper because the overhead is much lower - no physical store so no rent, furnishings, staff, etc plus no physical media needs to be manufactured. Web interfaces (servers etc) are not free, of course, but they cost a fraction of former costs of doing business. The reason a digital download is still $4 is because that's what the stakeholders have determined the market will bear to maximize profits.

Just my take on it, mind you."

And when I was an asshole, well, people were assholes back.

As to biases in classrooms, if we're talking about social sciences then we are largely talking about cultural traits and concepts which are all entirely subjective. Data can show us how many men go into nursing, as opposed to women (or non-binary individuals) but the analysis of why, how it could change, and wether or not it is worth changing (or even ethical to work against established systems) is all about our opinions filtered through a cultural lens.

To clarify, I'm not trying to say it isn't important to consider the biases of professors... I'm trying to say unlike say calculus or biology the social sciences have opinion baked in, and consequently a big part of the lesson is for students to challenge those concepts critically and then determine if they make sense. If we don't think Peterson (or Sheperd) should be criticised or silenced for voicing unpopular opinions or sharing controversial ideas in a classroom, under the theory that students need to be exposed to a variety of ideas, we probably shouldn't try to silence our leftwing counterparts.

TLDR; we shouldn't avoid courses with passionate professors, even if they are biased. We should take the class, and speak up."
