askscience,ff3iknr,t1_ff3icmh,1579541803.0,"I am very happy to have opened even one more mind to hydrokinetics. There are many places around the world where the population is not served by a power grid but lives on the edge of a river. These people would be very well served by hydrokinetics, however, it is still an industry in its infancy."
askscience,ff3idcg,t1_ff3hgkr,1579541679.0,"Good addition, there are definately many installations like that around the world. Another one to add to the conversation would be 'microhydro' systems. I didnt include them simply because of the mention of river in the question. These systems are typically very small, less than 10kw, with many at the lower end of the range. You could build a micro hydro setup with a small portion of a river, but they typically use most or all of a small mountain creek, atleast in the installations ive been familiar with. A great technology for remote/mountainous areas nonetheless."
askscience,ff3drzo,t3_erbhzs,1579539064.0,"There are two types of hydro power in rivers. Traditional hydro uses dams and forces the water through a turbine. Depending on the scale of the turbine and the size of the fish, it may or may not be harmful to fish passing down. It does block them from going up unless a fish ladder has been designed in. Dams have a tremendous negative effect on the evironment, from the destruction of habitat when the resivoir forms, to the nearly complete severing of fish populations from the dam itself.

The other type is Hydrokinetic, which functions much more like a wind turbine, but in the river. These types of devices do not require a dam, and thus are not nearly as impactful on the evironment. There have been numerous fish kill studies done with hydrokinetic equipment, and in all cases the fish are able to easily swim around the blades. There is even evidence of fish hanging out in very close proximity to the rotating components, perhaps using them as shelter. These devices can also be used in areas with high tidal flows and represent a clean, safe form of renewable energy."

gaming,fewkmop,t1_few1m95,1579412785.0,You can mod it on console!

SpaceXLounge,fe9zpla,t3_eo7yij,1578942900.0,"I imagine they would want weather conditions that replicate normal flight conditions, so that they could properly validate the abort. Just because the rocket is being expended, doesnt mean they would take additional risks. Just my 2 cents. I am interested to see if anyone with more knowledge of these things pops in."

Feed that curiosity, it will only grow."
space,fcvxypz,t1_fcvxazy,1578012645.0,"Just because i understand the concept generally, and know that the effect will be lessened for tidally locked moons. Was trying to stay general. But yes. The earth moon system is locked and the moon has cooled and solidified, so obviously it has not been enough to keep it liquid. To what extent is it is still being heated? I am not quite sure on that one."
space,fcvn9n9,t1_fcvmfh6,1578005765.0,The short and easy answer is that your arm weighs nothing compared to the moon.

space,fcux7u9,t1_fcuwbau,1577990343.0,"Not to the same extent. The rotation combined with the tidal flow induces cyclic motion in the rock, if it was tidally locked the rock would initially be stressed but would reach an equilibrium and cool off. The planet would experience tidal heating from the orbiting moon in either scenario."
space,fcuup27,t1_fcuu4ba,1577988895.0,Through an effect called tidal heating. The earths gravity distorts the moon. This distortion heats the rock and eventually you get a molten core.
funny,fcuqy2j,t1_fcuqok9,1577986706.0,"This is a good question, i feel you should still be fully aware of how your actions on the pedal translate into (minor) vibrations and sounds. Energy source changes nothing. As long as you have a mechanical system you are going to have feedback in the form of vibration or sound."

funny,fcunmlz,t1_fculfbk,1577984844.0,"Driving by the feel of your vehicle is how probably 99% of people do it. I doubt you drive with your eyes glued to the rpm. The point here is that if you are unable to discerne a massive difference in the output of your vehicle, in a timely manner, then you probably dont need to be in control of 4000lbs of potential death."

teslamotors,fcnuk07,t1_fcn6o2p,1577818705.0,"Ender 3 is hard to beat because you learn so much for such a small investment. Also has ridiculous print quality-per-dollar compared to other machines on the market. Couple that with a wide availability of parts and mods and a large online community, and you've got a winner on your hands."

rosin,fc3jljx,t1_fc3gmd2,1577391233.0,Are you properly calibrating the temp gun? The emissivity value needs to be set for whatever material you are testing.
mildlyinteresting,fby2v26,t1_fby1vqd,1577206753.0,This is some entitled bullshit your spewing. Somebody does something to try to help and suddenly its a step in the wrong direction? What are you doing to help?
AskReddit,fbwfin1,t3_eekte9,1577148566.0,"I dream of designing and building adapters and special equipment to allow disabled children (and adults!) to do the fun activities that the rest of us take for granted. I know there are a lot of people already doing this, but i feel there is alot of people with unique situations who are not served by the current market. I would work on a bespoke basis and design as much as i could for each specific person. I would leverage a mechanical engineering degree and fabrication skills to make peoples dreams a reality. Thats my dream hobby."
