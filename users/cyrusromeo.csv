It’s a double whammy, and you don’t owe anyone an explanation of why you work part time. “Other people’s opinion of me is none of my business”. AKA F them. Good for you and keep up whatever you are doing to get there, and decide on a different answer to answer to anyone asking about why u work part time.... make it a positive... This is exactly what fits for me."
depression,fcgnjwc,t3_eh3ly9,1577642085.0,"I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for about 5 years.... multiple traumas and ptsd caught up w me. And a severe relapsing, remitting chronic illness that has had me bed bound, at times for a year is at my heels. I had many jobs, was extremely independent, nothing stopped me from goals..... And I was fearless fought for those who didnt have a voice,in work and in many situations outside so lots of stories and memories.
Now I don’t want to wake up. I used to have an immaculate house..... it’s a disaster. I was very social, I’m completely isolated. I put things off, I’ve gained weight b/c a sleep med makes me voraciously hungry and I can’t control it...... my husband has major struggles, I brought him to the psych ward, he is finally getting daily help for months, which I believe I need but I’m not suicidal.....

For me, I want to want it. So I’m seeing a therapist to heal or manage the crushing effects of being raised by an extreme narcissist and his enabler, my stepmother while they couldn’t do enough, give enough or buy enough for my step siblings. I’m going to acupuncture for sleep and migraines. The migraines r gone, sleep is better, herbs for emotional issues, I can’t tell.
Human contact helps. If I stop contact, most people dont chase. It’s human nature. If I reach out..... those key people will be there. I try and look at past accomplishments as part of me and give where I can. My knowledge and background of animal rescue, training and rehabilitation and other areas lets me help others in forums.
Maybe u can start doing something like that? Helping someone, in any way, gets me out of my head. Giving an elderly person a ride..... paying for a toy a kid wants and the parent can’t afford......"
depression,fcgk2in,t3_eh3tww,1577640996.0,"She likes you. Coming from a woman who’s dated some real asses, I would recognize it was something that happens to both men and women, just more “obvious”” in men and I wouldn’t care. In fact, I would think wow, he really is genuine and invested and got nervous. Now I definitely want to know more.
I sure as hell hope he doesn’t shut me out and opens up.......

If not, you’ll let a very normal thing turn into something huge that might keep u from exploring more women who.... rightfully so.... will want to be with you. You are worth it, and I promise, spending time fooling around but not having intercourse leads to better sex in the end."
poshmark,f9nusdq,t3_e5ygru,1575491018.0,"I take from different angles... Prop shoes so there's a side and front view. Show boots, w someone wearing them w bootleg, skinny jeans or a classy skirt. Dress up food, sweaters w necklaces, belts, cross post.....
Natural light is best, clean background. If your selling comfortable clothes, show someone wearing them laughing in a hammock or folded by a bench as well as all sides....."
