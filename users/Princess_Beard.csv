Basically as soon as there is *any* viable alternative, you're toast. Blockbuster had no real backup plan for something like Netflix or Redbox, and their inability to be flexible led to the end. It was really arrogance that killed them. Even if they passed on Netflix, they should have been prepared in some other way. They scrambled at the end but it was to little to late."
todayilearned,feyov99,t1_fey7vqa,1579448490.0,"People didn't have any other options, especially if you couldn't afford to go out to the movies. When you're busy and stressed from work it's easy to forget to drive to the blockbuster to drop the tape in the slot. People would always bitch about it, and blockbuster was pretty blind to the fact that everyone hated them and would jump at any chance to move to a decent competitor. I remember when Netflix became really popular, all everyone talked about was how they can finally ditch dealing with Blockbuster. 

Plus, netflix had a bigger selection, and things like older or foreign films Blockbuster didn't have."
todayilearned,feynjbd,t1_feyffcm,1579447998.0,"I worked at a Family Video for a while. They have an adult movie selection in the back that is popular too. People would complain like ""how can you call yourself *family* video and rent porn?"". The answer was that it was family-owned not 100% family-friendly.

It was funny because we were told that when protesters from the church show up, and they will, to not try to discourage them even a little, because they were free advertising. Whenever the news showed up to cover the protesting of our opening of a porn section, the rentals from that section would go WAY up."
todayilearned,feylive,t1_feydm0f,1579447202.0,"Because what the execs didn't see were that most people really hated late fees, but CEOs etc don't really understand what's really going on a lot of the time with common folk. To a rich exec a late fee is just a minor annoyance or even just a small fee to keep a movie longer. To a lot of people, in their hurried working lives, forgetting to drive to the blockbuster to return a movie could turn into an expense they didn't budget for, and becomes a huge headache. So, a company without late fees, who delivers right to your door, and you just have to mail it back? And no store to drive to? Any random person off the street could have told you that was way preferable, which is exactly what happened. 

Blockbuster thought they were successful because people liked them, and maybe in the executives' social circles of upper classes people did, but where I grew up everyone *hated* Blockbuster, but really had no other options to rent movies besides some other video place with less selection and still with late fees. Netflix was the chance to say ""FINALLY, screw blockbuster and their fees, I'm out!""."

What is the reason to keep confessions secret? In order to get into heaven? If they are looking to talk about a tough issue, they can talk to a therapist. There's no reason to keep abuse a secret in a Catholic confessional besides making Bob Abuser feel better about his chances of getting into heaven, well sorry Bob when it comes to abuse I don't really care about your religous beliefs, the priest should go ahead and perform whatever religious rite it is that you can pray on to save your soul or whatever, and then call somebody to check you into a mental health facility.

Even with the offending teacher in jail, I'd not trust that organization to respond accurately in the future, especially if all the same people were in power who were in power during the cover up.

There will always be a risk of abuse in any industry because it's made up of individuals who act on their own. Abusers can have any job description. The difference is, when the organization they belong to find out one of their employees is an offender, do they immediately take the correct legal steps, or cover it up? 

What people see is the organizations response, because sadly it's impossible to prevent all abuse from ever occurring, but how did the organization react to discovering it? When people see the Catholic church, they see a repeat offender who has a history of cover ups and people lining up to pay them even though some who were in power during the cover ups remained in power. 

That's why the Jerry Sundusky[sp?] situation was bad, because people knew there might have been a problem and did nothing. I wouldn't be caught dead supporting that school until all responsible were removed from power, and even then I'd be suspicious of the cover up culture there.
