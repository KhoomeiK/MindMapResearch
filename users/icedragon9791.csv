2meirl4meirl,fdqtowz,t3_emt4sf,1578674657.0,"Yeah, I don't think this is a responsible thing to post. Therapists will only report to a ward if you have a plan of action, or pose a clear and present danger to yourself or others. Saying ""I want to die all the time and often imagine killing myself and being dead"", or ""I have awful thoughts about strangling my cat while she sleeps"" will NOT get you committed. Please tell your therapist this. You will likely be committed if you say ""when I go home, I'm going to take a bottle of pills and kill myself"" or ""i think I'm going to beat my brother to death tomorrow"". These memes discourage a lot of people from seeking help they need. I've heard so many people I know say they don't want to tell their therapists things because of stuff like this."
