I still am very much in love with him but it got a lot better to deal with these emotions. I have amazing friends who helped me get away. I was so busy some days, I dint get time to feel depressed. I still have my blue days but they come occur less as time passes."

happy,feqyfyn,t1_feocxzl,1579347473.0,The only thing that got me through my break up was to lose myself in my job and go to gym. That’s what a lot of my colleagues did too. I’m truly happy to graduate but I have faced a lot of dark times in the hospital where they berate you till you’re broken down. That’s why it’s so important to know more.

I still have really frizzy hair though"
