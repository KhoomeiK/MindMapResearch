Equestrian,fcvz2n2,t1_fcv9btx,1578013372.0,"Bizarre. Honestly could be riding anxiety due to that one bad trainer; especially with more sensitive horses, it's actually been proven they can get PTSD from traumatic situations. If this is the case, going back to basics and slowly working from there, doing liberty work, and just using positive reinforcement and really driving home the message of ""I'll never hurt you, and everything I ask of you will be easily understood and I won't punish you even if you do something wrong that you don't understand yet"".

I have a TB that was badly abused and neglected while in race training outside the US. When he arrived, he was completely catatonic and in shock, and when I rode him for the first time two to three months after he arrived, he wouldn't even go forward, and would shut down and stop whenever he was asked to do something, and then go berserk whenever asked to move forward while he was shut down. He would violently spook and bolt randomly at nothing. It took me two years of hard work and trust, but he finally became a serious prospect for me, and now he's been my Grand Prix jumper for almost 7 years now, and he can even school Intermediare I dressage and we do bridleless work and demos. He still likes to spook at ""ghosts,"" but mostly due to being bored (aka - doesn't have a jump in front of him, or the jump isn't high enough for his liking). Horses are resilient and naturally trusting, even though they're prey animals, oddly enough. As long as you set your mind to it and commit to progress, you'll get it done. It sounds like you genuinely really care about this horse, and I hope all goes well."

It's actually dangerous, the saddle isn't built for jumping, and can damage the horse's back and rub them. It's like riding in an iill-fitting saddle. Same concept. It also places the seat and leg of the rider in a totally different position than is required for jumping.

Equestrian,fcv5wb1,t3_ehl8eo,1577995295.0,"The problem seems to be that your trainer has opted out on teaching you the correct foundation and basics....

It appears you're missing a mandatory 6-8 months of riding on the lunge without reins, and then without stirrups before you're even given reins and then allowed to ride off the lunge.  This gives you the required strength and correct position to be able to ride and start training off the lunge. After about a year of off-the lunge riding on the flat, you actually have to go back on the lunge without stirrups and reins again to start learning and strengthening your position and technique over fences, as well. 

I'd recommend looking for a new trainer, someone who is competent and reputable and will go back and fill this gap before any more time is wasted, you won't be able to learn or progress until this is corrected, and it's actually quite dangerous to be missing the most important part of your education as a rider. You have no independence of aids, every time you try to move one part of your body, the rest of your body moves with it. You're posting violently with your hands, you have a very weak leg and seat, your shoulders aren't in position, your core isn't engaged. I could go on. As long as you're missing that incredibly necessary part of your training, your progression and ability as a rider will be badly stunted, and the longer you wait to fix it, the more difficult it'll be to do so.

People on the internet can't teach you, you have to be actively coached while riding. You have to learn by doing. Just reading the correct way to do it and then trying to repeat it will only cause more problems. You have to have someone with you to be able to help you troubleshoot and figure out what you're doing wrong and how to fix it."

Equestrian,fcv361w,t3_ehunrp,1577993688.0,"The supplement could be causing stomach issues, even on UlcerGard. It definitely could be the taste as well. Any of the pre-packaged supplements sold by companies like SmartPak are pretty much garbage and cause so many issues. Most horses are vastly oversupplemented due to thinking they need these supplements. The only things a horse needs, even upper/top level horses, is a fully, correctly balanced feed (I feed ProElite), calorie replacement when they're at a fitness level of needing to do so, or a hard keeper (I use highly fatty oils with balanced Omega 3s and Omega 6s, and whole flaxseed), salt and minerals, quality hay/soaked hay cubes, and probiotics, for a healthy gut and to treat/prevent ulcers.

If you're not sure what diet to have your horse on and what rations of the above things to feed your horse for their health and fitness needs, contact a top quality feed company (i.e., Pro Elite) and make an appointment for one of their nutritionist representatives to come out to your farm and assess your horse's diet and change what is necessary to change. Only equine nutritionists can really give you advice on what your horse's diet should be. Even vets who don't have the education to be a nutritionist (a degree in equine nutrition) and don't have the knowledge to be qualified to advise you on your horse's diet. I have my region's Pro Elite nutritionist come out and assess the diet of every new sales, in-training, or potential pro horse that arrives at my farm, and I also have her come and regularly assess my horses and increase/decrease things in their diet when needed, or change anything when their exercise has changed."

A really great option is a heart rate monitor.

It's such an incredibly valuable tool, and you can gather a lot of very useful info from it."
Equestrian,fcuyv96,t3_ej1z7z,1577991259.0,"I use local & schooling shows to get my horses out and about and dust away the cobwebs for larger shows as the new season starts, after they've been taking a break for the winter, or during the winter to keep them in that mindset, and it's also great for schooling through mistakes and issues that arise while competing, while still being in a competition environment, without having them come out during a money or qualifying class and losing the chance to be able to finish in the money or qualify for something I'm planning to compete at. 

I also use them for experience for my young & greens, it's to get them out and used to the atmosphere of a show, but not too stressful that it blows their mind and I'm not able to do any successful schooling, and ends up causing travel or show anxiety for them.

I use schooling/local shows for my students, my upper level students (Juniors, Junior Pros, and Adult Ammys) for them to dust off their cobwebs for the new season as well, or they take their own green horses/horses in training, or they ride my new sales horses to see how they do. 

For my less experienced students (intermediates, short stirrup kids), I use schooling shows similar to how I use them for my green horses. Gives them experience, gauges how they do in the environment, and allows them to learn how to relax and deal with the pressure of competing. It's great as well for them to watch other less experienced riders and their mistakes, and we discuss what they're doing and how to fix it. It's great for riders at any level to not only watch other riders who are more experienced than them, but it's also incredibly beneficial to watch riders that are at the same or similar level as them, as they're working through similar mistakes and problems, and they're able to actually watch the mistakes that they themselves make, and discuss how to correct these issues.

There are many uses for schooling shows for riders and horses of all levels, for many different reasons. Schooling shows will help you work out mistakes, watch other riders, and figure out if you're ready to move up a competition level. 

Hope this helps! In all cases, you need to make sure you're ready for competing, and make sure your coach knows what they're doing and has your best interests in mind. I recommend going to a clinic with a reputable trainer and have them assess you and making sure you're being taught correctly and are riding and progressing at the right level for your experience, education, and ability. Have them make sure you're being taught the basic foundation as a rider, and that there's no gaps in your training. If they tell you that you're missing any of these things, your trainer isn't teaching you correctly and is stunting your progress and could get you very badly hurt. If it turns out have a good, reputable trainer, then you're in the right spot and you'll be able to progress and eventually be able to get to compete at higher level competitions."

The noseband of the 3-Ring Combination bit is ridiculously loose and low, which not only entirely screws up the dispersement of pressure, but also can snap the end of the nasal bone, which is why knowledge of bits and equipment and how to put them on is so crucial in any circumstances. Not to mention, for some unforseen reason, OP has a regular cavesson on the headstall as well, which also furthers the conclusion that they have a major, dangerous gap in their knowledge! It also appears that the bit may be resting too low in the horse's mouth due to the cheekpieces not being tightened enough to be adjusted correctly for the size of the horse's face and mouth as well, though I can't really say for sure or not from the angle of the photo.

This is what the bridle with this combination bit & attached cavesson and curb strap through the purchase of the bit SHOULD look like - https://www.doversaddlery.com/images/xl/0001512_2.jpg"
Horses,fcush5z,t1_fcszf6u,1577987614.0,"It's not a 'conclusion', it's a fact that any upper level trainer worth their salt knows. The fact that you're defending the condition your horse is in physically and the bit you're riding in on a horse that appears to have muscle wasting from being completely underconditioned just confirms that you don't have the education or experience to be making these decisions. It's sad that you don't have this knowledge yet and aren't aware of how serious of a problem this can turn out to be, or already is. As an equine professional, it is ""my own damn business"" when I see someone doing things they don't have business doing. You don't have a right to do things that can negatively impact your horse, and in this case, can be severe. From how defensive you're getting, I'm guessing you're very naive on how badly this can impact a horse, you probably didn't even know that these were issues that could occur, and unfortunately, it's probably not even your fault - you're most likely under the tutelage of a fradulent coach, someone who also doesn't know what they're doing, or is too lazy to care about the consequences of doing these things, if you even have a coach at all. I suggest you talk to a coach local to you that knows what they're doing, so they can fully explain the huge repercussions of what I'm attempting to explain to you, but you're trying to brush off and get defensive about. Let them tell you how dangerous it is for a horse's body and progress to be ridden in a very severe bit that works off of long-shanked leverage when the horse is incredibly under-conditioned and has no topline. Let them explain to you what kind of problems it can cause physically, mentally, emotionally, and under saddle progress-wise for a horse. I suggest you screw your head on straight and start seeking out education on these things, before you cause problems with this horse that you'll have no idea to fix. 

If you have no idea that these problems can occur and why, then it's pretty obvious that you definitely aren't experienced enough to ride in such a severe bit. These bits cause problems with even advanced top level riders riding insanely fit horses; they're unnecessary in every situation, so imagine what kind of problems they cause in the hands of riders who don't know what they're doing, riding horses that are underconditioned. There's a saying in the Grand Prix world - ""If you can't do it in a snaffle, you shouldn't be doing it at all."""
Equestrian,fcupdk7,t3_eizbfh,1577985830.0,"Whoops, accidentally deleted my comment when trying to edit. It was along the lines of 'as long as you've got his best interest in mind, it'll be the right decision.'

Finding out what the issue is, if it won't bring his vision back and he has quality of life, won't benefit him any and will only cause you an immense amount of stress and an injury on the wallet. As long as he's not deteriorating and finding the cause is needed to treat him if he's getting worse, there is no reason to waste money on something that won't benefit your horse. You also have many options with giving this horse a happy, fulfilling life, as long as he's comfortable! If you work really hard and strengthen the trusting bond between you too, and take the time, you even have the option of having a career with him. For inspiration, I recommend you do a little research on Endo, a horse that went completely blind due to uveitis, and his owner now does demos and competitions with him, he does mid-level dressage, trail competitions, pas de deux demos, liberty work, and even jumps! I believe there was also an entirely blind horse that was able to go on to have a successful Grand Prix dressage career - I think they even made a movie about him.

The less money you spend on finding an answer for a question that doesn't need answering for your horse to have a happy life, the more money you can spend on things that better his life, like, I don't know, peppermints? Stall toys? A pasture buddy that he likes and trusts so he can go out in the paddock on his own and have a friend to rely on so he can play and buck and gallop around?

Horses,fcri43v,t1_fclcep3,1577902113.0,"You do realise that it's very common to have barn dogs, and some upper level farms (including mine) have herd protection dogs that actually live out with the herd 24/7? As long as your horse is even-tempered and the dog is well-mannered and taught to behave, there is absolutely no reason not to have your dogs out with your horses, and no reason to keep them from playing as long as you're observing good body language on both ends."

Horses,fcrhh3i,t3_ehv1fs,1577901878.0,"Why are you riding a horse you've never ridden in such a severe bit? There's no horse on this planet that requires such a severe bit, and it causes a slew of issues. Not a good idea to ride a new horse in a severe bit. He's also got no topline, his neck is completely underdeveloped, and it looks like he has no muscle tone in his body either. Riding him in such a severe bit that works with leverage, and this bit specifically also works on the bridge of the nose as well, especially such a long-shanked bit as this, when he has no muscle toning or topline creates baaaaaad issues with the back and causes breaking at the poll and at the neck. When the horse is this underconditioned, it cranks and forces the horse into a false frame, and can badly and permanently warp the muscles of the neck and back. Not a good idea at all. Usually wouldn't be this sharp and straightforward, but this is a serious thing, and needs to be confronted."
Horses,fcrgksu,t3_ei2ctr,1577901549.0,"There's no way to tell from just a picture unless it's a completely distinctive breed, like a Fjord, or an Egyptian Arabian (and even then, there's no way to tell it's a cross from a photo, especially a photo where you can't see much of the build of the body or the height, like this one); you can only speculate about what you think the breeding could be from a photo. You'd have to do DNA testing. I'd recommend getting some conformational pictures, best if they're of when the horse doesn't have a winter coat, so you can better see the build of the horse, and then re-posting to see what people speculate the breed to be. To get better results, you should post to somewhere like ChronofHorse.com, where there's a bunch of people with more knowledge and experience online at all times."
Horses,fcrfnbm,t1_fcolgax,1577901203.0,"You can't tell from these photos. He has no paint characteristics, and couldn't even be pink papered registered in APHA. He has no colour characteristics that would lead someone to believe he's paint. Flaxen chestnut (the colour I'm guessing this horse is, but can't say definitively without all colour identification photos) is a colour in many different breeds and I don't believe it's even a a registerable colour in APHA. He actually looks to be a Fjord x a lighter breed, like a Connemara, or even a TB."
Horses,fcrevd4,t3_ei87qo,1577900894.0,"You can't really tell from these pictures. To get the entire correct colour true to the horse, you have to add all of these: pictures of the topline (to see if there's a dorsal stripe), full close-up picture of the legs, to see if there are 'points', the ears, the mane and tail, full body conformation picture, the colour of the skin and eyes, and you have to disclose the breed/breeds of the horse, because some colours are unique to specific breeds, and some colours are under different names, or some breed registries don't accept certain colours for registering, and you have to register the horse under the next closest colour (i.e., Jockey Club [Thoroughbred Registry] does not consider dun to be a Thoroughbred colour, so Thoroughbreds that are true genetic duns have to be registered as a bay).

He looks to be a flaxen chestnut, but I cannot tell you for certain without all of the above listed requirements for identifying colour."

entitledparents,fcra938,t3_eibitn,1577899036.0,"Why would you allow her and even suggest to exchange dogs when it was blatantly obvious, and you even stated you knew so from almost the beginning, that she wasn't anywhere near fit to own a pet, and you knew she wasn't feeding the dog enough OR properly and not giving it enough care and just had it for vanity purposes???? You should have immediately reported her to the animal control authorities in your area and if they didn't act upon the neglect, you should've taken the puppy back ASAP. That was definite enabling, which is just as bad as neglect/abuse in itself. Am I in the Twilight Zone here???"

Equestrian,fcbn3b9,t1_fc9vpbb,1577588756.0,"Hackamores are just as severe as shanked bits, and the longer the shank on the hackamore, the more severe it is, just like with bits, because of the leverage principle. Just because they don't work in the mouth doesn't mean they're less severe - they work on the very sensitive bridge of the nose and the underside of the face, which can actually be even more severe on some horses, depending on their sensitivity. It just works on different pressure points of the face. Not less severe, just different. Not a good idea in the hands of anyone who is less than a very experienced rider."
Equestrian,fcbmdxh,t1_fc9fj8r,1577588529.0,"Bits don't have the stopping power you need. The only answer to truly getting your horse in hand while doing anything is just good old fashioned flatwork, gridwork, and cavalletti exercises. Stronger bits actually cause problems instead of solving them. If you don't have the tools in your toolkit to know how to fix rushing, bolting, or losing engagement in front of, over, or after fences, it's not a good idea to be jumping at all until you've learned how to fix these problems"
Equestrian,fcblmyk,t1_fc9h4fo,1577588293.0,"This isn't correct. You're confusing a long-shanked curb with a gag, neither which needs to be used. They're not a miracle answer, they don't do anything that a snaffle and correct riding and training won't do, and a long-shanked curb isn't legal in English sports, nor should they ever be used with horses that are being ridden in direct contact instead of neck-reining. It also sounds like OP is a beginner to intermediate rider and don't have the experience to be riding in anything stronger than a simple snaffle yet, and even with the experience necessary, that experience would give them the tools to be able to ride any horse in a snaffle anyways, which again, makes these bits counter-intuitive. Not a good idea to recommend severe bits, even a Pelham (another bit that I don't recommend using on any horse) to someone who isn't a very experienced rider."
Equestrian,fcbjkfm,t1_fca8obq,1577587615.0,"There really isn't any difference in severity between these mouthpieces. The only thing that differs is how it sits in the mouth, which is important because every horse's mouth is shaped differently, so every horse has a preference to which mouthpiece they enjoy the most"
Equestrian,fcbinlx,t3_egsrng,1577587325.0,"Depends on the shape of your horse's mouth, the needs of your horse, and how experienced your horse is. Snaffles or anything without leverage is always the best bet. There's really no magic to bitting, there is always a snaffle out there that a horse will like the most, but anything that's not a snaffle is not really going to get you anywhere, and isn't a good shortcut, it usually tends to actually make you go backwards in progress and cause issues that you have to go back and fix anyways; as a Grand Prix rider myself, I've found that anything that's not a snaffle (or something like a Baucher) isn't really worth anything. It's the experience and knowledge of the rider that make the difference. But when looking at snaffles, I always prefer anything rubber-coated or just hard rubber or plastic. That's what I ride my GP jumper in - a rubber-coated Dr. Bristol loose ring. The cheekpiece is for steering, and the mouthpiece is for the type of mouth it's in. Full cheek snaffles are for horses that are a little stickier on steering. Dr. Bristols are great for horses that have low palates (like QHs, especially foundation-breds). Snaffles with keys on the mouthpiece, or with lozenge-style mouthpieces are great for super greenies that have just been broken, it encourages a soft and relaxed mouth, and saliva production. It honestly all depends on the horse, but if your horse really doesn't have any issues or corrections needed, the best thing is something like a rubber coated loose ring (you need bit guards, though, to keep it from pinching the corners of the lip) or a Dee with a double jointed mouthpiece.

Edit: from the sound of it, you have a Waterford bit, which is not dressage legal, and you absolutely don't need with a horse that is very light in the hand. Waterfords are used with pullers."
Equestrian,fcbgwrq,t3_egzh5i,1577586718.0,"Sounds like just a bad idea on your part to bail. You never jump off a spooked/bolted horse in the open. You probably just need more experience riding before you start riding in the open, especially alone. It's really never a good idea to ride alone anyways, let alone out of the arena. Not a good idea to be inexperienced, PLUS riding a spooky horse, PLUS riding in the open, PLUS being alone. Please don't do this again, or next time you might not be so lucky to walk away relatively unscathed."
Equestrian,fcbg2qz,t3_egu15c,1577586429.0,"It's an eating anxiety thing. It's just a type of pawing, but when they're eating. My OTTB mare does this because her previous owner had her out with other broodmares that would chase her off from her food and she lost a bunch of weight, so now she stresses whenever she eats, always expecting to be chased off from her food. It's just an outward manifestation of stress and anxiety for some reason or another"

It's a little fishy that whoever made the original beggy post for someone to follow them around and document the experience (like that's somehow a prize??) said that these were going to be ""5 star events"". Just to add context to the situation, there isn't even such a thing as a 5 star competition. 4 star (called 4**** in the pro equestrian world) is the absolute highest level that exists in 3 day eventing, and there's no upper level rider/trainer/coach or even an OWNER of an upper level horse on this planet that wouldn't have common knowledge of this.
