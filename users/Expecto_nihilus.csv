legaladvice,felk3cs,t1_feliu6k,1579224077.0,"Got it. So TX doesn’t have a standalone parental leave, so if your employer qualifies under FMLA, then that’s the mandate to follow.

Read through this stuff, and you can reference it to correct HR if they are doing something wrong.

[Employee Guide to FMLA](https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/employeeguide.pdf) 

Per the guide: *As long as you are able to return to work before you exhaust your FMLA leave, you must be returned to the same job (or one nearly identical to it).*

Go to page 16 and compare that to what they’ve done.

From what you described to me, it sounds like so e sort of unofficial demotion, unless the role is identical. Also, if you only used 6, they didn’t appear to have any grounds to transfer you without notice, as you hadn’t exhausted your approved time. Also, read your employee handbook, and see how they detail FMLA use.

Mind you, if you have a collective bargaining agreement, that might supersede laws governing private employers.

Couple of moving parts you want to nail down prior to getting a correct interpretation.

Try to talk to HR, and if that fails, file a complaint. 

Easier said than done, I know, but government agencies don’t really favor companies running amuck of these types of leave laws.

Then, last line, there’s always an employment attorney out there willing to take on a case of leave discrimination, constructive discharge and wrongful termination."

Miguel said it, it’s Randall being Randall, which after all is him taking on more than he can handle and having a huge freak out, needing Kevin to come in and help talk him off the ledge.

Adding: also feel like his “you will not get past me,” will take on a deeper meaning as he may mean it to be that this side of him will not manifest for his family to see and be affected by it. Perhaps to mean that he’s beaten back these almost schizophrenic tendencies his entire life, and only Jack knew the true extent from the childhood exposure to the darkness/nightmare talks. Could be that Randall has always been protecting his family from his deepest darkest fears, and this is just them coming back once more.

Have you considered going to an attorney, since management has done nothing with your claim?

Adding: this is also assuming you only want to pursue something through remedies offered by labor laws. If you were assaulted you could also pursue criminal charges if they apply. Workplace protections would kick in in most cases for that too. However, given that you’ve asked for help at work and nothing’s been done, you might be better off getting an employment law attorney involved.

Now my feedback is only assuming that he did a lot of this deplorable stuff while under the influence.

Even without the influence of alcohol an alcoholic is a pretty shitty type of person, and really only exposed their full and true uninhibited nature while using. When not, they’re still not the best people. They may be functioning and be doing great things, but you don’t hit bottom being Mother Teresa.

If he’s giving things up that were influencing him negatively, he may be taking the steps to turn things around. Who knows, he may even be getting professional help.

What you need to do is have a final heart to heart with him and see how he reacts. Be honest and don’t hold back, as ot may be the final conversation you have.

And you should only do what you are comfortable doing within the bounds of your morals and expectations. If you find that it’s worth giving it another shot, do it. If you think about it every which way and you can’t bring yourself to try and still come out respecting yourself in the end, don’t and move on.
