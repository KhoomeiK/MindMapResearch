I used to auto-sync clips first, then group them, so that way if you matched back you got a sync clip instead of just muted video.  So I would sync A-cam, B-cam, C-cam etc – all synced to the same audio, then I would group them.  It also allowed me to check sync on each camera before grouping.  Particularly useful if timecode is good, but not frame accurate.

But that said, I would try syncing A-cam, B-cam, Audio all at once, but you may need to auto-sync at least one clip first.   You certainly do not need to auto-sync all of them."

But I do remember spending more time a few years ago and coming to the conclusion there was little or no benefit to an LLC as an individual (in most states at least).  Places like Wyoming/Nevada do offer such protections, but I am in New York.   And Wyoming/Nevada are, lets say ""different"" kind of states.   It's still unclear what liability I would be protected from, as it is hard to envision a case where my corporate self is liable and my personal self is not.  I work under contract, I am not ""liable"" for any of my edits as far as I know.  

The only thing I can think of is a theoretical corporate loan (more below).

&nbsp;


https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/single-member-llcs.html

> With single member LLCs, there is some uncertainty as to whether creditors would be limited to a charging order **since the rationale for protecting members from other members’ personal debts does not apply if there is only one member**. 
> 
> **Courts in some states have found that the charging order protection doesn't apply with single member LLCs and have allowed creditors to pursue other remedies, including foreclosing on the member's interest or ordering the LLC dissolved.**
> 
> Other states, like **Nevada and Wyoming**, have recently changed their laws to make clear that the charging order protection for debtors applies with all LLCs, regardless of whether they are single or multi-member entities.
> 

Here is the only advantage I can find.  In theory, if you default on a loan, creditors cannot come after your personal holdings.  But as nolo.com points out, it is unlikely most creditors will actually give you a true ""corporate loan"".  They will generally make you guarantee it personally, because you're not a real company you are just a person, and then you're back to square one – being liable for everything.

> In all states, if you form an LLC to operate your business, and don’t personally guarantee or promise to pay its debts, you will ordinarily not be personally liable for the LLC’s debts… **Many creditors, however, don’t want to be left holding the bag if your business goes under so they will demand that you personally guarantee any business loans, credit cards, or other extensions of credit to your LLC. In that situation, you would be personally liable if your LLC’s assets fall short.**



Here's a breakdown from Intuit (do we trust them?) claiming that LLCs offer little protection for individuals. 
[https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/structuring/the-single-member-llc-an-ideal-choice-for-solopreneurs/
](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/structuring/the-single-member-llc-an-ideal-choice-for-solopreneurs/)

> 
> **Sole proprietors [s-corp]** are not protected from any business liabilities. If the business were to take on debt, file bankruptcy, or dissolve, creditors can go after the owner’s personal assets, including bank accounts, houses, cars and other property.
> 
> **Single-member LLCs** are attractive because they can shield owners from the liabilities associated with the business. However, the limited liability protection isn’t as robust as it is for traditional LLCs (those with multiple members).
> 
> A court may overturn any business owner’s liability protection. **Limited liability is based on the idea that the company and the individual are two separate entities. Since a single-member LLC is a disregarded entity, owners are less likely to keep personal and business affairs separate, and a court may be more likely to pierce the corporate veil.**
> 
> If the corporate veil is pierced, the court may allow a creditor to go after the personal assets of the LLC member.
> 
> To keep your liability protection intact, you need to make sure that you cross your T’s and dot your I’s. Single-member LLC owners should maintain a formal operating agreement that governs how the LLC functions, ensuring that the business complies with both federal and state law. Owners should also keep all business and personal financials separate from one another."
editors,feldcin,t1_fel7zsl,1579219517.0,"This is false as far as I understand it.   Of course LLCs are used by major companies.  That's just the point.  They are groups of people who need to limit their liability.   That is, as I understand it, the whole logic of an LLC.

But if you are one person, the logic makes no sense.   If you really want, I can look into this over the weekend.   I remember I could not find any cases wherein solo LLCs were given limited liability protection, but I do have a foggy memory of finding some case law (in NY at least) that clarified that there was no, or very little, protection offered.    As I've said , I also found that there was a theoretical benefit to LLC in California, but no cases given as examples.

Again, we're talking about single-person LLCs, not small companies with 5 employees or partners.   As myself and others have pointed out, it is hard to imagine what the case would be wherein I could be held ""corporately"" liable.   I suppose it could be if I stole some copyrighted material and used it as my own work product.  But I'm pretty sure no judge would say, ""well that's just corporate ovideos so we won't allow as much damages."" 

I'm also genuinely curious about this because the info is so vague.  The whole idea of an LLC seems designed for multiple people.   Please provide a case proving your point if possible.  I fully admit, I have no case proving my point.   I'm curious if any of us can find evidence for either side of this debate.

EDIT: I think I have found that an LLC ***does protect you*** from creditors both ways.  That is if you have a personal debt and default on it, they cannot come after your business and vice versa.  However it seems hardly likely for a sole proprietorship.   I certainly have very little in ""business assets"" that need protecting from personal debt.  I function much like always have, an individual editor.   But I do think there could be cases perhaps (camera people with 100K+ in equipment) where this protection might afford some benefit.  Still not clear that it is a benefit really, but there is a theoretical benefit for sure."
editors,felc3ks,t1_fela61b,1579218688.0,"No, what I found was that most/many accountants and legal websites/textbooks claim that there is no difference (for single people who are incorporated).  There were some references to California having some protections for solo LLCs, but no examples were given.

I didn't find any actual cases that provided evidence one way or the other for LLCs versus S-corp.   But I didn't make a huge project out of looking.

I'm curious what sort of case you'd imagine where your personal assets would be protected by being an LLC?  I'm not arguing, it is just hard for me to think of something where someone would sue me for anything other than essentially personal reasons.   I am purely an editor, I don't go out shooting and such, so perhaps there's more of a thought to liability if you are a one-man production-house.

  Still, it is my (simplistic perhaps) understanding of corporate liability law that it is a way to protect a group from the deeds of an individual -- i.e. a CEO theoretically won't go bankrupt because of the mistakes of an underling, or a corporate ethos gone wrong.  But if you're the CEO, the CFO, and the sole employee it hardly makes sense to distinguish between corporate liability and individual liability, does it?  None of you can claim ""the other guy"" or ""the corporate group"" did the misdeed.

It may also be (and I'm just totally guessing here) that all incorporated people share some small liability protection, and it just doesn't matter whether you're an LLC, an S, or a C. 

In any case, when I looked into it a few years ago, it felt clear (in NY State) that LLC offered no liability advantage over S-corp."

YouShouldKnow,fczywdd,t1_fczx566,1578111015.0,"Well but isn't the truth somewhat more complex?  Google has excellent maps with pretty great directions and quite good time estimations and sometimes it can even reroute you around traffic problems.   All for free.   Isn't this created by tracking users and learning traffic/route patterns?  And keeping the maps updated also works with tracking I believe.

Does apple maps work the same way?

(I'm honestly asking, because I feel like map navigation has improved a lot and I believe it is because of tracking.)"

Your critique may be on point, but I'm not familiar with the story/game, nor have I watched the show, and it just struck me as a funny thought that skipping 10 years makes a story fast.... I mean lots of movies/shows skip 10 years.   Just depends on how the story is told whether it is fast or slow -- could be a single day or a whole lifetime being shown."
