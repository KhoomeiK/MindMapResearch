aww,feei60h,t1_feect75,1579034239.0,I agree. Each process has its own challenges for sure!
aww,fee5bdb,t1_fee3t8j,1579026700.0,"See, thatâ€™s absolutely ridiculous!"
aww,fee01de,t1_fedzywc,1579023495.0,Yeah but adoption shouldnâ€™t be so much more expensive than having a kid regularly!
aww,fedzvsb,t1_fedxst6,1579023393.0,I love it!
aww,fedxfvm,t1_fedx0wa,1579021937.0,Great point lol. I think my thought was that itâ€™s much more of an expensive process before you even HAVE the kid. Unless you are going down the fertility treatment path...
aww,fedtrbs,t1_fedtitv,1579019714.0,"Sure, but just because you foster doesnâ€™t mean that you automatically get to adopt that kid. A lot of times the state will try their hardest to put the kid back with parents or a family member. So thereâ€™s still usually going to be a lot of heartbreak involved there, too."
aww,fedp8dh,t1_fedmpu7,1579016905.0,Thatâ€™s ridiculous! I think itâ€™s important for you to at least know your medical history!!
aww,fedm50h,t1_fedi6ak,1579014907.0,"Unfortunately, adoption is difficult, expensive, and often emotionally crushing. I think itâ€™s great but wish it was easier, because it would be so much better for everyone involved!"
PublicFreakout,fcxwvxc,t1_fcwsw33,1578071681.0,"Thatâ€™s it, thank you!!!"
PublicFreakout,fcwrc71,t1_fcwr8qz,1578034536.0,"I canâ€™t find it :( itâ€™s been posted a couple times though, so Iâ€™m hoping someone will know where to find it!"
PublicFreakout,fcwqjws,t1_fcwfu73,1578033710.0,Donâ€™t forget the lady that used her toddler to whack someone else several times!
