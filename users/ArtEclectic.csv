He also had no wanderlust in spite of the wolf and husky.  The dog wouldn't cross the street without permission, and refused to go to the bathroom on walks, didn't even mark territory.  He was a big chicken.  When he was in our backyard he would hide under our deck to bark and growl at people trespassing in our neighbour's yard, nobody came in ours.  I lived in pretty much the worst neighbourhood in the state, gangs galore, etc.  One day I was walking him, and about 3 or 4 gang members started walking toward me.

That's why almost every baby adopted from China is a girl or a boy with some sort of disability.   Between 1999 and 2013 almost 89% of the ba ies adopted from China into the US were girls (2 of which were my cousins), and it is geustimated that 70% of the abortions were girls."

He often gets up in the middle of the night anymore (he can't tell) and going down or up the stairs can be scary sometimes.  So, rather than worry about that I'm hanging out downstairs so he doesn't need me to carry him back to bed.  Our couch doesn't usually look like a wrinkly bedspread.  It isn't comfortable at all though, so I've got an exercise mat and a comforter as a make-shift mattress on the couch to make it sleepable."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fcoe4rb,t1_fcn9y67,1577830027.0,"I get livid when I see (mostly guys actually) commenting on news articles about male students who have been abused by their female teacher.  If she is at all attractive they say things like they wish they'd had that happen to them when they were a kid.  They say boys want it, so it isn't abuse.  I've seen them say that about pre-teen boys even.  It is disgusting the mentality some people have. 

I'm so very sorry that what happened to you happened.  I hope you reported it, though I also know how very hard that can be to do."
