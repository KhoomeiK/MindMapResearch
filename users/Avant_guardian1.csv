I mean Hilary is a racist too. But Trump made it a key part of his campaign. He wore it on his sleeve. 

Yes, Trump won by being an outsider and anti-establishment figure. A lot of people understand that the economy isnt working for them but they are so brainwashed by the neoliberal media that the “left doesn't work” that they think the only place to turn is to the far right for answers. They wont do the things that work like unionize, organize, and unify with thier immigrant and black co-workers because thats “communism” and will “take their freedom”. So they turn to the far right anti establishment who tells them we need a wall, concentration camps, wars, and the cut taxes and deregulate the capitalist who are the source of their problems. 

In other words Trump won because its easier to blame immigrants, minorities, Lazy people, and Hollywood liberals putting gays and blacks into movies than to admit that capitalism has failed them.
