The greatest feeling later on in life, was those who made fun of me, those who said I would never amount to anything, and all the girls who turned me down or made of me. Well Karma is real and it does happen. Those guys were the ones who were bums on the street, in jail or prison, working at McDonald's lol and the girls ended up either pregnant with a deadbeat baby daddy or turned out to be really ugly and fat and miserable.

SuicideWatch,fbz9m87,t3_efa55h,1577239429.0,I didn't lose  my virginity until I was 18. I felt the same way how you feel about still being a virgin that latecause most of my buddies were having sex and pretty experienced I guess. But it wasn't till I was 20 I truly fell in love and sex is so much better when your making love than just having a random hook up. Since then we have broke after 6 yrs and one stands are still not enjoyable for me. Wait for the right girl and it will be worth it.
