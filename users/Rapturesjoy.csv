At least in black flag, when you collected the papers you got cool songs so that was something.

I think with the RPG approach that they're trying to do now, is emulate EA.  They want it to be grinding, so that players will spend money and the ""Whales"" will go out and spend thousands of pounds/dollars to look the coolest in a game where it should be free!

I hope that in 2020 (ar hindsight) they see the light and go back to oldschool like we all want.

The Job

With the pull of a lever, the starlines collapsed down into stars as the Razors Crest exited hyperspace.  The ship sent a signal to the Star Destroyer in its sight and received one in return.  Docking permission was granted, the ship guided in smoothly through the force field and gently landed.  When the ship docked, the ramp lowered down and the Mandalorian walked down the ramp onto the docking bay.  It was messy, that was for sure and things were going to shit quickly.  It was a good time to be in the Bounty Hunter business.

The Moff waiting for him with a legion of troopers behind smiled and nodded, ‚ÄúMandalorian, welcome.‚Äù

It was evident to the Moff that he had chosen correctly.  The Mandalorian was a warrior through and through not a soldier: a warrior. He could see it in his stance, in his walk, in the way he held his hands, in the way he took in the situation in front of him and in the way he spoke.

‚ÄúYou have a job for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù the man said, not surprised that the warrior was all business, no matter how many things changed, some things always stayed the same.  ‚ÄúCargo transport.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúPrisoner.‚Äù

‚ÄúCarbonite?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the Moff shook his head.  ‚ÄúHe shouldn‚Äôt be any trouble for you, he‚Äôs broken.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù

The Moff smiled, ‚ÄúCome now Mando, you know how thorough I am.‚Äù

The Mandalorian sighed and nodded.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre good?‚Äù

‚ÄúAs long as you‚Äôve got the credits?‚Äù

The Moff pulled out a large bag of credits and handed them over, ‚ÄúThis enough?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll do.‚Äù

The old man laughed.

‚ÄúFollow me.‚Äù"
