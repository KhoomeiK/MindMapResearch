Ok I'm going to interject my favorite Ali G moment.


He's on ""Who wants to win an ounce"" (the parody of who wants to be a millionaire) as the host, and he asks the question,

""Which one is the heaviest?

A. An ounce of hash
B. An ounce of feathers 
C. An ounce of lead
D. They are all the same""

The contestant picks D, and Ali G say ""you fool, it is C, the lead!""

Here's the thing: an ounce is not always the same. We use something called Avoirdupois for hash or feathers, and Troy for certain metals like gold or silver, and they both use ounces as a form of measurement. But if you measure it in grams, a Troy ounce is roughly 31grams, while an avoirdupois ounce is roughly 28 grams. So, technically they aren't all the same.

The correct answer **is** C, so Ali G saying ""you fool"" and then claiming lead is heavier is true, despite every single person in that studio and probably 99% of people watching at home thought he was just being difficult/taking the piss.

Edit: I apparently didn't do a very good job explaining what I meant. Yes you can use Avoirdupois or Troy for anything; a Troy ounce of feathers and a Troy ounce of gold are the same, but if you look at the number of grams in an ADP ounce vs the Troy ounce, the Troy is heavier.

From Wikipedia: ""Troy weight is a system of units of mass that originated in 15th-century England[1], and is primarily used today in the precious metals industry. Its units are the grain, pennyweight (24 grains), troy ounce (20 pennyweights), and troy pound (12 troy ounces). The grain is the same grain used in the more common avoirdupois system. **By contrast, the troy ounce is heavier than the avoirdupois ounce, while the troy pound is lighter than the avoirdupois pound.**""

***EDIT #2:*** As a bunch of people have pointed out, you don't use Avoirdupois for lead. I mixed this situation up with a question on Q.I. where Stephen asks Alan which is heavier, an ounce of gold or an ounce of feathers."

wine,ff9p7fc,t3_es6bgj,1579717815.0,"Two of these stick out for me, one at the very beginning of my career, one very recently.

The first one was when I first worked at the store I now run. I had been in tasting rooms and one other wine shop prior to this (still loved wine, hadn't had it fire on all cylinders yet though), when I came across a Syrah from the Northern Rhone.

It's so stupidly cliche of someone in the Court (that second Somm movie has a few different people calling that their 'aha' wine) but fortunately this was way before any of those films came out. I'd heard they were ""like Islay Scotch and red wine mixed"". Having smelled both, that seemed like a horrible idea. 

***Wrong***

It was about 2008, so Guigal was on their 2005 regular, negociant Crozes-Hermitage. I figured, ""well I've learned over the years that intro level offerings tend to show the least character (hadn't had Coche-Dury yet), but I can afford this one."" 

Stopping for one second, it's important to note that, usually, a high-end producers ""Best"" offerings in a good vintage are the most celebrated, but it makes a touch more sense not to go for those. Good producers are, categorically, the producers who have the proper land and skills required to make a great wine in a so-so vintage. With a producer like Guigal, they have a tendency to let their purchased fruit Crozes-Hermitage just more or less be what it is, year-in year-out. In a good vintage though, everyone's fruit quality goes up, and if you are buying fruit, you'd literally get your pick from all the different growers, who have to remain competitive in their pricing *because* everyone's fruit quality went up. 

I had one sip, and realized that there was a hell of a lot more to this whole wine thing. Absolutely stellar, and certainly characteristic of N. Rhone syrah.


Next was the first time I had an Egon Müller Scharzhofberger (Spatlese technically), which wasn't all that long ago. 

I'd been in the industry for 10 years, passed my Certified Somm exam, and had been a buyer for a long time, so I wasn't expecting surprises. I absolutely got one when I tasted this. Most wines make sense, this one didn't.

What I mean by that is, say you were tasting a cab, and it gives you the brix at harvest on the bottle. You can use that number to determine what the alcohol content should be, so just do the calculation and compare to what it says on the bottle. This wine had too many things that shouldn't be possible. It was 12 g/L of Acid, 8% RS, and about 9% alcohol. Almost everywhere else in the world, it would be impossible to recreate this wine. Acidity is generally supposed to subside as the grapes get more and more ripe. This was not only stupidly high acid, it was also noticeably viscous from the residual sugar. 

Generally when a wine blows my mind, it's the tasting notes (which were amazing) that are responsible. Not this one. Imagine having an ""aha"" moment and you haven't even gotten past ""structure"" yet..."

Picking earlier has pretty much been proven over and over that it doesn't create more balanced wines. In fact, it's actually more un-balanced than the jam monsters.

wine,fd5fur9,t1_fd3igrp,1578177239.0,"So, I run a rather high-end shop (not quite First Growth and Grand Cru burgundy as far as the eye can see, but definitely some heavy hitters on the shelves), and I can shed a bit of light here.

1. If you go to the shop frequently, and you haven't thought to do this, ask what new inventory they might have.

We get new and exciting inventory *all* the time, and generally I bring it in because I was impressed by whatever it is, so talking about it is a really organic and positive experience, generally. If it's *not* a wine shop, and actually more of a liquor store that has a wine selection, it's a little hit and miss. There's usually one person who cares about the wine, and everyone else is indifferent. If it's just wine, it sort of follows that the staff would dig it.

2. If they don't have it on the shelf, that only means they don't believe they would be able to sell it to a walk-in customer, not that they can't get it/don't want to carry it.

Special Orders constituted 32% of our total sales in 2019. I will be the first person to say I would fill the shop to the brim with German Riesling (and Pinot Noir), GC Burgundy, Rioja, and N. Rhone whites and reds if I believed I'd be able to move it. Hell, there are some Georgian wines that I would love to put on the shelf, but there's no way my clientele would buy it. I have, however, special ordered everything mentioned above, including the Georgian wines. 

For any wine buyers out there, this applies to distributors as well. If, for instance, someone carried JJ Prum, but their portfolio in the price book is nowhere near complete, that's because the *distributor* only bought what they thought they could sell. Asking your sales rep if there are any request order forms or DI sheets, and you would be surprised by the response. A guaranteed sale is a guaranteed sale.

And

3. With most shops, if you show some passion/interest in certain areas of the wine world, the staff will think of you when it pops up, and may even do something special.

I knew a guy who loved dessert wines, and he especially liked dessert Sherry. One day I was going through my price books and found a Montilla Moriles 1988 PX (Pedro Ximinez) and brought 3 of them in. I called the customer to say that there would be something cool to see next time he came in, and when he did he was over the moon. He bought all 3 bottles, and thanked me profusely for getting in touch. I have at least 15 customers who are in a few times a week, and I know what their palates are like, so if I have an open bottle of something left over from an event or a tasting, and I know it's their speed, I will make sure to get them a taste even if they're not interested in purchasing the wine. 

So, basically, a well-run shop will be very much about the service aspect, particularly customer relationships, and will always be looking out for their customers. It's actually sort of funny; I've had dozens of people tell me that the Court of Master Sommeliers is the wrong road to go down from a retail standpoint, and I kind of disagree. I believe that the focus on service is what makes the difference between a good and a great shop."

For years, I've wanted to know why. *Now* I know.

First and foremost, even a 2012 is not even remotely old enough to be properly enjoyed, but this was given to me already open. Trimbach is an interesting producer, because though they may grow German grapes, with German names, in German sounding towns, in a village that looks like Germany (which makes sense since it used to be Germany), Trimbach is very French in its winery operation. They have inexpensive negociant wines that get distributed all over the world, and they have their harder to get, but absolutely top of the line estate wines. The best parallel is not a German producer, but actually E. Guigal. The regular Guigal CdR is basically just as mediocre as it gets, whereas La Mouline in Cote Rotie is about as incredible as it gets.

This is the ""La Mouline"" of Trimbach. A case can even be made for ""Chateau d'Ampuis"" being the ""Cuvée Frederic Emile"" of Trimbach.

The thing that is so compelling about this wine is it's fine detail. Generally you can tell a real painting from a print when you get closer to investigate. Investigating the flavors of this wine only leads to more questions. Over-archingly, ""Bergamot"" is the word of the day, but the more you try to narrow it down to ""Earl Grey"" or ""Bergamot"", you smell once and it is one, come back a minute later, it's the other.

The only other wine I've had that did this was a 1992 Remoissenet full Monty. It was as if the acidity itself had notes to it, not the wine.

Amorim, as in ""the largest cork manufacturer in the world""?

I'm curious about the parameters here, chiefly because every single one of us has encountered a cork that was so bone-dry that the worm on the corkscrew is more than enough to pulverize it. If the orientation doesn't make a difference, and the humidity in the bottle doesn't ever change, then no corks should ever dry out. If it is as closed of a system as this article suggests, then it wouldn't be capable of drying out while the bottle is still sealed."

There are millions of people who have been conditioned to believe that anyone speaking out about or against Trump is doing so because Democrats have created a rhetoric that makes it so the very mention of the name immediately enrages them and causing them to spread lies and misinformation about Trump.

Like, you're playing Euchre, drinking Founders, and you ask what Trump is, and all of a sudden the Democrats flip the card table over and start spewing lies and ""shoddy research"".

Idiotic, but if you are able to find a way to convince all the idiots that the smart people are wrong...
