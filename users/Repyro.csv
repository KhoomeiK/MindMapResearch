They don't get a seat at the table anymore. They've provided the strongest argument for not giving a fuck about what it does to them as they have ignored what they did to us for no noticeable change on their daily lifestyle save for a digit changing on their balance sheet.

How about we ignore the fact that we have dragged our feet on every fucking measure of decency out there? Slavery, racism, so on and so forth. Using history as a justification for slow progress is a dumb fucking tactic in this area, because so many countries implement these level of changes reasonably quickly if they give a fuck about it and take the rich people away from the discussion.

That's just off the top of my head and 5 mins on Google. Stopping support now just because Trump puts a spotlight on shit isn't an adequate defense for me.

The private sector is the issue due to what they are doing to the government. 

Warren is fiscally conservative. Biden has said that nothing would fundamentally change. 

They aren't the same. One will put on a show like they are going to try for us, then make deals for corporations while taking advantage that the other side is going to be overt.

The Dems are like the Republicans with a semi functional HR and PR department.

All they have to do is put a couple twists on what the Republicans would have done and all of a sudden we should be happy with it when the result is the same. See the Bush tax cuts and all of the support given to corporations and how their donors overlap with the Republican donors. 

A lot of Trump's corporate sponsors are donating to Biden now. A lot of Hillary's people are part of Warren's campaign now.

Hillary and Bill were swimming in the same waters as Trump for decades and never a word out of them, even though both were associated with Epstein. Its only when he fucks with their bread that they get upset.
