hotones,ff9a7mf,t3_eqt53a,1579708371.0,I am sure they would have one already in NYC (where the show and Heatonist are based) if not for the insane rent prices.
todayilearned,fedssaw,t1_fedeviy,1579019120.0,Anyone have a link? I see people mentioning this all over this thread but can’t find the video anywhere.
todayilearned,fedsjsy,t1_fedro1c,1579018976.0,Like how Ted sounds exactly like Peter Griffin?

television,fdn3btb,t1_fdm26jd,1578576053.0,Did you watch the show? They category names may be a Disney reference but none of the questions have anything to do with Disney. Unless you think knowing the history of Russian Csars is a Disney theme.
science,fdkdrmc,t1_fdjmx49,1578501725.0,I wonder if that Boy Meets World episode when Topanga refuses to say the pledge of allegiance would cause a controversy if it aired on tv today. I am sure there would be a bunch of people on twitter saying that BMW and ABC are anti-America at the very least.
nfl,fdh5awv,t1_fdh4u4p,1578415694.0,5 out of 7 but still can’t believe how close you were.
NYGiants,fdh4qsd,t1_fdh4a03,1578415348.0,Would be very Belichick to have his best coaching protegee under wraps. And he does have a soft spot for the Giants so maybe he is giving back to his old team.
Games,fdh048p,t1_fdft1gj,1578412459.0,Well there was the whole Nintendo Entertainment System followed by Super Nintendo Entertainment System to kick things off. So it’s not unheard of.
television,fde9han,t1_fdbwdnd,1578334123.0,Perhaps all the Humans we see in the show are simply Paul Rudd’s ancestors.
hockey,fcy9gde,t1_fcxyul6,1578076633.0,That does sound like it would be a good fit. But I doubt the Isles would be willing to pay the in division premium I am sure it would cost.
nintendo,fcxh61d,t1_fcsz0lj,1578062819.0,I don’t know a single person who had any of those consoles and I personally never heard of them growing up. You are really overstating how much of they affected the market.
Games,fc5pw89,t1_fc5f5mp,1577463421.0,There was an entire secret level dedicated to KISS in Underground. Though these days I am sure they will be able to afford it because secret levels will now be DLC.
television,fc5p6a0,t1_fc4a1v7,1577463027.0,If you have the USA app all the episodes are available. You just need someone’s cable credentials to log in.
television,fbdsdwp,t1_fbc7dga,1576770251.0,S4 ends Sunday with a 2 hour finale so yeah I’d say the time is right.
