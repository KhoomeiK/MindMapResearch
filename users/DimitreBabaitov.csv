nihilism,ff894y1,t1_ff7x6n5,1579669647.0,Well spotted.
nihilism,ff4cvc7,t1_ff4cejp,1579560622.0,"Or, because true happiness simply doesn't exist. All there is for us are the various occasional distractions causing joy/pleasure."
nihilism,ff23v65,t1_ff1zgq1,1579493082.0,"You could be right, I guess. Either way, death is coming, in one form or another."
nihilism,fez6e1w,t1_fey6yi2,1579454263.0,"Oh yeah, it definitely is."
nihilism,fez3ra8,t1_fez2fqi,1579453595.0,There was a time when nihilists were actually arrested and prosecuted (in Russia). This meme is a humorous representation of how nihilists should be careful about their interactions with non-nihilists. It's satire...based on reality.
nihilism,fevo2gq,t1_feusts6,1579399582.0,"It would be great, if true. I just don't believe that it would be a painless experience. I think that the heat of the blast will provide you with at least a few seconds of excruciating pain before you lose consciousness and die."
nihilism,feus40e,t1_feur6b8,1579389380.0,"No, i did not know that. By the way, i changed my mind...so, go ahead and drop the bomb."
nihilism,feupz52,t3_eqnp98,1579388906.0,"Hey, don't you dare! I live in the Netherlands."
nihilism,fetiwn9,t1_fet5k99,1579375907.0,There is no purpose of this meme.  It is meaningless.
nihilism,fesx9i1,t1_fesr23m,1579369860.0,"I would love to thoroughly explain it to you, but I just don't know how. All I know is that a mindset based on the full acceptance of a zero-hope outcome, includes the drastic increase in the levels of joyfulness within all of the activities of a person. 

Every interaction is ten-times more pleasurable, every joke is ten times more funny...people would even envy you for the good mood you're in...people would even suspect drugs/alcohol use, while you are completely sober. 

I don't know how it exactly works, or why, but from personal experience I can tell you that it does, and due to the euphoria it brings, I don't really feel the need to scrutinize its 'mechanics'."
nihilism,fes2ark,t1_fes1td3,1579360653.0,"Yes, but more than 90 % of the world's population are religiously indoctrinated people."
nihilism,fery844,t3_eqbcna,1579359552.0,"Well, we should keep in mind that most people don't even want to hear about the possibility that life is meaningless. The nihilistic notion can be considered 'heretic' by the members of the general public....so, the reactions of people can vary from slightly agitated to extreme/furious."
nihilism,ferwpho,t1_ferqgup,1579359093.0,"You don't *expect* the worst case scenario, you *fully* *accept* it...upfront and unconditionally. It is that full and unconditional acceptance which, strangly enough, results in unexpected positivity, and even joy."
nihilism,fera4hi,t1_feqxrm8,1579351657.0,"Full and total hopelessness can bring you in a neutral state of mind. It is a neutral 'place' , it's free of expectations, and therefore free of negative effects. Just don't do it with the purpose of receiving hope...beware of your motives while trying it out. It's hard to explain, but, it creates an opposite effect...with no known logic involved. Quite hard to achieve though, and to retain."
nihilism,feooi4h,t1_feont35,1579303074.0,"All that 'clinging to things' is also something that i have to get rid of. Detachment from feelings, people, objects and memories is in my opinion also something worth practicing...and if possible, to the point of perfection."
nihilism,feon23b,t1_feomg7j,1579302479.0,"Yeah, I have been there myself...although I have to say that back then I wasn't a passionate pessimist as I am now, and I actually thought to survive the plane crash....i see now how foolish I've been."
nihilism,feoltpi,t1_feokde2,1579301963.0,"No I haven't heard of it, but from your discription it sounds similar to the zero-hope mindset. Those stoics knew how to bypass a lot of unnecessary ordeals with such a mental exercise."
nihilism,feojtpy,t1_feojo3y,1579301137.0,Yes it is. It can provide a great deal of relief.
nihilism,feojji4,t1_feoipn2,1579300970.0,"Apathy, or 'Apathy on command', can also be of great value."
nihilism,feohoph,t1_feoglnk,1579300361.0,"By fully accepting a worst case scenario regarding the matter of our existence. Only full acceptance of a zero-hope outcome can relieve/protect a person from the harmful stress of all the unnecessary expectations that people sometimes have. I have to say that such a mindset is not easily achievable, and it requires discipline and constant maintenance."
nihilism,fenujsm,t1_fent7u5,1579291001.0,Yes!
nihilism,fentoen,t3_eq4rsd,1579290651.0,Agreed
nihilism,felc650,t1_felbpyt,1579218735.0,"Okay, just keep in mind that relationships are not necessarily all that great."
nihilism,felbbud,t1_felazq5,1579218179.0,"So, then I guess you would want to be married!?"
nihilism,fel60k9,t3_eppuqx,1579214804.0,"Free will is indeed an illusion, especially when it comes to the most important aspects of life: 

We don't want to suffer, YET WE MUST... 

We don't want to die, YET WE MUST... 

Etc. Etc. Etc.... 

Free will is non-existent regarding the really important issues of our existence. The concept of free will is just another ridiculous religious fabrication, designed to blame ourselves for everything, and to divert our attention from the helplessness of our situation.

And it is, indeed, *Friedrich* Nietzsche"
nihilism,fek00kg,t1_fejzvqq,1579189683.0,I guess you're married?!
nihilism,fejzub4,t1_fejz44w,1579189576.0,So be it.
nihilism,fejz19f,t1_fejynjo,1579189072.0,It's just my opinion. Not all memes can be to everyone's liking. The mods have the final decision on branding posts 'unfit' and/or to remove them.
nihilism,fejy2w7,t1_fejxofc,1579188470.0,"Well, it could serve as a confirmation for the logic within the nihilistic notion. And it is humorous...at least to some people."
nihilism,fehlkao,t1_fehkyik,1579119004.0,Is a 'god' of any use to us?
nihilism,fehjc52,t1_fehiv53,1579117716.0,What is a 'god'?
nihilism,feh8dzw,t1_feh87bd,1579111270.0,"I know more than you think. See my videos if you wish. This is a link to my latest one (I am currently on a time-out from video-making)

https://youtu.be/OhmBhV37eSc"
nihilism,feh87m5,t1_feh77ow,1579111164.0,"I just saw that you are a pyrrhonist, which is a good start. Total or radical scepticism is a sign that you are, or have the potential to be, an awakened person."
nihilism,feh7oaj,t1_feh77ow,1579110854.0,"The fact is that it doesn't matter what anyone does, because at the end we will die regardless of the life we've lived. This *shitty* subreddit perfectly represents the nihilistic nature of life.

I know that the facts of reality are not an easy thing to swallow."
nihilism,feh6nr4,t1_feh65em,1579110258.0,More important things like what?
nihilism,fefmigj,t3_eot49y,1579059534.0,Not a single upvote after 4 hours. Wow! I just don't get it. Why are you all so serious? What's wrong with this meme? Has all humor lost its purpose too?
nihilism,feffb90,t1_fefb6j7,1579055114.0,"Someone who believes that there is an evil god, or  gods. Personally, i am convinced that there is no such thing as divine benevolence within the ranks of the divine. Nor is there any kind of duality. I believe that the entire divine is exclusively evil."
nihilism,fef8m6b,t1_fef47w4,1579050764.0,It implies that his marriage has resulted in an increase of the hardships of his life.
nihilism,fef888e,t1_fef2g49,1579050502.0,The cold-bloodedness of reality made me a passionate nihilist. I am also a determined maltheist.
nihilism,fef08ae,t1_feezn5g,1579045129.0,"The nihilistic notion includes more than just complaining. There is such thing as optimistic nihilism, and that can be quite joyful...it relieves a person of all expectations, and therefore of all disappointments as well. It's not easily achievable though, and it needs constant maintenance and discipline."
nihilism,feev24q,t1_feesbqh,1579041834.0,To act as a correspondence platform for similar opinionated people.
nihilism,feeuxo3,t3_eorufm,1579041757.0,"I am disappointed by the downvotes. I see it as a lack of vision and a sense of humor...(no offense). Just lighten up, will you!"
nihilism,feeuk1m,t1_fees9ps,1579041524.0,"Well, if you consider yourself more of a grown-up, you should perhaps share some of your wisdom with us."
nihilism,feakecw,t1_feah5cm,1578949852.0,"My English is bad as it is, not to mention all of these 'unofficial' and 'newly invented' terms/acronyms...but hey, there are worse things right?"
nihilism,fead81t,t1_feaclnb,1578947185.0,"I guess you're not the cheerful type of person... It's okay though, I have my moments too."
nihilism,fe9m1fk,t1_fe9kvef,1578939341.0,I wasn't aware of the repost-fact. I am a member of this subreddit for less than a year.
nihilism,fe9jczb,t1_fe9cb4j,1578938109.0,"Perhaps they use all three of the phrases, two of which you added...depending on their mood, the time of the day...or in a random order."
nihilism,fdvwt89,t3_en18ut,1578752575.0,"There is no going back for the awakened. ""Ignorance is bliss""....although the right nihilistic mindset should be able to relieve stress, and even depression. It's not easy to achieve though, strict discipline is required, and it needs constant maintenance."
nihilism,fdvvpov,t1_fdvudk8,1578752100.0,"Agreed...although, who is to say that animals in general aren't self-aware, or at least some of them!"
nihilism,fdr7wnz,t1_fdr6nfa,1578680672.0,"Only if you say ""please""."
nihilism,fdr7fox,t1_fdqpc76,1578680568.0,Patience please.
nihilism,fdqt6zj,t3_emt61h,1578674355.0,"I have been given a similar advice once before. I was told that it would be best for me to just be a 'passersby'.

I have also personally experienced the relief that a zero-hope/zero-expectations mindset can bring.
It's not so easy to maintain this particular mindset though. Currently, i lack perseverance...and that is rather foolish of me."
nihilism,fdqbya3,t1_fdpb68t,1578662489.0,I am finding them all over the internet.

nihilism,fdo7xxk,t1_fdo7is7,1578600450.0,"I was asking because you mentioned it and because I am currently over 95 kilograms, and therefore I do feel that I am dealing with overweight. Doesn't bother me all that much either."
nihilism,fdo4cfq,t1_fdm9dko,1578598662.0,How much do you weigh?
nihilism,fdldfsj,t3_elzfkq,1578521658.0,"""Ignorance is bliss"". It really is. I envy those overly optimistic people. I wish that i was one of them. So, i am not annoyed by them."
nihilism,fdii0cj,t1_fdi7mdl,1578443358.0,"Oh, well, then I guess I've been ""just tired"" for a while now."

nihilism,fd9io7g,t1_fd99vo4,1578233933.0,"Well, i used to believe that the purpose of life is relative to its subjects...i believe that the souls of all living creatures are the final product of life, and are being harvested after death and consumed by our god(s)...but a very open minded moderator of this subreddit made a very wise remark...he/she said that even if our existence serves a purpose, then what purpose serves the existence of our god(s)?! So, it is logical to assume that existence in general (all the way up to the very top of the divine hierarchy) is meaningless and therefore serves no real purpose as a whole."
nihilism,fcyly0m,t1_fcylr4n,1578082451.0,Maybe it is Danny Devito. Perhaps the parents reconsidered after all.

nihilism,fcotvrm,t1_fcotnly,1577841423.0,It definitely is. This 'jumping' back and forth between possibilities can be harmful as well.
nihilism,fcotn6c,t1_fcosn8w,1577841237.0,I speak for myself when I say that there are moments of doubt....doubt about various aspects of existence. Not everyone is a nihilist all the time.

nihilism,fclblo6,t3_ehr3qa,1577744061.0,Have you tried to simply accept the fact that our existence is 'bad news'?.And i mean to *fully* accept it. Full acceptance of a worst-case scenario may relieve you from the harmful effects of all those disappointments.
