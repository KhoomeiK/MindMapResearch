I like how theoretical matchups are only valid when they apply to Bernie. When it's someone else, no no no. Bernie has not been vetted or treated as a general candidate because he's never been one. 

To date, he's not been the nominee and has never even led or been close enough to be treated like one. 

If you remember 2008, Obama hadn't been vetted much because he was just some guy and he was losing pretty handily to Clinton. When his path to victory began, the vetting began and people were pretty quick to remove the shiny veneer. 

Thankfully, he won anyway. Helped that he's super charismatic (I don't know why charisma matters but it does) and there's no real dirt on him. Bernie... Yeeeeeah, he stands no chance. Republicans will have a field day with him. All the reasons Obama won are why Bernie can't. He has not and cannot capture that Obama coalition. 

I don't know the future any better than you do, but I do know the past and the present (generally good indicators of the future) very well."
