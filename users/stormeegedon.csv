dogs,ffdyx46,t3_et3f8t,1579832393.0,There’s about a million reasons in your life not to get another puppy and about one reason you should (getting a show prospect). I suggest you politely decline the offer and tell her you would have loved to take the puppy but think it’s in everyone’s best interest to not at this time. Ask her to think of you in a few years if she has another show prospect she may want you to have.

Ask if there are any puppies they have produced that are also showing that you can go meet up with too. I often times have my breeder bringing interested buyers over to see my dogs and watch us at competitions.

dogs,ffcguyi,t3_esv236,1579799178.0,"Magik and Tennessee stood out the most to me because most of their dogs are being titled or bred to dogs that have titled, in a variety of areas. They may be novice level titles, but it gives them a leg up on the other two as goldens are a very versatile breed, and I personally value their ability to walk into a variety of performance venues and do well.

Either way, all dogs I checked are properly health tested and I don't think you could go wrong with any of them. I don't think I found any of them with published NCL testing, so I HIGHLY recommend you ask about that. It is a very recently identified disease in the breed, but it is absolutely devastating, and all it takes is a DNA swab to identify if the dog is clear/carrier/affected. I would not purchase from any breeder who has not performed the test."

dogs,ffaaej3,t3_esicks,1579731022.0,"I think French Bulldogs are a good choice. Boston Terriers as well. They both have hilariously large personalities in tiny bodies. 

Do note that if you acquire a young puppy, you will need to adjust your schedule for the first few months, or get a dog walker/someone to come let the puppy out. Especially with smaller dogs, the time between potty breaks is pretty short, and potty training will be a nightmare if you leave a puppy along for that long until it is older and can hold it in better. If that is something you want to avoid, adopting an older dog from a rescue/shelter could be an option. Just vet your rescues carefully and work with one who is knowledgeable about the dogs they have and good at placing in appropriate homes.

PS: I’m sorry you’re getting such junk comments on this thread. That normally doesn’t happen here!"
dogs,ff9rpbj,t3_esg8pf,1579719677.0,"Get a different breeder. A good breeder listens to their owners and picks a puppy based on what will work best for that household. If a male works better for you than a female, she is saying no because she isn’t listening to you as a person. 

Unless your breed is incredibly rare, there’s little reason to stick it out with this breeder."
k9sports,ff9ca99,t1_ff93gtz,1579709721.0,"Which means you simply need to build value for the tunnel. It doesn’t matter what shape it is, the end goal is a dog that gets the tunnel cue and seeks out the tunnel entrance. Which is simply a matter of training. If your dog is struggling on curved tunnels, then he needs to see straight tunnels with reinforcement at the end of it to build the connection of when and where the reward comes from. This is where throwing your reward is beneficial, because as you’ve seen, he knows the reward comes from you and he’s seeking you out. 

Remember, it’s day 2. Back things up until he’s driving to a straight tunnel before playing around with shapes. Granted, that’s on the instructor to work that out, but you should be encouraged to speak up when you feel something is set too difficult/too high for your dog and ask the instructor how to adjust."

k9sports,ff6lf9e,t3_erd89i,1579629700.0,"What a weekend! Another agility trial, another set of runs for Bones with J1FT. A knocked bar in jumpers, a refusal in standard. Rinse and repeat. But Bucky! Baby boy got his first excellent jumpers Q! That really turned things around. He also got another T2B leg, and at this rate, he'll have the title well before Bones does.

Spent Monday field training with a friend. My main priority right now is getting Bucky's hand delivery on water nailed down. For a while he would get out of the water, shake, drop the bird, and then look for another mark. We did a lot of short marks and got a lot of great hand deliveries from him! Still going to be working that moving forward though. Bones did a long distance blind AND he whistle sat on the last one for me, and I'm super proud. I suck at teaching blinds and haven't figured out how to build his confidence for going out like that, but it's starting to come together.

We then took some pictures of water entries with my friend's new camera that she wants to break in. [Twinkle Toe Bones](https://imgur.com/hUkac3Q) always has flashy water entries. But [Bucky](https://imgur.com/rJabYCf) is really starting to come into his own lately, and his entries have been beautiful. No reason not to get 10/10 in the style category!"

Honestly, £1000 a year for 5 dogs is a steal, even if all it is is catastrophic insurance. But I suggest you look very closely at any plans you get a quote for and evaluate from there if insurance is something you want to invest in. There’s no right or wrong choice here."

There are likely way more reasons why you shouldn’t get a dog in this situation than why you should, but I wanted to offer up a bit more low maintenance of an option here.

I will say though, the preference for almost all experienced households is to train behaviors and not cues early on. Things like potty training, polite greetings, crate training, proper play, biting, etc. These are behaviors that will be beneficial throughout the dog’s life time and you will be grateful to have focused on them early on."

As I said, if it wasn’t for the insurance they would have euthanized. But either way, you don’t get to determine what amount of money someone is willing to invest in the survival of their pet is “irresponsible”. That’s purely asinine. 

You said you had never seen a $5000 vet bill. I showed you that I have. Despite the fact that I have never paid out for one, I am still able to understand that others have. None of us can tell you if a large vet bill will come our way, and it’s incredibly irresponsible to pretend it cannot happen.

At no point did the extensive and professional team of vets working with my friend and her dog suggest that it would be more humane to euthanize. 

You can’t see past yourself because the concept of a high medical bill was apparently impossible for you to comprehend because you personally haven’t shelled out for it. I haven’t had to pay anywhere near that for a single incident, but I can still grasp the idea that others have."

An easy pet that really only needs one dedicated owner to care for it, so if one roommate decides they aren’t into it, the animal won’t suffer because of it, and they’re really undervalued as pets.

Either way, this is a complex disease and situation for your dog that you really need to work with a vet you trust.

Bones is 5 and my first competition dog. He's been a handful, but he's taught me a ton along the way.

* Hunting: JH WC

* Miscellaneous: RN TKP CCA VC

Bucky turned 2 in October and is rolling with the punches pretty well for his age.

* Agility: OA, OAJ, OF

* Hunting: WC

* Miscellaneous: RN TKI


I plan on wrapping up Bucky's JH this year (despite the Master Amateur Invitational being 2 hours north of me this year, the amount of tests available in spring is quite lacking), and want to chip away at the more advanced titles in agility. Bones is basically ready for the SH, but I am shit at training blind retrieves and one of these days I'll actually get it done. A lot of it is just finding the time and the space to train it, but maybe when he's 12 we'll have that wrapped up. I'll just focus on his MACH for now."

Of course, it isn’t ideal to crate for so long, but your situation makes it necessary. If you don’t like how much crate time he has, consider getting as large of a crate as you can manage to fit in your home, or use an x-pen (or two) to create a dog safe space that gives him more room to move around in.

It was good to get them out there since we hadn't really done any field training since probably the end of October. I've been working on [Bones](https://imgur.com/Rg7rX4i) not flashing the marks as they go down and really committing them to memory until I move to set him up for the next fall. I tried to get him to watch them for 5 seconds, but he only watched for 2 seconds and then proceeded to pin his memory bird, giving me a giant middle finger that he doesn't need to look for 5 seconds, thank you very much. [Bucky](https://imgur.com/kdwdXjr) mostly needs water work right now, but we only did land that day. Either way, 100% delivery to hand, and some good information to work on as we train in the upcoming months. He struggled on the shorter marks because he would blaze right by them and would have to spend some time hunting the bird, but would still have been a perfectly fine pass for a hunt test.

I did puppy work on the side with 8 different ""puppies"", aged anywhere from 5 months to 2 years. I love working with puppies and getting them to exposure to the field, but I think a lot of them struggled with the environment overall. I had a lot of them just spend time letting their dogs take in the environment and acclimate to everything going on. But Bucky's two little brothers (full siblings, repeat breeding) were a blast to work with. I got both of them on birds and worked on them happily returning to their handlers. I hope they both come back for the February day, because I'd like to start introducing them to what a gun blind is and how to seek them out and expect bumpers/birds from them.

If you’re serious about SAR work, I suggest getting involved with your local SAR team without a dog, letting them know you’re interested in working with the K9 team in the future. This will give you a chance to see those dogs in action and it may sway your breed choice one way or the other. The team will likely be able to help you pick out a good breeder/puppy as well and get you started out on the right foot. But many SAR teams get tons of requests from people that want their dog to be a hero, so many will require you as a human to spend time working for their team before they commit to letting you train a dog with them.

I never said anything about rehoming...

I never said anything about mixed dogs, that was all on you. We’re talking about getting a lab here, why in the world are you even talking about mixes?

I never said dogs aren’t special? I said my breeder isn’t special because she isn’t a rarity here in producing healthy, titles, and solid working dogs. There are many breeders out there just like her. 

Both my dogs are AKC registered. As are all the dogs in their pedigree dating back too many generations to count. Do you think working dogs aren’t registered? One of my dogs comes from a litter filled with OTCH, MACH, MH, and AGCH dogs. You don’t get those titles by being unpapered.

dogs,fe55z4q,t1_fe51rgz,1578865948.0,"I feel like we’re having two different conversations here. 

Pretty much everyone here agrees you should go to a reputable breeder. One who health tests and proves their dog and is breeding to better the breed. But that was never part of our conversation. Why are you even talking about mixes in the first place?

Our conversation started with your statement that OP should go to a conformation breeder to get a hunting dog, because the show dogs are going to be “the best of the best” for Op. And I’d argue that is far from the truth here. My breeder, as great as she is, isn’t special. I can find you a stupid amount of working dog breeders of my breed with very little effort. Same goes for labs, a breed that is very large and incredibly versatile. 

I don’t think you have much experience with hunting dogs. They aren’t wild maniacs who live for nothing but hunting. A well bred hunting dog isn’t on 24/7. Even an active hunter doesn’t hunt year around, and they make pretty great pets for active homes, which OP sounds exactly like that. Both of my dogs are active in sports and hunting, but they don’t *need* those things to be happy. They need to be in a home that provides them with adequate exercise and mental stimulation, which an active pet home is more than capable of doing. A well bred hunting lab isn’t going to be a monster if it doesn’t get to hunt."

Is there a typical time of the week/day that this dog is there? If they’re predictable, you can likely avoid them by going at different time. This is just the unfortunate reality that you can only control your own actions, and not those of others."

She is not respected because of how long she has been in the breed, but because of how much an impact her breedings have made to it. Several of her dogs are in the “breed bible” so to speak. 

I am personally very involved in my breed club in several different aspects, including the field practices we hold on a monthly basis. I have not worked with only 8 puppies, I have worked with many young dogs in our club. Last year I hosted a puppy training day and had 20 dogs ranging from 3 months to 2 years, from a variety of lines, to get them started in field work, which was very well received by the club and they’re all eager for more, which is why I’m taking time out of my training days to help those who need it. I will help any dog that someone brings to me, but I can tell you with experience here that “the best of the best” working and hunting dogs absolutely do not come from conformation breeders. 

It’s cute that you think working and hunting breeders don’t care about the longevity, structure, or wellbeing of their dogs. Those are absolutely the most important things in breeding a working dog. No one out in the field wants a phenomenal drivey dog that’s going to retire at 5. In fact, looking at the lines local to me, longevity is much stronger and lines are healthier in those breeding for the field. This doesn’t mean that they’re healthier because they’re field dogs. 

And ofc dogs require training. But if someone is looking for a hunting lab, why should they start off their training by having to convince their dog that the bird isn’t going to eat them and can instead get a healthy and well put together dog that *wants* to do the job it was purchased for?

I do not disagree with a vast majority of your first comment. Going to the breed club is a great suggestion and is what I would suggest myself. But we contradict in that I would suggest OP look for a breeder that’s breeding active working or field trial/hunt test dogs as that more heavily aligns with what they are looking for in a dog."

I know it may be shocking to hear, but you can have a well put together dog that was still bred with work in mind. 

Have you ever seen the lab conformation ring? A small percentage of those dogs are built for hunting. I have never seen anything like that gets put up in the show ring representative of what I see out hunting, both in upland and water game. 

Good luck finding an FC/AFC lab with a CH attached to it as well. It is an extreme rarity and props to you if you find even one being bred. 

If you think the conformation ring awards dogs that are ideal for the work their breed was intended for, you likely aren’t involved in these sports at all."

Lol what? If someone wants a working dog, the best of the best is going to come from someone breeding for that working ability, which conformation lab breeders are not. Show labs absolutely “should” be able to work just as well as the rest, but that would require their breeders to prioritize that instinct, which many don’t. There are definitely some breeding CH dogs with killer hunting instinct, but not all of them are.
