SandersForPresident,fdnbyav,t1_fdjbdyr,1578582487.0,">Getting the Talibans out of Afghanistan helped to stop the genocide of the Hazara population by the Taliban's Pashtun majority. 

The Afshar massacre only happened because Saudi backed wahhabi militias were able to operate almost totally unimpeded. Saudi Arabia, you know, the US client state and also primary financier of jihadist terror. Besides, if the US gave even one fuck about the Hazaras, it wouldn't have been giving the Taliban regime millions of dollars all throughout that period. And beyond THAT the situation would never have deteriorated to that point if the US hadn't funded, armed, and trained every jihadist in the region to fight the Soviets. Meanwhile in modern Afghanistan the Hazaras are *still* persecuted by the US backed gov.

>It's easy to be anti-war when you're living comfortably in your home not getting killed by your neighbor because of your race or sexual orientation.

Well first off, where were you deployed at specifically? What was your MOS and your unit? Why aren't you there right now Mr Warhawk? Don't whine to me about comfort when you're advocating for inflicting misery on millions of people from the comfort of your home.

>That was the reality of the Talibans, my sweet summer child. 

Being gay in US occupied Afghanistan is still illegal and will still get you imprisoned or killed, so not much changed there. Child sex slavery meanwhile has only become *more* common in areas where the Taliban were driven out. And actually if the US gave a fuck, why does it support the oil monarchies in that region, who not only spread radical jihadist ideologies but also openly enslave and persecute (often to death) minorities in their own countries and abroad? Why does the US support regimes in Central and South America that slaughter indigenous tribes and drive them off their land?

>Like all wars do. Did you expect us and the Talibans to fight with water guns?

No, i expect the US not to kill hundreds of thousands of people for nothing.

>No, the Iraq war did. Not the Afghanistan war. 

Are you stupid? Do you think only one thing can contribute to something else? Afghan produced a lot of hardened jihadists that would go on to join ISIS and also was a source of procuring arms, since you can't move a foot in any direction in Afghan without tripping over abandoned American arms.

>Not true. The Talibans used to control all of Afghanistan. Now, while their influence is growing back, they are nowhere near their peak. 

Turns out yeah, you *are* stupid, and you *are* blindly talking out of your ass and trying to condescend to me while you do it. Motherfucker the Taliban at its height didn't even control 3/4 of the country. Learn some fucking history before you spout off stupid."

So your claim that Russia is exactly as bad as the US is based on a single border issue with a neighbor and what amounted to a few facebook ads seen by like 300 people?
