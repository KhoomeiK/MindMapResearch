MTGLegacy,ff7jwkg,t1_ff7iwvl,1579651290.0,"You're playing brainstorms and fetches, yes. And they are skill testing cards. But your deck is pro-active not reactive. You're not trying to set up all your future draws to answer all your opponents plays, you're just digging for the last piece of the puzzle and once you find it, and force it into play, you win. 

Burn is also a very linear deck that is good for beginners. Same with Reanimator.

In legacy, every deck has a high skill ceiling. But there are differences in where the skill floor lies. If you're an inexperienced or 'bad' magic player, playing a deck like storm, elves, lands, D&T, etc will be very difficult because the skill *floor* is pretty low. Playing those decks badly will very rarely result in wins. The skill floor in decks like reanimator, SnT, or burn is significantly higher, and you will find yourself winning matches by just ignoring your opponent and playing the cards in your hand. Obviously there are more optimal plays that would increase your win rate, but even playing sub-optimally in these decks can produce wins with a fair amount of consistency."

Only the youngest millennials are in their 20s. Some are almost 40 and are in their prime earning years.
