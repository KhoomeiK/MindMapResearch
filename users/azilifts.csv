We actually tried to teach ours with a patch of fake grass to go inside when I started working, around his 6 months old, but with no success, he was already too potty trained, for the best I guess."
BrittanySpaniel,ff6wuee,t1_ff6ojg7,1579636526.0,"I know it can be overwhelming to have to take her out on leash every time she needs to go but I would really encourage you to put in the work early on and not use the pee pads. We didn't use them with our boy and now he will not go inside under any circumstances while I know some dogs that are ""pee pads trained"" and they are very challenging.  
Make sure you get plenty of chew toys like kongs because she will be a shark the first months and especially when the teeth come out. Gives her something to do while she is alone too.  
They are very trainable dogs, so smart, so have fun!"
dogs,fenlckg,t1_fenjq9x,1579287149.0,"Yeah that's my main issue with unlegitimate ""service dogs"", they can put people and their legit trained SD in serious danger. People are growing really selfish!"
reactivedogs,fejqztn,t1_feiohls,1579183664.0,"You are doing your best I'm sure!   
People are good where I live, but my personal goal is to prevent on-leash greetings, so I'm think I'm going with ""NO DOGS - ASK TO PET"" and hopefully we are able to go out with the muzzle on soon so I'm hopeful all of his gear will scream ""ask permission to my mom before approaching"" lol"
reactivedogs,fehuhtw,t3_ep4511,1579124118.0,"I like ""please give me space"" because it gives people directions on how to interact with you (which is to not interact) and prevent the barking to even happen.  
What are you getting as a vest? I am looking for one to get text on for my boy."
reactivedogs,fegvyua,t3_ep3wj1,1579103757.0,That's a really cool way to track progress! Great job you two!
reactivedogs,fcytmwi,t1_fcy7ci2,1578086824.0,"Ugh mine looks like a forever puppy... I'm about to get him ""No dogs"" patches."
reactivedogs,fcxyhd5,t1_fcxtupz,1578072234.0,That's the main reason we are doing muzzle training!
dogs,fcuaoxk,t3_eiyrel,1577976569.0,"Be patient, gentle and give ear massage while you do it, and don't forget a good treat! Our dog gets a bully stick after every bath/ear cleaning and that encourages him to be still and patient."
AskReddit,fcu5ojd,t3_eis8dy,1577973176.0,"Had to figure a school pathway that would work for me but now I am working in marketing for a startup and this kind of fast-paced, goal-oriented job keeps my brain busy. Got into a competitive sport rather than drugs and it's done me good. I think I'm going to be ok."
lookatmydog,fc6bk6i,t3_ege7ij,1577476744.0,Looking good!
dogs,fc3spw2,t3_efyv57,1577397656.0,"Hi there! I have a young Brittany and he acts the same way with his best friend neutered female. When they see each other he licks private parts, she tries to hump his face, and they can chase and play together for hours. Thankfully he is very gentle with her, they are both good at communicating when they want to play or not. They saw each other a few days this week and they are exhausted for running around so much but I think it did them good.  
I always watch out for sign of one being too pushy but they regulate pretty good themselves and will both lay down when quiet.  
I understand your embarrassment, it's tough to be helpless when your dogs goes crazy like that. We do tons of training and it looks like it goes out the window when that one fun dog comes around."
dogs,fbxtle5,t3_eeps7p,1577200162.0,Congrats to both of you! We are currently working towards CGC and I hope we can take it to the next level one day :)
reactivedogs,fbuaghs,t1_fbt8qom,1577110879.0,">There are even leashes for people to use at the trail if they “forgot” their’s

Are these people serious?? There is everything to encourage them to leash their dogs and they still choose to ignore them."
