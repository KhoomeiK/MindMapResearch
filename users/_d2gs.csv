SCAcirclejerk,fev3nw8,t3_eqjf9f,1579392731.0,"OP, I can help you with this. I personally take stacks of my own money and I wash them in my washing machine on cold ([how to clean your money](https://www.wikihow.com/Clean-Money)), then I put them in a blender to get the iron out ([money smoothie](https://www.stevespanglerscience.com/lab/experiments/money-smoothie/)), then I use my money soup and I put it in a glass bottle with a dropper and I just add it to my moisturizer at night/as needed. Just 3-100 drops is the perfect amount.

I hope that helps :)"

SCAcirclejerk,fem493a,t1_fem3633,1579239237.0,"It also seems like its people who feel slighted by seeing hauls of people who spent an insane amount of money on something like la mer or every product from de. Those were the big arguments I was seeing, about how OTHER people are buying too much skincare for their tastes, and posting in a sub about our collective obsession with skincare. I think if there were more comments like ""Yes, I will downsize my own hoard of products bc I am personally destroying the environment,"" then maybe I wouldn't have jerked it but I honestly came here thinking it was already done, lol."
TBI,fem3m1j,t3_epuh7o,1579238635.0,"I'm years out but with (likely, but I hope not...) life long problems from my TBIS. Therapy has helped the most for me to become aware of a lot of the issues stemming directly from my brain injuries and finding solutions for them.

Nothing on body posture, I make sleep and exercise a huge priority though.

For light and audio, I literally wear sunglasses outside but when I'm at school I haven't figured out a way to deal with bright lighting other than taking exams elsewhere or separately with a professor.

Loud noises and places I know will be loud I wear hi fidelity ear plugs. Buy them, they are worth it. Those really changed a lot of things for me, like now I can go to restaurants or coffee shops and not get a migraine. For tinnitus, I have just learned to deal with it, but a white noise machine for when you sleep might be helpful.

I had horrible judgment skills. For a good year or two after I had zero self control and did whatever I wanted, all of the time. I think it comes back with time because it's something you can sort of relearn, even if its the hard way.

For my chronic head pain, I suspect it will never go away, so now I am working on finding what triggers me and avoiding those triggers. Some things are unavoidable, like work and school and random loud noises from living in a city, but I'm doing my best. Some days I have to stay home and wait it out.

A year ago, I never thought I would be where I am today, and its far from perfect, but I am happy with my progress."

It can be anything like working towards 10-25 push ups, or 10 minutes of core. I do those and don't apply them to my work outs, because I tend to ignore core when I weight lift. Those are really little things that don't take up much time in the day. Or if you feel like you're not eating well, or try eating vegetarian a couple days a week. Stuff you already do during the day. Or 30 minutes a day on a coursera class that you are interested in. Or 10 minutes on duolingo. Or write one thing you are grateful for in your dailies. When you volunteer once a week, write about what happened.

You can also not bother with dailies. I don't have them right now until I actually get busy with school."
