> In NHANES, diet was assessed using 24-h dietary recalls. From 1999-2002, one 24-hour dietary recall was
conducted in-person in the NHANES Mobile Examination Center. From 2003 onwards, a second 24-hour recall
was administered by a telephone interview approximately 3-10 days after the first recall.1 Multiple-Pass Method
was to enhance complete and accurate food recall and reduce respondent burden.2 All foods and beverages
consumed during the previous 24 hours (midnight to midnight) were recorded. The dietary sampling weights
additionally account for the dietary interview-specific nonresponse and day of the week for dietary interviews.3
To assess intake of major foods groups, we harmonized the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food
Patterns Equivalents Database and MyPyramid Equivalents Database across survey cycles. Nutrients were
estimated based on cycle-specific versions of the USDA Food and Nutrition Database for Dietary Studies
(FNDDS). We defined high-quality carbohydrate as carbohydrate from whole grains, whole fruit, legumes, and
non-starchy vegetables and low-quality carbohydrate as carbohydrate from refined grains, added sugar, fruit
juice, potato, and other starchy vegetables. Animal protein included protein from fish/seafood, unprocessed red
meat, processed meat, poultry, egg, dairy products, and other animal sources. Plant protein included protein
from whole grains, refined grains, nuts, legumes, soy, and other plant sources. Specific types of fatty acids
included SFAs and unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs and PUFAs). To correct for measurement error, we applied
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) method to estimate the usual intake of each macronutrient. As documented
in prior literature, the NCI method is the preferred method for estimating usual intake distribution from 24-hour
dietary recalls.

**Ingredients**

* 1 large cauliflower , cut into bite-sized florets
* 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil , or preferred oil (plus more for roasting)
* 1/2 medium red onion , diced (sub yellow onion)
* 1 small serrano pepper , sliced (sub jalapeño or 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes)
* 4 cloves garlic , minced or chopped
* 1 tablespoon fresh ginger , grated (sub frozen or paste)
* 1 tablespoon curry powder , more if desired
* 1 14 ounce can diced tomatoes
* 2-3 teaspoons agave nectar (or any sweetener)
* 1 14 ounce can coconut milk , full-fat
* 1 15 ounce can chickpeas , rinsed and drained well
* 1 lime , juiced
* 1/3 cup cilantro , chopped (more for serving)
* 3/4 teaspoon salt , more to taste (more for roasting)
* Fresh cracked pepper , to taste

For Serving (Optional)

* Naan
* Rice (about 3 cups cooked)

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 450° F (230° C). Place cauliflower florets on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with oil and lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Combine together with your hands. Roast for 15-20 minutes until tender and lightly browned. Toss halfway.

2. To make the curry sauce (I usually start this after the cauliflower has been roasting for 5 minutes). In a large pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add onions and sauté until translucent, about 2-3 minutes. Now add serrano peppers and sauté for 1-2 minutes until slightly softened.

3. Add garlic and ginger and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant. Now add the curry powder and sauté until fragrant, about 30-60 seconds. 

4. Add diced tomatoes, agave and salt. Cook for 2-3 minutes to soften and meld flavors. Pour in coconut milk and lightly simmer for 3-4 minutes to reduce (don't boil - lower heat if needed).

5. Transfer to a blender and blend on high until smooth (you can skip blending if you want a chunkier sauce - just simmer a few minutes more to thicken). Pour back into pan along with chickpeas and lime juice. Gently simmer to warm throughout. 

6. Now add roasted cauliflower and gently toss to combine well (heat longer if needed). Taste for seasoning and add more if needed. Remove from heat, sprinkle with cilantro. Top over rice and serve with naan, lime wedges, and cut cilantro if desired. Enjoy!"

PlantBasedDiet,fensqoe,t3_eq59th,1579290162.0,"> On Friday, USDA Deputy Under Secretary Brandon Lipps announced [new proposed rules](https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/resource-files/school-meals-flexibilities-fact-sheet.pdf) for the Food and Nutrition Service that would allow schools to cut the amount of vegetables and fruits required at lunch and breakfasts while giving them the ability to sell more pizza, burgers and fries to students. The agency is responsible for administering nutritional programs that feed nearly 30 million students at 99,000 schools.

> Lipps said the changes will help address what he described as unintended issues that developed as a result of the regulations put in place during the Obama administration. For example, when schools were trying to implement innovative solutions such as grab-and-go breakfast off a cart or meals in the classroom, they were forced to give kids two bananas to meet minimum federal requirements.

> But Colin Schwartz, deputy director of legislative affairs for Center for Science in the Public Interest, says that the rules, if finalized, “would create a huge loophole in school nutrition guidelines, paving the way for children to choose pizza, burgers, french fries and other foods high in calories, saturated fat or sodium in place of balanced school meals every day.”

> He says that limiting the variety of vegetables served allows french fries to become even [more central](https://www.ift.org/news-and-publications/news/2018/september/04/study-finds-french-fries-are-number-1-veggie-consumed-by-american-toddlers) to students’ diets. He says the potato lobby has been pushing for this change, and that the potato industry was behind a change that happened quietly [last March](https://www.fns.usda.gov/school-breakfast-program-substitution-vegetables-fruit). The USDA allowed school food authorities participating in the School Breakfast Program to substitute potatoes in place of fruit without including vegetables from other subgroups in the weekly menus.

> “The Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010 has been called one of the most important obesity-prevention policy achievements in recent decades,” Schwartz said. “Yet the Trump administration seems intent on sabotaging it. While there’s plenty of room to strengthen school nutrition further, these proposals taken together instead are basically aiming a flamethrower at it.”

> Potatoes USA, the marketing organization for the 2,500 commercial potato growers, did not respond to requests for comment.

 > Specifically, the new rules allow schools to cut the amount of fruit included in breakfasts served outside of the cafeteria from one cup to a half cup. The remaining calories could be filled with sweet pastries and granola bars. For lunches, the new rules allow schools to offer potatoes as a vegetable everyday and gives them the flexibility to provide pizza and burgers over more nutritious choices.

> Nancy Roman, president of Partnership for a Healthier, said that these announced changes, “sound like a step in the wrong direction. If anything, the science of the past few years suggests that we need even more fruits and vegetables at each meal, and the less processed the better. It’s not just what is on the plate, but how it is prepared. And particularly young children need more exposure to unprocessed, easy-to-eat, fruits, vegetables and greens.”

> These changes come on the heels of other controversial program alterations rolled out by Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue in 2019, weakening school nutrition standards for whole grain, nonfat milk and sodium, all of which had been tightened during the Obama administration. Perdue cited food waste and nonparticipation as key rationales for the shift. The rule was part of USDA’s Regulatory Reform Agenda, developed in response to President Trump’s executive order to eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens."

**Objective** This review aimed to evaluate the effects of soy isoflavones on cognition in adults.

**Data Sources** The PUBMED, EMBASE, Ovid Medline, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched.

**Study Selection** Two researchers independently screened 1955 records, using the PICOS criteria: participants were adults; intervention was dietary sources with soy isoflavones or isolated soy isoflavones; comparator was any comparator; outcome was cognitive function; study type was randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A third researcher was consulted to resolve any discrepancies. Sixteen RCTs were included and their quality assessed.

**Data Extraction** Information on study design, characteristics of participants, and outcomes was extracted. PRISMA guidelines were followed.

**Data Analysis** A random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool estimates across studies. In the 16 RCTs (1386 participants, mean age = 60 y), soy isoflavones were found to improve overall cognitive function (standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07–0.32) and memory (SMD, 0.15; 95%CI, 0.03–0.26).

> Food’s environmental impacts are created by millions of diverse producers. To identify solutions that are effective under this heterogeneity, we consolidated data covering five environmental indicators; 38,700 farms; and 1600 processors, packaging types, and retailers. Impact can vary 50-fold among producers of the same product, creating substantial mitigation opportunities. However, mitigation is complicated by trade-offs, multiple ways for producers to achieve low impacts, and interactions throughout the supply chain. Producers have limits on how far they can reduce impacts. *Most strikingly, impacts of the lowest-impact animal products typically exceed those of vegetable substitutes, providing new evidence for the importance of dietary change.*

[Food-Miles and the Relative Climate Impacts of Food Choices in the United States](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es702969f#/doi/full/10.1021/es702969f)

> Transportation as a whole represents only 11% of life-cycle GHG emissions, and final delivery from producer to retail contributes only 4%. Different food groups exhibit a large range in GHG-intensity; on average, red meat is around 150% more GHG-intensive than chicken or fish. Thus, we suggest that dietary shift can be a more effective means of lowering an average household’s food-related climate footprint than “buying local.” Shifting less than one day per week’s worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken, fish, eggs, or a vegetable-based diet achieves more GHG reduction than buying all locally sourced food.

[The Impacts of Dietary Change on Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Land Use, Water Use, and Health: A Systematic Review.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165797)

> Food production is a major driver of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water and land use, and dietary risk factors are contributors to non-communicable diseases. Shifts in dietary patterns can therefore potentially provide benefits for both the environment and health. However, there is uncertainty about the magnitude of these impacts, and the dietary changes necessary to achieve them. We systematically review the evidence on changes in GHG emissions, land use, and water use, from shifting current dietary intakes to environmentally sustainable dietary patterns. We find 14 common sustainable dietary patterns across reviewed studies, with reductions as high as 70–80% of GHG emissions and land use, and 50% of water use (with medians of about 20–30% for these indicators across all studies) possible by adopting sustainable dietary patterns. **Reductions in environmental footprints were generally proportional to the magnitude of animal-based food restriction.** Dietary shifts also yielded modest benefits in all-cause mortality risk. Our review reveals that environmental and health benefits are possible by shifting current Western diets to a variety of more sustainable dietary patterns.

For emissions of different dietary patterns, you can see [this figure](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165797.g002) from the second study linked, and [this one](https://i.imgur.com/JnQFOhh.png) from the [latest IPCC report.](https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl-report-download-page/?fbclid=IwAR0iu6vaPbWsDbvXbhQlJPQajg2Totu-MHnEu0EvRhW3EO0A1mUkOLoCX-c) This report also noting:

> Figure 5.12 shows the technical mitigation potentials of some scenarios of alternative diets examined in the literature. Stehfest et al. (2009) were among the first to examine these questions. They found that under the most extreme scenario, **where no animal products are consumed at all, adequate food production in 2050 could be achieved on less land than is currently used**, allowing considerable forest regeneration, and reducing land-based greenhouse gas emissions to one third of the reference “business-as-usual” case for 2050, a reduction of 7.8 Gt CO2-eq yr-1. Springmann et al. (2016b) recently estimated similar emissions reduction potential of 8 Gt CO2-eq yr-1 from a vegan diet without animal-sourced foods. This defines the upper bound of the technical mitigation potential of demand side measures.

Note that this estimates we'd use less land than we do now even with a projected population growth to 9 billion by 2050 if we were eating plant-based.

> Lifting fines has had a surprising dual effect: More patrons are returning to the library, with their late materials in hand. Chicago saw a 240% increase in return of materials within three weeks of implementing its fine-free policy last month. The library system also had 400 more card renewals compared with that time last year.

> ""It became clear to us that there were families that couldn't afford to pay the fines and therefore couldn't return the materials, so then we just lost them as patrons altogether,"" said Andrea Telli, the city's library commissioner. ""We wanted our materials back, and more importantly, we wanted our patrons back.""

> The Chicago Public Library started looking at data that showed socioeconomic disparities within its system. Telli said low-income communities had more overdue fines than some of the more affluent neighborhoods of Chicago. It wasn't that Chicagoans in poorer areas were necessarily racking up more fines, she said, but rather, those patrons were unable to pay the overdue balances.

> According to Chicago Public Library's internal analysis, some 30% of people living on the South Side of Chicago couldn't check out materials because they had reached the $10 fine limit for overdue materials. That ratio, however, dropped roughly 15% among cardholders on the more affluent North Side. Nearly a quarter of blocked accounts belonged to children under 14.

> Having library fines stand in the way of people searching for jobs and social services ""just seemed counterintuitive to us,"" Telli said."
