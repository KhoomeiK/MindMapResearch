I guess maybe I don't understand the context of what exactly happened to make these stories ""no longer canon"". Is Disney actively trying to hide/censor them? Is Disney just saying they didn't buy the rights to those stories? Did Disney actually say ""those stories are no longer canon"" and did they offer an explanation for why?

>If Disney bought the rights to Ghostbusters and declared the ghosts were all just a figment of one of the character's imagination, we'd all have to disregard decades of lore? lol

To continue processing future installments of the property, yeah? If you choose to ""regard"" the lore, you can, but that's now officially headcanon at best.

In practice, though, I would say that there are two properties. The old Ghostbusters, which I like, and the new Ghostbusters which is different and significantly worse because of the differences, and I'd stop paying attention to Ghostbusters, **just like I stopped paying attention to Star Wars**."

Everything depends on how you define things. Nobody is looking to create a whole new fucking language to have a mathematical conversation. A lot of things are already defined. If your things have multiplication and addition, then **yes, you can arbitrarily slap those things into a Taylor series**. 

>it's not just necessarily true that you can do it for anything you want. 

OP didn't say anything you want. He said anything you want, **as long as** that thing has multiplication and addition. Do you not understand what the phrase ""as long as"" means?

Name any object that has multiplication and addition and I'll plug it into a Taylor series for you to show you that you can.

>You actually have to implicitly or explicitly decide/accept ""e^A means *blah* when A is a matrix"". You are making a set theoretic definition that determines a set of items which determines a domain set for e^A .

Now you're just being obtuse. If you're even discussing Taylor series at all, you have an implicit understanding that e^(x) corresponds to the Taylor series for e^x. And that Taylor series only needs two things to interpret: mutliplication and addition for the x object.

If you don't want to use these tools, no one is going to force you. But you still *could*, which is all OP said."

For the surreals, definitely not (see: size).

~~As for the long line, I'd wager the existence of such a topology to be impossible or independent of ZF, though I cannot think of any simple proof. The reals don't like to play nicely with uncountable cardinals.~~

Since we're allowing arbitrary topologies, just fix a bijection from long line to R and use the generated topology from that. This topology, however, will be ""chaotic"" and have nothing in common with the standard topology on R, and thus thinking of the long line as a ""different topology on R"" is not exactly useful."

Yes, *if* you have defined what it means to exponentiate an object, *then* you can exponentiate an object. If you haven't defined what it means, then you can't.

Square matrices, a priori, can be self-multiplied and these products can be added. That is *sufficient* to plug them in to a Taylor series and get a meaningful answer.

Non-square matrices, a priori, cannot. **If** you do something, like, say

>Define the matrix product A\*A as A\*A=C for some matrix C with the same dimensions as A and each entry of C obtained by multiplying corresponding entries of A with themselves, make A\*A=C undefined any time A is square. 

Then yes, you can now plug in non-square matrices, as you now have invented a notion of self-multiplication for them. And correct, square matrices ""don't work"" in this new paradigm.

It is not surprising and it does not contradict anything OP said to do this.

>My main point with all that being that whether the statement ""can self multiply implies is square"" is true or false depends. It isn't true for all objects.

But it's not a statement about all objects. It's a statement about matrices and matrix multiplication.

And it's 100% true if you assume, as the OP did, that ""multiply"" in that sentence refers to standard matrix multiplication and not a new operation that you just made up."
