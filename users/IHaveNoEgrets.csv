When my soon to be SIL went dress shopping for the first round, she took my family with her: Brother, me (F), mom, and dad. Apparently, despite my dad's and my total lack of fashion sense, we were all waay more supportive than her FOO would have been."

Bonus points if Rufus is large and annoyed-looking. Borrow a Great Dane or a Bassett hound if you must: they always look exasperated."
