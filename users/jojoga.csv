The Final Fantasy challenge is still far away now, but at the very least, she surely will shine there."
lostidols,ff8jpeh,t1_ff6pz1z,1579681679.0,"Hehe your old idea has a point. Would be nice to run lower t1 objectives with a sub-par Team B formation. Having wrena, jiao, kebos or what ever high-end dps is overkill for all of these. A standard jim/emo formation would be strong enough to do them. Maybe make them half as fast or something, while you're not actively on the objective or some other penalty.  
I doubt it will happen though.."
lostidols,ff8jexi,t1_ff6p0hk,1579681266.0,"I do agree that there should be more difficult mission, ie ones with high requirements. However it's already tough to get the saders you want, without waiting a whole year for certain events and that, I think, is the purpose of these recruit missions. Raising the pool of possible saders by those you already have would gravely worsen those odds.  
I couldn't finish the last 25 areas of ""Party Time"", just because I was missing DP and Carpet.."
lostidols,ff8j7me,t1_ff6qupw,1579680983.0,"Seconded.  
  
People playing for longer might not need it as badly, but being able to only craft 4 items to level 6 currently, I juggle around a lot.  
I understand it wasn't a thing to disenchant without a loss and thus no need to implement a system like that, but since we _can_ now and the efficiency of L's very much advises to, adapting items to the situation is helping a great lot. Having a serious DPS machine fueled by goldfind reduces the need to move mats from early-game goldfind to lategame dps items, but to a degree it's still there.  
On that note, thank you game for handing me Natalies Cape, Bubbas Goggles and now even Siris Scepter. All that goldfind pleases the greedy blue dragon..  
  
edit: Another idea I've just had that might be even easier/faster to implement: how about adding the leveling feature of hitting shift/ctrl/shift+ctrl for increasing legendary-levels in steps of 2/5/max?"
