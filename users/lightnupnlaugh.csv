Divorce,ff4o0b4,t3_erlyvy,1579568265.0,I am sorry for your struggles and pain. You are not alone and this group is such a great place to vent and get things off your chest. However you choose to proceed just know there are people here willing to listen and offer support.
Divorce,ff23a9v,t3_er6drz,1579492630.0,"I promise things get better! It takes time and I wish there was a fast forward button but you will grow and change and heal. We are hear to listen when you need to vent. This group of people are wonderful at being supportive and offering advice.
I hope you will take a little comfort in knowing you are not alone."
Divorce,ff21gtl,t1_ff1zdgd,1579491248.0,"I total understand what you are saying. I too understand why he cheated. In my case I know that he was lonely being so far from home. I just wish that before things got to that point he would have had an honest and straightforward talk with me. I even forgive him and do not hate him. I have my moments of wanting him to feel regret over leaving me for his AP, and have my moments when I want their relationship to fail but most of the time I want him to be happy. I want so much better for myself than carrying around anger and resentment. I choose to focus on being happy and looking for the silver lining. I hope that soon your happiness will outweigh other feelings. I have faith that you will find that right person when the time is right."
Divorce,ff0ww1h,t1_ff0tj3n,1579473057.0,"I am so sorry that she is playing mind games with you, it's hard enough to deal with without a carrot being dangled. It is really cruel of her. Your either in or out. As much as you may want to try to work things out it would never be the same, how could you ever trust her fully again? She has proved she is a cheater. You deserve someone that is loyal. That is something that as I get further away from where I was I realize fully now. At the beginning I would have done anything to work things out. I am just finally getting to the point where I feel like I might be ready to try dating ( some days..lol). I haven't yet. 
I still believe with my whole heart that this has happened for a reason and look forward to that.
You will have good days and bad days, but it will get better I promise."
Divorce,fezt1bf,t1_fezolu7,1579461279.0,In previous post he stated this all happened after his wife touched another man's penis.
Divorce,fezs0x2,t1_felv2p5,1579460905.0,"Most days I am good, I am happy most of the time. I imagine that on some level I will always mourn the loss but I know time helps. I have had a little over a year to deal with it. How are you doing? Are you feeling better?"
Divorce,fewz7r0,t3_eqpa3q,1579421751.0,My 1st question would be is this paperwork from a court and signed by a judge?
Divorce,fewvmsu,t3_eqsw10,1579420194.0,"Are there any other witnesses to what your Mom is accusing him of? Did she do it publicly? Did she make allegations that she knew were false?
Please read this article to get clarity on the laws.

I am so sorry that you are having to worry and go through this."
Divorce,fev8te4,t3_eqlm4o,1579394470.0,"It is amazing how devastating those words can be.
I am so sorry for what you are going through."
AskReddit,femhkia,t3_epn15l,1579255914.0,They have obviously got the wrong house! They better clean up their mess before they leave!
Divorce,fee153f,t1_fee0279,1579024219.0,He didn't say HE hadn't had sex in 30 years!! He was talking about his in laws.
Divorce,feceaab,t1_fece6gy,1578971854.0,Also she has already proved she will lie!!
Divorce,fece6gy,t3_enw84a,1578971783.0,"Pondering the proof she gave you for pregnancy..
Did she pee on a test right in front of you? Letters nowadays can be faked so easy..google "" letter confirming pregnancy"" .. just saying.
Focus on the child you have right now. If this girl is pregnant you have many months to deal with getting parental rights.
You may not be seeing all the red flags but many of us are!! Do not continue to sleep with her!
There are plenty of other women out there looking for a good guy. You deserve someone who will love and trust you."

AskReddit,fe0wr9k,t3_enk4aj,1578819652.0,Sam Elliott....I just love hearing his voice...
Divorce,fdog7q5,t3_embjpo,1578604508.0,I also went the no lawyer route. It is possible when both people can be reasonably and amicable. We have kids and were still able to get through things without arguing. Best of luck.
Divorce,fdjm2w7,t3_ellrbf,1578477431.0,I can relate to this thought as I have it frequently...
Divorce,fd9csc9,t3_ekamlt,1578231562.0,"You have had to endure an immense amount of tragedy and pain in such a short time. I am so sorry for your losses. I encourage you to continue to seek help, just because you haven't had success so far doesn't mean you won't find it. Honestly finding the right therapist can be really challenging for some people but the right one can be life changing."
Divorce,fd98ohe,t3_ekcjlc,1578230041.0,"Just because you go the route legally to not pay her alimony doesn't mean that you can't help her out for a little while if needed outside of the judgment. You just would not be legally obligated to.
It is solely up to you."
Divorce,fcpsq80,t3_eibv3x,1577871314.0,I am so sorry that you are going through this. I wish that you were not hurting. I know how painful it can be. You are not alone. My exhusband went to work in another country and met someone else and ended our marriage after 20 years ( we were together for 30) Just know that things do get better.
aww,fclctaf,t3_ehrx0y,1577744841.0,"I totally had to zoom in because it looks so real!   
How long does a picture like this take to make?"
aww,fcl7659,t3_ehri6v,1577741274.0,What an awesome shot!
Divorce,fcl6i49,t3_ehru8f,1577740861.0,As hard as it is you have to remember they are your STBX's family and they always will be. They can sympathize with your situation and still love and care about you but at the end day  99% of the time they feel obligated to stand by family.
Divorce,fcl0eq0,t3_ehoc73,1577737095.0,"I agree with telling them together. I also think it's a good idea to give them time to process it, so try not to ask questions or expect them to talk. Give them time it's tough on everyone."
aww,fckux59,t1_fcknog1,1577733724.0,That bird is getting fed...its packing winter weight
Divorce,fcjmvkp,t3_ehgpqk,1577694396.0,It's a little unreasonable for her to just kick you to the curb. I would ask for a period of time to stay there to get on your feet.
Divorce,fcjm2dn,t3_eh6tps,1577693301.0,"It is so very hard at this point to imagine being happy but please know you are not alone. There are so many people in this group that know where you are standing and have felt or are feeling the pain you are feeling. It is a temporary feeling, you will not always feel this way. Each day that you get through is a day closer to your happiness, the happiness you deserve. I know how much it hurts to be betrayed and to have them walk away like its nothing. I also know how easy it is to romanticize the relationship and blame yourself. I have been there and am still there at times, but I know that each day it does get better. I know that idle time is the most dangerous with your mind going down a dark road. I can honestly say volunteering at a rescue has been such a huge help to me. It helps me feel like I am making a difference if even in a small way. Please seek help either a crisis line or therapist you deserve to feel better."
Divorce,fcje1p0,t1_fcj7tt2,1577684330.0,Ashwagandha really helps..good luck you've got this!
AskReddit,fc8cvo0,t1_fc7smxu,1577532064.0,Miss my Dad too! Would love to listen to his directions.
AskReddit,fc8cqri,t1_fc7qyd8,1577531977.0,I would love to hear my Dads voice too! Taking a long drive every time I need my Dad's advice.
AskReddit,fc8c3wg,t1_fc7e8vc,1577531569.0,I would definitely use navigation a LOT more!!!
AskReddit,fc8bv0z,t1_fc7kezk,1577531409.0,You wouldn't understand half the directions...
AskReddit,fc8bg1x,t3_egk1ef,1577531139.0,Sam Elliott
Divorce,fc70liz,t3_egjgpa,1577494342.0,I believe she would have to get permission through the courts to do this legally and that you would have to be notified and have the right to object. I would check the laws for your state.
Divorce,fc6zz4i,t3_egj1a3,1577493873.0,I struggled with this too. I wanted to have the same last name as my kids. I figured I could always change it back to my maiden later if I decide to.
Divorce,fc6zinp,t1_fc6x4rt,1577493536.0,This is wonderful advice!! #2  too often we are just waiting to speak and not really hearing what the other person is saying. If they are bringing it up it is usually because it matters to them.
Divorce,fc53e4g,t1_fc4doq5,1577441073.0,"Your situation sucks but you are doing the right thing. I hope this causes her to feel rock bottom and decide to get help. I started meditating too, when I do it I feel so much better.. Wishing you strength and happiness."
AskReddit,fbyuhb4,t1_fbynyf7,1577226659.0,California's invading everywhere..lol...Oregon and Washington hit hard...
funny,fbyjfk5,t1_fbyed40,1577218420.0,I think sometimes people just get really pissed off seeing people steal..probably wasn't even thinking about saving the company money. Just no way are you taking something that doesn't belong to you.
Divorce,fbhu8hp,t3_edd3xp,1576882468.0,"Started volunteering at a rescue. It really helped me tremendously, there were many days I didn't want to get out of bed and dreaded going but I always feel better once I am there."
