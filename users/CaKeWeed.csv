depression,ff34b3f,t3_er4u6g,1579533325.0,"If you do a weight workout, the burn is essentially self harm to the muscles without causing actual damage which is nice.

As you mentioned theres endorphines in exercise which i think is a result of physically using your muscles a lot in a relatively short time.

For example if you are benching with a heavy weight and a barbell, your brain cant care about your pain because you are trying not to get crushed by a pole even if you know someone is there if you need them to lift it.

Working out also helps with self image which can help you a bit in that aspect.

About being tired out, you can do it in steps like any other thing. If for example you wanna run; its not really easy to find someone who cant do that for 2 minutes. Next day do 2 minutes and 10 seconds. Not a big difference, barely noticable. You can do that but make sure to start from small and to be diciplined to keep doing it. Yes running can be tiring but if you start from a little it wont be exruciating or annoying as say 15 minutes of running"

If you have kids with her so she wont leave you, you are chaining yourself to care about a child that you arent sure if you even want. You'll have to deal with sleep deprivation while its young, you'll spend a lot of money on it until its 18 and possibly after that. As a result you'll have a lot less time with your gf and sometimes when you do you'll be way too tired to do anything. Also after all that you have no guarentee that things between you two will stay in a good place. Theres all the risks in pregnancy, miscariages, ppd ect.

Im not going to advise you on either but i will tell you that when unsure, it is more reasonable to have no change yet.

depression,feg4r3r,t1_feeycef,1579076862.0,"Youre right that its not his job to help you but he should at least care and be patient with you. You are right that depression is a lot of work but most of it is you fixing it not others, the part others do is help you feel better and manage sometimes and stuff of the sort. Tbh you dont need him to overcome depression but having him there will make it so much easier that you arent doing it alone with no support. I do get why he being optimistic can get mad that you arent, its because he sees it as something simple to do, like asking someone drink water and having them misunderstand the request. He just doesnt see it as something you dont have much or any control over.

You mentioned that he's smart so this will help because he'll need to listen and learn from this (if you do this): Do some research on how the chemical imbalance is. Like brain regions and stuff and maybe graphs. If you can find stuff about it, maybe get something to show how being unable to do stuff or having an uncontrolable mood. Understand what all of it is and then think of how to connect that to your symtoms in a mini lecture or something.

When he has time show him all this and make sure he understands each part before you continue. I think this is the right approach because this way you are showing him that its a physical problem that causes dumb shit to happen in the brain, therefore making it easier to understand. Also definately tell him that he'll need to be patient with you because every relationship needs that but depression needs a lot of it.

If you try this tell me how it goes. I really hope he'll understand or at least try to because its important to have people and i dont have that. I guess this is the 'i guide others to treasure i cannot possess' meme. Btw whichever way this goes regardless of what you do you can dm me if you need a chat"

I've tried meds. Heart palpatations and weird feelings physically in my head, welts on my back and sleep deprivation were the side effects and i have no energy to deal with them.

I've slept 8 hours a night in forever, been at the gym for 2 years (first year i didnt eat well so i didnt grow much tho), i dont drink. The most i had was half a beer.

I've already 'finished' with bad thoughts because i always proved them wrong. 'Im short af no girl will date me' she loses out not me, if she doesnt then its her loss and idc about my height. 'Im ugly' started working out and havent stopped and i see myself as good looking. I basically did that until all my toughts stopped.

Sometimes though a friend will say something that will hurt and it will make me feel depressed and i have no proof to backup the claim that my reaction thought is false. I asked one friend if he cares and he said a lot but other times he treats me badly so thats basically what i go through.

Nobody gives a shit about how you look because nobody started looking the way they want to and also nobody thinks of what youre doing they are all doing their thing. You working out is the body telling the brain it needs to grow and you have unnecessary fat that the brain says become muscle to. Over time if you eat the same the % of fat will decrease and by then you'll feel better about yourself and will have an easier time switching to a healthy diet which i promise isnt bad if you choose healthy foods that you like. For example a homemade burger is good if you dont have too many of. Steak is good just dont have too much. In short eat nurturing meals that arent processed and dont have too much of anything

depression,fdajos9,t3_ekdk18,1578246837.0,I dont care about my life and i wouldnt care if the entire place got nuked as long as i'd die from the explosion and not the radiation
depression,fd87irx,t1_fd806t3,1578214802.0,Yeah. Especially since the past 2 weeks have been horrible to me and nobody is asking if im okay or anything they just dont care im just another person to everyone. I cant meet new people because of some shit and i just need some love that nobody is willing to give

depression,fd4opv7,t1_fd4m1ev,1578169479.0,Might check it out thanks
depression,fd4o23r,t1_fd4kmqo,1578169355.0,"Try to swich to any non inhaled form of weed because messing your lungs isnt something you want. Do some research, learn the basic anatomy of the muscles and the muscle groups, get a plan and when you wanna exercise, relearn the basics of nutrients (carbs fats and protein), switch to a healthy diet (which isnt bad, like a burger is healthy if you make it at home because then it isnt processed and filled with unwanted fat). Then start exercising and dont forget to eat properly its the most important part. Working out says 'yo brain make me grow' and then the brain lets it grow if you eat enough. Some fat will turn to muscle if you are losing fat. Otherwise you need to build skin too and gain some fat so you have a thin reserve of energy that is barely noticeable. For example i have like 10% fat and maybe 12-14% would do me good and the difference would be that my veins wont show when doing something hard / dealing with heat"
depression,fd4jcag,t1_fd4i7is,1578168016.0,I want to but im so alome that describing how i feel about life with 'hard' is an understatement. Is love such a rare thing?
depression,fd4hr2p,t1_fd4h20n,1578167572.0,I get it. The past 2 weeks have been miserable for me and yesterday i woke up feeling so horrible that i stayed in bed from waking up at 7 to getting up at like 11. Its the worst that you have to start the day feeling like nothing is okay
depression,fd4c91c,t1_fd4bw24,1578166322.0,I've been looking for music i might like even a little but im so fussy that its so hard. Been trying for like 3 years. + im so fucking tired from school being 45 hrs a week + studying + hw. This makes me too tired to do much even on weekends and holidays
depression,fd4b9h7,t1_fd4aupo,1578166026.0,"Theres too much material for one year this year so no chance of learning outside, we're stuck inside + its winter. I dont check the clock i just check my phone occasionally and convert the mins to seconds on my notebook"
depression,fd49kym,t1_fd47v9q,1578165616.0,I try to go through some classes 1 second at a time. Its so hard being alone and i dont want this. Once i became able to cry again i've been crying at least twice a day. Im starting to not be able to go to school once a week or 2. I dont know why im not suicidal but if i get to that point ill fucking walk to iceland for all i care i just dont want to be here
depression,fd4743g,t1_fd46b9s,1578164960.0,That will happen if i get placed in a good spot in the army with caring people. Its mandatory here and after that i'll go to uni if i dont drop out of school. Im only in grade 11 so i have 10 years according to my sense of time in reality i finish in june 20th 2021
depression,fd45vd5,t1_fd45ajb,1578164674.0,School is bullshit invented 200 years ago. Its just an aged piece of shit that refuses to decompose

depression,fd2pfra,t3_ejumrj,1578150440.0,Your father probably had a kid because he everybody has kids obviously. Fucks sake. He's a dumb cunt because he brought you into this world and doesnt care about you. You are his responsibility so fuck him. Once you move out i doubt if you should talk to him
depression,fd2p25c,t3_ejuokx,1578150324.0,"Im tired and i only read the title but whoever told you this, punch them in the face so hard you break their nose and tell them they cant complain from a nosebleed because theres people dying from stab wounds. Fuck this pisses me off"
depression,fd2ofl8,t3_ejw0h8,1578150101.0,You want to change your life to the extreme for the better but with depression its hard as fuck. In a way you want your current life to die and to live differently. Youre struggling to survive and everyone around you are living
depression,fd2neup,t3_ejwfuy,1578149708.0,"Tell her what you want her to know, as you mentioned that it isnt her fault ect. Make sure she understands that before you continue.

If you were a burden she'd leave because the weight would be too much. To prevent this, make sure to work toward getting better. Ever day. If you need meds or therapy get them because you need it. And if you sometimes dont want to then do it for her and for having her in your life. Everybody needs breaks but you *HAVE* to be diciplined not to take too much of a break.

Maybe i dont need to tell you but dont forget to go on dates, its important to show that you still are going to put the effort in even if you dont have that much effort to give. Kind of like the 'one guy gave her $10 and the other 100 but the second is rich and the first gave all he had' thing.

About feeling like a burden again, dont let your bad thoughts get between you. This is how insecurities fuck relationships. Fight the thoughts with facts. If you dont have facts use actions. I used to think i was ugly and i couldnt prove the thoughts wrong so i went to gym and i still do"
depression,fd2m1dd,t3_ejvkis,1578149144.0,"Do you sleep enough or does it happen regardless? I noticed that its guarenteed if i didnt sleep enough and it isnt otherwise.

I've been feeling this way throughout the entire day since school started this year, its such a horrible feeling"
