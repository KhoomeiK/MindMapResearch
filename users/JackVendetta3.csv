SteamVR,fdpvpx6,t1_fdpo1oz,1578642464.0,"I think each unlock is a hint to what the next Colossus is going to be or at least a new mechanic to use against the next Colossus. Should also add a New Game+ that lets them keep their items and see how fast they can beat the game like that. You could also add a stamina gauge, just like in SoTC"
SteamVR,fdorgvb,t3_emctbn,1578611240.0,"The weight to climbing would be a very cool feature, but difficult to get right. I would also suggest to use the sword or any kind of sharp weapon you're going to add, as a life saver for players for when they fall and can't reach, so they use the sword to stab into the colossus and are dragged to a stop so they won't fall all the way. Also, if you could implement a horizontal wall run or wall slide, that would be very interesting for platforming on a map or colossus. Further more, items would be a fun tool to use, such as rope, lighter, harpoon, etc, as means to help climbing, slow down a colossus to climb it or light bombs easier, meaning adding slots on the hip of the player. I would also recommend a calibration system so that the slots fit perfectly with any player height or arm length. Oh and also a Bow."
