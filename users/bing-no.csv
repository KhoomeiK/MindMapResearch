Rant: I‚Äôve been having to do OMAD a lot because of my schedule, which makes me pretty hungry throughout the day. I drink water to combat it but still... ugh.

HazbinHotel,fdro0nn,t1_fdrmc97,1578687245.0,"That is not what I said. Alastor is established as a powerful demon. If all it took to control him and prevent him from doing what he wants is one deal then he wouldn‚Äôt be so intriguing of a character. The pilot sets him up as a crafty character that the audience isn‚Äôt supposed to trust. We aren‚Äôt sure of his intentions besides what he says. But if he wanted to really ruin the hotel, he would need Charlie to trust him to some degree first. Charlie isn‚Äôt stupid, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that her seeing the good in everyone and putting faith in people may come back to hurt her. Of course this is all my opinion, the plot could go plenty of ways."
