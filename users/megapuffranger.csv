I kept to my routine though and after about a year they are barely noticeable. A few spots where they are still fairly red, but not something you’d see immediately. I think another year or two they will be completely unnoticeable. 

I did use moisturizer, I kept hydrated, I shortened my bulk periods as well. That probably all helped. But I think the thing that helped the most was I stopped caring.

todayilearned,fcs35lj,t1_fcqt57i,1577910780.0,"There is no widely accepted definition of assault weapon or mass shooting. So it’s up to different jurisdictions how they define a weapon or shooting. But normally only pistols capable of receiving large magazine clips would fall under assault weapons and are capable of rapid fire and combat use. But generally speaking only military style semiautomatic rifles capable of full automatic and receiving large magazines are considered assault weapons when talking about what should be banned.

Again, generally speaking, a shooting is considered a mass shooting if 4 or more people are shot, so normal gun violence (such as gang violence or robberies involving multiple people, or a shootout with the police) CAN fall under “mass shooting” which skews the statistics. This is by design... It creates tension and allows NRA and politicians to use the exact argument you are using to twist the argument that “libtards want to take all your guns”. This isn’t true, not much can be done about gun violence involving handguns or shotguns as those are not as problematic as certain legal semi-automatic rifles. 

Just for the record, we already had a ban on assault weapons and not only did it reduce gun violence but no one cares because the guns that were banned were not as widely available as they are today. After the ban expired, the gun companies flooded the market. So yes now a lot more guns would be removed, but they were previously illegal anyways and no one really complained because they still had their other guns."

todayilearned,fclv3w3,t1_fcltj80,1577757198.0,"No I don’t mean assault rifle, I mean assault weapons, federal law classifies any semiautomatic weapon designed for full automatic with a removable clip as an “assault weapon” or a “military-style” weapon designed for combat.  This includes rifles, pistols, and shotguns. 

Gun violence generally doesn’t involve any assault weapons, however mass shootings do. There isn’t an exact number since different states have different classifications but the number has gone up since 2004. In 2014 11 out of 15 mass shootings involved weapons that would have fallen under the assault weapon ban prior to 2004. 

Also I stated in my comment that “assault weapons bans” is a different problem than “gun bans”. There is a difference, civilians shouldn’t have access to military grade weaponry.

television,fc11580,t3_efgehx,1577305282.0,"Honestly I think the biggest issue with the show was pacing. It felt like it was jumping around a lot, some plots got a large amount of time while others, that felt equally important, got barely any time to develop. Also the timelines being skewed didn’t help, it made it hard to process what was happening because you are too busy trying to wonder how much time had passed in relation to the other stories. 

Dialogue was a bit lacking too, a serious problem I have with shows nowadays is how they all have these “clever” one-liners that they rapid fire at each other as if that is a natural conversation. It isn’t. That isn’t how conversation works, it’s not a battle of wits, it’s a conversation. A lot of shows have this now and it doesn’t work. There was a lot of good humor though that made me genuinely chuckle which is rare for me, so that was a good surprise.

Another issue I had was my lack of Witcher knowledge and their lack of explanation on things I felt should have been explained just a tad more. Not everyone has read the books or played the games, it would have been nice to understand the world a bit more. I felt like Game of Thrones (sorry for the comparison, I know it bothers people) did a great job of explaining the world through natural dialogue. They did it so well, I wanted to read the books to learn even more. I didn’t get that from The Witcher, it was just “oh another thing I know nothing about, ok...”

However I think it’s a solid 7 maybe an 8 out of 10. Cavill did a wonderful job, I didn’t think he looked right for the part but boy did he change my mind. The sword fight choreography was some of the best I’ve seen in a series. It wasn’t over the top like most shows make it, it was quick and precise and looked very natural. You could believe he was faster and stronger and he knew how to use it.  I am looking forward to a second season because I believe some of my issues will be cleared up purely by the fact the stories all converge now."
