She's not completely wrong because of too much moisture down there back there you can get more fungal and yeast infections and this could prevent it.   Women sometimes put tp down there to absorb moisture.  Back there may work too.

relationship_advice,ffeg8g6,t1_ffe8p1a,1579846808.0,"No, the fact that you quickly unliked the photo with you not wanting him to know you were there is kind of the (technical)  definition of stalking, BUT the fact that he called you out on it shows he's an asshole, and saying, ""**Anyway**… I hope it’s not awkward that I’m dating someone who is **sweeter and hotter than you**. Hope you’re well! <3"" shows you he's a condescending, narcissistic prick.  Cattie too.  Are ya'll still in high school or college maybe because this is not normal behavior for a guy or should I say a man.  But then you asking if you should reach out to him to say your sorry when he just shamed you and put you down in front of every one on his feed?  You may want to talk to someone about all of this because you wanting to apologize to HIM after he was a HUGE DICK to you is not right.  This guy is toxic.

Are you sure you have feelings for her?  And , yes, you over reacted.  They are her kids not yours.

I have to add that if you noped me like you say you did without even asking any follow up questions I would think you were too immature to date someone with kids, maybe even someone without kids.  She might not want you back, but you might also want to look at why you scare so easily over something irrelevant at this early stage of your relationship."

I ask because with having one American and one Scandinavian parent I realized their hygiene habits are different although not to your gf's extreme.  I also knew a Persian girl who believed the oils and musk one her we're good so she didn't bathe very often or wear deodorant, but I know nothing of her underwear situation.
If you like this girl and don't want to hurt her feelings you can start either subtly or semi directly. Subtly you can start with things like replacing her underwear with a clean pair while she was in the shower and see if that sparks an opening to discuss this like asking her why she does it or compare it to what you do or buy her a perfume you like or a new soap or you can have sexy shower time before bed starting once or twice a week on days she hasn't showered and do it as many times as is necessary.  Semi directly you could say you want you both to wash all of the outside world off of you before bed and just insist that you not go to bed dirty. Another thing to consider is she may have gone nose blind and not be aware of this, but also as a last point be aware that this could also be a sign of mental illness, so proceed with caution."

I have been really scared to ramp this up, more so now since I have read what some people have written about what's going on.  I think Etsy is a good place to sell art, but be aware of your numbers, your cost, your time and the three Etsy fees, so you don't lose money starting out.  Understand shipping cost too and add a cushion there if you can or roll it over into your price since they really want you to do free shipping.  With all of that said I think it is worth it.

# 6 ways to get help with prescription costs

You may find it necessary to get help paying for prescriptions even after enrolling in [Medicare prescription drug coverage (Part D)](https://www.medicare.gov/drug-coverage-part-d/costs-for-medicare-drug-coverage/costs-in-the-coverage-gap/6-ways-to-get-help-with-prescription-costs#). For example, you may reach the annual spending limit and enter what is called the coverage gap. Here are 6 tips to consider if you think you might need to get help with the costs of prescription drug coverage.

**1. Consider switching to generics or other lower-cost drugs.**

There may be generic or less-expensive brand-name drugs that would work just as well as the ones you're taking now. Talk to your doctor to find out if these are an option for you. You might also be able to lower prescription costs by using mail-order pharmacies.

**2. Choose a Medicare drug plan that offers additional coverage during the gap.**

There are plans that offer additional coverage during the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap, like for generic drugs. However, plans with additional gap coverage to help pay for prescriptions may charge a higher monthly [premium](https://www.medicare.gov/drug-coverage-part-d/costs-for-medicare-drug-coverage/costs-in-the-coverage-gap/6-ways-to-get-help-with-prescription-costs#).

Check with the drug plan first to see if your drugs would be covered during the gap. [Find health & drug plans](https://www.medicare.gov/plan-compare/).

**3. Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs.** 

Some pharmaceutical companies offer programs to help pay for medications for people enrolled in Medicare prescription drug coverage (Part D). Find out whether there’s a [Pharmaceutical Assistance Program](https://www.medicare.gov/pharmaceutical-assistance-program/Index.aspx) that can lower prescription costs for the drugs you take.

**4. State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs.**

Many states and the U.S. Virgin Islands offer help paying for prescriptions, drug plan premium,s and/or other drug costs. Find out if your state has a [State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program](https://www.medicare.gov/pharmaceutical-assistance-program/state-programs.aspx).

**5.** [Apply for Extra Help](https://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/get-help-paying-costs/lower-prescription-costs).

Medicare and Social Security have a program called Extra Help—a way for people with limited income and resources to get help with prescription costs. If you qualify for Extra Help, you could pay no more than:

* $3.60 for each generic covered drug
* $8.95 for each brand-name covered drug

**6. Explore national and community-based charitable programs like these that help pay for medications:**  

* [National Patient Advocate Foundation](http://www.npaf.org/)
* [National Organization for Rare Disorders](http://www.rarediseases.org/)
* [Benefits checkup](http://www.benefitscheckup.org/)"

Maybe this isn't corruption but mismanagement  When I was working for a nonprofit agency I found out that the Salvation Army's Landfill Budget is 150k a month.  So instead of having people work harder and them sell more things for less money to turn the floors more often to get all of the donations to the floor they were working at whatever pace they want and selling things at higher prices and whatever they couldn't get to they sending to landfills - nice stuff, I was told by the guys who work there filling up landfills every month year after year.  Not sure how many pounds that is, but that shouldn't be happening.  If it's too much for them HIRE real workers not just depend on the guys getting treatment there to do it or pass it on to another charity and let them sell it and they keep the money.  They are steadily asking for money while burying money in landfills.  I don't get it.

Secondly, and best of all is the Houston Medical Center.  That land was donated by an affluent family my friend worked and was supposed to be for nonprofit hospitals.  That's the way the charter was written and there are so many lawsuits going on all of the time about this, but it was supposed to be free or low cost to people, but this has been going on for years.  If Texas seceded and this got cleared up I bet we would have free health care not sure what that would do to everybody else though."
