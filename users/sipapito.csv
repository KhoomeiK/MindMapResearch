Anxiety,ffa4dkp,t3_esi8kv,1579727646.0,"I would like to read about symptoms and specific types of anxiety! With my anxiety and depression, one helpful thing my therapist does (and has done more than once for me) is to reassure me that my symptoms are those of anxiety and depression. I often feel ""oh it's not bad enough"" and that puts me in this ""I don't know how to work on it if I don't know what it is"" so being affirmed and understanding that it can feel different for everyone is something I like reading about!

Maybe an article about naming symptoms you feel and specific ways to address those symptoms. I know there's articles like that out there, but I for one always read several and some are more effective for me! Graphics are always great too ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

EDAnonymous,fee17sv,t3_eonpnh,1579024265.0,"I eat grilled chicken and cucumbers! It satisfies me for a while cause the protein and the cucumbers are refreshing. I usually eat them last because they kind of top it off and don't leave a taste so I don't really think about food after. Occasionally I'll bring boiled potatoes too if I'm feeling like that might not do the trick. 
Also easy to make and prep for the week!"

Journaling,fcrw2z2,t3_eilk90,1577907412.0,"I have my bullet journal and diary in one! I mark the sides of my spreads with washi tape or those like, sticky folder tabs that you can write on and I also lable them in my index. My notebook has bookmarks too so I'll leave one in the beginning spreads and one on the next new page and I journal my thoughts and feelings in there everyday along with all my planning. I thought it would be too much but I really like having my worlds combined! It does make the notebook go through quicker however."
bulletjournal,fc6nl69,t3_eghpsa,1577484849.0,Ahh this is so cute!!!
bulletjournal,fc62bbj,t3_egcqc4,1577470669.0,I'm in the same boat! I have half left in my current journal and I already got a new one for when I finish this one but I really want to start the new year in a new journal. I am currently planning out my goals and things I want to include in 2020 in my old journal so I'm just kind of seeing how it feels in there and I'll decide in a day or two if I'm feeling like staying or setting up the new one. But writing out ideas and goals is getting me excited for the new year and I'm not minding how it feels. I also think I'll enjoy finishing out this journal soon!
