IllegalLifeProTips,fdigaww,t3_elhnsb,1578442248.0,One I heard during the Vietnam war years: Get three or more people together who are looking for an out. In front of a witness plan to kill a bald eagle or any other animal on the federal protected list. Do not actually kill anything. Conspiracy to commit a federal offense is what you're after. Have the witness report your conspiracy to the FBI. Plead guilty. A prior conviction of a federal crime will keep you out of the military. Being convicted by 12 of your peers is better than being carried by six of them.

abusiveparents,fao1fq3,t3_ea11l0,1576255354.0,Alcoholism is an insidious family disease that impacts not only the alcoholic but also the family and friends of the alcoholic. Dealing with this by yourself can destroy you. Google Al anon/ Ala teen to find meetings in your area. You do not have to go through this alone.  These organizations are free and anonymous.
