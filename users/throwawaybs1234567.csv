I also let my boundaries be violated too easily and don't truly stand up when someone violates them.  It's a character flaw and I need to work on it.  That's what therapy is for, I guess."

SurvivingMyInfidelity,fesaimc,t1_fes5m93,1579363248.0,"You need to understand that all of that is under your control.  They only one judging you and saying you don't deserve kindness from anyone is *you.*  Sure, people may say similar things or you may feel rejection from others.

But, when it comes to self-improvement and self-reflection, the most important thing to consider and hold onto is that *you* are in control of *you.*  

Every thought you have, every decision you make, everything is controlled by you.  There are external factors beyond your control, and those may contribute to whatever you're feeling.  At the same time, you are in control of how you choose to react to those external factors.

Basically, what I'm saying is don't become addicted to self-hate and being sad.  If you wake up everyday and beat yourself up and hate who you are then you will *never* grow up and move on past your bad decisions or mistakes.

It's ugly and it requires a lot of uncomfortable conversations with yourself.  If you have friends whom you trust then they can help too.  But if you're alone it is still possible.

Don't be hard on yourself.  Loving yourself is the first step in learning to love others.  It sounds stupid, but it's part of it.  Just avoid selfishness or narcissism, and you should be fine.

TL;DR:  You have to love yourself.  Even if you're a huge fuck up, because there is no other way to move on in this world than to be OK with who you are and the mistakes you've made in the past.  

Relax, find good people to be around, grow, change, and fight for the right to be alive.  Time will guide the way."
SurvivingMyInfidelity,fer3jp9,t3_eqdnnq,1579349379.0,"Hey, I'm not a therapist and I'm only about a month post-breakup so I can't speak completely to your situation, but I can provide some advice.

I think acknowledging the shame, the unhealthy aspects of your old relationship, and the feelings you are having are all good.  You're still healing and dating is just going to feel weird for a while.  I think the more you date, the more you will start to feel better and gain more confidence.

The biggest thing I've had to learn is to go easy on myself.  I beat myself up for days upon days after my breakup.  It was only recently that I realized that's not really productive.  It's ok to feel shame and regret.  I will always regret what happened, but at a certain point you have to put it behind you.  Always regret the cheating, but never forget the lesson you learned, in other words.  

Don't let it define who you are as you move forward into your new life.  You may feel stuck, but I think you're making progress.  You're just going to hit a few speed bumps on the way, and that's fine.

Try to have fun and be kind to yourself.  That's part of being nice and kind to others.  Take things easy, and keep your expectations in line with your reality.  In a way, that may help you feel ""worthy"" again.

Good luck, my friend."

survivinginfidelity,feowdim,t1_feovmbe,1579306832.0,"I appreciate it, but I'm just trying to be as positive as I can be.  Being pulled into a bunch of internet arguments probably isn't the best way to do that.

I'm just trying to avoid creating anymore pain.  I'm not perfect, but I try to be honest as I can be.  I could have lied to my ex, and everything would be great.  I could have borne the shame and self-hate, but I know it would have killed me on the inside.  I told her the truth, when I could have lied. 

And for that, my ex has stressed that she doesn't hate me.  She still cares for me, because she's not a psychopath.  She understands it was a mistake, but that doesn't excuse it and she doesn't want to compromise her standards.  She's a good friend and a good woman.  I won't let that kindness go to waste.

It just gets rough going through this process alone.  I'll be alright though.  This is not the only place to get help in this wide world.

I think the point I wanted to hit was the importance of responsibility for the decision of cheating.  As in it's important for the cheater to take responsibility for their decision in order to facilitate their own personal growth.

You decide to not bring a jacket out on a cold night, for example.  Bad decision.  You think to yourself ""Damn, I made a mistake.""

Honestly, we can play the semantics game all day.  Arguing over what consitutes a mistake/accident, or whatever.

All I know from my cheating is that I didn't enter into an emotional affair or flirt with this person for months.  I got drunk and put myself in the wrong situation with the wrong person.  It's absolutely my fault, and I still consider it a mistake.

If we define cheating as a choice/decision then it's definitely a bad one.  Therefore I consider it a mistake.  An accidental break in my established boundaries and value system.  It's not a choice I intended to make, it was an impulsive, drunk, stupid decision.  

I will never defend the act itself; I will always be ashamed of it, but I won't let my life going forward be defined by it.  My ex is doing the same thing.

To quote my ex: ""I don't hate you.  You just fucked up.""

It was a mistake, plain and simple.  My ex and I are still friends.  There's no hate or bad blood, just a separation now.  

I don't mean to seem defensive, and I totally understand your position and it's fine to feel however you want to about it."
survivinginfidelity,fen5rzm,t1_femzsvr,1579277593.0,"As someone who cheated it was definitely a ""mistake.""  As in something I didn't truly want to happen, or at least something I wasn't planning on doing.  A car accident can also be a mistake, but that doesn't mean no one is at fault.  

It's taking **responsibility** for your mistakes that matters.  And sometimes that means the cheater just has to move on and try to be better, and the betrayed person needs to as well.  

Life is full of mistakes, its how we deal with them that matters.

Edit:  I realize this is the wrong place for this discussion.  I was trying to provide a different perspective, but I realize I'm doing more harm than good.  I'm sorry if this triggered anyone or caused any more trauma."
SurvivingMyInfidelity,fen4xxj,t1_femzyys,1579277061.0,"Yeah I agree, I guess a better way to put it is that I'm rebuilding my dignity back to what it was before all of this happened.

This wasn't something I planned, I remember being on my couch deciding if I should go out with friends that night.  My ex encouraged me to go out, and I just got way too fucked up.  I destroyed my dignity after that, and then I hurt my ex.

We're fighting out own battles now.  She wants to handle things on her own, despite how I may want to help her, I simply can't.  She's tough, she has friends and support.  I don't have too much of that.  I just moved here and I lost most of my friends in the breakup.  That's no ones fault, but mine.

I'm taking the time I need and constantly trying to stay focused on what put me in this situation.  I'm addressing all of the unchallenged issues, from my old relationship to how I spend my time alone. 

I'm making progress and growing, but some days I feel ashamed for being better.  As if I have no right to be ok, or grow and prosper.  It's self-hate, but I recognize it and I do my best to remove it.

I will always use this place as a dumping ground for the worst parts of me, so that when I go into the real world I can feel more focused on what I need to do."
survivinginfidelity,femv3k5,t3_eq01ct,1579270404.0,"Yeah it's definitely a deflection of responsibility.

I had the same mindset when I cheated on my ex.  It was a drunken mistake, so it felt ""accidental.""  But the more perspective I gained, the more I understood that mistake, accident, whatever it was still **my responsibility.**  If you get into a car drunk and crash, it's an ""accident,"" but it's one you are still responsible for. 

I realized how I acted afterward was what mattered.  I'm in therapy.  I'm rethinking my views on sex and relationships.  I'm giving my ex the space she needs.

Don't ever fall for the type of bullshit deflection in that post.  This person is seeking validation or forgiveness.  What they really need is to take responsibility for their accident and move on.  They don't want to do that, so they want the instant gratification of taking the weight of the shame off of their backs.

I would literally be there for about 30 minutes, post a story or whatever and then go home and lie down on my couch and cry.

SurvivingMyInfidelity,fegl1jj,t3_ep0wuj,1579096071.0,"I haven't exactly reconciled.  But, I put the AP in my rearview mirror and kept on moving.  Trying to get closure from them may just cause more pain.

My AP is in one of my classes.  I thought about taking her aside and talking with her, but really what's the point?  She won't tell me anything I don't already know.  

We weren't in an emotional affair, however.  Simply a drunken hookup that went to far.  I told my ex, but AP's boyfriend is clueless.  That was all the closure I needed to know what kind of person she was.

I don't know your situation, but if you really want to reconcile you need to throw the AP away.  They helped you hurt someone you loved.  They are only going to open that old wound.  Also if you care about your BS then you should not give two fucks about the AP, honestly.  Engage No Contact mode:  block them, delete their number, just get away from them.

That sounds harsh, but it's a choice you need to make.  You can't have your cake and eat it too.  If you're truly remorseful to your BS you will make the sacrifices necessary.  Reconciliation is a process, not a goal.  It requires honesty, sacrifice, and a whole lot of uncomfortable conversations.

selfimprovement,fed9nwf,t3_eokf9y,1579004854.0,"I'm in the same boat, but a few more months away.  I'm a man, so turning 30 is definitely a scary moment for me.

I've been changing my perspective since the New Year.  I just got out of a serious relationship that I screwed up because I wasn't dealing with my problems.  It all happened before the holidays, so I've been really focusing on the issues from my 20s that I don't deal with.

I think it's the age where you really have to decide what you're going to keep.  As in what hobbies are *really* important to you.  I recently realized I don't enjoy playing video games anymore.  I was holding on to the notion that I like them, because I used to love playing games in my 20s.

Now that I'm 29, I realized I like going to the gym and going to breweries and wineries over sitting inside playing video games.  I don't have anyone to play games with either, and my schedule just doesn't fit that time commitment.  So that hobby has to go, for now.

I'm also being more considerate of what I put in my body.  I used to be able to eat at BK and Wendy's for lunch and still crush a workout, but now I feel it in my stomach.  I try to eat more ""real"" food and turn cooking into a hobby.

Also, I try to have fun with the little things.  I partied through my mid-20s and drank and did drugs in excess.  I don't regret it, but I just can't pretend I can do that anymore.  I have 2 glasses of red wine and I start to fall asleep on my couch, for example.

So, now I just try to enjoy the company of the people in my life.  I've watched a lot of friends come and go, relationships rise and fall, and I know nothing is permanent.  I used to feel a pressure to perform, so people would like and validate me.  Now I'm just happy to have a nice conversation or go to a baseball game (even though I hate sports).  It's more about the vibe and atmosphere now.  

Like I said, I recently got out of a serious relationship, so I'm also ""working on me.""  I'm looking to 35 as the age where I should really be able to look back and be proud of what I've accomplished.

Sorry this turned into a ramble.

TL;DR:

No idea what you can accomplish in 9 weeks, but use this time to evaluate where you stand in life.  What do you want?  If you don't know, how do you find out?  What are you forcing yourself to enjoy?  What do you like about yourself?  What do you not like?

But, it's great that you both could be friends.  That's huge.  You think you are incapable of faithful love, but I believe you are.  

It's simply about building your boundaries, respecting them, making sure others respect them, and limiting the opportunities for putting yourself in those situations.  

I realized I can't get drunk around people I don't know, for example.  If I had friends with me that night, people would have stopped me or seen what was going to happen.

It literally effects you physically.  It seems so simple, or like something you wouldn't really notice, but it can be huge.

Stephen King has an anecdote where he talks about his first ""real"" writing desk.  He set up a massive desk in a room in his house.  He made it all about writing, and he kept his family out.  He thought that was what a serious writer is supposed to do.

He wrote great books there, but it also became the place where he would snort cocaine, drink in excess, and hide from his family.  His personal life suffered tremendously in that room. 

After he hit rehab, he rearranged his writing room.  He opened the door, put a new desk in the middle of the room and put comfortable areas in the room for his children to play in.

Now, when he writes he sees an open door, children playing, etc.  His life and work feel in harmony.  

It's still the same room, but he changed things here and there and it became a new place for a new life.

I don't know you or your life, but you sound like me a few years ago.  I had to do a lot of self-introspection for years.  

The most important thing I learned is sometimes you need your own space.  You may be wanting to keep her in your life, because you're scared of dealing with these issues.

You are the only one who can ""fix"" you.  It doesn't mean you have to bear all the weight, but it is *your* responsibility.  No one else can make those decisions for you.

Tread carefully.  If you convince someone you love them and they take you back, but the relationship falls apart 6 months later then they will be gone forever.

It's like a ghost.  But, don't let it make you afraid to go outside.  There's no sign from the universe.  The universe cares little for anything, especially anyones breakup.

This is a natural feeling, but it's one *you* have to break.  I did it because I realized I was addicted to that feeling of being sad and missing someone.  It was all I had to remind me of them.

It's honestly a question of self-control.  Immediately after the break up, I was constantly checking her social media.  It was like getting a ""hit"" of her, like a drug.

You're going through withdrawals, basically.  You need to think of it as respecting your own space.  Give yourself time to heal.  It's a compulstion, and most compulsions aren't healthy.

Remove the temptation.  Delete the apps.  Or before you check social media, get up and do something you've been meaning to do.  Send an email.  Read a chapter of a book.  Study.  Go for a walk.

Trust me I am concerned with how they feel, and I'm doing my best to make myself better.

I've been in my own bubble though, as I had to drop off the grid for a bit to respect my ex's desire for space.

I've met up with some friends since the break up.  They've been really supportive and show that I was projecting a lot of my own self-hate through them.  They honestly wanted me to be ok and take care of myself.

So, I've projected alot of my thoughts through this account in order to get that perspective.  It keeps me from reaching out to my ex and our friends and annoying them with my self-improvement journey.  It seems selfish, but it's what I need to do in order to gain perspective.  

My ex and I are going to sit down in a few weeks and have a talk.  I'm trying to make sure I get to that point having cleared out all my selfish bullshit.

All I really want for my ex is for her to be happy.  If I can't make her happy then I'll have be able to move on.  This won't define my life, and it won't define hers.

Since I posted this I've already realized a lot of the bullshit that was clouding my vision.  I was caught in a fog of self-pity and self-hate.  Luckily, I contained it on this account and my own journaling.  Keeping it away from my ex and others is very important to me.  I don't want to drag them into the pit I fell into.

AskMen,fdqpqze,t3_emn6ir,1578672235.0,"Dated her for about a year and a half.  

Started off long distance and then I moved to her city for grad school.  It was going well, but we were both still caught up in the honeymoon phase.  We didn't communicate our feelings and emotions well.  We were both introverts, but she had a consolidated friend group from being in the city for over 5 years.

I felt isolated.  I felt like an impostor.  I started to think I wasn't good enough for her.

During finals after my first semester,  I was a ball of stress, anxiety, self-hate, and depression.  I went out with some friends from school and I ended up getting wasted and letting my boundaries fall.  I cheated with a girl who was out drinking with me and some friends.  It didn't last long, I immediately felt ashamed and disgusting.  Part of me thinks I did it because I thought I wanted out, and this was the cowards way out.  I always thought I was one of those people who would ***never*** cheat.  But, I did.

I told my girlfriend.  She left, but she said she didn't hate me.  I'm still her friend, but I failed to support her and keep my shit together.  I climbed my way out of that pit, and I'm working to make sure I'm not defined by this immature mistake.

In a way, it was a case of right person, right place, but wrong time and wrong mindset.

I'm working on being better.  There's no guarantee of starting over, but we are still friends.  She is a good person, and despite my mistakes, she still believes in me.

I'll be the person she saw me as, even if I'm never in her life again."

I'm a month out from my break up and I really want to reconcile, but I know my emotions are still way out of rhythm with what my ex is going through.  It takes a long time, and there's no set roadmap or timeline.

It was definitely a one time thing.  I was stressed, anxious, depressed, etc. from the big move and starting Grad school.  After about 5 months,  I got really drunk one night right before finals were going to start with some other studients; another classmate was into me, she hit on me and she triggered a need for sexual validation, I guess.

I immediately told my ex.  I felt remorse, shame, disgust, I had no idea who I was anymore.  I always thought I would never cheat.  I removed the AP from my life as much as I could, dropped a few classes, changed up my schedule, and blocked her.

It wasn't a sustained, emotional affair, or a planned encounter.  It just happened, and I fucked up.

I'm doing that not to get my ex ""back,"" but to improve myself and build up barriers to avoid these decisions again.

As for ""knowing for a fact,"" that's just part of being in a relationship anyway.  Your ex and you would have to start over *completely.* Building trust, respect, intimacy, etc. from the ground up.  You'll both have to be openly communicating your thoughts and emotions.  It's a long, shitty process, so only do it if it's worth it to you. (check /r/AsOneAfterInfidelity for some examples)

There's no way to know anything in a relationship for a fact.  It's always a risk.  

If you enter into another relationship there's no way you'll no for a fact the new person won't cheat on you and lie to you.  Or they may push you away and you cheat on them, whether emotionally or physically.

It's all a gamble.

I'm not saying take your ex back.  It honestly sounds like she needs to work more on herself before she can be in a relationship again.

I can't tell you what to do with your relationship, because I'm not you.  But, I guess just make sure your ex is getting the help she needs.  My ex helped me get to where I am and it gave me the tools to pull myself out of that pit.

SurvivingMyInfidelity,fdo1na7,t3_emab98,1578597237.0,"Not currently in reconciliation, so take this all with a grain of salt.

My AP is in my grad school program.  I switched my class schedule around, blocked her number, and unfollowed on social media.  

My ex's big problem (besides the cheating of course) was knowing that she could never come to events with my program without thinking about the AP being there.  Also, the fact that the AP will still be around me in some capacity.

She couldn't cope with that.  I made those changes without her input in order to support any possibility of reconcilation, and reestablish my own boundaries that I let be violated.

If you're not setting up boundaries concerning the situation and openly communicating your feelings and talking about them then it's going to be weird.  

The WS should be communicating any and all interactions with the AP, and ensuring their boundaries are respected.  BS should communicate their feelings and fears concerning the continued presence of the AP in the work place.

Establishing a game plan moving forward may also be essential.  I.E. working toward moving to a new job/department, or discussing the issue with human resources or a supervisor.

Openness, communication, and support are essential in coping with this, but only if both partners want the relationship to survive."
Infidelity,fdnm0f5,t1_fdnbqot,1578588595.0,"I was one of those people who said ""I'd never cheat no matter what.""

You just never know how you'll react to certain situations. So I would say don't judge it that way.  It's an irrational decision fed through a lot of different sources: depression, insecurity, etc.
Combine all that with the situation and people youre around in that state, and it's a recipe for disaster. 

I still love my ex, I loved her when I cheated. It wasn't that it didn't matter. It's that I couldn't see clearly the consequences and the cost.

Not remembering makes it worse, because you feel disconnected from yourself. I couldn't sleep for days and I constantly asked myself ""Why?"" 

I had said before "" I'd never cheat.""  You just never now what kind of things will get thrown at you and make you stumble or fall.

Keep your boundaries up, but just understand your girlfriend needs to heal too.

She doesn't want her life defined by this, and neither should you.

It's tough.  Good luck."
Infidelity,fdn0jvx,t3_em38yb,1578573507.0,"I'm one of those people.  It's a tough call, because I really did feel like I was out of control.  But, that's still not an excuse.

I've learned that I put myself in that situation.  The AP may have triggered and initiated my response, but I had allowed myself to get drunk with people I didn't know that well, and I let my boundaries fall apart.

I thought I was one of those people who could resist temptation, apparently I need to work on that.

It may be different from a woman's experience, but as a man I know that this was entirely my fault.  If your ex can at least admit that maybe she's in the right mindset, but she cannot lay all the blame on alcohol.

I wanted to do that, but that would just hide the other catalysts behind what drove me to this point.

I love my ex, but she can't be with me right now.  All I can hope is that we can be friends again, because she is a great person.

She needs to understand that, yes, she fucked up, but that doesn't mean her remorse can undo the actions or your feelings since it all went down.

If she's begging or pleading, then she's not fully through her process, in my opinion (not a therapist, so take that with a grain of salt).  But, be gentle with her.  I was in a really bad place when all of this happened, and my ex was upset but she stressed that she didn't hate me for the mistake.  She just couldn't be with me.

I simply want my ex to be happy and have a happy life.  Your ex should want the same.

You didn't start dating through begging and pleading after a mistake, so it's hard to start over when the balance of the relationship is thrown off.

Stay the course, but understand if your ex is truly remorseful then this hurting is normal.  She want's you back, but you need to make sure she's making herself better

She needs to show you that she can be responsible again (assuming that it was a drunken mistake).

Good luck, it's a tough choice.  I know I would want my ex to give me a second chance.  It's not my choice though, it's hers.

I cheated with someone in my Grad program.  We were going to be in a class together this coming semester, but I moved my whole schedule around to avoid them.  

I can understand not wanting to do the class over again, but she could have at least talked to the professor and asked to switch partners.  

Colleges are very accommodating for those type of things.  There's plenty of other people in the class she could do schoolwork with.  She's probably afraid of having to set up boundaries in the class that will make her feel alienated for her mistake.

But she should feel alienated; that's the whole point of the sacrifices you make during reconciliation.

I don't want my cheating to cause any more damage then it did.  We're both almost 30 and don't have the energy to waste thinking that way.

He probably does regret what he did, but would you take him back right now?  He probably used that regret and shame to get a new perspective and make himself better. 

I regret what I did; I **always** will.  But, I won't let it define me and I know my ex wants me to be ok and be happy, the same way I want her to.

It's never easy, the universe doesn't reward that way.

It's not healthy to obsess this way, but it's natural.  I would say just don't let it become a habit.

Comparison is the thief of joy.

You've worked on yourself; be proud of that and tell this dude to fuck off."
SurvivingMyInfidelity,fdgat5c,t1_fdfhdh3,1578387633.0,Thanks you too.
BreakUps,fdewo72,t1_fdewgbn,1578348161.0,"I made a post about it just now: https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivingMyInfidelity/comments/el146y/just_hit_50_pages/

Also, yeah sometimes working out is good.  I'm a pretty avid gym goer so I noticed it wasn't having the same effect with the pressure of the breakup. 

So I changed up my goals and took a look at where I was failing.

Keep at it man."
SurvivingMyInfidelity,fdeslm2,t3_ekzdnb,1578345743.0,"I know from my perspective that I say this too myself all the time, because it's just an easy umbrella statement that can kind of sum up all of the feelings I have about myself.

Sometimes, I'll just walk around my apartment and think ""I'm a fucking idiot.""

I never thought I would be in this position, so saying things like that, I think are, just part of the process.

But, I went to therapy to address the self-hate stuff.  I recommend it."
BreakUps,fderdyq,t1_fdeqsy0,1578345023.0,"Bro, you'll feel like you're going crazy.  I walked like 14 miles one day, because I was so fed up with feeling guilt or shame.  I just walked and then passed out on my couch after.  But, I felt clear.

I talked to myself, I journaled, I went to therapy, etc.  All of it is good.  I'm almost 30, but I wished I'd done this so much earlier.

Good luck, keep your head up, stay strong."
AsOneAfterInfidelity,fder7fm,t1_fdepqp8,1578344915.0,"Thanks for the advice.

As far as I know my ex wants to move on her own way, but I'm trying to make sure if we ever come back together I'm prepared.

It's honestly giving me a lot of perspective on what a relationship should be like, and how I failed in this last one.

Thanks for the response.  I hope your own process isn't too painful and you're finding joy in the little things.  I hope to be in reconciliation at some point, but it's a process not a goal."
BreakUps,fdenpva,t3_ekzbs0,1578342867.0,"This sucks man, I'm sorry you had to go through that.  

The good thing is you're writing it all out and acknowledging these feelings.

But, **do not** be defined by this.  You sound young, and you've come out of a huge relationship in your mind.  But it's time for you to worry about yourself.

Fuck those people, they obviously don't care about you.  Real friends don't act that way.  You need to find better people.  I don't know the whole context, but that's my hot take. 

Check out /r/selfimprovement or /r/DecidingToBeBetter and all the related subreddits.  Reach out to people, don't be afraid to go to therapy or support groups.  Tell your story to someone.  Even if they don't care, it's better than silence.

It's time to focus on **you**.  You are in control of your life, your happiness, your feelings.

This is natural, you will be ok.  I believe in you.

Godspeed my friend.  This will pass.  Time is your enemy, but it also your friend."
BreakUps,fdem5bq,t1_fddyy3j,1578341942.0,"You too my friend.

I'll never regret meeting my ex.  I'll always regret how things ended, but as long as we can both be happy life should go on."
AsOneAfterInfidelity,fdeg4dh,t3_ekwgoo,1578338283.0,"Wayward here.

How do you think the process is going?  Is there anything you wish could be improved?

Honestly, just asking for perspective.  Reconciliation is still up in the air for me, and I want to make sure I have every perspective I can."
BreakUps,fddwjrv,t3_ekuw9z,1578325720.0,"I like this take.

This is a much more nuanced outlook than a lot of the pseudo-advice that gets put out here. 

This shows why it's so good to take your time and work on things like no contact and self-improvement.

You just don't know if you all will come back together.  Or if one side can get over the other transgressions.

But, if you give it time and trust the process their is hope for either reconciliation or a healthy dose of moving on with your life.

Thanks for this, it's exactly what I needed."
SurvivingMyInfidelity,fdc1buj,t1_fdbz88r,1578265182.0,You too my dude.  Godspeed.
SurvivingMyInfidelity,fdbv9og,t1_fdbsgdd,1578262503.0,"Yeah I'm passed all that.  This place and all the other breakup type subreddits get the worst of it.

Sometimes, I just want to throw myself away, but I know I can rise above my own bullshit and build a life people will be proud of.

Thanks for your concern.  This is a bad place to be sometimes, but it has helped immensely."
SurvivingMyInfidelity,fdbrnll,t1_fdbrauv,1578260968.0,"Yeah I'm beginning to see that too about the drinking.

It's weird, but that's how me and my ex met.  I got hammered at a friend's party, she was hammered and we had some fun drunk sex.  But, then I fell for her and we started helping each other and growing together.  

I thought that part of me was gone, but I put myself into a situation to react the same way.  

I'm almost 30 so I don't drink too much anyway.  I stay sober a majority of the time, but when I drink liquor it's like a demon wakes up inside of me.

Thanks man, like I said this shit doesn't define me.  I hope you're finding happiness in your life wherever you can."
SurvivingMyInfidelity,fdbpuq4,t1_fdbp7gu,1578260039.0,"Thanks, for this.  The only solace is that I activated No Contact and kept all the begging and pleading to the unsent letters I write in a Word document.

I know this 100% my fault.  But the girl I cheated with has been doing the repeatedly apparently.  I had a quick talk with her before I blocked her out too.  She's cheated on her boyfriend 5 times.  She goes out, gets wasted and looks for the same type of validation.  

In a way, she's like me, or someone I could have become. But she feels no regret for her actions.  I do.

And yeah, my ex has already said she wishes me the best, and she worries about me.

She is a kind, strong woman and I treated her horribly and hurt her.  That ends now, and I'll do my best to repay that kindness.

Thanks for the support.

I'm sorry we all ended up here."
SurvivingMyInfidelity,fdbp70o,t1_fdah34t,1578259708.0,"I get where you're coming from, but I honestly use this place as a vent for me, and to get perspective on my situation.

I'm trying to make sure I'm ok and I'm taking the right steps to ensure my ex is happy.  

I failed her in a lot of ways, but she has good friends around her.  I immediately told her what happened.  I mean like 3 hours later.  I didn't once think about lying or covering it up.

I'm not that man.  I know who I am and I won't let myself be defined by this stupid betrayal.  

My ex is a strong woman.  I'm proud of her.  She didn't hate me or tell me to fuck off.  She hugged me; said she didn't hate me.  She called me a good man a few days later.  She showed me kindness.

I'm trying to pay back that kindness by pulling myself out of the pit that almost landed me in a psych ward and made me slit my wrists with a kitchen knife.

I'm sorry I'm getting angry.  But, sometimes this type of response isn't helpful.  

I know my ex needs support. I'm not the one to give it to her right now.

I can only worry about ensuring I make myself the man my ex knows I am."
