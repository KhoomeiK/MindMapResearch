fatlogic,ffal5rx,t3_eskcqk,1579738499.0,"I’ll take things that never happened for $600, Alex. 
I travel more than 100k miles every year and have for the past 10 years. I’ve never seen someone lie on the floor of an airplane, much less across the aisle. People can be gross, like taking their shoes off. But these stories are not plausible."
fatlogic,ffaku73,t3_esif8n,1579738263.0,There’s been research done that snacking out of the bag contributes to mindless eating and makes it more likely that you’ll overeat. Aren’t they all about “intuitive eating”? Aka actually paying attention to whether you’re full instead of mindlessly polishing off a bag of chips?
fatlogic,ff9mu6a,t3_esewhu,1579716301.0,So they’re admitting that poor nutrition and a sedentary lifestyle are risk factors that contribute to mortality for people at the high end of the obesity scale....Yet fail to make the connection that THESE SAME BEHAVIORS are what make people morbidly obese in the first place. Mind boggling.
fatlogic,ff7j8az,t1_ff5tuy1,1579650833.0,This makes sense! My face seemed to be the first place I gained weight so it’ll most like be the last place I lose. It’s been a while since I was a healthy weight but if I look back at pictures I think my chin was mostly gone around 160 lbs....so a couple more months of hard work!
fatlogic,ff70ohk,t3_ervxy6,1579638773.0,"I developed PF after running 1,000 miles in 2019. I took 2 weeks off from running and it’s completely gone now. Most people who aren’t morbidly obese develop it through overuse as I did."
fatlogic,ff70flk,t1_ff6f1zx,1579638631.0,Seconded. I lost my mom when I was 35 and have dealt with so much anger and disappointment that she won’t be here to see my kids. I can’t imagine how I’d feel if I lost her even earlier.
fatlogic,ff5aykg,t1_ff57dgb,1579585684.0,Hoping my double chin goes away soon- currently 12 lbs overweight and ~30 lbs from my goal weight.
fatlogic,ff5atff,t1_ff4ylke,1579585543.0,I think some people definitely gain it there faster than others. My face blew up when I was at my highest weight. Even now at only 12 lbs overweight I have a double chin. But yeah if you’re in the health weight range I doubt most people have a double chin or fat neck.
fatlogic,ff5amln,t3_eroqzo,1579585360.0,I mean hormones affect mood and hunger but it’s easier for men to lose weight mostly because they’re usually taller and have more muscle hence higher TDEE
fatlogic,ff4twuj,t1_ff4tja8,1579572355.0,Unless the person weighs 500 lbs.
fatlogic,ff4jnn5,t3_ere8ar,1579565228.0,"Compared to Mars, the weather is balmy in Antarctica. So sunbathing there in the dead of winter is a great idea."
fatlogic,ff49b6l,t1_ff445n3,1579558354.0,"I burn more like 800 cals for a six mile run. It depends on your weight. To put it in perspective though, if I just get 6,000 steps in, that burns around 400 calories which means I get 200 back in Noom. It’s pretty flexible and I’ve found it easy enough to continue without feeling super deprived yet I’ve been losing weight steadily. Slowly but definitely steadily."
fatlogic,ff48z41,t1_ff3ugxa,1579558146.0,"I think they do it to account for the inaccuracies of fitness trackers. Based on my experience, getting half back is plenty and I’ve been losing slowly but steadily."
fatlogic,ff48s51,t3_erfoyd,1579558023.0,"I’ve been doing Noom and it’s pretty awesome. 1,500 cals a day is plenty for most people if you eat the right food and yes, they give you back half of what you burn in exercise. I’m 15 lbs overweight and can still eat 1700-1800 cals a day if I just get my steps in (no exercise). It’s 100% reasonable and doable."
fatlogic,ff47fj1,t3_ergk3j,1579557186.0,I work for an apparel brand. We produce the sizes that will sell. Our size runs are based on demand. Period. End of story. We exist to make money not make a statement about fat people.
fatlogic,ff1w80n,t3_er5s1i,1579487582.0,I would immediately puke if I ate this
fatlogic,fevndno,t3_eqq283,1579399310.0,"Lol I saw this in the wild and checked out her stories. She’s saying she turned off comments on this post because people responding with specific calorie numbers make it “unsafe” for her followers that are recovering from eating disorders. Doesn’t HER OWN POST mention a specific calorie number????? The blatant dishonesty is insane, even for an FA."
Noom,feuokfn,t3_ep9ubm,1579388507.0,No-for me I’d rather lose weight slower and not feel ravenous at the end of the day. YMMV.
Noom,feunpv9,t3_eq4q8a,1579388322.0,Chipotle burrito bowls are filling and they way I make mine they’re about 700 cals. Higher than my normal meals but I can eat half and save the rest for another meal or just cut out snacks for the day and it doesn’t blow my calorie budget.
Noom,feun9br,t3_eqgp64,1579388166.0,"Yes you can start over. I got about halfway through, lost 20 lbs and then traveled a bunch for work and fell off. I started from the beginning because it felt like I needed to reinforce what I learned. Just ask your coach, they’ll reset you."
fatlogic,feulzk0,t3_eqnl77,1579387807.0,"If I know I’m going to HH after work, I skip my snacks so I stay in my calorie budget. Not hard."
fatlogic,fesvihn,t1_feqx194,1579369438.0,Right! Most runners never run a marathon. There’s nearly 180 degrees between no movement and a marathon.
fatlogic,fepu250,t1_fepthl9,1579331295.0,My knees hurt for about 2 months before my marathons due to the volume of training. I’ve had zero problems since. If you’re 400 lbs I doubt a day goes by that your knees aren’t in pain.
fatlogic,feps41w,t1_fepmbqo,1579329394.0,I’ve run 2 marathons. It’s definitely hard on your joints but this is the same crowd that tries to argue that type 2 diabetes is totally not a big deal. GTFOH
fatlogic,feohfdg,t1_feo0599,1579300202.0,Right! People eat kosher because they hate fat people.
fatlogic,fem6znv,t1_fem6qxv,1579241997.0,Seriously? Please tell me it was sarcastic.
fatlogic,fem6wcy,t3_epwfvv,1579241897.0,"The left off people who fast for religious reasons. Ramadan isn’t a spiritual journey, fatphobia dates back centuries."
fatlogic,felxj81,t3_epu9dz,1579233450.0,"My mental health has 100% improved as I’ve lost weight. If you’re approaching weight loss looking for an easy fix, or going to the extreme, yeah it’s gonna be mentally taxing. Once I learned to approach it with patience and moderation, it was so much easier."
fatlogic,felgz9b,t1_fekt98w,1579221942.0,Any attempt to moderate you food intake is disordered in their minds. It’s ridiculous.
fatlogic,felgx5t,t3_epp4wg,1579221903.0,75% of women have eating disorders? Give me a break. Citation needed.
fatlogic,feki0oy,t3_epnalm,1579200458.0,Neither of these things is true.
fatlogic,fehxyh9,t3_ep6w3m,1579126101.0,So now every class has to be a beginner level? JFC
fatlogic,fef2aip,t3_eotyif,1579046493.0,Lol what does this even mean?
fatlogic,feexgll,t1_feet6cj,1579043336.0,"I guess I’m partial to 12 step because it worked really well for my Dad, but everyone is different and I’m not an expert on the issue. Thanks for the information."
fatlogic,feenn0l,t1_feeh50z,1579037411.0,"I think we are saying the same thing s in different ways. She should admit she’s powerless in the sense that she needs help and is not “managing” her alcoholism herself and is actually destroying herself. 

To give you some context, she would tell me how dumb her treatment specialists are and how she doesn’t need a sponsor and doesn’t need to go to meetings, she knows what she’s doing. Meanwhile, she just got out of jail for picking up her 8 year old daughter from school after polishing off a bottle of vodka, has had 3 DUIs, has not worked in 2 years, has been hospitalized for alcohol poisoning 6x in the last year, lost custody of her daughter and is on the verge of losing her home. Yet she thinks she’s just fine, her life isn’t in shambles and she doesn’t need the help of addiction specialists. Admitting that she cannot solve this problem on her own, that she doesn’t know everything and that she needs other people who do would go a long way in her recovery. Every addict is different but this is definitely the case for her."
fatlogic,feeefcf,t1_feedb0u,1579032055.0,"Yeah 2 weeks isn’t long enough to see noticeable fat loss unless you’re in a sever calorie deficit which she is not. If she ate 1400 cals a day and was moderately active for 6 months or even 2 months she’d see it for sure. The hardest part about losing weight the right way is patience, in my opinion."
fatlogic,fee7ur1,t1_fee33k2,1579028200.0,Right. It doesn’t make you stupid or lazy if you have it. But acting like it’s so easy and no problem at all is dangerous.
fatlogic,fechqp6,t1_fec8hg0,1578974206.0,My first job out of college was working in a feee clinic and yeah....very few people I worked with managed their diabetes. And a few of them lost toes because of it.
fatlogic,febxx36,t1_febvlct,1578964071.0,Insurance companies make money by charging premiums on healthy people who don’t use their services. I’m sure obese people generally cost them more. But what they say here is a straight up lie. The health affects of obesity are well studied in peer reviewed journals. I hate this person for making me defend insurance companies.
fatlogic,febl3t1,t3_eocqhx,1578959968.0,I can’t believe I’m defending insurance companies but this is a straight up lie. The effects of obesity on health are well studied in peer reviewed scientific journals. I really hate this person for making me defend insurance companies.
fatlogic,feaykfw,t1_feawl03,1578953572.0,"This post sounds similar to how my sister talks about her times in rehab for alcoholism. Addiction requires delusion and she is convinced that she knows better than everyone, including treatment specialists. Admitting that she is powerless would mean she has to change and she’s not ready for that. Sounds like this person is also not ready to change."
fatlogic,feaxvgt,t3_eoa8fy,1578953343.0,FAs never include BED in their arguments. I wonder why?
fatlogic,fe6oj5d,t1_fe6b45x,1578898232.0,That’s insane. Just because it’s no longer a death sentence doesn’t mean it’s totally no big deal to contract it
fatlogic,fe5d9dx,t1_fe5bxwb,1578867973.0,"It’s such a straw man for FAs to say “everyone, regardless of health deserves dignity” because I’ve never met someone who feels otherwise. Not wanting to get a disease that cause multiple other health issues and will likely make me feel awful doesn’t mean people who do have it are unworthy of respect."
fatlogic,fe4et5m,t3_enqqdd,1578858516.0,"Sleep apnea is almost always caused by being overweight. Seriously, have there been any cases of someone who is not overweight having it? My husband’s was so bad and now that he’s lost 70 lbs he doesn’t even snore."
fatlogic,fe4dxck,t3_enrv5n,1578858278.0,Wow. What did punctuation ever do to this person?
fatlogic,fe3i5ia,t1_fe3hem5,1578849453.0,"Right! It kills me that there are people who think that because a disease is “manageable” that means you should not worry or try to prevent it. HIV is manageable now, is it ableist to take PREP?"
fatlogic,fdzcqpc,t3_endjcj,1578789013.0,But definitely spend 2+ hours a day on Instagram convincing yourself that being 400 lbs is totes healthy.
fatlogic,fdzchme,t1_fdz25rq,1578788899.0,I’m sure they do. That’s how it works. Only a raging narcissist thinks it’s about them specifically.
fatlogic,fdzc0p9,t1_fdtvz8s,1578788626.0,"Exactly. I love the shit out of my husband, but if he got to the point where we couldn’t be active and travel and do the things that brought us together in the first place, we’d be having a talk about that. It’s one thing if you have an accident and can’t help it but if you’re doing it voluntarily that’s another story."
fatlogic,fdtxk8j,t1_fdtw9sq,1578723856.0,My husband was almost 300 lbs when we met but he is 6’5” and carried it well so I’m sure FAs wouldn’t consider him fat much less obese. He was though and lost weight after being diagnosed prediabetic.
fatlogic,fdtw8nc,t3_en3n2o,1578723226.0,"Sorry but your partner’s weight IS YOUR BUSINESS. I have been in this person’s shoes. My husband was obese when we met, although he was very tall and just big all around so it didn’t seem that crazy until I knew how much he weighed and what his BMI was. I never pestered him about his weight when we were young but when HE CAME TO ME asking for help, yes I helped him. And if he hadn’t, I would have broached the subject as we got older and the long term consequences of obesity became more real to me. Your partner will have to be your caretaker if you suffer from obesity related diseases so YES it is their business."
fatlogic,fdsvxsy,t3_en0w56,1578708637.0,"Wait, don’t they call *themselves* fat? Why can’t other people use that word for themselves too?"

fatlogic,fdrtf0o,t3_emw4j7,1578689515.0,"It’s a consequence, not a punishment. Punishment is a purposeful action. Our bodies aren’t sentient beings, they’re machines.

fatlogic,fdrmr2w,t1_fdrj9dn,1578686751.0,"My husband was obese when I met him and I found him very attractive. It’s not a fetish, either as I’d never dated someone who was even overweight before I met him. He’s lost weight now and I still find him handsome. More than 2/3 of adults are overweight or obese and a lot of those people still date or are married. Plenty of people find them attractive and not in a fetishized way. Your own tastes aren’t universal. 🤷🏼‍♀️"

fatlogic,fdqwsb4,t3_emta6s,1578675998.0,"Or mayyyybe you allow your child cookies in moderation? Crazy, I know. Not allowing them to polish off 20 at a time isn’t deprivation. It’s called teaching impulse control."

fatlogic,fdpp9ea,t1_fdp1b8c,1578635417.0,He started dating his now husband and his husband would wake him up when he started sleep walking so that helped. He also did some hypnosis that helped him deal with the binge eating while awake that he said made the asleep bingeing lessen as well. He also stopped drinking so much. His sleep eating happened a lot after a night of drinking.
fatlogic,fdozydb,t3_emicy0,1578616734.0,"True story: one of my best friends used to binge eat while he slept. Like he’d wake up in the morning and go to the kitchen and see that he had polished off 4 frozen burritos in the middle of the night and have no recollection of doing it. I think it may have been part of his binge eating disorder (he also binged while awake). He went to therapy to deal with his BED, started CICO and is now down 90 lbs and no more sleep eating. Wild, eh?"
fatlogic,fdoth3w,t1_fdor46p,1578612501.0,"Maybe it’s just me, but since I’ve lost 27 lbs, I can twist myself into a lot more yoga poses. My belly literally blocked me from being able to do a lot when I was at my highest weight."

fatlogic,fdopdq9,t1_fdohh8j,1578609896.0,Uhhhhh pretty sure our understanding of the human body has progressed since 1969. Using that “data” is suspect.
fatlogic,fdop3br,t1_fdolcze,1578609721.0,Agreed. My husband was bullied relentlessly as a child by his father for his weight. I don’t think it was due to concern for his health but rather shame that he had a fat son which makes me so sad. It didn’t help him lose weight and probably made his emotional eating worse. Therapy and exercise in adulthood finally cracked the code for him.
fatlogic,fdoosqy,t1_fdonqsp,1578609544.0,Yeah walking is one of the best ways to exercise and all you need is a pair of decently comfortable shoes that you should be able to find at TJ Maxx for $30ish. Fitness can be expensive but it absolutely doesn’t have to be.
fatlogic,fdolr9r,t1_fdoilia,1578607719.0,Her music isn’t made for 5 year olds though.

fatlogic,fdewzz4,t3_el132n,1578348367.0,"This particular thing she says is not controversial. However this woman is a disgusting, racist troll looking for attention. Look up some of the things she’s said about Muslims and immigrants. She’s also just a dick and bully to fat people. I’m all about dismantling fat logic and speaking facts. I’m NOT COOL with people like her using their public platform to call fat people disgusting and make fun of their looks (google what she said about Kelly Clarkson).

fatlogic,fdewa0l,t3_eky3cu,1578347922.0,She’s right here but she lost all credibility with me by participating on a show that showed people losing weight in an insanely unhealthy and unsustainable way.
