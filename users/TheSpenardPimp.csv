interestingasfuck,fez1bdx,t1_fewdzc8,1579452993.0,There's lots of subsistence moose hunters but locals usually shoot every bear they see. Most bear problems come from smokehouses full of fish and during moose season. You can't hide the smell of 80 salmon drying in your yard or 800lbs of moose meat hanging in camp.

weekendgunnit,fdg7b1w,t1_fdff56v,1578382983.0,"Yeah. Although I use 5.56 for moose on occasion I'm generally opposed to it because most hunters don't regularly practice and know their limits. I can brain a moose under 30 yards if I'm feeling steady with a 5.56. If I'm not 100% sure I can hit its brain, I let it walk away when I have a 5.56. I also only use it in the winter when I'm checking traps or looking for wolves and run into a legal moose. Usually I can get within 10 yards of them on my snowmachine. They don't run either, they let you drive up to them, stop to shut off the machine and stand still if it's winter. I'm generally opposed to using 5.56 because a lot of people use minis and ARs during fall hunts, they mag dump at running moose in the rut while in a boat going above 15mph. Those hunters such as my Godchild don't know their limits and get trigger happy when they see a moose, and acuse me of being a self hating native when I mention that is unethical as fuck."

If I have a 5.56 while checking my traps and I see a legal moose I'll get under 30 meters and kill it ethically with one shot to the brain.

weekendgunnit,fde7gtx,t1_fde6ejc,1578332853.0,Fuckk off it's not my fault I'm native and my mommie made me born with FAS and tenddie dependent she wont even warm up for me
weekendgunnit,fde75a2,t1_fd7hxvs,1578332653.0,Best place to boog tho. Alphabet bois knows if they clap someone here they family gone clap them before they run out of town. They come here in full battle rattle for the simplest shit cause they know rural Alaskans dont fuck with leo.
weekendgunnit,fde6crd,t1_fdau60p,1578332158.0,I tried. I came instead and my thicc cum slowed the bolt down worse.
weekendgunnit,fddnte2,t1_fafi8tl,1578318986.0,"Fag I've used a saiga 762x39 for moose half dozen times and not one needed more than one good lung shot, farthest shot was 200 yards on a cow moose in the winter."
weekendgunnit,fddndk5,t1_fab1mfs,1578318592.0,I be bussin targets with a 7/10 hit rate at 800 yards with my 6.5 grendel with low winds tho
weekendgunnit,fd7ie0e,t1_fd775ex,1578205018.0,It says your a rich ass fag.
weekendgunnit,fd7hsl8,t1_fd7gj2q,1578204735.0,In a lil Alaskan village you have to reload if you want to shoot a lot. Even though AKs beat the shit out of brass it's still cheaper to handload rounds.
weekendgunnit,fd7gk2a,t1_fd6nlad,1578204154.0,Tried that shit too and it still didn't fire. Condensation be a bitch when you go from warm to cold to warm to cold over and over again.
weekendgunnit,fd7gbjc,t1_fd5iqum,1578204044.0,"The barrel has been crowned by a competent gunsmith. I get 2.5moa with handloads, 6 moa with cheap wolf ammo. The 7.62x39 Saiga I gave my cousin prints 1moa with my handloads. I'm not sure why my saiga 223 is much worse."
weekendgunnit,fd7ftfs,t1_fd4tfaf,1578203810.0,Why can't a fag ask for both?
weekendgunnit,fd44a6h,t1_fd2cbc9,1578164295.0,Gotta have fire superiority bitch. You might punch through two moose and stab a guy 10 meters away but you ain't gone make no area denial shit.
weekendgunnit,fd42xoa,t1_fd3vnin,1578163883.0,"Why the fuck not? Shits slipperier than KY butt lube and just as good as Mobil 10-30, the preferred lube for -50f you dumb fag. Why tf would I waste money on gun lube when it's no better than engine oil"
GunFights,fd3n2k3,t1_fd1xzag,1578159853.0,"I agree with everything you said.  Nice write up, I can't write shit like that. The only difference is my current house is built with 12x12 logs,  300 win mag with 180gr tsx won't penetrate that.  Motheruckers shot up my house with a 300 and an AK last year. I didn't fire back, in this village if you shoot someone their family gonna shoot you in front of the troopers. It was my cousins who had beef with me and ended up admitting they done it. I even loaded the .300 rounds for them a few months before they did it."
