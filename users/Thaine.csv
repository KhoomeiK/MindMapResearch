Edit: I also realize now that this is probably important to my reasoning as the bathroom and kitchen are closely connected for me."
wholesomememes,ff39wso,t1_ff39j3h,1579537100.0,"I usually wake up to go to the bathroom, if they were missing I’d assume they were in there. So now I’m awake, have to go the the bathroom, and I’m always hungry when waking up. I’d go to get a snack while waiting only to discover they weren’t in the bathroom.

Edit: A caveat to this being I would be half asleep, trying to stay that way to go back to sleep, so I wouldn’t be fully mentally awake."

wholesomebpt,fcaf6vf,t1_fc9eawc,1577568197.0,In Gmail you can set it to have a dead man switch. Somewhere in the settings you can set it so that if you haven’t used your account for a certain amount of time (I chose 18 months) they will give ownership to the email address you provided. No idea where it is at though since I did it a few years ago.
