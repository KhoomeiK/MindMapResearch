I never came from penetrative sex only, but at the same time I never tried to because I don't get why I *shouldn't* touch myself. That's literally what the clitoris is there for. Never heard of a man who insisted to only orgasm without touching the tip of his penis."

And you can't even defend yourself because the difference in strength between male and female adults is too big which probably is a huge reason for why this even happens so regularly - there are no consequences for the offender.
