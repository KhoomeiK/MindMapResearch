Hillary Clinton was supposedly more popular than Trump, but Trump still won, because he was already promised the title since he was a boy(his family has mad CIA ties, and the CIA, much like all government intelligence agencies, runs the whole show.). 

The Hillary hype in 2016 was manufactured media hype(propaganda) to further divide and conquer the people, and have them fighting over bullshit, instead of what really matters, like cutting the power to this global slavery system that we have been born into. 

The level of social engineering and corruption in America is absurd. They’ve gotten everyone so dumbed down with the poor diet(America subsidies the worst foods for it’s people, and makes you pay premium for proper raw foods, that could easily be grown in our own backyards, if only the government didn’t completely fuck the farming industry in it’s own country), and living conditions just keep getting worse and worse, as more and more people are getting priced out of life. 

You’re good as dead in America if you don’t make money. It’s a complete human farm in my opinion, made to crush souls and produce empty humans void of intelligence or passion, so that the ones on top get to fuck children on their private islands while the slaves produce and consume like the cattle they’ve been turned into by the machine of ____ism. 

At this point it’s going to take a miracle to reverse the damage that has been done to the people of this land, because as you see, people still buy into the whole political system, and think that all is well in “the land of the free, home of the brave.”"

COMPLETEANARCHY,fckluto,t1_fck5uyh,1577728149.0,"Reminds me of what the invaders from Europe did to the native North American people. 

If you’re not a slave for these banksters and human traffickers, you’re good as dead to the world. It’s pretty fucked that we are called animals with no souls by these people, yet animals in the wild have more freedom than we as human beings.

No other living thing on this planet is told where they can and cannot be, or what they can or cannot do to live out their existence here in this shared space. Humans are the only living thing on this planet that are restricted by imaginary games(such as money), and the only living being that are punished by the herd for following their instincts, or choosing not to participate in this game.

Despite what the propaganda system of control we live under wants to say about human nature, Humans are not animals, and our “nature” is certainly not that of a predatory animal. Humanity needs police, like a dog needs lice, which is to say not at all.

 Compare an average happy,healthy baby human to any animal in their natural environments, there are clear differences between the two that cannot be denied by any person who is honest and has no hidden agendas. 

The big problem we are facing as human beings as a whole(and we’ve been facing this problem for generations now, sad to say), is that we have been lied to, are continuing to be lied to, and are perpetuating systems that are based on lies & manipulation. We are also lying to ourselves about literally everything we think we know about what it is to be and exist here, in this space we share with all of life. All so that a small group of people can benefit off the suffering of others. 

None of these systems we allow to continue are in balance with true human nature, and police destroying people’s homes, because they can’t afford to exist, due to money, is the most fucked up backwards logic that just shows how corrupt and soulless these police are. 

Paper money wasn’t even legal for period’s of time in history, due to the faulty nature and easy corruption of it’s system as a whole. 

TLDR; Police aren’t here for our safety or benefit, they are only here to enforce the slavery of humanity through ruthlessness. It is inhumane to support them, because they are here to benefit the wealthy rulers, not the common man. Which they so easily forget they are as well.

conspiracy,fcj46t2,t1_fch0spy,1577676843.0,"Unions don’t solve the problem as it goes deeper than jobs, money, and power. 

 The problem is the system as a whole is corrupt as all get out, and a kin more to a human farm at this point in history, than a fair and just society as we are taught to believe in for generations and generations. 

We’ve collectively had the wool pulled over our eyes since long before any of us were even born, and we continue to be lied to about quite literally every aspect of what it means to truly be a human being.

 It’s a hard pill to swallow for many people, and rightfully so due to how deep the lies go, on top of the conditioning that we are subjected to constantly, from cradle to the grave.

It takes a lot of will power and the right guidance to break that conditioning, especially when so many people don’t even know the alternatives that exist. For example, Unions in the formative years were the alternative to poor wages, bad working conditions and attempting to bring humane conditions to what is ultimately slavery. Because Unions were compromised before the 1970’s in America, to go back to them would be in vain. It’s not impossible, but many people have failed to go the extra mile that is required to truly break out of the box that humanity has been put in over the decades of control we’ve been subjected to. 

I can relate to OP’s frustration that getting the truth out there seems like a fruitless endeavor, especially when you have cult members like Ol’ Epstein(with their Little Saint James), getting away with such obvious crimes against humanity, while people in supposed “first world countries” are homeless, starving, and being experimented on; but as they say, “if you don’t stand for something you’ll fall for something.”, and no matter how fruitless it may seem, it’s bad enough this is rarely being discussed; But, what’s even worse is how ignorant American’s are of their own history. and quite frankly that’s what the controllers want, and fuck giving them what they want, they get what they want enough as it is. We must keep powering through, and the truth needs to be spread, even if you have to have a 6 minute fist fight just to get the message across. 

TLDR: Unions don’t work because they are still attached to the political branch, which doesn’t allow for honest union leaders to be protected from political(criminal) opponents who can murder them, thus silencing their movement."
