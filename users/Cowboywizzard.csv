videos,ffcn7ht,t1_ffclhas,1579803032.0,"So, as a fire fighter you know that excessive speed is not encouraged in your truck. You are absolutely no use to anyone if you get T-boned in an intersection on the way to a fire or an accident. A firefighter taught me that years ago. You dont need sports car speed. A top speed of 90mph vs 150mph makes no difference trying to navigate traffic and road ways. If you are going to argue this, I question if you are a real firefighter at all, or should ever be one. Maybe you need more training. I used to be a paramedic, and now I'm a doctor, so I know all about needing to hurry in emergencies. But be safe about it.

You just thing Mustangs are cool. That's fine. So do I, I have one."

offbeat,feiespq,t1_feibu28,1579136841.0,"Lifetime appointments insulate the justices from political interference and influence to some degree. Itbis an integral part of the checks and balances on the other two branches of government. The justices are more free to give their honest scholarly opinion on the meaning and intent of the constitution because they aren't in fear of losing their job at the whim of whoever is in charge this year. Can you imagine if Trump could just fire Ginsberg and load the court with his cronies with no qualifications or education? 

Perhaps the justices are old and out of touch, but they don't have to pander to political masters or the fickle public opinion of the week as much. I wish more of the justices shared my admittedly left leaning opinions (i.e.; women should be able to go topless if they want just like men), but I'm glad they are appointed for life for life nonetheless."
