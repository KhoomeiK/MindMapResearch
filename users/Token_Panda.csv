So yeah, I can only hope it’s just a step back instead of a step backward into a ravine."
CFB,fel8eim,t1_fel7nis,1579216292.0,"My friends think I’m kidding because I have a fairly aggressive strain of fandom, but I really think I may finally be done with LSU football.  Like not in a bad way, but in a “what more is there.” I mean even if you statistically beat all the records, it would be hard to replicate the stories of Burrow CEH even Jefferson and his family.  And while there will be other interesting stories, you can never repeat the completed redemption arc of Coach O.  Like you said, a dream season.  

I wouldn’t have thought that’s possible, but the complete opposite happened last year with me and the Saints last year and while I watched purely for Fantasy Football purposes, I just didn’t really care that much about the NFL.  

Again, I say all that 72 hours after the NC.  Ask me again in August haha."

GetMotivated,fefmsaa,t1_fedo84d,1579059717.0,"I was very disappointed in the hire. It was partially be Alleva had a terrible process and I remember his Ole Miss days and how he was a micromanager and figured he wouldn’t have learned. Then all the stuff about Matt Canada (his first OC) came out and it seemed to confirm it. 

For this sub in particular, I think it goes to show you that you can fail terribly but if you keep grinding and have the humility to learn from mistakes you can still kill it. Another lesson is this: not long after he was hired, he lost to Troy state, a team supposedly far inferior to LSU, they are actually paid to come and play. People wanted him gone after that. 

28 months later, he won a national championship with one of the most dominant seasons ever in college football. 

I couldn’t be happier being wrong."

amex,fcwrddu,t3_ejaio5,1578034570.0,"I agree but it’s possible to get good value if you travel enough. $200 Uber is fairly easy for me to use, then my wife uses the Saks credit for make up she would already buy. If you imbibe, and travel frequently enough, a fair amount of the airline credit can be used up (also On my last flight with Delta I talked to the FA about this and she said just order doubles and they’ll bring you the bottles or order snack boxes and save them for later). 

That usually leaves between 0-$200 dollars of value to recover. I use the SkyClubs or Centurion or Escape lounges at least twice a year, which I peg at about $20-$40 dollars depending if I’m traveling with my wife for food and drink. 

Thus at the end of the day it becomes about at most a $200 cost spread over the year, usually lower which I think is worth it. 

Also with the Schwab, if you get tired of the points game you can always cash out at 1.25 cpp into your account"

awardtravel,fcmn9qe,t3_ehmo6h,1577782648.0,"Used 112k UR for two Biz from Detroit to ATH on AF. First time in Biz for me in a while and first for the wife and it was a great way to start the honey moon. 

On the way back 140k AA got us QSuites from Qatar to London then BA 1 from London to JFK which was such a unique and fun flight. 

Also did a semi last minute after Christmas trip to Hawaii for 100K Skypesos and 200K Hilton. While not the best CPP, we planned it sort of late and it did let us get out of town to Hawaii for essentially $200 for flights and hotel saving us about 2000-2500 cash). A super fun and memorable trip I would definitely had scoffed at if paying cash but didn’t hesitate with points. Learned the lesson that it’s not always about CPP but about getting the experiences you want. 

As always thanks to the community for their help with planning and advice. If any of these are trips you’re planning I’m happy to help/let you know what I would have done differently."
