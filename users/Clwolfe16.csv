If you're asleep, it's the best damn sleep of your life. But you'll feel shitty when you wake up, like when you take a nap and accidentally wake up at 4 am. If you're awake, just focus on something or ask if you can watch a show on your phone as long as your arm isnt in the way. They use a small metal stick that you cant feel, then they'll grab your tooth, wiggle it, and it comes out.

AskReddit,fecroaf,t3_eoemhc,1578982050.0,"23F here. I would mention it once you and your partner get more familiar with each other. Maybe start flirting and mention it casually. But I would also bring up the idea of including toys in the bedroom. Some guys on the smaller side can perform quite well, but dont be hard on yourself if you cant; it also depends on your partner. However, if you're willing to use toys or your fingers/mouth more, it let's your partner know that you want to satisfy them and that can make all the difference"
