ultrawidemasterrace,ff92ulw,t1_ff927nj,1579703483.0,Hey amigo. I switched from 120Hz TN to 120Hz IPS. I felt a small ghosting issue at the start then I just switched to super fast or 3Ms response and it was ok for me. Do the jump man just do it and only AW3420DW. Everyone who has AW3418DW say that changes are major vs 3420
