The church teaches that infallibility is a charism entrusted by Christ to the whole church, whereby the Pope, as ""head of the college of bishops,"" enjoys papal infallibility.[12] This charism is the supreme degree of participating in Christ's divine authority,[13] which, in the New Covenant, so as to safeguard the faithful from defection and guarantee the profession of faith, ensures the faithful abide in the truth.[12] The church further teaches that divine assistance is also given to the Pope when he exercises his ordinary Magisterium.[14” -/u/nondescriptwhitevan
