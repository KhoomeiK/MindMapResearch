AmItheAsshole,ff7xdng,t3_es3c5k,1579660613.0,"NTA. That’s a lot to ask of you, especially considering she still owes $250k and the house needs major repairs. Do you and your fiancé have the money to pay for those repairs? Or would you have to borrow it and go into more debt? What happens if the grandmother needs nursing home care? In some places, the value of her house can be used to determine how much she would be required to pay towards it, how would that affect your stake in the house? And even if you did all this and took on her credit card debt via the mortgage, how do you know she won’t just start spending and get herself back into debt again? Then what? Home equity loan and more debt for you?"

They really need help with that, or it won’t matter how much time and money you spend fixing up and cleaning the house, they’ll go right back to hoarding and it will all have been for nothing. Also, look into professional cleaning services. What you described is really bad, and there could be hazmat issues in there, especially if there’s food in the fridge that’s been bad for a long time. You should also be prepared for the house to need more than cleaning. There’s no telling what kind of damage is hidden under all the stuff. Please think about how much of a commitment you’ll reasonably be able to make in terms of time, effort, and money."

northernireland,feyq1ta,t1_feyendf,1579449111.0,"It’s not so much the idea of actively promoting sex outside marriage as it is creating a permissive environment for it. Using the proper type of contraception in the right way can massively reduce the risk of unplanned pregnancy and STIs (though not eliminate it completely, end of public service announcement). So the idea is that more people will be willing to have sex outside marriage if the potential for negative consequences is very low. It’s one reason birth control pills were controversial in the 1960s. There was this fear that if women had control over when and whether to get pregnant, they would develop “loose morals” and go around shagging everyone. Either that or they’d choose to stop having children entirely and the human race would die out."

The reason why a fair number of people are pro-life (which I think is a misnomer, it should be pro-birth, but that’s a different discussion) is because of the religious belief that life begins at the moment of conception. People who hold that belief also tend to believe that sex outside of marriage is a sin. So encouraging people to practice safe sex when they’re not married encourages sin."
