ITCareerQuestions,feu643n,t1_feu4bk3,1579383449.0,"Because you're reinforcing a cycle of exploitation.  Everyone else doing something doesn't make it right. If market rate is like 10$ an hour but you can and have paid 30 but you pay 15 because someone used to make 13, you're exploiting that worker because 13 an hour is a bullshit wage to begin with, especially if the job is worth 30 to you.  You're not just ""saving money"" you're objectively making someone's life worse off than it could be because you possibly think ""this is business it's not personal"" except you perhaps forget all business is done between people.

Do you think it's fair to exploit someone because they've been exploited by other companies before?
