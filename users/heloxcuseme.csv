Great way to twist a kind act into an insult. Avoiding a guy who was trying to be nice to you is way out of line. I hope on your behalf that you haven't damaged your relationship with him by avoiding him, cus thats one good guy you want to keep around. If it has, I suggest doing something to make up for it, cus you would absolutely owe him an apology."
relationships,fen11tb,t3_eq1099,1579274582.0,"Good fucking lord, you said in your last post that he punched and broke a door and TV?? This is not a ""nice guy"", he is *dangerous* and you need leave **immediately**. 

I don't know what happened to you to have any sort of doubt whether this behaviour is acceptable, but you need fix that normal meter immediately and kick this abusive cunt to the kerb. Get a restraining order if you need.

Edit: it seems OP has since deleted said post, which is extremely worrying to say the least. OP please realise you are not doing anyone any good in trying to pull the wool over our eyes to cover for your awful boyfriend, especially not yourself. We can  tell you til we're blue in the face that this man is not good for you, but in the end it is up to you to come to that conclusion by yourself."
offmychest,fekzagr,t1_feky1rk,1579210714.0,"I'm sure to a degree, life is what you make of it and based on your perspective of your situation.

 But to say whether you are a ""victor or victim"" is ""100% your choice"" is insulting to people who go through awful atrocities through no fault of their own."
offmychest,fekw1ym,t1_fekqwk5,1579208783.0,..what if you get cancer? Or paralysed from the neck down? Can you still mind over matter your way out of that?

offmychest,fdd8xnf,t1_fdd8thq,1578300274.0,"? What? 

Does this mean you're adopting? In which case I would take back everything I said."
offmychest,fdd8i9b,t1_fdcf4hf,1578299662.0,"Maaan even your post history is a dumpster fire. This lady really be tryna birth kids whilst being suicidal and depressed. People out here be crazy.

If I were religious I'd pray for you."
relationships,fd9xojj,t3_ek7b8f,1578239251.0,Reading this gave me a migraine.
offmychest,fd8yd52,t1_fd8xmgv,1578225325.0,"""My stomach is churning"" 

And soon your childrens will be as well. Say ""ok"" again, but even you have to see the utter delusion in crying about the world, being nauseated by it even and then bringing in more people against their own will. I sure wouldn't want to come into this hellish world.

Try to take care of your kids, because you'll owe them everything."
offmychest,fd8xk23,t1_fd8x9lt,1578224953.0,"Cant be that worried about all the suffering out there if you're willing to fling your own child out there. Worlds a shit place, but your kid can just deal with it right? Not your problem.

 Abhorrent."
offmychest,fd8x5wu,t3_ek6u5r,1578224768.0,Its beyond selfish to bring children into this mess.

worldnews,fcqxb0h,t3_eihbzk,1577893624.0,"This is why you should check for personality disorders before being able to run for PM. 

Does anyone really think a full blown narcissist is capable of making decisions for the ""good of the people""?"
JustNoSO,fcqtqs8,t1_fcqsax4,1577892066.0,"Thats the thing with narcissists. When it suits them, they can be a joy to be around, but only for those limited periods of time. Then they flip their switch and decide its time to make your life hell, and theres no real predicting when itll happen. It's how they draw you in. Abuse (and yes this is emotional abuse) and then ""love bomb"" to try to make you forget it happened. I don't recommend the ""amnesia"" route, hold him fucking accountable, though i can *guarantee* he won't take it well.

It's up to you to come to the realization that being ""good"" sometimes doesnt excuse their shit behaviour the rest of the time. A good partner is someone who you should feel open and comfortable talking about eachothers feelings or disagreements, and there should DEFINITELY not be this constant feeling of walking on eggshells. No constant and exhausting ups and downs.

I think its urgent you realize soon this soon, because its affecting your children also. Do you want them to grow up like me?"
JustNoSO,fcqs1xr,t3_eii4y9,1577891320.0,"My father was exactly like your husband. It seemed like you would never know what kind of mood he's in, and God forbid you ever call him out or even talk to him normally, you would set him off. He'd go out while the family was celebrating holidays, or go to his room and sulk the entire time. 
By the age I was about 12-13, I just stopped being upset by his actions, because I knew that was just how he was and it wasnt anyone elses fault. I lost any little remaining respect I had for him, and realized I hated him. I pushed and pushed for my mum to divorce him, but she remains with him til today. I realize now that he was a narcissist, and such volatile emotions are characteristic of NPD. I hope to go no contact with him soon, and I have not really forgiven my mother for not shielding us from him."
AmItheAsshole,fclr1zg,t1_fcijvg1,1577754394.0,"Fuck that. This woman has a duty to protect her children and she failed that. She had kids with this man and proceeds to stand around and watch as he shreds the kids emotional wellbeing to bits. Do you know how isolating, frustating and self doubt inducing it is to have an enabler parent? The constant excuses and rug sweeping is fucking *infuriating*. 

Enablers are pathetic and garner no sympathy from me."
JustNoSO,fcju1kj,t3_ehf3cu,1577704708.0,"Fucking christ, Ive been through your post history. Why the hell are you still with this man? 

You've acknowledged that hes a full blown narcissist, but yet choose to stay with him and cheat on him. You both deserve eachother at this point."
AmItheAsshole,fcic79d,t3_eh9vas,1577660401.0,"NTA your mother is an enabler, who is honestly as bad as the abusive parent."
PlasticSurgery,fcgqzwx,t1_fcgppyx,1577643123.0,"Yes  this is why I said ""if they so choose"". It could be entirely possible they are not bothered by the nose, but if they are, its up to you to finance the procedure."
PlasticSurgery,fcglliz,t3_eh72ig,1577641406.0,"Yes, I think you should pay for it, if they so choose to undergo the same procedure. Morally it just makes sense, you knew there was a risk of passing on the unwanted feature when you had the kid, which you yourself felt so strongly as to spends thousands changing it.

People are gonna downvote me because they want to have kids and bear none of responsibility for their decision, but this is just the logical conclusion."
JustNoSO,fcez0qw,t3_eh0ez0,1577625046.0,"Strangers on the street would show more concern for you than your SO. 

This man does not care about you. It is in your best interests to leave.

Edit: i read through your post history, I wish you luck on the exit plan"
JustNoSO,fceslgk,t3_eh19yr,1577623389.0,"Nope. Nope nope nope nope nope. 

You SO works 20 hours while you work full time, and you do 85% of the childcare? And you call him a ""good Dad""? *Girl what*?"
PlasticSurgery,fbgugm9,t1_fbgraj5,1576858853.0,From my initial description what type of jaw surgery do you think would be appropriate?
