RimWorld,ffa76hz,t1_ffa173t,1579729208.0,The debuffs are too harsh for that. :(
RimWorld,ff9xo9h,t3_esg46t,1579723749.0,I rescue all the tribals who get downed and let them go for the reputation increase.
HalfLife,ff9un09,t1_ff9u39c,1579721758.0,">Maybe they won't be called barnacles in the game, to appease your sensibilities, I'm not sure!

Yeah, I'm the only person who wants enemies to be canon like they are in every other game. Great argument."
HalfLife,ff9rx6q,t1_ff9rv1e,1579719848.0,"Why would they do that though? They eat their prey alive and they always have in all the games, they aren't barnacles anymore then."
HalfLife,ff9ruq0,t1_ff9rpg3,1579719795.0,"Nah, it was UGC, RGL wasn't a thing when I played, but I know ESEA is quite bad too."

HalfLife,ff9p5ru,t1_ff9p2lb,1579717781.0,I wasn't! I was saying the community sucks! TF2 is probably one of the best multiplayer games released in the past 15 years at its core.
HalfLife,ff9oacv,t1_ff9nhcv,1579717166.0,"You're right but it's overwhelming in the TF2 community. People are insanely hateful and bitter even when they aren't provoked. You can try it yourself, if you play the game and are decent you will get tons of people shit talking you even if you say nothing. People spamming binds at you telling you to kill yourself just because you killed them in a videogame lmao. Fragile egos.

Going to just edit this: Look at threads on teamfortress.tv, there are constant threads from people saying they quit the game due to stuff like this, even ""big"" people like tagg"
HalfLife,ff9nno0,t1_ff9ndkh,1579716787.0,"I really hope they didn't change how they work, they said in another post they changed them because people don't like being grabbed in VR. How would they change them? They're iconic in the Half-Life series."
HalfLife,ff9n2v2,t1_ff9mxhe,1579716444.0,Not sure what you're trying to say tbh.
HalfLife,ff9mfq7,t1_ff9m5kn,1579716062.0,"> I had a lot fun writing for the left 4 deads where the characters were all little chatterboxes

Characters interacting with the world and eachother without always being prompted to by the player is such a wonderful thing."
HalfLife,ff9lmyu,t1_ff9lj12,1579715591.0,">As is always the case with Marc, we send him an email, and he sends us a response, and then roughly 40 more replies to his own email.

Fuck, Marc is so awesome."
HalfLife,ff9ka1t,t1_ff9jrti,1579714793.0,"Motion sickness only really happens to people that are new to VR, eventually your brain gets used to it. If they removed or changed content for fear of some users getting sick they are neutering their creative vision."
HalfLife,ff9k24y,t1_ff9junz,1579714665.0,The other questions were already addressed in other posts.
HalfLife,ff9jt4j,t1_ff9jpvq,1579714516.0,My man.
HalfLife,ff9jhzd,t1_ff9j7jj,1579714332.0,I've been playing TF2 since like 2007 and honestly most of the community is really bad to the point where it feels like they deserve the neglect.
HalfLife,ff9j096,t1_ff9ieul,1579714037.0,Well I don't know if they will work any different since the game isn't out yet but iirc they usually just move with the players view.
HalfLife,ff9ipu2,t3_esen9b,1579713863.0,Which type of locomotion was the game primarily designed around? Basically everyone who gets into VR gets past motion sickness after a little while so hopefully the game wasn't designed around teleportation exclusively.
HalfLife,ff9ib8w,t1_ff9i4rx,1579713621.0,"I love you so much, thanks!"
HalfLife,ff9hv9f,t1_ff9hpr9,1579713353.0,"Yeah there is no way they do that, every Half-Life game with barnacles in it has them slowly grab you and then chomp you to death if you don't kill them, there's no way they have them instantly kill the player just by touching it. If they change how they work then they aren't barnacles anymore."
HalfLife,ff9hokw,t1_ff9hdi1,1579713238.0,"This post gave me nostalgia for the staff video and now I can't even find it on youtube, HELP!"
