astrology,fb995ye,t3_ec2wxl,1576632589.0,I usually say “i don’t care if you don’t believe in it but you don’t have to shit on me for being into it” something along those lines and that usually shuts people up. I just don’t think it’s fair for them to judge me and make fun of me for something i enjoy because i never judge people for not believing it.
