It seems to me that it is less a matter of media manipulation and ""punching above the facts"" than a case of not everyone seeing Sanders in the same light.  People are not seen has having differing views, but as being evil people who are ignoring the obvious truth of the Sanders message.

Some examples:

In 2016, Sanders was telling his followers that he still had a chance to win the nomination even up to the California primary.  Even after this last primary, he argued that he could convince the superdelegates to vote for him.  It seemed clear to me shortly after the Michigan, that it was all over and Sanders could not win, largely because of the proportional assignment of delegates.  It seemed to me that Sanders would not just have to win an unlikely number of states, but win by unrealistic margins.   Anyone who said that the race was over and Sanders was hurting our chances in November by continuing to attack Clinton seemed to the Sanders campaign to be unfair to Sanders.

Similarly, it is a fact that many people oppose medicare for all because they worry about giving up their current insurance for a new, untested Some Sanders supporters clearly believe that anyone who says this is a lying shill for the insurance lobby, and that they are ignoring the fact that MFA will cover everything for less money, and will not have any of the problems that many national insurance plans have with underfunding and long waits.
