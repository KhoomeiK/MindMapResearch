There’s so many tracks that would — you know, actually take effort to make with the mixing and producing... some tracks even have vocals already on the backing track. There are too many tracks for one person to consciously commit to, and all the songs have an inconsistent mastering. It would be upsetting to hear if he steals the music from unlicensed creators because that can be both plagiarism and punching downwards. I wouldn’t be surprised if he did commission/make a couple of songs though, Ram Ranch is his signature song.

wholesomememes,fefglle,t1_fefdtgp,1579055890.0,"Thank you💕 people like you really do make the world a more hopeful place. I’m just in a psychologically unfulfilled state right now. I’m still getting over having to let go of some loyal friends who I’ve regretfully developed an unhealthy relationship with (although it’s been a year since). I’m constantly trying to attain self-actualisation now when its proven to be unobtainable without social satisfaction. I could easily try to forcefully slot myself into friendships, but that would be inauthentic — and I’m tired of faking myself. 

We do need people like you and posts like these and discussions like these. It’s scary that there are so many people going through an anxious or apathetic time in their lives, and it’s scary to experience it."

Edit: this is quite a bit of an abstraction from what was originally said, which was more “I’m not convinced your existence is valid”. But I do find it infuriating when someone says “I’m not ...phobic, BUT” because it becomes a yer-dad moment, and quite hypocritical."

ContraPoints,fdcr0to,t1_fdclrkv,1578281898.0,"I feel like the word “valid” has somewhat morphed in meaning through the Internet. Although it normally means for something to be real or correct, the LGBT’s of the Internet have probably used it as jargon to encompass “allowed”, “accepted”, and “valued”. 

If I am wrong, you can tell me💕"

I LOVE THAT IT TURNED OUT NATALIE PROBABLY DIDN’T COMPLETELY DIG UP HIS PAST!"
