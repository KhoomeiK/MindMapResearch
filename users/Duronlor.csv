Political_Revolution,fekndbq,t1_fekmls2,1579203647.0,"Replaying it by putting up anyone but Sanders who will be weak on actual progressive issues, carrying significant baggage into the general, with a smaller less enthusiastic base of support?

Anyone but Sanders *will* be a repeat of 2016"
Cooking,fehsf0f,t1_fehr3z2,1579122947.0,They're blending them into the sauce so it doesn't matter. At least that's how I read it
mildlyinteresting,fctd5we,t1_fct7yxc,1577939533.0,"There definitely has been an increase in the amount of Roundup and other resistant crops which would lead to more crops being sprayed with those products. I don't really see what ""simply isn't true"" about that. Why else would they be using those crops. There is also plenty of documentation regarding negative health effects from consuming those products. 

We have the ability to innovate and create products that could be a solution that doesn't involve putting known bad substances on what we consume.

You're just repeating arguments that are encouraging us to side with Monsanto"
mildlyinteresting,fct7bmo,t1_fct0v26,1577934779.0,"There is a problem with GMOs that make plants more resistant to Roundup and other harsh chemical pest- and herbicides. Farmers become more liberal with them which can impact local wildlife, water, and what you're eating. I'm all for GMOs that improve the crop or yield or quality of the product, but understanding downsides to it or how it can be a bad thing is just as important."

Not to mention the fact that they still gain a wild amount of influence through their net worth."

It's a two parter, so it may take some time to get through, but I haven't found any articles that get everything together in one place like these episodes do. Not to say there aren't any or there isn't backing to the thought, just that I think this is the best way to start learning about him.

bestof,fc4htln,t1_fc4e3xo,1577417072.0,"I don't have a WaPo subscription so I can't read that.

I don't disagree that Bernie had a problem addressing actual race issues in 2016, but he has updated his strategies and it shows. I've been to rallies to see him and he specifically addresses and speaks to race issues now and it shows. Joe is riding on, like the link says, Obama's coattails.

I'd also like to make you aware that black support isn't the only way to have a diverse support group in the US. There are other minorities in America and Bernie leads with them while still maintaining black support groups, generally younger while Joe skews older.

You'll have to scroll a bit to get to the race breakdown section.

bestof,fc43p7x,t1_fc43bfj,1577405819.0,Whew you're a powder keg ready to go aren't you? I don't feel like being the spark that sets you off even more. Have a good life and get some help for how you think because I assure you that is not the reality unless you purposely subscribe to Bernie subs
bestof,fc42y8n,t1_fc4209n,1577405250.0,"Calling someone toxic and putting words in their mouth makes you the toxic one.

Continuing the use of Bernie Bros as a way of insulting Bernie supporters is also pretty toxic considering he has a majority female base of support"
bestof,fc40vbj,t1_fc3x87v,1577403687.0,"First, I'm not down voting you here.

I don't know if I said it in this chain or another in the thread, but he has a huge amount of support from young people who are generally more active online, so you may see more ""aggressive Bernie supporters"" online but I have trouble believing anywhere near a majority of his supporters are like that. 

I've also looked into screenshots of ""aggressive Bernie supporters"" where the people they are responding to are blatantly ignoring or misrepresenting arguments they make or are being just as aggressive, so I generally take any comments about ""his supporters"" with a grain of salt.

I'm not questioning whether you feel this way but merely making a statement. If you do believe that he is the best candidate, that he could help a lot of people, and that he deserves to win, then I think looking critically at a common excuse for why people say they won't vote for him is important and something that should be confronted whenever possible."
bestof,fc3zgb5,t1_fc3yizp,1577402624.0,"Where did I call him braindead or spineless. You quoted something I didn't even type.

I called the argument braindead because it is a result of using no thought. I also said to have a spine and express why you don't like him for real instead of ""his supporters"".

Get some reading comprehension please"
bestof,fc3u3wu,t1_fc3t3qu,1577398669.0,Yeah it's incredibly disappointing
bestof,fc3tfvm,t1_fc3s7r0,1577398184.0,"You've shifted the conversation from your completely false statement on his ""very specific group of people"". Who exactly is that group if his support is so diverse?

Do you have sources regarding your Biden comment? I was able to provide sources that you only called one into question without saying why outside of ""lol it's propaganda for the left"""
bestof,fc3oyd5,t1_fc3n8m9,1577394992.0,"And what evidence do you have to support any of that besides pulling it straight from your ass? He has the youngest group of supporters, ergo more active online, and one of the largest bases of grassroot support. Basic logic would lead to the conclusion that he just has more people online who like him, but keep at it with these baseless conspiracies"
bestof,fc3op4f,t1_fc3o3lx,1577394808.0,"Every single one?

It's a weak argument that people use very often on the internet for why they don't support him.

It really isn't surprising that someone who speaks to people like he does on fundamental issues like healthcare reform creates passionate supporters who do get tired of hearing the same refutations or dismissals that aren't based on facts. People are tired of not being heard"
bestof,fc3ntcp,t1_fc3lxzf,1577394168.0,Or the fact that their billionaire owners of those media outlets aren't a fan of someone who wants to tax them like they should be. Put your thinking cap on next time before venturing onto the internet

bestof,fc3ncdl,t1_fc3msq1,1577393832.0,"Do you usually say things without thinking or is it just about Bernie? He has the most diverse support of any candidate in the primary. If you're going to use false information at least try to pick things that aren't so readily debunked.

Yes, surprisingly enough, when a candidate drops out of a race and endorses another candidate people stop trying to get that candidate elected. Funny how that works."
