Compared to our relationship now, where im extremely open about the topic, and we communicate more she starts enjoying it and sometimes initiates herself."

And be HONEST. wag mo dayain kasi sarili mo lang dinadaya mo. Diet is 70% ng pagpapapayat, 30% lang ang gym. You cant outrun your mouth sabi nga nila. 

Pero kung maggym ka, magtanong ka lang sa mga coach doon or kahit sa di mo kakilala. Wag ka magcrossfit muna ah, my own opinion to. Kung mataba ka pa mabibigla ka sa routine nila don baka umayaw ka. (marami akong kilalang napaayaw non sa pound4pound) kahit light cardio muna. basta focus sa diet talaga."
