Cubs,fel6yla,t3_epqejc,1579215388.0,"My family had the chance to get season Tickets in 2014 for the 2015 season. My dad, a cardinals fan turned them down because the Cubs were ‚Äúbad‚Äù. This man needs to do his research because we all know what happened to the Cards and Cubs after 2014. Lesson for me was to know more about prospect lists...."
politics,fdsk97d,t1_fdqv916,1578704226.0,"I think these are the toxic types of churches. I am Catholic , and I know my branch of Christianity has its flaws, but I think penalizing people for leaving is stupid. My church is very open minded, and our priest talked about how Christians being scared of a secular world is silly. In my opinion, if your church is afraid of others, then you aren‚Äôt a ‚Äúreal‚Äù Christian because you aren‚Äôt loving others. It‚Äôs silly to believe in a loving God when you can‚Äôt love others yourself."

running,fcnrlgb,t1_fcnr172,1577817098.0,"Yeah no problem! I did end up getting better, even though I‚Äôm not sure why I slumped. It could‚Äôve been I wasn‚Äôt eating good or something, but I had my first cross country meet a few weeks later and it went okay. I got hurt last season though, so I didn‚Äôt Pr and was out for a month. I‚Äôm trying to get back into training for track right now. But to answer your question, keep running because it will get better. Try to sleep a lot, eat healthy, but also make sure that if your body isn‚Äôt feeling it, try to take it a little slower until you get better. This happened after I ran ~400 miles over the summer and a kind of running boot camp, so I think my body kind of crashed."

Create a scene in your mind in which you are relaxing and watching one of the superhero films in the series ‚ÄúThe Avengers‚Äù or any substitutable film, when a Homo sapien under the age of 18 rests his pupils upon your body, 1/12 of a minute in Africa later, the sound of the insect known as a cicada reaches your eardrums.
