AskReddit,ff93xp6,t3_es76uw,1579704253.0,"I have a few of them:

**Babylon 5** has amazing story and character arcs.  It's REALLY rough in spots, but overall, I love it.

**Friends** never fails to make me laugh in almost every episode.

**The Expanse** is a great series that is just different enough from the books to keep it interesting, but not so different that it's not the same.  

**The Shield** is a great cop show and I love how everything that has happened falls back down on Vic and his team in the final seasons.  

I will also probably be watching **Justified** and **The Americans** again too.  I've only seen them one time, but I  feel like the shows got better with each season and the final seasons were the best of both of these shows."

boardgames,ff50sjr,t1_ff4hyk9,1579577166.0,"We only just got it after Christmas.  We both really enjoy it.  If you like euchre, this is a kind of similar game but with a twist. The scoring makes you really think about strategy and it's super easy to take and play anywhere."
boardgames,ff3zjw1,t1_ff3qklg,1579552287.0,"No, it has Glyphs, Crossroads and Dead Ends, and Door to the Omniverse. They're paid expansions though, but I got Glyphs for free.  Rarely play with it though."

scifi,feflepl,t1_feei26s,1579058818.0,"I love Phases of Gravity. It's a short but highly emotional book and I get something from it each time I read it. May be an unpopular opinion, but it's easily my favorite Simmons book."
TheExpanse,fe8p48n,t1_fe6idv8,1578928804.0,"Like when they're about to be boarded by Martians, yes ready to kill them and Holden is ready to shoot Amos.  Then Alex gets rid of them with a secret code.  Amos turns to Holden and smiles and says, ""Will that worked out."" And just carries on."

AskReddit,fdn4wl5,t1_fdm5khb,1578577370.0,"It's great storytelling.  I cried during Iroh's story in ""Tales of Ba-Sing-Se,"" along with a few other moments."
boardgames,fdl8i9y,t1_fdk350g,1578518848.0,Thanks for the clarification!  :)
AskReddit,fdl7kmw,t1_fdk71f8,1578518397.0,"Agreed.  I just finished rewatching Avatar: The Last Airbender and loved it all over again.  Totally enjoyed The Clone Wars and Rebels and I'm currently watching The Dragon Prince on Netflix.

My wife thinks it's silly, but I can't convince her to watch, even though I know she'd enjoy those shows too."
boardgames,fdhj4dl,t1_fdhezjo,1578423735.0,Thanks for the heads-up.  I'll watch out for it.
boardgames,fdhcs9y,t1_fdgw7vn,1578420065.0,Fox in the Forest is fun.  It's crazy how you go from suddenly trying NOT to take any tricks to suddenly wanting ALL the tricks (and possibly back to wanting NO tricks again).  You really have to be on your toes for that one.  It's a nice twist on trick taking.
boardgames,fdhcl0k,t3_elc0et,1578419962.0,"This past week, we bought Fox in the Forest and played it a couple of times.  My wife loves the game and so do I.  We'll be playing that a lot more.

Tonight, we're playing our first game of Songbirds (which we also just bought this past week), and some Cribbage.  We also want to try to get in our first game of Everdell."
