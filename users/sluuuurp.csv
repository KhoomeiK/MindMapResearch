AskPhysics,ff9mxbx,t1_ff9ma7m,1579716353.0,"Don't take it too literally, I just mean that the phase of the gravitational waves only changes by a small amount during the lifetime of one photon, so it only gets contracted/stretched a small amount, so we can ignore that and treat the wavength as always constant."
AskPhysics,ff9lacl,t1_ff9klw6,1579715386.0,"(I'm making up the numbers for this example)

Over the one microsecond it takes for a photon to travel through the arms, the contraction factor is 1-1/10^16. But over one millisecond, the arm contracts by a factor of 1-1/10^10. So, the light doesn't exist for long enough to be affected much, while the arm does.
