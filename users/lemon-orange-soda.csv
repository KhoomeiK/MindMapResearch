college,femmp8l,t3_eptzy6,1579262840.0,"There hasn't been a shooting in my country, and owning or buying guns isn't common or that easy. 
But at the start of the year I wondered, what would we do in that situation? BUT then (thanks to a tornado) we learned that the school is basically designed to avoid shootings (it's erathquake safe) 
Instead of a wall, we have bullet proof windows to the hallways, the door can only be opened from the inside, with some team work you can get people out through the windows, and then there is a yard-hill that you can't access through any other way , and there is one set of stairs at the end of the hallways that connects only a few floors and you can't see it from the next set of stairs. With the lights off and the courtains down you can't see anything. 
I always keep in mind a plan of course, just in case."

I had a sthaphylococcus aureus infection in a bruise, caused by a sprint in my ankle. The bacteria separated the periosteum (membrane that covers the bone) from the bone, and my body started to calcify it as a reaction.
So basically my body was creating a new bone, and this one was piercing my leg from the inside. It was symply the worst.
It was so infected that my skin started to peel away and it hurt non stop for weeks, like if I was on fire. 
After the surgery (it started as a biopsy, they ended up finding out and cutting all the extra bone) I had to walk with an open hole in the leg. You could see the bone."

The meeting was early today (it's almost 2 am right now) and I ran up to my favorite teacher. In the middle of my anxiety I dared to tell her, and she went in with me. She said so many mice things about me, and explained why I deserved every chance they could give me.
Now I have a plan of action, and I will have to face some teachers, but it's part of my responsability. I'm still nervous about everything, but I actually feel ""worthy"".

Nothing out of the ordinary growing up. We celebrated birthdays, christmas and new year's eve together. It made our families be really close, but still had typical family fights, different opinions, etc. Honestly, never had a brotherly relationship with those cousins, and today we rarely see them. 
It helped too when my parents separated, made them keep it cool and friendly. 
It made it also easier to take care of grandma, who lives with my aunt and uncle, since it doesn't feel awkard to go visit her, and bother anyone.
In terms of genes, these cousins don't look alike anyone in the family, except for their parents (one of them is the only blonde of the 10 cousins)."

A new t-shirt can round £13.27 to £15, but that is 5% of a minimun wage (£1.63 per hour)
