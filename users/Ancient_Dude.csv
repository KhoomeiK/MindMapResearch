oklahoma,fc6z1x5,t3_egi45s,1577493192.0,"My Republican source (who was involved in a minor way with the Stitt transition) says that the story he heard is that oil oligarchs told Stitt that they were upset that when the state needs money the first thing it does is jack up oil and gas taxes, according to the oil oligarchy.    They want Stitt to tax the Tribes more and they guarantied to make up any resulting loss in campaign contributions.

My source expressed skepticism, as do I, but that is the story he heard."
oklahoma,fc6mv04,t3_egeqxm,1577484337.0,"67 year old Okie here.    The word had different connotations over time.

Originally, in the Steinbeckian sense, it carried an awful context.     This is undoubtedly what your grandfather experienced.    My 4th grade teacher told us what it was like to live through dust storms, the Dust Bowl and told us never to use the word Okie.

""Okie From Muskogee"" ended up being kind of a wash after people came to realize that it is satire.     

In the late 1960s then-Governor Dewey Bartlett, Sr., launched a campaign to make Okie a good word.     He manufactured and distributed ""Okie pins"" for people to wear to show their pride at being from Oklahoma.    Oklahoma astronaut Thomas Stafford took an Okie pin on Apollo 10 to the moon.

Today for me Okie means just a person from Oklahoma with neutral connotations.      There needs to be a word shorter than Oklahoman to refer to a state resident.    I wonder what percent of Okies even realize the word had bad connotations.   The Dust Bowl was 80 years ago and the median age in Oklahoma is 33.6 years of age."
