you are limiting fruits to super low sugar fruits as the only ones, and you have to be  restrictive with tomatoes and root veggies including onions, as they contain more sugars than most.

Theory just tells me you're playing a 4-5-6  in the bass, as you're outlining two majors and a minor, and if I was a play off you, I could either just jam on a minor pentatonic in E, or follow the structure of Lydian C, Mixolydian D and Aeolian E phrases (but even then, some notes may fall a bit short of what you want, even though they're technically IN.)

The fact that you figured this out without being able to piece all that together means your creative side has clicked with it even if your logic side doesn't understand why it works.

When you love something, you always want it to do better. And being critical of something is a way to tell the company that they should do better. Especially if they have the money to. We've had many companies fall into this ""safe"" mentality. they won't attempt to innovate because what they're doing is good enough to make money."
gaming,fbypa9z,t1_fbx29xy,1577222758.0,"Don't know why you're being downvoted, it's you're opinion. But here's the thing: I went to school for this too. I did C++ development before too many engines where predominant, I wrote games using DirectX SDK libraries, and XNA... I learned OpenGL implementation of models. This all was a lot more rudimentary that loading games into an engine, as you were writing your own game engine. heck, we designed our own level-editor using XML for a 2.5D platformer. 

Sure I moved into standard engineering, but all that stuff is still there. I have a friend who works on the CoD franchise, and other friends working at Unity, Sony developer support, etc... 

Many games simply need more time, or more developers and expertise. Look at the History of GameFreak's pokemon games... Nearly every time they were up against a wall, Satoru Iwata would jump in and reprogram their stuff to make shit work. Gold and Silver too big? Iwata wrote a compression algorithm to let them fit a whole second world map. Pokemon Stadium not running properly? Satoru Iwata rewrote the battle engine in a week.

They NEED to hire experts. You'd know that for every scene, or map, you load in models, and keep them stored off the map, and bring them in when you need them right? Game Freak doesn't do that. they stored a COMPLETE copy of the model on each map of Sun/Moon, clearly showing a lack of understanding around 3D game programming. Problems that other companies have already solved, they're re-writing the book and making their own work-arounds for them. they need to grow to innovate, and TPC has the cash for them to do it"
gaming,fbyodfo,t1_fby49f6,1577222075.0,"that's not entirely true. TPC is Game Freak + Nintendo + Creatures yes, BUT, TPC's overwhelming majority of sales does not come from games, it comes from merchandise. So if they have a new set of Pokemon that Creatures wants to release and sell, and TPC as a whole has a timeline slated for the next season of the anime with the new pokemon and Region, Game Freak is GOING to have a tight deadline to appease the other players in TPC. If they have to delay the game, that means merchandising and the show will have to be delayed too. It's a symbiotic relationship that turned parasitic"
gaming,fbwvgy7,t3_een69l,1577160515.0,you're putting any games you bought her in there too to update right? cus those are also going to need their own updates before working
gaming,fbwgexm,t1_fbwfo56,1577149243.0,"Pokemon is the worlds best selling franchise. The game was rushed because the Pokemon company simply wants to sell more merchandise, but they can't release that merchandise without a game to follow suit.

So they give GameFreak a deadline. Half the team is working on a different game. Instead of delaying, they cut corners. Because it's pokemon... it'll sell.

That's the problem. They spent so much time working on Camp animations, that they let the core battle loop suffer. They didn't have a cohesive vision of what the visuals should be.

The cop out that ""it's for kids so it can look less than stellar"" simply doesn't hold up. Mario Odyssey and Breath of the Wild we technically meant for kids. So it's fine if they become cynical cash grabs too?

The company needs to innovate their pokemon games, and they are instead putting less effort in. Keep the Mega's, keep the Battle Tower, things people actually care about... forget Dynamaxing, curry-dex, camp...
