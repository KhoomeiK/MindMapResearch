TheBlackList,ff89u05,t3_erzzt2,1579670287.0,"She never did a background check. Ever. No mention of it, it wasn’t even an afterthought for her. Now, I haven’t seen past episode 10 of this season but, until that point, she just thought the neighbor lady was some sweet old woman. I don’t know about you but, that old lady doesn’t look sweet. She’s actually kinda creepy. 

But, ya know, maybe Liz doesn’t give a shit because Agnes is a lame ass kid. OMG. That little girl is like the Kmart value of child actors. 

I firmly believe that Liz has had a brain injury in the show that the writers have forgotten to fill us in on. She’s the worst FBI agent I’ve ever seen on TV."

thisisus,fehi99w,t1_feh0tmc,1579117085.0,"I worked at a large hospital and saw many “relationships” start over bonding talks about shitty spouses. And, some people even seek out people that are in troubled relationships.  It’s awful."
thisisus,fehhe5o,t1_fehfbxd,1579116576.0,"I think it can be problematic in a lot of different ways. The biggest problem I see is that talking about marital problems, that can be a deeply personal and intimate talk. Opening up to another person emotionally creates a bonding/intimate connection. Those feelings can lead to romantic feelings fairly easily, especially if one person is single or both people are in a troubled relationship. 

I wouldn’t put money on this but, I think if you were to ask your female friends or your wife/girlfriend how they would feel about you talking about your problematic relationship with an attractive single coworker or a woman you know from the gym, they might not feel so great about it."

I cannot deal with the talking to a whole list of people about his feelings, including a woman. If he was just venting to one or two male friends, I could be cool with it. But, as a general rule, I am very uncomfortable and think it’s a horrible idea for a straight married man to vent to a straight woman, that’s not his licensed therapist, about problems with his marriage."
thisisus,fegx218,t1_fegt5os,1579104450.0,"Yeah. He needs venting friends because emotionally, Kate is a handful. Even way before the baby was born. She is very sensitive and and Toby has had to do a lot of tip-toeing around her."
thisisus,fegwuxr,t1_fefo68c,1579104322.0,"That’s the biggest problem I had with the whole situation. I’ll even go so far as to say that, I personally could have dealt with the venting if the venting wasn’t being done with women. Cuz let’s face it, guys need to vent sometimes to people that aren’t their wife/partner. When i have to vent it’s lots of times a friend. But Toby venting to a whole email list and getting too close to Lady Kryptobitch. Yeah.... no. 

Pick a guy friend or 2, Toby, and that’s it."
