Aerobic exercise for 30m a day reduces stress, increases executive function scores, and will increase your stamina ([book source].)(http://www.brainrules.net/brain-rules-for-baby) 
That could be whatever you prefer. I don’t personally love treadmills, so I’ll do 15m segments on two or more of other cardio machines. 

You can also talk to the people at planet fitness. Mine let me set up a few initial meetings with a trainer to talk about good starting places for me, and what sorts of things he recommended for my goals. I hate not having more advice, but I’ve just started gym workouts in the past few months and don’t have the expertise to give advice on what someone else “should” do."
FitnessMotivation,ffazqw7,t3_esk2ay,1579748266.0,"You got this! I had some athletic friends who coached hs sports and I asked each of them to go w me a few different times to show me various things. I also went to a 3-week Women on Weights program to learn about how to plan a workout and have some help with it. It can be intimidating and potentially dangerous to learn lifting on your own, but you can increase your confidence and monitor your own technique pretty quickly once you get started. 

I highly recommend going w a friend for cardio and/or finding someone w enough expertise to keep you safe from injury if you want to learn to lift. Another good option is finding a gym with classes. It is fun, minimally social, and they give step-by-step instructions. Good luck!"

adhdwomen,ff6b52l,t3_ernm0l,1579623330.0,"I looked up “temperature” and “ADHD” on google scholar and didn’t find a direct answer to that, but found an interesting [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jsr.12075)  on ppl w ADHD and sleep dysregulation. From the abstract:  “Overall temperatures were lower in patients than controls.... Irregular sleep–wake patterns and delayed sleep in individuals with attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder and delayed sleep phase syndrome are associated with delays and dysregulations of the core and skin temperatures.”

My takeaway is that it can be a characteristic that might go along w other symptoms we have. Eg, if your body is bad at regulating some homeostasis stuff (sleep/wake cycle,) and the controlling system (SCN of the hypothalamus) is also related to temperature (also hypothalamus,) it could be related to ADHD, but moderated by occurrence of the sleep disorder."

I think it’s a great portrayal b/c it moves beyond the stereotypes and includes other common-yet-lesser-known characteristics, as well as showing positive and negative outcomes from his behaviors. Eg, he always has fun ideas and ppl love him, but he almost gets kicked out of his apartment b/c he throws his mail into his “mail tub,” a huge-ass pile of snail mail he’s never opened. There are a bunch of other examples I love, but I’ll stop there b/c it isn’t even answering the question you asked :-D."
HPfanfiction,ff68fla,t3_ertbzo,1579621585.0,"This concept in cannon bothered me for a long time until I thought of the analogy of pets, especially ones you can train for tricks or work, like dogs or horses. There are abusive pet owners who should not own pets, and it should be easier and quicker to get the pets away from them, but the vast majority of people would think it was excessive and even cruel to force dogs away from their homes in the interest of freeing them. The equivalent of “giving clothes” is difficult in the analogy, b/c the closest thing I can think of is removing a fence and/or collar. If we did that, I think most dogs would act like Winky and cry at the back door to be let back in. Unfortunately, even some pets that had been neglected or mistreated may act like that. Some dogs might happily chase squirrels away from the house, but then only a tiny population would be happy to be lost and out of the house when it rains or is cold or their dinner bowl isn’t filled. 

That said, house elves seem to be more self-sufficient, like cats, and I believe more pet cats would be able to survive if kicked out. Some dogs (or other pets) would too, and be like Dobby, reveling in their freedom. It’s probably an interaction between level of domestication, level of self-sufficiency, and level of care from the owning family that determines the morality of keeping another species dependent on you.

There are more aspects of the analogy that I could extend or describe as exceptions, but I didn’t want to make this too long. Ultimately, we don’t know from cannon if any justification actually applies, so I think it makes sense that this makes us (and Hermione) so uncomfortable."

Let me ask my supervisor what they recommend you do.”

Imo, no need to “come clean” to anyone in the situation. Imposter syndrome is real, and identifying it is the first step to combating it. You can share personal details if you want to, but recognize whether it’s guilt goading you to tell. If that’s the only reason, sternly tell that imposter syndrome to back off!"

I recommend that book to OP, b/c I think a deeper understanding of what’s going off the rails can really help getting it back on track. It was a relatively easy read, if I remember correctly. It talks about estrogen pills helping, but I’ve heard that’s not medically healthy for many women/extended periods of time, so maybe borrow it from the library or the Libby app instead of buying it. 

Other than that, OP, there are 2 main things that can help at work: 

(1) practice w working memory games to maintain it as much as possible, and 

(2) offload to other systems (lists, calendars, etc) to avoid negative consequences of WM decrease. 

Stress can also decrease WM capacity, so increased stress could also be contributing to effects you’re experiencing."

I always thought I had to act a certain way, not mess up, (not be ADHD,) to be okay with myself and and not need to apologize for who I am, until a therapist asked me if I could say and believe, “I deserve love,” (spoiler alert: I couldn’t. Still hard for me.)

Changing format (comics, audio book, ebook); context (listen while walking or washing dishes); or activity (w other ppl reading, w a book club) might help, too.

ayearofwarandpeace,fdw2rjs,t1_fdv88ke,1578754456.0,"I see where you’re coming from, and have a different interpretation of Vera’s actions. I think she was driven to perfection, and so didn’t have the fun that the others are having in youth, but now is just criticized for who she was brought up to be. The younger ones commit a faux pas, by running into the room, but it is laughed off. In contrast, she is rudely told, “you’re not wanted,” when she was doing the socially accepted thing. 

I think coldness and apathy become armor when you constantly get messages that no one likes you. Granted, it becomes a positive feedback loop b/c she has become extremely unlikable, as evidenced by her actions toward the others in her generation, which causes them to insult and leave her. 

I think that’s what leads to acting like she has no emotions. Sometimes, when you feel completely rejected, all you can do is straighten your spine, paste a smile on your face, and try to convince yourself you don’t care about their opinions anyway."

YouShouldKnow,fdrum8s,t1_fdr9dvm,1578690014.0,"I don’t know, maybe acceptance in that case means accepting you’re apathetic, but since you know doing nothing b/c you feel nothing is unhealthy, you take steps to become more healthy, like going to a therapist, working out, being in nature, eating healthy, etc...  

If such a person denies their apathy, maybe they’d just keep getting mad at themselves for not doing things bc they don’t care, but feeling like they “should” be doing those things. In contrast, maybe if that person accepted their apathy, they’d know interest/passion wasn’t going to be a motivator, so they need to do things for other reasons, like gradual steps toward better mental health. 

It also has a lot to do with being gentle and forgiving of yourself. If a person has depression and it is hard for them to get out of bed, it is an achievement to get out of bed! It often can be disheartening b/c they might compare themselves w others who appear to be accomplishing more things, but loving yourself for doing the best you can on any day is crucial, even if “the best you can” isn’t what you might have wanted."
YouShouldKnow,fdqv04a,t1_fdqrcwn,1578675206.0,"I kind of see it as change through loving self acceptance. If you have a trait or action that causes you harm in some way, you have to accept it before you change it. 

For example, if I’m late to work every morning and keep beating myself up about it and/or self-castigating to “just be quicker in the morning,” it probably won’t change. However, if I accept that I am late every morning and think about it with self-love, I start to see options. “As it is, I am late every morning, and I cannot change that by ‘going quicker’ b/c despite my best efforts, ‘going quicker’ never happens. Therefore, I can try to change something else. Make lunch the night before? Limit wardrobe choices? Set the alarm earlier?...” It helps change actions as well as feelings and thoughts about yourself. 

Like I said, I am in no way an expert.

Teachers,fcxeu35,t1_fcxd3ad,1578061064.0,"Reading and math are the biggest foci. Pure science and history/social studies are relegated to rotations, maybe one or a couple days a week. Many teachers try to work them into the other topics, ie choosing to read a historical fiction during ELA (English language arts,) and discuss the history in addition to whatever reading comprehension lesson is on the docket. 

Also, applying old skills to new concepts is cognitively demanding and can temporarily decrease ability and/or recall even at learned skills. Context is important for memory retrieval, not just “remember when you learned x,” but, “remember when you learned x, in which you did whatever whatever” or “...which you learned to solve y types of problems.” If you’re in an area where a large number of students have trouble with skills from lower grades, you could even go over the easer content in isolation before teaching your new thing that incorporates the fundamental skill. No, in an ideal world, that wouldn’t be necessary, but if a majority of the students need it, it’s less of a waste of time than skipping it and having the majority of kids be lost for the rest of the lesson. 

If you’re in a district where homework is largely supported, sending home review of concepts before the new lesson that they needed to have mastered previously can be more helpful than after the lesson, sending traditional homework on concepts they can’t do independently w success due to missing these fundamental skills.

Elem teachers spend a vast deal of time teaching math. For a variety of reasons that are different, but no less valid than difficulties at other levels, sometimes students move on w/o learning what we wanted them to."
