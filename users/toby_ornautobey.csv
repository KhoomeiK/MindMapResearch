ConvenientCop,ffa4ppk,t1_ff9v7uz,1579727837.0,"Thank you. That is very kind of you to say. I do write and have had a couple short stories published in books of collected short stories. I have one poem that I posted on a Writing Prompt not too long ago, if you want to take a read. It was just something a little humourous that I wrote off the top of my head. Others said it has a Monty Python type of feel to it. It's a poem on fictitious Knights if the Periodic Table of Elements.

As though they really didn't want any collateral damage. Maybe this was their first hit and they were nervous and didn't want any undo harm to come about. Maybe they thought she was cute, soon to be single, and would be turned in seeing a man take charge while holding a weapon. Or maybe they just suck at killing people, which is very fortunate for this guy. Idk, but I'm glad they didn't kill him and even more glad they didn't unintentionally kill a bystander."
