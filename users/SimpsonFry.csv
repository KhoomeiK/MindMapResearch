movies,fdqrysb,t1_fdqo704,1578673604.0,"Went to film school and we learned about how budgeting works for films and while my knowledge of this is a bit rusty, the obscene amounts of money go into things like:

-cameras

-photography equipment

-paying big name actors

-paying extras

-above the line crew (director, producers, cinematographers)

-below the line crew(grips, gaffers, PA‚Äôs)

-pre-production

-post-production 

-marketing 

Add into the fact that most big budget films shoot for weeks on end and all of that adds up. It shows that even middle budget movies (a dying breed) still cost at least 30 million to make and the way things are going, 30 mill might be considered ‚Äúlow budget‚Äù at this point."
