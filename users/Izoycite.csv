corgi,ff67ile,t3_ernjkj,1579620979.0,He mostly wants to sniff them through the fence...no herding yet.
corgi,ff5zyc9,t1_ff5zoul,1579615537.0,I had to ask...they are Flemish giants.  They are huge!
corgi,fecb37i,t3_eoepce,1578969933.0,Omg I call my corgi dogtor!  Mostly because he goes to class with me and teaches.
corgi,fe9qt2g,t1_fe9op45,1578940671.0,"That sounds promising when we are at home.  He also gets to come to work with me, so it might be difficult when I am at the office."
corgi,fdxoirt,t3_enbr6d,1578771262.0,The corgner if you will ;)
corgi,fdr80gw,t1_fdqdkt2,1578680697.0,"It has also been great for Huxley's barking.  Kona, his sister, can't hear that well so when he barks at her she usually ignores him and looks away (with a bit of attitude).  He instantly stops when he realizes she does not care."
corgi,fdr1mig,t3_emt2vd,1578678309.0,Happy half birthday Taco!
corgi,fdqcbc9,t1_fdpmd62,1578662798.0,"We have been making sure she is getting some extra attention and alone time with us. We had another dog who was slightly younger than her, but he passed a few years ago. So even though this is all new and we are taking it slow so she can warm up to the puppy, she is already excited. This morning instead of running to the back door for outdoor time she ran to his crate to give him a good morning kiss."
corgi,fdnd9mw,t3_emabm5,1578583327.0,I was just about to ask about the dog bed too!  I am interested
udub,fdgv3fx,t1_fdfuhei,1578409066.0,"Huxley’s human here, you could have asked and I would have let you.  It was his first day on campus so he was really tired when he got home."
corgi,fdflxo2,t3_el4or3,1578364758.0,Omg that’s my Huxley!  Great pic!!!
corgi,fdcx6fp,t1_fdcwfto,1578286935.0,His previous owners worked with him in crate training a bit and we have been continuing it. The hardest part has been getting him used to his new crate in his new home.
corgi,fdcrw7a,t3_eknxud,1578282554.0,So cute!  Great name!
corgi,fdc611s,t1_fdc21ed,1578267798.0,Yeah we never let any of our dogs play with rope toys ever. Huxley has a few “alone time” toys...mostly teething toys.
corgi,fdc0i98,t1_fda1ozh,1578264757.0,"Yeah Huxley has already expressed his distaste for the Harry Potter series, he is really fixated on trying to chew them (until they got moved higher on the bookshelf. Went out and got a few different kinds of Bully Sticks and non rawhide chews, totally forgot about these."
corgi,fdc043t,t1_fd9xrox,1578264599.0,I can’t wait until he can meet his big sister. She also is a herder so it will be interesting to see them figure out who is heard if who.
corgi,fdbzxh7,t1_fd7motz,1578264511.0,"We have been working on sit/lay down/come/stay. We noticed he is learning words quick, even for his toys. My precious dogs were much older and conditioned with some bad habits, so this is so refreshing having a dog who wants to learn. Huxley is stubborn for sure when he wants Thank god I teach...I am used to stubborn lol."
corgi,fdbzm2e,t1_fd9ln94,1578264356.0,Any advice for getting the pup to walk. He really is hit or miss with the harness and lead.
corgi,fdbzi6v,t1_fd76i38,1578264300.0,"Miso you are the best!  We had been given a ton of advice from my vet, also a fellow corgi owner, but it was a lot of info thrown at me all at once. Plus, I had my own questions. The hardest part has been the crate, he slowly has been taking his naps in there, but damn it is hard not to just cuddle with the little ham."
corgi,fdauk47,t3_ekgnoo,1578250366.0,Is that the little spot between the ears?  If so mine is :)
corgi,fd70w19,t1_fd6oyuz,1578198093.0,"Thanks for the advice Crazy!  I will have to look for that, currently I have been reading a lot about training Corgi puppies online.  The potty training is taking some time for sure, mostly getting Huxley into a routine.  I was very lucky that his previous owner had been crate training him.  They worked with him to be doggie door trained, so we are just getting him adjusted to the new normal. The dog I had before Huxley was also doggie door trained for well over a year, so lucky for me I have had a bit of experience in this area.

Tell your sister good luck with her poodle pup and again thanks for the advice. We have to run to petco tomorrow so I will be on the lookout for a Corgi book."
corgi,fd6hadv,t3_ek6j9g,1578191003.0,"Hi everyone meet Huxley. He is 13 weeks old and has completely won me over. I’m new to the corgi world but have owned dogs before. Huxley has a 14 year old older sister who is a rescue  they have not met just yet, she sadly has a cold so we were instructed to keep them separated until for a bit. 

What I would love is some advice on getting him into a routine. I work at a university, so I am lucky that I can bring him to work with me. He already has been crate trained, but we are still working on potty training. Any and all advice with having a corgi schedule, especially one that involves spending the day at work, would be appreciated. 

Thank you I advance!!"
CarPlay,f7a4r4a,t3_dia98l,1573520340.0,"So I have an update!  After being frustrated about this I searched around the internet and found a fix for the old XR/XS that seems to have worked for me.  I had to reset my network settings.  Sadly, I had to setup all my Wi-Fi passwords again, but I no longer skip tracks when using CarPlay in my mini!"
