I was once walking through a busy street holding my then 2 year olds hand.

Not everything is black and white, even if the research says “many people feel more sad drawing a sad face every day” that’s still “many people” not everyone. 

Perhaps some people drawing grumpy animals would feel more grumpy but you need to consider other factors and if they are going “haha silly grumpy animal” I think the haha outways the sad."

There is a big difference between “I’m only drawing this annoying face because someone told me I have to” (that would make me annoyed to begin with) and “I’m drawing sad animals because I think it looks funny”"

gaming,fe6qhei,t1_fe6q5hg,1578900632.0,"Yep.

I thought of another way you can use it:

If someone used to be a nice and calm person, who rarely got upset at something or rarely swore. Then starts playing a game where the community does so frequently - if they then start swearing more or getting worked up when they never used to - you might consider that they were infected by the toxic community."
gaming,fe6pxbm,t1_fe6pig1,1578899924.0,"Words have different meanings depending on use in the situation - often there are many words that can be used for a given context).

If you generally have fun in a game, laugh enjoy yourself and are friendly or at least neutral to other players 80% of the time (regardless of their skill level) and then happen to get frustrated after a very poor loose streak and call someone a jerk or asshole for using cheap tactics - that’s being a dick.(you would not use toxic for this person as generally they are easy going)


If most of a persons interactions in a game are negative, if their first reaction when something goes wrong is to swear, belittle or yell at the other person. - that is toxic, yes they are ALSO being a dick. Their mindset is toxic and it causes them to be a dick."
gaming,fe6pf03,t1_fe6p1nq,1578899295.0,"No toxic is a way of life/thinking. 

The word toxic is used in the context of:  “toxic behaviour has infected that person” meaning they live with it(like lead poisoning) unless cured (but the cure can be self imposed).

It’s possible to be a dick only occasionally, but being toxic means constantly shitty behaviour/attitude."
aww,fe5uypb,t1_fe54kx5,1578875538.0,"The reason he doesn’t climb may well be due to pain, stiffness or discomfort in his joints when performing climbing actions - the mutation that causes their ears to fold also causes joint degeneration. 

Cats are extremely good at hiding pain so it may not be obvious at first if it gets worse, keep an eye out for stiffness when moving around or walking as it could be a sign of arthritis setting in. 

“In the early 1990s a group of Australian veterinarians demonstrated convincingly that all Scottish Fold cats have abnormal bone development of their distal limbs. This is generally associated with early onset and accelerated progression of osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) in joints of the distal limbs and tail. The ankle and wrist were the joints most obviously affected, especially the ankles.”
