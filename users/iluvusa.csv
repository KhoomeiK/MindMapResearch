savedyouaclick,fdrr4zr,t3_em90pj,1578688413.0,In my state I would be thrilled to get a minimum wage job.  This state has done nothing to attract any new business and most of the companies that were here are now in the south.  People are moving out not moving in.  It is disappointing not to get at least a small raise on an annual basis but until manufacturing is really back and booming this maybe the norm.

If anyone would like this from a child's prospective let me know I lost my grandparents, my great aunt and uncle and my mother by the time I was 10."
