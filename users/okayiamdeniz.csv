Drunk lovemaking is the worst lovemaking.

Just tuck her in warm in to a blanket, make her feel safe,  and when she wakes up, and still wants to be with you then you know its real and soo much more intimate!"

Miata,fc49o3g,t1_fc47o5x,1577410415.0,"Yes the stalling happens after reaching operating temp. 
(Also it would idle at around 1100 and stall at lights, but i paperclipped the old diagnostic plug and set idle to lower rpms, so thats sort of fixed)

Update:
Its the Cam angle sensor.
Car died while cruising to city center, a red souped up NB miata drove by, and after that a really cool dude who tunes Hondas jumped off his scooter to help me push it off the road so i could wait for the ANWB guy (dutch AA) in safety. ANWB confirmed its the CAS that causes this sudden loss of power.
People are really helpful :)"
