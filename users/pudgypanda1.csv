StardewValley,ff8eyjv,t1_ff8c4lt,1579675600.0,"Yeah, I meant more so after you’ve already gotten those things the first few years - I’ve gotten the stardrop at the fair, and all the rarecrows that are festival-associated. I didn’t know about the luau raising hearts with everyone!! I mostly asked bc I had a festival day coincide with a big harvest day and it was one of the 9-2 ones, so I was debating going vs harvesting."
SexToys,ff735zx,t3_erxut2,1579640193.0,"I love my Sona Cruise! Def a different orgasm than my Le Wand gives me - the sonic part of the equation is really a big diff. It’s also got a long ass battery charge and the silicone is suuuuper soft. Plus it’s all molded out of essentially one piece, so it’s easy to clean without being worried about water getting in between parts."
Breath_of_the_Wild,ff6aebh,t1_ff4nt0f,1579622855.0,I’m terrible - I almost always hunt them bc they are slowest to get away so I don’t have to sacrifice an arrow - just a little durability off whatever cheap weapon I keep equipped while roaming. And then I sell the meat 😬
Breath_of_the_Wild,ff3pcv9,t3_erfmnb,1579545971.0,Yes that’s...totally what I do with the foxes in this game. *sweats nervously*
StardewValley,ff3otmr,t3_ere3ak,1579545648.0,Sandy and my kid love to just...hang out in the middle of my mayo machines (haven’t bought a shed yet bc I don’t know a good spot for it!) when my inventory is taken up by eggs and I’m just like pls Sandy baby the clock is TICKING
pokemon,ff3ojyt,t3_ercp7b,1579545483.0,DIDN’T THINK IT COULD GET BETTER. WAS WRONG.
EggsInStrangePlaces,ff3beyx,t3_er3qh1,1579537877.0,This has some threatening aura to it.
SexToys,ff3bd9d,t3_erabzo,1579537854.0,i swear by the bad dragon stuff! i usually use the clear bc i’m not necessarily in it for the cumplay - it’s just that i’ve found cum lube is a much nicer consistency for internal use with dildos and whatnot (i am a vagina haver). but i do keep a bottle of the white too. *finger guns*
heungtan,fevqyil,t3_eqisnt,1579400440.0,This is PRECIOUS.

pokemon,fdztmm6,t3_enf4cl,1578795511.0,I came here to have a good time and I’m honestly feeling so attacked right now.
aww,fdztk5h,t1_fdzba2c,1578795466.0,"ABOMINATION OF PROTEINS. what an excellent phrase. I’d argue that while the lack of gyri and sulci on the koala brain is pretty egregious, so is the idea of transitioning to an almost wholly folivorous diet as a member of family ursidae. like, really??? the only reason the pandas need such a stupendous amount of land to begin with is because they are not good fermenters and so they need a STUPID amount of bamboo to survive. not to mention that when bamboo species go through mass die offs during flowering years!!!!! why pick such a risky food source? just hunt or heck, if you’re too lazy, scavenge like the rest of your ursid - and carnivoran - brethren, damnit! YOUR GI TRACT IS NOT EVOLVED FOR THIS, YOU FOREGUT-PREDOMINANT-DERIVED CHILDREN!!!!!!"
aww,fdz6ido,t1_fdsgz1c,1578787149.0,"dude. same. talk to me about giant pandas. i’m chinese (for christ’s sake, my username!) and therefore contractually obligated to love them and also they are fucking adorable, but goddamn, evolution, you really missed the mark on that one."

EggsInStrangePlaces,fdpfu0f,t3_emkklo,1578627524.0,i really love this one because it highlights how even a fridge can be a strange location for an egg given the proper (or i guess improper) context
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdnm58v,t3_em59u1,1578588676.0,This is the kind of tweet that has me asking if the hets are okay.

Breath_of_the_Wild,fde0p9h,t1_fdbbbpm,1578328537.0,i’m SO glad i wasn’t the only one who thought this during the tutorial stage when they first popped up
Breath_of_the_Wild,fddzj6p,t3_ejtmv2,1578327750.0,"ah - sorry guys, they had keese hanging off them and at first i thought they looked like they might be meltable. thanks for letting me know they’re just part of the cave! i tried fire arrows and lighting a fire in the bottom of the cave before realizing they looked somewhat more permanent than other structures. thanks for the help!"
