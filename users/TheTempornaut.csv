confessions,fdexi8q,t3_ekzrqr,1578348685.0,It sounds to me that you're not glad she's dead as much as you are happy you're free to live the life you wanted. I'm sure you'd be infinitely happier if she were alive and living a good life with her mom as a non drug addict. Don't be harsh on yourself.
ketorecipes,fdejt0i,t1_fdehrwa,1578340533.0,"My question exactly. I'm sure it can if you saute the garlic and chicken first, then add the rest of the ingredients.   
Here is an artichoke dip that is similar... all you'd have to add is the chicken and get rid of some of the extra cheeses.

snakediet,fd7r4me,t1_fd5dh8i,1578208789.0,Aha thank you very much. Mystery solved.
snakediet,fd5cvge,t1_fd4f33g,1578176372.0,"You seem very knowledgeable. Can I ask, what does ""get the fat in ya"" mean in terms of fasting / re-feeding?"
progresspics,fcyy1y7,t1_fcyrnyl,1578089604.0,Oooo the plot (eyebrow) thickens. Thank you so much for that.
progresspics,fcynp1o,t1_fcyjmuk,1578083457.0,"Thank you so much for the tips - I didn't even know eyebrow powder existed. Once again, truly wonderful and inspirational progress, and sorry if it seemed like I made this about your stunning eyebrows. All the best to you."
progresspics,fcy4d8x,t1_fcxp245,1578074558.0,">I was looking for a comment on your brows to first of all tell you, you look amazing and indeed like Denise Richards. CONGRATULATIONS. And secondly... what's the brow secret - they look just as amazing !!!"

ketogains,fcu4cea,t3_eijt3k,1577972234.0,"Reach my goal weight using a combination of OMAD Keto, 48-hour and 72-hour fasting. Once my goal weight has been achieved do 5 days OMAD Keto, 1 day FREE (including carbs) and 1-day Fasting. And more non-weight related. Good luck and perseverance to everyone."
offmychest,fcnade5,t1_fcn8xts,1577807307.0,Your question was fair and in no way judgemental or prick-ish. It's been very hard on both of us. I just live in hope that the effort and the fight will be worth it in the end. Thank you for your kind words.
offmychest,fcn8g4i,t1_fcn30fe,1577805965.0,"At the time, yes it was no quality of life. After 3 months he started getting better and now he is much better. He can hear and smell well. He can see well enough to run around and not bump into anything. He recognises me and those close to him. He eats with gusto. And gets very happy when his friends come over. He is full of energy again. His level of consciousness is still compromised but my hope is that in time he will get better with the supplements and cleansing and love that I am giving him.  The level of the drug that poisoned him is still very high in his blood as it comes out of his organs, so there is hope. You know, if it was his own nature that caused the problems I would have considered euthanasia, but I refused to let a doctor's mistake and arrogance mark his end. We are both very stubborn."
offmychest,fcmu2u1,t3_ehyc7q,1577792306.0,"I know your anger. I have a little pug that had seizures every few months caused by hypothyroidism. One night he had some clusters and I took him to the top emergency clinic. They decided to change his meds and misunderstood the dosage. They poisoned him. He was left tetraplegic, blind, deaf, no sense of smell, highly aggressive and complete loss of memory and on the doorstep of a coma. The clinic denied him dialysis when I told them their mistake and only much later acknowledged it when it was too late. This was 4 months ago. I have fought day in day out to save him. He is doing better but has many deficits as the drug is still in his system. I have not slept more than 5 hours a night because he has night time agitation. He wees everywhere at least 20 times a day because he has polyuria and can't remember to go outside. I know your anger. He was perfectly healthy, active and happy. Now he's a shadow of himself and very sad. God do I know your anger. I'm sorry for your experience and pain.

Edit: spelling"

snakediet,fck6iab,t1_fcjnaqw,1577717966.0,Thank you... nice & simple.
snakediet,fck6hmz,t1_fcjnhli,1577717952.0,"Thank you so much, that makes perfect sense!!! My first fast, therefore, was 62 hours and not the 48 hours I originally thought! And thanks for the clarity about the 48-hour fasts example. I guess the easiest way is to use an app and that way you can't 'cheat' yourself. Thanks gain!"

This is quite a good resource. Don't think it mentions the garlic but I know that as a Greek - you should be able to just search asclepius + garlic"
GreekMythology,fci642v,t3_eh9zyc,1577658202.0,Zeus struck and killed Aclepius with lightning because his healing power had reached the point of raising the dead thereby worrying Pluto. Where he was struck down garlic was formed.
pugs,fc3sov6,t3_efyht0,1577397636.0,Run... save yourself. Just leave the fridge door open.

But seriously, I think that's kinda sweet to let her sleep first. Just make sure to cover her with something else. Sharing is caring after all."
