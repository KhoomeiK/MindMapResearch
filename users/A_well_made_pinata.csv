It used to be pristine and completely untrammeled, I guess that’s the problem with providing more access. Did you have anything to do with cutting the trail up to Point 5150? It used to be little more than a game trail, now it’s pretty well defined, someone did a nice job on it."

The venue is at the Round House off of MLK. A newish MTB club “Lost Dog Chain Breakers” will have a booth set up doing a membership drive, you could come out and talk to them. There’s like 150 racers so there’ll be a bunch of people hanging around the venue. If you’re interested bring $5 for parking, race starts at 0700 or 0800, podium in the earlyish afternoon. I’ll be the big dude manning the kegs, come say hi."

I’ve been inside of it once, I think someone was trying to get me to join, but they’re not allowed to ask you to join so, he took me on a short tour. I’m sure I just saw what the public is allowed to see, it was really nice inside, kind of what you’d expect. There were some people doing paperwork and some just hanging out. My guy was there to take care of some Shriner business so I met some Shriners."

You’re going to want something between 2500 and 3000 kelvin to equal a soft white light. The very bright whites are going to be up around 4000-5000 K. Also, doesn’t really matter, just a fun fact; in the electrical world, LED, fluorescent and other types of “bulbs” that require a specific voltage to function are referred to as “lamps”."
ElPaso,fcvwkgp,t3_ej3rri,1578011726.0,"There was a point a good number of years ago when it would not have been advisable. The cartel wars had destabilized the city to almost lawlessness. While it’s still probably not as safe as it was before the wars, it’s plenty safe for a day trip. Even if you’re a US citizen you’ll need a passport to get back into the US or you’ll have to fill out some paperwork at the border. I don’t live in El Paso anymore but I’m currently in town for the holidays. I’ll be headed over the border to hit a pharmacy before I head home, I like to cross at the Columbus, New Mexico port of entry. There’s a restaurant and knick knack shop , liquor store and pharmacy all within two small blocks. I don’t have a passport so it’s easier for me to cross at a small port of entry. Also the Pancho Villa state park is in Columbus, I recommend checking it out if you’re there."
