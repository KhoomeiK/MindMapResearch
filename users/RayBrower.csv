I pretty much just ban bots."
redditrequest,ff645ow,t1_ff628xn,1579618677.0,"Relax bro it's all good. I'm not trying to steal anything. This sub is the official reddit process for requesting abandoned subs. With only 1 post in the last year and no recent activity from you it looked like the sub had been abandoned, and, as someone that was very interested in Pepper back in the day I just wanted to make sure it didn't fall into the wrong hands. I have been subbed to r/WhereIsPepper since it's inception. Just trying to preserve a piece of reddit history man.

Since you are still active I'll withdraw my request(as it wouldn't be approved anyway), but you should really consider adding another mod for prosperitys sake."

This happens a lot more than people think. People just assume that they are far enough away from a train but there are stairs, handrails, handles, latches, etc that stick way out from the train. Doesn't take much to get you."
