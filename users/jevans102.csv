woahdude,fe34czj,t1_fe2rf11,1578845828.0,"Not OP, but I sometimes do something similar just for code readability since lines directly before or after have a similar increment. The compiler knows to ignore it so there should be no performance impact at all."

Make sure you've gone through all of these steps, if necessary: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/DBX/latest/DeployDBX/MigratefromDBConnectv1

If you want to verify that it is a Python 3 issue, try a fresh install with identical versions to see if you can compare to an equivalent database."

homelab,fdcg9me,t1_fdccdh8,1578274160.0,What about the scenario where you buy a new / unused product that's been on the shelf for a year? It had the latest update a year ago but now does not - regardless of any warranty or support plan.

recruitinghell,fdc277a,t1_fdc14tr,1578265640.0,"Yes, there are similar requirements outlined in the wiki. However, the wiki also has a deep dive into it's fraudulent use and additional follow-up laws to prevent misuse, and there's no recent data for fraud (and like I said, I couldn't find a recent, reliable source either)."
magictricksrevealed,fdavmhs,t3_ekdbx8,1578250809.0,"1. Lol at the first useless comment.  
2. I don't know, but I've always been pretty confident that these types of tricks are done with sealed but easily breakable packets (water, salt, whatever). In this video, the initial pour is tiny and appear to 100% fall to the ground so that part is moot. The vast middle of the trick is also distraction - he obviously has nothing in his hands. Before the finale, he touches many things with that hand - beard, collar, rolled up sleeves. On top of that, it's a really small amount - even less than he originally poured. Palming a water packet that small would be pretty easy for even an amateur."

recruitinghell,fd8a3kp,t1_fd7gm68,1578215749.0,"I can't find a reputable article, but no one has mentioned what I'd call ""Fake H-1B job posts"". 

H-1B visas allow US companies to temporarily bring foreigners into the country for work. Part of the requirement is proving that doing so is necessary as no domestic employees are willing or able to perform the job. Naturally, this creates a loophole allowing companies to post job listings which ""can't be met"" (no one accepts the brutal pay or the company just claims no one wants the job) allowing them to pay less with reduced benefits.

For the record, I have nothing at all against foreigners. I'm just expanding on the comment I'm replying to about government requirements. I'm also no expert on the subject.

homemaking,fd82h1u,t1_fd3g2tw,1578213144.0,"YMMV. I tried this once on the lowest settings, and it destroyed them. If you're going to go for it, at least put them in those washer bags and hang dry. I think that may have saved mine."
YouShouldKnow,fcw0sk1,t1_fcvoj90,1578014508.0,Agreed. I would assume most are hobbyists that do it more for the adventure and possibly a fee for the time.
IllegalLifeProTips,fctsc5m,t1_fcrsrad,1577956949.0,Genuine question. Why would the police care? I would assume based on my own experience and similar things on Reddit that the police are not funded enough to even acknowledge anything about a potential $20 theft
