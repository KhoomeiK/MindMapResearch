Wouldn't this be illegal? What websites are there where I can buy them?"

I'm hoping to get on medication again soon, but I'll probably be prescribed more garbage SSRIs. Can't even get a psychiatrist to listen to me."

socialanxiety,fd6akl6,t3_ejs2xv,1578188042.0,"I feel like this, except I'm black. I've lived in the suburbs my entire life but don't feel comfortable around white people. I think many of them are judging me and applying negative stereotypes to me. I know logically it's bullshit, and I live in a pretty progressive area and have barely ever experienced racism, but I can't help but think that a lot of the time. 

Doesn't help that I've basically been told told I'm inferior my entire life for being black due to every negative statistic and stereotype, or that I must be ugly, fat, and manly because I'm a black woman. I know most stereotypes don't apply to me, but it doesn't make me feel any better."

I don't care about some random kid, but I'd feel more embarrassed because kids are assholes with no filters. I'm afraid of criticism and mean looks."

Exactly. Me and my brother have moved out, and she has no power over us anymore. She's started trying to act nice because we're all she has. She sees her power over us slipping away, and this bitch is scrambling Lol. Being completely self reliant is the best thing people with narcissistic parents can do."
socialanxiety,fclo2h5,t3_ehmwkr,1577752338.0,"Your mind goes blank all of the time because of the anxiety. I know I have social skills and can pretty much always think of what to say around people I'm comfortable with, but everyone else I have short replies, bunch of head nods, no smiling.

My mind goes blank and I can't think. I can barely understand what they're saying half the time. It's like my IQ drops 50 points when I'm anxious. I can't even expose myself to situations I hate, because I can't think of anything to say and of course they go badly, and I feel worse."

I wish I could find someone who also has or had social anxiety so they can understand how I feel, but I'll never find that irl that's for damn sure. lol. Only other hope is some dating app, but I'd never put my face out there like that."

raisedbynarcissists,fclkrco,t3_ehjc2r,1577750079.0,">because the grass looks greener on the other side. It's not.

Except it actually was in my family. My gc siblings weren't beat, screamed at, or criticized their entire childhood and because of that they can function well as adults and accomplish what they wanted, meanwhile I can barely function. My childhood was stressful as fuck because of her. Meanwhile they were on the sidelines never actually being abused. Now I have so many fucking issues that I feel like I'll never fully heal from, and all my mom can think is ""I told you she was fucked up"" yeah after years of being talked about and treated like a dog. Anyone would be fucked up from that.

I don't believe for one second that the golden child has it as bad as the scapegoat. No amount of ranting will make me believe it."

socialanxiety,fcj50a0,t3_eh1ugz,1577677420.0,"College was the worst 4 years of my life. I couldn't be myself around anyone, and I couldn't relax or focus when my roommate was in the room. Plus we didn't have a 24 hour library until my senior year. The only year I could relax was when I didn't have a roommate.

I wished I waited and worked a few years before I went to college. I wasn't ready at all."
raisedbynarcissists,fcc9uft,t3_eh1ore,1577595982.0,"My mom only did that once we all started moving out. She has to or else she knows well cut her ass out of our lives, and she has nobody but us. She no longer has power over us and can't act like the queen of the universe anymore. 

Did your mom start acting like this consistently once you went off to college? If so, it makes sense."
raisedbynarcissists,fcc7z47,t3_egghjh,1577595413.0,"These people haven't know anything but good parenting, so their tiny brains can't comprehend another person not liking their parents.

socialanxiety,fcaq9km,t3_egnwmp,1577574440.0,"Yeah, this is how I feel. I luckily had a few fun periods in my life, but not even close to the fun and care free times most other people have when they're young. I feel like I missed out on so much, and here i am getting old as fuck. I've dated a few guys, but they were never relationships where I was completely comfortable with them."
socialanxiety,fcapotb,t3_egt3px,1577574095.0,"I've been prescribed multiple medications over the years. My psychiatrists have ALWAYS prescribed SSRIs. When I asked for something else, my last psychiatrist gave me useless buspar. I can't even get any decent help when I go in for medication because they always give some variation of the same garbage they've given me in the past. SSRIs always make me extremely lazy and eventually fat. They make me fake happy, and they don't do much for my anxiety. I'd try anything else, but they never prescribe anything like an MAOI or some other type of medication. 

It bothers me when people act like medication is the only way to help yourself. There are so many people like that on reddit. I've been downvoted for saying that eating clean and regularly doing hard exercise helped me tremendously, better than any ssri. They'll respond with the r/thanksimcured shit. Also, not all depression or anxiety comes from biological abnormalities. It depends on the person. Depression could definitely be due to environment. I most likely wouldn't be in such shitty moods if I didn't have life crippling social anxiety that has me in a mental prison. 

I'm definitely not saying don't use medication, but I'd personally rather not rely on it for the rest of my life. I want medication so that I can expose myself to situations I feel like I can't go in now. Then learn the skills to be able to function in these situations and eventually taper off of the medication. 

I'd say everyone should try it if they think they need it, but it's not the only way to get better."
socialanxiety,fcanoj9,t3_egtqlt,1577572874.0,"There's nothing specific that caused it, just years of constant criticism from my mom. She'd talk shit about me like a dog to other people when I was within earshot all of the time during my childhood. As a kid, I'd ask her to stop talking badly about me. Instead of doing that, she'd deny it and say she was talking about something else. She'd literally gaslight me my entire life and act like I was getting mad for no reason. Then she'd say ""she's throwing a fit again"" to the person she was talking to on the phone. I was ""throwing a fit again"" because she was talking shit about me. My mom has absolutely no self awareness or empathy AT ALL. 

To this day she still does it when I visit. I literally can not visit for a few days without hearing her talking shit about me in some way shape or form. 

I distinctly remember as a kid thinking that I don't talk to other people because they're probably mean like my mom."
raisedbynarcissists,fcalv9v,t1_fc66yta,1577571818.0,">She had no one to put the shit on since I was gone, so she turned to him.

This is kind of what happened when I left for college. My brother (the golden child) had to deal with her BS since he was alone with my mom, and he finally realized she's nothing but a trouble maker. My brother is a chill person, but after years of getting along they started arguing all of the time. My mom can't have a peaceful household. She has to create drama and arguments.

I remember months during my college break she called him saying that I ordered pizza without giving her any and tried to make him feel bad for her. Then he immediately asked ""what did you do?"" Lol. That's when I realized he finally saw through her bullshit. Of course her response was ""nothing. I didn't do anything"" in reality she threw a delusional fit and smashed my groceries in the sink earlier that day. 

For YEARS my brother believed her bullshit. But once she had nobody else to focus her hateful energy on, he had to deal with her shit."

raisedbynarcissists,fc5c7mn,t1_fc5b7e4,1577452973.0,"Yup, my mom did this with extended family my entire life too. She'd always tell them how terrible I was when I wasn't, and would just make shit up. Then she'd tell me all of the mean things they'd say about me. Growing up I hated them because of it. I never realized until I was a teen that she was just manipulating us. 

My grandmother lived with us for a summer in my teenage years, and we were getting along well. Most parents would be glad. What does my mom do in response to my grandmother and I having a good relationship? She tried to break up our relationship and turn us against each other because she hates her mom and apparently couldn't stand that we had a good relationship."

socialanxiety,fbbwee1,t3_ecf4yg,1576709639.0,"My advice is to not even talk to these people about your anxiety, because 95% of the time they will say something stupid because they can't understand it.

Half the time I've opened up to people without it, they downplay it and act like it's easily cured or they have it too when they fucking don't. My stupid mom literally said ""I had social anxiety, and I still had friends."" When I told her I couldn't even function at college because of it. I feel like I can't even talk at work or school, and I've been like this my entire life."
