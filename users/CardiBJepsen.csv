RBI,fdj2lk2,t1_fdi30b7,1578456813.0,"They said in a comment once that they get the consent of other living people who were involved (if it’s a crime scene). If the victim has no known relatives, they ask whoever is authorized. From what I remember, this was their reply to a question about their worst clean-ups and the page said they wish they could show some of their best work, but they were not given consent to post some of those. 


Idk man, I don’t really want to judge a book by its cover."

RBI,fdhp8fs,t1_fdhnv7t,1578427418.0,"Oh it’s because their whole page keeps getting reported by random people due to their content. I bet it’s been a pain in the ass because they’ve had the page for quite some time now and the page is on the verge of being taken down completely. It’s also set to private so that their content won’t come up in the featured photos on Instagram. 


Anyway, it’s not really that big of a deal. It was just a suggestion and OP can choose whether they ignore or actually be interested in this particular company and what they offer."
