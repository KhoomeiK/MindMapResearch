But little did I know how much of an impact it would have made on my life, the changes it would bring along with this new found information. The reality of life that I had been missing out on in my decades of living

It all started with the introduction to one of the most hyped up characters in the history of One Piece. I'm not much of an anime fan, but i did learn to like One Piece enough to sit through a couple hundred episodes. It started out as a background noise for me, but soon I started to enjoy it enough to actually watch it. But I'm not a big enough of a fan to read the manga, which was the start of my journey into learning the truth behind mochi.

And so because I didn't read the manga, I was left behind when it comes to the One Piece story. And soon all the post were about this guy who was said to be the strongest character yet, and his power? Mochi. Of course I had never heard of mochi before, I figured it was like coffee of something. And this only marked the beginning of my dive into what is known as mochi.

The guys name was Katakuri, not to be confused with fried squid. He's this really tall guy and he covers his face with one of those furry scarf things that fancy rich girls use in the movies, the one that look like a raccoons tail. He had a devil fruit power that turned his body into Kochi. He could also make mochi circles appear out of the air and he could make fist come out if them to punch people. And turn himself into a giant wheel of mochi to drive around.

So as the show continued week by week I was forced to piece together what mochi was based of what the show said and what the fans of the show would say on reddit. (Rather than just googling it). And as the fight between Luffy and the mochi man came to a conclusion I was left with only one conclusion, it just some Japanese donut or something."

trees,fdft6ff,t1_fdfqrpy,1578369582.0,"Just do what I did. At the restaurant I work at our mild sauce is literally just Frank's red hot and a bunch of margarine. That's actually where I got the idea. Margarine, from what I understand, is basically just butter. So I did 1 part cannabutter, 3 or 4 parts Tiger Sauce and a spoonful of margarine(just incase). It still has a little bit of it's kick, but it doesn't linger at all. Everyone I've given it to loves it, plus it's pretty potent."
trees,fdfqfjj,t1_fdfk7vc,1578367721.0,I would recommend it if you like spicy sauces. I'm no chef so I can't really recognize flavors. Buts it's like a sweet heat.
trees,fdfjlgh,t3_el4iku,1578363226.0,"I was going to do this yesterday, but they don't want pictures on Sunday. And as I was doing it this morning I got called in to work.

You guys ever try tiger sauce mixed with cannabutter? The sweet heat of the sauce did an excellent job at covering the taste of the butter. The flavor seemed to bond well with it, masking it so you almost don't even notice."

trees,fd2sk0c,t1_fd2n0wl,1578151271.0,"Ya I read if you don't grind it up it will take longer, but you can get more THC. Where as grinding it up will take shorter, but you lose some from handling it.  So I thought if everyone did there job it would be ready by about now(I was going for 8 hours).

That's part of why I was worried. They aren't big buds, but they aren't a powder either so I was worried about the core of those buds now that they have had time to absorb the butter."
trees,fd2l8kw,t1_fd2hsua,1578148812.0,"Ok thank you. That's what I thought. But I was just worried that it would settle weird with the buds inside and fuck up the way it worked. Since in the original recipe the bud only got added when it was dry and the butter was already hot. Now the buds are soggy and a big mess so I wasn't sure if it would fuck with the way it separated.

It cooked from 1-4 at the right temp. It was barely warm when I plugged it back in at 7, so I assume it was sitting for a few hours. So I was thinking 6 more hours. I've read of people cooking it for up to 3 days, so as long as we watch the temp and it doesn't go over 220 we don't have to worry about over cooking it right?

6 hours to help it reach temp again, and to help it re separate the stuff that got absorbed into the bud when it cooled."
trees,fd2iec5,t1_fd2ehju,1578147689.0,"My gf shut it off. My friend sleeping in is why it was off for anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 hours. And I'm at fault even since I never actually told my gf. I never told her the process of making it, just that we were doing it. I assumed she made the connection that I went out and bought a slow cooker with her and was talking about making butter. But she didn't realize they were connected. So when she woke up and smelled the strong odor she assumed it was burning and somebody just forgot. I mean she woke up a couple times during my watch and asked when I was coming to bed, so she knew I had been up for 4 hours doing something.

So I wish she would have woke me up or something and asked before acting. But at the same time I wish my room mate woke up on time so this could have been noticed sooner. If he woke up on time then it would still have been hot since it would have been off for at max 1 hour(and that's only if she got up as soon as I laid down). And I wish I properly explained it to her instead of just assuming.

It was a rough wake up, but according to a poster everything should be fine so we all just put it behind us. It was mainly a ""did we just completely waste 2 ounces?!"" scare."
trees,fd2eezg,t1_fd2djpo,1578146031.0,Cool thank you. We were worried letting it cool then reheating would fuck with the way it seperated.
