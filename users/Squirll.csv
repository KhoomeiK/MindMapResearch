Games,fekln05,t1_fekafo6,1579202614.0,"I feel like delayed games used to be the norm. I remember constantly being bummed by bumped release dates.

But the games were almost always complete on release.

When the fad of preorders took over we saw more and more games released incomplete.

Im kind of hoping this is a shift away from the money grab style of releasing unfinished games. Id rather wait for a complete game than get hurriedly released slop."

NK had such a hardon for nuke capability because it solidified their power. Without nukes theres no real threat from another country deciding to take over.

Plus those with nukes dont want others to have that power."

He drinks to try not to remember. Even in the intro in one season its just a foggy cloud of people, its shown the blackouts in a few episodes.

But now... the intro has him reliving his life and his face seems to react to the situation."

WTF,fbquscw,t1_fbqnlz3,1577035853.0,"Now that I see the whole album its not that crazy.

I generally hesitate to put my face anywhere near a dogs mouth, with the exception of mine.

Sharp teeth, strong jaws... a dog could fuck you up, yet people put their face right up to a dogs and let it kiss them. Its about the relationship and trust in the animal.

If you felt comfortable enough with your friendship to the octopus, who are very intelligent creatures, I could see somebody being comfortable letting it crawl along their body despite the sharp beak.

It's all about knowing the animal."
