Unexpected,ff96ilq,t1_ff93hm5,1579706003.0,This guy was in the SAS - the elite British Special Air Service and then broke his back in a parachuting accident. After recovery he went on to climb Everest. I think we can forgive him a bit of artistic license to show viewers how to deal with hypothetical situations.
nononono,ff81car,t1_ff7tk4t,1579663412.0,Maybe laughing at people dying might have something to do with it.

HTDYL,fdrszvj,t1_fdrrdfa,1578689290.0,"Thanks. Agreed - maybe was being a bit facetious, especially since somebody lost their life, but seriously? Risking your life so recklessly for selfies and social media. You‚Äôre asking to be naturally deselected."

worldnews,fdj1zg4,t1_fdhk7ga,1578456371.0,Especially glad Sir Elton John is able to spare a million bucks. Even though it‚Äôs mere pocket change to him. The ultra elite can do way more - we don‚Äôt need their political speeches - just a tiny portion of their ridiculous wealth.
blackmagicfuckery,fdj0qbz,t3_elm50f,1578455498.0,"Ok. Social media can be overwhelmingly bleak sometimes, but then we are reminded from time to time there are amazing, creative prodigies thinking this stuff up and sharing it with us. Never mind the fact they‚Äôre probably dealing with their own demons maybe. 
Point is, in these dark times, it‚Äôs enough to restore our faith in humanity - a little bit at a time. 
Thank you, fine artists. You make a seemingly bleak world a beautiful place."
