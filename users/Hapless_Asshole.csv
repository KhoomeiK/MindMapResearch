I'm a former volunteer ESL tutor, and used to sorta specialize in Korean women. I was able to break through their shyness and convince them that making mistakes was perfectly natural, and that if anyone laughed at them, that person was a jerk. In return, I learned so much about Korean culture! 

Yep, King Crimson is one of the bands I thought you might never have heard of. Also Gentle Giant. They work a lot of early music sounds in there. For example, the recorder the guy in the bell-bottomed painter's pants is a Renaissance-style model -- no foot joint or flare at the end and a cylindrical, rather than conical bore. Makes it harder to maintain intonation, and has a more ""airy"" sound. The form of the last bit is very contrapuntal, too. 


I've only listened to about half of ""Square Wave,"" but I think I'm already a fan of Jambinai! Thank you for mentioning them to me. They're like the Hanguk version of Gentle Giant."
facepalm,ff2yps6,t1_ff2v9xb,1579528862.0,"Golly -- that's a big question! I actually listen to everything from very early modal music on out. I play recorder, and I play it quite well, actually, and not one of those tacky-assted plastic things, either (though Yamaha makes a good line of plastic recorders -- reliably in tune, and good tone -- that are great for beginners). Therefore, something like this really appeals to me for the patterns: [Bach -- Art of Fugue -- Contrapunctus XIV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVL7x-y8r2k). Counterpoint is so gorgeous, the way it weaves together melodic lines. And I wish to goodness I had the tone of these guys -- the Amsterdam Loeki Stardust Quartet. I've seen 'em play, and was torn between practicing four hours a day, and just burning my horns out of despair.

(An aside: Tchaikovsky had syn. He chose his keys and harmonies according to color. Leonard Bernstein had it, too. Closing his eyes as he conducted was not an affectation -- it helped him key into who was missing their entrances, or whatever.)

But boy, do I love to rock! I mean, shake the house down. I'm old, so my tastes run more toward the Stones, Janis, Led Zeppelin, Talking Heads, and a lot of 70s weird shit you've probably never heard of. I also love the subtlety of Brian Eno's ambient music.

I have a niece who is a DnB producer. I've listened to quite a few of her tracks. On about the third one, I finally closed my eyes, quit seeking linearity, and enjoyed the complex textures. Bingo! It's ultra-high-tech Dead-style jam. But I don't tell her that -- she thinks jam is hopelessly passe.

The patterns in Asian music are phenomenal. They really do evoke the same sort of visuals that actually sitting and listening to nature produces. 

Damn, but I do run on! You kinda hit a trigger (a good one, for once) with those questions! I understand that a light dose of shrooms will produce similar effects. I wouldn't know the difference, I don't think, except that maybe I wouldn't be able to ""filter"" the visuals as well."

Okay, here's a story from a long time back.  My husband and I both graduated from OSU. My stepdaughter is in the OSU Alumni Band, and for many years was with Hyper Unit, which meant that she went *everywhere* and did *everything*. If you saw an Alumni Pep Band anywhere during Michigan week, Martha was there. I mean, when she went for job interviews and got down to benefits negotiations, she always led with, ""I have to have Michigan week off."" She was that into it. This all meant that my sweetie and I were invited to all the Alumni Band tailgates, and got to use her tickets to the Alumni Game.

One year, the Alumni Game was vs. y'all. When we went to the Skull Session and the 110 played, I was just *knocked out*. The arrangements are phenomenal, and the band just rocked. It was a real treat to see two such different bands play. 

I'm not a big rah-rah Buckeye fan by any stretch. I'm originally from NC, and wound up at OSU almost by chance, but the Quad Script Ohio at every alumni game halftime has always been a rush. It's even more of a kick when you can pick out individuals in their red shirts (""There's Martha, and Barb on eefer...""), and you know a lot more about how hard they worked to get into TBDBITL, as well as how hard they continue to work (and play -- in many senses) in AB."
