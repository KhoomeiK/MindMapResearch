The impact of a 1% difference is truly significant. The [Department of Labor explains it this way](http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/publications/401k_employee.html): One worker with 35 years until retirement puts $25,000 into a retirement account and earns a market average of 7%. She pays fees equal to 0.5%.

Another the same age does the same thing but pays fees of 1.5%.

How does that work out? The first worker enters retirement with $227,000. The second has just $163,000 — roughly one-third less money!"

You really can't see class interests can you?

Every dollar that goes to wages instead of profits for shareholders impacts the market. 

Your wages used to be tied to your productivity. The more productive you were. The more money you were paid in wages. In the 70's that stopped. So despite being almost 3 times more productive a worker today than you would have been in the 70's. Your real wages are on par with what they were in the 70's. The resulting profits your extra productivity created still exist. You just don't get them. That's the main issue. An issue that is not solved by you putting whatever pennies you were permitted to keep into a fee intensive leech on the market whose only benefit to you is a tax break that is just a gamble on what the tax rate is when you retire."
