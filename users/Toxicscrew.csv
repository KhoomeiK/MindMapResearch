The reason 3 day waiting periods were implemented were to stave off crimes of passion and suicides, and it works.  It infringes 0% on anyone’s rights.  

Missouri has a law that all handgun permits had to be reviewed by the sheriff of county that the purchaser lived in.  They reviewed the person history that may not have been reported to the FBI.  Not everything is-such as being committed to a mental institution or suicidal behavior, but if the local police were called that is on their records.   The law came up for review and the GOP controlled legislature let it expire.  The result was a near immediate 16% increase in gun deaths.
