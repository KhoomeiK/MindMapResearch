I kinda knew from the beginning that he wasn't right but there was a lot of manipulation and I felt guilty and responsible for him. I was dumb, naive. It was a miserable marriage, he was an addict and didn't work, all kinds of problems. Found out about his affair, immediately told him we were over and he could be her problem now. And that was it. It's been several years now, haven't had anyone for more than a couple months since then.

todayilearned,fefbcbl,t1_fefauug,1579052569.0,"From what I've seen, most of the articles indicate they are from legal locations, especially like the Alps. What's killing them is unpredictable wind shifts, wind shears, lack of control. What's so deadly is that it's not just new, inexperienced and unfit jumpers that die, veteran jumpers die too, for example just from the wind turning and smashing them on a cliff. 

I'm no expert on this subject or anything, just read about it before. It's interesting. The thrill must be amazing, it's the closest a human gets to flying. But it's so dangerous. It can go wrong in just a second."
