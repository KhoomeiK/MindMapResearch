MyChemicalRomance,ffaqx53,t3_eskpah,1579742399.0,"i dont know man.. the black parade was such an amazing thing they created. my sister and i went to a concert in TN  to see them, i worked so hard to get a good grade so i could take her and wow.. it was amazing. I was a big fan, but my sister she knew every word to every song. seeing her light up the way she did when he rose up off that hospital bed, almost made me cry. As a brother seeing her so f\*cking happy to see her idles to see them play to jump around and sing their songs with them... the joy it brought me is just too much to put into words. I love you Elisabeth!! 

But back to what the question at hand, I think he was ""satisfied"" but if anyone knows him, you know he's a Genius, and hes got to be more then just Satisfied. I really hope they bring TBP back, because it was just such an amazing show/album/work or art. I think my superfan sister would agree totally."

People aren't walking around TRYING to hurt people for fun and excitement (most of us arent.
