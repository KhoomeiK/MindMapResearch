I would have loved an aunt that told me I could be a strong independent woman all on my own. Perhaps I wouldn't have been divorced at 26. Now, I don't think Aunt should have told niece that all men are scum, but mom could have navigated that, too; ""Hey daughter, just so you know, Aunt Jane had a few bad relationships and is jaded when it comes to men and relationships. Not all men are scum."""

MakeupAddicts,fdhop84,t1_fdho1ph,1578427101.0,"Having oily skin does not mean you don't need to moisturize, just means you need to find the proper moisturizer for your skin. Also, if all you're doing is exfoliating, I'd say your skin is oily because of the over-exfoliation. The ELF is a decent primer, but it is so loaded with silicone (I counted 6 separate silicones) it isn't doing much for actual moisturizing purposes. My HG moisturizer is FAB Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream (1 measly silicone). I use 2-3 pumps morning and night. Moisturizer is such a personal preference, I strongly urge you to try a few out. If you live close to a Sephora, they'll give you samples of what you want to try."
MakeupAddicts,fdhma2e,t3_elflfm,1578425655.0,"To me, your skin looks dehydrated and your foundation is clinging to those patches. Do you moisturize before applying foundation? The comment with your routine says you only moisturize at night. I would *highly* recommend moisturizing prior to foundation application. It will help with your dry spots and your foundation won't look as cakey."
SkincareAddiction,fdhgixt,t3_eledmz,1578422164.0,"Haha, yes you're being a bit dramatic :) Dark, thick Mexican hair checking in, totally get what you mean when you say there are areas you can't shave. For me, the biggest difference in no razor burn is made when I have a new/good razor, and when my skin is exfoliated prior to shaving. My last piece of advice: I know this process sucks, but stick with it. Not shaving and not having hair for people to stare at has been one of the biggest game changers in my life."

At a random family dinner when he was 6, he asked 'why is wheredidalfgo's dad my grandpa?' and he was told his story then. I knew it was going to happen, I just thought it was going to be when he was 14, or old enough to understand. We thought we had time to discuss it as a team. As it turns out, a 6 year old's mind could completely comprehend. He told me 'I know you're mom, and I know you love me because you kiss me all the time.' That's all that mattered to him."
