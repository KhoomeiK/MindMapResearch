It is a nice room though. The bed looks comfy."

But someone has confirmed that I was wrong. It is the symbol for cancer."

booksuggestions,ff1hng2,t3_er4omw,1579479379.0,"Career of Evil switches back and forth between the detectives and the killer. More emphasis on the detectives though. And it's the 3rd book in a series. Probably not the best recommendation, but it's the only one I can think of right now."

If I'm wrong I accept that. Don't care enough to look it up."
ABoringDystopia,fewmecj,t1_fewlmkp,1579414578.0,"It's their own family I feel sorry for. Never being there for the tough times. Never bothering with the good times. I would think it's hard to have any sort of relationship with someone like that. 

What's bad is money probably isn't the issue. Most places offer bereavment pay and sick days. So I mean what is it? Pride? No one is impressed."
ATBGE,fewkwmo,t3_eqofzc,1579413050.0,I'd like it if it wasn't for the vomit. That's where I draw the line.
ABoringDystopia,fewkona,t1_feweyan,1579412836.0,"My brother worked at a as a temp factory and his wife had been diagnosed with cancer or precancer or something. I didn't really understand when she explained it to me. But anyway, my brother asked for a day off to take her to the doctor for the procedure and the manager told him it was either his job or his wife. So of course he chose his wife and ended up losing his job. So fucked up. I don't understand the work over family mentality.


My sister in law is fine now if anyone was wondering."

Journaling,feoxyp0,t3_eq6u67,1579307812.0,I like the blue bic gelocity pens. I do 90% of any writing with them. I got my boyfriend obsessed with them too.
books,femcqpt,t3_epe6bn,1579248882.0,"I read this book in December because I wanted to read a Christmasy book. I loved it. Definitely one of the best books I've read in awhile. 


I see talk of the series on here. My two cents is I hate the series.  They changed way too much and I think it made it horrible and boring. But did like that Maggie plays a bigger role."

gravityfalls,fefguxd,t3_eorhx3,1579056045.0,I'd like to see a spin off of the Pines brothers going on adventures. Or Soos running the mystery shack.

I haven't spent a lot of time on the website, so I don't know if it has the type of information you're wanting.

I just think novels would be better during our long waits between games."

booksuggestions,feeahl1,t1_fed776d,1579029749.0,I've read that. Cracked me up. Have you read her other book Furiously Happy? It's hilarious as well.
booksuggestions,feea6gz,t1_fed2qal,1579029570.0,I have read that. And this book is full of spiders. I love the whole series. Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits was good as well. I think the sequel is supposed to come out this year. I might be wrong though.
booksuggestions,fee9km9,t1_fedezt9,1579029214.0,I wish they would come out with more novels. There is so much lore. They could do so much.
booksuggestions,fecma5q,t1_feclw5f,1578977426.0,I have heard really good things about it.  Is it a novel? I thought it was a collection of essays. Either way it has been my list to read eventually.

Either way I think that's an adorable name for them."
Reno,fd92wp3,t3_ekcfaj,1578227626.0,"You could try Foodmaxx in Sparks. I don't think they're quite as cheap as Aldi, but I like it. It's the closest thing I've found so far. A lot of their store brand stuff tastes better than Aldi's in my opinion."

technicallythetruth,fd2j8ff,t1_fd2h67g,1578148016.0,Nope. Religion was just something I never latched onto.
technicallythetruth,fd26csm,t3_ejvhsz,1578142388.0,From my understanding Satan is supposed to be in Hell suffering with all of the sinners because he rebelled against God. He's not the one doing the punishing nor is he like the supreme ruler of Hell. Then to kind of continue the rebellion he also tries to turn people away from God. At least that's what I was told as a kid. I don't know how much of the Bible backs up that theory or if it even backs it up at all. I decided I was an atheist as a kid and never bothered to look it up.

But what i'm saying is her only stipulation was for her to get 70% of his daily income. She didn't say how often. Who wouldn't want 70% Jeff Bezos' daily income even just once a year?"

books,fcv9r5j,t1_fcv97gv,1577997597.0,I also highly recommend Locke and Key. It's a graphic novel so if you don't like it at least it was a quick read.
AnimalsBeingJerks,fcv74ll,t1_fcv661g,1577996025.0,No I have two cats. I disagree with science. I will admit my cats are nicer to humans than they are to each other. I swear they get some kind of nourishment from tormenting one another.

books,fcthx5k,t3_ei8g6j,1577943855.0,"It will only become tedious if you make it that way. Don't over complicate it and just keep making adjustments as you see fit. Eventually you will fall into your own style of journal writing and everything will be fine. Unless you find you just don't like journaling. Which is fine too. There are several apps and websites that let you keep track of book and thoughts. Just keep trying new things until you find something that suits you.


There's a simple app I like to use called Book Catalogue. I use it to keep track of I own so I don't have end up buying it again, but there is an area to write down some quick thoughts on the book. It might not be th best for notes, but it depends on what you're looking for."
books,fcthh55,t3_eigd0d,1577943424.0,"Could it be your expectations were too high for you to ever enjoy the book? I've done that to myself. I'll get all hyped up about something and it just didn't compare to what I had built it up to in my head. It still might have been good, but I'll still feel disappointed because it wasn't as good as I had imagined.


I've loved everything by Joe Hill I've read. I haven't read Heart Shaped Box though, so I don't know about it. And I can't stand Stephen King novels, so I am glad Joe Hill has a different style than his dad.

Maybe you could try reading NOS4A2? I could feel a little bit of his father's influence in that book."
ATBGE,fcn053m,t3_ei19ck,1577799330.0,I like it. Super creative idea to display toilet paper and it looks very well made. I'd buy toilet paper from that mannequin.
