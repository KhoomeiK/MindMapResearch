AskAstrologers,fe2coe6,t1_fe29oz4,1578836898.0,"If you're comfortable with it, perhaps a simple ""thinking of you!"" Or ""hope your day is running smoothly"", or some simple but complimentary text just to see how things roll from there would work?

As a Taurus (and I know we're all different in different aspects), if we're interested, YOU WILL KNOW, somehow, even through subtlety. We'll check in on you (somehow, even if it's new and even if we may be shy or nervous). 

I don't know if he's as big a stickler for scheduling as I am, but if the plan was already essentially established for tomorrow, include a mention of it he's still down after the initial text (like in the same text though, lol); If it wasn't established, initiate the first text, see how he responds, and then bring it up. He may be down for tomorrow, or he may request a different date. 

I tried not to be *too* personal with this response, and just keep in mind what the general ""me"" (and others I've known) as a typical bull would appreciate and/or do in this situation, without projecting or winging off any insecurities. 

The wonderful thing about texting is we're no longer in the days of dial-up and chat rooms where BRB or anything is necessary! We can get back to each other as the schedule allows! He'll likely tell you if he's busy, but will get back to you, or simply respond, so I don't think timing matters too much, unless you're concerned (in which, mentioning that super briefly may be sweet). Haha. 

Sorry, that got long, but I was really trying to think it out for/with you. Unless he's an absolute dirtbag (in which, SHAME, fellow bull, back to the pen with ye!), he won't simply ghost or blow you off and will be honest in his response. (I'll have to re-look at your initial post to see your sign as well, but I believe they were relatively compatible; you may just be more ""get up and go"" than him to an extent. Lol)


Edit; Oh, Capricorn! I love thee! Capricorn are likely my most favorite, so maybe I'm biased, but I would love to see some more blossoming! Although, yes, you've definitely got a higher, more immediate drive than he likely will. (we're slow burners. Haha)"
astrology,fe28tsx,t3_eniluh,1578835725.0,"Incredible changes have happened for me (that were very needed); During the day, as usual, I had more energy, but the last couple of days were filled to the *brim* with *majorly* energetic positivity (likely double charged by the changes!)...and then by nightfall, as usually happens, my energy and mood dropped, but *severely*.

So severely, in fact, that last night (and I feel comfortable sharing this here because it won't hinder my purpose or burden anyone in the space/people ""I'm"" currently of use too), I experienced, what I believe to have been my final ego death. The person that was ""me"" is no longer. I grieved; Essentially had a funeral and ""died"" (it sounds cheap now, writing it out, but it was so...incredible in a variety of different ways)...But, I am awake now and feeling better and more comfortable with the ""death""/epiphany (that has, lifelong, sat there, in the back of my mind), and ready to work on what is calling me to service. 

All in all, very....intense, to say the least.

Right now, though, it feels like I'm hosting my own funeral and am utterly alone in every way in the world.

To begin to arise to what I am supposed to be doing, but do it correctly. Right now it feels like I'll never experience happiness again, but I just have to come to terms with realizing that my happiness is in my rightful position as a dissolving and ever temporary entity in the lives of and for the sole purpose of the lives of others.

I have PTSD and am generally anxious. I do touch her and work with her and talk with her as I'm beginning the reading, and more and more lately have just been essentially letting her speak for herself as I learn more and can compose better. She's been spot on (and loud) at times, so I've come to trust her and what she says when she wants to say something. 

By clearing the cards, do you mean like touch work? Shuffling and talking and asking as I do? Or is there more to it?"
