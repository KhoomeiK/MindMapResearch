writing,fcrkbau,t3_eifi5x,1577902935.0,"For me, my first rule is to just not give presice numbers unless it's absolutely necessary. 

""The case rattled with a half dozen or so of the things.""

 If I must, then I spell it out for counting or quantity.

""I need a hundred and twenty seven of them. I'll pay double if they're here by lunch.""

 I use numbers if it's descriptive.

You'll want to get [something like this](https://www.amazon.com/VIPARSPECTRA-Adjustable-Fixtures-Gardening-Capacity/dp/B010PYWE54/ref=asc_df_B010PYWE54/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=167135477708&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7325131889157412827&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9013144&hvtargid=aud-799728744414:pla-315336738633&psc=1) to hang that light from. That way you can bring it down when you need more light. When you're ready to upgrade your lighting to a professional level, I'd recommend haunting EBay for a Dazor 3-bulb lamp[ like this](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Dazor-lamp-with-3-bulb/152970971857?hash=item239dc7cad1:g:-24AAOSwY3daafQh)."

todayilearned,fc5tdl4,t1_fc5gw5x,1577465446.0,Most the Mustangs I see are being driven by people over 60. Unusually doing about 10 under the speed limit and coming to a full stop before turning into the turning lane.

todayilearned,fbyfy7c,t1_fby5kb4,1577215919.0,"Yeah, anyone could make some x-rays with an old neon transformer and a random bit of tungsten. It would kick off enough radiation to be dangerous, but not much more dangerous than the transformer itself."
dashcamgifs,fbkncf7,t3_eaiwdp,1576952919.0,"If you’re in a wreck with lines down, do not get out of the car unless it’s on fire. Even then do so very carefully. 

Wait for responders to secure the wires before getting out of the vehicle if at all possible. 

I knew a girl that was in a similar wreck. Didn’t get more than a few bumps from the crash, then stepped on a live power line. Killed her instantly."
