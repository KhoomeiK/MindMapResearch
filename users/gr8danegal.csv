raisedbynarcissists,femzfnw,t1_femha15,1579273504.0,"Mine used to say that too, ""Kids are to be seen & not heard"". Teachers would always put on all my report cards- ""She talks to much in class"", I dont really even remember talking that much in class, but never rudely & never interrupted my teachers. At home, no one communicated, EVER. And if there was communication, it was usually the worst assumptions on me."

raisedbynarcissists,fcruhoq,t1_fcqxz5g,1577906777.0,"Yes absolutely in a good way. Learning is always good, even when you wish certain things didn't apply to you (me). I tend to love my abusers & I'm 39. It's so weird to me how I would go to the moon & back for the people who treated me the worst.... Stockholm Syndrome. My goodness. Anyhow, Thank You & Happy New Year😊"
