worldnews,ff8ndcw,t1_ff82jby,1579687232.0,This is not right. If companies can‚Äôt self regulate (which they clearly can‚Äôt) then government needs to step in. People are idiots when it comes to doing the right thing in favour of convenience (have you ever read the terms and conditions on an app? No cause it‚Äôs too hard and who cares right?) Don‚Äôt give people an option to ruin the planet. No more debate. That‚Äôs it. You can argue that people should get options and if that what they choose to buy a polluting product it‚Äôs on them but why? People don‚Äôt have time to think about this shit all day every day. Why allow for a system that will fail and everyone knows it? Stop it at the source before it‚Äôs even made.

worldnews,ff43fu2,t1_ff3rcsv,1579554698.0,Another reason is improved health care. Basically boomers are living longer and working longer. There just aren‚Äôt the same opportunities to move up and be rewarded like there used to be. So no matter how hard you work in your job there will never be a promotion and god forbid a pay rise for good performance.

memes,ff2az8t,t1_ff1zbeh,1579499169.0,r/monkeyspaw. This post gets 10k upvotes but you step on a needle on your way home from work and contract hep b. Your wife won‚Äôt believe you and thinks you got it from that skank Crystal at work. She leaves you with the kids and to make matters worse Crystal plays along and demands you pay child support for her now 3 year old. Your work performance declines and eventually you‚Äôre shown the door. You lose your home and in a last ditch effort for survival you buy a scratch ticket and win the jackpot. With your divorce finalised in two days you decide to wait out cashing in your prize. You end up losing the scratch in a fight with a raccoon over a tuna sandwich you found in the trash.

Convince yourself it‚Äôs over and your new life as a non smoker has already begun. You will go through phases of thinking you have beaten it and it‚Äôs ok to have just one. Nope it‚Äôs not. You only beat smoking when you live the rest of your life without one... so you kinda only win when you die.  Take that smoking!
2meirl4meirl,fem833j,t1_fellgzo,1579243160.0,"The trick is you you can never have a single puff again. Ever. Seems fucking obvious but those leafy bastards will make your brain try ever trick in the book to get you to think it‚Äôs ok to have just one puff. Then BAM. You‚Äôre hooked again.

politics,felg6la,t1_fekwtwz,1579221413.0,I didn‚Äôt read the article but from what I can make from the comments hopefully this guy inspires other executives to follow suit. Essentially lining their own pockets and then making a moral mends by burning what they built. Get heaps of cash and ruin a corrupt industry with one career. Keep in mind if he didn‚Äôt do the job someone else without any conscience at all would have. Kinda like a Trojan horse. I did not read the article.
