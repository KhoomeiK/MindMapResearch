penpals,ff7vtak,t3_erx9yv,1579659552.0,"I see you have many replies already, but if you are interested in being my penpal feel free to DM me at any time.

A fellow notebook hoarder, sticker addict, stationary hoe that loves the idea of exchanging cute letters and often spends way too much time decorating my letters and envelopes, I have lots of postcards from my home state (NJ) I often send with pressed flowers, feathers, and seashells to those who are interested.

I'm a college student, science teacher, plant mom, aquarium/terrarium extraordinaire, lover of all things with fur and scales, assistant to the regional manager at Dunder Mifflin, Inc. with an unhealthy addiction to garbage instant coffee which I rely on to function as a human being."
bulletjournal,ff35qr3,t3_erca6r,1579534323.0,I love this❣ I'm working on a cover page for my aquarium tracker now with my lad Mr. Farenheit.
bulletjournal,fet9bna,t1_fepbod2,1579372917.0,Which is why I veeeeeery carefully go over the pencil exactly with pen.
college,fepiyjn,t3_eq7tk9,1579321704.0,"I suggest you see if it is possible to do these assignments while using the free trial for LCP+. Depending how your professor set up the digital course (i.e., they're set as the first ""unit""), it may be possible."
Teachers,fepipf9,t3_eqbgts,1579321518.0,"I second using a planner. My brother (Aspergers, ADHD, GAD, and just straight up awful at remembering even the simplest things when he doesn't write 'em down) had a similar issue towards the end of elementary/beginning of middle school, especially as he was pushed to rely less and less on his para. The best thing my mama did was buy him a planner to write everything down. She also used it to write notes back and forth with his teacher, who would check his planner every day anyways to make sure he had all his hw written down."
bulletjournal,feozydt,t1_felqplc,1579309061.0,"That's why I usually write out in pencil first, highlight second, and ink third. Otherwise it annoys me so much when I don't highlight the exact space I need. 🙃 

I think I'll definitely try mildliners out on my ginger journal. I haven't used it yet 'cause I don't really like the thicker pages, but it handles most heavy markers so well!"
AquaSwap,felt8ol,t3_epqp1j,1579230361.0,"I'm in 08527 -- too far to drive, but if you're willing to ship lmk; I've got three planted tanks (with a few hitchhiker snails) cycled 'n ready for fish! 

What are your plans for restocking?"
bulletjournal,feljjzu,t1_feic2ag,1579223711.0,"Ugh, I feel you. I love gel pens for their color (and glitter!) buuut between highlighting and being left handed smudg'ums are unavoidable. 😔💦 

How do you like zebra mildliner? I love those colors but I've heard mixed reviews as to if they bleed through the page easily or not."
bulletjournal,feka1nn,t1_feiuvfs,1579195727.0,"D'oh, how could I forget the scientists? 😆 I've always had my trusty Rite In The Rain notebooks  'Rity pens for recording experiments and field notes."

bulletjournal,feh1jni,t1_feguipm,1579107209.0,I feel your struggle. Nothing agitates me more than having to use an inferior pen!
bulletjournal,feh17xk,t1_fegs07s,1579107009.0,FC Finepens are the bomb! I've got 'em in sepia and black.

1200isplenty,fdroasz,t1_fdrc8g3,1578687284.0,I didn't know I needed this until now.
Teachers,fdklhud,t1_fdjvqem,1578506020.0,"Tbh I think many of the SAA cases in my district have more to do with this than trying to do better on their final exams or SATs. 😕 When I've asked adolescents and young adults why they started using, the most common reason is that they found themselves in a position where they were unable to seek professional help due to pride, embarrassment, family values, or financial difficulties and, left without any other option, used it as a means to cope with/repress/heal anxiety, depression, attention-deficit, PTSD, etc.."
Teachers,fdinev8,t3_elj57a,1578446795.0,"In my school district there has been a sudden rise in out ""straight A Aces"" (the slightly neurotic I-need-an-A++-in-everything-or-I'll-be-a-failure, have-a-panic- attack-over-not-being-perfect kind of student) taking drugs with the hope that it'll increase their academic performance. Do you think it might've been something like that?"
bulletjournal,fdh2u1d,t3_ekyrrz,1578414174.0,"I have a very similar setup for all the academic journals and research expedition notes I read for a particular topic -- i.e., I currently have one section for the known distribution of birds in my state, another for ongoing research on the known location of specific species of interest, another for the morphology of raptors, and another the ability of rapotors to cohabitate with humans within urban settlements. I add an additional page where I print out any email correspondence of further discussion with the author(s) that may help me with my own research."
bulletjournal,fdh026e,t3_ekyi8r,1578412423.0,"This is such a good idea. I've not gotten ⚔ or 🛡 yet, but I'm playing Let's Go and have always wanted to create a tracker for a living master  pokédex (I want to catch every pokémon, each of their shiny forms and regional variants, with twice of the previously stated if there is a difference between genders 😉)."
bulletjournal,fdgxm8o,t1_fdgabq4,1578410830.0,"I've found that they're surprisingly easy to refill with the right ink (I've found ""highlighter light"" in koreatown; neon colors taken from pen refills work just as well but some need to be watered down) and a long syringe."
bulletjournal,fdgvny5,t1_fdeal8r,1578409471.0,"I'm adding one to my classroom wishlist ... and another two to my personal wishlist, too. 😆

Teachers,fdcx3xp,t3_eknr6y,1578286875.0,"I'm being ""shipped"" to another student teacher in the building. We're both the easy-to-🍅 type, and our students seems to take this as evidence that we secretly are madly in love with one another but are too shy to declare our feelings to one another."
penpals,fdcuiqb,t3_eko74o,1578284693.0,I'd love to be your next penpal❣ Mobile is being real crummy but I (think) I've dm'd you. 😊
Teachers,fdcsse2,t1_fdcjtxq,1578283297.0,Is that a southern thing? 😂 My mum always said to flush ice cubes down the toilet if you want a snow day. I've only had two students (from Tennessee and West Virginia) tell me they've heard that before; it seems that wearing your PJs inside out and moving your head instead of your hand while brushing their teeth is more common here in NJ.
ScienceTeachers,fdc7hz5,t1_fd9k8q5,1578268615.0,I'll be stealing this example for my kiddos. 😋 I always try to search for two real life applications -- one middle schoolers would be familiar with and one that shows how heckin' rad scientists apply that concept/procedure.
bettafish,fdc26wc,t1_fdao0rf,1578265635.0,Omg I thought the same exact thing!
Aquariums,fd6ampx,t1_fd57yjp,1578188067.0,"From my personal experience with keeping multiple betta community tanks everything u/TrueNameAmended has said is 👌. 

To add my 2¢, neons (and cories) are quite the active little shoaling fish. I believe that anything 10gal+ would be appropriate for either of them as long as they are in groups of 6+ -- but if you one day find yourself addicted to the aquarium hobby and upgrade your 10 to a 20 they'll certainly take full advantage of the additional space!"

college,fczih16,t1_fcysct6,1578101968.0,Thank you and thank you. 🙂 If/when you do 21 credits I'd recommend you take your easier classes together.
Aquariums,fcxtuz7,t3_eizz9n,1578070369.0,"The only place I've seen 5 gal ""longs"" or ""breeders"" is at lab supply stores such as Carolina ... though even on the off chance they're actually in stock they're gonna cost you +$75, compared to the +$28 of their 5.5 gal."

Teachers,fcxmesj,t1_fcw4sgr,1578066429.0,"I second the accordian folder. The sections are great for diving up paperwork by class. I've got two -- one for bringing student work back and forth to grade, and one for handouts and materials for the day."

I hope I can play his favorite ""tune"" (read: any Christmas/Fraggle Rock/ Sesame Street song) but for now he is quite impressed with me stumbling through the chords I know."
college,fcxaqcg,t3_ej7ecp,1578057604.0,"In community college I've managed 21 credits with As & Bs (and one C that I rightfully deserved) -- the classes were easier as most were simple introductory level courses. Transfering to university I took 18-22 credits my first four semesters. Going into this spring semester (and starting student teaching) I'm signed up for 22 credits again but will be dropping down to 12 or 15. I've been so stressed out and physically, emotionally, and mentally exhausted the last two years that I just can't do it anymore."
teaching,fcx8ne9,t1_fcwuwxq,1578055569.0,"This. 👏👏👏 I've had a handful of long term positions at the elementary level, but if it wasn't for being able to subbing I wouldn't have ever realized that I very much prefer upper elementary and middle school."

teaching,fcm53qh,t1_fcm4qgy,1577764468.0,... I can't believe I actually used Gucci like an adjective. This is probably a sign that I need some time away from students.
teaching,fcm4qgy,t3_ehvl0b,1577764196.0,"Google drive (and multiple google accounts) has been my savior. I also back everything up to dropbox but unless google disappears, though I'm sure google isn't going anywhere. 

Every single document I thought might possible be useful one day have been organized by subject and flagged by date.
