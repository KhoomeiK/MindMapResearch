Queue times suck but I'm more than happy to queue 10-20min to get a playable game.

Smurfs can still be a problem, but role queue helped with that too. Plus, as a post on this sub earlier today said, people in general are better at the game now - dealing with them is easier. 

I'm 100% enjoying the game more than I ever have, but the pessimist in me sees so much potential for further improvement."
