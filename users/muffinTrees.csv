PsychologicalTricks,fem5u93,t3_epuzta,1579240809.0,"-Tiered pricing ex. Offer three different price points and market a grade of value you will deliver. You should go into this with the goal of subliminally upselling them to the middle tier. Offer a low priced one a middle priced one and a proportionally greater elite tier.  Naturally they will be drawn to a cheaper offering, but not the cheapest one because they are no fools! The middle one is how they will perceive they‚Äôve made a good decision even though that‚Äôs the one you wanted them to pick afterall. 
Also you don‚Äôt even need much difference In your tiered offerings, just need them to perceive some difference etc. 

Another option is the old 99.99$ trick as it ‚Äúfeels‚Äù like less than 100.00$"
