1. How much should I reduce the orange puree on the first step for the curd?

2. Your instructions mention egg whites, but not the ingredient list. Should I separate all four eggs and just toss half the whites? When do they get put in? And is this one of those things where I can totally ruin the recipe if I over-beat the mixture?

3. How important do you think it is for a tart to sieve the mixture twice? I love pulp in my orange juice, so I wonder if only sifting it once would be similar or if it would ruin the tart.

4. Would this make enough curd to fill a regular store-bought pie crust? I think I would want to save myself half the work for my first time, hah.
