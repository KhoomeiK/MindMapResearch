ThatsInsane,ffaqg4l,t1_ffaajpg,1579742083.0,"> There have been only two verified documented deaths from wild healthy wolves in North America.

There is a reason for that, and why land animal kills on humans is rare (outside of disease and poison).  A lot of people think ""oh, it's a ____, a tough, strong, animal that would fuck people up""  But they don't too often.  When they do it's usually a surprise of sorts.  Mountain lion popping out of no where, gator by water and so on.  It's because people are ridiculously smart compared to any animal, we are absurdly capable too.  We use knowledge in an encounter we are ready for and we can use more because of tools, thumbs and such.  

Sure some animals will fuck your weaponless ass up, you're not taking out a tiger in one on one unarmed combat, or a gorilla.  But 3 wolves, a gator or two, a single black bear, a coyote like that dude this week, a human actively knows what weak spots are and how to harm them.  We don't instinctively go for the throat like a panther, we make a decision.  You still have to physically be able to do what you plan, but humans are way better fighters in nature than many think.  Animals pretty much have no idea how to fight us either for the most part."

This is a massive misconception to the ""game"" of corporate America.  The idea is not to do your work better or more of it, it's to think outside the box and save/create revenue.  

People make the mistake of taking their specific job and doing that job better to get a raise, bu that is what is expected of you. Master YOUR job.  What is not expected of you is what is outside of that little vital document used to give you duties, your job description.  To get a raise you need to go beyond that job description and take on projects that do not fall onto that piece of paper.  That is what gets you the raise.  You have no argument preforming the duties on your job description when asking for a raise or promotion, you were *literally* expected to.  

What you do have an argument with is using your extra time at work, to well, do extra.  Jump in another project, improve a process that creates or saves money, expand your position, or make the position reach out more.  These are things you are not expected to do that when done well and creating more positive cash flow, if you can A) prove display it and B) show it's needed, entitles you to more compensation and just as importantly gives you a legit argument to ask for more, simply because you did more [than what is expected of you, which is written down already in the form of a job description].

Source: just a guy working to corporate game to the tune of 2 promotions in 16 months with another on the verge.  I am not doing my job better or more of it, I am taking on more, running with it for a few months, then asking for it to be part of my job/create a new position that reflects the *extra* work and efforts I am putting in that can be measured by those I am asking for more money from.

AnimalsBeingBros,fetbgm5,t1_fesqdp1,1579373627.0,"Odds are you are actually right.  Unless these robbers beat his body, his head/face is in pretty great condition for being incapacitated.  Not to mention if you do get knocked out, recalling yourself on the floor would be ridiculously blurry, nor would he know they charged robbers, he would have had a concussion.  Or he just got tired and laid on the floor, which doesn't exactly happen to the human body in such a circumstance sine our bodies are awesome and release hormones in a hurry.  

That's a rather concentrated bruise for getting your ass beat to incapacitated by two people, nor would a strike to the upper cheek do much of anything to someone having adrenaline dump.  Outside of breaking your orbital bone, it's one of the best places to take a strike to the head.

I think people who automatically buy into stories like this are utterly clueless at just how much it takes to knock someone to the ground where they can not get up.  More so when adrenaline pumping through you, you would have to be physically incapable of getting back to your feet, like unconscious, which in that case he would not know what the dogs did.

This story is possible, but it's extremely suspect.

EDIT:  The human body does not act like Hollywood depicts.  It can take a lot of damage before shutting down, and when it does shut down, like a KO, you end up missing about 15 minutes of life (not knowing what happened).
