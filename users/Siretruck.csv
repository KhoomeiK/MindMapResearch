teenagers,ff5g31d,t1_ff4v8h1,1579591328.0,"I get why you believe that but what I am saying is that the people who use the word and also oppose racism don't agree with that. They believe that it's about the intent of the person, rather than the specific words used. So for example, if they used the word to mean friend, or maybe as an expletive in a context that had nothing to do with race, they would believe that it wasn't racist because it doesn't fall under the dictionary definition of the word racism. They're not using it to express prejudice or even comment on race at all, so they believe it's not racist. Most would hopefully agree that there is a time and a place for any kind of words people are sensitive to, however. I think a similar thought process would be believing that jokes about cancer or other dark subjects can be funny and are not actually trying to hurt anyone's feelings or be serious, but that doesn't mean you should say them at a funeral for a cancer patient.

Again I don't expect you to agree, but that's their perspective on it and why they don't believe that using a word with non-racist intentions is racist. Their hearts are in the right place, whether they're right or not."
teenagers,ff4uvq0,t1_ff4u9vo,1579573007.0,"Well I'm not asking you to agree but see it from their perspective:

Lots of people strongly believe that using the n word is not inherently racist, and you may not agree with them, but they have their own reasons to believe that. So while you might not see eye to eye, they can still oppose racism and support that opposition in other people while doing something they believe is not racist."

teenagers,ff4s1rq,t1_ff4hwa5,1579571070.0,"He was an incredibly persuasive and well-spoken advocate for civil rights in America in the \~1960's, and an all-around hell of a guy. His most important message, in my opinion, was treating everyone -- including people who opposed him -- as equals and with the respect that every human deserves. This meant that his protests were nonviolent and dignified, even at personal cost (he was arrested and jailed for protesting numerous times, and eventually assassinated). He brought about more change for minorities in America than you could ever expect from one person, and it was because he had the self control to make his points known without letting emotion get the best of him. Basically King knew that screaming in your opponent's face would not change their mind, but demanding change through passive resistance and forgiveness would. It was a lesson that many other civil rights leaders, like Malcolm X and Nelson Mandela, took a long time to learn and once they did, they were able to change far more than when they were resorting to violence."

teenagers,fetgr8q,t1_fetfle5,1579375265.0,"Please don't say that. You can't look at someone's sex to determine how damaged they are by trauma. Just consider all of the men affected by sexual abuse and how marginalized they feel when people say things like that. And how could you even collect accurate statistics about that? One point of OP's post was that men are constantly pressured to keep their feelings to themselves. You simply can't get an accurate statistic on how people feel about something like that because it has to be reported voluntarily, and that automatically creates bias.

For the record, I've been sexually assaulted since taking that class and if I had heard her say that AFTER it happened to me instead of before, I honestly don't know if I would have freaked out on her or just cried. There's literally no point in comparing the issues. It's not fair to act like someone's problems are less important just because they do or don't fit into a certain category. All rape and sexual abuse is bad, no matter who the victim is. If you want to talk about women's issues, dope, but it's unproductive and hurtful to compare them to men's issues."

As far as what my prof said, she literally said that when a man is raped, it is less of a serious issue than when a woman is raped because ""women have less power in general"" and that it was thusly more mentally damaging for them. So no, I did not misinterpret her."

Also men's penises become erect against our own wills frequently. Thus random embarrassing boners in class. Penises can become erect even if the man is not aroused, and men (and women) can be aroused but still not want or consent to sex. If my dick is near a vagina, it's going to get hard whether I actually want sex or not.

I actually have a friend who was raped by his female friend. They were smoking weed together and she put some drug on the mouthpiece of the bong. He woke up inside of her, too delirious to do anything about it. The next day he thought he had cheated on his girlfriend, so he told her and they broke up, then his friend came clean and admitted to drugging him. This was definitely rape, even though he had an erection"

You can certainly be too drunk to give consent -- if you aren't aware of what's happening, etc -- but being under the influence does not inherently mean you can't consent. Drunk and high people have consensual sex all the time.

Edit: just to be clear, as I said, you certainly can be too drunk to give consent. But there is quite a bit of drunkenness between that and being sober. If someone has a drink or two, and is totally coherent and alert, they can absolutely consent to sex."
