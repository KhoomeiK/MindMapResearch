AskWomen,ff73wxa,t3_erxzcj,1579640618.0,I was very specific for a long time in finding a partner or whether it was just casual. Did they respect me/my opinions? Did they listen? What did they do in their free time? Did they keep their room/space/etc clean? What can i offer them? I thought just as much as what i needed as what they needed. I wasnt going to be comfortable settling down with someone if i felt like i wasnt good enough for them.

AskReddit,ff3wbb8,t3_erc1ft,1579550259.0,"Make sure nothing of what you say is a lie and accept that no matter what you say is going to hurt them. Start there, but also know that if they dont accept their situation then its beyond what you can help with. If they know its a problem then maybe keep guiding them to get counsil. As someone with a lot of problems, it took me a long time to see that this wasnt who i was and that it was something i could change without losing myself, and in fact it was by finding myself. A lot of times people would tell me about reality and i could wrap my mind around the truth. Now i know that when someone tells me something about me that seems like it shouldnt be that way, i evaluate myself to see if its true or not and see what i can gain from a conversation or hearing the harsh truth. however i also know i Can change because i have an open mind and accept that im not perfect. Some people cant."
