offmychest,fencu7w,t1_fencito,1579281954.0,YES - that's how I'm going to respond from now on when people bring them up to me
food,fen9e2s,t3_eq0lbt,1579279826.0,Why do people on reddit post pics of delicious food like this without a recipe? That should be a fucking crime
offmychest,fen9ab1,t1_fen904m,1579279762.0,"Are you from the UK? AM I from the UK? No, hence why I don't fucking care."
offmychest,fen993t,t1_fen8suh,1579279742.0,Great response - so true! Let's talk about the pedo & not what Meghan Markle is wearing. MAKE THIS SHIT STOP

cancer,fen70og,t3_eq25ey,1579278367.0,"You're a caring person coming from a place of empathy. Having cancer in the work place is scary, because people may end up losing their actual jobs. Don't hover, don't change how you talk to them, cancer patients don't want pity. The assurance that their job will NEVER be in jeopardy is the best gift you can give anyone going through this."
worldnews,fen6s5k,t3_epzvxo,1579278220.0,"Before we do any of this shit amazon, let's bring down the rent & COL in Seattle. I mean, COME ON ALREADY. Amazon is ruining peoples fucking lives. Who cares about India right now? Fix what's going on in this country first. You did this Amazon, you fucking fix it."

offmychest,fen5988,t3_eq0mo8,1579277261.0,"Yup - I am so tired of wasting my time making the effort of looking for a new job. You know what's really pathetic? Recruiters. They legit post jobs that don't exist. Guess what? These recruiters have contests within their offices & they don't care if you get a job, they just want to hit their numbers. So, if a recruiter contacts me I no longer respond because they have wasted enough of my time. Way to kill any hope I have left in finding a new job that is an improvement in my life. I have been working at the same company 12 year & I am fucking dead inside. Yet recruiters constantly smile like a ditz piece of shit. I'd smile too if my job was that dumb. Entry level my ass. #rantover"
