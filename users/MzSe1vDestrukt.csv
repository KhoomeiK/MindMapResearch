Methadone,fffl58t,t3_et976v,1579886323.0,"Hey me too! 
I have a gigantic mat in the back of my hair from so much depression sleep and just tying up my greasy hair instead of washing and brushing it. I initially had a mix of dreadlocks beneath my hair, and dreads are the last thing you should ever neglect. They like to grow into each other. I am not looking forward to trying to to salvage that. 
Sometimes I honestly don‚Äôt know if I smell because I haven‚Äôt showered in so long, or if it‚Äôs my clothes because I haven‚Äôt changed in so long üòπ"

Thetruthishere,ffb8a46,t3_esgbqm,1579754754.0,"I grew up in mound on Lake Minnetonka (three points Blvd) and had so many terrifying experiences in my childhood. It‚Äôs very interesting to me that you referenced the Mdewakanton tribe, as my son is a member. I‚Äôm going to ask is his father if has any insights on that. 
I have never seen anything similar to what you described though. My experiences all involved what I perceived to be a ghos in my house and recurring nightmares of black eyed bald men outside my windows coming inside and taking me. I had night terrors as a baby and evidently as young as two years old my grandmother had to not only cover the windows at night in my room, but also my mirrors that faced my Windows because I was so terrified. When I was older my neighbors told me lots of stories about UFO sightings over the lake. 
Anyway, if you ever want to talk about the subject PM me!"

He accused me of the same type of stuff, I was always having sex with someone out to get him in the hours I was asleep, or anytime I was in the bathroom because ‚Äúwhy else would I keep going in the bathroom? What‚Äôs hiding in there?‚Äù 
I was missing him recently, and this was enough to keep me from checking in."

Did they take a look at a tent city and think ‚Äúhere‚Äôs an idea for free advertising!‚Äù? Or do they already have these tents from some promotion and put them to good use?"

Methadone,fd6t8dg,t3_ejxpke,1578195418.0,"Babies.
Some people just let their babies crawl around on the floor which makes me cringe because it‚Äôs not uncommon to find needles or drugs. My mom is an LEDC at a different clinic and she found a big bag of meth. Her higher up tested it and then put it in a bag that ruins it (which kind of broke my moms heart as a former meth addict lol)"
