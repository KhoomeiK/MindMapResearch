It's a vicious circle that prevents people living off of public assistance from working and doing what they can, for themselves. 

A minimum wage hike raises standards across the board, essentially flooding the market. When something is in high demand it gains value, when there is a surplus it loses value. More money does not equate more value, it loses value just like anything else. What im suggesting in mandatory incone ratios in proportion to the size and value of the company. It would mean a mom and pop shop could legally pay a teenager $5/hour to help out after school, but McDonalds would be forced to pay more like $15/hour because they possess a bigger value.

Companies would have to be transparent about what they're worth, and by association what their labor force is really worth. Success for an entire corporation depends on its labor, but the laborer does not benefit from their hard work and sacrifice."

SandersForPresident,fdanqu2,t1_fdalgif,1578248125.0,"Not everyone NEEDS to make a livable wage. Think retirees, teenagers, stay at home moms, adults with disabilities etc. People who want to work, want to contribute and keep themselves busy while earning a little pocket money but don't necessarily need to make enough to live off of. Those are the people who USED to work small business jobs before they were bullied out by minimum wage.

The first time I heard about concept of wealth ratios I was in highschool, they used Ben and Jerry's ice cream as an example. That's how their company is structured (I believe it is a 10:1 ratio) and they've experienced tremendous success, employee satisfaction and employee retention. We touched on it a bit in my college political science/economy classes and a lot of companies are willingly adopting similar models but not enough to create real change. 

Corporate greed is like a disease, you have to treat the cause not the symptoms."
SandersForPresident,fdadtzt,t1_fdaao5h,1578244964.0,"That's why it's a complicated concept. We are so used to having that constant number that our time/work is worth, while completely ignoring the fact the the economy is a living breathing animal in constant fluctuation. The value of our money is constantly fluctuating, there for the value of our time is also fluctuating but we fool ourselved into thinking there's a magic number out there that will create financial stability; the minute we are content the super-rich will be plotting on how to take it away. 

The only real solution is public education and transparency. If one guy is working at Wal-Mart making $9/hour he's going to wonder why the guy at target is making $12 for the same job; if the only way that's possible is if target is the better, more successful and stable business, suddenly that Wal-Mart employee has a reason to find out why and figure out how they can get a job at target and improve their own financial growth, while target gains an advantage for being the better company. 

People have had the concept of self improvement beaten out of them by a broken system, designed to keep them down. ""Why bother being a good cashier? Im not getting paid more for doing a better job."" If that good cashier has the ability to go down the road and make more money, for posessing better skills, that's self propelled improvement, while the lazy shit-head employees are paid their worth as well. 

Its absolutely a messy concept, but the economy is already messy. Most people just don't realize it."
SandersForPresident,fda8hwh,t1_fda6vwl,1578242984.0,"In short bursts, yes. If you give low income families $1,000 that money goes directly back into local businesses and improves the economy but constantly funneling more and more only lowers it's overall value long term damaging both lower and middle class."
SandersForPresident,fda6evv,t1_fd9xmai,1578242276.0,"Handing out more money does not improve the economy, it reduces spending power and raises the cost of living. The real problem lies with wealth distribution ratios (how much the highest paid employee makes compared to the lowest paid employee) in relation to the size and value of the company. Don't be fooled by a measly $0.16 raise when your CEO makes 200+:1."
SandersForPresident,fda59jo,t1_fd9uq90,1578241852.0,"As someone who JUST broke through the 'minimum wage, living paycheck to paycheck' glass ceiling; I have to disagree with raising minimum wage as being a positive move. Yes- the number on your check is bigger but raising minimum wage reduces spending power, raises the cost of living and mainly effects the middle class who will not see a raise for several years, if ever. I think the solution is far more complicated; we need to work on policies the force fair wealth distribution based on the size of the company. For example; establishing acceptable earning ratios like, the highest paid employee can not make more that 20x what the lowest paid employee makes. This system will not only help small business's compete and succeed, but make the general public more aware of their own worth, and their companies worth which will raise economic awareness over all. Employees who feel they directly benefit from their companies success are proven to be happier, more productive, and loyal to their employer.

There will never be a quick fix to wealth inequality. Raising minimum wage by $0.50/hour per year is the wealthy's way of shutting up poor people ""You just got a raise, what are you complaining about?"" It's the economic equivalent of dropping table scraps to the dog so it stops whining."

I hate spending my entire weekends with 3 extra kids running around when I just want to spend time with my 1, but I worry about the kids safety if she leaves them with someone else.

The trick to dealing with temper tantrums is knowing your child's triggers and either avoiding them all together or taking the (sometimes excessive) time to help them understand. If your child wants to open groceries and eat in the store; walk them through the process of ""we pay for things before we open them"" show them how you scan your groceries, give the cashier money and put your groceries in the car before you are allowed to open them. If they want to walk, pick one easy store (like a dollar store) that they are allowed to walk and push the cart. Tell them the game plan: ""we are going to go to the bank, then walmart, then we will go to the dollar store and you can push the cart. That's 3 things we're going to do today"" remind them what the plan is and celebrate when you cross something off the list.

My son is really bright and has a lot of questions he can't quite express yet. His most recent melt down was over a claw machine at Wal-Mart. We were running in for 2 items so of course we were in a hurry and we went in a different entrance than usual and he spotted the big bright claw machines. Lightening struck when dad tried to pull him away without letting him check it out and ask questions.

Lately we have been counting quarters and putting them in the gumball machines when we leave the store, sometimes we don't have enough quarters and he's okay with that, we'll get a toy next time. Dad didn't know we have been checking out how machines work so he tried to brush it off and move on, i tried to correct the issue but it was too late, he was in meltdown mode. He kicked and screamed the entire way home until we got inside and i sat down with him and showed him claw machines on my phone, we watched videos on how they worked and he was a happy boy again. 

Unfortunately there is no magic trick to well behaved kids, but it's helpful to remember that everything they experience is a learning activity. Sometimes it just takes a lot of patience and creativity to get through the day."
Mom,fcr5mkg,t1_fcchefv,1577897127.0,"Sorry, I don't know how to format quotes but this person made a great point. 

As a parent myself (2 1/2 y/o boy with 1 on the way) we do build these little fantasy futures for our children full of love, happiness and success. Your mom probably IS morning the loss of the future she always wanted for you. 

The thing is, ALL parents have to go through this. Our children all grow, change, make their own choices and go down their own paths and I think it's pretty rare for a child to follow their parents vision to a T. Some people have a harder time letting go of their ""fantasies"" than others particularly if they have outdated, preconceived ideas (like, their child is gay so they'll never get grand children). My best friend is straight, but has made it clear she never wants to get married or have children and a big part of her super-Italian mother died inside at the thought of never being a grandma. 

It might take time but ultimately your mom wants you to be happy. Give her some time and make it okay to ask questions or express her feelings because, again, on some level she is mourning a loss while you're embracing who you are. 

You are both entitled to your feelings, but you love eachother and you'll find a comfortable balance."
Mom,fcr0fh0,t3_eif7f1,1577894938.0,"I had similar issues with my dad when my son was a newborn. My son was EXTREMELY attached, exclusively breast fed (he refused any type of bottle or artificial nipple) had to be held when he slept, screamed his face off any time i had to leave him (including taking a shower or going to the bathroom) and was just all around difficult. But my dad loved him to death and wanted to bond with him.

What I learned/ noticed over time was that even though my dad had 4 kids of his own, he never learned how to care for babies. My dad worked, my mom raised the kids. He never had the opportunity to bond with us as babies, we were just kind of THERE until we were old enough to do stuff with. I think this is really common with older men; they don't want to admit they don't know the first thing about babies. 

I know it's frustrating right now but don't give up on your dad as just being stubborn, he likely had no idea what he was getting into and was immediately overwhelmed with the situation. I would wait a few months and try again when the baby is a little more robust, and grandpa has had some time to adjust.
