TopSecretRecipes,fdw4it1,t1_fdu6mmz,1578754953.0,Thanks for the tip!
TopSecretRecipes,fdsfaaj,t1_fdsf2ct,1578701418.0,"Sweet! I hope you enjoy it. Let me know if it changes your mind on how you would try to recreate it. :)

Edit: @chelsea-vong: color me embarrassed. I just realized you weren't the original commentor with the recipe! Awkward...lol. Regardless, I hope you enjoyed the sauce! And if you do end up trying to make it, I definitely want to know all about it!"
TopSecretRecipes,fdseuho,t3_emw3xm,1578701103.0,Man!!! I loved this sauce too!!
TopSecretRecipes,fdsd8y8,t1_fdscm7u,1578699989.0,I'll keep my fingers crossed for you!
TopSecretRecipes,fdsd5kk,t1_fdscus0,1578699923.0,Sure thing! It might be slim pickings though. Lol
TopSecretRecipes,fdscupu,t1_fds8yga,1578699717.0,You're so awesome! I actually have everything on your list in my pantry except for the reaper sauce. I'm excited to try this out!!
TopSecretRecipes,fdscm7o,t1_fdrnmrn,1578699554.0,You have to go try it! It comes on their new like double tacos or something. But I got it on the side to put on my chalupa. Soooo good!
TopSecretRecipes,fdscima,t1_fds8fx1,1578699484.0,Awesome! I look forward to hearing back! Do you make their chipotle sauce at all?
TopSecretRecipes,fdscf1p,t1_fds7vxi,1578699416.0,Welp...there goes my paycheck.  My husband will want all of these. Lol.
TopSecretRecipes,fdscclm,t1_fdrnast,1578699368.0,"Yeah, that might work. Thank you for the suggestion!"
TopSecretRecipes,fdsc8ir,t1_fdsavyg,1578699290.0,"Really? Our reaper sauce is hot enough that it made my husband hiccup the first time he had it and he has a ridiculous tolerance for hot foods. I mean...he did ask for ""extra extra sauce"" so he probably got about 2 good tablespoons in one bite, but still."
food,fdqy75n,t1_fdq0hxo,1578676605.0,"Lol. Your comment made me think of this.

food,fdqxxtk,t1_fdpxh79,1578676447.0,I love this. Lol. I didn't even notice until I saw your comment.
food,fdqxvqr,t1_fdqtl6s,1578676411.0,"I don't know if I could eat this because I would probably be thinking of my Milyy and the guilt would kill me. Lol. However, I looked it up and it definitely sounds good."
food,fdqubrk,t1_fdq8v88,1578675018.0,Please let me know of you decide to make it! I'd love to know if my recipe worked out for you or not.
food,fdqsvsy,t1_fdqgc9h,1578674165.0,"I'm going to add this to the bottom of the recipe, but I wanted to say a few things after eating it. It was just like 2 in the morning when I posted this and I was too tired (and slightly inebriated) to follow up. But I wanted to reply directly to you just in case you decide to make this. 

-Don't skimp on salt. I probably could have used a little more, but at least it's easily added once it's on the plate. 
-If you're going to make this in a crust, make sure you increase the liquid in the filling. Pretty much all the liquid soaked into the pie crust and made the personal pies a bit dry. Honestly, it was way better without crust so I would skip it. 
-Consider adding some crushed tomatoes to bring a little acidity to the dish for some balance. It probably wouldn't take much, but I think it would have enhanced the flavor. I honestly probably could have even added some jalapeno ketchup (that's all I have in my house because I'm a weirdo) and I think even that would have brightened up the flavors a little bit while giving it a subtle punchiness. 
-I think I could have definitely added some more butter and cheese to the recipe overall. But then again, I'm a freak for cheese, so yeah. 
-Also, I have tiny trump hands (this is my curse, but as least I own it) so when it comes to the handfuls of veggies, use your best judgement. I kind of wish I had added more carrot, but the green beans seemed to be around the perfect amount. 
-You don't have to use green beans. Typically english peas are used, but I developed a hatred for them early on in life, probably because I had to eat the canned kind growing up. However, I think I would have tolerated some fresh peas in this. 
-I had some of this for breakfast, and it reheated well. I just added a smidge of butter and cheese before I reheated to give it a little more. 
-This probably goes without saying, but just make sure you season as you go to make sure you're getting the flavors you really want. 

Also, I'm just a home cook so all of my suggestions might be crap. Take them with a grain of salt. Lol."
food,fdq0x88,t1_fdpyi5g,1578649387.0,"These measurements are somewhat approximate.  I really took a shot in the dark when I made this, so a lot of this will be seasoned to taste. 

Mashed potatoes: 
-5 Yukon gold potatoes 
-20 oz Heavy Cream
-1/2 yellow onion
-1 Tablespoon Garlic
-2 bay leaves
-1 Rosemary sprig
-1 thyme sprig
-0.25 cup salted butter (I use kerrygold) this can be to taste. 
-2-3 tablespoons sour cream
-0.25-0.5 cups shredded cheese (I used a mix of kerrygold dubliner and old croc smoked cheddar)
-1 tablespoon dijon mustard
-1 egg yolk
-salt, pepper, and ground cayenne to taste

-Put cubed potatoes to a pot and then add cream. If the cream doesn't cover the potatoes, supplement with more cream, milk, or water. 
-Add onion, garlic, bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme. 
-Bring to a boil and cook until potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally. 
-Reserve around 1 cup of liquid and drain potatoes. 
-Remove onion, rosemary, bay leaves, and thyme. 
-Add reserved cream, cheese, sour cream, butter,  salt, pepper, cayenne, and mustard.
-Mash. 
-Add egg yolk and mix. Set aside. 

Pie filling:
-2-3 tablespoons avocado (or other neutral flavored) oil
-2 tablespoons butter
-1 lb ground lamb 
-1 lb 80/20 beef
-5-6 cremini mushrooms sliced 
-1 yellow onion chopped
-1 handful rainbow baby carrots, chopped
-2 handfuls fresh green beans, roughly chopped 
-1.5 cups corn (fresh or frozen)
-2 tablespoons chopped garlic
-0.25 Worcestershire sauce 
-1-2 tablespoons soy sauce
-0.5 cup all purpose flour
-2 tablespoons tomato paste
-0.5 cup beef stock
-0.75-1 cup Guinness 
-salt, pepper, and ground cayenne to taste
-0.25 cup cheese (same mix as mashed potatoes)
-chopped Italian parsley (garnish, to taste)

-Preheat oven to 400Â°F.
-Add oil and butter to a large pan, heat until shimmering. 
-Add lamb and beef, along with some of seasonings (salt, pepper, cayenne, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce) and brown. 
-Remove beef and drain around half to three quarters of the fat (make sure to leave some in the pan). 
-Add all vegetables to pan along with some seasonings and saute until soft. 
-Add meat to vegetables. 
-Add flour and stir. Cook 5 or so minutes until raw flour smell dissipates.  
-Add guiness, beef stock, tomato paste, and remaining seasonings. Mix well. Bring to boil before reducing to simmer.
-Simmer around 10-15 minutes until liquid has reduced and has a consistency similar to thick gravy. 

-Butter a large casserole dish. 
-Add meat and vegetable mixture. 
-Top with mashed potatoes.  
-Top with cheese (to taste). 
-Bake 20-25 minutes until cheese is melted and bubbly/mashed potatoes are golden. 
-Add chopped parsley. 
-Let sit for 10-15 minutes before serving. 

The seasonings for this recipe are estimates, but really just season to taste.



Edit: Also, sorry if the formatting is all wonky. I'm on mobile.



Edit 2: I just wanted to add some thoughts after eating it. Take them for what their worth and use your best judgement.  Also, if anyone actually made it this far, I'm impressed. Also sorry the recipe is so lengthy. But I digress.

Thank you again to anyone who took the time to read my post. If you make this, let me know how it turns out! I'd love to hear if/how you adjusted the recipe."
food,fdpyo96,t1_fdpyi5g,1578646259.0,I'm totally willing. I'll get it up here shortly. :)
socialanxiety,fdn7obp,t1_fdn1sry,1578579522.0,"Fair. Luckily in 18 years of doing it, I haven't run into a problem yet though! I'm sure it's only a matter of time. But at least I work from home now so I get to sneeze like a normal person more often. :)"
socialanxiety,fdlfwzt,t1_fdjxjd8,1578523159.0,"Yes! So much noise...just like a sneeze. That's my worst nightmare. I trained myself very early on to hold my breath when I had to sneeze so it would all be internal. It's not healthy, but it's way better than everyone looking at you when you sneeze."
maybemaybemaybe,fdkfqqg,t1_fdk84ve,1578502916.0,Probably fishing line. I think (I'm not 100% here) that this is Naude Dreyer (@namib_naude on instagram). He tries to save all these seals in Pelican Point in Namibia. He owns a kayak company there or something.
Dentistry,fdiqc92,t1_fdin4hq,1578448664.0,No thanks needed! I hope you get to feeling better!  :)
Dentistry,fdhuxcu,t3_elep4m,1578430590.0,I had similar pain and a new dentist checked my bite pattern and was able to shave down my crown and the pain went away after that. Sometimes a small adjustment is all it takes.
Dentistry,fdhtxgl,t1_fdhtjtf,1578430088.0,Well infections are pretty easy to treat at least. And I'm sorry you have to deal with it. My husband had bruxism pretty bad and it led to severe damage to all of his teeth and he had to get them all removed. Just take whatever preventative measure you can to try to save them. I hope you get to feeling better and that your appointment goes well and brings you some relief!
Dentistry,fdhtekz,t1_fdhszc7,1578429828.0,"Yeah. Im sorry you have to wait. Hang in there. If that bump is tender and painful, it might not hurt to put some canka on it. 

As for your teeth, definitely see what kind of options there are before a root canal. It may or may not be worth it just to find out, but if you can do something less invasive then do that. I have some really sensitive teeth because I brush too hard and caused my gums to recede. But the sensitivity toothpaste and fluoridated mouthwash has helped a good bit."
Dentistry,fdhswuf,t1_fdhst8b,1578429558.0,"Really? My canker sores don't tend to open up, which is why I suggested it. I'm sorry to hear about that though. Any chance you can just get the cavities filled?"
Dentistry,fdhsq0d,t3_elfhu3,1578429451.0,Is it possible that you have a canker sore? If you are under a lot of stress or eat/drink things that are highly acidic they tend to pop up.
Dentistry,fdhbxdg,t3_eleisu,1578419636.0,"I'm not a dentist, but my husband has had severe issues with his teeth. Leaving your tooth broken and untreated can lead to infection that can then spread to other teeth causing them to weaken and break. It can also cause the infection to spread throughout the body, impacting your cardiovascular health and if it is left long enough, it can turn into sepsis. That's kind of worst case from what I understand. But broken teeth can also contribute to bad breath that just won't go away until it's treated. 

I'm not sure if you have insurance, but definitely try to get in somewhere to have it checked to see if if it infected so you can at least get on some antibiotics if it is. Long term though, you should seriously consider having it extracted. It should be a fairly straightforward procedure that puts you out for a day or so. If you don't work weekends, it would be good to have it extracted on a Friday so you have the weekend to heal in the event you are still feeling shittu the day after."

Art,fdcrw4a,t3_ekh253,1578282552.0,This legitimately made me cry a little.
dogs,fbzueqr,t1_fbzejlw,1577262089.0,I appreciate you chiming in. I assume I would be better off buying raw food as opposed to trying to make my own?
dogs,fbzgctw,t1_fbzet2o,1577245775.0,"We have done all the regular checkups. I am very careful to keep our pups up to date. There have no issues, no parasites, or weird readings (as far as I know). Our older dog and middle dog suffer from anxiety and it manifests itself as obsessive licking. But they have never gone so far as to eat dirt. The third one has never had an anxiety or pica issue."
dogs,fbzc5oq,t1_fbzc31s,1577241815.0,Okay. Great. I appreciate the help. I'll do some research on serving sizes and see how we can work it all into the budget.
dogs,fbzbrrt,t1_fbzbnrp,1577241446.0,"Thanks for the advice. Do you need to provide any vitamin supplements or anything? And also, how did you figure out what their serving size should be?"
dogs,fbzblu4,t1_fbzbbwy,1577241290.0,"I actually tried the nutro at the suggestion of the vet and our groomer. But when I brought up the pica, our vet said it is likely behavioral (i.e., boredom or anxiety) and not due to the food. But they have been on it for about 4 months now and the pica is escalating. They seem to like the food, but I just don't want to pica to escalate from eating/licking hair, carpet, and dirt to eating rocks or something. 

I'll have to save some money to get them back to the vet...maybe she will take me more seriously. 

I appreciate the response, greatly."
