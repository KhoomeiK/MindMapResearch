AskReddit,ff6v0ln,t3_eruebg,1579635451.0,"Not a PI, but have a short story about one. I live at the end of a cul-de-sac. From the edge of the circle there is a spillway that lets water drain out to the main street, which runs perpendicular to my house. No one parks on the main street because it is walled off to enter the complex.

One day this dude pulls up in a black car, parks across the street from the spillway and just sits there. FOR ***HOURS***. Since this is *not* normal activity in the neighborhood everyone is *immediately* suspicious. He eventually leaves after doing nothing but sitting in his car all day so we all just forget about it until the next day he comes back and does the same damn thing. Someone finally called the cops and they came to suss out what he was up to. Turns out he was a PI casing someone in the complex. Cops told him to move it along he was making the residents nervous. Dude was not very good at his job since his arrival and subsequent non-activity only served to make him extremely conspicuous."
