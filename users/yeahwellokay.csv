Until suddenly it wasn't fun anymore. I drank more and more. Alienated my friends. Lost my friends. Spent the majority of my twenties drunk and alone and going nowhere. Eventually, switched from alcohol to pills. Took many years to finally get clean.

A year and a half of fun wasn't really worth the pain that followed. I still have a lot of health issues related to it all."
