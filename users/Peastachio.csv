dogs,fewvofe,t1_fepcxl1,1579420213.0,"Not OP, but there's a phenomenal day care I take my puppy to for classes. It's got the most thoughtful design and was clearly built with sound proofing and dogs in mind. A dog has to pass puppy class and advanced class before they can enter daycare, and it's a 5:1 dog:teacher ratio. They focus on training at this daycare. It's called Peace Love Dogs, and it's in Houston!"
Showerthoughts,fekyu94,t1_fekxrau,1579210441.0,"Nope. Originally, the Potters were going to use Sirius. Sirius thought he would be too obvious and that the information would be tortured out of him, so he came up with the idea to pretend he was the secret keeper and keep the spotlight away from the real secret keeper. The Potters then set Pettigrew as the secret keeper, who immediately told Voldemort where they lived."
Showerthoughts,fektwus,t1_feko990,1579207519.0,"Uh... the books mentions protective magic and anti-whatever wards all the time. The entire plot of the 3rd book revolves around revealing that the secret keeper for the Fidelis charm which hid the location of the Potters was Pettigrew.

~~The owls in the book were never able to find the exact location of a recipient~~, Hedwig was just an exceptionally smart and unique owl.

Edit: u/nevertakemeserious your reply doesn't show up for some reason, and so I can't reply. I haven't read the books in a long while, so I had to double check and it seems you're correct on one thing. It looks like it was established that owls can find magical signatures. That said, the existence of spells that can mask/hide/interfere being prominent parts of the plot the 3rd, 5th, and 7th installments of the series is a clear example of why owls weren't a good solution to finding people who didn't want to be found."
Showerthoughts,fektju9,t1_fekgf24,1579207305.0,"Seriously... the fact that there are protection spells and wards plays a key role in the plot  and ""twist""of the third movie."
Showerthoughts,feksy48,t1_fekmclw,1579206950.0,"~~Owls don't know your exact location~~, and there are protection spells and wards that can hide your location. There are several examples in the movies alone, and more in the books.

The entire point of the 3rd movie is that Peter Pettigrew was the secret keeper for the Fidelius charm that was hiding Harry's parents, and he betrayed the location to Voldemort. This same charm is what hides the headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix in the 5th, 6th, and 7th (8th?) movies.

Edit: Owls can find you by magic signature, but magic that interferes with that also clearly exists."
Showerthoughts,fekslsw,t3_epj9bc,1579206745.0,"Pretty sure the books and the movies explain that there are protection wards and spells which hide your location. The biggest example is that Harry's own parents hide from Voldemort with the Fidelis charm, which required a secret keeper (Pettigrew, who betrayed their location to Voldemort). Owls also don't know the exact location of the recipient..."

I found some products I don't seem to be as sensitive to, so I'm happy about that - everything has fragrances that set off my skin. When my skin is clear, I'm gonna LEARN HOW TO DO SOME MAKEUP. #BEAUTIFULFACE2020. Washing my face morning & night, wear sunscreen on my face, essence (coming soontm, mid 2020). I CAN DO IT.

I'll tackle exercising, flossing, and getting a butt in 2050."

dogs,fcvnxh3,t1_fcvn4tb,1578006181.0,"What a big chewer! This makes me grateful my dog hasn't learned to bite hard. I still think it's one of the best deals you can get for bully sticks, though I also probably won't be purchasing it again."
dogs,fcvi33x,t1_fcv7lo0,1578002548.0,"What brand do you use? It's going to be ages until I have to replace mine, but I'm open to looking at other options."
dogs,fcvarvo,t1_fcv8u46,1577998199.0,"Thanks for such a thorough comment! I share your opinion that there is no perfectly safe chew, and I love that you made sure to note that many options are controversial. 

Some chews I've tried and my results:

* Nylabones: she would chew off bits of plastic in the only one she was interested in, and ignored the others. I've heard these can also splinter, damage teeth, and obstruct.
* Carrots: she likes them, but makes a giant mess and they don't digest very well. I still give them occasionally, but there's always pieces in her poop afterwards, which makes me think most things will pass alright through her system even if not digested
* Celery: she loves this, and it takes her 10 minutes to finish a little 4 inch section. It makes her pee more, though. Also pretty messy. Her poop was a little soft after this, but I think I gave her too much in one sitting.
* Trachea: she loved it, but the smell was absolutely horrific. I threw it out, because I just could not bear it and the stench that stayed on her breath the whole day after only a few minutes of chewing. It's also kind of sticky in a very unpleasant way.
* Bully sticks: chronic soft poop and vomiting white spittle. May have been a storage issue on my part.
* Virbac chews: these are treats and not chews, in my opinion. I give her one a day after brushing her teeth, and she takes about 10 minutes to finish a strip. 

No interest in trying chews:

* bones
* antlers
* hoofs

Not sure if I'll try any other chews. For now, rawhide seems to be doing well for us."
dogs,fcv35iu,t1_fcuz09o,1577993679.0,"Try the sticks from Costco! They're super long and thick, and very efficient for your wallet as you get 12 sticks per package.

While I had issues with them, I think it came from improper storage on my part."
dogs,fcv233e,t1_fcv1m6u,1577993041.0,"I didn't mean to make this a raw hide discussion post, I just wanted to provide context to how I learned some of the cons of bully sticks. :/ 

Do you find that it's easier or harder for your dog to go through braided sticks vs the traditional straight bully stick? My puppy does like things like bully sticks, but I've found anything outside of a straight roll/stick is just disappears in a few minutes."
dogs,fcv0qmi,t1_fcv0e6l,1577992287.0,"I didn't mean for this post to be about promoting rawhide, I just wanted to start a discussion about the unmentioned cons of bully sticks. 

That said, anecdotes aren't science, so I try my best not to use them as a basis over what vets and research suggest to me. My own dog had issues with bully sticks, but my anecdote doesn't mean that bully sticks are bad. In the future if I buy a bully stick, I will be sticking it in the freezer, I think."
dogs,fcv07y2,t1_fcuz9jl,1577991999.0,"My understanding is that raw hide is digestible, but not as much as other products. It only digests \~3% on in the stomach (don't have a source for that), but once it's in the intestines it apparently will be much more digestible. He went on to tell me that most of the time anything not digested passes through the system before they even have time to operate, and that the only time he ever had an issue was when a dog got half of one stuck in its throat.

I was a little surprised, too, as he's the second vet to suggest raw hides over other chews to me. My current vet suggested only using rolls manufactured in the US and Canada and avoiding anything cheap or manufactured in China, which was very hard as so few are manufactured in North America for some reason. Most seem to be made in Brazil or Mexico. 

I guess it's about sourcing the rawhide appropriately and matching the chewing type of your dog. I make sure to stick with rolls, as I've read that other shapes are more likely to chip and that knots may slip off the bone shaped ones. My dog also doesn't bite; she chews until she gets a very tiny piece you can barely pick up, so I'm not worried about her swallowing anything big enough to cause issues. She regularly eats a baby carrot as a treat and funnily enough, I see orange pieces in her poop all the time, so I'm not too worried about the much smaller raw hide pieces not being digested."
dogs,fcuz70a,t1_fcuywnx,1577991439.0,That's a good idea! I wonder how much of my dog's little issues came from me not realizing I was handling raw meet and not storing it properly. I'll probably fiddle around with bully sticks as chews and storing them properly in a few months. My biggest issue with that is the Costco sticks are way too thick and long for me to cut and store in my freezer.
dogs,fbmudv2,t1_fbjzoa3,1576988987.0,"Why would you do that? That would be kind of shitty to do. 

Most shelters are legally required to take in all strays, and then they also get hundreds of surrenders every month. How are they supposed to take care of that many animals? They're begging people to adopt on their social media daily, posting each dog that's on the list to be euthanized up to the last hour before they're put to sleep, and constantly reaching out to local rescues to pick up new intakes of their specialized breed. They're shipping dogs up north as fast as they can, but it costs money. Even with all that effort, they still have to euthanize daily. It's not their fault. It's the people who refuse to be responsible with their pets, the back yard breeders, and the lack of funding.

No kill shelters have the luxury of being able to deny entry. They'll hold the same 20 dogs that have severe issues that prevent their adoption for years and years, and force the dirty work on public shelters. Meanwhile a regular shelter may have twice that surrendered in just a few days, and less funding to work with."
