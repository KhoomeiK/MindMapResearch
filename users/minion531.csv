changemyview,ffas9ob,t3_esbw24,1579743305.0,"I guess it all depends on what you want to believe. I believe Bernie Sanders, an Independent, invaded the Democratic Party to split it and ensure Trumps win. I think Jill Stein entered the race for the same reason. Not that either of them could win, but they could siphon off enough votes, i.e. ""Bernie or Bust"", to ensure a Republican win.

I think he is once again doing the same. As soon as Trump won, Bernie was no longer a Democrat. He was suddenly an Independent again. But he can't make any money running as an independent, so he has to once again run as an Democrat. And once again, he can't win, but he will siphon off enough voters to make Trump win again. He has long ties to Russia and he used speeches stolen by the Russian FSB, to damage Clinton in the primaries.

So I see Clinton as someone ""calling bullshit"" and I'm right with her."

changemyview,ff4ivik,t3_erfdcf,1579564679.0,"Transwoman here. I'm not going to tell you what is right or wrong, just how it appears to me. It's starts with a question. Why is it a concern of the government or anyone else, what gender anyone is? Gender is not required to pay taxes or be a good citizen. Our driver's license is supposed to be to prove we passed a driving test. Why does it have our age, gender, SS#, address? How did it become ID? How did the government get the right to identify us as a condition of driving? And why do they need our gender?

This simple answer is, they don't. It's an intrusion to identify and separate us by categories they choose. So right off the bat we have this problem of people wanting to label everything. And it's mostly for religious reasons. To see who is worthy of government services and who isn't. I consider all of this, a separate problem from the issue of gender identity.

The other thing is, there are a lot of people that don't believe that people have a ""sense"" of the gender they are. They believe that gender is just a function of what gender one appears to be. They believe if they woke up in the body of the opposite sex, they would suddenly just feel like that gender. So for people who don't believe there is a sense of gender, it makes sense to them to just stop identifying as the gender they are. They see gender as a 100% construction of society. Forcing them into roles they don't want. It can't be a coincidence that I've never met a ""non-binary"" person that didn't have a female body. It also seems like 99.99999999% of ""genderqueer"" people have a male body. These people do not feel compelled to live in the gender role society would like them to.

So, how do I interpret all of this? Gender and our roles in society is a hugely complicated thing. I can't expect people to respect what I feel about who I am, if I do not do the same. So if a person says they don't want to be pigeon holed into a gender role that is not who they are? Why would I care? It's really no one's business. It doesn't affect me in any way. So why not just support those people too? If a person tells me they are ""non-binary"", I can change my pronouns to make them feel accepted. That's why we use any pronouns or titles or even names. We don't call people the wrong pronouns or gender just to make them uncomfortable. So calling anyone other than what they preferred to be called is rude and not conducive with good civic conduct. 

In the end, anyone should be able to present anyone they want. It's really no one's business. We need to all learn to accept everyone as they really are, not how we would like them to be."

First of all, it's a lot worse than they are saying because of having to make conservative estimates because of climate change deniars. All this nonsense about working toward carbon neutral by 2050? No, we don't need to cut down on CO2 and other greenhouse gases. We need to stop tomorrow. And even then, it's going to be hundreds of years before the earth returns to normal, if ever. It may already be too late to stop it. What's more likely is that we will have 7-8 degrees F increase in temperatures by 2100. On this path, humans will be reduced in population by a high percentage. The chances that the world will actually do anything about it, is very slim. Large portions of the world still depend on coal and not only are they not cutting down, they're increasing them all the time. Places like India and China and even Germany are approving new coal mines. So right now the world is going the opposite direction. And even the Paris Agreement, which is completely inadequate by a large margin, is not being met. Not even close. And to get anything done in the US, you need 60 votes in the Senate, because the Republicans are climate change deniers as a matter of policy. So while any Democratic president can take certain Executive actions, it's a drop in the ocean compared to what needs to be done.

Unless the Democrats win the House, and a large majority in the Senate, His agenda has no chance as it would require 60 or 67 votes in the Senate. Just like Obama, the Republicans will filobuster everything and nothing will pass. So it's all just wishful thinking. I wish it weren't so, because my Candidate has made a lot of similar promises. There is no question we need a progressive candidate. The time is now. I've been voting for moderates for years because I didn't believe a progressive could win. Now I believe a moderate can't win.

So after you work on a relative or friends house or apartment, you own anything that can go wrong with anything.

1. Ask if they would like a bid or if they want you to work by the hour.

2. Give them a price they will for sure reject.
