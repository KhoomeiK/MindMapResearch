FinancialCareers,ff24cj5,t1_ff12mpz,1579493457.0,"Never thought I’d say this but yeah.  Late 20s on a good track but wow it took me too long to realize what everyone had been trying to explain to me for years.  If you’re happy by all means rip it  but if you’re not the money will mot make you happy. Let me repeat if you think you’re different and somehow everyone who has told you this is out of their mind please listen, it will not make you happy.  I have mentors at the top, in the middle, and beside me and restlessant is giving it to you straight when he says it’s a sacrifice."
EverythingScience,fdue8t6,t3_emyo8b,1578731777.0,Man it’d be cool to do something so significant at such a young age
sales,fdue0nc,t3_en2a0b,1578731677.0,If you don’t mind saying what type of car/dealership are you selling? Target market and demographic will play a role in the best way to get where you want.
Posture,fduavap,t3_ebirdy,1578730577.0,"It feels weird but resist the urge to hunch forward closer to the screen. Maintain a disciplined posture and try to keep aligned. Don’t move your body to keep your eyes level move your eyes to keep your body level if that makes sense. You’ll zone out and realize you’ve drifted toward the phone after a while, that’s alright just reset and realign.  Wish I could tell you an easier way but I haven’t found one, it’s a struggle. 

Edited to say when standing I just keep it in one hand about shoulder height and try to mostly look down with my eyes rather than crane my neck over. If sitting I’ll do the same if sitting back or rest elbows on knees while trying to keep my torso long and chin tucked. To be honest it looks a little weird being this rigid sometimes so I mostly focus on this at home."
FinancialCareers,fdu3fmk,t3_en2sxl,1578726837.0,"I work on the retail sales side of things. Be happy to give you some insight into different companies and roles. Shoot me a dm.  Spoiler though, nw mutual is brutal."
AskMen,fdu0bl4,t1_fdtykeh,1578725241.0,You ever seen that bond movie where he’s sitting in a chair with a hollow middle and the guy is swinging that rope and hitting him from underneath
Stoicism,fdtnj85,t3_emvdm7,1578719346.0,Doing the hard thing leads to satisfaction in hitting goals which makes you happy where doing what makes you immediately happy does just that at the expense of having not done the thing that will provide the long term satisfaction. At least this has been my experience.  Going heavier on the former and sprinkling in the latter is ideal imo.
sales,fd5y2pd,t3_ek35jg,1578182948.0,"I think the immediate value proposition is attractive but agree that your pitch is too cryptic and sounds scammy. I would be more explaining who you are, who your clients (similar to them) are, and how you add value to your clients. Simple, effective, and if it garners interest you’ll hear from them. Similar concept but much less sketchy sounding. Keep grinding.

Edit: not sure your industry but obviously don’t name your clients lol be broad e.g. “I work with small businesses looking to improve their online presence” or some shit"
Cartalk,fc6u6un,t1_fc6sulu,1577489599.0,Nice
getdisciplined,fc6r9z5,t3_eggtwi,1577487465.0,You answered your own question.  Success compounds success. Great things happen when you have momentum and move confidently throughout life. Keep it up
sales,fc2177o,t1_fc213px,1577336414.0,Second thought in my in my industry (finance) people have well established client relationships and often do leverage that into higher payouts and take them to different firms.
sales,fc213px,t3_efqyeh,1577336313.0,"Assuming the workforce is an efficient marketplace they’d take everyone just below them in production who sticks around and keep charging, probably paying a lower payout on sales.  Essentially, I’ve thought the same thing and come to the conclusion there’s plenty of hungry talented people behind me. I kindof look at it like big sports stars, there’s a threshold (though it’s very high) where any team will essentially tell Lebron to walk and they’ll better allocate their capital to benefit the overall org.  Sure, his loss will hurt. But the money allocated elsewhere toward other players etc will overall make them more successful."
AskReddit,fc1yhfb,t1_fc1ye9l,1577333697.0,It was the white clear kind
AskReddit,fc1y67r,t1_fc1bzj0,1577333398.0,Thank you I’ve now pissed myself
getdisciplined,fc1x95a,t1_fc194go,1577332538.0,"Good advice and important to acknowledge the efforts toward that goal will feel worthless when you’re depressed, but they absolutely are not.  Congrats on your masters!"
CFB,fc1x2zj,t1_fc1i4xb,1577332385.0,This might be a joke but if found undoubtedly guilty I would support this
getdisciplined,fc1ffnb,t1_fc18nv7,1577317158.0,"Maybe this isn’t the case for you, but when I was in my worst part of depression I realized that I had convinced myself I didn’t care about things, but actually did. It was a coping mechanism against what I thought was inevitable failure. For example I’d convinced myself I didn’t care about a relationship because I felt unworthy of one or like I wasn’t worthy of the girl I wanted, when I started to realize it actually was obtainable I started trying more and, shocker, realized it was my own mindset holding me back more than anything else. I’ve since had much more dating a relationship success since breaking through that wall. Not to say I’m limitless now, but it made a massive difference.  Same thing career wise. Again, just my experience.  I would echo what others have said and really dig deep to try to understand the root of this all, which may take time."
