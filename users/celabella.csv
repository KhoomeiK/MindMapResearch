stickshift,fd7ke2r,t3_ek19i1,1578205863.0,"So when I was learning stick a few years ago, I only had my (at the time) boyfriend's car to practice on. He showed me to engine brake, which I think is the technical term for the downshifting you described. He said it's the safer option because you are always in gear and can easily accelerate if you need to perform quick, evasive maneuvers in case of an emergency. He was a mechanic and has been driving stick for 15 years so I trust his information.

Fast forward to present day. I purchase my first MT and my WRX is now the daily driver. When I went on a test drive, my sales guy noticed me engine braking and suggested I avoid that because it will damage my engine over time. (We had built good rapport and I explained I haven't driven stick in years and was very novice/beginner level.) That's when he showed me this method of  switching to neutral and cruising, then shifting into gear when I'm ready to accelerate again. 

I reached out to the mechanic ex (still talk occasionally) and I asked him about this in more depth. Basically, he said it comes down to preference but he taught me that way for a reason (safety) but the neutral way is fine too.  The biggest thing is knowing what gear you need to be in when you have to shift into gear again and so long as you are rev matching properly before downshifting, then it's perfectly fine for the car. He did mention cruising could potentially help save gas over downshifting. 

I'm only 500 miles into my first manual trans and with all that said and done, I find myself cruising in neutral more than downshifting, but I'm also avoiding downshifting at this time so I don't accidentally go over the 3500-4000 rpm range suggested during the first 1000 miles of break in. I'm guessing once I am 1k+ I will probably downshift more due to preference of being in gear.

If anything I said is wrong, someone please correct me! My WRX's clutch appreciates your input :)  also, sorry for the super lengthy response!"

Since it's all paid for, I want to take advantage of them including the front windshield too.
