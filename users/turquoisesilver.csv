HPHogwartsMystery,fdsey6l,t1_fds7zld,1578701176.0,Holiday is the English version of Vacation but we don't tend to refer to Christmas as a holiday as much as Americans. When I was at school we would say .'Christmas break' or 'break up for Christmas' . 'When I am work I just say 'I am off for Christmas' (because sadly time off for Christmas is not always a given).

HPHogwartsMystery,fdri6z0,t3_emtlny,1578684868.0,"I noticed this early on and then forgot about it when they started sounding more like alien than Americans with phrases like 'keeping talking' with a weird creepy smile.

I think a recent example of Americanised language though is the overuse of the words 'the holidays' to refer to Christmas. Brits usually say 'Christmas' even to people who don't really celebrate it or,  very rarely, we'll say 'this festive season' if we really think someone's going to get funny about it.

Also, I always felt it was weird that Ben said he preferred 'Chips' over 'Steak and Kidney Pie'. Steak and Kidney Pie is a whole meal, 'Chips'? Why not say 'Fish and Chips' or atleast 'anything with chips'."
depression,fdqfjpu,t3_emmjtp,1578665382.0,"Genuinely sorry to hear this. My sister has Aspergers and struggles. The thing is I don't think she realises how much people like her but I guess regardless she  sometimes accidentally ends up offending people. She goes to like an Autistic social group and she gained one close friend there. She also uses writing a lot to help her with all sorts of things because despite struggling with social skills she's great at writing out her feelings. She even wrote a presentation for her work colleagues to help them understand her condition from her perspective.  I would  look into what resources you have at your disposal such as local autism groups and also in yourself, your skills.

But you know, I always say I'm no expert. Do what helps you feel better. I don't have Autism but I also haven't had a friend since I was a teenager so in the mean time I'm trying to do things that keep my life varied and do things that 'pamper' myself so when I meet my friend I have a lot of great experiences to share.

Don't take it as a reflection on you. Trying to be ' nice, kind, considerate, and respectful'  is great. Definitely reminds me of my sister. She's learnt some rules of being polite better than me. 

Hope one of these comments helps you. We're all rooting for you."
HPHogwartsMystery,fdq3ksr,t3_emoh9x,1578653175.0,"I'm just sick of the timed events and the people that say they are easy to complete.

I don't want to put timers on my phone or to spend money to complete them. App games are supposed to pass the boring times in your life e.g when you are on the train home. They are not supposed to monopolise your day. It seems to me that people are ~~rushing~~  paying their way through the story  so the designers feel they have to do these timed events to slow people down. I really don't know whether I want to do this latest Quidditch one. I've enjoyed Quidditch as a non-timed sidequest but I'm so drained from the last timed quest, especially when getting 2/3 of the way through has no impact and  if the event  comes back again you have to start right from the beginning.

I can't even remember where I'm up to with the main story and whether me and Merula are currently getting on.

I've still thankfully avoided giving these people my money and avoided getting too invested in the majority of these side quests."

harrypotter,fdd9yz7,t3_ekfawk,1578301791.0,"I wasn't bothered about Draco's redemption arc. What bothers me is that EVERYONE in Slytherin sides with him, and yes everyone also leaves with him in the battle of Hogwarts. You telling me that in a house full of ambition and cunning no one ever puts Draco in his place? Noone ever says 'I'm sick of this guy being smug guy on top of the tree, I'm going to overthrow him'?

Crab and Goyle irritate me more than Draco. It's given us the reputation that Slytherin is where you put the dumb followers."

depression,fd99nwz,t3_ejztdk,1578230399.0,"This reminds me of when a colleague came to see my team at work and told us she didn't know whether to tell her work experience student that he smells as he has mental health issues. She said he had depression and she didn't want to upset him. I piped up 'he's probably struggling with self care because of his depression'. I hoped by saying this she would understand and say to him in an understanding way that she was concerned that he wasn't taking care of himself, that she cared. Instead she said he's never going to get a job interview if he smells like that  but I don't want to hurt his feelings and make him suicidal, I'll ask his teacher to tell him. This was in a non-clinical area of a hospital that constantly runs mental health campaigns.

Another time we received coffee vouchers at this same hospital from a mental health charity to encourage taking staff out for a drink to better understand bottled up feelings. Several people requested we use them for our own promotion instead. It's fair to say I'm cynical about mental health campaigns. Changing public perceptions on mental health takes more than a poster. The only mental health campaign I have ever liked is  Zero Suicide Alliance's campaign for staff to train themselves on the signs someone is contemplating suicide. I'm not *endorsing the training they provide*, I'm just saying that the concept of providing training videos on how to help someone who is potentially suicidal open up, is a better idea than a poster."
depression,fcye8kw,t3_ejeyfi,1578078795.0,"I've found  over the years that a fair few people have told me they *had* mental health issues or they know someone with them so 'they understand' but the vast majority of the time they don't. A lot of the people I meet have either put their mental health issues well behind them or their understanding of their friends depression is clearly limited.

I do believe them I just don't think they grasp that you can't presume a lot when it comes to mental health, you need to actually **listen**. For instance I had a boss that said his daughter was depressed because she was overwhelmed with exams so when I told him I was depressed he gave me less work to do. I know that's something some people would be jealous of but I just got bored and it left me alone with my miserable thoughts and it didn't help me. At our next evaluation he said 'I don't know why you're still coming in looking miserable, I gave you less work to do!'

I do believe that his daughter was depressed I just don't think he understood that the things that helped her may not help me."

depression,fcuqccr,t3_ej0nga,1577986364.0,"Well under the mod guidance I'm going to talk about what family have done that helps **me** but I by no means have one size fix all solutions as I'm still struggling with my depression.

I think being a listening ear is helpful, spending time with me not getting frustrated when I don't follow advice. Sometimes I'll say very little but it will represent a lot of pent up feeling so listening out for anything that indicates feelings is important. My issue with family is I can sometimes feel they are too solution orientated and sometimes I just need to feel that my feelings are being heard. Constantly letting me know that taking care of myself is more important than idiots at work this year helped a lot, their offers to help by taking me out helping with cooking and other self care kind of helped because those are aspects of self care I've struggled with and I think need to work on self care before I can do much else. It's still a struggle though"
depression,fcunilj,t3_ej0085,1577984777.0,"I think you know because lazy people are pretty happy with the way things are, they're relaxed and happy they can get away with doing less. I'm going to take a guess that you beat yourself up that you're not more proactive. I'm saying this because I've been there, I've wondered if I'm lazy too but I go through all the classic mental thoughts of a depressed person with a lot of actions that may appear 'lazy'. I also know how I used to act on  a lazy day compared to now. Like I used to not starve myself to the degree I do now just because I can't motivate myself to get up and make lunch but everyone shows depression in  slightly different ways, it's all about your mental health, how you feel."
buffy,fculp1c,t3_eh7wyg,1577983734.0,"I think Giles actions made sense. Giles has never had much of a life outside of training Buffy so it makes sense that he still sees himself as the man that knows better teaching the young girl.Not to an extreme level he does let her take the lead on some things and at times he just wants to step away and leave her to it so he can resist the urge to step in.

In the case of his decision on Spike, I don't think Giles ever fully got over how following Buffy's trust in Angel as a young girl got his girlfriend killed. He would never openly acknowledge it, even to himself but I think that's why Giles didn't trust Spike even with a soul, he saw him as another Angel mistake.

Also Giles has gone over Buffy's head and manipulated her before this. He wasn't happy about her plan with Dawn in s5 and he decided to kill Ben against her wishes. There was that time with the watcher's council.. Actually I think Giles thinks he has better judgement than a lot of the scoobies. I do like Giles but I just think that's his flaw. I think he's kinda stuck in his ways.

So TLDR I get why he did what he did but yes it's irritating."
buffy,fcuj11e,t3_eiyaeg,1577982107.0,Most of the time I want to say 'why can't you do that yourself' or 'how is your lack of organisation my fault? get it together!'. Some people seem to think everyone in employment is paid to be their mother.

HPHogwartsMystery,fcuhkel,t1_fcu1muc,1577981127.0,"Well yes some of them are just a kind roasting but what I'm saying is the whole interaction is just odd  for me in how robotic it is. For me, if I really think about it, I mix teasing with compliments so the person knows I'm not using what I'm just having fun and there's nothing behind it and it's a shame the interactions aren't more flexible. If I was just trying to win the game then yes I would just keep going with the kind roasting none stop, but there are some options to say some nice things in this game and somehow when you click them you lose friendship points.

Also don't know what you mean by ' saying nice things' would scare him. That boy clearly needs a confidence boost from a friend."
buffy,fctzj1w,t3_eigv7y,1577967142.0,There are so many episodes of Buffy that could just be a movie. I'm convinced that 'the quiet place' is close to what the 'Hush' movie would be.

depression,fctyg6r,t3_eir5wa,1577965777.0,"Glad you posted this because I struggle to explain this to people. People seem to get the concept of staying in bed all day because your're  not well and/or standard insomnia. People don't seem to get that I stay up late dreading going to bed because I know what I'll wake up to.That's the way my depression impacts on sleep. For me it's been hard because every day I go to a workplace that bullies me and when I go home I'm too drained to do something to take my mind of it. I just stay up trying to pretend I don't have to go back. I'm struggling to sleep before I even get in bed.

It's just been a cycle and now it's become such a habit, that I stay up late and then I am forced to wake up early for work, that I'm struggling to have reasonable hours of sleep even on a better more relaxed/happy day. I can neither sleep in or go to bed early. I'm 'burning the candle at both ends'. Glad I'm not the only one. Thank you for sharing."
HPHogwartsMystery,fctx4lx,t1_fctjkvv,1577963994.0,"Yeah when I first played I thought the goal of Gobstones was to make different types of friendships based on your interactions, I didn't get that there is a 'right' answer. I picked all the nice reassuring options only subtlety teasing from time to time. I thought it would impact on what kind of friendship we had that say if I pick a lot of knowledge one's they'll maybe respect me, if I pick a lot of empathy they'll open up to me etc. Then I find out that 90% of the time I have to be nasty and that somehow makes me friends?! What kind of life lesson is that? 

Don't get me started on how disjointed the meal with a friend interactions are. Someone will say something like 'I'm not sure about this?' and my character will say 'keep talking you'll feel better' who says that? It's like someone's run the conversation has been run through Google translate a few times."

depression,fcsfp2i,t3_eiknf9,1577915859.0,"2019 was a pretty crap year but I like that we're on a new one. I've been using the Christmas holidays to SLOWLY apply for jobs and I'm hoping by the time everyone gets back from the Christmas holidays in the new year, I'll get a response from a better job. I've only managed to motivate myself to fully apply for two jobs so far but I'm really hoping it'll help me feel better and has some lasting impact.

New years Eve is always the part that's hard for me though. Every year It makes me reflect on all my disappointment and that all the Christmas cheer has just died as soon as Christmas is over. For some reason though the morning of New Years day I tend to feel slightly better.

Hope you don't think I'm doing negating people feelings on this. I do get it. Every time someone evaluates my depression and says 'you haven't had suicidal plans recently' like that's all that matters, it bugs me. It's like I've had a dark cloud hanging over me every single day of 2019! Tackling THAT is more important to me than concentrating on keeping me alive  for a whole year. Hope that at-least one of us get a better year this year."

I really liked Skye, I saw a lot of Slytherin qualities in her but a real Slytherin would only spread rumours when it is the best solution to protect themselves.
