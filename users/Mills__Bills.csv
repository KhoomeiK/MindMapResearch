The collar I bought was 300$. And so you know, I did not hire a professional trainer, as I am one, silly boy! :D the collar isn’t needed anymore, really. You really should do research before going ahead of yourself and assuming the worse. It’s like complaining about using a clicker. A vibration isn’t going to bother a dog, their mothers using bite the shut out of them if they do something wrong. Know that you have this information, you won’t have to waste my time again.

I got her and she was 100% untrained. After training her without the collar, after months we got the vibrator. It’s a tool, it doesn’t hurt her at all."
instant_regret,ff11j7s,t1_feznd0f,1579474340.0,"Sure, but I wouldn’t say “friendlier”. Like I said, I don’t shock her, it’s just a small vibration that I use. It’s Basically equivalent to the water collar"
instant_regret,ff114ya,t1_fezngk6,1579474216.0,"It doesn’t scare my dog though. Like I said, it is just a small vibration.  I always tell her “no” before using the remote. If she continues, I’ll use it and she’ll listen.

It’s not really the feeling that makes her stop, but it’s how she was trained. The feeling let’s her know she needs to stop, just like saying “no” does to dogs. Understand?"
instant_regret,fezijz4,t1_fezgeef,1579457722.0,"No. This person was on a very high-level on the shock collar to actually hurt him. If you know how to use the shock collar right, that it’s not in anyway torture. Our use a shock collar for my dog but we don’t even use the shock option, we use the vibration option. It just tells them to stop what they’re doing, using an unpleasant feeling.
Using a shock collar on any other level above 80 on a big dog would be considered animal abuse because that hurts. It should just be a small feeling that they feel, no pain"
instant_regret,fezi4jt,t1_fezaw6v,1579457615.0,"I use the same shock collar for my dog.
It’s not “torture” if you use it right. Always be bellow level 10 or even 5. They don’t need to get hurt to understand, they need a “unpleasant” feeling to understand and tell them “I am not suppose to do that”.

I don’t even use the shock option, I use the vibration option. Just a little tingle on her neck let’s her know “No”. Make sure u never show them ur the one controlling the collar though, cus it’s mainly teaching them that Mother Nature says no.

Furries often end up liking furry porn but not just furry porn -

Most (70-80 percent?) of furries don’t wear fur suits and just like the creatures they create -

Straight up mursuiters are rare, but not here because people find the worst of the worst -"
Cringetopia,fe0sawh,t1_fe0s8dj,1578818092.0,You can find a lot of them in the animation meme community. Furries and anthro animals. Not mursuiters.

Cringetopia,fe0hlar,t1_fe0b3wu,1578813553.0," “Furries” are people who are fans of anthro animals. You don’t even need to make your own character to be a furry.
 I am a young furry. I just find anthro animals interesting, and that’s the case for most people! There are a lot of furries who fursuit, some who mursuit and some fucktards like this, who are zoophiles and gross cunts. Some people are into NSFW artwork (which, all fandoms have nsfw art). Just please don’t spread false information like this, because it is not true at all."

Cringetopia,fe0g8ai,t1_fe07gag,1578812921.0,"That’s not true at all though. I used to be a furry and recently rejoined the fandom. all the furries I know don’t like furry nsfw. Of course, lots of furries will like furry nsfw, the same reason a big fan of a series or movie would like nsfw of their series/movie. I personally love the artwork. Not interested in fursuit at all.
Either way, a small amount of people are in it JUST for sex. A lot of people are in it for the community/art and get dragged in nsfw because it gets to be a big part of their life/life style."
