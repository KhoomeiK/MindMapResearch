news,feo0ia2,t1_fenvois,1579293510.0,It's relatively common to DC people with that kind of BP if they don't have symptoms. This guy did so that's bad. But if you came in with that they'd probably give you something IV or maybe even orally and send you home.
todayilearned,fels8d6,t1_felpz1k,1579229652.0,"They usually will. They're generally pretty respectful about it, but legally, they aren't obligated to."
todayilearned,felnxmr,t1_feln0d2,1579226703.0,"I think it would be interesting as well, I work in Indiana and the organ donation person I talked to said she can't think of a single time they'd actually taken one against the families wishes. I'm sure it happens but it's definitely rare."
todayilearned,felfbvv,t1_fel1nm4,1579220836.0,"In theory that makes sense, but organ donation, in general, doesn't really work like this. All organ donation is based on a lot of factors besides need. Especially lifestyle choices and subjective decisions. Alcoholics don't get livers, smokers don't get lungs, etc... that's how the system works. Arguably opting in to organ donation is different than choosing a physically unhealthy lifestyle but you can't argue that organ donation should be solely based on need. The ethics of donation have been debated since we figured out how to do it and it simply isn't done that way."
todayilearned,feleyxy,t1_felaz30,1579220599.0,"Doesn't matter, typically eligibility to actually donate isn't looked at until you actually die. Anyone can opt-in (in countries like the US) regardless if they can actually donate or not. So no one would even know they can't donate until they try to take the organs."
todayilearned,feletxb,t1_felalvk,1579220505.0,"I don't know how it works in this country, but assuming it is similar to the US, everybody can opt in to donate organs. No one even looks at eligibility until you die. In the US, even if you aren't registered, you still get screened for eligibility on death. It might be a short screening if they see ""oh they have x disease we can't use them"" but everyone gets screened. On top of that, there are a LOT of conditions you would think would make someone totally ineligible that doesn't. That's why it is important to still register in opt-in countries even if you don't think you can donate. There's a surprisingly high chance you can, and even if you don't they are going to look anyway. The difference is if you haven't already signed up they're going to call your family and ask them for permission instead of them knowing your wishes."
todayilearned,feldyke,t1_fel3or5,1579219928.0,"That isn't really a reason to opt-out. Assuming the system is the way it is in the US (which it probably isn't and I have no idea), you get screened anyway. It doesn't make any sense to opt-out just because you think you won't be able to donate because they are going to check anyways and they take organs/tissues from surprising number of conditions you would assume would make you ineligible. Opting out because you think you aren't eligible, or even if a doctor has told you you aren't eligible, doesn't make sense."
todayilearned,feldmys,t1_fel7528,1579219710.0,"It doesn't really matter if they believe they are unable to donate. (In the US) Whether or not you actually sign up as a donor your State's organ donation team screens you for eligibility regardless when you die. The only difference is if you haven't already signed up they ask your family after you die if they can have your organs and they have to figure out if you would be ok with that themselves. Many people who have conditions that they believe would make them ineligible actually are able to donate organs or, more likely, tissues. Even if they can't, that doesn't make them any different from anyone else, as very few people are able to donate organs anyway."
todayilearned,feld9d0,t1_fel5qi1,1579219457.0,"That's not really how it works. There is an in-depth screening done to determine medical eligibility to donate when the time comes. Per the government's organ donor site:

&#x200B;

>Don't rule yourself out from being an organ donor because you have a health condition. You're always encouraged to register.Â Even with an illness, you may be able to donate your organs or tissues.  
>  
>The transplant team will determine what can be used at the time of your death based on a clinical evaluation, medical history and other factors. Even if there's only one organ or tissue that can be used, that's one life saved or improved.

Even with serious medical conditions, many people can still donate certain things, such as corneas. When you die or are put in a situation (coma) that might qualify you for donation you will be thoroughly screened by a member of a donation team whether you're listed as an organ donor or not. You say you don't want to register because you don't want to waste the transplant team's time but if you die in a hospital they are going to screen you anyway, and if you are eligible, ask your family if it's ok to take your organs or tissue. Signing up as a donor only makes this part easier on your family because they don't have to make that decision themselves."
todayilearned,felcfsv,t1_felaf6y,1579218910.0,"No, they cannot.

> If you signed up as a deceased donor in your state registry and you are over 18, then you have legally authorized your donation and no one can overrule your consent. Signing a card isn't enough. If you are under 18, your parents or legal guardian must authorize donation.

It is a common misconception that family can overrule your decision to donate your organs. If you are properly registered as an organ donor and over 18 your state's organ donation team can and will take your organs regardless of your family's wishes if you qualify as a donor and they need the organs badly enough.  Depending on the situation they may try and comply with family requests but they are under no obligation to do so per federal law."

AskReddit,fd4c4ec,t1_fd349gm,1578166288.0,"If you're using an AED sure, you do what it tells you. In a medical show (and the hospital) they have regular defibrillators that require the user to decide when to shock. In that case, it is harmful because you're wasting time when you should be doing CPR, pushing meds, and figuring out why their heart stopped."

todayilearned,fcjb7la,t1_fcj97bj,1577681933.0,"It can be. You're only supposed to have 4 grams a day and it's pretty easy to get 500mg extra-strength pills, at least in the US. Plus Tylenol is also included in dayquil, Nyquil, mixed with opiates, and is in a bunch of other stuff. If you're sick and don't read the labels you can hit that pretty quick."
todayilearned,fcjaycp,t1_fcj7yof,1577681729.0,That's...not true. Acetylcysteine is a highly effective antidote to Tylenol overdose as long as it is given within 8-10 hours of the OD.
LifeProTips,fbv89fg,t1_fbutsqm,1577127084.0,"Not in the US, it's illegal for them to do so."
LifeProTips,fbv7wta,t1_fbuyomu,1577126949.0,It's illegal to tell the authorities in the US as a matter of routine. (the cops would need a warrant). It will probably end up on your list of health problems.
LifeProTips,fbv7q84,t1_fbuykzh,1577126871.0,In the US it is incredibly illegal for them to do so because of HIPPA. Thousands of dollars in fines and puts your license at risk.
LifeProTips,fbv76wf,t1_fbuzxcq,1577126628.0,"> these people are not the cops, but they sure as fuck WILL call them on you. 

That's literally illegal in the US. No doctor or nurse with any common sense is going to open themselves up to thousands of dollars in fines and unemployment just to get one of the hundreds of patients they see a month arrested on some weak drug charge."
LifeProTips,fbv6s9s,t1_fbuoi9t,1577126451.0,If you're in the US that isn't true and is incredibly illegal.
LifeProTips,fbv6pes,t1_fbv0gxm,1577126416.0,HIPPA legally obligates Health care providers to keep drug use private unless law enforcement has a warrant/subpoena. Revealing that information puts them and their place of employment on the hook for thousands of dollars in fines and puts their license at risk. It's literally not worth it for them to cooperate with law enforcement outside of a warrant.
LifeProTips,fbv6cn0,t1_fbv0ggd,1577126245.0,Weed very much affects different drugs such as anesthesia. That's like... the main thing they look for with illicit drug use.
AskReddit,fbtmkqr,t1_fbth2cc,1577084937.0,Typically speaking they won't do transplants on people with active addiction problems. I know I took care of a patient in alcoholic liver failure once who needed a transplant. They wouldn't even work him up to see if he was medically able to have a transplant until he had been sober for 6 months.
