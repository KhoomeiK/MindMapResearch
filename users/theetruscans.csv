I think there are some things that we *know* are good (or incredibly useful to society, like organ donation). We also know that there are psychological hang ups people get stuck on.

There's a line here. My point was not that you can insult minorities in the name of humor necessarily, I'm sorry if it came out that way. 

For an example of what I mean: I work with the son of a Jewish family. Onw of the things they like to do is make fun of Jews. When they sit around their dining table they sometimes crack jokes about Jews. 

You can make a joke at a minorities expense without being malicious. 

I believe nothing should be off limits in comedy, but if you're making a joke about something iffy you better be sure it gets laughs.

I really don't think an kind of humor is morally equal to another. I mean are jokes praising God the most moral? Why does morality matter in comedy?

It's been so pushed by our society as well that it's even more taboo. Not only are you outwardly insulting them to their face (whether you think you're joking or not), you're also breaking very strict societal norms.

This is me arguing that calling black or gay men nigger/faggot to their face classifies as a hate crime. I argued this because those were the points you made, my post has nothing to do with swastikas.

PS: faggot doesn't mean cigarette in America, not sure if you're British but if not, don't hide behind that. Also if it was ""call a cigarette fag"" or ""this whole group of people wants us to stop using that word out of consideration"" I think I'd just find a new word for cigarette."

I'm not going to judge this thread, I don't want to get into a Reddit swastika debate. 

I'm just saying that you finding something offensive absolutely doesn't mean it wasn't meant to be funny. 

Though I agree people like the ""Schrodinger's douchebag"" do exist. 

Not just to be pedantic, since I'm sure not only men do this, it should be ""a person who..."""

agedlikemilk,fdp1k8a,t1_fdlau33,1578617804.0,There's still malice there. The idea that people are bad so we should kill them doesn't just come from Fox news. It comes from generations pushing that idea until people don't question the moral legitimacy
BoneAppleTea,fdp1gh1,t1_fdoj95o,1578617735.0,"It's funny to me, the idea that one of the biggest reasons people criticize baby boomers is because of how they look at other generations. ""snowflake millennial"" comes to mind. 

We decided that we don't like being grouped up and generalized, because we're all different and unique. 

Sure there are people who think the ""boomers ruined the world"" (the extreme boomers think the same way about us) but overall it seems to me that the main Boomer stereotype up until recently was what I've mentioned. 

Now in the last 6 months/year all the young people in America *hate* them. I mean ""shut up Boomer"" was the most common phrase written on Reddit just a couple months ago. 

I cannot believe that we think we are better than these people while we start to do the same thing. I know you're just linking a subreddit but just the idea that it exists bothers me. I mean how badly do you guys want to shit on these people that you'll devote an entire section of this website to it? How much time do some people spend looking for quality posts about how *stupid* the people you live alongside are?

I really think it's pathetic."

BoneAppleTea,fdp0aly,t1_fdovlnv,1578616959.0,"Did you really just wrote that out and sign off on it enough to post it?

anti-Semitic people (in America at least) hate Jews. There are no intellectual anti-Semitics who ask about your heritage to make sure they're hating the right people. 

I guarantee 99% of anti-Semitic people don't know the difference between the two. 

I don't know if you're making a comment about the literal meaning of the word or what, but I can't believe people upvoted this useless distinction. 

I've argued this many times on Reddit, the original meaning of the word is useless now. If people use it to mean ""you hate Jews"" then that's just what it means now."

Home Depot has boxes for pretty cheap, I think ~10 cents a box. 

If you really can't pay or find any then dumpster dive. Avoid restaurants (Dunkin is actually a great go to). Go to strip malls and find that little back area with the dumpsters. Some should be labeled ""cardboard only""
