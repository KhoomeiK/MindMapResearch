SuicideWatch,fcitbfn,t3_ehegyu,1577669308.0,"I'm 23. I feel you, been also told to start settling down. I used to freak out that I'm still single, broke and have nothing much accomplished yet. We're not old, we're like the 14 year-olds of adulthood. I gave myself that pressure of finding someone by this age and having a family of my own etc. Now that I'm 23, I tuned out from that pressure I caused myself and those coming from others. I'm living my life how I want to live it. Others can watch, but can never dictate what we should or shouldn't do, can't or can do."
SuicideWatch,fcinfa8,t3_ehds58,1577665501.0,Be as angry as you want. Be angry at life and everything. But don't think nobody would miss you. Your lovely daughter would definitely miss you.

Nobody IN the country would be offended by how they worded it. It's not like they're internationally known. I don't even know about them until I came across this whole thing and I'm from the same country as them."

happy,fc3demb,t1_fc37168,1577387331.0,skulle ha gjort det samme.
AmItheAsshole,fc2ckqc,t3_efnyg4,1577352222.0,"ESH - Assuming that you know your step-father well enough, it's kind of stepping on his boundaries to gift you brother what seems to be an inappropriate item (at least from his bigoted point of view). Bigots are bigots. And trying to shove a different viewpoint on them causes them to lose their minds. You should've have considered that since your brother is still very young and is still under his care. Still, he's the bigger A."
niceguys,fb9icom,t3_ec48xf,1576639357.0,I bet his idea of a dating site would backfire on him if he blindly matches with someone outside of his 'realistic standards'
