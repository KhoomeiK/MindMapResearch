AmItheAsshole,fdvn1vo,t3_en0zfr,1578749268.0,YTA. Your daughter is being punished for what your wife is doing. As well your putting that on your daughters record because the mom refuses to listen. Now your daughter doesn't get the chance to show you she can be more responsible and has to deal with what her mom did for 2 more years. What if your daughter wised up up in a few month or so? I suspected this is going to create a lot of issue with you and your daughters relationship. I would have had a talk with your daughter first.

I mean were getting there. But I'd be upset too tbh I hate birth control it messes with my hormones makes me depressed and moody I would not be with a partner who feels I have to take it.

Also birth control can be expensive too that adds up. But a kid is more expenisve so why is he complaining lol"

AskWomen,fc48kgj,t3_eg0pxt,1577409543.0,"I'd say dont focus on other people's relationships. It can make you feel like theres something wrong with you or make you uncomfortable. Just work at your own pace. I feel like that helped me alot in my first relationship.  I'm trying to do that again now and not compare where I'm at with other people my age. 

Also you dont have to give every person who's into you time of day. You waited already what's a few more months or weeks lol 

And maybe you dont have to act like your partners mother in a relationship. You should be treated like a person not a housekeeper or a cook. 

Also wish I knew that I should expect reciprocal sex. Or well someone who matches my level with that. I think that goes with all relationships"
