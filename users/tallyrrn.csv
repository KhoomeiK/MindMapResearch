relationship_advice,fej3nvp,t1_feilxim,1579155687.0,"No invalidation meant, simply debating from a different view point. 
I would argue the opposite; marriage was about status historically. In very recent times it has become about monogamy. As our society has evolved. 

Normal is such a relative word. Common is a better term. I would consider threesomes extremely common and therefore “normal” between the stories from the 60s free love and current discussions. Just gotta be open to talking about it. Orgies, BDSM, swinging - if you are in that society it becomes “normal”. 

What I do agree with you on tho is the amount of partners could indicate hypersexuality and is out of the realm like sex addiction, porn addiction where the sex and need for sex gets in the way of basic functioning. 

OP if you’re reading, you should make sure these hookups aren’t interfering with the rest of your life.

[The body had apparently been washed by the killer. Short's face had been slashed from the corners of her mouth to her ears, creating an effect known as the ""Glasgow smile"". She had several cuts on her thigh and breasts, where entire portions of flesh had been sliced away. The lower half of her body was positioned a foot away from the upper, and her intestines had been tucked neatly beneath her buttocks.The corpse had been ""posed"", with her hands over her head, her elbows bent at right angles, and her legs spread apart.] from Wiki"

As for the point of marriage being about monogamy - ever hear of open marriage? Polygamy? Concubines? Marriage is actually a religious ideology and a legal status. 

Also if your argument is that marriage = monogamy and you’re anti-marriage then does that mean you’re anti-monogamy?"

She wants to keep you in her back pocket. She wants you back because she wants control. She doesn’t respect you because you don’t respect yourself. 

This on-again, off-again relationship is one of the worst I’ve seen. It will never work. You don’t love each other, you’re confusing love with lust/control/insecurity/selfishness/immaturity. I don’t know how old you are but this relationship is basically like a 19 year old that doesn’t know what the fuck they are doing. 

Sever yourself from this toxic situation and this toxic person so you can focus on your own issues. Build up self-respect and self-love. Until then be prepared to keep getting dragged in this downward spiral."

TrueCrime,fefmdde,t1_feflmmn,1579059441.0,Agreed. Dahmer was able to pick up guys with his looks cuz he wasn’t as charming as Bundy (at least without alcohol). I think the type of killer they are makes a difference too: process versus product. Product doesn’t need to put much effort into gaining trust (see Dennis Nilsen/Richard Ramirez) whereas process I think they need to get the victim to really let their guard down so they can draw out the killing. I’m a huge fan of MINDHUNTER and seeing Ed Kemper portrayed by Cameron Britton made me really interested in him and learning about him and I think he’s extremely smart. But he was still an emotionless necrophiliac and did so many fucked up things! Interest and disgust not mutually exclusive but interest and attraction is.
