LSD,ffe0w8t,t1_ffc6i8s,1579833823.0,"Yeah that's a nice mellow trip.  Listen to music, maybe go outside, simply just vibe.  Honestly 250ug may seem like a lot and a lot of people will tell you to start small but my best experience was off of two tabs--i'll be honest it was terrifying at the time but I have learned so much from it and it has made my life way better and its been a year since i took it and its been the best year of my life and I attribute it completely to this strong trip I had on probably 250-300ug"
awakened,ffe0b9z,t1_ffdya6z,1579833400.0,"In a very literal way homie! Everything in the observable universe that can be experienced with the senses is composed of matter, including your own body! The matter is composed of molecules, and those molecules are made up of atoms.  The atoms themselves are comprised of particles--protons, neutrons and electrons.  The protons and the neutrons can be broken down into even smaller particles called quarks which are 'elementary' particles in a sense that they are the smallest 'stuff' in the universe.  They cannot be broken down any further.  Like quarks, electrons are also elementary.  So all objects, artificial and biological, are ultimately composed of the same 'stuff.'  The interesting thing about this stuff is that because an object cannot be made out of itself, it must be made out of nothing.  The argument that wood and rock are composed of wood and rock does not work here because they are at their most elementary state composed of elementary particles.  But despite the particulate, separate nature of the micro universe, there is paradoxically a singularity about it.  We have scientifically proven that all reactions have equal and opposite reactions and that no matter can be created or destroyed: newton's third law and the first law of thermodynamics.  So if the universe is infinite in nature, it never began, because things that are infinite have no beginning or end.  So if we never began, we were never created we have been here the whole time and we will be here forever, our energy constantly being recycled throughout the universe. 
There is a natural phenomenon that has been proven with the large hadron particle collider called quantum entanglement which proves the possibility of superposition.  It proves that when two particles share the same special proximity in the space-time continuum they become one to the point that they are indistinguishable from one another, but when those same two particles are separated at vast distances throughout the cosmos they still react with one another.  I think this is why the big bang makes the most sense.  If all particles were all entangled into one (hence all particles being 99.9999999999999% composed of empty space), and that particle expanded into what we call the universe today, then we are all equal parts of the same whole, we are all one consciousness.  I mean, at the end of the day you brain is physical, but your mind is not.  You brain is inside of your skull, but your mind is not physical.  It is seemingly nowhere and everywhere at the same time.  In fact there is another elementary particle that is different from the previous ones I named in a sense that it is not matter because it has no mass.  This elementary particles is the foundation of all light and it is called the photon.  Our brains run on electromagnetic radiation which is composed of these photons, which are literally made out of nothing.  The only reason we conceive any of the universe at all is because this light sources our consciousness and allows us to observe the matter.  All ancient religions try to explain this differently using different metaphoric parables but they are all explaining the same entity under a different pseudonym, and that entity is consciousness.  There is a quote that was written in the Gospel of John around 2300 years ago that states in reference to God, ""In Him is life and that life is the light of all mankind,"" and we can see that the light of all mankind is the electromagnetic radiation that sources consciousness.  So if god is light, then god is literally consciousness.  We are all one infinite consciousness.  We are all equal parts of the same whole.  We are all literally god playing hide-and-seek with himself and this is what Allan Watts meant.  We are one consciousness but our egos separate us and masquerade our truest form for the experience of duality.
We are a 'manifestation' of God because we are manifestation of consciousness.
Everything is illusory, this has already been proven--but the experiences are realer than anything tangible."

Know yes, though negative and positive are nothing more and nothing less than byproducts of our eternally neutral state, we play hide in seek for the experience of playing hide and seek.  It seems you have a nihilistic view on the state of things, and when you wake up it can be hard not to.  But though we are all each one primate out of billions of primates hurdling through space on one out of over a trillion planets in one out of over a hundred billion galaxies, quantum mechanics and particle physics *proves* that every single movement, every single action we take effects every particle in the universe infinitely.  Our micro actions have macro effects on the whole of existence.  We also have the ability to be aware of our own awarenss.  We have subjectivity.  The meaning of life is literally to create meaning, and though it is grounding to allow yourself to stay aware of your true nature, that does not mean we shouldn't experience this three-dimensional opportunity in front of us. The ego exists for a reason.  I think we would be really bad at playing hide-and-seek without it.  Everything is illusory OP, but the experiences are real."

Not long ago we didn't have the ability to obtain vast amounts of information via internet, and now we look up pretty much anything.  Someone in America can have friends in the United Kingdom or India without seeing them once in person.  I think we are learning more, our consciousness is very powerful and we are *capable* of processing as much information as we desire.  I think its important for people to reach out to like minded individuals with similar experiences for advice.  It's a matter of hearing other perspectives and opening up your mind. Everything should be taken with a grain of salt, but hearing new ideas can broaden your own personal philosophies and refresh your own personal awakening.  I don't think it's about having someone hold our hand, I think it's about provoking conversation that invokes connection in not just a dualistic sense but a singular one too.

We’re all ‘it’.  And we’re all connected to one ‘soul’ but we do not have the ability to see past the ego in this state of consciousness."
highdeas,ff8lz7v,t1_ff8ljm3,1579685080.0,"You already create the universe. You are connected to everything else and everything you do effects every other particle in the universe infinitely. You know how like you have your own thoughts? And every passerby you ever meet has their own thoughts? Like two separate conscious beings? Think about it like this: There is only one consciousness that exists. Consciousness is a singularity. We are all connected to it. Dualism—the illusion of multiple different beings—was created by source consciousness—the singularity—to expand consciousness and have dualistic experiences. So when we are born and realize we are our own person and there are other people, our parents cater to our ego by giving us a name and teaching us right from wrong. When we go to school and see the outside world more every passerby we meet also caters to our ego until all of our quirks and all of our hobbies and ethics and concepts we identify with become who we are. So we have this unique ego that is a complete and total construct of internal stimuli—genetics, and external stimuli—the environment (society).  We have these polar concepts of good and evil or love and hate or up and down or light and dark but one cannot exist without the other because its impossible. You can’t have only good because there would be nothing to put it on context to. Things would simply be the way the are. Realistically these poles are negative and positive byproducts of the neutral state manifesting in what we call reality. Just like the universe is infinitely neutralizing itself with negative and positive energy. Objectively there is no meaning but subjectively we create it. Another paradox. it’s all made out of the same stuff recycling infinitely at the most elementary level and we are all just different archetypes of one entity."

highdeas,ff8l1qi,t1_ff8kt0e,1579683653.0,"Lmao. Well it’s a simulation but probably not an AI. More like a simulation that created itself (consciousness being the simulation). Like think about it. Your brain runs on electromagnetic radiation that is composed of photons—light. The only reason we conceive anything at all is because of these photons that are the source of our consciousness. But even photons seemingly don’t exist. They have no mass. They are intangible. This is why the cia has a declassified document on how the universe is a hologram.  We are literally consciously creating the universe because the ONLY way any matter can be conceived is through this electromagnetic radiation that sources consciousness that gives us sensory abilities and imagination. All religions try explaining it differently though. They all explain consciousness under different God-pseudonyms. For example in the Bible there’s a quote in reference to God saying, “In Him was life and that life was the light of all mankind.” Turns out the ‘light’ of men is literally consciousness. And if god is the light of men, then god is consciousness. Most religious texts are just written in metaphoric parables that people take literally. We are a manifestation of god because we are a manifestation of consciousness. Everything is illusory but the experiences are real."

Existentialism,ff8hfww,t3_eryrtz,1579678647.0,"This is a concept that should be at the framework of every culture and all of society.  It has always boggled my mind how people generally do not care so much about the bigger questions of life.  This is NOT mental illness.  Nikola Tesla, Albert Einstein, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle,  Jung and Freud, and many more extremely intelligent scientists and philosophers throughout history all zeroed in on the biggest questions because once you begin to understand the depth of them, they become infinitely more interesting and provoke uplifting shifts that ignore societal constraints.  But there is an aspect of polarity that slices through the whys and the hows of existence itself, though intriguing, sometimes nourishing even, they can also lead to existential crisis.  These questions are so stacked that they can cause nausea.  Like all things, the universe I paradoxical.  It literally exists from nothing.  It is simultaneously infinite.  And we are all connected more than most care to believe.  Every action we take effects the entire universe infinitely, this is something nihilists do not focus on--we are each one single primate among billions on a rock hurdling through space, so how could we matter? They do not seem to realize that though infinitesimal, everything we do has macro effects on the entire universe.  

Think about the subjective state of things in the present moment. Right now.  Think about the surface your body is touching right now, the air you breathe, the nature around you--or even the room around you that is entirely manufactured.  Think about how *real* it seems.  Think about how yes, at the most elementary level we are all the same kind of infinite energy being recycled infinitely.  But also we are sentient.  We experience things.  Wonder.  Amazement.  Our species has invented contraptions allow us to see the most elementary particles and whole galaxies, and we collectively invented all the constructed concepts of society.  We even invented auditory language to consciously understand each other more accurately.  We have families, jobs, self identifications, and it all seems so real.   I think that's really what matters.  Yes, quantum mechanics and particle physics might prove that everything is illusory.  But the experiences are real."

Anxiety,fdxuaoz,t3_encdbg,1578773018.0,Definitely throughout the day and stay hydrated too. Do you think a lot about the bigger questions about the universe and existence? Things like this are seemingly so much bigger than yourself that they can cause nausea.
LSD,fdxtadt,t3_enc8ru,1578772684.0,We could just get a massive group of people in multiple people to ride any section of the TransAmerica trail and meet up with other trippers
facebook,fdxp909,t3_emdvgo,1578771466.0,I think it’s because location settings were on so the app picked up on a change in the location of their devices IP address.
FoodPorn,fdtvdir,t3_en3pvb,1578722811.0,Yes
Psychonaut,fdrw4g6,t1_fdrofhf,1578690652.0,"Yeah. Just experience the experience. I think it’s liberating to know that nothing is expected of us. 

I always keep it in the back of my mind that all things pass."
Psychonaut,fdrmg6s,t1_fdr6wo7,1578686588.0,That’s basically the message I got and I was in the same place! And yes it was overwhelmingly lonely.
Psychonaut,fdqkjtu,t1_fdqkc5z,1578668900.0,Totally agree!
Psychonaut,fdqk852,t1_fdqjzul,1578668679.0,"Totally! The way I look at it is it’s a simulation, but not necessarily an artificial one. It’s a simulation that created itself, and it’s consciousness. This is what god is. I can go further and say that at the subatomic level artificial objects created by the hand of man and the biological hands of man themselves cannot be distinguished separately from one another. We really are all made out of the same ‘stuff’"
