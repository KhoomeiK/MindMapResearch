depression,fel26mj,t3_epileo,1579212444.0,I couldn’t agree more.  I too feel like its all more trouble than its worth because there is no reward at the end of each day. It’s just same shit different day and i just want to sleep forever
childfree,fcofw6x,t3_ei4dx3,1577831253.0,I seriously think this a TYPE of person.  And seeing as the majority of people are followers they fall victim to unspoken societal expectations.   Ill never say i love my husband or child more than the other because in reality we dont love any one individual in the same way.  I love my husband in ways I can’t love a child and i love my child in ways i cant love my husband.  To say you love one more than the other is ignorant and nonsensical.

TrueOffMyChest,fc9lr9u,t3_eggusn,1577554569.0,😂 Lmmfao.  Dude i know you’re angry but im dying! Your choice of words are priceless!!! I could see this in a stand up act for reals.   Im not mocking you.  It’s truly very good wording!  Sorry the dogs are a pain though. ):
depression,fc9iu0k,t3_egptaw,1577553297.0,"I feel you.  The worst part for me is having a kid up my ass 24/7 while i cant even mentally function 
I try and do my best for my kid but i know she feels im not right. I think about suicide alot but i cant leave my kid.  My family thinks i need fuckn jesus but I keep telling them there is no fucking Jesus and even if there was a jesus hes not my shepherd because im not a god damn sheep!! What kind of a god would let toddlers and kids get raped and sex trafficked? For 1000s of years!!   What kind of a god sits there and lets 5 year olds die of cancer? Fuck religion.  And fuck this depression."
childfree,fc82ork,t3_egfxux,1577525331.0,LMMFAO that’s too funny.   Hey I’ll be your moms grandkid.   Ill do chores and yard work too.  😄
stepparents,fc6fgye,t1_fc6erb0,1577479326.0,"That “all children are special little miracles” crap gives me the red ass. Lol
Cuz its like ok so they’re saying all adults are special little miracles too? At what point do you go from being a special precious miracle to an adult asshole? Did they put an age on this shit?!?🤣"
stepparents,fc6f5vc,t1_fc5w7pu,1577479120.0,Me too!!
stepparents,fc5ruwr,t1_fc5j4s5,1577464492.0,I agree so much with that. It really is hard to even have the energy to think of sex when your entire day from wake up till 9ish pm is taking care of kids.
stepparents,fc5jhof,t1_fc5hev6,1577459292.0,I feel you.  Im like how can such a smart person be with someone so incredibly incompetent and stupid and create not 1 but 2 stupid kids with her.  🤦‍♀️
unhappyparents,fc5gmjt,t1_fc5ajqp,1577457037.0,"Awwww you’re still in love ):    Well if you still love her then you can only try right?
I love my DH but I hate hate hate his kids.  I stay because i love him.  I try so hard to make it work.   Its definitely not easy.   My sex drive has disappeared sense living with him because his kids stress me the fuck out.   But if you truly love your wife you’ll stomach the rest."
stepparents,fc5gbk9,t3_ega26s,1577456783.0,"You’re not alone.  Ive been a full time step parent for 6 years.  And now one of my own for 4 years.  Ive lost my appetite for sex completely sense moving in with my husband and his two kids SD12 and SD13
Its been nothing but stress and chaos.  I think im incapable of being aroused by him because i cant believe he made 2 incredibly stupid kids with one incredibly worthless woman who refuses to raise her kids so im stuck doing it and the resentment has put up a wall"
unhappyparents,fc4b1fh,t3_efz41i,1577411510.0,"Sometimes i wish i were a guy so i could leave and just pay child support.  If i were a man id totally fucking leave. But being as i am a mother it would be awful if i did that. I have 2 step kids thAt live here too. Id love to blow those bitches kisses as i scoot my ass on to a child free life.  Some people find it hArd to understand how others cAn fuck up and bring a child into the world and then realize you made the worst mistake of your life.  Shit happens!
If you left I totally understand why.  But if you do leave please help them financially and see the twins as much as possible. 
I cant leave my kid but if i were her dad it would probably be easier.  I may hate being a mom but im bound by blood and i love her. She grew inside me.  We are connected for life.  I would tell you it gets easier but I don’t know that yet. Im only 4 years in and its been miserable.  Im hoping once she’s in school and im not being suffocated and constantly used as a human play ground that just maybe i can breath and think again.  My advice is talk to your wife.  Tell her every single truth you feel.  If you have fallen out of love then call it quits.  You may love her but loving her is not the same as being in love.   I love my ex husband and we are still friends and our kids play together, but im not in love with him. And i never will be again."
childfree,fc3bajo,t3_efxdaj,1577385966.0,"I have a theory... im a mom.  I honestly feel that (some not all) people with kids are sooooo miserable that they try every old wives tale in the book to try and trick others into having kids so they’re just as miserable.  I read this one guys post and he hit the nail on the head. People will say things like... its so rewarding to have a kid, it’s different when it’s your own child, you’ll regret it if you dont have any, they add warmth and love to your life, they fill a void.   (ITS ALL LIES!!!!!)
Now that being said, after you have one those same people turn around and say... welcome to hell, you’ll never sleep again, say goodbye to free time and personal space.  They’re little monsters aren’t they.  So basically my theory is these people want you to be in a trap.  A miserable endless trap.   Sure i love my kid.  Cant stand my step kids.  I try to stop pregnancies.  If i can stop a couple from ruining their happiness and sacrificing their freedoms and money then I’ve done my job. I swear I should write a book on why not to have kids. 
Unless you have a disposable income, theres no way having a kid will be rewarding.  Your sister probably wants you to fall victim to parenthood.   Its basically slavery but we aren’t allowed to call it that. But what else do you call it when you wait on this tiny person 24 fuckn 7 no matter if your sick or mentally exhausted.  Endless meals,diapers, sippy cups,tantrums, insomnia, messes, constant touching without your consent, vomit, toys, whining.  The list goes on😩
Im exhausted before i wake up"
depression,fc35hu6,t3_eftv8l,1577381931.0,"I feel you.  Ive cut ties with family and friends for multiple reasons.  Im too depressed to give a fuck about anything 
Im only alive because of my kid. I care about her"
childfree,fc2690u,t1_fc1ozes,1577342282.0,"I feel like I’ll eventually be great friends with my daughter once shes more of a person.  For those of you that haven’t raised a child let me say having a kid from the ages of 1-5years is like having a wild animal that you have to tame.  Its hard. Its frustrating. Theres a lot of crying including the adults.  Its not easy. But once she’s more human than animal ill probably like her.  She’s good for the most part. But when shes angry dear god the tantrums.  When they’re sick or tired the fuckn tantrums!! I know it’s normal but its a phase I absolutely can’t stand 
I want to have a full coherent conversation without anyone crying or getting frustrated lol.  We’ll get there. Eventually"
childfree,fc2615b,t1_fc1ojrx,1577341989.0,I grew up the same way. I was poor so its not like i had the opportunity to be spoiled 🤣
childfree,fc1k2an,t1_fc1h6wg,1577321102.0,Omg!  They get worse as they age. I hate to see the entitled adults they will probably become
childfree,fc1fr2r,t3_efi464,1577317430.0,"Lol.  No its not just for men here.  There are moms like me here as well.  Moms who aren’t afraid to admit they fucked up by having kids. Moms that are sick of other women who do nothing but talk about their brats. I left all social media and cut ties with my closest friends because i cant stomach all their mom bullshit anymore.  Its like some women completely lose their identity and only have enough space left in their brains to talk about their damn kids. And god forbid you say children aren’t all perfect precious little angels. Noooo.  Everyone freaks out and calls you a horrible person
Im basically friendless now because my kid isn’t the center of my god damn universe like my friends kids are to them."
childfree,fc1fc2a,t3_efh2fn,1577317072.0,You’re absolutely right.  I enjoyed literally EVERYTHING more before kids. Kids have added zero joy to my existence.  If anything i feel like im in the negatives. Like negative zero+infinity.    I got 1 kid of my own and im a step mom to 2 step kids that live with me and husband.  Its miserable.  I long for my life before kids.  The peace and quiet. No drama. Everything is clean. And money to spend on me. The free time!! God the free time!!!! 😭😭😭 gone are the good times
childfree,fc1eu6d,t3_efhczn,1577316647.0,Wow!!! Ive never had any kids in my family behave thAt way.  Bless your heart I would’ve had a hard time holding my tongue in that situation
depression,fc0vmsx,t3_efi4dz,1577300846.0,"Whoever tells you crying doesn’t help is scientifically wrong!   Crying does help. It releases chemicals

introvert,fc0vcrl,t3_ef86u0,1577300622.0,"I know exactly how you feel. And at some point in my 20s and now in my 30s with kids ive learned that if you say no enough, eventually they quit asking. 
They may beg and beg but it’s your life and you don’t have to say yes just because you love your family."
childfree,fc0uj1w,t3_ef9cjr,1577300006.0,I really feel for your young nephews.  I hope it all works out. This kind of thing stays with a person their whole loves. They’re going to need as much love and support as they can get from you and your family.  Best wishes and my condolences for you and your family.
childfree,fc0u609,t1_fc01b4e,1577299776.0,It is hard. And no most parents wont admit anything wrong that they feel. Which is why i was seeking help from people who dont know me.  I just want to share my feelings with people who feel the same way and hear how they cope with it because its so lonely not knowing others feel like this.

childfree,fbzevyb,t3_ef9cjr,1577244388.0,And this is why I haven’t killed myself. I fucked up and had i kid even though i hate kids.   I think about suicide every second of every day but i take care of my kid and i make sure she is happy. It isn’t her fault. She didn’t ask to be here. As much as i wish i was dead I cant leave my 4 year old without a mother.
stepparents,fby22on,t3_eevzh4,1577206214.0,I feel you. I have 2 step daughters and i hate their existence
TrueOffMyChest,fbxmgg9,t3_eemjex,1577193878.0,Well thank you. And yes i do regret having a kid.   It sucks so much.  I love my kid. But parenting is a thankless job that never has a day off. It’s pretty miserable
TrueOffMyChest,fbxa756,t3_eemjex,1577176595.0,I feel you. If I didn’t have a fucking kid to raise id probably kill myself.  Ive lost interest in the living. Nothing makes me happy anymore.  Everything is too much effort.  And im tired of using the toilet.  I know that’s an insane statement but im so fuckn tired of my body needing to use the restroom and eat.  Im tired of eating and drinking and waking up. Im so done with it all.
depression,fbx8cvh,t3_eeikn5,1577173966.0,I would say it gets better but fast forward 4 years i too wish i was dead.  I don’t really have anything helpful to say. Just that you’re not alone.    Parenting fuckn sucks.  Its the worst thing ive ever experienced and i wish it was like other jobs where you can quit. But you can’t.  I cant wait for my kid to start kindergarten and get the fuck out of my hair.

childfree,fbe1u7l,t1_fbdtqnj,1576776331.0,Not at all. I hate decisions I’ve made that lead to my life.
childfree,fbd0ylr,t3_eciyq5,1576741529.0,I have a kid. But before i had a kid I firmly believed children shouldn’t be allowed in restaurants and other various public establishments.  After having a kid i still believe this.  Lol children under the age of 8 need not be anywhere other than schools or kids establishments. I stand strong on this one. Kids are rude loud little asswipes.  Im a mom and i approve this message

childfree,fbba7c2,t3_ecf2mk,1576696240.0,I have a kid and 2 step kids.  I love my kid but I’ve always hated kids and i still do. No i dont hate my kid.  Im not fond of my step kids. I say bravo to all you child free humans. You figured out life is better without the little leeches sucking you dry. I don’t find it offensive to brag about how your quality of life is better without children.   I didn’t read or learn how much some parents hate being parents until after I already had one.  Had i read more things like these topics before hand I definitely wouldn’t be a mother!! Be happy and enjoy your child free lives.  Ignore the haters. They’re miserably jealous.  🤣
childfree,fbaw1r5,t3_ec9nvv,1576687997.0,I have a kid. I hate kids.  Im sick of EVERYTHING being about kids. Fuck kids and people who like them.
childfree,fb2eian,t3_eb4efa,1576449591.0,Dont ever have kids. I regret having one. I have 2 step brats also. I go to bed wishing to die in my sleep every night just to escape this miserable existence.  I didn’t feel like this before i was a mom/step mom.  But now i just wana die because i cant undo having a kid
