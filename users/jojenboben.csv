AskMen,ff5y9l0,t3_erlbbu,1579614152.0,"Met someone for a coffee and he asked if I could get him a meal as he was on his way and didn't ant to wait in a line. When he got there he never paid me for it. Onky he wanted to talk never asked me anything so I just listened to a weird recount of his former ex wife. Even more awkward hug at the end, like he didn't want our bodies to touch. I blocked him asap"

MurderedByWords,fehxy7b,t1_fehrjgt,1579126096.0,Agree. I hate them. They know that their cups make up a major percentage of litter found in Canada and what do they do? Remove garbage receptacles from their own drive thru cause they just don't want to deal with it. Fuck them and their shitty coffee.
