The one I have now is awesome, but it took a while for me to find her. I talk with her pretty openly about my sex life and interests, and the only thing she’s ever reacted to in an obviously negative way was the vampire gloves. She wasn’t even mean or judgmental, I think the idea of being spanked with them just freaked her out a little lol. I do hope you find a good therapist to talk, not just about this but about the rest of the issues in your life. I also hope you can be honest with your boyfriend. It sounds like you guys are really committed to each other, and I seriously doubt your love for blowjobs is an issue for him ;)"
BDSMAdvice,fei695c,t3_eozt11,1579131206.0,"I think you and I have similar urges, though mine are a bit lesser than yours appear to be. I have long thought I have some sort of oral fixation. I used to smoke, I love to suck on lollipops and hard candy generally, I tend to touch my lips, I wear lipstick almost every day, and I LOVE oral sex. Giving my husband/dom blowjobs is one of my favorite ways to serve him, and I often feel compulsions to just suck him. I feel that way at home, in public, with family around, even when my husband and I aren’t physically together. And, as you describe, I crave his cock in my mouth flaccid or hard.

I’m not really sure how to advise you. Don’t put too much stock in any of Freud’s theories beyond their being interesting. If you write or make art, you could try making oral sex the focus of your art. I do both :) Otherwise, maybe you and your boyfriend could come up with a blowjob schedule. You guys write out a week-by-week outline for when you will for sure give your boyfriend blowjobs, and if any happen at other times during the week, it’s just a bonus. Having a schedule would give you blowjobs to look forward to, and that might help you at least target your obsessive thoughts.

Maybe talk to a therapist, especially if these thoughts are really interfering with your life. To me, it sounds like they are."

selfharm,fdso74l,t1_fdsmqu3,1578705790.0,"Oh yeah, I totally know what you mean.

Like “oh that girl is a freak because she’s a cutter” or “what are you some cutter or something pathetic like that?” For me, I’m just like stfu lol.

selfharm,fdsgpx1,t3_emxxbu,1578702400.0,"I don’t mind the term and have used it occasionally to describe myself, but I don’t use it often and don’t typically use it to describe other people. It makes sense to me to use the term to describe myself because cutting has always been my poison (not burning or hitting myself or scratching), but that’s just me personally. I think some people like labels and some don’t, and that’s fine.

I personally like to use some labels to describe myself because using them helps me relate to other people and helps me understand myself. I’m bisexual, and I love being able to describe myself that way, but I wouldn’t force another person to describe themself that way, even if their romantic and sexual interests were identical to mine.

I’m also bipolar. Being formally diagnosed as bipolar and thus being able to describe myself that way has been wonderful (as wonderful as a chronic mental illness can be lol) because it has helped me understand myself, talk to my friends and family about my issues, and take charge of my mental health treatment.

So, I’m bipolar, bisexual, and a cutter in recovery. Usually I just say I struggle with self-harm. Either is fine for me, but you do you."

I don’t know why he’s sick, but I think the theory that he was somehow given Evol/extra Evol power and that’s hurt his body is pretty good. It could be a remnant from the childhood accident he and his parents were in.

Also, that TPE is not necessarily the ultimate goal for D/s relationships. My husband and I have the D/s dynamic, and we pretty much keep it to the bedroom. We don’t want to go TPE, and there is nothing wrong with that.

Oh, and that safe wording doesn’t invalidate you submission. My goodness, so many people don’t want to use safe words because they fear it will disappoint their dom or it makes them less submissive or some such. Safe words are there for the sub and the dom. Either person can call them, and they are important to have even if they are never used. Respecting your own limits doesn’t make you less submissive, it just means you are more self-aware and responsible."

BDSMcommunity,fcj84wl,t3_ehgk93,1577679680.0,"We as people are a combination of nature and nurture, so I would think our kinks are just part of that. For me personally, I kind of figure that my sexual masochism has to be at least partly neurological. I mean, doesn’t it make sense to think my neuro wires must have gotten crossed a little differently for some pains to be pleasure to me?

You also mentioned mental health. I’m Bipolar and a self-harm addict (158 days clean!). I have issues with anxiety and PTSD as well, and a history of substance abuse issues. I’m sure I’m a little neurologically different, judging from the mental health issues I have, so who the fuck knows maybe they’re wrapped up with the kink wires lol

Really, it doesn’t matter that much, but it is interesting to think about. My husband has asked me why I think I have the kinks I have, and I really don’t know. I don’t know why pleasure is my response to some pains. I don’t know why I enjoy sexual submission and service, but maybe it’s as simple as letting go of control and serving somebody else makes me feel good. Why do I like being bound/restrained? Maybe it’s the control, being used is serving my partner. Why do I loooooove giving blowjobs? Maybe I have an oral fixation and we should ask Freud lol

I do want to specially address one thing I’ve said. I think a lot of people who struggle with self-harm who are also sexual masochists get freaked out or feel like they’re somehow in the wrong to be in both groups. For me, self-harm pain/actions and sexual masochism pain/actions are not related and do not come from the same place mentally and emotionally. The self-harm is an addiction that goes with my mental health issues and is just one thing in a list of bad coping mechanisms I have. The sexual masochism is about pleasure and connecting with my partner, not using self-inflicted pain to distract myself or try to rid myself of negative feelings.

That got a little soap box-y, sorry lol. I think it’s important to examine your kinks and make sure they don’t come from a dark place such that practicing them would be detrimental to yourself or others. Keep it SSC and practice RACK, and talk to a therapist if you need to."

I know you might feel like a failure and probably feel awful right now, but just know that everyone stumbles sometimes, and getting back up and going on is the important thing.
