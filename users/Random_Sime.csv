Personally, I remember hearing that the Atari Jaguar would be twice as powerful as the Sony Playstation out of the box because the former was a ""64-bit system"" and the latter a 32-bit system. But the Jaguar would end up being two 32-bit processors, and it died because it was expensive and had a crappy library of games."

HK I played on and off for 3 months and it took me about 50 hours to get an ending. One day I spent 3 hours in one room trying to get a vessel fragment. I still haven't made it to the White Palace. It's the only game in recent memory that has given me sweaty palms."

I get chicken thighs because I don't have to chop them up.

1kg of chicken (6 or 7 thighs)

60ml (1/4 cup) of olive oil

1 teaspoon of ginger, coriander, paprika, tumeric and cumin. Add garlic here too if that's your thing.

1/2 teaspoon of salt, pepper and cinnamon.

Mix all herbs and spices with oil to make a marinade. Put chicken in marinade in a sealed container, and leave it in the fridge for 2-8 hours.

If you're into onions, you'll want to chop one up and brown it in the pan now before you do the chicken.

Pan fry or bbq chicken for 7 minutes each side.

Make your rice however you do, but I've been buying microwavable pouches for convenience.

Serve chicken on rice.

*Note: add and remove spices and herbs as per your flavour. Experiment! When I first made this the recipe didn't call for cinnamon, but I added it and now it's more delicious to me.*"

This is how you get people doing a runner.

Seriously, why not just advertise the price as ""the price + tax""?

Nearly 20 years ago in Australia we adjusted the tax system so this and services were about 10% more expensive. We didn't keep the old prices and put ""+10% tax"" on our goods, instead we just repriced them to include the tax. Also our wages are reasonable enough that tips are optional and not necessary for the livelihood of the employees or their business."
