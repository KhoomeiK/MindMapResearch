It used to be somewhat more serious, a lot less meme-y things in game, but you'd get the occasional firebomb, rabid monkey, naked guy with a gun running around causing havoc. I used to write notes and leave them places that would lead people on a wild goose chase or clone humans and fill rooms with them.
