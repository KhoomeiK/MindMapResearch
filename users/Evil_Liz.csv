college,ff41684,t1_ff3s3ro,1579553296.0,"I disagree too! It depends on the individual and the circumstance. I adopted two puppies my senior year in addition to the cat and three aquariums I already had. Yes I have to essentially build my entire schedule around them, but I’ve had pets my whole life so I’m used to it. I could see being a first time dog or pet owner as tough, if you didn’t realize the sleepless nights potty training, having to spend hundreds on even routine vet appointments, paying for gas to drive back to the house all the time, limiting your time with friends, paying a little bit more for rent. But so so worth it :)"
AquariumMemes,ff3olei,t1_ff3khyi,1579545508.0,"The intent is not to shame or attempt to rescue individuals, but to educate and prevent this from happening in the future, leading to better animal husbandry/pet keeping practices all around"
AquariumMemes,ff3h2ay,t1_ff3616l,1579540874.0,"Your heart is in the right place and that’s a really good thing, but most people, when they’re out with friends in an unfamiliar city at night, aren’t going to go make a scene and rescue 6-8 animals they don’t have space for. Doing everything possible for animals in need is great, doing nothing isn’t, but most people fall somewhere in between"
AquariumMemes,ff2szgb,t1_ff2gwrl,1579522868.0,"There was a bowl on nearly every table, so 6-8 fish, and sure I could take one or two on a whim and get them situated, but I couldn’t take that many. And yeah I knew it would be bad taste to make a scene and ask for a manager so I didn’t, but I wasn’t going to just do absolutely nothing. Plus a few other people left reviews like “talked to the manager about their betta fish but they didn’t do anything” so that wouldn’t have been productive either"
veterinaryprofession,fep2dro,t1_fep1rxt,1579310596.0,"Yeah that job sounds really cool, I would go for it but I’m not you lol!"
veterinaryprofession,fep1jan,t3_eq9a43,1579310060.0,"Could you do both part time? Like 20-30 hours with one 20-30 hours with another? I’ve been multiple types of technician at once at different jobs, as long as they are flexible you might not have to choose. I would personally choose the primate one but I’m biased toward research, really it’s up to you and what you want to be doing on a daily basis. Also why not just shadow a vet on your free time if you get one job and you’re only working like 40 hours, you can always pop in on a Saturday and get a good 6-8 vet experience hours in a week too"
veterinaryprofession,fem4eub,t3_epuo6l,1579239391.0,"Everyone’s different about how much they need to study and what their specific goals are! I bought the prep booklet a year ahead, threw it in my trunk and forgot about it, then frantically studied a few weeks before and did fine lol. Just take a practice test first to get a general idea then try to work on your weak points. And those prep books have really good lists of commonly used vocab you should have down as well as online and written practice tests, so a prep book is worth it imo!"
todayilearned,fehprbw,t1_fehp9k4,1579121428.0,"You can go there as a volunteer or just a guest to help socialize the animals. Usually there are so many animals and even with volunteers coming through, there are just too many animals to spend enough time with each one and they can be neglected when it comes to playtime, being pet, or just generally getting attention. Personally it’s not my thing, when I wanted dogs I got a place that allowed them, dated people who like them, and got my own dogs, but everyone’s different."
vetschool,fdp6hez,t3_emjcmy,1578621129.0,"You should look at Student Doctor Network too and see about specific interview questions or experiences from the schools you’re interviewing at! There is a ton more discussion among students there than on here lol. I only did one interview but it was very casual and lots of questions on my experiences that set me apart like my specific research, my former job as a cook (??), and study abroad. I practiced working through common questions from Google and SDN and how I would answer. They are probably going to ask why you want to be a vet, so have a good thoughtful answer for that one!! I wore business professional and most people did, a few wore business casual but said they felt out of place, but either is perfectly fine. Don’t psych yourself out, you can do it"
veterinaryprofession,fdmaqvc,t3_em470w,1578544124.0,"I think about costs and debt by making a giant excel of how much it’s going to cost over 4 years. Look at the interest rates of loans you’re taking, how much you spend each month, how much for emergencies, pets, car, etc. I would do that for living with your parents going to the more expensive school, then look up actual apartments, utility, internet, gas costs of areas surrounding potential cheaper schools in addition to their tuition. Then compare the numbers. 


And of course consider the benefits of living close to home, like having friends and family to help take care of any pets or chores or just be there to talk. I live with my family and it’s so freeing to be able to leave for work, be at class all day, or take a vacation and know that petsitting is free. I make way more money working than I would be able to if I had to worry about running home to make sure my dogs aren’t neglected. And when I have personal problems I can walk in the other room and ask family for advice. And finally... I don’t have to worry about cleaning, dishes, or food for the most part which is all time out of the week you could be working, studying, or unwinding. I don’t know your family home situation, but there could be some pretty huge benefits to living at home despite the extra tuition, so really you just have to consider which is the best for you"
Sims4,fdm9r8j,t1_fdl6htr,1578543364.0,That would be awesome!! I wish they would take more bold directions with the game and really add new innovative things. To me it feels like the same game done again and again with slightly different features each time... then again I keep buying it so it works I guess lol
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdg4bew,t1_fdfq8t6,1578379493.0,It’s a cute couch sure but it’s not so nice I wouldn’t let a dog curl up on it lol
vetschool,fdcpipp,t1_fdclpfn,1578280787.0,"Yep definitely try and get an internship, that’s how I got a bunch of zoo shadowing hours and I don’t even want to do zoo med! Also just working with exotic animals should look good too if you can find a job or volunteer position"
college,fdabvd6,t3_ekc8bl,1578244305.0,"Most schools have certain rules but they don’t always enforce them in all situations... I’m sure if you talked to them about your situation they would let you live off campus. Plus you might be considered non traditional due to your age and the fact you’ve already been to college, which could put you in a different category (than 18/19 year olds living away from home for the first time). I had two dogs in undergrad and living off campus worked great :)"
college,fczz6yb,t3_ejndg2,1578111164.0,"I used to have neighbors with a bunch of cooped up pit bulls/mixes they kept locked in their upstairs bedroom. They pounded on the windows any time I walked by (I lived on the top floor with my two quiet little dogs) and pretty much never stopped barking. They tied them out in our shared driveway where they pooped all on the gravel. I had to straight up kick and tackle one once when it broke the stake out of the ground trying to get to me and my own dog. I’m sure they would be perfectly fine well behaved dogs if their owners walked them and socialized them, but sucky situation all around. When they were moving out I saw the landlord completely redoing that room so I know they had to have done some serious damage. 

Also that place was by a gas station and bus stop so lots of creepy dudes and random yelling in general lol, I just minded my own business when I lived there and people left me alone"
college,fczxwbw,t3_ejqgvf,1578110515.0,"Think about it, you only have to live this semester once, then it’s over and you don’t have to do it again. Don’t focus on the sucky things, and try to find things you look forward to, even if it’s something small like a TV show coming out soon or getting to see a friend again. Good luck and you got this"
ChoosingBeggars,fck8evt,t1_fck6wc9,1577719421.0,"Sorry when I say “big” I’m a ridiculously tiny person, so my definition of a big piece is actually pretty small. And I live in a super low cost of living area so everything is cheaper anyway and his cost was about average for a mid to high range artist in my area :)"
ChoosingBeggars,fcjbi18,t1_fcj6wd5,1577682164.0,Aw thanks happy new year to you too!!!
ChoosingBeggars,fcitwl1,t1_fciqj1t,1577669712.0,"Too true... I remember some old coworkers talking about how they couldn’t imagine paying hundreds of dollars for a tattoo when they could get one for 40 bucks, and showed me their awful scribbles. I paid over 400 for a big full color piece and it was worth every penny"
science,fc9o89b,t1_fc8s5w3,1577555660.0,"Ok I’m not super educated on this topic but I’ll give my experience. Sometimes when I feel like I’m just slogging through life I take time and just go into the woods completely by myself to walk and just slow down. It’s super boring at first and kind of painful to not be surrounded by exciting stimuli, but after a while you start to just relax and be aware of your surroundings, how your body feels, how you feel. I’m sure there are books on it too, to explain it and show you how to do it if you don’t have access to calm natural areas or whatever. But for me nature is where I can be the most mindful, kind of like meditating. And then once you know what it feels like by taking the time to do it, you start to do it automatically more and more, until it’s second nature, at least that’s how it goes for me. But yeah probably books or online resources :)"
aww,fc7tvwd,t1_fc7r903,1577518511.0,"Yeah they’re fairly smart but they don’t innately recognize or understand the danger of something if they’ve been desensitized to it, so it’s pretty dangerous to let them think that approaching equals rewards. Lots of people desensitize their horses to cars driving past on the road so they can ride their horse down the road without their horse getting frightened, so I don’t see why it wouldn’t be possible for someone to train their horse to associate approaching fast moving cars with getting rewarded... although that would be an awful idea"
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fc701lm,t1_fc6o0s4,1577493924.0,"Yep that’s what I do with my beagle. I have two dogs so I crate them when they eat because one eats so slowly and the other is a beagle lol. They are both great weights. Every time I see a fat beagle I just think it’s so shameful, there are plenty of fun ways to engage your dog and show how much you love them without giving them tons of food or letting them roam the house eating things off the ground. My beagle loves walks, exploring the dog park, playing with toys, cuddling. Yes she also loves food but despite what people say about beagles living only for food, that’s not the only thing that motivates them"
shrimptank,fc499vt,t3_eg28yq,1577410100.0,Awesome!!!!!!!
bettafish,fc48xnw,t1_fc3w9uh,1577409832.0,Yeah I found a really nice 10 gallon setup with filters and light included at Goodwill too! Sadly it had a bunch of bottles of stress coat and goldfish food so I think I know how that ended...
niceguys,fc2vmo0,t3_efsltv,1577375247.0,"Always so much hate for guys that work out and stay muscular... If anything that shows dedication, good time management, commitment to a goal, and a health conscious lifestyle. Obviously some do it only for looks but who doesn’t want to look good? What awful horrible people for working out!!"
college,fc0nqxj,t3_efg1oq,1577295423.0,"Yuck... College for a lot of people is a transition into independent adult life, so how are you going to have those essential learning experiences if you don’t have the freedom to make mistakes and learn from them?"
Sims3,fbzru5e,t3_efcvtl,1577258270.0,"Lovely lol!! Honestly that’s why I just can’t get into Sims 4, there are no horses! And the pets just feel lacking vs in Sims 3 where they’re so much fun. I wish my computer could run 3"
dogs,fb5dct7,t1_fb5397q,1576525543.0,"I had the same problem when I wanted my papillon! The first places I looked were rescues, but they all required a backyard and someone who’s home most of the day. And a lot of the dogs were no cat homes, single dog homes, tons of health problems... I just got a healthy puppy from a reputable breeder and he is big dog/small dog/cat/kid friendly since I raised and socialized him myself. He is my dream dog!"
