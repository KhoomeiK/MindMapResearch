C'Thun can empower or aid his lieutenant while we fight him off to get the Titan facility back up and running and purging the Qiraji from AQ again.

We could get to see more of what C'Thun looks like and even have him give us some tidbit from the next expansion. 

Repeat the same for Ulduar except we find that Yogg Saron's Lieutenants have basically corrupted the Keepers again and we have to free them from his clutches one last time.

In the end they could tie it into the main story as both C'Thun and Yogg basically hating us for stopping their plans again, but them actually giving us some information about how to kill N'Zoth."
