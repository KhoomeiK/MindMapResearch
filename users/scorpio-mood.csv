OnlineDating,fezaej3,t3_eqxwt1,1579455326.0,"Sorry, but I have to disagree. Not all men are like this. I get a lot of matches but not once have I been the recipient of a blatant request for sex.

I think the way I present myself on my profile (i.e. no overtly sexy photos or sexual innuendos in my bio) and the type of guy I swipe right on (i.e. no Chads) is key in avoiding this kind of behaviour.

Either that or I’m just ugly."
seduction,feywf0x,t3_equo86,1579451330.0,"Meeting someone on Reddit works if you find the right person on the right sub. I was DM’d by a guy a few months ago and we hit it off, but he’s in the States and I’m in Australia. We haven’t talked about meeting yet because we’re both super busy (me with uni and him with a new job) but if it ever comes up I will offer to travel to meet him.

Ironically I don’t think subs designed to meet people are the best way to, well, meet people. Like dating apps, the girls are inundated with messages so have a lot of choice. Meaning, if your looks/game aren’t strong enough you’ll just end up being ghosted. Some are only there looking to fill their snap map or get attention."

confession,ferlp1i,t3_eqdne4,1579355532.0,"Compulsive lying is a coping mechanism, not a personality flaw. Most compulsive liars aren’t sociopaths because they feel remorse. Most aren’t actively trying to hurt or deceive people. They’re just deeply insecure beings with low self worth. 

They’re scared to show others who they really are for fear of not being liked or accepted. This fear usually stems as a result of being shamed for expressing their true selves at some point in their life (likely early childhood).

The only way to fix it is to learn to accept the real you. Therapy is a good place to start."

If you don’t feel confident in lingerie the mere act of wearing it isn’t going to magically improve your sex life.

At the end of the day, men want to see you naked, not covered in lace/ribbon/whatever else. There’s no point parading around in $300 lingerie if you’re just going to look shy and awkward. I’m sure he will think you’re sexy in whatever you wear, whether that be lingerie or normal underwear."

Rateme,fej1225,t3_epcbj3,1579153083.0,"Weight loss will make the biggest change to your appearance. If this is something you’ve struggled with in the past I recommend finding a personal trainer who specialises in diet and workout plans for curvy clients. You will get faster results that way than if you were to try and do it yourself.

I think you should also consider getting rid of the bangs. You’ve got a round face shape so a middle or deep side part will create the illusion of a longer face.

Make all of these changes to improve your confidence and health, not because you want more guys to ask you out. That will happen organically as a result. Best of luck."

You’ve both got issues that you need to work on; he’s complacent and you’re a bit insecure (albeit sometimes rightly so). Nobody’s perfect, but as the situation stands I don’t think you’re a good match.

socialskills,fe09qy2,t3_enbh31,1578807080.0,"As someone who used to suffer from social anxiety and has since overcome it, I would like to add another point.

*Ask open-ended questions.*

Some people with social anxiety get word vomit and become overbearing in conversation. Others find it difficult to say anything at all, which usually results in the conversation dying a slow and painfully awkward death.

By asking open questions, you are not only showing that you are listening, but you are also adding fuel to the fire, so to speak. Open questions elicit longer answers. They usually begin with what, why, how and ask the respondent for his or her knowledge, opinion or feelings."

It could matter in terms of mental health however. Having an exceptionally high body could be a symptom of sexual addiction or commitment issues. Likewise, having a low body count to the point where you’re avoiding sex entirely could suggest low self esteem or past trauma.

In these cases I think it’s important to recognise that body count matters, but I don’t think that’s what you were asking. Just food for thought."
