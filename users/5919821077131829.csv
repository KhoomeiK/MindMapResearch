I saw a post on tumblr that was a screenshot of reddit where someone had a weird numerical handle/username and someone else questioned them about how they remembered it and they responded that each number corresponds to a significant date in their life and everytime they login they have a slumdog millionaire type flashback or something to that extent.

Years later when I decided to stop lurking and join reddit I blanked on a username as I didnt want to be found and I had a flashback to reading that post and decided to do the same thing except I'm paranoid so I shuffled the numbers a little bit then being the social butterfly  that I am I went back to lurking for like 6 months and forgot my username and password. When I remembered I had a reddit account I had a flashback to the day I made the account which didnt help and just kept guessing number combos till I got it right now it's muscle memory.

The anonymity part is moot now because I accidently screenshoted my username to show my friend my flair for this sub and she saw it. To be fair she was baffled by it so my plan would have worked if I was more cautious.

fatlogic,ffdj16g,t1_ffddp9k,1579821902.0,"Basically don't eat till you're stuffed and about to explode. Eat slowly and stop once you feel full not stuffed. It takes a while to recognize what being full feels if you are used to stuffing your face like me. Then stop eating when you feel not hungry, this also takes some practice I'm still working on it. It gets easier with practice. Intuitive eating taught me portion control. 

I still have not worked on learning ""natural hunger responses"" because I'm lazy. So I do intermittent fasting for that part currently."

HPfanfiction,ffd54im,t3_esyqrf,1579813605.0,"Does it have to be canon compliant? I pretend the epilogue doesn't exist. That's my headcanon. I rewote the ending mentally.

Non canon compliant ones -
* Harry helps tie up loose ends with the remaining death eaters post war then after a nice long vacation becomes a pro quidditch player
* Ron takes over the joke shop after Fred's death, he doesn't become an auror
* Hermione becomes the youngest minister of magic after working to makes the wizarding world more integrated against other species idk which dept(s) she works for before becoming M.O.M.
* Lucius Malfoy and the other death eaters get life in azkaban, Draco gets a short time because  he was a kid
* New prison system is established separate from azkaban where new criminals go to. Once the last death eater dies azkaban is shut down
* Non death eater supporters like Narcissa have to pay fines and lose most of their wealth
* Changes are made at Hogwarts where students interact with people from other houses more to prevent bigotry (not sorting till end of 1st year maybe?)
* Krum and Hermione get together a few years after the war? Not sure on this one I just don't like the main six dating each other, especially the trio

Canon compliant ones -
* werewolves don't suffer and aren't as sickly as Lupin he is an outlier because of his self-loathing
* magic is not dark or not dark, intent matters as does performance i.e. Voldemort's body spell/potion is dark not because it calls for items like dead dad's bones and Harry's blood but because they were taken by force
* Wizarding world begans to interact with the muggle world

I don't think Snape had buddies I think they were dormmates like how Harry and Ron was with Dean and Seamus. They were around each other due to being in the same house and year and that's about it.

When I see a higher up fluctuation I remind myself that a month or whatever time ago I would have been happy to be that weight and at one point I celebrated hitting that number. 

Ultimately it reminds me that as long as I keep going I will be seeing lower numbers and my higher number will continue to decrease. 2 weeks ago I was happy with 163 lbs and 165 lbs was an upward fluctuation. Today I'm happy with 161 lbs and 163 lbs is my upward fluctuation.

Just like Hermione being intelligent is something she was born with and she doesn't have to work on it. Unlike Harry's traits though Hermione can actively use her trait and work on it which she did. She spent much of her freetime reading and researching to gain more information on magic and the wizarding world. Harry did/could not work on his bravery, nobility, and quick thinking in his freetime.

harrypotter,feich4z,t1_fei8g0g,1579135280.0,"> I would normally agree about the whole show-don't-tell thing, but the thing is the things we're shown about James come from a very skewed source (his rival/enemy), and there isn't really an opportunity to show anything about James without heavy contrivance. 

I don't know what you are talking about? Are you referring to the pensieve scene in OOTP? The pensieve is objective fact it is not skewed in anyway, that's where the magic comes from. It shows everything that happened exactly the same way it happened. James Potter was 100% an asshole in that scene and Snape was 100% the victim that is fact as shown to us by JKR.

JKR also loves to go out of her way and show that he doesn't really change despite telling us that he does. Did you read the 700-800 word prequel from 2008 - http://headsup.freeshell.org/drumsticks/ - He still looks like an asshole here to me. I'm guessing this is after 7th year when ""he changes"" because of the implied Order of the Phoenix shirts. There was literally no need to write this yet she did.

It also looks like James Potter was the reason the Petunia stopped talking to Lily - https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/vernon-and-petunia-dursley - at that point they were engaged so way after ""he changed"" yet still an asshole in my opinion. He was a little ashamed? Like come on! Once again JKR goes out of her way to include this for no reason but she did.

In conclusion, James Potter was arrogant spoiled asshole who deserves absolutely nothing and is JKR's biggest failures in my opinion. She kept showing me he was an asshole while telling me he wasn't and I can't accept that. It is entirely on the author to properly portray characters and she went out of her way to fail that task."

Second one was explained by JKR. You don't just see death then see thestrals. You have to process it too. Harry didn't process anything about Cedric's death till later on in the summer so he didn't see them till beginning of 5th year as opposed to end of 4th year."

The whole time-turner thing was thanks to her in POA. She stood by Harry in GOF when Ron ditched him. In OOTP forming the DA was her idea so people learned how to defend themselves. In HBP she wasn't as prominent due to Riddle's backstory. In DH once again she stood by Harry when Ron left and they found out about the deathly hallows thanks to her.

I am by no means a Hermione fangirl or Ron basher or Harmony shipper but people very much love to downplay her material contributions to the trio. For some reason book smarts is not as important to some people, but people forget knowledge is power. Hermione definitely was the only one of the the trio to work hard and get concrete results. 

Yes, Harry was the chosen one and he was brave and quick thinking and noble but those aren't things he worked on he was just born that way. Yes, Ron was the best friend and shared his family with the others but again not much effort is required for those. Hermione actually had to read a fuckton books and do tons of research for her contributions to the trio. In other words actual work.

I agree James Potter is an asshole. I really hate the ""but he changed"" arguments people give for him. If the writer goes out of their way to show me something, James Potter being an asshole, then they have to give the same effort to SHOW not tell me anything to the contrary, him changing, if that's what they want me to believe.

JKR goes way out of her way to show his behavior is terrible like 3 times off the top of my head then handwaves it away with ""oh he changed"" bitch where? She also contradicts the source materials when she says these things but I digress.

We are told about her but never shown anything really, and it all starts in the 5th book (6th book romantically) so what we're told really comes out of nowhere for me. I'm surprised by how many fans book Ginny has to be honest.

I'm not going near movie Ginny. Bonnie Wright deserved better."

loseit,fdz3vqz,t3_enena6,1578786359.0,"I avoid this problem by not discussing my weight at all. Nothing good ever came out of the discussions for me. It's especially awful with people who are overweight/obese in my experience. Usually they haven't been in the healthy range in a long time and they don't realize those goal weights are normal.

Obesity is so normalized people forgot what a healthy weight person looks like. Avoid the drama by not mentioning weightloss goals."
harrypotter,fdsu73n,t3_en1177,1578707996.0,They can get new wands. Ron used Charlie's old one initially meaning Charlie got a second (or third) wand while the old one still worked.
harrypotter,fdqcsjb,t1_fdqawne,1578663200.0,"The new minister of magic (Kingsley I believe) allowed everyone who fought at the battle of hogwarts entry to the auror program. So Harry and Ron didn't need to go back. They never clarified what happened to those who didn't become aurors though. Only Hermione was explicitly stated to have gone back and Harry and Ron did not. The others were not confirmed, like Neville or Dean."

SkincareAddiction,fddri38,t1_fddjw4g,1578322075.0,If it works for you then I guess it should be fine. Babies' butts are sensitive so if it is safe for that skin undereye skin should be ok in my opinion.

intermittentfasting,fdbdmf5,t3_ekikgj,1578256352.0,I use a tdee calculator - https://tdeecalculator.net/ - to figure out how much my body burns without activity and eat that much. I don't worry about measuring calories out. I set it to my goal weight and pick sedentary and go from there.

If I were in a situation where I had to I'd probably eat very little and just pick at my food and take tiny bites while the other person was talking. Then I'd go stuff my face afterwards."
Baking,fd6vklq,t1_fd6edon,1578196274.0,"There's tons of buttercream I know a handful of them: 

American - easiest one, just butter and powdered sugar 

Swiss Meringue - uses eggwhites because of meringue base 

Italian Meringue - also uses eggwhites because of meringue base 

French - uses egg yolks because it is a custard base 

Russian - just butter and sweetened condensed milk 

Ermine - also known a flour or cooked flour buttercream you need to cook milk and sugar and flour to create a pudding/custard then mix it with butter 

Glossy/Korean - this one is made with cold butter and is better for realistic flowers? 

German - I forgot what this was but it exists (edit - it's butter and pudding/custard like ermine)

Edit: I forgot how to spell properly. Fixed it."
Baking,fd6rztn,t1_fd6fqw8,1578194992.0,I like simple designs and minimalist aesthetic so I like the way they look. Also as a bonus usually the cake to frosting ratio ends up being better. I've noticed people either love it or hate it. I have yet to see a person not care either way.
harrypotter,fd6lcuh,t1_fd6a69v,1578192705.0,"Death eaters were waiting over privet drive, like literally right over in the air, driving away then flying would have moved them away from the death eater and enabled them to fly without the chance of immediate ambush. It's moot because they didn't know death eaters knew the right date but it would have been an extra precaution.

Muggle witnesses for what exactly?"
intermittentfasting,fd662o6,t3_ek4l44,1578186033.0,"I weigh myself at work. My journey started with my workplace's biggest loser challenge so my initial measurements for 3 months were taken by that scale so I decided to keep using it for consistency. 

I weigh myself right after I come in before I drink water. I also weigh myself after I finish my water and use the restroom before I leave. The 2nd number is usually lower. I weigh myself every week day.

Edit: Forgot to mention I track my weight on an excel sheet and on an app called Libra. Tracking helps me stay motivated when my weight goes up instead of down."
harrypotter,fd62t12,t3_ek4o6s,1578184766.0,Ancient magic was more powerful and that there are still covens - not sure if it's the right word - of witches and wizards who practice it. I think magic got weaker but more precise when wands came in use or mainstream use. That said I'm not sure how other countries' magical societies work so I don't know if my head canon is canon compliant or not. For UK ancient magic users are hiding from wand users and live among muggles. I think the magic school in Africa has students proficient in wandless magic so there is some canonicity to wandless magic being more in use elsewhere in the world.
harrypotter,fd61jb0,t1_fd5zs4k,1578184246.0,It's because that would have made too much sense. Also why did they fly right away?  I would have drove to somewhere else then flown. They knew death eaters were waiting around the house for the charm to break that's why left before it broke.
harrypotter,fcu3azy,t1_fcu2lfn,1577971299.0,Yeah they looked so silly I probably would have stopped watching the movies if they had kept them to be honest. It would have looked worse on teenagers.

Do you mind sharing which characters you've done this for before and why? Don't want to pry I'm just curious."
harrypotter,fct111d,t3_eiprsk,1577930097.0,"Yeah I feel bad for him. The books never gave us his backstory and I can't be bothered with pottermore so I don't know why he's at Hogwarts at all. Squibs are encouraged to live in the muggle world so why was he allowed to stay at Hogwarts? How did he even end up at Hogwarts? Presumably he didn't attend because he doesn't have magic, so when and how and why is he there?"
harrypotter,fct0s3e,t1_fcsbin5,1577929915.0,"Me too, getting some backstory on the founders was cool. Also the chamber looked great in the movie. It's such a wasted opportunity though, didn't Harry and Ron literally go into the Slytherin common room? They could have seen all kinds of Slytherins there but alas no such luck. Evil Slytherins only."
loseit,fcspj1f,t1_fcslbuf,1577921850.0,"In the future try not explain yourself or provide a reason. People think they can negotiate or debate with you if you do that. Just say no thank you and if they persist firmly repeat it. They are the ones being rude by ignoring you. 

If you want to end the relationship or don't care about the other person ask them why they care about what you eat so much if they keep at it. Make them explain exactly what they get out of you eating cake or whatever. They'll will probably realize they sound like an idiot and hopefully won't do it again."
harrypotter,fcpbd50,t1_fcmmaru,1577857051.0,This actually makes so much sense. Was it confirmed? I always hated how Harry was the ***only*** person in his class to be able to resist it. Why is he such a snowflake?
loseit,fcmis9q,t3_ehzcd3,1577776965.0,"Weightloss starts in the kitchen, exercise is great but by itself it won't do much. She needs decrease her caloric intake to match her current activity levels if she wants to lose weight."

loseit,fckwdhs,t3_ehpmcs,1577734622.0,"I'm just like you, I would go to the gym at night leaving myself just enough time to drive home and shower before falling asleep. At this point I stopped exercising because I hate it and it just drains me. I will try again after I lose 20 more pounds or something.

I heard some people say do a physical activity that you enjoy instead of exercising like rock climbing or play sports with friends. I can't do either at this point in my life. I am contemplating getting a treadmill or elliptical so I can do that and watch TV at home.

If you figure out a solution please make a post. I'd love to know about it."
