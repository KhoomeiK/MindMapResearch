Reading is especially difficult for me because I can't focus my eyes and brain at the same time.

The only way I've managed this is just by waiting, and later in life, medication. If you force yourself to write while depressed, you're going to hate it anyway. Depression tints your world gray: nothing good exists, even if you write a modern Shakespeare, it might as well end up in the trash."
