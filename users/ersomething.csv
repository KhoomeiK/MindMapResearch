It is difficult to believe in something when your livelihood depends upon not believing it. 

Many of the locals depend on the coke works for a job, or at least identify it with the identity of their community. I know as someone from the south hills if you ask me about Clairton about the only thing I could think of is ‘The place win the coke plant by the Mon’
