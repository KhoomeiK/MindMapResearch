mentalhealth,fchhnd3,t3_eh6olw,1577650574.0,"I was severely depressed for years and no one cared. Parents and family just kept telling me I was being childish or that I'm just saying it for attention.
I had no gf, no real friends, and no motivation for anything.
I basically just felt numb to everything.
I barely spoke anymore than what was necessary for work and school.
Went days without eating or drinking and just sat in my room with a blank expression.
Every day was spent thinking about how I should kill myself.
There were many times I held a loaded gun to my head and didn't even sweat. Only reason I didn't end it was because I didn't want to risk survival and didn't have access to any more reliable methods.
Eventually I started smoking weed and it helped somewhat, but not enough.
Then, once I finally cared about myself enough to find real help I went to an online chat doctor and was prescribed antidepressants. I noticed the changes within the first few days.
Within a few months I felt better than I had ever felt. I couldnt even force myself to feel sad anymore. My social life improved and I was doing better at work and school.
In any case, antidepressants work. 
The side effects can really suck but it is worth it.
I can say to everyone reading that your life matters. Even if you think your life doesn't matter to others, it should matter to you. Take care of yourself and don't put off getting help like I did. 
It can and will get better, you just take that first initiative."

Talking in person...No problem.
Texting or videocall...Easy.
But a phonecall...Hell no!
Because apparently I have some sort of mental block where I immediately start stuttering and forgetting what I needed to say as soon as the word phonecall is mentioned...
