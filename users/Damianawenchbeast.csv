AmItheAsshole,fdykjk0,t1_fdxmv6a,1578780739.0,No idea what you're getting so many downvotes. You make a lot of good points. Maybe if she's dating somebody seriously enough to be spending so much time with the family she ought to be actively trying to learn the language.
fatlogic,fdqb27a,t1_fdpqd9e,1578661695.0,"Interesting. I often suspected this was the case for a lot of the ""unhealthy thin people"" that FA's like to point to. It's a problem with the modern diet, I guess. It affects people whether they are consuming a dramatic surplus or not. I wonder if this is why people like Jason Fung, who should know better, say ""It's not about the calories"". I've suspected he doesn't mean that literally."
vipassana,fdkhjv1,t1_fdhgem5,1578504012.0,It seems like you already started with vipassana... Do you want to continue the same teachings or just do something different? Do you have any particular place in mind?
vipassana,fdh4r1p,t1_fdgzm5i,1578415353.0,"Look into long term service in Igatpuri India. Alternatively you could go to India and travel from center to center, sitting and serving. 7k euro would be more than enough! Transportation and food are dirt cheap in India, and serving at the courses is free, sitting only requires a donation."
ExpectationVsReality,fd0g2td,t1_fcxoii3,1578118282.0,"For reals, though. Look at the colors, and how much fresher everything is!"
ExpectationVsReality,fcvx1d6,t3_ej29ae,1578012035.0,Yours looks ten times better. Good work.
vipassana,fcs1uar,t3_ei807f,1577910146.0,"I've gone a few times while in the middle of romantic turmoil /attachment, and I've found it's excellent for breaking out of the ""addiction"" aspect of being ""in love"". You'll be in a much better position to look at things objectively after you finish the course."
Epstein,fcndybd,t1_fcmix58,1577809699.0,"Maybe they are? We don't know, do we. Epstein almost got away with it."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fciz3pm,t1_fciyk2y,1577673292.0,"I have to admit, I hate Boulder police, Boulder is full of cops micromanaging every aspect of life... But also this woman is a little crazy. Kind of shows the level of clueless privilege of a lot of white Boulderites that she would just barge in on the cops like this."
steak,fcaz1w4,t1_fca67pe,1577579437.0,"I sure did, overall I was so pleased with my outcome and it was SO easy. This looks even better to me, but sounds a lot more difficult."
steak,fca1lkk,t3_egs310,1577561609.0,"What was your method for making this? How many pounds was the roast? I did mine with a quick blast of 500 degrees f and then residual heat and it was nice, but this looks even better."
peopleofwalmart,fc2n8j8,t1_fc2kzeb,1577367894.0,Insulin resistance. I've read it can make people gain weight on the back and abdomen. It's like pre pre diabetes.
fatlogic,fc06f8k,t1_fbzh7ij,1577280604.0,There has to be more to the story than that? I've been called fat a few times and never had anything close to an eating disorder. Surely there is some underlying trauma /mental health issue?
vipassana,fc068m4,t1_fbroc4s,1577280386.0,"I wouldn't say so. It's amazing and flavorful but not hot. They do have a special offering of spice-less vegetables ""for western meditatiors"", but I wouldn't be caught dead eating that."
fatlogic,fbzfdrt,t1_fbz203f,1577244850.0,"It just depends on how well the people know each other and also how sensitive the recipient is. Some people don't mind a little rough banter, it just varies person to person."
vipassana,fbeab2j,t3_ecqgfj,1576781739.0,"Hey, try India. There are loads of course centers to choose from! The only expense will be the ticket. Frankly I prefer courses there because the food is better and overall the environment seems more fit for meditation."
