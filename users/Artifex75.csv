I'm also pudgy and ugly as hell, so it's not like I have to worry about women flirting with me regardless of the presence of the ring."

I have four collapsed vertebrae in my spine, compressing my spinal cord up to 60% in some places. It hurts like hell, but I keep lifting patients. If asked, I'd say it's a 4 with occasional 6. When I had pleuracy, maybe 8 even though breathing was excruciating."

AskMen,ff5t6aw,t3_erlbbu,1579609304.0,"I was set up on a blind date by a coworker. I show up at the restaurant and she immediately sees that I'm no looker. It's okay, I make up for it, but this mug is never going to be on the the cover of a magazine.

She's not even trying to hide her disappointment. Doesn't listen to anything I say, doesn't offer up any conversation to me, kinda hides behind her menu. The meal is awkward as hell as I try to ask her about her interests and such. Single word answers or shrugs. Of course she lets me pay.

We leave to walk over to the movie theater and she keeps walking faster and faster to stay ahead of me. I get it, she's embarrassed to be seen with me. So, I just slow to a normal walking pace while she sprints on ahead. She gets to the theater a good 30 seconds ahead of me and I can see her look around in confusion. When I get there, I tell her that I don't think it's working out and we should just cut our losses and end it. She says, ""But we haven't seen the movie yet!"" I reply, ""That's okay, I doubt that you would notice if I was there or not anyway. You could go watch it by yourself, even. Have a good evening!""

Felt good to walk away. I may not be great looking, but I'm no fucking doormat."
