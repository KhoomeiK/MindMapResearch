TrueOffMyChest,fehvli8,t3_ep2zdf,1579124746.0,"This resonates hard and brought tears to my eyes, it is truly a special thing you were able to support your grandma in the way you did, I am so sorry you missed seeing her on that last day.
Your grandma sounds like an awesome person, keep sharing her story, talk about her, let the world know who she was so her memory lives on ❤
Sending hugs x"
puppy101,fean0xc,t3_eo5j0v,1578950434.0,"If what you're doing is working for you and your pupper then keep it up!! He sounds like hes got the makings of a super good boy!!
It's really tough to not take others opinions to heart, I struggle with that (currently raising my own first puppy from scratch) and it's really hard, especially when close family show a lack of respect for your way of doing things.
You stick to your guns, you've done research on your chosen method and if it is working keep going! Generally speaking there is no 'right' way to train puppers, every person and dog and person/dog relationship is unique and you gotta do what's right for you and our pupper.
Self doubt is natural and understandable, I struggle with it myself tbh, but in those moments just give your pup and big hug and remind yourself of how awesome he is, dont let the doubters get you down!"

labrador,fe863ms,t3_eo2oj7,1578922934.0,"Mine is currently laid on me, like ON me! My head is in the way of her face! How very rude of me 😂 gotta live the lab cuddles!!! Enjoy x"
puppy101,fe84oyt,t3_eo1y1o,1578922530.0,"How do you know the person? I find it so hard to listen to people tell me how to raise my pup, people should keep their opinions to themselves and live and let live!! Everyone raises their pups differently and you know your pup best, I'm doing very similar things to you and force naps cos otherwise Juno becomes a mental case!! If what you're doing is working for you keep it up!"
puppy101,fdh96sj,t1_fdgr5lv,1578418098.0,"Jeez that's awful, so sorry for your poor pupper, kids can be assholes at times, really hope you've got some kind and gentle little humans who can help him see they're not all like that, give him some pats for being a good boy from me and my Juno"
aww,fdgksrr,t3_el5xl4,1578400660.0,So beautiful 😍😍😍 the makings of a true good girl!
aww,fdez6yi,t3_ekvne6,1578349732.0,She beautiful 😍 love that face!! Give her a good girl pet from me and my 14 week old black lab girl Juno
puppy101,fd18trl,t1_fd18m2i,1578128704.0,"And there was me thinking a harness would be better for her 🙈 ah well, we got to listen to our girl, if she says no to a harness then so be it!"
puppy101,fd14bet,t1_fcyr8z2,1578127424.0,"Thank you so much, hopefully it wont last too long 🙈 but then we only started walking last week so still early days, I just need to be more patient with her I guess, shes such a good girl otherwise! Hope you are getting on well with puppy adolescence, I'm not looking forward to that bit in a few months!"
puppy101,fd13lq5,t1_fcyvuh4,1578127153.0,"Thank you for the reassurance! I was hoping it would be a normal/temporary phase, I guess I am just being impatient because I've looked forward to taking my own dog for walks for years!!
Yeah she is much better with a more confident dog in tow, sadly we dont have frequent access to one but we will persevere with positive reinforcement 😊"
puppy101,fd131xn,t1_fczel0m,1578127049.0,"Thank you yeah we are using a harness, I wonder if it's too heavy for her? We will experiment without one today and see how it goes, weve bought like 4 different harnesses so far and had her a month 😂🙈
to try and get one to fit her properly, typical if she doesnt want one!!"
puppy101,fcpd314,t1_fcpcu5v,1577858901.0,"Thank you so much for your response, tis crazy, I have a dog sitter who normally comes and stays when me and OH are working, never been this anxious, trust her more than my parents! Sadly we are still struggling in the potty training department 🙈 so dont think they can ruin that for us at least 😂 just hope shes been ok with the fireworks, I tried to tell them food is the way to our pups heart (shes a lab!) but they dont believe in clicker training or reward training? I dont get it but hey ho, and they've had dogs before, each to their own I guess!"
puppy101,fcpaz79,t3_eic77f,1577856658.0,"Needed this thank you ❤ my pup has been with grandparents for the night as I'm working, have been so worried they will not follow what I've asked cos 'they know best' and they took her out for a walk at night??  I'm still trying to build her confidence up cos shes a tad anxious about traffic etc let alone fireworks at night! Shes only 3.5 months and the goodest of girls, I worry I'm OTT in my requests but you're right  I know my pup and I am doing what works for her and me, fingers crossed one night with them wont undo my hard work 🙈🤞🐶"
puppy101,fb5dp9a,t3_ebi7pi,1576525721.0,"Oh man I hate people with all their negativity, just remind yourself whatever she is saying, it wont be about you and your pup! 12 weeks is still very very early days, I understand completely I am in and out of puppy blues and feeling like potty training is a bust right now no matter how hard we try, Juno will be 12 weeks on friday ❤ but we gotta remind ourselves we are in this for the long haul, these pups are still teeny babies with a lot to learn, so long as we are supportive and open to learning as much as the puppies then we will be okx you arent alone in this, and for the record, what the MIL has said is BS, you got this 😘 x"
