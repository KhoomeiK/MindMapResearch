to be clear, this has to be a paranormal fear, specifically spirits or demonic activity. real life shit like regular people killing each other is boring af to me; I can get that by turning on the news. torture porn is just plain offensive to good taste, and insulting to real people being tortured every day in the world. kaiju and other monsters usually end up being funny, dull, or really fucking cool, but not scary.      
         
I need my horror completely divorced from reality. I was raised Catholic, and although I no longer hold any of the beliefs, you never truly escape your upbringing. therefore: I don't believe in ghosts and demons, but they frighten me. and they're the only thing that does.
