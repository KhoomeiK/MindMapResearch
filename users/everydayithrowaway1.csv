flu,ff6n3io,t1_ff6dnjp,1579630719.0,Glad you are feeling much better! Hoping in a few more days i even out.
flu,ff6ch2o,t1_ff6by0z,1579624183.0,No meds besides Advil and occasionally using Afrin(nose spray)
flu,ff6ca3y,t3_eo94sz,1579624059.0,Day 8 or 9 here. I'm feeling mostly human again but im still really dizzy and lightheaded and slightly feverish. Also have this crappy taste in my mouth that wont go away and my appetite is still pretty much non existent. Not coughing much anymore but still have a little bit of wheezing. Cant believe how sick this has made me.  I really hope it ends soon.
flu,ff6bbee,t3_epugw6,1579623442.0,"Yes!! Ughhh I'm on day 8 or 9 at this point and the taste in my mouth is still there. That and I'm super lightheaded and dizzy still. Also just still have that feverish feeling. God this has to end soon, right?? Lol"
flu,ff6b1y7,t3_erc08j,1579623275.0,I'm on day 9 today. Im almost better but is anyone else suffering from lightheadedness and dizziness??? These symptoms just wont seem to leave.
BeautyBoxes,fez0n1p,t3_eo7bep,1579452802.0,I got this EXACT variation too! I'm happy with it.
BeautyBoxes,feyz7rv,t1_feoyag4,1579452323.0,I got the palette for signing up in dec. I believe its called tarte be you naturally eye shadow palette.
BeautyBoxes,feyyrtm,t3_eq8p3p,1579452150.0,I feel like a 6 dollar coupon is such a shitty compensation. I got this pallette myself for signing up I'm sorry they failed you on you getting yours. =( if put up a stink and complain that what they are offering isnt even near thr cost of the actual pallette.
offmychest,fevck1v,t1_fequo3w,1579395795.0,Well I think you did just discover his fetish. Its gotta be him searching for the biggest hooha or peen. Lmao jk
offmychest,fevc1vg,t1_fesfi6z,1579395623.0,"I mean, cant blame him if he did"
offmychest,fephswq,t1_fephp97,1579320852.0,Exxxactly
offmychest,feox9rb,t3_eq84d7,1579307384.0,Maybe he plowed all the ice cream then felt guilty and was like fuck this imma get in shape nowwww hahahaha
Methadone,feox0hr,t1_fen36og,1579307225.0,Lol
Methadone,fen2yo9,t1_fen2b2l,1579275812.0,Noooo not you!! Haha that was to OP who replied to you! Sorry i probably should have specified. I was saying your comment was great advice.
Methadone,femkk40,t1_fem6scf,1579260210.0,"So now that hes gone has the living situation changed for the better? Was his mom living there or was she just there for the drama, she sounds batshit too to get involved like that and run up in your room. Like wtf? Sounds like the kind of household you see on the show Cops lmao"
Methadone,femkfk8,t1_fel74ar,1579260043.0,This is good advice. For some reason youre just acting very defensive.
greysanatomy,felya9f,t1_fek0onm,1579234022.0,Lmao when i scrolled by and saw this I thought it was supposed to be like a flash forward into the future
Methadone,felt3m0,t1_felspkt,1579230261.0,"Ive been there and it sucks in the beginning for sure. Im at 2 weeks now and it really doesnt interupt my life at all. Keep on keeping on, plus you'll feel good knowing you earned it."
Methadone,fels9b0,t3_epkde6,1579229669.0,"Could you dose, go back home and right back to sleep? Or once youre up are you up for the day (I usually cant go back to bed easily once I'm up) 

Might just be a situation you need to power through until you gain more takehomes. It happens faster than it feels like it will!"
Methadone,felm276,t3_epp883,1579225415.0,That sounds like a horrible living environment and you're obviously being pulled right into the madness. None of that shit is normal behavior with roommates. Sometimes you need to step away to realize how fucked a situation is.
Methadone,feled1k,t3_ep6e1w,1579220194.0,Cute bois.
Methadone,felebpo,t3_epc7by,1579220169.0,"Awww what a cutie! Looks alot like my girl Bella. Thats pretty wild that they just gave him to you just like that, guess it was meant to be! I also had my dog given to me. My neighbor is elderly and I would take her for walks to help him out (and to help me distract myself from feeling shitty as I had just began methadone back then and was adjusting to being off dope) One day he asked me if I could take her since he wasnt able to care for her like he used to, and the rest is history. Had her for 3 years now and havent picked up a needle or dope since the first week I started methadone!"
Methadone,fed4igj,t1_fecss4q,1578998446.0,Right??? 500 barely covered a week when I was actively using lol
Methadone,febzjl7,t3_eo38un,1578964595.0,"I would really advise not getting hooked on kratom. Not a good idea at all bro. If you dont feel ready to be completely sober off all opiates you need to stay on methadone FOR AS LONG AS YOU NEED. Fuck everyone else who is trying to control YOUR recovery. They have no fucking clue as this is your problem not theirs.

I always found it funny when family or friends try to push someone who is finally stable and doing good in life off of methadone. If it's working for you, youre not using on top of it and you're taking the treatment seriously why should you taper off fast and subjrct yourself to a possible relapse? I'm assuming youre an adult and if so you need to step up and have your own back. Dont let others make your decisions for you especially when this shit can mean life or death for many of us."
Methadone,fe023ab,t1_fdxslpp,1578801151.0,The people who usually complain are the ones there dosing daily too haha I only go once every two weeks so is it really us holding up the line or the people who never earn takehomes and show up day after day!
BeautyBoxes,fdlp27y,t1_fdlox4l,1578529100.0,Me too. I use it before my moisturizer and it started being part of my daily routine. Its great that you only need a couple drops. But I dont want to spend 80 bucks on a new bottle lol so I'll just use up whats remaining then move on haha
BeautyBoxes,fdllb53,t3_eli1ra,1578526595.0,"So i love the elemis face oil, I got that in my December box too but today as I was doing my makeup the bottle tipped and i thought it was closed. Well it wasnt and 90 percent of the oil spilled out of the bottle. I'm so upset haha"
Methadone,fdjrtga,t3_eldlgx,1578485136.0,Ya for me the sweating stopped after I actually increased. May also be due to being on it longer too though ans my body growing more accustomed to it.
Methadone,fdiu2ka,t1_fdh0rvx,1578451050.0,Says the alcoholic.
Methadone,fdbwow0,t3_ekh5v3,1578263038.0,"Keep going up til your comfortable, you gotta remember your body is also withdrawing from the fent as its insanely strong. Just keep upping your dose you WILL get there. I'm at 135 mg a day and it took me 'til that dose to be comfortable for a whole 24 hours. 

Hopefully you arent using at all on top of your dose as that will only set you back and make it impossible to stabilize. Not saying your using just throwing that out there in case."
insaneparents,fctyuug,t1_fctu51x,1577966304.0,"When i was about 15 my step mother took my two elderly cats that i had since early childhood and drove them far away. She dumped them in a field somewhere in the middle of winter, so i will never know what happened to them.

The worst part was I didnt find out the truth til many years down the line when my dad admitted it to me. We were told the cats ran away which never sat right with me but I had no way of knowing. My mother would have gladly taken my cats in if she knew what their fate was gonna be. Thats just a tiny example of what she did to make my childhood miserable. It went on and on with her, another example was destroying ALL of my artwork becaue she didnt like the content of it. Ill never understand how or why people can be so cruel to their supposed ""family""."
