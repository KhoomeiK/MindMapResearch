movies,fcxalxj,t3_ej52u6,1578057491.0,"Hey Sam, is this remake or a sequel to The Grudge?

It remade Isn’t there like a shelf life on these remakes?
 The original Ju-On was made in 2002. The American version was made in 2004 staring Sara Michelle Gellar  and it’s sequel in 2006.

From a creator stand point I was wondering, are there just no more original ideas left in Hollywood?

It seems all this generation of kids is getting is poor remakes ( and not saying yours is because I haven’t seen it) of movies from my generation and my brothers.

It’s sad to see this generations not getting their own classic/cult flicks like we did I.e. The Goonies, Lost Boys, Back to the Future, The Breakfast Club.....etc. it’s seems like they only get three choices


Choice 1: Comic book movie

Choice 2: another Fast and the Furious

Choice 3: Remade horror from the 90’s early 2000’s

My friends and I have been talking about this a lot lately. It’s almost like there’s a block in future film making because it’s seems like directors and producer have decided nothing is going to get better than the movies made from 1980-2007. 

Also thank you for the Early Spider-Man movies except for the third one and Tobey Maguire. 

Spider-Man 2 with Doc OC was your best one."
