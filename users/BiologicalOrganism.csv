No doubt."
nihilism,ffech0f,t1_ffecasa,1579843053.0,"Our feelings don’t matter. Nothing does.

That’s not even “nihilism”, that’s a fact. You’re saying nihilism isn’t that, I’m saying is that nihilism is based of off that, but no words can ever describe what existence is, since words are nothing more than a means of communication.

Our universe will keep going long after humanity is gone.

You people are wasting your time on this topic of meaning. 

It’s a huge placebo.

nihilism,ffec86q,t1_ffebzhf,1579842827.0,"You do realize that we aren’t in some fantasy world, this isn’t some heaven or hell.

It’s a mechanical three dimensional existence, the fact that you even have feelings of anything came from that state. 

You cannot tell me that you think everything actually has a purpose or meaning, because that isn’t what existence operates on.

And it never will.

We can give “meaning”, but then again we aren’t giving anything but what our brains do crave: dopamine."
nihilism,ffebpv1,t1_ffebdej,1579842360.0,"What I’m saying is that those who get crippling depression are the ones that don’t know that it’s just chemicals.

They instead don’t acknowledge that and fall into such an ironic state of being.

It’s like a star being sad that it has constant solar flares. 

That’s what I mean by “overcoming”, it’s just a chance of educating someone or the realization of it all.

After that they can feel what ever they what."
nihilism,ffeanmr,t1_ffe9vya,1579841410.0,"Depression is an anecdotal result of chemical reactions in ones head. 

You’re saying like depression is a force that guides one to doom, it could be overcome since it’s just another emotion, so much as happiness.

My suggestion is not not take oneself so serious, you’re doing it too much. 

This isn’t some reality t.v show drama."
nihilism,ffea9gl,t1_ffdqdre,1579841068.0,"Given by whom or what? What makes you above everyone and saying they have to live the way you think?

nihilism,ffe9sqj,t1_ffdwsfh,1579840665.0,"That’s the thing, crippled by feelings?

I’m more angry upon the fact that one is taking a story of non-fiction to heart. Which is you of all people.

I can both laugh and be appalled. My vibe was never killed, but others will be.

I’m more surprised than anything else.

The MA is forced to give HE the bail money, while he promptly pockets it as “offerings for GOD.”

This joke had nothing to do with rape or slavery. This has to do with Do-S getting her ass whooped by the inevitable bald hero himself.

I found it funny, then you went ham later.

Good job on you."
OnePunchMan,ff3oamd,t1_ff3ntmg,1579545324.0,"I was just scrolling this subreddit, came across a picture of Saitama turning down a sex bribe and laughed.

Then decided to read if anyone had the same feeling, then the comments got serious all a sudden. 

You in particular really killed the mood over a joke, you then proceed to stand here saying no one was offended like cows don’t exist for slaughter (not a vegan nor starting another “war” btw).

Good grief."

Even if it’s not funny, this is just a story, no need to get so technical and sensitive.

But seeing your earlier responses, I was under the impression that you had a belief that morality isn’t a subjective thing, rather, a universal constant via the justice system.

But totally agree on abiding by certain laws to live peacefully in whatever place you live at. That should be common sense by now."
nihilism,fe6kme5,t1_fe6kfot,1578894016.0,"That was a long, drawn out response, but I get ya.

Your moral compass is defined in terms of _amorality_; the way you perceive justice will always be different or slightly different from others.
