There are families that were broken because our government decided to start a war with the UK and many untrained, unequipped and young soldiers were massacred. I know that war is starting to become a joke for some, but this wasn't in the slightest. So, just don't go to a foreign country and mock on their fallen. That's it. This motherfuckers were looking for a reaction by displaying those plates. They had it coming."
