It's technically possible to win 162 game, but considering no one has won more than 116 I would consider rewriting that sentence. 
While Jack Wilson was the first Pirates SS to get 200+ hits since Honus Wagner in 1908, we've actually had several excellent short stops since then*, so I don't think it's accurate to call 2004 the best Pirates SS season in a century.
