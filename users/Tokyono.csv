> This painting appeared on the magazine's cover on August 12, 1944, in the midst of World War II.  Allied Forces had landed on the beaches of France on D-Day, June 6, two months prior to the magazine's publication date, and there was reason to believe that the war would not go on much longer.   

>In the meantime, soldiers were continuing to be drafted and wartime romances were intensified by the threat of separation.  The scene in Soldier on Leave was a common story:  young lovers take what comfort they can from each other in spite of their lack of privacy, knowing their time together is brief.   

>Rockwell frequently used Vermont neighbors as models for his paintings.  This painting is no exception, and to complete the realistic setting, he posed his models in an actual train that was loaned to him by the Rutland Railroad.

D’Arline,

I adore you, sweetheart. 

I know how much you like to hear that — but I don't only write it because you like it — I write it because it makes me warm all over inside to write it to you. 

It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you — almost two years but I know you'll excuse me because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic; and I thought there was no sense to writing. 

But now I know my darling wife that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing, and that I have done so much in the past. I want to tell you I love you. I want to love you. I always will love you.

I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead — but I still want to comfort and take care of you — and I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you — I want to do little projects with you. I never thought until just now that we can do that. What should we do. We started to learn to make clothes together — or learn Chinese — or getting a movie projector. Can't I do something now? No. I am alone without you and you were the ""idea-woman"" and general instigator of all our wild adventures.

When you were sick you worried because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn’t have worried. Just as I told you then there was no real need because I loved you in so many ways so much. And now it is clearly even more true — you can give me nothing now yet I love you so that you stand in my way of loving anyone else — but I want you to stand there. You, dead, are so much better than anyone else alive.

I know you will assure me that I am foolish and that you want me to have full happiness and don't want to be in my way. I'll bet you are surprised that I don't even have a girlfriend (except you, sweetheart) after two years. But you can't help it, darling, nor can I — I don't understand it, for I have met many girls and very nice ones and I don't want to remain alone — but in two or three meetings they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real.

My darling wife, I do adore you. 

I love my wife. My wife is dead.

Rich.

edit:

>At the beginning of the Meiji period the Japanese government, wanting to protect its image and make a good impression on the West and to avoid ridicule, outlawed tattoos, and irezumi took on connotations of criminality. Nevertheless, fascinated foreigners went to Japan seeking the skills of tattoo artists, and traditional tattooing continued underground. Tattooing was legalized by the occupation forces in 1948,[3] but has retained its image of criminality. For many years, traditional Japanese tattoos were associated with the yakuza, Japan's notorious mafia, and many businesses in Japan (such as public baths, fitness centers and hot springs) still ban customers with tattoos.[4] 

>Although tattoos have gained popularity among the youth of Japan due to Western influence, there is still a stigma on them among the general consensus. Unlike the US, even finding a tattoo shop in Japan may prove difficult, with tattoo shops primarily placed in areas that are very tourist or US military friendly. According to Kunihiro Shimada, the president of the Japan Tattoo Institute, ""Today, thanks to years of government suppression, there are perhaps 300 tattoo artists in Japan.""[5] 

>There are even current political repercussions for tattoos in Japan. In 2012, the then mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto, started a campaign to rid companies of their employees with tattoos. According to an article written about Hashimoto ""He is on a mission to force workers in his government to admit to any tattoos in obvious places. If they have them, they should remove them—or find work elsewhere."""

>Under Benedict, who Pollard and other writers view as a shrewd politician and churchman, but a hapless financial manager, the Vatican’s income declined precipitously. Doubtless, the war years (Italy declared war in May 1915) contributed to this, given the virtual absence of large numbers of faithful able to attend papal audiences and the inability of bishops to make their ad limina visits and so carry the funds from Peter’s Pence from their home diocese to the pope. A series of losses as a result of collapsed banks or poor stock investments, suggests Pollard, meant that “Benedict did not leave the Vatican with a cash reserve at the end of his reign” (125). Increasingly, the ensuing decades found the popes turning to the American Church for assistance in meeting its shortfalls, especially the sees in Boston, New York, and Chicago. America was no longer the backwater that it was once considered in Roman circles. It soon became the cavalry for near monthly setbacks, brought on by repeated deficits run by Vatican Radio and L’Osservatore Romano. Profits from the sale of Vatican stamps could hardly be expected to offset these cost overruns.

He was such a humble guy, especially when it came to his appearance. 

>Pope Benedict XV was a slight man. He wore the smallest of three cassocks that were prepared for the election of a new pope in 1914, and became known as ""Il Piccoletto"" or ""The Little Man"". The cassock he wore upon his election had to be quickly stitched up so it could properly fit him. The new pope jokingly said to the tailors: ""My dear, had you forgotten me?"" He was dignified in bearing and courtly in terms of manners, but his appearance was not that of a pope. He had a sallow complexion, a mat of black hair, and prominent teeth. Everything about him seemed crooked, from his nose to his eyes and shoulders.[79] He himself had referred to his appearance as an ""ugly gargoyle upon the buildings of Rome"". It was even said that his father looked upon his newborn son with incredulity and turned away in dismay at the sight of the infant della Chiesa, due to the small, bluish pallor and frail appearance of the infant.[54] 

>He was renowned for his generosity, answering all pleas for help from poor Roman families with large cash gifts from his private revenues. When he was short on money, those who would be admitted to an audience would often be instructed by prelates not to mention their financial woes, as Benedict would inevitably feel guilty that he could not help the needy at the time. He also depleted the Vatican's official revenues with large-scale charitable expenditure during World War I. Upon his death, the Vatican Treasury had been depleted to the equivalent in Italian lire of U.S. $19,000."

To save themselves proves impossible, and the officer in charge asks Marbot to bring their imperial eagle back to the emperor. Half-stunned by the aforesaid cannonball, Marbot and Lisette are surrounded by Russians, one of whom plunges a bayonet into her thigh. “Her ferocity restored by the pain, she sprang at the Russian and at one mouthful tore off his nose and all the skin of his face, making of him a living deaths head, dripping with blood.”

NormanRockwellArt,fe1hjf6,t3_enm6e5,1578826593.0,">Between 1917 and 1969, Rockwell created 21 story illustrations for McCall’s, which billed itself as the ‘First Magazine for Women.’ With a circulation of more than eight million issues a month, its reach was even larger than that of The Saturday Evening Post. Appearing on the cover of the Christmas issue of McCall’s in 1964, Little Girl Looking Downstairs at Christmas Party is the only cover illustration Norman Rockwell created for the publication and demonstrates the artist’s continued interest in family life (Fig. 1). As Virginia Mecklenberg observes, “We take on the persona as well as the viewpoint of a child; Rockwell emotionally transports us to a moment of childhood that erases subsequent experience” (as quoted in Telling Stories: Norman Rockwell from the Collections of George Lucas and Steve Spielberg, New York, 2010, p. 183).

>The impressive sense of naturalism that Rockwell achieves in Girl Looking Downstairs at Christmas Party is a result of his complex technical process, which he developed and refined throughout the early decades of his career. The introduction of the miniature 35-mm camera in the mid-1930s revolutionized the job of illustrators by allowing them to paint from photographs instead of live models. Rockwell initially resisted this change but with the encouragement of a younger generation of artists that included Steven Dohanos and John Falter, he began to integrate photography into his creative process by 1937. With a clear vision of the intended picture, Rockwell would pose the models and demonstrate the expressions he wanted them to hold.  For Little Girl Looking Downstairs at Christmas Party, Rockwell posed the young model at the top of the stairs in his own home and assembled a group of friends and neighbors downstairs (Fig. 2). Once he was satisfied with the photos, Rockwell would return to his studio and combine his preliminary sketches with the photos to create a series of small-scale color studies. These preliminary sketches allowed Rockwell to experiment with color and provide a glimpse into the artist’s creative process. After executing several color studies for Little Girl Looking Downstairs at Christmas Party, one of which is presented as Lot 9, Rockwell ultimately decided to add additional details to the present work and final painting, including the young girl’s doll and wreath on the banister.

AM POSTING IT HERE IN CASE PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN READING IT!!

>Veterinarians and caregivers at UC Davis bid farewell Monday to the faceless wonder dog who drew international attention after she leaped on a speeding motorcycle and saved two girls from being run over in the Philippines.

>The muzzle-less mongrel named Kabang chewed treats, tossed around a squeaky toy and wagged her tail furiously after she was given a clean bill of health by specialists at the William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at UC Davis.
The black and tan shepherd-type dog, whose face now looks more like that of a pug, seemed amazingly jolly after her eight-month ordeal, which included extensive treatment for cancer and heartworm, spaying, vaccinations and the insertion of an identity chip in her shoulder, in addition to surgery to close the grisly wound on her face.

>Kabang was released to her Filipino veterinarian, Anton Lim, who will escort her back to the Philippines on Thursday.

>""She is still not a pretty dog, but she is a happy dog,"" said Frank Verstraete, the chief of dentistry and oral surgery at the hospital, explaining their surgical handiwork, which did not include cosmetic reconstruction of the dog's missing upper jaw. ""We opted for function and comfort as our primary goal.""

>Kabang became an international sensation in December 2011 when she reportedly threw herself onto a motorcycle and stopped it from hitting her master's daughter and niece in Zamboanga City. But the motorcycle's spokes sheared off much of the plucky pooch's face.

>Word quickly spread throughout the Philippines about the heroics of the skinny mixed-breed known as an aspin, a kind of street dog often scorned in the Philippines, where purebreds are preferred.

>Fundraising campaign

>News of the ""hero dog"" soon spread around the world, and a grassroots fundraising campaign to get her the wound-closing surgery started after photographs of her gruesome injury began to circulate.

>Kabang was brought to the veterinary hospital in October 2012 after donations from 20 countries poured in, enough to pay for airfare and treatment.

>Facebook and Twitter accounts, the website careforkabang.com and pet lovers' blogs were an integral part of the effort, and the money keeps flowing in. To date, more than $20,000 has been raised.

>There has been plenty of criticism. Complaints to the hospital and on the Internet objected to the spending of so much money on a single dog when the public could be fighting war, hunger, terrorism and global warming.

>Even some of the veterinarians at the hospital were conflicted when they saw the gaping, exposed tissue and nasal cavities, which extended ""almost to the point of entering into the brain,"" said Dr. Boaz Arzi, the surgeon.

>""Some of my colleagues said, 'This is beyond repair,' "" and that euthanasia would be the most humane approach, Verstraete said.
How she survived in the first place ""is something we asked ourselves. 

>The amount of blood loss this dog must have sustained was tremendous, but somehow she did survive.""
Arzi said the decision to operate was made by the owner, Rudy Bunggal, who representatives say not only loves Kabang, but believes she was God-sent.
The 57-year-old native Visayan found her as a puppy in a swamp near Zamboanga. The dog and Bunggal's daughter, Dina, 11, and niece, Princess, 3, were soon inseparable.
Sacrificed herself
The consensus is that Kabang, which means ""spotted"" in the Visayan language, loved the girls so much that she sacrificed herself to save them.
""The decision on where to spend the money is ultimately the owner's,"" Arzi said. ""Ethically and morally, we have to do what we can and be the best that we can be.""
As it turned out, Kabang's ghastly wound wasn't her only life-threatening problem. Veterinarians discovered she had heartworm, a parasitic roundworm spread by mosquitoes that can cause congestive heart failure.
A golf ball-size tumor was also found on her vulva, which was diagnosed as an aggressive cancer called progressive venereal tumor. Both ailments are common in tropical and subtropical regions where dogs run loose, veterinarians say.
The four-legged heroine was given six weekly intravenous chemotherapy infusions, antibiotics and three powerful arsenic-based heartworm shots.

>Finally, in two surgeries in March, Verstraete and Arzi removed the dog's upper teeth, reconstructed one eyelid, used three skin flaps to close the wound and reconstructed Kabang's nasal openings.
""Essentially, we advanced the lip to close the entire oral cavity,"" Arzi said. ""This was unique in that we did not have an upper jaw at all.""

>The tail-wagging wonder romped around the lawn outside the hospital, subduing a yellow stuffed squeaky dog, scooping up water with her lower jaw, chewing food with her only remaining molars and generally showing off to the assembled newshounds.
""I'm going to miss her,"" said Dawn Gillette, who runs the para-veterinary service facility where Kabang has been staying since she has been in the United States. ""She is a special girl, a real character.""

>The sure-to-be emotional reunion with her master is expected Sunday, after a stopover in Manila, said Lim.
""I don't think it's an accident that she is alive,"" said Lim, who thanked the hospital and others responsible for saving Kabang on behalf of the Bunggal family.

>However, in the flight's second hour, the passenger further complained of chest pain.[7] It emerged that she had not merely fallen from a bicycle but had been flung to the ground while riding on a motorcycle which collided with a car; Wallace suspected she had previously concealed the extent of her injuries so as to avoid being taken off the flight.[8] 

>Upon further examination, Wallace and Wong discovered that in addition to arm and rib fractures, the passenger had developed pneumothorax due to a puncture in her left lung, and realised that she might die if the pressure in her pleural cavity went unrelieved.[9] Wallace did not deem a landing at the nearest airport in Delhi to be viable either, because the increase in air pressure during descent could also kill his patient, and thus the only option was to perform an immediate surgery.[7] With the limited medical equipment on board, Wallace and Wong had to improvise heavily. The medical kit had lidocaine – a local anaesthetic – but the catheter in the kit was designed only for urinary catheterisation and was too soft for use as a chest tube. The doctors fashioned a trocar from a metal clothes hanger to stiffen the catheter, and a check valve from a bottle of water with holes poked in the cap.[9] They sterilised their equipment in Courvoisier cognac, and began surgery by making an incision in the patient's chest, but with no surgical clamps available, Wong had to hold the incision open with a knife and fork while Wallace inserted the catheter.[7] The whole surgery lasted about ten minutes; the doctors successfully released the trapped air from the patient's chest, and she passed the rest of the flight uneventfully, eating and watching in-flight movies.[9] 

>In the aftermath, Wallace and Wong published a brief article in the British Medical Journal about the incident.[10] Wallace also testified before a Parliamentary committee investigating British airlines' alleged lack of investment in on-board medical equipment.[11] He was even more critical of US airlines in this regard, noting that his efforts would have been impossible with typical US airline medical kits not even containing aspirin, and stated that ""There needs to be a major change in attitudes in the U.S., both from the government and from the airlines."""

todayilearned,fdkdif1,t3_elv2dr,1578501573.0,"Just an FYI- ABC had cut S4 of the show into two 90 minute specials. They aired the first one and the Pythons hated it, so they sued to prevent the second one airing- claiming it could damage their reputation with the American audience.

The judge ruled in ABC's favour due to copyright issues and that not airing the second episode could damage ABC's reputation. 

The Pythons took it to a higher court, but *after* the second episode had aired, and got a more favourable outcome:

>Judge Morris Lasker favored ABC in his decision partly because of the network's claims of damages that could be incurred, and partly because of questions about copyright. [The Pythons held copyright over the scripts, but the BBC owned the copyright of the performances of those same scripts.] But by the time the case reached the U.S. Court of Appeals, ABC's second compilation had already aired, on 26 December 1975, thus making moot its claims of potential damages. The appellate judges were then concentrating on matters of copyright, and whether ABC's showing of ""Monty Python"" was a mislabeling of inferior goods, illegal under the Lanham Act. 

>Python and ABC (in conjunction with the BBC and Time-Life, the show's distributor) ultimately reached a settlement, which awarded the Pythons full rights to all 45 TV episodes. The fourth series was eventually sold to PBS in the States, ""naughty bits"" intact.

The young man and his father sit on the running board of the family's stakesided farm truck. The ticket protruding from the son's pocket, and the single rail visible at the lower corner of the painting, by which the trio sit, suggest that they are at a whistle stop waiting for the train.

>The son's books are stacked on a new suitcase bearing a ""State U"" pennant. With his tie and socks perfectly matched, wearing pressed white trousers and matching jacket, he is ready for his new life in college. The young man's shoes are shined to a polished gleam, as, hands folded, and with the family dog resting his head in his lap, his gaze focuses eagerly toward the horizon, and on the next chapter in his life.

>In contrast, the father sits slumped with both his and his son's hats clutched in his hand, as if reluctant to let him go. The direction of his gaze is opposite to his son's. The tag from a Bull Durham tobacco satchel dangles, near at hand, from his shirt pocket. There is a red flag and a lantern at the ready, near his right hand, atop a well-used trunk. With the son's luggage unloaded and waiting next to them, there is nothing left for him to do but signal the train to stop, and his pose suggests that he is looking up the track, dreading the imminent arrival of the train that will carry his son away.

>Though the two figures are not looking at each other, their legs are touching and emphasize the very strong sense of family ties in this iconic 1954 painting.

todayilearned,fde9ubc,t3_ekxqiy,1578334351.0,"FYI the guys name was Victor Lustig, he was an experienced con man. He ""sold"" the Eiffel tower for scrap metal twice, and conned people into buying a box that could ""duplicate"" money. 

He's more known for his Eiffel tower scam, but I think his Al Capone scam is way more hilarious.

edit: he also ran a large counterfeit money operation. Then his mistress sold him out. Then he died.  

>In 1930, Lustig went into a partnership with two men from Nebraska—pharmacist William Watts, and chemist Tom Shaw—to conduct a large scale counterfeiting operation. Both Watts and Shaw engraved the plates that would be used to manufacture the counterfeit dollar bills, while Lustig organised a ring of couriers to distribute the forgeries, ensuring that they were kept in the dark regarding the production of the counterfeits.[8] In short, the operation managed to circulate thousands of dollars of counterfeit money each month for the next five years, nicknamed ""Lustig money"", though the increasing amount entering the US economy eventually drew the attention of federal agents. 

>When Lustig's mistress, Billy May, learnt he was betraying her for Shaw's young mistress, she decided to get revenge and gave an anonymous phone call to the federal authorities.[8] On 10 May 1935, Lustig was arrested in New York and charged with counterfeiting. Although he openly admitted to his partners' involvement in the operation, he himself feigned ignorance in the matter. However, his refusal to disclose information on a key found in his possession proved to be his undoing, when it was later found to open a locker in the Times Square subway station containing $51,000 in counterfeit bills and the plates with which they had been printed.[7] 

>The day before his trial, Lustig managed to escape from the Federal House of Detention in New York City by faking illness and using a specially made rope to climb out of the building, but was recaptured 27 days later in Pittsburgh. Lustig pleaded guilty at his trial and was sentenced to 15 years in Alcatraz Island, California for his original charge, with a further five years for his prison escape. On 9 March 1947, Lustig contracted pneumonia, and was pronounced dead two days later at the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri. On his death certificate his occupation was listed as apprentice salesman."

I've never heard of this! and researching serial killers is a hobby of mine. Thank you!

It's amazing how blind the police are to serial killers that target gay men. (Hint:homophobia)

This also happened in Canada with Bruce McArthur. The gay community told police there was a serial killer targeting them, but were ignored for years. 

Also Colin Ireland- a British serial killer who targeted gay men simply because he knew police wouldn't notice as they were ""easy targets"". edit: he was a straight guy who targeted gay men for monetary gain. He went to gay clubs and found men into BDSM (specifically the one who ""liked to be tied up""), then went to their house and bound them up, before stealing from them and killing them. He did some quite sickening stuff. If you're faint of heart don't look him up."

>While officers continued to display Barney Fife-esque credulity, Gabriel’s friend John Pape did their job for them, establishing links between the deaths of Anthony, Gabriel and Daniel. When he presented the evidence of a serial killer on the loose, police sent him away. Pape turned to Pink News and LGBT group Galop, asking them to use their relationship with the force to raise the alarm. The newspaper and campaigners were similarly disregarded. No public warnings were issued to the LGBT community in Barking.

With no evidence of oars to get him and his boat back to shore, Hildebrandt's figure humorously fills the entire space within the vessel. His bucket of worms rests beside him, while the rain thoroughly coats his bright yellow raincoat, his blue hat, adorned with a range of fishing lures, and his pipe, which hangs upside down. This is one of a handful of Post cover paintings for which Rockwell painted in the publication's masthead, and the first cover where the artist deviated from his usual signature and signed his name in cursive. In Sport, Rockwell has captured the unquestionable loyalty of a man, indifferent to his surroundings, fully committed to the task at hand.

Has some info on the picture and includes some of the modelling shots he used. 

>Going and Coming, published in August of 1947, is a good example of a story painting that is both seasonal and topical. The added ingredient of humor makes it even more engaging and thus contributes to its success. The use of two images within one picture allows Rockwell to be more detailed and create a continuum of time. We see the before and the after of the imagined event, a family 's summer outing by the lake. Clues abound for the reader's enjoyment in unraveling the story line.

>The use of a split canvas to portray a juxtaposition of an event, time, age, or place is an effective device that invites comparison of the two scenes. This technique is employed by Rockwell in only two other Post covers, but was commonly used by other Post cover illustrators. In most cases it derives from a comic strip's use of a series of ""frames"" to tell a story. In this case, however, artist Don Spaulding, who studied with Rockwell in 1950 and spent several months living in the schoolhouse on the West Arlington Green, cites George W. Wright's painting of Going to and Returning from the Seashore as the inspiration for Going and Coming."
