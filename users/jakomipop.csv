unpopularopinion,fc7mr8z,t1_fc7mfie,1577512580.0,You chose it unless babies fly in on storks. Stfu
unpopularopinion,fc7mash,t1_fc7m49m,1577512113.0,"No? I don't think women can abandon their child either without having to pay the other parent child support.

Or is this the ole ""I think not supporting a living breathing growing child, soon-to-be adult,  is equal to abortion"" argument."
unpopularopinion,fc7m6z3,t1_fc7m2vq,1577512006.0,"No it's just stupid you're bitching about having to foot money for what is ultimately an active choice and then comparing it to something completely unrelated. 

Sounds like you just want people to validate how pissed you are over your personal arrangements."
unpopularopinion,fc7lsyf,t1_fc7l25h,1577511618.0,Because only the men are complaining about not being able to completely ditch a child whenever they want
unpopularopinion,fc7lq09,t3_eglixx,1577511535.0,Imagine thinking having to support a child you created is a radical injustice.
unpopularopinion,fc7lat2,t3_eglvc6,1577511123.0,"It's weird how so many guys on Reddit think their personal experience alone is enough to treat things as fact. How do YOU,  a man, know 100% what is expected of women. You have not gone through pubescent social hazing in a woman's shoes. The grass is not always greener, and assuming based off your experience alone is lame.

On top of this, please ask yourself why this opinion matters. Why does it matter who has it ""worse"", which is almost impossible to prove. If you're upset with expectations for men, how does putting effort in JUST pointing out it's worse than women help anything? Why couldn't this post be ""men have more issues with physical expectations than people give credit for"" why does it have to be ""it's WORSE than women's problems"". The only mental motive I can think of is that you want male problems prioritized, which is also useless cause you don't have to prioritize social issues. Victim Olympics is USELESS, dude. 

Food for thought; maybe the discussion for male issues would actually go somewhere if it wasn't completely centered around scorn for women."
unpopularopinion,fc7knet,t3_egmlpn,1577510496.0,"No one wants you to cry over movies. People want  you to be more compassionate and empathetic, which is all to do with how you treat others around you. How well are you able to put yourself in someone else's shoes and be kind to others around you. 

It's also about mental health. Men aren't as likely to open up about mental health. I know plenty of guys who feel as though they'd be berated if they expressed issues they have regarding mental health. On top of that, guys have higher suicide rates.

I think you're looking at the narrative the wrong way. It's sad guys interpret the message as some stereotypical caricature of ""female emotions"". Social intelligence is not a bad thing."
offmychest,fc4ait2,t1_fc3ut4m,1577411094.0,Uncommon is not applaudable.
offmychest,fc4aacw,t1_fc42wjc,1577410907.0,"Yes! And I know people who think it's a smart thing. Creating them, sure. But not just consuming them."
offmychest,fc4a1v9,t1_fc42w3x,1577410720.0,"Yes me too, my brother legitimately believes women can't be in science because ""emotional"" brains, when I myself am in science. It's scary because you wonder who you work with or under that might have that belief."
offmychest,fc49wjt,t1_fc3v0xb,1577410601.0,Yess! I'm in molecular biology.
offmychest,fc49rvp,t1_fc3pun0,1577410497.0,Yeah it definitely goes both ways. I also have a bone to pick with the fraction of ladies that like infantilizing themselves. It's weird and I know many who do it and I think it's from laziness or entitlement
offmychest,fc49jfv,t1_fc3hhwa,1577410311.0,I always suspected that. Like I never wanted to believe it was malicious because it makes a lot of sense if you think about how girls are stereotyped in a lot of movies and TV growing up.
offmychest,fc2zn2v,t1_fc2u793,1577378109.0,The brother is younger and she is a legal adult.
offmychest,fc2zdqe,t3_efxa8c,1577377942.0,"People like to ignore the connection between men and violence/lack of humanity. No one wants to address it but it's as old as society itself.

You have to find the fraction that managed to evolve fully from chimps and cling to them."
vegan,fc2s1o0,t1_fc2r2d9,1577372364.0,"Okay how does your point contribute to anything he said. Your comment was useless and you were clearly trying to argue in an argument that wasn't there. ""Well non vegans do that because of X"" ""UM WELL they SHOULD know!!"" Wow! Good thing other participating vegans already agree with that sentiment which is useless unless you're telling this to a non vegan. But no, you need to correct someone (vegan) for the same reason every other person here seems to be uptight assholes. You just wanted an axe to sharpen, clearly. 

Again, there was 0 reason for your point to be added you were clearly just mad someone played devil's advocate."
vegan,fc2qfby,t1_fc2psd8,1577370959.0,"That's fine but he's just saying why people can consume meat without them seeing themselves as killers. Your point doesnt change the conversation. How would your point even add to the convo? ""WELL ACKSHUALLY, THEY DO CONTRIBUTE"" okay? And even if they do technically contribute they still don't see themselves as the killers cause they're not killing. That was his point. 

It's like everyone on here wants to fucking argue with eachother over tiny semantics. For what? Even OP replied ""I don't see your stance"" when there wasn't even supposed to be one. Holy shit not everything is an argument."
vegan,fc2pl6x,t1_fc2pbcw,1577370200.0,Very obviously he meant literally killing. Very obviously his point was that most people that consume animal product do not slaughter/harvest themselves and have that disconnect.
SubredditDrama,fc1z0uo,t1_fc1hyeu,1577334215.0,People only care about the hypocrisy and not the actual action. Hypocrisy in itself
trashy,fc1qnlx,t3_efg0xk,1577326646.0,Dudes on this site love pretending this is even somewhat comparable to how severely women are commodities to men
