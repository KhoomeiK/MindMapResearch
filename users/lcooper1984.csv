Every post on here seems to be a validation post at this point.  You are obviously NTA and have every right to cut ties with any person you don't want a relationship with but these circumstances are clear.

I can give you other pointers like making a simple cashew cream (so rich and amazing) to eliminate dairy here and there.  Other great veg recipes are risotto, pizza, roasted veggies, tofu scrambles, veggie burritos, anything with lentils (protein packed).

Also, you are spot on with lightening your footprint avoiding meat.  It's really important to just try to cut back, even if full vegetarianism isn't an option."

1.5 tsp turmeric

1-2 tsp coconut oil or ghee

Salt if you fancy

Combine all ingredients in a pot, warm up but don't allow to boil (too high of heat destroys the anti-inflammatory properties in the turmeric).  I like to use immersion blender to get froth.  You can make extra and fridge it for a few days too."

INGREDIENTS

FOR THE CUPCAKES:

1 (15.25 ounce) package French Vanilla cake mix (see note below)

1/2 (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix

1 cup Greek strawberry yogurt

3/4 cup vegetable oil

1/2 cup water

4 eggs, lightly beaten

2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

1 cup diced fresh strawberries (about 10 medium berries)

FOR THE FROSTING:

4 sticks (2 cups) unsalted butter, room temperature

1.5 pack room temp cream cheese

1.5 pounds (24 ounces or about 5.5 cups) confectioners' sugar, sifted

2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

About 8 medium fresh strawberries, pureed (you'll need 4-5 tablespoons of puree)

INSTRUCTIONS

FOR THE CUPCAKES

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line muffin tin with paper liners or spray with non-stick cooking spray.

In the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment, or with a hand mixer in a large bowl, beat together the cake and pudding mixes, Greek yogurt, oil, water, eggs and vanilla. Beat for about two minutes on medium speed until well combined. Fold in diced strawberries

Using a large cookie scoop, distribute the batter between 24 muffin wells; about 3 tablespoons of batter per well.

Bake in preheated oven for 18-22 minutes or until the tops of the cakes spring back when lightly touched. Allow cupcakes to cool inside muffin tins for about 10 minutes. The cupcakes may develop a slight divot in the center as they cool, but no worries, you'll cover that with delicious frosting.

Remove cupcakes from muffin tins and allow to fully cool on a wire rack. Once cupcakes are cool, prepare your frosting.

FOR THE FROSTING

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and cream cheese on medium-high speed for about 5 minutes.

Turn the mixer down to low speed and gradually add in the confectioners' sugar until it is completely incorporated. Add in vanilla and 3 tablespoons of the strawberry puree, mix until incorporated. Turn off the mixer and check the buttercream for taste and texture. Gradually add in the last 2 tablespoons of strawberry puree until you reach the desired level of strawberry flavor. Please note that adding more than the recommended 5 tablespoons could result in a thinner frosting. Turn the mixer back up to medium-high speed and beat the mixture for about 3-4 minutes or until light and fluffy."
