The gist of what I heard is that from a psychological standpoint, watching as a kid means you put yourselves in her shoes but you aren‚Äôt frightened because she‚Äôs confident/tough/curious. Watching it as an adult differs because you‚Äôre watching a little kid run around alone in very terrifying situations. It was interesting. I wonder if this is true."
