aww,feok2oi,t1_feodh66,1579301277.0,"Again you seem to be brain dead

PEOPLES MISTAKES

that idea that they could handle a dog is the mistake not the dog itself

You’re the only source here haha pls you are yo dense to understand anything but what your own reflection spits back at you."
aww,feocwat,t1_feo5p6b,1579298351.0,"I am not saying they do not deserve love, but they are 100% someones mistake. They would not be dying at alarming rates if people were more responsible. Again I’m putting blame on people not animals. You seem to be taking it personally. 
People are responsible for their own actions. 

So how exactly am I being a horrible person? 

You come across as someone who looks down on people who shop out the exact dog they want.  Don’t blame people for wanting a dog that they want. 
What you are doing is going around make people feel shitty for their decisions. 

Blame people who don’t know how to handle the responsibility, not those who do."
aww,fenwtg0,t1_fenli6w,1579292065.0,"What is dumb is dumb people getting a dog, not knowing what it take to raise one, and then abandoning it or mistreating it because they do not know how to raise one.

I am not looking to take over someones mistake. Everyone else has the option to adopt but that does not mean people that do not want to adopt should be looked down on for their choice. 
Again, overcrowding can be solved if people are smarter about getting a dog in the first place. It is not a breeders fault that the person buying a puppy from them has no clue what it will entail."
aww,fenfy6l,t1_fen9dv2,1579283848.0,Due to dumb people. People who want a specific breed should not be required to adopt. This is coming from someone who adopted.
