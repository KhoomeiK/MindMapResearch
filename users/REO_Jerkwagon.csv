Once upon a time there was this group of thugs named the Sugargang. Normally they would go around terrorizing teeth, and making humans fat and full of the diabetes, but one day they found themselves roaming around a big vat full of warm liquid.   The liquid was getting hotter and hotter until finally it was freakin boiling in there!   Oh noes! After some time, things started to settle down, and chill out a little.   Our sugargang was weakened, but they survived.   

At that point, another rival gang of Yeast punks jumped into the same vat, lookin for trouble.   Oh boy they found some!   Those yeasties beat the ever loving hell out of the sugargang, ultimately eating the sugar punks!  Like any living thing, if you eat, you gotta poop.  And so the yeasties pooped, and they pooped a lot!  What were they pooping?  Turns out when yeast eats sugar, they poop out this stuff called alcohol.   After some more time, there is no more sugarpunks to beat up and eat, so the yeast gang, trapped in this vat, all die out.

Some silly humans wander by and see this vat of funky smellin stuff, and being typical bros, one of them says ""Dude, I dare you to drink it!""   They all hoot and hollar as the human bro drinks this funky stuff, but after few gulps, the brave bro starts getting all wibbily wobbily and laughing at stupid jokes.   The rest of them all crowd around and start drinking it themselves, leading to a big party, some fights, some risky nookie, and a feeling of hell the next morning.   

What those bros didn't know was that the yeast poop, alcohol, was havin it's own little party at the same time.   While the bros would drink the liquid, the alcohol hooligans would slowly break through the bro-guts, and into the bro-bloodstream.    From there, they travelled all around the body, seeing all sorts of wonderful things, and a few terrible places.   One of those terrible places was livertown, a dark smelly place that did NOT like outsiders.  A Sheriff's posse there in livertown put in overtime that night, killing all those alcohol hooligans, and sending the dead bodies over to the kidneys and pooper to pee and poop out.   There was a lot more alcohol than liver deputies though, so many of the alcohol hooligans were able to smash and break stuff before they got killed.    Their favorite place to smash and break stuff was in the brain, but how could they get in there?  They're still stuck on this closed highway full of bro-blood!   When enough of the alcohol got together up in the brain area, they were able to spill out of the blood highway, carefully seeping through the walls of the liquid prison they'd been stuck in.   Once they were out, they do what hooligans do best, and started smashing and breaking stuff up in those bro's brains, all willy nilly.   Eventually they'd get caught, and die out, but it was a party for everyone while they're up there havin' a riot!    

\---------------

Basically yeast converts sugar into alcohol, we drink it, and the alcohol molecules cross the blood-brain barrier into the brain, and mess with synaptic response.   

Obviously this is ELI5, and not a scientific paper, so some details are spotty, but we're after the gist, right?

I don't know if all models do ECG, so the old one might still be kicking around on some phones/watches.

~~They don't actually mean anything though.~~

edit:  Series 3 doesn't do ECG, and I see the grey one there, so I'm gonna go with ""red == heart health"" and ""grey == just heart rate""

In the US, I'm thinking the rural road our house was on, in TN, was basically the same idea.  Smoothed, then a layer of pea gravel, then a spray layer of the tar/asphalt/whatever mix over the top to kinda hold it in place.   The road was shit, but it didn't get washed out in the rain.  I won't link the exact area obviously, but it's in the general area of Dowelltown, TN.    They might have been paved proper in the 25 years since I lived there though.
