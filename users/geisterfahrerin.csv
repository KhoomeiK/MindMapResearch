But seriously, I have seem some topic like this at least 3 times on r/Relationships: “My SO leaves poop stains on sheets/towels, how can I approach him to talk about hygiene? Help Reddit!”

Edit: And IIRC, the conversation came up because one guy said that putting the toilet seat down to poop was gay?"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fc42kc1,t1_fc2fpy0,1577404957.0,"I posted the summary above, if you’re interested."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fc42eyj,t1_fc2flet,1577404844.0,"Here:

Shower, daily: Wash yourself with soap. Pay attention to your armpits, private parts and feet. Make a lot of foam and them rinse a lot. To really wash your private parts you have to squat and scrub the folds with soap, and them make sure you rinse everything until there’s no trace of product.

Hair: everyone is different, you have to wash it before your scalp starts looking greasy. Don’t try to hide with a beanie, it makes your head smell and is not good for the scalp. So, the shampoo: put a enough product on top of your head, sides and back. Massage your head, make foam, them rinse real good. If you are going to use conditioner, just put it on the length, don’t let conditioner touch your scalp. Them again, rinse real good.
Out of the shower: make sure you are drying yourself with a clean towel. Again, pay attention to your private parts, dry them really well, the folds and all. 
Put some deodorant on your dry pits.

Clothes, super important: a good shower is worth nothing if you are wearing smelly clothes. You have to keep them clean. Underwear and socks must be worn just once and them you wash them. Same for shirts. Some clothes might have more idiot in them, so the should be put in a bucket with water and soap for like an hour to start the process of removing the smell. Bras can be super smelly either, so wash them once a week. Put your shoes on the sun with the insoles out. Wear them with baby powder to avoid stink. Try not to wear the same pair of shoes for days. 

Teeth: You should brush your teeth at least twice a day, floss once and brush your tongue always. Bad breath comes from the tongue and not flossing, so make sure you are cleaning that white grime out of your tongue and flossing all your teeth. 

Trim your nails, from hands and feet. Keep them very short and there won’t be dirt under them.

IMPORTANT: Perfumes are not substitutes for showers, don’t think you can cover yourself in cologne to cover the stink. 
But buy a nice perfume to be your final touch! Don’t wear too much tough."

Oh, there it is!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fc1thgn,t3_efou0j,1577329203.0,"Listen, not having proper hygiene will make people not want to approach you, keep conversation or even work with you. This might make you lose jobs opportunities. I am under the impression you might think basic hygiene is not a big deal, but believe me, it is. 

I don’t remember if any coworker of mine have crooked teeth, but I remember the guy who has horrible breath and I avoid him. I know people who work in HR and they told me once one company had to let go some people for financial reasons and they chose the competent guy who was good at his job but everyone complained about his stink. 

I could go on, but the point is, you can dress and look super plain, but hygiene is a must always. If you need I can try to make like a “summary” of basic hygiene habits... and forgive me if I read as unfriendly, not my intention."
