dogswithjobs,fey1b2e,t3_eqtb7s,1579439486.0,"It looks pretty standard for a pp trained dog. It's probably her father that does all the training and he's proofing the dog with the little girl. It's hard to tell from just this video and no other context but this dog looks pretty tight. That said, it's probably not something I would choose to do, but I've seen people do some questionable things with their kids.

**Edited to add, she's giving the command so it looks like she's involved in the training itself."

AskReddit,feu9f7o,t3_eqfgfg,1579384421.0,"Good Satan. It's a super low budget movie that you can only watch on Amazon prime. I watched What We Do In The Shadows after my mom died and and it was the first time I laughed in weeks. Well Amazons algorithm recommend Good Satan and I went for it since WWDITS was so good. Fuck me, I fucking laughed until I cried. Satan gets an invitation from God to heaven and he thinks he's going to be allowed back up in heaven after 6,000 years. Well once he gets up there he realizes it's the second coming of Christ and he's going to be banished to hell forever, so this is him trying to prevent the second coming.  It's a raunchy, irreverent, POV comedy that pretty much nailed how I feel about religion."

PublicFreakout,fe7qpu6,t1_fe6j6kj,1578918074.0,"As a producer in the Seattle area that produced a weekly variety shows for years, I've seen literally hundreds of shows and performances and I think it's safe to say I have a more expansive knowledge base than you. I mean, you did go to two whole shows. To assume that performers have no idea how to to 'play a room' or edit their performances to the audience is laughable. There is totally PG drag and that's what they are doing here. It's literally somebody dressed as a character, reading a book. That's it. If you are unable to separate that in your head - that's your own issue. you're already equating drag and porn so it sounds like you have your own hang up to deal with.

You mentioned Disney characters and how they should just have someone dress as a Disney character and read to the kids. Well, Ursula and Cruella De Vil are pretty much straight up out of a drag handbook so I'm not sure what you're on about."
PublicFreakout,fe6bfrb,t1_fe5xyn0,1578886163.0,"They aren't over sexualized, they are hyper exaggerated... there's a difference. The fact that in your mind exaggerated feminity means hyper sexualization says more about you."
