The royal family don't actually own that much, the vast majority of it is held in trust. The current family own Balmoral and one other castle IIRC, the rest they get to use in much the same way that the CEO of Lloyds Bank gets a big shiny office and car. What you are suggesting would be akin to the CEO of Lloyds being allowed to pop into the safe and take whatever cash he wanted."
unitedkingdom,fdq54td,t1_fdpx3pg,1578655278.0,The point is that we could replace the royal family with a rubber duck and carry on exactly as we do now. We don't need an expensive head of state *with no powers whatsoever*.

unitedkingdom,fd28uk2,t1_fd241d2,1578143499.0,"Why does that sound like she was framed? She wrote the statement. There's also the bullshit about her being denied a lawyer - she was asked first thing if she wanted one and said no. It's amazing how the Brits all take her side; if the roles had been reversed we would be cheering on the Cypriots for jailing the lying Israeli slut. And the British press know that they get eyeballs by just publishing one side of the story, there hasn't been a proper independent story on the case here at all."

I'm guessing you are making the usual mistake that Americans make when they think that America is the only country in the world. An American attorney general is as scary to an Italian company as a Samoan attorney general would be.
worldpolitics,fbh7kb2,t1_fbesnf7,1576867123.0,"> Biden is saying the judge who is investigating his son is corrupt? Was this confirmed?

No you dumb traitorous fuck, THERE WAS NO INVESTIGATION INTO HIS SON. TRUMP ASKED FOR ONE. The world agreed that this judge was corrupt and Obama used the usual mechanisms of state to get the judge removed. This helped the people of Ukraine and the rest of the world and is a good thing.

Trump on the other hand believed Putin when he said that Ukraine hacked the servers, not Russia. Because trump is either a fucking moron or he is a Russian asset. Trump then asked for an investigation that would help ONLY HIM.

Trump is corrupt certainly, a moron or a Russian asset, and anybody who supports him now is going to be denying it in a few years time."
