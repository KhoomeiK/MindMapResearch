NewRiders,ff4mpp9,t1_ff4lv2c,1579567352.0,Thanks!
NewRiders,ff4ljn6,t1_ff4k17n,1579566537.0,"Okay, thank you, that gives me a better sense of scale.  
I'll look at something similar to the Triumph as well, I think, the sport bike thing is partly out of preference for that forward leaning seating position and partly out of vanity. I've actually been considering the Kawasaki Ninja and the Yamaha r3/r6 already, so it's good to know I'm on the right track there. I'll check out your other suggestions too."
NewRiders,ff4l181,t1_ff4glff,1579566183.0,"Does the amount of horsepowers influence how tall the bike is? Or am I reading that wrong? I really am a total noob so you could tell me anything, lol. But I guess that would be something I should keep in mind. And I can imagine I should make sure I can flatfoot. My mountain bike is too tall for me and I only recently realized other people like their bicycles to actually fit their height and that's why they don't wobble around on them like I do. I can't afford being wobbly like that on the road.  
I actually have been considering the ninja, it seems like a popular choice. And I'll make sure to look out for motorcycle shows, though they probably won't exactly be near me."

fatlogic,feqyxqj,t1_fepyhj7,1579347682.0,"it's still incorrect information though. they're equating two things to each other when they're not the same at all for the sake of making a snarky ""clever"" tweet. I've had an eating disorder too and I'm not out here bashing legitimate, safe weight loss methods just because they're vaguely reminiscent of struggles I'VE personally had. This person maybe shouldn't do IF, fine, but that doesn't mean they can just go ahead and demonize it and paint it as something toxic in general just because of a small percentage of its practice kinda sorta overlaps with disordered eating. Most dieting does that, big deal."
asexuality,fenxu8l,t3_epsi62,1579292439.0,"Oh my god, yes! My favourite films tend to be Pixar/Disney/Dreamworks/Ghibli or PG movies, like ones that are ""for the whole family to enjoy"". The messages and mental processes of those movies resonate with me so much more than most adult movies. They're about everything in life that adult movies seem to have forgotten exists. Friendship, beauty, wonder, creativity, adventure, identity, simple pleasures and living... life as it should be, free from the arbitrary and toxic complications that the concepts of romance and sex always seem to be surrounded by. Those two things never entered my life, so I have no motivation to sit through movies concerning that. It's honestly kind of depressing to me, how those themes seem to block out all other aspects of life or a person's identity once they set in."
AsexualAdults,fdp7hq4,t3_emimnx,1578621799.0,"I have a weird relation to my libido and don't really know where I stand with it because it can get triggered if I seek out the right things, because my body is fully functional after all and it's not like I have any hormonal problems or anything like that, but isn't active on its own. Like, I'd always have to actively awaken it. But I get what you mean. Remember that people being confused doesn't mean there is anything illogical or contradictory to this kind of experience as an asexual person, it just means these people have never been taught to differentiate between libido and attraction, since they've never had any reason to. For them it's the only natural thing to conflate those two concepts.Maybe try explaining it to them as: Imagine being hungry but not liking any of the food that exists, so you're kinda just left standing there with your hunger that's directionless. Imagine a car with an engine that's running and turned on but it's standing still, passive and self-contained, not headed in any direction. Imagine feeling giddy and in a good mood but for no particular reason. Think of how when you have an itch somewhere on your body, it's not like you desire for anyone else to scratch it for you, because what on earth is it about other people that should make you want to share itching with anyone...? Why would you invite another person to help you do a mundane task you're perfectly capable of sorting out yourself? Things like that."
jawsurgery,fdb0wim,t3_ekflk2,1578252462.0,"It's pretty normal. Could be caused by the change in your diet and levels of exercise, or by a change in blood circulation and the fact that because of the swelling, there's toxins and waste inside your skin that your body tries to flush out and get rid of, which happens through your pores, too. Also, yeah, the oiliness from your skin being stretched out probably doesn't help either."

jawsurgery,fcw15vl,t3_ej6dxa,1578014752.0,"It's been almost 6 years for my DJS, and I haven't had any relapse. 
I have recently had to have the hardware in my upper jaw removed, though, because it spontaneously got inflamed. It may even have caused one of my teeth to die, but that's not clear yet.

I'm not sure how much hold there is to this, but if you want to optimize your chances of avoiding relapse, you might want to look into orthotropics and mewing."
fatlogic,fcnew4o,t3_ei42xa,1577810304.0,"I'm pretty sure ""focus on health without focusing on weight"" has shown to be better mostly because conscious focus on weight loss can make some people obsessive and unhappy with their bodies and progress, and get impatient and give up, whereas focusing only on improving your health will make you lose weight by proxy anyway, while saving you the stress and struggle of being emotionally invested in it. But it sounds like this woman took it as meaning weight doesn't play a factor at all?... sigh.

That's also funnily enough the definition of body positivity, too, isn't it? focusing on your health and not feeling invested in the way your body looks because a healthy lifestyle will give you the body you need."
RedditLaqueristas,fci6hsb,t1_fchsxny,1577658317.0,"Thanks! You may already know but SimplyNailogical has a good video on how to make a mani last. Her tips pretty much correspond with what I'm doing. And I've been using a quickdry topcoat for a while, which helps, but this is the first time I've used an actual base coat as well (OPI's Natural Nail base coat) and I think that's what's really making that final difference."

asexuality,fchgcy8,t3_eh7g4c,1577650252.0,"people here saying they don't... isn't this pretty much exactly the thing/impulse that we've established separates them from asexual people, though?

not trying to stir up problems, just genuinely confused now."
asexuality,fcftzq8,t3_eh4oi2,1577633759.0,I personally think that test is bullshit... no offense to you but I just can't work with how the questions are phrased and the lack of nuance. the results don't feel well-grounded.
asexuality,fbye4bh,t3_ef5e6j,1577214605.0,"they wouldn't dare speak up off anon, lol.
Tell them that descriptive pronouns =/= trying to be a snowflake. It's not just a tumblrism  to be able to put specific terms to your orientation. If you are a person who rarely ever experiences romantic attraction and when you do, it's to any gender, you are by definition demipanromantic. A person who's romantically but not sexually attracted to the same gender is by definition heteroromantic, although many ""normal"" people would probably just say straight because they think it covers it. I'm saying this because I know it's the practice of simply putting words on your very real orientation that triggers some of these people, as if being descriptive and aware of the nuances of your identity is synonymous with trying to be oppressed.
These orientations are real, whether this person likes it or not. They're just detailed descriptions. That doesn't make them any less normal or real."
