AskReddit,fed1mxe,t1_fecbhrp,1578994175.0,"About 7 years ago my mom was telling me that she thought she might be pregnant because she was having the symptoms but she was post menopause and thought it to be impossible so she thought mayne she had cancer (again). I asked if she used protection and she said ""well. Kind of."" I asked her what that meant and she let's out a big sigh and says ""I use the pullout method"" btw I was 15 lol. I have a 6 year old little brother now."
AskReddit,fed16t0,t1_fecf7vw,1578993520.0,Why my bf cant have a motorcycle. He is an EMT though so he understands my fear.
cats,fdgcmsv,t1_fdfqzqy,1578390281.0,"I have a clear glass shower door and for the past few days it has been left open after showering. My cat lives to run in the shower when we are done. Today, he ran into the glass door. I nearly died laughing"
cats,fdgcgz6,t3_ekym3c,1578390045.0,My cat lays on me while I sleep... almost every night now... I think it's become his thing
cancer,fd8br0w,t1_fd7pqqh,1578216491.0,Monday I'm getting it shaved. I'd do it myself but I need someone to be able to see what they are doing so that the tender burns on my scalp dont get bothered too much. I've shaved my head before and dont mind the shaved look. It's just different when I'm not in control of it.
crochet,fd69djr,t1_fd5adja,1578187526.0,I watched a YouTube video where they just do a 10 by 10 of the stitch. I am making a much larger... maybe washcloth size on now. Really getting the hang of it but my fingers are a little sore lol. I love it. It's so much fun. Cant wait to try something more intricate.
crochet,fd40wtc,t1_fd3r3le,1578163373.0,Thank you!
crochet,fd3oybh,t3_ejukm5,1578160440.0,That sounds so challenging! I'm just starting out and cant wait to do stuff like this wow!
cantsleep,fcwsdxs,t1_fcws9xx,1578035688.0,You are probably right. Still imagining worst case scenarios but I need to sleep. Trying so hard to relax.
cats,fcwr9he,t1_fcwr6p7,1578034455.0,My Larry can definitely sense when I'm upset or stressed. He just readjusted and is now holding my hand
cancer,fcwmxr3,t1_fcwmafq,1578030203.0,For a second I thought you meant that you cut of an actual foot. Like this lady cut off her limb?!? Lol. I've cut my hair super short so many times before but this is so different. And though I'm fine with buzzing my head again I'm kind of afraid to because my scalp is so sore in some spots. It's probably burns from the radiation which is probably why my hair is coming out now. Rather than a week ago. The radiation techs were surprised when I told them my hair started to come out. Anyways... I'm afraid the clippers would hurt my tender scalp... but I also dont want bald patches... especially since I go back to work next weekend... and I cant wear a hat...
LifeProTips,fcnv8nm,t1_fcnqfun,1577819103.0,I'm thankful for all of the people that paid for my moms funeral. Couldn't imagine adding all of the debt to my 15000 buck in medical debt... so far
Whatcouldgowrong,fcfrrhw,t1_fcf95es,1577633133.0,My fiance will sometimes go whole shifts without any sleep and they eat when they can. EMT/paramedic/firefighter can be really bad for your physical and mental health.
Whatcouldgowrong,fcfqmm1,t1_fcey5eo,1577632768.0,My fiance is an EMT. They have some 12 hour trucks that run during the day but other trucks are 24 on 48 off. They can work 48 hours but have to take the next 24 off. They have a mandatory list that if they get down to like 45 on the list they can be mandated and extra 12 hours double pay.
nekoatsume,fcdjrcr,t3_egt177,1577610615.0,Can I steal this for a tshirt?

Showerthoughts,fc2ysn9,t3_efudpe,1577377555.0,"Due to TV delays, it's probably more like the first word of 2020 from millions of people though."
bedwetting,fc1uhrz,t1_fc1ugig,1577330113.0,Thank you.
bedwetting,fc1ud4y,t1_fc1u2h9,1577329997.0,My health insurance is through my job... seems good on paper... not so good in application. Applied for Medicaid per my radiation offices financial counselor's recommendation. And if I dont get approved I can apply for other help. It's a waiting game now. Thanks for the talk. You have been a great help.
bedwetting,fc1tpzl,t1_fc1tkrp,1577329421.0,Well that's good. My only worry now is paying for my medical bills. Hopefully radiation will be my cure. Cuz I dont know how much more I can take.
bedwetting,fc1sxj7,t1_fc1sq9k,1577328706.0,"Wow. That sounds.... terrifying. More terrifying than my tumor... though the damage to my pituitary is done, the tumor has a 90% cure rate with only radiation."
bedwetting,fc1shkb,t1_fc1s7pj,1577328310.0,"Well I'm on meds for it now... I was having trouble sleeping for some time but seem to have adjusted. It does seem to happen closer to my DI med being due though... about 530. I take the pill at 7ish. Yeah my TSH, FSH, and Estrogen are all extremely low. The tumor also invades my hypothalamus soooo.... How old are you?"
bedwetting,fc1ryfe,t1_fc1affz,1577327832.0,"I have a malignant brain tumor on my pituitary. Only part of it could be surgically removed. Caused a whole bunch of issues such as hypothyroidism, diabetes insipidus, and cortisol deficiency to name a few."
