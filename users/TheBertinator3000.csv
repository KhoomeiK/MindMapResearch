Also, get a set of winter tires. They're better and cheaper than AWD. If you get a cheap second set of rims out of the junk yard, then you can pretty easily swap them on and off yourself in the fall and spring. The extra traction and stopping power (AWD increases traction, but does *nothing* to improve stopping power. That's why winter tires are so much better) does wonders for driving confidence on snow and ice.

*BUY WINTER TIRES*. They're a cheap insurance policy in the grand scheme of things. There's a good reason it's illegal to run all season tires in some northern countries during the winter months."

AskReddit,ff9f8cb,t1_ff99tka,1579711740.0,"Whether or not there's an overall natural bias is an interesting discussion, but let's not pretend that's what's going on with Reddit. There are some factors in the way this website is set up that makes it a natural breeding ground for echo chambers.

Firstly. Reddit's demographic is not representative of the overall world population. Most of the users are young, white, male, liberal, involved in the tech industry, urban, and USA citizen. It's hard to get an accurate view of the overall world when we're dealing with such a narrow subset of people. So many voices and perspectives are pretty much absent entirely from the discussions here.

If that wasn't bad enough, the fact that subreddits exist make the situation worse (in terms of echo chamber creation). Having different subreddits actively encourage people to seek out like minded individuals. That, combined with the upvote/downvote ranking system, encourages popular ideas to be shared and dissenting opinions/people to stay silent or just leave the subreddit altogether.

Reddit isn't the cause of the problem, but the way it's set up does actively encourage the formation of echo chambers. It's not the match that lights the fire, but it is the lighter fluid that encourages it to grow.

I still think Reddit is beneficial overall, but structural issues like these make most political subreddits, with any sizeable following, into powerful echo chambers."
AskReddit,ff9c4l8,t1_ff98t07,1579709606.0,"Well, I mean, it is both sides. You can argue about which one is worse, but at the end of the day what does that accomplish?

What does it matter if you prove the other side is more full of shit than your's, when you're both full of it? How does that do anything to address the real problem that there's so much shit involved?

Focusing, on a more meta level, on why there's so much shit involved, and how we can reduce it, seems more productive to me. It addresses the core of the problem better, doesn't it?"

He paints the picture that lifting belts are used as an injury prevention tool at heavier weights, but that's not the reason I usually hear for using them. Usually it's about increasing abdominal pressure and core stiffness so that you can lift heavier weights without running out of core strength/stability. If there is any injury prevention reason for using a weight belt, it's usually secondary to this performance benefit.

Lifting heavier weights exposes you to more risk of injury, so it's not surprising that he found an increase in injuries correlated to powerlifting belt use.

That's just my take as an amateur though. I certainly wouldn't try to comment on the rest of the article."

It's more that he only talks about the hormonal side of things, and pretty much ignores all other factors. He makes it sound like the hormonal stuff is a complete solution on its own, and it's not.

I've enjoyed using fasting techniques, but they're not magic. They help with hunger regulation, but they can't override calories in calories out. They just make it easier to reduce how many calories you eat on a daily basis.

I've tried extended fasting, and loved it. Hard to eat fewer than 0 calories/day, so it got super quick results. There was one side effect no one warned me about though (and genetics were certainly a contributing factor since its an autoimune disease). The harsh nature of extended fasting, in combination with not getting enough protein (because I was literally eating nothing during the week long fasts), set off a nasty bout of Alopecia Areata (patchy hair loss). That was a rough year of recovery and I've sworn off extended fasting after that. I'm assuming a lack of protein was the more important factor here for complicated reasons, but it's a bit of a tricky disease. Definitely caused by some aspect of the week long fasts though.

On a different note, intermittent fasting was awesome too, but it has its limits as well. It was good enough to help me reach the healthy BMI range, but appetite increases as you start to really get on the leaner side. Intermittent fasting was definitely not enough to get shredded, or even just ""toned"" (which really just means slightly fatter than shredded)."

I haven't really decided whether losing weight or keeping it off is actually harder, but they're both different goals that require different mindsets. The sooner you start thinking about how that transition to something you can sustain for the rest of your life is going to work, the better. It also doesn't hurt to take a few days or a week or two to take a break from the weight loss slog (especially if it's been wearing on you and you need a break) and just practice trying to maintain your weight. You'll learn stuff that'll be useful once you reach your goal and have to make the transition for real. Having some sort of plan for that is what prevents you from yo-yo-ing back up.

He really tries to play it off as though calories don't matter and that's just not true. The hormonal theory stuff has massive implications for how hungry you feel, how energetic you feel, etc, etc. But calories are pretty much the end all be all when it comes to raw weight loss.

I'm pretty sure some level of superficial-ness and emphasis on looks is inevitable for all of us. It doesn't automatically make you a good or bad person, so long as you keep it in check. To some extent, it's just human nature.

GetMotivated,fepi1sj,t1_fenjrtz,1579321034.0,"Been there, lost that weight, and I can tell you it's a little of category A and a little of category B *FOR SURE*.

There was a definite uptick all across the board with how people treated me once I lost most of the weight and started putting more effort into my appearance. It wasn't anything super obvious, but people from both sexes and all walks of life generally were a bit more friendly, slightly more eager to help me with whatever, and just took a bit more notice of me in general. It wasn't huge, but it was noticeable and the difference definitely existed.

I even became more aware that I did the same things myself on a subconscious level, which is the main thing that stopped me from being bitter over it. We all do this a little bit, even if we don't notice it. The best we can really do is try to be aware of our biases and minimize their effects on our actions.

The change in the way I viewed myself though, that was a much larger magnitude. My view of myself *drastically* improved once I lost weight and started really getting in shape. Part of that was I liked myself better and part of that was that it was one of the hardest things I've ever done, and *I made it*. I proved to myself that I had it in me.

As backstory, I learned to drive stick shift on a barbones 2007 s197 v6 mustang. With that in mind, the logical next step was, of course, to buy a 2013 Grabber Blue Boss 302 from the same generation. It can be brash and obnoxious, especially when the side dumps are open. That solid rear axle can certainly be lively at times. But that all adds to it's charm!

I even still have the v6, which functions as a fun upscale beater for the winter months. Winter tires and a few bags of sand work wonders for traction, and rear wheel drive means it's still more than happy to cut loose when I want it to!"

Some things would have changed with a different president, but the war would very much have happened regardless of who was in charge, I suspect. We didn't exactly get out of war under Obama either.

Idealistic arguments aren't going to convince independent political entities (which the states were) to join up. What would the small states have gotten out of your deal to ensure they weren't politically out-muscled by the larger states?"

Where would the politics of our country be drastically different? There's only been a few times where the electoral college has swung the vote, and the president doesn't really have at much direct power as most think.

And, more importantly, how would you have convinced the small states to join up, if not by giving them some political sway to balance against their larger counterparts?"
GetMotivated,fd14rkb,t1_fd12hww,1578127540.0,"For real. Though it can work in even weirder ways. I saw myself as significantly skinnier than I actually was before I started my weight loss journey. I saw my former self as significantly fatter than he was during my weight loss journey. And I saw my then current self as (slightly) less lean than I was when nearing the end of my weight loss and attempting to get as lean as possible before starting my first bulk (just to see what I could accomplish). 

I like to think I've got a fairly objective viewpoint now, but it's hard to fully believe that since I never noticed how distorted my viewpoints were until after the fact in any of those past scenarios. The tricks the brain can play are truly wild, and sometimes even dangerous!"

There would have been no country if they hadn't been able to convince the states to work together and more or less all agree to join up.

Though it may no longer always be obvious, we were kind of analogous to the EU, in a way. Not really a single entity, but a collection of smaller political entities."

Basically, committing a logical fallacy doesn't make your point wrong. It means you argued your point using flawed logic, but it doesn't mean the point itself is wrong.

I find this fallacy fascinating because it's mostly committed by people who are highly familiar with logical fallacies and should therefore know better."
