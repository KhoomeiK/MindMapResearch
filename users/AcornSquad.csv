MonsterHunterWorld,fdtfapm,t3_em6mou,1578715936.0,I just purchased Monster Hunter World and the dlc and I'm really enjoying it! It's pretty difficult alone though! Like does anyone have any tips? Combat is still iffy for me.

PS4,fdqoda7,t3_emspts,1578671369.0,It shouldn't be too late at all! The PS4 is an amazing console. Most developers will develop for PS4 and PS5 as well. Only thing would be the PS5 console exclusives.

college,fdiran3,t3_eldw5t,1578449282.0,"I'm garbage at math. But I've been sticking with Computer Science despite that and being new to writing code. So far despite having issues with math it's going good. My husband wasn't too great at Math either. He failed a few classes and had to take them over. He finished with his Bachelor's and is now working for a good company. He doesn't use much math either. Despite people telling you to quit because you're bad at math, don't. Coding is little math once you're out working. You can definitely do it!"

rant,fcsuf1i,t3_eikaqt,1577925373.0,I eat shrimp with the shell and tail but if the head is attached as well then definitely no thanks! Most restaurants should have the shimp deshelled though. If they don't I feel like it's lazy of them to not want to take the time to deshell the shrimp.

I used to beat myself up about it but after a while I realized that I'm going to definitely make mistakes! And I definitely have days when I'm like whatever and end up eating more times during the day! So don't give up! If I can you definitely can!

blackcats,fchmhau,t3_eh7ql3,1577651841.0,Mine is the same way! He's also a black cat too! He loves us but if he hears a voice he doesn't recognize or a sound that's outside he'd dash into the room and under the bed! One time my husband had friends over and he hid behind the couch. I had to pick him up and take him into the room or he'd be there all evening. Guess where he went! I love him bunches though.

pcmasterrace,fbyfr3f,t1_fbyfhxk,1577215777.0,My friend told me it was trash. I don't really know much about them to be honest! Seems like it's running fine for me! He was like bronze ones are garbage.
pcmasterrace,fbyeerg,t3_ef56re,1577214811.0,I have the same card and I'm not having any issues playing anything on Ultra! I know it's not a crazy top tier card but it's doing great for me!
pcmasterrace,fbyd5mw,t1_fbyc7q9,1577213919.0,"Yep! My friend always told me how good Skyrim is when you mod it! So I went ahead and got a few mods. If a few is around 90! I haven't did a playthrough yet, only been testing mods. But I'm excited to try it out!"
