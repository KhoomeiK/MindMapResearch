My dogs laze about all day, waiting for the expensive food and toys I provide, they take shelter in my home, get free car rides and daily walks while I slave away to keep them. It is a dogs JOB to provide amusement and cuddles, it’s an exchange for me picking up their hot wet turds in small black scented baggies."

It releases me from liability.
More importantly someone losing their life when you assured them it was ok is a huge deal. At least you are owning your mistake and realize how serious this could have been."
