NuclearRevenge,fep4ter,t1_fep1icp,1579312145.0,"I don’t know about the letter specifically, and I haven’t read it. I will say that people lie, and that historically people have said and done things that go against their beliefs and religion. Regardless of the validity of the letter I personally believe that Hamilton shot to kill. Am I right? Maybe not, but we can say for certain where his bullet ended up, so we know he did shoot, despite being a “good Christian”"
NuclearRevenge,fep02lu,t3_eq8idw,1579309135.0,"Alright: listen up Hamilton fanatics and people saying he intentionally missed. The musical is very historically inaccurate; especially in the 2nd act. Now everyone involved is dead but as a massive history nerd/someone who knows about guns, let me give my two cents. 

I could write an essay on this, but I’ll summarize in the least geeky way I can. I’m a Hamilton fan as well. Catchy music is catchy music. For (slightly) more accurate versions look up Hamilton Deleted Songs. 

“They won’t teach you this in your classes, but look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses! Why, if not to take deadly aim?....”

Yes, Hamilton wore his glasses

“I watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger”

People there report Hamilton was pacing, nervous and fiddling with the trigger. The trigger part is important for later. 

“Confession time, here’s what I got: my fellow soldiers will tell you I’m a terrible shot”

Must I really say anything? 

In a duel years earlier Burr had a button blown off his coat, and after that his philosophy with dueling was either don’t, or if you must, shoot to kill. 

In the deleted songs I mentioned earlier Hamilton sings about the sun rising in his eyes over New York City. Yes, the sun was in his eyes. What it doesn’t tell you is that Hamilton was downhill from Burr, and there was a tree behind Burr. 

Burr and Hamilton shot at each other. Burr fired downhill with the sun to his back and fatally wounded Hamilton. Hamilton, wearing his glasses, shot uphill, with the sun in his eyes and a tree behind Burr. His bullet was found in a branch about seven feet above Burr’s head. 

Now back to the guns. A few years ago (after the release of Hamilton) the museum that houses the guns that were used in the duel took them apart to clean them. These guns belonged to Hamilton. The man cleaning them discovered that they had hair triggers. Basically, a gun trigger isn’t easy to pull; especially back then. A hair trigger can be pulled and it makes it much easier to be pulled. It was suggested that one of them might have been used, but as so much time had passed, let’s disregard that. 

Here’s what we know:
- Hamilton brought the guns
- Hamilton fires uphill
- Sun was in Hamilton’s eyes
- Bullet ended up above Burr’s head
- Witnesses report Hamilton practicing pulling the trigger

If it took the museum over 200 years to find the hair triggers, there’s no chance in hell Burr found them. So while Hamilton was in a shitty position, he had an advantage. With everything Hamilton had against him AND factoring in the inaccuracy of guns at the time, it is totally plausible to assume that Hamilton was aiming for Burr’s head or chest. 

In my humble opinion, Hamilton shot to kill; but missed. 

Please keep in mind everyone who knows is dead, I’m just a 17 year old with a passion for history and too much time on her hands. 

TLDR: Hamilton very likely could’ve been shooting to kill Burr, but who knows. Also please don’t slaughter me :)"

Kid was hungry in Spanish class. Substitute teacher was in a really bad mood. The kid ended up dumping his backpack’s contents onto the floor and left. About fifteen minutes later the door opened and the kid was sitting in the hall, but so close to the door his toes were almost in the classroom. His entire backpack was filled with snacks from one of the vending machines. He spent the entire class sitting in the hallway, eating stuff from his backpack and never breaking his gaze from the sub and occasionally shouting an answer into the room. There’s no rule about not eating in the hallway"

I think they must’ve been. When you donate to this hospital you can pick whether it goes to a kid, teen or late teen/early adult (depending on situation, sometimes there are people as old as 22 in the children’s hospital here). Since I was turning 17 I got grouped in with the late teen/early adult (17-22). That card is clearly advertising/suggesting having a pop up boutique"
antiMLM,fe8olo7,t3_eo3jeh,1578928685.0,"Unfortunately DoTerra isn’t the first company to do something similar. I spent my birthday on my hospital’s pediatric oncology ward and a few child life workers threw together a birthday basket for me from things people had donated to the CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL. For the most part it was neat and useful stuff, but I did get a pair of LuLaRoe leggings with a recruiting card attached. Don’t get me wrong; I’m glad that they donated stuff to a children’s hospital, especially because a lot of needy people come here as it’s the only Level 1 Trauma Center between here and Worcester or if it’s really bad, Boston, but the fact that they attached a recruiting card is disgusting. Also, I know how this hospital’s donation system works and they would’ve had to choose to donate to the children’s hospital and mark it as something for older teens"

I have an aunt who got breast cancer and a case of lung cancer from my chain smoking grandmother, but nothing directly from my parents. What I have is ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia), which as far as I understand means it just kind of happens. As far as I’m aware the only known genetic link with ALL is that a kid is a tiny bit more likely to get it if a sibling had it. Luckily I’m an only child so there won’t be any regifting in my household. Obviously chances can be higher if you go and drink from a puddle from Chernobyl or something.
