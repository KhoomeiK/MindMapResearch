nonprofit,ffdeso1,t3_esvxpb,1579819362.0,I’ll admit I don’t know the legalities of it all but on its face this looks unethical at best. I’ve worked in places where they’ve gone back and asked a donor if they’d be ok moving their funds as we  made target for one goal and needed it more elsewhere but that depends on the type of relationship one has with a donor and needs to be approached honestly.
careerguidance,ffb87vb,t3_eskoi9,1579754689.0,"I wish I had advice for you but I don’t. I love how you organized and framed your post though. I’m also Canadian, around your age and hoping to make a transition out of my field. Very much an introvert myself. Feel free to message if you want to chat. Hope this goes well. :)"
depression_memes,ffavju3,t3_esilvd,1579745483.0,"No, what’s that like?"
introvert,ffao6fw,t3_escvg7,1579740557.0,Omg I’ve been dealing with this more than usual. I don’t sleep until close to midnight lately because work has been awful and I need more time to recover from the people and long commute.
AskReddit,ff88k2t,t3_erzmpz,1579669128.0,The royal family it seems.
oddlysatisfying,ff7t1m6,t1_ff7ga28,1579657663.0,I was thinking the same thing! Was my first thought when seeing this!
nonprofit,fekqi1i,t1_fekby1k,1579205513.0,Thanks! I appreciate the advice. I do worry it starts to look like too much bouncing around (I’ve had contracts before) but I think the most important thing is to escape the toxic situation.
nonprofit,feic8yo,t3_ep5hj6,1579135125.0,"Hey OP, I’m in a fairly similar situation but not yet out of the situation. I think you did what’s right for you and honestly you’ll probably start waking up feeling relieved before too long. I wish you a speedy two weeks and the best in your professional future!"
nonprofit,feibxo7,t1_fehkn0v,1579134915.0,"This is where I think I’m at right now tbh. I’m in a toxic place. I’m constantly drowning in work, which I’ve told people and haven’t been given support. I have been given more tasks though. How did your moves work out when you did this? I hope it’s better for you now."
cats,febfr98,t3_eo7ydp,1578958340.0,He’s adorable and they’re jealous!
PersonalFinanceCanada,fdzxnxm,t1_fdzve3m,1578798316.0,I've never looked into it myself before now and figured that was the case but in some of my searches saw that some people seemed VERY against LOCs so I wasn't sure I was just missing something.
depression_memes,fdwyi0o,t3_en77v3,1578763544.0,I cried on my birthday at work once. And was the one who had to stay late to finish something while everyone else went home. That was fun.
AmItheAsshole,fdw2qal,t1_fdtzbq1,1578754442.0,"Hopefully OP can show his ex and daughter these stories, but I have a bad feeling they still won’t be convinced."
cats,fdw1nb5,t1_fdueeyd,1578754147.0,Aw thanks. They used to cuddle just like this and had the same colouring. They’d share a tiny cat bed.
cats,fdsy83k,t3_en0ajl,1578709492.0,This looks identical to my two cats who were best buddies. The one passed away but the other is my cuddle bug and still around!
nonprofit,fdrqty9,t1_fdr4oc3,1578688228.0,Is that full time?
wholesomememes,fdph19b,t3_emcha3,1578628413.0,I just heard a story of a girl who wanted a cat but is allergic. She ended up getting scammed by a fake cat breeder for $600 who didn’t give her whatever pure breed she thought she was getting. I don’t feel bad for her at all. She deserves it. If you’re allergic find a different pet or stock up on allergy meds. I’m allergic but I deal with it. I understand some allergies are much worst but find a different solution.
nonprofit,fdpgqkp,t1_fdopopm,1578628188.0,"I do understand that, but I’m sure there’s a decent middle ground in another type of job or industry. Any non-profit experience I’ve had is essentially that I’m doing the job of 2 or 3 employees. There’s never downtime."
nonprofit,fdpgjc6,t1_fdnolw6,1578628042.0,"I couldn’t agree with this more. I’m currently working in the non-profit sector and I want out. The workload is insane, they won’t hire anyone else to help, and when I express my need for support I’m not only gaslighted but given MORE tasks. Obviously not every charity is this way but they’re underpaid and awful. My only thing right now is I’m trying to push back and won’t work extra. Unless they want to pay me overtime (they won’t).

The moral of the story is volunteer in your spare time or fundraiser for a cause you care about, but don’t work for non-profits."
TwoXChromosomes,fdp77xv,t3_em7ox3,1578621619.0,"I once gave someone my number at a networking event because I felt pretty pressured. When they texted to hang out I said I wasn’t interested in that and only gave my number because I felt pressured. He didn’t take it well but left me alone or I blocked him, don’t remember. I just remember him being super persistent and it was easier to just do it than reject him and maybe have a scene. I still wish I just stood up for myself but you never know how that’ll go!"
nonprofit,fdm63py,t1_fdlycbn,1578540706.0,This is very similar to what I do. What kind of roles did she find? I’d love to hear more about this.
PersonalFinanceCanada,fdkz1pi,t1_fdkh3mb,1578514103.0,So would I.
nostalgia,fdjup92,t3_elq61d,1578488117.0,Omg. I have these pants and they still fit. This needs to be my Halloween costume somehow!
aspirebudgeting,fdj49y2,t1_fdj1ipr,1578458049.0,I wondered about this for a similar situation of my health benefits through work. For myself I debated only adding in the health benefits I didn’t get covered because otherwise I’m usually paid back within a week or two. So I don’t count that as an expense per se except what didn’t get covered. Not exactly the same situation but seemed kinda similar.
nostalgia,fdh0z2l,t3_el305k,1578413007.0,Omg I absolutely remember this.
antiassholedesign,fdf921x,t1_fdf425b,1578356147.0,I live in Canada and my Prime shows all these extra movies and shows but tells me I’ll have to subscribe to “Starz” or other such channel subscriptions in order to watch them. It’s laid out in a way that you can mostly tell which are free and which aren’t but it does deceivingly look like there’s more available than there is.
YouShouldKnow,fdcpe3b,t1_fdcogtf,1578280691.0,I know. I hate that they just let them go! I don’t know that they can do the same where we are. I’m so sorry this happened.
YouShouldKnow,fdcj7w0,t3_ekjllg,1578276241.0,This is really shitty but hopefully doesn’t discourage people from microchipping their pet. It does make it a lot easier. I’ve found a few strays in my time and always go check their microchip at the vet. I’m so sorry this person stole your pet though.
Baking,fd9g9ro,t3_ek7uk1,1578232975.0,"I can see which colours represent which princesses in a lot of cases. I see Jasmine, Belle, I think Snow White, Sleeping Beauty! That’s cool!"
depression,fd5cpjy,t3_ejztdk,1578176321.0,"We have a big one here in Canada once a year (I think it’s soon) and I HATE it. I’ve had depression for nearly 20 years and I’m decently open about it with trusted people. On that campaign day everyone is like “yes! Share your struggles, erase the stigma!” and they’re retweeting and posting all these positive supportive messages but those are the very same people who ignore texts or attempts to get together. I hate those campaigns and that day so much and it can eff right off!"
2meirl4meirl,fd4r054,t1_fd4psn5,1578170218.0,Snake on the Nokia brick was great!
2meirl4meirl,fd3fuhf,t1_fd2u2vn,1578157894.0,Right? I think I was that friend in school when there was a group I never belonged to but ate lunch with but then never had friends after that.
depression,fd3atm9,t1_fd28lha,1578156453.0,I’m sorry you feel the same way. It’s very painful.
depression,fd39hfs,t1_fd1uwif,1578156012.0,This is very much like any experiences I’ve had sharing how bad things were. No one really reaches out or does anyone but I’m sure they’d be the first to post some bullshit about how they “never knew how bad it was”.
relationships,fd31npu,t1_fd316i6,1578153858.0,Yeah! If it were me I’d be taking it personally and internalizing it.
AskReddit,fd2xg1q,t1_fczukvx,1578152659.0,"This was so dumb, I grew up in Canada and we had the same. No boys were interested in my bony shoulders and I was otherwise very much covered. I think the dress codes around here have drastically been changed since then."
AskReddit,fd2w2gi,t3_ejogd0,1578152201.0,"That you can’t just take out a book to read in social situations where people just all decide to go on their phone. I was at a wedding recently and a little girl took out a monster sized book and people kinda gave her looks but it was baller.

Note: I think it’s rude to have our phones out in tons of social situations like these but I don’t think a book is any worse and somehow it seems like it is."
AskReddit,fd2v9nf,t1_fd29mg0,1578151944.0,Not all heroes wear capes!
relationships,fd1cdfg,t1_fd0isul,1578129763.0,"I’m so glad most of the top comments I see are like this! This is may be one of the lowest feelings a person can have, when basically everyone bails. You all need to make it up to her somehow and all show up for her. Yes, it was unfortunate timing and that’s no one’s fault but that crummy feeling might stick with her for a very long time.  

Edit: one typo"
YouShouldKnow,fczld27,t3_ejm2zb,1578103752.0,Looked at mine and it was off! Sweet! Don’t remember doing it but my memory sucks.

We appreciate the photos here :)"
AmItheAsshole,fcr5z9u,t1_fcq7z8l,1577897272.0,This needs to be higher up!!
depression,fcoyubu,t3_csfwc7,1577845383.0,I hope you’re feeling better than when you wrote this. Found your post because I searched weight loss and hair loss with depression as that’s what I’m currently dealing with.
52books,fcosd1q,t1_fcolikd,1577840249.0,"Yeah. I’d say 5-10% of my reading is audio books and some books I’ll switch between. I’ll start with an audiobook to get into the story then open the physical book a few chapters in. I think it’ll help get me back into it for sure!

That’s a good idea, I’ll do it as I go!"
52books,fcokzox,t1_fcokr0w,1577834874.0,I did wonder if that’s what you did! I like it! I’ll do it next year when I actually read a decent amount of books! Congrats on surpassing the goal!
52books,fcok4ry,t3_ei91i8,1577834251.0,How did you get this image? Was it part of a book app or did you make it?
AmItheAsshole,fcm9b7f,t1_fcltruv,1577767721.0,100% this. There’s a whole business around selling handles. You don’t have to do it but if I were you I’d consider looking into the amount it could go for (if you wanted money). You don’t owe her anything though.
movies,fcm5ef0,t3_ehnnza,1577764685.0,This is ridiculous! There’s no world in which Cats is a better musical than Wicked and there never will be. Who thought Cats would make a better movie!? What garbage.
depression,fclrakb,t3_ehmqfh,1577754560.0,"I didn’t know what sub this was when I read the title and my first thought was “have depression” and lo and behold. Anyhow :( I get it, I lost 9-10lbs a few months ago which I never got back. Hope things get better."
relationships,fckys4p,t3_ehoza5,1577736089.0,I don’t know what province you’re in but I believe in Ontario you only need one party (you) to know about a recording. Definitely double check that though. I’d look into the law in your province and record the police through any interactions. That’s so fucked up.
Eyebleach,fciqvaw,t1_fcgjvwu,1577667657.0,Literally showed this photo to my bf and said “living his best life” then opened the comments to see this at the top. *tips hat to you*
solotravel,fcinyr7,t3_eh7usw,1577665821.0,"I don’t know if this would help as you have anxiety and might be better doing a few solo activities, but there’s a company that does free tours in Europe, including Berlin. You tip at the end for what you think it was worth. I’m a solo traveller with social anxiety and have met other solo travellers on those tours around my age which has really helped me. I’ve even had lunch with them only to part ways hours later but just that short contact with someone near my age was comforting sometimes. The company is called Sandemann’s. If this isn’t something for you that’s totally okay, but wanted to throw it out there and it’s good for a budget. I agree about going to the grocery store and finding a snack or going to McDonald’s (free wifi!)"

AmItheAsshole,fca2kcq,t3_egs12n,1577562119.0,YTA. You tease her about her weight? WTF. Don’t do shit like that. Also people don’t believe you about your gf for a second but keep trying I guess.
TheMarvelousMrsMaisel,fc9mw37,t1_fc6jsba,1577555073.0,Same! I was like “walk it back Midge!! You’ve gone too far!” Such a cringe set.
AmItheAsshole,fc7dmx6,t3_egipt0,1577504332.0,Where’s the Justified Asshole judgement we need?! ESH but she had it coming. I imagine you said it in the heat of the moment.
careerguidance,fc71jdi,t3_egcnqr,1577495059.0,"I was going to tell you to not feel guilty and just do what’s best for you because that’s how a company (and non-profit) would act. I’ve worked in non-profits for a while and they can be just as cut throat as corporations, they just don’t pay well. Do what is best for you and your life. Honestly I’ll likely be leaving the industry too, it’s not worth it anymore."

AmItheAsshole,fc05tyb,t1_fbzlmcq,1577279901.0,"This needs to be higher up. OP has some major stuff to work out here. If people find out there was cheating in a relationship that reflects very badly on the cheater, not the person cheated on. It’s strange to me how strongly OP feels that they’ve been emasculated. That’s a strong reaction but one that probably comes from something OP needs to look into."
