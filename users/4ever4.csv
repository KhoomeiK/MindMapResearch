Breadit,fema2pe,t1_feku3mz,1579245465.0,Or Germany. We eat a lot of bread as well.
mildlyinteresting,fdxqrrj,t1_fdx9min,1578771948.0,Here are a few types explained:  [http://www.germanfoodguide.com/flours.cfm](http://www.germanfoodguide.com/flours.cfm)
CrossStitch,fduii7o,t1_fdtovii,1578733550.0,"Umm no. When a project says 2 strands it's not 2 strands folded on themselves, it's 2 strands total. You obviously can do whatever you want but don't mislead beginners by saying that."
todayilearned,fdqhmpn,t1_fdqg6he,1578666890.0,Exactly!! 100% the truth.
todayilearned,fdqhd6u,t1_fdq44mh,1578666701.0,"12? Easy, French has 23!!!"
todayilearned,fdq4g95,t1_fdq3t4b,1578654384.0,"Silent letters? French would like to have a word.

Yeah that phrase is not hard, sorry."
todayilearned,fdq458s,t1_fdq2jm3,1578653965.0,"I haven't laughed this hard in a while, thanks! By the way, you pronounce the p in pneu.... I'm not going into detail about the other words because I have shit to do."
todayilearned,fdq1v1n,t1_fdq1ivh,1578650736.0,English people think they know French and then they open their mouths and it's incomprehensible.
todayilearned,fdq1nga,t1_fdq0gww,1578650432.0,"I'm going to have to respectfully disagree with that. Do you speak French? If not, how do you pronounce:

\- dessus 

\- doigt 

\- écureuil 

\- Rouen 

 \-bouilloire  

\-pneu

yeah..."
todayilearned,fdpypse,t1_fdpyn3z,1578646317.0,Cool! I met a few Estonians here in Germany and they spoke the language fluently.
todayilearned,fdpym9i,t1_fdpycja,1578646187.0,Lucky you! Are you from the Netherlands?
todayilearned,fdpvkbu,t1_fdpu187,1578642271.0,"> Languages such as Spanish and French are WAY more consistent rules-wise when it comes to those things (pronunciation). 

I don't know about Spanish because it's been a while since I learned it and I have lost most of it but the irregularities in the pronunciation of French words is the number one complaint I have heard about learning French since not all letters are pronounced and it's not consistent. There are a lot of exceptions in the grammar and our words are gendered... I could go on.

> American English is often spoken from different parts of the mouth, throat, and nose than French is and as an adult it was very difficult to try and train myself to pronounce correctly. 

Yes but this can be said of every language. German is a very guttural language and as a French/English speaker that is very hard to master.

Anyway let's just agree that learning a second/third/forth language as an adult is very difficult (for most) but it's really great when you get to exchange with different people in their mother tongue!"
todayilearned,fdptf57,t1_fdpsepe,1578639767.0,"English is one of the easiest, if not the easiest language to learn as a second language. My mother tongue is French (French-Canadian) and I learned English in school and by watching American TV. I've been learning German for the last 4 years and let me tell you, THAT is a hard language compared to English. I'm also very happy French is my mother tongue because I wouldn't want to learn it as a second language."
AskReddit,fd3tfnq,t1_fd2p9cf,1578161479.0,I'm reading your post and this describes Germany for me. I moved there from Canada and I feel just like you but towards Germany. I don't hate it here but the rose colored glasses are definitely off at this point.
AskReddit,fd3ju57,t1_fd2uqq0,1578159008.0,You couldn't be more wrong about the French hating French Canadians. They love them in fact.

Sorry, I can't help myself

E: I guess you people don't like to learn how to write foreign words correctly. Sigh"
Pets,fbzxyiz,t1_fbzx7m9,1577267763.0,The best food for a cat is the one he wants to eat.
Pets,fbzp39b,t1_fbzcv88,1577254716.0,Cats don't NEED wet food as evidenced by my (healthy) cat who literally pukes at the smell of wet food and only eats kibble. Stop with the blanket statements.
AskReddit,fbx7hm8,t1_fbwr1fp,1577172781.0,Yeah me too... He's the same age as my cat.
