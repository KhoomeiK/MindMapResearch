Hagans 87

Maxey 79

Quickley 78

Richards 84

EJ 74

Sestina 72

Brooks 72

Whitney 69

I think that’s much more fair. I rate our 3 guard lineup really high but I truly think they are the best trio in the country. Nick is also playing like a top 10 center so I think 84 is great for him. EJ is too inconsistent but has high potential. Nate is too bad on defense, Brooks has potential but still raw, Whitney just not doing much well right now but I guess high potential."
