fatlogic,ff8jqbb,t3_erxxgo,1579681714.0,I don't see how not taking your t-shirt off has anything to do with FA? I just don't get it.
flexibility,ff47nme,t3_er9546,1579557323.0,Is there a recommended length of time to do the beginner routine before you see results?  30 days? 60 days? Or do you just keep going until you feel improvement?
xxfitness,ff46tow,t3_ergy08,1579556807.0,"My core is very weak. I end up compensating with my shoulders, upper back and lower back when trying to do core exercises. What can I do that's low impact core work that will strengthen my core without giving me the chance to compensate with my back and shoulders?"

LoseitChallenges,feevtvf,t3_ejfi87,1579042306.0,"35/female/UK here. Three years ago I went from 14 stone 10 pounds to 12 stone 2 (206lb to 170lb). However , a bout of depression earlier this year meant I have regained up to 193lb. I've started eating well again, started going to the gym again, got back on antidepressants (again), and I've cut out alcohol.   The empty calories are a waste, my skin is better, and although I don't get real hangovers, I hate how groggy I feel in the morning after a drink. I'm using this challenge to kick-start my weightloss and health regain. 10 years ago I weighed 10 stone 7lb and had a 5k PB of 25:20. By the end of the year I'd like to beat it and reach my goal of 9 stone 7lb."
LoseitChallenges,feev4u2,t3_emrspk,1579041880.0,"Went to the gym Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I did one spinning class and one strength class and 20 minutes on the elliptical. So, yesterday and today were yoga to relax and stretch. Tomorrow I'm going to a spinning class. I'm traveling with work for the rest of the week. Fortunately the hotels have gyms so I have already packed my gym stuff into my bag and I'm going to go to the gym while travelling."

blogsnark,fdl7eid,t3_elx4w9,1578518309.0,"There's loads of rumours that Prince Charles wants to trim the official royal family who receive money from the Civil List and carry out royal duties to the ruler and immediate heirs and cut out the siblings of the heirs and their offspring (most notably Prince Andrew's children). So, Harry's official position would be cut when Prince Charles ascends to the throne as it'll be limited to the king and queen and Kate and William and their children. I wonder if he's taking the initiative and is bowing out early since it's rumoured that it's what he wants anyway. Edit: I stand corrected."
study,fdkl146,t3_elpq9g,1578505755.0,If there is a syllabus and grade guide read them thoroughly and use it as a revision checklist. Go through every topic on the syllabus and try to recall the relevant information relating to the topic.
ENFP,fd92jzo,t3_ejsgs0,1578227442.0,"Yeah, a bit disappointed too. I love making connections and exploring new, interesting films/movies/tv shows/podcasts that my friends recommend. I feel a bit hurt when they dismiss something I recommend out of hand."
antiMLM,fd8xjut,t3_eii7ip,1578224951.0,"I have a pushy acquaintance (""Sue""). She was doing the Body Shop at Home MLM. I went to one party where another acquaintance (""Mary"") had bought loads of food and got the dubious reward of having a facial in front of 10 other women and a free gift. I bought a few things because Body Shop stuff is nice and decided not to go again. 

A few months later Sue messaged me inviting me to another party. I just ignored her message. THEN Mary messaged me to invite me. I knew Mary better so I just said no thanks. She said I could re-stock on the stuff I bought. I told her it hadn't run out. She said Christmas was coming up so I could buy presents for my family instead. How incredibly rude! What is it about MLMs that brings out the worst in people and their friends?

Anyway, Sue recently posted on Facebook that she was ""Moving on"" from the MLM. Thank god."
Lovecraft,fd30sl0,t3_ejvmza,1578153682.0,"I LOVE this podcast. I joined the subreddit to post about it because I thought you would love it. 

My husband put it on when we were on a car journey. I wasn't paying attention to the beginning and missed the title of the podcast. We love listening to Serial, Dan Carlin and other podcasts. I genuinely thought it was another true crime podcast (although I was a bit confused as to why the BBC was delving into true crime podcasts but whatever). At the end of the first episode I finally realised it was based on the Cthulu mythos and I was blown away.

The acting sounds so naturalistic it sounds like a well-produced podcast. The production and use of experts and witnesses to tell the story is just like a true crime podcast. It is creepy, confusing, you can hear the presenters getting slightly madder by the episode. Haven't finished listening yet but it is fantastic so far."
unitedkingdom,fd206nh,t1_fd1v4q4,1578139591.0,"Pretty much, yeah. This type of poor reporting of legal cases really irritates me. The key issue is whether the guy's dismissal was lawful or not."
uklaw,fc53dmt,t3_eg3afc,1577441053.0,"You'll need to remember a lot of cases and legislation. However, it's worth thinking about it as not rote memorisation, but understanding.  If you understand how the area of law all fits together you won't really need to memorise them."
