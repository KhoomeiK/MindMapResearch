cats,fegxyuz,t3_ep0uzv,1579105021.0,I'm so sorry for your loss. I lost my 16-year-old cat two weeks ago and it was way harder then I thought it would be. I'm sure she brought you so much joy and good times. Remember those and remember her. Time will ease the pain‚ù§Ô∏è
AskReddit,fdnfmnc,t3_em2vfz,1578584779.0,"Apparently my mom had a bunch of weird rules, but here are the two main ones that people usually say ‚Äòwhat‚Äô to.

Having to walk back up/down the stairs if I‚Äôd made too much noise at my first attempt. I‚Äôm now a pro at running in the stairs without making any sound.

Couldn‚Äôt watch a bunch of tv shows because they were too ""dumb"" (primarily The Simpsons)."

Before him, I‚Äôd met another guy who I am still friends with. So yeah, pretty good experience overall I have to say!"

ptsd,fcl7vei,t1_fcl39tq,1577741710.0,"Hey! First, I'm sorry your PTSD has gotten bad again and I hope you'll find a way to make it better soon. Now, to answer your questions I did CBT and with the help of that I did exposure therapy. It started with very baby steps and since I wasn't driving yet, it was done with the help of my mom and my sister who both had their licenses.

At first, during therapy, I started by just talking about everything that scared me or triggered a panic attack. We basically rationalised all my fears, you know typical CBT. Then we started watching car accidents on Youtube. Nothing big, just crashes that caused no harm to people. My therapist would ask me after each video if it had scared me and when I said yes, she'd play it again until it didn't bother me anymore. We slowly moved on to bigger/worse car accidents when the time was right. This is still something I do from time to time because it was surprisingly helpful. 

Then came the actual exposure therapy. I mentioned that I was scared on the sidewalk and because of that I would usually walk on the grass by the sidewalk. So my first goal was to walk in the middle of the sidewalk. Once that was achieved, I slowly started driving places with my mom or my sister. First, it was just going around in my neighbourhood, then on the boulevard, then the high-speed roads and finally the highway. Some of my therapy involved naming streets/areas that were worse and going on them repeatedly to show my brain they weren't more dangerous than anywhere else. 

So yeah, my advice is to basically try to slowly start driving again. Start with areas you know well and aren't dangerous at all and slowly move on to bigger/faster roads. If you can and find it somewhat better, let someone else drive and just sit in the car with them. That's how it all started with me since I legally couldn't drive and I think it was better than just putting the steering wheel between my hands. 

Good luck with everything!"
ptsd,fckrasd,t3_ehoasx,1577731494.0,"My PTSD (car accident) got way worse over time before I started seeing a therapist (was 8 at the time of the accident, started therapy at 17, wouldn't recommend waiting so long). It started by just being slightly uncomfortable while being in a car to nearly not being able to walk on the sidewalk when there were cars on the road. Add to that the usual nightmares and irrational fear that everyone I knew would die in car crashes. When I finally started seeing a therapist, it gradually started getting better to the point that 5 years later I can now drive a car and I haven't had a panic attack in months. I never thought it would get better and it still isn't perfect, but with time it gets manageable. 

It takes time, it might affect you your whole life, but there are ways to make this better. Getting a therapist can be expensive and might not be something you can afford at the moment but try talking about it with people in your life. It helped me to open up about my PTSD and I'm pretty sure it played a role in my recovery.

Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è"
