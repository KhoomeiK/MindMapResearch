As someone who is far from having my life 'together' I was also thinking of building a 'standardized list' that I would call 'The Platform', or 'The Foundation'. Of course, as many on the thread have pointed out, people's individual life situations can vary a lot, so depending on their needs and priorities the list could vary wildly.  For example in my case, being able to keep \*any\* job - not necessarily a 'high paying one' would be part of the list, or having excellent command of the local language - since I live in a foreign country in the language of which I am only semi fluent/"

He'd probably facepalm hard and say 'WTF man you are telling me that all the hard work I'm putting in right now is for \*nothing\*?! You were supposed to be a world class scientist, not an unemployed incel loser who could barely finish university after a billion years and gets kicked from every single job. Sheesh. What a f-ing waste. Might as well enjoy the 90s while they last."""
history,ff3qci6,t3_er6d3b,1579546574.0,"Nowadays in Greek schools, the history of Byzantium is taught extensively because emphasis is being placed on the historical and linguistic continuity that brought us all the way from ancient Greece to today. I believe this is partly a reaction to 'attacks' in the 19th century by various western European historians who surmised that the modern population of Greece is genetically completely unrelated to the Greeks of the golden age because of all the 'admixture and conquering that took place in the meanwhile'. 

An any account, and despite the fact that they were majority Greek speaking, byzantines called themselves 'Romans'. Greek national identity was something that was partially constructed in the 19th century to unite the then fledgling nation of Greece."

history,fdz8ohv,t3_enbcqb,1578787765.0,I'm not sure about PhD students but if you study the biographies of famous scientists around the turn of the 20th century you'll find that most of them had at least passive understanding of several languages. I'd say that if you were a research scientist around 1900 and didn't read English French and German at the minimum you'd have been seriously disadvantaged

Unfortunately, this addiction to information can be very strong in some people and already manifested itself way before smartphones and wikipedia made access instantaneous. I remember myself as a young kid in primary school ca 1992, just flinging up printed encyclopedia volumes and reading random stuff..and it was engrossing. You can only imagine what happened when I got on the intarwebs :/"
