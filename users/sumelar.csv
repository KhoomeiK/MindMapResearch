The simple fact is, it is impossible to balance a given encounter for every possible build. Even balancing perfectly (or good enough) for every class is hard enough. The fact is, some builds are just better than others. If yours isn't working on a boss, respec and try something different.

No build is going to be great at every stage of the game. You might just have to do something different early on, or for a particular boss. It's just how games work."
