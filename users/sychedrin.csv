PS4,fc2pjtx,t3_efunc1,1577370165.0,The comments praising this game got me excited!
todayilearned,fbxgig6,t1_fbxgez7,1577186268.0,How are they frozen?  At -80c or colder?
todayilearned,fbxcknq,t1_fbx9x3s,1577180162.0,"Transfusion medicine can definitely be challenging and complicated, but of course it depends on what kind of hospital you work at.  I work at two, one is a trauma center and the other handles a lot of hematology/oncology patients.  The trauma center, while it can be very nerve-wracking is straightforward.  Hardly any antibodies show up in the patients that come in.  The other hospital is a different case; chronically transfused patient tend to develop antibodies and thus makes it harder to find compatible units.  Plus it's a hospital that receives the 'unsolved' cases from other hospitals so that's another headache sometimes.

As for the comment your teacher said... yea I don't know what they're talking about lol.  You're supposed to conserve O negative blood as much as possible for O negative patients.  I'd be fired instantly if I gave out my entire stock of O negatives to random routine patients.  Another way of looking at it is through population percentages.  Say 40% of the general population is O positive.  It's fair to say 40% of the hospital patient population is also O positive.  Thus a good inventory policy would be to stock 40% of your blood with O positives, and you try as much as possible to give group specific blood.  If you start giving everyone O negative 1) you don't have much O negative to begin with since like 5% of the population is O negative and 2) You'll run out of O negative blood for when a O negative patient needs blood."

As someone who works in blood bank having the ability to give compatible blood to a patient with a rare antibody is a blessing and I can tell you they would 100% appreciate your donation."
todayilearned,fbxazoh,t1_fbx29y2,1577177766.0,"Yes it's somewhat related.  Rh (which stands for rhesus) is a family of antigens.  There are 61 members (antigens) in this family, and everyone has a combination of those members present or not present on the surface of their red blood cells.

In your case, Rh negative refers to one particular member, named 'D', and the negative means you don't have D on your red blood cells.  All the other 60 may or may not be there as well.

Rh null refers to *all* 61 members not being present on the red blood cells, which as you can imagine is very rare."
todayilearned,fbxakm4,t1_fbwusrm,1577177143.0,"I work in a blood bank.  Common blood group are just as important as rare ones.  Here's the thing:  any good blood bank will follow a guideline of giving group *specific* blood to patients as much as possible, which means if the patient is A positive, they will receive A positive blood.  Giving group *compatible* blood (ie giving O negative blood to an A positive patient) is not done for routine transfusions.  Couple this with the fact that the percentages of what blood groups there are in the general population is pretty much the same as the population in hospitals, we use O positive and A positive blood more than anything else since they are the most common blood groups.  

TLDR the common blood groups are the ones transfused the most, so they are also valuable.  Regardless of your blood group we will use your donation!"
todayilearned,fbxa2l7,t1_fbx6397,1577176408.0,"I second this.  Not only for the points you mentioned, but platelet transfusions are generally more common than plasma transfusions, especially among cancer patients.  In fact currently at my work there is a kid who is undergoing a stem cell treatment, and during this treatment we try to give him AB platelets as much as possible.  Since they take platelets every day the kid pretty much depletes our stock of AB platelets all the time lol

But hey, no one at the hospital is going to say no to any blood component you can donate.  We use everything no matter the blood group.  At least where I work, we're pretty fanatical about keeping waste to a minimum."
todayilearned,fbx96uf,t1_fbx5y00,1577175139.0,"I work in blood bank and I appreciate your comment.

The one thing I want to add is the general perception that since O neg blood is the 'universal donor' we (the hospital) just give out O neg blood to anyone who needs it.  This is generally false.  

To manage our inventory properly, when we give blood to a patient it will 90% of the time be *group specific* blood.  Meaning if you are a A positive patient requiring blood, blood bank will issue A positive blood for you to receive.  Even though technically speaking O negative could be given, if I were to give O negative blood to an A positive patient I would possibly be depriving myself from giving that blood to another patient who is O negative, a blood group that can *only* receive O negative blood.

What about the other 10%?  Some examples:  Traumas that require urgent transfusions where no time can be allocated for type and screens will receive O negative blood.   Patients with known allo-antibodies to Rh or other antigen groups which you referred to may increase the chance of getting group *compatible* blood rather than group specific.  Lastly, a rule that is followed at my hospital, patient that require routine transfusions (such as thalassemia and sickle cell patients) will receive Rh specific group compatible blood as a preventative measure, regardless if the patient has allo-antibodies or not.

Edit:  Also if we have any O negative blood that is about to expire, we give it to an O positive patient so we don't waste it."
todayilearned,fbx873z,t1_fbx6guv,1577173739.0,"That's a pretty stressful situation. Given that it was a trauma, I suppose you had to get approval to give O neg blood?  What ended up happening?"
todayilearned,fbx82ty,t1_fbx4fh9,1577173578.0,"To piggyback here, red blood cells have a shelf life of 42 days when refrigerated"
todayilearned,fbx7qfw,t1_fbx6wr4,1577173111.0,"I work in blood bank.  For someone who is A neg, I'd say that a double red/platelet or whole blood donation is pretty equivalent tbh.  Whatever form you donate is appreciated."
todayilearned,fbx7id5,t1_fbx6fux,1577172811.0,"Red blood cell donations have a shelf life of 42 days when refrigerated.  You can't freeze them, as it would destroy the red blood cells through crystal formation.  I suppose you could cryo-freeze them like they do with stem cells but as far as I know it's not done.

Edit:  After scrolling through some of the comments here it seems like freezing red blood cells is an option, my bad!"
