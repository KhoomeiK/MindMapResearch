The single thing I am trying to get across here is that Christians are not responsible for the actions of their god.  Again, like I said, Christlike not God-like.  No Christian believes they can morally annihilate humanity in a flood just because God did it.  But they worship a god they believe did just that.  Does that make them culpable for the flood?  Are they hypocrites if they complain about refugees being drowned?  Of course not.  There's a reason the phrase ""God works in mysterious ways."" exists — the god of the Bible did some fucked up shit that's difficult to reconcile with the moral framework laid out in the Bible."

You want Christians to boycott God?  Try to get him to calm the fuck down?  If you genuinely believe God exists as described in the Bible, what is your remedy?  Keep in mind, if God doesn't like this remedy, he's going to torture you for eternity — so you had better hope this intervention goes well.  Hate to belabor the point here, but Christians are in kind of a tough spot with regard to God.  It's not like they can just make another one, or just pretend they believe in a god that didn't torture a devotee to win a bet with Satan.  They believe this happened, they believe this God exists, and they believe if they step out of line, he's coming for them next \(they usually don't phrase it this way\).

^\* The Old Testament is a bit fuzzy on this — the commandment Christians use to support monotheism was, in the original context, a commandment for the Jews to not worship other, non-Jew gods, which were specifically mentioned in the surrounding text.  Also of note, Moses flips his shit when he sees his followers have broken one of the commandments that he hadn't even fucking told them about yet."

At one point in the Bible, there were only 8 people on Earth who had not been slaughtered by God \(ignoring the time period where there were fewer than that many people who ever lived\).  He tortured one of his most devout followers just to prove a point. \(funny enough, you could interpret this story as Satan trying to tempt God into torturing a follower — and killing his family — and God giving in and doing it.\)  God turned a woman into a pillar of salt for a minor transgression.  God gets to do whatever he wants in Christianity \(and presumably Judaism and Islam\).  I don't think that Christians have any culpability in that.  They are taught to be Christlike, not God-like."
