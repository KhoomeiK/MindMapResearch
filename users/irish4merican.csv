Here's the question: have you spent the last 4 years depressed, or stable? Or both?"

Catholicism,ff1qg6z,t1_ff1m0kx,1579483904.0,"Sorry but ""it's just as bad everywhere else"" sounds very much like a downplaying of the issue posted about. I have every right to explain further.

FYI: telling someone to ""calm down"" will almost always garner the opposite reaction.

Catholicism,ff10xi7,t1_fezeql3,1579474143.0,"The diocese of crookston has all of those issues as well as the fact that the bishop is the first to be under investigation under the Vos Estis policy created by Pope Francis. The diocese settled $5 million recently for +Hoeppner's cover ups and lies and he is seen *laughing* in the deposition, which has been posted online. Along with his cover ups the diocese does not have ""lax liturgical"" culture but rather *enforced* liturgical abuse and irreverence re: my comments on other posts about being screamed at for wearing a veil and being banned from kneeling during parts of the Mass including during the reception of the Eucharist. Bells at Mass are banned, priests are banned from celebrating ad orientem, etc. 
Fr. Bryan Kujawa speaks for truth and is being punished for it along with his brother priest Fr. Craig Vasek. In any case whether or not other dioceses have difficulties doesn't change that this one needs prayer.
Crookston is no longer my diocese as I have moved across the river into a diocese with TLM Mass and holy priests all over. But this still matters a lot to me."
prolife,feysn4z,t3_eqvu1z,1579450114.0,"I had a ""pregnancy scare"" as an unmarried, non-religious sophomore in college and I still never considered abortion an option. She definitely wasn't all that pro-life if all it took was a week of no menstruation to change her mind."
Catholicism,feyjsul,t1_feyivf3,1579446461.0,"Yes I'm hoping the Vos Estis investigation is completed soon, that he is removed and a holy bishop takes his place. Fr. Kujawa is a friend of mine and he has suffered greatly under this bishop, along with any of the orthodox priests in the diocese. Fr. Vasek's move to the diocese of Bismarck was a true Godsend. 
The faithful in Bemidji are especially in need of prayer right now."
