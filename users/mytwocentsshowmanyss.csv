history,ff6vy19,t1_ff5w1ew,1579635994.0,"Dont the Welsh have the closest connection the the original Britons though as well? I think it's really interesting that they associate with pre-Anglo-Saxon Britain and post- (meaning the Roman invasions), but not the Saxons themselves."
history,ff6vf5x,t3_erojdm,1579635686.0,"As to the reasons why, it sort of fit into the Roman philosophy of expanding borders as far as possible and committing whatever evils are necessary for the long term survival of the human race. There was also a sort of ""so we could say we went there.""

Despite suffering heavy casualties and gaining nothing of material significance, Caesar declared his invasion of Brittania a success, and the Roman public largely agreed, simply because they had set foot where no Roman had before."

It's almost like you hang out with your local booth daily/weekly, but Buck only comes over on Thanksgiving and new years, so we never get as attached to him and we're never really meant to. He's good for what his job is, and we can say that and still not want him to be our local guy."
sports,fd89jsx,t3_ek5tc4,1578215496.0,"Does anyone else think the second defender to touch Watson was afraid to hit him because of the new roughing the passer rules? Looks like he thought the first guy had Watson wrapped up, so he diverted to make minimal contact rather than risk unnecessary roughness, which is ultimately what allowed Watson to escape. I just dont see how two linebackers get their hands on him and dont bring him down otherwise."
news,fctgqp6,t1_fctfp43,1577942740.0,"That's incredibly helpful, thank you. When I saw ""mass shootings"" my mind definitely jumped to things like schools, Vegas and so on, i.e. ""active shooter events."" I sorta suspected these would fall under your implied category of ""not motivated by economic insecurity,"" but i got thrown off by ""mass shooter"" before you taught me the legal jargon.

I'm glad I learned that little bit of semantics so I can call them what they are. Seems pretty important if we want to discuss motives."
news,fctenm3,t1_fctc2xd,1577940837.0,"I can definitely see this regarding most gun crimes, but I'm struggling to understand how mass shootings are connected to gangs, drugs, or other problems caused by economic insecurity. I dont mean to sound course, but it isn't profitable to shoot up a school, so I'm wondering what the relationship is between mass shootings and crime rooted in economic insecurity?"

coys,fcajf1g,t1_fca2t0c,1577570333.0,"I'm not the most knowledgeable but it appears to be a sort of feedback loop/vicious cycle, beginning with the messaging about Eriksen' departure, so fans are tougher on him and less invested in him, so Eriksen drifts further away, so fans keep pushing him away, etc.

The reality though seems to be that fans would love to see him stay and be happy with the club, and we're bitter that he doesnt want to."

worldnews,fca2r2f,t1_fc9yjt6,1577562217.0,"I understood the bulk of what you wrote. I just found the last sentence confusing, when you wrote, ""if you cannot 'police' for free, you are not free to stop choosing violence. I was hoping you could clarify that specifically.""

To your last point though, I think I understand where you're coming from in the sense that even so-called ""good cops"" are complicit in a broken criminal justice system. But I also feel the way you worded it places too much blame on the individual supposedly ""good cops."" I dont think those individuals actively place oppressed people in cycles of criminal activity (and poverty I would add), and I think that applies more to politicians and overtly ""bad cops."" I'd be more comfortable saying that it's the professional responsibility of police to do that (not that that's so much better), but the financial responsibility has more to do with the prison industry and its cronies.

I should acknowledge though my privilege of being white and not having directly experienced oppression from police officers."
