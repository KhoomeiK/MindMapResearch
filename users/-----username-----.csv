Siri,ffa6mkc,t3_eshwij,1579728900.0,"Why is Siri so hard to use? It seems like outside of ""set a timer for me"" most people can't get Siri to do what they want. 

An example: I ask Siri to call my wife. She literally says, ""Which wife?"" and displays my wife's contact card, and my brother's. This problem has existed since Siri was first released as a part of iOS.

A lot of people who used Siri as an independent app before Apple bought it said it actually did more than it does now. What's the deal?!"
