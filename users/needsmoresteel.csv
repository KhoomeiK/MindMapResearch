politics,ff7u36r,t1_ff76mo1,1579658388.0,"Nobody has to convince you. This is completely a show trial because the entire GOP party  has already been blackmailed, I mean, convinced."
politics,ff7tklf,t1_ff6ev5c,1579658031.0,"With no shred of evidence, doesn’t it seem like this is yet another attempt by certain groups to sow discord? This might be the strongest indicator yet that Bernie is solidly the Dem front runner and a lot of people with money and power are getting scared."
politics,ff55mma,t3_erkmrc,1579580904.0,"Oddly enough, it makes a difference which political party the president belongs to as whether a crime needs to be committed other not."

politics,felrb75,t1_fell77h,1579229026.0,Because it wasn’t invented in the United States it can’t be good - I’m sure a lot of Americans believe that.

politics,felhn3u,t1_fekzmvf,1579222390.0,I don’t recall if I read this at that time.  But I would not have considered it to be absurdly alarmist then. Or even simply alarmist.  It doesn’t take much brain power to see where the erosion of decency and doing what is right for most leads to.  Still not alarmist and most people just shrug their shoulders.

politics,fefehca,t1_fef2rgr,1579054599.0,Never would have thought “going through some things” could have credibly meant getting killed by your own government.  It’s too bad people have already dug in and won’t be changing their minds about how important it is to get Pompeo and the others to testify under oath.
politics,fefe2s2,t1_fef0oj8,1579054344.0,"That about page is a pack of lies.  But I guess it sounds better then the truth - in it for the sweet, sweet graft and being one of Trumps water carriers."

politics,fdr2grn,t3_emnd02,1578678609.0,This is akin to the school bully demanding student of the year awards because after having threatened nearly everybody in the school he didn’t actually beat anybody up that badly.

politics,fdim8yx,t3_elign2,1578446048.0,Likely only a moral victory.  They’ll appeal and otherwise drag the process out and basically screw over the plaintiffs.

politics,fcja9i0,t1_fcid2xc,1577681190.0,Don’t forget the rampant cyber bullying. I know this seems small in comparison but it gives so many people permission to do the same.
politics,fci6b4l,t1_fchytrj,1577658260.0,"Also, the so-called Socialist candidates, Sanders and Warren, who actually represent the middle which happens to be a very large demographic. The remainder pretty much represent the elites."
IAmA,fcgx4mo,t1_fcgrky1,1577644948.0,"If you can’t do it in one sitting (in reviewing the booklet, I couldn’t do that), do it in chunks. With things like this I find it useful,to do a little at a time and frequently go back to revise and add until I’m reasonably happy with it."
