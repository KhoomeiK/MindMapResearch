guns,fdn3bcx,t1_fdn33vl,1578576042.0,"Yes. The only drawback I have is how far the trigger has to be pulled, and the reset is almost all the way back. But you can easily figure it out and shoot fast. It’s heavy, and felt great when shooting."

AskReddit,fbxd6hr,t3_eetf7i,1577181099.0,"Stole a palm tree once. There was a palm tree nursery down the street from my house and my best friends house. His mom gave us money for to go buy one. We bought weed instead and went and stole the tree at like 2 am. We had a phone call going so we could keep contact. I jumped out the bed of the truck with friend B. Friend A drives down the street and makes a u turn when we tell him we have it. Throw it in the bed of the truck and drive home. 

Also stole antique farm equipment once. That was difficult. And we gave it to my friends dad for Christmas. 

I was a bad kid I think."
