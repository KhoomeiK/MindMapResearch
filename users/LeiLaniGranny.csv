Someone is going to have to change. From the way you spoke in your post you have a great head on your shoulders. Being a bit rebellious since they aren't hearing you. 
Try new approaches to see if you can figure a way to communicate with them better. Try a journal speaking your feelings and hiding it were mom will find it. Try doing things around the house without being told to. Show them with action your becoming a man. No ones perfect ever so hang in there and be the person you are. Good luck."

cats,fey2rq4,t3_eqw1hx,1579439997.0,Since the cat is a stray it's used to peeing anywhere. Don't get a fancy litter box just a small tub and once set up close off your bedroom. It will take time to teach to use box. Some cat's never stop peeing on clothing though. Take to a vet for a once over to be sure there's no urinary infection. Good luck.

secretsanta,fep0a4l,t1_fenv0ai,1579309265.0,"Nope not insulting. I painted years ago using oils, acrylics & pastels. Have painted abstract, landscapes, animals and my daughter. Painting is relaxing and sometimes frustrating because you have a vision but become so obsessive about it being perfect you lose the vision. Looking at it through a mirror reverses the image and helps. Never meant offense."
secretsanta,fenmnbd,t3_eq4qum,1579287946.0,If you find yourself stumped or need perspective look at your painting through a mirror. It gives you the image we see not what your seeing. Hope that makes sense too lol. Have fun!!!

cats,feigsgv,t3_epbph4,1579138181.0,I agree the cat is now scared but feeling safe all at same time. He doesn't know or trust them yet. Get play toys and play with the cat. Sit near him while feeding so he smells you all. Get a climb up tree or put shelves on wall in stair form so he can get up high to feel safe. It takes time....hang in there
