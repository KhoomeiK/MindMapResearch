TrueOffMyChest,femehem,t1_femdg28,1579251298.0,"I just wish that the 10 years friendship will make slightly different and maybe she will come back to her sense soon and realized bout how much effort i have done cause i cherished the friendship. But I guess you were right, i should let it go.. she basically isn't there for me and  don't start conversations or offer to hang out with me if i dont initiate.. I dont even know why am i holding onto this friendship that i practically saw it coming to this way. Guess i just lost 2 of my only best friends on 2019 and 2020 :(

Now I dont even know what am i suppose to do with the flight ticket for June and September that i bought with her. Any idea? I basically save up for 2 years for this vacation."
TrueOffMyChest,femdsah,t1_femcsny,1579250311.0,"I just dont understand why she treat me like that. I mean like after all we are friend for 10 years, why couldnt she be more honest instead of make up story and giving me fake hope.. Then she come back pretending like nothing ever happen :("

AskReddit,fdgbtft,t1_fde4b6l,1578389087.0,Same. was thinking to stay for another 1 or 2 months to save some money before i left this shit behind. Had enough of my boss of creating the toxic environment while being biased. Its basically drain me up till the moment i was crying at toilet.

dating_advice,fcwucle,t1_fcwppxr,1578037970.0,I was practically busy on weekday and sometimes on weekend(busy season at work) for December and he was busy on weekend. Its just hard to find the right time. So should i try and ask him out since its not busy season yet for now or just let him go?
AskReddit,fcwpt9k,t3_ej6n4u,1578032956.0,Stop letting other people's opinion control you. Stop cutting people out just bcs you feel you're not good enough for them. Stay happy please.
dating_advice,fcwnoxn,t1_fcwl895,1578030888.0,But i tried to make it up for it. I even cancelled all my NYE plan to hang out with him and he know that. Isn't it a bit immature to get back to me.
dating_advice,fcwjwna,t1_fcwhcce,1578027636.0,"Its not like my intention to decline, its more like unavoidable situation."
dating_advice,fcwjpk7,t1_fcwh835,1578027479.0,I ended up overthink the whole situation and unable to sleep for several days.. The least he couldve done was telling me what's with the sudden change. He's basically the 1st person i talked with through online..

AskReddit,fctcm3d,t1_fct8gz0,1577939066.0,hahaha im still waiting for people to share it. Im basically drown myself in work on weekday and im just 23
AskReddit,fctcbh7,t1_fctbi4v,1577938817.0,ikr. I barely have any energy left either after work and the commute back from work is basically time consuming. Sometimes the only reason for me to wait for Friday to come was mainly to get enough rest instead of going somewhere.
socialskills,fct9vhn,t3_eisnxh,1577936792.0,"IMO thats crazy. Get yourself out from that friendship! There's still a lots of people out there that worth your kindness act. I know its hard to decline your friend but its time for you to said no for his request.

Cheer up and happy 2020 =)"
AskReddit,fct73w0,t1_fcse9pq,1577934612.0,"> Even if you work a 9-5 workday, don't always yearn for that next friday.

CasualConversation,fct3tae,t3_eieq14,1577932152.0,"Basically what im planning to do! Although i just move to a new state for about a year now but i wanna try out different place again. My family called me crazy for those decision and my friends said what triggered or make me dare to do that. I guess what i could said is Life is too short to settle down without even trying new things. My life have been like a routine now, this is what i shouldve at the age of 50 and not early 20. This is just my perspective =)"
selfimprovement,fct3585,t3_eigcl9,1577931656.0,"Yeah ikr, cut those who take us for granted. Ive cut 1 people in 2019, its hard but i know i'll get used to it as time goes by. 

it was basically my close best friend which i dont wanna lose if possible but then one day i realized i had enough of it. She tends to say quite hurtful words and comment, bailed on me last minute(countless) and even jokingly comparing me with her current colleagues. I always tried to be understandable but its hurt me mentally, it hurt. I've confront her bout it but she never feel sorry at all, she never apologized for any of her action. She rather stop talking and wait till i make the 1st move. I realized i worth more than this toxic friendship so i let her go."
selfimprovement,fct104x,t3_eim6ks,1577930078.0,Goodluck for it. Let 2020 be your year
selfimprovement,fct05wr,t1_fcmginh,1577929469.0,"its ok. 2020 is a new year new journey, hopefully we never repeat the same mistake ever again. Let the one that got away be our lesson but she still waiting for you, grab the chance and try your best

selfimprovement,fcm4dhc,t3_ehqza6,1577763928.0,"we always thought we had the time but we dont. Its not us who control it. I was facing the same things as you, trying to put people aside caused im not good enough for them and always thought we could have them back when we are better. Sometimes if its your luck then they might still be there, but most of the time, they are not. What i experienced is that people move on when they are fed up of waiting for too long."
socialskills,fclzpe1,t1_fclrdzy,1577760464.0,But it seriously tiring when its always you the person that initiate for every conversation.

AskReddit,fcj78iu,t3_ehf10c,1577679005.0,"Back then when i was outstation and had to stay in a 2 room with a living room condominium for a month. Every night there is a loud squeaky slipper sound in the living room but i dont really care caused i thought it might be my other colleague who went to washroom(the washroom was next to living room). After like 3rd week of stayed there, my colleague who's stayed the same unit asked me ""you do go to toilet quite often at night, dont you?"" and from that moment i knw that the squeaky slipper sound was not her... That night i walked pass the living room to go to the toilet and there is a sound of squeaky slipper again but there's no one in the living room. I braces myself and stare at the living room for like 5\~10 minute to find out where the sound might cme from but couldnt.

I end up sleeping with earphone for 1 weeks plus until we return home.."
selfimprovement,fcj3uo0,t3_ehcxm6,1577676602.0,"Go for it :) Its might be scary at first as it is out of your comfort zone but its gonna be worth it to explore new things while we are young. Its only matter of time for you to be adjust with the new environment. Just grit your teeth and u will go through it. Believe me.

I moved to a new state for my first full time job right after my bachelor too. Although you might need put some effort or else you will just stuck in the same situation as you were back in your home.

Its just my opinion tho. What's truly matter is yours :)"
