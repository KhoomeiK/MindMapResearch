Been GM every season from beginning of game until now almost exclusively playing dps (soldier/mccree)and almost exclusively doom since he's been out.

I'm just gonna say it.  Doom is busted as fuck and I love it.  The tweaks they've made intended to incrementally nerf him are nearly irrelevant when you are good at tracking cooldowns, and consistently focus on punishing out of position/low hp targets and knowing when to immediately get out if I can't secure a kill on the spot.

I was terrified when they mentioned hero bans because I'm pretty sure doom will be near the top of that list.

Thanks Jeff, I will continue to play this broken character until you start listening to player feedback instead of relying on a spreadsheet, swearing all along the data says there's nothing wrong."
