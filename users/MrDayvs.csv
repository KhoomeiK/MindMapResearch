PS4,feht6xk,t1_feenant,1579123383.0,Though it seems unlikely due to the success of their multi-platform games like dark souls 3 and Sekiro. They have made much more money on those.
PS4,fehr1sh,t1_fehij4k,1579122171.0,"Because PS4‚Äôs power is hilariously underpowered this point, Have you played RDR2 on it? The fan sounds line a jet engine on take of, the only console that runs that game well is the Xbox One X, and the same will go for Cyberpunk 2077 :/"

pcgaming,fdmaio2,t1_fdm96xt,1578543947.0,"You don‚Äôt understand the whole cost/price concept do you? As more cores and more power the put on to something it is obviously more expensive to create, if that where the case (what you are saying) then there would all ready a company doing it. Intel was once developing gr√°fica cards but not for comercial purposes and they didn‚Äôt went ahead and compete with Nvidia because they didn‚Äôt figure out a way to beat them."

dating_advice,fdhs28d,t1_fdgntx6,1578429077.0,How is asking out someone sexual harassment?
dating_advice,fdhryj5,t1_fdemwqj,1578429019.0,"Thanks that is great advice, now that you mention it I don't usually ask out women right away, and yes it would be a bit odd to do it. How ever I do have another question (and maybe this might be me other-thinking this but what ever) I was thinking that when she asks what is my age I tell her something like: Am 25, I assume you are 25 too right?, giving me opportunity to complement her when she corrects me, and then tease her in a joking/playful manner like telling her: You know usually when women lie about their age, they say they are younger.... I think you are doing it wrong. You know something like that. Now I worry a bit that saying something like that would make me look like immature or that I am trying too hard. What do you think? Would it be better to just be real with her, talk to her normal and mature all time?"

Rumor has it that she is divorced (and has been for a while) I kinda talk to her, like I greet her and casually ask her somethings to in√≠ciate conversation with her, but if I were to ask her out where should I take her? I mean it‚Äôs a bit different given the circumstances, I am generally not shy or anything around girls but, what would be a good place or way to ask her out in a way that I don‚Äôt freak her out but also making my intentions kinda clear?"
