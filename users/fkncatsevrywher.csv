A safe place for the folks who always seem to have their sh!t together, to share stories about the inner chaos they deal with on a regular basis, and the toll it takes on maintaining the appearance of StaBiliTy."

childfree,fdr82i1,t1_fdqo84n,1578680732.0,"This past Christmas stirred up some repressed childhood memories for DH, and I honestly had no idea how rough he had it. He is a numbers guy, who grew up in a die-hard blue collar family. Not only was he discouraged from going to college (they considered a degree ""worthless""), he was criticized for not being mechanical or good with his hands. We are middle aged, folks, and the pain STILL hurts him. It is asinine to assume your children will be just like you."

childfree,fdev0au,t1_fdebf45,1578347170.0,"My cousin owns a pet supply store, and received her first (and only) 1-star review from a customer who got mad when my cousin got tired of walking around and picking up the toys, etc left behind by her unwatched children, and politely asked them to stop. She was so upset about that review, because the woman grossly exaggerated the situation, and implied that ""loyal customers"" and their children are treated with hostility. What a bitch! My cousin works hard and makes many sacrifices for her business to be successful, so it was difficult to not take it personally. Thankfully, that review got buried under the 4 and 5 star reviews she rightfully deserves."
