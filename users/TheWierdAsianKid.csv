I pressed where I shouldn't have; it's the 'hook' that holds the whole front of the foot onto the rest of the leg. [Pic 1](https://i.imgur.com/ID3k7K4.jpg), [Pic 2](https://i.imgur.com/WG903Mo.jpg). Hopefully you can see it in the picture. I kind of pressed it back into shape and I know I stressed it more but at least it kind of holds onto the foot. Before, it didn't hold at all.

Besides gluing it on which I don't want to do is there anything I can do to make that hook keep it's shape and not loosen up?"

buildapc,fczvpmw,t3_ejem1h,1578109419.0,"I got my first PC built with a lot of help from my brother during Christmas. He gave me a lot of parts from his old computer after heavily upgrading and gifted me some nice ones for Christmas. most notably was his old graphics card, but he bought me a really nice motherboard and CPU. I'm just getting into games and had a huge issue with DiRT 4. It constantly lagged and dropped frames, although it was the worst when loading into a new race (the cut scene of your car pulling up to the line and a few seconds during the start). It would also lag when the car was going fast and under heavy braking, and during any collision. I also had an issue with Euro Truck sim 2 that when going highway speeds the game would consistently slow every 2 seconds. The only other game I have played is Halo Reach and that performed just fine on high settings. 

I've listed the userbenchmark scores I got below. Would all of these issues stem from the older graphics card? If so could anyone recommend a decent upgrade in the ~$500 range? 

UserBenchmarks: Game 57%, Desk 94%, Work 75%

CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600 - 90.2%

GPU: Nvidia GTX 1060-6GB - 53.8%

educationalgifs,fc2q13a,t1_fc2h68t,1577370601.0,"I teach my kids gear ratios with a simple phrase ""big to small"". Just like on a bike with multiple gears if the powered gear is bigger than the driven gear, you get more speed but less power. ""small to big"" is the opposite so you get more power but with less speed.

To move yourself under your own power on a bike you start in a lower gear. You need a lot of power to get yourself moving but shortly after you get going you can't keep up any speed in first gear. When you shift you need to add more power but at a reduced speed yet your bike's wheel speed increases."

I saw the Joker with my friends at a different theater and it was one of the worst experiences of my life and it reminded me why I go to the Alamo. The couple next to me were on their phones the entire time and then they constantly talked about how dumb the movie was because they didn't understand anything...because they weren't paying attention. And the guy in the row in front was on his phone the entire time. 

The Alamo Drafthouse is a theater that knows what people want to see, they have no lines, good food and drink, and the people actually respect one another and don't talk and text."
