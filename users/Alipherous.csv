There are lots of tricks and homemade remedies on the internet, however you need to know your skin type very well otherwise you might make it worse.

If for any reason you cannot do this then try putting toothpaste in your pimples, it would dry them out, also exfoliating your skin, having a healthy diet, with minimal processed foods, and taking care of your overall health/hygiene helps."

I was in a similar situation not long ago and having my partner tell me what where the “red flags” that made him call quits hurt at first but also helped me to understand what it would be like to be in a relationship with myself and how my unstable emotional state was affecting everything else in my life. It honestly has helped me to grow a lot as a person and I can happily say I am at a much better place now.

If I can give you any advice is: don’t be scared to ask for closure. 
It will help you understand the situation and move on, because life still goes on whether you choose you live it or not."

Fixing all of your bad habits at once is rather hard to do and most people become frustrated, instead focus on something little that you could do instead to make your life better. Once you have mastered that you can focus on bigger tasks."
getdisciplined,fcoowgk,t3_ei79rj,1577837689.0,"If you have lots of self discipline going for massive change in your life is what actually works best. “Massive change generates massive results”. And it seems to me that’s what you have been trying to do. Failing is part of the process and this tells you this is not the right approach to you, so it’s great! Because you have just learned what does not work for you. Moreover this doesn’t mean you don’t have self discipline, it simply means that your environment is set up in such a way that makes you constantly fight against your old and unproductive habits, as a result you just get burned out and frustrated.
I highly recommend you to read the Power of Habit and Atomic Habits for more on these, they are great books!

My advice is: choose a keystone habit, such as exercise, eating healthy (whole foods and cutting sugar off your diet), meditation, getting up at the same time every day, sleeping 7 and a half hours each night... and stick to this habit for 2 months. Keystone habits are those related with our wellbeing and it’s been proved that working on them actually translates to different areas of our lives, so by focusing on one thing you’d be improving multiple areas of your life. 
Most studies say that you need 21 days to create a habit but from your post it sounds that you really need to show yourself that you are capable of sticking to something. So choose a keystone habit and make sure you place a calendar somewhere you can see it to keep track of your progress. 
Moreover, it is incredibly important that you make this habit a priority in your life and that you keep it up. When you choose to change your life you are signing up a contract with yourself and every time you give up you are breaking this contract, which translates into failing yourself, getting frustrated and lowering your self esteem.
So choose something you believe you can achieve, like “I will do 5 push ups when I get up every morning for 2 months” instead of “I will run 2 miles every day for 2 months”. 

Good luck and I am really looking forward seeing your progress 💪"

The use of radioactive elements is what helped researchers discover that nucleic acids carried genetic information and were passed into generations instead of proteins. 

Think that single alterations in the primary structure of proteins can be catastrophic for living beings, even microscopic things such as the sulphur bonds of some proteins can have a macroscopic impact! 

Studying chemistry will help you gain a deeper understanding of the world around you and it will even make you more aware of the dangers of some chemicals to the environment and understand the reasons behind it"
