fatlogic,ff4jcum,t1_ff3s1o9,1579565007.0,"It has actually been pretty challenging for me personally to maintain my weight, muscle mass, and body fat while training for long course triathlon and ultra distance running. I have to eat and hydrate a lot, but if I do not choose the right food as fuel I gain weight quickly. If I skip strength, it’s even worse. I could never eat like this, it is a myth that I will “run it off.” Not to mention that if I ate 4 cheeseburgers plus soda and a shake, I would feel like I was rolling my bloated self around like a slow beach ball. There’s probably never a good time to eat this shit."
fatlogic,ff2swt8,t1_ff1qf48,1579522771.0,I’m an Ironman triathlete and if I ate like this I would throw up all over my bike.
fatlogic,fe488qo,t3_enqqdd,1578856704.0,"When I weighed 150 pounds more than I do right now, I snored terribly. So bad that people worried about me when they heard it. I haven’t snored since I lost weight and I’m not sure if it’s related, but I haven’t had any sinus infections or issues in the years since I lost it! I used to get bad sinus infections and now.. nothing."
IronmanTriathlon,fdsv5hu,t3_emuoue,1578708349.0,"I struggled with the decision of staying in the same kit or changing for my first IM. During my first HIM I got some crazy butt chafe from my wet kit over several hours. I also knew I would want more pocket space for fuel on the bike than any of my kits have. I didn’t really lose much time changing because a volunteer helped me wrangle myself into tri shorts and a jersey after the swim. I wore a swimsuit and sports bra on the swim and just peeled off my suit. I changed again for the run. I probably could have not changed again and been fine.

Disclaimer: I wasn’t going to win that shit so I was fine wasting a few extra minutes to change. I used my “changing clothes” time to calm down from my jellyfish sting PTSD."
WeightLossAdvice,fdlv4sa,t3_elq3vk,1578533220.0,"I lost 150 pounds and I just remember wondering why I waited so long to figure it out and feeling angry that I “wasted” all of my 20s sitting out on a lot of life because I was too slow, fat, and uncomfortable to really experience it the way I do now. You’re on the right track with learning how to do what you need to do if losing weight is important to you. Once I nailed down the nutrition and workout routines it changed my life. You have so much more to look forward to!"

WeightLossAdvice,fdb0r8e,t1_fdazb3k,1578252405.0,It’s ok! Little tiny steps forward! None of those things are easy and you are already doing a lot. You got this.

WeightLossAdvice,fc3bert,t1_fc33t0v,1577386048.0,"I would be down for this too! 5’6, 150 lbs, 34f, gained some weight during Ironman training when I was doing all cardio no weights and inhaling food like a crazy person."
maryland,fbyhyl5,t1_fbroohf,1577217350.0,Hey Salisbury friends!
BeachBodyWorkouts,fbe8u3d,t3_ecx5qr,1576780793.0,I said the same thing about the “baby weights” but when I went to my first barre class they destroyed me. I had to drop from a 5 to a 2 halfway through. If the BB is anything like the barre classes I’ve been through I find them challenging - but I do 1 barre class and 2 heavier weight classes per week so I can’t speak to how effective that would be on its own!
