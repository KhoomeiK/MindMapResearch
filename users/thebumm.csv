> Hamilton explained the election was to take place among all the states, so no corruption in any state could taint ""the great body of the people"" in their selection. The choice was to be made by a majority of the Electoral College, as majority rule is critical to the principles of republican government. **Hamilton argued that electors meeting in the state capitals were able to have information unavailable to the general public.**..

> Another consideration was the decision would be made without ""tumult and disorder"" as it would be a broad-based one made simultaneously in various locales where the decision-makers could deliberate reasonably, not in one place where decision-makers could be threatened or intimidated. If the Electoral College did not achieve a decisive majority, then the House of Representatives was to choose the president from among the top five candidates, **ensuring selection of a presiding officer administering the laws would have both ability and good character. Hamilton was also concerned about somebody unqualified, but with a talent for ""low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity"" attaining high office.**


So while it effectively makes certain votes count much more than others, Hamilton argued it was to supplement less intelligent votes and protect against unqualified candidates. Or, to put it simply, make up for stupid people voting for stupid candidates.


Yes, I realize smaller states want their vote to matter more than others, and the EC absolutely does that.

He met with the guy and was like ""Did you really want *me* for this? I'm usually the action guy."" and they hashed it out, and the director basically said he was unsure until meeting Paul. But that working with him was great for the movie because he nailed it and was a star, so he got eyes and some budget for his movie.


And Paul loved the movie and loved making it, and told the director he'd been called for multiple roles since that he'd never have gotten without it, and it was a mutually beneficial situation.
