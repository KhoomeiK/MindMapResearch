aww,fcj4yfp,t1_fcijhaj,1577677384.0,"Here's my theory on the Cars Pixar universe tie-in, since you asked.  So you know the opening scene in Toy Story 3, where it looks like the toys are in a western movie, but Andy is basically the writer, director, and producer, also puppeteer to all his toys as the movie scene (opening scene) wraps up you see it's just Andy playing.  So my theory is that Cars is just another child, much like Andy, in Andy's world, who's favorite toys are cars.  These movies are just the kid/ kids playing with their toy cars and scenery, except we never get to see the kids , we only see it from the way the kids see it in their imagination.  Same for the Planes movies that everyone forgets about.. Pretty sure those were Pixar, too."
