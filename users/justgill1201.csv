I was REALLY shy when we first started hanging out like i would barely say anything but as time went on and we kept hanging out i became comfy to be myself! honestly i am super thankful to him for his patience and understanding. He does make fun of me once in a while for my anxiety because he doesn’t have it so he doesn’t understand it, but in more serious times like when we plan a date but we get there and it’s super crowded and i don’t want to go in he suggests somewhere else and isn’t upset or mad. It’s all mostly about finding the right person :)"
