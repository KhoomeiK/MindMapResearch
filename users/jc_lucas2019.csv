offmychest,fctt71t,t3_eiw1un,1577958242.0,"Hey you know first of all, it's okay to open yourself to people you trust. And u can always ask them how they feel if you were to open up to them. You shouldn't shy away from it if these 3 people matter to you so much you know? You are really young and you have so much to live for. I understand the confusion and stressfulness of ""what am I gonna do with my life"" I'm currently in the same situation. I'm just trying to take it one day at a time so that I can focus on the now and worry when I get there. So don't worry okayy? You'll be fine I promise ðŸ¤— and if you ever get lonely or sad just DM me and we can talk.ðŸ˜‚ Hope everything works out for you. Take care of yourself."
offmychest,fctk0kc,t3_eiu5jp,1577946024.0,"Aye bro, you good?"
offmychest,fctjx7r,t3_eing0g,1577945921.0,We've all been there buddy. I once searched up the least painful and it was a shotgun to the head. You shouldn't do it tho. Life does get better. You meet people and they change your life. You just have to wait until the right person comes to you. You'll know it when it happens. You just have to wait for it man.

teenrelationships,fccrpjh,t1_fccqvu4,1577601846.0,My first kiss started with my hand on her boob. And I just kissed her. I didn't even realize till after that I just got my first kiss. You'll be fine.
teenrelationships,fccrg58,t1_fccqvu4,1577601760.0,"Honestly. It's just something you're gonna have to do you know? Nobody here can walk you through your first kissðŸ˜‚ you just gotta do it you know? It'll come to you, don't worry about it."
teenrelationships,fccr5on,t3_eh21uf,1577601661.0,You lips touch hers and maybe you put your tongue with hers? It's gonna happen so fast and your body will tell you what to do. You just can't think about it. It'll just happen. Just lean in to kiss her on the lips and the rest will come to you.
teenrelationships,fcci5tw,t3_eh21uf,1577598663.0,Bro bro bro. Before you do it if you want to. Say happy new years and then just do itðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
teenrelationships,fcchz0w,t3_eh21uf,1577598601.0,Honestly bro. You just go for it. I didn't plan my first kiss either. I just went for it. It doesn't have to be perfect. It's your first time. Just let her know that and everything will be fine. Promise ðŸ¤—
AskReddit,fc01g8x,t1_fc00nnq,1577273578.0,Yes I can do that as well.
teenrelationships,fbkixpi,t3_edkzi6,1576951097.0,Yeah bro that's completely out of your control. There's nothing you can do about that to be honest. Sorry man. Hope things go well for you and your gf.
