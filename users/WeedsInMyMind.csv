I somehow caught the bike as I overhand threw it at him.  I literally snatched it out of the air somehow.  I told him he was banned from the store and to never come back.  

I went to talk with Danny and he was fine.  Me?  I was a shaking mass of angry adrenaline.  All I wanted to do was chase that motherfucker down and beat the shit out of him.

You can tell him why you did what you did, but you shouldn't present it as an excuse.  Even at the age of 12 you knew what you were doing was wrong, so to try to use your youth or your jealousy as an excuse for your behavior is an attempt to justify your actions.

Even if he never accepts your apology, he is owed one.  That is what you, as a decent human being, should do.  After that, it is up to him as to whether or not he wants to invite you back into his life, and if he chooses not to do so, well can you really blame him?

Do the right thing.  You'll never begin to get over the guilt until you do."

2. Is a ratification past the original 7 year deadline even valid - if not, then the ERA is and has been effectively dead and any ratification past 1979 (three states, to include Virginia) are merely feel good motions and mean nothing

ChoosingBeggars,fdp37es,t1_fdnyasd,1578618921.0,"You are probably better off without that type of person in your life, but if I may offer a suggestion .... never work for free for anyone. 

I am an accountant and used to do tax work for free, or for heavily discounted rates, for family and close friends.  I won't go into the trouble that it caused me, but I finally had enough and now I charge everyone the going rate.  When someone approaches me about doing work for free now my standard response is, ""I charge my brother full price and if I am going to charge him full price, everyone else is going to pay the same"".

It has ""lost"" me some work, but I survived."

AdviceAnimals,fdojzej,t1_fdofwak,1578606679.0,"Copy/pasta:

**Leafy greens**, such as spinach, kale, swiss chard, collard and beet **greens contain** between 2.5–6.4 mg of **iron** per cooked cup, or 14–36% of the RDI. For example, 100 grams of spinach contains 1.1 times more **iron** than the same amount of red meat and 2.2 times more than 100 grams of salmon (26, 27).

EDIT for more copy/pasta:

 **Some of the best plant sources of iron are:**

* Beans and lentils.
* Tofu.
* Baked potatoes.
* Cashews.
* Dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach.
* Fortified breakfast cereals.
* Whole-grain and enriched breads."

I know it is not one of the great films of Hollywood, but something about it really speaks to me.  I rewatched it just the other day.  Probably the 15th or so time I have seen it."

WorldOfWarships,fdo8kf9,t1_fdnvv0e,1578600753.0,My wife did that with my truck.  Going in between two buildings she turned too hard and connected with the corner of one building right at the passenger truck door.  Instead of backing up she doubled down and just scraped the shit out of the side of my truck while damaging the corner of the building.  I was less than pleased.
