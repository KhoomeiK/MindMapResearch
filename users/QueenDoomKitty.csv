StartledCats,ff59797,t3_erhrn0,1579584019.0,Something seems off here.....
LushCosmetics,fefn5iw,t3_eos43e,1579059957.0,"Definitely not your fault. I work for lush and I'm head of our receiving team. I always make sure every bottle is tightly sealed before putting it on the floor. I've been seeing way too many posts about this exact issue and have personally made it a goal to make sure customers are getting their sprays safely home!! 
We as a store double check the bottles at checkout. 

I can't say much about other stores or the NA distribution. We have been getting leaky shipments ourselves!! I'm not sure what's going on, but it needs to get resolved ASAP. Especially since the body sprays are the big topic right now (aside from valentine's day launch)"

Definitely grab the snowflakes if you're in love by tomorrow!! I personally love Once upon a time and stocked up to get me through the year!! 

Great haul you have!! Happy holidays"
