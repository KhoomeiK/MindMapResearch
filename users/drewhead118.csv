He also went and got him an entirely new family, little problem solver that he is, and my wife married his new father (though he still lets me see the little champ on weekends). They've got a very happy marriage now and they even let me watch sometimes when they get intimate, which is a relief, because our little pride and joy has completely robbed me of any sense of purpose I once held in life. Our young genius is so incredible and I weep every night  before bed wishing that I could turn back time and undo the actions that led to the painful, empty void in my heart that burns at me day in and day out. We always called him our little miracle, and now I realize that I'll need another miracle to climb out of this pit that's swallowed me hole like a bottomless sinkhole.

Instead, they were transported to another time and place. It was a prison, and they themselves were one of the guards. They watched as they looped a bed sheet into a garotte and they switched off security cameras. They felt the jitters of butterflies as they walked to the right cell block, and then to the right iron door... they felt the weight of blackmail over his head, the internal war between morals and a sense of necessity of self-preservation. Self-preservation won.

Once a child passes through the barrier, it is utterly impossible to remove him from the play center. Camps of scientists often set up shop in McDonald's stores to observe this phenomenon, and many interesting discoveries have been made. For instance, there is the age-old question: ""If matter brought into the playpen is irretrievable, does that not violate the universal conservation of information law?""

It turns out that it does not, due to what has been dubbed the Holographic McPrinciple. In a sense, all information that enters the playpen is projected flatwards onto the surface of the pen, and may even be projected on the very barrier edge of the universe, if such a thing even exists. Furthermore, Hawking won a McNobel Prize with his theory that playpens gradually lose mass through a process known as play-type radiation, where virtual particles formed at the threshhold of McDonald's Play Pens are separated (sending the unpaired particle outside the horizon out into space, a form of energy leak that all singularities exhibit)"

 Combine 2/3 cup of water with pasta in large bowl. Mix well, stirring until the solution viscosity reaches 1.0045 millipascal seconds at 20°C measured by a falling ball viscometer. Once prepared, a graduated pipette may be used to siphon off 12 mL of solution (to be stored aside in a separate container for moistening purposes later). Microwave times vary based on altitude. Generally, t= 200 + 0.05h where h is your approximate height, in meters, above sea level. During cook time, keep kids safe. File your form IO-7 in this interval, careful to note down the model number and serial of your microwave in the fifth and seventh boxes, respectively. The completed form IO-7 will give you an access code to disengage your microwave's magnalock. Beware that entering the code incorrectly twice will lead to microwave reactivation and destruction of your foodproduct. Once the code is entered correctly, bowl & macaroni will be very hot and rapidly transitioning through states of matter in the equivalence point. Use a pair of electrically-grounded tongs to remove the bowl, careful not to inhale any of the rising fumes (or risk noodles precipitating inside your nasal cavity). Add cheese powder 5 mg at a time, stirring after each addition until fully dissolved. The upper corner of the box may be torn off as a handy measurement guide, provided that the user can supply his/her own calipers. After half of the powder has been added, wet the remaining powder with the moisture water set aside in earlier steps. This sauce must then be whipped on high for 18-22 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Pour the macaroni mixture into this sauce (do NOT go the other way around, pouring the sauce onto the macaroni, or a dangerous reaction may occur). Mix under a fume hood and allow to sit until ionically inert. Your macaroni is ready to enjoy!

Do NOT eat with any pewter cookware. Do NOT eat if you have any metal filings in your mouth or have bullet shrapnel anywhere in your body. Do NOT eat if you have any alleles of the CODA-r7+ gene, or if anyone in your family has tested positive for this gene. CODA testing may be accomplished with the genomic kit included in your macaroni box."

I felt a surge of deep, resonant emotion, knowing that I stood on the precipice of fulfilling my life's work. Everything that I had ever been, it had all been steps... one after another, left after right, bringing me forth to this exact moment. This was my time to achieve the thing I had been born to do all along... this was my chance to leave my imprint upon the sands of history, before we all fade into the dust.

AskReddit,ff2bnr0,t1_ff25sn1,1579499838.0,"Honestly, there's that story by Twain called ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" and it feels too Muskian to ignore. In the story, a random american dude gets sent back to the reign of King Arthur. He uses his knowledge from the present to revolutionize science and oust sorcerers and take over politically and economically... if we imagine that a similar book were written in 500 years about a guy from 2520 sent back to the early 2000's, the story would be like identical to Elon Musk's. If he's not ousted as a time traveler, I'll eat my own Tesla's driver's seat upholstery (if he gives me one first)"

The photographer swims towards the woman, captivated by her display, but this is all part of the game... the affectation of the head's slow sway, the gentle sculpting gestures of the hands... they're all the bait. When the photographer swims in close, thinking he's found true love or some such, the woman retracts her glowing head (which is revealed to be nothing more than a bioluminescent appendage) and then she eats the photographer in one full bite with her prehensile jaw before darkness settles over the acquarium again and the angler fish returns to its normal business, its hunger sated for a few hours longer"

But Rob wouldn't have it.

""Double the botox injection schedule... and my god, the wrinkles. We're signing you up for another anti-aging skin replacement surgery pronto.""

Danny Devito only smiled wanly, now being four decades beyond losing the ability to speak. He sympathized with his coworker's pains, but knew that he was inherently weak. This was their burden to bare... they were all Sisyphus, each hoisting their own boulders up the hill of comedy TV.

Charlie ran his fingers along the glass, a tear in his eyes. His hands had been replaced... the one that wore his wife's ring was rotting in the dirt somewhere. The heart that had fallen in love was replaced in 2080 and again in 2125... the eyes that had watched his first sunrise were 65 years gone now. He was the ship of Theseus, and he felt his concept of self unravel with each passing surgery or replacement. What was even Charlie anymore, and what was the frankenstein abomination medical science had created?

Most prayed for rest, the deep sleep from which they would never return. But Rob continued with the botox injections, with the skeletomuscular surgeries, the artificial exoskeleton boosts. ""We'll keep doing it forever,"" he swore. It was their lifetime sentence, but even those tended to eventually end. Not in their case. This was their lot, now and forever. After all, so long as the sun continues to burn, and their horrid prison continues to spin, it's *always* sunny in Philadelphia."
