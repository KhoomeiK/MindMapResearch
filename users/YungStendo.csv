She cocked her head and stared for a moment before saying “You’ve come to this place to take your own life human?” He held up his right hand to show a rope tied in a noose. “That’s what the rope’s for.” he said with a smile. She smiled a bit. “You seem pretty enthusiastic for a person on deaths door.” She said inquisitively. “I’ve been looking for his address for years. I’m just glad this is all gonna be over.” He said as he sighed and looked down. Before the woman could say anything, his head shot up and he exclaimed, “Enough about me, what’s an 400 year old.. uhh.. What exactly are you. You weren’t very specific when you said you were  ‘not human’. “ He said sarcastically. “Why thank you for asking.” She dipped her head almost like a bow. “I.. am a demon that appears whenever a large quantity of negative energy is congregated into one area. And you my friend, are are swimming in it.” She stated confidently. He smiled lightly and said “You call me your friend yet you haven’t even told me your name. She smiled and said “My apologies, I am Roberta. Now, reveal your identity human.” He raised an eyebrow at this but said “I’m Brandon Hoy. I hate to cut to the chase here but I’m kinda busy at the moment. Do you need something from me?” He stated. She looked at him smugly and said “You’re the one that summoned me. I think you’re the one that needs something from me.” “Oh please, what could you possibly have that a deadman could want.” He said bluntly. She paused for a moment and then calmly said “A deal.” His jaw dropped a bit in surprise and he snapped back with “So the demon wants me to make a deal with it. How cliche. Sorry but I’ve seen how this movie ends. I sell you my soul for something that allows me to enjoy life and then I go on living knowing that when I die I go to hell to get tortured for all eternity. Sorry sweet cheeks but I’m not buying it. At least this solves the question of whether or not there is an afterlife.” She scoffed and angrily said “I don’t want your soul asshole. That’s just a stereotype. What I want is significantly less important.” He squinted his eyes. “And what’s that.” He sneered. “I’m not here to offer you another chance at life. If you want to end your life then that’s not my choice. He blurted out “What’s your point.” She angrily said “I was getting there, the afterlife does exist however getting there is a... bit of a challenge. I can offer you safe passage to it.” He was intrigued now. “And what do I owe you in return?” He asked. “You will live under my jurisdiction and vote for me in all elections for a minimum of 100 years.” Brandon looked shocked beyond belief. “POLITICS!” He exclaimed “You mean to tell me that this afterlife is still full of drama, politics, and bullshit I’m trying to escape in this world.” He said sounding genuinely defeated. She looked at him seriously and said “What did you think humans would get wiser and more astute just because they died.” “Good point. Well honestly I don’t care about my life or what happens to me so fuck it. I’m in. Escort me to the afterlife Roberta.” She smiled confidently. “I knew you’d come around.” Brandon walked over to the tree and began tying the rope around a firm branch. “Welp, only one thing left to do.”"

socialskills,fecpip8,t3_eoglkn,1578980017.0,It looks to me like you are downplaying yourself and assuming that others are on a higher level than yourself. This is not true. You just have too much faith in other people. I had a similar problem until I broke and realized that everybody is shitty. People aren’t nice and everybody is just as fucked up as you or worse.
socialskills,fecoz6g,t3_eogq4q,1578979543.0,"A big thing is that when you have a negative mindset about something it gets increasingly more difficult to succeed in it. So if you are constantly depressed about not having friends and expecting everything to always go horribly for you, it will. This is all speaking from experience. I use to be a sad lonely friendless idiot with no motivation in life but I turned it all around with the power of positive thinking. Now I’m still a sad lonely idiot but at least I have good friends to help me through it.

Another big thing here:
I am an avid anime fan myself and I have spent most of my life learning how to deal with talking to people who aren’t anime fans about it. This is what I’ve learned.
Do not talk about anime the first time you meet someone unless they bring it up. Hell, it’s honestly better to just not ever bring it up as a conversation starter. Rather, act as if it is no big deal. Most normal people have a very negative stigma about anime. This means if you bring it up in the middle of a conversation, there is a good chance you’ll lose cool points. If you try and push it on your friends, they will never watch it. Instead, you have to get creative. The easiest way to do it is to wait until you have developed a connection with a a few friends and then one day just have anime on without saying anything about it. Never say “hey we should watch anime” because everybody will be skeptical and shut it down. If it’s just on the tv, then they are definitely going to give it a chance. Just make sure you have something good on that will capture their interest like death note, or akame ga kill and not high school dxd or monster musume.
Now if you make friends with anime fans then this is not gonna help but it’s great for making friends with people who don’t like it. 

Hope I heped"

socialskills,fdhqnci,t1_fdfcc3t,1578428260.0,"I think the problem falls on both people. Michael was clearly putting no effort forth and being pretentious. However, Jessica has the opportunity to respond in a constructive way that  could convince Michael to watch the show. Instead, she immediately got mad and started what could escalate into a fight rather than give the response that would end well for both parties. So both people are in the wrong. Most likely, there are other problems in the relationship that are causing little issues like this to get blown out of proportion. This by itself is absolutely no reason to get upset about. However, if this is something Michael does all the time then it will be a problem."

socialskills,fdd3f6h,t3_ekq4tw,1578293177.0,It depends on Jessica’s response. If she says something like “who cares about reviews let’s watch it anyway. We can make fun of stuff that doesn’t make sense if we have to.” Then that’s pretty healthy. But if she says something like “Why don’t you wanna watch it with me you must not like me” or gets passively aggressively mad that will start a fight and means the relationship isn’t healthy. If this is something that causes a problem then it means there is some overarching issue that is decaying the relationship.
