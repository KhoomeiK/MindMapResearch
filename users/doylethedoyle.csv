Hell, the All Saints' Church in Brixworth was built a whole century before Vikings ever started raiding British shores, and is a damn impressive piece of architecture. While OP is right in saying that the environment should be absolutely beautiful, they've made a lot of assumptions that are pretty wrong."
assassinscreed,fd4mx5o,t1_fd3v61z,1578169044.0,"There were definitely castles. Granted, not like we'd know them, but small fortified settlements. A number of burhs had been constructed across Britain prior to Alfred the Great's large-scale building program in the ninth century. Not to mention the fact that most Iron Age hillforts and Roman forts across Britain were still garrisoned and maintained, albeit with wood rather than stone.

I think there's a lot of potential for good architecture throughout Britain even during this period. Large wooden halls and houses could be as impressive as they were elegant even during the Anglo-Saxon period."

AskHistorians,fc02gg8,t3_efceyh,1577275192.0,"The short answer is simply; we don't know. Also, apologies for the following formatting, because I'm on mobile.

The Picts only really first show up towards late antiquity, when a confederation of Picts was formed, possibly in response to the Roman Empire on their southern borders. The first use of ""Pict"" as a name for these people occurs in a panegyric from the very late 3rd century, and is usually held to mean ""the painted people"".

The Pictish Chronicle, a pseudo-historical account of the Pictish kings dated to around the 10th century, presents the Picts as conquerors from Scythia, as does the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Bede's *Ecclesiastical History*, and Geoffrey of Monmouth's *History of the Kings of Britain*, though considering how much these sources would have borrowed from one another this view isn't generally regarded as accurate by most historians of the era. If, however, the Picts were indeed descended from Scythia, that would put them around central Asia, near Kazakhstan or thereabouts.

It's generally assumed that the Picts were simply descendants of the Caledonians, or some of the other tribes that occupied Alba in earlier centuries that are mentioned by numerous Roman geographers as well as on Ptolemy's world map. The Caledonians were themselves Celtic, with likely origins being in western or central Europe, and are first attested iirc by Tacitus in his *Agricola*. As we don't really know what the Picts called themselves, it's entirely possible that they even called themselves Caledonians or continued the use of another Iron Age Celtic tribal name; it's been suggested that they called themselves the Albidosi, based on the name found in the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba during the reign of Malcolm I, but even that's disputed by some historians. Really we just don't know much for certain.

There's very little in the way of surviving Pictish writing to tell us much about their language or history in their own words, so we have to rely on what we know of them from folks like Bede and the Irish annals, as well as the scant archaeology that we have that's ""distinctly"" Pictish.
