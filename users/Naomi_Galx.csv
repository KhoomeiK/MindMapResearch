BlueEyedShadow.

He was my best friend and was frankly an okay guy until I remembered he sexualized me as a child and tried to make me his next wife when I was like 12 and he was 17 and in a breaking relationship (I'm almost 17 now and he's now 22).

He doesn't have a big channel, maybe 69 subs (nice, I know). And we got into a fight where I didn't talk to him for 3 days, so he got mad/upset and started saying horrible things to me. Saying how he missed me and how I ""used to be"" basically.

He constantly talked horribly about my friend, Sandy, called me senstive because I was being honest, sent me mentally abusive texts than would delete them, try to make me feel bad for all the things he was messing up on etc.

I did a video with him 3 days before the fight, which he did upload and it was the most successful video on his channel because he, every single time we played, or streamed, told me to shout him and his channel out.

After the fight I posted in the comments of that very same video, saying why I will no longer be on his channel with a link of the fight.
