PrequelMemes,fdr23b9,t1_fdqj5l1,1578678386.0,"Right but it would then be more apt to call it a crusade against a people who blasphemes your religion. Calling it a 'balance' that must be maintained is the same as sweeping everything under the rug. In order to return balance to the force they all became warlords that led armies to root out the separatist party. Neither side is necessarily right at that point. The basic initial Sith creed is all about self empowerment through your emotions, by the time the rule of two comes about we have a completely hate based power (Narratively it's actually very similar to the whole fire bending story in the Last Airbender). The Jedi code is all about suppressing who you are to attain a more clear understanding of the force of the world, but their actions rarely reflect that. The balance is literally equivalent to doing things 'for the greater good' by the time the war is in full swing."
PrequelMemes,fdqeism,t1_fdpmmnt,1578664591.0,That's not exactly canonical. There was no initial light side or dark side because they started by following both paths. There was no distinction. Dark side isn't a corruption of the force it's quite literally described as a sort of yang to a yin. There was a sort of civil war between the dark and light side users where the lightside users cast out the dark side users who travelled to the Sith planet and began sharing the dark side teachings with the sith race.
PrequelMemes,fdqe58g,t1_fdpnxbn,1578664296.0,It's not exactly bullshit to ask why the perception of balance is used like propaganda when it sounds more like some deranged belief to facilitate murdering a rival faith.

ProgressionFantasy,fdoel5u,t3_emfk9c,1578603666.0,"I think the narrative reason for cultivation is what matters most. There's some comfort in recognizing over the course of the novel that the mc is steadily growing stronger apart from the rest of the story.  
  
In your case having multiple sub plots throughout the book about the mc taking sabbaticals to get things necessary for reaching the cultivation stages would be appropriate. Say in some place he finds some sort of drug that enhances the density of his musculature that when combined with other items allows his body to withstand whatever your cultivation energy may be.  
  
Or if it's a Mana based cultivation, detailing various techniques and introducing a system that when used in conjunction allows a mage to steadily grow stronger and stronger indefinitely would be compelling. Say you have a spell that boosts Mana regeneration, a spell that boosts Mana capacity, a magic shell spell, and some sort of numbing spell. When the characters have all these spells combined for some plot specific reason they realize that they've somehow tricked their body into widening their Mana capacity or increasing the absorbion rate or some other thing.  
  
The important aspects of cultivation are always more to do with giving the reader a notion of improvement so that they feel like they know how strong the character is during various situations. There's a certain minor thrill in reading about a character, whom you know has been steadily growing stronger, getting into situations where that progression is noticeable. The classic example is a school bully who initially is above the mc in strength or social position and then say a month or two later the situation is reversed by the MC's steady progression."

ProgressionFantasy,fdochro,t3_em5law,1578602668.0,"I'm just gonna keep recommending Reborn Apocalypse, even though it does have a slight litrpg aspect. (They have a shop where they purchase abilities and weapons, they get points by killing things). The main story is a step above most of the plots we see in the genre and I honestly think it'll continue as a great read. In terms of stats, you do see the stat pages but they're not interactable. He cultivates, he trains, he trains others, and most importantly he tries to save the world. It's a fun read and much of what makes a litrpg a litrpg (levels, cooldowns, dungeoning, and raids) is absent in the book. It feels far closer to a hybrid of the two genres with some wuxia elements."
