Kinda like, when you feel like you’re gonna throw up, and you just want it to be over with even though that means you’d have to throw up anyways"
Epilepsy,ffd1gn8,t3_esvpsk,1579811544.0,Make sure you are super cautious-I was put on the wrong birth control meds with my seizure meds and I couldn’t even walk for a month before they figured out it was the meds. They were even looking into MS and Neurofibromatosis. Just make sure that you double and triple check that it won’t affect anything.
vegancirclejerk,ffcmjf2,t1_ffcfacf,1579802623.0,"There’s ways to do Keto as a vegan. The entire premise of the keto diet is supposed to only be for epilepsy-that’s the reason it was made. People who do it for weight loss are idiots who haven’t gone to see a nutritionist and are gonna be sick real quick. It’s not even healthy for epileptics it’s just a way to manage seizures, like any medicine would.

starbucks,ff3nvpb,t1_ff3iv3w,1579545066.0,"Texting is the way they do it at their location (mine as well) so I understand how reporting it to starbucks may result in them placing the blame on her. But the other things seem unacceptable to me. I just posted another post as a follow up or I guess add-on to this post. I’ll ask you, though as well cause you seem to know the specifics of the handbook. Isn’t there a rule in the handbook where you don’t need to find coverage if you have a doctors note? That’s what my manager said so I don’t know if that’s his policy or the company’s. Would you happen to know?

Epilepsy,fdkypro,t1_fdkaikp,1578513902.0,They were better than without the Lamictal . I got good at covering my eyes when I was near strobe lights so I didn’t have debilitating seizures-just eye fluttering when I was in the car when I forgot to cover my eyes. I’m now having myoclonics unprovoked but I’m in between doctors right now so I can’t really do anything. I went to my neuro for the last time last week and he blew me off and I didn’t get the help I need. So now I have to wait three months for my seizures to get worse.

I was out of school for like a whole month.
My family and I are really careful with medicines and what interacts with what. Even though we’re careful, seizure meds are still strong as hell. I’m gonna have side effects with whatever medicine I take.
I understand not being able to joke about it right now. Depression and anxiety due to seizures and med changes can really take a toll on your mental health. I really hope you and your doctors figure out what treatment works best for you. You might want to recommend trying the keto diet. It’s a treatment that doctors usually prescribe when no medicines have worked. They tried to put me on that diet but I caved with donuts"
Epilepsy,fdir8e7,t1_fdipx6a,1578449242.0,"A way that helps me cope with my seizures is comedy. If I stub my toe or rip a piece of paper on accident I’ll say something like “that was worse that my first seizure” cause it’s just overly dramatic and just stupid. It makes me and the people around me a little more comfortable around the topic because I joke about it.

It would help us focus more on her baggage with her family and religion, and her more deep personality instead of the surface-level “quirky” side of her. The scene with her calling her dad and learning that her sister had basically cut her off was amazing. Her acting was on point and a ton of real emotion was coming out. That’s the Finley I like"

Epilepsy,fdihdxe,t1_fdifmuy,1578442958.0,"That means a lot to me. When doctors tell you that they’re not seizures, you start to doubt yourself and it’s not a good feeling. It’s causing me to harm myself. Yesterday I was facing the sun with my eyes closed in the car when there were trees around. I was basically having seizures  the entire time. I just had to prove to myself that I am having seizures. It’s weird to have to prove something to yourself, but neurological disorders are difficult to explain to doctors since they can’t just X-ray your brain and be like “it’s coming from here and your epilepsy is [insert type of epilepsy]” like you can with bones or organs and stuff. A lot of the time, the neurologists have never had the experience of having a seizure. It’s probably impossible to understand what exactly a seizure feels like which in turn causes them to second guess you. It stands in the way of getting the help you need. I just wish epilepsy was black and white like some disorders/disabilities that aren’t in the brain are. I wish that a simple procedure can indicate whether you’re having seizures or not. EEGs are cool and all but it’s never guaranteed that you’ll have a seizure in the little time you’re testing."
Epilepsy,fdi9a60,t1_fdi5ucw,1578438033.0,Caffeine is super bad for me which sucks cause I love starbucks cold brews lol
Epilepsy,fdi927x,t1_fdi5f44,1578437920.0,"I totally understand the panic thing. When I woke up from my first tonic clonic, my mom was repeating “it’ll be okay, it’ll be okay...” over and over and it made things ten times worse. 
OP, If your girlfriend has another tonic clonic, make sure you are calm when she regains consciousness. 
Sometimes seizure meds do more harm than good. The side effects can sometimes be more harmful and debilitating than the seizures. I would talk to the doctor about trying a new one if in a week or two nothing changes. I’ve gone through four or five different meds before I found one that was okay (even though now it isn’t strong enough anymore.)
Her seizures seem to be progressing in the same way mine did. After my first unprovoked grand mal, I looked back and realized that the tics I would have in the car when the sun and trees would create a strobe effect we’re seizures the whole time, I just never realized it. After the grand mal, I started to have myoclonic seizures and another grand mal. It’s just progressed since then. I know it’s not something you want to hear but it seems as though there’s a pattern. I’m just sharing my experience with it so don’t take my word for it-it is probably not the case for her, but just be prepared for it Incase it does happen. Just make sure to support her and help her talk to doctors because when we have seizures, we usually don’t know what we look like, how long it lasts, and things like that. It’s good to have someone who can record those types of things for people who have recurring seizures.
I really hope y’all figure out the best treatment and coping methods to get through
Figuring out medication and the very beginning of the journey is the hardest part. You seem crazy supportive and willing to learn more to help her. You guys are gonna get through it. This subreddit is really helpful if you need any advice or support."
Epilepsy,fdi4e44,t1_fdi362o,1578435528.0,"I love joking about what seizures are like. In my AP art history class a couple years ago, they were talking about shamans or something who would have “visions” and fall into a “trance” and they showed a shaman who was still looked at as a supernatural all-seeing person having a seizure while people were like “he’s having a vision!!!”. So I told my friends that if I have a seizure, to tell everyone to not disturb my vision. (Obviously they would actually help me right after the joke or just wouldn’t do it)."
Epilepsy,fdi2lpa,t1_fdi18il,1578434619.0,I’m publicly totally against drugs so when I describe it like that pple are like “but you’ve never had drugs”. It’s funny. But yeah I think that’s a really good explanation for it.
Epilepsy,fdi1woc,t1_fdhbvb1,1578434266.0,Yeah. My parents convinced the best internist in town to take me in since my pediatrician felt just like a “simple” health problem doctor like the flu and colds and stuff when I was left debilitated by all of my meds for a month. My dad is in denial that I have epilepsy and especially the label “disabled” since he’s never seen one of my tonic clonic seizures. My mom has been there for all three of them so she takes my health way more seriously than my dad. I talked to her about it and she seems open to the idea of trying to get me to see this female epilepsy specialist before I turn 18 cause something needs to change now. I can’t wait three months for my seizures to get worse.
Epilepsy,fdi0ytf,t1_fdhsgaz,1578433795.0,"It feels like my auras that come before a grand mal seizure. It’s so strong that my mom thought I was seeing things because I couldn’t focus on anything so I was looking at one place yelling that I didn’t know what was going on and being frantic. My “episodes” (again, I’m not excited to be calling them episodes cause I’m nearly 100% sure they’re seizures) feel like half as strong as my auras which is still quite scary. I can hear things but it doesn’t register, it feels like cotton balls in my brain (idk if that makes sense) and I can’t talk-I usually only repeat that I don’t know what’s going on or that I need help."
Epilepsy,fdgpkzv,t1_fdgcl7e,1578404934.0,"When I had my first grand mal, when I was in the hospital trying to figure out why I had it, an intern who was following around the doctor came in without the actual doctor and had a House MD moment where he was like “I don’t think it was a real seizure. I think it’s psychological.” After the EEG showed seizure activity, I didn’t see him after that. So at least they were on top of it in terms of getting that kid off of the case. But yeah. It was probably also because I was a teenage girl in a room of three men nodding their heads to the whole “you are overreacting and it’s because you’re young”. Like... even though it’s 2020, older men see women (especially young) as not being able to handle things as well as them. I went to him for help and he blew off everything I said. I just don’t know what to do cause I’m not getting the help I need and I had three myoclonic seizures yesterday which used to be controlled by my meds. And the partials have been getting worse but he ignored me when I told him about the “episodes” (I hate calling them episodes but no neurologist has confirmed that they are partials so I don’t feel comfortable calling them seizures yet cause it hasn’t been officially stated that they are)"
Epilepsy,fdew8qn,t1_fdek0yz,1578347901.0,"It would be good to do the EEG to see what it is just in case. I really hope you figure out what’s going on, though. Not knowing is scary. You shouldn’t have to just deal with these episodes of spacing out and feeling weird (for me, those feel like an aura that I would get before a grand mal). My neurologist is kinda going that route of just ignoring my seizures. I’m going to a new neurologist who just specializes in epilepsy in three months though so I’m excited.
I’m in the car as I’m writing this and had multiple myoclonic seizures while writing this lol. (I’m a passenger cause I can’t drive bc of it so I’m not driving while having seizures)"
Epilepsy,fdejpm5,t1_fdeaarn,1578340475.0,"Bread is more important than seizures imo. Donuts are what got me. I only had to take off two days since I did a 48 hour at-home EEG. It is definitely costly but if it can be done, definitely try. Even if nothing shows up, then you’ll know it’s probably medication side effects and those could be changed so that you can function at least semi normally. If nothing shows up, it doesn’t make the episodes invalidated. The things you’re experiencing are still bad things but it will probably be easier to treat if it is side effects from your meds."
Epilepsy,fddyo0m,t1_fdd60iy,1578327169.0,"Also, idk how you are, but telling your dr what you want/need is super great. I was more passive when talking to my dr when he was like “stay on these meds that are giving you a ton of side effects and aren’t even helping your myoclonic seizures” and I had to be more assertive and tell him I needed to try something. He ended up putting me on a keto diet (which didn’t last long since I’m still in school and don’t have enough time to make food everyday and stuff). But standing up for yourself in your treatment is very important. It took me a while to figure that out. Idk if you do that already but I just thought I’d share my experience with suggesting I do an EEG at home."
Epilepsy,fddy8rl,t1_fdd60iy,1578326881.0,"I don’t mean to act as “doctor” or anything but have you tried a long at-home eeg? If your weird spacey feelings happen often enough (mine come on random days with no rhyme or reason) they could see what the spacing out could be. There’s a possibility the spacing out could be a side effect of a medication, as well. It’d help them know if they need to change your meds if it’s a side effect, or up your dose if it’s seizure activity. I totally get the embarrassment of spacing out. I’m a barista and someone ordered just a plain coffee (the most simple thing we have) and I spaced out for like 10 seconds and the dude was confused and was like “all I want is coffee...” and it was awkward lol"
Epilepsy,fdcwe0c,t1_fc7uq4u,1578286255.0,"I was going back through my comments cause I was bored and had an idea: since after my first grand mal they were able to see seizure activity in the hospital later ~after~ my seizure at home, they were able to figure out more about what it was or whatever. Maybe you could talk to your dr about going straight to the ER or somewhere to do an EEG immediately after one of your grand mals you have had at home. Idk how they could’ve still seen seizure activity hours after my seizure (it was a pretty big one though-lasted over 4 mins until the EMT gave me that medicine that stops the seizure), but if they could catch it, it could give the dr more info and stuff."
Epilepsymemes,fdcvjiq,t3_ekouww,1578285532.0,I love making jokes like these. Especially the “seize the day” quotes that are everywhere - I’ll point it out and be like “well that’s kinda mean” or something like that.

Epilepsy,fc6x9mt,t1_fc6vi37,1577491861.0,I have seizures quite often (multiple times a day). I’ve had two grand mals which each had crazy strong auras. My “every-day seizures” are absense and myoclonic. But now I think I may be having focal aware seizures (basically an aura as I’ve been told). I go to my neurologist on the 30th so we’ll see. I totally understand the panic attack part though. My freshman year of high school (a couple months after my very first tonic-clonic) I had a headache and started hyperventilating because I thought I was about to have a seizure in class and my teacher had to carry me to the nurse.
