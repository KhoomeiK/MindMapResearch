facepalm,fep48dg,t1_fep3snz,1579311777.0,"Yeah, it's..  insane how for all of our strides in this world, we still tear each other apart.  And for what reason?  To make yourself feel better?  You know what really feels good, telling someone they look nice.  Sitting with someone who needs to vent about how their body image makes the feel.  Helping people who need it, be it to lose weight, or just to get them where they feel ok with themselves.  High days, or low days.    It's infuriating that the movement has become what it has."
facepalm,fep3gvm,t1_femw5gi,1579311286.0,I'm an overweight woman as well..   Body positivity is for everyone.   So this article is fulla shit for sure and whoever wrote it needs to retract it.  Good lords if we can't get the media to stop spewing this double standard BS now...

badwomensanatomy,felq0m6,t1_fekmdj5,1579228138.0,"Same here.   The moment someone spits for lube, I'm out and looking for something else."

insanepeoplefacebook,fec4103,t1_feaygtq,1578966334.0,"And part of the reason the third season of Gargoyles wasn't as good as the first two, and then got canceled all together was because of parents bitching that the show was too adult for kids.  Even the creator said that it was never meant for kids, that it was for teens and young adults.  But Disney marketing was all.. Oooh no, it's a cartoon! So it's got to go in the cartoon time block!  ...ugh..  sorry, this is a rant I've had since my 20's because I *loved* that show.."

facepalm,febklx3,t3_eo6zvh,1578959788.0,I had to live through his bs in the 80's... and we're STILL DEALING WITH HIM!  Just go the fuck away North! Go the fuck away!

Had the same moment with ""the Lioness"".  Watching ep. 5 and seeing her.  I'm like.. ""Hey wait.. Isn't this the same Queen from ep. 1..""  Then at the end it all freaking clicked.   Fuck.  XD"
insanepeoplefacebook,fe5xl72,t1_fe5k7ds,1578877193.0,"I was following along alright until episode 5.  At first it was so confusing, I'm like ""Wait, holup...""  but after the episode ended it became clear about the timeline.  Sort of.  Yen's timeline is still confusing to me.  (I've been watching an episode every couple of days so that I can work through what I just watched.  So next episode for me is 6.)"

badwomensanatomy,fdshc41,t1_fdsgicc,1578702759.0,"Furry porn is a gold mind if you can stomach some of the requests and don't get burned out from it.  I couldn't do it..  my first request was of a snake person eating their victim while all also raping them.  I said no.. because well, none of that is something I ever want to draw, and was berated and threatened.   Not every person looking for art is like that, but enough is to make me never want to offer commissions again. =\"
facepalm,fdemp7t,t1_fddy7kb,1578342268.0,yeah but all they had to do was google their names and ...bam.. all the pictures of the correct people!
insanepeoplefacebook,fcvu60w,t3_ej1npy,1578010179.0,So I know we can punch a nazi in the face when we see them out there.. but can we punch anyone who wears these too?  Especially those of us who have lost family to the Holocaust?

I started to call them out on that, but no.. they truly never heard of him.    There are people out there who you would think would know or get something, that have somehow stayed innocent of that thing."
