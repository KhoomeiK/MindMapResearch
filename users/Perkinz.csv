Every group has extremist nutcases that will accept zero compromise and won't stop being a pain in the ass until they're presented with their own personal idea of the ideal solution.

Normal environmentalists would look at a high speed rail system and approve because it's arguably the mode of transportation that provides the best balance between the lowest amount of harm to the environment, number of people transported, distance transported, and time to destination.

But then you get people who're ~~fucking morons~~ *pseudo-religious zealots* who get butthurt because it'll disrupt the microbes in the soil or some crazy shit like that.

And that's not even getting into factionalism.

Every group is ultimately split into a potentially infinite number of smaller groups, and one person might be part of multiple---So much so that a venn diagram depicting the internal factions might look like squiggly lines.

I'll use myself as an example. I think environmentalism is important. I think plastics are wildly inferior to metal and wood for nearly every purpose. I think protecting bio-diversity is one of the most important current issues.

But, I dislike greta thunberg and I think her most vocal supporters are pea-brained morons no different than bible thumpers screaming about the rapture. If you showed me a picture of her and a picture of [Harold Camping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Camping), I wouldn't see any meaningful difference between the two doomsayers.

I also think fishing licenses are fucking stupid no matter what cause that's presented as justification. Same for any other environmental law or policy that involves oppressing the liberties of the individual.

If it's not obvious by that last bit, my priorities and philosophies align pretty heavily with libertarian thought.

But, I also disagree with a lot of other libertarians because I believe that corporations are a form of government just like republics, oligarchies, monarchies, autocracies, theocracies, etc and that only abject morons think there's any sweeping difference between them, as it's been proven time and time again by the likes of the dutch east india company, tencent, etc that such giant companies are perfectly at home operating as wings of a pre-existing government.

Immediately out of the gate, I formed alliances with Asturias, Lombardy, and West Francia and hired a 1500 unit, 150g upfront, 6gpt mercenary band which I never let drop. 

Declared a holy war for barcelona and got really lucky in kidnapping a few women, whose husbands were now landless so I killed the men, married a woman, secretly converted to sunni

From there I spent a tiny bit of time giving as much of the now-unified kingdom of west francia sympathies to muslims attempting to induct people into the secret society over time.

After repeated failures over several years, I said fuck it and repped islam openly and hired another mercenary band for a total of about 2900 units for about 11gpt

Because Charlemagne's successor was *very* unpopular and they hadn't yet implented any revocation laws I was able to befriend him by joining all his wars and sending my chancellor to persuade him.

In the meantime, I spammed muslim conquest non-stop on everyone I could using my mercenaries and whatever allies could make it in time.

By the time he managed to get revocation approved, He had nearly 100 opinion toward me *and* I'd married off all my sons and daughters to form alliances with the Umayyads, Abbassids, and the armenians as well as a few other smaller realms so I was safe, worst come to worse.

And I'd managed to gain a favor, which I ultimately used to press him into going to war for my claims in lombardy.

Shortly after my demon spawn started voiding my alliances, I got lucky and a faction rebellion popped and I took my opportunity for my own independence war which was easily won with a 15k doomstack protecting my land.

And after that I just bid my time until my demon spawn came of age, which you see there---and sadly he fucking swapped from berber to Lombard (Nice's culture, I'd granted him it to guarantee him as my successor when I thought I was for sure dead... until RNG cured my cancer and infected wound on a garbage doctor's experimental treatment) so I wasn't able to abuse raiding like I'd hoped to.

But after that... shit got fucky when I got lucky.

First off, sometime after I finally usurped the kingdom of burgundy from my former liege (it took so long for him to stop being in perpetual defensive wars I was able to murder my way to leader of lucifer's own in that time) I accidentally shattered the Abbasid empire when I called them to war and the shia uprising occurred while 13k of their troops were in france. RIP.

But, by some miraculous stroke of luck... The Sunni Caliph was an independent duke... who also happened to be an initiate of lucifer's own.

So, I did what any sane son of satan would do and demanded that his service as my vassal, and immediately conscripted him to kill all his remaining pretenders while I pelted them with plague, rabies, and dysentery just to expedite the process.

And yeaaaaaaaaaah, turns out the caliphate works like any other title and goes to your liege when you die with no other valid hereditary heirs.

Even when they were financially stable, he and my grandmother still raised my mother and my uncles on beenie weenies, frito pie, stone soup and home-made pot pies because they were cheap to make in large amounts and if it wasn't the cheapest available option, he wasn't spending any money on it."

Trust me, I'm 100% on-board with SOCIAL MEDIA BAD because social media as a format gives far too much power and influence to narcissists and virtue signalers, but that bit about black dogs and camera just seems too ""perfect"" if that makes any sense.

The kernel of truth in it is that even good cameras often fail to pick up dark features in suboptimal lighting

The emotionally manipulative part is that being cruel/neglectful to animals is such a ruthlessly efficient way to paint someone as exceedingly evil that it's a literary cliche associated with lazy or poor writers who lack the subtlety to more skillfully write a villain [(or when you just want to get straight to the point)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNLu5g6xywQ)

And it doesn't seem rational to me that people so deeply narcissistic and un-empathetic that they'd discard their pet over being unphotogenic would comprise a large enough portion of prospective pet owners to have such a dramatic impact on the type of pets in pounds given both

- The amount of care and attention a pet would need to look appealing on social media (something such a narcissistic, self-centered person would not be likely to give to begin with)

- The sheer number of other reasons why an animal would end up in the local pound/adoption center

So it just seems like something that was collectively crafted to reaffirm the pre-existing beliefs of people (like myself) who dislike social media and the people who make up its core users."

Can't exactly be around to be a father for your children if your sentence is being inflated by 150~300% (or more) just because you're a dude.

Then tag on the extra 10~20% for being black or 5~10% for being latino and it gets even worse (That shits probably multiplicative not additive)

With how hard the legal system fucks over and exploits men, it's not suprising at all that these kids' only exposure to something resembling a father figure is a group of slightly older fatherless boys who were also themselves raised by another group of slightly older fatherless boys.

But you bet your ass women with young children will get leniency for their childrens' sake but is that same kindness ever extended to men? Fuck no, society has spent the last 50 years painting men as useless dumb idiots that're inferior to women so they're sure as shit not gonna extend any kindness to an untermensch, especially not when that untermensch can be farmed for $3 packages of 10 cent ramen noodles."

No point in renting another building that may or may not be equipped for the task when you already have one that's fully equipped and just sitting there.

Another thing that might factor in is that a lot of giant stadiums have deals with various major fast food and alchohol brands to have kiosks set up inside the stadium so it's probably better for business relations with those companies if they make use of those storefronts more often.

The stadiums are probably also better equipped for fluctuations in crowd size so on the off chance they have an abnormally large number of attendees they'll still have seats to sell."

A subreddit popped up dedicated to identifying the bombers and it ultimately led to one of them being misidentified as a guy who had been missing since before the bombing (and was later found dead in a river, having killed himself before the bombing even happened)

After reddit pinned it on the guy, various members of the subreddit harassed his parents---and worse, tons of news outlets (some mainstream, some alternative, all of them garbage vultures) reported reddit's findings as facts resulting in further trauma for them.

[And to top it all off, this directly resulted in the officials investigating the bombers to publically release their own information on the bombers' identities in order to stop the vigilanteism.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/inside-the-investigation-of-the-boston-marathon-bombing/2013/04/20/19d8c322-a8ff-11e2-b029-8fb7e977ef71_print.html?noredirect=on)

Which had the unfortunate effect of *tipping off the bombers that the feds were on their trail* resulting in them escaping in a panic and killing an MIT campus cop in the process.
