Why me? Well, it just so happened that the concierge got stuck in it in-between floors and I just happened to hear him going to my friends' grandparents place (my neighbor) who lived right below us.  

Yea, it did not look as clean and shiny as the movies.."

You don't ""own"" anyone so stop acting like if you date them you can control every aspect of their life. If you're that insecure with yourself that you think shes gonna cheat on you every single chance she gets you really need to take a step back and take a good look into yourself and contemplate why you feel that way."

AskReddit,fdqn361,t3_ejr5rg,1578670564.0,"firstly a BIG thanks üôèüèª to OP- these are the kind of cultural gems hidden away from society for in their superficial markers and completely unanimous truths lie most realities of life for people around the world.  

second, i believe in as far as i‚Äôve experienced similar in life that this must be directly proportional to nurture, experience of age but perhaps the only independent factor: education 


For, I have never even come close to setting a ‚Äòvillage on fire‚Äô for warmth and yet have set my soul on the pyre to burn many a time.  

look deep into my heart and you will find the coals in their constant glow, embers that fly about, and a pulsing heart always ready for more oxygen, always happiest to burst asunder and upon the world like a phoenix riding atop the sun. 

(just trying to say i find in me via my trials , love enough for perpetual warmth and still recognize the search for more warmth is necessary outside and of this ...hot tip lol...the plato-nic kind seems to work best üòç)"
