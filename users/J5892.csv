I grew up liking male hobbies, and had no interest in ""girly"" things.  
I wasn't super into sports, but I played them and had fun. And things like playing with dolls, sewing, baking, dance, etc. all seemed boring to me (at the time).

That's an interesting point. I never thought about my sex or gender as I made decisions growing up either, but even as early as kindergarten, I noticed the decisions I made were very different from those of other boys. I know that I liked a lot of the things I liked because I simply thought I was supposed to. And I definitely suppressed a lot of my more feminine natural mannerisms because I was terrified of kids thinking I was gay. I even consciously lowered my voice because people on the phone always thought I was a girl.

Cringetopia,feavc8d,t1_fearipm,1578952535.0,"To be honest, I have a lot of the same reservations here that you do (or I did, or still do. I don't know).  
But the main thing to consider is the difference between ""gender"" and ""sex"".  
From the [WHO page on gender](https://www.who.int/health-topics/gender):
""Gender refers to the roles, behaviours, activities, attributes and opportunities that any society considers appropriate for girls and boys, and women and men. Gender interacts with, but is different from, the binary categories of biological sex.""  
  
As for the pink thing, it started as a way to rebel against gender stereotypes before I was really aware of my gender identity. But now I just like it. It's kind of a tiny way to express my identity, but mostly I just like having pink hair.  
  
The reason this matters is that ""male"" and ""female"" as genders (not sexes) are both very well-defined. Even outside of stereotypes.  
  
But in everyday life. All that really matters is that I know who I am, and accept it."
Cringetopia,feas7hu,t1_feapmg4,1578951780.0,"Thank you. You're much better at describing this stuff than I am. :)  
  
Also, my experience of discovering my identity is basically exactly the same as yours."
Cringetopia,feao47g,t1_feaivm5,1578950755.0,"I think the goal of many of the more specific gender labels is to find a sense of community, and for people to feel less like they're alone in their feelings/identity. So in that way, I don't believe that they will be fully unnecessary in a future where gender is much less important in general.  
  
As for my experience, I did enjoy mostly ""boy"" activities growing up, and I did have male friends that I enjoyed spending time with. But on a conversational level, I couldn't (and still can't) really hold a conversation with most guys I knew, and I had trouble finding a sense of... brotherhood, I guess. Whereas with girls/women, that has never been a problem. I tend to have more meaningful/extended conversations and feel stronger connections with them, even if our general interests don't really align. So all else being equal, I still feel like I would feel a stronger platonic connection with women than men.  
  
As for children, I can't offer much advice there. Growing up in a fairly closed off Catholic household, my parents didn't even consider this kind of thing. But they were generally open and accepting about how I lived my life."
Cringetopia,feaiaqt,t1_feadyhx,1578949122.0,"Presenting refers to your outward appearance.
It means that my outward appearance is male, and not androgynous. But I don't identify as male or female.  
  
This is opposed to a non-binary person who alters their appearance in some way to match their identity (clothing, makeup, chest/genital binding, etc.)."
Cringetopia,feagy0i,t1_fead1jy,1578948609.0,"Well, that's an extremely complex series of hypotheticals.  
You're basically envisioning a world where the entire concept of gender is completely removed. So in some way, yes, it would be obsolete because *all* gender would be obsolete. And I couldn't answer your last question, because the concept of ""cisgender"" would not exist.  
  
But the problem is I don't know if that's possible, even if we eliminated stereotypes and gendered culture altogether, because gender is simply a natural thing. Being non-binary (at least for me, and I suspect for most others) is not just about not conforming to gender stereotypes. It's a more complex internal identity.  
But if the concept of gender were removed from the world completely? I honestly don't know if I would see enough of a difference in my own identity to require giving it a label.  
  
Edit: And sorry, I know that doesn't really answer your question. But it's the best I can do. Someone who has done more research, or just has more experience discussing these things, may be better suited to answer it."

Cringetopia,fe9sfco,t1_fe9orxb,1578941049.0,"Because labels serve a purpose.

It's much easier to say ""I'm non-binary"". And they'll be like ""Oh, cool."" And life goes on.  
  
I also don't consider myself ""liberal"", but if someone asks me what my political leaning is, I'm not going to list every one of my views. I'm going to say ""mostly liberal"".

I haven't once stated that I consider myself LGBTQ+, as that is one of my personal struggles.

This is despite the fact that all of my LGBTQ+ friends accept me as such, and several have told me to stop second-guessing myself about it.  
  
As for the attention thing, I don't discuss my gender identity with anyone who doesn't specifically ask about it. Most of my family and coworkers (and some friends) have no idea that I'm non-binary. And I'm fine with that.  
  
Now, if you consider my identity to be ""random bullshit"", that is your right. But just know that I consider you to be a bigoted fuck. But don't worry. I don't think you're a homophobe."

I accept general male terms like ""guy"", but I will always correct someone if they refer to me as a man.  
  
On a deeper level, growing up I could never fully relate to my male friends. I always formed much deeper platonic connections with girls. I knew I wasn't gay, but I always had a sense that it wasn't that simple. Around late high school/early college years I accepted that I'll never consider myself a ""man"". And later in life, when I discovered online communities discussing alternative genders, I felt a strong connection to their stories.  
I never got on board with the myriad extremely specific gender terms (though I accept whatever anyone identifies with), but ""non-binary"" felt like it fit me.  
It wasn't until a couple years ago that I fully accepted the term and outwardly identified as non-binary.  
  
edit: As a more specific answer to your question about how I feel: I feel both. Not fully either male or female, but I definitely lean more towards female. But the only external hint of that is my hair color (pink) and an occasionally slightly feminine clothing style."
