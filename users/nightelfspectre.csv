My best All node comp was still pretty variable, usually 4-5t with a chance of 6-7t if I got bad card RNG and/or Ruler Jeanne. Grailed Archer Gil, Fran, Arash w/MLB IE, Merlin, borrowed Waver.

I finished leveling several Servants and made good progress on skills. I also have nearly all of the mats (and some of the QP) to raise my SR ticket pick (Penth) on day 1.

Given how awkward the All node could be for me, I feel I did alright as a casual player."

It’s possible OP meant SSDI, which is based on your work history much like Social Security retirement is.

AskReddit,feltzgg,t1_fektpmr,1579230886.0,"It was in my lumbar spine. A 4-5hr surgery became around 7-8hr, thanks to the embedded nerves. 

The first thing I did upon waking was croak (breathing tube = scraped throat) a complaint about the pain and pass back out, because those nerves felt like they were on fire. The muscle spasms prevented any real attempt at standing until they were addressed. In the meantime, I was griped at every time the pain made me cry out when I was moved, as though I should be able to suffer in silence."

AskReddit,fejfuij,t3_epfjje,1579172209.0,"Spinal surgery.

There was a tumor on my spinal cord. The tumor was benign, but there is a finite amount of space in the spinal canal and I had already been in (sciatic) pain for years because it went undetected for a long time. It was apparent that the cursed thing had to come out, but the surgeon and I hoped for the best case scenario of it being encapsulated and relatively easy to remove.

It was not. 

Instead the nerves at the top of the cauda equina were embedded through it, requiring my surgeon to peel away the tumor in layers. I have very little memory of the first few days after that surgery. It’s just a haze of pain. My nerves seemed keenly aware that they had been manipulated, and trying to move caused my back to spasm. When you have stitches in, this feels like your body is trying to literally tear itself apart.

The first time they made me try to stand post-op, it hurt so badly that I almost passed out on the spot. I still remember how the edges of my vision went black, like I was looking down a tunnel.  And I also had to be turned over every few hours. Yeah. Fun stuff. I didn’t make progress on walking post-op until pain management added gabapentin and a muscle relaxer."
