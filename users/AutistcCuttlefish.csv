politics,ff41eq5,t1_ff25ox7,1579553440.0,"The 14th amendment clarifies that the rights of citizenship shall not be kept from any citizen. It doesn't change the naturalized citizenship requirement for the presidency nor does it eliminate the 12th amendment requirement that the VP be eligible for the presidency. 

What it does provide however is a possible method of overriding such a requirement, but we'd have to stretch the 14th a bit for this purpose: 

section 3 of the 14th amendment 

>No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any state legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any state, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. **But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability**. 

(emphasis mine)

So theoretically, it might be possible to permit a VP that is not normally eligible for the presidency to be the VP / qualify for the presidency, but only with a supermajority vote from both the House and the Senate. 

That's assuming the supreme court would even permit that interpretation."

fatlogic,ff3k6st,t1_ff2zq2e,1579542792.0,"Yeah I remember playing outside when I was a kid. One day my mom told us we couldn't play outside unless dad watched us and we had to stay in the yard. 

We barely had a yard. It was like 4x5ft Max. The neighbor kids had a yard but we effectively weren't allowed to play with them because dad worked nights so he was always asleep when we wanted to go play with them. 

Apparently she looked at the sex offender registery online and saw 3 people within a 10 mile radius of us were on it. She freaked out and decided no more outdoor playtime for us.

My sister being the more sociable one managed to make friends and my parents met theirs and trusted 'em. Me? I had a hard enough time not getting mocked and bullied by the other kids. Making friends was nearly impossible. So I just stayed home and played games most of the time. 

No wonder I got obese while she is ""merely"" overweight. 

I've been trying to lose weight, and while I've had some success, it's really hard to overcome 20 years of ingrained habits regarding eating and physical activity. 

I try not to get mad with my mom for giving me fast food nearly everytime I wanted it, or letting me get a supersized meal when I wasn't even a teen yet or any of the other things she did. She did them because she loved us and didn't want to abuse us like parents did with her. 

She definitely meant well, she just overcorrected."

Games,ff1omkr,t1_ff0n41m,1579482742.0,"I used to be one of the people who was excited for gaming to become mainstream. Now I'm more upset about it because video gaming going mainstream hasn't had many good consequences. 

The best thing it did was make games less sexist. However we've also seen entire genres get nerfed and over simplified for the sake of broader appeal. Hell some genres have just fucking died. You can't find a good RTS that was made in the last 3 years. We've seen mobile games and a massive increase in the number of utterly shit games being pumped out at massive rates. We've seen lootboxes, dlc and horse armor become the norm. All thanks to this mainstreaming of video games. 

When streaming becomes the only option left, and based on the trends in movies and music it *will* be the only option left if it is viable, the game modding scene will die. Piracy will die. Replaying your favorite childhood game? That'll die too. When a game dev goes out of business and the contact to have the game on the streaming platform dies all of those games will simply disappear. 

Game Streaming will make games like Minecraft and Skyrim that got popular in part because of their fantastic modding communities will never again exist. Because you can't modify a game without access to it's files and uploading your gameplay to YouTube will be difficult when you've eaten through your data cap because you had to stream the game you played. 

Much of what made the last decade of gaming so great isn't going to continue in the era of Stadia and xCloud. All of the growing negatives will continue to grow as Stadia and xCloud will make them easier for devs to push. Imagine how much more dlc you can sell if there's no barrier to it. One minute your in game and you run across a locked questline. You just get a popup and click okay and boom. Your card is charged the 9.99 and you instantly get the keep playing the locked quest. When it's that frictionless you'll start seeing more and more devs and publishers using their games as dlc selling platforms instead of making good games. 

Gaming as we know it will die. All so people can keep playing on a phone screen that's too small to actually enjoy the game on and so people who can't afford it lack a decent Internet connection capable of streaming the game can maybe play since they don't need a console."

That's a wager you'll lose. The GOP cares only for its own power. Their base cares only for ""owning the libs"". Their base will turn against the Republicans if they do anything to hurt Trump. 

There will be no trial. Trump will be acquitted on party lines, and the GOP's base will cheer. To go anything else would break the GOP. Fox News, Conservative Media, and Republican Party worked hard to indoctrinated their members for the last three decades.

This is false. They are using WhatsApp first, this stuff is secondary. 

> So they can easily implement a 2 tier system

Again nope. If that was the case the DoD would be completely silent on the issue. However the DoD repeatedly cities the need to protect low level information that is often stored on iPhone's of contractors. Snowden was a contractor, Manning breached air gapped systems, and we've repeatedly seen cases where major incidents came from both too secret data getting stolen and unclassified information getting published broadly. 

A two tiered system would be devastating for the government even if it's too stupid to realize it. However its not just government that is important to national security. Information was stolen from a bankers iPhone can be used to get deeper access into a banks network, drain financial accounts or just add a few zeros to the number of dollars in existence digitally. A two tiered system needs to give strong encryption to millions of people 

> I think you put too much value on metadata whereas in reality it's not as important as they make it seem to be.

I think you significantly undervalued it. Metadata puts a person at the scene of a crime or gives them an alabi, metadata reveals acquaintances and who's in frequent contact with an individual. Metadata can make or break criminal investigations. That's besides the point though as most metadata isn't even protected by encryption anyway. 

> The only thing they care about is the raw secrets, which are kept in very secure airgapped locations with complete surveillance, laser alarms, like Mission Impossible type difficulty facilities. And those are not getting leaked.

First, Chelsea Manning would like to have a word with you.. Second, not all sensitive information is a raw secret. Sensitive government and business communication, as I've been trying to hammer home here, is just as important to protect for the purposes of national security. And to protect that adequetely millions of Americans would need to be given exemptions, those in the vital industries of electrical infrastructure, fianance, ISPs, the military industrial complex, and the major silicon valley companies. Americas economy is its greatest strength, it's military is second because the only reason the nation can afford such a powerful military is the strength of our economy. Implementing backdors into devices like that is to simply open the door for blackhats, foreign adversaries, and terrorists and invite them to curb stomp us until we can't move anymore."
