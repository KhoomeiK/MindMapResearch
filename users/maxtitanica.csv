IdiotsInCars,ff8fifs,t1_ff69s9t,1579676238.0,Totally. They don’t feel your rage. It does literally nothing. Also in my experience you can flip someone off but they don’t even know they did something wrong and flip you off right back. So unless you plan on pulling over and having a civilized conversation with pictographs that aren’t guides from r/coolguides to back up your point then you’re just endangering yourself and everyone else much like the person you are trying to chastise.

Keep your eyes on the road. The person you gave the finger too isn’t at home thinking “boy I should change my driving habits”. Literally all it did was further out yourself in danger. Now say if you laid on the horn you would have got your point across and been safe.

rpg_gamers,fevtgkh,t1_feknkyk,1579401273.0,"Word of mouth to a degree. I personally don’t take the opinion of some dude I’ve never met on whether or not I’ll like a game. They don’t know me or why I play and enjoy games.

That said I’m all for delays. Honestly I could do without scheduled release date and a bunch of hype. I remember 10-15 years ago or longer games would just say Q3 release date until it was like a few weeks away. No joke my favourite games have been ones I knew zero about going in: Mass effect trilogy(specifically 2 as I didn’t know there was a sequel and found it used for 12 bucks), persona 5, rayman legends, dark souls, xcom enemy unknown etc. Knowing everything about a game before it comes out wrecks it. Nobody does that with movies; researches all the cameos and jokes and features. You watch a thirty second trailer and decide if you want to see it or not.

And preorders gave you something cool that was physical and not just automatic win armour. I preordered windwaker on GC and got four Zelda games with it. And they actually had limited copies of games then. Now there’s literally thousands in every store on release date."

Generally on shows like that they show the video then bring the guest out so people can cheer or boo. They aren’t just on stage already.

aww,feu0lk6,t1_fesb7k1,1579381948.0,"While yes filming it for profit is absolutely awful; bums do this kind of stuff all the time for much less. I was downtown Vancouver in gastown about four years ago to see a friends band play and outside the lamplighter a homeless gentleman offered to light his hair on fire for 25 cents. 

I had an idea prior to bum fights being a thing where I’d go around and offer them cheeseburgers to hear their tale of how they got there and whatnot. Never got around to it. Partially because I saw a homeless guy with a spare change sign but I had no change so I gave him my sandwich. He threw it on the ground and stomped on it because “I can’t buy anything(drugs) with that). I was delivering drywall at the time and really wanted that sandwich."
AnimalCrossing,fetresq,t1_fetr7m4,1579378883.0,Exactly. I meant post history and comments though sorry. So yeah as soon as NH comes out you won’t ever mention it again. Maybe briefly when someone gets their first froggy chair in NH but then it’ll die like all the other memes you like and the pictures that are just pictures that you think are memes somehow.
AnimalCrossing,fetr4nk,t1_fesim5c,1579378678.0,Yeah you will. You probably weren’t nearly as into froggy chair until it became a thing. (Hold up lemme check your post history going back a month or so and let’s see)Then a new thing will happen as froggy chair doesn’t garner attention anymore and you’ll move to that.

Search bookstore Munich dog then hit images click on Emma and you have your answer. Not my fault you guys are extremely lazy and incapable of using the thing that never leaves your hand.
