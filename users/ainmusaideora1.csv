I think there's no better place for them to be then with the family! Maybe that's why I've held onto them for so long.

I bet my boyfriend also can donate a bunch of stuff

I also have some furniture that I might be able to donate, do they need that as well rn?

I can't make any promises but if there are people who have stuff to donate but don't have a car, I would be happy to drive around one day and pick up their stuff and drop it off whenever they need it.

I don't know where they are staying but if its easier I could drop it off right to them. But I don't know how these things work and they very well might want their privacy. Thank you for posting this to reddit so more people know how to help!"

socialskills,feg8tbl,t3_eowb15,1579082553.0,"Please don't let other people's actions *ever* make you feel like you don't deserve something, especially friendship. You absolutely deserve it. 

This happens to so many people but who really talks about how unpopular they feel? 


Okay this is a long post, but it really resonated with me and I never want you to feel the way you're feeling ever again.


A while ago I was in a very similar situation where I was becoming apart of new friends groups but never seemed to be apart of the core group. It made me really sad for a while and question what was wrong with me. Why wasn't I good enough to be wanted, why was I always a side thought?


I broke down one day feeling like I had no friends and like you said, didn't deserve any. My SO sat down with me and told me his personal experiences feeling the same way. His realizations were that its a good thing he wasn't apart of the core groups because there were some things that he didnt relate to or didn't love that they did. For me this resonated with one of my groups of friends that they can be judgemental which I have no tolerance for. So me not being invited was a good thing, they have days where they just want to be their judgmental selves and I don't have to be there for it. Eventually I realized they're just shitty people and bad friends, even to each other.


I took this realization a step further by thinking, maybe if im having a bad day others around me are too and this is apart of why im not invited to things. Guess what? I was right. I started to go into work and just ask people how they really were. If they seemed less like themselves when we first started to be friends, I asked them how they were doing because their energy seemed off lately (that's just how I talk, you have to find what works for you.) And I got honest answers everytime. Sometimes people were going through things others were just in a good ol fashioned funk.


They weren't able to look outside of themselves and see how their actions or lack of actions might be making people feel. 

Once I realized how many people felt like me it became so much easier to see the bigger picture. It really isn't me, its them. Cliche I know.

The real ones appreciated it and we became better friends and slowly the non real ones faded away. I got a huge reality check and confidence boost.


The crazy thing was a few months down the road I had several friends go through the exact same thing. We talked and they got a new reality too. Also, these were the ones I thought were popular and would never have felt this way. So it effects everybody, you're not alone :)

If you continue to feel this way or have another day in the future, please reach out again. No one should ever feel they aren't worthy of friendship."

If not, give them leather toys they can chew on so those satiate that need. When you see them chewing on the couch, remove them and give them what they're supposed to have. When they play with toy they are supposed to be chewing, give them a special treat. Meat, cheese, organic human baby food (only ingredients should be beef and beef broth or chicken and chicken broth), etc. 

Google the okay meets, cheeses, dairy, ect. Items that are okay for cats. Not all of them are. Raw meet is good for them (if your worried about salmonella, don't get ground meet, but from what I've read they process food too fast to get most food born illness).

Actually, raw meet might also help a lot. They need to chew quite a bit and that might tired our your cats jaw. We give ours a few pieces of steak and her coat is noticeably better. It is so shinny and healthy, plus raw meet cleans their teeth. 

(Dry food actually creates teeth problems since they are mostly carbs and that breaks down into sugar, but I digress)

Good website for nutrition and research articles is catnutrition.org

Edit: a lot of people ive talked to before might not think cats need something as nice as steak but in the long run it'll make your cat happier and healthier which means spending less money on vet bills in the long run.

Edit no. 2: come to think of it, my cat stopped chewing random things around the house once we started to give her raw meet."

CatTraining,fdc3su6,t3_ei9va9,1578266550.0,"This is amazing ðŸ˜‚ and honestly training gold. Instead of giving your cat a treat when they do what you want, you can spray them. 

Cats do not do well with adversives. If your cat did hate it, the spraying is actually a terrible way to train. It makes your cat resent and not trust you, which then creates more problem behaviors. So training cats has become much easier now that we know to only use positive outcomes. If your cat truly enjoys being sprayed however, when they do what you want he can get a spray lol not the other way around.

However, how do you know he likes it?
Also how old is he/she?

So you could try tin foil, some cats hate the sound or feeling.

Otherwise the reason the cats want to be on the counters is that they want to be by you and are curious as to what youre doing. So you just have to give them some place they are both able to watch you and can be on.

From there it takes some time and patience. One way is to always just pick them up and place them on where they're supposed to be. If they jump there first, give them praise and a treat.
 You can sometimes give them a treat after you pick them up and place them there but SPARINGLY. They are smart and realize ""oh i jump up here, she places me there, then treat!"" You don't want this connection to happen, it will make your life more difficult.

You can also use a special treat when they jump on where their supposed to be first (lets say a cat tree). For example you might have dry bag of treats for everyday being cute tax and some for doing a great job. If they clearly like two different brands but one more than the other, their number 1 choice is when they sit on said cat tree first. Number 2 treat is only used if you have to pick them up and place them there (but again not every time!).
If they don't have a clear preference, some lunch meat, cheese, puree cat treats, etc. Can be used as their number 1 choice in example above. But always the normal cat treats if they have to be placed there.

The onlyyy exemption from those rules is the first handful of times you pick them up and place on cat tree. You want to make that spot more reinforcing then satisfying their curiosity is so it would be okay for some treat 1 when you pick them up and place them there. So say you pick them up and place on cat tree 15 times, 4 or 5 of those can be given an awesome treat. Once they jump on cat tree themselves, no more treat 1 unless they do it on their own. 
Does that make sense? I can get a bit wordy at times. I can definitely go more into it.

To take this a step further, you can clicker train. I would be happy to go more in depth with an explanation and resources if you are interested :)

Cats are smart creatures and I honestly believe they know what we want but it's a matter of making them want it too haha. I like to talk to my cats like they understand me too, I think it helps. It certainly doesn't hurt.

If you do want to trim them however, don't grab the whole paw and push all claws out. You're touching the fur in between their toes and it either tickles or they don't like it.
 It helps a lot if you can do it when they're already relaxed, then try and push each bean individually. Give a treat in between cuts depending on how sensitive or gtfo off me they are.  
Even when you're not trying to cut them, pushing on them/touching their toes randomly then giving them a special treat desensitizes them so its not a big deal.
