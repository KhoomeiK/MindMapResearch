Alright so ruling out the ice capes melting, meteors becoming crashed into us, the ozone layer leaving, and the sun exploding... we’re definitely going to blow ourselves up. 

Ho-Kai, so basically we have China, France, India, Iss-RAY-el, Pakistan, Russia, the UK, and US... with nukes... we goddabout 2600 more dan anybody else... whatever

Anyway one day, we decide “Dose Chinese sons of a bitches... are going down” so we launch at China. 

While it’s on its way, China’s like “Shit shit! Who da fuck is shooting us?? Oh well, fire missiles!”

Then France is like “Shit guys, we got ~~cigarettes~~ ze meesells zey are coming! Fire our shit!

But I am le tired...

Well, have a nap ZEN FIRE ZE MISSILES!!!”

Meanwhile, Australia is down there like “WTF mate?”

India, Iss-RAY-el, and Pakistan launch their shit, so now we got missiles flying everywhere. 

Russia’s like “AAAAAAAHHHH MOTHERLAND!!!”

Then England’s like “‘Bout that time, eh chaps?”

“Right-o”

So now the US is like “Fuck, we’re dumbasses”

Canada’s like “What’s going on, eh”

And Australia is still down there like “WTF?”

Mars is laughing at us and some huge meteor’s like “Well fuck that”

So, now we have nuclear winter. 

(Phlegm)-everyone’s dead except Australia and they’re still like “wtf?”

...

But they’ll be dead soon (scribbling)

^fucking ^kangaroos

So, assuming we don’t blow ourselves up, us Californians just have to worry about California breaking off from the United States... to go hang with Hawaii... Alaska can come too

THE EEEYYNNND!

Edit: yes I have no life.

Edit 2: apparently it’s WRONG! Not ROUND!"

yesyesyesyesno,fen9fku,t1_femwx84,1579279851.0,"Similar story though not as scary. 

A little backstory: I live in Texas, where cockroaches get to be about 2-3 inches long and fucking fly. Also, my mom is from Mexcio City where roaches are about the size roly-polies, so naturally, she would scream bloody murder and hop around like she was standing on a skillet whenever she encountered a Texas roach. As you can imagine, her fear of roaches kinda rubbed off on me.

We all up to speed? Good!

So one evening when I was around maybe 10 years old, my mom, my sister, and I were watching tv on my mom's bed when I felt an itch on the back right side of my neck. 

Since my mom had down pillows whose feather were known to occasionally stick out and poke you, I assumed that's what was going on and just brushed it off. 

But then I felt the itch again... 

and again... 

and again... 

Until the fourth or fifth itch where when I reached back to scratch my neck, I saw this big-ass fucker of a roach run its ugly ass all the way from my neck to my right thigh and fly off!!!

Well let me tell you that the next thing I remember, I was in my shower scrubbing every piece of me furiously and screaming with the same level of disgust!

So yeah I'm not too fond of cockroaches."
