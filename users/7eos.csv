Sims4,fej6hz4,t3_epcb5q,1579158893.0,"Hi, I’m cis so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I know that there are options where you can change things such as whether or not a sim has a penis (I’m not sure if this is from Wicked Whims or basegame), can get pregnant/get others pregnant, their clothing preference, and their “frame”. I know that doesn’t cover the full experience of being trans or non-binary though. I’m working on a project that requires me to make a lot of sims, and when I have made trans or non-binary sims (or any other LGBTQ+ sim) I will manipulate these settings so that their gender expression and genitalia are “different” if they are have not transitioned, or just make them using the “body frame” that’s typically associated with their gender identity to imply that they have had gender reassignment surgery. When it comes to sims with LGBTQ+ sexualities, I just adjust their attraction preferences in Wicked Whims to accommodate what sexes and gender presentations they prefer, hang pride flags in their rooms, and only have them flirt with sims that they’d be into.
Still, this feels insufficient to me. I hope that trans and non-binary people will have opportunities to inform EA of how they can be more inclusive to your community. I just don’t know if you knew about those gender settings, but still, more needs to be in place."
