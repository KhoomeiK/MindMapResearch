submechanophobia,feycj9n,t3_eqqh7k,1579443758.0,No thank you.
terfisaslur,feybvqs,t1_few0y6s,1579443460.0,"Yes!!! This is great thank you so much.
I haven‚Äôt been called a terf on Reddit but I have on Twitter and sadly twitter seem to suspend ppl who talk about against this nonsense."
aww,feybb9t,t3_eqtkzo,1579443198.0,Thank you to you and your cat!
youseeingthisshit,fes55yy,t1_fes43o1,1579361487.0,Hot Fuzz! Although dogs do need to move their heads more than us to look up. Apparently I read somewhere penguins can‚Äôt look up without falling over. I‚Äôve not come across as many penguins as dogs.

Noses,ferw0rj,t1_fervual,1579358959.0,"You look fairly young, it does get better. I‚Äôm still not a fan of mine but I‚Äôve made it to my mid 30s and in general I accept myself flaws and all a lot more than I ever used to."
Noses,fervdo5,t1_feqemo1,1579358709.0,"I know what it‚Äôs like to hate your nose and smile as I am not a fan of mine but honestly you are lovely and those that love us see our beauty.

Instagramreality,feqcsgj,t1_feqb1ig,1579340184.0,"Mine doesn‚Äôt seem to follow a pattern of when it is most clear but it is always worse around my period.
I take antibiotics and have special creams which do help as I think mine is cystic acne and without the tablets it‚Äôs really painful. 

Here is to us one day growing out of it!"

aww,fenvee1,t1_fenpgm7,1579291478.0,I‚Äôll take them both. He‚Äôs handsome and the cats adorable.
GenderCynicalCritical,fenhea9,t1_fen7oyn,1579284735.0,"Yeah I‚Äôve also been called a transphobe for that reason and for supporting women‚Äôs rights. 
I don‚Äôt want trans people to come to any harm and I certainly don‚Äôt wish them any violence, but trans rights activists would class me as a transphobe and the lovely person in this pic has made it clear what they‚Äôd do to us!"
Cringetopia,feb67ls,t3_eo8pts,1578955795.0,Periods happen to most women - biological women. We still have to fight to be taken seriously with issues related to our wombs.
fatlogic,feb43fu,t1_feaildp,1578955272.0,I didn‚Äôt lose weight when I gained muscle from running (although maybe I lost the fat over the muscles) but I was more toned and streamlined.

itsafetish,fc6jdlk,t3_egbyo6,1577481979.0,Saw this on twitter. The funny thing is my boyfriend wraps presents far better than I do. Clearly snorting HRT when I‚Äôm not around.
Noses,fc6j951,t1_fc5x9a3,1577481893.0,"Thank you! I think for me when I see famous women with big or strong noses they have the jaw lines to carry them off which I don‚Äôt, so I feel like I have the crap deal of having a larger nose.
As a child my mum used to say to me why did I want to look like everyone else as it was always neat to be unique and myself."
Noses,fc5bao1,t1_fc427f3,1577451976.0,"I don‚Äôt like mine either and it‚Äôs weird when other people don‚Äôt see what we see. You do look beautiful here but in terms of surgery, you do what feels right for you x"

Noses,fc3o3r6,t1_fc3l79h,1577394378.0,"What a kind message thank you! Very true as well! I take after my mother‚Äôs side of the family and one of my mums aunts who I haven‚Äôt seen in years said to me yesterday I have her nose- she looks great and it made me think well if it looks great on her why can‚Äôt I see it on me! My boyfriend thinks I‚Äôm beautiful and he has a prominent nose as well. We both joke our baby will be one big nose!
I think if my jaw was more ‚Äòstructured‚Äô I‚Äôd like it more but as you rightly say we are made to live life and there is beauty in everything. I love this sub as it shows the beauty in not fitting the mould."
