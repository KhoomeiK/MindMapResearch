psychology,fegmnqs,t1_fegae2b,1579097374.0,"What you fail to realize is there are people trapped in relationships with narcissistic people who feel it is their responsibility to stick with a person who actively hurts them.  No, they shouldn’t all die or flee the earth but it’s important to understand that while there exists therapies that can help, it is also ok to cut ties with a narcissist that continues to cause pain to those around them.  If you’re going to pursue any kind of relationship with a person with NPD you need to understand what you are getting into, and understand that if they violate your boundaries it’s ok to distance yourself from that person."
