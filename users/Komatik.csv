OneNote,ffalkv1,t3_es6fhg,1579738792.0,"For me the biggest thing is that it just doesn't handle page creation and scrolling desktop-made pages quite right.

All Android-made pages look a bit off on Win10 desktop, with the title stuck at the very top of the window, while pages created any other way leave some air between the border of the page window and the page title.

The oddball pages Android creates that way seem to scroll fine on Android, it's like there's an anchor that keeps it from scrolling too far left too easily. But desktop-created pages have that air in there, so there's more leeway to go to the left, which results in a very jittery scrolling experience. That makes reading articles on OneNote a pain.

Just solving those two bugs would make Android OneNote a much 
better experience for me, but I've given up hope on them ever getting fixed. Reported that shit two years ago, nothing, nada, zip.

Update after update of bug fixes and security updates, but not that one, nevermind actual features.

The interesting thing is that it's definitely something the Android app itself does: Their Quick Note button is bugged, and while it works right most of the time, sometimes it creates the new page but doesn't send you to it, and opens an already existing page instead. In those cases the new, blank page is *normal*."

science,ff7bf89,t1_ff61uhg,1579645491.0,"Yes, for everyone. To build the case from the ground up, it takes a certain amount of energy to heat up water a certain amount. It takes a certain amount of energy to move a kilogram of stuff a certain distance, sideways, up, whatever. Generating electricity takes a certain amount of energy. You can do all of these more and less efficiently (eg. there's a reason basically all of our power plants are pretty much glorified water boilers), but there's a minimum below which you just can't go.

We consist primarily of water that's hotter than the surrounding environment and thus has to be heated constantly, we're made of stuff and we move ourselves around. Hell, *within* us organs like the heart and the GI tract move stuff back and forth. Various parts of the body also generate and use electricity to transmit signals.

What this means is that there is a baseline amount of energy that a living thing needs to exist and it has a minimum is non-negotiable.

Furthermore, all of us use the same systems made from the same blueprints for the same functions since inheriting multiple different implementations of the same system is unreliable (imagine inheriting two halves of two different body temperature regulation systems and as a consequence having none) and has been weeded out ages ago. This means the rough efficiency of how our systems do those tasks mentioned above are more or less uniform - there may be small mileage differences in roughly identical cars, and a SUV will drink more than a small Kia - it's built of just plain more stuff so needs more energy to move, consists of more water to keep heated, and so on.

So we're pretty likely to all have roughly similar efficiencies for processes which definitely need energy to do. Doing those things, calories out. The energy has to come from somewhere or those things simply cannot physically happen, calories in. Failure is known as take the backup canister from the trunk (otherwise known as the fat that makes up the beer gut) or starving to death as the body-bot cannibalizes itself to try to function, and at some point can't and shuts down.

As far as the calories in part goes, people can and do have problems digesting their food completely and as a result don't get as much fuel out of it as healthy people - this typically means they can eat mountains of food but struggle to keep weight on.

The other direction, though, is impossible: The energy contained in food is contained in the chemical bonds between and in the molecules that constitute the food. As there is a minimum energy demand to the basic business of living, there is a ceiling to how much energy is stored in those bonds. You may eat more or less energy dense potatoes, but there's only so much energy a hundred pounds of starch can contain, and it is physically impossible for the body to extract more than that amount (and every single one of us obviously extracts less). Eat less, your intake goes down and the body has to make up the difference some other way.

This applies to absolutely everyone. There are complications that affect weight, that is true, and the same applies to medicine, but the mechanism by which those conditions cause weight gain is through that model of energy balance, or via things like retaining more water in the body. They may cause us to change the rate the body works at, eg. lowering body temp, or causing us to fidget less. These just mean it takes a little less energy to keep Stayin' Alive on the radio, not that you still don't need to provide for your body fuel for the things it does do. Another common mechanism for medical conditions and medication to affect weight is simply to affect your appetite. It's a lot harder to stay slim if your body keeps screaming for more - unnecessarily, but that's cold comfort when you feel like starving all the time (There's a rare genetic disorder called Prader-Willi that does do that).

In every case, the basic CICO mechanism still works, acting upon it may just feel horrible, or there may be few pounds of extra water and salt being retained, neither of which precludes losing weight via diet and exercise."

The dev team doesn't feel like it knows what kind of game it wants OW to be. Figure it out, decide on it, and start working towards that. One attraction to stuff like retro games and modern products like CS is that what you love, the game won't drastically depart from. That stability comes primarily from a vision, a dev team that knows what kind of game they're trying to build, what they want OW to look and feel like. That's missing. Flailing around aimlessly is bad, please switch to focused effort. 

Again, I don't care about speed. I like a slower pace to the patching so I can learn patches better. I can tough out bad patches if I know the dev team knows where they're going and is sane. That knows where they're going is a tad lacking in Blizzard as a whole.

As examples, Counter-Strike will likely be the same game, give or take, if you come back to it after a break that lasts years.

Diabotical is taking ages to release, are people that worried? Nah, 2GD knows what kind of game he wants to make, he's flailing around like a headless, retarded chicken (self-admittedly) but only within certain, narrow things. For the vast majority, the team knows the game they're building and where they want to end up at and make (usually smart) decisions accordingly. And it's not because they're geniuses, it's because they have a signpost for what the game should be like.

In SC2, near the end of WoL, I vividly remember a Terran player (WoL patchnotes almost always nerfed Terran) saying, during the depths of BLord-Infestor meta that they hate playing against Protoss and even though Zerg were bullshit strong and a player a notch below his caliber could go even with him, at least it felt like playing Starcraft.

It says volumes that the Terran player would prefer playing TvZ when Zerg was broken ten ways to Sunday. And the only reason was that they were too good at playing Starcraft. Protoss? The Terran player felt like SC2 Protoss didn't even play the same game because they broke so many conventions of what makes normal RTS econ/logistics work.

Key point: Balance on a spreadsheet is less important than sane game flow. Balance *is* important especially because this is a team game and we're partly responsible for our teammates' enjoyment which emphasizes sane picks more than 1v1.

science,fed5l31,t1_fe4b19a,1578999990.0,"> Even professionally administered IQ tests are primitive measures of intelligence. Intelligence tests are fine for practical purposes, but not for analytical ones. Too much unavoidable bias (not prejudice) is present: Any test-maker (not just IQ test-creators) must first develop standards upon which the test-takers will be judged. In other words, to test intelligence, the designer must formulate a definition of intelligence. Now, who could possibly do this?

This is a common misconception of how intelligence tests are built: The construct of general intelligence is not a decision by a pile of miscellaneous scientists. The tests have a measurable phenomenon behind them, and research has been done that shows that the general factors of different intelligence tests reflect the same thing, same as a bathroom scale and a balance scale measure the same thing about an object - its weight.

Test items can be (and are) chosen on how well they reflect people's standing on the general factor, they don't need to be chosen based on opinion of what ""seems intelligent"" - there are certain things we call ""smart"" in colloquial speech but aren't strongly related to the general factor or IQ test results. You don't need to whip up some definition and then a scale to purportedly test it. You can just check if your measure actually does what it is supposed to, and [we know how well many different kinds of tasks do it](https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:81300:20160505160114658-0484:51806fig21_2.gif?pub-status=live) (Data from L. L. Thurstone (1938). Plot coordinates from Snow,
Kyllonen, and Marshalek (1984) )

Part of the reason for the resistance mentioned above seems to be that people have some semi-romantic idea of what intelligence is, when it's increasingly looking like it's pretty much an efficiency/horsepower benchmark for the brain. Similarily, the performance of a computer or a car is a result of many, many things but we routinely sum it up as ""how fast is it"" or ""can it crunch this amount of data at all"" and measure those things as single numbers. Nobody complains that the benchmark number can't measure what they intend to, that there isn't such a thing as performance for a car or a computer, but all agree they're built up out of a lot of smaller things and the total picture is complicated. The physical basis of intelligence is just the same.

productivity,fdshazg,t3_emm8en,1578702740.0,"Moved my tasklist from MS To Do to Amazing Marvin earlier this week. It was possible to set it up so that it's basically To Do, but a bit more:     

* Can ""My Day"" future days so I can plan my tomorrow beforehand
* Full folder hierarchy - To Do went with List Groups, which probably is a dead-end tech debt solution behind the scenes a la Evernote's Stacks.
* Multiple levels of priority - this means I can easily Eisenhower tasks (orange/red = urgent, red/blue = important)
* Proper tagging system (don't use it much yet)
* Can schedule entire projects as something to do for the day - I can just work on what feels opportune and the tasks live in the context of the project even on the My Day list (this is an ""unexpectedly handy feature"" winner)
* Morning/Afternoon/Evening chunking just makes the day list feel more manageable (again, surprisingly much better than I would've thought)

Best thing is I basically didn't have to adjust. Marvin's naturally set up quite a lot like To Do and the same ways of working just feel natural. It just solves small pieces of friction I had with To Do completely unobtrusively. And this is subjective, but it looks better. I like To Do's colorfulness, but the intense fancy backgrounds just drown eg. importance stars and that's not nice. Marvin has color, but the bright stuff is limited to accents.

The app did need some set up to become a perfect To Do clone (there's a toggle for just about anything, though, which I love), and the way it handles recurring tasks is different from the way most of the usual suspects do it, so I'd definitely recommend reading the help article.

Overall, very pleased and definitely waiting to see what kinds of mobile fanciness they come up with (Put list on Droid home screen, pretty please? ;_;)"

This patch tries to fix that. Most of the heavy lifting needed to architect the game to work with rollback was already done properly.

Actually patching rollback into a game that's structured like delay games usually are is a large project which is why you see it primarily for things like emulators and older titles where you can just manipulate the entire memory space rather than people grafting rollback into a running delay-based engine per se.

But splitting it up a bit with 3-4f of stable delay and constant, but smaller rollbacks is much more playable. It won't be *good*, but it will be a lot less bad.)

StreetFighter,fdlzvtv,t3_em24ck,1578536479.0,"To explain at more length wtf this actually does (as far as I understand, I'm not a network engineer):

As always, watch [the Keits interview about netcode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RI5scXYhK0) if you don't have a good grasp on what FG netcode actually does and why/how rollback works.

The main theory on what's wrong with SFV netcode is that it doesn't keep the game simulations in sync, so if eg. data takes 3f to travel and players have 3f of input delay, they press a button on frame 20 and it gets scheduled for execution on f23. There's enough time for he data to travel so hiccups don't happen or are minor: Player B usually gets inputs A scheduled for f23 on f23 and can run them just fine, and if they're late, it's by a frame or two and the rollbacks are both rare and small as they should be.

But say Player A falls behind. His sim is on f20 while sim B is on f23. A presses a button to be executed on f23. B is already on frame 23, so A's input will always arrive to B late and force a rollback. If the difference is large, the rollbacks will be terrible. The solution is to keep the simulations in sync so that inputs will arrive roughly at the time they're supposed to be executed and rollbacks stay minimal or don't happen. SFV doesn't sync the simulations at least in all situations, so if this bug happens, B will suffer from A's inputs arriving to him late for the whole match, and the rollbacks can be disruptively big and stay that way, making the match feel like garbage for Player B. Basically, SFV doesn't recover from a desync, proper implementations will. This patch makes SFV behave more like a proper implementation.

All those horrid rollbacks, fixed by making your local client wait a little.

You have your whole schoolwork in one large notebook, and would prefer to not keep copies of all of the data locally (which OneNote by design has to do)?

In this case, your only real option is to make multiple smaller notebooks, copy the sections you want to them, and keep only the notebooks you want open on your device.

Or is it that you don't want to store the schoolwork in the cloud so as to not take up space there? To my knowledge, school accounts typically come with storage to the tune of 1TB, and that shouldn't be a concern.

If you're using a free personal account for school notes and don't want to pay, you're out of luck if you want convenience: OneNote can keep fully local notebooks with the OneNote 2016 app on Windows, but that specific function is a paid feature.

The second way to do it is very inconvenient, but it is to do the notebook splitting thing I said earlier, and export the newly made notebooks you want to have off OneDrive (onenote.com lets you export notebooks) and then delete them in the OneDrive web UI.

Pauper,fdbymo6,t3_ekhb5g,1578263935.0,"The more technical explanation is that the stack is a zone in Magic that cards try their damndest to not refer to. It's a pile of suggestions, and almost every ability that gets activated, triggered etc. and every spell that is cast puts a suggestion to the stack. Most suggestions cost something to make, and those costs have to be paid before you get to put the suggestion on the pile. 

Carrion Feeder basically reads: [Sacrifice a creature]: [Put a suggestion on the stack that says ""Put a +1/+1 counter on Carrion Feeder""].

Vicious Offering reads: [1B, you may also sacrifice a creature]: [Put a suggestion on the stack that says ""Target creature gets nerfed. If you sacrificed a creature as part of this spell's cost, it gets nerfed really bad""]

Basically, the process goes:

1. The game gives you priority to do stuff.
2. ""I'd like to announce that I'm activating Carrion Feeder's ability""
3. ""I choose to sac this poor sod to pay the costs""
4. ""I'll put Carrion Feeder's ability-suggestion to the top of the stack""

This is when players get to do stuff again - you get to add more stuff on top if you want to before letting others have their turn, or you can pass priority (=the right to act) to the next opponent. Once everyone's said ok, I have nothing to add, the topmost suggestion on the stack is implemented. If everyone says ok when the stack is empty, the game moves over to the next part of the turn.

These steps are usually really heavily abstracted away in tabletop play since players know how things should turn out, but understanding them well helps in reading cards and navigating really tricky situations.

In your case, whatever you were trying to sacrifice twice dies already in the process of playing the first spell or ability, and you only get the right to try the other play when it's already kicked the bucket.

Mortician Beetle, mentioned elsewhere in the thread, has a triggered ability. Those put a suggestion on top of the stack when the ability-haver notices something happening: There's no cost to be paid, just some condition that has to become true for the ability-having thing to do its job."
