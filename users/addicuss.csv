gadgets,fedhcef,t1_fedgsih,1579011537.0,"There's actually a term called the curb cut effect, basically when things designed for accessibility end up helping everyone. IE: CC was designed for the deaf, but as a result, people who aren't deaf can enjoy TV in situations where they couldn't before (bars, loud areas, areas where they  have to keep quiet).  It comes from the curb ramps that cities have for wheelchair access. They were designed for those in wheelchairs but have been a boon for people with luggage, or carts, or even people that have joint problems and can't step over curbs. I think some of this voice assistant stuff is an example of the curb cut effect. I'm sure most of this started its life as a way to help those with disabilities but soon became useful to the general populace."

gadgets,fecbjb8,t1_febyzt7,1578970180.0,"I'm really not naive. I know exactly how all this stuff works. I'm a developer and quality assurance manager for a company that uses data analytics extensively in their product.   Look there's some really bad players out there and because of that I think the law should be more clear about what data can be collected and how it can be used. And I definitely get that there are some blind spots, Cambridge analytica was definitely eye opening. But in the end I do think that there is a way to use this data to the benefit of the user in a safe way. Google in my opinion has done a fairly good job they haven't been perfect. They've had a couple of leaks here and there. But for the most part they've done a good job. 
 
It's interesting that I'm getting attacked by multiple people for being naive and for being the internet equivalent of some mope that walks down 1980s time square with gold jewelry and flashy clothes. I frankly find the people who attack me to be a bit naive.  They rail at me for bringing about some dystopian future by not using a smart speaker, but ignore the fact that without the mining of customer data there would be no Google search, there would be no Netflix, there would be no Google maps and navigation. We wouldn't have the glut of microtargeted content we have today, no YouTube streamers, no glut of niche products. I can go on, this stuff has been beneficial to consumers.
   
I hate the absolutes that people use it doesn't have to be either we all live off the grid or corporations get to Livestream us shitting with no in-between.  I think there's a place where we acknowledge that some of our information is anonymously used and we reap benefits. We'd all be better served pushing for more transparency and accountability from corporations and giving our business to the ones with the best track records."
gadgets,fec73sj,t1_feb575r,1578967781.0,"You're barely worth talking to but find me someone who's had their nest equipment actually hacked. Go on I'll wait. And no I don't mean someone who used the password drowssap and somehow had someone guess it, or someone who got socially engineered. There's so much FUD out there about this stuff. Use 2FA and you're pretty unlikely to be hacked. I mean maybe if I were using eufy smart speakers or some Chinese Amazon stuff you'd have a point, but I'm using mostly Google devices with my account secured by a titan key. I'm reaaaaally not that worried.    

But you know, keep counting on an abaccus and living on the Battlestar Galactica so you can protect your security or whatever floats your boat."
gadgets,fec66wd,t1_febu7vo,1578967299.0,"That's not how Google assistant devices work. It buffers your voice until you say ok Google, anything after that phrase is sent to their server.  I'm really ok if Google gets a copy of me saying turn on the lights. Really not going to compromise my privacy in any meaningful way.

Also not sure what you mean by Facebook. Every scrap of information you put on Facebook, whether it's pictures, location information from pictures and phone gps, posts, profile information, clicks, views, post interactions, contact information, device information that the app is installed on, third party sites your on, every single thing you do and don't do on Facebook is mined. Facebook is far far more privacy compromising than a smart speaker and people just don't care.  the whole ""they're recording you in your own home"" mentality is an emotional response and it's fueled by a lot of FUD on how these things work."
gadgets,featojn,t1_fear1xf,1578952134.0,"yeah I guess I just don't worry about it as much as everyone says I should and maybe that's a mistake, but I've been in the Google ecosphere for decades. I can tangibly list the benefits of trusting them with my data. Better search results, a better keyboard experience, traffic updates on my way to work, better navigation experience, smarter gmail. I really struggle to identify where it's had a negative impact but I don't judge anyone for their concern. It's definitely a valid concern to have, and pushing for more transparency in how our data is handled and defaulting to opting in rather than opting out is always a good thing.  I will say GDPR isn't great, only because on most websites you can either opt in, or not see the site, in which case most people opt in.  Instead of being a good way  to guard privacy it just becomes a usability issue."

I really hate the old ""I haven't found any reason for these things to exist"" conversations because the question always seems to be in bad faith. People don't really want to know what they're used for they just want to flaunt some weird superiority for not having a smart device and doing things manually, or valuing their privacy (not saying thats you just speaking generally). I try to detail how I use them rather than what they can do. 

* turn lights on and off when it's otherwise difficult or impossible to, including outside lights, driveway lights, and basement lights.  It's not  just a pure laziness thing either. I've walked into my kitchen with my hands full of shopping bags and turned the lights on.  Or have turned all my lights off on my way out the door when I was in a rush, or turned my driveway and outdoor lights on when I know someone has arrived so they don't walk in the dark. 
* in the kitchen:
   * managing multiple kitchen timers, displaying and reading aloud recipes, playing music and controlling it (asking to play specific music, changing volume, skipping tracks, selecting specific speakers to play it through.  All of this is incredibly useful while cooking when my hands might be dirty or otherwise occupied. 
* In the living room:
   *  Turning my TV on, playing a specific show, and setting my living room lights to dim in one quick action. 
* In bed:
   *  turning every light off in the house when I decide to go to sleep, turning on the bathroom light before I step out of bed, playing white noise when I have trouble sleeping, setting my lights to slowly turn on in the morning to help me ease out of sleep.
* In the Bathroom:
   *  playing music, changing music, raising the volume, especially when in the shower
   * playing podcasts while I get ready for work, listening to the weather and my agenda for the day while getting ready.

These things are pretty useful and add a lot of little conveniences. Do you absolutely need one? No, but they're super cheap these days (often free) and I think they're worth having a few around. The privacy concerns to me just seem a bit silly.  No one is that important. No one cares about your specific information in any meaningful way. the data is pretty much anonymized and aggregated and spoonfed back to you in generally helpful or at least ignorable ways.  It's not like Jeff Bezos or Sundar Pichai is personally going to watch you shower through your nest cam, or show up to your favorite lunch spot to stalk you.  As for security, if you use 2fa and a strong password you're pretty  much golden. Getting through that security requires a level of effort that no one is going to go through unless you're particularly important. 

&#x200B;

For those that think they're somehow living in an impenetrable security bubble by not owning a smart speaker...  look I have bad news for you. Everything from the credit cards you charge money on, to the sites you visit, to your own health insurance is using your data in exactly the same way.  There is an emotional element to the fact that we're transmitting the data in our voice rather than by other methods but it's no more or less invasive than any of the countless other ways your data gets used every day. I'm not saying that's a bad or good thing,or that it's not worth complaining or protesting. But it always makes me giggle a bit when someone on Facebook smugly posts how they would never use a smart speaker because they're afraid of privacy concerns."

todayilearned,fcpeikt,t1_fcpd7ku,1577860544.0,"Good job you took the joke in my post, missed the obvious hyperbole in it and successfully formed an argument against it! Kudos. My point is  he's insignificant compared to other military figures throughout American history. Even within the scope of the civil war his accomplishments were minor and have been largely exaggerated. There are hundreds of military figures far more deserving of commemoration.  And thousands of American heroes that are far more deserving when you expand the scope beyond military. My point is the main reason he's commemorated has nothing to do with his accomplishments or significance and everything to do with his status as a white supremacy hero. He's largely irrelevant in Virginia, and the people who do sing his praises couldn't name a single town he protected or battle he fought so give me a break. Also noteworthy that  no one gave a shit about his accomplishments until the 70s when suddenly Lee and the Confederates saw a spike in statues and commemorative events in their honor... Almost like it was an answer to something going on at the time...

I feel you knew that though"
todayilearned,fcoeh9q,t1_fco9jn9,1577830270.0,"Your litany is a common defense for why Lee wasn't as bad as he's made out to be. Fine. What I want to see is why Lee was particularly deserving of monuments and holidays. He wasnt a total piece of shit! fantastic. Me neither but I don't have any holidays or monuments celebrating me. Regardless of how bad or good Lee is, the main reason he's the focus of monuments and holidays is as a direct counterpoint and  backlash to the  civil rights movement. It's meant as a slap in the face to people of color.  If the real reason we celebrate him is because of his contribution to America he's deep deep deep in a line of people far more deserving than him."

harrisonburg,fcnq1bo,t3_ei4rao,1577816275.0,"Sentera is the Comcast of healthcare. They come in, establish a monopoly, then gut costs and raise prices. At this point if you're a nurse in this area and are looking for work, there are very few non Sentara options and private practice isn't going to match what you were making in a hospital setting. Your options are to move or eat the 25% paycut. Sentara has all the power here and they not only know it, it's their entire gameplan.

I don't have any inside knowledge but I doubt they are prepping for a buyout. This is their standard operating procedure.  


Other things in their gameplan: the insurance and medicare base what they'll reimburse heavily on the average cost of a service. So in california an allergy test could cost 10k, but cost 85$ in rural wisconsin. Since Sentara owns so much of the healthcare system now, you'll see reimbursement costs skyrocket, this will lead to a rise in denied claims as sentara will drive up the reimbursement average so they can profit more, and will eventually lead to insurance costs going up."
