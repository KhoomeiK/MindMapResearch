As soon as you say you are getting out (which you are required to do 6 months out), especially as an officer, you become a pariah.

army,feuttst,t1_fetbktp,1579389831.0,"I recommend when you get your duty station list, avoid all the big ones. Put Eustis #1, or any other non-division one. Logistics is all about avoiding divisions, because that (non-division) is when you will do real logistics with people that appreciate it. There are loggies literally everywhere, so work with your clerk to figure out your real list of places to be stationed. I've even heard real good reviews of the TSC in Korea. One of the biggest problems is that none of your instructors will even know what a sustainment brigade does, let alone a TSC/ESC. Those are what you should aim for. Except 3rd ESC. Fuck 3rd ESC."
