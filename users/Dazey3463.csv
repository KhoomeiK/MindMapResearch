mentalhealth,fdpjebe,t3_emhdk8,1578630235.0,"First and foremost. Thank you for your service. No one really understands what it takes to be a first responder. But I DO think things are getting better. As you say...we now know to use gloves...
My son was volunteer fire dept for several years as well as my youngest daughter volunteering EMS from when she was 16 until  about 20 years old.
I myself have recently been certified as mental health first aid....how to respond before the first responders get there.
Thankfully mental health issues are being addressed more and more from every angle."
