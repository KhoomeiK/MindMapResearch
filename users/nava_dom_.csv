Los Angeles as well. If you come down here, depending on what you type of fun you’re looking for is pretty easy to find. 

New York is just amazing as well. I’d recommend flying into New York and then to Miami, and maybe cross country driving from Miami to Los Angeles, you’ll pass through a lot of big cities down south"

I’d be there for her. Don’t force yourself into anything. Let her know you’re there if she needs anyone to talk to or even just to listen to her vent.
