I've always argued this: for hitters, your comparable is Delgado. by all accounts he was a 'clean' player, and was ridiculously good.

His record is very close to Chipper Jones career wise, but Delgado was never seriously considered for Cooperstown because he was hitting 40 HR a year when Sosa was hitting 50-60.

You should be able to get a 24"" 1080p monitor for $125. Just watch Bestbuy and CanadaComputers for a weekly deal. 

As stated you don't need a dedicated cooler.

The 2400g is your best bet if you need integrated video. You could get a much more capable 2600 ryzen chip for ~$160 but no onboard graphics."

When they poured across the border

I was cautioned to surrender
This I could not do

I took my gun and vanished.

I have changed my name so often

I've lost my wife and children

But I have many friends

And some of them are with me

An old woman gave us shelter
Kept us hidden in the garret

Then the soldiers came

She died without a whisper

There were three of us this morning

I'm the only one this evening

But I must go on

The frontiers are my prison

that first run, bloody sock and all, comeback kids, the whole deal was legendary. its the stuff operas are written about. one of the great all time sports championship and stories ever told. then a few years later, he proves it wasn't a one hit wonder and gets you another championship.

the way boston treated him and ran him out of town makes me hate your team. i know subsequent managers have won, but there's no honor in them, they're gravy train championships won on the culture of winning he put in place and throwing gobs on money at players. 

i truly hope this is a curse on your franchise for decades of torment. the yankees are easy to hate, but your management found a way to make me loathe them."
