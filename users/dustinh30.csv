And honestly what does putting the warning on their do to hurt you or hinder you in any way?"
technology,ff9ze65,t1_ff9v5ua,1579724761.0,"So I’ve been on political/economic/social research kick and I’m so glad you posted a thoughtful fleshed out answer. I also see some of the same problems with what you are saying as well I just don’t believe that this would work out in a good way for us. I just don’t see people giving their money for anything if they are given a opportunity not to without semi instant/instant repercussion. Also a big thing that happens with a small/weak central government are that monopolies are created. (undoubtedly we have multiple monopolies now already) With this, whoever has the money has the power and it’s not too far fetched to see these companies with major power over the country. Companies are for profit so they will cut spending as much as possible and with a monopoly there is no competition to create a natural quality control."

agedlikemilk,ff782f9,t1_ff77t5c,1579642956.0,"“If we get Biden this year, we get a much more dangerous and intelligent Republican president in 2024.” You mean this one that is talking about someone getting voted in in 2024. lol They weren’t calling Biden a republican even though he pretty much is but no one said he was worse than trump.

Let’s say that was opi, let’s see how many games this year the packers have won due to ref ball, week 6 against the lions, week 8 against the chiefs, week 10 against the panthers, and week 15 against the bears.. I’m not gonna count last weeks game because the Seahawks shouldn’t have put themselves in that situation to begin with and honestly the packers probably would have gotten the first down without ref ball anyways. Vikings count maybe 1 against the saints, and that wasn’t anywhere near as egregious as two phantom hands to the face calls against the lions"
