Gunners,feamscd,t1_fea4x9k,1578950383.0,"Kola is making more because he was a free transfer. We are basically still paying a ""ghost"" transfer fee for him. You can think of it as a mortgage down payment. 

If he was on £60,000 a week we would save £40,000 a week if we compare it to his current wage. That would save us £2,080,000 yearly which is equal to £10,400,000 over 5 years if he stays until 2022.

Paying £10,400,000 for him and giving him a wage of £60,000 can't be called a bad deal. It just depends on how you look at it. We probably payed him a couple of millions on a sign on fee aswell, but it still can't be called a bad deal.

TLDR: you have to look at a part of Kolas wages as a mortgage down payment since we didn't pay a transfer fee for him."

todayilearned,fcz7b6x,t1_fcz43ly,1578095125.0,"As I said Russian territories is considered parts of the Scandinavian peninsula in the broadest sense. But are usually left out for cultural reasons and because we are talking about a very small part of Russia. I refer again to the picture I linked in my previous post, please zoom in and study it again before you tell me I am completely wrong. 

According to the wiki article which I linked I have my previous post aswel you can read this quote under the section administration under the headline Russia ""Possibly a north western sliver of the Murmansk oblast"". 

The article doesn't mention any towns but if you study the map it can seem that the town of Nickel is on the Scandinavian peninsula geographically speaking. I am not an expert on North-Western Russian geography so the town might be just outside what is defined as the geographical Scandinavian Peninsula. If this is the case Russia still owns uninitiated land on the peninsula. 

To summarise my points once again so you don't have to misunderstand me. I was just trying to show you that in you can never say that Iceland is Scandinavia, but you can include small parts of Finland and Russia for geographical reasons even if its not common to do so, both countries still owns land on what is the geographical definition the peninsula which Iceland dosent. However due to historic and cultural reasons Scandinavia usually only means Sweeden, Denmark and Norway. This is the kingdoms that owned the big majority of the peninsula throughout a large part of history. This is the reason that the Scandinavia article on Wikipedia almost only mention of Norway, Sweeden and Denmark.

TLDR:
The geographical Scandinavian peninsula is one thing and we are talking about a geographical place where several countries owns land (Norway, Sweeden, Denmark, Finland and Russia) 

The cultural and historical meaning of the word Scandinavia usually only refers to the countries Norway, Sweeden and Denmark."
todayilearned,fcyyhtb,t1_fcywsdf,1578089887.0,"My point is that the people who sometimes use Scandinavia synonymous with nordic is always wrong even if it is more common lately.
