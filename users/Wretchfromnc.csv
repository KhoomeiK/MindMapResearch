M1Finance,ff0bl4c,t1_fev2tgp,1579467281.0,"This is a question of politics and strategy. I'm not a financial advisor or tax person, this is just the way I understand things and the way I approach them as well. Being self-employed you'd be better off asking a CPA. The true question is,  when it's time to pay taxes on the funds in a IRA, for simplicity let's say you're 40 years old. In 19.5 years when you are able to start taking money out without paying penalties  what do you think the payroll tax rate will be in the state you live in? Let's say right now the Fed income tax rate is 15% and a state income tax rate is 8% for a total of 23% payroll tax. So, in 19.5 years what do you think the combined state and fed income tax rate will be? In North Carolina it was 35% 5 to 6 years ago. On a Roth IRA the math is different, it depends on what the combined tax rate is for fed income tax and state income (if you live in a state with a income tax) tax. 

Income taxes are higher and lower depending on the political party running the country at the time. It's best to have both a Roth IRA and a IRA, it's best if you can take advantage of a employer sponsored 401K if company matching is included. There's a lot more involved, it gets rather cumbersome depending on income, family and all that stuff."
