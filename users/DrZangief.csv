AmIFreeToGo,ff8ecki,t1_ff8d368,1579674904.0,"They can lie about all sorts of stuff but not about why they're detaining you. It's explicitly written into our charter which is basically like your constitution.

...10. Everyone has the right on arrest or detention

(a) to be informed promptly of the reasons therefor;

(b) to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right; and

(c) to have the validity of the detention determined by way of habeas corpus and to be released if the detention is not lawful.

If you think about it you can't really make an informed decision about your rights if you don't know the real reason why police are detaining you."
funny,ff8d4g9,t3_es59tx,1579673554.0,I love possums and think they're perfect but really don't like the idea of people thinking they're domesticated. Please don't bring these rat angels into your home. American rules about exotic pets boggle the mind.
AmIFreeToGo,ff8cogn,t1_ff4e68a,1579673089.0,Absolutely not. It's the law so there's always theoretical limits and exceptions but the way you worded it no.

AmIFreeToGo,ff307kx,t3_er1weu,1579530140.0,I've enjoyed watching your vids (I'm Canadian and well-acquainted with our law). The biggest difference most Americans might notice is our charter right to be notified of why we're being detained immediately.

Again... show me a single case of someone getting attacked randomly in the street where they defended themselves proportionately and got convicted of anything. You can't. Because you live in a fantasy land."

toronto,fdgpjow,t1_fdff5vi,1578404905.0,Pressing charges isn't a thing in Canada. You don't have a choice in that. The cops told you that without your cooperation and SERVING AS A WITNESS they couldn't really do anything.

toronto,fdgp99a,t1_fdg1cu8,1578404670.0,\^ Complete bullshit. Very few ppl get NCR'd. The vast majority of minor criminal allegations are dismissed because of busy courts and the uselessness of short term incarceration for recidivism.
toronto,fdgp4qp,t1_fdfctn2,1578404567.0,Bail is for people awaiting trial. If you're a homeless person randomly punching ppl in the arm on the street you're never going to trial.
AmIFreeToGo,fdgos3u,t1_fdewqu3,1578404274.0,"All of the procedure stuff you mentioned was entirely pulled out of your ass, much like the guy in the video. You don't know the procedure for a citizens arrest. There are no mandatory steps like detaining the accused in a specific way or the timing of the paperwork.

AmIFreeToGo,fdcqzmh,t3_ekn28u,1578281874.0,This guy is a moron. His videos are embarrassingly stupid and he comes across like a paparazzi doing this on the weekend. The fact he has as many subscribers as he does is evidence that most ppl just want to watch antagonistic vids rather than smart ones.

You'll soon realize that when the steroid injections do nothing but your body still suffers all of the negative side effects from them. I'm not saying chiro does anything (it doesn't) but its popularity is specifically as a result of the lack of any meaningful treatments for conditions like bulging discs.
