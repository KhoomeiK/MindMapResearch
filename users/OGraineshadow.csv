This will be my first time driving in the UK. Are all of the parking primarily parallel parking spots? I’m petty bad at parallel parking when driving on the side of the car I’m used to, so just wondering what parking situations I’ll be needing to deal with.
Thanks in advance, sorry if this is a dumb tourist question..."

fatlogic,feyv2ob,t3_eqob2b,1579450890.0,"So, in a way I understand this. I was a fat kid, and my parents force-exercised me . It was very abusive and a really awful time in my life. I can’t stand gyms or exercise machines or classes with a forced pace...so I don’t go.
I’ve managed after decades to turn activity into self-care, instead of feeling it is a punishment. I walk my dogs miles daily and just make sure I don’t use it as a personal punishment.  Like when I hit my limits I slow down and/or go home.
So sure, I can see exercise being a trauma trigger. If a person was punished or made to feel less-than because of it. That being said, it’s been my personal job to manage my exercise in a way that honors my traumatic past.
It’s not other people’s job, it’s mine to set and maintain boundaries.
So this person saying others “don’t care”...well no shit Sherlock. The world doesn’t care about anyone’s mental health and it’s not the world’s job to do so. This shift of personal responsibility onto the world is disturbing and seems indicative of denial, delaying healing from trauma."

lupus,feh387p,t1_fegr1wq,1579108220.0,"The long termness of lupus has definitely harmed my marriage. I know it’s a lot for a spouse to bear, having to pick up the slack on so many things. 
I’m on disability after years of hearings, but the financial strain has really damaged my marriage and my sense of self worth. My monthly benefit is really small so I still catch a lot of flack for not contributing financially enough, plus I’m not a stellar housewife due to the pain and mobility issues.

Sometimes I wonder if I should just be alone, because I feel like my spouse tried to live like they’re sick with me, and it causes a bunch of resentment. I’m sorry you’re going through this too."

The thing is, a lot of anti-diet movements unfortunately equate liberation with eating terrible foods. While I enjoy junk food and sweets, realizing the environmental impact these processed foods have is something that should be carefully considered. 
Also, vegetables and fruits should be something everyone enjoys to eat. If you’re fat and eat a lot, why can’t delicious vegetables be a large part of your wheelhouse too?
Idk, it’s pretty lame how delicious, fresh foods are shamed in the bopo community. People are missing a lot of good food that is inherently healthy and enjoyable."
