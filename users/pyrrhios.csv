politics,ff1mpz2,t1_ff0bq0r,1579481734.0,"Eh, they pretty much all come to about 10% of GDP total, though.  Not all countries measure GDP the same as the US, so it's hard to get good comparisons sometimes, but 10% is a good ""rule of thumb"" number.  The US spends about 17% of GDP total, and has remarkably inferior health outcomes, so it's frankly truly shameful.  Bang for buck, we truly do pay twice as much for healthcare in the US as basically anywhere else, not because we literally put twice as much money in, but because the quality of our system is so inferior that the actual value of the US ""healthcare system"" is more in the range of 8% of GDP."

politics,fei4gb4,t3_ep71p4,1579130066.0,"I really wish someone would put up the current numbers about the US healthcare system vs. a universal healthcare system.  I did do that homework back in 2007 and what I found was: a universal healthcare system requires approximately 10% of GDP.  This means the value of the US healthcare ""system"" is less than 10% of GDP. 
 The combined budgets of Medicare, Medicaid, VA and other miscellaneous tax-funded health programs was already nearly 8% of GDP.  This means we nearly had enough tax money for healthcare for a universal healthcare system already.  Today we spend 17% of GDP on healthcare, so if my 2007 findings are still close to the mark, the hypothetical average person could hypothetically ask for a $4k/year wage increase if we went to a universal healthcare system.  Those are ballpark numbers, but for me it really helped me get a better sense of what was going on."

PoliticalHumor,fd6lws8,t1_fd67jyt,1578192906.0,">  quote from the Nuremberg Trials from Herman Goering

Probably this one: 
Göring: Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.

Gilbert: There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.

Göring: Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country."
