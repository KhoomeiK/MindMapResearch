depression,fffm1pz,t3_etdfpo,1579886875.0,"Okay well here’s what I would do. I would use this as an opportunity to practice perspective. While your crush may not be into you, remember that you still gained new friends, and that’s a major win! You’re still allowed to be sad over this thing that happened, but try not to surrender all your joy to it. You deserve to be happy! Maybe go out with your new friends as a distraction?"

I’m only taking a week because I don’t smoke very large amounts but I smoke consistently because I use medical. Since you use a higher amount, maybe try two or three weeks? My survival tips are- don’t have any in the house. Have yummy snacks to have when you’re craving. Make plans with your friends who can help hold you accountable. After the break, it’ll take less to feel the same effects. So naturally, you should be using less."

AmItheAsshole,ff9eajq,t3_esdjgy,1579711147.0,"YTA. I used to work at Starbucks. I guess it’s not that big of a deal if you order water but if you’re gonna do it,  recognize you’re doing something obnoxious. Working in a drive through is a pain already- if you’re going thru and just getting something for free that you could just drink out of a water fountain, at least go inside so you’re not clogging up the line. Also- the man works a minimum wage job at Starbucks for God’s sake. Don’t say anything to him. Take your water and go."
Anxiety,ff9dy1v,t3_esdjpo,1579710924.0,"Yeah I actually have before. It wasn’t really an issue, I stopped the sleep aid after a while. I shortly after discontinued Cymbalta. I was having very bad side effects once I upped the dose and If I missed a dose or was at all late, I got horrible withdrawals. Getting off of Cymbalta was a nightmare!! I don’t recommend it for that reason, but I also know everyone’s different, maybe you could ask your doctor about that? Best of luck to you! ❤️"
