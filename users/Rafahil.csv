As for supers middle tree roaming is clearly the best. top tree Shadowshot is near useless in my opinion because it still activates too late even if you get a direct hit with it. Using it as a trap also doesn't work because it's so obvious to spot and it pings on the radar as well. Bottom tree super at least has some use as it can get multiple kills but sadly it has no tracking at all so I just use it when I'm really close."

CruciblePlaybook,feiwexk,t1_feivqjb,1579149054.0,Decent internet definitely plays a role but on consoles there are hardware limitations even if you have a fiber optic connection so it's the same for most people with decent connections.
CruciblePlaybook,feio2ho,t3_epbjve,1579143040.0,"Yeah I was the one who made the video with the throwing knife getting long range crits while aiming at the feet. From my understanding the main problem is the way aim assist works in general. It's based on connection. The more people there are in a match the worse aim assist gets, you playing in a low ping environment? Everyone gets more aim assist. 

This is why private matches are unreliable for aim assist testings imo. I do think that both weighted knife and definitely HHSN are busted as hell but throwing knife at least is basically rng depending on connection whether it will give you a miracle kill or not which is a problem in its own right imo and no game should have such a system in place at all.

I mean I had a ricochet kill once that was as if that player had killed my knife's family and the knife trained his whole life for revenge lol. Hate myself for forgetting to record that."

It's the one aspect of looter based games that I despise and it's the nr1 reason a game like Ghost recon breakpoint was a huge flop.

I think this game will be the most enjoyable to start if you buy it a year later when all the dlc and patches are released but who the hell's gonna wait that long lol.

It's gonna happen again in Nioh 2 but at least I'll have Cyberpunk 2077 just around the corner to look forward to."
