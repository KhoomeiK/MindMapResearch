Hang tough with your children because they need you, and when they go out into the world as young adults as you did, they’ll have sweet memories of your trips together.

FreeCompliments,fekbejv,t1_fek79rr,1579196524.0,"Misogynistic meaning “Hatred of women”? Or against women? I’m a woman who on the job was sexually harassed by a woman, I threatened legal action to the Supervisor, a camera was installed in employee lounge. She then started on me outside and I whispered to her a few words of wisdom, and she backed off. I hate people being pushy and touching me, and I tell them straight up “Don’t touch me” with an evil eye."
