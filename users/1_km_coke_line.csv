Not trying to argue whether the extra skin layer thing is relevant or not (i dont know) but you gotta admit that feet can comfortably be at temperatures way below core temp. 

Heck, alot of the time I dont even register or realize how freezing cold my feet are until they touch something warm"

tech,feipveo,t1_fei8hk7,1579144250.0,"in computer programming, there is an extremely common concept of “key: value” pairs. A collection of these pairs forms a “dictionary” or a “hash” or “tuple” which are all basically synonyms.

keys within a single dictionary must be unique, but the values can be anything.

example below is “dictionary1” that contains 2 arbitrary key/value pairs

dictionary1:
 
  key1: “value1”
 
  abcdefg: 123456

you could retrieve the value “123456” by referencing its key:

dictionary1[‘abcdefg’]"

gadgets,fcvch7w,t1_fcvaslu,1577999206.0,"I am a linux sysadmin, and my work laptop is on macOS (for various reasons beyond my control). I would definitely never ever try to put games on my work laptop, but if I had hypothetically tried a few well known titles I would report that they all ran easily and basically out of the box

Linux is a different story.. I mean, it can be done if you follow carious internet guides for whichever game you want.. But coming from a linux professional, there is alot of extra work involved and hidden incompatibilities.

Does this stop me from playing world of warcraft on fedora 29? No it does not. But it is a pain in my ass to set up GPU passthrough and make changes following every patch"

Its not great, but easily better than trying to game on linux haha"
