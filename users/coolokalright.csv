HawaiiVisitors,ffanohu,t3_esila8,1579740220.0,"If you're up for waking up early and standing in line, there's Asato Family Shop sherbert. Guri guri styled ice cream with unique flavors you probably won't get anywhere else (different flavors every month). Check them out on instagram!

Also Ted's Bakery is pretty good. They have great pies. 

Matsumoto shaved ice is also a famous place besides Waiolas. Both are great, but Waiolas is more convenient. It's also close to a Leonord's bakery shop."
JusticeServed,fejh9ab,t1_fehvpx0,1579174164.0,Lmao this last comment got me.... it’s like you were speaking to a wall. A common house fly compared to a dog as a pet? Gtfo lol
PublicFreakout,fdnyli6,t1_fdnvwr5,1578595484.0,"Don't you think you're over reacting a bit? It helps people paint a better picture in their heads while reading a story. Could be black, white, asian, mexican, w/e. Not everything has to be some seen as some negative racial thing..."
SuicideWatch,fctxs44,t3_eitwlz,1577964891.0,Threatening to leave someone or turn your back on then when they’re suicidal is a bad choice imo. Could end up bad. I see where you’re coming from though. It’s a tough one
SuicideWatch,fctkwcw,t3_eitwlz,1577947014.0,Don’t do it. Not sure what you need to do but please don’t do this...
SuicideWatch,fctaxvz,t3_eisui9,1577937659.0,Exactly how I feel right now at 24. Not sure I’ll make it to 30 tbh so congrats on that! Hope you find some peace / happiness.
SuicideWatch,fct10f6,t1_fcsvb5z,1577930084.0,I’ve known people that survived and took over 40. I think you can get permanent dmg but it’s more of a long term thing than a fast way out. 100% will not recommend
SuicideWatch,fcsv38u,t1_fcsu0e4,1577925860.0,Tylenol isn’t any better. Please don’t go around recommending this bs. Probably some of the worse things to use in an attempt
SuicideWatch,fcpby8u,t3_eieayu,1577857658.0,The usual.
SuicideWatch,fcoud8o,t1_fcn3f8m,1577841802.0,Wtf is wrong with you
SuicideWatch,fcou879,t1_fcos825,1577841696.0,Ever thought of adopting a dog?
SuicideWatch,fcou3r5,t3_ei4k2u,1577841599.0,"Parents, sibling, dogs. Not much else. I don’t get joy or excitement from anything anymore. Sometimes I wish I did it a long time ago. At least they would’ve been able to hopefully come to terms with it by now. Now idk anymore."
news,fconti9,t1_fcny04p,1577836896.0,I wouldn’t say all regulated weed pens are safe. I think Michigan found a bunch of contaminated ones. Be safe out there people.
SuicideWatch,fco8n33,t3_ei2zsn,1577826223.0,"These next few HS years will be hard but just know it'll get better. Being that exact kid when I was younger, I can say it's usually just a stage. Keep that head up. You made it the past 14+ years. You can do it."
aww,fcaz0b9,t1_fcaxcf5,1577579414.0,"Now imagine having 2 of them on your bed when it’s cold af at night. I sometimes have to think about sleeping on the couch, or waking one of them up to gtfo my bed lol"
hempflowers,fbhlwnz,t1_fbhdn8v,1576876792.0,I'm glad I didn't pull the trigger on that. Almost got 2 oz of boof... At least compared to what I was expecting lol
