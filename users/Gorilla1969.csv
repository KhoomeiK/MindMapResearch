The craziest thing about him? He drives a Mini Cooper. I was absolutely thunderstruck when I learned that, until I got a close-up look at it and saw the interior was ripped out. Now it's just one *very large* seat pushed back as far as it can go. It looked like the remains of an old, extra-large, padded ergonomic office chair. The dashboard is a mess too. I don't know what it originally looked like, but it's a mess of hanging wires and broken plastic now. I guess it helps that he's short? I don't know how the suspension manages to survive though."
fatpeoplestories,ffdiwma,t3_et0ns8,1579821825.0,"A man works at my site that is so enormous, he is almost completely spherical. He has a special heavy-duty desk chair, a handicap parking space right next to the front door, and the doorway to his office had to be widened to accommodate him. Basically, he now has double doors to his office because that was the easiest solution. He is definitely well over 600 pounds.

He does his job, is perfectly nice, doesn't stink, and doesn't complain. The only problem I (security/HSE) ever had with him was when he got super-mad at me for not letting him have a larger office that had become available, because it was on the second floor. You see, he can barely walk and is completely unable to climb stairs. He has been given a special elevator pass key in the past to go to the odd meeting here and there (which we put an end to), but he can not have a permanent 2nd floor office. If there's a fire or other disaster, employees will have to exit using the stairwells and he would become a major problem in that case. I told him the same thing I would have told an employee that was in a wheelchair.

He did not want to hear that noise, until I finally lost my patience and told him that if he fell and blocked the stairs in an emergency, he would be responsible for the injuries and deaths of everyone trapped behind him, as well as any people that stopped to assist him. Not to mention, it would be impossible to move him and he himself would probably not survive. He dropped it, but hasn't chatted with me much since. Sorry bud, just doing my job. :("

Something else I've come to realize: Women that grew up in a culture of being expected to be a good housewife and mother... they have *nothing else*. No marketable skills, no career to fall back on once their kids are grown, no self-sufficiency at all. Because that's all they were expected to do. Once their kids are grown adults and on their own, they latch on to the prospect of grandkids because they need that to feel useful again.

facepalm,fdsg53g,t1_fdry4uu,1578702034.0,"I inadvertently did this to my father. When I was a teen, I had severely dry skin. So just before stepping out of the shower every morning, I would douse myself in baby oil. I mean, I would really slather it on. Then I would lightly rinse to get the excess off and step out.

My father liked a relaxing bath once in a while. I didn't sufficiently rinse out the bottom of the tub that day. I never thought to, since he had a shower stall in the master bathroom and he rarely used the tub in the shared bathroom. This fateful day however, he filled the tub with hot water, had a nice soak, then suddenly discovered that he couldn't gain traction to stand up.

He drained the water thinking it would help. It was worse. All the oil that was previously floating on his bath water was now back on the surface of the metal tub. 

After panicking for five minutes or so, he soaped up his wash cloth and used it to clean the tub. While he was sitting in it, completely naked, wet, and freezing.

He was raging mad. I burst out laughing while he shouted the details of his ordeal at me. I couldn't help it. I got grounded and baby oil was banned from the bathroom."

If you're noticing slight hair loss in addition to your rash, it's likely a Biotin deficiency - this can be remedied by taking in more salmon, avocados, mushrooms, cauliflower, or cooked eggs.

Once you adopt an animal, you **own** it outright. If you're fostering it's another story, but they have no claim on an animal that has been adopted. If they took you to court for any of that, a judge would be very unamused and tell them to kick rocks.

The place I volunteer at is very stringent. We make sure adopters are going to take care of the animals *before* we let them adopt, so they don't end up back in a shelter. We thoroughly vet these people beforehand because of everything I mentioned above. We can't police something we no longer own. The strictest thing we have in our paperwork is a very strongly worded *request* that they return the animal to us if they can no longer care for it for any reason, with no questions and no judgement.
