misanthropy,fed7bci,t3_en8srx,1579002255.0,"I hate the concept of human being as a whole and hence I hate every stranger by default, that doesn’t mean I can’t like anybody. If I feel appreciation to somebody that is enough to “cancel out” my feeling of hate I will like them. So if one of misanthropes gives really good point or practiced some decent actions I’ll appreciate them. Also we do not hate humanity for the same reason. For example, a lot of people hate humanity because humans destroy the environment, but I don’t really care about the environment.

Here’s the reason that I don’t really care about the environment: the “good” and “bad” environment is defined by humans for human’s survival, for example, rainforest is good, higher CO2 level is bad. But to Earth herself, how do those make a difference? You’ll argue that certain animals have feelings but to me even human’s feelings are just a result of evolution, they’re not there because they should be there, they’re there because only they can be there. And therefore, they have no meanings."

I know there would be exceptions but it rarely happens if you find the right set of rules. Though this can barely be counted as morals, but that’s the “morals” I mainly follow. Other than that, it’s just that sometimes I can’t rule over my emotions."

And narcissists, I’ll say they’re worse at manipulating people because they’re too self-centered. To manipulate someone at least you have to know that person, but narcissists don’t even bother to know. This is based on what I know about psychopaths and narcissists."
misanthropy,fdj6jq2,t3_elbkn5,1578459853.0,"Hey it’s not abnormal at all. If I know that someone I think they’re smart is an anti-vaxxer I’ll be pretty disappointed. And for me especially, I holds a lot of unpopular opinions (mostly about people and society) so I learned not to show people when I talk with them. I adapted a “normal” set of world view and I pretend to agree with it when talking to people I don’t know that much, and for most people I know, I’ll just guess how they look at the world and say their opinions before they do. I’m pretty comfortable with lying around and pretend to be another person because I do this since I was really young. Rarely I tell people about my true opinions on something instead of just simply agreeing with them. And they always give me some negative feedback due to how bizarre my opinions seem (but I don’t regret it cuz when I say my true opinions I’m pretty sure about what the outcome would be). Honestly, if you hear my true opinions(especially not about misanthropy because we’re in the same sub for a reason), you’ll probably list me right next to the anti-vaxxer you met, and I fully accept it. That just mean our opinions on the same topic is so distinct so you find me crazy. But in return, I’m probably not gonna find you crazy if your opinions are closer to what is considered “normal”."
