Although the host nation is obligated to protect foreign embassies, the US absolutely steamrolls.  We treat the local law enforcement as if they worked for us, and the host nation lets us.  This is typical in developing nations and EXTREME in the Middle East.

You can even get on Google maps to just look at the footprint of infrastructure  of US Embassies compared to others.  In Kabul, it's like a fortress.  We straight up commandeered the main thoroughfare from the airport to their government centers, while other embassies are just a tiny house on a minimally protected street.

Not to mention the larger polical shuffle at play (that is asinine to claim understanding of), placing blame on the country of Iraq for a small mob is unfair."
