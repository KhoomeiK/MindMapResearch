AskReddit,fex4qbd,t1_fex0itj,1579424318.0,"Okay, yeah I see what you mean. But (and I may be wrong), when it comes to time dilation, isn't it mathematically valid to use ""normal"" time as the frame of reference when explaining this phenomenon, as well as to use the skewed model of time? 

If a system is experiencing 2 seconds per second, is that any different than saying that everything in that system is progressing at twice the speed as usual, and that time hasn't been affected? So if there's a system where a ball is rolling 1 m/s, and that system is moving -1 s/s, is that physically any different than just having a ball roll -1 m/s? 

Expanding - if a human being is travelling back in time at -1 s/s right in front of me, isn't he also moving forward in my time? The only difference is that for each one of my seconds, my brain is operating normally, but his brain (and body) is operating backwards."
AskReddit,fewzt8m,t1_fewy4lr,1579422023.0,"Yeah, I'm not arguing against that. We agree, when you're calculating these things it's just a matter of a signing convention. But what I got from your initial comment was that you were exploring the idea of time really, physically flowing backwards. Which I don't think means anything. If I move forward 1 m/s, that is the same as me moving -1m/-1s. Flowing backwards in time that way isn't only possible - I'm actually doing it. It's just that our perception of time is dependent on our experience, and my experience is dependent on my memory, and my memory can only store information from one direction. So while I perceive myself moving forward in time, there is literally no physical difference from me moving backward in time. I don't think the idea of moving through time has any physical bearing. It's just a convention."

AskReddit,fewxcv1,t1_fewpuzt,1579420935.0,"No, it's just moving ""backward"" in space. Or moving forward in space while going backward in time, but that's exactly the same as just moving backward in space. 

As far as I can understand, time ""flowing backward"" doesn't mean anything. For all we care, time could be flowing backward right now, but that doesn't change the state of the universe at the time I started writing this comment and the time I finished writing it."

lonely,few6anx,t3_eqr747,1579405889.0,"Wouldn't being emotionally intelligent and, by proxy, mature, typically mean not investing your emotional state in others? Smart people can hang around with below average people and have a good time. And mature people should be able to hang around with immature people and still have a good time. In fact, I would think the more someone understands peoples' emotional states and behaviors, the easier it would be for them to deal with immature people."

unpopularopinion,fe63p7b,t1_fe4577k,1578881087.0,"Yeah, when it comes down to it suicide only harms society, not the subject. It's not like someone who kills himself can regret it. And honestly I think it would be healthier for society if people were given the opportunity to tie up their loose ends and see themselves out. In the long run, someone who is really irreversibly suicidal but never does it is probably more of a debt to society than a benefit. Instead of slowly releasing their self-destructive tendencies on their environment, just let them destroy themselves and be done with it."
unpopularopinion,fe631i1,t1_fe471ai,1578880658.0,"It might come off as insensitive, but I agree that the attempts that leave the person ultimately unscathed are people who are just crying for help. And they can eventually shake it off. But if you've ever sincerely contemplated suicide, I'm sure you've faced the absolutely terrifying fear of trapping yourself through a botched attempt. Seriously injuring yourself and then living the rest of your life craving death even more than before, no longer with the agency to even take your life. So even if it was a cry for help and you pushed it a bit too far, you're fucked now. I think it would be better for both demographics if it was an option to go through a process that offers guaranteed death. Those who aren't fully committed would probably find a safer way to cry for help, and those who are committed wouldn't have to roll the dice."

It's way easier to avoid the avocado pit than the other types of seeds, which are spread throughout the fruit. The skin is more of an inconvenience than the pit, I think.

And I feel like it wouldn't be cost-effective. I don't have any clue how it's done, but I assume it uses more resources to develop and cultivate pitless avocados than it does to grow enough extra normal avocados to achieve the same yield of edible fruit. 

Also, a pitless avocado would feel weird and unnatural unless it's already mashed up and indistinguishable from a regular avocado."

I also really like having vivid dreams, including nightmares. My life is so dull and empty that often the best part of my day is either the experience of the dream or the relief when I wake up from a dream where I feel super trapped or stressed. Last night I dreamt I killed someone and I was always checking over my shoulder for the law or his revenge-seeking friends. Several times throughout the dream I was so desperate that I checked whether I was awake or dreaming, and I kept concluding I was awake and it was real. Usually I realize it's a dream. Woke up and felt thankful for my boring life."
depression,fdxvm1i,t3_en8sz2,1578773398.0,"I'm sorry about your cat. I just got one myself, and I've bonded with him far more than I have with any living thing in the past few years. At first I was nervous about my ability to take care of him and figured I could be indifferent if I accidentally let him die, but only a few weeks later I know I would be devastated if something happened to him.

I take it you're probably super lonely and devoid of human contact too? Navigating human relationships can be really tough, you can easily send the wrong signals (like innocent mistakes) and get shunned for it. And you can't really blame them for it either, because that's just how we're wired socially. Pets are really nice because all you have to do is take care of them and they'll love you to some capacity. A lot harder to screw up.
I hope you can get a new pet sometime in the near future, once you feel a little better.

And if you want to talk about your cat I'm here - I know what it's like for people to not care about something that means a lot to you. It's kind of difficult knowing the things that mean the most to you don't mean anything to anyone else. Getting my cat is a big deal to me (especially because I don't really have anything else going on) but I haven't really brought him up to anyone because I know no one would care."

But now I see it as just a state change, or rather the termination of the state machine that is life.

But I legitimately can't do anything about it. The only way to not come off the way I do is to just stop talking, which is what I do. A thing that kind of bothers me is that people assume that people like me don't realize how others see me, perhaps assuming that if I did I'd work to change it. I have worked to change it and even at my peaks I always come off as the dunce in all social interactions - I'm just a more active dunce because I'm trying to be confident about it.

depression,fbnpnve,t1_fbme5se,1577001380.0,"I think you and I are on the same page. I've very rarely ever actually been told I'm retarded, but that's because I always try to keep my mouth shut enough to make people think I'm either actually smart or aware of how witless I truly am. Though every now and again I've gotten those ""you have got to be kidding me"" looks which didn't register with me until later.

But I'm with you on being ""school smart"" and not ""street smart."" I've always gotten good grades but I know that doesn't count for anything. I can only hit things within a reasonable margin when I have oceans of time to sit and essentially retrace other people's steps. I can rarely come up with things by myself and I certainly can't think on my feet, which is what it's all about. Stupid reddit posts and comments like these take me 15 minutes to an hour to compose. 

And as to managing to ""fuck up at mopping a floor"" - as a kid I literally felt too incompetent to do simple cleaning tasks. They felt too overwhelming. I distinctly remember once my dad paid me to sweep up his shop and when I was done, he was visibly embarrassed by how poorly of a job I was able to do, when I tried my best. He rationalized it by saying ""when I was young, I thought sweeping and cleaning was beneath me too,"" but I legitimately just wasn't good at such a simple task as sweeping a floor."
