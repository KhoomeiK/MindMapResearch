JamesBond,ff922it,t3_es7szs,1579702920.0,Connery had genuine class that was impossible to fake. They also focused a lot on campy spy tropes which are always fun and unique.
JamesBond,ff2oz63,t3_eqrj3c,1579517150.0,There are some truly unbelievable plot points and Bond treats the world like the Nakatomi building.
JamesBond,ff2owk7,t3_eqx3jk,1579517039.0,GoldenEye.    So simple. So perfect.

JamesBond,ff2olve,t3_er8ycu,1579516576.0,"Dalton would make a good henchmen. Women don't find him attractive enough, the wife's reaction said it all."
NetflixBestOf,feizn7u,t1_feibada,1579151784.0,This is key: someone can be a victim and a perpetrator at the same time.
worksucks,fefnvg2,t3_eou8t3,1579060447.0,"Let nature run its course. Float idly over to the side, just close enough to benefit and far enough to avoid contact when shit hits the fan.

There may be more info with the guy then what you know. We seldom have the entire story and people aren't usually alcoholics without a reason."
AskReddit,fdlgbxy,t1_fdbxj9v,1578523416.0,"Right??? She doesn't go into graphic detail of the gross grave robbing and corpse arrangements. I was surprised and also happy to see her focus on deeper themes,. I was also suprised that he was alive so early in the book, never knew the true tale."
OldSchoolCool,fdlf24l,t3_eltj5q,1578522635.0,What an awesome picture thanks for sharing
pokemon,fddofs0,t3_eks49g,1578319530.0,Really love this. Such a relaxing image

CozyPlaces,fcwg1mg,t3_ej6txz,1578024685.0,"What a guy. A picture speaks a thousand words. The comfy spot next to the fire, the epic this-is-my-happy-place arm chair, the sweats and socks, the Barqs and books. A man of an era, old school cool. Thanks for sharing ðŸ™‚ hope he's in a good place right now."
worldnews,fcwft4a,t1_fcw4l1j,1578024515.0,"Wait, but I got accepted to college. Good to go right?"
ForeverAlone,fcuw0ed,t1_fcu8n58,1577989674.0,"That's what I thought too. Seems to be more about identifying and venting, less about advice or support."
ForeverAlone,fcu7m4y,t3_eiybud,1577974464.0,"Don't take it personally, it's a fairly negative community. I get backlash for every comment, not sure why I'm still here."

offmychest,fcth2e7,t3_eitp1l,1577943043.0,Music is the answer
offmychest,fcth0kt,t3_eitr0z,1577942996.0,They didn't know shit. Always wanting to feel important or say told ya so. Self righteous.
ForeverAlone,fcrbay5,t1_fcqkp1o,1577899473.0,I'm sorry. In your situation I'd say yes it's not ok to spend with your parents. OP didn't seem to have the same predicament.
ForeverAlone,fcow2b7,t3_ei85pl,1577843147.0,"As a somewhat normie who used to give legit advice, I can confirm that it never goes over well. Took me a while to realize this community is about accepting the FA fate and bonding over it, not asking for advice. Somewhat normies like us just feel bad to see others suffer, especially if we have escaped the FA ourselves, all we want to do is help. If there are trolls just posting BS stories that's another problem all together. Still legit advice or not, def the wrong subreddit."
ForeverAlone,fcouzjk,t1_fco23uz,1577842296.0,"It's not pathetic. They are your parents, they are two of the most meaningful people in your life."
ForeverAlone,fcoum58,t3_ei40hs,1577842001.0,I'm doing this too so you're not alone out there. Cheers!
offmychest,fcm49wp,t1_fclaiq3,1577763856.0,I like this. I think we need a refresher for the whole country on civic duties.
offmychest,fcm3z32,t3_ehobx5,1577763633.0,"There's an odd phenomenon where one can do the right thing but you can still feel kinda bad or guilty about it. When we make a tough decision that affects others significantly, it's hard to just be totally comfortable with that. However, at the end of the day it's all about the big picture not how we feel individually. This particular situation affects multiple people and children, each who can affect multiple others and the cycle continues. Who knows, you may have just saved a life today, maybe several. I think you did a good thing here. We need people like you with the courage to step up when times demand it, especially to help the kids who can't help themselves. These are formidable years for the kids, who knows what will happen growing up in an abusive household. Who knows where this would go if someone didn't intervene."
offmychest,fc1z8oj,t3_efqnhd,1577334424.0,It's different for everyone and it's not your fault. Most of us didn't have proper fatherly guidance about women. There's more to it then just being nice and hopeful. Start with Double Your Dating by David DaAngelo. Ignore the name and explore it. Shift your perspective and you won't need to be jealous anymore.
AskReddit,fc04w39,t3_efaulu,1577278693.0,Grab the star off the tree and chase him down. Finish him off with the tinsel. If anybody gonna be fucking my mom it's gonna be me!
