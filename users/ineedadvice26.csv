Advice,ff83t0q,t1_ff7pzii,1579665238.0,I feel like it impacts my life in both a negative and positive way. I find myself having more confidence when I’m her and I get more things done because i’m imagining i’m in another situation( idk how to explain it). But at the same time I don’t push my real self to do things like extra curricular activities and the like because i’d rather be home daydreaming. So in a way I mistreat my real self and treat the made up version in my head better.
introvert,fdglb2y,t1_fdgip0z,1578401158.0,For real. They really get too much recognition. Smh
introvert,fdfxt0u,t1_fdfr2rw,1578373193.0,dang. school sucks. The idea of it is nice. But they have things they need to fix. And i’m not a sporty a girl. I mean it sounds fun and all but i never really cared for it. I feel like they treat the athletes better sometimes. Especially the football players. I knew guys Freshmen year who changed completely just because their on the team now ...
introvert,fdfqfpm,t1_fdfp6kl,1578367724.0,"honestly. They just need to revamp the whole school system. Why is it that I learn and retain more from a youtube video about the subject, but not the actually lesson in class? I feel like in the future, school won’t be a thing anymore. We’re literally wasting 7 hours of our day Five days a week!"
introvert,fdfg104,t1_fde0zfq,1578360837.0,this made me feel better. I hate high school. The environment is so toxic ! And the system is just so messed up. They need to understand that not everybody learns the same.

socialanxiety,fd66jw4,t1_fd16xwc,1578186245.0,I remember I was in this wrestling club(I was one of the managers) and the other managers whenever I would try to talk it’s like i’m the odd man out and they talk over me. But when i stayed quiet I felt like the odd man out. It was just a bad feeling and I quit. After I while I just gave up and then I became “Stand-offish”

worldnews,fcz5vsm,t1_fcz1u2f,1578094297.0,"I understand that the man was dangerous to not just Americans but his people as well. However, this did not mean that Trump should have killed him. How can you think possibly starting a war could link to preventing Americans from dying."

Advice,fcic1m1,t1_fci8xcg,1577660336.0,I’m 16 and I’m worried about telling my mom about my mental illness. Is it possible to schedule and appointment with a mental health provider without her consent ? We have medical insurance.

Anxiety,fciar39,t3_eh69it,1577659851.0,"Yes, this is one of the most horrible feelings, when someone who is supposed to be there for you and love you, instead judges you and makes you feel even worse about yourself. KNOWING you have a problem. I remember coming home from school a few weeks ago, my anxiety had gotten the best of me and I wanted to kill myself. I was crying in the bathroom and my Mom was trying to make me feel better. But my grandma ended up insulting me and making me feel worse. They just don’t understand how their words can be heavy. It’s sad."
Anxiety,fcia8gd,t3_eh29dj,1577659663.0,"The worst is when your anxiety falls into depression. Now it’s like you cant seem to get up and do anything. You want to lie in bed all day. You have no motivation for any of the things you used to like. Then bam! There’s that voice is your head(Anxiety) which makes you feel so worthless. It literally bullies you so hard. It makes you start fearing how little time you have left. So when you end up actually doing anything, it’s not genuine, and it’s not your best."
Anxiety,fci9w45,t1_fchapur,1577659539.0,"Omggg thank you so much for this. I did not even know any of this at all. The media makes ADHD seem like you just can’t stop shaking and your super energetic. For some it’s like that , but there’s way more to it. So thanks for this."
Anxiety,fci9j3n,t1_fcftlvv,1577659400.0,yesss this is exactly what I feel. These posts aren’t putting a literal definition to anxiety.
Anxiety,fci984r,t1_fcfkrti,1577659288.0,What’s some of your problems ?
Anxiety,fci8zjd,t1_fcdxpk9,1577659205.0,"Sometimes when people make these statements their not exactly trying to put a definition to what Anxiety in general is. They’re just trying to state how anxiety feels to them. And If your someone like me who relates, then it makes you feel so much better knowing you’re not alone."

Advice,fcagy48,t1_fca1dc0,1577569055.0,"This is kinda off topic. But you say your are Bipolar right? Well i’m scared to ask my mom to get diagnosed because I fear her reaction. Anyways could you tell me some symptoms that you can’t really find from a google search. I feel like I may have it but the thing is my moods don’t last for months. maybe a few weeks or just one month. Idk. And then when i’m in my mani mode I don’t do like  reckless things such as unprotected sex, etc. My reckless behavior is not as big if that makes sense."
socialanxiety,fc9xhii,t1_fc9ssey,1577559663.0,Thank you. This helped.
socialanxiety,fc9poy8,t3_egt3px,1577556312.0,I have social anxiety and it’s stemmed into depression. I’m just really scared to take medication because 1) before anything my mom will judge me first and just criticize me.(i’m 16 so I have to do it by her)  and 2)I’m afraid I will gain a dependency on them. Like when i’m not on it I just crash and my anxiety feels even worse.
socialanxiety,fc9p8eg,t3_egtqbp,1577556089.0,"I would say you should do your own grocery shopping. It seems like you feel really guilty about the worker. And to me it’s like you’re using the delivery to run away from the bigger issue. Start of small by just going to a local CVS or Rite Aid and buying snacks or lotion or whatever small things that are there. Or like maybe if you go out to eat one day instead of doing the drive thru, you actually go in and order inside. Just small little things to build your way up to the grocery store."
socialanxiety,fbyhdn5,t3_ef467e,1577216935.0,Yes. I have no choice my mom is gonna drag me. I deal with social anxiety and random moods of sadness where I feel so low and want to just kill myself(I don’t want to call it depression because I haven’t been diagnosed). So it’s either I stay home and be lonely and gets into my hole of sadness. Or I go to the party—be around people— but get my social anxiety and feel the overwhelming urge to come home and hide n
