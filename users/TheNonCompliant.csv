This so much. My husband and I were both military when we met and started dating. We were split up by an ocean and deployments for 2-3 years, planned it so we got nearer to each other while in a foreign country and could spend a little more time together for about a year, were split up again for another 2-ish years across an ocean, moved in finally and got married. We’re therefore both very independent and enjoy some things together but in any given week that can range from 90% to almost nothing except a television show episode or three. He’s more into gaming, I’m more into long hikes, he’s all about nostalgic cartoons, I’m a horror movie fan.  
  
I basically stopped volunteering how we met, especially to coworkers, because it sorta freaked them out. “How can you trust him? How often do you talk to each other? Isn’t he in a foreign country with other women? How is that even a relationship? Don’t you ever get lonely?” Insulting as fuck.  
  
Now I’m “just a mil spouse.” I do get a little, sometimes very, sad when he’s gone like anyone, but hey, I’m somewhat more prepared to handle it, amuse myself with my hobbies, and run the house than the average spouse in similar situations I guess. My family got really sappy about asking if I needed to stay with them while he was gone. I mean, I know that was coming from a concerned place of kindness but fuuuck no, I’m totally good."

Lady basically lives in a small, lonely set of warehouse-style buildings with nothing else around for hundreds of miles. She and the show play up that she’s a bear attack survivor from when one burst into her cabin or whatever. Sounds badass. Except it’s revealed in a semi-disjointed way that:  
  
1. The foxes in the area are scared of bears (i.e. because foxes can make a tasty snack if need be.)  
2. She feeds the local foxes.  
3. The local foxes act as “a warning system for bears” by running and hiding under the buildings.  
4. She and the camerawork regularly show foxes going under her cabin.  
5. At one point it’s mentioned that a bear dug a fox out from under a building.  
  
Took me too long to get it because I wasn’t paying too much attention but finally ended up rolling my eyes at the 3rd or 4th “bear invasion recap” with overly dramatic music, like “you’re not a badass survivor, you’re a complete idiot” and stopped watching the show."

Quick recap (because I often have to look it up myself):  
Similes use ""like"", as in ""My life without you now is like an unlit room.""  
Metaphors directly state the comparison: ""My life without you now is an unlit room.""  
  
If you're ever having trouble understanding a poem, the other thing is you may have to do a little history digging into the poet's life or into that era as it may have been a more commonly used phrase or slang at the time.

TrollXChromosomes,fdo5hki,t1_fdner3e,1578599242.0,"Ah, this one really bothers me and I’ve gotten into deep discussions about it elsewhere online and IRL. I’m also a woman who uses “female.” It’s often merely the best descriptive word to use grammatically or flow-wise when trying to differentiate by the physically identifiable and sometimes their-self-identifiable sex:  
  
1. You wouldn’t (or rather shouldn’t) say “woman artist/doctor/pilot” just like you wouldn’t say “man artist/doctor/pilot.” Or rather, you could....and I’ve heard people use it...but frankly it sounds very awkward and rather idiotic, and thereafter I’m going to rather insist you say “man actor, man singer, man prostitute, man gigolo, man cook, man dancer, man model, man mannequin, man doll, man Barbie, man author, man carpenter, man senator” when you’d otherwise use “male.”  
  
2. You could also say “lady _____” but that sounds old-fashioned and not always in a cute or fun way. It sounds even worse, imho, in everyday use than “female” as a Nice Guy(™) quip. Of course....again “gentleman doctor” and so forth would have to apply. Just saying...this is only my opinion but at least be consistent, folks.  
  
The correct one grammatically really is “female artist/doctor/pilot.” Just because there’s a Ferengi meme about it doesn’t mean the word itself is shit and getting angry about *the word itself* is like hating the word “moist.” Alternatively, it’s also not a slur, much as some people today are trying to make it one; get angry at how the word is being abused, not the word.  
  
It feels like my fellow women hating on this is as if they heard “vagina” or “breasts” used disgustingly too many times and now are trying to police how I’m describing my own body. Again, if you want to use “lady” or “woman” in a non-grammatically correct way, please go for it but 1. stay consistent, 2. be aware that others may think you’re ridiculous, and 3. understand you can’t necessarily successfully get offended on someone else’s behalf and tell others how to refer to a third party (the doctor/artist/plumber in these examples) unless of course it’s otherwise publicly known that said person uses certain self-descriptive words (i.e. usually applicable in the LGBTQ community) but even then.  
  
For those who say “you should just say doctor” please see: “Dr. L. Smith, Dr. M. Smith, or Dr. J. Smith?” “Uhh, not sure? I was told the female doctor.” “Oh, Dr. M. Smith. I’ll let her know!” It’s just...not that a big deal, really."

Actually picked up a lithograph print that was leaning against a dumpster some years back. Has a professor’s name, # of 16, the university, the year, etc. And yet I still wasn’t completely sure if it was done by him or by a student as a “imitate a style” type class because it’s definitely more of an early work, doesn’t seem to use any of the same paint/pen/whatever that he uses now, and [his style is so much more advanced now](https://www.duanereedgallery.com/Artists%20Pages/christ/christ.html) that mine looks more like a doodle or a “preparing for the paint version” thing.

Anyway was looking into it again recently and finally found a YouTube video presentation by him about how his art style has progressed, and there’s maybe a 5-10 second shot with one other piece that looked very similar. It’s not like I’d sell it, but I felt so accomplished to finally confirm that, yes, this was 99% likely to have been done by him because I know better where it was in his progression now. All told, that was probably only 6-8 hours of research, divided up over a couple days, because I had the information and because I cared enough.

Movies with badass female leads who actually look like they fight (vs. just floating around with guns or knives like most “lady spy / assassin / warrior” movies) are my longtime favourite. They’re often scattered in a few different genres and can sometimes be awkwardly difficult to find cause there’s a lot of crap out there; the discards tend to have all weak fights, like they couldn’t bother training to make it look halfway real, and no plot, or they’re basically porn, or look like they were shot by a middle-schooler. Favourites below if you’re interested.
  
A Vigilante (2018) is a slow moving film about abuse; Raze (2013) is basically just a very violent, death-exploitative blood-fest between every “realistic badass” actress of the last decade (such as the awesome Zoe Bell), imo thinly slotted into the horror genre for lack of another home; Revenge (2017) is a bit more “plot armor”-y but has a weirdly refreshing drug-fuelled revenge quest (considering that this normally only happens to men in movies), also “horror” i.e. just really violent; Haywire (2011), the only “woman on the run vs bad guys” type mainstream action movie I know of that hurts the female lead and doesn’t insta-heal her, instead acknowledging she’d still have to fight while hurt like any human being; and Furie (2018), action, super thin plot like many martial arts movies, a little too heavy-handed special effects-wise from what I remember with some fights but worth a watch.

>So I'm working as the receptionist at an apartment house. For context: we have 50+ apartments in the building, and they’re pretty much all different looking ones. Also, pictures on booking sites only display a couple of rooms, because we cannot upload that many pics to include all. One evening I get a call on the phone, and this guy is asking about the apartment seen in one of those pictures. I tell him we cannot guarantee him the exact apartment he saw there, and he agrees to come to our location so I can show him an apartment that is not occupied at the moment.  
  
>About an hour later arrives a really overweight guy with a gold chain thick as my finger around his neck, and in gold Adidas tracksuit. With him comes a tall, bald and very muscular guy. Mind you, this is in mid/eastern-Europe, but it is still an unusual sight, as we usually have foreign guests, but they were local. The big guy begins to talk and we recognize each other as the ones we talked to on the phone. Then we go and I show them an available apartment.  
  
>This actually is one of the nicest ones, a bit bigger than the usual and with more modern furniture. The big guy really seems to like it but I notice that the other guy is completely silent the whole time and has an expressionless face too, which I found a bit weird to begin with. Then we go back to reception, where they tell me that they need the room for six nights. I‘d assumed they’d need it for 1-2 nights, because that is what these walk-in guests want most of the time. Unfortunately the room I showed them is pre-booked for that time so we go to see another room that is available for six nights. This room has a bit older, more used furniture, and was also a bit smaller but it's the only available one for their time frame.  
  
>The big guy begins to criticize it and says things like how cheap quality it is, and that the price is too high for something like this. I say that I'm sorry and that this is our only available one for that time, but he continues to say these kinds of things as he walks all around the apartment and in and out of the rooms. This is still nothing unusual, I dealt with the same kind of people a couple of times, but then as the still silent other guy leaves the bathroom, he asks me the question:  
“Was someone killed in there?""  
  
>I was already weirded out a bit by him, so I gave a nervous laugh and answered that I do not know, but probably not - thinking it is a joke - but then he says ""I'm not joking."" After, the big guy tells me that Pete - the silent guy - is a medium and he feels these things.  
  
>I repeat to Pete, that I don't think anyone was murdered here, or we would know about it. He does not seem to believe me and goes back to the bathroom and suddenly grabs the shower curtain and throws it to the other side really quickly while, with a sudden movement, he looks behind it. After this, he turns around and calmy and quietly says to me again, that someone was killed here. He says they were stabbed with a knife. I nervously smile and try to repeat what I already told them before.  
  
>Finally, they decide to leave as they do not like the apartment, and to my relief they tell me they don't want to rent it. As we go down in the elevator, Pete shares another detail with us, as the big guy informs his gf over the phone that they won't be staying here. Pete confirms to the gf that indeed someone was stabbed there with a knife and he also tells that it happened last summer.  
  
>Our company has been the owner of that apartment for about ten years, and nothing of this sort has ever happened here, but they were seriously concerned about this murder, and it was pretty absurd to see these tough looking guys believe this.
  
> Got a bit long, sorry about that, had too much time at work. Happy Holidays!"
TrollXChromosomes,fbzoliw,t1_fbyuc9k,1577254123.0,"But if I say I’m not really a fan of any of the trilogies because IMO (like Rey) Luke and Anakin were also whiny, annoying, and overly stubborn, and that the whole series now stinks of tired, repetitive, unimaginative nepotism, suddenly it’s “well hey now” and I’m just a hateful overly-sensitive feminist who doesn’t understand the genius of the original films or how great Luke’s character was.  
  
Hey, misogynist racist fanboys...Luke was a Mary Sue first. He inherited it from Anakin-turned-Vader. He passed it on to Rey. If anything, it’s genetically passed on through the Force.  
  
The Mandalorian is pretty fun though. Hopefully they (Disney) can manage to stay away from anything rhyming with “Skywalker” in the future, fingers crossed."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fbuezkz,t1_fbudn6g,1577113237.0,"Hmm, agreed, and the original image to the article on my phone didn't help that confusion. It was a picture of a street of uninhabited homes.  
  
*Shrug* Either way, your city has a problem in my mind. From the photo commentary on that article:  
> Their family of eight lives in a three-bedroom apartment on south Federal Boulevard. Though housing large enough to accommodate the family of eight has become unaffordable, they will soon be moving to a five-bedroom home through Habitat for Humanity. Colorado has struggled to supply enough housing to match its growth. As a result, home prices and rents are soaring, making it particularly difficult for entry level and low-income buyers. Households earning less than $50,000 a year are diverting $2 billion in extra spending because of that lack of supply and it is putting a strain on the entire economy.  
  
[Homelessness is up 8.2%](https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/point-in-time-report-homelessness-up-8-2-in-denver-metro-area-compared-to-2018). Where there's homelessness, there's vacant homes (often from situations like the above where they can't afford their mortgage or rent). Where's there's vacant homes, there's areas like in OP's pic.  
  
*Sigh* Whatever my silly confusion over the article or your belief about developments, I *promise* you that your city has shitty areas. There is no city in the U.S. that doesn't have this problem and your city isn't so special that they're immune. But I can't tour guide your city from afar and I can't make you see those areas for what they are even if you find them. Anyway, I'm obviously done here, cause I either need more caffeine or less for my reading comprehension."
