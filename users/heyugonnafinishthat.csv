Sibelius,fe58gji,t3_enrm4q,1578866575.0,"I actually figured it out! Leaving the solution in case other folks have the same problem.

So there are two types of midi files, Type 1 and Type 0. Sibelius only recognizes Type 1 midi files. Ableton only exports midi as Type 0, but I read that most other DAWs can export Type 1. Luckily I recently got Logic.

**Here's how to do it in Logic:**

1. Start a new session, and import your midi file
2. Go to Logic>Preferences>General>Project Handling
3. Uncheck the box that says ""Export Midi File... saves single MIDI regions as Type 0""
   1. If you don't see that box, go to the ""Advanced"" tab in preferences and check the box that says ""show advanced options""
4. Exit Preferences and select the region you want to export as MIDI
5. Go to File>Export>Selection as MIDI file
6. Export your file!

This doesn't explain why MIDI doesn't play in iTunes anymore, but that's a problem for another day.

Hope this helps somebody - Sibelius support is trash so we have to stick together ;)"

AmItheAsshole,fdywiyj,t3_endpzm,1578784299.0,"NTA. That's all you can do: apologize, correct yourself, and do better next time.

Some pro tips - when someone in my life changes their pronouns and I know that I'm likely to mess it up, here's what I do:

* Save their pronouns along with their name in my phone: Izzy (they/them), Sam (she/her), etc.
* Set an alarm with a message in my phone on days when I'm going to see them, to remind myself in the morning what their pronouns are

Ngl it can take a long time to sink in. You're going to mess up sometimes, and when you do, it's actually better to *not* draw more attention to it by making a big dramatic apology. Just correct yourself and move on! You're doing great."

The Potatoes start out weighing 100lb, 99% water. So:

* 99lbs water
* 1lb ""actual potato""

After dehydration, there is still 1lb of ""actual potato"", but that 1lb now makes up 2% of the total weight. **That's double the percentage, so the total weight must be half.**

Simpler version: You have a group of four people (kids and adults) in a room, and 25% of them are kids. Adults gradually leave the room until 50% of the people in the room are kids. How many people are in the room now?
