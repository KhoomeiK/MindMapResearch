The mayor's office and the media/Gazelle - except the media/Gazelle were never really introduced as characters to the audience, so bringing them out as the villains at the end would have felt a little like cheating.

They motivate each other, but if anything, Gordy motivates Chris more. Chris was the one who thought he was worthless, that he wasn't smart until Gordy changes *Chris'* mindset that he can overcome his circumstances and become a lawyer. Gordy was already a writer (even if he didn't know it) and was feeling as though it wasn't important because he wasn't an athlete like his brother.

Nice write-up.

At essence, chili is a braise or a stew which people have cooked all over the world with whatever was available for centuries. Since chili  was just what people in this one particular area of the world called their braise or stew, there is no master or ""authentic"" recipe and there was no inventor. The fact is, it wasn't ""invented"" at all. Chili con carne and its predecessor chili colorado are actually a continuum of dishes that first became known in the late 19th century and on to this day."

movies,femx8p0,t3_epxbvr,1579271981.0,"The problem with Reiner's greatness is that his directorial style does not call attention to itself. You'd be hard-pressed to find a stylistic thread that runs through all of those films. He found incredible scripts, cast them perfectly and then appeared to just turn the camera on. But, of course, there's so much more to it than that. It's just that you can't see it. 

One of the things I think that really good directors do that doesn't appear onscreen as DIRECTING is work really well with actors to craft their performances. Think about how good Wil Wheaton was in Stand By Me. He was on his first film, he had to carry the movie's emotional core and he was incredible. That *had* to come from Reiner's direction. Think about James Caan in Misery. He's a legendary on-screen tough guy, but you'd never know it if that was the only film you ever saw with him. I'm not saying another director couldn't have gotten that performance out of Caan (he's a brilliant actor and would have done well with the part regardless), but I am saying that Reiner's style of directing likely helped him accomplish what he needed to. The same goes for Kathy Bates. That character could have been over the top, cartoonish, even a darkly comic role. But Reiner was talented enough to give her the room to create just enough humanity that there are moments when you almost feel sorry for her."

Do you personally give equal weight to every negative review you see? For myself, I personally don't. If I see a negative review on a product or restaurant, that might give me pause, but I don't just automatically assume their experience is a guarantee of mine.  I take it into some kind of consideration (depending on what it is and how it's written) and use that to formulate my own final decision. In my view, that's how things are supposed to work and why the idea of negative reviews are more beneficial than hurtful: before, I'd never have any idea of the bad things to look out for (for that matter, neither would the business until it was too late). Once I'm aware of the deficiencies, though, I can decide for myself if the risk outweighs the benefits."

AskAnAmerican,feaffqm,t1_fea2fd3,1578948046.0,"The per capita model falls apart for two main reasons. First, the model requires the assumption that populations are essentially the same everywhere: randomly take 100 people from 100 different places and we *should* see an equal distribution of crime over and over during repeated trials. I guess given an infinite number of trials this might be the case, but in reality it's simply going to matter *which* individuals get picked every time because criminal behavior is not random and it is not evenly distributed throughout the population. And since crime is individualized and not random  (for the vast majority of crimes) simply pulling populations from artificially constructed areas, like cities, has the same fundamental flaw in terms of comparing data. 

The next problem is that human beings physically have only so much capacity to interact with other human beings (either to criminally victimize them or to be criminally victimized by them). Think of this as a ""critical social mass."" It doesn't really matter if you live in a city of 100,000 or 8 million, your ability to meaningfully interact with X number of human beings (where X is the maximum number of human beings, whatever that number X may be) is going to be about the same because of the limits of physical time and physical proximity.

Taken together, and because crime itself is in actuality a statistically rare thing everywhere, artificially constructed areas (like cities) with larger populations have a much larger capacity to ""absorb"" the crime numbers to where it would appear crime is less likely to occur. 

>I mean, why are you assuming that bigger cities have to be more unsafe than smaller ones? 

I didn't assume anything and didn't use the words ""safe"" or ""unsafe.""

>If you didn't use a per capita model, New York would be more dangerous than a city of 200 people where everyone gets murdered in one year.

AskAnAmerican,fe7jiua,t3_eo0rtt,1578915436.0,"Of the top ten most populous cities in the US only three appear on the list: Chicago, #64, Philadelphia, #86, and Houston #59 and none even crack the top 50. This either means that NYC, L.A. (the two most populous) as well as the other five are doing something extraordinary or the crimes per capita model disproportionately disfavors smaller-to-mid-sized cities. 

Here's an example of what I mean: the city of [East Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Point,_Georgia), GA (#32) borders the southeastern corner of Atlanta (which didn't make the list) and while it's been its own entity since the 1870s, a lot of other studies would include it as a part of Atlanta's [MSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_area) or [CSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_statistical_area) because it shares the same economic, regional, cultural, etc. characteristics of Atlanta. 

Now since it is its own municipal entity, it is reasonable to say ""their crimes, their problems,"" after all East Point isn't [Buckhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckhead). But if they had used Atlanta's MSA or CSA, would Atlanta (and therefore East Point) have made the list at all? I would think probably not because the larger population would have driven down the crimes per capita number.

All of this is to say, larger metros may be ""benefitting"" (on this list) from crime being centralized in smaller areas, so the perception is that crime is worse in a lot of these smaller or mid-sized cities. If you were to separate various sub-sections of larger cities and analyze crime per capita there, would those areas show up as high-crime ""cities"" all on their own?

These kinds of lists kind have a good effect by ""shaming"" cities and citizens into trying to do more, but it seems like the real purpose is to just offer bragging rights to some cities/areas and not others."
AskAnAmerican,fe7e7bn,t3_eo26mn,1578913407.0,"Since it's hard to know what people outside of your own acquaintanceship do in private, I think it's reasonable to use restaurants as a proxy for what people in general really do at home. If that premise is acceptable, then I would say that this is a relatively rare thing for anyone over the age of 10. Most Americans likely drink iced tea, soda, water, beer, or wine because if milk was the preferred beverage at home, more people would probably ask for that at restaurants and they would tend to specifically offer it as an option to adults which they never do. So, maybe some people do. Most people probably don't. There *was* a big advertising campaign many years ago, but it's long since expired and I don't think it was particularly successful. FWIW, the campaign was only intended to get more people to drink milk on some kind of a regular basis, not specifically as a great drink with meals. It seemed more like they were going for milk as a ""healthy"" beverage with lots of protein and vitamins, not as something that went well with food."

Generally, though, I think people from New England and other northeastern areas tend to be as proud if not more so than people  from the south. They may not use the exact word, but their devotion to the places they grew up gets expressed in a lot of ways: sports teams is an obvious one, but also they tend to tell people at any/every opportunity about where they are from and how it's different (usually as a proxy for ""better""), they tend to hang on to their accents instead of moderating them or dissolving them and a lot of times they end up moving back home after a period.  None of this is necessarily bad, but it is in contrast to the implication of the thread title that the south somehow expresses more pride in their states than northerners do.

One other thing: outside of baseball fans, I really don't hear ""yankee"" thrown around much anymore unless it's being used more or less ironically. It's kind of like carpetbagger.

There are always lots of ""shortlists"" floating around on every major movie for who could be good for a part, but no one is a lock for it until they sign the contract (and not even then, necessarily; just ask Eric Stolz about Back to the Future). 

Hamlin may have *ensured* he would never get the part by talking about Spielberg, but that doesn't mean he would have gotten he role if he had kept his mouth shut."

There was a Republican primary for the special election to replace him and one of the candidates did a ""push-poll"" targeting the front-runner. As a Democrat, it was weird to hear the questions basically slamming the candidate I knew was likely to win the nomination in a manner that wasn't coming from the left, like  ""do you think Candidate X is really *conservative* enough to represent our district?"" But it was hard to answer them the way I actually felt because the wording was so twisted and clearly assumed I was a Republican."

We all know they're fooling us and there's still an immense amount of craftsmanship that goes into the ~~tricks~~ illusions, confederates or not.

youseeingthisshit,fcryw3a,t1_fcfluxx,1577908603.0,"Years ago, we saw David Copperfield in Las Vegas. As we sat down, we were approached by one of his people and asked if we would like to be part of the show. Basically, Copperfield had this joke he liked to do kind of making fun of people who come to the show late. Of course, to do the joke they actually have to have someone coming late and those people need to be seated down front for everyone to see them come in. We ended up getting better seats, which was great, and we only had to miss the first ~~trick~~ illusion (we saw it from the doorway into the theater anyway, so we didn't really miss anything). We felt really lucky to be selected and asked if we could meet Copperfield after the show. The assistant said she'd look into it and we should wait around after it was over.

The thing is: during the show I noticed that almost all of his big stage ~~tricks~~ illusions involved people from the audience and it suddenly occurred to me that probably *all* of those people had been approached beforehand to participate like we were. And I'm sure some of them had to be told that when certain things happen, they're to move to certain areas of the stage or do other things to make the magic ~~trick~~ illusion work. It was still a fun show and I certainly enjoyed myself, but we left after it was over because we figured *everybody* who participated in the show would probably stick around to meet him and it wasn't really that important to us anyway.

So, I'm just saying: maybe the wife from the cruise ship was in on it after all and she's just enjoying keeping the secret from the husband."
