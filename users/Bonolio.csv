conspiracy,ff7ag9f,t1_ff6z896,1579644612.0,"In Australia, I see one main potential reason to support the continuance on the Monarch as head of state.   
If the queen believes the Government has gone too far down a wrong path see can perform a reset and dissolve the government.        
She does not get to choose the new government or ban the old one, it is essentially a forced election.    
She rarely ever uses this power because she knows that if she abuses this power, then she is only a referendum away from removal as head of state.   
I am not saying this is the best way to handle this or provide this safe guard, but considering how untrustworthy your average elected official is, I am not completely against having an individual with different vested interests act as a balance.     
    
I am completely aware that many consider the idea of a foreign individual having this power as a travesty."

Your reply feels very much like the kind of reply that a random non-Martian person on reddit might make.

Not a lot, because I mean, no one really got hurt.     
Unless my assertion that you might be an alien in some way triggered some pain, in which case I do apologise, but also suggest that you should consider toughening up a little bit and stop being such a whiny little bitch.

DaystromInstitute,fejbk2k,t1_fej9l2i,1579165733.0,"It seems that in each scenario that this occurs the crew is at a loss at what to do, which of course is a major point of most of the plot lines.   
Ideally you would think that considering how many crew members have been duplicated over the years that star fleet/the federation would have legal precedent for the scenario.    
I suspect it would also depend a lot on the cause/method of the duplication.   
If for example one individual attempts to teleport to a planet and due to an anomalous event they arrive at the planet while also being rematerialised  on the ship, you would have a scenario where both of the individuals would essentially be the original.    
Other scenarios that lead to a far clearer knowledge of which is the original and which is the duplicate would have a far more obvious practical solution, while still remaining complex on a philosophical/moral point of view.   
Even in clear cases of which is the duplicate, the method is probably important.    
Did the process involve splitting or copying for instance.    
I could imagine that a individual split from the original could hold far more claim to a continuance of original material personhood whereas a created copy whilst maintaining a continuance of identity, is in fact a wholly new entity.      
I can imagine numerous other scenarios and I imagine numerous other interpretation of my above scenarios.     
In summation, I have really just asked more questions and posed further variations without answering your question.

As far as pedophiles go, the Catholic Church has its fair share, but so does any organisation where figures of authority are in close contact with children.    
My problem is the tradition of hiding these crimes to protect the reputation of the church.     
The Catholic Church is improving slowly, but with something like this they should have never chosen to deal with pedophiles internally.    
The pedophiles are an individual problem, but the protection and hiding of these pedophiles is a crime that is squarely on the shoulders of the church itself.   
The fact that you all belong to a religion that worships before the figure of a man being tortured to death and that you perform ritual cannibalism is probably also not great on the PR side.
