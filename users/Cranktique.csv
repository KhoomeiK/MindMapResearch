It did find correlation between people exhibiting violent / aggressive behaviour and people playing violent video games, and suggests that this may have resulted in a decrease in sensitivity to violent / aggressive behaviour and a decrease in empathy, but, it has not researched the developmental effects violent video games have (which is what we are talking about).  Therefore, to me, the question remains.  Do violent video games cause violence and aggression, or, do violent video games attract violent and aggressive people?  Until they study the developmental effects, or the effects on younger subjects, they can not rule one way or another.  It also does not measure if there is any increase in violent / aggressive behaviour outside of playing the games.  I would like to point out that people engaged in playing physical, contact sports such as football or hockey tend to exhibit more violent and aggressive behaviour while playing the sports, but it does not frequently translate to other area’s of the players life (barring concussions and such)."

OurPresident,feoc6ni,t1_feo5p8f,1579298145.0,"Unethical?  Whats unethical is charging $300 for a fucking vial of insulin, a drug patent sold for $1 and that costs $15 to produce.  Thats a 2000% markup.

What is unethical is Americans dying because they can’t afford to pay $150 for a fucking asthma inhaler.

What’s unethical is politicians and talking heads telling Americans facing insolvency to pull themselves up by their boot straps, while they use tax dollars to cut multi-million dollar cheques to bail out multi-billionaires dollar corporations that pay $0 in taxes.

It isn’t shifting the debt, it is implementing laws putting a statute of limitations on medical debts and regulating how it’s enforced.

It isn’t increasing taxes, it is responsibly allocating taxes.  For the people, by the people.  Why should a persons tax dollars bail out a corporation that mismanaged their business?  What happened to capitalism?  Why should the wealthy benefit from safety nets designed to ensure they stay wealthy, while the mediocre and poor can fall into ruin over an unexpected case of appendicitis?

Do you know why insulin isn’t $300 a vial in Canada?  Because our government is the single payer for our healthcare system.  We all pay for it, but instead of 39 million individually negotiated transactions, our government takes the bill.  Our government looks at the pharmaceutical companies proposed price for these drugs like insulin.  If it isn’t a reasonable price, our government tells them to go fuck themselves.  Do you know what pharmaceutical companies do when 39 million potential customers collectively tell them to go fuck themselves?  They lower their prices.  Then, their competition lowers it’s price.  This carries on, as they compete for market share, and we are left with a reasonable $35 for a vial of insulin.  That sounds more like capitalism to me, then your broken ass system.  The consumers keep the power.

When an illegal immigrant goes into an er room in the US with a diabetic episode, the hospital has to treat him.  They give him insulin.  They paid the pharmaceutical company for that insulin, they mark it up and charge the US government.  Your taxes are already paying very steep medical bills, but you are getting bad value for your dollars because no one is negotiating on your behalf.

Unethical, give me a fucking break."

There are many variables, naturally, that require assumptions to be made.  Variables like how much carbon will be emitted have to be estimated.  The model the IPCC likes to show is the one I described.  It assumes the rest of the world will industrialize, which is possible, but that their end point and means will be as ours was/is.  The one they show is the worst case scenario, and they show it because it is scary.  The articles I linked show some evidence to the contrary.  The evidence they describe points to a more moderate effect of climate change, as opposed to catastrophic.

I am not denying or refuting climate change.  It is real, we see it happening, and little good will come out of it.  All that said, I do not believe it is an extinction level event.  To me, the worst part is that the parts of the world most adversely effected will be 3rd world countries."

They are still using the “worst case scenario” climate model developed by the IPCC in 2013 and have not updated it.  The model assumes that not only will the rest of the world industrialize by 2070, but that technology will not advance.  It assumes that the rest of the 3rd world will ramp up to meet our level of industrialization and nothing else will change.

Any time this is pointed out by climatologists they are shunned from the community.  Those who have put out papers and research indicating that it will not be an extinction event are committing career suicide.  People who straight out deny it is happening definitely lack a certain astuteness, but it is not the end all of climate events we need to stress about.  At some point in the next 10000 - 20000 years this interglacial warming period will end, and when it does the ice age we are in will come back.  When the ice age resurges you can expect 80% of the population to die very quickly.  With the warming we will have swaths of land previously permafrost that will become farmable.  The growing season throughout north america and europe will be longer and warmer.

The only true problem with the shift in climate is the rapid onset.  History has shown us that not only has the world been hotter than it is about to be, but carbon levels have been higher.  What’s more is warming periods throughout human history have always proven to be an economic and quality of life boon.  

We need to move away from fossil fuels, but we also need to remember that 4.9 billion people on this planet do not enjoy the quality of life we do, and they are going to rightfully pursue that quality of life.  All the time on reddit I see these comments about blowing up the energy industry, because people are going to DIE from climate change.  These comments totally oblivious to the amount of death we would see within 3 weeks if we did as they want.

Carbon capture and storage, hydrogen fuel, renewables, and responsible mining / resource extraction are how we minimize the impacts long term.  Mega projects, like seawalls and dams are how we minimize the impacts short term.

Largely, the reason for the price inflation in the US is because they have a collective monopoly and the customer is at a disadvantage.  Countries with public healthcare have a single payer system.  The hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, ect.  All have to bargain with the universal system for their prices.  If a drug company does not lower their price to the approved price for insulin, for example, they are not allowed to sell the product.  That means they only take a reasonable profit margin on products.  In the US they can take what ever margin they want, hence the all to common 500% mark ups.

politics,fe9d45s,t3_eo2nel,1578936475.0,"All the comments calling this action insane and corrupt don’t pay attention to what these groups are willing to do.

In Canada, they have vandalized and sabotaged sites, as well as set up booby traps for workers.  When pipelines are being built they like to dump a bunch of metal pieces into the unfinished line.  If not caught, when the line is pressurized it can result in a catastrophic failure with the potential to injure or kill workers.

They have driven metal spikes into trees, that become ballistics when struck with a chain saw, they will tamper with equipment and leave spikes on roads.  

Straight up, some of these groups are terrorists.  Just because they are “doing it for the environment” does not give them to right to do the things they do.  Some of them are extremist, whether you agree with their cause or not, and will use indirect violence or cause massive environmental disasters just to win the war of public perception."

I can promise you this regime surpasses any atrocity you can name that the Americans committed.  From the early days, in 1980, when the Iranians took 13-16 year old iranian children, hung a silver key on their neck and told them that key would open the door to paradise.

During the establishment and expansion of the persian empire from 550 BC - 300 BC (also during the greco-persian wars) mass slavery was not practiced.  There were slaves, and also “semi-slaves”.  Most slaves were prisoners of war, though they had laws requiring they be treated humanely, not be subject to violence and given rest.  People could not sell their own freedom and enslaving people for debts was very regulated, so to speak.  If people couldn’t pay by an appointed deadline, they or their children could be taken as slaves (though they were more “free labourers”).  They were expected to work until they had paid off the value of their debt, and could not be sold to a 3rd party.  There were relatively few slaves in the country, compared to their overall population."
