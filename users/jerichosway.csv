Tinder,fe9hhkl,t1_fe9gqec,1578937617.0,"Lol that happens. Generally I've found that girls that are even worth taking out will give you a better opener. The other types seem to be expecting the guy to carry the bulk of the conversation, and I just dont have any interest or the time for a girl like that.


Plus, if that's what they think is an acceptable conversational engagement, can you imagine going on a date with them? That's a hard unmatch, personally."
Tinder,fe9cnz9,t1_fe9chbk,1578936418.0,Look at their post history. It's a troll account
Tinder,fe8v3s9,t1_fe7m7v7,1578931278.0,Right cuz according to your comment history you're simultaneously a married man but also a woman who has slept with over 100 men.

Tinder,fe8tbka,t1_fe8ta2q,1578930623.0,Good luck!
Tinder,fe8t4bu,t1_fe8sojo,1578930510.0,"Hard to say. Probably not though, because of what I stated. Girls on Tinder are often either looking for an ego boost, or just broke up with someone and looking for potential prospects in the future/a rebound, or lastly, and unfortunately less likely, actually looking to date. So, because of that it's easier to just download and swipe through for fun without really caring much about the outcome, as there is no obligation to actually converse with your match. The girls of Bumble are actually more committed to engaging in a relationship of some sort because of what matching requires. 

So, likely not as populated, but the women are higher quality from what I've seen. I'm seeing/talking to 2 girls right now off of it, and dated another one from it for a while."

funny,fe8sk8n,t1_fe8rsbi,1578930152.0,The cringe is the shitty dancing while your friend tapes.
Tinder,fe8s3tr,t1_fe8rp1r,1578930078.0,"Well, for me it's mostly because if you match the girl actually has to initiate the conversation, which means they are engaged enough in actually talking to you since matching with someone comes with a 24 hr countdown to actually start the convo, or the match disappears. 


Basically girls on Bumble give a shit more and aren't just looking for an ego boost nearly as much as the women of Tinder."
