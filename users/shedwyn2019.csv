I have moved multiple times, in search of a better life, but my issues traveled with me, even though they were briefly forgotten with the excitement of the move.  

Everyone else said good advice:  It will only be good and healthy if you are able to make healthy changes.  Best of luck, whatever you decide."

I think, unless your job is truly a safety job, drug tests should not be necessary.  
  1) who cares what you do in your off hours?  
  2) most are inaccurate - presumably they should care if you are using AT work, and with some of this, namely marijuana, it is so stupidly inaccurate as to peg someone who used, for example, 2 WEEKS prior.  This war on drugs is a massive failure and has hurt so many more people than it has ""helped""."
dogs,fenk7yv,t3_eq28nv,1579286470.0,"1. There is a place for ESA in the world - animals that can be comforting/supportive without requiring a huge, expensive training program
2. People abuse this just so Fluffy and Rocco can travel on the plane with them
3. There are psychologists out there who should have their degrees nullified because they will ""diagnose"" someone over the internet and ""prescribe"" an animal
4. I obtained the letter marking my ordinarily trained dog as an ESA from my primary care physician because I could not afford therapy at the time and my doc reluctantly wrote it.  My mental health stands on a 3 legged stool: one leg being my dog.  I'm now in special therapy trying to gain some independence but until then, I need my dog.  I obtained the letter years ago because I lived in a very dog unfriendly rental market and it can have some sway in that case.
5. Even if you have a GENUINE ESA, you should consider the impact of your large/smelly/allergenic ESA on other passengers/shoppers and consider other ways to travel or shop.  SERVICE dogs should be allowed everywhere - they have been trained at great expense and effort to handle those environments - your ESA has not and is NOT in the same class.  
6. If you do not genuinely have an emotional need, due to mental health, or disability, for an ESA and  just don't want to pay for a dog walker/dog hotel and you have  procured one of these ghastly fake certificates - check your privilege, check your entitlement.  Reconsider what you are doing.  
7. If you are marking your dog as a SERVICE dog when they are NOT - you disgust me and should be ashamed of yourself.  You are no better than someone who uses Granny's handicap placard to get a parking space close to the front of the store."

Netflix

Kooky:  Santa Clarita Diet, I don't \*think\* there is nudity, if tehre is it is pretty limited/brief, but I don't think there is any at all.

Great British Bake Off/Baking Show - no nudity whatsoever

Grace & Frankie may have some nudity, but I think it is all older person nudity, which might be less triggering

dogs,fdl2f8a,t3_elvk51,1578515907.0,"As a rule - I think therapy dogs in school are a brilliant idea.  More, please!  However, I think families should be alerted and  children who have dog fears should be considered with regard to room assignments and dog visits to classrooms.

Specific to this case:

Is this a certified therapy dog who has FINISHED training or just the teacher's pet and/or a therapy dog IN training?

And is the dog being given breaks where it can be alone and untouched or is it constantly being in contact and under stimulation?

I have never heard of a therapy dog being ""on"" duty for more than a couple hours at a time, and I've personally known people who had trained therapy dogs they took to nursing homes and hospitals."

dogs,fdh8uyt,t1_fdh6f5z,1578417900.0,"I think this person has serious issues of their own, and the dog permits them to have an outlet.  The roommate needs to find an outlet that is not another sentient being - a stuffed animal, a game, a punching bag.  If they cannot see that, then they are a sociopath.  

I read a book once where the person plucked their dog bare in spots because plucking their eyelashes was a coping mechanism, and they transferred that behavior to the dog, but in that case it wasn't really hurting or frightening the dog. 

   
If you do not feel you can approach the roommate (after speaking with someone with the ASPCA and/or a psychologist) to discuss this bad behavior, I suggest a nanny cam and then sharing the footage with the local authorities.  Involving this person's family may also be in order as I suspect that they are going ""through some stuff"" and are trying to handle it on their own and should not be.    


Barring that - if the dog isn't chipped, kidnap it, drive it at least an hour away to a no kill shelter and say you found it tied to a signpost outside of town."

If it is easier to stick it out - you can change your classes to be more basic requirements (math, literature, science) so you can feel less weight.  But I advise you to consider taking time off.

BPD,fdeeb3r,t3_ekxm0p,1578337152.0,"DO NOT LOCK YOURSELF INTO A MAJOR YOUR FIRST YEAR!    
I'm a 48 y.o. who did that and has regretted it ever since.  Take time, explore, really gauge your reaction to the class/topic.  

Nothing wrong with taking a year to see what it is like (you goign to 4 yr or 2 yr first?  2yr is cheaper, makes you feel freer to explor) and then taking a year off to process, then going back.  A modified gap year, I call it.  

Don't let anyone push you into graduating and rush you into picking a major.  And know that what degree you get does not have to define what you do when you are out of college.  

I feel for you.  Do not let yourself be pushed, by others or yourself.  Explore. The first two years should be about exploring subjects, even subject you thought you sucked at in high school.  You are into Graphic Design - what about User Experience - a mix of design and psychology?  

If you have signed into some art school that will force you into studying art over any other subject, you do not have to go.  YOu can back out.  YOu can take a year off and take community college classes while you think.  This is YOUR life.  Take your time to enjoy it, and to think about what you want.  

I speak from deep, regretful experience.  I majored in Theatre, badly, declared in my 1st year.  There was so much more I probably would have enjoyed better and succeeded at.  Let no one rush you.  YOu are 18.  YOu may feel like you don't have time, but looking back 30 years - you absolutely do.  Please try to trust me.  YOu have time. 

Hell, we will soon run our of plumbers and electricians, or advanced manufacturing.  If you want a  solid career and any hands on work appeals, you could consider that.  

Good luck.  Good luck.  Hang in there.  It will be okay.  It has to be okay."
weaving,fdedehi,t3_ekxxic,1578336586.0,"I am a novice and I found a warping board to be incredibly useful, that plus yarn on the cone that pleases me.  

I like The Woolery ( [https://woolery.com/about-us/](https://woolery.com/about-us/) )for general supplies, but there are a number of on line stores that sell yarn.  8/2 cotton is the recommended beginner, but 6/2 and 3/2 weave up faster as they are thicker.  I like that as I am impatient.  I wish I had created some weights to hang off my warp to add tension to make up for me doing a lousy job warping.  I keep meaning to get fishing weights and wire and just make soemthign up.  Depending upon how loose the thread, may need more weight.

Today I feel almost okay.  I'm at 900mg lithium, 20 Prozac, which is just to help me get off cymbalta.  I think I""m going to start tapering that off next week.  

I hvae a booster scheduled for Monday.  Hoping that I will be able to go a full 21 days to next infusion."
BPD,fcxnuou,t3_ejgx6v,1578067369.0,"You should only be on medication if you and your therapy team think it is helpful.  If you are taking other steps to make changes to your mood (like DBT) and feel the anti-depressant is not helpful, don't do it.  Although, they (SSRI) are all a little different.

I've only taken 8, or 9, and am on Prozac just to get me off the cymbalta (hell to get off cymbalta - do NOT go on that one lightly) but we are trying lithium ON TOP OF ketamine infusions, which haven't been lasting as long as I hoped.  

There is a (expensive) genetic test that can be done to tell you which medications will be effective for you.  At this point, I've ruled out all SSRIs and SSNRIs since I have tried several and they do jack all.  Lithium may be effective, but we haven't cranked the dose very high (only 900mg now).  I want to do the test.  I also want to try MD with LSD or psilocybin since I've heard good things...and they would be cheaper than ketamine.  

If you have finding a way to keep your depression in check without medication, that is great.  Just make sure it is  sustainable and you have a safety net if something ""bad"" happens which might turn your mind dark.  

Good luck."
