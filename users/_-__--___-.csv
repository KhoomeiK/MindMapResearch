Of course there will be bad actors who will place them in inappropriate locations... that's not the game developers problem, and anyone who trespasses for a fucking game should hold 100% of the blame.

If I gave you advice to take a shortcut through a restricted area and you do so and get arrested am I in legal trouble for giving you the shortcut? NO, I am not... you are in trouble for trespassing.

Welcome to the real world, the people who actually commit the crime are the ones to blame, not a fucking game developer who made a cool game that millions enjoy. I don't think you understand the technical difficulty of making a game like this and ensuring that the POI's are never in ""bad"" locations... it's practically impossible."

Edit: Don't just downvote me, answer the question: Is that all that matters? I think everyone agrees that you can advance your position in life through immoral or unethical means...

However I almost agree with your dad... at 16 if you're having to scrape money together to buy a computer then there are more important things to spend it on soon, like a car or your continued education. You are nearing a transition between childhood and adulthood and having a decent amount of money saved away can make that transition much easier.

Your build is okay, AUS prices suck apparently. Tell your dad I'm a 38 year old firmware engineer and my last build (i5-3570k / R9 390x) lasted nearly 5 years before I felt any pressure at all to upgrade... he is just plain wrong about the 2 year thing..."
