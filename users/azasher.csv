todayilearned,ff9uawx,t1_ff9akew,1579721493.0,They also wrote his name on the embassy
todayilearned,ff967ap,t1_ff94vc3,1579705792.0,It's weird they'd send a general to negotiate rather than a diplomat. Also very weird they would send the guy who was semi responsible for the attack on the embassy less than a week prior.

gundeals,ff20cly,t1_ff0b73r,1579490435.0,"I had to drill one today and let me tell you the nitride is pretty hard and thick, it gave carbide drill bits a run for their money. Also mine shoots alright but who knows when it's luck of the draw."
gundeals,ff1y5su,t1_ff1ugg4,1579488873.0,"They sent me one for free when I called, also I think they fixed it."
gundeals,ff1xufk,t3_er4qjr,1579488655.0,"I bought one a couple weeks ago, they are more or less good to go with the exception of a missing indexing pin and an under sized gas port. This is really easy to install, and I'm surprised everyone here who brags about building their own AR pisses and moans about drilling a gas port and installing a pin."
gundeals,ff1xe5p,t1_ff1vm3y,1579488356.0,"I bought one a couple weeks ago, the pin install is really easy. Although the gas port hole measured a bit small and was undergassed when I assembled, I had to redrill."
worldnews,fe67nf5,t1_fe67ae3,1578883608.0,I agree with your point that the original tariffs do not target human rights. The point I was trying to make is that trump is causing damage to China which I believe itself is a noble goal. To me the right thing done for the wrong reasons is still the right thing.
worldnews,fe66zey,t1_fe66isy,1578883194.0,So in this instance trade is tied in with human rights.
worldnews,fe65xys,t1_fe64v0n,1578882528.0,"That's fair, also I believe trump did sign a bill that reinforces the rights of people in Hong Kong."

weekendgunnit,fcwsnj9,t1_fcw7y4b,1578035992.0,Why would a religion which is 3000 years older than jesus and has no written concept of hell have any references in the talmud to what you just said?

oldfreefolk,fcjk0ze,t1_fcjjqxh,1577690696.0,I'm just saying you could put the mandalorian in any of the situations the witcher faces and vice versa and the outcome would be the same.
oldfreefolk,fcjh4ss,t1_fcjg66u,1577687399.0,"Main character talks about as much as a Clint Eastwood character, gets paid to hunt stuff down, has a mythical reputation but still not liked and eventually goes on to protect a magical and cute child who would otherwise empower evil. Roach is the mandalorians ship, ciri is baby Yoda, and the south is basically the empire."
