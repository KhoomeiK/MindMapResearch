depression,fegu03e,t3_eoxun3,1579102501.0,"I understand this. It becomes a part of you somehow so that when things do get better, it doesn't feel like yourself.

I mean, at least that's what I feel all this time. Somehow all the pain feels more comfortable than when it isn't there. I feel paranoid when things get better because I know it will get even worse."
