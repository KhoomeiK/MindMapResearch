I see you posting this idea constantly. What in the world makes you think the tourism industry is to blame for inflated housing costs in San Diego? And do you have specific examples of ""companies hiring people from out of the area to move here and undercut the market"", or is it just another bizarre conspiracy that you came up with?  

A housing shortage exists in most major cities across the country. It's a complex problem with many contributing factors, one of the main ones being an exponential increase in population in conjunction with a slow-down in new building. Another is that cities are relatively more desirable in the modern age. 

The San Diego tourism industry isn't somehow secretly behind this phenomenon."
