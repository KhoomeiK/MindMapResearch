LSU,fecz3kk,t3_eohap2,1578990646.0,"Big part of why LSU cancelled because they don’t want students driving to school drunk/hungover/just plain sleep-deprived tomorrow morning. 

If that’s not admirable concern for students’ welfare then I don’t know what is, I don’t much care if this asshat thinks it doesn’t make us a “real school”."
CFB,fecy0e3,t1_fe8jcc4,1578989241.0,"Holy shit, small world. My sister is a 4th year at the vet school and was (jokingly) pissed about not getting off today. She still stayed up and watched the game with me, even though she has to be up at 5am tomorrow for rounds!

(Me, on the other hand, I’m a 4th year at the main college, so I don’t start until Wednesday ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)"
TwilightZone,feccr9c,t1_fe6th4l,1578970884.0,"Yes, the characters end up alright. 

But the *implications* of the episode — there are dimensional holes that can rip open in somewhere as mundane as your child’s bedroom, which can swallow you/your loved ones whole, without a trace, and leave you/them trapped in a reality-defying hellscape? 

THAT is what I mean when I say the episode leaves you in a scary/unsettling place, even though the girl and dog end up okay."

aww,fdu9j4g,t1_fdu82m6,1578729917.0,"A simple google search disproves this. 
“Studies show that around 2 years of age, children start to show genuine empathy, understanding how other people feel even when they don't feel the same way themselves. And not only do they feel another person's pain, but they actually try to soothe it.”"
aww,fdo9ww6,t1_fdmzqqw,1578601410.0,"That’s fucking stupid, I’m sorry you had to deal with that. Having a mature-friendly yard is great, and whether or not it’s “well-maintained” (whatever the fuck that means, considering it’s a NATURAL yard with wildflowers) should be a non-issue.

Planting wildflowers and natural landscapes is so important. Thank you for helping the pollinators :)"
aww,fdmjdce,t1_fdlyux6,1578552040.0,They don’t allow you to have bees in here.
aww,fdmj7mk,t1_fdmeybg,1578551868.0,Do you mind saying what state you’re in? Because holy shit that is insane.
TwilightZone,fdk8blx,t3_elmez3,1578498370.0,This is really nice! I would totally buy it if I weren’t a broke student haha. Well done!
Cyclicvomiting,fczdcr5,t1_fcyztgb,1578098670.0,"Oops, sorry, I completely missed the part where you mentioned Motrin. Yeah it might do more harm than good then, for you."
Cyclicvomiting,fcyy0uz,t1_fcysyz9,1578089583.0,"Yep, I got the prescription from my orthopedic doctor as treatment for my winged scapula pain.  

Since Tylenol is not an NSAID, it makes sense that it would not help your CVS — it doesn’t inhibit any COX receptors. 
Maybe try over the counter NSAIDs (to name a few: aspirin, Advil/ibuprofen, naproxen/Aleve). Because they are non-specific COX inhibitors, they might not work as well as Meloxicam since it ONLY inhibits COX2 (the other benefit of being a specific inhibitor is that it has fewer gastrointestinal side effects — other, nonspecific NSAIDs like ibuprofen can cause an increase in stomach acid production, which can cause heartburn/non-CVS-related stomach pain).

So in short, I would try meloxicam if you can — you do need a prescription, but it’s not a controlled substance or anything — and if you can’t, I would try OTC NSAIDs. They’re nonspecific, but they do still inhibit COX2."
TwilightZone,fcp99qo,t1_fcozmsp,1577854848.0,"It’s my favorite episode too, actually D:"
TwilightZone,fco8jd8,t1_fcncaj0,1577826152.0,"I loooove Third From the Sun. 

I’ve always considered the “off angle” to be a hint that *this isn’t Earth*; it, combines with other subtle hints like the strange looking phone, the weird home decorations, and the avoidance of dropping any country names all are there to subtly point you towards the twist. It’s one of the reasons I find the episode brilliant."
TwilightZone,fco89ah,t1_fcmq2o6,1577825971.0,"Ooo, yeah, those are good ones too. Although as much as I *love* Maple Street, I think I find it more sobering than “scary.” Kind of like how I view People Are Alike All Over or The Shelter.

I also think that while Twenty-Two is scary *in the midst* of the episode, it’s not as scary once you reach the end and realize what’s been going on; and for that it loses some of its fear-factor in my mind. If anything it’s kind of uplifting; she was basically given another chance at life. I feel the exact same way about episodes like Living Doll and After Hours; scary “in the moment,” but not so much after the final reveal. 

Whereas the others on my list are scary all the way through, including where the episode leaves you. 

Ah, another honorable mention - Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up. I actually don’t find it *that* scary anymore, but 8-year-old me thought it was terrifying :p"
TwilightZone,fco7b7e,t1_fcno04i,1577825460.0,"I love love love the appreciation for Walking Distance and Third From the Sun here! Walking distance is my favorite as well, and Third From the Sun is in my top five :D

Although, like you, this is my sentimental list, not my “objectively ranked” list."
TwilightZone,fco69uq,t1_fcnoavz,1577824881.0,"exactly! And there’s nothing you can do to stop it/change your circumstances, because some supernatural  “other” that has decided you should no longer exist. It gives me chills to think about, even after seeing the episode hundreds of times at this point."
TwilightZone,fcmo62v,t1_fcmdf8c,1577783897.0,"The Dummy is definitely pretty high on my “scariest” list, for sure. Probably #2 actually. But, I dunno, there’s just something so existentially horrifying and dread-inducing about When the Sky Was Opened; it just gets me, y’know? 


Some honorable mentions for “scariest”: It’s a Good Life, Midnight Sun, Person or Persons Unknown, The Hitchhiker, Death Ship, Little Girl Lost, and Mirror Image. All scary in their own ways."
TwilightZone,fcl2jha,t3_ehqbon,1577738410.0,"Definitely a great episode; one of my favorites and arguably Matheson’s best contribution to the show.

It also holds the distinct honor (?) of being my personal “scariest episode”; no other episode terrifies me more/gives me more existential dread. So that’s something, I guess!"
PrequelMemes,fbwc7x3,t1_fbv2ebf,1577146099.0,You might say... this is getting out of hand.
