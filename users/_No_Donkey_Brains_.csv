You can’t prevent a person fleeing war, persecution, and suffering. But these people are in turkey trying to cross into the EU, they aren’t fleeing war, persecution, and suffering anymore.

As for the commuter trains, no that’s not really a thing in the US. Most major American cities will have a subway or metro system but it’s not often very effective.

A train isn’t a mobile office, it’s just a slightly larger seat than economy class on a plane. The added time in a train eats into productivity versus just getting to your destination as soon as possible and finding a place to work actually uninterrupted. 

A short train ride (under 5 hours), fine then I’d say it’s probably an ok trade off. A longer train ride than that and you’re wasting company time (at least at my firm that’s what the policy is).

I think Reddit’s being a little ridiculous here. You *can* work throughout a flight, it’s not going to be as comfortable as a train where you have more space I suppose but it’s not impossible and is actually quite common.

At least with a plane, even if it is 6 hours door to door, (and by the way that’s 1/3 the train time you’ve listed) I’m constantly on the move and don’t feel stuck in a narrow cabin or seat for 18 hours with constantly rolling and bouncing on those Amtrak trains. I can get to (your example) Chicago at a reasonable time of night, check into my nice hotel, get a good dinner, work or go to sleep and wake up my nice hotel room the next morning. 

The work time (4 hours) on a train in your example doesn’t offset the added 12 hours of travel time. 

Planes are hideous polluters but there’s just no alternative that makes sense in many situations. Now for a travel time of less than 5 hours, I would say the train is a great option.

Why do they trust him with that money over Bernie or Biden? It just doesn’t make sense, this is the election to shore up support and tighten the ranks to push out a tyrant. Instead we’re seeing the most petty shit. 

I was mostly leaning towards Warren until recently, she has not handled her slide well and this petty unconvincing attack on Bernie has done it for me. She’s out. Harris tried something similar when she went after Biden as a racist and it just soured her for me too. 

Give me your policies, if all you’re going to do is drag me into your petty feuds then find your way off the damned stage."

worldnews,felh5ng,t1_fel1t04,1579222061.0,"Our cities were, yes, but most of us weren’t living in cities. The suburbs were lazy, peaceful, and brimming with optimism. My childhood was full of playing with my friends in the woods, fields, streams...and we all had dreams of doing big successful “adult” things. 

I’m doing good myself and in a city now but some of my friends kind of got trapped in suburbia. The whole “moms basement” thing is very real and it’s because there aren’t many high paying jobs ie affordable housing options - and they’ve got student loan debt still a few years after graduating. 

They’re not bums, but they are stuck in an awful situation. That’s the tragedy of our generation IMO.

politics,fekx9d6,t1_fektw0o,1579209497.0,"My point exactly, that’s why he broke the law. I’m being downvoted I sense because people think I meant “a president can do what he wants.”

I wrote that presidents have a lot of (and IMO far too much) discretion on these sorts of matters, but what trump did went well beyond what a president can do. It shows his lack of experience and the lack of experience in the staff around him. The protocols and procedures could’ve been followed to totally legitimize this operation and make it much more defensible, instead these guys just pulled off a Sopranos style extortion scheme in broad daylight with records and even release a “transcript” that confirms all of the key elements necessary to convict."
StockMarket,feksgw7,t1_fekp9bu,1579206664.0,"How would you “make sure” companies are valued on profitability though...often times startups are developing something novel, innovative, and without many comparables in the market. You want to value 2 dudes in their garage? $100,000? Turns out those dudes turned into Google so offer a few trillion. 

Investing in startups and tech startups especially is inherently risky because you’re not investing in a direct path to profitability. You’re buying into an idea you think can take off. Many variables can prevent that success including a market that just doesn’t want to bite (even if the product is superior). 

However some companies aren’t that difficult to predict that they’ll fail...I would classify WeWork there. Why can’t I just become a property developer in my city and convert some old buildings into cheap, trendy spaces like WeWork does? Their only advantage is a lot of money to do it on a grander scale but that money seems to be gone."

You then spammed me with related data that doesn’t in any way prove or disprove one position or another and now you won’t shut the fuck up. 

It’s literally not about me, stop targeting me. “LOL” go tell your internet friends you “got me good”. I don’t care at all, my point had been made and that’s all I care to say in this thread. 

Also, if picking a fight with random people makes you feel good, go try kick boxing in a gym."
HistoryPorn,fek397g,t1_fejueab,1579191680.0,"How? How do you have at least that number? The army picks its conscripts based on the same factors - age and health. It prioritizes picking younger men first, older men later. 

So the vast, vast majority of the army would’ve been men under 25 **by design**. People think a draft is like a random lottery but it’s not, there are different levels to it. The young get drafted first, older get drafted as the need arises. This is why Berlin was defended by old men and young boys in 1945, the young fighting age men had already been depleted. 

I’m saying it’s impossible to know exact numbers (and I’m not the one claiming 220k soldiers were over 30), but it’s not impossible to guess the likelihood. We can use the average age, the ages of reported KIA/MIA troops, and common sense that the army relies on young men first. The UK never kicked all of its army into the war because it relied on the navy rather than fielding massive armies. This is why it had only about 100k men in 1939. 

Anyways this conversation isn’t productive and it’s dragging on into your attempt to “get me.” Lame."
HistoryPorn,fejtmcu,t1_fejt34r,1579185555.0,"No, you need to know the median, the standard deviation, or at least the range to know. Soldiers are generally the same age, not a bunch of 10 year olds and 45 year olds to give an average of 25. Its not a standard population, soldiers are uniformly selected by age and generally cluster close together. 

I did say officers were likely over 30, but there was what 1 officer for every 8-10 combat soldiers? 

This again is all just to say it was unlikely for those or any other 4 year olds in 1914 Britain to have seen combat in WW2 but not impossible."
HistoryPorn,fejsjn4,t1_fejs9g9,1579184795.0,"What do you think that link does? I’ve literally said several times I didn’t say it was impossible but rather very unlikely for a 30-32 year old British male to have seen combat in WW2. The comment I replied to originally seemed to suggest every British male for two generations was fucked with war - like all the men fought in WW1 and their younger brothers fought in WW2. 

That’s true for Germany, Russia, but not the UK. 

Now why you and a few other trolls keep attacking me personally I’ll never understand.
