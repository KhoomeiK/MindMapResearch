cats,fc3j46a,t1_fc36lo8,1577390928.0,"I agree! They have had a pretty great Christmas and our older cat, Hobbes, is already starting to play with them and seems to be taking to them really well."
cats,fc3j050,t1_fc35vc4,1577390859.0,"We talked about it and went through the immediate “we’ll never get another because this was too hard” and “Hobbes might not love another cat like he loved Stella”... and then realized that nothing will ever take away her memory, and meanwhile there are sweet cats everywhere that need good homes. I still miss my girl like crazy, but we are head-over-heels for these two. :)"
