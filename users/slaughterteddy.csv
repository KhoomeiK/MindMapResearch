AskReddit,ff5pzl7,t3_errtp4,1579605440.0,I actually got a lot of influence from Sailor Moon. Probably helped that the protagonist was useless as a human being but got super powers anyway.
AskReddit,ff5pecg,t3_erpnqw,1579604618.0,Period blood EVERYWHERE.
Unexpected,fei188b,t1_fehras7,1579128069.0,This is the comment that finally caused the dry sob.
depression,fehz19b,t1_fegmh04,1579126745.0, you too!
depression,fehyzs4,t1_fegj6hy,1579126721.0,"Fair enough! Girls and people in general are also just pretty weird sometimes. I hate that ""can you do this for me"" shit. It's so condescending."
depression,fegic3t,t1_feg131r,1579093674.0,"Currently, I'm lucky enough that my dad lets me live with him while I try college again for a degree I'm NOT bad at (turns out medical is a terrible field for people with social anxiety) and I work part time at a vet, but otherwise? I'm just trying to find something I'm good at to give me that little boost of ""you're not subhuman"".

If I find an easier way, I'll let you know."

depression,fefxvyn,t3_eorkas,1579068872.0,"I don't think the person I was without the pills would have survived past the age of 14.

Things aren't perfect, still, but I'm so much closer to happy than I ever would have been trying on my own. 

It might not work for you, but it might. And as someone who has been very high and very drunk, I can assure you that the happiness you get from those things and the happiness you're finally able to feel on medication are totally different. 

Sad shit will still make you sad, but not everything will anymore."
depression,fefxnbn,t3_eowg05,1579068621.0,"Well, volcanoes have been erupting with an alarming frequency. I guess that's something. 

For real though: totally see where you're coming from. Don't personally experience it anymore since I've lost most need for social interaction (idk if it's a new symptom or what, but I've totally lost all urge to form connections or have emotional attachments to people), but I get that it's boring as shit. 

Escapism was a favourite of mine when the boredom of reality got to be too much. Online roleplay is a bit of a reprieve because you get to live through someone else."
depression,fefx5gf,t3_eopdl6,1579068122.0," I've found that playing a different game can help.  Like, I used to switch from Wildstar (RIP) to WoW and then to some more obscure MMO to break up the habit. 

It also might help to play some single player games to help break the social attachment. EDIT: not suggesting you cut off your friends from the game,  just putting less emphasis on the game itself"
depression,fefwqyu,t3_eoxbvf,1579067725.0,Have you been evaluated for autism? I ask because I was recently diagnosed and this was pretty much my experience in school.
depression,fefvl9j,t3_eox8ix,1579066620.0," It depends on your body chemistry, I'd reckon.

Personally, I know I'd have offed myself years ago without them. There's some things that therapy just doesn't seem to help."
depression,fefv7oz,t3_eowhe3,1579066266.0,"Eighth grade gym class,  when I got sick of being taunted and called the guy out on it. Immediately had my first ever panic attack in front of the whole class. 

(Luckily, that itself wasn't so bad. The guy apologized a day later and no one really messed with me after that.)

I mean, I guess it technically started in seventh grade, but that was the day that someone finally knew that something was wrong."
depression,fefutpd,t3_eosu0q,1579065907.0, One year ahead of you and we're in exactly the same boat. I'm so sorry.
depression,fefujrb,t3_eoplvr,1579065652.0,I wish I could see it this way. I don't want to get any older. I'm 24 and still feel like I haven't matured a day past 17. There's not enough time to be the person I want to be before I get old and feel even more out of place.
DoesAnybodyElse,fefu8m0,t1_fefu1xk,1579065367.0, Cross your fingers and hope gravity is on your side.
DoesAnybodyElse,feftywg,t1_feftu1i,1579065126.0,Let's just hope it's not the special brown one.
DoesAnybodyElse,feftpci,t3_eowo1c,1579064895.0,I wasn't aware there was an option to sit!
bassethounds,fec2auv,t3_enr2he,1578965618.0,"Keep nudging it. My dad said ""no dogs ever again"" after the lab we had when I was a kid,  but his girlfriend has completely changed his mind in less than a year. 

So, I'm liking my soon-to-be stepmom. She's the reason I'm getting a puppy. 

Persistence works wonders."
depression,fec0jz0,t1_fe6jpku,1578964865.0,"I can't stand when people say to find a job you love. Not all of us can be actors or painters.

There's no love. There's only settling."
depression,febzwar,t1_fe6egy6,1578964728.0," This is why that ""if you don't like it, just leave"" bullshit makes no sense. We're trapped and also not allowed to die."
depression,febx7ft,t1_fe5z7ne,1578963774.0," Well, here's one person reading it. For what it's worth."
depression,febtlql,t3_eo1usb,1578962577.0,"This is exactly how I've been feeling the past few years and knowing that I'm not the only one is kind of a relief. 

I've been kind of stuck in arrested development due to it, too, so I feel like a worthless womanchild."
DoesAnybodyElse,febsxsq,t3_eoark5,1578962290.0," Yeah, and this is why I mostly just nap when I'm not working now. Fun for fun's sake is never enough, and it's so exhausting to be unable to enjoy anything."
DoesAnybodyElse,febs9f1,t3_eoaseo,1578962109.0,"I don't think I've developed mentally past the age of seventeen and I am NOT READY TO BE OLD. 

Nothing to do with dying. I just don't want to be too old for things that I still think are fun, or clothes that I still enjoy. There's not enough time to be the person that I like being."
DoesAnybodyElse,febr1dk,t3_enkcmq,1578961723.0,"I was the person that all of the socially awkward types clung to. I mean, I was awkward, too, but that doesn't automatically mean I want to be your buddy. 

It's easier to just not have friends. If you're more than the bare minimum of polite with some people, they'll never leave you alone."
DoesAnybodyElse,febq1ww,t3_enz50l,1578961459.0,"I'm twenty four and still live with my dad because, as it turns out, I'm very bad at everything. 

You still have time. Don't be me."
DoesAnybodyElse,febpq7e,t3_envqqa,1578961331.0,It feels like calling your teacher or doctor by their first name. Fucking WEIRD.
DoesAnybodyElse,febofri,t3_eo7hux,1578961029.0, It's a pretty earthy shit smell. Goes well with morning dew.
DoesAnybodyElse,febnza3,t3_eo7u6q,1578960888.0,UGH yes. Finding out that people could hear your music the whole time is mortifying.
DoesAnybodyElse,febnsj4,t3_enzoei,1578960814.0," Yep. Some people just have aesthetically pleasing appearances. Even just limbs. Like, ""that might be the most visually appealing arm I have ever seen""."
DoesAnybodyElse,febmx1h,t3_eocf5t,1578960572.0,Kind of in the same way that I enjoy the smell of other people's sweat. Not necessarily appealing but weirdly satisfying all the same.
DoesAnybodyElse,febmkoy,t3_eoabxh,1578960443.0,how many innocent undies have you defiled with your carelessness
DoesAnybodyElse,feblz6w,t3_env2aw,1578960191.0,I don't often put my hand down my pants but I definitely put one or both between my legs when I sleep. It just feels so cozy.
DoesAnybodyElse,febl1yo,t3_eo7c3z,1578959954.0,"I know so many people feel this way, but being one person is so frustrating because, unless you're famous enough to get the attention of the masses,  nothing we do seems to help or even matter. 

We get just a pat on the back, if we're lucky. And then one step forward is two steps back a couple of years later.

I want to scream at society as a whole to look where we're headed, but if I did, people would probably just think I was drunk."
AskReddit,fcof5qj,t1_fcngz3p,1577830747.0,"Self awareness with oversharing is a horribly cringe-inducing experience. It usually comes seconds after things leave your mouth.  Ignorance really is bliss. 

And probably would be for the receiving end, too, if they had that luxury."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fc93rcj,t1_fc62l1b,1577546550.0,Same. Painful times.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fc5wbsn,t1_fc5w885,1577467273.0,Thanks! You too!
WhitePeopleTwitter,fc5w3o8,t1_fc5vzi5,1577467136.0,Actually the second part is what I meant. Sorry if I worded that badly.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fc5vj3l,t1_fc5umzr,1577466804.0,"Oh, I didn't mean to imply that introverts are incapable. Just that it's nice to let someone else do the talking, because that shit is exhausting.

Like if there's someone on a long car ride who wants to talk but you'd rather be staring out the window. This makes the extrovert useful. No pressure to engage."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fc5v2wp,t1_fc5ufna,1577466538.0,"But self-deprication makes me feel edgy :,("
WhitePeopleTwitter,fc5tfrp,t1_fc5t1cb,1577465486.0,"Yeah, I was referring to myself."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fc5qtso,t1_fc5qg7h,1577463945.0," Mainly to keep people from complaining about how quiet a social gathering might be. 

Or,  in a more personal instance, when no one in the class is participating in discussion, so the teacher locks eyes with YOU and you end up taking one for the team."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fc5otr3,t3_egb42v,1577462837.0," Introverts need extroverts. If they don't carry the conversation,  who will?"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fc5olin,t1_fc5nj49,1577462715.0,"This is why we need to teach kids to set the bar low from an early age. If you already know you're dumb,  social anxiety is a wonderful reason to keep your mouth shut."
TooAfraidToAsk,fc0jyjk,t3_efeie3,1577292528.0,I want one but my butthole is way too ticklish.
fatpeoplestories,fb31hx1,t3_dyozy6,1576462053.0,"When I went to Disney World,  my family made a game out of counting how many fat people we saw on scooters over three days.  Got a total of 206."
