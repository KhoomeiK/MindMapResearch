Also If 1500 is to lose weight, than their maintence is either 2000 or 2500 which you can steal eat on a cheat day and lose (just don’t do it daily, and don’t go over) that’s not famine or starving oneself.

I find tracking daily and weighing myself and my food helps, also logging the weight into an app.

I use mfp for calories
And I use the life app for weight, waist measurement and fasting.

I do well if I have something that says I can or cannot do something and the life app basically tells me when I have an eating window (not sure how healthy this is but it works for me) I do 16:8 daily but if you don’t want to do if that’s fine too, but their weight graph is the most visually pleasing to me, so I log daily in that. Even if your a pound heavier you can see a trend and adjust based off that.

I don’t really exercise, but if it’s something you enjoy or want to enjoy I recommend it. Or finding a fun sport, I played rugby for a couple years and highly recommend doing exercise you enjoy.

While the body will still see a calorie as a calorie (same as sugar but fruits are healthier than candy because of the fiber) certain foods will keep you fuller longer, this wanting less calories from other foods.

The logic is *almost* there... almost"

For a class im indifferent as my skill set is so low, it might not be an issue (for me) or others like me."
fatlogic,fegv2dc,t1_fefmzpi,1579103183.0,"Your comment reminded me of good donuts and made me tempted to drive to portland again for donuts 🤣🤣

I am not a big fan of cheap donuts at all but those niche places that make them in store and once theyre gone they close for the day? So good xD"
fatlogic,fegt1b3,t1_fefvm7y,1579101871.0,"See I think that’s amazing, it could also help anxiety with gym goers too who don’t feel super comfortable yet, having someone who isn’t “fitness model” running the show, 

I don’t hate the idea of overweight trainers but their skill set is different and can not replace the need for fitter trainers."
DIY_eJuice,fegsl6m,t1_fegkk98,1579101569.0,"Yeah. With recipes I’ve made, I have made some that sounded good on paper, but it’s been five months and I still haven’t used it again (a cherry one) it’s just not good. 

I just randomly mixed (2/3 ish blueberry mixed oneshot 1/3 ish bubblegum oneshot and a dash of koolada) and it’s sooo good."
fatlogic,fefm96j,t3_eowqyt,1579059365.0,Yeahhhh I can bet most professionals don’t need to know their weight to know they should lose some
progresspics,fefe4b3,t3_eov122,1579054372.0,"Do you intermittent fasting? If not that might work? Instead of a vacation meal 3 times a day, do it twice?

How long are you going? If it’s only a few days, I say eat a little below what you are doing now incase you indulge while on it, or even just pick healthier options and let yourself have fun, and if fun means a couple extra drinks or a plate of nachos, it probably won’t harm you much if you get back on track right away when your home :)

Have fun on your mini vacay op :)"

fatlogic,fefa8ks,t1_fef3n93,1579051840.0,"I wouldn’t mind a slower Zumba instructor for me as a newb, ngl. But for anyone who can keep up or better, probably beat left to those who are fitter. 

But beginner classes might see a benefit?"

Edit: trees aren’t a tool for weight loss... or maybe they are?"
