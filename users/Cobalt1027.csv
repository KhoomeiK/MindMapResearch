todayilearned,ffcycxk,t1_ffcorwp,1579809811.0,"I've always found Middle English super fascinating. On the one hand it's almost completely illegible, but on the other it makes nearly perfect sense as long as you take the time to try and speak it. I tried to speak the passage above to myself and it came out something like this:

""And it was done afterward, and Jesus made journey by cities and castles, preaching and ~~exchanging~~ evangelizing the realm of God, and twelve with him; and some women that were healed of wicked spirits and sicknesses, Marie, that is cleric Madeline, of whom seven devils went out, and Joan, the wife of Chuse, protector of Eroude, and Susanne, and many others, which ~~many stridden~~ administered to him of her riches.""

Just changing the old words to look like modern English helps out a ton. It's clearly dated, and I made a few mistakes (""cleric Madeline"" != Magdalene, ""many stridden"" makes no sense), but it's still completely recognizable."

PlayTemtem,ff9x0v8,t3_esfjph,1579723351.0,"The combat system so far has been truly a pleasure to work with. Every fight is a 2v2 or 2v1, but as the game was designed that way it feels much more polished than in Pokemon where the 2v2 aspect was simply duct-taped on.

Examples of using 2v2 to its full potential:

- Moves can have ""synergy"" with Temtem of certain types. For example, the Mental starter gets a move that has 45 power at around lvl 15ish. This is fine considering that it can be used every turn and costs very little stamina. However, if you have a Nature Temtem on your side of the field, it suddenly becomes a 60 power move that doubles your opponent's stamina cost for two turns.

- Moves that interact with the 2v2 aspect are much more common. For example, one of the more common moves the NPCs use is called Bamboozle. It functions essentially like Protect, but it only works on your ally.

- Positioning matters. Chain Lightning is an Electric move that hits three targets for decreasing damage sequentially in a Clockwise direction. I'm sure there's other examples, but I'm not too far in the game yet.

In addition to 2v2 being used completely, just the way that the battle system was redesigned is very satisfying.

- Every move has 100% accuracy and there's no way to increase evasion and/or lower accuracy that I can see. There's also no damage range, so there's no wondering if your Temtem at 21/40 can survive the next hit. Next hit from the same move will always be 19 damage, not 18-22.

- Status effects aren't random. Sleep lasts two turns unless interrupted by damage, Poison lasts [X] turns depending on the move (commonly 3-4), there's no equivalent of Paralysis or Confusion. Abilities similar to Static and/or Poison Point have been reworked to proc on death as a sort of revenge mechanic.

- The Stamina system is just amazing (it's basically a mana bar). Spamming the equivalent of Fire Blast isn't possible because, in Temtem, it would cost too much Stamina. If your Temtem would use a move that uses too much Stamina, it ""overexerts"" itself and damages itself while also skipping its next turn. High-stamina moves also tend to have 2-3 turn cooldowns, meaning you are rewarded for keeping Temtem in longer (moves start on cooldown when switched in). This makes the equivalent of having Ember and Flamethrower on the same Temtem viable and/or encouraged.

- Re-learning old moves is as simple as swapping them out in a menu. As such, movesets are flexible and strategies can be updated on-the-fly.

As for specifically answering your question on difficulty:

- 2v2 is used to its full extent. Wild battles can be 2v2 and this wears down your team a bunch between trainer battles.

- Routes are basically perfect in their length. There tends to be a mini heal-station in the halfway point of routes and it's always a welcome sight. By these points I've usually already used my full-team-heal (you get one that refills at heal-stations like an Estus Flask, it's super neat).

- Trainer battles require actual thought/strategy to get through. Opponent's teams tend to consist of 4-5 relatively varied Temtem, making it difficult or impossible to get through with  a single sweeper of the correct type. This is accented by the Stamina system, ensuring that a single Temtem cannot win a fight by itself. For reference, I'd consider myself quite decent at Pokemon - I've competed on Showdown, I've bred perfect IV/EV teams for VGC, I've finished plenty of challenge runs. By the end of a fight I tend to have 2-3 Temtem out of commission or in red bar.

- Certain fights along the way are clearly placed as a sort of check to make sure your team is functional. For example, relatively early on (team at around lvls 10-11), you'll go up against a guy who talks a lot about type matchups. Fight starts and he has a single lvl 18 Temtem that quite simply isn't beatable unless you can abuse his typings in a 2v1 properly.

- I've only had a single boss fight so far (the one before the first gym) and I party wiped. I won on the rematch, but this isn't the sort of thing that happens in Pokemon. Hell, I tend to be able to go through an entire playthrough without my starter getting knocked out. 

So yeah, game is difficult but in a very satisfying way. The lack of Temtem variety is already kinda obvious (I swear every opposing team has two of the annoying masked bird thing), but the systems in place are clearly of much higher potential than those in Pokemon."

slaythespire,feq6o05,t1_fepxvdl,1579338281.0,"The extra card draw makes it statistically worth it until a relatively low average mana cost. The odds of seven (not one) bad coin-flips is much lower than you just not drawing what you need when you need it if you're drawing only five cards a turn.

Edit: For clarity's sake, take the card [[Dark Shackles]]. It costs 0 energy so it must be bad with Snecko right? You'd think so, but it turns out that in fights where you want the Shackles it doesn't really matter how much it costs. Who cares about paying 3 mana for it when the Heart is attacking for 5x15? The extra two cards per turn makes you much more likely to draw the Shackles on the turn you need them."

Getting my mom to navigate *menus* with a controller is an exercise in frustration because controllers are so foreign to anyone who didn't grow up with one. Basically the only game she's ever played is the original Pong. She tries her best, but how am I supposed to get her to jump from that to a platformer or RPG or fighting game? Anyone who thinks this shit isn't difficult needs a reality check. 

Luckily with VR controls are *much* more intuitive than they've ever been. It gives her nausea, but something like Beat Saber is very easy to understand and pick up even if you've never played a game before. There's a reason the Wii is so popular in retirement homes - there's no disconnect, you just point at the TV to navigate menus and the simple motions of something like Wii Sports is again extremely intuitive."
slaythespire,felskpx,t3_epsox0,1579229892.0,"Try not to think too much in terms like ""discard build."" You're making a Silent deck, take any card that helps fix problems.

In cases that I do end up going for more discard-based symergies, it's for one of a few reasons.

- Relics: If I pick up one or both of Tingsha or Bandages, I'm much more inclined to pick up cards like Prepared or Calculated Gamble. Unceasing Top specifically is a great signal to go all-in on cards like Concentrate, letting me churn out stupid amounts of cards in a singal turn.

- Transformed Cards: Open a Pandora's Box and get a few discardable cards? Suddenly a card like Acrobatics goes up in value.

- Card Spam: Discard synergy cards tend to have very low energy costs or even gain you energy, so if I have a Thousand Cuts or an After Image already I'll be more inclined to take things like Prepared.

- Card Selection: Discard synergy cards are insanely good at churning through a deck very quickly. Grand Finale is amazing in discard-based decks because the variable draws (1 for Prep, 2 for Prep+, 3 for Acrobatics, 4 for Acro+) make it easy to draw just as much as you need while churning through a deck potentially multiple times in a singal turn.

So, I guess a specific answer to your question would be that I start picking up discard cards once a critical threshold has been reached. 

""Oh, I have Thousand Cuts, let's take an After Image""

""I have TC and AI, let's take Prepared.""

""TC is important to my deck's gameplan, Acrobatics is good because I need to draw it asap.""

""Hey look, about a quarter of the cards in my deck can discard. Let's take a Tactician because I feel kinda energy-starved.""

Etc etc. Discard is very much a self-reinforcing loop, but you can't force it, just like with most deck archetypes. The difference between discwrd and something like poison is that most of the synergy doesn't mention discarding cards (I think Thousand Cuts, After Image, and Grand Finale are the best non-relic payoffs), so it can be difficult to tell when the mediocre cards are suddenly synergistic enough to take."

slaythespire,fejz7kx,t3_epfzgg,1579189184.0,"I got my ""first win"" after only a few tries, but I attribute that to having watched a streamer first and the limited cardpool before you unlock stuff (it's harder to make bad decisions when you have less of them to make). I definitely remember hitting a wall for quite a while though on the Ascension that makes normal enemies harder (2?3?). I just yesterday beat a15 for the first time, with all my non-Silent characters ready to take their shot at it :D

My best piece of advice is gonna stem from this.

> So, 40 hours of mainly Silent (poison decks) and Defect (powerspam) runs, no victory.

You are focusing way, way to much on scaling damage and archetypes. As I mentioned yesterday to someone else, you aren't trying to make a Poison deck, or a Shiv deck, or a Strength deck, or a Block deck, or a Power deck, or an All-for-One deck. You're making a Silent deck, or an Ironclad deck, or a Defect deck. Use *all* of the tools available to you.

Silent: You keep trying to make Poison decks work. I'm assuming that this means you're mostly taking every Poison card offered to you. Stop that right now lol. Poison is amazing, but the drawback is that it takes a few turns to get somewhere. Ever notice that the Birds, Thieves, and Cultists seem to just roll over you? Even if you do win, it feels like you took a ton of damage? Poison is *slow*. Cards like Backstab and Glass Knife can massively increase your damage output at the beginning of a fight, letting your Poison get the second half if necessary.

Now, apply that thinking to the other classes. Pure strength scaling is slow. Pure Blockade spam into a massive Bodyslam is slow. Pure Power spam is slow. Having these elements *in* your deck is fine, having them *be* your deck is not :P"
slaythespire,fejoxsb,t1_fej8laq,1579182029.0,Thank you!
slaythespire,fejolo8,t1_fejk7we,1579181746.0,Thanks! :D
slaythespire,fej5k9c,t1_fej45v0,1579157773.0,"That's a great question, and it took a while for me to figure out (in case you think it's relevant, I just beat a15 for the first time with Silent today!). 

The first part is recognizing what type of damage you need and when you need it. In my aforementioned run, my first boss was Hexaghost. It just so happens that Caltrops and Bronze Scales do fantastically against that boss, so I snap-took one when I had a chance (first store had the Scales). 

Aside from silver bullets that can make hard fights simple, it pays to keep in mind both scaling and front-loaded damage. If you think that your scaling damage is too slow because hallway fights take forever, the real reason might actually be that your front-loaded damage is low or non-existent. Backstab is a fantastic one-of because it makes hallway fights relatively trivial despite making little to no impact in Elite/Boss fights. If you ever find yourself relying too much on Noxious Fumes and always wondering why the Birds, Theives, and Cultists are running over you, this is why.

As for specifics of how Silent can win without Poison, the honest answer is that she mostly can't. *However*, she definitely needs a lot less than you think she does. A single Fumes is enough to win any boss fight, a single Corpse Explosion makes most hallway fights trivial, even something like a Poison Stab and a Bane can be enough in a lot of situations (first two cards I picked up in my run this morning).

I think the best way to summarize what I said above is to keep in mind that you are *not* trying to make a Poison deck, or a Shiv deck. You're trying to make a *Silent* deck. Use all her tools. It might not be flashy or make much sense to have Thousand Cuts and Catalyst in the same deck, but if TC is your only AoE and Catalyst is your Boss/Elite scaling then you absolutely made the right call.

Lastly, don't be afraid to pivot into what the game gives you. My winning run today Pandoras Box'd after Hexaghost into a weird discard/cycle deck that won by playing Grand Finale against Awakened One three times in the same turn! Certainly nothing I'd ever done before, but it was insanely cool to do once I realized what it had given me (among other cards, PB gave me - Grand Finale, two Escape Plans, an Acrobats, a Calculated Gamble, a Well Laid Plans, and two Preperations).

If you want clarification anywhere, or you have other questions, feel free to ask :)"
slaythespire,feiyl7p,t1_feiy3r6,1579150859.0,"Yep, there's your problem lol. It's amazing how much damage you can output in a turn when you realize how inconsequential tickling is :)"
slaythespire,feiw4up,t1_feiu2dk,1579148829.0,"Watch some Jorbs if you haven't, both cards are completely insane. Instead of reading Wraith Form as ""I lose in three turns,"" read it as ""*I can't take damage for three turns.*"" Slightly hyperbolic against multi-hits, but the point is that the card lets you spend all of your energy towards offence. If you can't win in three turns spending all of your energy on offence, you need to take a serious look at your scaling and attempt to rectify it.

Piercing Wail is similarly a bonkers defensive card. By itself, it nullifies multihit fights completely (Book of Stabbing, Guardian, the Heart). Consider that it hits all enemies and it becomes amazing (Slavers, Slimes, Gremlin Leader + Minions). Add in the fact that you'll never draw it again (fights don't last long enough to get more value, so not diluting future draws is great) and you have an all-star card."
