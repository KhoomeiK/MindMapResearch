trashy,feixxj6,t1_feiwspd,1579150297.0,"I could read it both ways so I just figured I’d just clarify in case you thought it was me. No worries. Reading text comments from a stranger on the internet is always full of context problems. 

I just find it funny because when people ask me how I could watch her show, my go to explanation are shows like Family Guy and stand up comedians. It’s usually a light funny show not meant to be taken seriously, but sometimes I find a joke offensive. I keep watching because that’s the price of comedy - at some point a joke will user you, but if you enjoy the rest of set. Sometimes Bill Burr makes a joke that hurts me, but I’m still going to watch his standup because the rest of his set is going to have me crying tears from laughter. She calls her own show stupid and messy and it truly is, but that’s what makes it funny.

I also find it strange that people are really jumping on this hate train for her now when she’s actually gotten A LOT nicer since separating from her allegedly abusive husband. She’s for sure said some shit that isn’t cool, especially since she’s been on since like the early 90’s - humor has changed A LOT since then (for the better I think), but i just find the timing of all this very strange. Even stranger since this is a clip of her talking about how attractive she find Joaquin Phoenix. It’s an interesting development to watch."
trashy,feivwba,t1_feivc3j,1579148646.0,"I didn’t downvote you.  You said you didn’t know her or her show, and for some reason people on here seem to think her show is a lot more serious than it is, so I thought that information may be of use to you when forming your opinion (Not sure if you think I’m the one who did or if your just saying it to whoever it was out there)."
trashy,feiucxh,t1_fehvzme,1579147448.0,"Her job actually is exactly what you described as Seth McFarlane. She has a show where she talks about pop culture and makes fun of everyone. That’s it. That’s the show. It isn’t like Maury or The View or Good Morning America, it’s just her laughing through hot topics and giving her opinion of them.

On top of all that she wasn’t making fun of him, she was saying how talented and handsome she finds him and that she thinks his scar from having a cleft lip makes him more attractive. That’s it. She likes him, his work, and thinks his scar looks good."
trashy,feityeh,t1_fehugo0,1579147139.0,"They are, Joaquin is the one talking in the 911 phone call when he overdosed. Which makes the family guy comment even more cutting imo."
trashy,feitu42,t1_fei876l,1579147052.0,"That isn’t what her show is though, she routinely calls her own show messy, says she has mannish ways and says she has a body shaped like a capital P. It’s mostly her talking about different hot topics and then giving her opinion about it, and it isn’t meant to be a serious show. I listen to it while I work specifically because it’s just a silly show that’s supposed to make you laugh. 

Sometimes she misses the mark and *is* mean, but this time she was actually saying she likes him, thinks he’s incredibly talented and handsome and that she finds his scar very attractive. I think she had also done some stand up work in the past, it’s meant to be a funny show, not like Good Morning America or The View."
trashy,feitf1x,t1_fei3iyf,1579146736.0,"She was actually complimenting him. She goes on about what talented and handsome man she thinks he is. She says something like “I even like the scar, he had cleft lip, like this [that’s when she imitates it, making it seem like she’s doing it incase someone watching doesn’t know what that is]you know? But I like it! I think it looks good!”  She’s saying he is both handsome and talented, and that she thinks his scar is attractive. Where as family guy called him the hair lipped discount version of his deceased brother. Which one of those two comments do you actually think is the more hurtful mean spirited one?"
trashy,feiso7l,t1_fei0nu1,1579146195.0,I honestly think she’s gotten a lot nicer lately. Maybe being in an allegedly abusive (at the very least controlling and toxic) relationship made her miserable and that’s why she was so mean previously. But it seems like since she separated from her husband she’s become a bit kinder. But she’s never been an especially tactful person.
trashy,feif0dj,t1_fei2ypc,1579136984.0,"Yeah, that’s how i interpreted it too. She was saying he’s handsome. I think if she hadn’t imitated it it would have been fine. I don’t think she meant to be hurtful this time, she just isn’t someone who has a lot of grace or tact."

wholesomememes,fei08hj,t3_ep5xpx,1579127470.0,"Back when the History Channel used to actually do history documentaries, they always had this one professor on the ones about Ancient Rome. He had kind of goofy southern accent and seemed a little nerdy, but he always seemed so excited to talk about the subject, really passionate about it always made me happy whenever they’d play his voice before showing him talking because I’d already know, “that’s my dude!” I wish I could remember his name, I’d listen to him talk about Rome forever."
trashy,fehz56d,t1_fehspc1,1579126812.0,"If it makes you feel any better. I don’t really see a scar like think “oh hey! That guy had a cleft pallet!” It’s just, “oh, that guy has a face scar. Wonder what happened.” And that’s it. Even if it does register with me that it could have be from a cleft pallet, that’s not something that would make me (or I think any other reasonable person) less of that guy. He just had a cleft pallet, it happens, it causes a scar, whatever. Honestly it kinda looks badass if anything. 

There’s always going to be assholes that try to make others feel as down as they are. Fuck those people, they just want you to feel as miserable about yourself as they do about themselves."

I got hit by a van while using a crosswalk and it was a hit and run complete with him laughing at me for being upset that he shoved me onto airport way in front of a semi (while walking my friend’s dog no less). A witness in a car pulled over, I got a picture of his car that included the make, model, and his license plate before he was able to drive off. Took the police 15 minutes to show up (where they told me the dispatcher had told them it was a car hit and run on another car, not a pedestrian). The police officer gave me his cell instead of an actual number, then whenever I tried to contact him about the incident, it felt like he was trying to flirt with me and I gave up. I never found out if they caught the guy. Never got an update on a court date. And that was in the beginning of 2018. So as far as I know, that dude is still out on the road.

witcher,fdc401d,t1_fdbsciq,1578266661.0,"Nah, it’s just kind of alarming. I’m sure the girl is crazy hot, and probably very kind and maybe even a little mature for her age BUT there is something weird about a guy in his 30’s dating a girl half his age because mentally, he should be so much more developed than her. On top of that his life arena shouldn’t be in the same spot as hers, and those are two big factors for making a relationship successful. When I was 25 I dated a 35 year old and looking back it wasn’t a good choice, that’s not to say he was a super skeezy guy, but now that I’m 30, I definitely get why women his age wouldn’t have dated him.

Having a decade of experience is pretty significant if the other partner has had hardly any. Things that are going to be nbd to a 33 year old guy are going to be huge monumental milestones to an inexperienced 18/19 year old. Shit like that can lead to a lot of problems and she’ll be the one that has to do the coping. 

Henry Cavill seems like a decent guy, and if this is the only red flag about him, then fine.  I’m sure if we were all famous and had our personal lives exposed to the world all of us would probably have some sort of red flag about us. But I do think it’s something to kind of quietly watch."

Dogs that have never seen the sun before, that don’t know how to play because they’ve been trapped in a cage their entire life, who have had their teeth pulled to keep them from neurotically chewing at themselves, I’ve had to remove matted coats to expose infected, weeping sores. It’s just hard to look at a group that engages in that sort of thing the same after, even if they’re occasionally kind to people. And honestly, I NEED to people to know what this group is doing because it hurts too much to think despite the ones I’ve helped, the system they came from is still allowed to flourish and financially benefit.

We’re waiting to get married for about a year or so as he really needs to focus on getting his career established, but I can’t wait to take his name and have kids together. I hope they take after him.
