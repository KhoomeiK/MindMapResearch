We used the ""No pants"" method for both of our kids, our daughter was potty trained in 3.5 days, our son we were about to quit at 6 days (I'd have quit 3 days prior because it didn't feel like he was getting it, but my wife stuck to it) and he finally got it. With both of them it felt like once they had it it just kind of clicked. No pants method is you basically let them be naked down under and just correct them when they pee/poo and clean it up. It's a little intense but it works."
