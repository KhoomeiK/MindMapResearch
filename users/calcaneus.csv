FTMMen,fezj7da,t3_eqxge7,1579457905.0,"No.  I’ve never watched any detransition videos, and I’ve read all of one thread (on r/FTM) by a person who decided to detransition (and subsequently retransition, and then detransition again).  I once very briefly questioned myself - this was very early in transition, not long after I started T.  I was nowhere near passing and hadn’t even socially changed my name.  I met a guy at work to whom I was very strongly attracted.  Super nice and cool guy, and hit buttons I didn’t know I had on the physical attractiveness scale.  And all I could think was, is he gay?  Would I have a better shot at this if I were female?  Was it worth going back to that for a guy?  And what the HELL would he make of me if I came out to him, especially at that stage?  You have an apparent GF now, but eventually you’ll have a BF?  (All extraordinarily presumptuous of me, obviously, but the mind goes where it will go.)  And I realized that was a leap back into where I’d been all my life, with relationships where a guy though he was dating a girl and I basically had to do some mental gymnastics.  (End of the story:  I transferred to another location, got him out of my sight.  But I quite honestly still think of him occasionally.)

I can’t imagine going back there, not having come so far along in being who I always thought I was, having the outside match the inside to the degree practicable (still in progress, but at least it IS in progress).  

So I don’t know how you get that far and change your mind.  I don’t even know if I will get that far - phallo is an almost inconceivable amount of down time at this point in my life - but I can’t imagine going back.   Maybe transition has been easy-ish for me because the only real question ever for me was my sexuality (how could I be trans AND gay?  The two seemed completely contradictory).  Once that was out of the picture, there was no issue at all; there never really was a question.  Everyone has their own path to transition and I suppose if you have doubts along the way, they can resurface later."

But if you have enough money to eat yourself into obesity, you have enough money to NOT do so.  The very simplest things to do are to not drink things with high calorie content (stick with water, coffee, tea, diet drinks) and to eat less food than you are currently eating (smaller portion sizes).  Neither of these things will cost you more than you are currently spending, and should in fact cost less.  

If you don’t know how to cook, now would be a good time to learn.  You don’t have to cook anything fancy, but having a few simple skills will give you a lot more control over your meals (and thus your calorie intake).  There is a lot of information on the internet about eating on a budget; spend a bit of time going through it.  Don’t be afraid of making a few mistakes in the kitchen; everybody does and it’s part of the learning process.

Another option would be to try a compression tank top, basically a binder without added material around the chest area.  

I have tried and was not really a fan of KT tape.  For starters I am on T and had to shave my chest, which was both hilarious and dysphoric.  Also, there was no way I could leave it on for days at a time so I was retaping daily.  That got old (and expensive) fast.

FTMMen,fd6pag8,t1_fd6nhni,1578194077.0,"You need to get what is called a Status Information Letter.  This is free from Selective Service.  Click [here](https://www.sss.gov/Registration/Status-Information-Letter) for the Selective Service site. Near the top right, you’ll see a button for a SIL request form.  It’s very simple to fill out; you will find your exemption (born female, have or will be transitioning to male).  They require a copy of your original birth certificate plus a copy of any court documentation of your name change, if you’ve done that.  I also sent in a copy of my current driver’s license.  They say they’ll respond within 30 days, and I got my letter back in about two weeks."

I am also too old for service so I’ve never looked in to this seriously, but I did have to get an exception letter to explain why I had not registered for selective service."
FTMMen,fd3tj1x,t3_ejo142,1578161508.0,"I think you’ve gotten a bit ahead of yourself.  First of all, background on me:  I definitely had body dysphoria to a far greater extent than I ever had genital dysphoria.  I never wanted to look like a woman.  I literally grew up during Arnold’s heyday as a bodybuilder and that is what I wanted to look like when I grew up.  Silly genes had other ideas.  

Pre-T, I dealt with this a lot by not thinking about it, as there wasn’t much I could do about it beyond maintaining a relatively low body fat % and lifting as heavy as possible.  That still just made me look like a lean female instead of a man.  Once on T, I was able to start making substantial changes in the gym.  For a long stretch, every trip held a PR.  That noobie gainz thing is an experience worth having.  As for the weight gain, you have to accept that it will happen and that it’s a good thing: muscle will help reshape you.  Note that you WILL gain muscle even if you don’t lift.  You don’t have to carb load; in fact that is really not a thing for anybody except perhaps distance athletes (and not all of them - I was one for a long time, never did buy into it).  

Just - relax.  Find a gym with some basic barbell equipment.  Find a novice linear progression program you can live with.  Consistently show up at the gym.  If you are a bit underweight, eat enough that you are gaining a few pounds a month for the first several months (depending on your training history, you should get through a good novice program in 3 - 5 months).  In the meantime, if you you are serious about reshaping your body, keep reading on the subject, with a bias toward people with actual credentials beyond “instagram influencer.”  If you have a body shape in mind, look to how people with that look train.  I personally have gotten away from the whole physique athlete thing; I like lifting heavy things for the sake of doing so and the shape is basically right so I’m in a good place.  You will find yours; just give it time.  Persistence pays off."
FTMMen,fd3jfa9,t3_ejm3qh,1578158911.0,"I wasn’t sure how to take this post, so I read a bit of your history.  Dude, who pissed in your cornflakes?  I have never seen this kind of thing from MTF people.  This is not to say it doesn’t happen, but I don’t consider engaging in or being angry about things like this to be very helpful TO ME, especially if just encountering it online as opposed to IRL.  I’m supportive of all trans people in general, but if someone is an asshole, someone is an asshole and you just have to call them as such and decide if it’s worth it to let an asshole become a time suck for you.  To me, that’s an easy call.  Walk away."

fatlogic,fd35wp4,t3_ejkive,1578155046.0,"Keto: Fine if you like low carb diets; but sub optimal to very poor choice (as are all low carb diets) if you exercise with performance in mind/train for a sport.

Whole 30:  Not even sure what this means, but if it gets you to eat very simply for a month (i.e., all foods with one ingredient), might be a good way to broaden your dietary and culinary horizons.  

IF:  Fine if it suits you and you remember

CICO: is always the bottom line.  Counting calories in as accurately as you can and regularly stepping on the scale will give you two pieces of actual data that you can use when you are serious about managing your weight in any direction.   But y’all knew that.  I don’t call it a diet, I call it reality."

fatlogic,fcxmv7n,t3_ej6o9x,1578066728.0,"That is not how informed consent works.  Informed consent has to do with informing a patient of the risks and benefits of a course of treatment, although I can see it also pertaining to invasive testing.  Weighing a person is not invasive.  The only “harm” done is the person potentially gets told something they don’t want to hear.  Both doctor and patient in this case already know the patient is fat, so stop acting like a fucking four year old.  Trends in your weight - unexpected loss or gain - can be medically significant."

Can’t even say I went out and partied last night (I didn’t), although I did get up early today to meet a group of old friends for brunch, which is a New Year’s tradition for us.  We are all current or former training partners, and it’s a good group.

It’s a fine choice if it fits your life and preferences, and you remember the bottom line remains CICO."
