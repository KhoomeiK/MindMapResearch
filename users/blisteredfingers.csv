> *Does This Mean We Should Stop Using Password Managers?*

>No, not at all. The recent hacks and security vulnerabilities found in these services underscore one important aspect in security: no piece of software is able to truly offer more than 99% security. Reaching 100% security is impossible with any kind of software because every piece of code will have an Achilles heel somewhere that makes it vulnerable.

It's easy to just say whatever you want to obfuscate. Isn't the whole point of cybersecurity to best mitigate risks? Like, we're aware that risks are a thing, and so we're interested (or actually working) in finding and eliminating them? No one here is saying there aren't risks; that's a fucking bonkers claim."

It's about those at the top who have multiple properties and vehicles for the convenience of having them. Things like private jets, yachts, multiple cars. 

The jets for example:

[Here's a photo](https://imgur.com/a/GA9JA7o) (rehosted on Imgur in case site goes down, [source](https://www.flickr.com/photos/45000502@N04/24834527412/in/photostream/)) of private jets parked at an airport in Oakland for Super Bowl 50. 

[This isn't unusual for a Super Bowl event.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/douggollan/2019/02/03/these-three-private-jet-companies-are-looking-for-wins-on-and-off-the-field-during-super-bowl-liii/#1d333a54c195)

In the photo I linked, I counted around 27 different jets of varying sizes. The Cessna [Citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_Citation_family) family of aircraft are one of the more popular variants, and seat anywhere from 9-12 people. 

Let's assume a scenario where a mix of 14 Citation CJ3's (up to 9 passengers), and 13 CItation X's (up to 12 passengers) That's a combined capacity of 282 people, who could comfortably fit on one  [Boeing 777-300ER](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Cathay_Pacific_Boeing_777-300%3B_B-HNH%40HKG%3B31.07.2011_614tz_%286053499684%29.jpg)([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_777#Specifications)) passenger aircraft (with 365 seats available).

 A [Cessna CitationJet CJ3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Cessna_525B_Citation_CJ3_AN1699978.jpg), with a maximum range of 2,040 nautical miles (nmi), burns through around 116 gallons (793.4 lbs) of fuel per hour. The mid-size [Citation X](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/N975QS_2002_Cessna_750_C-N_750-0175_Citation_X_%287039507775%29.jpg) with a max range of 3,460 nmi, burns around 336 gallons per hour ([source](https://www.sherpareport.com/aircraft/fuel-burn-private-aircraft.html)). A [Boeing 777-300ER](https://web.archive.org/web/20140104144441/http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/commercial/startup/pdf/777_perf.pdf) travelling a distance of 3,000 nmi burns around 2,573 gallons (~17,600 lbs) of fuel per hour.

Jet fuel weighs roughly [6.84 lbs per gallon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_fuel#Jet_A) and creates [21.1 lbs of carbon dioxide per gallon burned.](https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.php) 

A CitationJet CJ3 will create 2,447.6 lbs of CO2 for one hour of flight. 

A Citation X will create 7089.6 lbs of CO2 for one hour of flight.

A Boeing 777-300ER will create 54,290lbs for one hour during a flight that covers a maximum of 3,000 nmi.

Assuming 14 CJ3's and 13 Citation X's, the amount of carbon dioxide created in one hour of flight time totals 126,415 lbs. 

Had the passengers that chartered those aircraft instead pooled their money and rented one Boeing 777-300ER for their trip to Oakland, they would have avoided creating an extra 72,125 lbs of carbon dioxide. 

However, this means travelling among the poors, so I guess there's just no other way forward.

I realize this might be difficult to comprehend, since your idea of a good time is lazily automating slurs and stirring shit. What’s a touch more difficult. is giving a liquid shit about people that aren’t you, and how their lives are both similar, yet wildly different to yours. It takes less effort than writing a bot to spam the shit you couldn’t be bothered to type yourself.

I imagine it’s gonna take a mild to wild amount of restraint to avoid looking up a new slur to reply with, a bar so low that you can use it to clip out of the Thalmor Embassy.

Literally anyone can spew dirty words to get a rise out of people. You probably can’t do better, though."

Beats dropping hard R's and other edgy shit for funsies."
