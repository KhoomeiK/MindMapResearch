bipolar,ff096q3,t1_ff07kg5,1579466557.0,I am on vraylar and saphris. Oh got the CICO. I don’t have energy for the gym but I usually hike 1-2 times a week. I also have PCOS. I have metformin but it makes me too nauseous. I might take 500mg at night. I want to weigh 130lbs. My problem is I need something sweet In the am. That’s usually really sweet so the donut turns to fat. I should lift weights. So IF would be fought because it would be 6am to 3pm. Really need To hit the gym.

bipolar,femwb2v,t1_fem4vvb,1579271296.0,I got off of lithium and abilify because of it. Right now I’m maintaining so I’m not totally unhappy and vraylar is really helping my mood. Maybe I’m just getting older and I have to work harder. Also maybe make a drastic change like cut out sugar.
bipolar,fek42t7,t1_fek1b0t,1579192173.0,"Awesome
Thanks so much!"

bipolar,fejv4pp,t1_fejulvw,1579186560.0,I didn’t want to ask for zofran because I didn’t want to add yet another med. I might ask though.
bipolar,fejut7f,t1_fejulvw,1579186349.0,Amazing! Wow I asked my pdoc if I could smoke pot and she said a hard no.  The only problem is I would have to start my fasting early in the am because when I wake up I am ravenous. I get to hungry in the Am.
bipolar,fejup93,t1_fejtnpe,1579186276.0,Thank you. I tried intermittent fasting and it worked for a bit. Might go back to it. I got my thyroid checked last year and all was normal.

What about the people taking them? If you offered me an opioid it would be a hard no for me. At some point we have to take responsibility.

bipolar,fegisnc,t1_fegio1m,1579094070.0,Do you have a good psychiatrist? I feel like I’ve tried them all but I kept changing combos this past year after my meds stopped working for me after 3 years. Suicidal once again. Luckily I had my wife by my side. I kept trying different combos. I didn’t stop until I found the right combo. Thoughts with you. It’s really rough without the right meds.
bipolar,fegil2m,t1_fegi65f,1579093891.0,"Wow, really?  Off meds I was terrible. Irritable, depressed, anxious, suicidal. I barely made it through life.

theLword,fegi9x9,t1_feghxd0,1579093623.0,Not a joke. Ever think of the doctors prescribing them? My sister was a pharma rep. They’re highly regulated. Of course the opioid problem has to be helped as well as mental health but I don’t blame big pharma as well as the conspiracy theories that there are cures that the FDA doesn’t know about.

bipolar,fe9eqz5,t1_fe9atx9,1578936963.0,This first year of marriage I went through 8 med changes.  Finally found a combo that works. You can make it through anything. We went to couples therapy because we needed to work on communication. It helped a lot. I was depressed and tired all the time and she didn’t know when to push me. Our psychologist suggested saying “I’m at 20% today” which would let my wife know I can’t do a lot. It helps a lot. Communication is key.
