I don't know if you believe in God but I believe God put all of us on earth for a reason, including you. I really hope that you feel better, my best wishes go to you....and to all the people that hurt you, they should fuck off and think about their life. Don't let people like that bring you down. You are strong and amazing and they are full of shit. You can do this. Please don't end your life, you are valued and important. I may not know you but that doesn't mean I shouldn't care about you because let me tell you, I absolutely care about you and everyone else on this server. I hope you get better :)"

lonely,fenacnr,t1_fektet7,1579280415.0,"Yeah. When I come across romantic topics at school that we have to learn about, like in my English class we need to learn about Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, I get upset so easily and at the verge of tears because I am still scared on the inside. It hurts mentally and physically because sometimes I even get sick."

depression,fdrngi2,t3_emnl5m,1578686971.0,"I really hope you feel better. I feel bad you are going through this. I am going through the same thing but with my parents. They really just do not want to deal with me because my mental issues, saying that I am giving them stress and that it is my fault for putting them through my depression. This makes me not want to talk to them but then they get fucking mad when I do not. They even told me if I do not start talking to them that they will send me to a 30 day program where the people there will make me talk. So basically I am in a stressful situation too. They sometimes as well play as the victim too, for example they will use my birthday or some day where they gave me something or went somewhere that I wanted to go and use that against me. What is worse is that I tell them what they are doing wrong to me and hear what they are saying and guess what? They do not listen. They tell me I am wrong and say they do not treat me bad and keep yelling at me.. wish I never had fucked up and confusing parents like them. I' m sorry for spilling that out, I just do not know what to do anymore and feel like things will get worse, but I do hope you feel better. Stay hopeful and strong :)"
