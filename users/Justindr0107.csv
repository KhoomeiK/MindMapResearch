When i was in high school i dated a Lebanese girl. I got a couple books out of the library on how to speak Arabic and taught myself the alphabet and some of the vocab but the syntax was different. 

I already knew some Spanish, and by proxy other latin/romantic languages, so after looking a bit at Farsi it was a no-brainer.  It's consideres an indo-european language.  The vocab is similar to latin, and the syntax isn't very difficult.   The alphabet and writing is the same as Arabic, so once you learn that it's easy-peasy.

The reason was partially curiosity and partially because i thought i might be eligible to join the Army after release.   That didn't work out so much but I am thankful for flexing my brain folds!"

2. You want to die but have no want to kill yourself.

3. (This one's debated) You don't care whether you live or die.


The best thing to do it to recognize if you feel any of these ways and then talk to your therapist/psychologist about it.  Everyone should always get a second opinion, absolutely by a professional."
todayilearned,fepgigp,t1_fep2izy,1579319916.0,"That doesn't sound like a silly question.  No question is silly if your intention is learning.

Violence is seen every day.  It may not be directed towards you.  If you haven't already, you learn how to control your fight or flight reactions (control being reading the sounds of fighting around you and walking away from it or just stepping back to watch because there isn't anything else going on.)

There is always going to be someone who tries to fuck with you, but its not the way you think it is.  They try to be nice first, they want to see how weak you are.  Anyone who had ever loved someone knows that weakness isn't really fear, its trust.

I was never personally asked or pressure to join a gang, but for people in the inner city it might be different because of where they came from and where they have to go back to when they are released.  I made sure everyone around me knew i was there to do my bid and nothing else.

Rape is fake as hell, unless its power.  That might be Max security+.

Straight guys aren't the only ones to go to jail.  When you get there you find your own hustle to make money.  The gay dudes i was in jail with used prostitution as their hustle.  I saw a guy who needed love so bad he dated a dude in prison but still had his lady on the outside.

Sorry i cant give you more, i only spent 2 years in.  Maybe it was the golden amount of time to experience it.  I've been out for 10.5 years.  

It seems like a drop in the bucket  and I would never want to go back but at the same time i miss it every day.  Figure that one out."
todayilearned,fepetix,t1_fepao6s,1579318729.0,"A lot of people do.  Part of the problem is that the general mentality is different then what science has proven.  People want to be good (philosophically questioning at least), but we have base instincts and the first is to sulrvive.  Survival mean different things to different people.  For the wealthy it could mean living as you always have.  For the poor it could mean getting by the way that worked for other poor.

Everyone has a story and some people make mistakes, even horrendous ones.
