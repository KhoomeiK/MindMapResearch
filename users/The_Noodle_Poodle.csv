books,fc2yi0k,t3_efx2v2,1577377369.0,"Don't worry about ""wasting"" time on books. You won't notice yourself changing because change is gradual, but when you look back on yourself you'll see a difference. Read whatever makes you happy. Often, the things you get out of book are subtle or subconscious, but you might notice how it affects you at a later date (for example, when I was younger, I read a lot of Percy Jackson just for fun, and I now realise how the series helped me cope with my depression by portraying neuro divergent characters as equal).

I'm a slow reader, too, so if you want recommendations, I'd say start with smaller books (~100 pages). The Great Gatsby is a classic and Coraline is one of my favorites and still enjoyable to an older audience. Also, don't be afraid to look in middle grade section. Books made for younger people are typically easier to read without necessarily being dumbed down (eg. Percy Jackson). 

If you're worried about time, audio books are really helpful. You can do something while you listen and if you read along, it can help speed your reading a bit.
