I will push back on your statement regarding ecollar. Yeah, if you doing a shock as a punishment it‚Äôs going to escalate aggressive behavior, just as if you hit the dog, but if you are using positive reinforcement with a vibration and noise setting then holy crap- it‚Äôs like you can communicate with them on a whole new level. I‚Äôve only had positive results on my three reactive dogs. It almost eliminates unpredictability. Out of five trainer I work with right now, 4 recommend ecollar as the first step in controlling a reactive dog. Obviously a small pool, but I believe this is what most trainer are heading towards."

You are better off buying simple design and the then adding a little design element with the Circut. (Like those little slips of paper that bind the invite, RSVP, and directions card).

Though, even if your dog is perfect on recall, do not let him off leash. Because of OTHER people (and the fact that shit still happens) because the liability is on you, and if you know you have a reactive dog and do these things, it‚Äôs negligence and you are no longer covered by insurance (usually homeowners) if something was to happen. 
You do not want a lawsuit. Trust me. We had someone try to ‚Äúsocialize‚Äù their dog by stopping our gate and letting the dogs react to each other for 15 minutes, despite beware of dog signs. I heard the chaos and went out as fast as I could mid task. Keep in mind, this was a Morkie, and my dog is a an Anatolian (read MASSIVE). She jumped the fence (keep in the mind that the woman had to come fifty feet onto our property to get to the back gate) and hurt the dog (not too bad but requires a vet that cost $2000.) we were liable because we had a ‚Äúknown dangerous dog‚Äù (the signs acknowledge that we knew)."

InteriorDesign,fcjp2x8,t1_fcjo39d,1577697497.0,"I did see that short wall, and when I lived in a similar  cape cod, I did not mind it the ceiling taking up so much space and being white. 

I don‚Äôt recommend using the same color for walls and ceiling because (IMO) it‚Äôs dated  (popular in the 70s) and it‚Äôs bland - there isn‚Äôt anything to break up the space/ add dimension so it‚Äôs uninteresting/ your eyes see it as flat. 

There are things you can do to combat that! You could but paneling on the walls to add texture, or make sure trim (maybe getting larger trim) and doors are white and pop against the grey.

I personally don‚Äôt like one color, but you seem like you have a good feel on what you want, and just need help visualizing. Same color walls and ceiling is still common, so go with your gut.  

Additionally: yes, I think you could make the wall behind the bed and the wolf wall both accent walls. I would not recommend doing the accent walls AND the ‚Äúsitting area‚Äù a different color; that would be too much going on (3-4 different paint colors). Would highly recommend an accent wall. 

I‚Äôve grabbed a few photos I used for inspiration when I was redoing my cape cod room that have the slanted ceiling walls painted the same as the vertical walls. https://imgur.com/gallery/V7VQzpe

Even with that painted the same, the horizontal ceiling walls are still white. If you do it, you‚Äôll only have a white stripe about four feet wide down the length of the room. That may be nice, because it will carry your eye down the length of the room, highlight how the space is largest.

If visualizing it is the problem, Pinterest is a life savor. You don‚Äôt need an account. Just search article bedroom, you‚Äôll get lots."

InteriorDesign,fcjkcp4,t3_eh736x,1577691097.0,"I do not mean this harshly, but you can‚Äôt skip the education/specialization and then call yourself a professional.

IMO, making a profession a side hustle undercuts the profession and is really detrimental to those who have worked hard for their skills and knowledge.

To answer your question; I would leave the slanted ceiling white, or another color, but not she same color as the walls.

Avoid dark colors, as the large art piece and bedding is darker, and you don‚Äôt want it to feel small and closing it. 

May I suggest picking two colors? One for the bed area and a complimenting color for the sitting area (near the stairs). OR I would recommend either the wall with the header (wolf art) OR the wall behind your headboard be an accent wall, one-two shade darker than the rest. 

May also want to paint the stairwell, as that yellow may compete with other things I see going on; though I like grey and yellow.

Other side tips: cheap and easy to replace the light fixture, and it could be a real mood changer to the room. Never see a tv mount like that; it‚Äôs cool, but the room would benefit if the tv was tucked away, maybe on a side wall with a mount that can pull out."

HomeDecorating,fcix4aw,t3_ehfh25,1577671916.0,"I recently painted the mantel white, the brick a bluish grey, and the walls a green Griege. We can‚Äôt afford to replace the carpet right now. 

I‚Äôm really struggling. Our couch is black modern, and unjust can‚Äôt seem to get the room to come together. I tried 20 different colors on the fireplace.

Suggestions? Or will it just look off until we replace the carpet with wood?"
HomeDecorating,fchicrk,t1_fchhod6,1577650707.0,"I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it too much. I have few in high places. Philodendron are so hardy. I generally water mine every three to four weeks, but also use one of those ‚Äúbubble sticks‚Äù that self waters the plants.  Basically only when I go up to dust. 

Really depends on what you‚Äôre willing to do/your routine.  

Fake plants are good too"

Weddingsunder10k,fc9dxzj,t3_egr66q,1577551188.0,"TL;DR: Don‚Äôt listen to people who inflate the day or item.  I make decisions based on what it‚Äôs worth TO ME. 

Preach. I struggled with this so much. We had enough funds for what we wanted (basic affordable venue, food, drinks, attire, dj) but I STRUGGLED with the idea of spending 8-10k on a single day when there are people LITERARY sleeping out in the cold. Kids without food. I‚Äôm not knocking those who choose to do so, it was just not worth it to me. Regardless of if you have the money enough, you know what it is worth TO YOU - and no one should shame for you for spending or not spending money. 

Focus on what you care about. We didn‚Äôt care about decorations, but we did care about ease on the day of. Solution : spend a little more on pretty venue so we don‚Äôt have to decorate. We don‚Äôt care about ‚Äúcapture the moment‚Äù so we hired a photographer for just a few hours instead of all day, and it was an affordable photographer.

Take a breath. What are the two most important things you want that day? Fun? Intimacy? Ease? Make your decisions based on what you care about. 

Sending love"

I have massive shopping anxiety so every time I went to the store I was knocked out for the day. My (overall amazing) mom hated that dress, but after six shops, we found one that looks very similar, but didn‚Äôt have the bits my mom hated. Just need to fix the bodice (too long) and our white instead of nude under the bodice and we good!"
