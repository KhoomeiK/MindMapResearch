What's more important to you: Investing %833/month for a year? Or  finally saying ""fuck you"" to student loans.

From a pure interest perspective youre likely better off investing. But not having any more student loans sounds awesome, also with the election coming up at the end of the year- the stock markets going to be wild. I'd pay off the loans now, to be done with them- then start throwing money into investments monthly. That lets you dollar cost average incase the market tanks. It sort of evens out the risks."

My seed money came from being born disabled, and my parents doctors set up a small trust fund I received when I turned 19. (No idea what it was invested in, but interest rates were double digits when I was born) That was lucky thing #1

Two, my stepdad became a stock broker when I was 10, by the time I was 16-17 I started to get interested in what he did. Started buying stock in like $200-300 increments, like buy 5 shares of HP computers, A year later by 5 shares of Coca-Cola. 

Got handed my small trust fund (enough to buy a new car cash- a lot of money, but not A LOT of money) Against my stepdads advice invested it, 3 months later the stock market crashed. In 18 months I lost 2/3 of it. Mistake #2 selling everything, threw out the baby with the bathwater. Two companies I bought at $50 then sold at $30 for a loss are now worth $150 and $300 so 3-6x what I paid for them, not counting dividend payments. 

In college I started a ROTH IRA retirement account - (grows tax free and I wasnt making much money so my tax rate was low... money put away now is taxed at my current income rate- withdrawn when I'm ready to retire tax free and hopefully at a higher income and tax rate. 

Went through another crash, held onto the stuff  I bought and watched it sink, bught more to lower my average cost. 

Inherited a small inheritance, - hoping to use that to buy a house in a couple of years. Dont make much money, but my new job allows me to go back to school on their dime which could increase my wages 25-100% and if I play my cards right and get a little lucky, I could potentially retire at 60 with a pension on top of it. 

Don't worry about keeping up with the Jones, theyre probably spending all their money buying fancy houses and cars while and their deep in debt. Get that degree, save 10%-?% buy quality stuff, not the most expensive stuff, make your money work for you and some day, you'll have a pile yourself. Check out /r/financialindependence 

Those guys have high income careers, but I follow them just for motivation.

I also did 2 years at a community college, had a 75% scholarship and started grad school like a year before the economy collapsed so my part time job covered half my tuition (they took it away from part time people while I was in school but since I'd already used it for school I was grandfathered in and was allowed to keep it until I graduated, as long as I was eligible)"
