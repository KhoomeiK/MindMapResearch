AsianBeauty,ffby4ko,t3_esoiu6,1579786483.0,"Need suggestions for oil cleansers. First one I used was actually by burts bees- tried heimish balm and hated it, realized I’m an oil girl- then tried Hada labo. Nothing has cleansed the way burts bees did! It got so deep and got all the gunk out but I’m looking for something AB so I can purchase it all together with my other skincare items."
AsianBeauty,ffbvwxv,t1_ffb1llj,1579784536.0,Same about cleansing balms! What do you use for an oil cleanser? I’m on the search for my perfect match.
AsianBeauty,ffb5izh,t1_ffb55ka,1579752350.0,"Thanks for the info! I’m definitely looking for something lighter, and it’s the cheaper option! Win, win."
AsianBeauty,ffb39dh,t1_ff94c3g,1579750673.0,What’s the difference between Missha perfect cover and choboyang?
HCCFL,fedo3pa,t1_fedlh47,1579016189.0,"Yep. Anything. They either direct deposit it into your account or send a check. They don’t monitor how you use it. But how much you will get depends on how much you, or your parents(if you’re a dependent) make."
HCCFL,feae3a0,t1_feadnnu,1578947471.0,"Yeah, that’s a good first step. I not only get all my classes and books paid for, I also get a good sized refund that I can use on supplies or anything else I need."
college,fe8ejtg,t1_fe6bqg8,1578925294.0,I’ve been doing a lot of soul searching. Working on better habits for my health and mental. So I think that has a lot to do with it. My confidence has sky rocketed because of it.
HCCFL,fe6619z,t1_fe65srs,1578882585.0,Have you applied for fafsa? Do you know if you’re eligible for the pell grant?
HCCFL,fe63xbk,t3_en9bj4,1578881229.0,I think you’re referring to California’s new legislation which does not apply to Florida.
inspiration,fe63gic,t3_enpeay,1578880929.0,I found this helpful. Thanks!
college,fe61sm1,t3_entcf9,1578879864.0,"Just remember your only responsible for your own feelings. It may be frustrating but focus on the gratitude you feel for your opportunities. Don’t let yourself create a grudge because it will only affect you. Just mostly focus on you, ground yourself in your gratitude. It will make all the difference. Maybe try journaling or create a morning and nighttime routine where you have some alone time. Go for a walk, enjoy this new chapter of your life!"
college,fe5y84z,t1_fe5u88k,1578877596.0,Not excited for the study curve! I have some heavy memorization classes so I’m going to have to get used to the repetition and get creative to make it stick.
getdisciplined,fe5tpw3,t1_fe54ikt,1578874727.0,Doable for all of the activities and also answers the question “how did people learn before the internet?”
college,fe5t7f2,t3_entzbt,1578874409.0,"Same! I killed it last semester and even though my classes are harder this semester, I’m pumped!"
AbrahamHicks,fdosvmg,t1_fdmv1p5,1578612125.0,Do you mind answering some questions? I get kind of fuzzy when watching all the videos and reading all the info. I get that that’s a part of learning process but sometimes I don’t really receive the information clearly so I’m hoping that someone who actually practices can clarify for me. It’s hard to follow Abraham’s wording and pace sometimes.
ChoosingBeggars,fcxiz9t,t3_ejewev,1578064107.0,This is why I don’t interact with other military spouses. I would also never live under the title “military spouse”.
tretinoin,fac2o52,t1_f8syfon,1575932599.0,"Wow, sorry I’m so late. I do toner, thin essences, snail mucin, thin layer of emulsion(let all of that sink), tret, moisturizer, oil.

Edit to add: some nights I do two layers of snail and I use it in the daytime also in the same order. It sinks in really well and non greasy."
