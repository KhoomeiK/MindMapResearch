Chemists find the concept of bonding atomic radii to be useful.  It's an imprecise concept, but the coefficients of variance are not large.  If you look at the distance between two nuclei in an Hâ‚‚ molecule and halve it, you get an estimate of the radius of an H atom.  You can do the same thing with C-C bonds in a carbon compound, and with C-H bonds in a hydrocarbon.  If you look at many compounds and average out the discrepancies, you get a useful set of measurements of atomic radii.
