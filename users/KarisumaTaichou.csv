Many RPG stories follow generic archetypes, but Terranigma's world was so relatable growing up as a teenager and helped me cope with existential issues.  The final sequence is still one of the most tragic and cathartic that I've ever experienced.

I'd love to see the collection you're talking about along with a remake of Terranigma so we can hear modern interpretations of the music with options for the old music (similar to the Secret of Mana remake).

Everyone thought I was weird and made up rumors that I was doing drugs, etc.  I had no concept of what anxiety even was, but found myself exiled because of it until I found new friends in middle school.  All I could do was just nod my head and agree that I must be some kind of fucked up person."

Listen to these songs and tell me they aren’t evocative of the Old Gods:

[Lunacy](https://youtu.be/bzdw1MVJQME)  (Old God ritual)

[The Seer](https://youtu.be/zjqdDMgpbDU) (“I SEE IT ALL I SEE IT ALL I SEE IT ALL I SEE IT ALL I SEE IT ALL I SEE IT ALL”)

[The Seer Returns](https://youtu.be/zjqdDMgpbDU) (This sounds kind of prophetic of the aftermath of the N’Zoth fight. Pay attention to the lyrics below.)

&#x200B;

\[Verse 1\]

Behind the veil of silver scars

There is a special inverted star

He's a greasy beast

Heaving in a field of sticky black mud

I'm down here naked

There's a hole in my chest

Both my arms are broken

Pointing east and west

&#x200B;

\[Refrain\]

Your life pours into my mouth

My light pours out of my mouth

My life pours into your mouth

Your light pours into my mouth

Your life pours into my mouth

My light pours out of my mouth

My life pours into your mouth

Your life pours into my mouth

&#x200B;

\[Verse 2\]

There's a jagged deep crack

In the crust of the earth

Spreading from north to south

&#x200B;

\[Refrain\]

Put your light in my mouth

Put your light in my mouth

Put your light in my mouth

Put your light in my mouth

Put your light in my mouth

Put your light in my mouth

Put your light in my mouth

Put your light in my mouth

&#x200B;

\[Verse 3\]

Ahh, the mountains are crumbling

Ahh, the canyons are thundering

All the people are fucking

They're just a pile of writhing, selfish bliss

I know I'll never die

I scream up at the sky: ""You have arrived.""

&#x200B;

\[Outro\]

Bring the children home

Most Chinese people in California are respectful, but I’ve never seen such disgusting feral human behavior as I have from Chinese nationals in Japan.

* Blatantly littering on the street
* Nonchalantly spitting and coughing everywhere 
* Casually shoplifting before walking out of a convenience store
* Crossing the street whenever they feel like it with no regard for anyone else
* Cutting in line and trying to barricade others from entering the elevator
* Trying to steal my friend’s iPhone off the table in the airport food court while we were eating
* Chinese dad letting his son piss on the locker room floor at a popular onsen resort (I let the staff know immediately and they said they’d clean it up. The dad and kid walked away without being punished. WTF?!)

I know they have their grievances with Japan over the past, but why the fuck would you go to a country you hate and behave that way? It’s embarrassing and far beneath what can be dignified as human behavior.
