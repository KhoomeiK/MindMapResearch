cats,ffbonor,t1_ffbo7ib,1579775989.0,Advice from someone you donâ€™t know. Take it or leave it. Wait a long time before you adopt another cat. No kitty can replace the one you lost. Maybe even a year. Then another special kitty can help you heal. You will find love and joy again. I promise. It happened to me.

corgi,fe3dhdt,t1_fe3askn,1578848322.0,"Hi nothere. I understand that a â€˜fluffyâ€™ Pembroke corgi is not the breed standard. Usually corgis are smooth coated. I had to look for six months to find a reputable breeder (NOT a puppy mill!) in order to find Dewi. I contacted the mid-Atlantic corgi breeders assn. It was just by chance that one of breeders had a litter with a fluffy (Dewi). We had to drive five hours to get him.   Breeder was wonderful. Insisted that pups need mom for at least ten weeks, even tho they are weaned. Good luck on your search. PS. Corgis are bred to be working dogs. You will need a trainer to help you. Dewi is very smart, but a bit naughty and nippy. Just saying."
