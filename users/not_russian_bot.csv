asktrp,fe0ljwl,t1_fdxvtj5,1578815600.0,I’m finding it interesting the feelings that you triggered in this thread by this comment. I guess religion is red pill.
business,fdpyzuo,t1_fdpkdqv,1578646694.0,"It’s called capitalism. Those with capital allocate it as they see fit. And in this case, the corporation has decided that getting a quality manager is worth it. Not to mention the tight labor market.

I’d also like to note that doctors salaries are inflated in the US because we cap the number of residencies every year and don’t acknowledge foreign equivalents to MDs, creating an artificial labor market.

You should know, however, you have the far superior career as far as job security goes."
skeptic,fdpy9y9,t1_fdnurvw,1578645719.0,Scientism can become dogmatic in similar ways religion can be. I always encourage friends to read the history and philosophy of science and hone in on critical thinking skills.
Foodforthought,fdpx1hc,t1_fdnb2uc,1578644093.0,"Wait, so oligarchs don’t own all the businesses which were previously spun-off of nationalized industries?"
Foodforthought,fdpvshm,t1_fdpnv7i,1578642550.0,"Well, feel free to go ahead and correct what you believe to be inaccurate. Otherwise, your comment is literally worthless."
Foodforthought,fcm9na8,t1_fclvedf,1577767998.0,"I think you fail to understand that a lot of “wealthy” people don’t receive their money via payroll income.

They’re receiving a significant portion via capital gains, which is taxed at a significantly lower rate then payroll income."
business,fafqqqw,t1_fae2p5r,1576029516.0,"You’re in the business sub and the commentary is one of the worst on reddit. Nobody reads the article, nobody cites claims, it’s just a bunch of mostly right leaning and libertarian dudes who play video games and or owns a small business that will soon fail."
