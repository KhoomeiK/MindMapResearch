I am not sure it will lessen that toxic mentality, that would require too much self-awareness from this guy. It would only anger him I think. He is arrogant and he doesnt think he would be doing sonething wrong if he raped someone. Again, I wouldnt risk myself being molested just to play hero (with zero results too).

badwomensanatomy,ff3r1t1,t1_ff3qdbo,1579547006.0,"Well, I do think kids experience sexuality. Of course, they definitely shouldnt be sexualised by adults, and I think they shouldnt act on their sexual urges with other kids either, because they arent mentally ready yet to make their fantasies reality. I do understand why it makes you feel grossed out.

And yes, I think we discover what gets us going pretty young actually."
badwomensanatomy,ff3ps5g,t1_ff3kk8z,1579546229.0,"I definitely had stuff that gave me such a feeling (and also a feeling of fascination and a tingle at my pussy) as a kid too and actually even before I knew about sex, in ages like 2 or 3 years old. I now recognise how they are tied to some of my stronger fetishes/kinks, but back then I didnt really realise what it was (even though I knew about sex early like I said).

And also, I am pretty sure you were experiencing arousal too when seeing that character. See, I think its pretty normal actually."
badwomensanatomy,ff3k7p2,t1_ff3jdli,1579542807.0,"When I was six, a classmate discovered what sex is accidentally, then told all other girls in the class. Since that we were all obsessed with it, kept talking about sex, even our ""favourite"" sex positions and stuff. I also used to read my mom's cosmo magazines for the sex stuff while I was in elementary school. First time I got properly aroused (wet, felt the blood flow etc) I was 8 or 9 and thinking about intercourse with my then crush. I was never sexually abused, and I got my first period like a month before my 14th birthday. Kids can be horny (admittedly I am a very high-libido person though)."
