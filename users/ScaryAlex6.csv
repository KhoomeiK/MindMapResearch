depression,fc3zt48,t1_fc3f055,1577402889.0,"I can relate to this feeling a lot man, my best part of the day is going to sleep and the worst fucking part is having to wake up again. But before shit actually goes down for u and u try to kill yourself you gotta get real fucking spiritual for a sec. I have been dealing with the same thoughts and before making decisions you gotta think things through. You can not predict how you are gonna feel my man. Maybe you were happy asf 5 or 10 years ago and now you feel shit . It can go the the other way around. You can’t predict how you gonna be in a few years. I can’t promise u you’re gonna be fine but i can tell you things will change."
