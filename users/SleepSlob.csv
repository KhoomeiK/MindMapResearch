Also, when you hit 2009 and adopt your first dog don't name her Bella because you thought it was an uncommon name. Name her Wicket  after that Ewok from Star Wars because she looks like the damn thing."

dogs,feimwg3,t3_ep5ems,1579142262.0,"My dog Bella loves a good belly rub and is so used to getting them that when she's ignored she  has this real offended look on her face and will look at the person who ignored her belly. She'll stare at that person for the longest time until they notice her looking and when they do look at her? She'll look away and give them the cold shoulder.

My dog Bella turns on what I like to call  ""Priss Switch"" when it rains. Will not actively go out onto wet grass to go toilet and I'll have to physically put her out on the grass where she'll have a look of disgust on her face while slowly walking and looking at the ground as if trying to find the least wet spot to put her paws (But failing because you know, rain). 

Whenever my dog spots a flying roach she locks  her eyes on it and if it at any point gets close to her she hauls ass and will not come back into that room until she hears  the SMACK of a shoe and me going ""Got it!"". Then she'll come back in looking on edge for a bit . Meanwhile this is the same dang dog who'll actively go out of her way to chase Huntsman Spiders inside the home."
AmItheAsshole,febx6az,t3_eo86ne,1578963760.0,NTA. Your sister has zero right to dictate what y'all do together when she's babysitting. Why is  she even concerning herself with that?  Like damn girl help a sister out and give her the chance of freedom and one on one time with her partner. When you're a parent with a busy schedule and little time to just slow it down and be with your partner even just hanging out with each other at home without your kid is very much appreciated. It's not like you're  asking her to take your kid every weekend either. My family and I are always down for looking after each others kids for what ever the reason. No judgement.

AmItheAsshole,fe8w41v,t1_fe5szil,1578931677.0,Where I live it is literally law to keep your animals contained on your property. That includes cats also.  Feral Cats and pet cats are also considered a predatory nuisance on the native species. Feral Cats are deemed such a big enough problem they can even be legally hunted along with other feral/invasive species.
AmItheAsshole,fe6v0pk,t3_enriuc,1578905780.0,NTA and theft is theft. HOWEVER you do need to understand that when you allow a pet to roam then you do need to accept the consequences that can unfortunately come with that. Do you have a backyard? Perhaps instead of letting her free roam the neighborhood that instead you cat proof fence your backyard so Golem can have that freedom without free roaming off your property..

AmItheAsshole,fduan4r,t1_fdua6kh,1578730467.0,He said he was just going to throw pasta and marinara together for OP. That's a lazy throw together meal which requires minimal effort when compared to the maximum effort OP brother would be putting in for the meat based lasagna.
AmItheAsshole,fdu7igy,t1_fdtdeu9,1578728940.0,"Yeah,  how dare the brother put in maximum effort to create  his specialty meat lasagna on his vegetarian sister's birthday and instead throws together a half assed lazy meal of basic pasta and basic marinara which takes no effort at all for her instead.

dogs,fdt269b,t3_emnqy7,1578710947.0,"The most commonly used nicknames for my dog are Little Miss, Happy Bum, Booboo, Stinky, and Gully. 

LITTLE MISS -  She got this because she's a little female.


HAPPY BUM  - She gets happy over the smallest of things and so her tail wags a lot. 


BOOBOO - My mum started with this and it just stuck 


STINKY -  She likes to roll on dirty laundry, will try to try and  lick and sit on your feet when you least expect it, has been caught licking thongs (Flip flops not g-strings lol), always sniffs the cats butt, and once thoroughly rolled all over some foul smelling substance. I don't know what it was but lets just say there was hardly any white left on her and it took a few bsthes to get rid of the stink completely.


GULLY - This is short for Seagull. You ever been stalked by a Gull at the beach  when you've got food? Ever seen the movie Finding Nemo?

BOONUS:
LITTLE SHIT -  Because she can be a little turd at times."
cats,fcmsd4o,t1_fcmmxys,1577789893.0,"Except that the cats we keep as pets (and those th at have gone feral) aren't a natural part of the ecosystem anywhere other than where they naturally originated. 

The wolves of Yellowstone worked as well as it did because they are a very natural and native predatory species of that area.

When you introduce a non-native species and they break out and establish populations in a foreign environment that is not equipped to deal with that new invasive/feral species the natural native species are put in a very vulnerable position that  is not anywhere in their favour. 

Cats will hunt anything they know they are capable of taking down and outside of birds that includes  small native mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Heck Ive seen footage of a feral cat is hunting a Tasmanian Pademelon that was 4kg. These native species would be food for other native species and the introduction of nin-native predatory species is creating competition with the native predators making it hard on both native predators and their prey."

dogs,fc7awjn,t1_fc5yvbh,1577502179.0,"Shelters near me tend to be very filled with Staffy mixes, Herding breed mixes (mainly Cattle Dogs and Kelpies), and Bull Arabs/mixes.  Definitely not the type of dogs suitable for everyone."
dogs,fc78p9d,t3_egdlot,1577500485.0,"$50 for a dog!?! Talk about a steal! My little local rescue pound dog  was $180 while the RSPCA can go anywhere between $200 to over $300 just for their dogs (higher fee for any purebreds ). Cats also get discount adoption days.  Cost aside, if you're committed on rescue then the process shouldn't be a deal breaker. I understand though that not all Shelters/Rescues aren't the same and may have very different adoption  steps but surely  you can find one that suits you."
dogs,fc74vy0,t3_egbn40,1577497602.0,"If it came down to it and my dog needed $5,000 or more dropped on her then I'd go the option of humane euthanasia. It sucks and sounds terrible but it's truth. Even $5,000 is a very serious stretch I'd probably also not do.  That doesn't mean I skimp on her care or don't love her any less. She gets good food, twice yearly full checkups and checkups if anything pops up (just recently had dental work done), the best preventatives, professional grooming, and goes on plenty of adventures. She's a little old lady now and would  rather she live a life of quality over quantity."

dogs,fbd9fxb,t3_ecmwwn,1576753619.0,Sounds like a good price for what I'm assuming is a large dog. I've dished out a little over $900 on dental for my dog who's SMALL. I don't even want to imagine what I would have to dish out if she were larger and needed the same work
