The villain wins at the end of the movie he is in (Batman Under the Red Hood). But he is able to overcome it. I would highly recommend you check it out.

offmychest,feeqwoe,t3_eof3bt,1579039303.0,"Well, to be honest, your students are more likely to die from suicide or a car accident which will require this very important life skill. Most ""school shootings"" that are reported are typically are a person shot themselves at school or on school grounds even when school was not in session or a person walked onto campus with a gun and was stopped before they hurt anyone or they had a plan and were foiled before they even walked onto school grounds. There was an awesome NPR article that discussed this that I would encourage you to look up that discussed these points. It will help put you at ease as well as your students. The best way, in my opinion, is to tell them that in life we take risks every day and there are people out there who will take advantage of that and could come and hurt us and even though it is statistically unlikely it is still best to be prepared. Think of it like the flight attendants who show you how to put on oxygen masks even though plane crashes are not that common. It is better to be safe and prepared than unprepared and sorry. But applaud you for wanting to do it right by your students. Some teachers I had back when Sandy Hook happened didn't even show us the safety video where they didn't even have to teach us as some guy on a screen did it for them."
