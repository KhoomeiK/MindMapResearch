If you hadn't freaked out and poisoned the memory, this could have been a fun Kodak moment. You know, somebody snap a Polaroid of the kid covered in blue frosting with the excitement of having a baby brother plastered on his face. 

Kids do dumb shit, but as an adult it's your responsibility to react like an adult instead of souring the moment for everyone involved."

I’d also like to add that in addition to being together (and living together) for 5 years, we’ve already been married for 2 years and things are going amazingly well. We just postponed our honeymoon for financial reasons. So we’re not exactly newlyweds. It’s not like we got our names tattooed on each other after dating for a month or something. 

Also, this trip was special to both of us for other reasons. If you can’t get a tattoo to commemorate a great shared experience with a person regardless of romantic connection, when can you get one? People get tattoos for interests and hobbies that they may not like or may think are stupid  a few years later. People get tattoos for family members, what if you find out later that that family member was a pedophile or a nazi or something? Everything eventually fades or ends. So might as well enjoy it now."

The cabin that we stayed at was actually in Jefferson, but we spent most of our time in Breckenridge, Frisco and Silverthorne, and Frisco was our favorite! 🙂"

tattoos,fcbvfxq,t1_fcbueag,1577591414.0,"Aw that’s awesome! 🙂 We’ve been together almost 5 years and are enjoying every moment of it! We definitely wanted something subtle that would stand alone no matter what, so no names or faces. Just something to signify the lovely trip. 

It also has a double meaning for me because I used to live in Colorado and left on bad terms, so going back there for me was replacing those old bad memories with something beautiful."

fatlogic,fc4f36u,t3_eg4s63,1577414819.0,The problem with this mindset is that they are fixated on the idea that everyone is focusing on them 100% of the time. This kind of sensitivity seems to be born out of self-obsession.
