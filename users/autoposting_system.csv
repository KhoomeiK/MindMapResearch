Have you ever shot one? It's a pretty terrible experience. Yes, the weight mitigates recoil, the heavy slide mitigates recoil, but somehow it still sucks. I just can't recommend those machines for anybody serious. I mean they cost $150 or something, but just the extra 50 bucks is so much better. Hell, a Sarsilmaz B6P is only $250 at King's right now. You can often find sccy pistols for $200 or $250 on Armslist, and Tauruses are around that amount too, or even less. Hell, there's a place in Atlanta right now selling the Ruger LCP 380 for $215. Whatever the Hi Point 380 weighs, I guarantee that despite the extra weight it's easier to shoot that flyweight Ruger. If you buy a gun and never shoot it because it sucks to shoot, I just don't think it's worth it.

In fact for somebody who's not into the hobby but needs a gun for their house and will practice with it faithfully, I would tell them to buy one of these old Smith revolvers in 38 Special that can be had for $250 all over the place right now. They are much more fun to shoot than a Hi Point, they're probably more reliable, and since they're revolvers they're less prone to operator error, which is a huge deal for a noob. Plus they're Smiths, so they'll have value in thirty years, even Model 10s, which they made six million of.

I know where you're going. I mean I just pointed out that some people don't have a grand to spend on a weapon and training, and those people need lower-priced options. All I'm saying is if all you can afford is a Hi Point, maybe buy an aluminum baseball bat at a thrift store and sell plasma for a couple of months until you can afford something better."
