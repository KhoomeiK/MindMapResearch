VeryBadWizards,ff9d5vr,t3_eovar6,1579710389.0,"The 90 seconds thing actually reminds of something I learned in CBT therapy. The idea is that if some event, internal or external triggers emotional arousal, that initial arousal will only last for a few minutes. So if say, a friend makes a joke at your expense and you are triggered by it (in the sense of your level of emotional arousal being raised), you're going to be angry/sad/ashamed/whatever for a minute to a few minutes and there is nothing you can do about it in the moment.

However, how you respond to it can change a lot. If you immediately start ruminating on it, replaying the event in your head, thinking about previous similar events, etc, you're going to be retriggering yourself and your arousal level will keep rising extending the time when you are angry/sad/ashamed/whatever from a few minutes to a few more minutes, or hours, or longer. And if you keep doing that, you might then start reacting harmfully to those emotions.

CBT usually sees this as a site of intervention. So in a sense, your initial anger at your friend's joke is out of your immediate control. But you can decide whether or not you will escalate your emotional arousal and keep it going, or just let it go. I think that's what the author was trying to point at with their clumsy ""your brain does X but you can choose to do Y""."

So how can you known being a slave leads to suffering in most people? Because slaves have said so. Because slaves have been seen and described as crying, fleeing, etc... The self-reports and actions are the only reason you have to believe being a slave usually leads to misery. And so if you see a slave smiling, saying they are very happy and otherwise acting like a happy person, you have to conclude they are happy. Concluding that they are miserable ""regardless of how \[they\] self-report or \[...\] act"" is self-undermining. If you don't believe their self-reports, why would you believe the self-reports of the people who said it is miserable?"

Sure, sometimes people lie, but being happy is not just a function of your material conditions. It is a psychological state. And people's psychological states differ even when they experience the same material conditions. So asking someone and observing their behavior is probably a better guide to whether someone is happy than just looking at their material conditions.

Like, if I saw the slave above and ever morning, they jumped out of bed and giggled repeatedly during work and smiled all the time, walked with a bounce in their step and kept erupting spontaneously into songs, and kept saying ""Thank God this day is awesome! I am so happy!"" I would conclude they are probably happy. I'd be kind of surprised since almost everyone in their material condition would feel terrible, but humans don't all behave the same way."

DarK,fdhb1nj,t1_fdh9bq8,1578419171.0,"Right. My point is that for that to work, you need a mechanism to keep all those things consistent. So where does that mechanism go?

If you put it in your fundamental laws of physics, I'm pretty sure you get things like instant action at a distance and as soon as that pops up the experimental method gets flushed into the toilet since now, no system can be isolated. But clearly we have done science successfully, so the weird action at a distance somehow kept itself out of our world whenever we did science. Which implies a kind of superdeterminism where the universe tries to trick us into believing we can do science even though we can't. So you might as well throw out everything you think you know since you're basically dealing with some sort of weird cartesian demon.

If you put it at a higher level, you get downward causation where your fundamental laws include things like ""particles behave this way unless they are part of a book being printed, then some new rules apply"" which is also nuts.

So yeah, you can have loops but only if you bite a giant mortar shell or two.

DarK,fdh913i,t1_fdh8sqv,1578418003.0,"So the book will have typos. But for the loop to close, they have to be exactly the same typos. I meant ""typos"" as in like, differences from the one he got from Claudia."
DarK,fdh7a23,t1_fdh5v19,1578416915.0,"Remaking the item is equally problematic though. It implies Tannhaus' book was copied without a single typo. Which is never the case for a book that size. So now your laws of the universe need something like ""if an object brought back in time is being copied, it will be done in a perfect way. Typos are fine any other time."" Which is kind of crazy.

The problem is that things age according to their own space-time trajectories. Jonas lives one day each day, it's just that his days are kind of scattered across time. But that means you can't have any object be on a closed loop. Or even a piece of information. Because those will age along the loop.

Of course, you can have sort of open loops. Like, if I take today's newspaper and give it to my past self, nothing bad happens since my past self doesn't need to copy the newspaper. But the whole self-created object thing doesn't work.

You can get a loop with a finite universe. In fact, there is a theorem in physics that basically says if you have a finite-size system evolving according to deterministic laws, at some point, it will loop. (But there is no backwards causation in there. It's just that the universe kind of resets periodically. You don't remember past loops.)"

DarK,fdh2o9t,t1_fdgzfji,1578414074.0,"Increasing entropy kind of messes with this idea of there being a closed loop though.

Think of it this way: you from 33 years from today pops into existence in front of you and hands you a piece of paper in pristine condition. They say: ""In 33 years you find a time machine. Hold on to this piece of paper take it in the time machine and hand it to yourself."" So you do that. But in 33 years, the paper will have degraded. It's no longer pristine. It will be a little yellowed with age. So on the second cycle, you get a yellowed piece of paper. And on the third an even more yellowed one. Enough cycles pass and the piece of paper crumbles. It's not a stable loop.

And if you don't have entropy increasing, human bodies don't really work. No aging for instance. No memory formation. Stable loops can't work at least the way the show portrays them.

Of course the show is still fun and my OP about killing Hitler was mostly a joke. Not a serious criticism of the show."

Computer programming is incredibly easy. You pick up a book, try something and the computer will tell you instantly whether you got it right or wrong. Some things like physics or math are a bit harder. You can do problems for which solutions are available and check the answer. You can also post proofs online and people will tell you if you made some error.

Philosophy is pretty much on the other end of that spectrum. You could spend your entire life misunderstanding something or making a basic error and never realize that you went wrong, much less how you went wrong. That makes self-studying philosophy really hard. You really need to talk to other humans so they can disagree with you and point out errors in your reasoning. College classrooms are the traditional way this is done. But a reading group or an online forum can also work. Ideally, you will find multiple intersecting communities where you can discuss ideas.

You won't have the guidance of a professor, but you could at least have your ideas challenged by others and avoid the trap of being too isolated.

A good analogy is in law. I can give you consent to enter my property. But if you trespass, I can decide whether to sue you or not. If I don't want to sue you (because, for instance, I decide that your trespass was pleasing to me) then that's the end of it.
