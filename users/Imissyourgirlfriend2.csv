AskMen,ff77023,t3_erv3sy,1579642364.0,"I do what I call ""Apparel Engineering"". A fancy/manly way of saying ""sewing and pattern drafting"". Got into it about 12 years ago.

I was looking for the coat Nei wore in the infamous lobby shoot out scene from the first Matrix. Came across a place that did superb replicas of a number of items from movies. As I oogled the beautiful long coat, I found they also had one from the train station scene from the 3rd film. It wasn't my goal but j fell in love with it anyway. The issue came in that I only had enough $ to buy the lobby coat, the one I had searched for for 10 years and they were ending their Matrix line that year (this was in December, so I had very little time).

It was a simple enough design, my mother said I could probably make it myself and so began the journey of learning how to see and how to modify patterns.

AskReddit,ff6t423,t3_eruebg,1579634330.0,I was hired by a family out of Minnesota to track down their daughter. She had run away a few years prior and somehow gotten herself involved with some rich paraplegic guy as well as the local porn director in Los Angeles. I was pretty close to catching up with her until I got word she had been kidnapped. The guy who tipped me off about the kidnapping seemed to know more about the situation but refused to share his info with me.
