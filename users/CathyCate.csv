facepalm,fehv4ku,t1_fehuae0,1579124478.0,Wisconsin for drinking fountain. Confused the heck out of me when I moved from Minnesota to Wisconsin initially. [Article](http://whoonew.com/2015/03/closer-look-why-bubbler-in-wisconsin/)
facepalm,fehu5k3,t3_ep2x76,1579123925.0,"There are probably few Midwesternisms that stop at the state lines, admittedly, given migration of people & intermarrying! Though “bubbler” comes close. But even that has a pocket in the Northeast US (for historical reasons).  I do seem to have heard “OPE!” more in the Twin Cities, Northern Minnesota & Rochester MN though, than I have in Wisconsin where I live now, and my Chicago-born husband had not heard this exclamation before moving to Minnesota. But it makes sense that it would not be limited to Minnesota!"
facepalm,fehoh7d,t1_fehhi6i,1579120688.0,"Ha! I would think Minnesota as “OPE!” is a classic Minnesota-ism. (Source: born in Minnesota, lived in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and on the border of Iowa. Don’t even get me started on “duck, duck, gray duck” or “bubblers”.)"

WizardsUnite,fab2hcb,t3_e86y67,1575916833.0,"Force quit the game before going to bed, or before restarting in the morning. That has solved this problem for me (soooo frustrating otherwise when you do tasks & they don’t count).  When the game closes itself due to inactivity, it does not have the same effect as far as resetting the daily tasks compared to force-quitting.

Otherwise, you can go to the daily task tab first, before doing any tasks, and that also will solve the problem. But I find force-quitting at bedtime the easiest."
