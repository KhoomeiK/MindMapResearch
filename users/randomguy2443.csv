WGU_CompSci,fednk0g,t1_fedm9z4,1579015838.0,"I apologize for being crass in my initial comment (Now Deleted). In addition I'm sorry to see that this degree wasn't able to help you as you have hoped. Have you considered applying for roles as a business analyst? Computer science programs are usually overkill for those positions and they usually pay similarly to if slightly less than software engineering positions. 

As you've completed the capstone you should have a good understanding of basic machine learning concepts and data visualization, your capstone project should be more than enough to get you in. It is a good career with solid growth prospects. You will only need to know basic SQL commands and usage, tableau, vba, and basic python for data visualization. The scope of all of which the CS program at WGU surpassed.

Relocating for these business analyst roles would be a great idea as well, in particular, Austin, Houston, DFW, Chicago etc. I genuinely think if you apply and emphasize the data-sciency aspects of your time at WGU you can land at least a business analyst role and lead a successful life. I genuinely hope you do apply for these roles as I have no doubt you can land one."
WGU_CompSci,fedkq1f,t1_fedio24,1579013947.0,"I apologize if you were genuine in your post about this program. Though in my defense, it did seem a little suspicious based off of what you wrote. Can you provide any proof that you attended and graduated from the computer science program at WGU? 

You don't have anything to prove to me but I would hate to see potential students dissuaded from this program (which has been a blessing for me, counter to your experiences) if your comments are actually untrue."

WGU,fdf5g4v,t3_ekyxrs,1578353736.0,"Honestly those classes are more troublesome than you would think, not hard by any means, but for intro to comm. you actually gotta go through the entire book to pass the OA. Then do a write up and recording which has to follow the evaluation rubric very closely. It‚Äôll take at least 2 weeks.

Tech. Comm. has you writing a very specific paper which must follow the rubric very closely so the evaluators can find competency. This can be done in a week if you are diligent and do a little bit everyday. That being said, neither of these classes are difficult."

tifu,fcw028h,t1_fcvm3x3,1578014027.0,"You need a B.S. in computer science typically. But not needed as many web developers are without degrees and they eventually move onto full stack development and backend programming with C# and less commonly Java. A core CS degree is needed for entry level back-end development typically but not always. A masters in CS is mainly only needed for data science, machine learning, or academia.

The term ‚Äúengineer‚Äù is typically used since software developers often need to format out the logic of a software application in a flowchart or diagram before actually implementing the nuances of each piece of logic using ‚Äúcode.‚Äù Though systems analyst do that typically and the devs implement whatever features using code or maintain and debug already created software.

I guess building software this way can be compared to electrical or mechanical engineers in the sense that the engineers design logical circuitry and mechanisms and systems on a diagram before that design is implemented and built into actual electrical or mechanical systems.

This is why software developers are called ‚Äúengineers‚Äù since they are building an application. Though some would consider devs not ‚Äúreal engineers.‚Äù I think at the end of the day both developers and engineers are contributing to building new and constantly changing technology and systems. Both are great professions and have my utmost respect. 

I am currently in my last semester of a CS bachelors and am excited to be hopefully starting a software job soon after, I congratulate OP as well for doing what he loves at such a young age. Software development is truly remarkable and rewarding for those who have a passion for it."

Georgia Techs OMSCS might be a good option since from your post it looks like you completed CS at a brick and mortar. It will be hard but you should be able to do it.
