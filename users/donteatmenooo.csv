Blacksmith,fejr2j1,t3_epbs2q,1579183717.0,"Very cool! The pin is just a little too long, though, I'd say."
AskReddit,fejp9f8,t1_fejjrfi,1579182293.0,"And just fyi, as someone who was a very smart 17 year old a long time ago, the people who actually succeed in life are the ones who work hard, regardless of their innate intelligence. The naturally smart ones tend to fall behind as soon as it gets tough. Be willing to work to pass your classes and stuff, and you'll do better in the long run, even if your grades aren't as good. It's taken me a long time to come to terms with this, but it is so, so true. So who cares if you think you're a dumbass? In some ways that benefits you."
AskReddit,fehjo34,t1_fegisvi,1579117913.0,"Oh man, you're so lucky! You have so much time to pursue and redefine dreams! And society isn't even putting that much pressure on you for many years still. I hope you do it!"
cincinnati,fehhmyi,t1_feh3s2g,1579116719.0,Was going to recommend Junkers!
dyeing,feh9cln,t1_fegs1bp,1579111848.0,Thank you! I will look at some of the local dry cleaners and alterations shops.
sewing,feehz7x,t1_feeert6,1579034131.0,I didn't realize that about the tracing paper. What a brilliant idea. Thank you so much!!
sewing,fee85hh,t3_enmvkb,1579028374.0,"I'm a newbie at sewing.  How do you print online patterns?  Do you use normal printer paper?  Isn't that hard to pin onto the fabric?  How does it all work??  I have used a store-bought pattern before (well, I have yet to sew it, but the fabric is all cut out), but I am having trouble seeing how print-your-own patterns can work."

AskReddit,fdjvaix,t1_fdjg6op,1578488668.0,Vigo is a pretty cool name...?
ImaginaryLandscapes,fd3ea32,t1_fd1pslq,1578157488.0,"Yup. Like, if I saw this while on a walk, I would recognize that I should be freaked out, but I wouldn't be. I would calmly walk towards it. So odd."
TheDepthsBelow,fcrnm7e,t1_fcq7tjy,1577904172.0,This is fascinating.

recumbent,fcndg8s,t1_fcn87sb,1577809372.0,"Sorry, yes! I ended up going to a local shop that had a lot of recumbents and asking for advice. Ended up getting him a Trident trikes spike 2. He seems very excited about it! I think it will end up working well. Thank you to everyone who helped me out!!!"
cincinnati,fc5pxj0,t1_fc5olda,1577463441.0,Please don't support salvation army. They are not accepting of everyone. You shouldn't be in charity if you can't be charitable to anyone who needs it.
ImaginaryLandscapes,fc5ooul,t1_fc5dsas,1577462760.0,"I dunno, he looks more like he's annoyed he had to be there and wait for her to pick every damn flower she sees and can't she just do this herself why did I get pulled into this dammit mom stop trying to set me up with this stupid princess"
AskReddit,fc5nddj,t1_fc5m6zk,1577462028.0,"Or maybe you can do what literally all non-creepy folk do, and have normal, non-flirty conversations with people. Then if there feels like something between you, you can start flirting."
AskReddit,facwz3p,t3_e8d5ap,1575949055.0,"Similar to the box of trashy books idea, if you are seriously in a bind and have to have a gift NOW, get one of your favorite books off your shelf, write a super personal note inside about how it's your favorite and why and that you hope they will love it as much as you did. This is obviously for someone you know well. 





For a less personal last-minute gift, buy a mug (or get the newest/cleanest-looking mug from your cabinet), and fill it with some tea bags or pouches of hot chocolate or instant coffee (whatever you have on hand). Add a candy cane or something and wrap it all pretty and it's a great gift."
