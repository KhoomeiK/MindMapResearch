science,fclvy0t,t1_fclhh0r,1577757781.0,"> The most likely correct hypothesis is that people that overeat junk food don’t get enough fiber for the amount of carbohydrates they consume. You rarely find a carb in nature that doesn’t have fiber attached to it. So fiber intake correlates with more healthy eating. If your diet is purely meat and leafy greens fiber is completely useless.

Yea that's my point. American diet is almost entirely processed carbs and meat. I'm not saying you should supplement your diet with fiber pills, I'm saying you should eat more vegetables."
