Fortsatt fritt fram för IS-resenärer från Sverige att delta i folkmord alltså, bara man är försiktig med maskering och inte lämnar digitala bevis eller ögonvittnen."

PSVR,feovtva,t1_fe6n81k,1579306503.0,"Two huge details that made me uninstall and mail for refund now after trying it 30 minutes:

- it's not just the gun graphics that ""rubber bands""/ lags behind when strafing while using aim controller, but the line of fire too!

- the movement direction of the aim controllers front stick is relative to your head orientation, instead of being relative to aim gun orientation which is the standard way to do it! This results in difficulty to fire and look different directions while moving.. really really annoying which wreaks the natural full locomotive feel other aim supported games like Firewall and Farpoint have.

Just wanted to give my differing and negative point of view, since you gave good and thorough opinions before. :P"

PSVR,fdx3arg,t3_en95dl,1578764854.0,I hot tip is to NOT have the camera where the TV is. It just raises the risk of accidents and is annoying people who tries to watch the screen while someone else is playing.
science,fdw7cwj,t1_fdw3dgq,1578755862.0,"But I'm still not convinced that definition of ""genuinely hikikimori"" is clinically sound since it probably is social isolation, not physical, that is the most relevant circumstance for the individuals in question. The physical ""house bound"" isolation is arguably just an, albeit important, mediating/moderating factor that's easier to quantify.

Social activity online might for example be much more significant that a couple of trips to a store each week."
science,fdw2huc,t1_fdvw2g6,1578754351.0,"But my argument is that such tiny and shallow interaction might not be clinically significant for the mental health issues in question.

PSVR,fduupwp,t1_fdsvr6g,1578739133.0,"So much text but still you omit the flaw that you can't turn/ circle strafe while shooting secondary fire with the aim controller, because of button bindings. It sounds pretty important to me."

Your arm swing now looks great and must relieve your core quite a bit. Huge improvement. Also looks like it helped to open up your stride?"

PSVR,fdderbc,t1_fdc039x,1578308929.0,Why does alternative fire make it hard to turn and shoot at the same time? Is it bound to a button besides the right hand thumbstick?

getdisciplined,fc9qd2m,t1_fc8jt0g,1577556608.0,"Mindwandering isn't a problem.. it's rather the point! If your mind didn't wander so you can gently refocus again it wouldn't be as effective practice. See at every distracting thought and gentle refocus almost like a pushup. It's the ability to catch yourself in the act of distraction AND the refocus that is a big part of the actual purpose of meditation.

Even if your mind wanders every third second it is still, and perhaps more so, effective practice."

But I think she is into him (obviously since giving lap dance - daaah), but I'm still confused as to why she's overly clearly calling him just a ""friend"" and never hinting about that it will go somewhere more. 


OP - maybe you're worried he will be reading this, and don't wanna give away your enthusiasm about him? 
Did I hit the mark? :)

If that's the case - go n' get him again, girl!! Don't underestimate how some guys just can't take a hint, even if it's like a sledge hammer in the face as in this example."
