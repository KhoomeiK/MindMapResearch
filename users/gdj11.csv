learnjavascript,ff6zafj,t3_erz30h,1579637964.0,"`$` is just a variable. In JavaScript a dollar sign is a valid variable name. For example `var $ = 'hello';` is valid too.

jQuery uses `$` as the name of its main function name since it's short and looks like a ""system"" command of sorts. (Actually, the main function name is `jQuery` and `$` is basically just an alias. You can usually use both `jQuery()` and `$()` interchangeably, but sometimes another library is loaded which also uses `$` and in that case you should use `jQuery`.) So when you're doing stuff with jQuery, like `$('.element').hide()` what you're really doing is calling the `$` function with one parameter: the string `'.element'`. That function does a bunch of fancy jQuery stuff, then returns a jQuery object. In JavaScript you can chain functions together, so after the `$` function runs, it returns a jQuery object and then the jQuery object's `hide()` method is called."

learnjavascript,feyvdem,t3_eqqxk3,1579450986.0,"First a comment about your code. You're mixing straight JavaScript selectors with jQuery. Since you're already loading jQuery, just use jQuery's simpler syntax, e.g. `$('.imageGalerie')` instead of `document.getElementsByClassName('imageGalerie')`.

Now, to make your code reusable, first change your ID to a class. IDs should not be used in HTML that will be repeated. Wrap your gallery in a div with a class, something like `<div class=""galerie"">...</div>`.

Now you can do something like this with your JavaScript:

    $('.galerie').each(function(){
    	var imageGalerie = $('.imageGalerie',this),
    	    imageGrand = $('.imageGrand',this); // Notice ""imageGrand"" is now a class, not an ID
    	
    	imageGalerie.click(function(e){
    		$(this).siblings().css('border', ''); // Remove border on siblings
    		$(this).css('border', '2x solid black');
    		imageGrand.attr('src', this.src).hide().fadeIn(500);

Even people with poor form can learn to play very well, because your body just learns to adjust so that the ball goes where it needs to. I can see how not using your dominant eye could severely mess up your game if you’re constantly changing your line of sight, but if you’re consistent with your non-dominant eye you should still be making shots. Only making 1 out of 15 tells me your routine is not consistent at all, and paying attention to your dominant eye probably forced you to be consistent.

I think the lack of consistency in stance and aim was the issue, or that your body’s position while using your non-dominant eye was causing you to put unintended spin on the ball. But whatever it was, you found a routine that’s obviously working for you now, so I’d say stick with that :)"
