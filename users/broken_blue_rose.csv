bipolar,fdsegtj,t3_emzeja,1578700835.0,"Agreed.. On my 2nd marriage as well; got my diagnosis about a year after getting married and husband is super supportive. First marriage was a mess; i even started having thoughts that i might be bipolar then, but it got dismissed by my ex (whom has depression). 

I think it just involves a lot more attention and dedication from both parties, and tons of strength from both as well"

Pets,fdm6l8y,t3_em3klw,1578541053.0,"Cats don't do soo well with sudden changes. Give kitty a place that is his and let him be in there for a bit. There's an introduction process that cats do with other cats that might help here. Check out jackson galaxy on YouTube, TONS of cat help videos that are sure to get you on the right path. 

P.S. some cats end up tolerating other pets ( my female cat gigi with our male cat mouse) so do beware that cats have their own personalities and likes/dislikes just like humans. Give them time and check out those videos :)"

a. exceptionally disappointed in the male population for acting like this, they could behave better

b. feel like I'm just too ugly for any of this to happen to me (because it rarely, if at all does), honestly when my husband does it's a bit of a self esteem boost, but at the same time... -shrugs- eh..."

stevenuniverse,fc31ypq,t3_efw45i,1577379593.0,"Context: prior to us discovering that they were the same character, Rose made me think of my mom in a lot of different ways. I'd lost her quite some time ago and her character in some ways reminded me of her. In addition, i'd gone through a lot of rough times and bad decisions on my own part and grown through those.

Little story here:

when we all found out that rose/pink are the same character..  i had a lot of conflicting emotions about it. On one hand I felt like the figure that I had related to my own mom (who has passed quite some time ago) had suddenly changed to a different representation in my life; me. I've gone through a lot of rough stuff that i don't want to go a lot of details into. None-the-less, it took a lot of time and reflecting to realize that I've made mistakes that i tried to hard to fix, but were just lost... or tried to start my life again because i needed a fresh start that ended up being worse than where i had just left; Constantly trying to be a better person than the last mess up. 

Yea.. Pink/Rose did a lot of things that were irresponsible or immature, but she tried so hard to fix it when she realized she had messed up. Some problems are unable to be fixed, others take a lot of time, and some we try to let our past go and not let it define who we want to become. 

&#x200B;

No one is perfect, and I think that was what i eventually came to terms with in regards to her character arc."
