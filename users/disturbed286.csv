You're right and the Fat Boy S did have a chrome pair.  I bought it new and changed a lot of things, but not that.  

I'm on a 2019 Heritage now, and Harley no longer includes the heel half anymore, to my chagrin.  The front guy it does have is black, which is nice, but a black heel shift counterpart is weirdly difficult (expensive) to find."

Made me want one, and the Akro on it sounded great.  Although not as great as the R nineT did.

The RR is one of those things where I respect the machine and its capabilities so I rode one too...but I can just never really enjoy that kind of bike.  Too uncomfortable and you can't ever really open it up like it wants so the lack of comfort isn't even worth it (personal opinion of course).
