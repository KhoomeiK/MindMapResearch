FPS drops to half every once in a while for a time, then returns back to normal. I've found a solution though. Change your object quality down by 1 and up by 1... then the fps goes back to normal... really weird."

Not sure if this is new but been noticing that some skins go near black in shadow, best example is toymaker poncho, if you are inside or near a shadow it goes pitch black. No matter what graphics setting.

Very weird. hope you can look into it it's a very nice skin, seen it happen to a few others as well."
playrust,fcmr9lt,t3_ehst79,1577788304.0,Play low pop at first. Even a server with 60pop max. This will let you actualy move around the map some without instantly dying.

playrust,fckqn1d,t1_fckq9uy,1577731087.0,"would be too op if you can place too many, and annoying to open. 1 per base is probably better.

either that or make it really high upkeep. like 10 hqm

you could just make it so it only works if the door is placed so it opens inward, if it opens outward it kinda defeats its purpose"
playrust,fcknzqo,t1_fcknq51,1577729461.0,"works like bunker, you shut it from inside and have to open it from inside. only difference is that it's slightly weaker and it frees up building so everything isn't a bunker formation anymore"
