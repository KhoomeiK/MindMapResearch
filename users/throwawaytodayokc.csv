homeless,ff2psa1,t1_ff2p81x,1579518361.0,"May I ask why they are not in school? I think that it's important for them to be enrolled...  It'll free up time on your hands during the day, they get an education and probably qualify for free breakfast and/or lunch."
homeless,ff2p4zd,t1_fewpudw,1579517394.0,How old are your kids? Do any go to school?
homeless,ff2o421,t3_eqekte,1579515820.0,"With 5 kids, I would seriously consider shelter. There's a lot at risk. CPS cannot intervene for poverty alone, but living in the car and not having a basic need like food met can go downhill fast. Staying up with hygiene, your kids getting homework done from school, etc. will only get harder with poor sleep, hunger and the unknown. 

I'm currently at an adult and family shelter. There are downsides of course but they don't outweigh the downsides of fighting the unknown alone.  You'll have a place to return to at night, space for the kids to do kid things, have food, and most importantly, people who are connected to resources and knowledge."
homeless,ff2n5yd,t3_eqgqd4,1579514346.0,"Are you referencing subsidized housing? It could be:

*limited income and not being able to afford their share 

*being a single parent with kids, making a roommate situation difficult to find

*someone with a past with addiction and and not wanting to around a ""friend""/roommate that isnt on the same page even if it means a roof

*mental illness, addiction or just personality that makes it difficult for someone wanting to be their roommate

*poor credit, criminal background or rental history and cant get a lease in non-subsidized housing

*poor references with past rental history

*non custodial parent wanting a place their kids can call home when they visit 

*mobility or disability issues that require a certain type of home

*pets"
homeless,ff2lsnf,t3_er8ulb,1579512224.0,"I am in a shelter that is open to all, but I think youll need to be mindful at any shelter.

 I read a bit of your post history. Many homeless have past drug addictions, and being in a vulnerable place, some have been kicked out for relapsing. It is sad to see. The good thing is that we have a recovery support group here open for anyone in recovery. I'm hoping maybe the one you're thinking of will have support like that as well. 

Just a FYI, a lot of shelters do have rules and expectations like curfew, employment (e.g must show proof of job or looking for work if applicable), work toward housing, etc.   A lot of people who leave voluntarily struggle with rules and authority. So just be prepared to know that it will not be a home, but a place with things in place to keep everyone safe. That said, I like the rules and structure and it helped me pull out of a darker place. 

Stick with a few good people, work closely with the case managers, and find things on the outside to give you hope. 

I say give it a try over living it on the streets. You'll have your basic needs met to give you the mental energy to get your life together. I've lived in my car, and I just got crazier, sadder and more hopeless. 

Whatever you choose, I wish you peace and hope."
wholesomememes,ff2bec7,t1_ff0jfc8,1579499577.0,All my favorite people talk more than me. I enjoy listening. I couldn't be with someone like myself! I appreciate extroverts and those who are good storytellers in my life. It helps bring me out of my shell and parts of myself that are often dormant.
CPTSD,ff2a7b0,t3_dcun6i,1579498428.0,"I think violence with unpredictability can make someone feel very ""present"" and in the moment,  since the body and mind doesnt know what will happen next. You have to be awake in order to stay alive. When you dont know where you'll be hit next, or if someone is trying a new way of hurting you, the body needs to be a bit more present. I know in moments where I have felt, ""This is different. I might actually die today"" the fear felt intense. 

In a ""planned"" or predictable situation where someone knows they will be hurt or how they'll be hurt, the mind and body can try to escape it by dissociating. It's like the body and mind are smart enough to know it can pretend to escape. 

I think it just varies. It is only my own experience, but sometimes I would start off feeling intensely, terrified when i was in those and other situations,  but then as it went on, would basically give up and go limp and let whatever happen, knowing I had no chance anyway."
ptsd,fewvht5,t3_eqp8ys,1579420132.0,"Have you ever used ice? It's a way to calm your body, slowing heart rate and breathing. It's called the mammalian dive reflex. I learned about it in a DBT class.

If you're really struggling, you can hold your breath and put your face in really cold water. It works even if is just an ice pack on your eyes without the water.  It is a physiological way to calm yourself when typical coping skills arent working. Then after that, you can be in a better state of mind to do what you gotta do."
homeless,fewp1lk,t3_eqmlsf,1579417331.0,"The first moments of homelessness are the scariest. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. It is dehumanizing, lonely and traumatic. 

And I promise, there can be hope. 

Are you able to to get on a waitlist for a shelter? Many have programs they can connect you to like job training or even mental health counseling. 

If you're willing to share your location, maybe I can try to find links and resources like temporary shelter, directions for FoodShare, etc. I know that lack of basic needs takes a lot of mental bandwidth so I can help if I able so it is one less step for you. 

It really is an overwhelming experience and I know I cant understand everything,  but I will hold onto hope for you if it feels too hard right now. 

Someone once told me that I dont need to die for life to stop. I can literally just lay really still, sit out in the cold to temporary freeze and pause, and for a moment, life will wait for me a little. Sometimes we just need some rest and we dont have to die for that. 


What does your one friend say to you to help you in tough times? Write it down or look it up when when these thoughts take over. 


I wish you better days and peace. OP. Let me know if I can help search local resources for you. You don't have to be alone."

homeless,feoupg8,t1_feomy0c,1579305845.0,"This is true. Maybe he had a preconception of what ""those"" people are like. We had a lovely conversation until that comment and then he was quiet, I'm guessing maybe he was embarrassed and I was as well.

I was definitely myself, making jokes, being friendly,  etc. And maybe he didnt expect that and it helped changed (even just a little), how he sees the homeless.

So what if it is a stereotype? It is a real issue amongst the homeless, especially the chronically homeless who non profits arent even willing to help. 

Just because it isnt about YOU doesnt mean it is an issue for others who deserve compassion and being seen"
homeless,fekxk6d,t3_eotqu8,1579209677.0,"Episodic homelessness is usually job loss or ""bad luck"" and a situation people fall in unexpectedly,  usually just once. Chronic repetitive  homelessness is often tied to mental health and addiction. It is a reality. It doesnt make it less serious or make homeless people ""bad"". It is just an honest picture and acknowledging that is what needs to be faced to address the issue. 0

These ""but what about ME, I'm hard working and i don't fit the stereotype"" stories bother me. You are no better or worse or more worthy than another homeless person or an addict.  Also, it isnt always about YOU."
