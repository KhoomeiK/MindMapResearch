And a choice excerpt: 
> Most people incorrectly assume that the English colonists gained a different accent in the subsequent years of founding America. Before the American Revolutionary War, British English sounded more like the General American accent of today. Instead, it was the British who gained a ‘British accent.’

Edit: also this
> However, sometime after the American Revolution a major chunk of the upper classes in southern England stopped speaking rhotaically. This emergent accent rapidly became a signifier of sophistication and fine breeding. It was increasingly patronized by teachers of elocution. Emulating the aristocracy, the lower classes (with their aspirations for upward social mobility) began cultivating this non-rhotaic articulation too. Eventually, this posh accent became standardized as ‘Received Pronunciation’ or BBC English. Because of its ‘neutrality’ and ease of understanding, it spread across the rest of Britain. Hence, the modern British accent was born.

It seems it was more about appearing elite in general and not necessarily about the Americans."
therewasanattempt,ffci4r9,t1_ffbnjy2,1579799958.0,I'm pretty sure American English is the original proper English and the Brits changed their accent in order to distinguish themselves from who they saw as the barberous Americans.

The third one is the big one.  It's not just that billionaires are evil or whatever, it's that they *can* pay more.  If you tax someone that's struggling to make ends meet, you take food off their plate one day a week (or make them take out a second mortgage or not go to the doctors for that pain in their abdomen or whatever) but if you tax a billionaire, they can't buy a new yacht this year.  Plus also economically, most of the money that poorer people make goes back into the economy because they spend it, so taxing it takes that out of the economy.
