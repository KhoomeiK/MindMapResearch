POTS,fdpbf97,t3_emhzw8,1578624433.0,"I was diagnosed with epilepsy before the POTS, but was a cheerleader/very athletic otherwise. Then, BAM. One morning I woke up with my heart racing and realized I was too light headed to make it to the kitchen, much less maneuver through an airport that day to go to New Orleans. It was like a switch had just been flipped.

Edit for diagnosis: it happened pretty quickly, and just by chance. I went through 3 weeks of misery. On and off tachycardia, but the low BP was the killer. I thought it was because of my insomnia. I went to an appointment with my neurologist and when he went to standard pulse and BP, he checked and rechecked, had me stand up and sit down, and asked if my heart had been racing, if I was light headed, was I passing out, etc. Why, yes, how did you know? Straight to cardiologist. 24 hour heart monitor and tilt table test later, I was diagnosed. 

I also have ankylosing spondylitis, and inflammatory diseases tend to worsen POTS symptoms, so that’s been fun."

It was a lot. A whole lot. And fucking worth it."
Epilepsy,fdorgir,t3_emb554,1578611235.0,"Welcome to the club, as twisted as that may sound. 

I’ll give you the bad news first. Epilepsy is no walk in the park. It can definitely be frustrating, and just sucks in general.

The good news is that you now have an answer for what’s been plaguing you, and yes, medication does work. You also have a very supportive community that understands the struggle. Don’t ever feel like you can’t lean on it!

It may take a little while to get medication to the right dose for you, and adjustments sometimes have to be made, but a lot of epileptics lead normal lives with proper treatment.

There will be ups and downs, but having an answer and being able to treat your seizures properly will get you back to a normal way of life. Good luck and best wishes!"
