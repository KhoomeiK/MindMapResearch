cats,fe6v7dz,t1_fe5pimk,1578906002.0,I‚Äôm so pleased to hear that! We were told that one was a girl but I realised when we picked them up that he was a boy. We honestly wouldn‚Äôt care either way boy or girl but I did wonder how they would get on with each other as time goes by. That worry is now gone as I‚Äôve seen how happy they are together.

PrettyLittleLiars,fbtv6v2,t3_eecodi,1577097626.0,"Completely agree, can‚Äôt stand them. Ezra is awful, his relationship with Alison that he kept a secret, him knowing that Arya was a school girl and using her for the book. The story was boring too when she went back to him."
