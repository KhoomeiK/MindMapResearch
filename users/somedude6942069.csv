socialanxiety,fef3nw7,t3_eoqdc8,1579047416.0,"I feel the opposite . I don't talk and I'm really quiet , but because I'm so anxious about what I say , I tend to only speak if I'm extremely sure I'm saying the right thing . If I was a more talkative person I feel like people wouldnt think I'm as smart as they would have thought"

What's weird was I actually unplugged replugged like over 5 times before and it never worked, and I feel like I made sure it was tight too.

AskMen,fbrspyw,t3_ee9nlq,1577045946.0,I have social anxiety and I'm really quiet around everyone . I tend to go out of my way to be able to interact with her more like if I know she's going to the cafeteria at a certain time I try and time it so we both get to be there lol. I think I tend to be even shyer around her than normal people.  Also I think I stare at her a lot when I think she's not looking. Everyone's different and you should try and see if he acts differently around you than other people. There's no way to no for sure than to just ask
