kundalini,ff9p11e,t1_ff9gob9,1579717684.0,"Thank you for sharing your experience. May I ask, how long did you take the benzos? And about how long did it take after quitting for the symptoms to subside? It‚Äôs very reassuring to read that they subsided for you. Do you feel like you fully recovered since then? Did you find that the kundalini process still worked for you after recovery? Sorry for all the questions, it‚Äôs just really great to talk to someone with direct experience in this regard."
kundalini,ff931o3,t1_ff92qop,1579703624.0,"Thanks, I appreciate this."
kundalini,ff8w980,t1_ff8fky3,1579698175.0,Could you elaborate more on your personal experience with benzos and kundalini?
kundalini,ff7hynp,t1_ff7hj5k,1579649976.0,"Wow, thank you for all of these resources. I‚Äôll take a look at each of them and give them a shot. üôÇ"
EarthPorn,fdfzvtl,t3_el4gnb,1578375035.0,Why is it called Crested Butte if it‚Äôs a mountain? Is there a butte nearby?
writing,fdfy6g3,t3_el4qna,1578373514.0,"Actually, Hemingway‚Äôs short stories seem to have this repetition too, except he manages it expertly so that it isn‚Äôt noticeable. I think this kind of repetition is inevitable for 3rd person OBJECTIVE POV rather than 3rd person omniscient or 3rd person limited. It‚Äôs an unconventional narrative style, but Hemingway does it really well in his short stories it seems.

writing,fdfnkt9,t1_fdfnft5,1578365834.0,"It‚Äôs a bit harder for me when there are specific actions I want to describe. Like, your version of my example flows way better, but it also excludes some of the actions I specified. And it describes the setting well, but what if I‚Äôd already described the setting in an earlier paragraph?"
writing,fdfnft5,t1_fdfmomi,1578365743.0,"I drew open the door and there stood my mom, wearing her usual pink apron and stirring ingredients in a bowl. 

‚ÄúHey mom, could I have a sandwich?‚Äù

The sound of my voice caught her by surprise. ‚ÄúOh! Uh, yeah, sure. One moment.‚Äù

She washed off the batter from her hands and opened the fridge to make a sandwich. 

‚ÄúHere you go, honey,‚Äù she said when she was done. I smiled and walked back to my room. My friends were waiting for me to return to the online game that we played together every evening ‚Äî I couldn‚Äôt wait to kick their asses!

writing,fdfll3g,t1_fdfl7f5,1578364529.0,"I‚Äôd need to see an example. The scene has pretty much been set, so I‚Äôm not sure how to add more description without adding unnecessary filler. As for reflections and thought processes, those are sometimes shown BY character actions and adding it can be somewhat on the nose or redundant sometimes. Like I said, I‚Äôd need to see an example to see how it could be done better. I recognize that the example I provided is problematic, but I don‚Äôt know what a better version would look like."
depression,fcwu5km,t1_fcwtzyd,1578037739.0,Thanks. This was a really nice comment and it made me smile ‚ù§Ô∏èüôÇ
depression,fcwrs45,t1_fcvmeok,1578035015.0,"I appreciate you writing this. To be honest, I wasn‚Äôt suggesting that anyone do anything. I live far away from nature and I‚Äôm literally just wondering if that would help. My comment was about me, not about him. I just wanted to know if he lived near nature or not because I can relate to his despair and want to know if having access to beautiful and grand scenery dampens the pain. If he had said yes, I would‚Äôve been disappointed because that would mean that it doesn‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs currently my only hope, that one day I might find some solace in nature in a Henry David Thoreau kind of way. So this was a big misunderstanding. That happens to me a lot. I always say things with one intention and they get interpreted a totally different way. I have terrible social anxiety because miscommunications, misunderstandings, and misjudgments happen to me constantly in the dumbest of ways. Plus, people stick to their guns about their original assumptions and judgements, so when I clarify, I feel like it‚Äôs an uphill battle. I know it‚Äôs my fault for not being self aware about how my particular phrasing might get misconstrued, but I also know it‚Äôs not my fault, because that‚Äôs not something I can fully control. Anyway"

depression,fcv5s10,t1_fcuja2t,1577995225.0,"Do you live somewhere near nature? Near trees or a natural water source? Or a place with a mild, warm climate? Do you get to see the sun rise and set from where you live? Or get a good view of the stars? My hope is having access to at least a few of these things will counterbalance the pain when this happens. This has happened all my life too, but I‚Äôve been fairly disconnected from nature where I live. Right now I‚Äôm wondering if nature is the key to finding happiness in a life where we have no hope for happiness from other people. It‚Äôs good you can have dogs where you live."

communism,fcp68bo,t1_fcp556p,1577851816.0,"I love his diagnosis here. See my most recent comment; I point out some similar concerns regarding measuring the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of a person. However, I don‚Äôt see a solution proposed in his analysis, just a diagnosis of the problem. It still raises the question, who would live in the nice areas (like warm woodland environments near natural water sources) and who would live in the less desirable areas, and how would one upgrade if one so desired?"
communism,fcp5sqf,t1_fcp4su4,1577851397.0,"I see. I guess I was asking about the general case, not just in Russia. I‚Äôm not sure a lot of that applies to America and warmer countries. I‚Äôm just wondering how those inequalities would be addressed in general. I like the idea of voluntarily trading homes with people or searching for vacancies, but it seems likely to me that most people would not want to trade the better homes, locations, and climates in exchange for less desirable ones, which means there would be people who have less. I guess how those more desirable units are distributed would depend on how much a person contributes to society, but that comes with certain injustices. How would we determine a person‚Äôs ‚Äúvalue‚Äù fairly? Especially as more and more of human labor becomes automated. 

Converting mansions to museums is a good idea. That would address the extreme cases of house inequality, but there would still be significant differences in quality simply due to geological and ecological reasons. Speaking personally, I really want to live in an area surrounded by nature some day, ideally with a mild climate that remains fairly warm year round and near a natural water source. How would someone fulfill such a hope in this system? Even if a vacancy opened, there would be a lot of competition for it I imagine. 

Also, just to be clear, I am merely inquiring. None of this is a criticism or disagreement."
communism,fcp1jzz,t1_fcp13q7,1577847641.0,"I‚Äôm not criticizing communism, I‚Äôm just curious how houses would get distributed. I agree that developed societies today could build houses for everyone, but there would still be inequalities since some homes are mansions and some are crammed apartments. Even if all existing buildings were burned down (something I would not endorse) and rebuilt to be equal, there would still be more desirable locations and climates. Who would get to live in, for example, a woodland area with natural water sources and a mild climate vs. who would live in a very arid extreme climate with little greenery or vegetation? Seems like there are certain inequalities that are inevitable."
