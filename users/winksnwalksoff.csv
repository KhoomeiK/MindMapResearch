AskMen,fdn0s4m,t3_elwlva,1578573728.0,"My sons father had his first child at 13 years old. His babysitter took his virginity when he was 11 and she was 16 and got pregnant when he was 12. He told me he was so scared when she told him she was pregnant. He would look out the window when she was walking home from school to see if her belly was getting any bigger. As soon as he turned 18 the girls mom had her put him on child support. My sons father is now a sex addict(why we are not together) he will spend his whole paycheck on taking girls out and buying them drinks. Now that we are not together and I can look at the situation objectively, it’s really fucking sad. Men go through ALOT of shit that we never hear about because society tells them to “just suck it up” or “don’t be a little bitch about it”. Usually it’s the men that suffer abuse at a young age that end up being sexual deviants. For example R.kelly was molested as a child. That’s not an excuse for what HE did but it is something we should think about. I don’t trust people with my son just as I would if I had a daughter."

Now he is shouting Trump 2020 and watching fox news(he used to watch nbc). It made me lose a lot of respect for him, I never thought he was a sheep. I’m just glad a republican is finally throwing his hands up for once. The only argument against impeachment the GOP has had this far is the lack of bi-partisan support.

Maybe they feel that you have been through a lot and that is why they are trying to be positive. Now we dont know the whole story but just from reading what you have wrote.

I’m sorry that you are having so many medical problems and you cannot find solutions, I’m sure that it is frustrating but I think you might be right about it being you.

Your maturity will make others, who are not mature or self aware, feel insecure. That is NOT your problem. Please do not feel that you have to dim your light or sink to anyone else’s level for acceptance.
