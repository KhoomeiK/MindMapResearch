Instrumental music classes in middle school and then band & band council throughout high school were incredibly important to my daughter's success at school.

Stay strong and warm."

rant,ff57vrz,t3_ermwbu,1579582820.0,"Living in Canada, I fully understand my taxes are paying for me and other people to get free health care. If my taxes are paying for a stranger to receive heart surgery, a transplant, an abortion, whatever, its not my fucking business, as long as its available when I need it. There are refugees and immigrants who qualify for the same healthcare as I do, and that's okay too.

I think the hangup for many Americans is they morally object to a medical procedure so they don't want their taxes to pay for it, not for themselves or anyone else.  I find the American obsession with women's reproductive rights fucking insane.

Vote for change."

If you went to that event wearing something that made you feel beautiful, she would insult your appearance and try to embarrass you in front of others.  Plan something enjoyable for yourself that day, do some baking, go for a manicure, see a movie with a friend."

Your landlord is an idiot if he hasn't realized how much more electricity and water is being used by the tamale tenants. Not to mention the cost of pest control. Let the landlord know that since the cost of electricity isn't a concern, you're prepared to plug in an industrial fan 24/7."

AmItheAsshole,fc9wybu,t3_eggx3b,1577559422.0,"NTA. I've been there, its happened consistently for 27 years. Now that you know, just plan for it.

I ordered a purse from Zulily and it arrived on the 24th. I happily used it on Boxing Day when we gathered at my SIL's home. She had my name in the gift exchange this year.  She has always shopped for me and another SIL at the grocery store, cause who doesn't like Glade candles. I knew that whatever she picked, it would be a thoughtless throwaway gift and I was right. This year it was a cheap version of a hooded blanket and she knows damn well I'm menopausal and constantly hot. 

I love my new purse and the dog loves her new blanket."
