todayilearned,fek79z5,t3_epkvqc,1579194083.0,"Congratulations. You've successfully condensed one facet of a giant study to be misleading against both the authors' intent and the generally understood facts of beef production.

1. The study only concerned itself with the water produced and used at the farms, but DID NOT INCLUDE water used in the production of feed or other associated needs.  That is a massive amount and should not be ignored by consumers. 

2. The study also excluded ANY OTHER environmental factors, such as waste water runoff.  Waste water has a HUGE impact on the surrounding areas. 

3. The study did not even attempt to get into the environmental impacts of removing hundreds of thousands of acres of rainforest in order to raise said cattle. Nor does it get into the impacts and costs of shipping beef from rainforest regions to your local Mickey D's. How gas efficient do YOU think these cargo vessels are? How much pollution do they release? It's not in this study. (It's not supposed to be.)

Simply put, this study does not contradict others and instead focuses entirely on the water cycle and use at the farms themselves. As scientists, they limited variables to exclude things we, as consumers, should be constantly aware of. 

(Disclosure: I'm a former vegan turned back to meat, but trying to be as conscientious as I can. I am NOT going to argue for or against plant-based diets. That's for you to decide for yourselves. I just don't want bad facts and talking points making that decision for you.)"
