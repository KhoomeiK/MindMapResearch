If you wanted a friend status to maybe move into relationship status, you probably did the right thing here.  Taking a step back to examine the situation more closely is never wrong.  

You need to be more forthright in the future and you need to clarify her intentions as well.

Maybe she didn’t realize she was being flirty with you, harmless office flirting is a thing; we all like to feel attractive."

Your friends are also within acceptable parameters to be concerned that you’re too picky.  They don’t want to see you unhappy because of 20+ minutes.  Potentially, this was a problem you could have worked through as a couple of it wasn’t a due to a major life event.

AmItheAsshole,fcckahp,t1_fc9ysl7,1577599373.0,"This section in here is where most of my thoughts are mirrored.  You and your husband taking time to get to know her may increase the longevity of the relationship.  My mom has taken time for my girlfriend I’ve been dating for about 8 months.  Mom asked me to inquire about what she likes, she ended up getting a gift card for some nicer makeup.  

Both your son and her will notice the effort you put into their life.  Even if they break up tomorrow, being good to the partners in your son’s life will help endear you to him and them.  

A good idea, that’s not terribly expensive, is to have food delivered to them.  My mom got us dinner one night despite us being most of the US apart.  We were both sick and she made our day.  Grand gestures are good, but the little moments are what we think about before we fall asleep."

People who are wired different to anyone they normally deal with confuse and make them anxious.  And in general, I would hope people invite you to events not out of pity, but because they like having you around.

Be patient with them the same way you need them to be patient with you.  If you refuse to go out, even politely enough, they won’t invite you anymore.  If you want people to understand you, please be big enough to meet them halfway.  No one makes it out alive, but we all have to live together. 

You’re trying to combat generationally learned habits and thoughts by complaining on the internet in an angry equivalent to “you just don’t get me, man.”  You need to educated the people you care about.  If they can’t understand after the first time, just be patient.  The ones who really care will come around. 

Good luck, I believe in you."

AmItheAsshole,fc11ksn,t3_efg9t8,1577305636.0,"NAH - I’m not going to jump on the bandwagon, I think there’s more here than a need for validation.  

First, you are not wrong to be hurt by someone else’s actions.  Your feelings are your feelings. 

Second, communication seems to be lacking in this relationship.  If you were stung by his gift last year not being wrapped properly, you should have told him.  I know some people don’t care about wrapping gifts.  So he tried last minute when he saw it was an issue.  

The hard medicine here is you need to talk to him and express why your feelings are hurt.  I can promise you, he’s not the only one who knows about your anger problems.  I’m willing to bet he’s trying to tell you something as politely as he can.  

Now, I don’t think it should have been his only gift to you.  He should have given it to you alone and given you a better gift in front of company. 

Life is hard and no one makes it out alive.  But occasionally we find some happiness, someone who makes us smile far more often than not, I think trying to work out recoverable issues is far better than trying to be right."
