DBS_CardGame,feyl32t,t3_eqx7rk,1579447019.0,"The only thing that matters when constructing a deck for the first time is color identity. The theme of the characters doesn't usually matter as long as you can pay the cost to play them.

Example: I run a deck known as Traitor Dende. Dende is my leader, but all the cards in my deck revolve around summoning Frieza. The only thing my cards have in common is that they're mostly yellow."
