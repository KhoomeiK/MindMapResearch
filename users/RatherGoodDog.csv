90% of the improvements are common sense shit, like reorganising the workstations to have the most commonly used items close to hand (in clearly labelled containers), or clearing out the storeroom of anything we haven't touched in 6 months or more.

A lot of the improvements were things the workers had been wanting for months but didn't think management would agree to change. Slapping ""5S"" on the idea suddenly makes it palatable.

The rest of my time on the project was just documenting what you've done in a LSS/5S manner and justifying to your line manager why you aren't doing ""real"" work."

geopolitics,fc71p9r,t1_fc6xj3j,1577495186.0,"I think it's a hedge against future US ABM plans which Russia believes (rightly or not) to be coming. So they're deploying this proactively in order to maintain continuity in their second strike capability, rather than reacting to a future ABM development which will leave them vulnerable until they have time to develop a counter.

We've seen this happen before in arms races. Maybe the US is not planning a comprehensive ABM system, but Russia may think they are. THAAD and SM-3 have quite upset the Kremlin - we know that - and they may believe further development/rollout is coming. Think back to how the MiG-25's amazing (but actually fictitious) capabilities as an air superiority fighter spurred the development of the enormously potent F-15 to match it. Turned out the MiG-25 was not an air superiority fighter at all, but by the time that was realised, the F-15 had been built and it was damned well going to be put to good use.

I don't think Russia wants to wait and find out if anti-ICBM defenses become a reality. I think they've thrown a bunch of money at these exotic nuclear programs (Poseidon, HGVs, Burevestnik etc) preemptively, as the development cycles are so long they don't want to wait and see IF their current ICBMs are made obsolete, but rather by deploying new systems ensure that it won't matter.

I don't think it alters MAD, I think it's to maintain MAD into the future. It's not fundamentally destabilising, but a logical step by a concerned actor."
