FlashTV,fepdexm,t1_feov903,1579317772.0,"Lucifer was in Vertigo until recently, but God or The Presence has been in the DC multiverse and never stated whether there was one or more than one, though the fact that there's only one Darkseid makes me think it's the same for the abrahamic god."

dresdenfiles,fe6ldc5,t1_fe6l2fv,1578894771.0,"Yeah, but if I'm asleep, I'm not making any bad deals. Physical harm is the only harm I can suffer when asleep (exceptions apply, mostly covered in grave peril) because I'm not able to be tempted into a deal when I'm snoring."
dresdenfiles,fe6l6qt,t1_fe6kgzv,1578894582.0,"Does it stay pulpy with baby teeth that fall out naturally? I honestly don't know. I remember my baby teeth being dry and hollow when they fell out. They were just empty shells and only bled when yanked or knocked out early.  Besides,  I imagine a tooth fairy eating the teeth. Otherwise, they'd have to leave something as valuable as control of a child behind."

If Binder can cut his hair and jump in a river to cut a link, a tooth that has already been replaced won't do diddly."

blackmagicfuckery,fe6he2t,t1_fe3i662,1578890962.0,That's the magician's alliance. The Magic Circle is a club in the UK that acts similarly but less over the top.
blackmagicfuckery,fe6ha9r,t1_fe2yp1r,1578890869.0,"Magic is all showmanship. The trick is immaterial. You can literally do gypsy thread on stage *without any thread* and get applause. I don't care if you're doing literal wizardry that defies physics - if there isn't entertaining, it's not worth calling magic."

Not all fae are evil, but none should be trusted beyond their nature. Trade tooth for coin, only while asleep when I can't be tricked into a deal."

dresdenfiles,fbzhvwn,t1_fbzbhf3,1577247235.0,"Understand why forgiveness of warlocks is so dangerous, but the council isn't addressing the core issue of finding magically talented kids before they slip into a hole they never knew to look for and warning them, training them, and teaching them. They're not doing so because their numbers are too few. Their standards for admittance are too high. They're letting their love of secrets prevent them from reaching out to those who may have talent.

The dangers a dark wizard poses are no joke and death is really the safest way for the world, but the paranet could have been started by the council centuries before Harry and Elaine. Elitism and secrecy prevented it. Let the folks with little talent help find potential wizards. Protect them under the accords. Help your fellow man avoid breaking the laws before dark magic can corrupt them."
dresdenfiles,fbxtse2,t1_fbxjaoy,1577200310.0,"Having wardens is the worst part of the council's laziness and elitism. Let's have everyone able to use combat magic as our only line of defense unless they're senior council. Oh, and as a result of our incredibly high standards as to who can join our ranks, warlocks have practically no chance in hell of being found and trained to control their powers before their power has the opportunity to warp their minds beyond repair. And because of that and half of the council's preference to experiment or travel rather than show up to meetings, we're so understaffed from the members we could have that we can't get anything done to change things, so young magic users usually need to be executed for the safety of others. And our drafted magic army has to do it. Fuck, being a warden sucks."
