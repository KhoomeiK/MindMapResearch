AmItheAsshole,ff0d8io,t1_fezb7g9,1579467799.0,You can also get shingles if you’ve had the chicken pox vaccine but it’s incredibly rare and usually only happens if you are somehow immune compromised.
AmItheAsshole,fey2180,t1_fexmur3,1579439702.0,I think at 13 her only concept of consequences and boundaries had been taught to her by her abusive parents.
AskReddit,feu9fro,t1_fes73at,1579384427.0,"We’re also now beginning to fully recognize autism as a spectrum. Whereas before high-functioning autistic children were just “weird kids” and the lowest functioning were classified as “mentally retarded.”

So we have this phenomena where it looks like autism is increasing when in reality diagnosing autism is getting better."
AskReddit,feu2423,t1_feu0y93,1579382379.0,I think my circulation is so bad I’ve just gotten used to cold extremities lol.
AskReddit,feu0bsp,t1_fetyuye,1579381849.0,"Nah. If my core is warm, I am warm and it’s not like I’m spending extended periods of time outside."
AskReddit,fetxqpi,t1_fet6j9n,1579381078.0,That’s my “It’s cold outside but socks look stupid with these loafers and I got to go business casual for work” look
AskReddit,fetub2d,t1_fetrb1d,1579380154.0,"Oh wow. You give me too much credit.  I have definitely seen both The Hosts (and prefer the Bong Joon Ho’s) but thought OP was referring to the one I commented about. 

I stand by it being the best adaptation I’ve ever seen though (regardless of the quality of the source material lol). I was wondering why they liked it more than Cloverfield 😂"
AskReddit,fetpjir,t1_fergsro,1579378036.0,"It’s based off a book written my Stephanie Meyer (Same author as the Twilight series).   The Host is much better than Twilight lol.

When people talk about what the best movie adaptation of a book is I always mention The Host. Probably the best one I’ve ever seen in regards to staying true to the source material."
AskReddit,fetohgy,t1_fet8csn,1579377623.0,That movie surprised me and I’m glad I went in blind. Lol
AmItheAsshole,fek6qty,t1_fejbdi2,1579193769.0,I missed that his *wife* left without him the first time until I saw it mentioned in the comments. It really does make this post legendary.
stevenuniverse,fejvv24,t1_feih6ia,1579187040.0,Stand directly behind the dude (angle the camera where you can see his legs between yours) and then throw over his head. Takes a couple of times to get the angle right every time but it works.
AskReddit,feh3f63,t1_feh0p6o,1579108334.0,Where does the “commercial archeologists are evil” come from then? (Not that I’ve ever heard it myself but that’s what the original comment implied). I could definitely see a sort of ivory tower superiority from what you just described.
AmItheAsshole,fegsp37,t1_feg980g,1579101642.0,"I agree completely. Although, as a woman, I got more peeved off at OP’s actions than his girlfriend’s.  I think it just hit a nerve for me.  

I think it’s worth considering that she felt unsafe and lashed out.  It’s easier to blame germs than explain her history and experience with homeless men making her feel unsafe. 

She’s totally still an asshole in this situation, though.  I just felt my stomach drop when OP explained what he did. Due to my own experiences, I may have also acted like an ass as well if my boyfriend did that."
relationships,fegpmmn,t1_fegj4fm,1579099548.0,"And you go to the gym and are building muscle now so your weight on the scale is less important. 

When I went to the gym religiously and was cutting back calories to lose weight I got down to almost 130 and realized that it was not going to be feasible to maintain (I’m 5’5”).  I didn’t feel restricting like I was was actually healthy long term and I was slowly creeping back up as I built muscle.

Everyone’s bodies are different and put on muscle/fat differently. Please don’t listen to people who say “I’m x height and y pounds so you have no excuse.” That’s just ignorance talking."
AskReddit,fegl8oe,t1_fegkmla,1579096241.0,I imagine there is a bit of pressure to *not* find any artifacts. Maybe that’s why the professors expressed disdain for that job.
AmItheAsshole,fedw7b7,t1_fedjm2c,1579021186.0,"It’s called compassion fatigue and it happens even when the person you’re caring for isn’t a complete asshat. It doesn’t mean you’re a bad person. It means your brain has realized that you can’t keep spreading yourself this thin and has shut down your empathy in a last ditch effort to get some self-care.

You need boundaries like yesterday. I say this as a person who is just like you. I don’t always know when to say no and feel so guilty when I have to.

He’s not going to get better if he’s shielded from all the consequences of his shitty behavior. You’re enabling him."
AmItheAsshole,fe8ldqk,t1_fe8l29b,1578927499.0,I’ve seen the dolphin one too! No hate. I love those mailboxes lol
AmItheAsshole,fe89ldx,t1_fe7rk1o,1578923995.0,"I saw this really big concrete manatee one once that was really well made but the weirdest thing ever. The manatee was holding the mailbox in its flippers and it was practically life-size. 

OP should look into that lol"
AmItheAsshole,fe698to,t1_fe4edbt,1578884592.0,"Yeah I don’t understand these comments that are fixating on the Jesus birthday. Like, we know it’s not really his birthday.  It’s a holiday even in the secular world, though, and it’s going to overshadow OPs birthday regardless.

I think the girlfriend was more frustrated he missed her point."
AmItheAsshole,fe687qz,t1_fe5upx2,1578883933.0,"Can confirm. Every time I’ve been to church on Sunday it’s, like, all they talk about."
AmItheAsshole,fe647tu,t1_fe60vzu,1578881418.0,"It’s not about animal cruelty as much as it is about the local wildlife honestly. I’m in vet school and did my Masters with a bit of a wildlife focus and that was the biggest talking point when discussing feral cat populations. They absolutely decimate our native songbirds. 

My cat is pretty strictly indoors because he’s declawed (not by me) and there’s a giant ass hawk that lives in our backyard. We walk around with him outside supervised because so many small pets have gone missing in our neighborhood from wildlife.  Also knowing all the parasites out there that cats get in my region is terrifying. Lol

However, OPs cat should 100% be let outside if she has that much anxiety staying inside. Any vet would say the same thing, especially if she exhausted all other options."
AskReddit,fdoev63,t1_fdocp0t,1578603798.0,This is amazing.

TrueOffMyChest,fdnlfit,t3_em03tj,1578588255.0,"I like how OP is almost like a title you get when you’re brave enough to make a post yourself. 

Great job, OP!"
AskReddit,fdnk5db,t1_fdnc0i6,1578587494.0,Omg is that a real clinical sign or did you just make that up? Lol
AskReddit,fdn53sm,t1_fdn0h49,1578577530.0,My favorite is “Acute onset death”
tippytaps,fdl75zy,t1_fdl4zfo,1578518193.0,Yeah someone else explained that I was thinking of a peak milk production model and not actual production. That’s the reason they breed dairy cattle yearly—to keep production at a peak profitable level.
tippytaps,fdkf059,t1_fdk5iyh,1578502470.0,"As a vet student we of course have a lot of compassion for all animals and we’ve taken the Hippocratic oath to do no harm. But we’re also human and our education has a big emphasis on public health.  It’s honestly difficult to know the right thing sometimes in these issues and often vets disagree with one another.  This isn’t isolated to just the food industry, but pet breeders, shelters, feral populations of animals, etc.

We take a loooot of ethics courses. Lol"
tippytaps,fdk4yg7,t1_fdk4f4s,1578496160.0,"Dude, you’re right. I’ve had lactation curves and insemination protocols beaten into my brain all last semester from Reproduction class (vet student here) I forgot about basic physiology taught in my first year. Lol"
tippytaps,fdjy3lo,t1_fdjvjku,1578491110.0,You’re almost right but they do need to get pregnant every year to keep producing milk. They will stop producing eventually.
AmItheAsshole,fdiza7l,t1_fdiu5yt,1578454496.0,I assume these girls wear similar things when they have lazy days too. I’m not one of these girls so I’m not sure what they do in the privacy of their own homes...
AmItheAsshole,fdic6hf,t1_fdi8ul3,1578439604.0,Damn these sexy college kids.
AmItheAsshole,fdi4f1i,t1_fdhs7x7,1578435542.0,"It’s not really that it’s sexy but super comfy. I see sorority girls wear this and usually they have Nike shorts underneath with their oversized sorority shirts on top. Once you realize that like 90% of weird college looks are based on comfort (like socks and Birkenstock’s/chacos, Uggs boots, etc) it makes more sense."
bestoflegaladvice,fdeg2l3,t1_fdedcsl,1578338252.0,This is the best explanation I’ve heard but it still has so many logical flaws in the cop’s part. We’ve got to be missing something here...
AmItheAsshole,fdb0rhi,t1_fdajvfe,1578252408.0,There are people from my past that I don’t interact with anymore.  I don’t harbor any ill will but if they started criticizing me at a get together I wouldn’t hesitate to defend myself and remind them why I don’t associate with them.  I don’t consider that a grudge.
tumblr,fdaygy7,t1_fdavm7a,1578251793.0,"Yeah sorry. When I was reading the comments I assumed you were replying as if “oh, yeah they have that rule in the US too but no one enforces it” instead of “yeah, they have that rule in the UK but it’s not like it’s enforced”

We have that rule here in the US too in most places and it is very much enforced where I live. Actually now that I think of it most supermarkets have a “card if they look under 40” rule."
tumblr,fdav7o6,t1_fda8s3c,1578250630.0,Really? I get carded all the time and I’m in my mid twenties. Maybe it’s just the Bible Belt. Lol
LifeProTips,fd4dq6u,t1_fd4ay2t,1578166669.0,"Yeah they said on the podcast that it got the “rapid eye movement” name in the eighties when they were trying to obscure its roots in mindfulness (which was seen as sort of not real science back then). 

The lady they interviewed didn’t do the eye-movement in her therapy. She utilized a repetitive sound instead while she was reprocessing. 

It sounds super cool and I’m glad it worked for you!"
LifeProTips,fd4ccq8,t1_fd49h5v,1578166346.0,"It was I, Survivor by Wondery. It was the one about the plane crash. Like in the first few episodes."
LifeProTips,fd3yjqx,t1_fd3ltcq,1578162775.0,"This is pretty cool. I listened to a podcast recently where they talked about eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. From my limited knowledge of psychology it reminded me of CBT but on subconscious level. 

The human brain is crazy!"
confession,fd32b1y,t1_fd2i2mz,1578154090.0,"You’re at that age where you still have a bit of innate trust in adults and lots of self-doubt. This is totally normal and isn’t because you’re “immature.”  

You’re going to look back in ten years and go “Holy crap. Why the hell did I think any of that was even a little acceptable?”  I remember being your age and knowing that some things weren’t right but kind of shrugging it off because it’s “not that bad.”  In retrospect (now in my mid twenties) I realize my feelings were 10000% justified."
needadvice,fcyjp0a,t3_ejaxm7,1578081209.0,"I get sterile UTIs frequently.  What I usually do is take some of those AZO tablets for urinary pain and drink tons of water until my bladder settles down.  Cranberry tablets are also good and I found this cranberry detox tea that always makes me feel better.  Warm compresses on her nether regions can help with the discomfort and urgency.

Those AZO tablets kinda make me feel crappy (headaches, nausea) so I usually only take one a day and only if the pain is affecting me off the toilet as well.  

If she's got what I often get (as evidenced by the doctor and lack of nitrates) antibiotics will actually do more harm than good.  I also tend to get yeast infections right after these bladder ""infections"" unfortunately so keep an eye out for that as well."
relationship_advice,fcmxg6m,t1_fcmoqgm,1577796534.0,Go to the mall and get her some of those glasses that have 2020 on them  (the zeroes are eyes).  That way you can take cute pictures with her and make up for the missed Xmas photo op.
