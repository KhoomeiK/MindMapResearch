insanepeoplefacebook,fc0xzrj,t1_fc0vtsj,1577302725.0,"There's a lot of factors that could cause it such as how you were raised--whether you were surrounded by more male figures than female figures. There's no evidence of a 'gay gene' but there is evidence of the brain rewiring its self to account for its living conditions.

Personally I think it's a good thing that we're more than just a bunch of genetic code determining every action we do. I also don't see why we need a 'born this way' rhetoric to find acceptance for our actions if we're not harming anyone."
insanepeoplefacebook,fc0uvt8,t3_efj1gn,1577300248.0,you're not really born gay. You just acquire experiences in early in life which determines your sexual orientation. You can't really choose these experiences so it's still not a choice none the less. Global warming is a phenomenon of nature where the atmosphere traps heat radiating from earths surface resulting in climate change. The evidence is all there these people are just to busy trying to be witty than to use the thing at their fingertips to do any research
