Have you been to the Visionary Art Museum? (It’s not free though ☹️) I like going to their Kinetic Sculpture Race every spring."

Now I see I’m just spoiled 😬"

NoStupidQuestions,fe6hsew,t3_envuaa,1578891315.0,"I wish someone had shared Janet Lansbury’s blog/podcast with me (https://www.janetlansbury.com/). She helped me figure out a script for the inevitable baby/kid struggles and helped me see my son in a way that I can be more patient with him.

He’s not trying to drive me crazy (even though he does), he’s just having a hard time communicating and is looking for more one on one time with his favorite people, without us being distracted by phones/tv. When he gets that time with us, everything is easier."
exchristian,fdzx8hi,t3_enfpmz,1578798010.0,"Even at 31 now and being out of the church for many years, I still have a hard time relating to people my age. We were doing such different things growing up, we have no “common thread”. I wish I had an ex-Christian friend in real life and we could bond over our similar history the way other people do."
NoStupidQuestions,fdvvhux,t3_en4hm1,1578751983.0,"As a mother, I would be absolutely heartbroken if I found out my child passed up on an opportunity for my sake. I would never ever get over that guilt.

Please trust that your mom knows what she's doing and would love nothing more than to go on this trip with the person she loves the most."

exchristian,fdpthjm,t1_fdpe4ny,1578639844.0,"Right, I always thought it made sense that Pharaoh was being stubborn, when they come at him with plagues and murder.

And I never understood how this was fair: 
Exodus 9:12 “But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said to Moses.” Lol excuse me, WHAT!?!?"

They’re super flexible, they’ve been great.

BenignExistence,fc2tsf5,t1_fby2xon,1577373825.0,"I guess by friend energy I mean checking in to ask how they are, planning hangouts I think they’d be into, just sending a fun text to attempt to brighten their work week or maybe it’s just giving them time away from me if they just need to relax. I don’t tend to vent to them until I know we’re actually close friends. I really try to make sure the relationship is “even”, like make sure I’m not talking too much about myself or not asking them any questions, but also the other way around, if they’re not asking about me/interested in my life, then I think it’s time to walk away. 

I’m sorry that happened with your friend. I’ve been in that situation too, on both sides, and it hurts either way."
CasualConversation,fc2t088,t1_fbxts0u,1577373177.0,That’ll be a nice new beginning.

BenignExistence,fbx6ngp,t1_fbwyivj,1577171677.0,"Lots of tears, honestly. I didn’t cope with it very well. 
I am married now and my husband is absolutely a close friend, but it’s just different than having someone you can count on outside your family, if you know what I’m trying to say. 

But in 2017, I was reviewing my year (https://yearcompass.com/) and setting goals for 2018 and I specifically wrote that I wanted to get closer to my now friend. I just put all of my friend energy into our relationship and luckily we really clicked, so much so that I ended up marrying her and her husband last year...I don’t know how to write that without it sounding like I’m married to them, haha! Officiated their wedding, there we go :)

Is there something you’re trying to help you cope?"
CasualConversation,fbwgbi1,t1_fbwftfl,1577149172.0,"I agree. I know I’d be spending all my time just going over every scenario, instead of enjoying the holiday. I hope they eventually answer you.

Are you celebrating with any family?"
