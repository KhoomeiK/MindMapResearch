bulletjournal,fekihae,t3_epn7qi,1579200734.0,Oh great. Now I won’t be able to listen to The Beatles “Strawberry Fields Forever” without laughing. LOL
bulletjournal,fejodh0,t3_epgvwy,1579181550.0,Make it a doodle section. Or “next week” and “next month” sections if you have big events or plans coming up soon.
bulletjournal,fdlog28,t3_em18n1,1578528682.0,I use it to get my thoughts down on paper. It frees up a little bit of mental energy knowing that I no longer have to remember that one thing. I write down things that I might want to remember someday. For example: “BLT Mac & Cheese at lunch was amazing!” (helps with picking food choices later) or “My dog had a really bad night after that medication” (helps me remember to tell the vet that my dog shouldn’t have that medication again).
bulletjournal,fdl9okk,t1_fdl7ken,1578519426.0,Good point. Didn’t think of that.
bulletjournal,fdl73gi,t3_elylvb,1578518158.0,"Let’s also include apologizing for your English if it’s not your native language. Reddit is global. Not everyone speaks English, and that’s great! Even if it’s broken English, most of us still know what you mean. In fact, most who apologize for their English speak better English than native speakers."
bulletjournal,fdgxbfc,t3_elb4pl,1578410621.0,I like this! The middle of the month seems to get you down a lot. Looks like a great way to recognize patterns.
bulletjournal,fdgwrcj,t3_elaond,1578410235.0,"To the ones commenting about too much sex, I’d have sex every day or twice per day if I could. And I’m female. No shame here! Having sex as a consenting adult is normal, natural, and your choice. Don’t ever let anyone make you feel the amount of sex you have or don’t have is shameful."
bulletjournal,fdew1ap,t3_el0liu,1578347777.0,"After the months you do have, add in May. Use a funny joke about it. “‘May’ I ask what you’re doing way over here?” Then you can laugh about it!"
bulletjournal,fdbz7qt,t3_ekgm5h,1578264148.0,Noodley Mess - I’ve heard some people refer to thinking deeply about something as ‘noodling’ on it.
bulletjournal,fcz5x3m,t3_ejmai7,1578094319.0,That’s a whole mood in itself. 😆
bulletjournal,fcysj8i,t1_fcyj720,1578086150.0,"Sounds like a “just kidding January” now, lol."
bulletjournal,fcxhqyy,t3_ejaga7,1578063234.0,"Decorate the spills on the pages. Make them into little, unique characters for each page or draw arrows with an “oops!” pointing toward the spill. Use it as a way to learn to let go of things. I messed up my journal too, and it bothered me for a while, but I’m learning to let go of things beyond my control. Accidents happen."
bulletjournal,fcxhdzs,t3_ejb0d0,1578062976.0,Just re-letter it and do January as SMTWTFS instead. Quick fix! It looks really good regardless.
bulletjournal,fcnmnjw,t3_ei3ghs,1577814393.0,"Hope your migraine goes away today! Any chance they could also be hormone induced? Mine used to be the week before my period, in addition to stress. Migraines really suck, and I’m sorry that you have so many.

On the plus side, I love the key that you used for this. The dots and lines with the colors really helps!"
bulletjournal,fciezoy,t1_fci697x,1577661541.0,That’s a great idea splitting up the day. I hadn’t thought of that. Best of luck with it. :)
bulletjournal,fcb1ita,t3_egyo3f,1577580891.0,Omg leave it! I love your snake.
bulletjournal,fc79aym,t3_egj97p,1577500944.0,"My only year tracker is a year in pixels to track my moods. I recently started a new antidepressant/anti-anxiety medication, and I want to track daily mood shifts to see if I can recognize patterns.

Something else I might track is workouts, but as of now, I don’t have it planned as a yearly tracker."
bulletjournal,fbya72k,t3_ef3s5v,1577211852.0,How sweet!
bulletjournal,fbvhpb9,t3_eepfbz,1577130958.0,"Great Lakes!!! Mmm, Christmas Ale. ❤️"
