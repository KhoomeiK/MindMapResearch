cats,fdorl0e,t3_em9s6d,1578611315.0,My normally very quiet cat does this too. I have driven her from Washington to North Dakota to New Mexico to  Texas. Idk how I'm still sane. The very first move she got worked up so hard she vomited and shat at the same time! I've learned to transport on an empty stomach and it helps *a little ** to cover the box completely. I've fashioned my own covers out of sheets so she can't see but still good air exchange.
