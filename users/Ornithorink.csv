depression,ff7ka01,t1_ff7ajhn,1579651547.0,"well, somedays I can distract myself from it in other ways, watching stuff, playing games, painting, spending with my girlfriend. But I am still empty most of the time.

I think that beating this state doesn't come without work, but working on it doesn't magically fix it, at least for me.

What has worked for me for the past two days at least is to not think about it at all. Worrying about feeling nothings create expectations, and most of the time our expectations aren't fullfilled because, well, we are empty inside. It then only feeds up our anxiety and cause stress which is well known for causing anhedonia.

I hope everything cause well on your side. One day we will get out of this."

Are you being fucking retarded, do you realize that first of all, there is no fucking way you can tell that. Second of all, you're on a subreddit dedicated to fucking DEPRESSION, do you think any of us would find since funny or even remotely interesting about the state of Reddit?

Either way, looking at your profile, you spend a heck amount of time telling your bullshit on this sub. For someone whose life is so """"""perfect"""""" you must be either a fucking bastard or so affected in depression yourself that your only way to vent out is to be mean to others.

Keep replying, I got all the time in the world, it keeps my shitty life remotely interesting. I like that."
depression,fc59chw,t1_fc58zha,1577449685.0,"caring family that always been here for me
the most beautiful and loyal pets I've ever had
studying in a field that I like and I which I'm terribly good at
heck I even managed to hook up with a friend of 4 years that turned out to be an incredibly wonderful girlfriend while I'm depressed

depression doesn't give a shit if you have everything you want, it fucks your brain and make you see them as worthless shit

what I see is that you are a terrible person that need to show off in order to get better
If people want to vent, ask for help, talk and stuff on this sub, let them fucking do it and let them fucking be

why the fuck would you bother wasting your time writing a post like this if everything was right in your life?

I'm just thankful that thanks to her I can have moments of peace and can vent to someone who understands (she also suffered from depression last year and managed to beat it). I don't put any weight on her shoulder because I know that I'm the only one that can heal myself from this. 

I hope that everyone that suffer depression learn that lesson as well. We are the only one that can heal ourselves, but that doesn't mean that we cannot looks to others for help. We just have to be careful to not become too dependent, it's something to keep in balance imo. 

As for you, I hope the days ahead are bright. Our lives are toughs, but there is always an end to the tunnel."
