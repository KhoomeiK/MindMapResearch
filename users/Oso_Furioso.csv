AmItheAsshole,ffeb6gk,t1_ffe92hl,1579841877.0,"Oh, man.  I appreciate your response (probably because it seems like you’re one of the only people who actually read and  understood the question) but I’m in Texas.  Texas doesn’t give a fuck.  There’s no subsidized home care here.  Social services are minimal."
AmItheAsshole,ffe7lg2,t1_ffe6cdz,1579838857.0,"I understand, but my question is whether I can fairly tell my mother that my sister has refused to help, not whether I can tell my sister off for her decision."
facepalm,ffced2e,t1_ffbkn2t,1579797644.0,I bet he found out when he shit himself.
funny,ffadd4l,t1_ffabok8,1579732894.0,"My sister's cat used to do this for revenge any time she went away for a week or two.  She'd come back and find a little pile in the middle of her bed.  Once she made a fuss over the cat, honor was satisfied, and it wouldn't happen again."
IdiotsInCars,ff9h6qw,t3_es9rbz,1579712937.0,I meant to do that.
todayilearned,ff6snuy,t1_ff6c6mh,1579634059.0,"I also wonder if it has a connection to Iron Man 3.  At the end of it, Stark swears off his ""addiction""--the fear and constantly building new suits in response--and throws the mini arc reactor that was in his chest into the ocean.  He makes the decision that that's not what's keeping him alive, and that he's Iron Man without the boost."
AskReddit,fentvaa,t1_fen1ng7,1579290677.0,"Came here to say this.  And it disappoints so many people when they realize it's in the middle of downtown San Antonio, surrounded by office buildings, hotels, etc.  That said, if you're in the area, stop by the Menger Hotel and visit the bar there.  It's where Teddy Roosevelt recruited his Rough Riders, and you can still see where Cary Nation struck the bar with her axe.  Also, it's modeled after the bar in the House of Lords."
AskReddit,fent9t0,t1_fenl9e6,1579290478.0,"You should also check out the Museum of Glass in Tacoma.  Lots of Chihuly's work both inside and outside the museum.  Also, the federal courthouse nearby houses some of of his works."
AskReddit,fensudo,t1_fen77pv,1579290223.0,"I visited the Villa a few years ago.  The architecture is amazing, and the setting is beautiful, as well."

funny,fenrohc,t1_fenoish,1579289767.0,"If you see the ninja, it is because the ninja wants you to see him.  If you do not see the ninja, it is because you have only seconds to live."
AmItheAsshole,fekqj1h,t3_epmdeh,1579205529.0,"OP, you’re being generous even to give your husband a say in what happens to that money.  Your step daughter is absolutely wrong that it’s “his money, too.”  Under legal principles, even in community property jurisdictions, money that you brought to the marriage and have not commingled with money in a joint account or earned during the marriage is separate property.  You’re NTA.  Your  stepdaughter most definitely is, and your husband is joining her."

law,fdnutvi,t1_fdnu7nq,1578593291.0,"Results were positive, yes.  Basically, a courthouse steps settlement.  We got fairly neutral coverage from the media--and it was a smaller city, by no means a major one--so less coverage, overall.  Also, because the judge was no longer on the bench by the time we were heading to trial, it wasn't as big a story as it might have been."
AmItheAsshole,fdnuf3s,t1_fdnn3eb,1578593046.0,"At the very least, it's neglectful and careless, and that's enough to maintain a lawsuit.  I'm not suggesting anyone sues anyone else, but the ""real world"" principle is essentially ""you broke it, you bought it.""  It doesn't matter if you meant to break it."
facepalm,fdntvaw,t1_fdnt2o4,1578592728.0,"If it were ""just a typo,"" you might not have felt the need to go back and correct it.  But, whatever.  Incidentally, I don't think Trump is dumb.  I think he's a grifter, a racist, a sexist, a narcissist, a xenophobe, and a first class manipulator of tiny minds, but I don't think he's dumb."
law,fdntg2o,t1_fdmhpjf,1578592486.0,I was one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs in a case involving a former judge sexually harassing female employees for 20 or so years.  The culture of silence and just looking the other way was extraordinary.

soccer,fdkwr9x,t1_fdkufaq,1578512752.0,"I would think so.  Trouble is that the keeper was at the edge of the six-yard box when Kroos hit it and nowhere near his line.  If he'd been on his line instead of out farther directing his defenders, he likely could have gotten the save."
AskReddit,fdksza2,t1_fdk9ax7,1578510517.0,"Imagine the two-for-one specials:  ""Yes ma'am, I'd like a Cleveland Steamer and a rim job, and my friend here will have a service of equal or lesser value."""

inthenews,fcsb57p,t1_fcs0b0n,1577914078.0,"I think you and I are probably on the same page, just with a bit of miscommunication.  My point was simply that the goings-on in the House were not a trial.  There was no power to convict or remove from office.  I agree with everything you’re saying."

IdiotsInCars,fc8mm4n,t1_fc8hgcd,1577538029.0,"This appears to be in the U.S.  Most small claims courts can’t award more than $10k, and you still have to collect it, which isn’t near as easy as you make it sound."

vegetarianrecipes,fc2z72o,t3_eckc6j,1577377822.0,"A lot of good advice here, and, as far as recipes are concerned, let me suggest that you just fish around Reddit quite a bit.  I’ve been on it only since earlier this year but have found a number of real “keeper” recipes contributed by folks on here."
