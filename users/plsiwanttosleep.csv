PewdiepieSubmissions,feuqetc,t1_feuomdk,1579388998.0,I mean it would be cool if it happened. But like you said online petitions don‚Äôt tend to work. Thought it would still be fun to try on the off chance this one actually does work.
PewdiepieSubmissions,feuo5n8,t1_feum4fw,1579388399.0,"I assumed the petition was made as a meme rather than a serious thing. I still get the reference, and I thought it was funny so I posted it here."
