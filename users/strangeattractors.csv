todayilearned,fejeddm,t1_fejdzv1,1579169990.0,"There is only one competitor in the market right now due to very low demand and low consumer awareness. As demand increases, if they can scale production, they can make more profit with higher volume while charging lower prices. They can choose to position themselves as a luxury good and keep the same price, at which point if the market demand increases, then competition will come in and drive costs down. You see this now with coconut oil, which used to be obscure. But, thanks, for the pedantry."

Inventions,fczd3ux,t3_eji6r0,1578098521.0,"I‚Äôve had many, many ideas I couldn‚Äôt patent. One idea/solution I‚Äôve come up with is to email either HR or public relations and CC several people in the department to ask for a small percentage of the profit or payment for the idea.

Tell them your idea in detail for this type of furniture that you believe will make them a lot of money. Tell them you know it isn‚Äôt patentable, but they could be the first company to market it, which will give them the competitive advantage. Give them a deadline of two weeks to get back to you, otherwise you will just release the plans on the Internet for everyone to use. Explain this would allow them to position themselves as a leader in innovative products, and that is why PR should be carbon copied. PR email addresses are usually in the press section of the website, but make sure you CC as many people as possible.

Try this with IKEA and let me know how it works. :)"
