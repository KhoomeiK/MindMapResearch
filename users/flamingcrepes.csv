Goldendoodles,fentabp,t3_eomw0j,1579290485.0,"Puppy anxiety: My first piece of advice is going to be unpopular probably, but I really think it has some merit. As difficult as it is to hear it, remain as calm as possible in his presence. I have depression and anxiety, and I know it sounds like, “just don’t be upset”. That’s not really what I mean. I genuinely think dogs feed off of our feelings instinctively. Just do your level best to be calm and relax near him. I know ours also has a bit of anxiety about not being near us, and it took a while for daytime crate training too, but he caught on. 

Cuddling: You mentioned he’s food centered, maybe give him a Kong or pvc pipe with peanut butter (or whatever) all in it. While he’s licking it, sit next to him and start petting and loving on him. I’d say do that over and over until he associates loving touches with good memories. Maybe when he’s done with the food, play with some toys together. 

Diarrhea: I also have an F1b. He had the worst stomach issues for ages. I figured out three things, (1) my pup could not handle anything with peas (usually the second ingredient). His poos were really gross. So I found a no peas food, added (2) pumpkin and(3) plain yogurt to each meal, now only has diarrhea when he eats chocolate, cat food, and daffodils. Damn dog eats everything he’s not supposed to. BUT HE’S CUTE!!!

Seriously though, he’s been worth the trouble. Sorry I wrote so much. I just know the struggle."

If You Tell (Gregg Olson) a non fiction about three sisters and their horror show of a mother. It’s beyond insane what people are capable of. Trigger warnings: the mom seriously is into physical violence and forces nudity, but no other sexual abuse that I can remember. 

Lost Hills (Lee Goldberg) is a murder mystery set in LA. The main character is a really strong female part, and am looking forward to the next installment. She’s a brand new detective who has to prove herself as she was “given” a promotion after some good press. Very good, quick read.

Goldendoodles,fdtfg7o,t3_eiubpg,1578715998.0,"We did crating for the safety of our pup and also because we had cats. We have older kids, so our house wasn’t “baby” proof. We had a fence up and gradually introduced him to larger parts of the house. Also kept accidents in one area. So, as the fence moved out wider, he naturally learned how things worked in different spaces. He wasn’t completely overwhelmed and overstimulated. 

Back to crating, it was only done when he was alone. Like if I had to shower or run an errand. I gradually lengthened his time in there. The general rule of thumb for potty times are one hour per month. So, if he’s three months, potty every three hours. But he had a terrible time potty training, and I am a stay at home mom, so it was pretty easy to arrange my schedule. Crating as a puppy for us was very important as we didn’t want him roaming and using everywhere as his bathroom. We also didn’t want him eating the wrong things (shoelaces, pens, remotes). In order for him to consider the crate a safe place, we put his bowls in there to eat (it’s a very large crate) every meal. We left the door open at all times, and had a towel or blanket in there for comfort. Also a toy or two. As he got older, I would leave him out for short periods, and extend that time each time I went out. We now only have a bed crate at night, because I refuse to have him in our bed. He’s 50 pounds and would only sleep on my side. Since the hubby already takes half the bed, that’s a no go for me. We tell him to go to bed and he walks right in, flops over and passes out. No big deal. As a tiny pup, I actually had him in a box, sitting on a stool, so he would be close to me if he needed to go out. By the time he was 12 weeks, he slept through the night. No problem. It’s so much like having a baby. Except puppies know what they can get away with. 

My biggest piece of advice? Be loving, and firm. If you don’t want pup to sleep in your bed, don’t let it happen even once. If you want pup to go in a crate, don’t let it out when it whines, or it will never stop. You are the boss, and your dog will appreciate an owner that is even keeled. Try “How to raise the perfect dog” by Cesar Milan. Ignore the parts where the older dogs train the younger, but pay attention to the routines he suggests and the discipline he talks about. Take about half of it to heart. Good luck with your new friend!"

crochet,fdpajzo,t1_fdmqp2h,1578623844.0,I really like the idea of shortening the bands of degrees. Like parts of Florida would be the same color 90% of the time if you used a 10° band or averages. But if you did 4° increments between 80° and 100° you would definitely get a nice 5 color change. I’ll have to keep that in mind if we move back!

Goldendoodles,fdmfdgs,t3_ejzza5,1578548057.0,"We got a “standard” who turned out to be a bit of a runt. He’s just 50 pounds and not as tall as most, maybe 2 feet, 8 or 9 inches at the top of his head? I’ve met his younger siblings and they’re easily 4-6 inches taller. He’s an F1B, and luckily doesn’t shed. We got F1B specifically because of allergies in the home, which haven’t been a problem at all. He wasn’t super hyper as a puppy, and quite easy to train, even though SOME people in the house weren’t as consistent as they should have been. Also, he’s our first dog, so we took some bad advice and it wound up taking a LOT longer to potty train him than it should have. He’s super smart, but quite timid. He’s also low energy as a 2 yo adult. One thing that has been an issue we had to sort out was his tummy troubles. He’s on a low pea diet with an addition of pumpkin, yogurt, and probiotic. It’s all in order to keep him from having ridiculously loose stools. He has a very delicate stomach. I think it might be the poodle in him. Honestly, he’s been a good boy. And great for our family. No regrets. 

Sorry for the word diarrhea. Once I start, I can’t stop."
