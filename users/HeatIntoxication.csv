Uthermal I wouldn't even call a professional player. Innovation hasn't cheesed in a professional game in an extremely long time as well. Serrals roach/ravager allin isn't a cheese and literally the only way to get out of constant BC harass and 30 minute Mech games. How are you 5100 exactly?

starcraft,ffdtbxc,t1_ffdrix9,1579828414.0,Literally the only cheese that works at high level is cannon/shield battery/immortal proxies. Do you watch starcraft? It doesn't seem like you do because there are only a handful of players that ever proxy or cheese in any high level games.

starcraft,ffdqakd,t1_ffdpk4w,1579826376.0,Your profile does not have a GM badge my friend. You are a big fat phony. I honestly doubt you were anywhere close to master in HOTS if you think Zerg 6 pool wasn't one of the best cheeses in the game at the time.

starcraft,ffdo030,t1_ffdnkvl,1579824945.0,You don't know what you are talking about. Having six workers for Protoss and Terran meant that Zerg cheese was extremely effective. It took them forever to get out defending units when you just dropped a six pool and moved 6 lings across the map extremely early. It was a guaranteed win vs someone who expanded first or delayed their gateway/spawning pool/barracks. As a masters player I could literally 6 pool to diamond winning every single game I played and constantly showed Zerg players how to do it.

coolguides,ffdncnz,t1_ffczyp8,1579824552.0,"No one at a restaurant is going to be mad at you for ordering a well done burger. In fact, this is one of the easiest things to cook. I don't have to pay attention to it and can worry about other dishes. Even if it gets overcooked a little bit too much, it is usually fine and still desirable as 'well done'. Theres nothing more of a pain in the ass as a medium/medium well burger. The customers definition is always different from the temperature and you have to pay attention to them way too much. Steaks are much different as a well done steak has to waste space on my cooking surface for an extremely long time and steaks are extremely easy to temp. Its more that you are destroying a good piece of meat by cooking it well done. Ground beef are not especially good cuts of meat so it doesn't matter."
coolguides,ffdn5ls,t1_ffcxenj,1579824433.0,"Want to cook the perfect steak? Start touching it through its cooking process. Press into a rare steak to get how it feels. Once it starts cooking you'll notice the difference between each temperature. A medium rare steak is soft and bouncy. A medium steak is a bouncy but a little firm. Medium well steaks are even more firm and have almost lost all squishyness. A well done steak is tough, firm and dry looking."
starcraft,ffdl6pn,t1_ffcl3ek,1579823225.0,"In Broodwar, you also have one-two units attacking your base a couple minutes into the game and is usually a non-stop back and fourth micro battle between units until someone dies. This is way different than SC2's constant timing attacks because the games tech is balanced so poorly."
starcraft,ffdk5wy,t1_ffcvk7l,1579822600.0,"What cheese exactly are you talking about? The strongest cheese in the game is Protoss cannon/shield battery rushes. A cannon can be made before 12 pool zerglings can even be created. Terran can literally two rax, do zero damage, and float on home vs a Zerg and be perfectly even. Hell, this was a common thing to do in Korea for nearly six months last year and was the meta opener. Zerg has...what? Nydus? Line/bane Bust? Roach/Ravager? All of these hit at 5:30 or later and cannot be macroed out of if you do zero damage. You can't even 12 pool and do damage to a protoss anymore because they can have a wall and zealot on hold position before you even get to their base."

The auto play trailers are just the tip of the iceberg on bad design. A lot of the movies are poorly categorized, you have to sift through tons of poorly rated films to find good quality content. They removed user ratings, removed dates of films released, constantly change movie banners so the films look different at first glance. 

The apps for every platform are totally different and make finding things even harder than using their website. The watch again category is a farce and as others have mentioned, a lot of times auto-played trailers will put shows and films in this category. They spent years being the only streaming platform around and now they're refusing to innovate when other platforms are showing up and doing things better. Being judgmental about bad policies and design does not make you a moron."
