The enhance weapons just give you combo point basically but only some of those enhance actually do something extra while you have the combo loaded.

The shocks are the same, only some of them actually do something beside just doing damage of a different element.

You want to propose something valid? Good, but think it through, that is just a reskin of rogue combo points and basically every ""enhance/shock"" don't have anything left to the player to decide and are not ""best"" at nothing.

This judge decided that we were trying to scam the insurance and that was it. Didn't want to go through the documentation, listen to what we had to say to explain the situation a little better as we assumed there was a misunderstanding.

Leaving the court my wife was nearly crying. Two years spent chasing the insurance to get compensation for the damage suffered and we got barely half of it. Not considering the ""damage"" that a case that last 2 years is doing in terms of time and resources to pull it off.

Didn't really fit what we see in the show."
witcher,fbxoad9,t1_fbxilh1,1577195690.0,"GoT didn't pull off Ghost due to showrunners decisions. Not because they didn't have the resources. The dragons are way more complex to render in CGI than Ghost. It's general knowledge that they didn't want to introduce too much ""classic fantasy"" because the fantasy buff where not the target audience, according to D&D.

Anyway, the budget per episode is easily found on wikipedia:

> The pilot reportedly cost HBO US$5–10 million to produce,[43] while the **first season's budget was estimated at $50–60 million**.[44] In the second season, the series received a 15-percent budget increase for the climactic battle in ""Blackwater"" (which had an $8 million budget).[45][46] **Between 2012 and 2015, the average budget per episode increased from $6 million[47] to ""at least"" $8 million.[48]** The sixth-season budget was over $10 million per episode, for a season total of over $100 million and a series record.[49]

The budget for the S1 is 80 million. 10 million per episode.

Edit: forgot the link to the wikipedia for the lazy ass people: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones#Production"

You may want to rethink that ""good for a first season""."
witcher,fbxi1tk,t1_fbwamrf,1577188518.0,"As /u/sesshaku said, the first is probably the harder to play. Part of the reason is that while storywise is still very good, the gameplay is horrible. There are really no excuses for it.

I strongly suggest to every new player to read the story on a wiki or watch a video summarizing it for the first game of the saga.

Then pick up from the second one."

Opposed to ""I got her from the Brokilon forest where she was mind numbed by the waters and we organically bonded. Then we got separated but ah, finally we find each other again""

yeah, the books make such a worst job at this."
witcher,fbxbv2k,t1_fbs67fc,1577179070.0,"that's when it becomes obvious to everyone (the majority). Doesn't change the fact that prior to that it's confusing for a very simple reason: the main characters don't age. Even some of the secondary (without any reasonable explanation) age at all, like Jaskiel.

It's badly made, people can defend it as much as they want for some mysterious fervour, it's not well done."
witcher,fbwhigw,t1_fbusfxh,1577150073.0,"Yep, I remember that part. Maybe she'll be one of those character story arcs. Who knows. The only thing is that right now, the presentation of this show (season 1) is not promising and it bothers me because I'd really like for it to become a good stepping stone of the fantasy TV productions."
witcher,fbvtywk,t1_fbsh9nu,1577136039.0,"I don't mean this in an arrogant way but you should really read the books.

Everything you ask clarification for is there and they are written is a very simple way ( the author is in no way in the same league of GRRM or a Tolkien, just to give you an idea)."
