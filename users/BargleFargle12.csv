I said nothing about nonreligious people, nor are they anywhere close to this threads point. And my Catholic neighbor doesn't volunteer in her church's soup kitchen because she's afraid of hell. She does it because she's a a genuinely good person who cares about people."

I played against her twice last night in draft battles. She's not bad. Definitely annoying but hardly broken and easily killed. Just relax."

Hence ops comment about preferring they do it in his house and not some back alley. With a girl there WOULD BE pregnancy issues to worry about, but in that case you buy him condoms and teach him about safe sex. You can't  control their minds, and though it's your job as a parent to make sure they're making good choices, sometimes that means working with them instead of against them as they get older."
