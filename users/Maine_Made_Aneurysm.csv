Its all over the place with japanes tropes and themes related to the fuedal age. But more than anything I  think what really set people off about sekiro is exactly what you say. The mechanics are almost to troll dark souls players. Their blatantly different than most of their other games, which is frankly hilarious. Them doing away with effectiveness of the dodge roll requiring you to block and parry mostly everything that isnt unreasonable is comical."

gaming,fdzzti4,t1_fdzzgyu,1578799694.0,"I feel like this is FromSofts foray into something a fair bit different than Souls really. I love how beautiful and enthralling the souls games are,l but It would be an enormous step for From Soft to actually develop decent RPG type game. Something with the mysticism of a souls game, and the mechanics of something truly unique for once in a long long time."

But wasnt one of their Creative Directors let go of recently? 

Mark Darrah or something? I have no clue anymore, i'm too lazy to look it up anymore.

Movements are not a culture, femisism is not simply a belief either. 

This is more than just a presence of mind when it pertains to political or ethical concerns. 

Although I must give you praise, because your view of the matter has shed newfound light on subject for me to research in the future. Which I extremely appreciate you making me aware of. So I thank you very much so. 

But I must digress while you are right partially for your view of things it is also flawed at the same time to believe so because the fallacy of the no true Scotsman ideal is that it wouldn't be subject to fabrication or a continuous manufacturing like process if not mistaken? 

Where upon it's built up and added to In profound ways like modern day beliefs, or principles and efforts have to be. In a sort give them an inch they take a mile. But in this case they do it rambunctiously, zealously and in a heinously dangerous way. 

What are your thoughts?"
todayilearned,fc2h6w7,t1_fc29ppp,1577360040.0,"Before i wholesomely agree with your very meaningful statement I need to pose a question. 

Did you intend to insinuate that America in general was behind all of what you were giving for examples or should I assume that you meant the world as a whole?

Because if you chose the latter we can agree that there are corrupt people everywhere..."
todayilearned,fc2dpi5,t1_fc2dhk1,1577354190.0,"Ok well if it's looks that's reassuring. I agree he makes funny expressions. 

I got suspended for putting a picture of that famous face he made in the vending machine at high school. Our program was in charge of the machines and someone paid for a printed picture of his face. 

I was sure I heard someone say something controversial about him and movies he did about the founding fathers and mount Rushmore at some point. 

But I never knew much more than that.

Cool username btw"

Nicegirls,fc25lw7,t1_fc21sdo,1577341440.0,"That's a remarkable view on it. 

I usually don't comment on Reddit anymore, but I have to say I was bullied Alot because I'm autistic growing up. I had Alot of misperceptions about certain things. I tended too and at times I still do put too much faith in people. 
But more than anything after highschool and the group homes I was put in, through survival mechanisms I became what I hated so much. While I tend to still be very empathic at times. 

I still have moments where I can be a savagely ruthless dickhead to people, Purely on impulse. the good thing is I tend be pretty aware or self reflective and I tend to realize when I have been. Coupled with being fairly good at communicating. 

Maybe not so much at grammar...
But in conversation, I like to think I care about just about anyone. 

And more than anything I find the people that have come to irritate me the most are people who don't work on themselves or believe they have nothing to work on themselves. Not necessarily lazy but just the atypical people who think they have everything figured out. Especially when theres Alot of grey area to be thought about in today's world."

I have to say the actress does a phenomenal job as Triss though."
