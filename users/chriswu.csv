worldnews,fejmhli,t1_fejahoe,1579179869.0,"That doesn't solve the problem. I'm not going to invent new connectors if I have little assurance it will be adopted. Or for example if my new device can take advantage of ultra fast charging but needs a new connectors, and entrenched companies can't, they have little incentive to adopt a new standard that allows me to outcompete them."

worldnews,fej2ozr,t1_feijdy7,1579154668.0,"Yes, but it's not even the slowness that's the problem. It's the bias towards the status quo.  You might never get the innovation approved because it never gains traction and therefore never a reason to approve a new standard."
worldnews,fei7tq5,t1_fei6jxn,1579132211.0,Agreed. Size of nozzle doesn't greatly affect gas delivery.  Charger protocol isn't just about head shape.
worldnews,fei7odt,t1_fehjlvr,1579132117.0,"100% agree.  This is literally putting up barriers to innovation.  Seems like a good idea now, but imagine if this law had been passed 10 years ago. I guess we'd be stuck with mini-usb standard!"

todayilearned,fbytvjc,t1_fbyq1zx,1577226196.0,"My employer has made a choice for me that I have to spend 24 hours a day at this city.  Given my own choices, I would not be exercising, eating, or living in this city.  It is also not reasonable that my employer expects I stay holed up in the hotel or office all day.  I'm not asking that they pay me for hours I'm not working, but my safety has been impacted directly by my employer's choice to send me to this city 24 hours a day.   Normal life activities should be covered (yes, even though it's not ""work"") - again because my employer has made that choice for me - to put me in a position where I don't have control over where I am in order to provide a service for my employer.  They don't have to cover me if I decide to go bungee jumping - but it's not unreasonable that normal life activities (which the French have decided include sex) are covered."

For normal work you're expected to live within a commutable distance where you can cross the threshold and stop ""being at work"". Choosing to go to your grandma's crosses that threshold as well."
Conservative,faoob63,t1_fao7mg5,1576268831.0,"Being environmentally conscious doesn't mean suddenly stopping all forms of carbon based transportation.  It's nearly impossible to avoid in our modern society, but that doesn't mean a plan to reduce or replace carbon based industries can't be made.  People who pretend anything other than total abstinence is hypocrisy are just being foolish.  

It's like if your family including yourself is overweight, and you say, ""hey, we should all eat less"" and someone says, ""I saw  you eat something just this morning, you're a hypocrite!""."
