science,ff8gqko,t1_ff8gccv,1579677740.0,"I didn’t say it was false. I said it is like saying water is wet. Its not worth commenting about, especially in a “science” sub.

And in addition, whether evidence and statistics have been gathered, the same is true of Democrats and their choice media outlets, again making it non-newsworthy.

Mentioning something like this in a “science” sub is an example of why many people don’t trust science these days.

Sure it is “science” but it’s presence has a clear political bias, that could be stated about the other party equally, but no one has simply put in the research to prove it.

So the end result of this article is something in the neighborhood of “See! I told you conservatives are easily duped and get all their information from Fox News!” without any regard to the fact Democrats have their own biases and sources of their motives and political actions as well."

The question at hand is what now? In my opinion a measured response is appropriate here, but I am not an expert. If this was truly just a saving face action by Iran, then it may be worth it to de-escalate at this point.

Stoicism,fdcr2aa,t3_eknfjj,1578281928.0,"I can only speak for myself and my first few baby steps with stoicism.

The practice, to sum, is getting me closer to a point where I know better what I want out of life, which then is helping me to make better decisions about my direction in life.

I started leaning on stoicism because I am currently in a difficult situation that I don’t want to be in, long story short, because I made a hasty, poorly thought out life decision.

So now I am trying to do some truthful analysis of how I got in this situation, what this situation can teach me about myself and my decision making abilities, how to embrace my emotions authentically without allowing them to consume me, and what I am going to do now that I am in this situation. In other words, I am trying to focus now on the things I can control.

What I realize from this so far, is that stoic meditations are helping me answer those questions and do that authentically.

It is not easy at all, as a matter of fact I would say trying to embrace stoicism is very difficult at first, but I can say that it has worked for me as I have been moving forward.

I have not answered all those questions so far, but I am doing my best to use stoic wisdom to do so.

I still feel like I am going to throw up every day when I wake up, but then I calm myself with stoic meditations and prayer (I am also a Christian).

Day by day, moment by moment is the best I can tell you.

So no, I would say it is not too good to be true. The meditations work. They do not give you answers but they help you remain calm when attempting to figure those questions out.

It is difficult, but I feel like I am getting closer to a point where I can honestly say “this is what I want out of life and this is what I do not want”, which is how Stoicism has helped me the most.

Sorry I did not intend on writing that much but got on a roll. Hope that helps a little."
