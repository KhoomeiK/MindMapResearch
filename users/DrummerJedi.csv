bipolar,ffax10d,t3_esbb33,1579746462.0,"Had a really awful last few days, was barely able to get through my first two days of classes, and have felt extremely suicidal. Currently living with an awful roommate, but two good ones as well. Life has been very poor for me in some important ways. Hoping that my lithium increase and therapy helps put me back on track."

bipolar,fdo3tjg,t3_emcq9h,1578598385.0,Each person will have different things that make them feel better. I think a good takeaway from this is that certain lifestyle changes such as exercise and regimented sleep can be more effective than you might think in tandem with prescribed medication and therapy.
