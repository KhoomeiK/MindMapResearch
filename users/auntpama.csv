antidiet,ffcnr2e,t3_eswjnl,1579803371.0,"I am sitting in the hospital waiting room waiting for my sister who is having surgery to remove extra skin after having lost over 100 pounds (she had gastric bypass two years ago).  She yo-yo dieted her whole life but always gained it back. She is 60 now. 

I am 53, and am now in the obese range with a BMI of 34 and wishing that I could get surgery to remove my fat. I am jealous of her because hers was paid for by insurance. I would have to pay out of pocket. 

But at the same time I realize how crazy I am to be thinking this way. Why can‚Äôt I just love myself the way I am. I never could, even when I was thinner. 

I don‚Äôt know what to say or think about this issue. Sigh. 

But I wish for you lots of love and hugs in your journey."

Psychic,fdls3nz,t3_em1gob,1578531172.0,"Near death experiences are the closest we will get to ever having an inkling of what happens. People from the beginning of time have been wondering what happens after death and we still don‚Äôt know thousands of years later. 

Try looking through these experiences that people have had and you may find comfort:

offmychest,fc09u1p,t3_efgxch,1577284325.0,"You are not disgusting. I shower only two or three times a week, and my husband says I smell fine. There are people who don‚Äôt stink and don‚Äôt need to shower every day.  In fact, I remember reading something somewhere that it‚Äôs healthier to not shower every day. 

I also hate showering and find it stressful. I find a lot of things that people normally do very stressful. One of them is cleaning and organizing my house. I get overwhelmed just thinking about it so it doesn‚Äôt get done until I absolutely can‚Äôt take it anymore, and then it‚Äôs a huge undertaking. I ask myself, why don‚Äôt you just do a little cleaning every day so it isn‚Äôt so overwhelming, but even THAT  is stressful!

I do have an anxiety disorder called Generalized Anxiety Disorder that is a major contributor to my stress. Could this be something that resonates with you? Do you also find lots of other normal activities that other people do without thought, stressful?"
