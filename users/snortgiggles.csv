AskReddit,ffelhpm,t1_ffdqj3w,1579853116.0,"I'll never forget driving through Centrial Aisa, in and out of Russia three times by car borders ... and how the people were just people. Nice people. One border guy was interested in the wine we brought from Azerbaijan, because he was a collector; another telling me about her school trip to Ohio a few years back; a cab driver returning my phone and wallet left behind in the taxi, so deeply amused that I'd somehow managed to experience Russian honesty and must have been scared shitless. The Russians were among the nicest folks I met in that trip. 

TL;DR my trip driving across Russian borders and through the country taught me that the people are not their government."

Depends on where you live and whether you're willing to relocate, but focus on your resume:

- Times New Roman font, 11pt, small margins, PDF.
- Accomplishments, not responsibilities
- 3-4 bullets max per job. Seriously.
- ignore advice like ONE PAGE (but never more than 2), and ""must have cover letter/objective statement""
- chronological is best if you can
- all tenses must be consistent
- quadruple check for errors and unecessary capitalizations
- tailor to the job you're applying for. Did I mention to tailor to the job you're applying for? Tailor to the job you're applying for. But never embellish or lie.

Step 2: resumes are just to get you the interview, and set the stage - you want them excited to have finally found a good candidate. Think about as many instances,  projects, changes, l initiatives, anything at all that you are proud of, in work, in school, in life. That way you have something to talk about during an interview. Ask them if your example is what they're looking for. Don't be afraid to ask clarifying questions.

Don't overdress. If you wear a suit it should not be too large.
