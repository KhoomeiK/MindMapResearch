todayilearned,feibcaf,t1_feh7gj6,1579134515.0,"> “Days” could just have been in the cosmic unthinkable scale of billions of years


I’ve heard this a few dozen times before and I just want to clear up a few things. The idea I have heard repeated all over the place and the one I think you are alluding to is that changing the “days” of creation into some other measurement fixes it. Well…


• the first day - light was created

• the second day - the sky was created

• the third day - dry land, seas, plants and trees were created

• the fourth day - the Sun, Moon and stars were created

• the fifth day - creatures that live in the sea and creatures that fly were created

• the sixth day - animals that live on the land and finally humans, made in the image of God were created

• by day seven - God finished his work of creation and rested, making the seventh day a special holy day.

OK, so there was light before the sun and stars, then the sky was made even later but before land and sea.
Plants sat around for who-knows-how long before the sun and stars and then flying creatures predated animals that live on land

Nope, it’s all still out of touch with reality."

To his credit he does recover enough to raddle off a few variations trump’s slogan of “make America great” there at the end. I guess that’s why they plaster it all over the walls and their clothing so that even the slowest of them can remember it at times like this."

I don’t want to keep jumping around topics trying to nail down your intent. Be clear. I’m not going to respond to this until I know what exactly you mean.

let’s start with clearing up a few things.

What exactly are you referring to?

I would really like you to expand on what you are saying here.  I don’t really understand what you are trying to say with this assertion."
youtubehaiku,fczj5ld,t1_fczi8vd,1578102391.0,"I didn’t defend anything. I stated the fact that this has happened more than 50 times in modern history yet we never blew up foreign leaders over it before. This is an overreaction and a paper thin excuse to go to war at the end of his term. 

This would be like if they had attacked and killed our sectary of defense while he was meeting with officials from the UK. It would absolutely mean war. This is a massive step up in the escalation of violence and amazingly timed one at that."
youtubehaiku,fczf7s3,t1_fczamoa,1578099921.0,"And that attack was in retaliation for deaths from US airstrikes. Its all part of ongoing escalation. Something that a good negotiator would try to curb. 

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attacks_on_U.S._diplomatic_facilities) are 52 examples of other attacks on US diplomatic facilities.

Can you tell me how many of them resulted in us full on attacking a country and blowing up their leaders? 

Bonus question. Can you tell me how many and witch candidates have started a war at the end of their first term in office?"

Here, I already linked to all the places Jesus is directly quoted. Don't know why you want them in the book of matt, but these are all NT.

You all need to read your bibles."
todayilearned,fcjbfah,t1_fciu5yh,1577682103.0,"OK, can only use new testament? Here you go. 

Ephesians 6:5-8

> 5Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ; 6not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart. 7With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men, 8knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free. 

Christian slaves were told to obey their masters ""for the sake of the cause"" and be especially obedient to Christian masters

1 Timothy 6:1-2

> 1All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine will not be spoken against. 2Those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren, but must serve them all the more, because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach and preach these principles. 

There are instructions for Christian slave owners to treat their slaves well. 


Colossians 4:1

> 1Masters, grant to your slaves justice and fairness, knowing that you too have a Master in heaven

More instructions on how to care for your slave, not free him, but be nice to him.

Now go on and tell me that this is a misunderstanding, or jump through whatever hoops you want to now move the goal post but know that anyone who was pro-slavery had a much easier time making their case, and they did make a case with these and more."
