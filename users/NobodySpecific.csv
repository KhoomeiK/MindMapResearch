I'm not saying to move. I only relocated once, temporarily, and since then I haven't moved. I'm in a pretty niche industry in a small state that's unfriendly to business. There have been some very hard times for people. That's why I had to take a much lower paying job for a year, I needed insurance and I had just been laid off. It is much harder finding a job when you don't have one, especially if you need to change careers.

There are plenty of reasons to stay that are driven by forces other than money, I understand that. But you should still look occasionally. Talk to people, see who's hiring and what skills are in demand in your line of work. Don't pigeon hole yourself into working on something that's going to make your skills obsolete."

Foodforthought,ff4q1pd,t1_ff41iqz,1579569692.0,"That happened at my first job. So I quit after I found a better one. 

Then a few years later I had to take a huge pay cut just to have a job, so I did and worked my butt off. Less than a year later a former boss (who I similarly worked hard for) offered me a job with a nearly 50% raise.

Meanwhile I've seen people get complacent. Stay at the same job as long as they can then have no plan when that job goes away. I've seen people unemployed for 6 months or more. Same industry, same jobs, and yet I've never been unemployed more than 2 months. I've been laid off three times and turned two of those into promotions with nice raises.

Working hard is just part of it. You have to make good impressions on people, learn new things, and work hard. But you also have to take the time to invest in yourself. Go on interviews, look at what's out there, even if it's just to know.

You only get market rate if you're on the market. I've had 8 different employers in the last 14 years. Only once did I ever have to take a pay cut, but there were years with no raises as well. 

I tried staying at the same company for 5 years after they paid me a ton to work on the other side of the country for a year. They rewarded me with 3 years of no raises and an unceremonious layoff. I'll be loyal if the company treats me well. If not? I only have myself to blame for staying.

Never leave without having something else lined up, but that something else might take a year to find. Be patient, network, but in the meantime work hard."

AskElectronics,fey2mf3,t1_fewlgbf,1579439924.0,"> But in defense of the screwups, it does lean somewhat on the 'ideal' nature of the sources, right?

Not really. If the sources weren't ideal, then you would have a variation around 9W, but it would still, for all intents and purposes, be 9W. 

Let's say your voltage supply has a 10% tolerance (just to make the math easier). So if your voltage source is fluctuating between 4.5V and 5.5V, then your current supply would have to react.

How quickly the current source reacts and the tolerances it can achieve will vary. So let's say it takes your current source 1 second to react to a change. As your voltage source goes down (4.5V), for that 1 second you would have a slightly higher current. Going back to V=IR, we would now know V, but not I. 

So do the math. If the steady state output voltage of the current source is 8V, and your voltage source drops to 4.5V, you would now have 3.5V across your resistor. Power dissipated = 12.25W.

But it's temporary, and the current source will drop the output voltage to compensate. So you will have varying dynamic power, but your steady state power is 9W. 

Since this is a DC problem, we can ignore those fluctuations as not enough information has been given to solve for the dynamic power.

Even in the real world, this will settle out at something very very close to 9W, if not 9W exactly."

AskElectronics,fesfujb,t3_eqfs08,1579364736.0,"As always, V=IR is the place I start.

Voltage across the resistor = 3A * 1ohm = 3V

There are many ways to calculate power:  
P=VI  
P=I^2 R  
P=V^2 R

All 3 equations give the same answer: 9W

The voltage source is completely irrelevant. It will only affect the behavior of the current source.  
In this case the voltage required to maintain 1A is 8V (5V+3V).  
If the voltage source was 0V, then the current source would have an output voltage of 3V.  
If the voltage source was 20V, then the current source ~~have~~ would have an output voltage of 23V.  
None of that affects the power through the resistor."

So running with 4%, you take the entire $22,500 and put it in an S&P500 ETF. You then take out a margin loan on that (you can usually borrow 150% of the value of the shares you own). Now you make 6% each year on the money while paying off the loan. Now you're back to the debate on which is cheaper to own over the life of the car. I've had my truck for 6.5 years. In the first 4 I did nothing but oil changes, inspections, and winter tires. Since then I've had to replace the brakes twice (rust, then a seized parking brake) and the suspension (blew out the rear shocks, decided to upgrade the whole thing). I can tell you that the cost of the maintenance has not been cheap. 

When you buy a used car you run the risk of having expensive repair bills stack up on top of your loan payment. I've purchased two new cars now, and I've paid both of them off before I had any maintenance. At that point I had the cash flow established (I kept making car payments to a savings account), so the maintenance was already paid for.

I intend to purchase a Tesla as my next vehicle, and I intend to finance 100% of it with a margin loan. That way I keep all of my investments, and the collateral that they provide keep the interest rate lower. I have no concerns with the value going too low, I won't borrow more than 50% of my portfolio balance. And if cash flow becomes a problem, for whatever reason, I can sell the shares to settle up the loan if I have to.

To me it seems like a very low risk, low cost way of buying a new car without sacrificing the compounding interest opportunity cost to buy that car."
