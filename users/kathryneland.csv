dogswithjobs,ff3le9v,t1_ff3kgym,1579543528.0,service dog registries are fake and it’s illegal and extremely wrong to bring a fake service dog in public. do not do this.

Eyebleach,ff0xgab,t1_ff0x9jy,1579473254.0,it’s not playing - all of these are commands. first “get” then “give” then waiting then “touch” and “hold”. no where does the dog play with the toy.
