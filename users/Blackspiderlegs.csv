Advice,ff6g5o5,t3_ertzn4,1579626479.0,"What sometimes works for me when I'm stuck at a certain weight is to raise my calories slightly (usually to maintenance of current weight) for a couple of weeks (even a week or ten days usually works) and then cut them back down to your usual cutting calories. I honestly couldn't tell you why this works but my theory is that after a while of dieting you stop being so careful with counting and you get tired of eating less than your body needs, so ""resetting"" can be helpful. Anyway, it usually works for me."
