Then, there's the titles: If the dubbing is bad, the titles don't usually even match a direct translation: they are usually a wreck that does not even match the movie's theme or plot and are translated to Spanish equivalents that result in true aberrations of a title - some title in the past has even been known to be direct spoilers of the main plot of the movie.
