On my rewatch, years after the first, I couldn’t remember who Dexter left Harrison with. I initially thought it was Lumen and became disappointed when it was Hannah. Lumen made sense because she saw the darkness and still embraced Dex. She cared for Harrison and understood the messy parts of his life. I understand her arc but I thought they felt for each other. Deb was such a major part of his arc and life, Hannah poisoned her(twice). He gave Harrison up to save him from 
growing up with the danger of a killer to give him to another killer. Honestly, I like a lot of the later seasons outside of Dexters love interests."
