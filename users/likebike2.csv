rust,ffcznaf,t1_ffcz0wg,1579810536.0,"Another path I went down for a while was trying to allocate everything on the stack, rather than the heap.  I had assumed that stack operations were always much faster than heap operations, and so I tried writing my own version of a stack-allocated vector.

In the end, I ended up figuring out that the memory performance is exactly the same between stack and heap.  The only difference is the initial allocation cost; after that, the performance is identical.

I ended up simplifying the design and improving the performance by creating a re-usable heap-allocated Vec, with a large initial capacity (called a ""Slab"")."
rust,ffcz0wg,t1_ffcxzr3,1579810190.0,"Great question.

What it came down to was, I was trying to reduce the amount of work I was doing by using what I though would be lower-level operations.  But it turned out that those ""low-level operations"" were actually much higher-level than I thought they were because they had safety checks, auto-conversions, and panics hidden inside of them.

For example, I would try to convert an iterator into a 'for' loop.  But I didn't realize that the index operation ( x[i] ) and integer arithmetic was much heavier than it is in other languages.  Therefore, my hand-optimized code ran much slower than a ""high-level"" iterator chain.

Once I understood the hidden costs, I was able to write loops that far exceeded the performance of the original iterator chains."

You can't determine the response just after a day or two.  This is because some of the medicines (particularly Mupirocin) do not directly attack the bacteria -- instead, they prevent the bacteria cells from reproducing, so there's a significant delay (10 days) between the application of Mupirocin and its observable effects."
Dermatology,ffbleuy,t3_espm1i,1579771044.0,"Have you already tried using anything on it?

I'm not sure what it is, but you might be able to determine if it is fungal or bacterial by measuring its response to different things.  For example, to test if it is bacterial, you could use Mupirocin ointment for a couple weeks.  To test if it is fungal, you could use Miconazole nitrate.  Depending on where you live, you might be able to get both of those things as over-the-counter (non-prescription) creams from your local pharmacy.  If you do decide to go this route, don't mix them -- try one for 2 weeks and see the reaction.  Then try the other for 2 weeks and see its reaction.  Keep the measurements separate."

Dermatology,felxlmt,t1_fektzau,1579233501.0,"I think it's probably more than just the Vitamin D.  Sunshine is an excellent anti-septic/anti-fungal/anti-bacterial tool, so it's going to help kill any baddies that are living in your sores.

On top of that, Sunshine helps to dry things out -- you probably already know that you should try to avoid getting water on these sores because your skin is injured and will quickly ""absorb"" the water rather than being water-resistant like healthy skin.  Sunshine helps to counter-act this.

If your sores are out-of-control (painful, cracking, bleeding, stopping-you-from-doing-normal-things) then you should use some of that steroid cream that you got from the doctor, or just go get some hydrocortisone cream from any pharmacy since it doesn't require a prescription, and use it just-long-enough to get the rash back under control.  Then use lots of Cetaphil and sunshine to try to maintain the healthy state.

At the beginning, I had to wear cotton gloves full of Cetaphil at night to keep the rash from coming back.  But after a few months, it got to the point where I only needed to use the Cetaphil a few times a day.

These are good questions, and you *need* to understand them before you can be successful in Forex, and it's difficult to find good info for these topics.

What it boils down to is, you are right -- if you think EUR will appreciate, it would be conceptually simpler to just go to the bank and trade your USD for EUR notes.  You could even use a EUR-denominated bank loan to achieve leverage.  At the end of the trade, you would convert the EUR back into USD and be left with a profit or loss.  The downside of this approach is that it requires the bank to actually *have* euros, and that's expensive.

Forex brokers have created an alternative solution to this problem:  They have created betting instruments that are based on the exchange rates of two currencies.  When you buy a EUR/USD pair, you do *NOT* get euros.  The forex broker doesn't hold euros.  In fact, there are no real currencies notes anywhere in the forex process.  Instead, when you buy a EUR/USD pair, you are agreeing to a betting contract.  When the trade is finally closed, the profit/loss of the bet will be the exit price minus the entry price, multiplied by the predefined value-per-pip.  By doing this, the forex broker doesn't need to hold anything of real value, and they can invent a wide range of betting products only limited by their imagination.  It's very profitable for the forex broker.

I hope that gets you thinking in the right direction.  Let me know if you have specific questions about any of that."
