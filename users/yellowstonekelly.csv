Memories can be tricky animals and it‚Äôs often times difficult to separate an actual memory from something we‚Äôve been told or an event we‚Äôve seen a photo of. 

In my case, my first memory (I think) of a newsworthy event was the assassination of JFK. I would have been four and my mom was babysitting a couple of girls about my age for one of our neighbors. We were all playing together in another room when the news came over the TV. I can remember my mom running in, gathering us up, and taking us into the family room where the TV was located. We all huddled in there watching the news, not really understanding what had happened, but frightened by seeing how upset my mom was."
