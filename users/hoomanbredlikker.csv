Once I went over to their house just to visit and was walking my way down the driveway towards the barn where I knew my stepmom was tending to her horses. The rescue had only met me once before and barked when I got out of the car. But when I ignored her and walked further towards my stepmom she bit me on my ass and broke skin. Even in the 4 weeks she had been there she had become that protective of her, and I paid the price for not paying the hand smell / head pat tax."
