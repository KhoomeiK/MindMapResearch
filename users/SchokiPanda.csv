AmItheAsshole,fe62yp7,t3_enspng,1578880607.0,"NTA Never have I been more confident with one of these posts. Imagine growing up as that child and finding out your parent didn't even refer to you as their son. That'd be so crushing; I'm glad you forced him to take ownership for his son despite your methods because even never knowing a dad is better than having one then finding out they don't want to be a part of your life like that. 

Admittedly, you could have gone about this a better way with less friction (you knew what you were doing) which makes you a bit of TA towards him and your son. In creating friction did you ever think of the effect on your son and his relationship with his father who he loves to see?"

MathHelp,fdklvdw,t3_elvy8s,1578506247.0,"With any equation, you have the left and the right sides of the equation equal to each other right? Such as 2 x 4 = 8 both sides are the same! This can be applied to your situation here, so long as the left and the right sides are equal or *can be made to be equal* you can write this in a solvable  form.

It's because you don't know the ticket sales you write it simultaneously to get an expression that relates the amount of tickets with the price of each ticket and the total gained. Hope this helps :)"

AmItheAsshole,fdd9npo,t3_ekodtv,1578301327.0,"NTA - As someone with a severe peanut allergy (hi bro ;) ), you handled this as any person with sense would have done. Could you have said it with a bit more thought? Sure. But it sounds like the guy was being ignorant to your allergy which is him basically saying 'so what if I'm leaving somewhat more lethal rat poison around your seat idc it's not my life that's at risk'; this isn't okay! He might not have been too clued up on allergies but that's no excuse to act defensive when he sat on someone's seats at half-time (who does that??) And littered massively in 15 minutes (again, why do people think this is okay?) And is then asked to move. You bought the seats so he should move. Good on you OP allergies are frustrating enough. I hope this is a lesson to carry an Epi-Pen at all times though, you never need it until you do so keep it lumped in a backpack and make sure it's at least kind of in date! Also, if you don't, carry a few antihistamines (like 4?) On you so you can reduce the effect of hives and throat closing long enough to get to a hospital so you can get the epi-pen treatment without wasting yours."

He's wrong to lash out at you for something your daughter said where neither of you had bad intentions.

MathHelp,fc2bc8i,t3_efsynf,1577350099.0,"You can do this because you're effectively multiplying by 1! If you multiply anything by 1 it remains the same right? And anything divided by itself is 1 this holds true for 13/13 or y/y or (numerator/denomimator)/(numerator/denominator). Your fraction wont change value because you're multiplying by 1, but you will remove the fraction at the bottom! You're doing this because you *can* and because it will mean you don't have a fraction in the denominator in your end result which we cant compare very easily to anything and isnt very useful ie (66/12)% isnt as nice to look at for us humans as 5.5% - they're both the same thing, one just has a denominator and that's why this is useful. I hope this helps :)"

MathHelp,fbzzjnr,t1_fbzz9g2,1577270400.0,"Nah I'm serious haha! Rounding to nearest 100 would be 50 and above, anything below 50 so 49.999999... would be rounded to 0 and your 90 comes in the upper half of this and is therefore rounded to 100. Rounding is done based on the 'middle' between your limits like this.
So if you're rounding to the nearest 100 and you have 149.5 for example, you compare this with 100 and 200 as these bound 149.5 on the number line. You take the average of these bounds then compare your number with them, so 150 in this case, you would compare 149.5 with 150 and *because* it's below the average, you round down. If the number was 150 exactly then you round up. Above 150 then you round up. 
Didn't mean to come across sarcastic, so I hope this helps :)"

MathHelp,fbxep4b,t3_eezjon,1577183464.0,"This seems to make sense to me and is how I would have done this problem! 

Just a note though: in a real world scenario you have to be careful doing this as the relationship between workers and a job isn't linear. Imagine you have 200 people on those 7 walls, depending on the walls and other factors they could just get under each others feet and adding more workers could make the efficiency worse."
AmItheAsshole,fbwel1i,t3_eeosdx,1577147866.0,"NTA - My girlfriend has an allergy to my dog... who has free roam about the house so I relate to this. My family treat her allergy very haphazardly but she carries an Epi-Pen so its severe enough! I constantly remind my family about this and they bat it away and now we're staying at her house more and more. My mum approached me to ask why girlfriend never comes over anymore, I told her she gets hives near the dog/house/furniture/general vicinity and she got defensive then went off in a huff.

Your mum is TA for not taking this seriously as it should be *BUT* you need to *really advise* her and try to convey your ideas about the allergy until they get through to her, otherwise you might end up like me and you might not eat at your mum's house or something down the line. If I could, I would definitely try and talk to my mum about preventative measures with my GF's allergy."
