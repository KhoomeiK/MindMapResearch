DIY,ffbd8cq,t1_ffb98ch,1579760422.0,"Yeah, such a weird way to preface this? They purchased, cut, sanded, and primed planks. Then they *hand stamped* each piece, going through painstaking lengths to make an aesthetic pattern. Then they spray with *5 coats* of sealer. Then glue and nail it to a wall for a look that... well, looks absolutely nothing like wallpaper. Ok."

Art,ffb9vis,t1_ffaw8iv,1579756630.0,I don't think it's intended to be sad. Eating alone isn't sad.

todayilearned,fe9jmxd,t1_fe6ghgx,1578938279.0,"I did, too. I was a room attendant for a year, and I heard some horrendous stories. But the note on the door thing is at least somewhat considerate, it happened to one of the girls. She went into a room and there was a note on the bathroom door, said something like ""Don't come in, I've killed myself. Call the the morgue"" or something. She didn't go in, and he had indeed killed himself."
todayilearned,fe6bbaq,t1_fe68wzf,1578886073.0,"Yes. And it goes beyond that, I think people who commit suicide knowing that a loved one will be the ones to find their body are fucking horrible. I know a girl who, when she was 11,  found her father's body in the basement of their home after he shot himself in the head. You don't come back from that, and she really didn't. What a disgusting, awful thing to do. Go to a fucking motel bathroom and leave a note on the door to warn the room attendant to not enter and call the authorities. Only way I can fathom not fucking up aomeone else's life."

therewasanattempt,fe0f4tv,t1_fe0e505,1578812333.0,"I don't even know where to start. 

First: Why in the *world* would you think that blaming people with kids and blaming capitalism for environmental destruction are mutually exclusive points? You're the only one who's said that.

Second: You're not doing society a favour by having children, and the very tone of your comment is exactly the mindset that breeds the woman in this meme. Is that what you thought when you decided to have kids? ""Hey honey, it's probably time to do our part to populate the next gen. I know there's eighty bajillion people on the earth and it's nearly collapsing under the sheet weight of all our failed endeavors, but c'mon it's our duty!"" 

Give. Me. A . Break. The more realistic scenario is this: ""Omg what do you think our babies would look like!?!?"" Enter baby (or 4). Meanwhile, tens of thousands of parentless children and babies that society has tossed aside rot in the social care system (assuming you live in a place where there even *is* a social care system, otherwise they're just plain fucked). No, no, though, you're right. Keep up the great work. 

Third: They aren't ""parent shaming"" (an absurd term btw, ""_____ shaming"" is a phrase which typically applies to a generally mistreated minority, not the vast majority)."

therewasanattempt,fe0akl0,t1_fe0acx2,1578807840.0,I know. It's why I said developed countries (where women have the luxury of the option to abort).
therewasanattempt,fe09v5d,t1_fe00o4q,1578807188.0,"Because having a child is in no way a ""selfless"" act, and by having one and then *also* trying to play a victim card, well that's a gross thing to do."
therewasanattempt,fe09rtu,t1_fe04dcb,1578807103.0,"I'm sorry, are you debating this or...? This is an absolute fucking fact. It's not an opinion, it's actual math."
therewasanattempt,fe09or6,t1_fe07h9w,1578807026.0,"It's the 2000's. Time to start calling it safe to say that people in developed countries have a choice in whether or not they are going to procreate. And it they're too stunted to use protection, then that's only doubly stupid."
therewasanattempt,fe09iyh,t1_fe03fzv,1578806879.0,"Yeah, that's what really irks me. If your spirit is that weak that your entire identity just collapses after you have a kid, then you have the audacity to have an ego about it - well then fuuuuuuuuuck you."
therewasanattempt,fe08hg7,t1_fdzxpcv,1578805940.0,"Right?? Having a child is the more selfish act, especially considering the times. If you want to raise a child, *adopting* is the selfless option."

DIY,fdjd1s4,t1_fdhwd1z,1578465837.0,It makes perfect sense that his father is an engineer because engineers tend to ignore bs convenience codes and focus on actual functionality. People who know less tend to focus on the former.

aww,fcojuu3,t1_fco27wn,1577834049.0,"I have never heard this, are you sure you're not assuming this from bad personal luck? It's my understanding that Siamese are known for their long lifespan (my vet actually told me this), having an average life expectancy of 17-20+ years. I know their weird head shape makes them prone to some dental issues but nothing a good diet can't prevent. 

I've had 3 Siamese over the past many years and the first two made it to 19 & 20, my cat now is 10 and has had zero problems. Anecdotal obviously, but I'm genuinely curious where you heard this?"

Ivanka & Jared's PR people made an idiotic tweet that makes no sense and people on reddit are rightfully having a laugh. It's okay, I'm pretty sure the child isn't reading this."

Of course it's fair to say that no, probably no one would know that they existed if daddy wasn't Donald, but sadly that's not the case so here we are."

The likelihood that every window and door to this building is compacted with snow is *extremely* slim (snow doesn't just fall vertically down and stay where it lands, there are so many factors that affect snow drifts around a building, I studied some of that in building science in college)."
