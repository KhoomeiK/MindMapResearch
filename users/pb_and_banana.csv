the most important thing is that you and your baby are healthy! of course nothing wrong with voicing how sucky it can be."

dogs,febds11,t1_fe9peae,1578957790.0,"same. people treat parks as an excuse to let their dogs off-leash! i live right by a park with a big lake, and there is a huge open area (meant for picnics and kids...) where people let their dogs run around. there is a huge sign at the entrance to the park saying all dogs must be on leash... but soooooo many people don‚Äôt follow it that it has become accepted. my dog is only 6 1/2 lbs so I wouldn‚Äôt let him off even if it were permitted, but i hate the fact that those dogs could potentially run up to mine. i‚Äôve even had a large dog come bounding towards us freely on the trail around the lake (where it is a fairly narrow trail and would be really hard to escape)‚Äî the owner was running to catch up. totally irresponsible."

Also I told myself even if I gained more than the recommended it would still be fine. Doctors way over emphasize weight gain in pregnancy.

dogs,fd75iti,t1_fd5f3w2,1578199698.0,"Agree strongly with the first part. Not sure where the OP lives but I am not used to street dogs. I was on a hike once and all of a sudden a big dog came bounding towards me. The owner had been walking with his dog without a leash but at that point I couldn‚Äôt see the owner as it was far behind. I literally screamed, which probably was not a good response but it was what my body did in response. So I guess I am quite scared of loose dogs without their owners, but that situation is quite rare where I live (both because there aren‚Äôt many strays and because leash laws are pretty strict in my area). I can see how it could be difficult to get over a fear when there is a valid danger around."
dogs,fd73ahl,t1_fd5j6s0,1578198899.0,"Ha, they learn, and they are typically stronger than you think. I have accidentally kicked my little dog many times as he is always underfoot. I have never hurt him this way. And somehow he always knows it was an accident!"
dogs,fd72orp,t1_fd5wml9,1578198681.0,agree. There are a lot of poorly trained big dogs as well as many poorly trained little dogs!
dogs,fd727qx,t3_ek3sar,1578198527.0,"I love all sizes of dogs, but don‚Äôt think I would ever own a dog bigger than 15-20 lbs (my dog is 6.5 lbs). I am a petite woman and like being able to easily scoop up my dog, and tbh I don‚Äôt think I could handle dealing with the size poops that come along with labs or other big dogs (even though I love the temperaments of many bigger breeds).  I also don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd want a 50+ lb dog in my bed, or want to deal with bathing a dog that big. 

So yeah I am a small dog person but really only for practical reasons. Thankfully my little dog is not aggressive in the slightest. He only becomes that way if a bigger dog tries to play rough. Today we were walking and another dog owner told me that his (young) dog loves little dogs... that may be true but the dog literally jumped up and put his paws over my pup, and my dog reacted with a snarl... which I actually think was the right reaction in this case. But in general he gets along great with better-trained or older big dogs."

Also a person could be financially stable when they get a dog and not stable five years later. Should a person relinquish the dog with the possibility that he or she would not be able to afford a major expense? We all know that having dogs is a wonderful thing, so have some compassion."

Her mom was an amazing cook and never used recipes. She loved to feed me when I was over. She made lots of delicious soups, and sometimes little fried savory pancakes. After school (middle and high school) sometimes we would just snack on cut up dried seaweed (she would say like keem?!) and hot rice! Oh and her mom would always peel oranges for us and take all of the skin off which I always found amazing!  Oh and there was the most delicious lemon tea that came as in a jar with syrup and rind that you mixed with hot water.  I don‚Äôt know the names for most of the stuff I eat but I still love going to Korean restaurants and trying things out."
dogs,fczj7sa,t1_fcy9pgz,1578102428.0,"I own a shop where I take my dog daily, and even I hate when others bring their dogs in without asking! A customer came in with her dog last week, and after a minute said ‚Äúwell I should probably pick him up because sometimes he likes to lift his leg on new things‚Äù. Ummm yeah. If someone asks I say yes as long as it doesn‚Äôt cause a big disturbance with my dog, who can get a bit anxious with other dogs in his territory (he‚Äôs only 6.5 lbs). Because the customer is always right, I rarely say anything. Except for one time when a dog was causing my dog to bark incessantly, and I did ask for them to go outside.  

Not asking is just rude. And really no one needs to bring their dog into a store‚Äî I only bring mine to breweries (that are very dog-friendly) and hardware stores (ditto)."
