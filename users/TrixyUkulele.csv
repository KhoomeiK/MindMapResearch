Kitty got left on our doorstep a week before our vacation & we couldn't find anyone to watch a 2 month old (vet's estimate) kitten, so we had to take her with us on a 6 1/2 drive to the coast. She totally freaked out & yowled non-stop in her cage for the first 1/2 hour. Putting her on Gary's shoulder (her favorite place) was the only thing that would chill her out. After she fell deep asleep, I was able to put her back in the cage on my lap and she was cool with it. Probably TMI, but because you have such a kind & caring heart, I wanted to assure you that (aside from that brief bit) our kitty traveled in safety. I (and kitties everywhere!) appreciate your kindness & concern  >;<   <3"
