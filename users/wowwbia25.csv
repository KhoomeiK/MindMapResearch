relationship_advice,fe0byan,t3_enjsyn,1578809188.0,a tracking app sounds very weird. in my last relationship we put on each others locations because we worked super late & wanted to make sure we got home okay. we’re a little younger than you guys tho. i think its somewhat weird & its okay that you aren’t comfortable with it. i would talk to her about it.

teenagers,fd7loyl,t3_ek9ehz,1578206411.0,"i dont think you should do it right after high school. but i think if you’ve met someone during high school, maintained a good relationship & are on a similar page, its okay to get married soon after high school"

relationship_advice,fcyrfjh,t3_ejlana,1578085510.0,try not to stress it too much. relationships seem like everything when you’re younger. you’re still SUPER young and have a lot to learn so just try not to let it control your feelings so much you know.
dating_advice,fcyr6s4,t3_ejlb0v,1578085378.0,do you guys have common interests? do you feel a connection? are you comfortable with her?
relationship_advice,fcyr13v,t3_ejlbc1,1578085293.0,wow lmao literally just block her and move on with your life. you both are so young and this is stupid drama. you’re both 13 for crying out loud. move onnn
relationship_advice,fcyq9xa,t3_ejleuq,1578084877.0,"im sorry. i know this is really painful. 

yes, this is the best thing to do right now. you guys aren’t growing and you should be with someone you can grow with. its going to hurt like hell but you both will be happy it happened. take this time to learn more about yourself.

if you guys are meant to be, you may meet in the future. if not, you will meet someone for you. both are okay. and eventually, you will be okay."
offmychest,fcurbmt,t3_ej14ng,1577986916.0,congratulations !! :)
teenrelationships,fcj88is,t1_fcj7q90,1577679752.0,im wrong. in my state it basically prevents minors from being registered as a sex offender if they had consensual sex.
teenrelationships,fcj6r76,t1_fcj5sqs,1577678659.0,nope it’s not illegal. its the romeo and juliet law i think
relationship_advice,fcckq7v,t3_eh2ft1,1577599522.0,"dont take him back. cheating is so wrong, you deserve better. he most likely will do it again."
teenagers,fc9ka4h,t1_fc99ehl,1577553915.0,it really is tbh. its much more passionate & the connection >> totally different w someone you have good chemistry w the person or you’re in love w them. can confirm.
teenrelationships,fc9j0c9,t3_egsyz4,1577553371.0,i would confess feelings first just in case. if all goes well then kiss!!!
ApplyingToCollege,fc6d0o9,t1_fc60jky,1577477685.0,i came here to say this.
teenrelationships,fc5ubdm,t3_eg9y4b,1577466056.0,"you talk, get to know each other a little more, listen to the same music, etc. when i went on my first one, it was perfect. we were too giddy to even talk too much. it kind of just flowed throughout the night. once the nerves relax a little, it gets easier"
teenagers,fc2vmzv,t1_fc2vfpx,1577375254.0,"schools don’t teach it properly for some reason. my best guess would be to just take advice from people who actually know what they’re talking about. unfortunately, with this you have to take the lead. if you have any other questions please feel free to ask !"
teenagers,fc2v39a,t3_efwf8u,1577374847.0,"you can get protection at gas stations and drug stores like target. planned parenthood gives out condoms. if you want to go on birth control, ask your doctor. if you’re too afraid to mention that you’re sexually active, you can explain you have painful periods, really long periods, etc. if you ARE alone at the doctors, you can ask for STD testing.

when i went to my gynecologist for BC, i mentioned that i was active at the time and i also had painful periods. the information is confidential and i got tested for STDs. you can also go to planned parenthood for this too. i hope this answered some of your questions.

EDIT: also. bc i saw “what do you do after,” CLEAN AND PEE AFTER SEX. this flushes out possible bacteria that could cause a UTI. girls are more prone to this. clean ! and ! pee !"
AskReddit,fc261bh,t3_efrp2r,1577341996.0,i feel okay but others i feel my heart breaking all over again
teenagers,fc25kxu,t3_efrusg,1577341407.0,this is so cliche but just be yourself. being nervous is okay. give yourself a pep talk before you go. after a little bit you’ll feel super relaxed and so much joy that you’ll forget you were even nervous. its such a good feeling. good luck !!!
teenagers,fc25fen,t3_efrvmh,1577341218.0,im sorry :( maybe things will work out in the future. enjoy your moments with her now

relationship_advice,fbzm6km,t3_efcggv,1577251459.0,"im sorry :( being cheated on sucks. you’re going to feel shitty for a while. it’s not going to be easy. cry, punch your pillow, roll in bed. do this for a little bit and let yourself feel the hurt. then, try talking to your friends and getting into new hobbies. know it isnt your fault. you’ll find someone who is meant for you. you will eventually be okay. if you need someone to talk to im here, OP."
