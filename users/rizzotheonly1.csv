depression,fefg9ax,t3_cml6ni,1579055688.0,"I don't want to live anymore. I'm just too exhausted and I'm only 26. How does it get better when we all know the older we get, it gets worse and harder and lonelier!? I feel that I will honestly never find a man that will actually stay and look after me. I am stuck in a dead end job as the only female so I am always doubted, always sore, always exhausted, lonely cause I'm not a male but I love what I do... the only family I have is my parents and younger sister in this country while the rest are all still back where I'm from and I fear for them everyday with what is happening there... plus I never really hear from them or speak to them cause we all moved on with our lives. I have been hurt and used by males over and over and it just fucked me up too much now. Everything is fucked."
AskReddit,fe4215t,t3_ennslu,1578855013.0,"Just because people are nice to you, doesn't mean they like you or that you can trust them (applies to workplace, uni, anywhere) SAVE for things instead of going into debt, make sure you have a back up savings for emergencies, get pet insurance unlike my dumb ass having to pay $1400 on getting her eye removed which if  I had insurance, would have cost me only 10% of that, IF THAT. Car insurance is soo handy too, it is totally worth it."
raisedbynarcissists,fdgeevr,t3_ekzhuo,1578392884.0,I am so sorry. What an awful experience... lots of love to you and please take care of yourself. Please distance yourself from people like that and love and nurture your precious self.
confession,fcbni1y,t3_egtp3e,1577588880.0,"To the person that posted this, I believe that you need to forgive yourself for what you have done with time. I think you are genuinely remorseful and NO, you do not deserve to carry guilt your whole life but YES, you do need to learn from this, help that family where you can and how you can and do something to help others. Forgive yourself. I believe in God and He does not want you to punish yourself like this. Your whole life is ahead of you. I will pray that you find the healing, forgiveness and wisdom you need. I will also pray for that family to forgive you and for them to connect with you so you can all decide together how you can be of any help to them. God bless."
raisedbynarcissists,fc16nfh,t3_eey0t4,1577309772.0,I feel like I FINALLY found my people/community in this group! I feel so alone with having a narcissistic mother and her controlling my sister to be like her. I am so tired. So very tired. My Christmas ended so sadly and bitter just like last year. I do NOT want to spend another Christmas with them but I do it for my dads sake. He is a good man and has to live with this every day. I feel so sorry for him. This fucking sucks.
insaneparents,fc02ggv,t3_eew8dc,1577275192.0,I am so sorry. I can so relate. Sounds like we have the same mother. Except mine does this sober.
Anxiety,fc012b5,t3_ef8g9d,1577272937.0,I had the shittest day today. My family is fuxked up. So dysfunctional and divided. It's me and my beautiful dad against my crazy sociopath of a mother and my nasty sister. I actual don't think I'll do this to myself again. I just cannot.
