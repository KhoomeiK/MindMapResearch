personalfinance,fezizij,t3_eqxi2h,1579457825.0,"When renting, make sure you understand the lease details and do not settle on anything until you've seen it for yourself in person. Pictures on websites do not give an accurate representation of what it entails. Also, take pictures of the apartment you rent and make sure you DOCUMENT EVERY issue to ensure you're not held responsible for repairs if you do move out. 

Find something within your price range but do not exceed your limits. Pay for what you NEED, not what you want. Be mindful of your spending habits. 

Most importantly, SAVE money. This makes a huge difference in any large future expenses. If you don't own a car and will never need to, take advantage. Walk everywhere you can, take public transportation, etc."
