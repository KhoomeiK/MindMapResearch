But thats not what the OP is doing. Shes working extra, to earn extra money outside of her monethly income, so as to not upset her balance of income and expenses.

I do the same thing when I want to buy a particularly fancy gun. Im required to work 50hr/wk so I bump it up to 55/wk, for however long until I get the thing. I go so far as to calculate my take home per overtime hour, and I literally tally on my toolbox at work how many hours I have to buy my thing.

A new CZ SP01 does not cost me ""$565"" is costs me just shy of 23 hours. New video game? Thats 2.5 hours. 

Though, a 2.5 hours is low enough that I wouldnt work more to offset the expense. But I do it with everything. If it takes me 1 hour to cook a meal plus $5 for ingredients, I am financially better off working 1 additional hour and eating out.
