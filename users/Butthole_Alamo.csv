>	Pepé looked suspiciously back every minute or so, and his eyes sought the tops of the ridges ahead. Once, on a white barren spur, he saw a black figure for a moment; but he looked quickly away, for it was one of the dark watchers. No one knew who the watchers were, nor where they lived, but it was better to ignore them and never to show interest in them. They did not bother one who stayed on the trail and minded his own business.

I’ve backpacked in the Santa Lucias range both before and after I knew about the Dark Watchers. Ignorance is bliss."

>	""It was a blank check to the president to attack anyone involved in the September 11 events—anywhere, in any country, without regard to our nation's long-term foreign policy, economic and national security interests, and without time limit. In granting these overly broad powers, the Congress failed its responsibility to understand the dimensions of its declaration. I could not support such a grant of war-making authority to the president; I believe it would put more innocent lives at risk. The president has the constitutional authority to protect the nation from further attack, and he has mobilized the armed forces to do just that. The Congress should have waited for the facts to be presented and then acted with fuller knowledge of the consequences of our action""."
HistoryPorn,fe5zio5,t1_fdn67ot,1578878417.0,">	Colonel Almers at the 135th (Fortress) Brigade was uneasy with the execution order, and approached Dostler again to delay the execution command. In response General Dostler dispatched another telegram ordering Almers to carry out the execution as previously ordered. Two last attempts were made by Colonel Almers to stop the execution, including some by telephone, as he knew that executing uniformed prisoners of war was in violation of the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War. His appeals were unsuccessful, and the 15 Americans of the commando raid were executed on the morning of 26 March 1944, at Punta Bianca, south of La Spezia, in the municipality of Ameglia. Their bodies were buried in a mass grave that was afterwards camouflaged. Alexander zu Dohna-Schlobitten, a member of Dostler’s staff who, unaware of the existence of Hitler’s ‘Commando Order’ had refused to sign the execution order for the American commandos, and was dismissed from the Wehrmacht for insubordination."

>	In 1968, Fred Rogers told Clemmons that while his sexuality did not matter to him personally, Clemmons could not be ""out"" and continue appearing on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, because of the scandal that would arise.[13][14] In the late 1960s, Rogers and others suggested that Clemmons get married as a way to deal with his sexual orientation, which he did.[15] His marriage to wife Carol did not work out, and Clemmons divorced in 1974 so that he could live openly as a gay man.[5][13] Rogers remained personally supportive of Clemmons, but required him to avoid any indication of his homosexuality – such as the earring he began to wear as a signifier – on the program.[13]"

Granted we’re not talking about murdering innocent people here, but still, I think we can hold law enforcement officers to a higher standard. If there is injustice, either within the police force or without, I would hope a law enforcement officer would have the fortitude to do the right thing. Even at the cost of their job. 


Maybe I’m being unfair, but it’s not like these guys are electricians, or biologists, or circus performers. They are law enforcement officers - protectors of our laws, our constitution, our bill of rights. They are the first and last line of defense against tyranny, and they enjoy the privileges that come along with that role. I expect more."

blursedimages,fc5o7tr,t1_fc5ahxa,1577462501.0,"Just to add on to this, there are three extant species of redwoods:

-	Sequoia sempervirens (i.e. coastal redwood or California redwood)
-	Sequoiadendron giganteum (i.e. giant sequoia)
-	Metasequoia glyptostroboides (i.e. dawn redwood). 

The **coastal redwood** is the tallest, and is the most populous, extending up the California/Oregon coast. It’s the species that is at Muir Woods, and Mendocino etc. where Return of the Jedi was filmed. 

The **giant sequoia** is the largest tree by volume and only exists in small pockets of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. There’s a great cluster of them at Big Trees State Park and Mariposa Grove in Yosemite. These are the trees you’ve seen people drive cars through. Their trunks are massive. In the 19th century, people would turn their stumps into dance floors with room for a band. Just massive trees. 

The **dawn redwood** was first described in the fossil record before it was rediscovered in China in the late 20th century. It is smaller than its cousins and it’s needles have a droopy, Willow-like appearance. 


Redwoods are amazing trees. Their bark is naturally resistant to fire and their wood is pest resistant too. Walking through a virgin stand of trees, you can see many of the trees have burn scars - evidence to their longevity and resistance to fire. Unfortunately for the tree, these qualities make it an exceptional building material. In the Bay Area where I live, most of the older houses were framed in redwood. In the hills above Oakland, huge, ancient, towering redwoods were logged in the mid-1800s to help feed the housing boom there."
