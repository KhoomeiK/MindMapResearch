This reminds me of something that mildly irritates me about that episode of Friends and anything on TV with a supposedly ""mean"" cat -- you can tell that ""Mrs. Whiskerson"" is actually a super happy cat. When cats are really happy, their eyes get all squinty and their faces can look kinda puckered/frowny. To anyone who knows cats well, it's quite recognizable as the face of a happy, affectionate kitty, but they always try to pass it off as mean/angry on TV."

BarefootandPregnant,fe619va,t1_fe5z3f5,1578879542.0,"I have to respectfully disagree.

While I understand that this community advocates moms staying at home (which I totally support and hope to do myself if/when I am blessed with children), I don't think it's the right time for her yet.

If she is depressed, working from home may not be best for her psychologically. Getting out of the house, interacting with people, and having a reason to bathe and get dressed may be big factors for her in her current state.

Working from home also takes a lot of discipline which it doesn't sound like she has right now. You have a lot more responsibility without the same accountability as working for/with others.

OP, are you involved in a church? Can you get counsel from your pastor? Do you have a doctor? Is it possible that you have postpartum depression? Counseling could be a life-changer for you. 

A mother controls the energy of the house. A home cannot be run smoothly by an unstable mother. I say that with love as I understand what it's like to feel buried by the weight of mental illness.

A good routine, counseling, and renewing your mind with God's Word may make all the difference.

As for right now, you can't wait until you feel better to take action. You've got to start now, not if/when you feel like it. Start chipping away here and there. Don't strive for perfection, just think of some small things you can do. Set a modest goal for yourself for each day, keep your word and see them through. Put some feel-good music on and thank God for giving you a home to take care of as you do each thing."

Sure, some people will ask - some people also said similar things happened to them too, or to other staff. Everybody can relate, and at least people knew what was going on - you were around the right people. 

I didn't like people knowing my business, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be, either. And don't forget, this is what we do. We help people when they need it. Remember to be thankful you were in a place where you were safe and people looked out for you.
