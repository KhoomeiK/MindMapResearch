I would still be childfree anyway, but the fact that I was stuck raising my little brother who is 7 years younger definitely was one of the many reasons why I am child-free.  My parents both worked and I do believe siblings should help with the little ones. But I do feel I did much more then I should have with always having to tend him and entertain him. I also feel there was a lot of gender-bias going on in my home. I am the only girl, and my two older brothers were never stuck with as much responsibility as I was with tending our younger brother. Again, I would be childfree anyway for many other reasons, but one reason why I am childfree is I feel that I have already raised a child and I did not enjoy it."

She is a large woman... over 300 pounds, so she didn't look different.  She didn't have morning sickness.  When she first started having labor pain, she thought it was her uterine tumor (that she already knew about... benign) acting up.  Because of her obesity, her menstrual cycles were never regular and sometimes non-existent.  

When the labor pains got severe, she thought her tumor maybe burst, so she left work to go to the ER.  After a quick exam, the doctor said he was going to send her up to Labor & Delivery.

She had NO idea.  She had a boyfriend (obviously) but it had only lasted a few weeks. 

She was consumed by guilt for a long time because she smoked/drank throughout her pregnancy.  (The baby was born healthy enough.)

At the hospital, she called her dad and said, ""I have life-changing news!""  He said, ""Oh geeze... Don't tell me you're pregnant!""

Montana,fds0sir,t3_emxg0l,1578692474.0,"I think one reason why Californians are disliked, and it's not their fault but I get it, is that they are driving housing prices way up here, especially certain towns.
