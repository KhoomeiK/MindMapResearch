bipolar,fdijg53,t3_elk9q0,1578444271.0,"When I was younger my mom would often think each medicine would have the same side effects.  I was on something when I was younger that if I had any alcohol I would projectile vomit. Now, numerous medications later, I can drink a little, but if I do it often, I lose my stability. Currently trying to recover from that. Feels like I'm starting my life all over from step one."
