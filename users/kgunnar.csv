If Bor Gullet is supposed to know if he is telling the truth, why is he still locked up afterward? It makes no sense and is the only part of this movie I really don’t like."

It is so well made and introduces a lot of great new elements into Star Wars canon while clearly being made with a lot of appreciation for what has come before. The criticism that I always see is that it doesn’t have enough “character development”. It’s a 2 hour Dirty Dozen style heist movie. There is not time for every character to have a complete arc. They have their specialties and do what is needed to complete the mission. I think the acting is great, especially Ben Mendelssohn. The only thing I don’t really like is the mind reading octopus thing. That scene seemed superfluous."

Also, don’t wait until the day you check out and leave a bulk tip - do it each day, as different housekeepers may service your room over the course of your stay. If you leave it all on the last day, only the housekeepers for that day would receive your tip. Finally, some hotels will leave an envelope for tips, so be on the lookout for those."
