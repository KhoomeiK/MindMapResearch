Street involves grinds on rails, doing tricks down stairs or over gaps etc.  Freestyle is all done in the parking lot.  I dont even know the names of most freestyle tricks as i never got into that side of skating but it's lots of spins and riding premo and using your hands to flip the board.  Also handstand tricks."

Researchers looked at data for 24 genetic disorders.  For 13 of these, incidence in purebreds was not different from that in mixed breed dogs.  For 10  of the disorders (42%), purebreds were significantly more likely to be affected.  Only for the incidence of ruptured cranial cruciate ligament were mixed breed dogs more affected than purebreds.

""The study demonstrated that for 10 of the 27 disorders examined, purebred dogs were significantly more likely to be affected than mixed breed dogs""

""The statistical statement of failure to find a significant difference between mixed and purebred dog populations is not the same as saying that a particular disease is ""equally common"" in mixed and purebred dogs, which is how it was generally interpreted by the press and also apparently many breeders. ""

""It is true - a mixed breed dog is not ""always healthier than a purebred dog"".  But it is the case - as this study showed - that purebred dogs have a greater risk of developing some of the hereditary disorders examined in this study than mixed breed dogs.""
