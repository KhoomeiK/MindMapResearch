facepalm,fex6q0n,t1_fex3i0f,1579425494.0,"You're also missing the point that even if the term was actually used in its intention it's blatantly sexist

EDIT: 

I'm not saying that this behaviour isn't something that some men do, but it's definitely not exclusive to men.

This is about the same as using a phrase like ""crying like a woman"" due to prejudices of women being more sensitive than men, which is also sexist."

Men MP ör till synes ett bra miljöparti, men i själva verket består dem av aktivister med åsikter baserade på icke-vetenskap och känslor. Att placera MP högst i ordning av bra klimatpolitik är ett skämt."
AskReddit,fcl7rai,t1_fckxqmd,1577741640.0,"I don't know anything about these terms in USA (which I'm guessing you're from?) but at least in Sweden becoming a nutritionist requires a three year university education, that actually has a scientific approach (e.g. nutritionists take at basic levels basically the same chemistry courses as chemical engineers). My partner went to the program and has great (and scientific) knowledge in food and health correlations.

EDIT: I asked her about the term and the word ""nutritionist"" is not a protected title. So indeed someone who calls themselves a nutritionist should not necessarily be trusted immediately, but if the person has a bachelor's in the area they most definitely has correct knowledge."
