unpopularopinion,feizyz4,t1_feitz3f,1579152072.0,"That‚Äôs already extraordinarily considerate of you. 

Having to buy business or first class just to avoid having your knees hurt seems unfair. I was born like that and cannot do anything (and don‚Äôt want to either). Maybe for 80% of people it‚Äôs not an issue and their knees are not literally hurt and potentially damaged. But as a consideration for people, I believe it would be polite and fair just to check with the people behind you if they don‚Äôt mind you reclining. I see it the same way as you would ask to people you‚Äôre with if they mind you smoking for example. But I know this is an unpopular opinion.

Edit: reclining my own seat is what I have no other choice but doing. There should be a rule in airplanes that reclining is only allowed at night or something. Or maybe people could just be considerate and not assume that just because you can, you should. It may be asshole design, but you don‚Äôt have to be the asshole enforcing the torturous aspect of the design."
