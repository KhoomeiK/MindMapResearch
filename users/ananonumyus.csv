The pinch point is only accessible and dangerous after bypassing numerous safeties."

Elevators,fdb2a69,t1_fdakiox,1578252930.0,"If the cables slacked briefly and the safety dogs engaged the rails then the car would *have* to be jacked up in order to tension the cables and reset the dogs. The weight of the car wouldn't be putting pressure into the system and it wouldn't lower when she pushed the lowering button on the hydro pump. It looks like she got the safeties to reset and was able to lower the car to be able to stand under it and fiddle with the slack cable switch, but the safety is visibly reset as there is play in plastic part that the switch roller sits in. If the safety dogs were engaging the rail that plastic bit would be stuck down and she wouldn't be able to play with it."
Elevators,fdawkio,t1_fdauaea,1578251198.0,"I agree, however there was nobody available to manually lower the car when it got stuck. The person recording at that time is wheelchair bound and it was only a little hop down to the landing. The risk was minimal."
Elevators,fdaqw90,t1_fdanssb,1578249080.0,"Oh she was definitely in the hoistway, under the car.  
I wasn't concerned about that passenger hopping out. The opening to the hoistway was under 3 ft, shorter than a guard railing.  
The pit below the lowest opening is likely around 7-12 inches, and after watching the video a little closer I can see ""toe guards"" ARE on the car. They are just a strip of sheet metal, painted black, and only hang below the floor of the car by a few inches. (@8:00) The sling is thicker than the amount the toe guard hangs down."

Elevators,fdai2qa,t1_fda6zxz,1578246353.0,"I agree, but OP isn't the woman in the video. I work for the company that makes this elevator and I'd like to note a few things: Toe guards ~~might not have been required by code in their state at the time of install and inspection.~~ ARE installed on this unit. They're painted black and very visible @8:00. That model's slack cable switch has been updated since that unit was manufactured (2011), and I don't have experience with it, but it could be adjusted properly. It was loose because the ropes must have slacked out briefly and the safety dogs might be engaging the rail, hence the reason why there was low oil pressure and she had to jack the car up first. The controller isn't that bad, they are less cluttered now, as some of the boards have been moved to the top of the car, and it could be untidy due to the installers or service techs cutting zipties and messing around. The main disconnect must have been adequate to pass inspection, as well. The certification is right on the door of the controller. Finally, do you mean temporary pipe stands for when working under the car?  
If the woman in the video has been DIY troubleshooting her elevator for as long as it seems like she said she was, she should definitely get it serviced by a real tech. The solution to the problem could be as simple as lubing the rails."
