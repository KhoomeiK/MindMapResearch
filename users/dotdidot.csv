ADHD,ffdl1to,t3_esusnt,1579823140.0,I flip over my pill bottle when I take it twice per day and put it upright when I go to bed. Helps wonders on weekends for me.
ADHD,ffdkbm9,t1_ffcy61i,1579822695.0,Used to drive me crazy when my parents would go did you take your medicine as soon as I got annoyed with them (usually with a valid reason).
ADHD,ffdjyfe,t3_esxnl6,1579822473.0,"Yes. I’m inattentive. Well when I first took it at least, my head suddenly was clear of this thick fog that was always there. Usually when I take it my body feels lighter, and the thick mud I usually have to swim through before initiating things feels less hopeless, more like I’m swimming through water instead, and on lucky days almost like air. My self esteem would be higher. But I do somewhat forget what it feels like without it until I run out st end of the month and have to go a day or two without it.

I take immediate release twice per day instead of extended release capsules. I felt the effect much much less with extended release."
selfimprovement,ffdinwt,t1_ffdhnfm,1579821680.0,"Hmm you might want to go see if you really have it then. A lot of times people learn to cope with ADHD and beat themselves up as lazy for the symptoms they’re genuinely not in control of. A lot of people make it through college fine by coping with it and get diagnosed well into adulthood. People also clueless of ADHD label difficulty to compete tasks as simply being lazy, which makes it difficult for ADHD person to seek help because they are ashamed that they’re voluntarily being lazy. If every stupid house chore, making appointments, making calls and such feels like you need to climb over a mountain before you can get your hands on it, odds may be that it’s a mental health  issue beyond your control.

Try lurking on r/ADHD and see if you relate to all our rambles about daily struggles with ADHD to see if you relate to it more than you thought. Of course it’s never good to self diagnose, so you should speak to a professional, just a suggestion if you’re wondering maybe you should get help."
selfimprovement,ffdh460,t3_esyh28,1579820738.0,"Reading experience if you actually have ADHD: Keep reading the same paragraph over and over without realizing you’re stuck in the same paragraph. Lost the line you’re reading. Forget what you just read as you finish that sentence. Can’t hear and notice anything around you when you’re really into the book. Forget that you even started that book when you close it the first time. Can’t even open the book from the fear of failure that all of the above may happen. Start neglecting reading from experience all above, or only do that for a while because you’re so into it forgetting all else...then feel like crap afterwords because you forget all else.

You can have ADHD without the visible physical hyperactivity by the way. It’s a type called inattentive. I have this and am a zombie without medication. So sleepy so tired.

As someone with similar experience, it could be depression, it could just be something else that’s emphasized because of the personality type you have... Either way it might just be good to figure out ways to rediscover yourself. See a psychiatrist. At least a therapist. Maybe try taking Myer Briggs 16 personality test as a place to start. It’s ok to change your interests over time, though I beat myself up for it all the time because I don’t want to let go what I think composes my identity."

If you’re already saying you want to come back in the beginning, they won’t feel the need to change anything. Try something along the lines of how you’d be open to consider it as an option, but only available to do so with a raise and additional accommodations. Get it in writing. Also, always ask for more raise than you’re willing to settle for.

And dollar above minimum wage for restaurant manager? Will you be assistant manager? Lead manager? Floor manager or handle everything? I don’t know what your minimum wage is and how busy and big the restaurant is, but I’d ask for way more."
SCREENPRINTING,fdiy6zn,t1_fdivmnf,1578453748.0,"300dpi is when I do 2px. I only do 1px and paint in where it’s needed when I really can’t catch anything. My printers notice the 1px difference, so I would recommend trying 2px. When you contract selection you can trap it more than when you use stroke by the way."
SCREENPRINTING,fdisik9,t3_ellh5n,1578450062.0,"Color separator here. Assuming this is 3 color and underbase with light blue, white highlight and black. Grab the whole shape of design without the background. Cut out the black ink area out of it, and contract what’s left by 2px. (You can do select>modify or use stroke). Add the white highlight areas back into the underbase.

Seeing that some blue areas are very detailed, for those areas I would maybe add back in an underbase that’s either not contracted at all or contracted by 1px instead of 2px. Black outlines should cover up any underbase peaking out if you hit it after flash, but you can expand the blue areas by a pixel or two if you’re worried.

You should print the black screen if you want to capture all the details.

That’s if it’s photoshop. Illustrator you can offset by 0.5-1px."
languagelearning,fdgw8hk,t1_fdg3vnn,1578409871.0,"I usually watch it on myrunningman.com, I like the fan subs because they match the korean text. It’s probably not official though so if someone knows of an official link with English subs please do share!

Also there’s more than 400 episodes, so you can google for best episodes and they can see if they enjoy watching it together! The recurring theme is an elimination tag and hide and seek war. Each member has a Velcro name tag on their shirt which is their lifeline, and they ran around a particular location (mall, museum, etc) trying to rip it off of each other. They also often have secret “spy” who’s task is to betray all the other members and complete their own agenda to win the game."
logodesign,fdfycir,t3_ekuwvi,1578373661.0,"Friendly neighborhood tip from a print shop art separator: always make your distresses bigger than you actually want on the shirt. Tiny dots will get squished together and disappear when printed. (There may be few oddballs like me who would open up the distress for you calculating this, but better to play it safe) Submit your art in RGB, not CMYK. 

Your distress actually looks fine as is for screen print though!

And on a shirt, that big text is going to end up on the stomach, which would look off balance. Try mocking up your design on a shirt before making future edits. Good design doesn’t always equal good shirt design. I would recommend splitting your design in half. Put the bottom half(company name and hot peppers) on back of your shirt, and the top half (devil and the quote) on front of your shirt. or put the text as small left chest placement and devil on the back.

P.s. it would be fun if the devil had a little hot pepper in his mouth or breathing fire."

languagelearning,fdftflt,t3_el3432,1578369760.0,Maybe they can watch korean shows (like variety or drama) and music videos with subtitles together? Will help your daughter learn korean and relate to her more as her friend picks up English if she can read the subtitles out loud for her.
