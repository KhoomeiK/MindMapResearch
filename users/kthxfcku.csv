BeautyBoxes,ff6a9af,t1_ff4x33d,1579622766.0,I’m a little salty that some of us did pay full price and all we got was the luxe box. Meanwhile other people got two boxes for the price of my one.
boxycharm,ff5othx,t1_ff4yk3h,1579603775.0,"I made five orders total, but based on previous experience not everything ships together or at the same time. I wouldn’t worry yet."
boxycharm,ff4prpz,t3_erktsj,1579569500.0,"I’ve only received shipping notifications for two orders, and they’re supposed to be here Wednesday and Thursday. I thought I had a third shipping email tonight, but when I opened it, it was a duplicate of the one I got last Friday. I’m not sure what to make of that."
BeautyBoxes,fex5dvn,t3_eqkwqi,1579424709.0,"I got a confirmation for my secondary base box, but not for my main or premium. I took screenshots of everything just in case."
notliketheothergirls,feqsk1k,t3_eqest5,1579345571.0,"I love Oreos, but only Oreos in a 48 hour period would have me feeling like crap."
BeautyBoxes,fel8viw,t1_fel4yvy,1579216595.0,"Yeah, that was March luxe. The other items were the Tarteist Pro Remix palette and another Sutra product. I can’t remember if it’s a curling wand or regular curling iron though."
BeautyBoxes,fel5sri,t1_fekv52u,1579214675.0,"I think the picture on MSA might be the bigger blush. It’s difficult to make out, but I think the weight on the box looks more like .15oz/4.2g than .04oz/1.3g."
BeautyBoxes,fekvn7q,t3_eppd3l,1579208538.0,I joined the waitlist at the end of October and did not get a premium box until this month.
boxycharm,fektg63,t1_fekqh3i,1579207246.0,"After looking at some swatches and being honest with myself about the likelihood of using the straightener, I chose the palette. I’m not upset at the idea of receiving more Avant. Any idea what it could be?"
boxycharm,feksjge,t1_feks747,1579206707.0,"Oh, I didn’t realize there was more than one size. They did that with the Glow Recipe though because the smaller one was still technically a full size item. I think I’m going to ride it out because I was just reminded that we’re supposed to get the watermelon spray this time."
BeautyBoxes,feksbaw,t1_fekrrmn,1579206574.0,"Same. I wasn’t excited about either, but I looked up some swatches and the colors are really pretty. Plus my relationship with heat tools isn’t very committed. At least I’ll eventually use the shadows."
boxycharm,fekqwwj,t1_fekqeso,1579205756.0,"Yeah I’m not super excited about either tbh. I honestly only wanted off the waitlist this month for the Too Faced palette. I’m interested in the laneige moisturizer, but everything else was meh. I told myself this month’s choice would be the deciding factor of canceling or not. Do we know if everyone gets the Hourglass blush yet?"
BeautyBoxes,fekpqbb,t3_epoo9p,1579205052.0,Lol I just posted the same thing in the Boxy sub. I want to hear what others think about the flat iron before making a decision. I’m not super excited about the eyeshadow colors.
boxycharm,fekpjlt,t3_eponun,1579204941.0,"Choice is open through this link but hasn’t shown on the main page last I looked. I don’t know what to choose.

https://www.boxycharm.com/premium-beauty-choice"
boxycharm,fekp011,t3_epmrwu,1579204617.0,Choice is open! https://www.boxycharm.com/premium-beauty-choice
BeautyBoxes,feklqwu,t1_fekll6v,1579202681.0,You’ve got good eyes! I zoomed in and couldn’t read it.
BeautyBoxes,fekl629,t3_epnwz2,1579202335.0,"I would be happy to receive this. I was hoping Blue Blood or Blood Sugar would be a potential palette, and if one of those lip colors is unicorn blood I wouldn’t be mad. What is that in the red box that resembles a Sailormoon transformation pen?"
jeffreestarcosmetics,fekkmnt,t1_fekg3z6,1579202019.0,"I haven’t received one from Beautylish, but it has shipped and will be here tomorrow according to my FedEx delivery manager. I’m hoping for either Blue Blood or Blood Sugar, but I’ll be happy with whatever I get because I don’t own JSC anything. I thought the lucky bag would be a good intro."
boxycharm,fejvrha,t1_fejorpw,1579186975.0,Add ons are usually separate. The only extra I’ve ever received in my actual box is the gift with purchase.
boxycharm,fejgop1,t3_epdaq6,1579173399.0,"I haven’t seen that weight yet. My second box was 1.6, but that included the weight of a free gift."
BeautyBoxes,fejgia2,t1_fej4dr8,1579173150.0,This variation is 1.2lbs.
BeautyBoxes,fejgehn,t1_fej462t,1579173002.0,I got this box too. I was so happy!
BeautyBoxes,feiet5x,t3_epa2gw,1579136849.0,"I received an email that it was on it’s way, but only two of my three items were listed. It’s being sent DHL too. 😬"
BeautyBoxes,feiehpe,t3_epa5ld,1579136634.0,I received this email 2 ½ hours after I was notified of my $5 refund. 😂
BeautyBoxes,feh59mn,t1_feh4ht7,1579109421.0,Northern Kentucky/southern Indiana area
BeautyBoxes,fego8db,t1_feftykx,1579098558.0,I just logged into my FedEx delivery manager to check on another package and I saw I have a label created for Beautylish! It currently says it’s expected to ship today and arrive by the 20th.
BeautyBoxes,fegar6a,t1_feg9mrz,1579085298.0,"No, they said the regular bag COULD but didn’t guarantee it necessarily would contain JSC products."
BeautyBoxes,fea67os,t3_eo8wgh,1578944827.0,"Your February choice will be in your February box, but add ons ship separately. Also Boxy charges the first of each month for that month’s box, with the exception of your first box. That charge is the day you sign up, so you’ll be getting this month’s box, and Feb. 1st is when you’ll be charged for February’s box. The replacement item should also ship separately, but those seem to take a while based on what I’ve seen other people discussing here.

For Ipsy, you will get February’s bag but not this month’s. I can’t remember when they charge you though."
BeautyBoxes,fe9xqr6,t1_fe9r5fm,1578942365.0,"I took a chance on it too. Usually even neutral stuff looks yellow on me, but the Becca sample they sent us seemed to blend into my skin pretty well."
BeautyBoxes,fdzt5b7,t1_fdxrw1a,1578795194.0,What happened with Wen?
boxycharm,fdsodp7,t1_fdsgrmq,1578705860.0,Sometimes we can figure out which box we’re getting if our shipment weight matches someone else’s unboxing. The problem this month is that there’s several variations that weigh 1.2 lbs so no one can be sure what they’re getting if that’s their box weight.
boxycharm,fdsn4hb,t1_fdsfb5c,1578705386.0,I got this box too. I’ll probably use everything but the liner pencils. I haven’t seen many variations with the face palette. :\
IncelTears,fdsluhc,t1_fdslhpb,1578704872.0,Elliot Rodger
boxycharm,fdrw07a,t1_fdrsuey,1578690590.0,I got lucky and got OP’s variation!
boxycharm,fdrh23y,t1_fdpbqwe,1578684474.0,Omg I’m so happy. My box came today and it was this one!
BeautyBoxes,fdqmny3,t3_emrytz,1578670288.0,Is your friend for hire? I’m terrible at gift wrapping and they seem to have a calling. 😆
BeautyBoxes,fdqmiyk,t3_emk1z3,1578670197.0,My fingers are crossed that not receiving any of these oops emails means I’m getting the highlighter instead. 🙏🏻
boxycharm,fdovz8j,t3_emhz7m,1578614129.0,"That sounds like a soft mailer’s dimensions, which doesn’t make sense."
BeautyBoxes,fdosmmg,t1_fdom83c,1578611969.0,"It’s always felt like they never actually read the first email, just skim it for key words or something and send a canned response related to whatever words they deemed important enough to notice. This has been my experience with CS everywhere, not just Ipsy. Nothing aggravates me more than when they reply asking questions I already answered in my initial email. That right there tells me they don’t read."
boxycharm,fdoroq5,t1_fdo3drz,1578611380.0,There’s so many boxes that weigh 1.2 this month. 😫 I hate not knowing!
BeautyBoxes,fdnjbn1,t1_fdnhhd2,1578587007.0,"I thought I saw something about the Becca foundation possibly being a choice item, but I don’t remember which box it was for."
boxycharm,fdnj197,t1_fdnin1s,1578586833.0,"I found [this link](https://help.boxycharm.com/contact)  waaaaaay at the bottom of the FAQ page. If that doesn’t work, @ them on their Instagram and they will reply."
boxycharm,fdnilvj,t1_fdmwps6,1578586576.0,It could be possible! I saw someone with a box that weighed 1.85 and I’ve never seen a weight to the second decimal place before. Also I’ve seen the same base box posted with a .1 difference in the weight already.
boxycharm,fdni478,t1_fdmc3tw,1578586282.0,Have you contacted them? It’s well within reason to ask about it at this point. Especially since they were using Luxe items in FOMO boxes and one item even carried over to base this month.
niceguys,fdm4fw2,t1_fdm3vzu,1578539552.0,Oh totally! I just don’t understand how the nice guy in the screenshot arrived at his conclusion when this crazy wife is clearly obsessed with her own husband and not someone else’s.
boxycharm,fdm34mu,t3_em3gv7,1578538680.0,Do you know the weight?
niceguys,fdm2myx,t3_em3ayv,1578538339.0,I had to look this up. Did I watch the wrong crazy wife? Because she wanted other women to back off her husband.
BeautyBoxes,fdlriyn,t3_em1c1v,1578530781.0,"I got Fab Fit Fun’s winter box just for this palette. 😂 I guess I’m choosing the eye cream because for all my good intentions, I never end up doing my hair."
BeautyBoxes,fdle2i3,t3_elwtw6,1578522039.0,Lucky! I got the KVD eyeshadow single. I can’t believe Boxy thought that was an acceptable alternative to ND.
BeautyBoxes,fdkvmfy,t1_fdkvbmn,1578512082.0,1.8 lbs
BeautyBoxes,fdku1cr,t3_elxawq,1578511149.0,"I got the same premium box. I was hoping I’d get the face palette, but I liked the eyeshadow palette too. Maybe I’ll get lucky and it will be an add on. 🤞🏻"
boxycharm,fdktqjp,t1_fdi2va7,1578510969.0,[Premium Variation 28](https://imgur.com/a/d4KvuP5)
BeautyBoxes,fdkbffm,t1_fdk92ml,1578500321.0,"Same here! I was salty af over losing that choice because I really wanted that highlighter more than anything and I don’t even use concealer.

I didn’t get the add on last month because at the time I had a second box and chose the palette, but then I canceled it when the other spoilers didn’t look so great. Then I FOMO’d and resubbed and can only hope the odds are in my favor. I should have just left things alone."
BeautyBoxes,fdjok9h,t3_elnmmi,1578480995.0,"The palettes should be available as add ons. I hope anyway, because I also chose Dr. Brandt, but I really want that pink palette too!"
BeautyBoxes,fdim1mk,t1_fdhy5ny,1578445915.0,"Yep. I just got a spoiler email on a canceled account. It’s either this spray, glow recipe, or the avant sleeping mask."
BeautyBoxes,fdilno5,t1_fdi37px,1578445671.0,But they sure sell it for adult prices. 😬
boxycharm,fdhqs5k,t3_elg98n,1578428338.0,"My premium is 1.8 lbs and I didn’t get a choice. My base is 1.2 lbs and I chose Dr. Brandt. I had a second account where I chose Scarlet Dusk, but then I canceled, and then FOMO about Scarlet Dusk and “what if I don’t get my coveted highlighter” took over and I resubbed and got the gift with purchase. That box is 1.6 lbs.

Premium should be arriving tomorrow so I can update with what’s inside!"
boxycharm,fdhps93,t3_elftq2,1578427749.0,My box is 1.2 and I chose Dr. Brandt. Please let this be my box. 🙏🏻
fatlogic,fdh5z9i,t1_fdgx4zu,1578416105.0,I hate how it’s infiltrated talk shows/morning shows. Idk if these people hosting actually believe it or if they’re just trying to avoid the social media backlash and subsequent public apology.
fatlogic,fdh498e,t1_fdh1h61,1578415048.0,Show him the TDEE calculator difference between your needs and his. It sounds like he needs a reminder that you are NOT a giant professional football player.
boxycharm,fdfpidf,t1_fdflvjs,1578367106.0,"I got the same one. I was hoping for the VV palette since I already had Celestial Thunder, but the box was otherwise a win."
boxycharm,fd9dkym,t3_ejuzi9,1578231947.0,"A few items came at the end of December/beginning of January, but most of my pop up came by Christmas. I think the later items might have actually been add ons for this month.

Do you have a FedEx account? It’s free and you can see inbound shipments to your address even if Boxy fails to email you."
BeautyBoxes,fd9cx4d,t3_ekbupo,1578231604.0,"Seconding this! I never receive shipping emails either, but FedEx will even text me updates."
BeautyBoxes,fd9cqcq,t1_fd9672f,1578231521.0,I have the same!
BeautyBoxes,fd9cgwf,t3_ekc4j3,1578231484.0,"I only have one label created so far. It’s 1.8 lbs and 11x10x4 in. I’m guessing it’s my premium based on another comment.

Edit: Base box is 1.2 lbs and 9x7x3."

antiMLM,fcxmo5s,t3_ejh4r8,1578066601.0,Lol but when I shop at Target or Sephora I actually get to buy things I want.
fatlogic,fcuxid0,t1_fcthu17,1577990508.0,Diet culture is the devil/sneaky. “The devil’s greatest trick was convincing man he didn’t exist” or something along those lines.
boxycharm,fcr05ao,t3_ei9fw9,1577894822.0,"I think I received last month’s box on the 10th. I’m in Kentucky and my shipments usually come from Georgia or Florida. I think I ordered a FOMO box (used a different account) on the 19th and it shipped the 26th and should be here Friday.

I haven’t had any of the shipping problems some others have been reporting so I’m wondering if that’s a regional issue. I’m also hoping I didn’t just jinx myself. 😆"
boxycharm,fcqyjpq,t1_fcpb04e,1577894138.0,I wear both so I marked all my color options as “wildcard”. So far I’ve only received nude lipsticks. 🤷🏻‍♀️
BeautyBoxes,fcqxijd,t1_fcpenui,1577893710.0,I was entertained.
BeautyBoxes,fcpr1rx,t3_eifgr2,1577870278.0,I think I signed up for the waitlist at the end of October and I’m finally getting a premium box!
BeautyBoxes,fcnszbz,t1_fcnsdhm,1577817830.0,"I would love that box!

They should send it. I know several people have said their gift is shipping separately, but mine have always been in the box. I wonder if the individual distribution centers just do it differently. You’d think the company would want some consistency."

BeautyBoxes,fclh875,t1_fclgfbi,1577747730.0,Premium didn’t have Saturday Skin though did it? I thought premium got Glow Recipe.
BeautyBoxes,fclayky,t1_fckirko,1577743652.0,I got this box just for the palette so anything else is a bonus. Fingers crossed I get the Violet Voss variation though!
BeautyBoxes,fclar9p,t3_eholhw,1577743519.0,Mine is scheduled for delivery January 3rd. I’m impatient.
BeautyBoxes,fclaktm,t1_fcl8v44,1577743406.0,"You got Luxe (Little Briar Rose plus Saturday Skin and Too Faced lip), so you’re just waiting on your premium now. You won’t get a base because Luxe replaces it. They charge you the base fee and then a separate Luxe upgrade fee during Luxe months, so that’s why you see three charges."
BeautyBoxes,fcla9kx,t1_fcl9f2k,1577743208.0,She got Luxe. Little Briar Rose is the big storybook palette.
BeautyBoxes,fc9acbx,t1_fc8kqox,1577549595.0,Mine is 2.3 lbs and the email says Subscription GWP Order.
BeautyBoxes,fberpgr,t1_fberfh3,1576792376.0,And no before picture for comparison either.
