LiverpoolFC,ff4lbqt,t1_ff4kj46,1579566388.0,"Indeed, I always thought there was a player there with him when he signed. The shirt looked too big for him when he arrived but he was a 21 year old kid and he just needed to settle. He did that slowly over the next year, and by the time 13/14 came around he was right up to speed and one of our most important players. Then he got that chronic heel issue which ailed him for a couple of seasons until Klopp came in and he has kicked on from there, showing leadership on and off the pitch. He's a magnificent captain and I hope he retires with us; and if he keeps going on like this he'll be remembered as one of our all time greats imo."

LiverpoolFC,ff3xxel,t1_ff1ivrm,1579551270.0,Agreed. He and Gareth Roberts there are excellent writers. They write as they would speak which is a difficult thing to do and gives a clarity that few supposed professional journalists can match.

LiverpoolFC,ff3u3cd,t1_ff3rwt4,1579548875.0,"He always was. Souness was a top midfielder in his day, one of the best in the world. He sees the talent in Pogba but is frustrated by his lack of drive, and for a man like him he can't get his head round it."
OldSchoolCool,ff16a11,t1_feyinvz,1579475607.0,"Yeah he took his hair loss bad and did wear a wig to begin with and had the old combover which a famous footballer back then also wore. He was only 19 though and we are all a little fragile at a young age. A friend of his made him realise the error of his ways and then he just accepted it and moved on. 

On Star Trek, yes to begin with he said he struggled, but then he and some of the other trained actors on the set began to act on the bridge like on a stage, and it worked; their chemistry grew together and they had a lot of fun."

Scotch,fdi1mxt,t3_elgjow,1578434139.0,"Ralfy still for me. I learnt so much from him my early whisky days, and he's still right up there as one of the best reviewers around.

Couldn't get into the German fella's stuff, though they did look like proper reviews. Used to watch maltman Mike for a bit as well for some of his silly stuff like taking a katana sword to a bottle of Haig Club iirc!

Roy is great as well, I used to be a regular on his streams (same with Scotch4Dummies) but I find myself just watching his recycled reviews now as I watch too many streams as it is so have cut back on my whisky ones. Both Ralfy and Roy I can relate to as they are fellow Scots and their attitudes on things in life.

Used to like the madness of WhiskyTribe and the other channel of theirs, but after a year or so I tired of them even though they are great guys and I've had some of my favourite youtube in general moments with them and their antics! Same with Scotch4Dummies, I was a regular there for a bit, but the peat guy annoyed me and that boring bourbon guy going on their live streams sucking the energy out the place so I've unsubbed from them too.

Never really watched whiskyinthe6 or ScotchTestDummies though see them around in the comments sections on multiple vids on other channels and they seem good knowledgeable guys too. I just don't have time these days to check up on everyone's channels so I just stick mainly with Ralfy and to a lesser extent Roy."
