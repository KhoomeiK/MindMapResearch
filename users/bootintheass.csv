AskReddit,fewnx4e,t1_fewn345,1579416287.0,"That can be said for any group. There is a ""snitches get stitches"" mentality as well. Should we just write off the whole group for that? Blame the ones who commit the act. If you try and burn the whole group the more they look inward for help. What motivation does a ""good"" cop have to turn in a ""bad"" cop. When the community at large still despises them and now they are seen as a rat by the other cops who might not be there to help when they need it. The problem with crooked/bad cops is they are still seen as doing more good for the community compared to wrong they are doing to the perceived criminals of society. Solutions not blame is what's needed. ""All cops are basterds"" solves nothing."
