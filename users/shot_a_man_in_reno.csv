You need a bunch of random and specific stuff, like having a science degree and being good at swimming. I think it would be fair to say that astronauts come from one of three categories: military test pilots, general military, and absurdly overqualified civilians. Test pilots from the Air Force and Navy are straightforward, and the initial astronaut classes were almost all from this category: you need someone to steer ships and stuff. If you want to be an astronaut, the most straightforward way is probably to be a test pilot with a Master's degree. Then there's general military, which usually draws on military officers with an advanced degree of some sort; they're required to be in great shape already and have technical skills that NASA likes. The military academies also have mechanisms for sending their top graduates to get advanced degrees from prestigious civilian institutions, and there are plenty of graduate opportunities within the military as well. The civilian astronauts almost invariably have doctoral degrees in some field that interests NASA (geology, oceanography, aerospace engineering -- though any science degree would qualify, and obviously having medical doctors aboard the ISS is nice) and some intense physical background helps -- think professors or postdocs that play a sport or have to work in extreme environments of some sort.

todayilearned,fdaj82d,t3_ekdvsr,1578246656.0,"There are some really, really bad incentives in science (and, more generally, academia) that are rarely talked about in public.

To make a career in academia, you have to make an *original contribution that influences the field*, practically by definition: papers are assessed by how much they are cited by other researchers (i.e., impact). Ideally, making an original and influential contribution happens the way we all like: you make some *important discovery* (or *invention*, such as a new method) that pushes the field forward. A true invention or discovery is difficult. However, there is an alternative.

If an individual or group spends years and dollars working on a project that yields no important results (and this happens all the time), what do you think they'll do? They have two options: give up and admit failure, or report *something*, taking advantage of the fact that they're the only ones who completely understand the ins and outs of what is probably an extremely complicated combination of methods and data that would take years and expertise to reproduce.

Note that, in this case, the reproducibility problem may come from two sources: the first is p-hacking (performing a bunch of tests and tweaking conditions until, by chance, you  get something); the second, which is less often discussed, is that the researcher may not be aware of, and thus may fail to report, all the factors that led to a successful outcome (in one biochemistry experiment I heard about, choosing whether to shake or stir a bunch of cells was the difference between success and failure, for some reason; the original group reporting didn't think the fact that stirring their cell solutions was important and so didn't write it down).

This rarely comes from a place of deliberate dishonesty by researchers, but rather from the fact that researchers are tenacious and competitive people that don't like to admit failure. Literally nobody would just give up on a project if they initially fail to find anything, whether or not there actually is anything to find. They would just continue to apply more and more convoluted methods until some results were found. This is a problem with science generally.

The closer you get to the softer sciences, the worse it gets, because the softer a science gets, the more difficult it is to prove or disprove assertions (economics and psychology are really bad about this in my opinion; proving or disproving an economic theory can take decades). So, making an *original contribution that influences the field* becomes less a matter of discovery (or even being right) and more a matter of being really, really good at writing, advocating, and arguing. This is how you get smart, important professors that are full of it, which every field has its fair share of."

The CIA and US military figured out who he was after he got arrested, but never said anything due to the potential embarrassment."

videos,fcb7i8u,t1_fcaqp6y,1577583369.0,"Aside from your edits and the point about the notebook (yeah, I'll give you that it's a bit of a *Se7en* trope, but whatever), I didn't really see that you made a point based on specific examples in the movie; you just made blanket statements that it was superficial and such. Saying things like ""the film fails because of its own hipocrisy"" and ""it was reductive and and shallow as hell"" sounds meaningful, but I don't think you qualify either of those statements effectively.

However, with the points you bring up in your edit (which, you're right, I didn't see), I disagree with a few of those, and I think you're oversimplifying the way the movie depicted things. It does depict some of the bullies as bad guys (like his boss and the guy that gave him the gun), but it certainly didn't depict the social worker as a bad person; she was just underfunded, and her moment of honesty with Arthur was a very good scene. Nor, I think, did it depict Thomas Wayne as a bad person; the movie made it clear that the Arthur and his mother were in the wrong with regards to Arthur's parentage. Thomas was a public figure in a complicated position; from Arthur's point of view, he was a jerk, but we're also made perfectly aware that Arthur's point of view isn't totally reliable. Thomas was entirely justified in punching Arthur in the face (the guy had come to his house and touched his son), even while the scene in the bathroom made it clear that he had some degree of pity for Arthur, because Thomas knew how crazy his mother was and knew, from the news years earlier, what he had been through. With regards to the murders, Thomas was right to talk about it as a tragedy, while Arthur was justified, from his own point of view, in thinking it wasn't, because he had seen how they treated him on the train. The dynamic between Arthur and Robert De Niro's character (Murray) is similar, but not quite as fleshed out; that Thomas Wayne and Murray are hated by Arthur does not mean that they are villains, just that they are imperfect characters and he is envious of them. What you're not respecting is that Arthur, in the film, was a very unreliable narrator, and while *Joker* did a uniquely good job of making his point of view clear, that was not the only angle that the film was trying to show; it characterized the discrepancies between Arthur's worldview and reality very well, in my opinion.

Joaquin's bad dancing, which you mention, is another way the film shows this discrepancy between Arthur's view and reality. The dancing is lame. It's supposed to be bad. We're cringing. But we also see that Arthur *thinks* he's being cool. In his world, he's awesome. So the audience simultaneously sees how everyone views Arthur as lame (like the police officers looking at him in a confused way, or Murray humoring him while thinking ""what a fruitcake""), but that, in his own head, he's dominating. And that's what makes him scary: he's becoming more and more unhinged from the reality of his own situation, and he's starting to act on that. In reality, unhinged people aren't seen by others as *cool* (a la Hannibal Lecter). They're lame and unsocialized, until they act out on violent impulses, which is when they become, in others' eyes, scary. And that's exactly what happens at the end of the film: through violence, Arthur becomes a legend in the eyes of others. It's a similar motivation for some school shooters.

Anyway, I typed up too much on this. Hope you get the point I'm trying to make about the film."
videos,fcap0w8,t1_fcalrb0,1577573699.0,"I think if I were a geneticist or palaeontologist complaining about the inaccuracies of Jurassic Park, I'd be obnoxious, failing to see the bigger picture: it inspired a whole generation of scientists. In my opinion, good art that takes artistic liberties about a particular field usually does a better service to that field than poorly made art that is completely accurate. Artistic license has a purpose.

That being said, there are things I like about the depictions of his mental disorder. The Joker's PBA coming from head trauma (which, in the film, he endured in childhood) is completely accurate, and this is likely independent of his other issues. I also liked the depiction of his suppression of memories of childhood abuse, which is also something that can happen. And the fact that it happened in the context of a codependent relationship with a narcissistic mother. It's all a formula for an isolated and abused individual. Furthermore, why is his journaling in a scary notebook a bad thing? People journal in real life, and it's used as a device for film to portray his lack of formal education (poor handwriting) and obsessiveness. He was not depicted as an unempathetic psychopath as many villains are, though he became unempathetic at the end of the film. The delusional fantasies about his neighbour were a bit of a stretch, but, again, it's a device for entertainment.

In terms of a specific diagnosis, though, I don't really know what you're expecting. A scene where a qualified therapist tells him he has schizophrenia and PTSD and gives him medication? The PBA is straightforward, but everything else is just the result of years of abuse and poor upbringing. But asking for a specific diagnosis is also missing the point: they want to show the life of a sad and isolated individual who never got a fair shot at life, which is something that happens a lot in modern society but is rarely depicted in an artistic medium."
videos,fcajhxf,t1_fc9yney,1577570379.0,"I'm doing a PhD in neuroscience, and I think it did a good job. Obviously, it's Hollywood, so there are licenses and oversimplifications, but in an era of school shooters and incel culture and echo chambers, giving the general public a view of how an isolated, abused, and humiliated individual can be motivated to act out, is a good contribution. Other films that may be more factually accurate but less engaging (like Gus Van Sant's ""Elephant"") may not leave general audiences feeling as though they have a visceral understanding of the underlying mentality there. You didn't offer any tangible criticisms so I can't know entirely what you mean, but calling everyone sheeple is not a substantive argument."
videos,fc9hh2j,t1_fc99x7z,1577552740.0,"Ledger and Phoenix just had very different roles, though. I think the Ledger/Nicholson comparisons were fair because they were both ""Joker - villain of Batman"", but Phoenix's Joker was an in-depth character study, used more as a device to explore mental illness. In my opinion, the expectations for Phoenix's character were a bit more straightforward given the script, and he had a lot more room to sink his teeth into that role. Ledger, on the other hand, was walking on a knife's edge because there was so much opportunity to mess up and get it wrong (see: Leto), and everyone expected him to when the casting was first announced. He had a lot more fan negativity to overcome. So, I think Ledger did a much better job when viewed in context, but comparing the roles in and of themselves is a bit like comparing Hannibal Lecter to R.P. McMurphy."
