summonerschool,feh77zp,t1_feesp29,1579110593.0,"This is so frustrating as a gold jungle.  I feel like I NEVER get help warding or invading enemy junglers.  There have been times I've invaded the enemy while both my bot and mid are pushed up to the enemy tower.  I'll run into the enemy jungler, and I'll get killed by one of the enemy laners just to look and see my laner farming (note: these are times when we could have definetly won a 2v2 if the laner would have just rotated and helped me).  I know I make my share fair of mistakes but it feels like I'm completely ignored in 99% of my games unless one of my laners needs an excuse as to why they lost lane."
summonerschool,feh6hkq,t1_feh2fqg,1579110155.0,"To be fair the smite holds two charges lol, not excusing anything else in the above comment but it's funny to me because I've had people try to flame me for smiting like 20 seconds before drag is up just for me to ping that it'll be back up in like 15 secs."
summonerschool,feh604z,t1_fegjfrv,1579109863.0,Towards the end of last season I tried to get better at not doing that (first season playing ranked 'seriously' and bounced between gold 2 and gold 3) and it's annoying.  I would play jungle and be farming and trying to get vision while no objectives were up and my team would just be roaming around as 3 or 4 and end up getting killed in the river for no reason. And then ofcourse I get pinged for not being there to fight in the river for no reason.
todayilearned,fdnt59j,t1_fdnrn6f,1578592313.0,"Lol pal I'm not arguing about whether or not the comparison is accurate.  You looked like an edgy 12 year old coming out of no where comparing it to comic books.  I was just explaining to you why you got down voted as you sounded pretty upset in your edit.  Also, the neck beard atheist thing wasn't a personal attack on you, I'm sure you're a lovely guy in person, but that's what you sounded like when you just randomly spout out how religion is like people arguing over comic books.  Everyone cares about different hobbies and beliefs to varying degrees and it seems childish when you or anyone else randomly discards those for seemingly no reason.  No one is, or was, mad or downvoted you because you said god was fake.  They did it because the 'joke' was shitty and no one cares lol."
todayilearned,fdnr6sr,t1_fdnggsa,1578591240.0,"Usually (ofcourse not always) the smaller, local churches tend to be alot better about actually being charitable and helping the community.  This is just anecdotal though and coming from my own personal experience of growing up Baptist."
todayilearned,fdnqu6i,t1_fdngq6j,1578591071.0,"I don't think you're getting down voted because you said god isn't real.  It's more likely because that joke you just made was cringy and didn't really add anything to the conversation.  Lol tbh it makes you sound like the stereotypical fat, neck bearded atheist (with fedora ;-) ) that everyone likes to make fun of."
leagueoflegends,fdm2huk,t1_fdluchw,1578538244.0,"Also as opposed to flaming over text chat, in voice chat you actually have to audibly communicate with whoever you're flaming.  Which leaves the 'flamer' vulnerable to then being either told to fuck off by the rest of the team, or just muted and ignored.  I used to play alot of rust, and its alot less upsetting and annoying when you realize the 'guy' flaming you is just some 12 year old kid (or even some 20 or 30 yr old cry baby)."
leagueoflegends,fdm25cv,t1_fdlqsns,1578538011.0,"I've got upwards of 700 or 800 hours on NA csgo (can't remember exact numbers) and honestly can't remember a time when someone was exceedingly toxic or yelling or anything.  Looking back it's actually kind of odd at how polite most people were.  From what I can remember usually if someone did start to get toxic the other 3 or 4 people with mics would typically tell them to be quiet or just outright mute them and play without communicating with them.  The highest rank I reached was DMG though so maybe it was just something with the ranks I was playing with/against.  And yeah, sometimes I would encounter foreign people but even then, the same as above, either everyone would tell them to fuck off or they'd mute them."
leagueoflegends,fdm1pb6,t1_fdllzbw,1578537711.0,"It'd be alot better.  I wouldn't mind joining someone's discord and voice chatting (I played a ton of csgo and always enjoyed voice chatting with my team).  However, I've found that joining random discords ALWAYS sucks because either: there's a ton of people talking which may or may not be playing the game with you and, unless you immediately mute it ,some discords can be very noisy.  I've never joined some random persons discord and left having felt like I had a good time"
leagueoflegends,fdm1dlu,t1_fdlot3f,1578537493.0,"I've found a dead give away is that if you make them mad they'll immediately make fun of your mom in broken English.  Which is hilarious to me. I wonder if it's some cultural thing but it is always something like ""that why your mom die"" or some shit lmao."
summonerschool,fdh7pkg,t1_fdgri19,1578417181.0,"I've got two groups of friends: one uses teamspeak, the other discord.  Teamspeak is still popular mostly for large groups of people or for servers in games like Gmod, Arma, squad, ect.  Honestly I prefer teamspeak because I feel it's much more manageable/modifiable, it just lacks a very good text chat function"
leagueoflegends,fde96xk,t1_fdc80ek,1578333937.0,"LOL it has nothing to do with investment in the game.  It has to do with controlling your emotions.  I've been playing games since I was a child and have/still do play alot of 'toxic' games (600 hours in rust, nearly 1000 in csgo, and also a bunch in league).  I have never broken something, been banned, or had my feelings hurt by a game.  It's just a video game.  I think it would help if people just got hobbies that they care about outside the games they play.  I lift and do alot of different activities with my friends outside of games and I've found that I'm always alot more calm and relaxed when playing games than people like my roommate whose only hobby is video games. (Should note: yes I am also competitive in the games listed, just able to be competitive without banging my fist and acting like a child)."
politics,fcn7tz6,t1_fcn55mo,1577805521.0,"As someone who grew up hunting (shot my first deer when I was around 5) it can actually be beneficial for a number a reasons to start younger kids out hunting.  I've been around guns (mostly hunting rifles, shotguns, and some pistols) since I was a kid, and being able to shoot and hunt with my dad has allowed me to grow up with a good understanding of how to safely handle and fire guns.  It also taught me how to hunt and clean animals; as well as, what I concider to be, proper hunting etiquette (safety towards fellow hunter, respecting the animals, and only shooting something you intend to eat).  People outside of the south hear about ""kids shooting guns when they're only 10 or 11"" without understanding how prominent hunting and fishing is.  It's basically a community bonding activity and some social events revolve around hunting and fishing (for example: fish cookouts are common, as are dove shoots) From my personal experience, myself and all of my friends who grew up shooting from a young age have much, much more respect towards firearms than some people I know now who purchase and carry just because they're 21 with no prior firearm experience.  Whenever you're surrounded by a culture of guns, it's much more beneficial to teach your kids (that will eventually come in contact with a firearm) proper firearm training than to try and wait until they're older."
leagueoflegends,f97fsde,t1_f96zxei,1575165006.0,"I can say that the quality and interest definitely varies from school to school.  The main 'fans' would be (and usually are) fans/students of that college.  Some schools are super fun to watch as they have dedicated coaches as well as their own amateur casters and I could see them being interesting to most fans of league of legends.  However, some schools/teams would definitely be boring to watch (my team being one of them lmao) mainly just because of lack of interest, skill, and quality.  The average collegiate team would probably be boring unless you REALLY liked league because it's just basically teams of about mid plat to diamond players playing against one another.  However there are definitely some schools that get it right and can really perform.  I would definitely love to see it grow and gain alot of fans but I think it's gonna be a slow process"
