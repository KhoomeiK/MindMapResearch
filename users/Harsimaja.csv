badlinguistics,ffa01xc,t1_ff9xfcd,1579725148.0,"Define ‘significant’. Basically, yes, but less so than in England outside NI and southeastern Lowland Scotland. Genetic analysis does bear out a much higher rate of what we take to be this in England than Wales, Scotland and Ireland (and some areas like Cornwall and the NW have less than most), as expected. 

There are traces of the Viking invasion too. Within Scotland it varies: as expected, the Shetland Islands and Orkneys have more, and the Lowlands have more Germanic admixture than the Highlands. As expected, Northern Ireland and the old ‘Pale’ have different structure (frequency profile of haplotypes) from the rest of Ireland (see see ‘the Irish Atlas’, 2017, forget who). 

On the Y DNA side, there are two telltale haplotypes particularly common among - but not unique to - IE speaking people: R1a and R1b. The IE migrations seem to have amplified these (though effects of these waves are less amplified down the female line rather than male), but they existed long before IE. A particular strain (M269) seems to have come from the British Isles, and may or may not have developed among Insular Celts - or more likely developed elsewhere and been amplified among them. It is found mainly in Celtic areas. It’s interesting that there is one obvious phenotypic marker common among Insular Celtic nations too, red hair. But both of these seem to predate the Celts and may have been down to a pre-Celtic group either from Britain or just amplified or ‘bottlenecked’ there - the Celtic language family per se being from the continent too, with the two appearing in good measure before further invasions and coincidental amplifications made them seem to correlate so strongly. So R1b and R2b predate and just correlate with IE folk (but can even be found in China and Chad... due perhaps to Iranians and Tocharians or some much earlier unknown migrations?) while R1b M269 may predate and also just correlates with Celtic people. 

And even then, we say ‘Celtic people’ when most don’t speak a Celtic language at all any more, further underlining how independent language and genetics can be..."

badlinguistics,ff9ue1a,t1_fcnaxvr,1579721560.0,"Not easy, because there isn’t a simple genetic marker for ‘Celtic’ and ‘Germanic’ - all a mix, and these groups had split only a couple of millennia before in any case, and we don’t know exactly what markers to compare. The genetic data are... mixed. The UK certainly has inherited a large amount of its DNA from a very ancient population of the British Isles, but exactly how it moved about? You have in any group many different markers and individual variation is extreme, so we have to use very complex statistical techniques and computation to figure it out, and we have to use several assumptions so different methods lead to very different results.  From Y chromosome DNA there seems to be a higher representation of a more recent wave in England that we assume would be the Germanic invasions, but this is in terms of comparing multiple factors in a large (hard) cluster analysis of many different features and frequencies. This is less pronounced in mitochondrial DNA (which goes via the female line only). They may have displaced the ‘Celts’ gradually by mass murder or causing them to flee in some parts, or by several generations of upper class or warrior men getting more women. The autosomal (mixed) data are somewhere in between but as usual are mixed from so many markers that it’s hard to say. And because of the assortative mating it’s not clear that the proportions now correspond to the proportions over a millennium ago. This isn’t even touching the different techniques and assumptions that might be used to *model* how to interpret all this.

The pre-Anglo Saxon invasion Celts themselves had DNA from earlier, surely pre-IE groups, since we have some genetic material from prehistoric remains to compare to (not much). Some may well have been closer to some pre-IE folks than to Celts on the continent - and that’s true between almost any two groups anyway (simple example: any Icelandic man has a whole chromosome more genetically in common with a Nigerian man than with an Icelandic woman. It matters *which* genes change across groups, and some more than others.) 

It’s only due to very recent research that we’ve started to strongly suspect (again) that the Bell Beaker culture really did wipe people out in Western Europe, but even this is disputed. But even *that* wouldn’t mean that the Bell Beaker people were ‘pure’ Proto-Indo-Europeans. 

History is full of narratives of massive waves of invasion killing off and replacing the native population that turn out to be only replacements of very small elites, and by and large the major invasions in European history have left the original gene pool largely intact - mostly male warriors move, peasants and women mostly staying put and intermarrying and adopting most of the elites’ language and culture. Historians were just more interested in the former.

That said, there ARE examples of full replacement. The New World being an obvious massive example. And sometimes it might be in between - seemingly the likeliest case here - and thus even harder to tell."

If anything I’d argue the clash of American and Hollywood lifestyle and values may have had a lot more to do with it, given they provide the background to the comments that led to the two waves of backlash. A wholly different attitude to celebrity life, political neutrality, and American values that fundamentally clash with monarchy (and which I wouldn’t say I entirely disagree with the Americans about this!) But do you believe it was racism that led to the unpopularity of Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson? 

You seem to think that linking to an article that agrees with you is the same as evidence, even though the articles just assume this opinion from the start...

Many of my friends make similar comments, so I don’t think it’s a big deal, but it was unprecedented for people who avidly follow the royal family.

I don’t have a problem with her, and wish them both well, but it’s dogmatic to assume that everyone’s issue is about this and that doesn’t gel with the facts. No one should be immune from criticism just because any criticism would be branded racist.

I remember one post noting a lot of young people at their polling station and wondering if things would go as expected. That’s about it.

badlinguistics,feo12ds,t1_fddvqen,1579293606.0,"I don’t think they’re using it to indicate it’s nasal. Per my book and what I see online, Polish *orthographical* nasal vowels before plosives and affricates actually have evolved to orals followed by nasal consonants, like that, in practice? Not sure if this is a dialectal thing, and I’m not Polish. 

There are a lot of IPA transcriptions in English I’ve come across even about my own dialect and accent which I haven’t believed because my impression is phonemic or even just orthographical, assuming whatever it is ‘must be there’, when this hasn’t been the case and I’ve swung round to believing them. Don’t know enough to assume this is such a case, and dialects complicate things."
badlinguistics,feo0m95,t1_fdf9i6j,1579293545.0,Both my Polish book and Wikipedia say that in modern Polish the nasal vowels are realized as oral vowels followed by actual nasal consonants before plosives/affricates (homorganic with that plosives/affricate). So this seems to be correct?
