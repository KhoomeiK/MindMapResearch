The ""dehumanizing terms"" that are used also serve a purpose. Not only do they make it easier to kill them (which is pretty important in war) but also takes out any ambiguity. 

This is another one of those ""disagree with the war, support the troops"" type things. War SHOULD be a ""break glass in case of emergency"" type thing.  We want people who will win to be in charge. Because it should be a dire circumstance when we need it.

For that reason, the dehumanizing in my opinion is appropriate.  But also why it shouldn't be the decision of these people whether to go to war or not.

We don't want sociopaths but if they are all full of feelings and don't make the best tactical decision, that's not smart either.

I spent a long time in the military and I'm well aware of what war jsz and I don't want any more.  But the conditioning we go through I think is important."
