FragileWhiteRedditor,fcywqug,t1_fcyuv42,1578088766.0,And every post has the exact same comments from the exact same people. Granted there‚Äôs only about 700 of them in it. I couldn‚Äôt imagine living my life so scared and angry about everything.

FragileWhiteRedditor,fcyo5z9,t1_fcxq4pz,1578083721.0,Based on their posts it looks like they‚Äôre going for record time. It‚Äôs amazing how many safe spaces these people need to spout their bigoted garbage. Has to be a sad and lonely existence.

worldpolitics,fcxa2t9,t1_fcx6rfy,1578056981.0,Most people I see using the term are democrats who have all interacted with Bernie supporters and know what they‚Äôre like. His supporters are exhausting and more often than not turn people away from supporting Bernie. His supporters are the worst.
FragileWhiteRedditor,fcvv30k,t1_fcukhmz,1578010767.0,Basically a group of people who want to claim everyone here is either a bot or an actual racist. That sub is pretty hilarious to skim from time to time. They‚Äôre all pretty darn fragile.

gay,fcfd815,t3_egx25k,1577628841.0,I love how the focus is on the lack of benefits from gay sex. Homophobes are always so obsessed with the sex aspect. I swear they often care more about gay sex than we do.
