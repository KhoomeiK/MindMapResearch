timberwolves,ffd4zzl,t3_esypt8,1579813534.0,Maybe we need all half time conversations to be one way from now on. Maybe our noticeably shitty 3rd quarters all season have been due to Saunders wanting to make everyone feel equally included instead of telling them what he needs to see from them.

I don't think they are officially in a rebuild, despite where they sit in the Eastern conference right now.

It really put into perspective for me that the careless way I ate and lounged was upsetting because it meant I didnt love myself or value myself enough into being more intentional. My barometer for fitness now is that I have made choices about how I move and what I use to fuel my body, because I love my body and want it to feel strong and energized.
