SeeTV,fcsx8rd,t3_e6tza3,1577927412.0,"That ... was a bad ending. 

There was no need to suddenly make jermamarel a villain just so you could have a cool ending fight to fit with the theme of lights/not seeing, after a season of not actually seeing the character. What a lame and obvious ‚Äútwist‚Äù. Suddenly he literally starts saying obvious evil boss lines without any logical reason. 

If they really wanted to make him a villain, they should have made it more of a long haul with him, and the queen should have been killed off. And then if you want cliffhanger maybe contact is made with someone else who is sighted who isn‚Äôt related to J and then maybe more conflict comes out of that. 

Also kofun acting like a little child the entire time. Haniwa is annoying but at least her character has been consistent like this. 

Boots ... um, wtf didn‚Äôt maghra say to that mom she‚Äôd kill him? More drama there that didn‚Äôt pay off and they could have used it instead of the stupid J twist. 

Hopefully next season is a bit stronger in its plotting and characters, the world building is awesome."
