I think people don’t help because they either can’t fathom a Mom doing something like that to anyone, let alone their own child, or they themselves are damaged or ill-equipped to emotionally handle stepping in and saving someone from their own mother.  

My grandmother on my dad’s side knew of sexual abuse I was suffering from a family member, when I was 3. At 4 I asked for help and she said, (as I sat on her lap in a lazy-boy chair) “It’s not my place.”  She didn’t know it for years to come, but she lost me forever in that moment.

I’m sorry you’re having to go through such pain, but when you relinquish all of it, you will have so much more space for love in your heart!  

My grandmother on my mom side Became ill and I took care of her in home hospice for months. At the same time my father’s Mother, who was abusive to all of my aunts and uncles and father and allowed her abusive alcoholic husband to hurt them. To the point where my own father doesn’t even remember big chunks of his childhood.  The same woman (I don’t like to call her my grandma), neglected to save me from physical abuse and sexual molestation as a child. She told me “it’s not my place,” when I asked her to help me or my cousin. 

She wanted me to write her a letter before she passed away of cancer, and then she would send me a bunch of photos from my childhood. My father was busy taking care of her, but he also knew her narcissistic ways, And that she tried to manipulate the truth to make it out like she was a good mother or grandmother and it drove everyone crazy. 
I refused to stand for that, and I refused to write her The letter she wanted. Of course, I knew I would end up with the photos when she passed anyway. Well, it was A hard conversation to have, but  I love my father so much, because he told me what a strong person I was and that he wished he were that strong. And that he loved me and respected me for my decision. She passed away and I got a very loving letter from him with all of the baby photos from my childhood that she had saved. It did not make me regret my decision to cut her off many years before. 

Stay strong and surrounded by light and love!! You are brave and strong!! So although you don’t know me, but speaking as one strong woman to another— I am very proud of you!!💙"

PublicFreakout,fc5485z,t3_eg1ev1,1577442319.0,"Statistically speaking it is more likely that she is on drugs than mentally ill. 
People that are mentally ill actually become physically violent far less often than people would and do assume.


“ For example, studies have found that the rate of violence (defined as threatening, hitting, fighting or otherwise hurting another person) for people with mental illness is 3 to 5 times the rate of the general public. On its own, this is a worrying figure. But it is similar to how much more violent men are than women.

Recent studies have shown that alcohol and substance abuse far outweigh mental illness in contributing to violence. A 1996 Health Canada review of scientific articles found that the strongest predictor of violence and criminal behaviour is not major mental illness, but past history of violence and criminality.”
