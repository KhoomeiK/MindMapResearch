AskWomen,ffb82z2,t1_ffad4zu,1579754563.0,I‚Äôm sorry your US experience was so cringeworthy.  You have a wonderful writing style by the way‚Äî‚Äòwhere differences are delicious‚Äô is as lovely as it is true.
movies,ffb4ihf,t1_ffaubu2,1579751582.0,"Willem Dafoe is art in motion.  Toni Colette is a genius.  Cate Blanchett captivates me.  Bradley Cooper sells you on every single role he plays, he sucks you right in.  Ron Perlman is iconic.  I‚Äôve wanted to see more of Rooney Mara, she‚Äôs an excellent actress. This is the first movie I‚Äôve been excited about in...a good long while."
DIY,ffb3xo1,t1_ffayhab,1579751157.0,"Subway tile is classic.  Even when it‚Äôs a horrible color you can at least embrace the vintage vibe if it‚Äôs in good condition which, generally speaking, it is.  Love it or not, subway tile is very functional, durable, and offers a clean look.  It‚Äôs up there with  traditional oak floors or a natural stone fireplace‚Äîit has to be really bad to be a detriment in my book.

+1 sliding barn doors are going to be super dated, they‚Äôre already absurdly overused."

Generally speaking those of us who punish ourselves the most really don‚Äôt deserve it.  Try to look at your self talk objectively.  Would you ever say those things to someone else?

news,ff9qyzg,t1_ff8zedo,1579719102.0,100% Yes.  Prison is not a substitute for mental healthcare and the fact that we use it as such is an absolute travesty.  I‚Äôm just so very tired of cops and the wealthy getting a very different justice system than the rest of us.  It‚Äôs bullshit.
relationship_advice,ff96kd3,t1_ff8te8l,1579706035.0,It‚Äôs because everyone is different and what worked for you would absolutely not work for some others.  Having another dog in our home immediately after ours passed would have been an affront to her memory in my mind and I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to stand it.  Three months later we were ready.  Everyone moves at their own pace and grief shouldn‚Äôt be rushed.  Pets aren‚Äôt interchangeable.
relationship_advice,ff9481q,t3_esa3bs,1579704452.0,"r/petloss can be a very helpful place when grieving the loss of our furry family members.  

Help him find out when his therapist is back and make an appointment ASAP. If he‚Äôs on medication make sure he‚Äôs taking it and that they‚Äôre doing their job.  If not, doctor pronto. If he isn‚Äôt taking anything for depression, meds might be something to consider, at least in the short term, depending on how he‚Äôs doing.  

Beyond that...grieve with him.  You both lost a friend and it‚Äôs probably going to be a relief to see that you‚Äôre impacted too.  You will both probably be triggered by unexpected places and things for awhile.  This is a serious loss and it takes time to process it.  

And yes, one day in the future it may be time for another dog.  You‚Äôll know when your ready.  It‚Äôs scary as hell to take that risk again.  You know you‚Äôre going to love them and you know that in all likelihood you‚Äôll have to grieve them one day also.   I will say though, that in spite of the fear, having that doggy energy back in the house is tremendously healing.  There will never be a replacement but there can be new and different loves.

I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. ‚ù§Ô∏è

PS.  Guilt is something to expect also.  Guilt and the ‚Äòwhat if‚Äôs‚Äô.  What if we tried something else or gave him more time or what if what if what if.  You clearly loved your dog and he clearly loved you.  Nothing could keep him young and healthy forever and you made the best choices you could for him.  Trust yourselves in that and try not to torture yourselves."

If they think people calling them out on their egregious racism and that *threats* of violence (still waiting for much evidence of that) is comparable to the *actual* violence and vitriol women and minorities have always and continue to face is equivalent they are sorely mistaken.
