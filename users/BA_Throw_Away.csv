depression,ff5isdh,t1_ff3sdt8,1579594805.0,"Some online stores sell microdose capsules, making it easy for those new to microdosing. Of course, you need to live in a place where they are available (like here in Canada). Once you get a bit more experience you could probably buy the raw mushrooms and make your own capsules."
depression,ff1wqyk,t1_feyyzhc,1579487937.0,Good dreams actually make me more depressed. I wake up and am crushed by my horrible reality.
depression,fdkkr99,t3_elqwy9,1578505619.0,"I have a debilitating medical condition that leaves me mostly bed-bound. It causes severe heat intolerance, so severe that I can barely leave my room without feeling like I'm burning up. I Sweat completely through my clothes within minutes. Summer is hell. I can't leave the house. Winter is almost just as bad since every building has the heat blasting. Even in a cool room I still feel like I need to jump in a pool. I'm in constant physical agony. I probably would have killed myself already if it wasn't for my mom. Killing myself would also mean killing her."
dysautonomia,fdfp7mq,t1_fddq8yw,1578366911.0,"I'm a supporter of medical marijuana, but it has never really helped me sleep. It has almost always kept me up, even indicas. Now, I can't even get high because of how it makes my heart race and become hyper-aware of all of the other symptoms I experience."
SuicideWatch,fcvmssf,t1_fcvhpte,1578005471.0,"Can we ban these stupid bots from this sub? Automated, cold, robotic platitudes don't help. This is not the place for these kinds of bots."
socialanxiety,fciyf0e,t3_eh4z7a,1577672815.0,Booking appointments online or through text is a godsend. If only I didn't have to actually *go* to appointments.
depression,fc0qk5j,t3_efhdh9,1577297238.0,I like your art style. It would make a cool comic series about your feelings or experiences.
SuicideWatch,fba2jro,t1_fb9rec3,1576661139.0,"This is something you should be very careful with. I read stories on here all the time about this happening to them. Most of them involve regretting calling the suicide helpline, telling a friend or family member, and they have a bad experience that can make them feel worse. Resentment for those responsible for the involuntary admission is a common outcome.

With that said, there are definitely positive outcomes and times where this is necessary. We probably don't get to hear those because people don't really come here often to post positive stories. It's impossible to know the outcome of a specific situation, so you have to consider the risk."
