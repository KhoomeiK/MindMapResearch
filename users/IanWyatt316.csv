depression,fci6t77,t3_ehcjso,1577658420.0,Sounds like me lml crazy how relatable this is. But no my friend you're not a loser nor pathetic. You're a person who deserves to find themselves and feel appreciated and cared for.
depression,fcbaosm,t1_fcbai0v,1577584551.0,Thanks don't worry I struggle with bipolar and manic depression so I can relate to self harm. If you ever need someone to talk to I'm here
depression,fcba07w,t3_egzqgq,1577584304.0,I went six months without grinding my knuckles on the pavement and a week ago I lost all self worth and did it again. It's a terrible feeling knowing you have to result to self harm to help yourself feel better but it's true. Anyways I'm sorry you felt the need to harm yourself. You're worth more than that and deserve to feel valued
