unpopularopinion,fewci1n,t3_eqh2c2,1579408368.0,"This will get buried, but here's my sob story and two cents.

I was in therapy (family and individual) from age 4/5 forward. I tried to commit suicide at age 12. I started minimally self-harming at age 12/13 as well. I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and depression and anger issues. At 14 I was in a mental hospital (twice). The mental hospital helped a lot the first time, I hate(d) taking medication and it didn't help a lot. Now, age 19 I am much better and honestly do not think i experience depression anymore. I still have pretty big anxiety and I show minor symptoms of PTSD which I am going to be tested for at my counseling session in two weeks or so. I enjoy life, even though it's still difficult and agitating sometime. My last suicidal thought was about 3-4 years ago, and I haven't self harmed in three. I don't have many big scars, but I have a lot of tiny ones. Depression and anxiety, and all sorts of mental disorders can show up at any age. In the mental hospital I was in the teen section, but there was a section for children ages 3-12. It sucks. 

I was lucky to have an amazing support system of family and friends. But, even if you don't--- I promise, life gets better."

college,fef97z6,t3_eomjwv,1579051167.0,"I’m an education major with an English concentration and many people don’t think we need to study because it’s an “easy” degree. First off, it’s a BS not a BA so they can’t even call me a liberal arts major. Second, imo you should do what you enjoy which should make it easier. Like I do great in math and physics, it’s “easy” but I don’t like it enough to have a career in it. 

Ranting aside, I am in my sophomore year so I’m doing partial Gen Ed’s and partial major related courses. 

For my 3-4 English classes this sem. and last sem. I would do all of my readings in the days before class by splitting them up into chunks. Got to read 50 pages in two days? Do 10 in one sitting, 15 the next, 15 the next day, and then 10 before class. For the tests I would write out ever book, poem, or short story we read and rank them on if I actually read it or skimmed it and if I felt confident or not. Then I review the notes I took in class for them. In foreign language classes do all the homework and then make quizlets. For math classes I mainly just do all the homework and that makes me study. And for history, I haven’t done much too far. For education, I do the assignments and review my notes sometimes using quizlet, but I’ve only take one Educ course thus far so I can’t say much. 

Overall it’s just a fuckton of reading, probably averaging 12-16 books last semester alongside passages or shorter works. You just have to learn to retain the story and be able to provide evidence of any conclusions you make."

I was mortified and immediately told her off, how that wasn't cool, and how I won't be friends with someone I couldn't trust.

He's a total asshole, but Snape is my favorite adult Harry Potter character in the entire books (Remus coming in close second). His behavior to his students is atrocious and only excusable (to me) if you think that he had to act that way to keep up the death eater persona around his ""friends"" kids. 

But, we aren't talking about that in this post. I can only imagine how horrible it would be to teach kids that witnessed or tried to join in on your bullying, much less being physically exposed to them and then trying to gain their respect as a teacher. I'm studying to become a teacher rn and I also volunteer with young-ish kids. Due to my circumstances I may easily end up teaching at my old highschool or in the same district and I may become these kids teacher one day. I have no doubt I would be extremely angry if something happened to me like it did to Snape and then I had to go teach my previous classmates or their little siblings. 

Honestly, if I was in that situation I would never teach in my district. Poor Snape (even though he made many bad decisions) doesn't have a choice. It sucks."

Why the space between the commas and question marks? Why the spacing between parentheses? She only uses one period after et cetera and it weirds me out.
