My drill and impact driver usually come from Lowe's or home Depot when they are on sale for $150 for a pair. These tools are more than adequate for my daily duties as a technician and as long as they aren't abused they last a long time.

MechanicAdvice,feh23n3,t3_ep3iex,1579107541.0,"I would check these things first as they are the most common I have seen. 

1. PGM-FI main fuel relay. Should be under your dash. Youtube will help you find it and reflow the solder joints. Cheap and easy if you have access to a soldering iron. 

2. Coil, igniter, or both. I have seen Civic ignition coils and igniters (aka ignition modules) die both slowly and sometimes without warning. Buy/borrow a spark tester to check that you are getting a good spark from each wire. If the spark isn't there at all or appears to be weak you likely have an issue with one or both of these. If spark is good, you likely have a fuel related issue (main relay). Good luck diagnosing.

EDIT: Sorry, I just saw where you said you tried a new main relay."
MechanicAdvice,feh10rf,t1_fegzen7,1579106889.0,"Since you had the intake manifold off double check all of your vacuum connections. We have had several cases where experienced techs missed the hose connected to the EVAP purge control solenoid. It makes a distinct fluttering noise a few seconds after cranking the engine and it doesn't change tone with engine speed (revving up or down). Good luck.
EDIT: I forgot to mention the hose is located near the throttle body and it connects to a small black plastic box with a couple vacuum fittings on it."
MechanicAdvice,feh08vz,t3_ep3ypr,1579106421.0,Wow. -40 is very cold. An automobile isn't the most well insulated thing in the world and coupled with such low ambient temperatures I would guess that it's hard to keep a high coolant temp. I have seen where diesel trucks will block off part of their radiator to assist in raising the temperatures. This may help you bring yours up to a more comfortable level but I would proceed with caution if your vehicle isn't equipped with a traditional temperature gauge. You could also drive in a lower gear to keep the revs up a little higher than normal to aid in raising the coolant temp. Maybe even look into a block heater. This is all I can think of that would aid in raising the temp. Good luck.

Then if you stay below a certain threshold in health expenses (never get sick enough for a doctor visit) for the year you get a credit on your tax return. Similar to the system we have had in place where you are debited for not having insurance but essentially flipped.
