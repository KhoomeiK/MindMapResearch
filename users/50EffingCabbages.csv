TalesFromTheFrontDesk,ffdyl9a,t1_ffd707l,1579832154.0,"During a ~ year-long transition while a large company near my property was moving headquarters, we had an ever-revolving set of guests from that corporation. And at least twice a week, their corporate travel agent would call to book 2-8 rooms, at auctioneer speeds. She was notoriously impatient, a bit caustic, and needed confirmation numbers NOW NOW NOW. That was my first ever hotel job, and all of my colleagues warned me about Deb.

I figured out pretty quickly that Deb was stretched pretty damned thin. She'd call as late as 10 pm (9 o'clock her time) with 8 more rooms. Or at 7:30 local time. Etc. She just needed efficiency. 

After about my third reservation call from her, I had memorized ""her"" corporate Visa card number/expiration. But instead of keying 24 digits, waiting for new screens in the PMS, I'd make her reservations using a manager guarantee while we were on the phone. One tick box, no new screen. I could spit out a reservation number almost as quickly as Deb could spell the guest name and tell me the date of the upcoming stay. And if the PMS was being a little slow giving me the confirmation? I'd gently joke about how she was working too many hours, and maybe she'd earned a glass of wine.

After she had her verbal confirmation of reservation, I'd go back in the booking, fix the method of payment and corporate address, and fax the confirmations to her. If I'd misspelled a name or effed up dates, she'd just call me with a correction. But she never got mad at me, because I was fast, and I double checked to make sure I was accurate.

I finally got to meet Deb about a month before her company's final HQ transition. She 'erself came to check in. I assigned her the biggest room on the top floor, and put flowers, a bottle of wine, and a basket of chocolates in the room, with a personal note ""You are working too many hours. Have a glass of wine and let me know if you need anything.""

And about a week into her monthlong check-in? A nice middle-aged Grandmother and I got absolutely schnockered on her travel allowance, because I didn't waste her time and recognized how awful her schedule was during that transition. (I think I'm still recovering from the hangover!)

That absolutely doesn't absolve a casual guest from speaking clearly during reservation. Hell, I sometimes have to tell my best friend Ã— 33 years to slow her Yankee mouth down for my southern ears. But sometimes I do understand how fast and businesslike isn't always rude."

Gonna drive suspended? Wear your seatbelt and do the speed limit. Odds are, you'd be fine to run to the grocery store and back, assuming that the car is properly registered, tagged, and insured.

Got a misdemeanor warrant because you forgot to go to court for a speeding ticket? Don't get in a beef with some dude because he looked at you funny. 

Etc.

I realize that too many people are just plain stupid, but seriously, I'm amazed at the number of people who don't understand that, realistically, one crime at the time is all you can get away with!

(True story: around 2004, I was driving suspended, and I absolutely knew it. But I had to buy groceries. Lived in a place that literally didn't even have a taxi company. But first, I had to go to the bank to deposit/cash a check, and then put a little gas in the car, because I was stony broke. I had just left the bank, and was sitting at the stoplight next to the courthouse. I could see the gas station a block away. And my car died. No fuel.

A deputy sheriff pulled up behind me as I put on my emergency flashers. I was fighting tears, because I just knew I was going to get arrested and have to call my aunt to come get the children. Nope. 

Deputy C asked me the problem, I told him I was out of fuel on my way to the station. He saw me all buckled up, with the kids in their safety seats, proper tag and insurance. He and the inmate he was transporting from court back to the jail pushed my giant old car into a parking space. And then the deputy went to the gas station, brought me back a gallon, primed my carburetor, and sent me on my way. Didn't even question me, because I looked like a law-abiding mom.

One law at the time!)"

Granted, I wasn't a skinny kid. My siblings were. But I also didn't have a bunch of childhood illnesses*. They did, and were probably clinically underweight as a result. I graduated high school at 5'9"", 145 pounds. (Just looked it up: that's a perfectly normal BMI of 21.4.

In my twenties, I went through an absolute trough of depression, and lost my appetite for about a year. One day, I was at my mom's, trying on a dress that she'd bought for me for a holiday party. After I disrobed, Ma walked in with the dress. Saw me in my underoos. Hustled me over to the scale. I weighed 96 pounds, and honestly didn't see anything wrong with that**. 

I've overcome anorexia in the years since. (Mild understatement!) But one of the best things I've ever heard: a few months ago, I weighed myself in front of my college aged daughter.

It's very weird, because I certainly don't lead a notably healthy lifestyle. Meanwhile, my brother and sister were at the doctor every few minutes as kids.

**The funniest thing about my mom realizing that I was dangerously thin: she started a community effort to feed me.

Advice,fc9qfuj,t1_fc73taq,1577556642.0,"My baby sister committed suicide a few days short of age 25. I got the notification, and had to tell my mom and brother. I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. I'm so sorry that you were in that type of situation.

And I must have cleaned my house 100 times during the week between my sister's death (overseas) and when we could actually begin to make funeral arrangements. Looking back, I guess it felt like I could control one discrete aspect of my life, and that's what I did. Obsessively.

But my overly practical reaction to a death is based on my father's illness and death. When we kids were pretty young, my father was diagnosed with a pretty rare cancer*, and most of his treatment was in the nearest metro, about 90 miles away. So both of my parents were often away. We kids had a revolving band of caregivers, but some of the daily details fell on us.

The manager at the local grocery store, four blocks from our house, noticed that my brother and I came in kind of regularly and bought real groceries. And he noticed that an 8-year-old and a 9-year-old were carrying big paper bags of milk, bread, whatever, along with our school books, since we shopped on the way home from school. So he told us one afternoon to take one of the carts, just return it the next morning on the way to school. That was an enormous help!

And, in true small town fashion, that manager learned of my father's death a few hours after the fact. As family and friends were descending on us, there was a knock at the front door - obviously a stranger, because everyone used the back door. It was the grocery store manager, with an enormous box: coffee, creamer, sugar, disposable plates and cups and napkins, trash bags, bath tissue, foil, dish soap, etc. Like, everything one might need for suddenly hosting fifty extra people. My mom didn't even know the guy, but his act of kindness has inspired me to decades of imitation. Everyone else can bring a casserole. I'm gonna bring the tissue and paper towels.

Neighbors have decided to have a memorial service next month. I'm going to be next door making coffee and setting up a meal during. (And making sure no one bothers the house.) It's not much, but I know it's an important practicality.

*Happy footnote: my father's cancer was basically just discovered in 1977. It now has a 95% 5-year survival rate. I think that's just amazing!"
