woodworking,ff4lz06,t3_erljxw,1579566830.0,Good job! I just bought some black walnut and I’m excited to make something from it
woodworking,ff1urqf,t1_ff1pah5,1579486644.0,Some felt. It works pretty well
woodworking,fezwcjf,t1_fezkatb,1579462509.0,That’s s good idea! I was thinking a little climbing wall and some boxes to jump over as well.
AskReddit,fevabod,t1_fetzqzg,1579395045.0,Holy shit! I read this and remember that I had one missing wrench in my tool bag so I went and looked. I’m missing a fucking 10mm. My mind is blown!!
todayilearned,fd4ptj7,t1_fd4ng4k,1578169891.0,Oh yeah I’m sure they do. I remember when Obama allowed gays to serve openly in the military. I was in the military  at the time and my grandparents didn’t get why I wasn’t bothered. This was huge for them and I didn’t give a shit. I’m sure me not caring blew their minds.

todayilearned,fd44ls8,t1_fd42rrh,1578164396.0,"This just reminded me of a crazy thing my father in laws wife said. My 3 year old daughter needed a new diaper and said grandpa change my diaper! His wife looked at her and said “no honey, that’s inappropriate”. 
How the fuck is that inappropriate? My wife and I were flabbergasted."
todayilearned,fd3yls6,t1_fd3w91x,1578162793.0,Seriously! I get the same comments. The women on both sides of our family act like I’m some sort of god damn saint. My wife still does 75% of childcare stuff but I change diapers and read to my kids. Holy shit give me a metal!
todayilearned,fd3y108,t1_fd3f860,1578162615.0,What I do in this situation is to go find an empty booth and change the shitty diaper there. I’ve done it several times and nobody hassles me.

todayilearned,fd3vbfr,t1_fd3pboj,1578161945.0,"Yeah each couple has to figure out their own balance. I just don’t want to be unbalanced like my parents were. They both worked full time yet my mom was responsible for all childcare, cleaning and cooking. We rented so there was no maintenance and my dad just sat in his underwear watching tv when he wasn’t working. I don’t get why my mom put up with that bullshit."
todayilearned,fd3thzi,t1_fd3pgsr,1578161499.0,Haha! My father in law tells my wife he needs to give me a break when she takes a weekend without the kids to have fun with her friends. She just smiles and tries not to remind him that I’m gone weekends all the time. Also he’s on his 3rd wife.
todayilearned,fd3sa23,t1_fd3q3ni,1578161253.0,Assuming she gives me my balls back long enough to squeeze them! Am I right comrade?!? /s
todayilearned,fd2x7ya,t1_fd2n71x,1578152552.0,My dad acted like I was emasculating myself when I changed my daughters diaper. I don’t get what the problem is.
okc,fclqrsg,t1_fca8zq5,1577754194.0,My wife got a tattoo from her and it’s one of the most amazing tattoos I’ve ever seen. I would say her prices are too low for her ability.

IdiotsInCars,fbxiwsv,t1_fbx4yfi,1577189710.0,"I was driving through a light next to a pickup and someone behind us honked. I see the guy in the pickup looking around for who did it and then looked at me. When we got to the next light he gets out and comes up to my window and asks what my problem is? I, confused, say I don’t have a problem. He then asks why I honked.  I then had to tell him that it was the car behind him not me. The look on his face was awesome! He went from super angry to shame and confusion. What an asshole."
curlyhair,fbxifvj,t3_eepkrq,1577189067.0,This makes me wish I wasn’t so uptight back before I went bald.
TechNewsToday,fbptckp,t1_fbp98p4,1577024795.0,I can’t tell for sure as the pic is a little blurry when I zoom in but I change my windows 10 color scheme to something close to xp. I don’t know why but I find it friendlier.
