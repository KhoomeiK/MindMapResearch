politics,ff309rf,t3_erbpqb,1579530189.0,Yet the mainstream media never acknowledged him as the true champion for the people. Earlier today NYTimes endorsed Warren and Kolbuchan. The collective delusion is astounding. Times are so bad that people are convinced that the good guy is actually their enemy.  It cannot get any sadder.

bestof,feyayw9,t1_fesrv8t,1579443145.0,I am super pissed that Warren decided to double down and ask Bernie why he called her a liar on stage post the debate. What was he supposed to do? Admit that he said whatever she claimed she did?
politics,fevqerb,t1_fesipwy,1579400250.0,Comments like this are so refreshing.
worldnews,fevq3rp,t1_fenju0f,1579400126.0,They are specifically talking about dominance in the context of dogs. Dog trainers tend to use the dominance theory to intimidate/scare animals into submission. The kind of thing a con man like Cesar millan does. He is not professionally qualified and he's been sued for ruining dogs.

politics,felpixn,t3_epp46h,1579227794.0,I saw this morning that George Conway has taken off again on trump. How can these two stay married and be in the same house?
politics,fek77fs,t1_fek63kv,1579194042.0,But how did you guys end up with such a corrupt senate then? I'm given to understand that the senate will not be conducting a fair trial because it's republican majority. Did the founding fathers not envision a scenario where the house and the senate are divided?
politics,fek5bq6,t1_fek4il6,1579192928.0,"I still don't get why the constitution has such a big hole. If a president is impeached, he should no longer be allowed to serve. Or prohibited from contesting again. It seems like neither is an option. Does this mean the founding fathers were so naive that they thought an impeached president would automatically resign? This is baffling to some of us on the other side of the globe."
