SuicideWatch,fdglzte,t3_el0ny6,1578401813.0,"Maybe the thoughts are there to draw your attention, but the underlying reason can be very different.

Maybe you only want to kill yourself, because you lack self-respect (just an example, I don't know you). If you find out what is missing/wrong, you might find the cause to your self-destructive thoughts. Do you use YouTube as a tool? You can learn a lot about brain-health, spirituality, body-work, taoism... I really wish you the best. Remember you are not your thoughts. You experience them, but you also have awareness, your body, your eye consciousness etc. Whatever is bothering you, I am sure you can find the underlying reason and cure it"

It's alright to act suicidal.

If you need some to challenge your believes or give you guidance to get health brain chemistry, ask me"
SuicideWatch,fdf32hl,t3_el12fq,1578352183.0,"Work, learning, studying is life. The only way to find joy is to learn. Ok√©. If you identify with your thoughts, your life will be unstable. You are not your thoughts. You have biology and awareness. Your brain needs serotonin, so take L-tryptophan or 5-htp supplements. Take vitamine D also. Your psychology doesn't like repression, nor does it like repetitive negative thoughts. Let go of the fight, so you can befriend you own mind. Hey, we are all gay losers if we fail, and we are all apathetic psychopaths if we win. Language can be used as a weapon, don't listen to it too often if it is. I love you, you will love yourself if you see the small things you do for yourself, including bringing excitement in your own life by creating troubles. Do you do sports? Eat veggies! Love work etc."

SuicideWatch,fbzx6tp,t3_efcclf,1577266506.0,"Fuck emotional attachment! 

You are right!

Next step, is lose attachment to your OWN feelings.

You are half way there! First surrender attachment to the world, then to yourself.

Keep at it, you will reach enlightenment"
