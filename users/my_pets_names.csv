ActionFigures,ff82g90,t1_ff6rt47,1579664230.0,"Is selling them for 20 bucks scalping? If you have access to a lot of them, selling them online to people who can’t find them for retail price is actually a good service, IMO."
forhonor,ff818r0,t1_ff7gwax,1579663341.0,I underestimated his power.
ActionFigures,ff79jgz,t1_ff79dkt,1579643897.0,But they would be more joyous if they didn’t have to pay exponentially higher prices.
ActionFigures,ff797nk,t1_ff78e7a,1579643673.0,To the detriment of others.
ActionFigures,ff78azy,t1_ff764hy,1579643093.0,Because you could just leave it for someone who actually wants it so they aren’t stuck paying ridiculous prices or going without what they want.

ActionFigures,ff5vm64,t1_ff5cu8k,1579611774.0,"Yeah, but they’re significantly bigger. The problem with cloth goods is that it doesn’t work at a 6 inch scale."

ActionFigures,ff4o5tf,t1_ff4n0vz,1579568374.0,"What? Why? That’s the best part about hasbro. If you only want iconic characters, just buy iconic characters."
ActionFigures,ff48mb4,t1_ff47rj7,1579557921.0,"I was going to pass because I never liked his OG design, but it’s growing on me and how can one pass up that exploding head?"
ActionFigures,ff48d82,t1_ff46uza,1579557761.0,"I love the feeling of opening a new figure so I don’t mind unboxing videos. 

I totally agree with your point about reviews, though. The point is to help decide if something is worth the purchase or not, and watching someone who knows nothing about it doesn’t help."
ActionFigures,ff47do0,t1_ff471xz,1579557154.0,I can’t argue with that. I can’t wait for raiden.
ActionFigures,ff41sbj,t1_ff3yn73,1579553676.0,"On the topic of awful videos, I hate when people do an unedited unboxing *and* review in the same video because it’s always some jackass struggling to figure out how the accessories work instead of waiting until they understand the figure to post a review."
ActionFigures,ff40vlo,t1_ff3n24w,1579553112.0,"Yeah, I love seeing a big photo of a bunch of wildly different figures posed all together."

ActionFigures,ff40ay3,t1_ff3zsca,1579552751.0,Only one or two body molds do.
ActionFigures,ff3ztc3,t1_ff3y64q,1579552449.0,Or they just don’t like mezco.
ActionFigures,ff3znf1,t1_ff3woe6,1579552348.0,I say who are we to judge?
ActionFigures,ff3zlm6,t1_ff3w4ls,1579552316.0,"I think mezco does a good job for the most part, but I agree for almost everything else. I think cloth capes work, but anything that is supposed to fit the form of a body looks awful. I always feel weird seeing people spend a bunch of money to buy custom Jedi robes and they just look like a kid in his bedsheets. At least they’re happy with them."
ActionFigures,ff3yt52,t1_ff3st4i,1579551820.0,I think the difference is that there is much more variety in quality of articulation than sculpt/paint.
ActionFigures,ff3nztb,t1_ff3n1pe,1579545135.0,"I told myself I would try to upvote truly unpopular opinions, but I have to make an exception because I can’t get behind this."
ActionFigures,ff3m790,t1_ff3lzkk,1579544027.0,Now *that’s* a hot take!
ActionFigures,ff3lj6f,t1_ff3lct5,1579543612.0,"Don’t get me wrong, I find it annoying, I just can’t help but give props to them for that genius idea."
ActionFigures,ff3l68f,t1_ff3kyao,1579543390.0,"Double joints, I guess. I know figuarts have had some good range with single joints, but if it can’t breach 90°, it’s going in the garbage."
FallenOrder,ff3km55,t3_er743k,1579543050.0,Why would anyone here try to change your mind?
ActionFigures,ff3kf9f,t1_ff3jdcg,1579542935.0,"As a marketing gimmick, I love it."
ActionFigures,ff3k43x,t3_ergkkk,1579542747.0,"I don’t like 90% of cloth goods on figures I see. The only good ones are on mezco and I laugh every time I see customizers make cloth robes, which always seem to look comically oversized, and get tons of praise."
lego,ff3ifx5,t1_ff354c7,1579541723.0,Then ask why and try to get some criticism.
lego,ff32aqn,t1_ff31crb,1579531813.0,They only said this to one they actually liked. There was nothing rude about what was said. I think the greater injustice is to tell people to keep their mouth shut when they disagree. The best discussions come from disagreements.
FallenOrder,ff2x6pa,t1_ff2ce9n,1579527457.0,Both of those were after the ninth sister fight.
ActionFigures,ff25iyj,t1_ff227r9,1579494391.0,I think you can just say it without linking a subreddit.
FallenOrder,fey8k33,t3_eqrb5s,1579442116.0,"Her fight was the most satisfying to me because, now I love cal and all, but the man can’t beat anyone by himself that isn’t an animal (and the bat thing killed itself). He always gets help from someone, so seeing him defeat her with his own skill was great."
FallenOrder,fetyp4p,t1_fetw6dv,1579381387.0,I like it a lot.
FallenOrder,fepa6e7,t1_feozqy0,1579315595.0,"Yeah, I won’t say it isn’t there, (the rancor immediately comes to mind). I just think there’s a disproportionately high amount of animals in this game."
FallenOrder,feozk6i,t1_feonzjd,1579308812.0,"I’m sure there are many other ways of getting out of dathomir. Hell, they could have just had a cutscene of him walking back to the ship and no one would question it. I didn’t mean out of place in the style of play; it’s just another pattern recognition fest again for the most part. I meant that it came out of nowhere and was never mentioned again, as well as how it just doesn’t fit well in my image of Star Wars. 

When I think of Star Wars, I don’t think of giant bats, I think of the empire, or the lived-in, futuristic but still gritty atmosphere of Tatooine. There are plenty of more “Star Wars” ways of adding variety to combat, like any of the absurd number of vehicles in the universe.

I just think I find myself much more satisfying defeating someone like the ninth sister, someone who wants to kill you out of hatred and villainy, rather than a simple minded animal that sees food. I just found myself sad after the bat fight."
FallenOrder,feobaba,t1_fen6tfy,1579297697.0,"Honestly, the bat was my least favorite part. It was completely unnecessary to the story, it felt way too long, and I prefer fighting other people to animals, especially ones that are just bigger versions of real things."
ActionFigures,feo9v64,t3_eq4b2t,1579297148.0,"So it went from Instagram, was screenshotted and posted to reddit, then saved only to be posted onto a different subreddit?"

Awwducational,fdzvanz,t1_fdzrf9x,1578796639.0,I think I've always gotten a bit of mockery for this stance. I refuse to kill them and people act like I spend my free time in bee hives worshipping their queen.
Awwducational,fdzv1of,t1_fdztjsr,1578796467.0,"Same. I did a paper on the importance of arthropods in high school and I knew it was a tough sell when I was presenting it. I hope I changed some hearts, though. People always defend their hatred of insects by the fact that many can be very harmful, like mosquitos and their diseases, yet crane flies always have it the worst despite being incapable of harming people."

TheMandalorianTV,fdm3lle,t1_fdlulzq,1578538991.0,Shit. I missed and hit myself in the throat and now I can only talk in an intense whisper like Herzog.
