DatingHell,ffaa614,t1_ff6wf5c,1579730888.0,"I get what you mean but look at the context. I basically budgeted for us to have 5 shots apiece. If you’ve ever been on a date with someone you met online, it could potentially last a few moments or several hours. The idea wasn’t to chug 5 shots in an hour. But with good conversation and if we liked each other, 3 hours could easily go by and there goes 5 shots apiece."
DatingHell,ff6fr3z,t1_ff6en5g,1579626228.0,"Completely agree. Girls don’t want to be used for sex, and guys don’t want to be treated as an ATM.  When either party becomes too one sided, it entirely becomes transactional and the other party feels ‘owed’. This kind of stuff is why some compare dating to prostitution."
TalesFromYourServer,ff6co2r,t1_ff6cgpl,1579624305.0,Never said I wanted them. Just that it’s amazing how some people think if they can save a few dollars they have no problem getting someone fired that may actually be good at their job and mess up their reputation.
TalesFromYourServer,ff6b1lp,t1_ff5r1pe,1579623269.0,Been in this situation. More often than not the owner/manager would go chew out a confused server wondering what the hell they did wrong. Some people would prefer to destroy a good workers reputation if it saved them a small amount of money. It’s sad.
DatingHell,ff5u9xd,t1_ff5toeb,1579610468.0,"Technically if happy hour is $3 shots, that equals 10 shots for $30 not including tip.  That translates to 5 shots apiece...which should suffice since we both had to drive our own cars back home. Now if she goes ahead and orders 5 drinks at $12, suddenly I’m looking at a $60 tab for just her alone. That isn’t ‘going to happy hour’ which implies cheap drinks. She could’ve always offered to pay for her own drinks, but clearly that wasn’t her intent. 

I had more than $30 on me, but it’s the principle of knowing had I been the ‘nice guy’ and ponied up (like I have in the past), then I likely wouldn’t have seen her again anyway. Considering what happened, it showed me her true colors almost immediately. Would rather save that money and spend it on someone more likely to stick around, which sure enough happened just 2 months later."

Tried to make the first date easy for her. By the end of the night I had a similar situation as you with a dozen missed calls and texts becoming increasing more accusing.

offmychest,ff5cm1c,t3_erhisj,1579587370.0,"I guess it depends on the people you know, but both my wife and I know what it’s like to be cheated on and it’s the cowards way out. In the past, I had a 4 year relationship and I had the balls to tell her to her face that it was over. Some people try to avoid the discomfort of breaking up, want to cheat and keep their partner, or just view their partner like some random user name online which is incredibly sociopathic behavior.

The only time I knew a guy was being cheated on and did nothing to help him, was because in the past I rescued him from passing out in his car in public when he took too many Xanax. When he came to the next day, he was somehow pissed at me for taking him to his girlfriends house to sober up before the cops found him like that. Called me a pedophile which was slander and almost made me never want to help anyone again. So when this asshole left town and his girl cheated on him twice...I just didn’t care to tell him. Fuck him."

CODZombies,fda3kux,t3_eke1g3,1578241266.0,"I love a challenge, but needing a guide book to play a game is bullshit. No random casual could ever figure this shit out unless they troll reddit or YouTube. Origins was the beginning of the end for zombies in that only hardcore players would actually go online and figure out every convoluted step. This is the single map that forever split the fan base between casual and hardcore. People here praise Blundell like he’s the savior, but his style alienated casuals, turned zombies into ‘zombies and monsters’, and took the survival fun aspect away. Even though I’m buying an Xbox 2 on day one, they can keep BO5. BO4 was a huge slap in the face to anyone that ever supported them.

EDIT: I read all the comments. Some of you agree, yet others disagree while simultaneously proving my point. A casual is someone that rarely (if ever) plays zombies at all. An example of this is playing with your wife/girlfriend. Do you introduce her with a more casual map...or do you introduce her to zombies by dropping her in the middle of Origins without any hint of what to do? My non zombies friends refer to it as an ‘All Day Map’. Origins is as far from casual as it gets no matter how much you may love that map."

And when that guy proved he just wanted a quick fuck and not a relationship, she came back to me and that’s when I discovered it all. Ended up losing my apartment, one of my dogs, and had to move home with my parents. All the while she was telling me what a loser I was and it destroyed me mentally.

In the 9 years since then, she has two kids with two dads and is now single.

In my experience throughout my 20s and early 30s before I finally got out of serving, was the older generation had the mindset of “why don’t you get a better job?” They seemed to think anyone that waits on them actually wants to be there and enjoys being underpaid.

When I graduated I did so with honors and won an award...I was advised in the beginning I was ‘above’ franchises and should go check out this family owned spa instead. It sounded great and made sense on paper, but I found ‘family owned’ doesn’t necessarily mean it’s worth working for.

Many will tell you to start finding your own clients from Day One. I personally find that advice to be bad. Despite my own accolades when I graduated, I was still pretty lost my first year as I was still discovering what ‘my style and niche’ were. I’d suggest waiting until you’ve been licensed a year and then when you’re ready you’ll be a more polished therapist. Because you will see things you never saw before once in the field.

Like you, my intent was to do this full time. When these great opportunities on paper (family owned spa, chiropractor) didn’t work out, I found the most consistently for a full time job with massage is with a busy franchise. The problem is,  I can go on forever about how horribly most are run. For me personally I burnt out and about to change careers after 5 years. I still want to massage but never for a franchise again.

It’s not like people that go to these places aren’t immune to having pain related issues!

But after dealing with enough interviewer ignorance from people that never worked a single day as a massage therapist, I found its best to also convince them that while pain relief is my specialty that I can also provide a great relaxation massage.

When it comes to client satisfaction, nearly every place I worked at gets stingy with telling me ‘hey great job!’...so there are other ways to figure out if clients like you. You can ask for client feedback reports, or ask the front desk if they hear any client complaints. Rebooking alone isn’t a true indicator of client satisfaction. The client could be from out of town, can’t afford regular massage, etc. All that matters to me is did they enjoy the experience and did I hear anything about it later."

CODZombies,fc90480,t1_fc90204,1577544882.0,Ah ok. Thanks for letting me know
CODZombies,fc8zuqt,t1_fc8z8ms,1577544763.0,"Sorry, not familiar. Are you talking about consoles, phone app, or PC?"
CODZombies,fc8z41x,t1_fc8jvon,1577544420.0,Where can you play it on VR?
CODZombies,fc8rz7z,t1_fc8nzn8,1577540921.0,Clearly we are. What I was meaning to say was I wish we could get brand new maps like these.
CODZombies,fc8ndf4,t3_egohm3,1577538453.0,"I miss the basic maps like these. We don’t need a bunch of ridiculous creatures for a challenge, this map proves that only having zombies can be plenty of fun."

raisedbynarcissists,fc5b4rb,t3_efx24s,1577451796.0,"Parents forced us to leave the doors open so we could hear the scream at each other all hours of the day and night. If we shut it there was hell to pay.

Grew up thinking this was normal so I started to open up their door and walk in. Walked in on my mom changing and got called a pervert a bunch of times. So my strategy from then on was to close my door, lay in my room naked, and if they barged in tell them I’m naked and underage. That got them to leave my door alone."
TalesFromYourServer,fc47v4c,t1_fc2pqnt,1577408987.0,"I’ve been working over 20 years at this point for a variety of owners. Even at the best of my job situations where I put in the time, what happened to you is still an amazing thing. There was always at least 1 or 2 bad ones among us...and in the bad jobs they seemed to be everywhere."
TalesFromYourServer,fc47a5j,t1_fc2t9sw,1577408532.0,"Like I said in my original reply, not every situation is a ‘fuck this I quit’ because it isn’t practical. Like you, I once worked at a horrible restaurant for quite awhile because of my girlfriend/living situation/in bicycle distance because I couldn’t afford to repair my car. So trust me I get it.

But that doesn’t mean you can’t build for a better long term while working for these shitheads, and it can be done rather quickly. For example, check out careers in Information Technology and Massage. I didn’t know about those when I was stuck in my waiting tables nightmare, and both can be accomplished within a 6 month window AND make you more money. I know this because that’s how I escaped."
TalesFromYourServer,fc2ns3i,t3_efv91m,1577368454.0,"Oddly enough the food industry never seems to have a real issue with forcing sick people to work. Your manager is an asshole considering you stayed later than scheduled and still acted that way. I think you have learned his true character. With that said, not everyone can say ‘fuck this job I quit’, but you should definitely be looking at an exit strategy/timeframe to get out of there and work for someone that appreciates you. Sorry all that happened. Sometimes, it takes something very shitty to happen to motivate you to see clearly and do something better."
TalesFromYourServer,fc2nart,t3_efusqr,1577367959.0,You have a really nice staff and are a good person...just about everyone I ever worked with would’ve pocketed the money and bragged to everyone including the poor guy that made only $27 how well they did.
TalesFromYourServer,fbycbnm,t1_fbwqhu2,1577213338.0,I’d be happy to tell you...check back here within a day or so and I’ll update this text. It’s a lot to type.
