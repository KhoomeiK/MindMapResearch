I love dogs so so much, but have never had one :( I've been asking my mom ever since I could think (seriously!) and she keeps saying no\* :( To be honest though, right now, we don't have enough space at home, and I personally don't have enough time or money to be able to give a dog a good life at this point in my life.

But I will DEFINITELY (definitely definitely definitely definitely!!!) get a dog when I move out, have a stable income and enough time. I have decided that I will adopt my first dog from a shelter, and it will be an adult dog, because those doggos deserve love too! And then, once I've gotten used to being a dog mama, I will get him/her a friend :)

If I were to get a set of your sunglass-doggos, I'll keep them and look at them. And once I finally (!) get myself a dog, I'll take a picture and send it to you as a card, in that envelope!

Oh also, my favourite breed used to be golden Labrador, because [the toilet paper we used at home](https://www.coopathome.ch/img/produkte/880_880/RGB/4403154_001.jpg) was a brand whose ""logo"" was a golden Labrador puppy :D But now my favourite breed is any kind of Pitbull.
