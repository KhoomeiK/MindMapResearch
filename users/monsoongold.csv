fitbit,ffaxuvi,t3_eqwm59,1579747011.0,"[RANT] Anyone else starting challenges and adventure races a bit bothered when others invite people to the ones you created without asking? I try and make one adventure race challenge every week for people within a 2k step average of each other so that it‚Äôs more of an ‚Äúanyone has the chance to place in first‚Äù and I figure most people have busy enough lives that it‚Äôs realistic to put in an extra 1-2k a day to try and leap frog a couple people, rather than 5k extra a day. As a general rule, I think if you want to invite people to challenges and adventures you don‚Äôt set up, you should ask first, most of the time if asked it‚Äôs a non-issue. It‚Äôs becoming a habit now and even more are doing it, 3 different people did it on a pogo o trail adventure in the last 12 hours, 1 of which I originally invited. Should I say something? Am I being petty?"

loseit,fez04to,t3_eqy8w0,1579452622.0,"Fitbit and other fitness trackers are notorious for not being accurate, do not rely on the amount of calories it says you are burning, it uses a formula and doesn‚Äôt take into account other factors. Binging is NOT a healthy way of eating and making it a habit has the potential to lead toward disordered eating. If the way you‚Äôre eating now isn‚Äôt **sustainable**, do something different. I personally looked at the tdee of my goal weight and that‚Äôs what I eat at, because if I can do that to get there, I can do that to stay there. If it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôd be willing to do for the rest of my life, I don‚Äôt do it."

loseweight,femygdd,t1_femqz0x,1579272834.0,"I would also try and make an effort to help your mom in the kitchen everyday so that you know exactly what she is putting into your foods. It will allow you some bonding time, as well as show that you‚Äôre interested in what you‚Äôre putting into your body. Hopefully then you can also try and make some suggestions, such as... ‚Äúmom I would really like to try out this dish, can we please try it and make it together?‚Äù Try something like a black bean soup with some rice on the side. I eat this all the time and it‚Äôs delicious! The black bean soup will have a good amount of protein in it, it won‚Äôt have meat in it and will have rice as a side dish so hopefully it will pacify your moms requirements. Unfortunately it will be her say as to what is made in the house so your best bet to getting what you want is to slowly make suggestions and consistently showing effort to help her out in the kitchen."
loseweight,femwl9t,t1_femqz0x,1579271504.0,"I‚Äôm sure that must be really frustrating for you. I would download myfitnesspal and track everything you eat in a day for at least a week so you know what your macros are with the current foods you eat. I would also search for as many credible sources as you can to back up your need for such levels of protein. For fat loss, a daily macro for protein isn‚Äôt necessary, calories in vs calories out gets the job done just fine. I would maybe start with fat loss and show consistency with it before trying to make your case for muscle gains. I would also advise going to your schools physical education teacher and ask them for advice given your situation, they can probably guide you better than anyone on the internet as far as what your needs would be."
WholeFoodsPlantBased,felpj5v,t3_eps2r4,1579227799.0,"[Here ](https://www.delishknowledge.com/plant-based-umami/) is a good article about understanding how to get that umami flavor while eating plant based! 

Ask your family members for ingredients to marinades and sauces they use of the meats you love and just look up substitutions online for any ingredients that aren‚Äôt vegan. For instance lard can usually be substituted with olive oil and then just add some of those umami ingredients mentioned in the article! As far as a meat substitute goes I recommend extra firm tofu which will soak up all the flavors of the marinades, or even cauliflower is a wonderful alternative! 

A lot of meat, unless it‚Äôs raised on an open farm and of higher quality doesn‚Äôt really have *TONS* of flavor, a lot of it is coming from the marinades, sauces, smoke, or crust developed while cooking, all of which can also be imparted onto plant based alternatives like tofu and cauliflower.

Edit: [another article ](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-food/how-to-add-umami-flavor-to-vegan-dishes/)

Looks like you can also buy umami powder (expensive though) which seems like just a spice blend of dried ingredients mentioned in some of the articles which you could probably make on your own. A custom umami seasoning made by you for you so it ends up being exactly what you like!"
WholeFoodsPlantBased,felmoj6,t3_eps5cr,1579225843.0,"I personally really like tofu, but it has to be extra firm if I am eating it to substitute a meat product and it has to be well flavored. I usually toss it in a marinade before I go to bed, flip the block when I wake up so the other side gets good and submerged, and then it‚Äôs ready to be cut and cooked when I get home. You can do quick marinades but I like it to soak all through the block and not just the edges. 

If you have a dish that calls for tofu and you don‚Äôt want to use it, you could try substituting it with cauliflower which has a lot of the same properties when cooking. I used to looooove orange chicken, now I make my own healthier version with either tofu or cauliflower pieces, they both work great! I‚Äôve also used both for bbq,  lettuce wraps, and heck, basically any Asian dish you can sub the meat or tofu for cauliflower. So far I can‚Äôt think of one way you can cook tofu that you can‚Äôt also cook cauliflower for. So if you‚Äôre really put off by tofu, don‚Äôt use it but I would try it at home a few more times, it took me a number of tries to get it right before it came out well enough to eat, let alone, GOOD."
ArtistLounge,felic40,t1_fekzlx7,1579222864.0,"As a follow up to the hashtags, learn to use the *right* hashtags, if you‚Äôre using #art #drawing #painting #photography or any other generic hashtag you are getting lost in the tens of thousands of other posts for that day that used it too and you‚Äôll likely not be found by anyone that way. If millions of people have already used it, no one is going to be finding you. Use niche specific hashtags or at least make the general ones more specific such as #yourcityArtist and so on. And don‚Äôt use a fuck ton of hashtags, keep it somewhat limited. I recommend the goal digger podcast by Jenna Kutcher for a more in-depth explanation on instagram and hashtags that is super easy to understand. She did a whole podcast about it within the last 2-3 months. I recommend her, beyond just that one episode, she is a wedding photographer turned business empire and she shares a lot of what she knows for free! Yeah she does have some paid courses but she gives away a plethora of information for nothing as well that I‚Äôve found really helpful."

loseweight,fejx348,t1_fejq7mm,1579187835.0,"Meat and supplements aren‚Äôt the only source of protein, a lot of vegetables, cheeses, and legumes are packed with protein as well as other important nutrients. If you‚Äôre not in total control of your diet and tracking everything though, it is harder but not impossible to get adequate protein, and protein supplements do come in handy because they are easy.

**physical heath**          
          
‚Ä¢Lose 25lbs       
3lbs lost so far but I think I set my goal just a little too high. I‚Äôm going to adjust it to 20lbs which will be 1.5 lbs a week instead of 2lbs.      
          
‚Ä¢10k steps a day/average      
10k steps 8/9 days and made up my steps from the day I didn‚Äôt hit it 
13,566 steps yesterday       
10,304 average for the year so far       
        
‚Ä¢Exercise 4 days a week for at least 20 mins     
I‚Äôve worked out 2/9 days so far. 4/9 if I include specifically going for a walk. At first I wasn‚Äôt going to count walks because I wanted to hit 10k in addition to another form of exercise but I recently started walking in my neighborhood with lots of hills and my calves were on fire afterwards and my heart rate got up quite a bit so I will count those walks towards my exercise goal.        
        
‚Ä¢do yoga 2 times a week for at least 20 minutes- 0/9                 
I‚Äôm struggling with this one. I even got a yoga trapeze for Christmas that is taking up a quarter of my living room with the stand. It mocks me everyday, multiple times a day as it looms large lol. It‚Äôs awesome (the whole 30ish minutes off and on I‚Äôve used it) I need to stop being intimidated by it, get over myself, and just put my big girl panties on and do it.          
          
‚Ä¢track all of my calories- 1500 calorie goal   
Tracked but I overate on my 1500 calorie goal. I still lost weight which I‚Äôm pleased with. I was supposed to wait until next week to make bread since I made room for it in my calorie allotment and I didn‚Äôt for this week. I couldn‚Äôt contain my excitement to make it though and then proceeded to eat 1/3 of it the day I made it. No regrets.            
              
‚Ä¢make as much food from scratch as possible 
This week I made bread, refried beans, and black bean soup. I hope to add flour tortillas and a stir fry sauce to the list over the weekend.            
            
**mental heath**       
          
‚Ä¢do something artistic at least 2 times a week- 3/9        I did some watercolor and drawings                     
            
‚Ä¢read 1 book per week           
Started book 2 yesterday- The Power of Habit, hopefully it will help me to learn how to better implement some of these new habits that I want.         
             
‚Ä¢write my morning pages- 2/9          
After yoga this one is the next one I struggle with. If I don‚Äôt start them within 15 minutes of waking up, I don‚Äôt do them.

‚Ä¢ get house ready to move in 2 months      
I cleaned and detailed the whole kitchen and one of two dining tables. Today I hope to clean out my bathroom and start working on the spare room.

I tried and failed many times last year to get it together but I always floundered at some point along the way and abandoned my goals for weeks or months on end. I‚Äôm 30 now and I really want to make the next decade of my life healthy and happy since I totally didn‚Äôt always do that in my 20s.
