happy,ff9ebz6,t1_ff33klm,1579711171.0,"One time I thought my tooth wasn't quite loose enough to be pulled (one of my back teeth). Was on the playground at lunch, and I stuffed an entire fruit-by-the-foot in my mouth and started chewing. Didn't realize that it had suctioned out my tooth until I bit down...hard...on my tooth.   


Never again. \*shudders"

CPTSD,ff9de6k,t1_ff90002,1579710552.0,"Finding peace and purpose is never just one thing, as we all know. But to tag along on this tread, can I suggest walking? Like, REALLY walking. I'm a Canadian with C-PTSD and a few years ago had just had enough and moved to Malta in the Mediterranean for 3 months. And seriously, I just downloaded some podcasts and walked. Usually for 1 - 4 hours a day. Sometimes both morning and night. And I came back to Canada a different person. No it didn't solve everything. But my brain actually felt like it was working for the first time and I ended up writing about 60 pages of journal/5-year-plan. I'm not saying this is where walking will lead YOU specifically, but either way, I found it very meditative and uplifting.  


If you do take it up, I hope you don't mind if I spam you with a few links. Here's a video called:  [The Ideal Body: Use Your Body to Shape a Great Character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv2oqcCK_Kc). One Nietzsche quote from it, ""Sit as little as possible; *do not believe any idea that was not born in the open air and of free movement* \- in which the muscles do not also revel... sitting still (I said it once already) - is the real sin against the Holy Ghost."" (Ecce Homo, italics mine)  


And if you do go for a walk and like podcasts, one real eye opening episode is from  Krista Tippett's award winning podcast On Being: [Bessel Van der Kolk - How Trauma Lodges in the Body.](https://onbeing.org/programs/bessel-van-der-kolk-how-trauma-lodges-in-the-body/) I'm relatively new to this sub, so I hope this already hasn't been shared a million times.   


Anyway, hope that helps. ""Keep your stick on the ice. We're all in this together."" -Red Green"
happy,ff2labh,t1_ff2d48u,1579511463.0,"Lool, that's great. I had a friend that tried that and it worked too. My brother did the whole bow and arrow and string deal with ease. Turns out most of these weird strategies...worked most of the time??

I wasn't a fan of all the quickly moving parts though. I always opted to just close my eyes, grab the tooth and give it a yank. Think it was right around that time that I grew my first chest hair."
submechanophobia,ff2l6k7,t1_ff20uuq,1579511310.0,"I totally hear you, and that sounds really cool. I haven't dove on any Pacific Islands yet (except the GBR), but that clear blue water looks amazing. I was lucky enough last year to be able to dive on the Zenobia just off the coast of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean. My deepest dive yet! About 40m (or 130 ft). 

Anyway, hope you get to go down again sometime soon. Cheers guy"

AskReddit,fds5eap,t1_fdrobfm,1578694740.0,"Not to mention a lot of these fire probably started without any human involvement. In 2017 there were a bunch of fires in Alberta/Saskatchewan (where I'm from in Canada). It was 35 degrees Celsius for a week, and then one day the wind picked up and an old powerline pole broke. Sparks, wind, and the rest is history. So that does happen too.  


Although even then, I saw multiple people who had thrown cigarette butts out their car window (and the patches of burned grass to show for it). Fucking morons.   


LPT: If it's been hot as the Sahara for a week and the wind is howling, don't throw your god damn lit cigarette into the ditch."
