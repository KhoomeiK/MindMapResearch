When I was getting my bachelor's, I helped pay for my tuition by working on the reference floor of the main library; basically, students were paired up with staff librarians to help out with databases and putting books away. I befriended one of the librarians, we'll call her Mrs. G, who was an adorable and cooky, yet totally badass, older woman. Let's say that (and I feel really gross typing this) your friends would ""approve"" of her demeanor in the workplace. She was the wife of one of my favorite architecture professors, so she gave me a lot of advice about the profession, and about the work force in general.

One day, she left mid-shift for a staff meeting, and came back *livid*. She immediately started venting to me about her co-worker Laura: a very smart, competent, and conservatively-dressed co-worker who was cursed with extremely good looks. During this meeting, she said, Laura had all sorts of good ideas which no one took seriously until Mrs. G repeated them verbatim. Mrs. G knew they would listen to her because she ""looked the part,"" which was just insulting for everyone involved: even in a liberal, diverse and young environment, a woman couldn't be both intelligent and attractive.

At the time, little optimistic me thought that this was a one-off. But when I entered the work force, I became the Laura. I worked for a startup where everyone was young, and I was talked over so many times that I actually had to make pacts with a couple of co-workers to get my ideas out there. One was a man (so obviously he had no trouble), and another a woman which the men in the team did not find attractive, and therefore found respectable. The whole thing made me so angry--for myself and for her.

We often talk about management or clients turning to the man in the room, but in instances where the whole team is women, I've often seen them turning to what they perceive is the less attractive woman--even if she's not the one talking or in charge. We also often talk about this issue with older, more conservative men, but I've worked in NYC for six years in mostly young firms, where I see these things happen.

I realize I've now typed a longer story than OP, I guess I also needed to vent. It's not an easy or comfortable thing to bring up, but we *need* to because this does not end with college, nor with the generation before us. Women in the workplace are not one-dimensional movie stereotypes, we are driven people with ideas who are just trying to collaborate, and whose looks are *fucking irrelevant*!"
TrollXChromosomes,fe8n8cn,t1_fe6rfto,1578928199.0,"In the US, this will never happen.

Past figures, including Nixon, thought that the advancement of technology would make workers more efficient, and that therefore a four-day week would end up yielding the same output. And while this is true (as an architect, there's no way I would be able to do as much as I do now without computers), companies just understand this not as ""getting the same product in less time,"" but rather ""getting more product in the same span of time."" And the US does not have solid enough labor laws to help out with this."

You could draw the different bushes with the different fruits, describing each one as your little mushroom tries to figure it out.

So this might seem like a silly piece of advice, but double-check where your student loan payments are going. I ran into your same situation, and it was because the company (Great Lakes) *refused* to let me pay the capital and insisted I pay ONLY interest despite my continuously asking otherwise/fighting on the phone/filling out many forms. It wasn't until I restructured/switched companies that I started seeing numbers going down. Total fucking scammers."
