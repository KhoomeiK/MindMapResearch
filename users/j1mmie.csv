I saw P&T do a similar trick in Vegas once, and it did NOT rely on misdirection. It was fucking awe-inpsiring. I""ll try to summarize the trick they pulled:  
 
Basically, the video shown on the ""iphone"" (which was a camcorder when I saw it) was not actually live - it was pre-recorded! P&T had simply choreographed EVERY movement they did, every word of dialog, every microgesture, so well, that you couldn't tell the video was pre-recorded. It looked like it was live. And the trick went on for something like 8 minutes. At some point they even bounce a ball off stage, and in the video it bounces at the same speed and and cadence as on stage.  
 
At the end, Teller somehow slipped into the audience (probably as early as 2 minutes into the trick) and revealed himself at the end.  
 
It blew my mind when I realized the trick. The only way I caught it was because Penn lifted his arm and I noticed it was at a right angle on stage, but more of a 45 degree angle on the video.
