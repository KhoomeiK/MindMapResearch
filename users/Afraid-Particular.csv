SuicideWatch,fcp1sl6,t1_fcp1n1e,1577847849.0,"I know I can, but I don't want to push this on others. Two my sister's nearly died from suicide and I don't want to push this on them. One of my sister's live in DC, three live with me, my two sisters that don't live with me have a lot to deal with."
SuicideWatch,fcp1n0p,t1_fcp1k8a,1577847715.0,Thank you
SuicideWatch,fcp1ejx,t1_fcp1cq8,1577847508.0,Whatdo  you mean
SuicideWatch,fcp1dap,t1_fcp16ip,1577847477.0,It's everything. I've always had this weight of sadness on me ever since my uncle was murdered. But I've been able to bury it but over time it's becoming stronger and stronger. I'm trying to live for the friends I have and the family that loves me it's just hard. Thanks for being a kind stranger.
SuicideWatch,fcp03ad,t1_fcozoyr,1577846396.0,Im trying to distance my self from anything that can cut me. I can't go anywhere cause I'm not taken seriously also I hate talking to people but if you want to listen I'm down to talk.
SuicideWatch,fcozcak,t1_fcoz2br,1577845789.0,Pretty fucking terrible. When ever I try to talk to my narcissistic mother she says 'stop joking' and everyone says 'stop being sad. Just be happy it's not hard. ' I honestly want to fucking die. I came out as bisexual and I lost 98% of my friends and I was made fun of. When I left my school I lost my boyfriend and 50% of my friends ( I lost 99% of all of my friends ). Sorry for ranting I just can't talk to anyone.
SuicideWatch,fcoyet7,t1_fcoxx8k,1577845032.0,What do you mean
SuicideWatch,fcoxtlj,t1_fcnt0ex,1577844554.0,But what about people who do need help but gets neglected or when they say 'youre too young to have drepression'
SuicideWatch,fcoxnna,t3_ei3ysm,1577844417.0,"I tried and I'm 13, they said I was too young to 'have drepession' and that idk what it is. I tried calling again a few weeks later and they put me on hold for hours."
raisedbynarcissists,fcbk24h,t1_fcbjsmh,1577587779.0,"Honestly I thought all parents were like that... Self absorbed shallow, fake and attention seekers well I think they are. Thanks for this."

raisedbynarcissists,fcactu3,t3_egv1zg,1577566942.0,I feel like I can't talk to other people so I always talk to the air too.
