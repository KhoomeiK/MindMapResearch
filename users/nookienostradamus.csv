movies,ffdp74d,t1_ffc119j,1579825683.0,"Fair enough. I mean, everyone takes away something different from a media experience. I always get downvoted by the “BR 1982 is boring and incomprehensible” crowd on this sub with my ferocious assertion that ‘2049’ is boring and incomprehensible. Oh well! Opinions, right?"
movies,ffdonja,t1_ffbyz79,1579825343.0,"Oh, lemme see. One of the most effective points of the first film is that everything is ephemeral. “It’s too bad she won’t live...but then again, who does?” In the philosophical structure of the film, everything is doomed: humans, replicants, even the planet. All in a state of decay. More poignantly, replicants have to live in a compressed timeline. They’re a reflection of a specific human fear: not just of death but of dying unfulfilled. The very clear implication at the end of the 1982 movie is that Deckard is a replicant (regardless of what Harrison Ford thinks). His time with Rachael is limited just like Roy’s time with Pris. So giving Rachael this weird ability to have a baby makes the “lesson” from the first movie meaningless. Even more so when Jared Leto’s cartoony, mustache-twirling villain “brings her back.” So completely stupid. 

Secondly, in the 1982 movie, the replicants were essentially “children.” They were impulsive, arbitrary, cruel, capricious - because they were emotionally immature. Who wouldn’t be if they only got to live 4 years? There’s no substitute for experience. The only one of the Nexus-6 models that not only lived long enough but experienced enough to to make it to self-actualization was Roy - though Pris came close (“Then we’re stupid and we’ll die...”). He figured out how to live outside his own wants, outside his head. In ‘2049,’ Deckard is old af and he *still* hasn’t gotten there. And, on top of that, K starts out being prevented from working toward meaning or growth by this corporation. Okay, interesting enough inversion so far. But then he’s sent on this arbitrary”hero’s quest,” at the end of which (surprise!) the meaning is that you don’t get meaning; it was someone else’s all along! K got to die without getting a real character arc, just the same nebulous, static suffering that Deckard was doing. 

‘2049’ was so high on its aesthetic and its convoluted plot that it completely forgot character development. The only character I remotely cared about was Joi, and she was quite literally insubstantial. By the end, I was like, ‘oh, thank fuck he dies so this movie can end.’ The take-away of the first movie was that you have to grasp at whatever meaning and happiness you can, because you never know when it’s going to end. The second movie very unevenly resurrected or clumsily continued a lot of stuff from the first, slapping on an extra layer of angst that didn’t serve any discernible purpose. A very pretty but ultimately pointless snooze-fest."

AskReddit,ff6zbvy,t1_ff664xo,1579637986.0,"Agreed. I find a lot of ""slippery slope"" arguments disingenuous, but this one is not. I'm coming at this from the perspective of a person in media fandom. Some in fan communities (many of them women or assigned female at birth) use ""CP"" or ""pedophilia"" to harass artistic creators (artists/writers) for sexual depictions of fictional characters. More often than not, the characters are not underage or depicted as such...but age, consent, intent, etc. literally don't matter when there are no real people involved.

Nonetheless, these ""antis,"" usually hiding behind anonymous personas on social media, will send hate that can included urging creators to suicide or even death threats for material they perceive as ""immoral."" These can include depictions of non-consensual or BDSM sex between fictional characters, or even sex between characters who, while they are depicted as above legal age, have a significant age gap. I've seen a relationship between a 20-year-old and a 40-year-old described unironically as ""pedophilia."" They don't seem to grasp that depiction does not necessarily equal endorsement, and might be cathartic for the creator while not harming anyone real. Worse, a lot of these people tend to be young, teens and 20-somethings. Worst of all, they often harass creators of media (movie directors, actors, authors) about the same things. It's the illogical end that the slippery slope has been pushed to, and it's appalling. All for the sake of disproven talking points: namely that media consumers don't have the agency or discretion to tell fiction from reality or the moral code preventing them from re-enacting fictional violence.

I would only try to explain that other groups that have advocated loudly and demonstrated for recognition and civil rights have suffered the same casual, unconsidered condemnation. Gay people expressing their need to be seen and acknowledged by society as fully participating, fully deserving, and fully human are told that we are “too loud/too flamboyant.” The same was said about black Americans fighting for equality. When James Brown declared: “Say it loud - I’m black and I’m proud,” white America responded that he didn’t have to be so *loud* about it. Any form of advocacy for equal treatment by a marginalized group is seen at first by the majority as a demand for special treatment, for more rights than everyone else. Pride events, which if you go to a few, you’ll see are much, much more than oiled-up dudes in leather pants, are important to us for many reasons. One of those is that they create visibility - not just for queer people but for the institutions and groups that support us. But media only covers the drag queens and leather bears, not the regular people in their t-shirts and jeans marching with their companies, churches, families. Another reason is that queer subcultures have played a big role in advocating for recognition in the community, and we want to honor their history. I ask you why a Pride parade is different from Carnaval in Brazil or the many Mardi Gras parades in the US that feature women in little or no clothing and often encourage spectators to take off clothes. I’ve never been to a Pride parade where anyone demanded that I show my tits. Why is it okay for a radio station to host wet t-shirt contests, lube wrestling, thong contests, hairy chest contests, etc. at outdoor festivals where there are children and families, but not okay for a man to wear sequined shorts in the back of a truck? Because all those first events are aimed at straight people. They are no less sexual than a drag queen in a sparkle bodysuit, but somehow it’s more offensive if it’s queer. People love RuPaul’s Drag Race and Queer Eye, but as soon as those things come off the safety of the far-away TV screen, they’re suddenly “bad for the children.” Women who wanted the vote in the 19th century were called shrews, whores, and accused of destroying the family structure and society itself. So, no, I do not at all agree that being openly queer and openly proud is doing our cause a disservice when no one but the most prudish religious person bats an eye at Comic-Con “booth babes” or summer festival bikini contests or slutty Super Bowl halftime shows or kissing booths for straight people. People *only* think it’s “more dirty” because it’s gay, not because it’s actually any more shocking. And that is the point of my original post. I know that all straight people don’t participate in radio station twerking contests all day or talk about their pony fetish on A&E shows. They buy groceries and watch movies and renovate their houses and call their mothers...just like queer people do."

I was disgusted. Bye, bitch."

SelfAwarewolves,fco361x,t1_fcm0t7z,1577823197.0,"No shit, dude. The guy had a history of domestic violence. The argument is not that violent people won't be violent if not for guns. The argument is that by implementing smart laws that make it so people with a history of interpersonal violence can't legally get guns, we drastically lower the chances that they escalate from, say, hitting their spouse to shooting up a church. ""But he could use a hammer!"" Yeah, and do less damage with a hammer. Second Amendment nuts don't even give a shit about *mitigating* harm. They are happy to accept around 15,195 murders and 24,090 suicides by firearm - including 613 murder-suicides and 417 mass shootings - every single year just so anybody with a pulse can have a gun for any reason. These people are so fucking stupid they should be declared brain dead."

""The Executioner's Song"" - Norman Mailer (the story of a man executed for murder in Utah in 1977; it made waves because he demanded the death penalty)

""Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City"" - Matthew Desmond (about housing insecurity and the often crooked landlords who extort people)

""White Rage"" - Carol Anderson (traces the history of how people of African descent were kept down even after becoming supposedly ""equal"" following the Civil War)

""Just Mercy"" - Bryan Stevenson (now a movie with the amazing Michael B. Jordan! About a criminal defense lawyer who represents death row prisoners appealing conviction)

""Nickel and Dimed"" - Barbara Ehrenreich (looks at how most Americans are only scraping by financially)

""Men We Reaped"" - Jesmyn Ward (the author talks about losing five men she knew to violence - she's also an incredible fiction author)

""Educated"" - Tara Westover (it's a memoir, but an incredible story about the author's escape from a doomsday-believing family, includes lots to think about in terms of religion, family, and mental illness)

""Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End"" - Atul Gawande (a doctor's look at what makes a good life, and a 'good death.' I actually have met Dr. Gawande and he's a really awesome person!)

""The Swerve: How the World Became Modern"" - Stephen Greenblatt (a really neat look at how science, industry, and technology grew out of the ancient world)"
loseit,fckol6y,t1_fckoazo,1577729827.0,"Well, it sounds like you've got the right ideas and a great plan for moving forward. I'm so glad to hear it! Ugh yes trauma sucks indeed. In the wake of a big change, like moving, you can definitely start to feel isolated again. Best wishes on the path toward always better!"
loseit,fcknycy,t3_ehp0y1,1577729437.0,"Hey, hon. First of all, I'm so sorry that happened to you. You did not deserve it; no one does. About two years ago now, I realized that it takes not just weeks or months, but YEARS of intense work on oneself to recover from trauma. My very first suggestion would be to get back into therapy as soon as possible, with the focus now on radical self-acceptance (accepting yourself as you are now, but also focusing on your future goals) and finding coping mechanisms other than food. Instead of thinking I could ""take a new pill"" or ""do a stint in the hospital"" and come out okay for the remainder of my life, I've finally realized I was - and always will be - a work in progress, constantly doing the labor of recovery from trauma. It \*does\* get easier with time, but for a while, it's hard and it's shitty and it sucks. A lot of things you want to forget will come to the surface again. But once you cast that critical eye on those things, they have less power over you. I wish you so much luck and strength!"
AskReddit,fc3vmi6,t1_fc26089,1577399778.0,"It’s absolutely defensive; good way to put it. Shame isn’t in most cases a good motivator - not with weight or sociopolitical beliefs or addiction, etc. I think you’re right, most people who are obese know it puts them at higher risk for health problems. Same with people who smoke. Hell, I used to ignore my mental health until I spiraled down and got locked up in the psych ward, over and over. I was defensive, proud, and kinda delusional tbh. Actually developing healthy ways to cope now; better late than never. While I have my own opinions about health, I’m consistently appalled in threads like this by some people’s lack of compassion. Every human being no matter their weight deserves health education and health care. And I also know many people (including myself) who have shed weight and kept it off by making changes to their lifestyle and attitude. (And you’re right: 85%+ of weight loss is diet, not physical activity.) Learning to manage obesity means acquiring a skill set, just like I’ve had to with my mental health. Human beings don’t really care for hard work, and we’re really good at self-delusion. Anyone who wants to get into a recommended weight range can do so, but it comes down to an age-old problem with the human condition: change is hard. Thank you for your no-nonsense optimism."

AskReddit,fc3ttwc,t1_fc24qui,1577398467.0,"Scientists don’t actually know if e-cigarettes are an effective tool for cessation. Because the types of devices and the pods, as well as nicotine levels in each, vary so widely (and because devices are essentially unregulated as of now) it’s close to impossible to create a control group by which you can measure whether and if e-cigs help people quit. Could they? Yeah, possibly. Even the CDC concedes that they might, given adequate information. But studies based on self-reported behavior are much less reliable. It’s not possible to ask a group of people who vape to vape the same product in the same amount for the same period of time to see if it helps them cut down, because it’s wildly unethical (e-cigs are considered tobacco products, not approved cessation-focused nicotine delivery devices like the patch). I’m no fan of vaping, but adults can do whatever they want. I do think it’s important to restrict access to e-cigs for young people. Up until about age 25, the brain is still developing and cementing neural pathways, and nicotine disrupts this process, which can lead to problems with memory, retention, cognition, learning, and impulse control. A bit like what exposure to lead does to developing brains. Considering that some Juul pods can have as much nicotine as an entire pack of cigarettes, that’s not a small consideration. Numerous studies also show that kids and teens who vape also use another combustible tobacco product (like cigarettes) along with vaping at vastly higher rates than dual use of other conventional tobacco products. 
tl;dr - vaping might help adults quit smoking but we don’t really know; vaping fucks kids’ brains up long-term."
AskReddit,fc3sh7d,t1_fc2sp7m,1577397484.0,"Thank you for this! “Conquering” really only applies to people with situational depression. I do not at all mean to minimize their struggles—depression is terrible no matter what. Those without chronic/relapsing mental health disorders can absolutely experience depression, use interventions like medication and therapy for a period of time, then discontinue one or both and possibly never have another depressive episode. A depressive episode, of course, is different from both sadness and grief, though these can set off a depressive episode in anyone. But as you say, chronic depression is managed, not conquered. It should be treated like MS, rheumatoid arthritis, substance abuse disorders, obesity (all of these are classified as chronic, relapsing disorders, btw): managed in coordination with a health care team and using strategies like counseling, group support, and even tools like apps. As with any relapsing condition, there will be good times and bad times. But the therapy/counseling gives those with such a disease new habits, physical and emotional tools, and coping strategies that can lower the risk of relapse and help make the declines less precipitous than they would be without help. It is an evolving, lifelong process of learning and adaptation."
movies,falh0w6,t3_e9mi5e,1576184224.0,"Honest question, for those of you who liked 'The Lighthouse,' why? I admit the acting was great, but to me the film was a too-long jumble of fake-deep, hamfisted metaphors. I'm no action-blockbuster devotee--I love Tarkovsky and Kiarostami and Fassbinder--but I found this one unbearably dull and absurd. I was able to stay with it for a bit, but the 'cyclops tableau' scene just made me laugh out loud and after that the movie had completely lost me."
