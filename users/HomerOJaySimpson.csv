What you said:

- The money will absolutely come from taxes. I agree. Taxes on the super wealthy - which is currently a broken and abused system that reduces the effectiveness of the “trickle down method”. Aside from that source, ending our U.S. tendency to start never-ending wars over fossil fuel would be a great way to redirect funds.

Money will come from taxes...taxes on super wealthy. That’s what you said. The second part was not on raising money but saving elsewhere by stoping never ending wars. **how much do you think you can save from never ending wars? Because we aren’t in any wars right now.**

> Taxing the super wealthy, ending foreign oil wars, and restructuring healthcare will result in massive income for our country. Look it up.


That doesn’t help pay for the UBI. Maybe you save $100 to $200 billion from a reduced military but the UBI would costs some $3.5 trillion. Then m4a would costs another $3 trillion per year. Current US spending is around $4T so add UBI and m4a and you nearly triple spending 

Then add in the $1.6T of student debt Bernie wants to wipe away plus $100b a year for free college tuition. Plus hundreds of billions for social security increases."

And? We are talking about universities as a whole. We are comparing the quaintly of universities. NOBODY argued every university in the US is great. That’s ludicrous to create such a strawman. The argument is simply about the quality of universities as a whole. 


You keep suggesting that while US dominates at the top, somewhere US universities are average compared to other countries. How do you get to this assumptions? You haven’t provided any sources and thus given how much the US dominates the top 1000, you would have to believe that after that, the universities in the US mysteriously amd drastically drop in quality. I’m trying to understand how you go to that point?


Also, those top 250 in the US that are top 1000 in the world probably average at least 20,000 students per school. That would be 5 million students. There are 14 million students in 4yr universities"
NoStupidQuestions,fewndrr,t1_fewms68,1579415653.0,"> Did you skim over when I said the numbers are skewed?

Oh, and somehow they aren’t in other countries? And though you don’t have any data, you will just suggest they are so heavily skewed that somehow the majority of American teachers are making significantly less than the say the top 10 countries with highest salary teachers?

I’m not arguing that there are no teachers being underpaid but we have data that shows the numbers collectively and the US teachers among highest paid in by world AND the US spends more than any other country but one on students. 

> And also the part where I said a lot of the education system needs to be reformed? 

Maybe, just maybe, you’re on to something. Seems like we aren’t underpaying teachers but we need reforming the education system.


https://www.insider.com/how-much-countries-around-the-world-spend-on-education-2019-8


- In 2017, the US spent $12,800 per student on public education, which is the second-highest amount spent per student of any country in the world

So how can you argue the US isn’t spending enough on teachers or on students given the US spends among the most on both? Seems like money isn’t the issue but rather reform on how we run things is needed"
NoStupidQuestions,fewmt5n,t1_fewl7fw,1579415026.0,"> I’m saying the majority of universities in the US aren’t “above average” or “below average” they’re average

How do you reach that conclusion? What we know is that US schools are dominating the top...even including the top 1000. The top 250 US universities in the top 1000 in the world are a very big share of all students in the US. That’s millions of students in the those top schools 

What makes you think that outside of the top 1000, the US just mysteriously drops off and very few until you get to the bottom?

I’m trying to understand how you guys reach your conclusions because no way are you guys being dishonest as hell, right?

> The majority of the US won’t go to an above average school. Hell the majority of the US won’t even go to college. So I’m still not sure why you quoted that and called it horse shit. 

You’re totally not being dishonest here, right? Who cares that what you said applies to every country but two. Who cares that the US has among the highest number to attend higher education?

Majority of teachers underpaid? Then how do just about every other country get better education for less?

I said ""Teachers in the US are among top 5 most paid in the world."".  He doubted it and asked a source. What does my source demonstrate? That teachers are top 5 (or 6 depending on the measure) in the world. 

So you admit I am right? 


Then I said ""Other countries seem to get better teachers for less"". So the numbers support what I said, right? You guys complained that education is lacking in the US (you guys argue it's because pay is too small) and since US is towards the top, it seems that other countries have better performing schools with lower paid teachers.


So i'll break this down:

1. Are teachers approximately top 5 most paid in the world?
2. Are US K-12 schools below the top (i.e. they are not near the top)? 
3. Are other countries having better schools with lower paid teachers?
