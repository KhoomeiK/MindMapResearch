trashy,ffdke6n,t1_ffcnw0w,1579822739.0,"When I studied in university I met this girl in a bar. We got it on, and started seeing each other regularly, then we started dating and then for about 6 months we were legit like a couple. Even met each others parents and shit. Then one night when we were having sex her phone rings and she panics and answers. Guess what? It's her BF since 5 years back in her hometown that she hadn't told anyone about. Yeah... That felt bad."

skyrimmods,ffcrfs5,t1_ffce0ue,1579805721.0,"Even if she cares, she is stern and harsh. It's not a cuddly, motherly or soft kind of love she has to mortals. It's more akin to a duchess who wants servants, and therefor won't kill everyone beneath her. We're ""subjects"" in her eyes."
skyrimmods,ffc8gu7,t1_ffbxft7,1579793939.0,But she should. Her voice would be much more fitting for Mara or Dibella.

It's not only for heterosexual men as some try to paint us up to be, even though I suspect a few often discussed issues such as child custody in court is disproportionately a heterosexual issue, for obvious reasons."
skyrimmods,femn72i,t3_epiqkz,1579263396.0,"Very good point. I often try to make a point out of giving credit where credit is due, but sometimes I simply don't have time or is too tired to write something. And I know what I do is *not* representative of everyone who likes their work. Hell, most don't even press the equivalent of a ""like"" button on the nexus.
