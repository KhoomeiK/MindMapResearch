woodworking,ff25e8u,t3_er4ple,1579494285.0,I assume you chose not to finish it in something or stain it.

GetMotivated,fcsjff5,t1_fcsifun,1577917768.0,"As long as you make it I would love that. My description of the post was in context with respect to it being clear but admitted that things can be interpreted in many ways. Unless you are going to police the entire internet for things like this please just stop. There are many things you could spend your time fighting. Things that are clearly malicious, which this is not. And at least I don't need insults to get my point across. Have a nice day."
GetMotivated,fcsh0y5,t1_fcsgl5h,1577916415.0,Interpretation police over here. I never said you were wrong I just offered the other side of it. Clearly you think I am completely in the wrong. You just didn't need to write a thesis about it.
GetMotivated,fcsebt8,t1_fcr2t38,1577915329.0,I would say it's pretty clear considering the subreddit it's been posted to. These kind of posters can be interpreted many different ways to many different people. Can you imagine all the others things that are so much worse those people also see everyday? I can see if the font was different and the colors were different as well as just design overall where this could have been horrible but it's clearly and explicitly been designed as a motivating message.
GetMotivated,fcqwiro,t1_fcqcnpy,1577893286.0,Then that's the wrong interpretation of this. One can take many things the wrong way
Astroneer,fbv0q7u,t1_fbut9bi,1577123488.0,"Hmmmm. Whelp, I guess we can just hope the next patch which is supposed to have a lot of bugs fixes gets a lot of those."
Astroneer,fbusjyi,t1_fbuq0aa,1577119679.0,I'm beginning to think it might be like Factorio where the larger the save the worse the performance. I have a lot of stuff that's been mines and bunches of material pieces just sitting on the ground everywhere.
Astroneer,fbkjblc,t1_fbkimsq,1576951265.0,Not like I have a choice just wanted to see if any of these things were wide spread.
