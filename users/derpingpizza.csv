sports,fcugonn,t1_fcufilz,1577980525.0,"So, a ""no hitter"" is when the pitcher doesn't not allow a single batter a hit throughout nine innings. If a batter is walked it can still be a no hitter. 

A perfect game is when the pitcher doesn't allow any hits OR walks. It's much harder to achieve and doing it in a world series is insane."
