IAmA,fewjjj5,t1_feudjtw,1579411910.0,"Yeah I got snubbed at my local mercedes I was going to buy  SL550. I had CASH. I was wearing a hoodie and ripped up jeans (normal in my industry and appropriate). The guy simply said ""we don't have those around here"" and walked away. Went to the dealer ship 50 miles away. I actually made the deal over the phone told them to have the paper work ready. Got cashiers check on the way. In and in about 10 minutes. They gave me all sorts of free crap and invite me to events and call me just to see if I need anything. 

Guy didn't realize that the ones in suits are the employees not the bosses."
science,fev6o11,t1_fetrptg,1579393727.0,unfortunately its broken. If you have an ok job you have to pay. if you have 10 kids and don't work its free.
dating,femuria,t3_epz9bt,1579270148.0,"I actually stopped using social media for a similar reason. I work with A LOT of different people and people add my personal instagram / facebook all the time. I stopped using insta all together and set my facebook to private and rarely post on it anymore unless its like family. I started to feel more and more violated. People would actually message me on there and I never knew them. Now I just ignore social media all together. Very unconfterble on social media. I'm afraid to post anything. Never know who is lurking, creeping."
stopdrinking,fej0jnn,t3_ep71sh,1579152602.0,"Don't go on instagram. Never had the desire. I don't go on social media at all. I text everyone directly like a weirdo. lol. I also don't answer the phone when people call me. 

People must think im weird."
personalfinance,fei2gl4,t3_ep6pyk,1579128820.0,"If you are poor everything is free. Several people in my family get free everything. Free food, free clothes, free housing.

I'm stuck here working 12-14 hours a day and can't afford basic health care. Interesting how it works."
zoloft,fdolqar,t1_fdof1uh,1578607702.0,Of course its different for everyone. It can to a point. They can still happen though. I wouldn't blame this entirely on zoloft though.
zoloft,fdnjmr1,t3_em6uxk,1578587189.0,Zoloft is not such a huge issue. She would more than likely feel like this zoloft or not.

zoloft,fdcg578,t3_ekhdvj,1578274072.0,"Yes, I get these. I mix the the two as well. I once woke up mid punch and it resulted in a swing, punching my dog. I wake up mid yell and it makes me finish the yell as I wake up. Its been going on a while and ive yet to find a solution. Was never like that before zoloft / melatonin mix. Kind of just accepted it, can't sleep without it."
unpopularopinion,fcz8b6i,t3_ejg52h,1578095698.0,"I have gay friends and don't give a sh\*t and possibly gay brother, lol. I call them gay. They don't get offended, they know its not a reference to actual sexuality. More about being a wuss. Ya'll gay. <3"

EOOD,fcz6f9i,t3_eex0m8,1578094614.0,"You know what helps me, be there. So many people leave me if I talk about depression, they are almost instantly out. So then I don't talk about it, then it kills me and I get more depressed. Maybe just ask if they'll talk? Say you are there. Try to understand. Depression is lonely."
EOOD,fcz5hay,t3_ejldrc,1578094066.0,So awesome man. Keep it up.
zoloft,fcymr6o,t3_ejci38,1578082921.0,"Yes, alchohol affects it like crazy. I used to not get hang overs. Now I get like a 4-5 day anxiety attack where I lay in bed. I'll also randomly puke which is super weird. It makes driving or going places nearly impossible. Als my tolerence went way down."

There are taller guys though, I am kind of short and have no issues. I do prefer shorter girls that I meet with in the south though."
stopdrinking,fcorx31,t3_eia8ac,1577839910.0,"Fomo sucks it's gotten me for years. I quit on and off. I don't really go on social media and its still killing me, I am either going to pop in a movie or go for a long drive. Maybe drive by the strip that has all bars just to know that isn't me that's going to be hung over. Hang in there! Try to stay busy, internet friend."
depression,fcogn1i,t1_fcofhbk,1577831761.0,It's most likely fake. People post so much fake stuff on social to make them look better. Try not even looking at it or switch it up and post your own had a great year post.
zoloft,fcn9pm9,t1_fcn975i,1577806850.0,The hangxiety is real on Zoloft. Used to get up and feel fine. Now i'll have bad anxiety for a week or two as well.

depression,fcm4zca,t3_ehuxug,1577764378.0,"Hey, I feel the same. My dog pretty much keeps me alive. I work in marketing too. I hate the people I work with right now but I love the work. Working with narcisist sales people that completely make my life hell. IE: calling me at 3am to ask questions and thinking its funny because they I have sleep issues and then getting me to work a 24-48 hour shift. I've actually become extremely anti social because of this to the point I just leave my phone off for up to a week. Anyways, I used to have a pack of 3 dogs that were my life, I am on my last dog who is also around 12, he's my best friend. Try and hang in there. You can get through it."
ForeverAlone,fcm204b,t3_ehs4h0,1577762153.0,"Friends of friends of friends. I used to be able to fill a house with 200 people in an hour in my 20's. I would just start dialing numbers (this was before everyone text). I would start with girls as I am a guy, then move to guys. Litterally house packed. Now I am in my 30's and forever alone. Most of those people are married with kids or moved or I simply don't talk to them because I choose not to."
stopdrinking,fcm1rql,t1_fcliswy,1577761981.0,"Yep, I rotate. Also if I go in the morning I am say i'm headed out fishing. Also hide the cans in trash can. I am again on day 3. One of my parents can see my personal account so I rotate cc's and no longder use my debit card.

dating_advice,fcjkgfn,t3_ehgfxc,1577691226.0,"X man whore here. I am in my 30's now but in my 20's I got a laid a lot. I would  simply ask them back to make place, or ask them to come in if gettin a ride(this was before uber). Generally towards the end of the night if at a bar and we hit it off. I don't do this anymore as I feel like things have changed, I would have actually know them."

I had a seizure already today, people have taken me to the emergency room because of them, they are 100% booze related, scares me. I do drink during work (i'm the boss, sorta). I think everyone knows and just doesn't say anything. I started completely blowing off family events, I don't answer my phone. I'm not sure what is wrong with me. Some people who know started getting mad at me, I deleted them out of my phone. My phone won't ring unless I have someone saved. I'm a train wreck."
