vegan,fdn3mgv,t1_fdn2hon,1578576308.0,Honestly Iâ€™m just hella sad that from milk to soy to almond Im still bloated. I guess Iâ€™m scared of not having options. So I was wondering if this happens
vegan,fdn2dvb,t1_fdn132q,1578575224.0,Thank you!! Iâ€™ll definitely try oat. Iâ€™m just sad bc regular milk doesnâ€™t work for me. Soy doesnâ€™t. Almond not sure anymore :( Iâ€™m just worried I wonâ€™t have options so thank you for the recommendations and how it worked for you.
vegan,fdmtjvq,t1_fdko63k,1578565096.0,Ok Iâ€™ll try oat. Have you tried rice milk??
vegan,fdmtip5,t1_fdklyl3,1578565053.0,Iâ€™m here to ask for alternatives? Obviously thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here asking for advice. I hope when you ask for advice someone doesnâ€™t state the obvious just the way you did when youâ€™re frustrated for your health.
vegan,fdklgze,t1_fdkgutv,1578506006.0,"When I first started drinking coffee with soy milk, the bloating wasnâ€™t bad. Barely noticed it. But now thereâ€™s actual pain. Like itâ€™s close to being considered pain. Never had this reaction to tofu or tempeh. This only happens when I eat a truckload of cheese tbh."
vegan,fdkl90y,t1_fdkc03r,1578505872.0,I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll count stating the obvious as advice
vegan,fdkkyr3,t1_fdkdlcw,1578505722.0,"If regular oatmeal kinda bloats me, will oat milk bloat me too??"
AskReddit,fdjvhuv,t3_ell2h8,1578488861.0,"I had to move to a different city for work and my mom kept annoying me about my everyday schedule and etc. 

At first I was replying to them but sometimes theyâ€™d get sarcastic along with their helicopter moments that I stopped replying. 

I only replied if it was a life or death situation or had something to do with family. But if itâ€™s concerned with my schedule, I stopped replying. 

She kept insisting it was safety and what not. 

But I inform my bro or friends where I am and tbh thatâ€™s enough for me. At least they donâ€™t pester me much."
bulletjournal,fdja745,t1_fdiro98,1578462996.0,"Basically I get 4 payouts from my job. Besides my hourly wage, I have a basic rate + transpo fees. Whatâ€™s fixed is my basic and transpo but my hourly wage varies monthly! So I decided to track it ðŸ’œ"
ADHD,fdguq7l,t1_fd3vpqc,1578408806.0,Im happy your son was diagnosed early. Being diagnosed late and having to go through these life moments can make you feel awful. Having the support he has (you) at a young age will be great for him in the future

AppleWatch,fc77do9,t1_fc6zifw,1577499505.0,I wasnâ€™t playing the music from my watch. It was being controlled by the watch. Turned off the auto launch and it was still severely draining the battery. No need to be rude you know :/ if you read the auto launch you could read between the lines and realized that it was being played somewhere else.
AppleWatch,fc779cv,t1_fc6felg,1577499417.0,I was using my iPhone. Thatâ€™s what I meant. But it was draining my watch. Bc it was being controlled by the watch. Turned off auto launch it was still draining
AppleWatch,fc773wn,t1_fc5uqps,1577499305.0,I was using it to control the phone. And I didnâ€™t want that so I turned off the auto launch it was still draining. Does it make sense?
AppleWatch,fc772cp,t1_fc54ztx,1577499273.0,I just checked it out. It was the Spotify app. The music app the one on the Apple Watch itself didnâ€™t drain it as much as it did. So I uninstalled the Spotify App :)
