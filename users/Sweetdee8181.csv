todayilearned,ff3uyz0,t3_erem32,1579549423.0,Reminds me of being a kid. I had a foot race with an older male cousin and he gave me a 30 sec headstart. I won and he said it didn't count because I had the headstart that he insisted I take in the first place. I asked if he would have proclaimed himself a winner if he had won and he said yes. So I would have lost no matter what the results because of the headstart and he refused to race me unless I took the headstart. Fragile male logic 🤦‍♀️

Working in veterinary care was a lot like working in the food industry, sometimes it sucks knowing what's going on in the kitchen and makes it harder to enjoy the meal.

relationships,fepmg3l,t3_eqbij6,1579324388.0,"Everyone will say just talk to him and don't snoop. I'll take the downvotes to be straight with you.... he's probably cheating. My husband did this EXACT thing about 5 years ago. He went from completely carefree with his phone (hand it to me to hold unlocked while he drove or let me use it to google something for example) to completely freaking out if I accidentally touched it. I tried talking to him and he doubled down and made me feel like an insecure asshole. Against everyone's advice on here and my family's advice, I snuck his phone from under his pillow (yes he had started hiding it under his pillow) and used his finger to unlock it. At first I thought everything looked on the up and up and I was embarrassed I had doubted him and then I did a random word search on his phone for the words kiss, sex, and a couple other words. And there it was, hidden under a contact name like so-and-so dentistry (a text thread I hadn't bothered checking when I looked through the texts because it looked like just appointment reminders) 100s of messages between him and another man, including photos of them on dates, dick pics, everything. Then I went through his email with the knowledge that he'd probably be more secretive than I thought and I'd have to be thorough, and pages and pages down I found an email from where he'd set up a new email address I'd never seen. That email contained proof he was on grindr and had emailed other men before starting a relationship with the man he was texting. He wasn't even at home less while cheating so I had no reason to believe he was cheating other than the weirdness with his phone. At the time he had gone back to school and he had basically thrown his education away (skipping more classes than he attended) to see this man. 

Well, long story even longer, fuck Reddit and trust your gut. Do what you gotta do."

When I was a kid my mom would not let me and my sister go into our rooms and close our doors or hang out in our rooms at all. She wanted us to spend time with her in the living room 24 hours a day unless we were sleeping. Your future mother-in-law sounds very high maintenance and needy. On a positive note, you won't be living with her forever so it might be good to just grit and bear it until you move out. This is actually really good for you because now you know what it would be like if she moved in with you when she gets older and it might be something you want to avoid.

Counseling would be better. If he could work through the sexual issues that would fix your issues without bringing more people into a complicated situation. 
This sounds awful and I'll take the downvotes (I've never done this myself) but I think cheating and getting your needs met and not telling them or just breaking up would be better than adding more complications to your relationship."
