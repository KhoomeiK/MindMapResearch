With the buzz surrounding the selecting of the next actor to play the Doctor it is known who it's going to be for some time before the current one leaves.  Having the next Doctor show up in an episode could be the 'announcement' of who the next one is.  Taking it further you could have it be an extended storyline with Jodie showing up to finish it two or three episodes into the next Doctor's first series.  Sounds like something Steven Moffatt would try to pull off. :)

Most urban environments are not harmed by having cats roam and I suspect in most rural environments that have had farm cats for centuries, the cats are already a part of the ecosystem.  Yes, be responsible and have your cats spayed or neutered so they don't overpopulate.  And yes, if you are in an area where the environment might be harmed by the introduction of a cat, do your research and use your best judgement.

All of this is academic to me, anyway.  I haven't been able to have a cat since I was young.  Allergies."

doctorwho,fehbbuj,t1_feh6010,1579113038.0,"On reflection I've thought of a possible in-story explanation.  The last words of the 12th Doctor was ""Doctor, I let you go."" and the 13th Doctor seems to have regained her child-like exuberance and enthusiasm.  Possibly part of what was 'let go' was the emotional pain and burden of guilt and self-condemnation.  The Doctor managed to forgive himself.  But guilt and pain can make you empathetic and compassionate towards others.  Perhaps in letting go of that pain she also lost some of the deeper empathy while increasing surface niceness.

Just a thought. :)"
doctorwho,feh6010,t3_eozmmk,1579109861.0,"The writing does seem to be more thoughtless than in previous seasons. The plots try to take the moral high ground but kind of fall down logically.  In the arachnid story trying to say guns are bad there's no apparent thought given to which is better - quickly putting a dying, dangerous creature out of its misery or locking a bunch of them up together to slowly suffocate to death or cannibalize each other. In Orphan 55 it was so busy trying to make the ecological catastrophe point there was no space given for the Doctor to try to communicate with the natives and find out why they're trying to kill everybody.  Not that the communication has to succeed but the Doctor generally at least tries.  Don't get me wrong, there's stuff I enjoyed in season 11 and the second half of Spyfall was great (IMO), but the general trend of Doctor Who now seems less about where the character of the Doctor is going and instead begs the question ""Where's the writing gone?"""

How much people are influenced by violence in video games is a very old and ongoing debate.  I think VR takes that up a notch.  I personally have found I don't like shooting people in VR.

There are also games you can play while sitting up in bed. I've done VR Fishing, Wander, and the Pinball games though for the pinball games I sit up tall-ish and adjust the position with the oculus button before sitting back so I can play from a more comfortable postion.
