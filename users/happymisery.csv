worldnews,ffd6z11,t1_ffd64dk,1579814634.0,"I got full pay and most companies offer different ranges depending on the relative. Grandparents and parents are 3 days, a spouse or child is usually a week or two weeks. This is the baseline and most companies I've worked for are more generous. Sickpay is paid but it's statutory, it's called SSP, at I think Â£66 per week for up to six months, but you only quality after 5 days and need to provide either a letter or certificate from a GP. Many companies offer up to six months with the first 3 months at full pay which then drops to half pay for the last 3 months. If you're still off sick after six months, you'd then apply for SSP . My company has paid people fully when they've had ongoing illness such as cancer treatment. There is usually a qualifying period for employees, so you must have worked there for at least six months to get the full sickness benefit or your claim SSP."

In issue 121, he also says ""A dead body wouldn't become a walker until its body temperature had lowered enough that another walker wouldn't be tempted to bite it. It reaches a very dead corpse state before reanimation occurs.""

There is no difference, according to Kirkman, in how the zombies reanimate regardless of whether it's comic, TV or games. You die a full death and then the virus stimulates the brain."

Key is to make sure you eat and eat in the right combinations. We found some of the recipes to be really easy - french fries for example, if you use fry-light instead of cooking oil, and oven bake them, they are free and you can eat as much as you want. Want something sweet? Have a Muller corner or some honey dew melon.

Good luck and I sincerely hope you can find a way to enjoy it because it doesn't feel like you're dieting if you combine the foods you enjoy in the right way."
