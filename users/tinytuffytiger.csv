AskVet,fei02i3,t3_ep97bj,1579127369.0,"Keeping them separate and feeding next to the door is a good start. But you have to switch it up. Keep beds and towels and cozy stuff in there so their scent is on it. Then every other day, kitten goes in the bathroom.  I understand kitten is young and needs to play, so put him in there when he naps. Then let the older kitty out. 
  Also build a kitty highway. Steps and shelves that lead up so big kitty has an exit to get away and doesn't feel trapped. 
  It may take time. Also get a gate to go over the door so they can see each other sometimes. Once you can get them in the same room, find the kittens favorite toy. When he aims his attention on the older kitty, distract him with the toy. Wand toys work well for this. 
  It will happen, keep the faith."

dogs,fcjz09w,t3_ehf4hk,1577711137.0,"I've been lucky to have so many animal family members. Sometimes it felt like they were my only family. I'm older now and have lost so many. I'm torn apart inside every single time, so I understand and am so, so sorry for your loss. Just know in your heart he was one of the lucky ones because he had you. His life was short but full of love and meaning. And wow did he do a stunningly wonderful job getting you through all your trauma. What a good boy! You will have that love for the rest of your life and you will find and give even more love soon, because these pups and pets swell our hearts with their love, and you deserve it."

Dogtraining,fc6h9xq,t3_egaary,1577480546.0,My cats sleep with me. Close to me. I cannot recount the number of times I have kicked or elbowed them right in their little faces. Then they just get closer. I always kiss the booboos.
dogs,fc6gtmw,t3_egbn40,1577480244.0,"I understand thw idea of affording a pet. But there are SO MANY out there that need a home. They need love. I say better to live while they can with love, than die in a shelter. I think people need their love too. And sometimes its the most needy of us that need it the most. If you are willing to do the best you can by an animal with love, then the rest of us need to do what we can to help you."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fc5d38s,t1_fc4mt7a,1577453869.0,"Abqaiq. Aramco compound. Both of my grandparents worked for Aramco. My father grew up in Dhahran, my mom in Abqaiq. They met in the states, married, had my brother and myself, divorced. Then my mother remarried an engineer who worked for Aramco in Houston and I ended up growing up in the same little compound in the desert that she did. 3 generations. It was wonderful for me, I loved it."
