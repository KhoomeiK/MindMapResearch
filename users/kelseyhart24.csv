Don’t say “no” when you pull him away. In fact, don’t say anything. Your firm body language is enough. Plus you’ll stay sane instead of feeling like a broken record. 

Say “yes” as much as possible. The world is their oyster. Toddlers make messes learning through their senses. Allow them to explore unless they’re about to ignite a fire or cut off a body part."
