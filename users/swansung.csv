AskReddit,ff2bhfw,t3_er3a4t,1579499662.0,"Friendship was already dying because I performed a lot of emotional labor for E and they refused to reciprocate when I was in need.

I bailed out of signing a lease with E so they guilted me into watching their pet for a long weekend. Canceled all my plans and agreed.

From the get go I can tell this cat is abused. Endlessly needy and cries so loud when I leave her alone. I timed her. If I tried to write my essay for four minutes without paying attention to her she would bite my hand. If I ignored her she would draw blood. She wouldn't let me sleep. It sucked.

I remind E of when they are picking up the cat because E is flaky. E says the plane got cancelled can I watch her for one more day. Don't want to but what choice do I have? We agree on a new pick up time. 

Pick up time comes and I'm at E's apartment lobby with the cat and E won't respond. Get a text an hour later they want me to watch her one more day because they will get in late and can't miss class.

No. I tell E not my problem I'm here with the cat. No response. Hour later E slinks down the stairs. They weren't getting in late, they were already home. Had been since before I got there. Found out through a mutual friend the plane wasn't cancelled, E got home a day earlier and just wanted to pass off the cat on me.

Also, all throughout me trying to contact E, they swore at me and told me I don't love the cat and I'm a bitch.

How hypocritical. They used me, lied to me, manipulated me, insulted me, and thought they could get away with it. Massive red flag. Got a text from them a month later begging to borrow something from me and tried to shame me for refusing. Blocked them on everything and have never been happier."
