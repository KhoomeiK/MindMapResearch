Basically:

If you don't smoke, don't drink alcohol excessively, don't do drugs, then you have a lower risk of cancer.

If you stay away from processed foods and sugar, and eat more whole foods, fruits and vegetables, then you have a lower risk of cancer.

If you're active and a healthy weight (none of that ""healthy at any size"" bullshit), like you get 30-60 minutes of exercise a few times a week and you're in shape, then you have a lower risk of cancer.

I had a few family members die from cancer (and heart disease, which I've also worked in), and a lot of researchers I know had someone close to them die from one of those diseases as well.

The problem with the MSM is that they often write articles based on the results from animal studies, like you'll see something that says ""New Treatment killed cancer in rats!"" or something like that. Well, that may be true, but humans aren't rats, and we have to do *tons* of animal testing before it even gets to humans. And even *then* there's a high failure rate.
