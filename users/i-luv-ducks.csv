millenials,ff8kq4l,t1_ff4br9v,1579683167.0,"> they probably won't find these point and clicks mindblowing

The best games of that genre are called adventure games, and point-and-click is just how you get around. You have to solve puzzles, converse with other characters, learn about your environment, figure out what to do next, and so on. Action games are boring, because it's all how fast your reflexes are, with little reasoning or thinking things through to solve a problem.

> Most of them aren't too savvy with computers too and I could have easily assumed you're not into games at all if I met you in real life

I find that's true of younger generations as well...they are mostly into pointing and clicking with their thumbs on the smartphone...and that passes for gaming these days. I don't find younger people much savvier than older ones, when it comes to computer operations. If their system crashes, they're helpless, too.

But yes, younger folks treat me like I'm computer illiterate...so they go on explaining this and that about computers, even though I know far more than they do. They just can't wrap their heads around it. But I can repair or assemble my own system, and successfully troubleshoot just about any software or hardware glitch, when they have to pay a tech person to correct the problem. 

For example, I'm at a coffeehouse wanting to use their public wifi, but it doesn't appear on the wifi list. So I tell the young worker their Internet seems to be down. So she tells me I need to click on the wifi icon to find their connection! I told her, but that's just the point, you're not on this list, so I assume your router needs to be restarted. So she calls the manager over who hears me out and says, ""Wifi's been down all day, we have to wait for the tech guru to fix it."" 

But I tell him, ""Well, maybe not. Try unplugging the router, then plug it back in."" Sure enough, a few minutes after he did that, we had wifi!

The real gamers have always been a minority in any generation. As for myself, I've been very much involved with computer tech and Internet tech since 1985...even founded a Unix user group in 2000, and it's still going strong. And it is the older generations that gave this world personal computers and the Internet, in the first place. Who do you think invented broadband, BTW?

Obviously, common sense is not your forte, nor is it his. Your response is immature, if not downright imbecilic. Just because you have a nasty streak does not mean you're right. 

Another example: just because someone is afraid of spiders does not necessarily mean they're arachnophobic. The fear must be extreme. By that same token, one who does not like gross eating sounds does not necessarily make one misophonic. IOW: most likely neither one is suffering a mental disability. To claim otherwise, is labeling anyone who is grossed out by blatant eating noises (or spiders) as ill. Which is ridiculous.

https://www.dosbox.com/

They're old-school adventures, sci-fi and mystery games, lush with graphics, scenery, plots and character. Whereas so many popular games these days are shoot-em-up, blast 'em, make everything explode. There's not much /thinking/ going on. For me, that gets old really fast...just like me: I got old really fast (and you will too, if you're lucky, and I hope your are)! The nostalgia value of old DOS adventure games is amazing...they just grow better with age, like a fine wine! And you don't play 'em on a teensy screen with finger buttons...you play 'em on a real desktop or laptop. With a mouse, or key commands, or both. This is one of my favorite old DOS games site (many are free), check it out:

https://www.abandonwaredos.com/

Ever play ""Callahan's Crosstime Saloon,"" ""Day of the Tentacle,"" ""Discworld,"" ""Escape from Delirium,"" ""Hero's Quest"" series, ""In the Dead of Night,"" ""Kronolog: the Nazi Paradox,"" ""Leisure Suit Larry"" series, ""Lost in Time,"" ""Maniac Mansion,"" ""Monkey Island"" series, ""Mortville Manor,"" ""Omnicron Conspiracy,"" ""Police Quest"" series, ""Return to Ringworld,"" ""Sanitarium,"" ""Sherlock Holmes"" series, ""SpaceQquest"" series starring Roger Wilco the starship janitor, the ""Tex Murphy"" series, ""The Dig,"" ""The Gene Machine,"" ""Three Sisters Story,"" ""Toonstruck,"" ""Wayne's World,"" ""Zack McKracken and the Alien Mind Benders,"" and sooooo much more...these are just a drop in the bucket...games so old they're a whole new world again, for your generation (millenials and under)...and they ROCK...they'll knock your socks off (or whatever people wear on their feet in the 21st century)!

misanthropy,feq8djb,t1_feo8dke,1579338806.0,"> That's misophonia

I don't think it is, in many cases. Some of us just find disgusting eating habits...well...disgusting. Misophonia, as I understand it, triggers a much greater hostility than just disgust. I belong to a private library club, where I sometimes go to the snack room...which is the only place in the building where you can drink or eat. That room is usually quiet like the rest of the building, as it should be. It's also the only room where folks are welcome to talk, but they keep their voices low, almost a whisper, out of respect.

Well, there's this one woman who shows up now and then, and spreads a virtual picnic cornucopia of goodies and drinks across one entire, large table. Then she starts gnoshing, smacking her lips and making ""oooh"" and ""aaah"" sounds like she's having an orgasm. I can even hear the entire digestive process as the mucous-washed vittles dissolve, bubble and rumble down her esophagus and finally, into her stomach.

And this being a library building, reasonable silence is expected everywhere, even in the snack room, thus her gluttonous noises are especially horrific. No one else who shows up to enjoy a snack does that, including myself of course.

It's all I can do to put up with it before I just pack up and get outta that room...soon as I'm done with my own snack and coffee. Which I'm suddenly in a rush to consume, instead of enjoying a leisurely stay. Usually, I enjoy lingering over my laptop after finishing my scone and latte, since I'm already there and they have excellent wifi everywhere in the building. But when that lady shows up, I scoot outta there like a bomb's about to drop! Anyways:

Your speculation may have some wiggle room, if we are talking about a global disaster of lesser proportion than the one that's coming.
