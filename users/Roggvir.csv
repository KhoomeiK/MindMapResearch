manga,ff7hhox,t1_ff67a26,1579649664.0,"Original would be japanese, which I'm very very poor at. But I do have the power to use multiple dictionaries.

Japanese (怪しい) in this context should mean suspicious. ""Mysterious"" while valid according to [some dictionaries](https://jisho.org/word/怪しい), sounds contextually wrong and less common translation. [Google dictionary](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=ja&tl=en&text=怪しい) doesn't even list mysterious as one of the options, which is kind of important because google AI looks at frequency of its translation, not just is it in the dictionary.

As most JE dictionaries are all kinda the same. It's also valuable to do more J to other lang translations. Like J to K which is linguistically closer than English for more clues. [JK dict](https://ja.dict.naver.com/#/search?query=怪しい&range=all) also gives us definitions like suspicious, untrustworthy, as its main definitions and does not list mysterious.

The Korean (수상하다) in pic would be suspicious.

We can also see translations made by other people for subtitles.

>\[**怪しい**\] 何だろう？  
>\[Suspicious\] What is this?  
 
>全員**怪しい**ね。  
>They're all suspicious.  
  
>**怪しい**雰囲気に襲われる。  
>You will feel uneasy...

Given all the clues, I'd say **suspicious** is the correct translation."

specializedtools,fdvclsl,t1_fduw2fv,1578745983.0,"> I worked in a large scale juicing kitchen for 3 years

Upvote for someone with real experience. lol

And now I have additional keywords to search with! +cold press juicer

Cold pressed juice is a thing. So, I can accept that they exist, but what is *best* seems questionable. Best for it's audience, yes, but best at volume would be what large OJ factories do, which is neither (they just smoosh super fast with big spikes) and best at yield per input would be masticating due to higher pressure capacity. Though the downside of OJ method is need specific machine for specific fruit and masticating may need calibration per fruit. Whereas the cold press with grinder will take anything, anytime, all together.

Biggest cold press juicer I could find was [M800](https://www.juicedrite.com/machine/m800) whose capacity is 950L/h. X6 you mentioned had 360L/h peak. Whereas [this masticator](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/juicer-extractor-machine_60687954728.html?spm=a2700.7724838.0.0.464b780ebUEYkO) does 10T/h (10000L/h). So, I don't think hydraulic would win in volume. It also makes sense from an engineering point of view. Pressing with hydraulics over a large surface is just very inefficient. Either way, all you really need to do is get more machines if you needed even more volume.

Neither of these processes have intentional heat being added unless heat pasteurization is being used. And it's not like masticated juice comes out warm. So, I also can't help but wonder if there's any significant temperature change that causes a chemical change as a result of these different extraction methods. Some masticators are actually also being sold as cold press juicer,  and there's [absolutely^1](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/juicer-types-cold-press_n_2618000) [no^2](https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/tools-products/appliances/types-of-juicers) [shortage^3](https://www.50waystohelp.com/best-cold-press-juicers/) of sources that say masticators ARE cold presses. Since ""cold press"" isn't a legally protected phrase, I assume the language usage is quite the mess. Rather, the minority sites that do differentiate between cold press and masticators are the ones who sell the cold press.

I now get that they exist and that they serve a specific market."

specializedtools,fdt9wqe,t1_fdryan6,1578713830.0,"Disclaimer: I'm just an armchair redditor, not a juicing industry expert.

That's a very strange design for a commercial juicer. So I've been wasting an hour of my life looking into juicing technologies just now as it has piqued my interest. This giant veggie cannon looking like one is on the first page of searching for a juicer on youtube, and I've watched that as well.

Almost all the commercial juicer I found on alibaba (honestly best place to do a quick check on industrial machines) use conical screw type, aka masticating juicer type. I found exactly zero other which uses a hydraulic press to squeeze the juice out. I have however, found out that the chinese don't use the term ""masticating"" often as they should and frequently use ""hydraulic press"" incorrectly when they meant masticating.

The masticating juicer is exactly the same technology as the original gif of this post and pushes the product further into the other end with a screw which is an increasingly tighter space. It's just bigger. As it turns slowly, it applies extreme pressure and does it while still being relatively quiet.

Masticating seems highly superior in almost all ways to this hydraulic juicer.

* The hydraulic juicer grinds in a fast spinning blade to grind it into a pulp. But that causes greater oxidization of the juice, degrading the quality and lowering shelf life.
* This high RPM blade is likely very loud.
* Then it puts in into a cloth bag, that alone is not ideal.
* It uses a hydraulic press to squeeze the juices out. Maintaining hydraulics is more effort and increase in chance to contaminate food.
* The YT video said it uses 14 tons of force (not clear if american or metric) to press it. But given it's rough (eyeballing) surface of 75cm by 75cm, that means it'll get about 35psi (roughly the pressure of a car tire). While that's a lot better than what most humans would bother to do, but it's not even better than what humans can potentially wring out if we just did it in smaller batches.
* It also splashes in the very short demo.
* A masticating juicer could continuously output juice, but this one needs to swap between grinding and pressing separately, which involves human intervention as well. So it's slower and less automatic.
* Lastly, it's dangerous to operate this hydraulic press, in the YT video, the woman puts her hands between the presses to hold the bag several times while the machine is running! Meaning the press is a toggle switch, not something you have to hold down for it to operate.

Anyone who's serious about juicing at home buys a masticating juicer, and not a centrifugal one. Basically for the same reasons I just stated above.

So I don't understand why anyone would buy this hydraulic juicing machine unless you want to juice your stuff right in front of you or your customer's face. Because it's a lot more visually interesting to have a hydraulic press that they can see instead of it just going into some box and out comes juice and dried stuff.

But if you reduce it down to like 100m/day, while only being 1/3rd of the claim, is actually fairly easy for any well leveled life skiller. Just like 500 energy gathering (spread across the day, use alts too) and one good use of imperial (like pickled veggies) should get you close to 100m. That's honestly not that much of a play time.

Once you need to go past highly time efficient money making methods, you start spending more time for less profits. I can do 100m/day cooking and selling to market. That was what I was doing on christmas break since I had nothing else to do (like 5-6hrs/day). Someone could simply play 2x more than what I did, do some gathering and imperial and make 300m/day.
