rutgers,ff5pvb7,t3_erlcsl,1579605283.0,I'm a transfer student and its my first semester here...I'm actually pretty excited but nervous about how I'm gonna manage it with a full time job.
Myfitnesspal,fesoasr,t1_fesmjr5,1579367367.0,"Moto G6 play, I think"
Myfitnesspal,fesl771,t1_fesc475,1579366379.0,"Right?  
I've used this app for years but lately its just been so buggy, slow, and terrible. Idk why."
rutgers,feskzwk,t3_eq1zf2,1579366317.0,"I was honestly floored when I got in.  
I tranferred from a community college with a 2.8 GPA and thought there was no way I would be accepted. I wrote a pretty good admissions essay though, and had some extenuating circumstances that I think they took into consideration as well."
rutgers,fekccax,t1_fejug47,1579197082.0,That's what I thought too. It's my first semester and I've already heard how nuts they go with parking tickets...so I just wanted to be sure.
rutgers,fejiooi,t3_eox4sa,1579175956.0,"I've been having a series of anxiety attacks since I registered for classes on Tuesday lol. Its my first semester, and I'm 30 and I work full time and even trying to find classes that were feasible to fit in my schedule was a nightmare. 


Just try to take it one day at a time and set small, obtainable goals. No use stressing over things that you have no control over..."
xxfitness,fehadem,t1_feh8pqg,1579112468.0,"How is your form? I'd you can't have somebody check it, maybe try recording it and posting here for a form check. Are your shoulder blades tucked? Back arched? Are you getting the leg drive in as well? If your grip on the bar is too narrow you will use more triceps than chest...which could also make it harder.


I never knew how complex of a movement the bench press was until I had to figure out my own stall lol."
xxfitness,feha2hy,t3_ep0gs0,1579112285.0,"I grind my own gears for being a stress eater. I've managed to curb the behavior for the most part, but sometimes the stress exceeds my ability to cope and I go off on a binge. I'm trying as hard as I can to rectify this because I start a new college and new degree program next week and I'm ALREADY stressed about it when all I did was pick my classes yesterday lol.


I've also had 2 of my coworkers ask me the other day about IF. One of them just wanted my opinion and my experience with it, which is cool cause she did her research and was just asking what I thought. The other coworker seemed more concerned with how she could cheat the fasting window--""well can I drink smoothies during the fast?"" ""I can eat wherever I want during the feeding time, right?"" Like if the first thing you're looking to do is figure out a way to beat the system, maybe that way of eating just isn't for you?"
xxfitness,feh9coc,t1_feh33j9,1579111850.0,"I have no history of ED but I had to bow out of r/fasting cause it was leading to some super disordered thoughts, and I'd just prefer to not go down that road..."

Disgaea,fef7v3q,t3_eoltgn,1579050255.0,"I remember I got this game for my boyfriend at the time, because he was into Disgaea. I bought the game used and decided to try it out and needless to say...I found a new Christmas gift for him that year lol.


It got me into SRPGs in general, I played this endlessly."
Myfitnesspal,federm7,t1_fed6j6p,1579009517.0,Nice.
minnesotavikings,fdvkd3p,t1_fdtauqr,1578748350.0,Same. I'm ready to be hurt again.
xxfitness,fdm1hyo,t1_fdlwtid,1578537576.0,"Just the standard squat, bench, deadlift. Been running 5/3/1 for a while now."
xxfitness,fdlvuzp,t3_em1i7u,1578533733.0,"I used to have pretty noticable cellulite on my ass/thighs, but its almost completely gone thanks to lifting and weight loss. Would definitely recommend."
minnesotavikings,fdlqhns,t3_ely31y,1578530069.0,"Glad you're still here dude. Also, change your tag lol.  


I went through something very similar, was hospitalized for depression and alcoholism after a drunken suicide attempt. I'm 3.5 years sober now, and I'm thankful every day that I'm still here. The best is yet to come, my man. Stay strong, don't give up. Skol!!"
Myfitnesspal,fczo6pd,t3_ejiejf,1578105527.0,"It's been super slow for me for a while, but I thought it was just my phone..."
fatlogic,fcyu0ne,t1_fcytkuw,1578087058.0,"A fair amount done, I think. I didn't know that was a short amount of time lol. My boyfriend is in another game that'll run basically all day...like 10 hours. I can't imagine sitting at a table for that long lol. Needless to say, I sit that one out."
fatlogic,fcxw2k9,t1_fcxvkjt,1578071328.0,"Yeah, nobody in the group drinks but we'll spend a few minutes bs'ing then get to the actual game. Starts like 7:30-8 and ends around 10-10:30. Even that is a little too late for me since I hit the gym Saturday morning."
fatlogic,fcxurba,t1_fcxnr91,1578070701.0,Idk I get the Jr. Burrito when I go to Moe's and just skip the chips. It's enough to fill me up and less calories.
fatlogic,fcxu4by,t1_fcxqp5e,1578070521.0,"I feel you.


I have a group of friends I play D&D with every Friday night, and all they do during the game is sit around and eat junk food. I try to abstain but it's hard when it's absolutely everywhere. I would have dropped out of the game by now if my boyfriend wasn't the DM lol."
fatlogic,fcxm86r,t3_ejgni9,1578066308.0,"I went on a New Year's Eve pasta and dessert bender...but I weighed in today and I'm back down to my pre-binge weight. I'm getting less and less upset at weight fluctuations the more I deal with them. Very glad the holidays are over and I'm back to my regular routine.


My (former) kickboxing coach reached out to me and asked if I was coming back, and honestly I'd love to, but I feel like even a day or 2 a week would put a strain on me between work and school. I dropped out in September after I tore my elbow training for a fight and never made it back. Guess I'll have to see what my workload is like..."
fatlogic,fcu0kl7,t1_fcts1n8,1577968355.0,"My mom used to tell me that too when I was a teen complaining about lower stomach fat--that it was genetic, all the women in our family have it, and there's nothing I can do lol."
fatlogic,fcnulpx,t3_ei3zsk,1577818732.0,"I've mostly maintained throughout the holiday season (started at 168 lbs weighed in today at 173, I'll take it), but am I ever glad it's over after today. Semi-stressing over a New Year's Eve party I'm going to tonight...there will be an abundance of pasta and moderation is my weakness, especially when it comes to carbs.



Decided to switch from 4 days lifting and 1 day cardio to 3 days lifting and 2 days of cardio. Mostly because it'll help more with weight loss, but also because I just want more time to play Dance Dance Revolution lol."
fatlogic,fc97zb4,t1_fc8lzeo,1577548482.0,"My boyfriend and I both lift together, and I was very thankful for his strength and my weight loss when he had to scoop me up off the floor and carry me to the couch after a really bad foot cramp put me down.


I woulda felt real bad if I was too heavy to lift."
fatlogic,fc5nmd6,t3_egc9c3,1577462167.0,"It's not even New Year's yet and I'm already sick of my coworker talking about the ""smoothie diet"" that she's going on in order to detox. I'm taking bets on how long it takes her to give up on the smoothies and go back to eating Dunkin Donuts every morning.


I ate all the food on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, but was right back in the gym the next morning and back on my regular eating plan. I consider it a victory how I actually looked forward to getting my diet back on track after the holidays, when in the past it would trigger a several day/week long bingefest. I've set some lifting goals that I hope to accomplish in the new year, as well as finally hitting my goal weight."
xxfitness,fc39qc8,t1_fc35d3a,1577384879.0,"Happened to me too. I pulled something in my back deadlifting last year and was relegated to machines for 2 months while it healed...and to this day, I hit a certain weight on my squats and deadlifts where I mentally just can't do it cause I'm afraid of getting hurt again.



What helps is just giving myself little cues as I'm lifting, focusing on correct form which takes the focus off of ""ohgoditssoheavyimmahurtmyself"" lol"
xxfitness,fc391iq,t3_eftrmf,1577384395.0,"Well I ate all the food Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, but you better believe my happy ass was up at 5:30 this morning to hit the gym before work. I'm sure I'll just end up maintaining this week as well with as much as I ate the last 2 days, but I feel pretty good about easily sliding back into my regular routine, and even looking forward to it.


I have a ton of gifted treats, which I'll likely bring to my D&D game tomorrow for my friends to dispose of. I'm not gonna lie and say that I'm not tempted by the giant sheet of Rice Crispy Treat  though lol."

xxfitness,fbv19rw,t3_ee8cqx,1577123743.0,"I was super strict around Thanksgiving--avoided all office food and celebrations, kept packing my lunch, and ate whatever and however much I wanted on actual Thanksgiving.



...Christmas, unfortunately, hasn't worked out for me like that. I've resigned myself to maintenance last week and through the beginning of this week, because being so strict around Thanksgiving really, REALLY stressed me out lol. I'll keep it reasonable Christmas Eve and Day...but I'd like to find a balance between sticking to my goals and enjoying the holidays."
minnesotavikings,fbksmeb,t3_edifpx,1576954976.0,I have a soft spot for the Jaguars...but I'm strictly a Vikings fan.
