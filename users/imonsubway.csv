I wonder if it's contributing to not being able to burp. But from what I've read anxiety can cause yawning as well, which I notice sometimes too. So you might be yawning even more if you have both."
noburp,ffa7uxn,t3_es6xpx,1579729586.0,I used to get that a lot when I was going to uni and had really bad symptoms from all the air trapped in my intestines. Thought it was caused by stress or anxiety though. I'm not getting this pain anymore since I've stopped going to classes and mostly stay at home so the stress and anxiety is reduces but also I don't have to withhold any gas while at home. So not sure if it's related to no-burp. I can't really imagine how would it cause that kind of pain.
noburp,ff8qhr6,t3_es9zqz,1579691847.0,Thank you for this information. Good luck on your procedure
noburp,feqi9da,t1_feqd8xj,1579342169.0,Me too
noburp,fdn66mh,t1_fdmysn3,1578578381.0,Damn. Do you get as embaressed as I do when it happens around people?
socialanxiety,fcl3l39,t1_fckdbfe,1577739054.0,"It's so refreshing to see someone who still has the strength to try to change things, even though how hard it is. Very brave of you. Good luck."
socialanxiety,fckafue,t1_fck3jl6,1577720846.0,"True. Although beating your own thoughts tends to be very exhausting, and that's where meditation can help with it. I've been using this app called headspace to meditate, it taught me to instead of getting to a place where I feel angry with myself and my thoughts and how I can't change, I just notice the thoughts. Instead of judging them and trying to change them. I think it's helpful at the beginning of the process. I think it might be  harder to change if you don't accept yourself first."
socialanxiety,fck0x9r,t3_ehir4w,1577713154.0,"So... I've realised like a week ago that all of those feelings come from me thinking badly of myself or other people. When the truth is nothing bad almost ever happens, and even if someone is actually mean to me/disrespectful/condenscending/whatever I don't care, because if they're the kind of person that likes to be mean I don't want anything to do with them. And their opinion does not reflect on who I am. So basically whenever I feel bad around someone I remind myself that it's all in my head, made up by myself (well, more likely internalised from people around me while growing up). So maybe it's time to stop believing it. By reasoning with it. Everytime you feel off. And remember that no one else is responsible for your feelings. It's all up to you, whether you see them as flawed and sad and looking for a way to make themselves feel better at the expense of others, because it's the only way they know how to make themselves feel better, and therefore you feel sorry for them, or you think they saw you for who you are and are now giving you what you think you deserve, making you feel attacked and scared and wanting to die. Or whatever it might be."
depression,fcj1p79,t1_fcib039,1577675074.0,"That is such a good point. I wish you all the best on your journey to liking yourself, you're definitely not alone on it. The fact that you like yourself sometimes, on good days, is a very promising sign."
depression,fchek57,t1_fch701z,1577649750.0,"The thought that no one will ever love you might be projecting your lack of acceptance for yourself while having much more acceptance towards other people. I think it's a common thing, especially when you think of all of those negative ways we tend to talk to ourself in our own head, which we would never say to anyone else. And that's why there's definitely a chance for you to meet a special someone."
depression,fcg5szf,t3_eh1hgi,1577636754.0,Do you feel like you could love someone similar to you and accept all of his problems?
noburp,fcg4q1l,t1_fcas08f,1577636437.0,Do you drink it out of a bottle or a glass? Might be the thing you're drinking it out of that causes swallowing more air
noburp,fc9asl2,t1_fc8uy1h,1577549790.0,Do you drink mostly water?
noburp,fc8fcfz,t3_egpr0b,1577533653.0,"Same. Maybe it's because of how you drink? If you're not covering your entire lip while drinking, you will be swalling air that gets in your mouth during taking a sip. I also think exhaling while swalling helps swallow less air. You can see for yourself, if you focus on your way of swallowing, what makes you swallow more or less air and figure out what works best for you."
noburp,fc2mcbo,t3_efv89w,1577366944.0,My mother can't burp as well
noburp,fc1okkf,t3_efoweh,1577324834.0,Slice of lemon?
ibs,fbhcikf,t1_fbccrtr,1576870428.0,"Thank you for the info and I'm happy you're getting better! I used to drink kefir which has the same properties as kombucha, and I didn't get those sounds, so maybe it is about the microbiota. I'll see if it works. :)"
