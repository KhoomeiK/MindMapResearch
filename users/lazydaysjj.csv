dogs,ff4dyy4,t3_erexgm,1579561345.0,The dog is extremely bored and under-stimulated. Jack Russels are a high energy breed and they need mental and physical exercise every day. Can you take him to a doggie day care or something? Take him for walks or play with toys? It sounds like this dog is getting no attention at all and is just spending a lot of time kenneled. You won't know how serious the issue is unless you actually try to help the dog first.
dogs,ff4ajej,t3_erht0y,1579559129.0,"With rescue dogs there is a higher chance that they will be fearful, possibly bite, or be just poorly socialized in general. It's just a sad truth of what happens to dogs when they are ignored, abused, or on the streets without human interaction. 

The way to get around this is to foster a dog first, before committing to adopt. It probably depends where you live, but in my city there are perfectly healthy, friendly, smart dogs that get abandoned for no reason and are ready to be someone's next great family member. Don't feel bad about wanting a dog that doesn't try to bite people, really experienced and patient people usually adopt those types of dogs. Try looking for a dog that is already in a foster home or a dog that can be fostered for a trial period. Any decent rescue will allow you to test out the dog in your home before committing to the adoption (you'll have to fill out some forms of course). While you are fostering, make sure you give the dog space and time to warm up and don't immediately put them in uncomfortable or stressful situations. Make sure you think about your future and whether you need a dog that is good with babies or kids, cats, other dogs, etc. 

Sorry that was long. Yes some shelters tend to put a positive spin on dog's profiles which I think is super irresponsible and ultimately just creates bad situations. Either wait to find a dog that is right for you or start looking at responsible breeders. However remember that a puppy is a HUGE amount of work and responsibility and will be much more expensive up front (fees, shots, neutering, etc.)"
xxfitness,fenkulg,t3_epyia6,1579286844.0,"Does anyone have cheap reccs for sports bras that have lining/padding that is sewn in and NOT removable. I don't need a lot of support so I don't care about that, just need bras that will keep my nipples from poking out! I'm so sick of dealing with removable padding."
homeowners,fee70b7,t1_fedgq4f,1579027704.0,"I would never recommend someone get a dog ""for home security"". If you want a dog, and it happens to be a great alarm system, that's great! Dogs are very expensive and time consuming and sometimes they really suck at home defense (run and hide, are too friendly, etc.) They require a lot of time, energy, and money and they live for 10-16 years."
homeowners,fee6pq9,t3_eokcob,1579027532.0,"A lot of people in my neighborhood catch people on camera checking if their doors are locked on houses and cars at night or odd hours. Always lock your freaking doors people!

That being said, I was burglarized a few months ago by breaking a window and it really sucks having your house violated like that. You can consider getting some outdoor security cameras, motion sensor flood lights, etc. You could also get a digital keypad front door lock that automatically locks for you. 

I have a Ring Camera for the front door, $3 a month to keep the recordings on the cloud. I also have a Wyze cam (meant for indoors) that has free 14 day rolling cloud storage. Ring and Wyze also sell motion sensors and door alarms to connect. There are tons of affordable options so you'll just have to check out what you're looking for specifically."
birthcontrol,fe9ecal,t3_eo6xr7,1578936818.0,"Most likely BV, could be the hormones/foreign object throwing off your natural PH balance and whatnot. Definitely see a dr. and get tested for everything though."
phoenix,fe95xrv,t3_en0nue,1578934620.0,"There will be a lot more homeless people then you are used to, like along Cave Creek rd. and near major intersections. Also probably more general crime than north Peoria. Definitely drive around these areas at all times of the day and night to get a feel for it. Also remember older houses require more work and more things tend to break."
phoenix,fdqwqh0,t1_fdp4wmu,1578675972.0,"Absolutely not. Some parents have incredibly wrong information and teach their children things that are not correct. Or they teach them religious myths and crazy shit. Or nothing at all. Every child in school should learn accurate information.

My parents didn't teach me a single thing about sex. I learned it in school sex ed and it was accurate and extremely helpful to me."
phoenix,fdqw91w,t1_fdpm3gn,1578675708.0,"Some girls start their period in 5th or 6th grade and sometimes shitty parents don't explain things to them, it's good to start with the basics even earlier."
HomeImprovement,fdolasg,t3_emcrkh,1578607446.0,"Looks great! I really like the cabinet color you chose, I feel like it will still look good in 10, 20 years. You can always change out other elements if they fall out of style. You put a couple plants (real or fake) in there too to add some color. 

I have the same exact 'before' cabinets as you and I hate them so much, whoever decided orange oak was a good look needs to be punched in the face."
phoenix,fdnw24w,t1_fdnuqpm,1578594009.0,Just avoid 19th avenue and the west side of Hatcher. Wouldn't suggest walking around alone but it's really not that dangerous. I see children and little old ladies walk around by themselves all the time and never hear about anything bad happening.
phoenix,fdnu9l7,t3_em1cn6,1578592956.0,"Come to Sunnyslope there's tons here. Carolina's, Los Reyes de la torta, Via delosantos, Los Taquitos, and there's a bunch more I haven't tried yet. Tacos Chiwas has great street tacos too, they are a bit farther downtown. Ladera is also really good but it's a higher end concept."
SkincareAddiction,fdnkuz2,t1_fdn2nzi,1578587919.0,"Yeah I would stick to it, I'm not very sensitive and don't vomit easily but doxy made me vomit violently and immediately on an empty stomach."
phoenix,fdkdq24,t1_fdjew2f,1578501699.0,Finding parking is not bad unless it's a busy first friday or big event somewhere. You can usually find a meter or park in a garage. There is free street parking in certain places but that's harder to find. Also some restaurants actually do have (free) parking lots.
phoenix,fdh3vwf,t1_fdf9gnr,1578414822.0,"The difference here is that if you have an average budget you can live in a really nice, nearly crime-free area. Most people choose that over living in a higher crime area."
phoenix,fdh34l8,t1_fdel8nn,1578414357.0,"It's a tad sketch in that there's a lot of junkies and general criminals lurking around, shootings occasionally. It's mostly just ugly. Lots of families live here and most of the crime is burglary and theft."
dogs,fdh0sis,t3_el4u0u,1578412888.0,"It happened to my little 8lb yorkie walking in the neighborhood, attacked by an off-leash german shepherd. The injuries from the attack nearly killed her, and she required wound cleaning and irrigation daily and almost had to have a skin graft. Luckily she recovered with no long term damage. I think the shitty owner paid the first bill but my parents had to foot the rest of those costs. People suck. 

Having a little dog is a bit easier because you could pick them up if needed but it's hard to avoid a loose dog when you have larger or multiple dogs. I would suggest carrying a stick, spray, airhorn, or some kind of defense to use to scare away dogs if needed."
phoenix,fdekjjq,t3_ekj2ea,1578340980.0,"It's a fun time, large open venue so it feels laid back but still gets a good crowd for headliners. You can bring a blanket and sit in the grass or stand. I've been like three times and always had a lot of fun."
StarWars,fcysy3t,t1_fcw8r6s,1578086400.0,Lol this is a movie for children and Rey is the heroine of a million little girls out there. They were never going to make her evil.
phoenix,fcvcvmw,t3_eimoj5,1577999448.0,"Trees and shade are your best defense against the heat, so if you don't want grass just do concrete/rock with some shade trees and maybe do an extended patio or shade sails. Or you can get a free standing gazebo thing for more shade."
AskReddit,fcnyp2c,t1_fcnqejj,1577821000.0,Nah just certain people tend to be super open about every private detail of their lives regardless of where they are or who they're talking to.
Endo,fcnfc3t,t1_fcn8o1s,1577810553.0,"Jeez if you have a family history of crohns and blood in your stool you need to get a colonoscopy, I would try finding a new GI doctor."

dogs,fcl0obk,t3_eho07v,1577737259.0,"It can be difficult at times. In my opinion having pets is worth it, but it is a struggle sometimes to get out of bed to let them outside or take them for walks when I'm not feeling well.

I sometimes get easily frustrated with my dog when they have accidents in the house or won't eat, won't stop barking, wake me up in the middle of the night, etc. Also having anxiety means that a pet is one more thing to worry about constantly (worrying about their health and well being, what happens if they get out and get lost). Also financial impact if you struggle with money, a dog can rack up bills pretty quick if they get sick or injured. 

But like I said, it's worth it to me. I have had dogs my whole life and couldn't imagine not having pets. If you find the right dog to fit into your lifestyle it can be a great thing. You can always try fostering too to see how life with a dog would be for you."
phoenix,fckxgsr,t1_fc68axd,1577735285.0,100%. Servers struggle to pick up any and all shifts they can get in the summer and come away with much less in tips. But if you take full advantage of snowbird/tourism season and save your money you'll have a nice summer with extra time off to travel.
phoenix,fckx485,t3_eglu1o,1577735071.0,"I love In-n-out for a fast food burger but The Stand is great and I would totally recommend that over INO. Also my two favorite pizza places in the city are Cibo and The Parlor, in case you can't get in to Pizzeria bianco."
phoenix,fc5ntw0,t3_egbn4k,1577462286.0,"I don't know if that's a deal breaker, I guess it depends how many house options you have in your price range. We were disclosed our house had scorpions too, which we had dealt with before so we weren't too bothered by it. You have to walk around with a blacklight at night looking for them inside and outside and kill any you find. Also clean up landscaping because they love to hide near trees/bushes and in cracks along walls and stuff. 

Oddly enough, I went the first 18 years of my life never seeing a scorpion and then all of a sudden we had them in our house, and in two other houses I've lived since."
Endo,fbusmdj,t3_eem3n6,1577119709.0,"I've had pain in my right side, upper middle and lower but not all at the same time. I got a ultrasound and CT scan that showed a hemangioma on my liver (which is supposed to be benign and painless) but I didn't get my ovaries checked yet. I think it's partially GI related. I had a colonoscopy that was clear but I think the pain might still be related to my colon and stress levels. 

So yeah still don't know what's really causing the pain, but eating healthy and managing stress helps."
