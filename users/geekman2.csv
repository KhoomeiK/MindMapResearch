asktransgender,fc6as14,t1_fc6alg5,1577476222.0,"Yeah, part of the issue is that we're both hella gay and tend towards being pretty effeminate, so it's kinda tough for me to know where the line is between normal and hurtful.

For example, using ""gay voice"" and saying he looks ""Fabulous"", fine. Saying he's my beautiful princess, probably not fine, even though I will and have said that to cisgender men."
asktransgender,fc69mq7,t1_fc69dvz,1577475458.0,"Thanks for replying. I actually already do this. But he's said one or two things that make me want to make him feel better. Like he said, somewhat self-consciously that I'm ""more masc"" than he is. Basically, he's awesome and I want to make him feel awesome"

I'm mostly just asking if there's anything that's kinda fun and out there that is kind of ""hyper-masculine"". If I were dating a girl I have all kinds of things that I do which girls love and most guys don't (musicals, shopping, ice skating, etc.). But I don't know what the inverse set is for guys"
LowStakesConspiracies,fc65o2i,t3_egeduh,1577472843.0,"This is less of a low stakes conspiracy than laziness. Whenever Microsoft updates a piece of the OS, they ""turn off"" certain parts of the functionality, with no apparent regard for how it affects the system. And because of the way the Windows OS is designed, a restart is the only thing that will fix it."
