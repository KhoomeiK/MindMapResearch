thedivision,fcb24vf,t3_egvfhu,1577581260.0,"As someone who bought this game for $120 the day it came out, I have played this religiously since March. There is a lot to say about this game, but the raid killed this game. It put the most sought after gun (EB) in a mission or raid that only a select few could have the possibility to get it. It may sound silly, but it divided the player base. Many people who had the EB got it because they know 7 other people who are willing to play with them. You don’t even have to be good, because at the end of the day, it all depends what’s in the loot box. That made certain people feel superior over others and that’s when the trolls game out and it just changed the mood of all players. I also think people thought they were going to update this game WEEKLY and provide new content all the time. After a few months when people realized they will do minor updates and add a couple missions every few MONTHS, people started to realize it’s either get a new game or replay the same missions over and over and over and over and over.....after you do the endgame, it is what it’s marketed as: LOOTER SHOOTER. You do the same missions, the same bounties, etc. The only thing not the same is the DZ, but that can become kind of flaky because people find hacks and shortcuts to creating builds that give them unfair advantage (see “patched DZ builds in google”). It can be fun because they are some NPc’s, but everything you get you have to extract and your not guaranteed to be able to distract anything. Essentially, you can spend hours in the DZ and never get any new gear.

Once people realized the same missions are going to be replayed over and over again, it started to create a little friction and frustration. People started to get bored and builds can only get so good until you start over. There were people who were literally creating a new character every week just to make the game more challenging. I actually like mastering the missions, but the game is now like $12, which says a lot about a game that was gonna have consistent updates for months and was just released 9
Months ago. I paid 10x that (but I got well over my moneys worth, so I don’t care...but I know many people who do).

Also, since the game is so cheap, a lot of the people playing the game are your younger folks. Matchmaking is much different than it was in the summer. Lately, I seem to get paired with people who have little knowledge how the game works. However, does make for a challenge :)

Happy New Year"

I have the money to do it, but I am actually investing big money in streaming with my XBOX. That may sound funny to some, but I just threw down $300 on a green screen, $200 for a light....and willing to upgrade my mic and camera if I can some recommendations. 

I just feel like the returns on a desktop for the money you put into it may not even out. I could buy a prebuilt PC for 5K and still not be guaranteed to stream or play every Triple A at 4K Quality. I may have to invest another $400 into the PC just for this one game to perform the way I want it. Since I am not tech savvy, what am I gonna do if I want to upgrade? I am gonna have to pay someone to do that. It's just not worth it.

depression_help,fc50w8y,t1_fc508ux,1577437391.0,"It’s wierd. I been like this for a few years. I only leave my house for work, dr’s and grocery shopping (sometimes won’t even leave for that and just get delivery).  I don’t even want to do anything for fun. I am currently taking Wellbutrin (150 mg) and experimenting what works best. I was taking 300 MG and that was making me “woozy”. I am not a huge fan of anything that makes me sleepy, relaxed, or “chill”. Before I started going through depression, I had anxiety. But it was a healthy type of anxiety, if it wasn’t healthy, it was an anxiety I was able to channel. I was a DJ who djed two or three times in the weekend. I would be so excited to do that, I was always in a good mood.

From 2010-2017, I was on Norco pain pills. Got into car accident July of 2009 and the rest is history. I  would have never started taking them if I knew I was gonna get hooked. I tried to stop taking them around 2013, but the physical withdrawals were so insane, I kept poppin’. Combine that with drinking socially, and taking adderall a here or there...I wasn’t in a good spot. I was able to still hold part of my life in a responsible manner and it’s not like I was committing crimes or doing anything illegal. It just was tearing me up inside.

2017 is when I landed my current full time job. I stopped pills and only takes prescriptions. I have no desire to take pills or drink or do drugs or do anything social for that matter. I just want to be happy. I just want to have some of my interests back. Please don’t list a bunch of things I need to do. People do that and honestly I wouldn’t know where to start. 

Anyways, I am hurting inside. I just don’t know what to do or what to think. My mom started contacting me after not seeing her for 4 years. I told her the other day I am worthless and I hate my life, and that I am useless.  I don’t have nothing to offer. I believe this part is true. I just want to have a girlfriend and live an easy going life. Mm

Anyways, have a good one and thanks for responding"
depression,fc4zr8g,t3_eg57ap,1577435732.0,Thanks for responding but I am actually giving up. Well In the process. It’s just too difficult. I want to be happy. I want to have friends. I don’t want to worry.
depression,fc4q6ps,t1_fc4ikw9,1577424453.0,"Ok I’ll look at that. I am already taking Adderall , which helps, but only what I AM DOING SOMETHING. It will backfire if I take it and then do nothing. Anxiety shoots up like a rocket. I am just not in a good place and I wish I could feel better . I hate feeling like this. I don’t know anymore"
getting_over_it,fc2dqqa,t3_eeyern,1577354250.0,"Thank you to everyone who commented. It means a lot. To be honest, I don’t even know where to start. With the stress and depression still getting worse, I don’t even know what course of action I should take. I spent the holidays by myself. Crying myself asleep. I been to the psych ward for being honest and that made me feel worse (sitting in a locked room with nothing to do....yeah that doesn’t help). I have had the cops pick me up from work because I told my boss I wanted to kill myself. I have had my grandma cry herself to sleep because I said I wanted to kill my self (didn’t really have plans but just didn’t want to be here anymore)
The last few months I have been trying to get better. I don’t drink, smoke...I don’t even socialize.  My body and mind are hurting right now. I am thankful to be in this subreddit. I just want someone to learn from my thoughts. I don’t have friends to talk too. I just left my counselor because I felt uncomfortable and about to leave my psychiatrist. I have no where to turn. I am not gonna call some hotline either; I don’t feel like taking my life, I just hate myself and about to give up. I just want to fail and fail and see what it feels like to just fail. If I do that, I will have no expectations.

Thanks for all your replies. Happy New Year!"
getting_over_it,fbzwpdx,t3_eeyern,1577265723.0,I don’t know where to start....it all sounds sound but I just don’t know where to start. I just hate my life. Thank you for responding but I don’t know if I can make it. I might be going to the police tomorrow and go to psych ward. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I hope I don’t wake up tomorrow on Christmas. I never thought in million years I would odder those words. It was nice knowing you guys. Happy New Year and I hope you have a great holiday.

It would work, then I would lose signal to the tv (I play on console).I would still have a connection to the software but I would have to view everything on my MacBook Pro (and not my OLED LG)

I know that Apple and new windows computers are starting to release with USB C connections and do away with traditional USB ports. This can become troublesome when Elgato does not have a USB C cable to go into a computer from the capture card.

Long story short...a powered USB Hub is the safest option."
