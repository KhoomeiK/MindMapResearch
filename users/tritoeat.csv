You don't want them pressed rigidly against each other, but take a look at your feet and you can see where your legs have a bit of extra movement.

Also, totally follow through on your stroke. If you watch your hand at the end of your pull, you are pulling it out of the water a tad early. Imagine that instead of reaching back up for your next stroke, you are trying to rotate your arm in an entire circle like a windmill. When you get to your hips, you wouldn't hike your hand back up toward your head, you'd just let it keep rising up. Your hand should exit the water palm up with a little flick.

Look for slip hazards in your home and try to mitigate those, like put a rug at the bottom of the stairs, things like that. 

My dog was diagnosed last year, a little before her 6th birthday, because I noticed her bunny hopping on the stairs. Some days she is a little stiffer, a little slower to move around, and where she used to race laps through the yard, now she'll usually stop after one.

If you weren't playing your game in class you wouldn't have had to worry about getting in trouble, but you can hardly fault your friends for not knowing that ""I'm playing a game"" means ""I'm going through some stuff and need time to decompress"" - and I don't know that yelling at them to shut up is going to do it, either. 
Still, they should have backed off after your obvious agitation, and coming to you later and making it some weird contest was a dick move."

AmItheAsshole,fek5wd9,t3_epls9h,1579193268.0,"YTA. He has made a reasonable request, and saying you don't care because it doesn't bother you is a jerk move. Noise doesn't bother me when I'm creeping to bed at night, but I stay quiet because my husband is sleeping. Think of others. Don't be the guy who gets desk-eating banned for everyone else because you can't handle it."

When I got my girl, still the biggest chicken you have ever met, I was sure she didn't like treats. I gave a bag away because she was so disinterested, and I remember sitting right next to her eating this cheesy bbq pork dip, and her little nose didn't so much as twitch. 

Suffice it to say, I was wrong on the treats! I thought hey, she's sitting next to me, she lets me touch her and pick her up, we're good.

Looking back, I realize that she was still scared to death. I've had her almost 9 years and her little personality is *still* unfurling. Be loving and gentle and teach your dog that your home is his home, but give him a minute. He'll get there. :)"

If she persists or pouts, then tell her it's because your wife does the same in bed! Make it awkward for her and she'll stop making it awkward for you."
AmItheAsshole,fejctxx,t3_epgz4c,1579167656.0,"NTA. Airports suck and you can't really talk or do much on a plane, and she should be grateful you (and Rachel!) can make it at all. Go when it works for you; Bridezilla will survive."
AmItheAsshole,fejcnfh,t3_eph4ke,1579167386.0,"NAH. It's not fun to feel excluded, but as you said, it's by your own choice. I promise you, there is room for everyone. They aren't dropping you just because they have a common interest."

AmItheAsshole,fejbvvi,t3_epgy4p,1579166220.0,"YTA. Part of having a partner is sucking it up and doing things that matter to them. The poor girl already tried to work around you and it didn't go so well. Take one for the team, dude."
