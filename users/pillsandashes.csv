fatlogic,fcpokkk,t3_ei2y94,1577868769.0,"I love soy products but they're not worth having a fatal allergic reaction over. Caring about your health and watching your intake of nutrients doesn't mean that you are confirming to diet culture. It means that you are trying to make healthy changes in your life and to improve your health. Nothing is wrong with that. Also, intuitive eating doesn't mean stuffing yourself with cake and doughnuts all day because your body is ""telling"" you to. If you keep feeding yourself garbage, your body will crave garbage."
