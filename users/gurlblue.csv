essentialoils,ff4v8l3,t3_erf3ie,1579573251.0,I too but oils from a MLM and not 1/2 that you‚Äôre likely thinking. I add them to my shampoo and conditioner as well as make hair treatments with different carrier oils and EO combinations and I do a different mix with rose hip and grape seed oil with different oils for my face each day. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs good genes or the things I do but I get compliments on my appearance vs age quite a bit. Or it could all be silly flattery... either way I‚Äôll take it. :)

twilight,fcv09ls,t1_fcuzod2,1577992025.0,It‚Äôs actually just a True Value but they played along.
twilight,fcuy35p,t1_fcuxgrs,1577990826.0,I misspoke by just saying movie. I just binged the movies on tbs a couple weeks ago so that was on my mind. But the store was in the books.
twilight,fcuy0hx,t1_fcuxgrs,1577990783.0,"No, I‚Äôm the books."
cats,fcun4g3,t3_d84umo,1577984548.0,Hah!
twilight,fcumxds,t1_fcumlac,1577984439.0,"A lot of what you see in the movie is based on what is really there in Forks. So there is a hardware/sporting goods  store that was the idea for her work place. You‚Äôll see Charlie‚Äôs house is not the same as the movie house but it‚Äôs what inspired it and so on. Also, once you get a look at Forks High think of how funny that prom scene is. Haha. Def not the place to be holding such an extravagant event. Still love it tho. 

I almost took a job at the clinic where Carlisle worked but ended up going to Alaska instead. Kinda wish I would have if only for a year or so."
twilight,fcumho0,t1_fcumbof,1577984183.0,"Oh, that‚Äôs funny. Well have lots of fun. We did all the major highlights but our fav thing was when we went to the store Bella worked at and they noticed it was Twihards coming in they would page Bella overhead to the front of the store. It was cute."
twilight,fcum4n0,t3_ej0976,1577983978.0,"I used to live in Washington. I took the Forks trip twice with Twilight fans friends. It was fun. Not sure how it will be so many years later. I lived there during the height of Twilight. However, one thing that won‚Äôt change is how beautiful the beaches are on the res. Definitely check them out. Second beach is my fav."

respiratorytherapy,fcqrp0j,t3_eiixqf,1577891159.0,Ok. We didn‚Äôt think so but needed that validation. The doc didn‚Äôt want to intubate. Guy is going to crump hard. I said I can‚Äôt bring him down on bipap it‚Äôs not mri safe. She‚Äôs like well just use o2. üò´ thankfully super smart np came around and agreed he needs to be intubated so crisis avoided.

migraine,fbm1k0u,t3_edx5hb,1576975864.0,"The thought of getting an aura makes me very anxious. I always get them before a migraine. Sometimes I get them and then get no headache after. But yeah, they‚Äôre the worst. You know I lived in Alaska for 5 years and I wouldn‚Äôt even look more than a glance at the Northern Lights bc they remind me so much of my auras."
