That isn’t rambling. This is your living situation for now, a home environment. I feel your frustrations on a holy level. My roommates had bedbugs in their rooms, filth and trash piling up, they’d use my towels, bedding, or anything clean or resourceful (soap, toothpaste, body wash etc) of mine when I would visit family (landlord installed locks on our bedrooms after this). It’s pathetic how deluded these little piggies can get, it’s like they think they’re living with mommy & daddy who will pickup and cleanup after them, or the opposite and were raised in dirt and filth. I tried everything from swapping chores around so everyone got a fair share to having us look after our sole self, and ourselves alone. None of this worked. Even worse was their friends who treated our apartment like a trap house. Just know (to me, and any other competent human) you are completely valid in your comments/frustrations. Washing dishes is a routine and expected task while living independently, no excuses there."

Edit: listen, you downvoting degenerates. Nearly all running democratic candidates for president have already been in government for 20+ years. Yet a majority of issues existed for forever and most people are blaming Trump for that. Trump has been in office three years and accomplished more than they ever have or will. It’s not like there weren’t Democrat presidents or Democrat majorities in the House and in the Senate to have addressed and fixed these issues, so no excuses there. If you prefer to plead ignorance: Trump, for a **fact**: lowered taxes (80% of Americans report paying less taxes), began building the wall; reformed immigration, pulled the US from the Paris accords, brought many troops home from the ME; created greater fairness in NATO/UN (ensuring all countries payed equally, frequented by the Obama administration without ever accomplishing anything); USMCA. He’s boosted our economy with deregulation and lowered corporate taxes which creates more jobs. He strategically killed a glorified terrorist leader, and guess what, without engaging in a Third World War! Fun fact, he has appointed more gays in office than any other president in history, showing and proving his acceptance. Whether or not you accept these things as positive, they are accomplishments, not opinions. We have observed record breaking stock-market growth, wage increases, and excellent consumer/business relations or growth. You are living under a rock to deny the economy has grown significantly under the Trump administration.


Second edit: Annnnd you have all proved yourselves incapable of political discourse. ‘Orange man bad’ ‘He’s a criminal’, ‘He wasn’t assinated’ etc etc. Sad how deluded Democrats are to the fact their own party is guilty of egregious crimes, corruption, and death. Fun mention of the Clinton’s ties with Epstein, how they often visited his rapist island (when trump did NOT) but it doesn’t matter because trump is in a few pictures with him, so he’s the bad guy. Obama killing 30,000 innocent civilians (that’s what we DO know), no biggie, he’s a Democrat! Isn’t it awesome? Democrats achieve a ‘black’ vote by manipulating desperate minorities into supporting them, all to forget about them during their time in office. Obama, our first black president, did NOTHING to advance the position of black people in America. Pathetically pitifully. Democrats aren’t clowns, they are the whole damned circus."
