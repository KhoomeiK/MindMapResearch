I remember having that aching/ twisting feeling that was constant. Then the out of place teeth that had a brace would rip up the inside of my mouth. The wax they give to cover/ smooth them would always fall of. I’m so happy w/ my teeth now but it was a long road.
The tooth from the roof of my mouth had to be cut open so it could grow out. I had a “pack” stitched into my mouth for weeks..then they start to move the tooth. Looks like this person went thru something similar for that front center one."
