NoStupidQuestions,ffahmkb,t3_esk5q5,1579735940.0,"Smoking is the easiest, and you just light the end of it and breathe in. Don't suck though, same with vaping. 

Edibles are a cleaner way to go about it (in terms of smell and smoke), but those are hard to control in terms of your high and how long it will take. Take one and wait a while. The high won't be immediate, so taking a bunch at once because you ""arent getting high"" is just going to result in a bad time after an hour or so if you arent used to it."

birthcontrol,ffa2lws,t3_esgt79,1579726637.0,"I can only give a brief answer to the first one, but a semi-detailed one for the second. 

When I got Nexplanon I bled for about a month. I think you may be worried that its a large amount, when its common for it to be semi-heavy then nothing but super light spotting/bleeding. 

For the second, it was a marketing tactic. They included this pill-free week to make it seem less ""invasive"" to the body and have it seem more natural. In current times, while it's known to not be as much of a guarantee of not being pregnant like a normal period, a lot of people use it for piece of mind. Not having any regular bleeding on Nexplanon completely freaked me out and I spent a lot on pregnancy tests (even though I knew I was safe. Anxiety is weird like that). On the pill, I get pretty heavy bleeding and it puts my mind at ease. Plus, this way, I avoid breakthrough bleeding like I had experienced on other forms of birth control."
birthcontrol,ffa1yiz,t3_esh5lh,1579726260.0,"My EC symptoms lasted for a bit longer (a couple days) but nothing major. I do not have an IUD and never have, but from the friends i've seen who have gotten them they said some side effects were major and some minor. Your body also went through a lot getting the IUD in there, so I wouldnt necessarily be surprised. 

Also, if youre worried these are pregnancy symptoms, those are said to show up a bit later than what you're feeling. 

When it comes to chances of pregnancy I cant really say. I'll say low, but I cant tell you with full confidence since im not an obgyn or anything.

Worrying to this extent about your birth control is far from healthy. If you are this worried about it, abstain from sex until you find proper help.

Get help. We are not your therapists and you cannot keep entertaining this obsession. This is not normal and healthy. Go to a therapist.

birthcontrol,ff9ou7h,t3_esde1s,1579717548.0,"Okay, so im gonna go through some points here on what you've written

1. For her to get pregnancy symptoms 11 hours after this, if she was even able to get pregnant from this, would be a medical mystery. The sperm has to swim through, join with the egg (which can take anywhere from a few hours to 3 or so days). Then it has to implant into her uterus, which would take about a week at least or even longer. Then her body would have to start producing the pregnancy hormone HCG, then thats when symptoms would start. 

2. You would be very unlucky (in this case), but also a huge shocker to a lot of people if she got pregnant. For the precum to contain living sperm, get onto her underwear, swim through her vagina, and fertilize an egg would be a huge suprirse. Like, really really big surprise. 

3. I mean you could take Plan B or a morning after pill like it, but I'd consider that money down the drain. I understand you are very stressed and I get that, but I want to stress that her being pregnant would be such a huge shock to everyone on this sub. 

4. If you are super stressed still, the most you can do is just take a pregnancy test in 3 weeks. That'll give you a very very accurate result. 

Again, I want to say it as much as possible, I do not think she's pregnant. At all. I'd tell you if there was a chance but I do not see one."
birthcontrol,ff9nsu6,t3_esflzv,1579716872.0,"Short answer: Not a bad idea to take Plan B, throw away the rest of your pack and skip your placebo week, take a test in 3 weeks. 

Long answer: Missing pills in the third week is risky because that can cause trouble during the placebo week. Follow your pills pamphlet instructions on missing two pills, then skip your placebo week entirely to help you. 

You had sex at a risky time, so I suggest taking Plan B or another emergency contraceptive. 

I cant say the exact chances of you getting pregnant, but I can just say they're more than if you hadn't missed those pills. 

If this is a common occurance (you mentioned you were pregnant before), it might be time to looking into another form of birth control that isnt dependent on you remembering to take it every day (like the IUD, implant, patch, shot, etc.) 

If you plan on having sex any time in the next week, use condoms. Do not have unprotected sex as you'll be risking pregnancy still. 

All you can do now though in terms of pregnancy is taking a test 3 weeks from now."

relationship_advice,ff9b50y,t1_ff998gh,1579708951.0,"Exactly. I think he's worried about losing something great, but I think he has to realize that you can't have both things at once."
relationship_advice,ff998sb,t3_esclg4,1579707765.0,"I mean, there's a few possibilities here. One is that he IS poly and wants to explore it but is scared of letting something good go, perhaps he isn't poly but wants more of a swingers deal with a partner, or there's the chance he isn't polyamorous and is just simply not ready to settle down with one person and wants to live that ""singles life"" more. Both pretty valid, I mean whatever floats his boat. 

In each situation, though, there's a few things you have to remember. First, this doesnt sound like its about you at all. If you ever worry that he's tired of you or doesnt like you, I really dont feel that that's the case. It sounds like he's having his own internal battle rather than a ""my relationship is boring"" type. 

Another thing to consider is how long you are willing to stick around while he thinks about it. How long are you willing to be with someone who is on the fence about being with you at all, you know? You gotta think about what's right for you, and if his waiting about on a decision becomes too long for you, you have to stand up for yourself and possibly be the one to end it. 

And last, you mentioned you were confused since you keep things exciting in the bedroom. Again though, I dont think anything you've done is a reason he may want to go. It's just the fact you are one when he may want many. In those situations you could be a sex god but if someone wants more people in the bedroom there's nothing you can do personally to change that."

The hymen doesn't mean jack squat.

I was a virgin (or at least never experienced insertion) when I got with my boyfriend and never bled. 

It's also highly disrespectful to call you a liar in terms of your virginity. Your sexual background **does not matter** in any current relationship unless you have a disease due to sex that could easily be transmitted through sex (like HIV or other STI/STDs), and him accusing you of lying starts to show your insecurity anyways. And to think every virgin is supposed to bleed and be all ""omg what do I do"" is wild. 

Next, it's 100x more disrespectful of him to accuse you of being in a sexual relationship with your father. And all of his ""evidence"" is just him obsessing over the fact you don't fit his idea of what a virgin girl should be and looking to be insecure as could be over this situation.

birthcontrol,ff77mhp,t3_ery70v,1579642710.0,"If you're talking about the placebo, it can take a good few days for your withdrawal bleed to show up. Even then, not bleeding is not as big of a red flag of being pregnant as missing an actual period could/would be. 

It also takes anywhere from 3-6 months for your body to get used to the hormones you're putting in it. 

If you're super worried, just take a pregnancy test 3 weeks after any sex you considered ""risky"". After those 21 days you can trust the result you get, positive or negative."

If it's been 5 days past the sex you had, emergency contraception will not be necessary as the time to take it has already passed to protect you against pregnancy. And even if it hasn't been 5 days, the longer you wait the longer the pill will not work as emergency contraception. The copper IUD may still work really well though, i'm not sure if the efficacy lessens at all before the 5 day mark.

birthcontrol,ff749xm,t3_es0sli,1579640824.0,"Emergency Contraceptive pills are a large dose of hormones that can easily mess with the average function of things in your body. Getting some spotting is common. 

Now, could you be pregnant though? I mean, medically speaking, sure. But there's no way for us to tell you how likely it is you are. That depends on a variety of factors, anything from BMI (higher BMI's can make some EC less likely to work) to if you already ovulated or not (if you did, EC isn't super effective). 

In my opinion are you? I wouldn't say so. Just make sure to take a pregnancy test 3 weeks after the unprotected sex you had. And if you continue to keep having sex like this, it might be worthwhile to look into a birth control method such as the pill, implant, IUD, patch, or shot. Or condoms."

The pill stops your ovaries from releasing that egg.It takes 21 days for your ovaries to fully be suppressed from ovulating and for other effects to take place. Once 21 pills have been taken, it's going to take a  while for your ovaries to be ready to release an egg again. 

So by 14 days, your ovaries aren't at the ""I'm going to need a minute to get going again"" phase, but more at the ""I could go for releasing an egg if I get the opportunity"" phase.

So if you're on a 21 active pill pack, you must take at LEAST 21 before you can stop for your placebo. Any earlier and you risk ovulatuon/pregnancy. But if you took, lets say, 26 then stopped for 7 days youre still fine.

It sounds like he's frustrated that he doesn't know exactly what you want. It might be damaging his ego, which sucks and probably dkesn't feel good but is again not your fault. 

Talk to him and tell him how this made you feel. Ask why it made him angry enougb to yell, and i'd suggest discussing how to go about communication. If his way of telling you ""im frustrated"" is by yelling at you and blaming you, then thats gotta change."

(This might be long, im sorry.) 

Abusers like control. With him, he liked the fact I was on his mind 24/7 when we were together. And afterwords, he was getting the last laugh anyways. I was diagnosed with PTSD and left to pick up the pieces of myself and my other relationships, when all he did was call me a liar,ask for his stuff back, and got with the girl he cheated on me with. I saw him around town and at my university, smiling and essentially living a normal life when the first time I saw him at my uni I had a panic attack. I was pissed. I thought, ""how dare he be like this while i'm suffering. Its all his fault.""  

I wanted revenge. I wanted to scream at him in the halls, let everyone know what he had done. I wanted to write him a letter just unloading my emotions onto him. I wanted something bad to happen to him. I wanted that ""last laugh"" and justice. 

But these daydreams never got me anywhere. It didnt even effect him. He still lived his life and went along with whatever he was doing. I realized I was still in the position I was when he and I were together: obsessed, uncontrollable, and hurting. 

So I tried a different angle. Instead of constantly dreaming of his demise, maybe I should just forget about him altogether. To not let him take up this space in my head anymore. My therapist suggested forgiveness. And it didnt mean approaching him and telling him ""Its fine, I forgive you."" It was entirely a move I madefor myself and me alone. That was the point of it all. 

Forgiving him meant saying to myself ""What happened was terrifying and effected me greatly. But I am ready to move on."" And this feels like justice to me. To know he no longer, in any way, has a hold on me is a freeing feeling that I always looked for. Constantly imagining his downfall held me down, and forgiveness has finally allowed me to get that weight off of me. It was loving myself in a way I didnt know. 


But, as I said, I understand your feeling. It makes a lot of sense, and honestly there's another person who assaulted me and its still hard for me to imagine forgiving the same way I forgave my ex."

But, grief comes in many forms. It's not really wrong to not feel as much sadness as people around you may expect you too.  And it can also vary on the relationship one had with their parents. For example, I believe my mom will be crushed when either of her parents die. My father, along with the rest of the family, most likely won't bat an eye to either of his parents die."

Let's say a boy at a park gets beat up. We'll call him Joe. People get hurt and maybe get into fights at the park all the time, but Joe seems to get it a lot worse and it's not due to any apparent/valid reason.  Joe gets angry and afraid, so he begins a movement where he says ""My life matters, too!"" Meaning Joe shouldn't be beat up for no reason and he shouldn't feel any more afraid of going to the park than others. Some agree with Joe, but others get angry about it. Like, ""how dare Joe thinks he struggles with this."" Therefore, people disagreeing with him begin to yell about how Joe isn't special and everyone's life matters. They scream so loud that some can't hear Joe so well. Joe might still get beat up more now because people couldn't hear Joe."

At 21 you should be WAY more mature and have much different goals and lifestyle than a 16 year old. Not only does it show how completely immature he was, it also shows that yes he most likely had some desires that fit the description of a pedophile."
