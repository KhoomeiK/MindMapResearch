It's a really small town so the city would take a loader and grader to it a few times a year. When it rains sometimes it floods and there have been trenches at least 10 feet deep before.

exFLDS,feq1n11,t1_feq0fdd,1579336165.0,He seemed nice to us but we were told from a young age that he was basically next to god so of course we went with whatever he said. The tapes were just his meetings and teachings.
exFLDS,feniqbb,t1_femudaf,1579285558.0,"The united order was the same united order that the mormons tried living in Orderville  except after they established that you gave everything to the storehouse and you got every from the storehouse they took it further and that was when the FLDS reallly turned into a cult. 

They came out with new revelations telling us we needed to go through our houses and donate everything we didn't need on a day to day basis. If you used it less than every week, it was a want and not a need and therefore should be sent to the lord's storehouse. We also had papers to fill out which was basically inventory for everything we owned, down to the spices in the kitchen. We also had to consecrate our home to the lord. To do that, we packed up everything in the house, drove to the storehouse, took it all inside the storehouse, gave them our sheet telling what all we had, and then we left it there and went to a waiting area and waited for them to come tell us what the lord had decided we needed. If god decided we didn't need something, we left it there. 

They came out with revelations that said we had to deep clean our house from top to bottom every month. There were specific rules on how you were to do this. It directed how you would wash, right hand for clean, left for dirty, you had tf o start at the center of the ceiling and work out from there. The same clean/dirty rules applied to laundry, dishes, and taking a shower.

There were also revelations telling us what we could and couldn't eat. We couldn't eat corn, sugar, plain milk (milk products were fine), white flour, or anything excessively processed, just to name a few that I remember. There was about 15-20 things we could not eat. 

This covers a lot but not all of it. Hope this answers part of your question. If there's anything you don't understand or want more elaboration on, I'm willing to help out."
exFLDS,femigxs,t3_epww3q,1579257257.0,Lyle is in prison currently for food stamp fraud and running away while he was on house arrest. He's almost always been Warren's right hand man but also has always been less than Warren. He was the bishop before warren was arrested and then he wasn't the bishop for a couple years and then he became bishop again when the church started implementing the United Order.
exFLDS,femffx8,t1_femeqxd,1579252705.0,"Marriages were like a regular wedding but very simple. They used regular wedding vows but used ""sister"" and ""brother"" (do you, brother Brown, take sister Greene) and they replaced ""til death do us part"" with ""for time and all eternity"". I also think the entire ceremony was a prayer, much like an anointing in the mormon church. I was never there for a wedding as they were a close family only event. There haven't been any church marriages in a really long time now, probably at least 10 years. 
For me growing up, sunday school was a song, reading from I think the doctrine and covenants, listen to Warren Jeffs tape, and Sacrement. Our sacrament was basically the same as mormon Sacrement."
