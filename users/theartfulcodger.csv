Oh, FFS. The price differential is *global*.

Again, OFFS; it affects the *global* price.

> Notley even explicitly stated that it was in response to the transportation issues which plague the Alberta market 

Notley was fighting with BC to get a pipeline built, and facing an election in just a few months. *Of course* she was going to politicize the pipeline issue, and try to press her case in the court of Albertans' opinion. She did so by making a series of duplicitious and false statements whose sole purpose was to camouflage the fundamental and ongoing reduction of global enthusiasm for Alberta's dirty bitumen.

> Alberta can only get so much oil out to market therefore it experiences a differential. 

Once again: supply restricted by a transport bottleneck should *increase* commodity prices. It shouldn't *discount* prices. The fact that you claim those discounts are the result of *restricted supply* due to a transport bottleneck indicates you have no knowledge of fundamental economic principles. 

> If it cuts back production the bottleneck is less pronounced because production is more closely matched to transportation.

Even more nonsense. If a so-called transport bottleneck exists, *the capacity to ship* is the key determinant of market supply - not *output at source* - and the existence of said bottleneck is therefore also the key determinant in setting *price*. So long as output remains sufficient to fill the pipes, wellhead prices should remain *stable.* But they have in fact taken a nosedive, so clearly buyers are now making their offers based not on shipping capacity, but instead on Kenney's foolish move to once again overproduce, and Alberta producers' consequent and growing desperation to sell at disadvatageous prices. And soon they will be selling  below cost, because they will be *desperate* for cash flow.  In such economic conditions, *increasing* market supply by building additional transport capacity will only flood the market with more unwanted bitumen, which will cause the price differential to *grow* - not *shrink*.

> Then explain Maya prices.

That's what I've asked *you* to do. If transportation is the problem, why is the additional WCS supply being pushed down the Mainline/Keystone not selling at Maya prices? Answer: *BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT EQUIVALENT COMMODITIES.* The fact that refiners prefer to buy Maya, even at higher prices and when WCS is readily available at the terminal, is proof."
canada,fe4gzcp,t1_fe1our0,1578859182.0,"What drivel. 

If the problem was a transport bottleneck instead of oversupply, then Notley's cutback in production would not have affected the price differential in the radical way it did, by almost instantaneously *reducing* it 60%, to less than ten bucks a barrel.  Your so-called ""transportation bottleneck"" - not *production* - would have still remained the key factor determining market supply, and therefore the price for WCS would have remained both stable and deeply discounted, despite production cutbacks. The fact that the Notley cutback reduced the price differential in such a substantial way, so quickly, is a clear indication that *world markets* believe overproduction is the key factor in determining the fair price for Alberta WCS - even if *you* don't.

What's more, the additional 150K barrels a day of Alberta crude now being outputted via the Mainline and Keystone - as the article notes - would now be expected to sell at a *premium*, as according to your ""bottleneck"" model it would be adding desired supply to pent-up demand, and eager buyers would be bidding it up. But that's not what's happening, is it? Instead, that additional supply is once more selling at a near-record discount. *Because despite sitting in a port ready for the taking, few buyers want it.*

The bottom line is that few processors see any need to buy Alberta's dirty, expensive-to-refine oil when there are better quality stocks readily available at prices that are not only stable and predictable but, historically speaking, remain quite reasonable.

Yet somehow Fat Jason thinks the solution to this fundamental problem of lack of demand for Alberta crude lies in *increasing* the oversupply of unwanted, sulfur-laden crude on world markets by nearly 2 million barrels a day. His foolish move has again driven the market discount for WCS from a mere $9.50 a barrel under the NDP exactly a year ago, back up to $24 under the UCP, today. And as demonstrated above, this substantial drop in the offer price would not have occurred if a ""transport bottleneck"" was the key factor affecting supply - so clearly, Alberta's problem is once again overproduction, not transport capacity.

As I said, Kenney - and apparently *you, too* - believes that the ineluctable laws of supply and demand (the key one here being *demand*) don't apply to God's Own Anointed. Adding pipeline capacity won't do anything to affect the discounts being offered by the market. If anything, it will only *increase* them, by pouring more and more unwanted WCS into the market."
canada,fe0uf92,t1_fdzpk6q,1578818737.0,"The substantial price differential between WCS and WTC has absolutely nothing to do with ""Canada's unwillingness to build anything"". 

You're deliberately presenting a false narrative by asserting that the difference in price is somehow due to transportation bottlenecks, but nothing could be further from the truth - or for that matter, further from basic economics. Increasing market supply of any commodity by increasing the volume and speed at which it can be delivered *reduces* that commodity's price; it doesn't *increase* it.

**The growing price difference is due to a large and preexisting glut of WCS that has in fact been building for several years due to *overproduction*, and a continued lack of market demand for Alberta product due to a glut of more processable conventional crude.**

The previous NDP government wisely ordered a production cutback of more than 2.25 million barrels a week, in order to reduce the massive backlog of supply that nobody wanted even back then (save at fire sale prices). That move resulted in the price of WCS delivery contracts jumping, in anticipation of reduced supply in the future, as the oversupply was eliminated over time.

But now the ignorant UCP has *double*-fucked Alberta in the ass by steadily reducing the NDP-mandated production cutbacks to almost zero. This rocket-scientist move on Fat Jason's part has again *increased* the province's glut of WCS, at precisely a time when demand is once again *shrinking* due to an oversupply of conventional oils like WTC on world markets. Which of course has resulted in WCS' market price again being discounted down to near-crisis levels.

It's just further proof of idiot conservatives' perpetual belief that fundamental economic principles of supply and demand magically cease to apply, if and when they're put in charge of running things."

todayilearned,fdsxusc,t3_emw9a7,1578709360.0,"Several years ago, I was the property master for a Disney movie that had a brief scene requiring about 40 live lobsters. It was easy for me to arrange with a local seafood wholesaler to acquire them, but getting rid of them proved to be highly problematic. 

Disney protocol is that after their moment under the floodlights, its animal performers are to be given a long, happy retirement. What's more, I was required to send a memo to the studio executive in charge of our production detailing exactly what I had done with our lobsters. So if I had merely said, ""I divided them among the crew"", or ""I gave them to the caterers to fix for lunch"", or even ""The producers took them off my hands"",  I would have been in big trouble.

Lobsters being an Atlantic species, nor could I just release them into the nearby Pacific; in fact, when I inquired, the DFO had advised me that doing so would likely result in the production company incurring heavy fines, and possibly even criminal charges being laid. Eventually I ended up calling the local aquarium and asking if they could possibly use our crustacean movie stars for, say, their Atlantic exhibit. Chief Aquariumologist said, ""Sure, we'll be happy to take them off your hands!""

So immediately after the lobster scene was complete, I packed them into a couple of coolers with lots of ice and had the transport department take them to the aquarium. At the end of the day, and half afraid some driver had absconded to his own freezer with them,  I called my aquarium contact to confirm that the correct number of lobsters had arrived, and that they were received in good condition. 

He replied, ""Yup, they arrived cold but fine. They've been transferred to a tank to warm up. In fact, right now they're making friends with a couple of our Giant Pacific Octopuses!"" 

The next day I emailed a memo to our studio executive advising that Disney's animal performer protocol had been followed, and that our lobster stars would be well cared for in retirement, by the local aquarium staff. I just didn't bother to mention how *brief* that retirement might have been. And those two octopuses probably became the fussiest gourmets this side of the continental divide."

My mom learned to make these (she added a bit of baking powder) from her own Baba: a tough old Saskatchewan homesteader, and to the end of her days as resourceful a provider, and as frugal a homemaker and cook, as God ever created. 

Mom mostly served these in soup, as a kind of spoon-dropped, free-form pasta halfway between spaetzle and gnocchi. But we'd have them as a main dish, too - first boiled, then lightly browned in butter or bacon drippings, and mixed with diced fried onions, garden peas, and a few crumbs of leftover bacon, ham or sausage. 

My father was a poorly paid civil servant, and with four hungry kids sitting expectantly at the table, these were usually served near the end of the month, as a means of stretching out the groceries until next payday.

They have a delightfully chewy texture, and because of their high gluten ratio, if they sit in refrigerated, leftover soup, they don't soak up all the broth and go mooshy, as do egg noodles or elbow macaroni. So with the incorporation of a bit of diced carrot and celery, and a few frozen peas, a big pot of ""lump soup"" (as we call it) is a great way to use up that gallon of turkey broth that is inevitably generated the day after a Christmas or Thanksgiving dinner.

My sister still makes them regularly, and my now-grownup nieces still beg for them on visits home: the fifth or maybe even the sixth generation in our family to enjoy them. So again, thanks for the memories."

It's the difference between buying prepackaged ""lunchables"", and buying some beer sausage and a box of crackers: the first is going to cost you substantially more per unit weight than the latter.

You can save quite a bit by buying regular frozen veggies (better selection, too) and create your own *reusable* steam bags by going at a heavy duty zipper bag with a hole punch, or just piercing a few tiny slots with a knife.

Don't put them in the dryer though, because that ruins the zipper. Just hang up to dry.

In terms of nutritional quality, frozen often *beats* fresh. This is because frozen veg are typically processed within a day or two of harvest, whereas fresh-to-market veggies have to be picked at the inside edge of ripeness, then shipped in refrigerated trucks, sometimes from thousands of miles away. This makes them lose more nutrition every day they remain in transit or are stored at the distributor. And because of this, market veggies are usually modern hybrids designed with *taste* way down the list of desired attributes. Instead, they're bred primarily for an attractive shelf appearance (generally means plump and therefore full of water), to withstand multiple rough handlings over the length of the distribution chain, and to survive long periods in refrigeration (both transport and storage) without wilting or spoiling.

But because neither appearance, multiple pawings-over nor perishability are issues for farmers who raise crops for commercial processing, they tend to use traditional varietals whose flavour has been developed over multiple generations, and whose nutritional values have remain uncompromised by over-hybridization. They're also able to let their crops field-ripen for longer, which adds nutritional value, whereas market veggies are usually picked in their earliest stage of acceptable ripeness."

While the presenters were working that night's ~~suckers~~ crowd (about 200) into a frenzy of avarice, I used the back of my pay envelope to show my excited cousin that for him to rise just to Level Eight of his ""personalized"" Ten Level Pyramid of Success, he and his ~~under-suckers~~ pyramid base would have to sign up more than 56,000,000 customers: not quite twice as many signups as there were Canadians to be signed. I then pointed out that if even *one in ten* of that night's crowd signed up, and even if they collectively persuaded *over a sixth of humanity* to sign onto their phone plan, all of them would*still* be just on Level 8.

Cousin went for it anyway, and ""invested"" $225 in the starter package that night.

I've just examined my reflection very closely. Here's what I found: 

* *I* have never secretly sworn allegiance to a foreign nation; 

* nor have *I* ever secretly registered for the military service of a foreign power; 

* nor have *I* ever claimed that I was the best choice to lead *this* nation, after having sworn allegiance to *another*; 

* nor have *I* ever tried to foist the cost of my children's private education onto my employer.

So it appears my house is not ""entirely made of glass"" after all. In fact, in comparison with The Scheer House Of Lies, it is solid as granite. 

Andrew Scheer did *all four* of these things. Those are four perfectly valid reasons for me to ""throw stones"" not only at Scheer, but at all those who were gullible, unethical and power-hungry enough to have ever supported such a duplicitous, despicable, amoral weasel of a man in the first place. It's not that they are poor judges of character - though they clearly are. It's that they don't give a *fuck* about rotten character, if they see a path to power through it.

Where *on earth* did I ""cheer for the good guys""?  Or for that matter, *any* guys?

Me pointing out unethical and indefensible behaviour on the part of a dishonest politician, and they ethical hypocrisy of all his foolish followers is not ""taking sides"" - it's merely calling out unethical and indefensible behaviour on the part a dishonest politician, and the ethical hypocrisy of all his foolish followers.

Of course there was a *huge* party in the zocalo: live music, drinks, dancing, fireworks, silly hats. It was very exciting for a couple of Canadian gringos who, up until then, had not spent much time outside of Mexico's resort zones. In fact, it felt rather like out-take footage from the village *fiesta* in *Romancing the Stone*. 

There was still a strong Zapatista movement in the vicinity, (the rebels had briefly seized the town five years earlier) with frequent truck hijackings, kidnappings and so on. Even several days before New Year, there wasn't much in the way of oil, cooking gas, rice, coffee, masa, bottled water or other basics to be had in the local shops, because people were hoarding. There was a rumour that the Zapatistas were going to come down from the mountains, using the New Year's Eve celebration as cover, and would try to retake the town. So the locals had begun buying up all the staples they could afford, in anticipation of having to cope with a week or more of civil chaos. In fact, for the previous few days, it had been a challenge for us to get fed much more than beans, rice, chicken and tortillas at the local restaurants, as they too were running out of supplies.

Anyway, because of the rumours of a rebel assault, on New Year's Eve there was a strong military and police presence - both army and *federales* - spread throughout the town, and the patrols were especially visible in the party-zone zocalo.

But not only did nothing happen, jsut before midnight, one of the rebel leaders called a local radio station, and informed them categorically that the townsfolk could relax, there would be no invasion that night. Why not? Because earlier that day, the rebels had all put on their good clothes, snuck down from the hills, and were dancing and getting drunk in the town square, along with everybody else - right under the noses of the army and *federales*."

Despite all that, Waldmann and Stein prevailed, and the judge ruled that the contingency agreement Neinstein had their client sign was invalid and a blatant violation of the Ontario Solicitors Act. And he reduced their fees by more than half, leaving their client with roughly two-thirds of the award. 

*Then* Waldman/Stein persuaded their  client to join with several others and launch a class action suit against Neinstein LLP, which claimed that over 1,800 of their clients were also the victims of unauthorized double-dipping, in and unfair practice that stretched back more than a decade. That suit was certified as a class action in 2017.

Combine a crushed clove of garlic with a couple tablespoons each of soy, ketchup and olive (or other) oil. Add a teaspoon of dried oregano and a half tsp of ground pepper.

It can now be broiled (duh) or pan seared for 3-7 minutes per side. Let rest for a few minutes, then slice thinly *across* the grain (chop for your young'uns) and enjoy. Because of the cut's leanness and toothsome flavour, leftovers make excellent roast beef sandwiches, hot or cold.
