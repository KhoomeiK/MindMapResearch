ballpython,fehyjwf,t1_fehsgbo,1579126458.0,I already bought  25 adult and 25 jumbo :/  but thanks for the advice !
ballpython,fehyapb,t1_fehtrzm,1579126303.0,I make sure the temperature of the mouse is 89-95F when I feed. I put my mice in hot water just as hot as my sink can go I leave it until the mice feels soft and replace the hot water again leave for 5 min then feed and no I donâ€™t wet them I leave them in a ziploc bag
ballpython,fehm8rm,t3_ep4ylg,1579119401.0,Heat mats are great as well so your noodle can get belly heat (: I do also have a res turtle that I use a heat bulb for itâ€™s the zilla blue day light 75watt it lasts about 6 months and the flukers clamp lamp the 5-5in (: I order from chewy so if a light goes out before the 6 months then just email them and theyâ€™ll send a new one your way !!!!  Free of charge (: Hope this helps
AskWomen,fehlo2y,t3_ep42zh,1579119066.0,I just wash my face with the dove soap bar and follow up with the Dickinson toner & then the Vaseline cocoa butter cream in the am & pm I have oily skin btw so it works perfectly for me (:
ballpython,fehk4ck,t1_fehjaof,1579118176.0,Ooo thanks!
BallPythons,fdmpaqx,t3_em6q42,1578559141.0,Make your your temperatures/ setup are correct 90F on the hot side and 75F on the cool and leave the snake alone for a week to de stress and get used to his new home. 60% humidity is required or you can add a humidity box in his tank.
dogs,fdijjei,t1_fdijbxi,1578444328.0,So glad you made the decision to keep his life (: and Iâ€™m glad that everything is going well good luck!
BallPythons,fd5dpjq,t3_ek1gkg,1578176634.0,Keep the substrate dry no need to mist what you can do is just add a humidity  box with damp moss but make sure itâ€™s not on there for too long
ballpython,fd5cwzh,t3_ek23pa,1578176386.0,If he doesnâ€™t drink water you can soak him for 10-15 min put something in the tub so he can grab on too and feel secure
ballpython,fd5cqvl,t1_fd5bw1b,1578176333.0,The rat should be a little bit bigger than your snakes thickest part so when he eats it should leave a lump not big but noticeable

dogs,fczmghe,t3_ej8z1z,1578104432.0,teach your dog to know his place !!!! to know where heâ€™s supposed to be and where heâ€™s not! Get him a doggy bed and train him not to go up on any couches or beds he needs to be corrected show him whoâ€™s boss. Put him in submissive posture every time he does something wrong or and reward him with treats when he does good. Your dog was correcting your son basically by telling him this is my area and youâ€™re in it because if he really was aggressive and he actually meant to bite your son he wouldâ€™ve done more damage to his face. Now you have to correct your dog by teaching both your dog and family members that the humans are on top of the pack and your dog is on the bottom rank. My dog was aggressive nipped me once but he meant no harm just correction no need to take a life.
dogs,fczkqqb,t3_ejjx3p,1578103368.0,You giving your dogs treats while barking & pulling is encouraging bad behavior. Every time you use your leash and your dog sees another dog stay relaxed dogs feel your tension and turn around walk the other direction the moment your dog starts to pull. After your turn around call your dog and if they make eye contact reward them. Try boiled chicken as a treat hope this somewhat helps lol
dogs,fczjoo4,t3_ej3iup,1578102714.0,At least you didnâ€™t wake up to the smell of crap in your home ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
dogs,fczjj0g,t3_ejkped,1578102616.0,Allergies/worms maybe ? Im not sure but a good brand of food is Victor works wonders (:
dogs,fczj8ro,t1_fczj50n,1578102444.0,Also thereâ€™s a conditioner of trizCHLOR4 but thats around 25$ idk why lol but my dog seems to be doing good with the Burts bees
dogs,fczj50n,t3_ejo5vp,1578102382.0,"Vet products are overpriced most of the time my girl  had bad dandruff, dry skin/allergies and Iâ€™ve used a shampoo called TrizCHLOR 4 shampoo it WORKED INSTANTLY! even great for cats/horses etc .. Also for yeast infections! I really do recommend it you can find it on Chewy for around 12$ ! I first lather up my dog then leave it on for about 5 min rinse and repeat then leave it on for 10 min and rinse then I follow up with a cheap Burts Bees conditioner (the oatmeal one)  I really do hope you try it out my dog was a flaky mess and now she has a shiny soft coat! Sheâ€™s a pit/Shepard mix also I do like to mix some coconut oil in her kibble it every now and then (:"

ballpython,fcoy83i,t3_ehq4cg,1577844880.0,You donâ€™t need to change your bedding you can just add a humidity hide for your noodle (: so your bedding doesnâ€™t mold very quick and she probably hasnâ€™t eaten in a while so itâ€™s best to try live hoppers instead of adult mice because she may not be strong enough to wrap around the mice fully so the mice has a chance to fight back and hurt your noodle (: once she eats about 6 to 7 hoppers you can size up in mouse (: hope this helps
ballpython,fcoxoj2,t3_ehwmu9,1577844438.0,They probably just got those snakes thatâ€™s why they are so healthy I can be wrong but most snakes at petco have bad sheds and are very underweight ):
