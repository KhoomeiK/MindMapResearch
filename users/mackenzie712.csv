depression,fcz7ry3,t3_ejnao7,1578095389.0,"this is exactly how i feel when i open up to people. in most cases, i start the convo surrounding my mental health, then i change my mind within 5 minutes and decide not to speak on it after all because i feel like more of a burden. plus i’m scared it’ll make people leave me"
