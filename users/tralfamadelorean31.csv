puzzles,ffbd3ja,t1_ffao1nt,1579760275.0,"I haven't watched the video nor do I know anything about this puzzle but I'm guessing the slot which doesn't have any tire at any given time can be considered a zero state. and the other full ones as on states. so each operation of moving or removing the tire around could be counted as a number and the resulting state of the entire puzzle would give you the binary form of the number which has been counted.

I hope you get it."

MGTOW,fddarza,t1_fdd1ogx,1578303002.0,This. So much this. We all know it's always about the money. Why don't these women just name their price and we'll give it to them in return for sexual favors. This is a very simple thing. But modern society has made it so convoluted that as men we gotta go through the whole pointless winding route of making the woman our significant other while she clearly loves to be a whore yet be accepted like a nun when the sun comes up. If there wasn't so much of this stigma about prostitution and ease of setting up business for these women we'd be a lot happier.

I would like to know how and why these rioters take up arms? what is fundamentally flawed in them to take such extreme steps? what is the pattern, the common denominator amongst all these people? I badly want to know because I'm sure I will have to face such hoards in due course of time. I would really appreciate any reading or online resource from which I can understand more about the people dynamics of riots and pogroms in India.
