dogs,fe2dmif,t3_enf9u0,1578837222.0,"I learned it's a horribly toxic community that accepts horrible foods with many proven risks over ""boutique, BEG"" foods that are maybe but not really linked to one health problem. And if you feed anything but the big 4 you are belittled, made fun of, and chased out of this close-minded group."
dogs,fdyoulh,t1_fcn6li6,1578782097.0,"Can you link me to one verified case of a dog improving on diet alone (no taurine/carnitine supplementation and no heart meds), and their echo results before and after that's not on a facebook page?"
dogs,fdyhn6q,t1_fck6ev8,1578779901.0,"grain-free is considered healthier because it doesn't use artificial dyes, less synthetic nutrients, less controversial ingredients, less risk of pentobarbital, more meat, less carbohydrates. Which are all great things."
dogs,fdyduo2,t1_fcmur71,1578778670.0,"I'll tell you why from someone who feeds TOTW - grains are implicated in proven, real risks, whereas legumes are only theorized (and no one can say what could possibly be causing the problem or if there is a problem)."
dogs,fds5poi,t3_emnqy7,1578694943.0,"Hazel - the Pill, Worm, Rodent, Wild Hazel (breed name)

Shyla - Shy-dog, Shyla-Belle, mini-wolf or little white wolf

Lexi - Gremlin or Chicken Wing"
dogs,fdr8l50,t1_fdqxeg8,1578681029.0,oh ok
dogs,fdq94do,t1_fcuj1px,1578659848.0,until you ask how much meat is in their products! Then they dodge the question or straight up not reply! LOL grain-free has more meat anyways
dogs,fdq8h0i,t1_fcuko1o,1578659183.0,What breed did you have?
dogs,fdq7eof,t1_fdf4wgi,1578658032.0,"Grain free is still the best. More meat, less anti-nutrients, less controversial ingredients"
dogs,fdq6uno,t1_fdf7bo5,1578657395.0,"haha you're hilarious. Do more research. Also with 2 goldendoodles if they get DCM it will be genetic, both breeds are prone"
ntbdbiwdfta,fda5t5t,t1_fd5jyhy,1578242096.0,Awww thanks lol
ntbdbiwdfta,fd5jwex,t1_f971q9o,1578178360.0,Can't swim either! :(
dogs,fczdvof,t1_f5wqw2i,1578098991.0,Um Hill's is in some deep shit from the FDA and the 30 some lawsuits against them while this sub can only make theories about DCM (that don't make sense btw)
dogs,fczb4i1,t1_f5wka5q,1578097354.0,"Yes, yes switch from a food that is suspected to cause DCM with some flimsy self reported data versus the one that just caused a recall in 78 countries that is PROVEN to kill dogs with their negligence and is now in trouble with the FDA? Yeah ok then!"
dogs,fcza4cb,t1_f5xqo45,1578096756.0,A company that takes responsibility over it's mistakes versus one that couldn't even be bothered to make sure the vitamin premixes they got from China got their certificate of authenticity? The company that was warned by the FDA to test additional products because people were complaining of dead dogs on lots that were never recalled? How could anyone trust Hill's at this point? Did you not see the latest FDA warning letter to them???
dogs,fcz8x2r,t1_f5xh0ym,1578096046.0,Purina has cases of DCM.
dogs,fcz7pim,t3_dpmoil,1578095352.0,"I'd look at the recall, and the FDA alerts about Hill's - they have serious quality control issues and pet owners are still reporting problems with the food."
dogs,fcz67wx,t1_f5x8ipd,1578094495.0,Protein isn't the problem...you're using outdated science

conlang,fc1j4o0,t3_e5vok7,1577320302.0,I like the sounds of it
dogs,fbxms6v,t3_eeqxlk,1577194214.0,"Cavis shouldn't be bred at all in my opinion. Outcrossing is still perpetuating dogs with these genes. And other breeds are in almost as much trouble - dobermans, norwegian lundehunds (though I think they crossed them with norwegian buhunds to fix their issues), irish water spaniels, bulldogs, pekes (show lines), frenchies, pugs etc. People think deformities are cute unfortunately. And caveliers have cute faces so that trumps skull space and hearts that function."
