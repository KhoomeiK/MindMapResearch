aww,fd65bb1,t1_fd5yxuj,1578185733.0,"So your source is, I owned some rabbits. Got a link to something more impartial? Any thoughts on the link I posted saying it's unhappy?

Or this one saying it's ""a defensive measure meaning that you are to back off"":
 http://www.rabbithaven.org/boxing-grunting/

Or this one saying it's telling you to keep away:
https://www.omlet.us/guide/rabbits/rabbit_health/behaviour/

""Boxing:
   Rabbit stands on hind legs with their dukes up and throws punches.
Translation: ""One step further and I'll punch your lights out.""
http://www.rabbitwise.org/behavior.html

Or this one that lists boxing as ""aggressive behavior"":
https://rabbit.org/journal/4-4/tough-bonding.html

Haven't found one yet describing it as playful, but if you have one I'm glad to read it."
aww,fd612y8,t1_fd5p6bj,1578184053.0,"Agreed, doesn't look worried, but it sure looks like the illustration of 'angry or very unhappy rabbit' according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Meaning 'These rabbits are not happy and want you to stay away or go away.'

'Rabbit is sitting up on back legs with front paws raised in boxing behavior. Ears pointing upwards and facing outwards, rabbit may be growling.'

Also certainly doesn't look like the illustration of a happy rabbit

aww,fd5ok3d,t1_fd5n4i7,1578179709.0,"First time I've seen it, but to me that standing up clawing motion is what mine always did to try and kill me. They loved my wife and would hop around her, cuddle, and do binkies. For me, just the attempted murder no matter how many treats I tried to give them.

They are super neat animals, but after my experiance I wouldn't generally recommend them as pets just because they were so complicated. People assume they are basically big hamsters when they are closer to something like a parrot in social needs.

Edit: also, wanted to mention, I'm certainly no expert. Just a guy that's spent a decent amount of time with rabbits. Take that for whatever it's worth."
