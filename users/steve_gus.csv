If they are driven, when you are turning a corner one wheel will turn at a different rate to the other. If they are locked together by the engine drive then the slower wheel will be dragged along and the speed of the faster  wheel and will scrub and skid and the handling will be shit.

WinStupidPrizes,feeow2y,t1_feei8e7,1579038139.0,"Resistance in effect. Amps and volts are the POTENTIAL ENERGY. Just because you have 800 amps at 1000v doesnt make it worse that 1amp at 1000v.

If your body has a resistance if say 50,000 ohms, ohms law at 1000v says 0.02 amps will flow through you. Thats nothing like 800 or even 1 amp.

Lets say you are in water or sweating and your resistance is 5000 ohms then at 1000v you have 0.2 amps through you. Still nothing like that 800 amps but you only need around 0.05 amps across the heart to do it.

To get that full 800 amps you would need to have a body resistance of 1.25 ohms - not 50,000 ohms.

So power lines have a lot of volts and amps but only a fraction of the amps will flow through you to kill you.

Dont obsess about total amps available"
