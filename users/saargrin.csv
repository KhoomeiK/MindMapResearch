IDF,ff5vygn,t3_errsx7,1579612089.0,"1. theoretically yes,in practice your unit might be called up to be a quick-response force for stuff like protests or military jails   
2. basic is 4 months,AIT 4 month, and unit basic (for SOF or specialists ) could be up to 1 more year  (we're talking infantry here, armor ,field intelligence and artillery have different schedules)   
3. Jerusalem is Magav country (Gendarmerie). when there are major disturbances or something.infantry units might get deployed for a while,but thats rare  
4.  typically you dont lug your gear home. i'm not certain,but you're not supposed to take more than 1/2 mags off the base anyway  
5. your unit (battalion typically) issues you firearms, according to your service needs,so might switch at any time.  typically after you finish basic and AIT and join a line company,you'll keep the rifle you're issued for a long while. lots of people accessorize their weapons with chinese shit all the time while most units look the other way"
