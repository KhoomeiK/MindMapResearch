AskReddit,ff7xpd4,t1_ff7uq95,1579660835.0,"Honestly, all I can think is how lucky we were that none of them were in the nicu long term. Like, it was scary, I was in preterm labor with all of them (27 weeks, 20 weeks, and 17 weeks, respectively) but I honestly see it as we got through it all with minimal problems. My son was technically a preemie (born at 36+6, 7lb14oz juggernaut) so they had more protocols for him. What was a so scary was he couldn‚Äôt latch properly so he went from 7-14 to 6-3 in four days. Super scary weight loss. I was producing TONS of milk so I had to pump and feed. Thankfully when they saw he was eating 80ml every two hours, they let him come home."

AskReddit,ff7tv0i,t1_ff7i8bw,1579658230.0,"My first had bad jaundice that, in hindsight, they should have kept her for according to the doctor. Our second nearly died during labor but they turned me into a weird position and shot me up with epinephrine so she chilled out. They literally had the doctor outside the door to go for an emergency c-section. We learned quickly that her highness will not do something if she doesn‚Äôt fucking want to. The their I had a detachment from for the pregnancy. The last ultrasound I had he wasn‚Äôt moving and his cord was around his neck. I was already contracting so the doctor was like ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you head over to the hospital and have them check you and baby out‚Äù. We were wheeled through the L&D doors like a bat outta hell and all I remember hearing was ‚ÄúTHIS IS OUR DIRECT ADMIT!‚Äù He was born 4 hours later. He came out blue, cord around the neck a couple times, and didn‚Äôt breath for about 30 seconds. They brought him to me to hold for a minute before taking him to the nicu and I was like ‚Äúcool, stay alive my man‚Äù and ordered dinner. They brought me to the nicu to see him on the way to my recovery room and I remember finally realizing that I DID have a baby and this was HIM. I broke down and took a bit to recover. They finally brought him to my room a few hours later. The nurse walked in, was checking bracelets and paperwork and said ‚Äúoh, they didn‚Äôt send the right paperwork up‚Äù and walked off with my baby. I was bed bound and couldn‚Äôt form words, my husband was livid and ran after her. She got it sorted fast and then I told them I would not be using that nurse again. Fun story: he stayed for 5 nights. The first night in the nursery/extra care (The Nest) she was on duty. I was as calm as I could be. She did her thing. Fell asleep feeding a baby (okay...) and while taking my son‚Äôs blood for the bili test, two of the other babies in the unit were starting to choke so she ran over to them WITH MY SON‚ÄôS BLOOD VIAL to turn them. I get needing to get over there, but not with bloody gloves and an uncapped vial. I offered to turn them but she said no. Got blood on their blankets and my son was still bleeding everywhere because she didn‚Äôt put any gauze or pressure and it was finally a decent draw. I. Was. Livid."
