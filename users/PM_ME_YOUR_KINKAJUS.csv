Sexual health is incredibly important, but that’s why you get tested and use condoms. You’re going to be asking people to disclose their medical history to you. Is that what dating is to you? Don’t be an idiot and practice safe sex and you won’t have a problem. 

If you think people lie now, just wait until you’ve backed them into a corner. Then you’ll see."

I’m glad you think the issue of dating is more important than protecting people’s federal rights. There is no way a dating app can force people to disclose health information against their will. They have to provide it voluntarily."

Not everyone is going to be truthful. That’s just a fact of life. It happens literally everyday, and not just in dating. 

You couldn’t imagine how tinder getting rights to make the adjustments could be a federal offense? Were you born this entitled or did you fall into it? Are you intentionally not reading how HIPPA works? Do you know what HIPPA is?

AmItheAsshole,fem2xl9,t3_epvtwl,1579237997.0,"YTA. he knows, and he’s allowed to live a little. He’s also human.  I come from a background of auto immune, and if a family me ever told me how to deal with my issues, I would tell them to fuck right the fuck off. It’s incredible hard to control. I was rear ended by a guy who went into diabetic shock who did everything right. It just happened. He couldn’t control if. 

Now, having said that, maybe try approaching it from the manner of “how can I help you?” Tell him you want to hang out with him and ask how you can facilitate that, you know that diabetes is hard to manage so you want to help him. That’s way more approachable and way less asshole then telling someone with a very hard to manage, incurable disease they need to do a better job, when you literally do not understand the amount of effort it takes or the toll on your body."
