pittsburgh,fejpgop,t3_epj41m,1579182459.0,"Honestly the best thing to do would be to use Transit or Maps as a starting point and then do some additional research of bus lines. Oftentimes the apps won't recommend a convenient route (they always tell me to take 2 buses to work to prevent walking, when I could walk 10 min and just take one bus instead). PATrack is helpful as you can turn bus lines ""on"" and see exactly where they go and build your route that way. It'll also show all nearby bus lines. Good luck! It takes a little effort but once you start it'll get pretty easy."

pittsburgh,fejb4wd,t1_feiwmyd,1579165103.0,"The second you cross Baum toward Bloomfield, the bike lane disappears and the lane as a whole narrows quite a bit. Not to mention the parked cars that appear, and how fast some people drive through there. Using the bike lane puts you on the edge which is a dangerous place to be. If you take and control the lane, it's generally safe enough. But that lane teaches people to edge ride, which is terribly dangerous."
pittsburgh,fegdydv,t1_feeti8a,1579089350.0,"One of the worst is on S Millvale between Baum and Center. It's like 300ft long and then dumps you at a light, so if you don't move into the travel lane you're gonna have a bad time as soon as you start to cross Baum"

You're focusing in on one relatively pointless part of my initial comment and acting pretty intensely toward me because of it. The comment was about the staff, and somehow me being incorrect about how many bars there are has seemingly upset you enough to leave angry comments in response. Again, it HARDLY feels like something worth taking issue with. What effect does it have on you if I'm wrong about the number of bars in proximity to IBC? I don't intend on responding, I just hope that you reconsider the way you respond to people."

mildlyinteresting,fdq4z4k,t1_fdq31ki,1578655076.0,"Lol, I haven't been a cashier for some time now but I feel this in my bones. I used to work at a grocery store as a teen, and people would always store cases of water or pop on the bottom of their cart. Every once in awhile, I'd get the rare combo of a person who's really nice and also forgot to tell me about the pop or water so I would conveniently also forget to ring it up. If they were on their phone / rude / annoying, you better believe I'd say ""oh, you have water, too? I don't have a code for that, can you pick it up so I can scan it?"""

Hi all! I watched a video years back of Pete Whittaker doing a hard ascent of some (I believe) gritstone route that he rehearses on TR first and during his lead attempt he quietly and scaredly mumbles ""top rope, top rope, top rope"" to calm himself down. Hopefully this is enough direction for you all. I was just telling a friend about the video and would love to track it down again."

Nearly crying, can't breathe, running around like mad, etc. She was calm as a cucumber the whole time and helped me to talk to an emergency vet and get our dog to puke up all the badness. Luckily she had just eaten it before we got home and had no noticeable side effects!
