facepalm,ffdsayd,t3_esxmjb,1579827680.0,"social media has allowed the general population to be to active in politics. I hate to say it, but not everyone should have free access to information. Both sides need some wires clipped. Social media has made people fucking crazy. I miss 4 years ago before they changed the laws to allow domestic propaganda. The internet has gone to shit. Everyone is nuts now, but if you go outside and talk to people everybody is normal as always. The disconnect from words spoken in real life and those typed on social platforms is nuts. This shit is making people be stupid, or maybe people are just stupid when they are alone and think they can get away with it?"

No not at all is your answer, but your question also leads me believe that they would want to know how in the fuck a corporation is a person. With Andrew Jackson kicking out the ‚Äúworld bankers‚Äù and several other populist presidents being trust busters. You‚Äôve got me thinking that this could very quickly devolve into fisty cuffs,
Hand guns and whiskey really quick. 

Kudos for the insight. What do you think would happen?
