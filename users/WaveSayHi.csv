1m for every 100ish dragons, which you can kill in like 5 hits.

GetMotivated,fenz4p9,t1_fenyu2u,1579292951.0,"I'm no professional but why would people look down on themselves, and treat people who are like them like shit? If I'm a fat person, why would I be a pos to other fat people? 

Not saying it doesn't happen at all but I really don't think a statistical majority can be institutionally oppressed by themselves."
GetMotivated,fenxcot,t1_fenutpq,1579292173.0,"I agree with you but it's also the fact that 

1. Our culture heavily surrounds us with food as a facet of socialization
2. Shit food is cheaper and easier to consume, and most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck 
3. People can have health problems that cause them to be overweight 

All reasons why I dont call them names, like you just did, because I'm not a dick. I just dont really get how its nationally this post is claiming it's some horrible taboo and people always treat you like shit for it. That doesn't make sense when most of the country is fat."
