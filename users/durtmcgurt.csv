There was a dog that chilled on a pad right in front of hole 1 tee off, and would bark at you right as you threw your shot, but didn't chase the discs.

It had been a great day of golf, Ray and his father were driving around in a golf cart lighting Tiki Torches for the upcoming night glow round, and stopped to talk to us and watched me tee off on the very last hole. I chose to throw my new Disc Mania Enigma that I had just bought in the pro shop, and proceeded to throw a beautiful forehand shot right next to the basket. Ray said to me as soon as i threw it ""Hey, that's a great shot!"" and I'll always remember and be proud of that moment. He and his Dad were very friendly and welcoming, and i can't wait to go back and see them again this year. They have had camping events in the past, but it looks like that may be a fixture in the future."
