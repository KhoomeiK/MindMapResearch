But IMO that doesn't change the things that should be considered right and wrong (cherry picking), just the outcome. I don't understand what validation people have for only accepting certain parts of the old testament.

Overall, though, the old testament had some advice that was good for that time period. For instance, many things were considered unclean, but they didn't know about germs yet and had no antibacterial soap. Those things that were set aside for being unclean unwittingly avoided the spread of disease. Homosexuality falls under this umbrella too. Sex between two men is more likely to spread sexually transmitted diseases, but they didn't know about STDs yet and had no form of protection. Now we have education, protection, and treatment. Circumcision is another good example. They did not know about germs, or have antibacterial soap or antibiotics. Circumcision reduced the chances of a UTI and back then an infection was a much bigger deal.

I guess my point is that we could all benefit from recognizing that the time period of the Bible is unrecognizable to modern society. A lot of things carried a very different significance.
Now that we live in a new and more educated world, we should consider the reasons rules were created when we decide on morality. Then maybe we could focus more on things that are still strongly relevant like hatred, hypocrisy, and judgement. Maybe we could learn to care more about forgiveness than damnation."
