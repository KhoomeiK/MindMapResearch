I understand the concept behind probiotics, but there are at least 2 major flaws with the implementation of them in little magic capsules or liquids.
1- Everyone has a different mix of the thousands of different varieties of bacteria in the flora.  There is little understanding of the mix and introducing a random mix could do more harm than good.
2- Most of the bacteria don't make it past the stomach to the gut where it's needed.  You know, the stomach acid.  That's why people get fecal transplants for c.diff infections.  It has to get to the gut without getting destroyed by stomach acid.
3- Placebo is a wonderful thing.  Just because some people say they feel a difference, it could be placebo.  And placebo is so strong, it can force physical results.

I still believe that there are people out there who are looking for thoughtful, reasoned debate on topics."

And it's not just the Pittsburgh shooting.  There was also a synagogue shooting in San Diego, and there was a shooting in Jersey City 4 weeks ago targeting Jews.  And there has been at least 25 assaults in NYC in the past 6 weeks, like actual people walking up to Jews out of nowhere and punching them or beating them.  Last week 25,000 people gathered in response to this wave of attacks.

Here is Bill Clinton chilling with Farrakhan just recently at Aretha Franklin's funeral.  This is pretty much the same as Trump hanging out with David Duke.  It's awful and it no way minimizes right wing anti-Semitism, which is obviously a huge danger.

longisland,fc4p8sh,t1_fc47vor,1577423563.0,"Ok.  Let's put this another way.  You have your home.  It's not the home of your dreams.  Let's do some quick math.  Renovations are about $200 per sqft.  You want to add on 500 sqft, do some kitchen work, and fix up the basement.  That will cost you maybe $100k - $150k.  Let's say it's $100k.  

If you took a 15 year home equity loan for 15 years at a rate of 6.7%, which I just looked up online as a good rate, that would cost $887/month.  There are some tax savings, so let's call it $750/month.

So the question to ask yourself is this: are these renovations going to give you a level of satisfaction that makes sense to spend $750 every month from today until the year 2035?  I can't answer that for you, only you can."
longisland,fc46znd,t3_eg3mnc,1577408312.0,"First off, you must understand that almost every buyer in every price range, has similar remorse.  It's completely normal and expected.

My best advice would be to really think about how important these renovations are, especially with all of the upcoming expenses of having kids, etc.  You have 3 bedrooms and a roof, which is really the American Dream.  It's very easy to get caught up in comparing yourself to others and finding flaws in your current situation, but you will find that happiness is driven by so many things other than house size and conditions.  And remember, between broker fees and closing costs, moving to a new house could easily cost $50k in just those expenses.

I live in an expensive area with a house that ""needs work"".  Believe me, the schools, parks, police presence, shopping, etc make it well worth sticking around and one day, maybe, we'll do some work, but it's just such a low priority.  

Stay a while and then check your budget, etc in a few years.  Time is on your side."
