ThatsInsane,fde7z8p,t1_fde3qq3,1578333170.0,This. This! It's not the seeds! It's the pith!!! So many dishes ruined because of this simple--and oft-repeated misconception regarding peppers.
ThatsInsane,fde7tgs,t1_fddlzpf,1578333069.0,"Perhaps even more to the point, the seeds of a chile do NOT contain the capsaicin, it's actually concentrated in the pithy white veins running vertically through a chile and surrounding the seeds. If you'd like to run a quick test, do the following. Obtain two hot chili's (the spiciness of the variety you choose should be guided by how much you trust a random internet stranger) and do the following (while wearing rubber gloves): slice the pepper open, remove the seeds from both and, on one, use a spoon to scrape the living hell out of the inside of the pepper to remove all of the white pith. Leave the other unaltered (aside from the removal of the seeds). Now chow down. You will find that the pepper with all the pith removed is significantly less spicy than the unaltered pepper. 

This is a fun trick for using really spicy but also really tasty peppers (such as Habaneros) in dishes where you want the flavor but not as much spice.

They do a fairly terrible job of sequestering organic materials, most of which will eventually turn into methane or other volatile gasses and leak into the atmosphere. In fact, given how terrible Asian counties do at handling the deluge of ""recyclable"" plastic they get from the west, you're probably better off putting plastic into a landfill."
