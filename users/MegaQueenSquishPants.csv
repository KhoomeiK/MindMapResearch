It almost feels impossible when they are that young, but imagine the people who do work out of the home. Those pups are alone for 2-4 hours at a time and do just fine. Yours is super lucky because you're always there, and they need to learn to deal with the fact that you can't pay attention to them 100%. Just set breaks as though you were hiring a dog walker, whatever that schedule looks like for your pup. Every 2-3 hours we'd get him up, take him out to potty and then play/exercise him for a little while, maybe give him a chew and then send him back to his crate/playpen. 

We had to move our pups crate away from our office area because he's keep seeing us and freaking out. Sometimes I hid on an entirely separate floor keeping super quiet just to get him to chill out for a bit. He eventually got used to it and now he's a real good boy :)"

Ours had a meltdown at the metal polar bear lawn decorations covered in christmas lights.

\- ""Strange"" people entering our house. 

\- People/dogs walking past the house. 

\- old men. We have no idea why he decided he was terrified of old men, especially those with the old man bellies, but he haaaaated them for a while and is still more skittish with them than other people. no fucking clue why, they only ever wanted to pet him gently, just like all other people

\- doorbell, door knocking, door opening. I wish I had done that so much earlier. 

Successes:

\- costumes (pup was 12 weeks old at halloween, accidental success!), hats, wearing clothes, 

\- fireworks and loud noises. We had hardwood floors installed in our new house when he was \~10 weeks old. he never has issues with loud smashes or bangs and it's fantastic 

\- Strollers, wheelchairs, umbrellas, bikes 

\- kids. he loves kids soooo much. this might have been an accident/luck because we don't have any and he didn't have much early exposure to kids."
puppy101,ff6hg46,t3_erwo08,1579627280.0,"My pup is now 18 months, but I've worked from home for his entire life. We kept him penned or crated for most of the workday (minus a few potty/play breaks) for a long time. I don't think we could trust him to not cause trouble until he was at least 5-6 months old, and even then it was only in the morning and only in the living room + office. The rest of the house was off limits and by the time afternoon hit he couldn't contain himself anymore so we'd take him for a walk and put him down for another nap. We couldn't reliably keep him free in in the house while working until he was probably 7-8 months, with an occasional forced-nap in his crate when he got a little too demanding."

puppy101,feny1a3,t3_eq54rj,1579292541.0,"It just takes time. Keep walking away, be patient and wait it out. Yelling will not work. Yelping only works for the most sensitive dogs. Redirect it to toys and other stuff. Show them that biting toys means playtime continues, and biting you means playtime stops. But they are babies and it takes him for them to connect the dots because they're just so excited and cute. They're just babies who are learning the world with their mouths and playing like they play with other dogs. They just need to learn that playing with you like a dog means playtime stops. Walk away and be boring. Stop playing for 1 minute. After 3 times, just stop playing with them. Make it be nap time. 

It goes away after teething and comes back a bit during adolescence. Just do the same thing: stop being fun, stop being present. 

It pays off, I promise! At 18 months, my puppy grabs a toy when he wants to wrestle me like he does other dogs, and bites the toy like he bits a dogs face while wrestling my arm (he's small so he can do that safely lol). He knows that teeth on mom means playtime is over and when he gets really happy excited, he scatters around looking for a toy to put in his mouth instead of my hand."

Our 6 year old stray foster baby from a hot climate who was shoved on a plane to a cold climate in winter, who had never been on hardwood floors before and had only been here a week, and had a 1 year old puppy harassing the shit out of him constantly to play. He didn't like to sit, he was too scared because he slipped on the floor. He laid down and he stood. 

We were working on ""sit"", but slowly. The trainer who came to our house for our resident dog tried to lure and push his butt into a sit and he refused. So she said capture it when he sat on his own and it'd eventually click, which is what we were doing and it was slowly working. We also used our dog to show him what sit meant and used turkey to really proof it.

Even after telling this ""pro"" all this, she still insisted that if he didn't sit on command he didn't get any food. At all. She also told us to violently bang on his crate while looking him in the eye to make him stop barking in his crate.

Guess which rescue we will never foster for again..."

Well. I was told by my housemates girlfriend that if I didn't let her dog come visit my dog at our house during the first few weeks, our puppy would never be friends with their dog because (by the age of 14 weeks) he'd become too territorial to let another dog into his domain. WHAT? I know socialization is important, but it's not that extreme for most dogs. I was expressing parvo concerns and that I wanted to talk to my vet first. They're at the dog park \*all the time\*, parvo is in our area and I didn't know what the line for risks was yet.

They insisted that they absolutely had to bring their dog over despite my concerns (and me saying I'd talk to the vet about it), otherwise their relationship was obviously going to fail because it was going to limit her ability to see her partner (again, what??). I'd rather my dog be territorial and angry with dogs in our house than dead from parvo (which I later learned wasn't a huge risk but I NEEDED TO ASK A PROFESSIONAL FIRST WHICH SEEMS SUPER REASONABLE TO ME).

Jokes on her though. That relationship ended about a week after puppy came home because she did that shit with everything in their relationship, and doing it to me with the puppy thing really highlighted how bad it was getting.

His sister has barely ever made a peep and he's just bark bark bark bark bark bark, and they are new, over-obsessed dog parents like we are.

puppy101,fekxom5,t3_epo3ac,1579209749.0,"It might just be the age. From 6-12 months we saw a huge burst in energy and zoomies and our dog being an overall nonstop speed machine. He started to initially chill out around 11 months, and more again around 18 months. We're finally at the point at  not NEEDING daycare to get out every zoomie so he'll sleep at night. His ants-in-his-pants stage led to all sorts of other behaviors, like barking and chewing again because unless we were paying attention to him, he was always bored. It was a mix of training him to relax, and waiting for the worst of the energy spikes to subside. 

Keep practicing and have patience. Practice go-to-bed, stay, leave it and other impulse control games at home and slowly bring that practice out of the house. Definitely keep practicing ""no pets without sits!"". Maybe have some friends help out as well, this way they can know to wait out the tantrum and it'll finally click.

We took him to the petco playtimes, classes, playdates. But nope, he was terrified of all other puppies.

Then we took him to daycare and he got some confidence. Then we took him to his third series of classes, which we thought we could do a fun tricks and games class, and our dog was an absolute fucking nightmare who looked like he'd never in his life taken an obedience class. I cried during the first class because for the first time he just refused to stop barking, pulling, tugging and acting like a maniac. I was so embarrassed.

Around that age, my little jackass of a dog would look at me when I tried to call him, stare at me for a second, then just walk away from me. The barking started, and so did a whole new round of destroying things he used to know better about. You will (eventually) survive this phase. 

Mine forgot how to roll over for about 4 months. He just would NOT do it. At all. Not with luring, not with commands. He used to do it all the time, then just nope. Then he started doing it again a few months ago and I don't know what in his silly little brain changed but now it's like he never forgot...

Just keep training, as though you never taught him that thing he currently refuses to do. Up the tastiness of the treats or change up what you're using for high-value rewards, but only use it for the hardest tasks for him. The more he gets it the less value it has. 

Be patient, laugh and try to not kick the dog out of the house/charge him rent when he tells you he hates you (in his own puppy teenager sorta way by eating the remote and being sassy :P). Realize he may have a few potty accidents, despite probably being potty trained for a bit now."

He loved barking at the little waves, running in the sand and sniffing everything. His recall was soooo good at the time. He loved us, he loved running to us for treats and he aside from sometimes chasing down another puppy he was pretty good. 

Then it closed for the spring/summer. We tried going back when it re-opened but whooaaaaa nope. We couldn't get him to take a treat from us if we were 2 feet from him (and we weren't trying to leash him, just get his attention). He kept running away from us and running outside the bounds of the park.

I have a small dog, and we \*tried\* to not let him get little-dog-syndrome (i.e. letting him get away with stuff because he's small) but the jumpy door greetings and face kisses are SO CUTE AND HE LOVES ME SO MUCH so that one I always kinda let slide because I love that he loves me so much. He's only 20lbs, so he can't really hurt most people, and doesn't really care for strangers so I don't have to worry about him hurting other people.

But at daycare, I always felt a little bad because he looked so uncontrollable, until I stood in line one day and watched like 5 dogs all act like my dog, including the big labs, goldens, pitties and such. Some of them knew not to jump ON their people, but they sure did do leaps and bounds AROUND their humans and it was hilariously adorbs and I felt way less bad."

puppy101,fdhnz1x,t3_elccvf,1578426670.0,"Our daycare tries to make all the dogs sit at the gate before they exit at the end of the day. Watching excited dogs who are just leaving their happy places to go to their happy people try to sit for long enough for that gate to open is absolutely adorable. Big dogs and small dogs alike are all wild wiggly maniacs. They sit, but they are still wiggling with excitement the whole time, and then all get beyond excited when they see their people. I love standing in the pickup line at the end of the day hahaha. The parade of happy dogs and happy people is infectious. It also makes me feel better that my little dog is so crazy when he sees me after daycare. They are all that bonkers and it's so cute."

Dogtraining,fdf291j,t3_eku965,1578351652.0,"I fostered a whippet mix that was skin and bones. He needed a sweater to handle 40 degree walks and our kinda chilly house. Poor baby was on the ground shivering, he had no meat on his bones to keep himself warm and technically shouldn't because he's always going to be a slender dog. 

My resident dog does not need sweaters but ooohhh does he look adorable in them!! And halloween costumes? Sweaters that look like christmas trees and light up? RAIN COATS?! YES PLEASE. I love doggie clothes, I think of the adorable ""humiliation"" (human projection of humiliation, which works just fine for me as long as it's not torturing them for real) as payment for all the shit they chew holes in, the nights they keep us awake because they're bored teenagers and they money we spend spoiling them :P. 

He does need a rain coat, though. He's a poodle mix with hair that loves to mat in the rain so that's useful and also adorable."
Dogtraining,fdevjbq,t1_fde1bj5,1578347482.0,"None of the non-chain daycares in my area have live cameras, and 3 of them are the top recommended. I \*wish\* there were cameras because I wanna watch my puppy play all day, but I know why smaller daycares don't do it. It's hard to get on top of what looks bad but actually isn't; ignorant parents could totally blow your reputation on normal dogs playing saying it's a fight they ignored. 

Also, it's a technically savvy thing to do for the majority of the population and half these places websites look like geocities sites from 1995, if they even have a freakin website!  Tthese places have been open for ages, long before live-streaming was common and have good enough reputations to not need it. They have their clients + word-of-mouth reputation to sustain their businesses."
puppy101,fde9mts,t1_fdbfgo6,1578334219.0,"This worked for us, too. He was fine for a while after we did some training and around adolescence he started to get weird about it again so we started the same training and now he's an angel about it."

My SO and I work from home, so it was suuuuper easy to just always be around, so we just made sure we took trips to the movies or the store or anything where we had to crate and leave him. He's still super attached but he's 100% cool with us leaving because we made an intentional effort to leave him alone in the house."
puppy101,fcybsuc,t3_ejiv3e,1578077794.0,"TOTALLY NORMAL AND TOTALLY INFURIATING! But it will pass. I cried a lot during adolescence.

Ooooh do I not miss those little ""pay attention to meeeeeeee!"" bites. We still have 1 room gated off, because it turned into his bad-boy room. The only room he went into when we weren't looking and he'd destroy whatever he could find. Our remote is still really sad looking but it still works so we haven't replaced it, and he totally left a few new holes in the drywall at that age when we were cruelly neglecting him :P. His recall was garbage and he started barking at EVERY SINGLE THING HE SAW OR DIDNT SEE!!

How to survive? Deli turkey. Hot dogs. Whatever is the MOST HIGHLY VALUED TREAT that he has never gotten before and only use it for 1 or 2 very special things like leash training and maybe recall. The more you use it, the less special it becomes, and you cannot give it to him if he doesn't do what you ask. You gotta up your game. 

Maybe find him a doggie friend he can run his crazies off with; daycare saved our asses around this time. It was 2 days a week he wasn't our problem. I once sent his daycare a video of him being totally bonkers in the house before I dropped him off saying ""this is about to be your problem"" LOL. Luckily they love him in all his crazy states and appreciated it.

Start enforcing nap time again to give yourself a break, even if he barks his head off. Leave the house without him. Make a friend take care of him; they are usually better behaved with anyone-not-mom. 

Ours went on a food-fast for like 3 days around this time, taking as few nibbles as necessary to sustain himself. No good reason for it, the asshole just stopped eating. He wasn't sick, he was trying to be picky (he has a history of it but never 3 days bad). I was in a panic and it turned out fine.  

Add in some wine, chocolate, whiskey, weed or whatever your vice is. Part of this age is just riding it out with tears and booze. Good luck. She will grow out of it!"
puppy101,fcy8z5p,t1_fcw6n5s,1578076533.0,"9 weeks isn't even the start of teething. Wait until 12-16 weeks when teeth start really falling out, and then everything will get even worse again hahaha! He's still a baby and learning. Anything good that happened the first week is a fluke, keeping working on bite inhibition by removing yourself from the puppy after 3 bites for 30-60 seconds to start, and redirecting to other toys. You're in this one for the long haul and it's going to take a while. 

Then it'll get better around 5 months old, and get worse again around 8 months old when they are suddenly teenager dirtbags who lose all self control."
SeattleWA,fcxwk6s,t1_fcwi6us,1578071497.0,"In a state that requires inspections, a crook garage tried to tell me by back brakes were on backwards and he was going to charge me $400 to turn them around. Not replace them, turn them around. I hadn't even spent that much to get new brakes! Being a 21 year old woman, scared and timid, I probably looked like an easy target, but I'm also not dumb. I got my dad to call them back to scream at them, which was suuuuper satisfying."
dogs,fcved8x,t1_fcvd46y,1578000339.0,"What might also be true is that sometimes these volunteers are better equipped to work with dogs than humans. We were fostering through an org and we were struggling with our dog. I was in tears one night emailing my case manager begging for help and I didn't get a response for > 3 days. I emailed her again begging her to send help even if she couldn't be that person, and I got a response that was ""I don't check my email every day, stop bothering me and your problem isn't real."" Except it was real, and we were struggling so much we ended up asking the foster to be placed in another home because we had hit our limit. 

Some people are just assholes and I get the impression some rescues attract them more than others. A lot of the people at the org we tried to work with felt like they were short on patience and understanding. A lot of their fb/yelp reviews say they are similarly rude and poor with communication. I'm sure they see a lot, and that they are volunteers who are trying but they aren't all making a good case for the businesses they represent."

puppy101,fco5pvr,t1_fco34ex,1577824584.0,"You got this!! Don't worry, if you're consistent with your boundaries and start forcing naps again, it will get better. Eventually.

We have a mini doodle, too. He's almost 1.5 years now and he's so much better. I knew adolescence was a thing but in the thick of it you wonder if maybe this is just your dog now. 

I work from home so sometimes when he's tired he still barks at me to play with him instead of work, but it's \*nothing\* like those adolescent months. He was a raging butthole and evenings were so rough."
puppy101,fcnuy4l,t1_fcnncpy,1577818931.0,"Our pup turned into a raging asshole around these months. I'd echo what everyone else says; make everyone be consistent with the ""No"" and walking away, and keep at it. Change won't happen overnight and your pup is going through some real dumb-brain stages so it might take a minute to kick in what's happening.

Ours used to chomp our toes to get our attention when we were sitting or laying down. It's hard to not react, because it fucking hurt so we always had to pay attention when it happened. And all attention is good attention when you're an annoying teenage pup. He never drew blood, but it still hurt and oh did we not want that to keep going. 

It took a few months of us walking away, pen/crate time outs and trying to force a nap before he got that crazy for that horrible habit to go away. If we wanted to relax and watch TV at night we would crate him downstairs for an hour or so just so we could do it without becoming chew toys :P. He still does it once in a blue moon when he's really over-tired and being shitty, but it's like once every 2 months and not every night like it was for a while.."

woodworking,fb84elv,t1_fb82egc,1576605906.0,The dollar store pans fall apart and have to be replaced every few years once the nonstick wears off and they warp so much you can barely cook on them. They're fine if that's what you can afford but a nice cast iron will be passed down for generations. My friend got into a fight with her cousin over their grandmother's cast iron pan. We had it in the house for a little bit and it was beautifully seasoned and nonstick.
