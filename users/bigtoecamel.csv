First of all i'll have to explain to you that your view on that stuff is pretty damn deterministic (like marx, but you already knew that of course). 


Then you should know *why* historical determinism is worthy to be criticized. (Which you, of course, already knew). The answer is (oversimplified): noone really can predict the future. 
History also isnt physics in which you can  correctly predict an outcome simply based on the previeous results.

Marx  writings are almost about 150 years old. He lived in a complete different society. His works, for example, are older than the social democratic movement in germany,  which in parts seeks to employ some form of equality through reforms. (At least when they took effect)

To answer your question: germany, for example, introduced a social welfare system based on communist ideas without going communist. As a german: i'd say thats a win for the reform side.





Thats, like, the *very* basic start to work on criticism of marx. If someone would come to me in real life and tell me he's a marxist while not knowing those basics (or asking the questions you did or how you askes them, even the way you write is fucking pretentious) i'd think he didnt even read marx.

You claim 'political science classes only teach western bla bla' ? You *didnt read any political science works about marx* or else you'd fucking know. How would someone who doesnt really read actual political science know if they have valid criticism on marx? The answer is he cant. *You* cant.

insanepeoplefacebook,fctsmj9,t1_fctscgt,1577957384.0,'Being engaged' changes your legal status and has to get noted from an official site in my country.
insanepeoplefacebook,fctq7cm,t1_fctpsi6,1577953869.0,"In germany 'being engaged' is a legal status that grants you different rights (for example in court you can deny being asked about your fiance, not about your boyfriend).


So you have to actively get engaged, simply asking 'do you want to marry me' wouldnt count as being engaged."
insanepeoplefacebook,fctq390,t1_fctpvuh,1577953710.0,In my country engaged is a legal thing. You have to actively get engaged or you go from girlfriend directly to wive.

Yes i would have asked the question because its valid. I mean you can continue writing like a moron but the fact stands you A) either watched ovee 260 episodes of a show you didnt like or B) youre complaining about a show you didnt watch.


Youre truly a dumb human being my man"
