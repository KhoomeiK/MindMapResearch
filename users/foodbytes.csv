halifax,ff9l2r5,t1_ff9ivse,1579715263.0,"oh, excellent advice. I've not attempted stacking before although I've read all about it. I actually live in Ottawa (visit my bro in Halifax frequently) but there are a couple of bridges here that I'd love to try it with. I'll dm you with a couple questions, thanks!"
travel,ff9k7iz,t1_ferb635,1579714751.0,"years ago I did a hot springing holiday around there. We visited as many natural hot springs in AB and BC as we could in 10 days. But we always came back to Ram Creek. The White Swan hot springs, actually Lussier Hot Springs, is nice as long as people don't move the rocks around. Ram Creek hot sprngs is just off the forestry road between Premier Lake and White Swan Lake. OMG we'd stay in the springs until dawn and watch the fog lift and sun come up from the valleys all around and light up the mountains. Nothing better in the world."

Question, how steady is the bridge for taking photos? do you think a person could take a reasonably long exposure from the bridge with a tripod of course? like a few seconds? Is there a sweet spot where there's not so much movement?"

The law regarding photography (I'm a photographer) prohibits taking photos of people where there is an 'expectation of privacy'. the interior of a home is considered a place where there is an 'expectation of privacy', even if curtains are open.

AskPhotography,ff445v7,t1_ff42vjs,1579555141.0,"thank you! I do a lot of wildlife and travel photography, mostly to share with my friends and family on (shh) facebook. But some of those photos may also be printed and/or sold. So I'm always in a quandary. Although great for printing emailing 10mg files to friends is a bit tedious. So I often end up saving two size jpgs. I guess a better idea is to go back to the raw and photoshop files, only bothering to save them."

offmychest,fey13dj,t3_eqqad0,1579439405.0,"I think we all go through changes in our relationships or rather views of our parents. When we're little, we think the world revolves around them and that they are perfect. As we get into our teens we see that they have faults and just can't forgive them for that. After all, they are supposed to be perfect. When we are in our twenties, have some life experiences and a bit more wisdom, we realize that, yes, our parents aren't perfect, and that's perfectly fine. it's a process; you'll get there."
ottawa,fexz7ga,t3_eqszud,1579438651.0,the old CN CP rail-line? that's what originally went through the old train station downtown. that's why the Chateau Laurier is right there; it's owned (or it was originally) by the railroad company. It worked there 100 years ago but really you don't want all that rail and vehicle traffic right downtown. That's why it was moved to what was then the burbs.

Because I was at an event, we were able to get control of the lighting in the bar and lower them for a time. that helped. And, I have to admit although it is horribly difficult, this was taken on a ... a.. yes, a phone. The event was to introduce the new huiwei phone to photographers and see which they thought took better photos. I didn't have a tripod with me and the phone photos were, sigh, better than my dslr under those circumstances."
