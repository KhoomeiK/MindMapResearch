So what if it's temporary?  You're a teenager, you're old enough to make that sort of assertion.  If, in a year or so, you settle into a gender, that doesn't mean whatever you are at the moment is invalidated.  If you don't, that's fine too."

nonbinarysupportgroup,fenwsll,t3_eq3t2x,1579292054.0,"Gender is weird.  It can be one thing for years and then change completely, it can switch around seemingly at random, and it can be very hard to explain to people.  None of that makes anyone less valid in their identity.  Being comfortable being referred to as male doesn't mean you can't be non-binary, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise; just be yourself.

Honestly you sound a lot like me a few years ago, not really sure about anything but trying to figure out if it's ""just a phase"" or if it was something real.  The thing is, being temporary doesn't make it any less real.  Just be yourself.  Stop defining yourself as male and do what you want.  It's harder than it sounds - part of me still sometimes reacts as female.  If I can paraphrase from a certain bisexual goose comic:

""You're totally allowed to be [non-binary] and I think you'd be very good at it but there is no induction ritual or anything

If you're [non-binary] then you're [non-binary], well done""

As to people thinking you're faking, well, people always will.  We have less visibility than most.  A lot of people have never heard of us.  My advice is to just be; at least one of my friends initially didn't believe I was non-binary when I first introduced myself, but over time he saw that I was a multi-dimensional person who definitely wasn't doing it for attention, and now he's changed his mind.  My parents still struggle, but they've never tried to deliberately erase my identity.  

As the goose says:

""This is a lot like saying 'I think I actually like cats but I have a dog.' like.  You really don't need to make a binary here.  You can also like cats.  Maybe one day you'll get a cat, too.  Your dog can't stop you from liking cats.  You're not betraying your dog.

You're allowed."""

nonbinarysupportgroup,fejqyx1,t3_epf9qu,1579183646.0,"Don't wear it.  At all.  Cheap binders can really mess up your chest, causing lifelong health issues and making later surgery impossible - in the same way that using bandages can cause damage.  If you can, it's absolutely worth saving up for a gc2b binder, or underworks, or a reputable brand; if you can't, there are plenty of online resources talking about how dangerous low-quality, cheap binders can be - maybe evidence will convince your parents.

In the meantime, there are other ways to present more masculine.  The best resource I've found is this:

ftmguide.rassaku.net/guide/index.htm

But basically, wear dark tops to eliminate shadows, avoid patterns (they reveal unwanted curvature), and - above all - reduce hips, enhance shoulders."

I am somewhere on the demisexual/demiromantic spectrum, so it can take a while; unfortunately, none of the people I've reached that stage for were interested in me the same way.  However, I contest that it's the worst feeling ever.  My love is not limited to romantic or sexual attraction, nor does it demand reciprocation.  Their friendship, their trust, is worth more to me than any romantic entanglement.

Yes, there is a sadness to it, and there is a sadness to the fact that I will likely remain single for most of my life - but being single doesn't mean I'll be alone.  I have all these friends surrounding me, and I love them, and there's far more joy to be had than sadness."

It had one of the best depictions of character development I've ever seen; it was such a small detail, but the arrogant space marine - who began the book reluctant to relinquish his weapon, since his brothers would see his shame - willingly chose to shave his head in penitance at the end.

Also, strangely, Baneblade and Shadowsword.  I'm not a massive fan of tanks by any stretch of the imagination, and I usually graduate towards Astartes books, but these were so well written!  I loved the way they played with my expectations."
