todayilearned,fesfjx6,t1_fesclr8,1579364621.0,"In other comments, he assumes that's she's lacking important nutrients and then says that her incapability of dealing with the extreme circumstances are a result of that deficiency.

He points out that the irony is that she's trying to prove that vegan diets are healthy, while there is supposedly medical research that claims the opposite.

His calls to medical research are ridiculous as he skews the facts. 

He conflates a higher risk of lacking nutrients with actually having a nutrient deficiency; aka ""vegans have a higher risk of having nutrient deficiency therefore all vegans have a nutrient deficiency"". 
""Therefore this woman died because she was lacking nutrients, because she's vegan. That's why it's ironic, because she was trying to prove its healthy to be vegan"".

You immediately said me buying a 1500$ laptop is dumb, wittout knowing what I value in a laptop, or what I use it for. I'm a developer myself; I wanted a high resolution screen with a 3:2 aspect ratio, small form factor but with a relatively powerful CPU, a dedicated GPU for Photoshop and video rendering, good speakers, decent battery life, good build quality and last but not least nice aesthetics. I did not find what I was looking for at a 500-800$ price point. Believe me, if I did, I'd have taken it.


Resale value matters for people who like to sell used hardware to fund buying newer gear.

GooglePixel,fe94jpf,t1_fe93bhf,1578934188.0,"I never said resale value is the only factor. If you prefer MacOS, but you're held back by the price, the resale value can offset that. If you buy a Mac for schoolwork, you'll be able to keep and use it for years to come. If you buy a 400$ Chromebook... You get my point, I hope.

Also, what's wrong with buying a 1500$ windows laptop?

Furthermore, he didn't mention what kind of program he's in, AFAIK. You're just assuming that he's not doing anything that fully utilizes the Mac's potential.

Lastly, you destroyed your own argument. You have a MacBook air because you find it easier to do web development on MacOS. What if he has a use case that's easier on MacOS? By your own logic, this would be a valid reason for getting one."

Apple devices also don't devalue anywhere nearly as quickly as windows devices.

I bought a 1500$ windows laptop 2 years ago, and now I wouldn't be able to sell it for half of that. Give it another 2 years, and no one would want to buy it for more than a couple hundred bucks.

Performance: on par with other 2017 flagships

Fluidity, smoothness: nearly indistinguishable from 2019 flagships. No complaints there

Camera: it's an awesome camera, but it's only a single lens. No ultrawide, no zoom - but that doesn't mean the camera can't hold its own.

Display: average if not below average. Just doesn't look nice compared to 2019 flagships screens.

Battery: sufficient for a casual user. MAX 5 hours screen on time with a new battery. Usually around 4 hours though.

Speakers: nicer than even lots of 2019 flagships. Not groundbreaking, but won't let you down.
