Guessing the gravitational energy his body gained displaces water, and that same energy becomes the energy that shoots the ball up. So 100+ kg falling a couple of metres is transferred into a 500g ball?"

Never really felt they were proper friends, and when I started earning a lot more money than them, suddenly they were inviting me out. Took me a while to realise it was just because I was generous and always bought the first round. Penny dropped when one time they all switched from beers to double vodka Red bulls (2 X the price) when my round came around, I pointed out the discrepancy, and they were like, but you earn so much more, what does it matter to you. Left right there and then and never spoken to any of them ever again. All I got was a ""you're such a loser"" text on my way home, never heard from them again. Trust me, you don't need or want shitty friends like that. You can and will do so much better."
