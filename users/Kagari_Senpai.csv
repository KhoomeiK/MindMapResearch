depression,fek4cg1,t3_epikcs,1579192336.0,"When reading stories like this I'm so happy to live in a country with free health care. It ain't the best, especially when it comes to mental health( a lot of older doctors with a mind set ""young people have nothing to be depressed about""), but they can't do anything like this. I have seeked emergency help quite few times and they can't do anything like this. I just don't understand how can a country treat its people like this. I genuinely feel so sorry for you all, you all deserve better."
childfree,fdufdjr,t3_emzhv5,1578732288.0,"I can never understand how parents are like ""(S)he looks just like mom or dad!"" I look at the baby and all I can see is a potato. To me, babies look like potatoes."
childfree,fd9qg5s,t3_ek8gr1,1578236673.0,"I was at a christmas party and I wasn't feeling well. I had a sore throat, a headache and was feeling really weak. Plus I was feeling bit depressed. Because of that I didn't want to drink or go out for a cigarette. All night this one coworker kept asking me if I'm pregnant. So I told her I don't want kids. She was shocked for a moment and then kept telling me how I'll change my mind. I was so close to actually punching her in the throat."
childfree,fd1ukfr,t1_fcyrb4z,1578137042.0,I had an abortion for the same reason. It's been almost 2 years and I don't regret it. Best decision I have ever made.
childfree,fd1qul7,t3_ejgzhp,1578135367.0,"My mother is like that. We could sometimes barely afford food. My step father would go around and ask our family and neighbours for money so we could buy food and baby stuff. It was embarrassing. Me and my siblings were bullied at school because of it, even teachers were mocking us sometimes(small village where people knew each other and most were related to each other).  She could barely take care of us and of course she keeps having more kids. Guess who had to take care of all the kids? Of course the oldest sibling aka me. I basically had no childhood and when I started getting child support from my dad, I had to spend it on food and occasionally pay bills. Having to take care of my siblings really messed up my last year high school. I didn't have time to study or rest well enough. Of course she had more kids and we ended up losing our home because of unpaid bills. She just doesn't learn."
childfree,fcwz1jo,t1_fcwp3eh,1578043800.0,I had night shifts in a restaurant  I worked at and it was sad seeing tired and whiny kids there at 3am with all the drunk idiots. Some kids seemed to be less than a year old.
DysfunctionalFamily,fc5a2v9,t3_eg4qio,1577450586.0,"My front teeth are a lot more in front than they should be(sorry, I don't know how to describe it better, english isn't my first language). People have made fun of me because of it my whole life. My parents refused to get me braces because ""my teeth will get straight by themselves"". They did get my sister braces although her teeth weren't half as bad as mine. She actually had very nice teeth. Because of constant comments about my teeth I don't really want to smile. Even if I do smile, I get so anxious and I can't stop thinking how awful and ridiculous I must look. I hate my smile so much!"
depression,fc0s7us,t1_fc0l2ni,1577298408.0,"I do have a family, but for reasons I'm no longer in contact with them. Not even sure where they are.

I really wanted to have nice christmas and surprise him with a nice gift. Since he doesn't want it, I'll go and see if I can return it."
depression,fc0k4o7,t1_fc0fuid,1577292666.0,"I have nowhere to go. The moment he kicks me out, I'll be homeless. I have no one. I do love him, but it's pretty clear at this point that it isn't really working out.
I'm trying to save money so I could rent my own place but that will take time."
depression,fb3v2ca,t1_fat7ukk,1576490770.0,"I did end up going. Had to stay there way longer than I wanted to. Got mocked for not wanting to drink alcohol, to smoke with them. Got labelled as the most depressive person,  the one that nags the most and so on. It was mentally exhausting.  I'm never going anywhere anymore."
