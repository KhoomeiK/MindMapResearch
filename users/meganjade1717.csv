He is physically dependent,  gets the shakes and hears things if he doesn’t drink. I’ve tried everything and am finally coming to the point where i know i cant make him change, and I’m almost waiting for that phone call, the one you recently received.   I get it. I really do. I am sorry for all you and your family have been through. I truly am."
AmItheAsshole,feymcl5,t3_eqtevd,1579447536.0,"I cant call you an asshole for having these feelings, that had to be terrible to go through. But she was just a kid under a religious regime, can you say you are who you were at that age? I know I’m not.  Heck I’m not who i was 3 years ago. People constantly change and evolve.  I wont tell you whats right or wrong for you, but for me, at least, letting go of the past and all the ugly feelings that came with it, and learning to forgive others for making mistakes, that will do you so much more good than holding on to the hate.  This is just what i have learned being twice your age. Ultimately you have to do what you are comfortable with, and if rekindling your relationship with her is not something you think you can do at this point, thats ok.  Just don’t say never. At least with her.  It seems she has a shot of maybe being a decent person despite your parents.  And as for your parents? I don’t know if what they did could ever be forgiven."

Having someone else pay to make you look more attractive does not grant you the right to cut others down.  Apparently she thinks fixing the outside makes up for having a shitty personality.  It does not. It just makes you a pretty asshole."
JUSTNOMIL,fenubcq,t3_eq0un4,1579290860.0,What the hell? You are a mom and you have to waste your mothers day on her? Your a wife and you have to waste valentines day on her?

Considering how much she fought you when you told her you couldn’t tattoo on her scars, sounds to me she knew what the stipulation but figured whining and begging would change your mind.

If you still want to have some kind of relationship, I don’t see what good can come out of telling her that although i sure do understand why you want to. If she keeps pushing your eventually gonna snap and tell her in a not-so-nice kinda way. If it were me? I’d have no trouble telling her and not having a close relationship with her, based on what you say she sounds toxic and mean. Those are things no one needs in their life."
AmItheAsshole,fe2lroy,t3_enmjga,1578840140.0,"YTA.  WHY did you tell your mom this? What positive thing could come out of saying something so hurtful? I struggle to take care of my son, if he said that it would destroy me. I get wanting better for your kids than you had, but the way you put it seems cold.  You must have a  really nice set of circumstances to say something so heartless.  Change just a few of those and you would be singing a different tune.  You didn’t have it stress free? I am ssooooooo sorry!! Who does? You had the basics, it sounds like, and a mother who sacrificed for YOU. Sounds like you had a mother who loved you. A lot of people don’t. Unless there is more to this story you should apologize. Using “i was just being honest” as an excuse to one-up your own mom just doesn’t cut it."

I think going through several dresses and having each one turned down was enough, and perhaps you could have been more assertive and said “well, I’m sorry you feel this way, but I’m choosing this one.” Not wanting someone who is being negative about every choice doesn’t sound conducive to having your special day be about you. Why the hell does ANYONE think you should twist yourself inside out for other people on YOUR day?"

Him not being capable of giving you what you deserve does not negate that in any way. You have every right to NOT have to deal with his alcoholism and the fallout that occurs because of it.  I am and have dealt with this for over 20 years with my ex. Unfortunately he is the father of my child so I cannot completely walk away. At times i wish I could just let him live how he wants and be done with it. Do what you have to for you, do NOT allow him to keep putting his crap on you. It is not YOUR responsibility to keep him sober, you cannot change him, thats all on him, no matter how hard he tried to twist it around on you. Please don’t fall victim to that.

I wish i had something to say to make a difference but having been through the mill with my ex, having dealt with everything negative you can think of, all i can say is if you get to the point where her drinking makes you miserable then you have to ask yourself what matters more, your happiness or staying with someone you are incompatible with because you still love her.

I haven’t seen that version of him in YEARS.  Hence why he’s my ex. Now? Nasty. ALL THE DAMN TIME. He drinks from the moment he gets up until he passes out. So unless i hit him up in the early morning there is no rational discussion, he projects all his issues onto everyone around him. Mind you, he was a drinker when i met him, but he was a happy drunk. So no one had issues with it, just the occasional “man, you need to slow down, you aren’t gonna be young forever” type stuff.  Now? Just plain abusive. I don’t know why its like that, but every alcoholic i’ve ever known goes down the same road. They just get nastier as time goes on.  My ex will get to blackout mode and say/do some terrible things, yet not remember the damage he causes the next day. I’ve gone as far as to record him to show him the next day, and the first time he saw it he was hit hard, seemed remorseful, but hours later would repeat the same cycle.

motherinlawsfromhell,fcwgwb2,t3_ej2zb8,1578025309.0,"My first red flag was my ex would take a phone call from her and if i was in the room he would go into another room for privacy.  I didn’t think anything of it at the time, i talk to my mom all the time and sometimes prefer privacy depending on what we are talking about.  I had shared things from my past with him, things that happened well before i even knew him, which he shared with her.  Against my wishes. Then came the drunken phone calls from her to me. She was nasty, verbally abusive, calling me names, telling me her son could do better, ya know. Pretty standard stuff. This was before cell phones were a thing. Nasty drunken messages on our home phones voicemail.  When i got a cell phone it got worse, i changed my number twice. She would call/text me at work.  My ex gave her my new number every damn time.  Basically she had a list of family members she would call and abuse, they one by one cut her off and i was the last to do so. Like an idiot i thought if i was patient enough i could get her to accept me, i excused her behavior because of the classic “well, she was drunk....”, etc.  While this was one of the major issues that led to our breakup it wasn’t the only issue. Now, years later, she is very apologetic and has ceased the abuse, jokes on me because now i am dealing with the same crap, only from my ex, not his mom.   The alcoholism runs deep with that family.  Bottom line, if the MIL doesn’t approve and you are with a mamas boy you are pretty much doomed. I used to blame her when it was really his refusal to stick up for me that was to blame. If someone truly loves you, and someone else is attacking you, they will not tell you to suck it up. They will back you up.  Lesson learned. It only took me 15 years to figure that one out.  Reading all these horrific MIL stories hurts my heart.  I know all too well how powerless it makes you feel."

Rehab is not a guarantee that all will be well afterwards, what works for some doesn’t work for others.  Its awesome she took that step! Don’t get me wrong on that. Having been through this for a good 20 years (and still counting) with my ex i can safely say nothing i did or said helped. He needs to change for himself, and despite 2 duis, 2 crashed vehicles, losing me then his son, none of that was his rock bottom. At this point I don’t know if he has a rock bottom.  This is such a tough issue, and every case is different.  Its up to the alcoholic to change.  All i can say is do what YOU need to do to be happy. Only you can decide what that will entail.

alcoholism,fcml6ag,t1_fcmey62,1577779883.0,"I’m really relieved to hear this, and please convey my gratitude to her for allowing this.  It hit me like a ton of bricks. Our family is working on an intervention for my ex, also the father of our child.  He is in a bad way, sadly I don’t think he can just quit and go to AA. He is physically dependent to the point where if he doesn’t drink he gets the shakes, like not minor ones but violent ones, he gets sick, its pretty bad. He has drank every single day i’ve known him (20 years) except for the one day after he crashed his truck, and that was years ago. We know if he were to really give it a go, he will need to be hospitalized.  I’ve done tons of research, we have everything mostly figured out, but seeing this picture REALLY drove it home. Again, THANK YOU AND YOUR MOM so so much for being so brave.  I will be praying for her recovery and for you all to heal from this."

You lost weight, you got healthy, thats a GOOD thing, if it touches a nerve in her then that is her issue, not yours.  Not to sound heartless but it sounds like she is jealous and trying to manipulate you into feeling bad because of her own issues."
AmItheAsshole,fcmf2nr,t3_ehw713,1577772907.0,"NTA. What the f??? Im sorry, but in my mind, my child is my first priority, and if i had to choose (which i did but thats another sad long tale) i would always choose my child first. You are supposed to love your children more than anything, and your wifes reaction is a bit concerning. Its not a competition, and if she sees it that way then maybe she needs to seek some help.  Perhaps her neediness is why your child is always questioning whether you will still love her even when she makes a mistake? Just a theory."
Exercise,fcmesvh,t3_ehw8aw,1577772630.0,"Water. Fill yourself up with water. Stay away from bad food and sugary drinks like soda. Way back i lost 10 pounds in one month just by cutting out soda alone.  (I drank a LOT of soda back then lol) Congrats on making a move to better yourself! I myself have started healthier living and its only been a few weeks, i feel AMAZING compared to before."

I know you aren’t doing this with evil intentions, but PLEASE get her permission.  I am so sorry you are dealing with this. My heart goes out to you and your family."
JUSTNOMIL,fcm6qb3,t3_ehvbga,1577765667.0,"Holy cow what is wrong with this woman??? Allergies like this KILL people all the time so why even risk it???  I wouldn’t let her near your child after this.  Thank god it didn’t end badly, it easily could have. I am struggling to understand what your job has to do with this, sounds like bullshit excuses to me. Im so sorry you have to deal with her crap."

Parenting,fcdohpm,t3_egxed6,1577611966.0,"Is it possible he was severely neglected as a child? That could explain his obsession with food and clothes.  Either way I understand your frustration.  For completely different reasons i used to hate going home as well, no one should ever feel like that about their home."
AmItheAsshole,fcdnnd7,t3_egzphy,1577611763.0,"NTA, hopefully they weren’t doing it to be dicks, if i were to do something that dumb with good intentions and saw your reaction i would feel so horrible. Its called empathy. A lot of people lack this. I am so sorry for your loss."
AmItheAsshole,fcdna25,t3_egvqbi,1577611621.0,"NTA. You do not owe her other kids anything, as harsh as that sounds, why the heck isn’t SHE paying for their game playing? You bought that for your son, if she cant be civil about it and pay her way then you have every right to take it back.  This shouldn’t even be an issue. A similar thing happened with me and my ex, he agreed to charge our netflix on his card one month, and I completely forgot about it. Unfortunately he got whacked a fee from his bank. I paid him back, apologized, and switched it back to my account immediately. I felt like crap about that, and still do. The entitlement of some people just kills me sometimes."

AmItheAsshole,fcd3dcl,t3_eh14e6,1577605851.0,"NTA, why on earth do people think its totally ok to broadcast their phone calls on speakerphone, therefore disturbing everyone else’s peace and quiet, only to get mad when you chime in? Heres a clue, don’t put your conversations on public display if you want people to “mind their business”! Its not difficult to grasp that concept."
motherinlawsfromhell,fcd2910,t3_eh07no,1577605458.0,"Boundaries. I know this word gets kicked around a lot, but set them and stick to them. Tell her that the constant inquisition that your husband has to endure is unacceptable, that whether or not you “fail” or not is YOUR business alone, and not HERS. And if she cant stop? No more visits. Cut her off until she gets it.  Being constantly questioned is causing you both unnecessary stress.  I feel its kind of sickening that she is expecting things to fail and its creepy that it almost sounds like she wants things to implode. I know this isn’t a conversation you want to have, but the more you let her get away with it the worse it will get. My sincere apologies if this comes across as being harsh, but I’m at a point in my life that if someone is constantly giving me anxiety i just will not tolerate it, and it hurts me to see others go through it as well. She sounds pretty toxic."

AlAnon,fcab42t,t3_egqmpl,1577565954.0,"This is classic alcoholic behavior, blame it on someone else. That aside, to involve the sponsors wife, that is beyond unethical.  To have her tell you that his success depends on YOU changing is absolute crap. This is detracting from the issue and giving him all the ammo he needs to lay his issues at your doorstep. All the way around a crappy thing to do."
relationship_advice,fc7xj2v,t3_egm6xj,1577521272.0,"Good on you for saving yourself! My ex MIL was horribly abusive to me, would call me up drunk and rehash all the reasons she hated me, why i was not good enough, etc. Even my ex agrees her treatment if me and his failure to defend me was one of the major reasons we didn’t make it. I wasted my youth trying to make that work.  My heart breaks for every person who is at constant odds with shitty family members.  Hearing stories like yours is almost cathartic for me, i just cant stand to see people try and try and try and still always be treated like dirt.  Im sure it wasn’t easy to make this decision, but its so much better than wasting time banging your head against the wall. Blessings to you!!"
JUSTNOMIL,fc7x0uo,t3_egj4m9,1577520888.0,"Omg that is boundary stomping if i ever saw it!! Good on you for being so diligent with your child using the internet, its not just playing bad games and watching crappy you tube videos that we, as parents, have to worry about.  Allowing a child to be unsupervised on the internet can go really bad really quick. How horrible for MIL to tell your child to keep it a secret!! That is so destructive and undermining."
offmychest,fc7wlhl,t3_egjd33,1577520553.0,"Agreed!! I dont understand why people cheat, yet try like hell to hold on to the person they cheated on. I’ve been cheated on many times and it destroys your self esteem. I am very clear on what i will and will not tolerate. This is one of the things i WILL NOT deal with. And the excuses? “I was drunk!” Or even better “i was pissed at you!” Like really? Its one thing if both parties agree to see other people. But to “play” being devoted yet still screwing other people? Completely immoral."
