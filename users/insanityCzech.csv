I appreciate this! This is similar to what originally came to mind. But I don’t think I can get away with it.

I’ve also been splitting the lines into a large array, but I keep getting discouraged because it seems out of scope of the course. I may end up using structs or parallel arrays because it gets really confusing.

Here’s the suggested algorithm (3’s proper position is giving me the issues)

The algorithm for creating a keyword index is:

1 Read a word from the input file

2 Scan the index and determine if the word is already present in the index

3 If the word is not already in the index, insert the word in the proper position in the index

4 Scan the list of lines for the word to determine if the current file line number is already in the list of lines

5 If the current file line number is not already in the list of lines, insert the current file line number in the proper position in the list of lines

6 Repeat until no more words in the file"

science,fep4i9r,t1_feovv9f,1579311950.0,"I don’t think Paleolithic ancestors needed nutrients facts. They worked for every calorie and none of it was sugar-processed. Sure, some people died from poison, but people still die from that (and we have youtube).

Agriculture in the Neolithic taught us that concentrating and processing things made then calorie rich per size and tasty. It also taught us that working less for these types of food was more valuable than the alternative.

It’s the same with drugs too. If you keep taking this super concentrated stuff, that’s all you’re going to want.

So now we have these calorie leaden foods that we eat in a hurry after 9 hours of being at work, then 6 hours of sleep, etc. Did you remember to work out, and did you remember to drink your water? If you didn’t, you’re probably don’t feel full and end up eating way too many calories."

Some companies focus on getting the cheapest, and so they focus on cost up and down the value chain. Amazon, alibaba, frys

Differentiated companies, like Apple, Mercedes (which has garbage quality these days), lululemon, etc would never focus on cost. In fact, they hate using numbers in their marketing. You’ll hardly ever see Apple touting GHz or GBs because then customers could directly compare specs to other computers (which you can do on your own if you know what you’re looking for). This strategy takes a lot of marketing power, and you pretty much have to babysit how special the value of each operation is along the value chain."
