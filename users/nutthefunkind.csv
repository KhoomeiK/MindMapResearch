curlyhair,ff680m2,t3_erw6ty,1579621311.0,"my routine is:

* wash with herbal progessional hair treatment lowpoo (i add several drops of tea tree oil in there to help with my itchy scalp)
* apply a bit of tresemme botanique pro collection coconut oil & aloe vera and comb with a brush
* put my head under the shower so it gets really wet and squish to condition while head is upside down
* apply a bit of water on my hair but leave around 70% of conditioner in
* air dry

i wash daily because my hair (especially my bangs) get a bit oily throughout the day and during the night.

i don't use gel or mousse because my hair is not curly and i'm 99% it would look really bad.

i'm still trying to figure out how to tame the frizz, so far i've only used coconut oil but if i leave it in without rinsing my hair it looks like i haven't showered since 2016.

previously i used h&s shampoo for dandruff for several years so i was scared as heck to give it up. so far the dandruff hasn't come back, thank god.

any tips for a wavie would be really appreciated 💖

edit: the inner layers of my hair seem to curl a lot and i've even found several wide coil-like curls. does anyone know why the outer layers will appear way flatter and straighter and any ideas to prevent it?"
