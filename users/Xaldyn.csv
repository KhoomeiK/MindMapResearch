Mainly, if you want to go back to camp but don't feel like running half-way across the freaking New World to try and lose that one Barnos' aggro.

They're also really good for emergencies. If you're about to get hit by something like, say, an Elder Dragon's signature nova attack, you can get the hell out of Dodge despite not having time to dodge. Once you use it, you're invincible for the entire animation.

They're good for restocking items, too. Nothing's worse than running out of potions or ammo/coatings mid-fight. And, while you can only carry one, you effectively never actually run out since they bring you to the place where you can restock them.

And finally, their most underrated use: a pause button substitute. If you're mid-combat but something comes up IRL -- like, the phone rings, or your SO/roommate/friend/parents/ect. need you for something, or you just really have to use the restroom -- just pop a Farcaster and go do whatever it is you need to do now that you can safely go AFK*(AFC?)*."

gaming,fe6xw9s,t3_eny8g6,1578907534.0,"I grew up having insomnia so bad that I was prescribed ambien when I was still just a teen. Now, though, I literally wake up almost exactly 8 hours after going to bed, feeling well rested, without even needing to set an alarm. Here's what helped me get to that point:

- Start going to to bed at the same time every night. Even if you just have to lay there awake the first few nights while your body adjusts to actually having a sleep schedule, just do it. Not sticking to it on weekends is fine, just try not to go more than two days in a row of staying up late.

- Once you're actually sleeping on a set schedule, start setting your alarm for ten hours after whatever time you go to bed. That way, you can get your eight hours of sleep even if you don't fall asleep right away, and you're pretty much always going to wake up naturally at least an hour before the alarm. The psychological comfort alone of just knowing you don't have to wake up to an alarm makes a world of a difference. No anxiety about having to wake up tired, and no anxiety of accidentally oversleeping since you've got an extra two hours of insurance.

- *Mother. Fuckin'. Weighted. Blankets.* I finally got curious enough to try one and I'm never going back. They are heaven.

- I'm sure you've heard about avoiding blue light a little while before bed, but you don't actually have to give up electronics to do so. If you're using a tv, go into the settings menu and change the picture color balance to ""warm"". If you're using a computer, use a program like f.lux or something. If you're using your phone/tablet, use a similar program, I'm sure you can find an app for it. Instead of using your regular lights, use a single lamp in the room with a warm-colored lightbulb.

- Don't eat at least two hours before sleeping. (This helps with chronic heartburn, too).

- Keep the room as cool as comfortably/affordably possible, and/or take a hot shower/bath some time before bed. The idea is to lower your temperature slightly, (the hot shower/bath does so by opening up your capillaries, making you lose heat more easily once you get out), which helps your body fall and stay asleep.

- Don't do anything in bed other than sleep, (and sex). That means no messing around on your phone or watching a show or movie or whatever. Your subconscious is a thing of habit -- if you strictly and consistently limit laying in bed to mean one thing, your body will associate it with that thing.

- Have some sort of white noise while you sleep. A fan is an easy way to do this, with the added bonus of helping with the previous point about keeping cool. If you listen to music, try to avoid anything with lyrics or that is upbeat and high-tempo. And the more repetitive the music is, the better; that way, just like the white noise, it gives your mind something to focus on that doesn't involve much actual thinking."

It's a mechanic that rewards good teamwork, and punishes poor teamwork.

> (because it's my fault if I don't have FF, I should have known they were going to join)

If you keep getting tripped and it bothers you but you refuse to do anything about it, then yes, it is your fault. Either use Flinch-Free, get better at cooperating with less skilled players, or play with people who know better. By inviting random people, you are fully aware that anyone of any skill level can join. They don't just join your hunts randomly without your knowing, *you* choose for that to happen.

> and does nothing for people that know how to position except make them have to give up a slot if they want to play with anyone they don't trust 100%>

It *does* do something for people who know how to position as a team: it rewards them with a smoother hunt. Ask any veteran of the series, and they'll tell you that some of their best memories were of finding a random team online that you happen to click really well with, joining up as a party, and doing hunts together for hours on end. The SOS system sadly makes this less common in World, but I mean, you're already on reddit, go check out /r/monsterhunterclan for that. Ultimately, if you don't like working together with and maintaining situational awareness of teammates, don't play with teammates. Monster Hunter is still just as amazing solo."

That stuff is more expensive because it works better. There are plenty of common, not-obviously-feminine scents that are pretty subtle, like coconut, rose, anything with honey, etc.

But more importantly, just use less shampoo and turn down the temperature when washing and rinsing your hair. Skip a day on the shampoo, just using conditioner and water instead. If you've got oily hair, it'll get worse at first, but after a week or two of skipping shampoo every other day, it will get significantly less oily. If you're having trouble with the adjustment period, rinse it an extra time every day (with just water), and blowdry it (not on high!). Basically, just do the whole /r/NoPoo thing, but taken to a less extreme. Your hair will end up a lot healthier, and your scalp will end up less dry.

...There's also that thing popular with some women where you put oils or egg whites or something weird into your hair and let it sit for a bit to moisturize your hair/scalp, but there's no way in hell I'd be able to handle something like that. Way too gross for me. I'm sure it works great if it wouldn't bother you, though."

monsterhunterrage,fdj1wv8,t1_fdhpy5p,1578456319.0,"> You mentioned needing to use the temporal or rocksteady but I literally NEVER use either. They're not efficient whatsoever. It's like using earplugs for a monster that roars a handful of times per hunt.

Not really. The point of them in this context is to guarantee a clutch claw attack without being knocked off. And unlike roars, monsters are always attacking -- they don't just attack a handful of times per hunt. Hardly what I'd call inefficient.
