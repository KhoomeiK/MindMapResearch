socialskills,fe64iup,t1_fe643dx,1578881615.0,"you should, it shows you that you not all about brawn and that you can convey emotion. i'd rather be seen as different i can't cope with being normal

socialskills,fe63si5,t1_fe6205e,1578881147.0,"i def should have done that, i would have spared my self from the outcome

i can see that. but she practiced or had a game every week day except for the weekends. but still i can see that

ya i think that was a stupid reason to stay friends reflecting on it.

i mean i don't see why you still cant stay friends but in my case i should have ""cut loose and bailed""

my friends did come to my side after they saw the stuff on my private story. and like i said they took me out to get my mind off of her. but still i definitely talked to one of them instead. they understood what i was going through though.  and ya i can also understand that dumping my feelings like that creates a negative image.

ohhhh alright. thanks for that advice. i definitely understand that putting others before yourself is a very important thing to live by, because if you put your self before others it makes you look egotistical or even narcissistic ( if im getting that right)

thanks"
socialskills,fe61b0z,t1_fe5z6z7,1578879563.0,"sorry i should have been more clea

i said i ***was*** invested in girls.

 i attempted to ask her out about 2 months in but she wasn't ready.

 ya after that friendship ended i realized she did basically rejected me

we were close to dating, very close. but we realized how hard it would be, she does sports all the time (we can barley talk and go out) and we are 45 minutes apart. i mean ya ""love has no boundaries"" but still it would be very hard. than a month before that we had a talk about us in the future and how we were going to stay friends so all attempts were basically thwarted. im not the one who poured my feelings, she poured hers to the guy.

the feelings were on my private story which at the time basically no one was on (3-5) people. i had no way of venting i needed to let it out. the Russian thing was on my public story were she saw it. but ya i could see fair game i pissed her off to much. i really should have just kept to myself. 

lol ya that was a  **HUGE** mistake 

oh ya for sure. shes a great person and friend. 

im just so nervous to talk. i don't want to talk to much because i feel like im boring the girl to death but on the other hand i don't want to talk to little. what im trying to say is that im VERY scared."

schoolsucks,fe5tef7,t1_fe5l1y6,1578874529.0,"most definitely learning will forever be life long. and i can see that also put the problem is that it is so boring and pointless to most that no one pays attention to it at all. if it were more engaging and rewarding in someway that made you feel as if you've conquered a great feet than i have a strong belief that instead of 25 percent of class kinda participating, atleast 75% to 80% of the class would participate. 

i can understand that but i feel that learning it early and being more prepared will lead to more of a reduced stressful time doing taxes. but those are always going to be stressful because you're giving a substantial part of your earnings away."

Guitar,fe55xgc,t3_enr75c,1578865934.0,im fine with fender doing because their not as in your face about it and more chill and toned back (also because im very bias towards fender). but the others really bother me especially that one older guy with the mow hawk and the Paul.
