Speaking rapidly and/or saying offensive things is a problem I continue to struggle with. It has cost me friends, family, jobs, and self-esteem. Pot has helped me more or less switch this off. I agree with the some of the negative side effects: I appear to have slowed down mentally over time (i started using at 23 regularly and not before at all). I don't know if I could continue to be employed without pot even with the mental decline--fogginess, it's better than being sober and jobless.

Sometimes I wonder about going clean, pot's my last medication. I've weened myself off of everything else. Is it worth it?"
