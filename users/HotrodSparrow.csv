Today is all raves!! I've been eating a deficit, doing IF and OMAD, and I already feel great! I've stopped drinking during the week, and my boyfriend and I are trying to only drink once a week, if at all, (which is a huge change from EVERY. DAMNED. DAY.)
I was able to run on Saturday for the first time since LAST fucking April!!! My hip was pissed a little, but I stretched and adjusted my gait and things seem to be way better!! WOOT WOOT!!!"

fatlogic,fdqysw4,t1_fdqyep4,1578676971.0,"It's really frustrating, because I moved here in the first place so that I could rely on public transportation. My anxiety and PTSD aren't managed as well as they could be, (one of my goals this year is to get into therapy) but it just blows my mind how often I end up arguing with people about weight loss, and the HAES shit is inundating everything. I don't see the obesity epidemic doing anything but getting worse and causing more problems for all of us. :("
fatlogic,fdqw1xj,t3_ems7pb,1578675629.0,"I'm really just exhausted with the fact that there's not enough room on the trains anymore because of how fat everyone in the US has gotten. I've been riding the trains in Boston now for 3 years, and I just see how big everyone is getting each year. The 3 seaters are now for 2 fat people, and the 2 seaters can fit one fat person, or maybe 2 people that would be considered average 10 years ago. The only time there is plenty of room is if they have more than 5 cars. And normally there are only 4. The aisles are full of people and it's normally the more normal weighted people.
All I can think of is if there's an emergency, I'm going to die, or be incapacitated by someone's obese body, or if anything I won't be able to help someone due to their size or the lack of room on the trains. 
I have PTSD from trauma related to car/motorcycle accidents, and it's very difficult for me to drive, but it's starting to become evident that the trains are not going to get any better, so I guess fuck me, I gotta ""get over it"" and get a car and drive again. I just don't know what to do. :("

fatlogic,fcxjncp,t3_ejgni9,1578064569.0,"Happy first Fat Rant Friday of the New Year everyone!
So raves first off- this time last year I was 200lbs. I weighed in this morning at 188.8lbs. My goal for this month is to lose 5lbs with IF, CICO, and some mild keto with a focus on lots of leafy greens. I've also got my road bike set up on a trainer in my apartment so I have NO excuses not to get some cardio in. 
Rants: I was at 173lbs last year around September and I let my emotional eating get the better of me, but I did figure out what makes me binge, what makes me stay on track and what doesn't work. 
Rave: My boyfriend is on track to help and is very supportive of us following a healthy eating path. 
Rant: Last night we got drunk and ate a bunch of insanely delicious Mexican food from a local restaurant near our place, but we both agreed that we're going to meal prep tonight and not stay again. Here's to all of us reaching our goals this year! :)"
