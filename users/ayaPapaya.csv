Basically cuts out all processed foods, sugar, pasta, and what you're left with is whole foods: vegetables, fruit, meat (I would also maybe keep brown rice, quinoa, and beans, since they're filling, nutritious and inexpensive).  Stay a bit under your TDEE, and eat enough protein every day.   It's not easy, but you also don't have to do it as strictly as they say is necessary.  If you want to bulk and lose weight at the same time, some would say it’s just not possible, I would say just be patient."

Our inner critic really holds us back from loving ourselves.  Sometimes I try to envision myself (my inner child) as this poor kid who had a really hard time growing up, and then it makes it a little easier.  We all deserve compassion."

fitness30plus,feaw4d0,t3_eo59cn,1578952783.0,"I started a 3x a week split (push/legs/pull).  Everyday I start with a 10 min run around the track (\~1 mile), then about an hour or so in the weight room.  I have heard that it's important to separate anaerobic from aerobic exercises, that it changes the way you body responds to the exercise.  Does that mean I should move my run (which I use as a warm up, although it's still fairly challenging still) to a non weight lifting day?"

DecidingToBeBetter,fe0ukkx,t1_fe0a7sr,1578818810.0,"I’m glad you have a wonderful therapist!  I totally resonate and understand. For awhile it was a bit of that for me too (the back and forth). But I have found that under every thought is a feeling, and if I can tap into that, I can release it instead of getting carried away by it. To be totally real with you, there was a lot of grieving that was required before I could let a lot of it go. That’s ok. Grieving is necessary. But then I imagined that if there was a higher power, what would it’s unconditional love feel like, how would I envision it. And I felt a warm light glowing  in my chest, and it brought me peace. Now I try not to engage in any of the back and forth, life is hard enough, the inner critic can take a back seat. Take a slow deep breath and feel my heart and know that I am loved."

Well, do you have any friends? Sometimes it takes awhile to meet people you connect with emotionally, but it’s absolutely necessary for our mental health. Is there a particular reason why you aren’t meeting similar minded people or why you don’t like the people you meet?  Have you thought about joining a running group (or something where you can do your hobbies with others)? I like meetups! Totally recommend it.  Show up without expectations, but try to be open and not too judgmental and connection night  come a bit easier."
