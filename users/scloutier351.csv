This is just stupid.  As is the assumption that OP was trying to destroy his sister's relationship! She made a nasty remark and OP snapped back with the truth.  If you can't take the heat, you shouldn't be dishing it out to other people!  Saying that she should have been exempt from being called out on her crap behavior *that she willingly did in front of her own boyfriend* is completely asinine.

I had a concussion and broken nose - with blood literally everywhere.  After perfunctory xrays of my spine, I was left to wait in my room (closet).  I went looking for my kids, as my mother and husband were with them and i wanted to reassure myself that they were perfectly fine.  After a bit, I tried to go back to my room as I still hadn't seen a doctor, nurse, what-have-you.  A nurse stopped me in the hallway directly in front of my room door, ""You can't go in there.""  Confused, I looked around wildly...maybe I was mistaken?  Double-checked the room number....E17.  Yup that's me, so I told her that was the room I was given,  I had just left to check on my family.  She shook her head and said, somewhat impatiently, ""No, you don't understand.  Since you weren't using it, we gave it to another patient. ""   I was floored.  I had been gone maybe 10, 12 minutes maximum!  So replied, ""Oh? So I've been discharged?  I must have missed the doctor.""  She then proceeded to inform me that the doctor hadn't, in fact, been by at all. And I obviously hadn't been discharged.   She was speaking to me like I might be mentally challenged, with somewhat of an attitude.  Keep in mind, I'm standing there with blood all over my face and clothes (in fact a good bit of it had dried and was starting to make breathing through my nose a hardship) and now I have my own personal Nurse Rached talking down to me bc I left my room unoccupied for a couple minutes!  So I ask, ""All right. I haven't been treated or discharged yet, so where do you want me to go?""

>Febrile means high fever. 


Actually, it doesn't! Febrile is defined primarily as 1)having or showing the symptoms of a fever (adjective).
2)having or showing a great deal of excitement or nervous energy (adjective) 

In regards to your source: in literally the first sentence of this article it references febrile seizures resulting typically in ""a rapid spike of temperature""...which is what I said.  A spike = a rise, or rapid elevation; i.e. *change* in temperature.   You just proved my point for me.  

In regards to my personal experience, on this occasion it was the result in a rapid *drop* in temperature, but still met the criterion for, ""a rapid change,"" in temperature.   I got that information from the doctor who treated my daughter in the ER, which was later confirmed via her pediatrician at that time.  

But then, you likely argue with *anybody* just because you don't like being wrong.  Who does??But, as it stands, your response was incorrect regarding what,""febrile,"" actually means, instead attempting to tailor it to support your argument.   Which was then debunked further by the reference you provided.  Sorry, it is what it is. I try to correct this assumption whenever I encounter it, to prevent anyone else enduring the same bone-chilling fear upon hearing that your infant child was initally unresponsive...after exhibition of traits typically displayed during a seizure.

is NOT correct. Febrile seizures are typically the result of rapid *changes* in a fever.

>overweight middle-aged toddler 

To: 

>overweight white-haired, wrinkled toddler.  

Only because a) it's in all likelihood true; op stated she was 70 somewhere in her post history and b) because I'm just evil like that ;)
Seriously, after reading (all at once when I saw the [Update] post) everything this woman has done and said to OP...goodgodalmighty!  You would have to be some sort of saint for not completely losing your shit on MIL!  I would have acted petty long before now.  Like, leaving the house with my LO immediately prior to their visits.  \\\ Whoopsie! My phone was dead and I didn't notice!  Sorry, I guess LO and I will have to catch you some other time...// At the bare minimum, I probably would have at least bitch-slapped her at least once by now! (Her comments in the hospital room, following LO#1's birth come immediately to mind...)And I am normally the last person that would ever resort to violence unless it was over life or death kinda stuff....but with her and her mouth??  Uh-uh, all bets are off!  I salute you, OP and much luck during any future encounters."
piercing,fd5u5g0,t1_fd5e3mz,1578181542.0,"I was gonna ask if you thought it might be keloid tissue, but stopped myself lol.  I had one inside my nostril-next to the piercing itself. (Had it pierced 2 separate times, the first was positioned weird/wrong) and it only went away after  (frustrated with the fact that changing jewelry always hurt and irritated it) I removed it permanently.  As I mentioned before, a dermatologist should be able to either offer suggestions or a solution. I am sorry to say that I don't have one, aside from suggesting that you try giving witch hazel a try. I know it's used in a lot of things relevant to inflamed or swollen tissue.  At the very least, it couldn't hurt..?  Wait, you are sure the bump is keloid and not potentially a clogged pore?
Eta: from what I know of keloids, is they can continue to grow in size - scar tissue can increase as the fibroblasts continue to multiply; often even after the original wound has healed. Chamomile compresses could help some. But I would continue the saline and tea tree oil, particularly since it helped previously.  Good luck."
AmItheAsshole,fd5cjbr,t3_ejycvt,1578176268.0,"NTA - everyone else here already covered the reasons. 

OP- did your wife's deceased grandfather happen to have a middle name that could be considered instead?  If not, is grandfather's last name one that you could potentially use as a middle name? 
My point is, you could let your wife know that there are other ways to honor her grandfather, rather than potentially dooming your kid to a lifetime of conflict, due to having a name synonymous with an unidentified male."

If it's scar tissue, then it's mostly permanent - unless you consult with a dermatologist and they feel confident they can remove it safely by electrocautery or surgically."
piercing,fd587zg,t1_fan0x2e,1578175104.0,"Actually, if those hoops are surgical grade stainless steel, then those are the best option while it heals. A post or labret can potentially ""stick"" to the wound/piercing as it heals.  Just keep them clean, and when cleaning with the sterile saline (many shops sell it, there is a good one called something like,""H20 Ocean Spray,"") with *clean hands* carefully rotate the hoop.  Are these the kind with the captive ball or infinity hoops?

ETA: actually, a flat back labret post is probably the worst option if a)newly pierced or b) infected"
entitledparents,fd4yn78,t1_fd4qjzg,1578172446.0,"OP describes the 3 year old as, ""running off,"" repeatedly, nothing said that she was going inside, and the only time the parents appear is *after* the little one fell and was, in all likelihood, crying, THEN the sister still had to go knock on their door to let them know what happened.   That doesn't sound like they were keeping a careful eye on her.  
And for the record, you DO realize this is r/entitledparents, right?  Where people share their personal experiences with bad and/or entitled parents.  Redditors can then draw conclusions - and even comment-based on the information provided.  That's how this works.  I am sorry that you took my comment *regarding complete and total strangers* as a potential slight on your own style of parenting.  The story clearly indicated that these parents weren't exactly paying much attention to their toddler, even after the big brouhaha immediately following the child's fall - OP stated that his sister STILL had to go to their front door to get their attention.  Apparently, a crying and/or screaming toddler wasn't enough.  Based off the information available, I stand by my initial assessment of their child's clear lack of supervision."

relationship_advice,fcvrjg9,t1_fcvn6tt,1578008481.0,"It is true that the two terms are sometimes considered synonymous, but there are others that say they are similar, but not altogether exactly the same.  From this standpoint, professionals say that a psychopath is completely lacking a conscience, whereas a sociopath has a weak one.  They can recognize a little guilt or remorse, but it ultimately does absolutely nada to dissuade them from their goals.  There are also arguments that alot of psychopaths can seem perfectly normal, even friendly - but they use emotions as tools solely to manipulate others into doing what they want.  Sociopaths, on the other hand, most don't try to hide their special brand of 'crazy', simply because they don't care what other people think.  Regardless, both terms are considered subsets from Antisocial Personality Disorder, as they all share the same traits.  (Btw, I am just offering another perspective is all, not in any way intended as malicious.)"
relationship_advice,fcvktt3,t1_fcu85e6,1578004243.0,"Regarding therapy, you may have to try a few different ones before finding a good fit, but don't get discouraged! I think therapy will help you learn to view things in a healthier light; ie not so down on yourself all the time.

As far as your ex goes, I would get a restraining order if the abuse continues-in ANY form: texts, email, calls, using different numbers, etc.  I would continue to avoid any contact whatsoever!  She is not a good person, OP. And, contrary to what you think, you do NOT deserve that! No one does.  You seem a compassionate individual that was attentive and supportive to your partner - these are all good things, traits most women are dying to find in a mate!  So the nasty suggestion that you could never have or find anyone else is total BS.  After I read your previous post, I was going to ask you if you supported her financially as well.  This post confirmed it for me.  I am sorry to say, that the fact that you lavishly gifted her money in addition to paying for EVERYTHING probably plays a large factor in her attempt at telling you that she did what she did was ""out of love"" and then when that didn't work, her extreme anger. She lost her piggy bank.  Her bank with atm that she emotionally and verbally abused on a regular basis.  OP, when you decide to date again, you will notice that most women **don't*** expect their SO to pay for or do everything.  Relationships are all about give and take, and learning how to compromise - in addition to the lusty parts! ;-)  Start learning how to love yourself a little more every day beforehand, though.  A relationship involves loving each other, but first you gotta learn how to love yourself!  That comes from learning that you do deserve love, and  valuing *all* aspects of your own self.  You aren't just what you see in the mirror, you know.  I wish you equal amounts of success, luck and even love.  You do you."
