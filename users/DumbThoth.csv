Iamactuallyverybadass,ff9v21k,t1_fcoxih8,1579722089.0,"Even if the sentiment was nice. If hes making untrue statements and passing them off as fact under the guise of his ""nice sentiment"" they still should be addressed so you aren't spreading misinformation.

The guy equates the objective and evidence based pursuit of science with a belief in god. Though one can believe both are true only one is verifiable hence why religion takes ""a leap of faith"" which science does not.

He also falsely states that ""Meanwhile half of science, you’re just told not to question why it is"" which is massively false and intentionally misleading.

He also makes baseless claims such as "" Any loophole you find in religion, there’s double in science"".

The commenter is then being passive aggressive and dishonest by saying stuff like ""And that’s what you think. I don’t mind you thinking that, even though you’re wrong""... if you want to frame this as an issue of opinion the correct and non-demeaning wording would be; ""And that’s what you think. I don’t mind you thinking that, even though  I THINK you’re wrong.""

Also the person you are responding to was incited by the guy tacking on ''Prayers work, even if you think they don’t"" to the end of his ""nice sentiment"" which is a statement that's just blasting a personal opinion/belief as a fact again.

Regardless of what evidence you follow or what you have faith in, one needs to accept fallibility when commenting on subjective matters of opinion. Also to make badly informed and inaccurate statements and then to say them as if they were infallible is going to draw criticism, as it should.

I would however adjust the atheists response to be less insulting at times. To call god ""imaginary"" is unnecessary and usually done as a slight. be it Krishna, Thoth, Zoroaster or Yaweh, any god that someone believes in, only requires faith (without any need objective\* evidence). So its a given that its a leap of faith, so to then go through the extra step label it as imaginary is a bit pompous and redundant as well as meant to insult and incite in itself.

I'm a philosophical Buddhist/agnostic so i don't really have a horse in this race but the atheist is 99% right here and just calling out misinformation and preaching where it lies under the disguise of a ""nice sentiment"" ,even if he doesn't have a perfect approach.  One can believe prayers work, but there's no OBJECTIVE evidence of such so to state it as infallible is inciting and ignorant to those of other beliefs as well as to tack it on to a ""nice sentiment"" and say it's beyond reproach because of that is subversive.

u/OblongJohnSilver you're only catching hate because people aren't realizing this. You're right though and even though i don't think the guy was trying to be subversive, he was, and you are right to call it out as well as to call out the following misinformation. People who don't understand the need to address that clearly don't see the damage that misinformation, ignorance and subversion causes in our society.

u/Jhon615, genuinely thanks for all but the ending of your sentiment as that part was nice. If you believe in prayer great but dont push that on other people or you'll catch hate for preaching, even if it was unintentional.

It's like if i told people to do good even when no one is watching because Karma is real even if you dont believe in it.  Yeah its a nice statement, and one i believe in, and people should do good, even when no one is watching. but it lacks objectivity and evidence to attribute anything to ""Karma"", hence it conflates belief with objective fact so someone would still be right to call that out.

Sorry if this comes of as a lecture/ too much mediating, i'm a dad."

I think some of these posts are stretching it. Also Ghislaine and Epstein I'm pretty sure were just doing everything from photo-bombing to honeypotting celebs to force their implications as a future insurance plan. Some celebs that interacted with them are clearly more guilty then others. (E.g. bill Clinton, prince Andrew and trump all seem tooo involved). Theres even a book that's come out that was written by a member of the mossad who claims he was their handler at times as they were doing this for Israel or some shit. Now I dont think they needed to be Israeli spies to need to do this, I think it's just obvious if you're playing really dirty games in very powerful circles, itd make sense to implicate as many people as possible, regardless of actual association, in this manner.  I think we should think critically about these photos and only post photos of people they repeatedly interacted with. The Celerbrity world is very very small.

This works with your average college student but just go to the hood if you want to see how that mindset works out when its common. Go try ""being scarier"" in an altercation there and see what happens. It's an especially prevalent way to think there but people who match this mindset really are everywhere. And trust me, you'd don't want PTSD either even if you ""win"". I cant hold my kid or partner anymore sometimes because of the tension that gets trapped in my body while thinking about past violence, you wont feel tough then.

Also this happened in Canada, If he fucked that guy up with the bong hed be liable despite ""defending the store"". Also addicts and criminals often have trauma and are just as liable to black out and fuck you up if they feel they are in a corner.

If i see an aggressive little raccoon in the wild, i know i can 100% kick it's ass and kill it due to it's size, I'm even pretty sure i could make it run away by just challenging/charging it if its being aggressive, due to my own size. But if it comes at me in a park im just gonna run away like a little girl because fighting the little shit is a zero sum game. When i was younger i would have just seen it as something to deal with and likely tried to subdue/kill it and though it might work, i then got to deal with that exertion as well as risk getting scratched, biten and infected with disease when the little shit turns out to have rabies and is being more brave/aggresive than it should be, why would i do that when i can just run/walk away (or give up in the case of a robbery)? 

Next time someone you think you can take gets aggressive with you, picture a rabid raccoon and ask yourself if you still want to throw down just so you can talk about that one time you beat up a raccoon (crack-head)."

They're especially relevant when you want to question majority (or even large minority) held beliefs to the demographic that holds them.

If i want to feel free to question the organization i'm a part of to try and make it better, other members of the organization shouldn't be weighing the attention brought to the topic based on whether or not they agree... 

&#x200B;

If someone wants to ignore this issue i can again point to events on the sub as well as the fact that this very post was reflexively plunged into the negative as soon as it was made for being criticism in and of itself until another brother and i pointed it out in another comment and reverse-psychology took effect and it flew back up again. 

&#x200B;

And for those saying people don't just reflexively downvote There's even another commenter (who's clearly one of these ""reflexive downvoters"") that has just commented as to why he thinks that needs to be practiced (pretty much because he thinks we should keep our dirty laundry out of the public domain just so we don't dissuade applicants -don't even get me started there).

Even if you go to the trash heap which is r/askreddit you'll find people using the site mechanics properly as they enforce this rule, same with other experience/debate friendly subs, as Masons we should surely hold ourselves to a higher degree than that. Im studying now and like i said this isn't the environment to discuss my qualms as its not receptive to productive conversation so i'm unlikely to respond to anything else in this thread unless its someone providing me another sub as per the request made with my post, i just had to respond to this as i find your argument is systematic of the problem.

Cheer's Brothers, Back to my studying now."
memorialuniversity,fdd66n4,t1_fdd1fvs,1578296537.0,Will it tell us for the afternoon then as well. as these exams are at 4:30 and 7 pm?
freemasonry,fdcs42i,t1_fdcrjf7,1578282722.0,Yes please. Im honestly too jaded to make a post here about anything too controversial. I think their insistance was misplaced or at least being made by a different populace to those shooting the convos in the foot. This sub more than most seems fickle and as if it misunderstands that the downvote button isn't for marking that you just disagree with a statement. I'll even help moderate if you want.
freemasonry,fdcq5h8,t1_fdcolrs,1578281253.0,See what im talking about. We need a sub orientated specifically for masonic debate to avoid the knee jerk reaction downvoting. Id have no problem debating with a female/clandestine mason to try and build gaps because were meant to be good people striving for truth.

freemasonry,fdcn75k,t1_fdcn1ot,1578279087.0,"I don't personally. The problem is that it affects the conversation/traffic and creates negative echo-chambers, (thats just a problem with reddit mechanics)."
freemasonry,fdcmxbn,t1_fdcmaki,1578278891.0,"While i appreciate that and understand there are many here open to dialogue as we should be there are far too many who are not. The knee-jerk reflex to downvote anything critical of the brotherhood is very real. Simply look at the people who have resigned or criticized us for our stances on our membership rules, nepotism amongst lodges, or decrying brothers for spreading hate or politically divisive material on social media, they've all been downvoted to the point that no productive conversation ensues and the OP's are usually linched for thinking this was the place to ""preach"" on the brotherhood or for treating the subreddit like a lodge/masonic court."

iranian,fdbr9nu,t1_fdb9mgu,1578260712.0,"Why Macron? Will France be taking the lead with this army? If so, why? (genuinely curious here, im not used to having someone to talk to this stuff about). As for the Americans and NATO they also have an upcoming election where they are likely to flip blue again and begin some reparations and ensure some more securities, while it wont undo the damage i still think that needs to be taken into account. If it stays red however i agree NATO will lose all structure/power and slowly dissolve if not implode. Though those troops (that id also agree) would show up to try and keep the US in line, they would be forced to do it under the pretence of still being somewhat allied with the US and the US will almost definitely use this to try and instigate them also getting dragged into any conflict as America likes to implicate people when they get mud on their hands. Im just some geopolitik Nerd behind a keyboard in Canada though so im not going off anything more than the rest of ya."
iranian,fdb62pd,t1_fdb3so5,1578254219.0,"""allow"" them to stay. The thing im trying to imply is that America doesnt give a fuck and wont leave just because they've been asked. They'll stay and occupy the area through force if necessary, they don't give AF about war in the middle east. What they do care about is  being seen following orders of a foreign power that they've positioned themselves against (even if they're within their sovereign territory and jurisdiction). Dealing with the US like that is like trying to wash off tar."

(iran even has their own banks). if you want to try and structure a couple dozen grand in money you want to withdraw in you're local western bank branch sure, but these rules hardly apply to that level of wealth."
