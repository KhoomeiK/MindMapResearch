Feel free to search it if you're still unsure."

StarWarsBattlefront,fetattl,t1_fesxet0,1579373430.0,"Right, simple misunderstanding then. Thank you."
StarWarsBattlefront,fesvlg8,t3_eqjhm3,1579369466.0,"Yeah, me too! It says on my menu that there is a new Capital Supremacy map, so that update may've caused it?"

depression,fd9dcxh,t1_fd7rpcv,1578231850.0,"Thanks, I plan to, but I'm just scared of the consequences for doing so. My family don't know about all of this, so when they get told, it may be quite a shock."
depression,fd6hyif,t1_fd1uwif,1578191308.0,"Agreed. I've told a fair few of my friends about my suicidal ideation and depression, and no one really checks on me. It's worse during the holidays too."
