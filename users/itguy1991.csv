Based on the way you've asked your question(s), it's pretty clear that you've not done much research on your own (there's a [ton of info for newbies](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/5gz4yp/stumbled_into_rhomelab_start_here/) in the [homelab wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/index)), and you've certainly not tried anything on your own.

If you're interested in learning windows server, start by doing some searches for setting up Windows server (i.e. ""how to install Windows server 2019"", ""How to set up Active directory on Windows server 2019"" , ""how to set up file sharing on Windows Server 2019"", ""Windows server 2019 introduction tutorial""). There are literally thousands out there from blogs to YouTube series.

Frankly, you're not going to learn how to work with a server operating system by asking people how to use it. You're going to learn it by using it, breaking it, and fixing it--that's the whole point of a homelab.

&#x200B;

Furthermore, if you're looking to start a career in IT (which your post history indicates to me that you do), it's going to be your job to find solutions for problems. If your go-to is to post a question online without researching it yourself first, you're not going to get very far in the field.

In my almost 13 years in this career, I've worked with all sorts of people. I've seen guys that will get into a near trance-like state researching issues and testing possible solutions, only asking for help once they've banged their head against the wall for a while. I've also seen guys that get an error popup and turn and ask me what it means.

I'll let you guess which ones have succeeded and which ones I've recommended for termination

Based on what I can find by Googling ""YNAB Goals"" its not anywhere near as feature-rich as Mint.

I have a goal to pay off my car. In that goal, it shows me that if I pay the minimum monthly payments, it will take 3 years and 10 months, and I will pay a total of $537 in interest. If I move the slider, or type in an increased monthly payment, it updates and tells me the different number (i.e. I upped my monthly payment by $50, and would take 3 years and 6 months, and I'll save $37 in interest)

&#x200B;

I have another goal to build my emergency savings. I said I want to save $15k by the end of next year, and it tells me that I need to save $655/month, based on how much I already have saved in my designated account. If I change it to $500/month, it says that it will take until May 2021.
