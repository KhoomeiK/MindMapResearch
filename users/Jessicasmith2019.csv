The immature one of us, is the one making their opinion about disliking dogs an actual issue on a post clearly showing the interest of a dog."
aww,fdifz9f,t1_fdifrx8,1578442042.0,Maybe you've got a filthy ass hole and blame it on your dog when your mommy asks what the stains are.

Dogtraining,fcsyzpb,t3_eir1rr,1577928644.0,"It took me quite a bit of time with my pup. I essentially rescued him from my ex who was abusive towards him. 

While we were together, it was impossible to train him but when we left when he was probably 6 months old, it took me about 3 months to get him fully trained. 

Now when he pees its because he forgot he needed to pee or hes upset with us. 

I took him out religiously every two hours unless he was in his kennel. He doesnt poop in the house either. I feed him on a schedule do I mostly can estimate when he'll need to poop."

offmychest,fc79g5x,t1_fc6kb0o,1577501052.0,"That was one blessing in our story. We didnt have to do that awful invasive exam. But none the less we've had every kind of abuse in our family. We've been out a year now. Still not ""normal"" but healing."
offmychest,fc78x26,t1_fc74v5q,1577500646.0,This. This was my family. Still to some extent now.
