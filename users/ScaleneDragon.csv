space,ff37hmg,t1_ff35wr8,1579535521.0,"For the neptune photo it was taken at 4.4 mil miles away, 4 days away from closest approach and that's still a great picture. The moon is 240 thou miles at closest approach. You've blown me away with the Mars photo, better than any I've seen, if you don't think that's a detailed photo then we vehemently disagree about what makes a detailed photo.

NASA and ESA do have powerful telescopes, but most aren't used for taking pictures, but for detecting light, exoplanets, deep field views etc.

I do get what you mean now though, like why aren't the space agencies just pumping out high quality pictures all the time. I think the last lot of good images we got was from Cassini before Saturn ate it, so it could be down to convenience, whether there's a satellite close by etc.  e.g the Mars rover was pumping out images every day for its whole lifespan, literally thousands of images of the surface of mars from 2 feet away.

Also it could be lack of public interest, and just that astronomers and looking further afield now. Good job we have amateur astronomers to give us gems like these."
