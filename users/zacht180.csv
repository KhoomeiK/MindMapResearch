>killing another being is wrong

That's not what we as a species has concluded though, and one group can't necessarily be the arbitrator for what is or isn't wrong. I do think people here are right when they point out the criticism in his appeal to nature fallacy, I agree that part of his argument had obvious errors. The people who reply with, ""Well rape and murder and slavery was also considered natural or acceptable"" are also responding in fallacy and that doesn't directly address his statement. The majority of society has concluded that those things are inherently wrong through education, upbringing, legal systems, etc. There have been laws condemning those actions, slavery as an exception, since about 2100 BC. Though that's not very long in the scope of human history, the same can't be said for hunting. There is evidence that some of the first art in cave paintings and our need to communicate (gesturing and verbal) came from our dependence on hunting for food. I think there is some importance to note the vast differences and complexities in human relationships with themselves as a species versus human relationships with other animals. There is an incredibly stable paradigm here, but I am also not to say that it can't shift in the future and if that change will be warranted or not.

He's made other points during other interviews, podcasts, or events in defense of his hunting which are stronger especially in a modern context: conservation, sustainable food, health, relative affordability, charity, and the death of an animal by a hunter is far more humane, painless, and quick compared to how that animal would die otherwise (elsewhere in nature or in a factory farm). This one seemed to catch him by surprise, but ultimately like he said it boils down to what's a difference of world perspective. Vegans are doing what they feel is ethically and objectively right, and so are hunters. People who take those stances sincerely and with respect both have admiration from me and are measures more conscious than people who live off of processed meat products. I don't think either one could prove anything and I'm not sure that Steve or the other man really tried; I just think they shared information and it was nice to see how they did that."

>at the very least have someone help the victim reverse search the images

That's a good idea and I agree with you, but I'm not sure that the average beat cop is even familiar with reverse image searching. They should be in these circumstances, but it's important to note even a simple crop or change in image quality can make those unreliable."
RBI,ff2obph,t1_ff2mbzm,1579516142.0,"No, they *physically and in all objective terms* do not. Especially if you want them to do it within the scope of the law. I edited my comment to provide further information.

Unless OP clarifies, this is how it often plays out based on experience:

* Person probably isn't using a genuine cell phone number.
* We don't know who person is or could be.

There's literally nothing they can do aside take a statement, give you basic advice, wish you luck, and maybe drive through the neighborhood more frequently. That is a fact, I work in law enforcement and I'm very aware of how these reports can and can't be addressed.

Let's assume some things have changed, and OP may know who this person using a spoofed number is. Now, there may be someone here they can work with. So you're thinking, ""Go kick their door in and lock 'em up in county!"" Well, no. There's absolutely no evidence they can gather that would be able to get them charged with a crime, and no good judge would sign a warrant based on a person's hunch. But nothing stops the police from contacting the potential harasser, either by phone or in person, and giving them a stern talk. Almost 9/10 times, that solves the issue. You know how pigs are lying scum? This is one of the reasons. I say, ""Well, we do have reason to believe you're sending these messages. If this is the case and you don't stop you will get charged and arrested for harassment."" Big lie, but it works, the reporting party stops receiving unsolicited messages, and everyone claps.

Now let's assume that the person is about as intelligent as a fence post and is actually using their real phone number - it becomes a lot simpler. Person's identity can easily be verified using local records, social media, and one other program that I'm familiar with which sometimes works (think of it as a digital super-secret police version of a Yellow Pages book that's outdated by seven years or so). So there's enough evidence to actually do something. Generally speaking, you are in control of your communication through your cell phone and it's not a stretch to get PC with a sprinkle of minor details if we can link the phone to a person. They can probably be given a criminal warning or arrested. The process and specifics of the last part also depends on varying state and country laws."

I get that a lot of the teenagers on this site aren't fond of law enforcement, but real life is not an episode of CSI Miami, you wet doorknob. Very few police departments have ""entire divisions dedicated to helping in this exact situation"" and even if they did that doesn't mean much.

Edit to clarify and provide further: We don't even know exactly what the police did aside from the one thing that OP mentioned. And the answer is unfortunately that they can't do much. Phone numbers are incredibly easy to spoof, and even old burner phones from gas stations will cause huge problems for any investigation. I can guarantee you that anyone sending these messages nefariously, or even as a grotesque joke, has taken five minutes to protect their identity. Your local donut shop isn't the NSA and they don't have open-line access to a mobile provider's database, and getting an affidavit to subpoena isn't simple - and this can't even apply if the cell phone number is being spoofed. An active trace requires exigent circumstances and cooperation with the service provider, you may *feel* that this is an emergent circumstance but legally it is not. A harassing text message from an unknown person does not put anyone in imminent danger.

So we get it, you've watched too much Criminal Minds and now you can't cope with the idea that the police really don't have fictional cybercrime abilities and they're incapable of solving the world's problems like they are on the TV shows. This is also why fraud via the internet and identity theft are tricky problems. If OP's friend knows who this person might be, then they might have more to go off of. But I don't know. They'll likely just take info to start a paper trail, offer simple advice, and increase checks at said person's residence."

Continue to Table 3 if you'd like. I mean this with zero prejudice and it's unfortunate that it's a truth - juveniles and the United States in general, especially among the black population, are responsible for a major disproportionate amount of gun violence throughout the country. The reason young black kids are getting shot by police is dependent on more than a single factor, and one of them is far more representative of a larger problem (hint: it's not necessarily the police).

With the exception of some minor weapon regulations, that was it. No quick kill or consecutive harvest gimmick. A trophy buck with a 256 B&C score was just that, same with a 24.2 pheasant. It doesn't matter necessarily what happened before or after the shot, as long as it's dead it's dead. The trophy score in COTW is generally the same but the added game score which emohasized none, bronze, silver, gold, diamond and the way it was calculated seems confusing to a lot of new players.

I know it's just preference, though. I was always personally of the opinion that COTW wasn't necessarily meant to be Classic 2.0, and I'm not sure if it should be.

Bad police shootings do happen, but the leading denominator is and always will be gun violence in general which gets crossed over into policing.

I'm agreeing with you, you silly scone. I got that fancy white privilege in my back pocket with my wallet. But guess what, lad? So do most Redditors. Like 60-70% of us according to polls. We're statistically mostly composed of cisgendered white males from middle class families, and college educated or currently in school. So yes, we can easily avoid crime in many otherwise crime stricken cities. This ain't it, chief. Thanks for proving my point and wasting both of our times."

JusticeServed,fcm6v15,t1_fcm66wu,1577765766.0,"Doesn't work that way. It's usually concentrated in certain parts of a city, even cities that have notably high crime rates.

1. Not be poor or a junkie
2. Not live or hang out in poor or junkie areas
3. Notice how you avoid crime comparative to everyone else

There are some decent places to live in New Orleans where crime isn't much a concern if you're there, though statistically certain pockets of the city elsewhere make it seem like you'll immediately gate raped and shot the instant you step outside. You'll get those smaller places like East St. Louis and Gary, IN where you're probably more correct."

IsItBullshit,fcjlvmv,t1_fcierhl,1577693056.0,"A lot of Redditors really like to misrepresent this. There was one police department in Connecticut that rejected an applicant for having a higher IQ in 1999.

[https://abcnews.go.com/US/court-oks-barring-high-iqs-cops/story?id=95836](https://abcnews.go.com/US/court-oks-barring-high-iqs-cops/story?id=95836)

That's it, a single PD out of a dozen thousand police agencies in the United States. That's hardly indicative of a normality. It's an outlier. And contrary to what a lot of the teenagers on the internet think, statistically speaking police officers actually have higher IQs than normal - and that's before the modern era where police departments are generally increasing hiring standards and starting to require formal education.

You're correct in your other comment about the mundane aspect of the job, it's not rocket science. It's an anecdote so take it at face value, but every police department I'm familiar with don't doesn't test IQ, and they don't need to. There's police entrance exams which measure skills in appropriate topics which are relevant to the job: law, writing, reading, verbal communication and language, procedure, basic math, multitasking, memory, etc. That along with panel interviews and the rest of the applicant's background/prior work experience is the primary deciding factor of hired or not hired."

The jacket, sunglasses, and the way he hunkers down a bit while stuffing the loot and fleeing looks like some cartoonish *Swiper, No Swiping!* silly shit.

gunpolitics,fcgm4p9,t1_fcghf6y,1577641634.0,"It's also interesting to look at types of crime being committed, as well. For example, we can all agree that Native Americans were treated objectively worse than black Americans. Practically exterminated. They tend to have much higher (by a factor of two) general violent crime rates per capita when compared to black Americans, but the rate of murder among blacks is still 5x the amount than that of Native Americans. This is analyzed using victim counts, so it's measured independent of arrest rates.

Let me tell you, I live in Dayton. It's fucking trash here. A lot of urban violence and the communities affected by this seem to ignore and embrace it. We are [placed at #7 in the entire country for homicide rates per capita.](https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/murder-map-deadliest-u-s-cities/60/) To make things even more confusing, we had one of the better police departments around and cities from all over the state model Dayton's community-orientated policing and training/hiring standards. Without a willing and cooperative populace who aren't afraid to testify against criminals, it means nothing. Years ago, the [DOJ forced the department to lower testing standards so that they could hire more minorities.](https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-releases/doj-pressured-city-of-dayton-to-lower-testing-standards-for-police-recruits-to-accommodate-minority-candidates/) They still do a good job for the most part, but quality has definitely been declining. It's important to note that historically we are also one of the most segregated cities in the United States, and our public education is like a wet door knob. A few years ago, our county was the nation's leader for opioid and fentanyl related overdoses, the capital of the country! We [actually ran out of room in our morgue.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/us/ohio-overdose-deaths-coroners-office.html)  But hey, we have great history, heroin, and craft beer! At least we invented the airplane and cash register. In reality living here is just okay and like in any other city, you can easily avoid crime if you're not buying or selling drugs and there's some things to do that are pretty cool. Cost of living is amazing, too. Daytonians love talking shit about Dayton, though."

For what it's worth we're a smaller department of about 30 full timers and a handful of part timers. Shift minimums are flexed here.
