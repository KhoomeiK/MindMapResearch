I moved from a diversified hood, that always votes blue to the red shit stain of entitled rich white people.  I am your people.  I am trying to change this shit.  Unfortunately the broke ass white people who got fucked by nafta and shit are turning red.  So it's now a two way battle.  Fight the racist rich or fight the broke ass racist white people.  I am trying but yo"

I have a condition that makes me suicidal regularly.  It sucks.  But I would never hurt anyone intentionally, especially mentally.  I would have never realized that an engineer would even realize that they ran someone over. 

I don't know how to add pictures but I can safely say that I am literally 20 yards away from the switch.  It's cold right now and the propane heaters are running.  Sorry about your friend. ♥️

It really doesn't matter who is doing it, conservatives, establishment dems, Trump himself.  What matters is that we see right through it, and speak to such effect."

I have even been suicidal and sat on the tracks waiting.  My father was an engineer, my uncle was an engineer but I have never heard these stories.  After hearing these stories, next time I am suicidal, I will stay away from the tracks."

Uh no.  I think you are forgetting the story.   They came in and got destroyed by us.  Like literally dead, all of them.  It was a pen test by them and they got wiped."
todayilearned,fcii9j4,t1_fchpos3,1577662991.0,"Story time.  

My great grandmother was that person.  She owned the hotel across from the White house, and a bunch of land down in Florida.  To be more exact, the land where the Magic Kingdom and parking lot is located.  

My great grandmother was an amazing person.  She fostered over 80 kids.  She was married, at one point, to Mikhail Gorbachev's brother or cousin or some shit.  Had the same birth mark shit on his head.  She had 7 different husbands, that all died before her, except the last one of course.  She only had one natural child, my grandfather.  

She was a fucking hell of a lady.  She raised chickens near Indianapolis in her retirement.  I had the fortunate experience of being able to stay with her for a week or two every summer when I was super little.  

Anyhow, when she passed away, me being like super far on the total pole of inheritance (grand kids, great grandkids, fosters, charity etc), I still got a few grand.  

But yeah, she argued with disney for a minute about selling her land because she wanted to retire in FL eventually.  He made her an offer she couldn't refuse, so she took it.  I'm sure if you went back into the records for the hotel you could find her name as an owner.  Sorry I don't have proof, she died in the 90's, and her pictures went with her last husband.  But those pictures were fucking historical."
