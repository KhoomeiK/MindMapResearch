news,ffa7ouk,t3_erk5dn,1579729492.0,"I most certainly do agree with your advice but the risk was absolutely worth it in my case. I’ve already been diagnosed and have tried numerous pills and have funded my ketamine IV therapy. I most certainly wouldn’t be taking mdma on my own if there was anything else for me. But the truth of the matter is that because US health system is a joke/scam it’s leaving a insane amount of people going without.

I’ve work very hard through my trauma, seen how it effects me, learned my triggers, and in general am very active in trying to maintain my mental health so when taking mdma I follow the maps mdma therapy guide, once a month for the first 3 months then once every 3 months. I’ve taken  one so far and for the first time in years and years and years I’ve been able to function somewhat. I haven’t been suicidal and have been able to work through my daily emotions. Obviously nothing is a fix all pill but it has improved the quality of my life and my family. The stability I can offer to them now is an unbelievable feeling!"

It also seems very shallow and shows you care more about appearances than people themselves, which is okay to and extent but like this hard height rules, it’s shallow. It’s no wonder why so many people are struggling when dating."
help,ff5s3ut,t3_ermdaj,1579608118.0,"Hi! I’m one of the people who would post stuff like that. I do have a lot of mental health issues and finding a effective treatment has been a looooong painful experience. I would have suicidal ideations, a daily problem,and some of those really bad days I would post saying my intentions.

When I posted I never really cared what people responded to me, no amount of talking could fix my issues but what people responding did was distract me long enough to go to sleep and let the darkest of feelings pass.

I’ll be honest, when I posted about wanting to die, I was 💯 serious but like most suicidal people, you find yourself In that place thousands of times, over and over again.Only difference for the people who succeeded at killing them selves is that they lost that battle ONCE but won so many other countless ones.

If you run across any post like these try to get them talking about their issues, get them to explain and refocus off active planning but know you can’t fix anyone. 

You’re a really kind person Op :) Take care!"

I’m very glad to see you pointed out it’s not his fault but I just wanna say girls won’t eventually overlook that problem... He will find a girl who it’s mentally stable and intelligent enough to see height was never a problem from the start. 

Just throwing this stuff out there to combat the girls who squawk about height being #1. Not all of us girls are like that. A lot of us do actually care about real traits, jobs and such and don’t expect people to change things they can’t."

I’m not going to go and say he’s a horrible guy but maybe he is struggling with the change from the baby, and of course it can be stressful hanging out with a cptsd survivor. Maybe I’ve needs to start managing his stress better..idk???

MDMA,fddp0aj,t1_fddkxeb,1578320029.0,"Yes, no matter what, I will be on sort of medication for the rest of my life. Not Necessarily mdma, obviously I’m experimenting due to nothing else working and lack of access but regardless I will be on some sort of medication. It’s 100% unavoidable. Me without anything isn’t functional and my brain PHYSICALLY does not work properly. 

The notion that I can some will myself, workout, eat right and that if I just DID enough I wouldn’t be like this isn’t true. I work endlessly on writing in my journal, trying to draw, I workout everyday, and don’t eat junk food, stare at myself in the mirror and work on finding something I can love about myself and follow a schedule, I trust what my current doctor says and follow her advice. I fight every fucking day to live and try to make progress while my brain fights it.

Not to mention the fact the US health care system is joke and the mental health care is next to nothing.  Shrooms, mdma, weed, lsd and so much more have been study and proven to help some people. Just like how I paid $3000  out of pocket for ketamine infusion therapy, I’d be paying any doctor out the ass to test on me just to see if it could help. 

So yes, I do medication and help for the rest of the life. The best I can ever hope for is a small pause in the hate machine in my head but it will always come back and I’ll always have to fight it.

*edit also of course it won’t FIX me, the notion any medication prescribed or self Administered would be insane. I’m farrrr past that mind set. I mearly happy to feel something I haven’t felt in a long time. Something I thought was lost to me."

Though it was an odd experience! *For my come down I’m using marijuana and kratom. (Been using these anyway, and my doctor is good with it)*


What I’m following is MAPS mdma therapy guideline, 3 sessions one month apart, then 3 months apart. I’m sure this is relevant but the reason I’m turning to mdma is because I’ve been in the mist of a very bad cptsd ‘eposide’ and I’m not able to get to my ketamine clinic for a booster (crashed my only car on Christmas Eve) which would have helped but I seem to have a natural tolerance to ketamine and haven’t disassociated at 200IV...which my doctor says is verrrry important :(

So yea, my mind isn’t nerutypical, and I’m having some severe issues right now. I guess juts throwing  this info out there as to explain the situation more.

I’d always say shit like ‘Hmpf! Men! Of course!!!’ And would be so quick to the draw with  accusations of cheating. Always. Always. Always on my mind that I could be getting cheated on. I couldn’t, I wouldn’t let myself trust someone because I knew what pain I’d have.

It even effected how I picked men to date! I would unknowingly pick men who were likely to cheat and be cruel. It took me a long time and meeting my now husband to work through a lot of. ( it was BAD when I was first with my husband, fights nonstop because of my trauma)
