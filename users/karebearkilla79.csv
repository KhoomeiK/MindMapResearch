BorderlinePDisorder,ffcpeab,t1_ffcn0pz,1579804385.0,I think that’s the smartest option at this point
BorderlinePDisorder,ffcmquk,t1_ffclm49,1579802751.0,"Well in this case, there is a lone between supportive and helpful and being blown off and putting yourself in harms way. If she’s using hurtful or harsh words, false accusations etc.. that’s toxic and you don’t deserve that. You don’t need to put yourself in an unhealthy situation (to where you’re suffering emotionally) in order to help someone get to a better place. In our case, there was no toxicity. I never verbalized my thoughts to him lol thank god. You’ve done a lot it seems. Especially taking time to research etc. I’m imagining she will only take it as you either brushing all the problems in your relationship off in her and a mental condition or you seeing a flaw in her. Neither of which will go well. 

She will have to take it from here and sadly that means you’ll have to step away. I would just let her know that while you feel it’s best to end things, you care for her and hope she can get things figured out one day.. let her know that you’ll be there if she does but not at the risk of yourself"
BorderlinePDisorder,ffcm4h1,t1_ffckln1,1579802370.0,"Hmm. My bf is 37 too lol I just turned 40 in November. I became aware of BPD in my earlier 30’s but brushed it off because of the stigma. I was offended at the mention. When I kept depriving myself of being loved.. I really started to dig on my own. I saw so much of myself I couldn’t ignore anymore. About 36. I tried to do the self help and DBT books at home but it wasn’t working. Like I said at 38 I went in and asked for help. But I had a long history of failed relationships, both friends and lovers. Also jobs. I was hurt during a deployment overseas while in the military and then retired and it was a huge trigger because it was the only job that I felt loved me as much as I loved it lol somehow I felt this was abandonment ?? Really just a block on my path to getting help. I get sad sometimes that I lost my life to this and think about what-if’s.. but I really just didn’t know. I truly thought I just drew in shitty people. (Kinda did sometimes because I had no self esteem and secretly wanted to be treated like shit) Is she aware of these issues? Or does she blame them elsewhere still? She is at a crucial age in my opinion. Like.. get it figured out now or just commit to a life of disfunction."
BorderlinePDisorder,ffckaus,t1_ffch76d,1579801270.0,"I am also interested in this. It seems to me that B seems to be more exclusively female while N male though obviously it can be swapped. I feel like this is where the problem lies. People assume because they are a specific gender, they are most likely N or B. Also that they can overlap. That’s not even taking into consideration other factors such bi-polar disorder or depression. Which puts a whole different spin on it. A bi polar person that is in medicated, also suffering from BPD is going to present much worse. A person with CPTSD is going to have BPD traits as a result which may or may not go away with time and treatment. I really feel the DSM is in need of a serious overhaul. Also the sociopath/psychopath/narc terms get thrown around wayyyyy to easy these days"
BorderlinePDisorder,ffcjv2k,t1_ffcfyqn,1579801006.0,I can see that. Emotions override logic sometimes. Is she young?
BorderlinePDisorder,ffcjrct,t1_ffcfhwk,1579800945.0,"Thank you! It was definitely a moment in my life that I’m proud of and a turning point. Unfortunately, I was 38 before I got help. I am now 40 but 39 is the new 40 right lol I am sorry to hear your struggles but it’s good if both partners can reflect on how they can better themselves for each other. I always tell my boyfriend that I owe him the moon and the stars because I’ll never understand why he put himself through the risks for me. Three years he kept trying and I am so grateful because I feel safe and secure with someone for the first time in my life. That is CONSTANT thing for us to keep an eye on though because with a few repeated mishaps, it could relapse. 

I think it may be hard to look back and say shoulda, coulda.. I’m happy to hear that you’re trying to understand the condition. The fact that you’re in both groups says a lot, I wish she could know that. But does she know her diagnosis herself? I may have missed that somewhere. My bf first just focused on making sure no matter what that I knew he wasn’t going anywhere, which I could not believe. But I’m telling you he just wouldn’t give up. He would take the push away and learned to give me my space so as not to push me more but never got mad or threw it in my face. Sometimes I want to cry when I think about how hard it must have been for him at times. He probably shouldn’t have tried so much and I’m sure a lot of people would have advised him to walk away from me. I’m just happy he saw something in me that was worth it. 

It is true that it takes two to tango. Even if she has this disorder, there is always a way to adapt, as for the knee jerk triggers.. I can tell you it is a deeply embedded protective mechanism. Anytime I got the faintest hint that he might not be who he said he was, BOOM.. my whole brain would switch gears. I had zero control over this. Seeing his text messages would irritate me. I couldn’t stand the sight of them. Not even jn am angry way like people get when they’re hurt in love. Just like. “He is NOT the one for you and don’t even read what he has to say”.. If he was supposed to come over and cook me dinner (what a rude thing right? He’s cooking me dinner!) but if was coming and he was late.. I would get irritated.. like he had no respect for my time.. “what an irresponsible person.. “ “it’s going to be almost 8 before we eat. “ “Who does that?!” “I can’t be with someone like that..” “I’m going to hurt him because I can’t be with someone like that.” “I don’t want to waste his time because I can’t see myself as his wife when he doesn’t understand that dinner has be at this time because my son has a bedtime.” “he just made fun of my chicken legs.. so, I’m going to spare him now and just cut it off. “ I’m doing him a favor..” Then boom.. I ghost for a few days.. tell him I’m overwhelmed and again that he’s wasting his time on me and then just disappear. He’d say.. “Ok well.. I’m here if you change your mind” then check in on me in a few weeks or days depending on bad I had gotten. That is insane to me that I thought so far down the road enough to talk myself out of even talking to him again.. over a damn dinner that he was an hour late on.. this is the mind of a splitter. I would just get overwhelmed. Couldn’t breathe. Freak out. I didn’t trust myself not to act or say something stupid so I just learned to cut everyone out. It was easier. I didn’t have the coping skills to have a normal “argument” or disagreement” and not let it crush me. Let it be constructive. I couldn’t take the slightest jab because it would send me in a spiral. I had to learn skills. I had to do role play in group. I had homework every week. I have to repeat things in my head so when something comes up, I can catch myself. When you don’t have coping skills, you either lash out and hurt the ones you love with words or shitty actions or you shut down and run to protect yourself."
BorderlinePDisorder,ffcev06,t1_ffcbajy,1579797954.0,"And as for the the patterns you’re referring to as far everyone dating the same person.. It’s Iike the narcissists playbook. That’s pretty crazy too. I guess all PD have similarities. That being said, I have seen a lot of women play the victim and accuse men of being terrible narcissists, when really, they were just very confrontational, instigating and severely lacking self esteem."
BorderlinePDisorder,ffce9vx,t1_ffcbajy,1579797591.0,"I think there’s a spectrum with BPD just like anything. Some of the behaviors you mentioned are things I would NEVER do. But I was an internalizing one. I should say am but I have sought treatment and things in my life have changed drastically. The only people I ever really hurt in my life was myself. The people that I have hurt, I hurt them because they did something small, triggered me, I split and cut them off coldly either for months or forever. 

I got to a point where I was completely self aware. I had serious commitment issues. I was petrified of being hurt again by my own actions. I knew what I was doing by pushing people away but no matter what, I couldn’t fix the deeply imbedded process in my brain. That was horrible and took me a few years between trying to fix myself and finally seeking therapy. I was afraid to start therapy because I didn’t want to rip bandaids off of old wounds.

DBT was probably the best thing I ever did for myself but it was a LOT of work. It is constant work. I have had a guy that tried for years to date me and I just would allow him close and then push him away. Never being mean but just letting him in enough, only to freak out and cut him off. He never gave up. When I started therapy I told him and he was very supportive, I figured if anyone deserved a shot at a relationship it was him and after a little time in, I started dating him. He was the best man I’ve ever had in my life. My problem was that I thought I was fixed and stopped going. I ended up having a dissociative episode and broke up with him over something that I was wrong about. I didn’t talk to him for over 4 months. Then I found out how wrong I was, all because I dissociated and couldn’t read. We are trying again and he is very patient and loving with me. He knows all about the disorder as well as my childhood and why I’m this way. He knows me so well that he can tell by the tone of my voice when I’m about to have a moment, even before I know. He is incredible about knowing how to calm and diffuse me before it ever escalates. BUT he also knows that I know I have a problem, that I’m seeking help and always able to admit when I’m wrong. He’s not perfect but he’s perfect for me and believe it or not, he says I’m perfect for him lol I don’t blame him.. lol when I’m not triggered, I’m a pretty bad ass chick.. (narc joke)"
BorderlinePDisorder,ffc9tir,t1_ffc9f00,1579794803.0,"I agree with your last statement and I understand some of your points. But to be honest, reading that letter, I see NPD. I think a lot of them are confusing us or arm chair diagnosing is. Cluster B’s can overlap or be confused. I do understand your original points though. Still I see no love or desire to help there. I don’t see it anywhere really."
NarcissisticAbuse,ffc6j1f,t1_ffc6cdj,1579792687.0,"Before you diagnose her as a narcissist. IF she were to come back and talk to you, apologize and explain she overreacted. I would hope you thought about all of the possible diagnoses and whether or not you would consider helping her through it."
NarcissisticAbuse,ffc5wmx,t1_ffc5lrp,1579792271.0,"I’m sorry you’re dealing with this and like I said, no one deserves to be made to feel this way. You could drive yourself crazy trying to figure out the why’s. It’s the same when dealing with the aftermath of a narc. I’m just hoping this can help you consider all possibilities before making a final call because most likely she will come back from her mind set. I wish you luck"
NarcissisticAbuse,ffc5d6w,t1_ffc3cnm,1579791907.0,"I will say as a caveat to that article, they are known for risky behaviors and sexual promiscuity, hyper sexuality etc. filling voids and seeking validation however they can. These points are more of a starting than an exact outline."
NarcissisticAbuse,ffc4zi9,t1_ffc3cnm,1579791654.0,"Sounds to me like you were both looking for the other to fill a void, both emotionally unavailable. Neither of which is healthy. It was probably a perceived attack on her end. They are often self loathing so it would be easy for her to think they hated her or didn’t want her there. The flying off the handle come with the territory. I think at this point, whether she is or is not Borderline is irrelevant, the question is, are you willing to stay? She will push and push to test you to see if you will leave so it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. It’s very sad. No one deserves the stress or feelings you have so her problems aren’t yours to fix. Unless she is willing to get help and you care for her enough to stay with her through it, I think you’re wasting your time trying to diagnose her.

NarcissisticAbuse,ffc2fdi,t1_ffc1tsh,1579789847.0,"Well.. She was testing you and also telling you lol and you didn’t run. Why did you stay? Did those behaviors set off alarm bell back then? You may be what BPD’s call their FP (favorite person) and again they are not all wicked bitches. Being late could have easily triggered an abandonment issue with her and boom! Once they are triggered they can’t help it. You were late. To her, maybe you weren’t coming. May sound dumb to you or even bitchy but, if she is truly offering with this, it is very real in her head. Given the other behaviors you mentioned.. I see it as a strong possibility. I asked in the beginning why you stayed with the odd behavior because I want to ask if you could stay now? Knowing that might be an issue, if she acknowledged and got help?"
AskWomen,ffc1zqw,t3_eshjan,1579789525.0,Knowing my worth and sticking to it. So much so that I turned down a job that was a dream that just fell out of the sky. The salary was a huge low ball offer. I didn’t need the job or the money but man I wanted to jump on it. He convinced me that I was worth twice what they were offering and if they didn’t counter offer it was their loss. That I knew how much of myself I’d throw into the job and what I’d be bringing to their table.. I declined their offer and let the job go. I don’t regret it all. I am proud that I stood up for myself. I would have been running crazy for half of what I was worth.
NarcissisticAbuse,ffc1c1a,t1_ffc05he,1579789031.0,"If she has BPD, that is called splitting and she probably can’t help it. It can be changed with dialectical behavior or cognitive behavioral therapy. She may be suffering from more than one personality disorder. But shutting off feelings one minute and then going back to overwhelming feelings of love or lovebombing  the next can also be the black and white reactions from splitting. That love bomb comes from fear of abandonment and trying to fix their fuck up not because they’re trying to manipulate you. At least not consciously for them."
NarcissisticAbuse,ffc10uk,t3_esrmai,1579788794.0,"It sounds like she may be borderline personality disorder. And yes, they can be loved/lovable. They can get better with therapy. They are often just adults that were very hurt as children. Be careful with the internet because you will find a lot of scorned lovers vilifying them and some “pseudo-psych internet docs” filling you with misinformation. I suggest really doing some unbiased research in the condition and see how much of it resonates with you in regards to your girlfriend."
Borderline,ffbxtlq,t1_ffbnguh,1579786225.0,That’s the exact combo I’m on. It’s been the sweet spot for me.
Borderline,ffbxpzj,t3_esork6,1579786139.0,I have both. I have been on lamotrigene/lamictal for my Bi polar for the last 6 years. It was a lightbulb med for me. I have had to increase over the years but that’s it. Once in awhile I take a depression dive and we add on the Wellbutrin. She’s cautious with that because it can induce mania. My meds pretty much make manic episodes non existent. The only help for BPD is DBT or CBT.

EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE GUYS CHEATED! I was so disgusted. He confessed to relieve himself.. or something bigger is going to come out and he’s just laying the ground work for the windfall. I’m sorry this happened to you. As far as I see it, it’s one of those things, when the opportunity presents itself and they think you’ll never find out.. its 75% likely to happen.

NarcissisticAbuse,ff6nh75,t1_ff6my0b,1579630951.0,"I have completely ignored or just blocked/airplane mode/DND mode someone because I couldn’t handle it. I felt like the slightest bit of response would start a dialogue which would lead to any type of explanation, conversation etc.. that I wasn’t ready to have. This was literally my thought process. If they ask me what’s wrong and do I just need time, then I have to say yes, I need time because x,y,z, maybe not even that.. then I can’t even say how much time I need. Any sort of contact could send me into an anxiety attack because I couldn’t decipher my own emotions and I knew there was a high probability that I had just split. I know narcs don’t see it like that because they probably don’t split or think they do. But I just wonder how many people think I was being abusive to them because I would completely go silent like this. Especially when I got hurt or mad. I would just hang up the phone instantly or just not return a call/message and go into my phase. It wasn’t my intent. I do realize that it is used that way.

The splitting and dissociation. I have made a lot of progress and I know that I have so much good to offer. It’s just even though I knew I was very unstable in my earlier years, I didn’t realize how it looked to everyone else. I literally did what she did. Lol just so much of her. I don’t conduct myself that way anymore so I look at her and say “wow” “she’s insane” I hate to say that because she was me! I can empathize. I knew that I had so many failed relationships with friends and lovers. I just didn’t understand fully how it looked from the outside. I know this is just a tv show but still. I just turned 40 in November. I didn’t really grasp this until my last few years in my 30’s.

This is the most amazing relationship I’ve had my entire life and he was a good friend before this happened.

Anyway, a bit into living together things got hard for me. Sex life was only weekly. He treats me like a queen so I was so confused. It ended up coming out that he had a porn /masturbation addiction. He said that it just started with normal porn and progressively changed until it got to all he watched was gay porn. He was masturbating several times a day. Here I thought he was cheating.. Anyway, I broke things off for a bit and then agreed on therapy. He openly admits that he was confused. He said that he had set up a Grindr in the past but didn’t go through with anything. Went out with a gay friend one time but didn’t feel anything g and couldn’t go through with anything. He says he doesn’t know what it is that makes him get off with the gay porn but maybe the penetration. He said he has zero interest romantically in men and cringes at the kissing and intimate parts. I am very open sexually and have tried pegging and he is very hesitant, he even swears he is not bi. He is wanting children very badly and always talks about marriage. His therapist knows all about his porn addiction and since he stopped our sex life has gotten much better. He still treats me like a princess. This is the best relationship I’ve ever had. I just need to understand if you can truly just get turned on that much by all dick and not be gay. I’m afraid. I personally LOVE gay porn but he says it’s different for me.

BorderlinePDisorder,femqivk,t3_epqzf5,1579266660.0,"There are several good skills that I have taken away from DBT which have helped build and maintain healthier relationships in my life, I always recommend the therapy because you can use them when you see fit. They do have a critical event step sheet but it takes practice and often it only works after the episode or when you’re anticipating the encounter, what I’ve discovered is that depending on how far back your trauma goes, the dissociation is less and less controllable in high stress situations. I learned to catch myself sometimes but I personally will never be able to stop those MOMENTS. The ones that shake you.. I guess now, the length of time I stay in the state has shortened? I just fight using my skills because yes, they caused me more personal pain. It seems like it just makes everyone else around me feel better.. 

As for you opening wounds, a good therapist will never push you to an area you’re not ready for. I was afraid to start for the same reasons. We barely even touched on the childhood stuff for a long while in until it started to relate directly to an event we were currently working out in a session. You will lead your time with them and you will discuss what you want. If that’s not happening, you need a different therapist. With the DBT, it’s not about your past at all, just patterns of behavior and current reactions to your environment. It teaches skills and behavior awareness. It is hard work if you do it right because it forces you out of your comfort zone (opposite action) and you have to do homework. Also repetitive.. behavior chain analysis which sometimes can be two full written pages depending on what happened. The thing is, once you start getting and seeing positive results, it’s easier to continue. When the big ones hit though.."

NarcissisticAbuse,femm6ew,t3_eptcve,1579262230.0,"I always like to hear when people are able get a complete closure with validation like this. I know sometimes it can trigger c-ptsd but I believe after the fact it is very healing. Also, whether the new gf takes this info and does anything for herself with it yet remains to be seen. You know it takes approximately 7 attempts for someone to leave their abuser before they’re successful. This may have been the first real big push out the door for her. It took a lot of courage for you to do what you just did. Even though I wasn’t even involved, thank you for helping that girl. If it were me and I was desperate enough to reach out to you, it’s because I really needed help."
BorderlinePDisorder,felimfq,t1_feli5dd,1579223065.0,"That is typical I guess with this condition. It’s hard keeping a steady group of strong friends, I’m sorry. It took me a long time to find a solid group and we still have issues every so often, I’m just very open about my issues and they all help work with it. Sometimes they get flustered but they know. Have you been open with them? Do they know the condition or have they made an effort to understand?"

BorderlinePDisorder,felgzga,t1_fecg0c0,1579221945.0,"This. When I first started my relationship, I was petrified and in DBT as well one on one therapy. He was my first after 7 years because I was so afraid of being hurt, anyway, I told her the moment i realized I had fallen for him, he left my apartment after spending the whole weekend, I fell to the floor in my bathroom and bawled my eyes out. I knew I was screwed. I was vulnerable and if he hurt me or it failed, it would destroy me. Those were my exact words, she pointed that out to me and we worked through how I had been without him and that losing someone doesn’t mean I will die. But that’s how I equated it, I am still paralyzed with fear sometimes, but I know that I will go on and have another happy story again even if he’s not in it,"
BorderlinePDisorder,felglyj,t3_eof017,1579221699.0,"DBT. It helped me a lot but I still have underlying abandonment issues. It takes a lot of strength for a non DSM diagnosed individual to handle being told that someone they’re love is considering leaving them. Some days you can take it in the chin, breathe and come out with no big incidents. Some days it gets the better of you, you suffer, they suffer and you both learn. This is life and anyone who wants to love you had to accept that. And WE ARE AMAZING PEOPLE TO LOVE as well to be loved by."
BorderlinePDisorder,felflvx,t3_eopelr,1579221024.0,"I never answer that part honestly. For me I just don’t see the point. I know I’m either going to do it or I’m not. I had one very bad attempt and I was in the hospital for quite awhile. If I ever bothered again, it will definitely not be unsuccessful. I know my moods. I know my constant thoughts of just wanting to die. I know the only reason I’m here is because I can’t leave my children knowing their mom killed herself.. So tell my therapist for her to have me baker acted? No medication they have put me on has ever helped me with that. It comes and goes, when it’s really, really time to be concerned, no one is going to know a thing for sure, I use my therapist to help me work on the reasons I want to live,,"
BorderlinePDisorder,fel690k,t3_epbeo4,1579214949.0,"I’m just starting Wellbutrin and it really makes me tired. I am also bi polar so I’m on lamotrigone for that. The Wellbutrin is just because I’ve recently had a very rough bout of depression. As far as I know, the only real treatment for BPD is DBT or CBT. I did about a year of DBT and hit a plateau. I need to go back. I think you might benefit from anxiety meds maybe since that seems to be what spikes our episodes or splitting or dissociation."
BorderlinePDisorder,fel5ww3,t3_ep7xhp,1579214744.0,"For me, depending on the person, that’s how I split. It also gets longer as I know the person longer. I split and sometimes it will be 6 months before I can even think about speaking to them again. Suddenly a cloud lifts and I’m like. “Hey.. I miss them.. I can totally talk to them and not want to rip their face off or bawl my eyes out”"

NarcissisticAbuse,fel4rrd,t3_epoeq4,1579214043.0,"I remember when my ex narc used my belongings as a tactic.. I was so thrilled that he gave them back. Two bags that I had carried in my back most of the time I was jn Iraq.. ironically, the other very sentimental item never was “discovered”... The story about the night I got my bags is hilarious but that’s not for this thread. I imagine he’ll message me one day out of the blue because he magically found the last few things.. 2 years later.. lol I remember being so grateful that he had a moment of break through and didn’t keep my things from my deployment.. what a joke"

AskWomen,feeg8mv,t1_fecs3y8,1579033126.0,"Omgosh yes!!! I had an emergency and ended up with one at 35. I was single and devastated. I thought my life was over. Surprisingly, there was not a shortage of men with no problem dating me lol that being said, it was VERY hard to feel attractive at all in anything. I had to find the right bag that didn’t make the crinkle sound. It had to be right after I did a complete change out. I was only intimate one time while I had the bag and it was honestly terrifying. It also made me play up all my other features since I had so much else covered. My issue now is dealing with all the scars left behind. This is still a very sensitive thing for me so I am learning how to be fully nude and not embarrassed in front of someone again. At this point, it’s as simple as having my hair and make up done. Freshly lotioned after a day at the beach. A camisole covering my stomach and boobs out lol"

She stayed in the hospital with me by the port we were at for almost 5 days. Sleeping in the little chair/couch they had, facing me always so she could monitor me.

Call what you want, feel how you wanna feel about it. Sometimes I do like to see just how low a persons character will go so letting them lie and convict elaborate schemes can be entertaining lol it also helps to confirm what a big piece of shit you’re dealing with.. you know, just in case you were in the fence at all. Seeing someone’s face after they’ve not only just been caught red handed but also lied their ass off in some ridiculous way on top of it.. welcome to dead to me ville."

The military is also a culture built around drinking so.. I still haven’t decided if taking the VA’s pills for anxiety are better for me than taking a shit before I have to go deal with the public.. at least with taking a shot or having a drink I don’t have to be constantly under the influence. It’s a fine line though because your tolerance level builds etc etc.. I’m sure you’re discovering all this as have I. Still not ready to tell the VA"

AskMen,fdrl1kk,t1_fdrbzv6,1578686036.0,"Lol ok. If I say answer a question for me, because I want to see if they can actually be honest with me, that’s an issue? When I already know the truth? Who said the issue was make or break? Trust is key. I can work with the truth, I can’t work with a lie... so yes, it’s crucial to give a person enough rope when you’re really trying to confirm their character. Who says a mature conversation won’t happen when said person answers the question honestly? Who says the question when lied about doesn’t then become the deal breaker? That being said, depending on the nature of the issue, there may not even be a need to ask the question. If it’s a deal breaker for me regardless, there’s no point. Leave the proof on the counter on your way out without saying a word.. That takes maturity."

I’m a lot older now and don’t feel I should have to prompt my boyfriend to not lie when I ask him a question. If he needs coaching on that, he’s not for me. I can ask him point blank, having all the proof I need and let him answer with a lie or not. I make my decisions from there. Never show your hand before it’s your turn to play"
