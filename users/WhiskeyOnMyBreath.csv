pizzahut,ffboso1,t1_ffbc3wk,1579776196.0,"The extra large all meat pizzas in the deli section at Wal-Mart are $8 each and I think are in the 54oz range. They're thick, heavy, and have a ton of toppings on them. Not the most flavorable pizzas but we like them in our household and will dress them up with extra cheese etc.   

I ordered 3 large from Pizza Hut last night using the 50% off sale. Without the coupon my 2 Meat Lover's and 1 Super Supreme (all w/Stuffed Crust) were around $65 delivered, not including tip, and I'm less than a mile from the PH. Tipping would have made *just three pizzas* come to over $70. The pricing has got to be hurting PH and other large chains. I can't understand how it couldn't be."

Seriously--just pause it about halfway and look at her. Is it burning her lips? I don't think I've ever squinted and grimaced when taking a bite, no matter how hot it was. Is she supposed to be looking ""fierce"" or something? She looks like someone punched her in the stomach as she bit down."
transformers,ffavjyp,t1_ffari78,1579745485.0,"Two different scenes. Sam and co. go to Washington, D.C. to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. They awaken Jetfire, who goes crazy and bursts through the hangar door into open desert. The film quite clearly established that Washington, D.C. was in the middle of a desert. It was only *after* talking to Jetfire that he then teleported the group to Egypt.   

The reason for the discrepancies is there are several different Smithsonian aerospace facilities, one of which is in Arizona. Without looking it up, if memory serves the outside shots (after Jetfire rams through the door or wall or whatever) are of the Arizona facility or are made to look like it. Bay apparently thought no one would notice that Washington, D.C. was suddenly in the middle of Arizona."

We used to get these regular news things in grade school but I don't know which one it was that had the article. I'm assuming (from Googling) that it was *Scholastic News*, but I'm not sure. I remem it had kind of a plethora of random small news items in it, such as a possible 10th planet etc., and I remem one of the articles being the laser tag gun thing and it being a kind of warning article about toy guns and police. It happening in 1987 would line up with the exact time (and class) I remem reading the article, since I remem reading it at my desk in 3rd grade (1988 school year)."

aww,fczhzue,t1_fczdx97,1578101677.0,"> I believe the current science specifically is all dinosaurs have feathers 

No, the current science is not that all dinosaurs had feathers. Some theropods like the Dromaeosauridae (*Velociraptor*, etc.) most certainly did, and there is still a question as to whether or not large theropods like *T. rex* did, but there were many species that did not, such as the sauropods (*Brachiosaurus*, *Argentinosaurs*, etc.). Ankylosauridae is a good example of a family of dinosaurs that was most certainly not covered in feathers."
aww,fcxywzs,t1_fcxsaa4,1578072446.0,"So a dog is unhygienic but sweating and bleeding all over each other is okay? Give me a break. There's a lot of sweating, there's sometimes a LOT of bleeding, and sometimes there's tears. That's how it works. You get used to people's fluids all over you and everywhere else too, or someone's fingernails gouging into your skin and you hope and pray they're someone who washes their hands. You get used to seeing your fair share of fighters puking too. And the gym equipment is always drenched in sweat, thus the constant need to be wiped down. And we have almost nightly classes with 30 - 40 kids in our dojang, and at any point at least a few of those kids are having ""allergy"" issues (aka, the flu or something because the parents brought them to class sick and dropped them off). My favorite was the mom who didn't even get out of her car, just dropped her kid off and sped off and as soon as I saw him I realized he had pinkeye. Good times.   

To that end the building is practically bleached from top to bottom every single night at no small expense in order to prevent any number of communicable diseases being spread around in case someone decided to bring a tag-along with them without telling.   

But the idea to suggest that somehow in the midst of that sea of snotty-nosed kids and sweaty, bleeding adults that the poor *dog* is the problem and is bringing around the plague or something is ridiculous, I'm sorry.   

That all being said--and this is the last I'll say on it because it honestly is just ridiculous to have to defend when, again, we've been very successfully doing this for decades now--no dog would ever have access to wander into our dojang because the dojang is closed when not in use anyways. The dojang is not a place for casual whatever you feel like doing. If you want to do yoga or exercise we have other areas for that. Our dojang is off-limits for anything else, and we follow normal customs--i.e., no shoes on the mats, if you are seen entering a restroom shoeless you are not permitted on the mat blah blah.   

Now if you have issues doing the downward dog on a mat that a dog wandered around on then yeah okay that's another matter entirely and you got me there."

Here in the South I know like Saint Thomas owns multiple hospitals in Tennessee and that's a Catholic thing and I'm sure there's others as well. General conversations go about like:

""Aren't they a Catholic hospital?""

""No.""

""But they're even named *Saint Thomas*. Surely they must follow some kind of church doctrines or something if the Catholic Church has a hand in it--or *something*.""

""No, it's just a name.""

Based on the amount of times I've had that conversation I think there's a frightening amount of non-information out there about what you can and can't expect from your health care providers."

I also don't remember them escaping because of an execution, but it's been years since I watched it. The scene that always sticks in my mind is McQueen trying to jump the barbwire fence on the motorcycle and tangling up in it and getting recaptured, if that rings a bell.

lostinspace,fcinn3i,t3_ehco9w,1577665627.0,"There is a huge difference between a well-written villain you love to hate and Dr. Smith, who you just hate because she's terrible. She is like a Saturday morning kids' cartoon villain or something, she's that laughably bad. The fact that such a huge swath of viewers feel the same way about her should tell you something. She's not a good character, at all. Whenever she's on screen it drags the writing down to an abysmal level for surrounding characters as well. The plot suffers because of her.   

I'll take it a step further, knowing I'll get downvoted for it, and say I feel Parker Posey does a terrible job in the role as well. I don't know if it's just her acting, or if it's the directing or what, but she is terrible in the role. She is never once convincing as a con-artist. No one in a million years should be conned by her, ever. She does not have the acting chops to pull off cool and calculating, etc. Every scene she does she comes across as obviously lying and almost unhinged. Whether that's her acting choice or a director telling her to do it Idk, but it's a terrible choice either way. I've said it before and I'll say it again--she's so cheesy and terrible, if she were a man I have no doubt she'd be twirling a thin mustache and laughing maniacally when no one else was around."
