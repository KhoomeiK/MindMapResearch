space,feg2oi2,t1_feeex6e,1579074281.0,"There are actually only two options. Either the highest possible speed is infinite, or it is finite. If it's finite, it's more natural to describe slower speeds in terms of the highest possible speed, rather than the other way around. The better question to ask is, ""why is 1/xyz the speed of light a useful unit of speed for us humans. Why is it not higher or lower?""

This raises the question of why should it be finite? Much of our model of physics is based on an assumption of locality. What that means is that any point in the universe can only influence its immediate surroundings. If one point is to influence a different point further away, it can only do so by exerting that influence on an adjacent point, which then influences a point adjacent to it, and so on until the further away point is reached. In this framework, it makes sense that a disturbance takes a nonzero amount of time to propagate."
