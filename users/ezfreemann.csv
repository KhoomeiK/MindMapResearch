atheism,fdnwh3m,t3_emacug,1578594252.0,"Agreed. The ignorance is astounding. First, they think we're a christian nation (wrong), then they talk politics from the pulpit, instructing their sheep how to vote, and they pay no taxes. 

I went to vote a few years ago. Despite our Constitution, I was forced to visit a church to vote as that's where they set up the polls. The church had pasted posters all over the place instructing people to vote for this anti-gay bill on the ballot. There was so much illegal with the operation, it makes my gums ache. I live in a very stupid area.

People need to drop the knee-jerk reaction they have, subconscious as it may be, of ""the church is good cuz it's the church!"". 

Christianity is a barbaric, unamerican creed that ignores the achievements of civilization. If I had my druthers, it would be criminalized. Christians are shocked when they hear something anti-christian, yet we're supposed to turn a blind eye to the child rape, ignorance, and hatred?

Again, look into **Americans United for the Separation of Church and State** if you want to do something, anything, to combat religious extremism and protect our Constitution."

MandelaEffect,fdb4db1,t3_ekgv1m,1578253636.0,"I never put much thought into the Mandela Effect UNTIL I learned of the James Bond example. In some of the movies, an actor named Richard Kiel plays ""Jaws"" a baddie henchman who is called such because he has metal teeth.

In one of the movies, Jaws is ""defeated"" by being distracted by a young girl that he meets. She's a bit nerdy and they obviously recognized each other as kindred spirits, sort of like Frankenstein befriending a village outcast girl or something. It's supposed to be amusing.

Here's the thing, I grew up in the 80s. I've seen most James Bond movies. I saw this movie. In it, the girl smiles, SHOWING A MOUTH FULL OF BRACES. That makes Jaws smile and they walk off together as new friends.

I learn now that the girl in the film NEVER HAD BRACES. This makes ZERO sense to me as THAT WAS THE JOKE. The braces and the metal teeth. THAT WAS THE POINT OF THE JOKE.

I distinctly remember the braces. I'm generally skeptical but this one is a fact. I remember it perfectly and now I see she never had the braces??

That's the one that takes the cake for me.

*edited to add that the movie was Moonraker and here's someone else mentioning this on reddit:*

It's sad when people need to be told this.

What about Jehova's Witnesses who are specifically commanded to NOT celebrate christmas. Is there NO respect for other religions?

I couldn't buy a menorah or Kwanzaa candles? Nope. Atheists? Fuck you I guess.

Guess Los Santos is populated only by christians. How nice.

The people down-voting this needs to ask themselves what they're down-voting. The fact that other religions exist? The fact that most christians are intolerant to that? The fact that I called you out on it? Just trying to figure a way you can down-vote this and not be a douchebag."
