politics,ff738ol,t3_eryota,1579640235.0,A candidate that mainstream politicians don't like won the last time. I don't think it will reflect badly on Bernie either.
politics,ff72kjr,t1_ff6yq54,1579639849.0,"They knew Lev when he was funneling oligarch cash to Republican candidates. Since he got caught, never heard of him, hell I can't even pronounce his name."
politics,ff71rui,t1_ff6yhyg,1579639410.0,"I saw one of Lev at Eric's 6th birthday party. Don't know if it's verified, but that would certainly put a lie to the "" I don't know him ""."

politics,femuuop,t1_femobov,1579270216.0,Epsteins murder was probably what prompted Parnas to flip. In this respect his murder backfired. Would love to know what happened to all the material that was seized from Epsteins properties.
politics,femtlp7,t1_femc3e7,1579269238.0,Yovanovich was helping Zelensky clear the corruption from Ukraine. This was against Putin and Trump's plans. She knows a lot about the fuckery that the Russians and Giuliani were pulling. She needed to be removed not recalled in the opinion of one or both of these groups.

facepalm,fekh1b0,t1_fekfrwd,1579199875.0,Racism is definitely passed down by the parents. I've seen it many times. The young people today that I've met though seem to be less susceptible to it. This is probably due to media exposure showing that people are just people regardless of colour. It's very encouraging.
politics,fekf1rr,t1_fek9zop,1579198689.0,"Yeah he's going to prison anyway, and he has no deal with the A.G.. His hope is to reveal as much information as possible so that his death wouldn't be much of an advantage."
politics,fek5ycg,t1_fejzhix,1579193300.0,Fitting that it's a herpes virus.

politics,fehy7qt,t1_fehtvoy,1579126253.0,Warren was making a desperate attempt to stop Bernie's surge in the polls. The whole thing was beneath her. She needs to go back to the Senate where she can do something positive.
politics,fehw8wx,t1_fehi0pj,1579125111.0,I wonder if Hyde was communicating with the illegal surveillance team in Ukraine from Mar a Lago. Maybe the Southern White House is a spy nest. Hyde is a liability to the FSB. No wonder he's paranoid. The only thing he's qualified for now is Republican congressman.

politics,feh2ntp,t1_feh08dq,1579107876.0,"It doesn't seem very likely since Giuliani was there at Trump's request and Parnas worked for Rudy. Hyde was reporting to Parnas and operatives were in contact with Hyde. Parnas probably was using Hyde as a buffer. I doubt Hyde has the contacts in Ukraine, whereas Parnas was hired because he has the contacts and connections with the FSB."
politics,fegrooq,t1_feglamz,1579100962.0,You don't kidnap or assault someone with her standing too much shit would hit the fan. I don't think she would be easily intimidated. She might however get depressed from having her obstruction exposed and hang herself or jump off a building. Too soon for another hanging maybe.

politics,fegnvnv,t1_feglqtm,1579098300.0,"Maybe Hyde should be arrested and his electronics examined to see who gave him his orders and who was doing the surveillance. Remember Giuliani represents Trump, and Parnes was working for him. Hyde was reporting to Parnes. Seems like a pretty clear conspiracy."
