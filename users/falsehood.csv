Here is the problem. I say that the 1% of not badness of Hitler, for example, is him at 6 having some redeemable qualities. You say that means I wouldn't say Hitler was ""generally bad.""

99.5% bad is terrible, horrible, awful, condemnation worthy. In terms of Hitler's impact to the world that is 100% bad - I don't think any of his good deeds, if there were any, have reached me.

But **to define a person at 100% given over to evil is to name that person as irredeemable.** There are KKK members that changed their affiliation, Stromfront affiliates that realized they were preaching BS. Derek Black is a good example.

Even a person (and there are many) who have done nothing but harm people often think they are doing right, an instinct that can be harnessed to change their behavior, even if that must happen behind prison walls.
