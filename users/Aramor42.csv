The play style you described with the A280-CFE does sound like something that'll suit me. But when the map lends itself to it, I sometimes do like being a sneaky sniper. Especially staying back as far as possible (for instance, near the First Order spawn on Jakku and then sniping all the Resistance snipers near the crashed destroyer's entrance). I can't wait to get the MT-242 because I still need a couple of solid shots to kill them, and judging by the times I got killed with that weapon, 2 shots should be enough I reckon. Unless they're all headshotting me, then I'll need to work on my aim."

And I sort of feel the same about heroes. I don't mind them as much in CS since I mostly play as a jetpack trooper there and I can usually get away from them quick enough thanks to those maps being mostly open space. I think I've even managed to take down a fair share of heroes in CS thanks to some good teamwork. But whenever I see one in GA I just turn the other way, objective be damned."

Fun anecdote, first match I played was GA on Kashyyyk during some Heroes weekend. Unlimited heroes on both teams so my lvl 1 trooper got his ass handed to him by every enemy hero at the same time. I was seriously contemplating selling the game again because it just wasn't fun, until I went on the internet and figured out this wasn't the normal gameplay. Love the game ever since."
