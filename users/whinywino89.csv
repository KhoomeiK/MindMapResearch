AmItheAsshole,ff0pzad,t3_eqri9u,1579471216.0,"NTA at all. This kind of behavior infuriates me. 

My husband dealt with this a lot at a brewery in a college town when he bartended. Brewery was 21+ but they'd make an exception for kids if their parents were present. He was asked quite a few times to tone down his language (or would receive complaints about people dropping the f'bomb when children are present). He was always like, you brought your kid to a brewery in a college town. Considering the kinds of things drunk college kids say/do, the word 'fuck' is the least of your problems."

fatlogic,fezmlyr,t1_few4md8,1579459046.0,"That goddamn thigh gap. Anorexic here (post-recovery). Same thing. I remember being 14 (not even remotely overweight. Probably underweight, honestly, and all muscle from soccer) and taking Saran Wrap and wrapping it tightly around both thighs and walking around just so I could know how it felt to walk without my thighs touching. Then, I would take it off and punch myself repeatedly until I bruised because I hated myself so much for not having a thigh gap. I didn’t hate fat people. I hated myself. 

Mental illness is a bitch and if this person is actually having panic attacks from seeing people exercising, that’s not “HAES” — she needs help."

I'll actually feel guilty for wanting a salad or wanting to go to the gym sometimes and it makes me feel like I've failed at recovery for wanting those things -- not as a way to pursue thinness, but simply because I enjoy them and they make me feel good. I've managed to get a handle on those demons but my anorexia was so loud for so long that now any time I have a voice/thought pop into my head, I think it's ""her""; when, in reality, it's not. It's me. And it pisses me off that these people have inadvertently made me question my recovery."

fatlogic,feool7w,t1_feo3ogl,1579303124.0,"It's soooo infuriating.

One of the reasons it took me so long to get help was because of this ""movement."" I was -terrified- that I would gain 30lbs of pure fat, would have to give up my love for weightlifting forever (because this community preaches that it's obsessive to exercise 5x a week), would have to always choose fries over a salad, etc; and when you're in the thick of it, for me, potentially dying was a better option.

Over 20lbs and two years later, I have a healthy amount of body fat and a fuck ton of muscle  -- of course, that's not good enough. I've been told by super righteous HAES people that I'm just ""pseudo-recovered"" because I still clearly care about aesthetics, still exercise daily (because I love it...and I literally work in the fitness industry), and still eat a predominantly vegetarian diet. You can't win with them."
fatlogic,feom4yt,t1_feo3spb,1579302000.0,"This is the thing that upsets me the most. I hate that the HAES community takes quotes and whatnot meant for those in ED recovery and applies those to the general population. If you're severely overweight, you probably don't need to live your life using the same tactics that someone with anorexia should. 

When I went through recovery, simply allowing myself to have a second serving of food or allowing myself to have fries with my meal was a huge, triggering event. Looking in the mirror and accepting that the body does need fat on it (versus just being skin and bones) was, and still is, very challenging. It wasn't/isn't just a simple, ""I do what I want; my body, my choice"" situation. It involved tears, guilt, panic attacks, and shame, and I feel like some people in the HAES community borderline trivialize eating disorders and equate them to what they go through dealing with ""diet culture."""

I'm currently scrambling trying to figure out how I'm going to afford a wedding I'm in that will end up costing me 2k when it's all said and done; solely because I felt pressured to be a bridesmaid despite my financial situation.

&#x200B;

Take it from me -- you will end up resenting your friend, stress will consume you, and you'll dread every.single.second of the wedding weekend. As someone who has been a bride, I'd rather have my friend happy and stress-free versus in credit-card debt because of ONE day. I'd just be honest with her in a gentle way. No, ""This is just too expensive and we all have bills of our own."" Instead, ""It really hurts me that I have to do this, but given my current financial situation, I need to respectfully drop out of the bridal party. I'm so sorry if this causes you any inconvenience, but rent comes first and I don't have the finances to juggle my bills and be in the bridal party for a destination wedding."""

Durango,fee1osx,t3_eol3rp,1579024551.0,"You'll be here just in time for Snowdown! A perfect time to move: [https://www.snowdown.org/](https://www.snowdown.org/)

If you have to go to a City Market, go to City Market South, not North. The co-op is great and veggies are plentiful! Nature's Oasis is on the pricier side, but has a lot of items you'd see at Whole Foods that other stores here don't have. I second Sunnyside for meat. Nature's also has some good meats (their deli is also delicious. Great sandwiches and smoothies). 

I know when moving, the last thing you want to do is cook. Zia is a great, healthy Mexican option (similar to Chipotle in terms of how you go about ordering). Bird's is great for fast chicken sandwiches or rotisserie meals. Chiang Thai at 11th Street has amazing Thai that you can pre-order or can have delivered if you're in their delivery radius. 11th St. also has great pizza and sliders! Ska Brewery's Container has delicious sandwiches, salads, and pizzas as well (plus the beer is great).

Bookcase and Barber is an amazing speakeasy with FANTASTIC drinks. In the summertime, The Balcony has live music often. Find some rafting friends as well! Animas River Days is always a fun time. Rafting is big in the summer months (feel free to DM me! Husband and I are in our early 30s, three cats but I LOVE PUGS, no kiddos, and we're always willing to meet new rafting, climbing, hiking friends!).

This winter has been MUCH more mild than last year, so in that regard, it makes walking about downtown easier. I know people are still finding places to climb. I have friends that are still out and about running and biking. I have yet to make it to Purg this year but that's obviously a huge part of winter activities for a lot of people.

If you're looking for something fun to do but it's crappy out, my husband and I love going to JBo's with a bunch of quarters, grabbing drinks and appetizers, and playing good, old-fashioned pinball. 

Be aware that our parking meter attendants are on top of their game, so make sure that if you're downtown you bring quarters or a credit card (not an amex). Parking is free on weekends and during weekday evenings. The library is great and clean. The river trail is always a delight. There are a lot of niche gyms here. For a local, 'bigger' one, Fitness Solutions 24/7 is, by far, the cleanliest gym I've ever encountered; then there are the CrossFit boxes (CrossFit Durango, Catacombs, etc). Jungle Gym is a ninja-style gym with really fun classes (they have boot-camp style classes as well as Spartan training, kettlebell training, ninja nights, etc). We have yoga studios and when it's not winter, 11th Street usually has yoga classes on their back deck. Ska does yoga and beer on Monday nights (not sure if they do this in the winter). 

Throughout the year, there will be various film festivals, art shows, food festivals (Taste of Durango is in May and you essentially get a ""taste"" of some of the best places in town), biking competitions, etc. 

I adore almost everything about this town. The airport situation isn't ideal. It's great if you don't mind spending extra on flights, but for international flights or for cheaper flights, you have to make the trek to Albuquerque. That said, the Durango airport is so charming and is a relaxing airport to fly into/out of."

In terms of morality, mayyybe the perfect thing to do would have been to go back in. But people telling you that you're the one in the wrong here or that you lack morals is ridiculous. 

What's the one thing you learn in customer service? The customer is always right. What the store SHOULD have done is explain the situation and offer a discount for your inconvenience versus just saying that you either need to come back and pay full price or get a refund. This would have benefitted their business as well because you would have likely returned to the boutique (I doubt you'll be returning now), and would have likely told people about your experience and how they recognized it was a mistake on THEIR end and offered you a discount to make up for it. 

I think the real asshole here is the manager for not orchestrating the above and, instead, chewing out an employee and making a customer a one-timer versus retaining that customer as a regular."

I don't, obviously. I'd like to say I'd NEVER do it, but I'm trying to imagine myself as a sleep-deprived, overwhelmed, stressed, financially-strapped, over-worked mother and I don't know if I'd be able to maintain the same self-control I have now.

antiwork,fe3vwhc,t3_en92ek,1578853347.0,"I'm kind of blown away by the hate for meal-prepping here. I work remotely and still meal prep. I love it. 

I check for the various sales in town and that determines which proteins and veggies I'll be using. It takes me three hours tops (that includes the shopping, chopping/peeling, cook times \[where you're not doing anything but simply waiting for the oven to go off\], and clean-up). You can pop chicken breasts in an instant pot for 8 minutes (or a bigger batch in a slow cooker) -- there's the protein for your meals. That's one dish (either crockpot container or instapot container). Pop some chopped veggies in the oven to roast for 25-30min (one baking sheet), grab some steam-in-the-microwave veggies if roasting them is too daunting. Pick different ""bases"" and sauces to make the meals a bit different (spring greens for a salad, rice for a bowl, potatoes, zucchini noodles or a whole wheat pasta).

While my food is cooking, for snacking, I chop up an array of raw veggies and stick them in a massive bowl in the fridge for easy grabbing (and have an array of dips -- hummus, salsa, etc), I pop some popcorn and stick that in another container, wash my fruit for quick additions to yogurt, etc.

I put on a podcast and It's super relaxing for me. I love having healthy options to choose from at all times and as someone who loathes making decisions, it's nice to not have to think about meals during the week."

This goddamn couple and their baby were on standby and, despite there being multiple people in standby, we’re given an entire row in first class because they “looked like they could use it.” The fucking baby screamed the WHOLE time. 

You could tell that every single person in first class was IMO rightfully pissed off. The mom was borderline yelling peekaboo repeatedly to try to get it to calm down, shaking its noisy toys.

fatlogic,fdhe48j,t1_fdgz6a5,1578420731.0,"I'm with you here. I don't get how it's so time-consuming. I understand there's a learning curve, but even being so ""strict"" that you're weighing out your food takes two seconds.

I'm also the same with the mental energy -- I love planning out my day ahead of time. I know what I'm making, when I'm making it, what I need to get from the store. I'm not sitting there staring at my fridge in an indecisive panic. As I'm just maintaining my weight, I'm fine with switching things up if need be; if my ass really wants to go to a coffee shop to work and a biscotti with my coffee sounds delightful, I just plug it in and move on with life.

I understand the obsessive component because I've been there -- I've been the one taking off a piece of lettuce so the scale reads 85g of lettuce and not 86g; this was pre my anorexia diagnosis. So, for some, tracking or counting calories isn't a smart move mentally and I had to break away for a moment; but as long as you have a solid relationship with food and body image, tracking can be incredibly useful. 

Having a gameplan with my daily food intake is just another tool in the toolbox that makes my life easier and less stressful; the same way budgeting my finances, keeping track of car maintenance, and having a weekly to-do chore list helps keep my daily life from becoming overbearing."

I \*hate\* this -- I'm a recovered anorexic and it took me a LONG time to realize that I need more than 2,000 calories a day to function given my activity level (part of my recovery was my nutritionist actually showing me how many calories I was eating, how many carbs, etc. to get over the stigma associated with calories and carbohydrates). It's so hard adhering to that 2000-2200 calorie a day lifestyle and not falling into a relapse when people constantly say, ""omg you eat SO much food."" JUST LET ME LIVE, DAMMIT."
AmItheAsshole,fdewsob,t1_fdegj1o,1578348239.0,"I definitely agree with this advice. I had a similar situation for my wedding.

If you can sincerely apologize to our parents and the rest of our siblings, then I will, of course, extend you an invitation. She didn't, so she wasn't invited. 

It's still an issue to this day (her not being invited), but I stand by my decision (literally all she had to do was swallow her pride and apologize...). If you give him the bullet points of WHY you feel this way and what he needs to do to be invited to your wedding and he still doesn't follow through, that's entirely on him. 

I would give him the opportunity to do so though. Explain why you've been hurt by him, why you want your stepfather to walk you down the aisle, and that this choice of yours does not signify the end of your father/daughter relationship -- he simply needs to understand it will take you time to learn to trust and feel comfortable around him again. ""A great first step to us mending our relationship would be for you to accept my decision to have stepfather walk me down the aisle and to simply be there and be present for what should be one of the best days of my life -- if you can do that for me then I think we can try to slowly rebuild our father/daughter relationship."""

The shitty part is that this movement does take a lot of the things you learn in recovery and twists it to fit the FA mentality. In \*recovery\* you're supposed to eat fear foods, whether it's through force at your treatment center or if you just happen to crave them.  In \*recovery\*, for many, you're supposed to cease exercising. But that doesn't mean that \*after\* recovery, you simply throw caution to the wind and stop caring for your body. 

Post recovery, I still believe in the power of healthy habits, love moving my body regularly, and love the way I feel when I eat whole, nutrient-dense foods (knowing full well that I can, of course, have some fries if I'd like some and take a rest day from the gym if I'm just not feeling it).

I also understand that just because I'm craving something, that DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO EAT IT. The IE community would tell this person that this is a phase that passes -- so to just power through it and eventually, she will WANT a salad over fried chicken -- to lean into WHY she wants to eat greasy food and to work on her mental health (which is great advice -- but that doesn't mean she should neglect her physical health in the process).

Sometimes, you have to put your health over your tastebuds. The older I get, the more I prioritize whole, natural foods simply because I'm not in my 20s anymore and I know that there are consequences to my actions (while anorexia is an extreme example: knowing what it feels like to not give my body the nutrients it needs, I never want my body to feel like that again, even in the other direction).
