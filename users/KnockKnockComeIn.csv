10/10"
futurebeatproducers,ffao2dk,t3_esecjl,1579740481.0,"Or do and still make it original.

Get as many ideas out  as possible. It’s always easier to discard an entire track or section or instrument than it is to be restricted by a set of guidelines.

You subconsciously follow enough guidelines and “rules” to begin with.

Make the fucking music, don’t focus on what you can’t do. You gotta doo doo baby."

GetMotivated,ff4lglx,t3_ere89c,1579566479.0,"My first car was a 1991 Mercedes 190E. I paid $300 for it and man that thing was a piece of shit. I’ve had a few other used Mercedes vehicles and loved them but never paid more than a few thousand dollars for them.

I never understood how Mercedes became a “rich” persons car. Mercedes makes semi trucks, the Sprinter vans are used in commercial applications, and in other parts of the world it’s widely popular with the middle class. 

The 2020 Mercedes GLA SUVs start at $35,000. The 2020 Ford Explorers are like $50,000.

My point is that owning a Mercedes shouldn’t be considered an “achievement.”"

Dachshund,fex6boj,t3_eqo4ax,1579425237.0,"Hey I just got one of these for our garage. It warns about carbon monoxide poisoning and it’s what I keep reading online.

I’ve kept the garage slightly open while running it but I would rather have it closed. I have a CO detector set up but haven’t had it go off. Super paranoid about it however.

What has your experience been?"

redneckengineering,fec5jt9,t1_febs8ci,1578966975.0,Seems like that giant fucking shelf right in front of the air conditioner would work. You would fucking move it forward about a foot and close the window. Leave it there. It wouldn’t look any worse than it currently does and do a much better job at keeping the cold out.
redneckengineering,feawb1q,t3_eo8zjt,1578952840.0,Seems like the same if not more effort to just remove the window unit?
redneckengineering,fe5qwqg,t1_fe5pdaf,1578873251.0,The bumper eventually grows back and heals itself. Keep the opening clean and then once it’s ready you take your car back to the automotive veterinarian to have them removed.

woodworking,fdbiia1,t3_ekhrr7,1578257718.0,"Looks awesome. I think you would need glue. Wood doesn’t bond to itself no matter how much pressure is applied. I’ve attempted many times and yet they just won’t bind.

If you used screws as well adding the glue is not a bad idea. Jumping in and out of bed over a few years will cause some screws to loose their grip or slowly become undone. You have prevented that and this thing should last a lifetime without any squeaks."

I believe the only restriction is that batteries can not be shipped via airplanes."
