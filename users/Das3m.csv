LucidDreaming,ff4nyn1,t3_erkaf6,1579568232.0,You could try using a fan to a) cut out noise by over powering it plus it’s a constant steady sound and b) cool you down

memes,fele2tn,t1_fek75e3,1579220005.0,"I have a friend who was very thin, almost anorexic. She would become defensive if I made comments around the topic of body weight. So I took a different approach and asked how she saw herself. She told me she finds it difficult to put on weight, no matter how much she eats she just can’t seem to put on weight. At that time she was very sedentary. Over time she started to become increasingly active, she started scuba diving, rock climbing, and bush walking. She put on some weight in the process. Whilst I still think she’s a bit skinny, she’s on the right track and so I dismiss any concerns from my mind. 

How do you see yourself? 

Do you often experience fatigue or dizziness? Do you have a lot of hair loss? Do you get sick often?"
NoFap,feju320,t1_fejkgjo,1579185870.0,I suggest you check out lucid dreaming. You’re only limited by your imagination. Takes about a month to get the hang of it.

The same way you might watch and judge a homeless person who looks like they’ve been on a drug bender, or an elderly person causing a difficult situation at the cash register, or a man being arrested on the spot by police officers. 

Given a certain case of action, some people may congratulate you, some despise you, and some not care at all. Acknowledge that people will judge and you have no control over them judging. Practise being the judge of yourself."

NoFap,feia28y,t3_ep1orr,1579133663.0,"It sounds like you don’t eat many veggies nor fruits so I recommend you buy yourself a multivitamin. The best one I’ve found to date and currently use is “Vital Greens All in one” you can buy it on Ebay for about $109 AU. I know that isn’t cheap, for me I see it as an investment in my health. I used to spend my money on take away food, spending about $70 a week. Now I buy out maybe once a week and put the remainder towards my health. Gym $150 for 3 months, 5 kg protein for $100, multivitamin $109, swimming pass $70 per month. If you cut out all the things that serve no benefit to you it’s surprising how much easier it is to invest in your health. Plus I’ve lost weight and gain muscle and energy. 

If you want to improve your cooking watch some cooking shows or observe people cook so you get an idea of what ingredients mix well with each other. Once you get the gist of how ingredients mix together, their smell and taste, you’ll be able to just throw a bunch of things into a pan and make the flavour work. If you want to make something specific then following a recipe helps. 

Note: of course I suggest eating veggies and fruits. If you were eating a sufficient amounts I wouldn’t recommend a multivitamin."
NoFap,feg2gnc,t3_eordxa,1579074021.0,"Whilst I get the gist of the message and do agree for the most part. I think it’s more like, progress made in 5 years of ordinary living can be  achieved with 6 months of hardcore focus and alignment. There’s no time manipulation involved, we just have a tendency to seek comfort and don’t live up to our maximum potential most of the time. To me it seems like in order to fulfil on our potential we must master the art of taking action without allowing our brains to paralyse us with excuses and considerations."
NoFap,fdpn6yz,t1_fdogrnv,1578633458.0,Personally I’ve realised that socialising was lacking for me. I know my count is low but since I’ve started making an effort to socialise I haven’t felt the desire to PMO
socialanxiety,fdp0kf5,t1_fdo0dms,1578617142.0,"I agree with this advice. I used to try and formulate an interesting/engaging response in my head whilst the other person was talking and when it came to me actually responding I would end up saying something very basic like “oh yes, that’s interesting, tell me more” and then I might change the topic because I didn’t know what else to say. It made my conversations jagged and not flowing. 

I started practising the idea of trusting my brains ability to respond. It’s similar to the way I would respond when I’m half dazed in the morning just after waking up, all the in head conversations were not in full speed. And so I slowly began to release myself of the conversations I was having in my head and started to listen. I would reassure myself that it didn’t matter if what I said was boring and non engaging, this practise was in the name of self improvement and one day I’ll naturally become more interesting. In terms of topics, I found it easiest to talk about aspects of life, I was not very good at banter and still am not. When I’m in a good mood I can make people laugh and have an engaging conversation for hours. Like 2-3 hours, that’s amazing for me. I know realise the energy I put into a conversation is the energy I get out of the conversation. I also realised by eating healthy, sleeping well,  and doing exercise I can increase my energy levels. I now have no problem striking up a conversation with a random person I just met, sitting at the bus stop or waiting to get a hair cut. I still have progress to make, I just want you all to know it gets better as long as you keep trying. If you give up you’ll be the same in 10+ years. I made this progress in 2 years"
NoFap,fdjqnv8,t3_eldtjm,1578483769.0,To think so much can change in 2x3 months is astounding. I’ve been going in loops the past 12 months
