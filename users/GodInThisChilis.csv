AskWomen,ffbjwf3,t1_ffbjsn3,1579768796.0,"Yeah, I realize. I also know that if someone is dedicating their entire career into a profession that requires them to look at genitals very frequently, you best bet that they have a fine control on those ‚Äúrandom‚Äù boners. 

There are plenty of OBGYNs with penises and I‚Äôve never heard of one getting a boner during a pelvic exam. No matter how random it is, it‚Äôs extremely unprofessional and is bound to make any patient uncomfortable. If a doctor thinks they‚Äôre going to get a boner or feels one coming on they could excuse themselves the best way possible or at least apologize if it‚Äôs too obvious at that point."

fasting,fembl2h,t1_fembf8q,1579247374.0,"No one plans on getting an eating disorder. Many people fast the correct and healthy way, but just by the nature of fasting, there are bound to be a decent handful of people who will initially begin doing it the healthy way and end up with an eating disorder. I think it‚Äôs absolutely vital for people who fast to know the differences between healthy fasting and disordered eating‚Äîand most do, but it has to stay that way and this definitely needs to remain a place where ED symptoms are not taken lightly. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm trying to say. It‚Äôs very important for anyone fasting to ensure that they don‚Äôt accidentally or unintentionally end up with an eating disorder. It happens far more often than you‚Äôd think."
fasting,fem9w72,t1_fem9jdt,1579245245.0,"I agree with that last statement. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the ultimatum of disordered eating either. I just sometimes feel the need to comment, regardless of whether or not my comment was needed or is even seen, in the small chance that someone *is* possibly headed down a path of disordered eating and needs a small reminder or push back to the healthy path. 

I also think that anyone who is fasting for weeks at a time, all the time, is probably suffering from some level of an eating disorder. I think there‚Äôs strategic, healthy, evidence-based fasting and then there‚Äôs something else. I disagree with a lot of the ‚Äúmethods‚Äù I see on here as someone who knows eating disorders very well. I think the essential line between fasting and an eating disorder lies in the mental state of the individual partaking. If someone is punishing themselves for eating in a normal calorie range or punishing themselves for eating at all, they need to seek help.

For anyone reading who may need it, these are the main warning signs and behaviors of someone with an eating disorder per the National Eating Disorders Association: they restrict the number of calories and the types of food they eat, ignoring their bodies' hunger and satiety cues. They tend to be obsessed with issues concerning weight, calories, food and dieting. Anorexia is also characterized by disturbed body image and avoiding social situations that involve food. IF prescribes many of these features of an eating disorder.

The main, key differences between an ED and healthy fasting lie in these questions (per NEDA): habits. Are they really distraught about what they eat and their weight? Do they feel really guilty when they eat something they didn't plan to? Do they ignore bodily sensations of hunger and satiety? Do they feel out of control during their eating windows? Is their quality of life compromised by their eating habits?"
fasting,fem90q4,t1_fem8qmj,1579244208.0,"Well that may just be where we disagree. I meant more of the mental side effects rather than physical, but I agree with what you said there. My sister used to have anorexia and I know a lot about the warning signs and symptoms. Unfortunately I have seen a decent amount of people utilizing OMAD who seem to present disordered eating behavior, but again, I‚Äôm no doctor. But when people are punishing themselves or feeling overwhelming guilt if they eat more than one meal a day, that‚Äôs disordered eating and is very unhealthy and can unfortunately contribute to an eating disorder or be a symptom of one. 

Eating far less than what is generally deemed a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù amount of calories per day or per week can also contribute to an eating disorder. Not saying it always or even usually does, but it can and I‚Äôve definitely seen it in some instances here. I just always feel the need to say something if it seems like someone may be heading to disordered eating because I know firsthand how quickly an ED can come to life."
fasting,fem8c9v,t1_fem85ux,1579243439.0,You do you. I‚Äôve just been told my a nutritionist and my GP that dipping below 1200 calories a day during intermittent fasting is eating disorder territory but I guess it could depend on the person. I stopped doing OMAD because I was also having trouble getting enough calories and don‚Äôt want to resort to just starving myself rather than strategically fasting under the supervision of my doctors.

college,fe6knmx,t3_envzzl,1578894051.0,"Good luck. I had a similar experience, kind of. My first two years were awful and I was extremely depressed, gained 45 pounds, no friends, and had a 2.3 GPA. My parents got divorced as well. 

Two weeks before the semester ended in May, I decided I was going to move back home (to California) and move in with my aunt. My university has like 10 online degree programs and mine just happened to be close to one of them, so I changed my degree from criminology to criminal justice and finished my bachelors online from 1,000+ miles away. 

From the time I began full online courses until graduation, I had a 4.0 GPA. I ended up completing more than half of my degree (72 credit hours) in a year and a half and graduated early in 3.5 years this past December. It was the absolute best decision I could‚Äôve made, both for my academic status and for my own mental health. I never enjoyed college life and felt very distant and isolated from all of my peers. Allowing myself to work at my own pace, alone, did wonders for my motivation and success in college. 

If your university offers full online coursework, I recommend that you absolutely look into it. Especially since you only have one semester left, I imagine it shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult to finish your last few classes online. Also, as someone else mentioned, get a therapist. Can‚Äôt be said enough. I think every person in the world should go to therapy and that everyone can benefit from it, and it‚Äôs something my family has always sworn by.

I have a juicer so I‚Äôll make myself a small ginger shot, but I also am always stocked up on ginger chews from Trader Joe‚Äôs and tummy ginger drops from Target that have worked wonders for me.

GERD,fe54v9q,t3_enrnch,1578865685.0,"stress is likely not the primary cause but could trigger it for sure. mine gets a lot worse when I‚Äôm under stress. it‚Äôs probably not as bad when you eat at home because the food you‚Äôre eating is probably ‚Äúbetter‚Äù (not restaurant food or fast food that‚Äôs cooked in oil, etc.) and has fewer trigger ingredients. 

unfortunately, acid reflux can just show up in anyone without any big event or significant reason, so there‚Äôs a possibility that stress is what introduced the reflux but there‚Äôs also a chance it just kind of appeared. with that being said, a lot of people who have GERD or heartburn have linked their stress or anxiety to their symptoms, but it‚Äôs been hard for people to prove anything more than correlation. 

good luck and I hope your symptoms improve. I‚Äôm 21 and about to be on year 7 of dealing with this so I hope you can get yours under control sooner than I have!"
