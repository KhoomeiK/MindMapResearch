  Warren could have done something similar, and explain why she feels hurt. but if she did that it would sound way more like shes accusing him or bring too much attention to her feelings - something women are accused of having too much of. her pivot was the best she could do without making herself look worse. don't forget it wasn't her who brought this up, it was her staff who leaked it to CNN who just wants juicy bullshit. she's not denying it probably because she actually feels like he said something hurtful, but she's doesn't want this fight, clearly."

  I get the feeling there was a miscommunication. Bernie said something that Warren mistakenly interpreted as him saying she couldn't win. Bernie feels attacked, Warren is hurt. I feel like Bernie blindly defending himself without considering how his words might have been misunderstood is a mistake while Warren's pivot to the overall conversation that people say under their breath about women was not. she did not play into the bait of calling Sanders a misogynist while staying true to how she feels.    
  
  really, they need to have a private conversation where Warren explains what he said that hurt her,  and he explains his true intent but apologies for the impact he had on her. then they need to make a joint public statement on how they resolved the miscommunication. I don't think it will happen since the idea of impact vs intent isn't something people like to think or talk about"

  having attached 21s is rare on top of that, so it's pretty unlikely we've seen a case like the one you're asking about. it's generally considered that a person with attached 21s will always have babies with Down syndrome or miscarriages unless both people have attached 21s, which then the possibilities are four 21s, or two sets of attached 21s (not viable), no 21s (not viable), or one set of attached 21s (like the parents, normal with attached 21s). but again, having attached 21s is rare.
