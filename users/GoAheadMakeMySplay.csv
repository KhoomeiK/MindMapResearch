The resulting number is infinite, but does not contain the sequence 789.  So by way of counter-example, it is *possible* that an infinite sequence does not contain every imaginable sub-sequence.

That being said, AFAIK it's still mathematically unproved whether or not pi in particular contains every imaginable sequence of digits.

Here's another thought experiment for you - we know that the Observable Universe is only a part of the Universe as a whole.  It's yet unknown whether the Universe is infinite or not, but let's suppose it is, hypothetically.  Since it is possible for the Earth to exist in the Universe (it obviously is unless we get into some really weird cosmology/philosophy), is it safe to assume that another exact copy of Earth exists somewhere else in the infinite Universe?  All things being equal, yes, one could surmise that, and in fact could further surmise that there necessarily are an infinite number of exact copies of Earth.  But what if all things are *not* equal?  What if there is some yet-undiscovered ""field"" (like the electromagnetic field) that exists everywhere in the Universe and this Very Strange Fieldâ„¢ has the property that every point in space-time is occupied by a unique value (or quantity, if you prefer)?  Then, in fact, the opposite might be true and it may very well be *impossible* that another exact duplicate Earth exists anywhere else, even though the Universe is still infinite."

Most beautiful smile I've ever seen in a painting.

But seriously, this is definitely not a binary representation of ASCII, and probably not machine code as the information has a low-(err, high?-)entropy/low-density tendency to it.

That said, I'm most interested in the difference between the colored rows and the b&w rows.  It looks to me like the b&w rows represent unary numbers from 1 - 7 whereas the colored rows might represent something in binary (with an unusually low density of either 1s or 0s depending on how you look at it)."

1) The colored rows have black bars as ""separators/delimiters"".  There is no absence of these anywhere in the painting, thus the black bars do not represent any information.  The variable in these rows is either color or white.

2) The b&w rows use white ""bars"" as delimiters with the black bars in between as variables.  These have a very distinct pattern from the colored rows - so if there's information encoded here, the colored rows and b&w rows represent very different ""types"" of information."

2) Notice that on the b&w rows there's never more than a single black bar missing consecutively which would almost certainly rule out meaningful binary data. Also, with the other observation it would seem that if there is information encoded here, the colored rows and b&w rows represent very dissimilar information.

3) Going beyond binary into just random observation, there are a couple instances in the b&w rows where there are 7 black bars in a row, all other clusters of black bars are fewer.
