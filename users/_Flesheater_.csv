Would you like to review your previous posts? You didn't give me anything. You just said words.

>It's literally impossible to raise animals ethically for eating unless there literally is no other option when it comes to survival. Which there isnt here in the west. You know what the poorest people on earth eats? Rice.

So, if you were to raise cows, let them graze in pastures that were already naturally there, then slaughter them humanely once they approach the end of their life, but before the meat is worthless....you don't consider that ethical? I feel like you're assigning human values to animals. What does a cow need to live a happy, fulfilling life? Grass. And water lol. That's all they fucking do is eat grass, that's all they fucking want! Feed them grass, keep them happy, then eat them so that their life can benefit other still existing life, and not just rot back into the dirt, wasting perfectly good nutrition.

Rice? Bruh, you know what's not a very nutritious food? Rice lol. It's fucking diet bread, it's filler, it's empty carbs. This is why all you vegans have titties, cuz if you didn't plow through carbs you'd just starve to death lol.

>you know what's also natural behaviour in the wild? Rape and killing your own children

Raping stuff and killing your children is far less common in the wild than animals eating other animals, that's not a good comparison. Not to mention, HOW can an animal give consent so as to make the intercourse not rape? I don't necessarily want to get into the ethics of animal rape, but again, you're assigning human values to animals that lead a completely different existence from us.

>We dont need meat to be healthy, we'll actually be better off without, planet wise and resource wise and literally billions less animals will die.

If you want fewer animals to die, eating LESS meat accomplishes that too. You can have both.

>Harvard study.

This is not a study. ""Now a Harvard-led study published online June 12, 2019, by *BMJ* "". This is a Harvard article referencing the study, much like my BBC article before. The actual study isn't even linked from here. If my BBC article wasn't good enough for you, then this doesn't work for me.

Look man, at the end of the day I don't care about your diet. It doesn't matter to me how healthy it CAN be to be vegan, assuming you're doing it well. My problem with you was the fact that you are under the impression that vegans are the only beings allowed to care about animals. If you honestly, truly believe that, then you're retarded and you have exactly no critical thinking skills. You're ignoring so much of vegan/meat debate just so you can scream ""I'M HEALTHY AND SAVING THE EARTH!!"""

I never said it was a study, and it's a better source than what you gave me.

> Free range dont mean bug open grass fields

I never said anything about free range? You're putting more words in my mouth. You are operating under the assumption that it's impossible to raise meat ethically for eating and therefore nobody does it. That's complete bullshit.

>  individuals go into slaughterhouses at 10% of their natural life span 

I mean, I'm not cool with this either lol. It's a problem with a very obvious solution though. Just....buy meat where they don't do that?

>  the free range grass roamed uses way more land and its the leading cause of deforestation and species extinction in the world. 

It doesn't have to be like that though. You're acting like shitty people doing shitty things is just the norm. There are areas on earth that could be designated for raising livestock that wouldn't involve trees getting cut down, just flat(ish) land. The fact that we don't do this already isn't a problem with meat consumption, it's a problem of poor planning.

> Meat combs with cholesterol and bad fats which clog arteries and leads to hear attacks 

What about your strokes tho?

> Not to mention the worlds health association had classified processed meats as a stage 1 carcinogen

PROCESSED MEAT!! You shouldn't be eating processed ANYTHING if your main concern is health.

> I ate meat most of my life to, so I get it, breaking habits is hard, but this cannot be justified, if though want to keep going like you do then fine, but don't try to paint any of this as nessescary or humane, that's seriously downplaying all the suffering animals in the industry go trough. 

It CAN be justified. The fact that you can see animals eat other animals in the wild tells you that meat consumption is a NATURAL part of existence in at least some respect. You know, all this talk and I have yet to see anything resembling a source. You make a lot of claims here, but nothing to back any of it up. 

> I bring this up here because people scream bloody murder when someone hits a dog yet turn a blind eye to all the animals being unnecessarily killed. Its massive hypocrisy. 

But, it IS necessary. Should we eat LESS meat as a society? 100%. Absolutely. Less meat and more veggies....but still some meat.

> [https://youtu.be/Ud7RkxtO3-Y](https://youtu.be/Ud7RkxtO3-Y) this is a nice summary of meat and association with cancer/heart disease.

MadeMeSmile,fe5zy8y,t1_fe5us8p,1578878691.0,"Of course I know where my meat comes from, and lately I've been making a switch to meat products that are raised ethically. Shocker, that IS possible. Your meat doesn't HAVE to support factory farming and the pricier stuff has a lot more nutrition AND flavor, so it's totally worth the extra money. And bro, don't try to play the ""vegans are healthier"" card. No you aren't lol. [Vegans also are susceptible to higher rates of stroke!](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-49579820) I would love to see the same BMI, cancer, and heart disease studies you mention done comparing vegan diets with something like keto or paleo diets. if you compare a vegan diet to your average 2020 western fatty diet, then, yeah! probably looks pretty good, but saying that means that a vegan diet is objectively the healthiest most sustainable diet is, at best, an association as causation fallacy. It having SOME *questionable* health benefits doesn't mean its the optimal or even ideal way to eat.

Not to mention there are benefits to eating meat that i guarantee you've been told about before, judging from how you react to people being nice to a fish on the train. Meat is more dense in nutrition than vegetables so you don't have to eat as much of it, animals can take veggies we can't eat (grass being one example) and convert it into valuable nutrition that we CAN eat, meat has b12 so you dont need to supp, just to name a few glaring benefits.

My issue with vegans isn't the moral aspect, its your worthless attitudes. Why even bring this up here? Nobody was gonna eat the fish, they're two totally separate issues that just so happen to both involve animals. I don't see how you can arrive at the conclusion that eating meat = not loving animals. You just have this holier than thou attitude going on. Like, is a vegan the only person qualified to be nice to another living being? C'mon man, that's corny. Assuming that loving animals and eating meat are not compatible is just naive. Completely irrational and it shows that you've put more thought into justifying a fad diet than actually understanding the bigger picture of life itself."

>When you get home from work watch a YouTube video on how to make your own resume in Word, then upload it to both profiles. It doesn't matter if you didn't go to college, or this was your only job, or whatever other excuse you're trying to come up with right now. Making a resume almost AUTOMATICALLY puts you above everyone else who doesn't have one. No more and no less than 1 full page. List your name, contact info, school/any certifications, and prior work experience (maybe with a relevant skills section for padding). It's best if you make your own from scratch and don't use one of the Word templates. Everyone uses the templates, so they effectively see the same resume potentially thousands of times over the course of their hiring process. Having one that's unique, but still all business will make you stand out against the backdrop of grey. Don't outright lie on it, if you HAVE to fluff your shit use half-truths or something that you can explain your way out of in an interview situation. Keep it simple, most potential employers will only skim so ONLY sparce, relevant, bulleted information that's easy to read. Apply to EVERY job that you think you could learn how to do that ISN'T a gas station/somewhere you've worked before. I don't care if you don't THINK you're qualified, if it's a job that only requires you to submit the resume and not spend an hour on a stupid ass application, just fucking do it! You click like one or two buttons and you're THAT much closer to escaping hell. It legitimately does not get any easier than the ""submit your resume"" button on Indeed. The option is there at no additional cost, so you may as well try. I read a jarring statistic about how many jobs were filled by people NOT meeting the company's minimum qualifications (like, 30-50% jarring, though I can't remember the actual number). Use this to your advantage. Maybe you'll get trained in a marketable skill along the way!

>Interviews suck, but just know that THEY also know how stressful this shit is for you. Everyone hates finding a new job. Be your best you and if you bomb, just remember that means next time will be much easier cuz you'll know what NOT to do.

>Only apply to jobs that pay better than what you make now. If you're gonna lie about ANYTHING, lie at the interview/application about how much you made at your previous job by a buck or two. They use that info to try to screw you with how much they'll offer you, so screw them first! If you haven't already quit yet (and the smart move is to make sure you've already accepted the new position before putting your two weeks in, but just do what wont make you kill yourself lol) then don't tell a fucking soul at work until you're ready to put your 2 weeks in. Blind-side them, fuck it and fuck them too. When I quit CVS I even had to take some of gf's anxiety meds to confront my boss to put in my 2-weeks, but it worked and put me on the level of ""idgaf"" that i need to be on to muscle through a very difficult conversation. If this is an option to you and the idea of quitting gives you anxiety, do it.  
>  
>Now here's the tough part and the part where you need to realize the universe doesn't just cater to you, BUT you can still work it until it does. You might jump out of the frying pan, into the fire. You might quit your ass of a job only to realize you've been hired somewhere worse. This is a potential that cannot be ignored, and is a reasonably likely outcome, so instead, we plan for it. If you find yourself at another shitty/shittier job than the last, repeat the process until the desired outcome is achieved. Every job lets you get away with being a shitty noob for a little while. Take advantage of that, and collect that easy money while you look for another prospective job. Don't stop until you're at a job that allows you time to heal mentally. Do it 50 times if you have to, but never let them beat you.  
>  
>Lastly, under NO circumstance during this entire process are you ever allowed to fucking feel bad for yourself. Listen to me, the reason you don't see a light at the end of the tunnel is cuz you're so used to stroking yourself off with depression. Cut the shit. When you start to feel bad for yourself you lose all motivation to try anymore and thats STUPID. You'll literally never escape if you don't try to. You already know feelings are fleeting, some days you have a little more drive to fix shit than others. If you actively kill that drive you're just going to end up suffering for longer. Feeling bad for yourself does not serve you. It never has and it never will, so knock it off. You might not get calls back instantly. You might blow it at your first few to 30 interviews. You might find some success at first and then hit a dry spell. SHIT HAPPENS, BOY! The game is already stacked against you and you know that. There's about a fucking billion things that can go wrong and only 1 desired outcome, so be patient with yourself. We aren't trying to hit the leaderboards here, we're just trying not to lose. You're not a failure, you're a winner that hasn't caught their edge yet, even if you fucking die looking for decent work. You're a failure when you STOP trying. No feeling bad for yourself ever again. We're all done with that useless shit 5ever.

Do this until you get a new job.

If you're not good at ""not thinking"" about something, then I want to remind you that EVERY stupid little skill from learning to piss straight to pegging baseballs out of stadiums is a process of practice. In allowing yourself to think about work on your days off, you're training your brain to think ""this is how i need to react on my days off"" instead of actually enjoying it.

Look @ u breh, you want your free time, yet when it's given to you all you can think about is work. Stop that. No more. When you start thinking about work on your days off now, instead, shift your focus to something productive you can do that day and just do it. Laundry, dishes, some personal project you've been working on. Just do something and let that annoying feeling get forgotten.

When you're not at work, you're not thinking of work anymore. Allowing yourself to think about it is training your brain in a way that will only induce suffering."

To say ""weed kills motivation because when I smoke weed I get unmotivated"" is to imply that there are no highly motivated people who regularly smoke weed, which is just not true. If you're having motivation issues, quitting weed will probably help to a point, but you're still gonna need to step up your self-discipline game just in general to get out of that funk. IMO weed attracts lazy mofos, it doesn't create them."
AskReddit,fciv7sb,t1_fcin14b,1577670611.0,"I'm working at a hospital pharmacy right now, and literally JUST before I stumbled on this thread my pharmacist was telling me that we've had an uptick in patients experiencing this. Very weird synchronicity. Maybe I only clicked here in the first place cuz of what the pharmacist said lol, but I feel like I have to share what she told me now.

Anyways, she was saying that is rare, but becoming more common now that it's legal here (MA), and nothing in the hospital really relieves the nausea. I saw another user say halidol (haloperidol) might help, and another mention hot showers. She also said one patient said that he was not a pot smoker, but was using CBD oil 4 times per day, so take that information however you will. Patients DO lie sometimes, maybe his super conservative mother was next to him or something? Idk. That's about all I got from the convo."
AskReddit,fcitz3l,t1_fcgvmda,1577669758.0,"I love SP, but this is kinda bullshit. I didn't even start smoking weed (or any substance for that matter) until i was like 22 and I grew up to not be very good at anything anyways! It might make you fine with being bored, but sometimes it also makes shit you thought was boring before  seem more interesting, which could cause you to learn a new skill!

I like Rogan's take on it. Lazy people are just gonna be lazy, high or otherwise. Productive people are gonna be productive. I find personally, it can go either way. I either can get lost writing/recording music for hours on end while stoned, maybe drift away reading a book for hours, or ill accidentally kill a bag of chips and watch YouTube on my couch all day and do nothing else. Maybe I'll spend half the day doing chores and the other half fucking about. This behavior is consistent with my non-high self, and my behavior all throughout my entire life; sometimes i suck, other times i don't. It's almost a 50/50 split (personally). Weed might exaggerate my feelings in that moment a little, but overall if I want to work/have to work, I'm gonna work, stoned or otherwise. If you're having issues with motivation I wouldn't stop my search for answers at weed. I feel like in most people its only going to be a small part of a much bigger willpower issue."

You cannot formulate a cohesive plan without a clear head.

And if you dont utilize this information eventually ill be personally offended, so make me proud! ;) you dont have to do all of this in a day, or a week, or a month, but you wanna make it routine to at least check Indeed and Glassdoor daily, and maybe send out a few resumes. If you realize that you havent done anything to further your goal in the past few days/weeks or something, no worries! Forgive yourself for being a lazy bitch and hop back on the grind! Every day you arent forcibly pushing yourself towards that goal is another day in hell, what more motivation do you need?

antiwork,fcbuk17,t3_egxaip,1577591133.0,"Very long, but plz read. I hope I can help re-frame your outlook and empower you.

Just quit stupid, don't kill yourself! It might not seem like it, but there are other jobs out there. It might not seem like it, but not all of them are complete trash. It might not FEEL like it, but the world wont grind to a screeching halt if your income ceases for a little while. You're a powerful adult in charge of your own shit, not a weeping little bitch, so you already know you'll recover from whatever financial bullshit. Nobody is going to value your time unless YOU do, so while you're at work pouting about how you're the only gas station clerk in the world who hates his job, why don't you download the Indeed and Glassdoor apps? Let those assholes PAY YOU to shop around for other jobs ON THE CLOCK. Naturally, hide this from co-workers, but do it on the clock nonetheless.

When you get home from work watch a YouTube video on how to make your own resume in Word, then upload it to both profiles. It doesn't matter if you didn't go to college, or this was your only job, or whatever other excuse you're trying to come up with right now. Making a resume almost AUTOMATICALLY puts you above everyone else who doesn't have one. No more and no less than 1 full page. List your name, contact info, school/any certifications, and prior work experience (maybe with a relevant skills section for padding).  It's best if you make your own from scratch and don't use one of the Word templates. Everyone uses the templates, so they effectively see the same resume potentially thousands of times over the course of their hiring process. Having one that's unique, but still all business will make you stand out against the backdrop of grey. Don't outright lie on it, if you HAVE to fluff your shit use half-truths or something that you can explain your way out of in an interview situation. Keep it simple, most potential employers will only skim so ONLY sparce, relevant, bulleted information that's easy to read. Apply to EVERY job that you think you could learn how to do that ISN'T a gas station/somewhere you've worked before. I don't care if you don't THINK you're qualified, if it's a job that only requires you to submit the resume and not spend an hour on a stupid ass application, just fucking do it! You click like one or two buttons and you're THAT much closer to escaping hell. It legitimately does not get any easier than the ""submit your resume"" button on Indeed. The option is there at no additional cost, so you may as well try. I read a jarring statistic about how many jobs were filled by people NOT meeting the company's minimum qualifications (like, 30-50% jarring, though I can't remember the actual number). Use this to your advantage. Maybe you'll get trained in a marketable skill along the way!

Interviews suck, but just know that THEY also know how stressful this shit is for you. Everyone hates finding a new job. Be your best you and if you bomb, just remember that means next time will be much easier cuz you'll know what NOT to do. Button up shirt and khakis with a plain white undershirt from Wal Mart will do you just fine on a budget. Be honest and be friendly. Surprisingly, the person interviewing you is also a human, so be the person YOU'D like to see at an interview for YOUR company and chances are you'll also be the person they wanna see.

Only apply to jobs that pay better than what you make now. If you're gonna lie about ANYTHING, lie at the interview/application about how much you made at your previous job by a buck or two. They use that info to try to screw you with how much they'll offer you, so screw them first! If you haven't already quit yet (and the smart move is to make sure you've already accepted the new position before putting your two weeks in, but just do what wont make you kill yourself lol) then don't tell a fucking soul at work until you're ready to put your 2 weeks in. Blind-side them, fuck it and fuck them too. When I quit CVS I even had to take some of gf's anxiety meds to confront my boss to put in my 2-weeks, but it worked and put me on the level of ""idgaf"" that i need to be on to muscle through a very difficult conversation. If this is an option to you and the idea of quitting gives you anxiety, do it.

Now here's the tough part and the part where you need to realize the universe doesn't just cater to you, BUT you can still work it until it does. You might jump out of the frying pan, into the fire. You might quit your ass of a job only to realize you've been hired somewhere worse. This is a potential that cannot be ignored, and is a reasonably likely outcome, so instead, we plan for it. If you find yourself at another shitty/shittier job than the last, repeat the process until the desired outcome is achieved. Every job lets you get away with being a shitty noob for a little while. Take advantage of that, and collect that easy money while you look for another prospective job. Don't stop until you're at a job that allows you time to heal mentally. Do it 50 times if you have to, but never let them beat you.

Lastly, under NO circumstance during this entire process are you ever allowed to fucking feel bad for yourself. Listen to me, the reason you don't see a light at the end of the tunnel is cuz you're so used to stroking yourself off with depression. Cut the shit. When you start to feel bad for yourself you lose all motivation to try anymore and thats STUPID. You'll literally never escape if you don't try to. You already know feelings are fleeting, some days you have a little more drive to fix shit than others. If you actively kill that drive you're just going to end up suffering for longer. Feeling bad for yourself does not serve you. It never has and it never will, so knock it off. You might not get calls back instantly. You might blow it at your first few to 30 interviews. You might find some success at first and then hit a dry spell. SHIT HAPPENS, BOY! The game is already stacked against you and you know that. There's about a fucking billion things that can go wrong and only 1 desired outcome, so be patient with yourself. We aren't trying to hit the leaderboards here, we're just trying not to lose. You're not a failure, you're a winner that hasn't caught their edge yet, even if you fucking die looking for decent work. You're a failure when you STOP trying. No feeling bad for yourself ever again. We're all done with that useless shit 5ever.

Sorry if it felt like I was being a dick, not my intention. I know you were only venting but you damn well MIGHT kill yourself someday, and I don't necessarily want that to happen. If you kill yourself Exxon, or Mobile, or whatever the fuck employs you wins. They will just coldly replace you and your co-workers will be forced to move on. I watched it happen at my CVS. It happened, then nobody talked about it after a few days. I left a month later and haven't looked back.

Good luck, friend! With a little bit of a back-bone you'll make it out just fine! Feel free to DM me if you want more advice/motivation. I'll help if I can."
