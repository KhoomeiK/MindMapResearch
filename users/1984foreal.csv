We have talks, he shares what goes on in his world, he listens to what goes on in mine.

I just think I panicked for a second because I had so much to prove with my son. I was 20 years old had just started university when I had him and I have been trying to be the single parent strong independent woman type of role model.

But as he grows older, he gets more and more like his father
His mannerisms, his way of speaking, he has siblings at his dad's that I can't give him and I'm just so scared of letting go.

Of letting him be the man I've tried to shape him in to.
