depression,fek5xc2,t1_fejwxf8,1579193284.0,It feels like I'm overwhelmed with emotions and they're all over the place. Like I felt so much better Monday but it's like I popped a depression balloon and now I'm so much worse
depression,fejw309,t1_fejvrwb,1579187185.0,Kinda yes

depression,fd7unzz,t1_fd7ukrq,1578210383.0,Thank you ðŸ’™
depression,fd7uide,t1_fd7smpv,1578210309.0,I do. But everything seems so pointless rn. I'm going to try to go to the park tomorrow. Sometimes that makes me feel better.
depression,fc4esip,t3_efukvu,1577414577.0,I make really dark jokes about my depression and I do it so much that I even do it without thinking. It's just second nature to me. And I did it in front of my therapist the other day. She didn't think it was funny
depression,fc43s55,t3_efrabo,1577405879.0,Nah. I just started seeing a therapist. I have never been to any other mental health professional. My parents don't really take this shit seriously...
depression,fc2hpxw,t1_fc23l67,1577360856.0,Sometimes.
depression,fc232pf,t1_fc230wv,1577338437.0,It's just so hard to remember that..
depression,fbcjzli,t1_fbbse9b,1576725741.0,Thank you! Yeah it was hard starting becuase I have never even considered therapy before. (Although I probably should have) I'm hoping it is what you said about being worse before it gets better.
