fatlogic,fcyqjyk,t3_ejgukk,1578085034.0,You might not lose weight if you still eat a ton.
fatlogic,fclvjjs,t1_fcl3mcy,1577757503.0,"I am reading through the definitions and I’m trying to understand if you are right. What I see is “a right, immunity, or benefit enjoyed only by a person beyond the advantages of most.” So I don’t see where it specifies that the privilege is unearned.

Can you point me in the direction to prove your point. I like to be wrong."
fatlogic,fclr73v,t1_fcli0nx,1577754492.0,Literally blew mind
fatlogic,fcl1xjf,t1_fckzyz4,1577738033.0,"Someone who loses weight gains thin privilege. They can do things fat people cant, and get societal benefits fat people don’t. Just because it is earned doesn’t mean they don’t have advantages."

imveryedgy,fbw7498,t3_eelvqj,1577142455.0,this seems like it is making fun of someone specific. Is there some public figure that has been alleged to have done these things?
PublicFreakout,fbw4roh,t1_fbvrzsm,1577140968.0,"I believe him. I can think of a few scenarios where his story adds up. He didn't see her and was just spitting the gum on the ground, he was pretending to spit on the girl and accidentally spit his gum out, or he was trying to spit the gum in front of the crowd and the girl walked forward. Very plausible"
