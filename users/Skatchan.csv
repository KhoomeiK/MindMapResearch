DebateAVegan,fenjs07,t1_felqvmj,1579286201.0,"Just a minor note. Speciesism necessitates that prejudice is founded purely on the basis of species. For example, I believe that humans generally have more moral value than animals because they are more sentient but that does not make me speciesist. If somehow an animal gained equivalent sentience to a person I would believe that they have the same value."
EngineeringStudents,fecxzya,t1_fec50hj,1578989226.0,"US exams are different to exams in other countries. In the UK 40% is the minimum for a pass and 70% is the lower boundary for the highest 'grade'. The courses are designed to cover stuff in enough depth that if you understand 70% of it then you're doing really well. 

Also almost all universities in the UK do not 'curve' students grades."
facepalm,fdhbq1x,t1_fdh9j4u,1578419527.0,"Okay so here I would argue the moral benefit to ending sheep farming is large enough to outweigh the cost. And to pre-empt any arguments that moral benefits are a bit meaningless, they have been used before to outweigh the costs of something.

I'm going to make a comparison here to clarify my argument. What I am not saying is that the two situations are comparable in awfulness.

The end of legal slavery demonstrates this. While stopping the practice meant that those who owned slaves had to incur the significant cost of actually employing people and those industries where it had an effect incurred significant losses in profitability, the moral benefit of ceasing the practice was sufficient to outweigh this.

Again not saying the two are similar in terms of severity.

So, I believe that the moral benefit of ending the exploitation of sheep outweighs any associated cost but I do not think the moral benefit of giving sheep wonderful lives outweighs the cost that would be incurred by providing this. 

Though, to be fair, the wool industry is probably the area of animal agriculture where the 'symbiotic relationship' idea is most viable."
facepalm,fdh8ajl,t1_fdh6i7l,1578417536.0,"'Killing them' is not the advocated position. We would simple cease to breed more. 

The benefit gained from from carefully farming a sheep for the whole of its natural life is less than the cost and would therefore never be done."

ukpolitics,fcuntes,t1_fcumj80,1577984952.0,"A 2003 legislative audit in Kansas found that the estimated cost of a death penalty case was 70% more than the cost of a comparable non-death penalty case. Death penalty case costs were counted through to execution (median cost $1.26 million). Non-death penalty case costs were counted through to the end of incarceration (median cost $740,000). 

(December 2003 Survey by the Kansas Legislative Post Audit)

In Tennessee, death penalty trials cost an average of 48% more than the average cost of trials in which prosecutors seek life imprisonment.

(2004 Report from Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury Office of Research)

In Maryland death penalty cases cost 3 times more than non-death penalty cases, or $3 million for a single case.

(Urban Institute, The Cost of the Death Penalty in Maryland, March 2008)

In California the current system costs $137 million per year; it would cost $11.5 million for a system without the death penalty.
