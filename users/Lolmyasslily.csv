To give an example for the wording that I think sounds like they mean an increase of base line ability (I hadnt quoted that before; also, highlighted by me):

>By that time, these new cells will have formed functional monosynaptic connections to area CA3 of the hippocampus and polysynaptic connections with efferent sites elsewhere (van Praag et al., 2002). It is presumed that these cells have become integral **units in circuitries used by the brain for learning and memory**. Minimally, it can be concluded thattheadult brain is supplemented with more neurons simply **as a result of new learning.**

Note the second highlight contrasts new learning with the result (the mew brain units in brain circuits), meaning the newly learmed skill likely isnt the result thats sentence topic. Also they emphasize the process of ""new learn-ing"" instead of the newly learned skill itself which implies we're training the process of learning new things. Also the switch to *the **brain** is supplemented with neurons* implies the benefits are, rather than for a specific memory, for a somewhat more general function."

>Of course, individual animals (including humans) tend to learn at different rates. To account for individual differences in learning ability, we typically assess how many trials are necessary for any given individual animal to learn, and have repeatedly observed strong positive correlations betweenthenumberof trialsnecessary tolearn and the numberof surviving cells in that animal’s dentate gyrus (Curlik and Shors, 2011; Waddell and Shors, 2008; Fig. 1). In other words, animals that learn the skill but require more trials of training to do so tend to retain more cells than animals that learn with less effort. Thus, learning appears to have the greatest impact on neurogenesis when the training task itself is challenging, and when the individual animal requires many trials and/or days of training to master the skill"

I also dont agree that rewards are a good system - its useful to say 'make the connection between effort amd reward' on this sub, but if you re shaped by conditioning then ypu still have a heap of trouble.

Stillx theres some point to make with your comment.  Even though I worked alot the result  was that i wasnt 'rewarded' for pushing my limits - it just wasnt hard enough for me. The insidiousness was that all the busywork I did managed to fool me into thinking I had actually challenged myself adequately. Working alot isnt the same as getting out of aftergifted, for that I need to crank up the difficulty as much as possible. 

That gifted people arent able to reap the fruit of true effort is the fault of our brain washing schools. Class sizes, segregation by age; location, time, topics ,learning style are predescribed. Almost nobody, much less the gifted,  will ever put in true effort in that setting."
aftergifted,fdqpyd5,t3_emsjj1,1578672365.0,"I often read dome gifted people have horrible memory . Law school is much more rote memorisation than other majors. Not even studying much is pretty much a guaranteed fail. You picked the wrong subject and didnt even know the winning strategy yet you somehow managed to pass. Thats quite some perseverance in its own right and shows you can work with sparse ressources and under time pressure. These are excellent qualitied fpr a lawyer - its just quite unconvenient that they came alight not because of an above-average case (read case as studies) but due to a shrinkage of your working time below average. If you actually use average working time for the case youd beat it and youd overextend but still manage to win only in tte exveptionally difficult cases. You would also really benefit from memory training - it likely will naturally surge as you study, recall, rehearse, note down from memory. I dont just mean your factual knowledge, but your very base talent of memorisation, retention amd recall. Youve used that much, much less than other students and you might have heard ""use it or loose it"" - the brain adapts to the demands - or lack thereof. I know from personal experience tharßt memory can be increased by alot. Just start writing down or reciting text from memory as accurately as possible, use nback, image streaming and learn some memonic devises. Maybe thisll give you confidence that the bar or whatever goal you set yourself can be reached aslong as youre challenging your wits with such intensive loads that they are forced to adapt to the task theyre failing at."
DualnBack,fdqmzkq,t3_ekbqqn,1578670498.0,"Ive read about the hippocampus on  wikipedia. And I wonder if nback is training the three main functions that are assinged to hippocampus which are memory retrieval - you need to remember the n back item, mental maps - the most discussed variant involved a spatial component and flight-approach conflict redolution - not pressing the button can lead to punishment (being held back or even thrown out of current level, though in the orig study you cant go below 75 % without pushing buttons) or reward (keeping or even imcreasing the level) and the same goes for pressing the button. I measure hiw much my brain is engaged by the amount of memory flashed and head ache I get. And curiously, I had already noticed  my recall and head ache increase again after I pressed a button eventhough I was unsure. Just as if the n back tast works then better fpr me cause my brain cannot handle the uncertainity of punishment and reward and is then hardwired to adapt to the new demand with increased perforation of the area which I suspect to be cause of the headache as a brain trainer having used  a method that can alligiadly massively imcrease cerebral perforation reported headache in the forst 10 days.

I have had severebdepression for 10+ years and was definitely not better compared to the 'average' (lel) case of severe depressiom so I should have the 30 % hippocampal atrophy atleast . I find it curios that an insertion of hippocampal cells in rat brains with severe neurotoxigen lesions in the hippocampal area provides evidence that the hippocampus may play a vital role for memory *retrieval*, but not for *storage* which correlates all *too* well with my experience of memories coming back - I had already thought  if my memories were buried due to hippocampal brain lesions then the hippocampus likely isnt storage of the lost memories unless the brain somehow manages to compress and uncompress memories like zip archives depending on the reduced (lesions) or not reduced (more hippocampal neurogenesis than atrophy)number of neurons available . According to that rat study memories might be largely handled by cirtangular gyrus

Also, some people report better spacial than visual performance; there are also reports of audio/position training not transferring as well to colour/number versions. Also, the effictiveness and choice of the scientist to voice/spacial nback. I do wonder is <the theory that memory is just the same algorythm as or evolved from navigation algorythms> a cause for the benefits from nback, the reports of greater ease amd the nback design of the scientists?

aftergifted,fdey454,t3_ekt554,1578349063.0,"Meh, kinda. My father comes from a poor background, studied and made middle or upper middle class (not sure). His siblings did the same. Their kids grew up with both parents. While I was left by my father in early childhood. I don't know how much my father earned, but back then he would have a shiny middle class car, you know, 'new car' smell, leather seats, air conditioner, the kind of stuff my mums old car didn't. He also had brandname plastic kitchen ware, all kinds of other convenient kitchen ware. Some pretty expensive electrical kitchenware or gadgets, some of these pretty expensive while we had only the cheap thin plastic from one buy, we had only normal pots, dishes and other common utensils, nothing overtly specialised and for machines at most a cheap mixer, a water heater and a cheap coffee filter machine for special occasions. My father went into holidays in typical middle class tourist spot in a foreign country atleast once per year - without me. My mother  could only  take me  into a cheap foreign country outside the typical tourist season and only every couple years. My cousins had big, nice, quiet rooms in big houses while I lived in a small moldy room in a flat my very thin walls where you could hear everything. We weren't poor but my mother always chastised me if I wanted enough fruit or make small purchases so I grew up with the poor mindset anyway and internalised it to the point where I avoided buying anything. If my friends went to lunch I'd think I can't go cause it costs money. I'll make my own bread. However I was and am very  and self-conscious to social differences, so I felt excluded and just didn't feel like joining them with my own lunch. I felt like the odd one out. If there was a course for anything I wanted I'd immediately think: Does is cost money? If yes I wouldn't do it. Would need to save money. Is there food I want? More fruit or vegetable? Costs money, so take less than would be healthy. And so on. Later I wasted a good chunk of that saved up money. I still have an Ebenezer scrooge sitting in my head and I need to remind myself not to save on food. 
My cousins had parents with college degrees at home while I grew up with workers whose general education equals that of a high school dropout. There parents could help them with homework while my mother and later stepdad would first need me to explain them the problem. To be fair I didn't *need* help with homework, but apparently my mother wished I needed and she could provide it, she was big on keeping be dependent and making it about her, and I needed to shut her stupid attention seeking mouth. My mother always made it about her, was cold-hearted to and/or projecting on me, acted as if my matters were about here and then I needed to placate that annoying piece of shit. I'm not against poor or females, I hate my father just as much that fucking authoritarian tyrannical hypocritical  piece of dirt. 

My cousins are all in or on trajectory into careers. 
*I*haven't even studied. Lord I know if I actually was ever gifted then I got my smarts from my father as he thinks like me and  for fucks sakes he must have known what he was gonna do before he did it. Fuck it I believe my father knew it and did it anyway, cause the pregnancy was secretly an accident or whatever? 

I'm always shocked how much I am like my father. I don't know if it's the intelligence the autism or the adhd, two, all or whatever. He's so much like me towards everyone else - except to his own child. If not for that we'd get along better than everyone else, but my father will always see me as the child, not as somebody equal. It only reinforces my decision to  never get children - he's living proof that I'd be absolutely corrupted if I got so much authority about someone especially that person was an untainted me. I'd likely destroy them even with - or exactly because of what I believe to be - the best intentions

There are those people who think their joy depends  on having or not having. There are those who still know their joy depends on doing or not doing.

My favorite although extreme examples for the second type of people are from the anime  one piece. If you don't immediately know what kind of example I'm referring too: Tell me if you've watched it or don't mind spoilers.


Or think of it this way: When confronted with a setback, an overall content person  will have a worse mood, maybe even get somewhat discontent. But what if a person was already discontent and their  situation worsened still? That person might react apathetic because they're numb or, if the situation cracks em, they would really flip out compared to the content person.

Now we need to look at the first paragraph again. Simplistically spoken the having person can be happy if they have, unhappy if they don't have and of course various degrees in-between. The doing person in a pure sense cannot be unhappy since you can always do. No matter how matter the circumstances, you can always do. Unlike in One Piece there are practically no adults who radically operate on doing and not having. But every human at the base finds joy in doing not having, so even those who can't put themselves in that mindset anymore are still happier if they just happen to do more (of what they (*really* like of course, I didn't mention that) instead of just having. The happy working family hobby whatever person you've mentioned would have selfactualised far more than the workaholic who really works so hard - at an often unfulffiling job - in order to distract themselves from the pain, from the hole inside that cannot ever be filled. 

there are those who think they should have.  And there are those people who find joy in working their hardest, leaving most creative most authentic mark on the moment. People who live on the moment  process of getting these things

My answer to the second is: Children are just as quick, sharp and agile as (if not more so) than their adult counter part. They are also capable to discuss about the meaning and the origin of things. Don't forget all the sciences were originally phosophy. Children are constantly are constantly flooded with new experiences from all sides and angles. They are constantly figuring out the unknown, never cease questioning everything, musing about the meaning of this and that. In a sense they are more philosophers than anybody else. Thanks to my good memory I still remember quite a bit from kindergarden and from elementary school - the thoughts and discussions amongst children of all abilities were  curious, truth-seeking, meaningful. It gets stamped out around middle school. Most adults don't have a philosophical knowledge that's significantly more sophisticated than that of elementary students. Most adults stop learning after school and they forget even what little they took from it. Elementary schoolers quickly catch up to them. I don't necessarily mean that adults grasp of philosophical concepts is so little, but I'm more saying children are aware and conceive of so much."

If so, do a simply sport, like calisthenics or running and set yourself a goal that others can do but that you currently cannot hope to. Then work until you can achieve it. That's a guaranteed way to make a connection between reward and effort.

If you're easily addicted to games, then they are a good way also provided you choose a game your giftedness doesn't make too easy. You can practise it, get immediate rewards along the way and it doesn't feel like work (atleast it did to me). Then you can look back and realize on your huge improvements in response to your efforts which have to be the same at any other area you apply yourself to. 

The underlying thought is that every human gets enjoyment out satisfaction of their curiosity and realization of what pops into their head. This doesn't have to be anything society ascribes value to. It can be honed with  gaming, learning an instrument, learning all pokemon and the data of them, spitting cherry seeds, shitting letters. It could be the most 'meaningless' 'immature' shit. The thought is to never care about how worthy xxx thing is. To  care about the fun in the strive for things, to get one more tiny improvement, not making it dependent on wether you actually reach these big goals (holds back super smart kids who've already achieved everything other kids have without trying) But how much enjoyment you gey out of it. Since we grow up in society we'll at some point develop interests and passions that have economic value. Kids have many years before of honing these fundamental abilities. You may allow yourself a similar amount of time to gain these insights and skills about learning and passion on the side. Be constantly aware that to be satisfied that you need to be aware of what you're fantasizing or reading up about about constantly. At one point you will finally notice some. It will then take constant reminding that you need to act these thoughts out right now in this very moment. That it doesn't have to be perfect. That just doing it will give you greater insight and skill at passion and learning. Overtime you will have made some tiny attempts at it. They reinforce what you've always known by a tiny amount it takes some grinding of more tiny reinforcements to finally have enough personal examples to not make your self improvement theory Sound like mere words limited in their persuasiveness. Then you can convince yourself to really pick up a hobby and stick to it. That goes on in feedback loops until you've attacked and replaced bits and pieces of the underlying frame work enough to mostly break with the old habits with only occasional fall backs. From then on you get tons of experience under your belt and the days of lazyness, which always has reasons but never is  true lazyness (otherwise you wouldn't be asking this question), are over. It'll be almost hard to back because you've implemented systemic changes."

I think the relation besides  just the underlying processing power is that n back task requires you see back without actually rehearsing the past n back items  which is like predicting the future only turned around. In both cases the mind access the present stimuli and intuitively knows wether the items has Ben presented one, two, three, four... or more items. Back. Its only seeing and knowing instantly, just like you describe it less as reasoning but as seeing. The training is like calibrating ones needle to a 'weight of familiarity' (just made that up) that n back items (not actual items btw) have based on how far back they're in your working memory (but again you don't actually look wether it's there, you just know and the app gives you feed back and you trib until your intuition starts getting it right majority of the time qualifying it for the next stage) . I suppose if these mental circuits trained by n-back training are used for actual meaningful activities then it could lead in an increase of intuitive thinking towards, still far below it, but towards yours and that it not only raises people's intelligence but that it also retrains people to use and evolve their intuitutive, creative thoughts which we know many people have been trained out of during childhood and school"
Schizoid,fcv1gvk,t1_ezkbwxn,1577992683.0,"Kittymommy just banned me too. I did mention in a comment to some post about feelings of condemnation towards borderliners that I can fully understand and have even devoloped avpd and sometimes close schizoid pd from being raised by someone who practically had similar symptoms to a borderliner eventhough other factors may also have explained alot of their behaviour.

I'm pretty sure though the *actual* **trigger** of the ban is an analysis post of mine about wether people on that and another forum for people raised by people with pd actually have that very same pd. Almost immediately after that post it got deleted and I got banned with the reason ""People with personality disorders aren't allowed to post here"". Couldn't even write them a question asking how they're banning people who don't state their pd or don't even know it themselves.

I'm not even mad I'm too flabbergasted. At first I was like: What? Avpd or schizoid may be called a pd, but it's not the harmful or emotional vampire type. And it doesn't affect my reasoning ability, doesn't complicate contact with me online - if anything I'm more calm, collected, composed, centred and less judgemental than the rest of the population. And our Typ of pd is the complete antagonist of bpd - we've most likely been raised by one and couldn't be more bothered by dramatic, clingy, toxic, intrusive people. One might joke we're more normal and banal and more peaceful and sensitive than the regular population in that regard - almost invisible, most likely to get overlooked and not participate, not to offend or load off our emotions onto somebody.

Am I in the wrong film? And then: You as a mod act just as one would expect if the members of this sub were borderliners themselves. Do you not see the irony? Also: I've been the most reasonable, calm and collected here, if you were gonna kick out everyone with a pd, why are you still mod? Don't stop there throw out every single member, they're all way more harmful to themselves than I would be. Then again a comment in our thread here stating one may not realize just immensely triggering some schizoids are to borderliners and narcissists. So back to our mod, maybe their reaction is a good example for that and if I'm right about their sub the mod may as well have a point to ban me."

aftergifted,fcug5k0,t3_eiygqn,1577980165.0,"I first read the question as: *Is* aftergifted the double whammy of being gifted while growing up with abusive parents?

And my first thought was thats prob a factor in the majority of cases. If we look at Alice Miller's projection theory then any gifted parent who didn't achieve their potential would then somehow project their desires related to it on the kid and harm them in way that would be related to aftergiftedness.

I personally have grown up with abusive parents and in my case the connection with aftergiftedness  is immediately obvious. My parents shut me down if I talked about anything not related to what the neighbours were doing, how annoying the customers were, how annoying their parents were, what the best offers were at the supermarket, 'how school was', 'how work was'. They neglected me if I talked about anything beyond smalltalk. It was odd to say anything else and they wouldn't engage me, they would just point out the oddity ""How do you know that"", ""Where have you read that"", ""Our son is so smart"", ""À child needs to know to shut up when adults are talking"", ""When adults talking the child doesn't get to talk unless asked a question by an adult"" ""À child doesn't get to be right, the adult is always right and even if an adult is wrong or a child disagrees, the child should just be quiet and keep what they know/think to themselves"". They only talked with equal, interest and engagement in the other person when talking with adults. I often wasn't  even allowed to talk, let alone express my opinion. This, despite very high verbal intelligence I never developed socially. And this is more than just conversation. Never having a true self to engage with others (if you engage with them at all) has an effect on feedback loops of learning and discovery (producing info, getting it back reframed, reflecting and producing again) about facts, the environment, other and oneself.

My parents were also highly controlling, highly corrective and punitive parents. You couldnt explore or try and fail at anything without your parents standing behind with grim expression, critical eye.  Anything was a potential threat against the order. Often they'd shout, pull me away from something or take something away as if there was danger or as if I was doing something wrong. For along time I was completely incapable of applying myself to something while people were around. I was always feeling everyone was out there staring, glancing at me when I wasn't looking, silently judging me, a vulcano ready to explode. Without knowing where it came from I would get alot of shame and stress, CPTSD symptoms, and I was paralysed in fear and thought it was hopeless, my energy was drained as if someone had just defeated me , my thoughts were running through my fingers, my body wouldn't follow what I wanted to.  I junped on the bed took my game boy and later my Internet capable computer or smartphone in order to be quiet not stick out, distract myself, get instant gratification with minigames or short endless rows of short articles and forum posts. I felt that way even when nobody was around.

Other story, my father used forced me to ride the bike. He'd force an absolute couch potatoe me to ride at his speed for like five or seven kilometres even though I couldn't do half without my legs just not pedaling anymore when I willed them to and it feeling like torture. But he'd ignore my complaints that I'm exhausted and just *can't* anymore, he'd say he's disappointed and I'm less fit than an old man. And he wod pretend to abandon me , then later drive back to see wether I'm still going at a painful pace. I had no idea where we were I still have a sense of direction that's not far from retardation. This would happen occasionally with a weekz
, two  or more weeks in-between. Everytime I sucked, my father was a hundred times better, disappointed and ranting and I didn't improve at all. It just f drove home that you're either great at sport or you suck. It took me almost twenty years until someone thought me you can actually get better at sport if you do it every second day. That you get more mitochondria and stronger muscle fibres. That even within growing Amy of these two, just from your nerves coordinating the muscles more efficient over time you can lift more. It blew my mind. I tried it out, I verified it was completely true. I started being unable to do a single push-up. I was hardly able to do more than one, two or three push-up for days. For weeks seven push-ups in a row were very good and a set of thirteen was so taxing that the next sets fell back to five, three, two, one push-up. I eventually progress to  push-ups in grips with a 30 kg weight west. Normal push-ups were so effortless it felt I could have done them infinitely. My body had upgraded immensely. And was an important start at my journey of developing a growth mindset. I've had simar experiences with other resistance based and also with aerobic exercises.  It's taken me several years though to achieve anything resembling the learning attitude that other people have had many years ago. For many years I still spend most of my day like the old days. It takes constant work and reading. This are just some though snippets. I'll finish here lest I spend the rest of my day here."

IWantToLearn,fcmq19e,t3_e9glj2,1577786551.0,"After you read something immediately go to your desk and write to down as mucv as you remember. It needs to be as close to the source text as you are able to write. The important thing is to write it down as it forces you brain to engage the structures for remembering. Even if you hardly remember anything, then you write the bits and pieces and the word groups you can remember. If you remember nothing then you write down that you remember nothing. Around half an hour of writing per day is enough. In the beginning it will likely be much less, but after some days it will quickly raise and you'll recall more information than you can write down. At that point don't just write everything down that gets in your head. Write down the info that belongs together. Write down everything your remember about that topic. If you're about to write the last thing you remember about that topic, scène or whatever and you don't have a next point for it, don't stop writing but immediately start writing down about your next thought and again focus on that and write down as much as possible. And now every once in while you'll have thoughts about the previous topic popping up that you haven't written down yet. Immediately switch and start completing the previous topic by noting that down until and any additional memories if they come. Then without stopping immediately go back to the next topic. And so on.

You can also revisit thoughts and texts in your head. Important is not that you see them, only that you're revisit them, even if it's only a vague feeling of having read *something* that just at the tip of your tongue.

Also, while falling asleep remember your day. Progress is like with the other things: Start with nothing and recall every piece you can recall. As you start  recalling to much to be able to go through before falling asleep, focus on getting as much details possible about a specific time or experiences, then jump to the next where you immediately stop and go back to the first if you remember something new to flesh it out

Also do dual n back. It will improve your working memory and increase your ability to recall vivid pictures from dreams. It also increases your fluid intelligence, therefore makes it easier to to understand and connect more information at the same time, which makes it easier to remember. You can also remember more at the same time during the memory exercises. Important is to not rehearse in your mind during dual n back. It has to be intuition. It's not important how many pieces you remember , but that you put a heavy load on your working memory. Think of nothing and when the latest item pops up decide solely on wether it feels familiar and how familiar (the difference between one, two, three, four items back). Normally you start at dual 1-back, thats already quite hard with the right method.

Also start a wholefood plant based diet. Refined fat ( refined = anything that's not a whole plant or ground pulver of a whole plant or another product containing a whole plant), white flour, refined sugar, animal protein are super harmful. They raise inflammation levels that harm the brain. They build up plaque in the vascular system which leads to microinfarcts in the brain all the time (never mind the risk of severe infarcts). At the same time a standart diet is lacking lots of fibre, minerals and vitamins and antioxidants. Look up the China study book from Colin T Campell

Aerobic and résistance based exercise. The positive effects on the brain and cognition can hardly be overstated. Especially the memory, but pretty much the whole brain profits from this enormously. Your goal for aerobic exercise should be 30 min (of running or swimming for example) per day. Strength (I.e. resistance based) exercise three two four times per week. Though if your trained you can eventually do a whole session almost everyday. Don't forget stretching. It's very relaxed so it can be done before going to bed without disturbing your sleep routine. 

There we're talking about sleep. Sleep is super important. Get your 8-9 hours of sleep. Have a red-light filter on your phone and pc several hours before you go to bed. If possible, do not do exercise several hours before bed. Both will make it harder to fall asleep. Go to bed and stand up at regular times. 

Meditation is also super helpful. Lots of studies have been done, but I have no experience with it, so I can only point to them.

There's tons of knowledge about yourself and your preferred learning methods just waiting to he discovered and the best way to do it is your own selfchosen and self-directed project. If you have no direction or idea what to do then this would also be an excellent opportunity to build a sense of identity.

There's tons of free material online that you don't need to register, for especially regarding STEM. I remember for example Harvard offering free computer science education online. If your parents are professors then you must have a University somewhere around. You can ask your parents what you need to do in order to get to sit in some lectures. In my country we have public universities and you usually can just go and ask the lecturers nicely or you can get a guest membership card that lets you attend all lectures (but not seminars, meetings, tutorings, etc) for like 80 bucks per year. You could also get some hard books from the university library - there could be atleast *some* books that challenge you  even if you are more than just mildly gifted (which I think has  been implied, correct me if that's wrong) . You could also look for research papers on  scholar.google.com  and download them for free on gen.lib.rus.ec/scimag

I've also recently read a comment somewhere on r/gifted that said to basically walk up to some researcher that is working in a field you are interested in and reading up upon. Talk to them. If you show the technical foundations and the comprehension of their studies then an apparently unwritten code of ethics applies that says the researcher now has to help you to get a foot in that area at some point. Of course that's not what you're asking for, but if they're so bound to opening science to capable newcomers then maybe that also extends to whatever a feeble PhD might be able to do in order to help you get some practica or student lecture? 

I dunno if you've  read the recommendations on this sub reddit for Dabrowski's theorie of positive disintegration. I thought I'll mention it anyway. 

You might also write on r/gifted
There's this u/graficat who is just one of the users frequenting the sub that I've regularly seen giving detailed and engaged answers that were usually judged as very helpful by the respective ops."

 I'd been doing the it wrong too, it seems doing it right is the exception .
If you've read the quote by now, I'm avoiding it by looking around the screen with they eyes until the next item comes. I deliberately try to not focus on the last square and have as little conscious thought as possible about the previous items. That makes it harder for me - Ive fallen from dual 4 back back to only mastering dual 2-back and failing dual 3-back. But it makes alot of sense that to get more fluid 'raw' inteligence you can't be thinking consciously, with prepared intelligence as to speak,  in order to get a better result, you just have to 'just know it* intuitively, without being immediately aware of the thought process that lead up to it; that seem to reflect pretty much every post I've read so far on from gifted people regarding their divergent and multilevel thinking on which they can *additionally* let these strategies run that I've mistakenly abused while trying to improve the base below them . 

I have to say I feel much more focused after half hour of doing it her way. No comparison to the last three or four days after which I still felt as foggy as before eventhough I could boast a higher, but now obviously meaninglessly so, number. I've honestly felt even a bit sharper, faster, more aware and focused though - after just one session -  that might have just been my depression and anxiety lifting. 

One thing I can say after this session, I'm not as fast on the uptake  as I thought. Certainly not gifted or even superior level. I believe my rather good memory and a love for learning had boosted my verbal comprehension and my crystallised knowledge so much that I was extremely far above the other kids in my age group. That was shown by one iq test, but the same and another test also showed that my fluid intelligence was only high average, maybe slightly above (technically superior, but not in a practical sense).

Also recently came about  books called ""The brain that changes itself"" and ""The woman who changed her brain"". There's also 'project renaissance', especially with image streaming

Gifted,fcadvz8,t3_ckkwtu,1577567569.0,"Fluid intelligence is closely related to working memory as the number of connections that can a person can effortlessly conscious of at the same time is currently  seen as one of the decicive factors for the depth of reasoning processes. Many studies show deletive effects of cannabis on working memory in young adults.

And I know from personal experience that a combination of high depression and anxiety can turn an otherwise smart person into someone they or authors can hardly even recognize as the same person. If we're talking about dual n back, my performance goes from dual n-5 down to dual n-1 - and even at dual n-1 I'd  frankly perform like I had a severe case of early onset dementia.

 It's also accepted fact that fear, which anxiety disorders are nothing else but, reduce activity in the prefrontal cortex which mostly used for reasoning. The evolutionary advantage was that instead of being all relaxed and contemplating the best choice in front of the cave tiger you'd be running head over heels as fast as you could go - you don't need a home sapiens brain to immediately escape or, for sake of completion, fight back . The same goes for anxiety. In bouts of anxiety you only want to flee from the trigger or eliminate it, your thinking capacity is throttled.

And alcohol surely doesn't help your case.

Now I'm not saying *everything* has to have affected your performance in a *significant* way and skewed the results. It's not that one-dimensional and I'm not even a professional. But if you really want to be sure then this would some reasons to retest, though make sure you avoid the practise effect. Ideally don't take the same test (and/or) have some months preferably years in-between"

On the other hand society makes it so that the ones who are behind don't necessarily get the time and energy to catch up. 20+ years that could have been fully spent on learning and personal growth, but that have been wasted instead, are now to be caught up on during the hours that you take a break from your job at a well known fast-food restaurant chain or otherwise battling with poverty, authorities and whatnot."

ADHD,fc3obcl,t1_fbltj7w,1577394532.0,"Iq tests aren't worthless. They can be used to diagnose learning disabilities, they can be used to give a detailed profile of one's strengths and weaker points. They also can give people answers, cause honestly most people realize even without an iq test wether they are more in tune with others or wether they're off to some degree. If a person with good results feels so depressed that this is a light in their miserable life, more power to them. If somebody has a serious problem with  an average score then they already had a shaky self-esteem and now have the opportunity to figure out which kind of thinking leads to this misery and how to apply this insight to their everyday life and thinking in a way that benefits them. Same goes for the one with the high score. Everytime they have self-doubt about starting a supper difficult learning activity they can take a glance at the paper and work on reassured that they're *not* just a fraud who will fail to learn this. And after having been through whole learning self realization cycle a few times the may realize its the way that matters and they may never look at their iq score again."

When ever there's a ressource mentioned that interests you look up the book for free on the Internet or get it from the library. Read it and look up every term, number, symbol, whatever you don't understand. That can be multiple things per sentence,  especially in the beginning. If you want to improve your retention: directly after reading write down as much as you can remember, kinda like a dream diary for lucid reading. Just as fast as possible, as detailed as possible. Important is just to write even if you hardly remember. 

 For me I've found I lost my passion because at some point books weren't deep and abstract enough anymore. I thought that all books were like that and that I had practically outgrown nonfiction books cause I thought of books only in terms of what our small town library and bookshop presented to me (I never left my town by myself) . Like if we're thinking about history books, all our stores or library had to offer we're time lines of what happened when. Or popscience books about pharaos, knights, castles, etc. Don't get me wrong, I didn't think I knew it all, I just couldn't have cared less about surface level information anymore. Less breadth, more depth, more clarity. I stopped reading as much e nonfiction as I had before. 

Only at 20+ have I been introduced to scientific papers and books. I find I enjoy reading about and  figuring out novel, foreign, detailed and complex topics. I find it exhilarating spending an hour clicking myself trough Wikipedia in order to look up twenty different concepts from chemics, physics, math, whatever that are required to make sense of of the fuck they are writing about on that page. Even better since I've started stumbling about stuff in texts and real life that I can now put under the umbrella of a technical term I've picked up over the last weeks. I found that's the reason I was so addicted to learning at a young age. I had lost that in fifth or sixth grade at the latest. I'm so glad to have rediscovered that love for learning again."
