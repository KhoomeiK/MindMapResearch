solar,ff3wt0f,t1_ff34nxo,1579550565.0,"hardly any utility-scale solar plants these days are being built WITHOUT single axis tracking, as the costs of the trackers have come down so far, shifting the cost/benefit equation in favor of trackers. i would be very surprised if this was without.

having said that, these are bifacial modules. the best way to get the most output out of the back side is to control carefully where it's pointed and the reflective qualities of the substrate that it's pointing to."
solar,ff3wjwy,t3_ercn0o,1579550406.0,"> While details of the project's tariff were not revealed, Kahramaa president Essa bin Hilal Al-Kuwari said the firm had bagged a “competitive unit price for electricity produced from the solar PV power plant, which (sic) price is currently the lowest in the world for such a project.” 

no doubt a very worthy project, but: 

a) if the numbers are so great, why not just release them?

b) the project is not built yet, easy to make statements, hard to deliver on them.

my experience after many years in utility-scale solar: so many claims, so much BS. i'll believe the numbers when i see them. along with proof that they are not subsidized by the government in Qatar, very common in the Middle East."

solar,fe2fw11,t1_fe2f1n4,1578837930.0,"Sorry but your numbers are way off. The cost of large scale PV generation is down to $0.17/kWh (e.g. City of Los Angeles, 2019 long term PPA) and around $0.30 all in, with Li battery storage, not $0.70. CSP is probably $0.50 - $0.70/kWh. I am on mobile just now, but check the latest levelized cost of energy (LCoE) Numbers from Bloomberg New Energy Finance, BNEF.

Edit 0.017/kWh for large scale solar"
solar,fe2ew5x,t1_fe2ctqi,1578837630.0,"Spain’s solar policy has gone up and down, and is now friendly again. But Spain is at best a medium sized market on the global level. Abengoa was selling worldwide. It has little to do with one market, mostly the fact that the technology is super expensive and fussy and costly to maintain. Don’t forget that most renewables investments are not driven by governments but by private investors. If they can make money, investments will flow. If not, they run for the hills, which was the case with CSP. Simply not viable commercially. The markets are very efficient in terms of renewables investments."

solar,fe1072h,t3_enl7jk,1578820957.0,"Concentrating solar, not solar photovoltaics. Major differences, concentrating has been uncompetitive for years: very high initial capital cost (3x to 5x vs. solar pv, even at utility scale), much higher maintenance costs. The world’s largest supplier of concentrating, Abengoa of Spain, went bankrupt a few years back, no wonder. On a global basis, plain solar pv installations are probably 10x concentrating. The technology is simply not competitive, but please don’t confuse it with solar pv."

German,fdpu5h0,t3_emdsgp,1578640596.0,"French is spoken in Geneva. They may understand some High German, but don't count on it.

If you speak High German, don't expect to understand Swiss German, as 90% of native German speakers don't. Swiss German is a 300 year old dialect that did not go through many of the reforms of modern High German. So Swiss German has 1) different words 2) different word order 3) different and non-standard grammar, no written, agreed orthography and above all 4) very different pronunciation.

On top of this, you have several major and differing dialects within Switzerland. The Swiss German spoken in the Oberwallis or Bern is very different from that in Basel or St. Gallen, even the Swiss have difficulties sometimes with those first two regions."

German,fdjoi4w,t1_fdjk10g,1578480914.0,"i second this heartily. if you want to learn a few phrases fine, but forget grammar or structure or any real foundation in the language. the Langenscheidt courses on German are excellent, available on Amazon i believe. usually a book combined with a CD/ downloads. learn grammar if you want to learn German. and trust me, German grammar is HARD and requires tons of practice and repetition.
