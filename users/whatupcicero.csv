But convincing them that social issues are of the highest importance has been the right’s strategy; ...

This is entirely wrong. The right’s strategy is all about economics with farmers. Most farmer’s are chill as hell and accepting of different people (for example, Iowa is a fairly progressive state and the overall moderate position of the state is why it’s an important swing state). However, they’re not chill with paying more taxes to support social programs because a lot of their profit margins are razor-thin and farming equipment and land is very expensive to maintain and pay taxes on."
