TrueFilm,ffekxzr,t1_ffegunn,1579852404.0,"Engaging with the works of auteurs is better when you're on the same wavelength as they were when making the film, so you can enter into conversation with it as an equal as opposed to letting loose stab-in-the-dark fan theories."

TrueFilm,ff3tyau,t1_ff2lrbo,1579548788.0,I'm literally just quoting the director. Idk if they do that in your YouTube level discourse though so I get the confusion/hostility.

ExMoCringe,fdmy46q,t3_em8mce,1578570947.0,Dude bringing up the Mountain Meadows Massacre to justify getting angry at a church for protecting kids is peak Walnut brain. One of perhaps the last and most meager intelligences to be organized into man.

lds,fdljorj,t1_fdl31d9,1578525519.0,"Very much agree. Feminism is a really diverse thing with many many subgroups and sections. Stiletto/lipstick feminism is different from Fourth Wave Feminism which differs too from New Feminism (basically what the church is), and those groups may have pretty deep divides between them.

Almost everyone who isn't a full misogynist would honestly be considered some kind of feminist, including traditional conservative members of the church."
ExMoCringe,fdiyb7q,t3_eld012,1578453828.0,"Look at his post history, it's nothing but vitriol for the church... Like this kid has no dimensions to him at all aside from hating something he isn't even a part of? Wasted life tbh"

todayilearned,fc1r84s,t1_fc1qss1,1577327161.0,"I don't think it's that simple. Look at the masterpiece that is THX1138. It's edited very well but very esoterically, the film is very unpalatable to uneducated audiences. George's tastes were at this period Avant garde, this suits a film like THX but not star wars. Also he was approaching it as a director and not an editor, and he was working with someone new on Star Wars. It could have been a difficulty in communication. He could have been too used to the free flowing style of Murch and unable to quickly adapt. There are lots of things that could point to a bad first cut, but simply calling one of the greatest, most aesthetically intelligent directors of his era bad at editing is reductive as hell."
todayilearned,fc1pmhp,t1_fc1ov00,1577325730.0,"Yeah, dude revolutionized the post process in multiple decades. He came from an art film background so I don't doubt his first cut of Star Wars was less than a crowd pleaser but to pin it on his lack of editing chops is pretty funny."
