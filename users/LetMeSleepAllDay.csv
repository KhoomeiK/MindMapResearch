If someone enjoys flipping a coin over and over and considers that fun all the power to them, but that doesn’t make coin flipping a good game. People can enjoy bathing in piss and shit too—that doesn’t mean that practice actually holds any value. Again, I’m not saying monopoly is shit or anything, I just had something to say about why not all gatekeeping is bad."

Unfortunately, the compensation difference is disproportionate, even with education factored it, as someone with greater knowledge—like a PhD in Chem or something—won’t be paid as much until they work for a commercial industry. That’s where supply and demand become important."

Russia and Germany are to blame for WW2. I never blamed America. 

But the point of reddit isn’t to talk solely about the post. Comment chains often change and delve into other related or unrelated tangents. It’s not shifting the blame or distracting from an issue. It’s just talking about two things at once. I don’t know why you’re so mad... maybe you should get that blind patriotism looked at.

Looking at your post history, you’re a raging idiot with one Wikipedia link in his holster who sees red whenever someone mentions the USA. Typical."
