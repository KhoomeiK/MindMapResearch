Sure, wannabe.

Next time try to use your clinical acumen and see if you can diagnose pneumothorax without chest X-ray. Then try to place a chest tube with rigged parts on an unsteady surface, simulating a plane ride, and then talk.

Pigtails are usually placed by IR. Surgery occasionally may use pigtails. 

You’re either a pretender or a wannabe.

Don’t pretend. You’ve never done these procedures.

There is no need for dissection when placing central line. Same with pigtails. 

The only “dissection” is making a small superficial incision to facilitate smoother movement. Once the needle traverses the skin, it goes fairly smoothly. 

But whatever. I’m not going to sit here and quibble with you on your techniques.

As for the coat hanger, I can see the need for blunt dissection. The ends of a coat hanger are fairly flat, not tapered and as sharp as a pigtail introducer and not anywhere near as sharp as needle."
