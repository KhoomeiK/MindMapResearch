She also gave great advice on how to use LinkedIn to your advantage (like how recruiters search for candidates and what you should write on your profile to get the most eyes), and put yourself out there. Also, practical things like negotiating salary. And most of all, not selling yourself short, which was something I really had to overcome in order to make a change. It's hard to switch somewhere you might not have experience, and they can help you translate your experience to whatever you want to do.  
>  
>I wouldn't have taken the change seriously if it weren't for her. I'm not making a huge change, just a slightly different path, but I'm now looking for jobs that are actually good for my personality, which was a huge for me because she's someone who isn't telling you what they think you want to hear. Asking friends and family which path is right for you is hard because they'll just say what you are already doing because they don't want to give you bad advice.

Thanks, this is what I hope to get out of it.  I have been doing what I've been doing for a long time and I'm good at it, but I am not happy.  I thought it was the company but now I'm thinking it might be the industry... but that's what I'd like to figure out.  Honestly I've never really been happy working and I'd love for that to change."

I finally told them that is how my face looks when I'm thinking or focused and I'd appreciate they did not comment on my appearance and they stopped.  

I'm a friendly person, but I guess I look like a bitch lol."

I work in the fashion industry and her designs get nitpicked more than I've ever seen... in fact one of her lines she has had to redo three times.  Yesterday the line got basically picked completely apart and later in the day our boss took a brand away from her to ""focus"" on this one.

I feel so bad for her, but at the same time we work together (I'm sourcing) so now I'm having to redo this line AGAIN with her and I'm getting punished too.  It's more than annoying."

I ended up finding a new job because I couldn't work the hours they needed due to my commute and my husband's travel schedule and picking up our daughter."

My parents live 8 hours away so they were pretty easy to manage, but my in-laws live close by and we have had to have a few come to Jesus meetings with them.  Eventually when our daughter was about 2-3 and they wouldn't follow our schedule with her and also started calling asking to have her over for the weekend because it was ""their weekend"" (WTF do you have custody?) we had to put a full no contact for about 6 months.  

They have been much better behaved since."

careerguidance,feknrn6,t3_epks1q,1579203887.0,"In my experience, working for a larger company has been a better experience.  The pay is much better and raises are more frequent.  Training, which still not adequate was better at a larger company.  Having an HR department was also a plus.

I'm in a smaller, family owned company right now and I would not recommend it.  They ""forgot to tell me"" when they hired me that I make more than they wanted to pay and because of that I won't be getting any annual increases.  They allow a ton of bad behavior - recently one of our graphic designers was caught freelancing on company time... at the same time he told us he wouldn't ""have time"" to create a single marketing piece for a new brand launch.... and somehow did not get fired.  Unbelievable.  I definitely have less stress work-wise at this company, but the drama isn't worth it."

She found a really pretty dress but her top 3 colors were black (What my bridal party was wearing), and both of my wedding colors so she'd look like some weird flower girl or something.  Those were the three colors I asked her not to choose and that's what she sends me.

She ended up with a really lovely light dusty teal, I thought it looked great!  I also paid for her to have her hair and makeup done with everyone else and she still almost 10 years later still says she ""felt her ugliest that day"".  Awesome."
