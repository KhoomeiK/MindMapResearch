gaming,ffceicg,t3_esrh6p,1579797736.0,"Personally, I would want to see Legacy of Kain make a proper resurgence like Tomb Raider and Deus Ex did in the early 2010s. Hell, with how time works in that series, they could have the reboot also technically be a sequel to the events of the original continuity.

Though given that Crystal Dynamics is currently shackled to making Avengers games (is that still a hot commodity after the semi-finality of Endgame?), I doubt we'll see any hints of a Legacy of Kain resurgence any time soon, or any Tomb Raider stuff for that matter. And given that Eidos Montreal is also working on the project, that means we're probably not going to see any continuation of the current arc of Deus Ex either.

Thing is, even if the Avengers games do turn out to be pretty cool, it still won't justify the absence of a new Tomb Raider or Deus Ex. Though with that said, given that it's been a while since Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Mankind Divided, when we do eventually get a new Tomb Raider and Deus Ex, they'll at least be somewhat distinct from the previous games, since design philosophies change over time."
gaming,ffccfw1,t3_estzk0,1579796449.0,"In Fallen Order, Vader is more like Jason Voorhees, giving his sequence a vibe akin to that of a horror experience, which is unexpectedly refreshing in its way. He demonstrates that no matter how far Cal has come since Bracca, our boy is still no match for the Dark Lord of the Sith. Even with Cere Junda calling down the thunda, the two of you can just barely hold him off, only just buying enough time to make your escape.

I feel like that is one of the best portrayals of Vader, at least in gaming. He is not the final boss. You already fought the final boss, and he simply one-shotted them. He is an order of magnitude above anything you've faced so far. He is an unstoppable force, and a memento mori for the player. As he should be."

Also, I feel like rather than changing the product to be worse because the good version is bad for you, we ourselves should find a way to change as well, so that we can end up being able to have our cake and eat it.

One way would be to further study the mechanisms of moderation and self-control, then devise a therapy that makes people superhuman in regards to those processes, so that the patients are able to resist all but the greatest of temptations and addictions. Being able to say ""just one"" and commit to it should not be something we have to rigorously train ourselves for: it should be something we can simply install into our very being.

Another way would be to devise a method by which humans are resistant to the deleterious effects of exceeding our mortal RDA of sugars and carbohydrates, but can still very much survive on a diet where those nutrients are a footnote relative to the other stuff we need. Said method would need to reduce the amount of sugar that could be laid down as fat when blood sugar reaches a certain level, so that excess sugars are simply scrubbed out of the blood by the liver and kidneys. That said, however, that method would probably overlap with the mechanism of insulin and diabetes, so while enhanced liver and kidneys would potentially be a factor to consider, an enhanced pancreas would also be up for consideration. Research into the mechanism of insulin resistance, and how to reduce said resistance in cells, would also be needed."

Though perhaps I was inaccurate in saying ""govern"", since Canada seems to be governing itself well enough despite being a big place. While I said ""govern"", what I meant to say, but wasn't thinking about the right word, was ""control"". Because that's what Russia and China seem to be obsessed with: authoritarian control, rather than more nuanced and liberal governance that isn't nearly as stifling and oppressive.

And in that regard, countries of such size are too large to outright control. There's just too much land to cover, since evenly distributed control would spread their resources too thinly."

worldnews,fecgoey,t1_fecdcfi,1578973480.0,"Funnily enough I was going to slip that in earlier, but I'm a little on the fence about it.

On the one hand, the US is a pretty big place, even if not nearly as big as Russia (though again, most of Russia's land territory could be considered ""empty calories"" regarding population distribution). And if there was some sudden division that split the country straight down the middle, I reckon that the West Coast would probably be able to govern and protect itself well enough. Though if an East-West division did suddenly happen, it would be better if it happened AFTER the internal fragmentation of Russia and China, rather than before.

But on the other hand, for all of its problems it's still a lot more free than the Eastern Blocs. You can actually talk shit about the party and not be arrested, last time I checked. Also, while a lot of its problems are internal (that I can't deny), some of its problems are the result of external interference and manipulation, whether by Russian insurgency or Murdochian media. Even if we didn't nip those particular problems in the bud, the US would still be a better place to live in than Russia or China.

That's my two cents on the matter. Though even if an East-West division of the US did somehow happen (it'll probably be a long while before that happens), something tells me that the American ideals of freedom would still exist in both the Pacific States and the Atlantic States."

I mean, I'm ok with a long journey so long as I'm in good company, since I'm usually seeing things I haven't seen before if I'm taking a long journey (I don't get out much).

I wasn't ready to live away from home at the time, and the commute from my area to the Docklands just kept wearing me down, making me contemplate whether it was actually worth a damn. After careful evaluation, it turned out that it wasn't, so I got out of there before my student loan got any bigger.

Thankfully nowadays, my ""commute"" to work is just a 5 minute walk, and while my job isn't quite my dream job (I'm nonetheless grateful for it), it doesn't give me an existential crisis where I'm having to weigh what I have to put in versus what I'm getting out of it."

I'm bound to be outspoken on this topic, but if they make it to Kingdom Hearts 4, they should bring back more Final Fantasy worlds to balance out the Disney aspect. And considering what Disney owns nowadays, it'd be wise to include visits to Marvel and Star Wars worlds before the revolution happens."

Or alternatively, we could just stick them in burial pods and use their bodies to nourish new trees, with the same plaques installed. Either method would make much better use of such tragic wastes of flesh and bone. Those resources could be used for such wonderful purposes once we remove their unfixable operating systems."

It would not be in the public interest, and especially not global interest, to let self-serving parasites get off so sickeningly lightly.

Basically, if crooked executives end up becoming scarecrows of flesh and bone, rather than simply being denied their severance, that would certainly ""curtail"" the amount of skeevy businessmen we'd have to tolerate in our world, whether they have a ""magical change of heart"" or are properly turned into visceral art installations as a warning to any other would-be self-serving parasite scum.
