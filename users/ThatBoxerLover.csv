Dogfree,ff3ma6w,t1_ff3l49z,1579544079.0,Dogsbite.org is a bullshit website that has already been proven to have biased statistics.
Pets,fezo3uf,t1_fezlj7y,1579459551.0,"Dogs don't really get mad if another dog doesn't want to play with them. They can act persistent, but it's not really out of anger. I believe that it is more of a dominance issue. Really the only thing I can suggest is that you take them both to a reputable trainer that deals with these kinds of issues. I would also suggest that you keep a close eye on both of them and as soon as Elsa even appears to begin to start acting out you separate her from Roxie. But I'm no trainer so I can't really tell you for certain on how to deal with this kind of situation."
Pets,fezknfo,t3_eqzw0c,1579458321.0,Did you ever socialize Elsa? Or take her to puppy daycare?

Pets,fedhapb,t3_eolhav,1579011501.0,Damn. Has animal control ever been sent out to her place?
aww,fe452qf,t1_fdw7y4w,1578855860.0,I believe it is part of the whelping box. I think it is to help keep the mother from rolling onto her puppies.
aww,fdsp208,t1_fdsdy7u,1578706101.0,PETA is shit

Pets,fdku3bw,t1_fdkcefp,1578511181.0,"If your landlord says no dofs or cats then no dogs or cats. However, what you can do if you really want one that badly is to get a prescription from your doctor that you are to have an ESA."
Pets,fd9g360,t3_ek6hjp,1578232898.0,Just kick them out if it's your house.
aww,fcqmrft,t1_fcp43c2,1577888748.0,Some do. My Dane actually enjoys the vet so we never have a problem with taking him there. My cat is also super chill so when a friend of mine takes her to the vet on occasion she always comes back saying how much the vets there love her.
Pets,fcal3i0,t3_egrr77,1577571347.0,My catâ€™s name is Fireball.
BoxerDogs,fc64xr4,t3_egencv,1577472365.0,I had to do a double take because he/she looks just like my late Willow when she was a puppy.
greatdanes,fbw6fvc,t1_fbv630h,1577142026.0,Bet the dog was going through worst things than having cropped ears.
