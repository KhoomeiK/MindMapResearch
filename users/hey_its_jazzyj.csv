selfharm,fdccrma,t1_fdcc52p,1578271758.0,"preach! for real though, just the idea is relaxing. i mean i’m only in high school so i don’t have MUCH life experience but i would say follow your passion and what makes you happy. sounds cheesy but i’ve seen too many people be influenced by society and end up in a job they hate. anyways, it was nice talking to ya! thanks! :))"
selfharm,fdcbisr,t1_fdcayna,1578270987.0,"god some moms are just so aggravating (my mom haha) they yell at you for anything and everything. not to mention blaming you for everything when you have nothing to do with it. thank you! hopefully all goes well. i know right! my bed just be looking extra comfy. i’ve thought of that several times too. seems like a nice way to go but i know i have too much to live for, and so do you. i wish you the best friend! if you ever wanna talk im here :)"

selfharm,fdc9nwk,t1_fdc8sb7,1578269853.0,"i really felt that to the core. on behalf of the disabled community we thank you :) it is a hard job, so i’ve heard. would you consider having a heart to heart with your parents? you never know what could happen. i have a lot of conflicting things right now as well. i’m getting surgery to straighten my left eye that i literally can barely see out of, i’m not sure if i’m eligible to drive until the surgery, high school fucking sucks, and with all my mental instabilities it’s really hard to process anything. sorry for ranting but just a little background haha. i’m so exhausted, i wouldn’t mind taking an eternal nap..."
selfharm,fdc6y3x,t1_fdc6mk3,1578268308.0,it’s like we’re totally okay with the way we’re feeling because it “normal” and we don’t find anything wrong with it. i’m glad that you have these great things in your life. i hope the same for myself in the future.

selfharm,fdc31sz,t1_fdbwioo,1578266107.0,this is crazy because i’ve never been able to put it into words. i feel bad sometimes because i know i deserve better but i honestly could care less... i don’t want to get better either :/
selfharm,fdbnv00,t1_fd9h0z7,1578259226.0,i totally felt that. i would put myself in danger on purpose so i could see if something would actually happen. it’s crazy how numb i feel to these feelings.

depression,fd8cisa,t3_ejx4cu,1578216836.0,"or the “you have everything, why are you ‘sad’?” people are just ignorant, so this is why we must educate older and future generations about these problems."
Anxiety,fd8c31t,t1_fd8bjii,1578216635.0,"oh gosh. i’m sorry :( i totally get it. it sucks because no one ever really understands how it feels, so thanks for that? haha. do you think investing in a weighted blanket might work? idk i feel like it’s a good idea but then what if i suffocate or something?"

depression,fd84f5b,t1_fd7zrtg,1578213806.0,"i’m sorry i’m a little slow here. if you don’t mind me asking, what borderline? that’s the thing, i’m not even sure what my personality is anymore. i cant even decide, if that makes sense."
