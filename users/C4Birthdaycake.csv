unpopularopinion,fd6rwiw,t1_fd1cajc,1578194962.0,"China has interests to protect (read: oil) in Saudi Arabia, a Sunni Islam state, which would be a target for Iran, a Shia Islam state. Iran is one of the few things that China and the US can agree upon. Russia probably wouldn’t want to piss off both the US and China by supporting Iran and jeopardizing the US and China’s access to Saudi oil.

Edit: After doing some more research, I came to realize that Russia is something of a wild card, though they & China will likely stay out of the conflict if it happened."
unpopularopinion,fd6njjl,t1_fd44opt,1578193474.0,"We supported the White Army because Lenin and Trotsky wanted to use the unstable socioeconomic climate created in the aftermath of WWI to incite communist revolution in Europe. Our support of the White Army was reasonable, as the Bolshevik party wanted to destroy capitalism, and indeed every ideology other than itself, and didn’t try to hide it. 

The US’s use of the atomic weapon solely as a show of power to the USSR is debatable, and the alternative to the Atomic bombings was a ground invasion, which would have been much more costly (both in money and in blood), and experts estimate a ground invasion would have lengthened the war by at least a year. While the atomic bombings were bad, an extra year of senseless slaughter would have been worse.

However, you do have a point about the US propping up dictatorships. For example, In Vietnam, we supported Diem when, frankly, Ho Chi Minh probably was a better leader, and in Operation PBSUCCESS, the CIA staged a coup of a democratically elected president of Guatemala (who wasn’t even communist) partly because of (drum roll please)...Bananas (seriously, look it up). 

Additionally, freedom of speech came to blows with the US’s anti-communist sentiment, most famously in the Palmer trials and the McCarthy era.

In conclusion, whether or not the US was the good guy or the bad guy of the Cold War is based entirely on opinion, but these are just the facts."

unpopularopinion,fd6f8nh,t1_fd0oslf,1578190080.0,"During WWI, farms were greatly expanded to feed the soldiers in the trenches. When the war ended, the expanded farms were able to produce more grain, reducing the price of grain, which in turn contributed to the Great Depression, which, no matter how you spin it, cannot be described as “good for business”

Edit: though it is undeniable that for companies that deal in arms & munitions, war means profit."
unpopularopinion,fd6cdw0,t1_fd0fayd,1578188821.0,"The US once staged a war game to simulate a war between the US and Iran. It was called the “Millennium Challenge 2002”, between the “Blues” (representing the US) and the “Reds” (representing an unknown middle eastern enemy that was obviously supposed to be Iran). The Reds were commanded by retired USMC Lt. Gen. Paul K. Van Riper. He was allowed to use short range rockets, small motorboats, and motorbikes and other assets that Iran would have had at the time. The Reds used their small boats to find Blue’s fleet, and launched a massive cruise missile barrage, sinking sixteen ships (including an aircraft carrier, which would be a very large blow to any navy). Had the simulation been an actual war, that would have equated to 20,000 American deaths on a single day. The Reds then sunk more US ships with suicide boat attacks. The Reds also dispatched orders by motorcycles and flashes of light, effectively rendering Blue’s signal jamming and interception equipment useless, and all of this had taken place before Blue managed to land troops on Red’s soil. But, in the end, the Blues did win, though at heavy cost."
