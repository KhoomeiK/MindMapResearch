DIY,feup8td,t1_fetx2xz,1579388715.0,"Its honestly impossible to tell. Spores are extremely resilient that's why the exist. If they were not ""killed"" then at the first chance they have they will activate and colonize. Because the spores are inside a wall by the bathroom that means that if like most people the owners of that house don't use their exhaust as they should and the bathroom gets super humid the spores on the stud will probably become active. There is a reason why removal is always recommended because killing spores is SUPER hard. Hence why even when you kill them we always recommend to follow it with encapsulation.  

Fungi need food + dark and water to colonize. The inside of a wall by a bathroom is the best place to be fungi. Even if those walls are went they will absorb enough moisture from humidity of people take hot showers there."

A few things I would've done differently in your scenerio: 

If your client declines removal always make sure you document that on paper!! I have seen little contractors get sued all the time over mold. 

For wood materials like studs sand the wood until fresh wood is revealed. Make sure you HEPA vac as you sand. 

For gypsum first HEPA vac the surface then treat with a sporocidal agent like Microban. After treatment dry the fuck out of it. Then encapsulate the surface with something like Fiberlock."

GetMotivated,feetazt,t1_feeedp9,1579040753.0,Okay am gonna be honest this dude sounds totally normal? He doesn't really have that much of an accent. Am I crazy?
funny,feer9l7,t1_feea05w,1579039514.0,"Actually dude the ""itch"" you're feeling is your nerves being fucked up. When you're numb usually that means your nerve either got severed or injured. It takes about 2 weeks for an injured nerve to heal and several months to never for a cut nerve. The ""itching"" is your never trying to fix itself. 

I speak from experience I had a nerve severed in my face and I had an itch on and off for 3 months. Sometimes it was so bad I had to take a Benadryl to fall asleep."

AskReddit,fe3xnbq,t1_fe38ppk,1578853812.0,I wonder how much of that has to do with the scenarios where you are seeing dead bodies. I've never smelled road kill that was bad but all the dead animals I've had the pleasure to indoors have been HORRIBLE. Maybe there is a connection with human bodies decaying slowly instead of being eaten which causes the odor?
AskReddit,fe377wf,t1_fe11ett,1578846602.0,I've never smelled a decaying human buy I presume is the same as any decaying animal. I found the most disgusting electrocuted corpse of a cat in a job site once. The client had called us in because the ENTIRE first floor of their office stank terribly and they couldn't figure out why. About an hour of running I round we find a cat had crawled into a mechanical space and gotten electrocuted. Eyeballs popped right out too of his head fried and his brain all mushy. I could smell the odor on myself for like two days. ü§¢
aww,fdyutox,t1_fdxx65z,1578783826.0,"My brother was in prison for 3 years. I would visit and talk on the phone and even as someone who went through it ""with him by proxy"". I still have no clue what he really went through. It really fucking changed him. He is paranoid as fuck now. Doesn't trust people easily and has some unusual eating and sleeping habits. üòê"
videos,fdn13f5,t1_fdly88w,1578574031.0,"How I see it is that he really seems like a ""average Joe"" who is now a super celebrity. He is average looking, is pretty quirky/goofy just like a normal person. It really makes him seem very approachable."
