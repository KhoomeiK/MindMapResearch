NativeAmerican,ffapeqt,t1_ffaojtp,1579741385.0,Yeah same people different cultures and beliefs. Similar ways of life though.
NativeAmerican,ffao669,t1_ffajb5a,1579740551.0,Pretty sure they mean as a whole.
beer,ff7rvem,t1_ff6sgt4,1579656850.0,Wow that's wild. I still can't wrap my mind around the fact that monks made beer that is their own style. Always was taught that drinking alcohol was against God lol. I'm guessing you're a trappist and abbey ale connoisseur. Chimay looks like it would be something Id like since I'm a fan of Leffe brune. I love that beer.
beer,ff69ogd,t1_ff5ukck,1579622389.0,Interesting. So Leffe brown ales are not made by the monks but Leffe brune uses similar recipes and style to trappist beers made by monks? I was doing more research into different borwn ales from around the world and Belgium style brown ales are more malty and sweet than compared to American brown ales that are more bitter. I used to think all brown ales were equal lol. Isn't an abbey ale supposed to be a trappist style beer minus made by monk and instead mass produced?
AskScienceFiction,ff690bv,t1_ff67kh1,1579621960.0,I don't believe so. Once the jedi find a candidate they usually take them away from where ever they are.
BattlefieldV,ff5k6qt,t3_errthk,1579596781.0,Lol wow forgot this map existed. I only play on the bigger map modes.
AskScienceFiction,ff5k4dg,t3_errumz,1579596685.0,"No. They just want power. The same thing the jedi do. They just want to obtain it through more ruthless means. Jedis aren't perfect though. Some would even argue they are just as ruthelsss for stealing potential jedis from their families at early age. Robbing them from a fulfilling childhood. Come to think of it, jedi apprentices are more like indentured servants lol"
introvert,ff5jzkw,t3_erruwj,1579596493.0,If that's the case than they weren't ever truly your friends lol. But yeah I've had that in my past. Ended up not talking to some people that I thought were my true friends for years. Yet don't feel regret since most of them did me dirty. So it's normal
beer,ff5jppe,t1_fcj81fs,1579596103.0,So it's a Belgium brown ale dubbel trappist style beer than??
weed,ff5hdpd,t1_fewbdtv,1579592949.0,That's the mistake a lot of rookies make lol. They want to smoke big joints when starting out when all they need is a few hits out of a bowl
weed,ff5hb0z,t3_erreey,1579592854.0,It can be a retrospective. Especially if you smoke when you're feeling down. That's why I only try to Blaze up when I'm in a good mood.
vegetarian,ff5h7b1,t3_erresr,1579592721.0,Haha yeah they can get addicting especially with the right seasoning.
Dreams,ff5gxjo,t3_erqq7n,1579592377.0,Lol you will aways dream as long as you're alive. But is it possible to not  remember dreams after having them. That's why a lot of people think they sometimes don't dream. It's simply that they don't have recollection of them.
Dreams,ff4quq3,t1_ff4esjn,1579570249.0,"It's as if my dreams literally knows ""the girls of my dreams"". Everyone has different tastes sure, so I'm certain each person experiences the ideal girl in said dreams. Mine is a brunette so everytime I'm so in love in the dream that when I eventually wake up I'm like ""no!!!!!! I want to go back!"" lol"

ufc,fewq6z7,t3_eqskfy,1579417841.0,Haha funny seeing zuffa zombies pretend that dives have never existed in major sports
weed,fewa8jw,t3_eqrcvt,1579407459.0,"Yep that's kind of what I felt the first time I was blazed/smacked/high etc. I was sitting in the back of my brothers car 20 minutes after smoking. Felt like my voice sounded different and felt like I was bound to float away if I didn't grab onto something. I held onto  dear life to the car sit in front of me lol. Haven't felt that terrified ever. Felt fear the entire day. You feel fear because it's the unknown so your brain is unsure how exactly to react. Everything you feel and perceive is from a perspective/pov you are not familiar with. So you panic and breath faster than you're used to. Just remember to breath. Breath as calmly and smoothly as you can to counteract the stress your mind and body are trying to combat. Basically it's a bad trip. A lot of people have it the first time they smoke. Go with the flow. Think of it as a roller coaster. It feels like slow motion because it changes your time space continuum that youre used to. Once you learn how to go with the flow you'll learn how to react to it hence, it won't feel like slow MO. Remember weed doesn't necessarily make you calm and relaxed, it just makes your feelings you have more vivid but from another perspective. My guess is that the strain you tried, was a creeper type that catched your mind and body off guard. Hence why you had a bad trip. You know the saying ""be water""? When you smoke that's what you gotta be. Go with the flow and let go. Perceiving time in slo MO is someone a lot of us feel on weed. My guess is that God put weed on earth for us to try. There's even quotes of it in the Bible. Just remember you aren't alone. A lot of us have been in your shoes lol"

cats,feoxg5f,t1_fensnc7,1579307492.0,Thank you. I detest when people get pets only for a while than want to give them up. Worst thing you could ever do to a pet.
socialanxiety,felv4eb,t1_feltx6d,1579231695.0,I deleted the app and deleted the account. Just felt like a waste of time after that. I had other chances but messed those up as well. One girl just blew me off for moving to fast. Told her that I wanted to bang. That was intentional though. Took that risk lol so wasn't let down.

socialanxiety,fej088k,t3_epcm8h,1579152309.0,"I used to go to a church when I was a lot younger(about 8) that had a presentation type class for children that played out different stories from the bible. My mother put me in it with my brother. I didn't want to do it but I didn't have a choice. Let me tell you, it's some of the scariest moments I've had in my life. Every time I got on that stage in front of over 100 people I felt terrified and anxiety. Nonetheless I managed to get through my lines with some stuttering and pauses. Maybe my mom thought that it would help me break free from my shyness. Well it did and it didn't. I'm still really introverted and quiet but still not afraid to defend myself verbally or physically if I have to. I guess what I'm trying to say is go with the flow. Yours not alone when with the fear of speaking in front of many people."
socialanxiety,feizibo,t3_epe021,1579151664.0,Yeah I get that too. I'm usually reserved and introverted but sometimes whenevee I try to start a conversion I'm usually ignored. Gets me kind of down sometimes

NativeAmericans,fefweoc,t1_fefwb0r,1579067393.0,True but still native. Regardless of tribe. Native ancestry transcends colonial borders. But that's good that you did research.
NativeAmericans,fefw32z,t1_fdt8wko,1579067090.0,Your husband is Salvadoran? Well he likely has native ancestry as well lol. I wonder if either of yall even realize and recognize this.
NativeAmericans,fefw0ec,t1_fdsj0tb,1579067019.0,Lol Hispanic can be native though. That is a term the Europeans used to label natives mixed with Europeans. Like mestizo. I just kind it funny how native Americans from northern America like the US and Canada feel offended when someone calls them Latino or Hispanic. They can be just as native as any northern North American
destiny2,fefvlu6,t1_fefvgpk,1579066635.0,"What's the ""charged with light"" buff?? Sorry still kind of new to destiny 2. Is it worth having the mod in place if I'm mostly playing in crucible?"
