Alternative tube types often exist, or may be preferred by other labs, for example green top (lithium heparin) tubes.

Basically, so long as there is enough serum/plasma for both tests, it's usual to just collect one tube for both tests.

Your Note 2 mentions crafting cheap items to donate. I personally think it'd be more effective to craft gear that is relative to your point in the game, and that of the person you're attempting to connect with. My reasoning is that in early game, you never see donated rocket launchers, right? You only see donated rocket launchers once you yourself unlock them. So, if you and your pal are both post-game, the late game items may be more likely to appear in your pool of donated items.
