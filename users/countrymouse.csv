I’ve been relatively stable for a while now and kind feel like I’m gaslighting myself. 

My SO gets frustrated with me bc on the outside I seem ok (read; not a volatile crazy person) but I am still having trouble with ‘normal’ adult stuff (memory, chores, etc). So I must be selfish and lazy. 

I already feel horrible for letting him down, and his anger and frustration multiply the feelings. And then I start questioning... am I actually even sick, or just a awful lazy human who just needs to get it together?"

socialjustice101,ff18jcc,t3_eqz4uf,1579476305.0,"So here’s the thing. For hundreds, if not thousands, of years, white men have killed, tortured, and persecuted untold thousands of people all over the world for their own personal gain—often in the name of religion. 

White supremacy means that whiteness is the default/standard and everything and everyone else is wrong. The white men (who owned other humans) who created the structures and systems that make modern society run — education, banking, housing, healthcare, jobs, and more— did so SPECIFICALLY so that white men (and eventually, women) would have the easiest time getting ahead in life. 

‘Discrimination’ of white people is not possible in America because it suggests that whites and white culture is in the minority, and it’s certainly not. 

If the worst thing that happens to you is that someone yells at you, calls you a bad name, doesn’t like you, or (GOD FORBID) gives or grants something to someone else and not you... you are pretty fucking lucky. 

We have to get a much thicker skin if we are going to be able to do the work of dismantling these oppressive systems. It sucks and is uncomfortable to reflect back, not just on our history as a people and the unspeakable violence inflicted on others, but our own internal, unconscious racist acts and thoughts we encounter daily. 

But we have to do it. Highly suggest ‘White Fragility: why white people have a hard time talking about racism’, especially if my comment made you angry or uncomfortable. Godspeed."

* is there a coworker you trust who can (kindly) give you any inside info you might not be aware of? I am sometimes not in tune with others perception of me/my performance. If there’s something else at play that affected the raise, this person may know. 

* write out everything you’re feeling and want to say. 2 hours later, go back to it and take out any opinions, emotions, hyperbole, or defensive/accusatory language. 

* practice the convo out loud, and realistically review and prepare for the different possible reactions that might come from your supervisor. 

The goal (at least for me) is to get as much information as possible, process privately, and prepare/gird myself to be calm and remove emotions. 

My therapist has had me practice doing deep breaths, leaning into any anxiety/pain/emotion I might have in a conversation, and breathing through it in order to keep speaking/not break down.

socialjustice101,fc9u32n,t3_egq0cb,1577558235.0,"Hi! Thanks for being brave and asking questions—and thanks to the community for being patient and kind. 

This is a ramble wall of text, but hopefully it will flow together to answer your questions. 

I grew up in a tiny Midwest cow town where there was one Black family, one Mormon family, one Jewish family, and a smattering of refugees. I attended college in Cincinnati, and got exposed to a lot of new ideas and got politically invested. 

However, it wasn’t until I moved to Baltimore and started working at a nonprofit that my eyes started to open and see the many, many injustices and inequalities inflicted on minorities in this country. 

Baltimore makes it easy because the segregation and institutional racism is embedded in every part of the city. The only way to ignore it is to isolate yourself completely in the smattering of affluent (predominately white/“safe”) enclaves of the city. 

I started reading, started talking and truly becoming friends with Black people, poor people, brown people. The very hard and uncomfortable truth is that EVERY institutional system that makes the country run favors and is rigged for cis rich abled educated white men to succeed more easily than everyone else. Full stop. 

The more characteristics one has in common (being cis or white or a man or affluent, etc), the easier it is to have a quality education. To grow up in a safe neighborhood. To have enough healthy food, clean water, attention paid as a child. To be able to get a loan to buy a house. To get a job. To apply to college. To bank. It’s who we see on tv, read about in history books. And on, and on, and on. 

Sure, things have gotten better in some ways, but because so many people who only have whiteness in common with the ruling class, they hold on to racism as a way to be ‘superior’ than someone else. 

Slavery—owning other people and violently extracting maximum profit—is only three or four generations removed from today. 400 years of trauma and violence and yet it’s only been in the last 50 that the powers that be started truly recognizing people of color as slightly equal to white people. 

There’s so much very violent history that’s been intentionally smoothed over and removed from our educations that makes it easy for white children to grow up unaware of the way racism and white supremacy (that is, prioritizing whiteness over everything else) affect every part of our lives. It’s the water we swim in. 

It has been an embarrassing, shame-filled, eye opening journey for me to acknowledge this reality and start taking steps to reprogram my thoughts and behavior. Most white people do not want to do this because it’s hard and gross. But until we do, and start developing better systems that protect and serve all people, it’s not going to get better. 

When you think about people being beaten, lynched, maimed and tortured, separated from their families and homes, raped, and more... speaking up, even speaking harshly, is not remotely close to the “extreme” methods white men used for hundreds of years to ensure they stayed in charge. We gotta toughen up. 

I believe that people are mostly the same—we want what’s best for ourselves first, and each other second. Money—the pursuit and spending—has warped our perceptions of what is good, who is right and wrong. The fear of not having a good life for ourselves— that Someone Else will take or get more than what we have—is a primary driver of the hate and indifference we see today. 

Our capitalistic system has worked exactly as it is supposed to—a few have the most at the expense of everyone else. The government contributes to it. The private sector contributes. Pop culture contributes. 

When America was most prosperous (for white people), right after World War 2, everyone had enough for their families to have a good life. There was more civic engagement, and as we headed into the 70’s it looked, for a moment, like we were on our way to a cleaner, safer, more prosperous life for everyone. 

The “Republican” ideals of country, family, and hard work have been claimed by one side, but they are not partisan. Look at Congress now—the true patriots do not have R next to their name. The most family oriented and hard working folks I know are minorities. Full stop. 

I have two visions, some form of one which will likely happen to the country in the next decade:


A) we elect a government that can remove and reverse the destructive policies—dark money, segregation, voting barriers, defense budget, business/corporate tax rate and regulations, environmental policies... and build stronger/new systems to start building the positive life for everyone we’ve claimed to have. 

Or we don’t. And war, recession, and climate change will decimate life as we know it. 

I have learned a lot from the Throughline and codeswitch podcasts. Good luck!"
