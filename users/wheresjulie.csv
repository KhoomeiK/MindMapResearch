Unfortunately, I can’t stay at by friends or boyfriend because they’re either in different city or country because of university:( but I’m trying to spend a lot of time outside or at my favorite coffee places. Feeling guilty most of the time tho. Yes, I do really worry about my brother and I know I should be taking care of myself too but sometimes I really feel like I’m not important and I just don’t want them to hurt him. And no, there’s no one else. My grandparents died long time ago and my mom doesn’t let me talk to her sister because she’s “bad and selfish”, my dad’s sister is more nice tho, but she lives on another part of a country. I have a sister who’s 18, but she went to college and I told her it’s better if she stays at that city most of the time, for her own mental health. 


And thanks for your wishes, it means very much"

Try to think why it’s making you feel anxious? Realize that the other person probably will feel a little bit nervous too. Are you afraid to disappoint them? Do you worry if they might not like you?


I can recommend you to listen to some music on your way, something that will cheer you up, make you feel better. Try not to overthink everything!! No matter how it goes, you’ll have some sort of experience:)

Today I asked my boyfriend how is he feeling and he said “like it’s a new day” and when he was saying this before, it meant tht everything is fine but today?? I’m not sure how to explain, I’m still feeling distant and I realized that I can’t make him change his opinion about me and I can’t make decisions instead of him so I’m just peacefully waiting. I cried so much during last month that I know no matter what, I promised to be always there for him and support him. Soo I’m a little nervous. Couple hours ago he said he loves me but it doesn’t feel the same. And usually I’d feel really guilty, idk why, lately that’s how I’ve been feeling. Like I disappoint him. And relationships are about two people soo I can’t handle that all by myself. Still waiting tho. But prepared for the worst. 



We also talked about a break and that knowing him, he would never called me or texted me back and I wouldn’t do the same thing because I don’t want to pressure him. And both of us are 20 so I guess it’s still a good experience?
