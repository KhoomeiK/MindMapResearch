It seems like they're a mix of Collies and other herding breeds.  I believe they're similar to English shepherds, which you might have any easier time finding a breeder for"

I'm enjoying the foundations part, don't get me wrong! I can totally see how necessary it all is... just hard not to get ahead of myself with wanting to move forward. Learning foundations *and* patience haha"

We start nosework tomorrow, and I want to get to compete (trial? Not sure of the lingo) in that, if he likes it"

I work for my state, and it's fairly boring, but you get 20 days off/year to start and it goes up from there (not including paid sick days).

Yes, it's recommended that you follow ""the two week shutdown"". If you Google it you can find a ton of good resources!"
dogs,fcx560i,t1_fcx3vql,1578051671.0,"The rescue I work with recommends to all fosters/new adopters that you leash the dog to you. It's supposed to help them realize that you're in charge (don't 100% agree with this) and limits the amount of trouble they can get into, since you can see what they're doing at all times"
dogs,fcv2uv4,t3_ej2auq,1577993501.0,"My dog gets the zoomies after walks, too. We usually finish around dinner time, so to help him calm down I give him a stuffed Kong (either his kibble soaked, stuffed, and frozen, or filled with wet food and frozen). It calms him down and also keeps him out of my way while I make and eat dinner."

dogs,fchvn8w,t3_ehbo1q,1577654677.0,"I work with an Aussie rescue, and I think a good way of getting to know the breed is to foster! Not possible for all life styles, but it's taught me a lot about the different levels of drive/Velcro/etc, and what I would like. 

I thought I wanted a high Velcro dog, then fostered an Aussie who would shove his face into my neck anytime I sat down and was constantly underfoot. So...medium Velcro for me haha. Same with drive and energy levels.


Plenty of Aussies live in homes with kids or cats, but they do tend to have a higher prey drive and you can run into issues with them wanting to herd small kids who run around a lot. 

They're typically eager to please (but sometimes they think they're right and will decide what you're saying doesn't make sense and ignore you), and very smart."
dogs,fc5rdw5,t1_fc5oi6u,1577464244.0,Thank you! I will give those a try
dogs,fc5mwg9,t1_fc5mhjb,1577461771.0,"Yeah I wish there was a way to use daycare but have him seperate from the other dogs. I've been trying to find a private daycare where he can just go hang out in someone's home during the day, but I'm paranoid about leaving him with strangers. 

I feel very bad, because it's not his fault that he's following what he was bred to do. It's my fault for adopting a dog without being sure that my lifestyle would be a good fit for him. I will read both of those books and websites you suggested, thank you!"

dogs,fc5m1vv,t1_fc5liry,1577461173.0,"I used to send him, but the staff said he anxiously paced the whole day. He didn't play once in the 5 or 6 times he was sent, got humped a lot, and seemed super unhappy in the cameras. The daycares near me aren't great, it's about 40 dogs in one room with only 2 staff members. I do have a dog walker come 3 days a week"
