DNA. plus hard worn habits i dont want to break. i don't think i'm less than other people. there's a lot of fucking stupid people out there with no regard for others... just not seeing the life i thought id have, to what's unfolding now. i dont want what other people want. or i dont follow all the rules it takes to be in whatever agency is expecting my absolute and earnest following, always some category i somehow don't fit, some rule i inevitably break and i'm cast away. soooo many responsibilities, sooooo many complex things to accomplish in the ""real world."" i subscribe to some idea which removes me from the equation. or maybe they can't exacttly place what's ""different' about me but it totally prevents me from success in relationships. and i eventually reduced my efforts in expeecting anything at all postive in my life. family life is completely dysfunctional, stressful on a daily basis. i'm just not accepting what i am and what is the world. i am not meant for the life i thought i was meant for. what i am meant for is a lot more pain. i know this as death and toxicity continues to surround me. i am perpetually ""too sensitive"" and increasingly dejected. will i be able to cope with it all for a lifetime of a 9 to 5? constant effort toward an alternative lifestyle with further pain and rejection and demand? or have the years of disillusionment completely worn away my will so that i cannot bear to put my head down andd try, begin a new phase in any direction??? i have worn mazes in my head in my isolation. musst i completely run away from this life?? i know deep down i will never escape myself. so what is. the.fucking.point. if i can just manage to make some art before i die. that's acceptable. thanks for reading if you did."

Protect yourself the best you can, especially when going from car to apartment, if you happen to park in a lot in your complex that's pretty much the riskiest place at night, so be aware--other commenters had good suggestions about being on your phone during your walkup.

And anyone who sees the photo & comment is made aware of your wife's identity.  That could be dangerous. Here is a link to Yelp's content guidelines:  [https://www.yelp.com/guidelines](https://www.yelp.com/guidelines)

So the answer is simple: The photo violate's your wife's privacy and must be removed. Contact Yelp admin."

Advice,feftzgs,t3_eoxoqv,1579065140.0," It's good you're an honest friend. Your opinion is that she isn't any good. And if you tell her that... That might be all she wants to hear. but help your friend learn for herself. Tell her to do an open mic or post something on youtube, where no one knows her. Honestly if she's conventionally attractive it doesn't matter whether or not she actually has talent, if theater and acting are her interests she can go a long way on appearance. and that's not my moral standing, but it's the unfortunate truth of Hollywood. anyway do you really think you'd be doing her a favor? are you dealing with some jealousy? .... something to consider, sometimes advice is best left unsaid......."

\- leave at least 4 hours before you need to be at the show

\- drive super slowly, with chains or studded tires 

and you should be fine, right? :) YOLO"

Advice,fefsqor,t3_eoxcfr,1579064073.0,"When you're meeting girls it's not all about you. It's about them. Get to know them, ask questions, flirt, and try to have fun. Lots of girls want a guy that will make them laugh so get to know the girl. And the more you learn about them the more you can show them about you. And things should happen naturally from there. It's not really like a game to be won, and doesn't happen instantly. It's more just getting to know other people. Practice helps. Fake confidence helps, when you are nervous. Just keep reaching out. The only way you can really fail is if you shut down and stop trying to meet people."
Advice,fefs2ip,t3_eox0ha,1579063524.0,"Accept that no matter how much of your lives are tied into one another, there is no changing another person. Accept him as he is. Accept the good you have together. Or accept you made a mistake... Do you want to be ""the expectant wife""? The suspicious partner? Do you want to spend your time worrying about whether your not you can trust this person? Does he show up where it matters? That's what matters most. You may be personally hurt... But did you also hurt him by accosting him?? What can you do to secure your own wellbeing outside of your husband and his interests? Take a deep look... Are you bothering him about his bad habits because you actually feel insecure about yourself? ANyway I'm not trying to shame you at all, I hope this helps to at least step outside of your perspective a bit and consider the situation as a whole. It's difficult to have expectations of people and they make promises and don't come through. but no one's perfect... we place too much weight on people's shoulders sometimes, too much importance on our close ones to fill every need and demand. Consider compulsive lying as a pattern of behavior vs. lying about this one habit, is it more of one or the other? Is this the only issue or is there something deeper to consider? ..... Wish you luck."
