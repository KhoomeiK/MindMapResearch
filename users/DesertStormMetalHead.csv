oklahoma,ff5dsr0,t3_ermagk,1579588661.0,"First, wow! Iam so sorry to hear this is going on. I hope you find swift resolution. 

I was the general manager of a fast casual restaurant in OKC. The chain was from out of state, and is no longer in Oklahoma. 

I had to attend regular management meetings, twice a year the corporate attorneys would come to town for the sole purpose of sexual harassment training. 

The last hour if the training was the counselors explaining that any sexual harassment complaint made againt a GM, or AGM would result in immediate termination, no question asked.

Why?

Because, as they explained in detail, ""Your wrongful termination lawsuit will only cost the company 30 or 40k at best, assuming you could afford representation to fight us"". They would further explain that a sexual harassment lawsuit would go upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars to the plaintiff, not to mention costly negative press.

The policy was very clear. You know the difference between right and wrong. A complaint of inappropriate behavior will cost you your job.

Due process you say? The response to that was always "" Its my job to protect the company. Its cheaper this way. Fight us and you will lose""

Although somewhat misguided, at least harrassment was taken seriously by this company.

I tried Blue Dream first when I got my mmj card and got high AF off one hit. I down shifted to Cannatonic and then Harlequin, which helped me learn how THC and sativas affect me. I built a tolerance to both pretty quick, then moved to Pineapple Express. Frickin love Pineapple Express, except my wife gets irritated that I wont stop talking, but it's a fun mental/ head high.

This will be the second attempt with recreational since we passed medical. We somehow managed to create the best and probably most successful medical program to date in the country. Every attempt by someone to restrict or restrain the rights of a card holder and been killed by the state courts. And tax dollars are rolling in! OKC alone brought in $19 million on sales tax alone during 2019.

There is, and will continue to be serious opposition to this bill. Like the previous one, the language could lead to changing our medical program. Which the majority doesn't want or need. Again, the most successful to date.

This bill leads to a corporate participation we do not need or want. The main out of state activist /sponsor of the bill is well know to the marijuana friendly lawyers of our state, and they urge we dismiss him. He is a corporate puppet. We have enough corporate corruption here, we do not need more.

Our medical program is hugely successful from the hard work and entrepreneurial spirit of the mom and pop stores and growing operators. The ""chain"" dispensaries are terrible and I avoid them in favor of the mom and pop outfits.

Also, I believe this bill, like the first one, contains a provision to decriminalize also, leading to more legal pardons, which the massive private prison industry here will fight tooth and nail.

Its been my experience so far that anyone who meets the age and residency requirements can obtain the medicine card without any resistance. The $100 fee is even knocked down to $20 for those on state assistance, Medicaid/Medicare, and 100% disabled Veterans. 

We don't need this, we are of the mindset to ride it out until total federal decriminalization. We have the best medical program ever to hold us over until then 😁

I staring going on my own from there. I even use vacation days to volunteer. When I have a Dr or dentist appt, I will often go ahead and take the entire day off so I can get a half day in at the food bank before or after the appointment. 

I catch alot crap from my uber right wing MAGA family, but ""F"" them. Comments to the effect of trying to feed lazy people who won't work. Its toned down once I simply ignored or stopped acknowledging the comments and that overall attitude. 

What I have learned about myself is that I like being part of the solution, not part of the problem. I found that I do not care how you got hungry or why you are hungry...... I just care that you are hungry.

I changed my entire mindset once I realized this. I now approach all endeavors and relationships with a ""part of the solution "" attitude. From there everything began to improve. I stopped sweating the small shit in life.

And..... I finally started really dealing with my PTSD and anxiety, partnering with my Dr's and head shrinks at the VA. I didn't like my original mental health person, so I went to the patient advocate and switched twice, until I found the one psychiatrist I could ""gel""

Veterans,fclolnh,t1_fckmsnc,1577752700.0,My experience has been almost exactly the same. I forgot to mention in my reply to the poster that my primary feels it will be decriminalized at the federal level in the near future as well.

Veterans,fclo8mn,t1_fcllfuq,1577752454.0,"It will not affect you disability pay, and they cannot deny you benefits over cannabis use"
Veterans,fclo5kk,t3_eho906,1577752397.0,"First, and this is clearly stated on the VA website, they cannot refuse to treat you over marijuana use. As a federal institution, they cannot prescribe it, cannot dispense it to you, nor can they be a approval authority to obtain legal medical marijuana. Again, they cannot refuse your treatment or deny you benefits. If any of you are getting a hard time, I would immediately contact your local patient advocate office!

Iam 60 % service connected and I shared with my primary. We are in a legal medical marijuana state and I have a card. He has been very supportive, and surprised me with his knowledge on how cannabis can help me. Now, he also informed me that they would no longer be able to prescribe me opioids, as that would be illegal now that he has this knowledge. He further explained that if bloodwork from a specialist showed marijuana use, they are not allowed to act on that. They can only inform him, my primary doc, and then it was up to him to act on the info, or not. He also mentioned that most specialists are not looking for that so he rarely hears anything.

I do not miss, nor no longer need opiates or painkillers. Ive been able to drop multiple prescriptions, and next Iam experimenting with indicas to help insomnia."
OKmarijuana,fcllazy,t3_ehrfye,1577750449.0,"If you've been here for 3 years, then you most likely have a rental/lease history, as well as utility bills that can prove residency. From there Iam 99% sure you can use a US Passport to satisfy the government issued ID part. I would call one of the many Dr offices where you can get the mmj recommendation. Better yet, call the new OMMA call center!

EDIT: for more info after reviewing thread

I used Drs of Cannabis in OKC, they also have an office in Stillwater. They were more expensive, but it was a one stop deal. I was there just under an hour and I walked out just waiting on my card. My appointment and application submitted was Fri 8/30, approval email Tues 9/10, card in the mail Thurs 9/13. Just under two calendar weeks that included a 3 day holiday weekend. 

Drs of Cannabis are legit, I was pleasantly surprised at the Dr's knowledge of cannabis and how it could help my issues. Again, they are more expensive, but you get what you pay for. This is a legitimate Doctor and it was a legitimate medical consultation. Look for them on Leafly or WM and look for my review, it oulined my visit in more detail. Username is the same."

I continue to research and compare what I learn with employees at dispensaries. I suffer from chronic migraines, arthritis, and other related issues from chemical exposure common to my username. 

Ive found many Veterans among those who work in the industry, which is awesome as Iam sure Iam not the only who struggles with opening up to someone who isnt.

Ive found different strains for specific purposes, and my quality of life has improved dramatically. And I do not walk around stoned or whacked out all the time. I was a monster when I used alcohol to cope, but that monster is gone now that I have mmj to keep me level. 

PM me and Iam happy to elaborate further. 

Good luck and god speed my brother! \m/"

I have over 100 hours in and I haven't completed the main story yet. Why? Cause as soon as you get hyperdrive the open world is so massive, I keep exploring planets, building bases. Oh, and ships! I have 5 plus a freighter. 

Keep playing, its gonna get awesome!

EDIT: A previous poster mentioned getting sidetracked and that 100% true with the open world. The true beauty of the game is you can go either way, finish the story (campaign for you COD fans) or not. Its totally up to you on how you wish to proceed after you get hyperdrive."
