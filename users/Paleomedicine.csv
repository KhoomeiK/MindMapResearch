medicalschool,ff0xind,t3_er2h18,1579473279.0,Wow can I relate to this. There are times where I’m literally not doing anything and the attending is just on their phone and everything is done and in the back of my mind on repeat is “please send me home.”

medicalschool,few5ihk,t1_fevh5io,1579405703.0,"A-fucking-men. Quite frankly, it’s insulting having people who’ve never been a doctor or have gone through med school trying to dictate what they think students should learn."
medicalschool,few5a9g,t1_few29al,1579405609.0,"Hey if they learn that way, then that’s wonderful. More power to them. But they should not be putting down those who study/ learn differently. Hell, having empathy for others is part of what being a doctor is about so they really should have a better perspective for their fellow classmates. Honestly, every med school has “those” students, the gunners who will suck the school’s dick even if they’re being force fed shit."
medicalschool,few1n1c,t1_feuc1qd,1579404203.0,"I fucking HATE team based learning. I can do well on my own studying material from lectures. Sure, I can contribute to a team but only if I understand the knowledge first. That I have to do ON MY OWN. Group study sessions do nothing for me until I’m ready.

Also, as another commenter mentioned, I despise that medical schools are moving to this team based bullshit. The whole point of years 1 & 2 are to learn the basic sciences to explain the pathophys or biochem of disease, what should be normal, and how things can go wrong when they aren’t. Sure, sprinkle in some case based group learning here and there but don’t make it the learning process for everyone. 

That also brings into question what the actual fuck are we paying medical school staff for??? If we’re paying to teach ourselves, you could get the same knowledge from sketchy, pathoma, first aid, boards and beyond, literally so many other resources. Lectures can be used in tandem with this material but if all you’re doing is team based, group bullshit, then what’s the point of even paying people to “lecture you” if all they’re doing is facilitating group work. Quite frankly it’s utter bullshit and just shows how bloated medical school administration has become and how so many of them, most of whom who’ve never been a physician or gone through medical school, are just in it for that sweet sweet loan money."

One of the worst things about diabetes is the fact that it can destroy your quality of life significantly if you don’t control it."

saltierthancrait,fdxi8ef,t1_fdxck6p,1578768931.0,"I can give you an example as someone who grew up with the prequels and didn’t see the OT until after Revenge of the Sith.

I loved the prequels because as a kid because I felt like I was being immersed into a completely different world/ galaxy. It was amazing to see all these cool creatures and worlds and learn about some of the lore of Star Wars. Sure, the political talk was heavy and a lot of it went over my head, but once you really think about what he is talking about, it’s pretty in depth. There are corrupt politicians trying to use the system to maximize their profits by instigating a war essentially. Then you have the master puppeteer of Palpatine pretty much orchestrating this stuff in order to gain more power. That was always such an interesting g concept because it was similar to the political climate of the real world. And in between you had Jedi using the force to augment their own abilities. And of course the lightsaber duels and the music. 

So that’s just the first movie. Yeah, it was long, yeah the dialogue was clunky, and yeah, it relied a lot on CGI. But as a kid I felt like I had entered the Star Wars galaxy and got into the story.

The second and third movies expanded upon these and followed the young Anakin Skywalker becoming a Jedi. Again, yeah they’re too long, yeah they’re clunky, and yeah there’s a lot of CGI. But again a lot of the same elements of TPM come into play and as a kid, you really got to see the size and scale of the war being fought across multiple galaxies and you got to see the Jedi in their prime. The amount of Jedi and their abilities were incredible to watch as a kid and they made you want to be one. But then you look at the hidden layers and realize that the Jedi of that time were hypocrites and had become cogs in a corrupted republic. 

So yeah, objectively, the prequels aren’t good movies. But as a story that follows a narrative and stays within the rules set by the previous trilogy, it’s really incredible to see the full imagination of Lucas. He had a story to tell and through the prequels, he told it how he imagined it."
saltierthancrait,fdxayfm,t3_en808t,1578767014.0,"I think it’s a good metaphor for this new franchise as a hole.

I agree, Finn had the hero’s journey on course for TFA but as the movies went on they sidelined him in order to make those big Chinese bucks. Finn could have had PTSD, learned to trust people, and contemplate his actions about killing stormtroopers he might have known. 

But fuck it, he’s the comic relief."

fatlogic,fd33orz,t1_fd2fhe7,1578154426.0,"You’ve explained it pretty well. I just wanted to add on to the “overtaking other organs” part. So as the fat builds up around the heart and other muscles, it smothers the insulin receptors. Thus the pancreas has to secrete more and more insulin to activate these receptors. That’s what “insulin resistance” means. If this process isn’t corrected (I.e. losing weight) then the pancreas continues to secrete more and more insulin until it “burns out” and no longer produces insulin. Essentially at that point, you’re a type 1 diabetic because your pancreas no longer works.

Insulin helps to bring in the sugar from your blood. If the sugar remains in the blood at high levels, it attaches to the vessel walls, which can lead to clotting. This is why the eyes, nerves, and kidneys are affected because these clots affect the smallest vessels first."

Some people are born more talented than others. That doesn’t mean no one else can develop the talent but for others it just takes more practice. Shaak Ti was a perfect example of this. 

To me, if anyone could use the force, why didn’t they? That would be such a useful skill and would seem weird if only a select people engaged it even if it was an “ancient religion” according to the OT.
