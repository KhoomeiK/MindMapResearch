If you likes you enough, he will be able to commit - and you deserve nothing less than that :)"

AskReddit,fe7v935,t1_fe7q9x2,1578919554.0,"Ah, I see. Hm... I would not advice them to switch to the artificial meat. I might advise them to try to switch to naturally produced meat with more conceren about the well being of the animals 
If there was meat like that, then the main factor for most people in deciding would probably be price. 
I grew up in a country region of Austria. Meat production can be a very local thing here and I think that is the best way to go for anybody who is not willing to resign from eating meat. 

If there however was artifical meat that is also better for the enviroment (which is more likely, I think - less food and water and transportation cost) I would totally advice for that :)"
AskReddit,fe7p9rb,t3_eo3a31,1578917650.0,I would not - I am already a vegetarian. Why would I switch to artificial meat with worse outcome if I do not need meat at all?

studying,fduxskt,t3_en56q7,1578740711.0,"I am by no way a study expert, but I'd say  


1. Yes 
2. depends on how you view it
3. yes

There have been studies on the time of forgetting. That might be very theroretical. Another thing it might depend on ist how often you use/need them: Of course you won't forget concepts that you use daily - and use basically is revision.   


Maybe if you learn them the first time,  try explaining them to somebody else. That often shows if you have really understood them."

offmychest,fajh4sw,t3_e9kkmc,1576137477.0,"Hey!   
Man, what you write seems unreal.  


I am still quite young so I am probably not in the position to have enough live experience to tell you an amazing story about how everything is gonna turn out fine. But, you will get through it. Tastes dull reading that, right? 

Overall you seem responsible. It is not fair that live goes that way for you. You made some mistakes, yes. Everybody does. 

&#x200B;

Idk how the laws in your country are for working with children. Is there any way that your record will be removed? That you can restore it somehow? What are your plans with the girl you hooked up? Is she alone or with another guy?   


And .... I just hope you can find somebody off your friends or your family to talk to. Maybe there are even some organisations. That's a lot of stuff to organize now and it is gonna be a lot of work. 

The only thing I know from my little tiny bit of experience - You will find a way to a happy life. You defenitly will. Even if it won't be the life you've planned on. Stay strong. New years nearly around. I hope that next year around this time you can post ""How I unfucked my life in a year"". 

I wish I could say some more. This situation is just really hard and I hope I did not offend you or smth. like that. What I write seems generic, but I don't know what else to say and I wanted to say SOMETHING. 

Take care.   
Remember that those that stay strong and are able to deal with difficult sitations often come out to be those to be idols or at leasat some form of ""there's hope, he did it, so I can deal with it too."" There will be a way. It is your turn to be a rolemodel now, I guess.   


You got this."
