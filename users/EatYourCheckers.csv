Group A doesn't do long-term planning like you are suggesting, with some paranoia sprinkled in. Also they probably don't fair well in prison as easily due to being easy-to-manipulate targets. 

Group B don't want to go to jail. They don't know the system for getting drugs there. They have their system on the outside. Also lack the planning and weighing of long-term consequences that your idea requires. 

Group C has enough hurdles to jump over: No permanent address to put on job resumes, no bank account for benefits or paychecks to be deposited to, no consistent place to sleep, get clean, and prepare for work. They don't need a criminal record on top of all of that."

Well, I guess it must've been 1998 because the Moviefone man's voice said enthusiastically but also muffled into the phone: He Got Gaaaame!

Except we called back like 10 times and could never make out what he said. To us, it sounded like ""Peacock Dame!"" So we then spent that afternoon acting out the musical drama that we assumed must be the plot of Peacock Dame: The Movie. My friend had a dance number and everything.

If they want follow up info on how or whatever (honestly, people rarely want follow-up info to the nicety, ""So what do you do?"" then I talk about using different assessments to figure out what they are getting out of the problem behavior and teaching them a better way to get what they need, or figuring out what the best teaching method for this particular person is to learn a new skill.

LifeProTips,fdfd3e7,t3_el1dk1,1578358860.0,"I think the key to an inexpensive and less-stress wedding is to really think about what you want out of it, and focus on that, and let the rest of fall as it may. 

For example, I wanted a pretty dress and nice pictures of us being young to look back on. I got my dress off the rack and altered (still paid more for it than I thought was reasonable, but it was the most expensive item of the wedding); we got a good photographer. Everything else - I let my sister decide ultimately - she likes planning. Small, at the home of one of my mother's friends on a lake (not my first choice but I ultimately didn't care), and no reception, just a nice dinner at a Country Club. Husband got out of dancing in front of people (probably all HE wanted out of the wedding, lol). 

If you want a good party, then throw a good party. But go easy on the cake and wardrobe. 

If you want a beautifully decorated ceremony, go nuts on flowers, but find deals for the rest.

You should have him evaluatied by a BCBA, and they can bill your insurance for skill acquisition (including potty-training). If your BCBA is too cold or methodical without taking his emotional development into account, you find a different BCBA (I am a BCBA and am always saddened that people are turned off to it because of poor practitioners; make sure its a BCBA, some states have no rules about what it takes to call yourself a behaviorist).

(This was back when you could get all the way to the gate without having a ticket). 

I was so young, I had no idea who Groucho was, but I remember liking the silly tradition. But the furry eyebrows and 'stache  bothered me so they peeled mine off for me. So little toddler - elementary school me would just have giant nose glasses."

podcasts,fcvzk9n,t3_eizc1e,1578013696.0,"All are free; some do have additional content for paid subscribers or donors. I drive 3 hours a day, and listen to tons of podcasts - I only support 2 financially due to being a huge fan. 

If you are into the more produced, sleek podcasts (like Wondery), check out Serial or Slow Burn. 

But a huge corner of podcasting is just people talking, or celebrity interviews. For those, its best to just jump in and see if you enjoy the hosts. If you are not sure where to start with a show, and it is a show with guests, pick a guest you like or are familiar with. I think there are 750,000 podcast shows out now? You are bound to findmany you like, but often you have try many before you land on another you enjoy. I always feel like, ""That's it. I have what I like, I'm not going to find anything else I like as much as these."" And then BAM, I hear about something and give it a try, and I am hooked to yet another. 

I am def more of a ""conversational podcast"" fan. My husband prefers newscasts and interviews.

My favorites are Hello Internet, Jordan Jesse Go, My Favorite Murder, And Thats Why We Drink, This Podcast Will Kill You, Good One, Conan O'Brien, A Mediocre Time with Tom and Dan, Podcast: The Ride, My Brother, My Brother, and Me, and Trends Like These, for a shorter/quick listen, Memory Palace is pretty awesome. . 

My husband listens to a lot of NPR broadcasts,Bill Nye, and Startalk."
