Why can't you do something like was done in Fallout NV? Where the super mutants and the Brotherhood were not major players, but they existed and had a small affect in the story and varying areas. I also don't understand why the enclave is a major player but not the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood has all but squashed the enclave in FO3, FO NV, and FO4. I thought the enclave were dead or disbanded."

Rav4,feybqph,t1_fex4jxl,1579443393.0,"These are fair points. I honestly am going to buy what I can get used when I've saved up the cash. My budget is likely to be around $22k. So my options will be limited to medium mileage couple year old models. Which is fine, I'm pretty confident in Toyota's track record for making hybrid vehicles and offroad vehicles. There's no reason not to combine them, Electric motors have very few moving parts you'd think it would be perfect. My main concern is not getting a 2018 or older. I'm honestly not a fan of the look and they made a shit ton of improvements in the 2019 model. I honestly think this was quite an achievement, getting over 200hp in a mid sized SUV and somehow also getting 40+ mpg. This turned into a rant...."

As an enthusiast with a '98 Honda Civic I beg to differ. I don't have enough money for a fast or sporty looking car. I can say that I drive a 5 speed manual though, which in the U.S. not many can claim. I also am able to take care of my own car without being a mechanic. Not to mention my car weighs the same as a Mazda MX-5. I don't have the same power but it still drives like a go-cart."

Your BF might think you guys are not sexually compatible, hence the decrease in visits. I would try masturbating first when he's in the mood and see if that gets you in the mood. There really is no way to force sex drive. This may just be how the relationship ends, slowly fades into nothing from the lack of seeing each other and lack of sex. Honestly, I feel bad for your bf. Having sex once every 3 months with a high sex drive can be pretty agonizing while in a monogamous relationship."

If you aren't part of this group of religious people then you are not compatible. People who are this serious about their religious beliefs tend to be a bit extreme.

Nobody gets 'dirty' that fast. So his problem isn't dirt but your own bodily odors and fluids. IDK, maybe it's just me but I would find it hard being with someone who couldn't take my body odors and such when showering every day."
