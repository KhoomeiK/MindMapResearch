JUSTNOFAMILY,fcauiie,t3_egwf1u,1577576871.0,"I have a cousin who did something similar.  There first Thanksgiving my husband (boyfriend at the time) spent with my family,  my aunt made him pecan pie. She had asked what his favourite Thanksgiving dish was and that's what he had asked for.  

After dinner,  we have pie, we compliment the effort my aunt on the pecan pies she made. As there's still a whole pie and a half left,  my cousin asks if she can take some home.  We assumed she would take a slice or two.

Nope.  She took the whole other uneaten pie for herself and her boyfriend who didn't come to dinner because he hadn't wanted to.  My aunt was pissed."
