Taken from ehealth,  who was in insurance before and after the ACA.

science,fevp3qe,t1_fevo3gn,1579399867.0,"This is just one article, but all you need to go is Google insurance premium costs before and after the ACA.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2017/03/22/yes-it-was-the-affordable-care-act-that-increased-premiums/#19502ecd11d2

Edit Quoting the article 

”Those responses are no longer plausible. It turns out that across the board, for all ages and family sizes, for HMO, PPO, and POS plans, premium increases averaged about 60 percent from 2013, the last year before ACA reforms took effect, to 2017. In same length of time preceding that, all groups experienced premium increases of less than 10 percent, and most age groups actually experienced premium decreases, on average.

These findings come from new data from [eHealth](http://ehealth.com/), which not only sells ACA Marketplace health plans, but sold a wide variety of health plans through its own website for many years before the ACA was passed, as well as both on and off the Exchanges after the ACA took effect. For years starting with 2014, the data include ACA-compliant, non-employer-sponsored plans sold both on and off exchanges. It does not include premium subsidies, which in any case are available only to on-exchange purchasers with qualifying income."""
science,fevnvbj,t3_eqjmaw,1579399513.0,This isn't a surprise to anyone. The ACA never worked and was doomed to fail from the start. Premiums have risen more thanks to Obama then over any other years. Thank you democrats!
