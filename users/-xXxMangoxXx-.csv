nba,ffa3ved,t1_ffa2t9d,1579727361.0,Maybe because men already play big roles and seeing women play big roles shows that theyre just as capable.
summonerswar,ff5jfn6,t1_ff5j5yf,1579595706.0,There were a few posts before showcasing them. Also these are like the super mega whales that people will never face but I just used it as an example of how crazy some peoples runes are
summonerswar,ff5d6zk,t1_ff5afaq,1579588002.0,sunday AD threads get lower traction in general. Also its hard to answer questions when people dont provide box information or the questions arent clear.

nba,ff469oa,t1_ff457rm,1579556464.0,Hes already really good and hes just going to get better. Excited to see him mature.

summonerswar,ff1tm4x,t1_ff1jprv,1579485899.0,Why? Daphnis is really good on a swift dd set.
summonerswar,ff1tiw4,t1_ff0odxv,1579485841.0,"while 300 spd is insane for a dd like daphnis, its not going to outspeed a lot of the turn one mons like swift gany, oke, and stuff like that. There are people that can get 300 spd on a hathor with vio will to give you an idea."

mildlyinfuriating,fecwns6,t1_fec23cx,1578987593.0,im more impressed they all got out so quick. Ive seen people struggle to get out of cars before and they arent even crowded.
manga,fecscir,t1_fecrv3q,1578982759.0,Did you even read the second sentence?? We just get scanlators competing to get the translation out as fast as possible instead of making a good quality scan. An extra day or two for higher quality scans are better than getting two bad translations because two groups are competing for no reason. Its not even about the fucking guy thats getting sniped you just end up with worse quality scans.
manga,fecl0ao,t1_feck27q,1578976504.0,"How is sniping good for the reader? Jaminis rushes translations so only way the original group can compete is if they rush out an even worse product. If a guy has spent 3 fucking years on a project and the translations are good, why doesn't jaminis box go after all the countless manga that have no translations over the one that's already popular?"
manga,fec4rpa,t1_fec1yaj,1578966640.0,Not true. If it becomes a race to release the content as fast as possible then theres a drop in quality. I would rather wait an extra day and get better quality translations.
manga,febsppc,t1_febqk2o,1578962242.0,Either in the small group of scanlators I mentioned or theres a lot of drama no one ever sees.
manga,feaf6y3,t1_fea7juo,1578947913.0,"Ik wuxiaworld sites translators were making a lot of money off patreon and such. I believe the battle through the heavens author was making around 25k a month at its peak. This was before people got the option to hide how much they make though. They have incentives like ""For every extra 50-200 dollars I get this week I translate one extra chapter this week"". These chinese webnovels are insanely long, the shorter ones are 500 chapters and several of the popular ones are in the thousands of chapters."
manga,feaejvz,t1_fe9wse3,1578947722.0,Its mainly just a small group of scanlators that are part of the drama.
manga,feaegkj,t1_fea2f94,1578947676.0,As you can see most people here care. People would rather have scanlations for things that are dropped or never scanlated before over 2 scanlations of the same thing.
manga,feae8ft,t1_fea32w3,1578947553.0,"Its unnecessary. If someone is already doing a good job scanlating, jaminis box is just splitting up the views between the guy that dedicated a shit ton of time and themselves for no reason when they could go for the endless number of manga that need scanlations. Theyre basically thriving off other peoples hard work. Then they bitch and moan about something being unfair."

nba,fe5oibk,t3_enu8c1,1578872195.0,After those missed 3s I got flashbacks of the Miami game.
AnotherEdenGlobal,fe52uu5,t1_fe4xsq2,1578865164.0,This is the luckiest I've ever been in a gacha game. Played a good amount of games and spent quite a bit in others and have never gotten close to this so I've been shaking all day for the past few days.
AnotherEdenGlobal,fe4vljc,t1_fe3ddys,1578863171.0,Yeah it was an honest mistake. I posted late at night and after making my album and link I was looking at some other peoples posts before posting so I accidentally copied their link.
AnotherEdenGlobal,fe4uhsp,t1_fe3cvzb,1578862893.0,Huh? Oh my god I realized what happened. I made my imgur link and looked at your link before posting and accidentally copied your link somehow. Leet me know if it's better now.

summonerswar,fdlve2d,t1_fdlusqu,1578533393.0,I mean sure? Don't see why you need to be mad at a unit after a buff if you havent tested the buff though. I have always been hyper critical of brandia but always hoped com2us would make her viable and this buff adds just enough punch to do so.
summonerswar,fdluopf,t1_fdlui8j,1578532919.0,"Did you try her after the patch, where shes getting buffed so her s3 scales off enemy buffs too? So base 840 percent scaling, another 50 percent because will means they cant sleep, and another 30 percent because will buff."

summonerswar,fd519yb,t1_fd4xr23,1578173213.0,My point is that hathor herself can't be banned while ignoring all the other ld cancers. They did not nerf any of the ld nat 5s this patch so hathor nerf wouldn't do much good unless they try to balance rta around conq/fighter level play where there arent as many ld nat 5s.

That still comes out to about 100 usd and youll get the kit from japan in a week. Shipping doesnt hurt as much in comparison if you buy a few kits at a time.
