nottheonion,ffcpxwz,t3_ess9v8,1579804747.0,"I worked for a bank as a teller. The checks would be suspicious because of the amounts. You can’t call the drawing bank to verify them like the lawyer suggested, because the checks don’t exist yet as far as the issuing bank is concerned. If you write a personal check and give it to someone, your bank has no clue until funds are requested from whatever bank deposits the check. They’d be suspicious regardless of the amount. However, at my bank, we’d get people with settlement checks all the time, so for us it wasn’t unusual and we’d be less concerned.

The bank acted with an absolute lack of tact. They should have been honest and said, “Hey, because the amount of the checks is so unusual, we just have to call Enterprise to verify the checks and then we can deposit them.”

I don’t believe that there was a void watermark, because I worked at Chase and their check scanners would have picked it up clear as day. They have some of the best technology in banking. I’m also surprised the checks were available next day on a new account. It could still give funds for fraudulent checks only to catch it days later when Chase actually tries to collect funds for the checks. A government regulation dictates that banks can’t put excessively long holds on checks, so banks can take that money back up to like a month if the check bounces.

Anyway, I don’t think it’s a case of racial discrimination, but I think the bank handled things poorly. Very poorly. And clearly Chase had no issue with it, so I hope he’ll be satisfied with his new bank."

I knew the writing was on the wall after the first bankruptcy and they did nothing to pivot afterwards. Their video rental business was a mess. The membership program was expensive and convoluted and not easy to explain.

Corporate kept pumping more and more money into the video side while the game store was propping everything up and had better prices and trade-in values than GameStop. And we were treated better than GameStop. I knew the entire company was going to go under because they were refusing to double down on the game store and just compete with Game Stop. Netflix was already gaining steam at that point. They could’ve pivoted into online game rental, too. But they clearly didn’t understand their own market.

I knew I was right when the second bankruptcy happened. It was only a matter of time before they shit down. Of course, now GameStop is in awful shape now, but they did it to themselves. They could still be more successful than they are now had they treated employees and customers better. They turned their company into a used car lot when their clientele is mostly introverts who want to be left alone and moms who don’t want to be pitched to.
