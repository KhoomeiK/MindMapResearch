Parenting,fe3408r,t1_fe339qk,1578845714.0,Maybe a counselor at your school? The best thing you can do for yourself is get yourself out of this situation. I know it‚Äôs scary but you deserve sooo much better. And you‚Äôre parent should not be allowed to do this and never see a consequence. I wish you the best.
depression,fe33qhi,t3_enp1wv,1578845590.0,Agreed. Seeing that really pisses me off.
TrueCrime,fe32bg4,t3_enp2n6,1578845234.0,I have had moments like this. I did yesterday watching don‚Äôt f with cats. Some cases I think just touch a certain nerve inside of you. Usually when I cry it‚Äôs because of something like you mentioned where they interview a family member. My uncle was murdered so I always just thought family testimony was relatable. I think that it just shows you have compassion for people and are very empathetic.
Parenting,fe313c0,t3_enp2zv,1578844890.0,I‚Äôm so so sorry you‚Äôre having to live in that situation. Nobody has the right to put their hands on you. You do not at all deserve any of this. I‚Äôm assuming your a minor? Is there an adult that you trust to talk to about this?
depression,fe2xd3r,t3_enosmg,1578843934.0,Just imagine someone telling you that you shouldn‚Äôt laugh because someone out there has something funnier?? I have always hated it when people say there‚Äôs something worse going on in the world.

Advice,fe2n77d,t1_fe2lobe,1578840828.0,If anyone cheats on their SO it is a concern for you not just their relationship. It shows someone‚Äôs character no matter the situation. I‚Äôm not sure what advice you‚Äôre looking for though? You‚Äôre cousins so the answer in general is no you should not be making out with your cousin. Also babies don‚Äôt come from marriage was my point. Unless you‚Äôre waiting for marriage to have sex.

Advice,fe2jxpt,t3_enntbq,1578839280.0,"Well I‚Äôd first start with the bf thing. She shouldn‚Äôt be cheating on her bf no matter what cheating is not ok. 

In my personal opinion I don‚Äôt agree with being with your cousin in a romantic relationship. But on the same stand point I don‚Äôt think anyone should tell you know as long as there‚Äôs zero possibility of having children together. Your children will more than likely have a list of health problems. I just watched a documentary about this exact situation and the child had to have daily shots/medications to just survive. Like I said I don‚Äôt agree with dating a family member but as long as you‚Äôre not having children and are two consenting adults live your own life I guess."
Advice,fds6a94,t3_emy8w5,1578695314.0,I had similar problems when I was in school. And would let it eat me alive especially in the last couple weeks of whenever the event was. Honestly what helped me the most was thinking back to something that just made me an anxious disaster and think about how the reality was never as awful as the things I would think were going to happen. In my opinion the more panic attacks I have had I think have made me stronger and able to really cope with my anxiety. Maybe this is something you‚Äôd feel comfortable talking to your physician about? They can help show you different resources and medications. Getting help isn‚Äôt giving up it‚Äôs just helping yourself be a happier person. Sorry I feel like I kind of ranted on at you. Hope something in here helped a little.

legaladvice,fdpldg9,t3_emlxa3,1578631855.0,Is there an adult that you trust going to for help? Maybe a school counselor? They can call and have you forces to be returned home  if you just leave. Also any evidence you do have I‚Äôd save it somewhere that if they take your phone you can still access it. Please be safe.

I also had a friend a few years ago that had a reserved seat set up for his dad. The chair had a really pretty little piece of fabric going across the chair with his dads name, a picture frame with his picture and his bible that he always used.

Hope you find something. I think it‚Äôs beautiful you‚Äôre trying to do this for your mom."

Advice,fd00br5,t3_ejr1wj,1578111705.0,I personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs crossing a line. I think you should only tell her if that‚Äôs something you want to share though. Not just because you think you should. I really feel like it‚Äôs whatever you‚Äôre comfortable with.

depression,fczvt74,t3_ejr32d,1578109466.0,It‚Äôs never a bad idea to find a good therapist to talk to. Please be patient with yourself and the progress. It may take awhile to adjust to talking to someone and you might have to try more than therapist till you find someone you like. It‚Äôs nice to talk to someone who doesn‚Äôt have any skin in the game.

depression,fcroloi,t1_fcrj76w,1577904541.0,That‚Äôs exactly what you need to tell them too. Explain that you want to explore all of your options. Please know that everyone is different and some people medication is their best option and you can find a good balance for you. Of course it‚Äôs your choice and you can explore more natural options as well first! You seem like you‚Äôre really trying to work on all of this which is great!
depression,fcridj1,t1_fcrhnrk,1577902212.0,Maybe try and teach out to another. I‚Äôve gone to 2 different ones. It‚Äôs all about if you can mesh with your therapist. If you don‚Äôt mesh well I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll make that amazing of progress. Maybe go to your pcp and ask if they have any recommendations? Or if you‚Äôre in school ask for resources from a school counselor.
depression,fcrg8dn,t1_fcrbavo,1577901414.0,Have you tried talking to a therapist? I think the better you can understand yourself as a person the better you can cope in ways that help you specifically. Maybe a hobby that‚Äôs something that helps you escape front he world?
movies,fcrbqcl,t3_eikjc6,1577899662.0,Team Edward. While I think Jacob is more attractive I love Edwards personality and he seems like a genuinely good guy. Jacob always have more of a territorial feel rather than protecting out of true love.
depression,fcratpl,t1_fcr9pk1,1577899274.0,I think that you‚Äôll realize sooooo much will change in that amount of time. I looked at your other posts and I can say I‚Äôm only 24 but I have struggled with depression for many years but I had the same kind of thoughts at your age. I still struggle but your early 20s you‚Äôll experience  sooo much more than you could even imagine. I can‚Äôt speak for you but this is just my experience. I try to remember moments in my life that I really thought that I would never be able to overcome. Those moments become things you don‚Äôt think about anymore and you realize you can make it past anything.
Cheap_Meals,fcr8au0,t1_fcr5icj,1577898245.0,Lol I had to try it after seeing it over and over in a fb group I‚Äôm in. This was my first time using it and I just put it on the broccoli. It was pretty good.

I was in a car accident recently and got one of the acupuncture mats I kept seeing on fb for my back pain.

slowcooking,fci9pq4,t3_ehag37,1577659471.0,"Tbh this was just a really quick and easy meal  

The roast I seasoned with salt and pepper and the crazy was a premade mix from aldi called pub mix for slow cookers. I cooked it on low for 8 hours. 

The potatoes are red russet potatoes cut into quarters (I leave the skins on)  boiled in salted water until you can easily put a fork through them. Used a potato masher and then a hand mixer to add butter, sour cream, salt, pepper, milk.  I don‚Äôt really use measurements so I taste as I go and add more of whatever I feel it‚Äôs missing. The crazy on the mashed potatoes is Just what the roast cooked in. 

The Mac and cheese is actually just boxed aldi brand shells and cheese with butter, milk, shredded cheese and pepper added.
