How can you be both in charge of the car and lose control simultaneously? Who thought that was a good idea?

Where I'm from a parent, or anyone who've had their license for X years, can teach a kid to drive, but they need to pass an instructors test (everyone who has a license should be able to pass easily and it's cheap to do) and rig a brake pedal and mirrors for the passengers seat so they can stop the car.

AskCulinary,fen5rl2,t1_fen1g88,1579277586.0,"I have studied and worked in kitchens back in the day, yeah, although I ended up doing something else fairly quickly. Some kitchens and people were pretty great and some not so much. If you can't get the plates out on time in a normal situation, someone is doing a poor job, that's just a fact. They should go out all together, and if you can't manage that without an excuse the process is broken. Maybe you have too few people running the kitchen, maybe you designed your menu badly, maybe the servers can't handle their end, whatever, something isn't working. 

The trick is to not get yourself into too bad of a situation in the first place. That requires a lot of planning and figuring out how to make things easier for you and what can be done to release that pressure when it hits you. In places I worked at the servers used to time the guests and their orders so they wouldn't bring in more than the kitchen could handle at once.

It's all about organization and planning. If you always end up rushed so bad you can't keep up you have to change your process so that you won't.

Clearly you have only very crappy restaurants where you're from if that's what you think. Timing the dishes is a very basic skill any trained cook can do, not a super hard skill only possible for the very best professionals.

If you can't win a hockey game in a full hour of play, you don't deserve to win it."
ShitAmericansSay,fdmlk4l,t1_fdmhuda,1578554519.0,In my experience after a long time working in hospitality and in an international airport Americans tend to think its really important to learn a few basic words for all the local languages of the countries they visit. That's not something most other nationalities seem to do that much.
ThatLookedExpensive,fdg45wr,t1_fdeiusy,1578379325.0,"There are places with roads going through ice, they'd definitely be covered by all  local insurance just like any other road use."
ThatLookedExpensive,fdg41kf,t1_fdegsm3,1578379195.0,"A lot of roads actually do drive through lakes. There's plenty of places where they have proper, maintained official roads part of the year during the winter. They're usually connecting islands to mainland or shortcuts through bigger lakes or something. There's definitely some here in Finland and Sweden and I bet Russia has some as well. This picture is from Russia."

ACMilan,fddm51p,t1_fddgn7t,1578317443.0,"Very few, most are Evangelical Lutherans with an Orthodox minority.

My upbringing wasn't religious enough to tell you how important this day is for either group, though."
ACMilan,fddg1wx,t1_fdcm9hn,1578310668.0,"I thought it was, it's a holiday here in Finland and we're not particularly religious."
nonononoyes,fdde7rz,t1_fdczshx,1578308157.0,"That's reasonable. My cat got scared so bad he pissed himself when we came across the neighbors big black dog in the stairwell.

That dog was just chilling, didn't bark or anything, just stared at the cat curiously. Then seconds later I'm holding a furry piss cannon trying to aim my cat away from everyone. Just a stream of piss all over."
