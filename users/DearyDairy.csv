australia,ffc8xck,t1_ffbf75a,1579794237.0,"... Huh?

Kilojoules and calories are just different ways of measuring energy potential. Neither are inaccurate units of measurement. You can convert between kj and cal with pretty good accuracy provided your original number is accurate. 

Not all calories are the same? 

That's like saying ""not all centimetres are the same"" or ""not all kilos are the same"" 

If course all calories are the same, it's a unit of measurement. 1 calorie always contains 1 calorie. 

Certain testing and notation methods in food calorie content can be inaccurate because of shady shit the company does. For example in the US if it's less than 4 calories per serve, you can legally call it zero calories. So that's bullshit.

Then because America doesn't do the ""per 100g"" thing, if you're trying to use the nutritional label to do the maths, and 1 serve =5g=0cal, then 100g would also be zero cal... Except it's not, it could be 60.

If you're trying to say not all bodies metabolise energy the same way, fine, you can say that. I mean, statistically speaking we do all metabolise energy the same way, it's just some people are more or less efficient... But that doesn't mean the calories they eat are different, it's how they're used by the body that's different. 

I personally think it's the recommended daily intakes that are unhelpful. As a 5ft tall disabled woman my energy RDI is half that of the label, but my RDI for micronutrients is similar to the label.

At the end of the day, a calorie is a calorie and it's just as accurate as kilojoules for the purposes of tracking food intake.

The problem is that a large number of people don't have access to accurate information regarding their personal total daily energy expenditure, and even when people do know their tdee, without a food scale, cooking everything from scratch, or accurately labled food, tracking your calories properly is difficult for people who already have busy lives and existing food habits."

I've been bouncing around job providers since I left high school. I struggle to work enough hours to maintain a liveable wage due to illness, DHS has done their relevant work capacity assessments and my benchmark is 20 hours a fortnight, which has been sustainable for my health.

Every now and then centerlink will randomly increase my hours to 30 per fortnight and the decision always comes as a shock to both me and my job provider, and we rush around to organise a capacity reassessment while I fail my benchmark or manage to scrape over my benchmark at the detriment of my health, then I get reassessed after a few months of getting angry SMS messages about my employment plan, centerlink apologises for the increase and puts me back on 20 hours. Rinse and repeat once or twice a year.

In the past I've had job providers who don't even treat me like a number, it's somehow worse, I'm like a shit someone took on the footpath between a provider and their pay day.

I've had providers who would offer no help with job seeking beyond resume writing workshops or interview skills classes (I didn't have issues with me resume or interviewing, I had issues actually finding job listing's I was qualified and physically capable of, I had trouble physically getting to work due to transport, I had issues getting all the ID I needed to start work because I couldn't understand the forms I was given.

I heard of people saying providers would take them to get ID and physically help them get to the post office, or help them fill out their police check forms. I always wondered why my providers didn't offer those services (I asked, they said centerlink is responsible for a mobility allowance if I need help with myki, and I need a disability support worker for the other stuff because it's my disability that's the problem not my vocational barriers) 

Ive had providers litterly say ""there's this opportunity at a clothing warehouse. It's a fairly standard warehouse storage management and packaging position"" and then just stare at me waiting for me to say something, so I reply ""that sounds great, I've never done anything like that before, but it sounds like I'm supposed to carry boxes around? Are you sure this is a sustainable job?"" and they flat out say ""oh... yeah... I recommend you don't take your crutches to the the interview, you don't have to disclose your disability, it's your choice""

Bitch are you hearing yourself? Leave my crutches at home? Am I supposed to levitate into the building and telepathically move boxes? If I could ignore my disability enough to not even need to bring it up in an interview I wouldn't be struggling to find work!

I rarely stuck with a provider for more than a year. I'd be on jobseeking for a few months, if I was lucky I'd start in the DES steam but usually I'd have to wait for some internal review of my case. Then after a few months of being unable to find a full and consistent 10 hours per week work, they'd push me into a short course I wasn't really interested in let alone suitable for me. Like, I got my RSA, but what good is that for me when I'm physically incapable of carrying an open drink without shoving two fingers in it and carrying it around at my hip?


I found lots of odd jobs, but they'd schedule me 8 hours one week 12 the next, 5 the week after, then they'd try to schedule me for 16 and even though it averaged out to 20 hours per fortnight, it never added up with what centerlink needed for the specific dates, and those odd 16 hour weeks would throw me off health wise for ages. 

When pushing me into study, my provider would always feed me some bullshit false hope like ""studying will keep centerlink off your back for a few months, by then you might have what you need for your DSP application"" 

They kept leading me to believe I was  eligible for DSP, no matter how many times I reminded them I'm not eligible they were like ""well last time you weren't, but you can apply again in [time period]. And you never know, I've seen people much less disabled get it"" 

But my disability hasn't changed so why would I suddenly become eligible? These people are supposed to help me get my shit together with accurate information regarding my options.

I'd get halfway through the course they pushed me into, and they'd move me from jobseeking DES to study, then finish my course, and I'd get a letter from centerlink telling me I have a new provider because I'm now just a regular jobseeker. I'd get my work capacity reassessed, then be moved to DES again. Rinse and repeat, with a few months break here and there for some jobs that I thought would pan out but didn't. 

My current provider is the best I've had, I've been with them for 3 years. I was still employed when I got involved with them (a job I found with zero help from a provider.) I was having issues at work because I was having acute health issues on top of my disability and I'd used all my sick leave, so I was taking leave without pay and after a few months my savings were dried up, I was managing half a shift a week between hospital visits and various therapies.  I wasn't getting better so I asked centerlink what I'm supposed to do for money in the meantime, I'm not unemployed, I'm just sick, and they basically said call them back when I've been laid off. I felt really cornered financially so after crying in my bosses office for half an hour I quit, and was promptly put back on jobseekers. Fortunately because my previous employer reported my health as a reason for leaving, my work capacity assessment was expedited and I went straight into DES. 

I'm not sure if I just got lucky and found a provider that at least appears to give a shit. Or maybe because I was really sick when I started with them they can see my progress more clearly compared to other providers who perhaps thought my lack of improvement was from lack of trying.... Vs, you know, having already reached my full capacity. 

Within a month my provider had found a role for me, I'd been searching on my own, I actually didn't realise this provider was also looking because it had been ages since a provider had helped even that much. My provider really had my back with that job. They'd properly vetted the job as something I could do in every capacity, they'd filled the employer in on my condition (I'd given them permission to do this because personally it think it makes sense) and then they went above and beyond to help me keep that job. My case manager would even pick me up from my house and drive me to the site since it changed each week and was often in the middle of nowhere, they'd call each week to ask how I was getting to work and if my only option was taxi/uber they'd either drive me themselves or they'd fight to get me a taxi voucher (centerlink couldn't offer any mobility allowance because my employers office was located within my own suburb.... But the job involved delivering in house training to organisations across the entire state. Yes, you can get public transport to some places, but I had a projector and class materials to carry, and it's hard enough to carry that stuff to the driveway with crutches let alone carry it on public transport. Plus once you've got a train to somewhere like Bendigo, you *still* need a taxi because it was rarely walking distance from the station for someone like me. 


I've been part of this companies network for almost 3 years, I've moved into a new and better role, twice. it's the longest I've ever been sustainably employed and I've never felt more secure and happy. My company is currently paying for a 2 year course that I actually want, which with a clear pathway to how this will advance my current career. 

Now don't get me wrong. The last three years, I am constantly on the phone to centerlink as I'm locked out of online services for failure to hit my benchmark hours.

I still have issues with some weeks being 8 hours and others being 16 (though my current company is good at ensuring if I have a 16 hour week it's 4 hours on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, not 8 hours on Monday then immediately again on Tuesday. Which so far I'm managing to balance this with my health provided it doesn't happen 3 weeks in a row... That happened in October and it was rough).

And centerlink keeps getting confused with whether I'm a jobseeker, student or post placement. It seems every letter or text I get puts me in a different stream and while I normally receive a newstart wage subsidy payment, every now and then I get a jobseekers payment or study payment and I have to call them to let them know... Because I just know that the *one time* I don't let them know, they're going to turn around and tell me I wrongly received a payment and I'll get cut off for months. It's the same dollar amount, it's just confusing because the name of the payment changes randomly and whenever the payment name changes my reporting date also changes. So I call to clarify what reporting period they actually need, and they're like ""yeah, that's weird, you're definitely on a wage subsidy. I've fixed it. Your reporting dates are back to normal. Is that all today?""  and I'm like ""well technically, but can we stop this happening again?"" and the answer is ""I don't know why it happened in the first place... Call again if it happens again""


Fuck Job Service Providers, but mostly, Fuck this broken system for privatising the capacity building side of of welfare support.

The few good job providers who actually care are quickly crushed by what is expected of them. I'm so grateful for my provider for doing their best to keep centerlink off my back - I'm working as hard as I can at a company that wants to keep me. The difference between getting 40 hours per 28 day period and 40 hours per calander month shouldn't matter.

australia,ffbsc4o,t1_ffa1n4l,1579780886.0,"I specifically opted in back in 2014 because I was really struggling to get my records sent where they needed to be. I had multiple specialists in different fields and I felt like everyone was ordering the exact same tests and no one was talking to each other. I was getting sicker as I was bounced between disciplines, and I couldn't even remember the name of the doctors I was seeing let alone what we'd discussed. I needed a central hub for that information. I wrongly assumed my GP was that hub. 

So I signed up and gave all my doctors and other providers consent to compile my records.

My ehealth record is still completely empty. But my current GP has managed to track down enough of my scattered records that my situation is a little more clear.

I still remember trying to get my records from my old GP. It took me months, they wanted me to send a literal cheque in the mail, then they quoted me $270 to transfer my records (I could not afford that. When I was finally got it sorted, they only handed over like 6 files and I'm like ""excuse me? I've been here for 10 years, I've had multiple surgeries, and you're charging me a full weeks income just to mail my doctor 6 pieces of paper?"", turns out I was in their system 4 times, and it ended up being two boxes full of stuff. When they finally shipped the archive boxes I took it to my my new GP and it was the first time I heard him swear. He took one look, asked what the fuck it was, and looked absolutely defeated when he called them to learn they didn't give out complete digital records, but my GP could request digital files individually. 

He's been helping me go through it every few months when we're waiting for an examination room to open up. I'm learning some pretty annoying stuff like the time I went to the doctor 14 times in 2 years with symptoms of cytolytic vaginosis, they swabbed me for candidia, it would come back negative for candidia but they'd diagnose me with thrush on ""clinical observations"". I remember so clearly being told ""you have thrush, you need fluconazole"" and yet we are yet to find a single test (we've found 8 culture tests in the box so far) that was ever positive for thrush, meanwhile every test since the earliest we've found has clearly shown I had cytolytic vaginosis. I wasn't treated for CV until 7 years after symptoms developed. But apparently it was showing up on that very first test."

... Yeah, I've lost 3 jobs where I've been directly asked to wear make up or heels, and later let go for failure to comply with manager recommendations for professional development. 

I don't feel pressure to wear make up to a job interview. But I've been told by previous case managers (I'm part of a disability employment sponsorship program) that I *need* to. 

I once lost my disability support for 6 months because I was accused of throwing an interview. 

Long story short, I'd told my case manager I'd love to work in a store as a cashier. I was picturing Woolworths or IGA. They set me up with an interview at MAC. I tried to do my research on the company, but there's only so much you can do when you don't wear make up, didn't even know the brand existed before getting an interview, and the best thing you can think of to sell yourself during the interview is to focus on how brands that have good representation of their customers within their advertising and staffing have better customer relationships, and that my demographic is an under-represented group in the cosmetic industry and I can be a friendly face in that linimal space for people who are just getting started with expressing themselves through make up.

Yeah, obviously I didn't get the job. The feedback the welfare department got was so boilerplate that they flagged it (usually my interview reports were more specific such as ""she's great, but she's not medically fit for this job"" or ""we'd totally hire her, but the job position is full time and she's only cleared for part time"") and it took forever to get to the conclusion that I did indeed try my best.


In my current job, I get comments all the time about how I look tired and sick, but I've worked here long enough that regular staff know this is just my face. I also get weird comments from people in make up telling me I'm ""brave"" for going out bare faced.

My current industry is dominated by 55-75 year old women. So the ratio of make up to no make up is 50-50 anyway, but it's very rare. I've worked in a lot of different industries and I'm yet to find one that's 100% free from make up shaming."

Make up removers are incredibly wasteful, contain drying agents and every single sheet is made with plastic fibres. Depending on how much heavy you apply your make up, or the duration or pigmentation of the product, you can easily use 3-5 make up remover sheets to get back to a bare enough face to even consider using a white towel to dry.

It's much easier for your wallet, face and bin, just to buy 3 brown face towels from the dollar store to use as designated make up towels so you can control what cleaner you are using while still getting mechanical exfoliation from scrubbing.

I don't wear make up but thanks to psoriasis I still don't use white towels because they get stained. I just have 2 red wash clothes. I've had them for 10 years now. Use one, then wash it out quickly by hand, at the end of the week just throw it in with other clothes for a full wash cycle."

My hearing isn't any better, there's nothing that can be done for the type of loss I have, it's ever so gradually fading, but it will stabilise in my 40-50s, and fortunately it's unlikely to ever reach profound levels, RSHL rarely does. Most of the improvements in my life are due to being aware of having a physical issue. I now know how to identify when I'm having genuine hearing trouble vs just unfocused/distracted/anyone would struggle to hear. And knowing what I'm missing out on - for example I know I'm not going to be able to hear my boss on a tele-conference call, so I physically go in for meetings or request my boss Skype me so I can at least get some visual cues. That way I'm not asking ""pardon?"" 40,000 times during a meeting, or giving myself a headache trying to strain. 

>And what about music and stuff? Did you just not get the appeal of music lol? 

I love music! Even profoundly deaf people love music. 

My hearing loss is very mild, but even profoundly deaf people love music.I have eclectic tastes and would listen at the same volumes as everyone around me.  Though as a teen I did notice that certain songs had more depth at higher volumes. This was partly due to me only being able to hear the full range of a song when all of it was above a certain volume. 

Basically if my phone or phones has an equaliser, I set it up to reflect my audiograph results. So it pitch-shifts audio to match what range my ears comfortably pick up. 

Now I'm listening to songs I liked as a teen saying ""hey babe, did you know there's this deep humming vocals during this time guitar solo, has that always been there?"" 

Before that, growing up, it was more like listening to a song and thinking ""oh, ok, I can hear really, really quiet humming... But at this volume the guitar solo is defeaning, so I can't appreciate the vocals, I have to turn the volume down"" and as a result certain harmonies were lost on my completely. But most music isn't experimenting with the outer limits of the human auditory range, so I don't miss much at all. 



>Did you always turn the tv up to unbearable volume and not understand why everyone around you kept asking for it to be turned down?

Yes and no. I would constantly complain about that the sound guy at the studio needs to be fired.

I can't hear the protagonist, but I can hear the high pitched hum of the fluorescent lights the foley artist dubbed in. No matter how loud I made it, it's like the audio wasn't clear enough in the initial recording. It would actually hurt my ears as the protagonist said certain words because it was so loud, but then other words would be barely audible in the sense I heard sounds but they might as well have been a foreign language because I didn't hear the vowel sounds nessesary to create words. 

I think the complaint that ""dialogue is too quiet and explosions are too loud"" is pretty common with TV in general.

Basically, I'd complain that the TV was simultaneously too loud and indistinguishable.

I always knew when the TV was too loud, so I never had it turned up to where other people asked me to turn it down. So I'd usually just get frustrated that despite it being so loud I still couldn't understand the words being said and just stop watching.  I don't think I've watched anything without closed captioning since 2012.

There are certain classic movies I've never seen because I get halfway through Act 1, and I have no idea what anyone is saying so I just stop watching and make a mental note to watch again if I ever stumble across a version with subtitles.

Although there was one time 4 years ago my neighbour banged on my door and told me to keep it down.

I wasn't really doing anything - from memory I was just sending emails. so I ignored it. Then when they knocked and yelled again I opened the door, and asked really rudely ""what!?"" because I had no idea why they were telling me to be quiet. My neighbour replied ""oh, I'm sorry, I could have sworn it was coming from here, wow, it's even worse for you"" then just left. 


I assumed my neighbour was being a pedantic senile old man until my partner got home and asked if someone was renovating upstairs because there was this weird droning noise. I couldn't hear it but my partner ended up walking to the 7-11 in the middle of the night to buy ear plugs.

It depends what the underlying cause is. Could be as simple as the kid needs his earwax medically flushed out. 

For hearing loss, There's early occupational therapy to learn coping mechanisms, there's early aural therapy that can help maintain functioning, there's hearing aides, adaptive technology, different language skills, new languages, early development interventions, study and workplace accommodations that you may not have thought to use but using them actually makes things way more achievable. 

For the most part it's just awareness. This kid might be getting average grades so one one is worried about him, but if his teachers let him sit closer to the front, utilise more visual learning techniques, provide this kid with more visual learning aides vs pure auditory learning, then he could improve even more.

In my case, earlier occupational intervention would have helped me to be prepared for when I struggled to transition from high school to uni where most of my studies moved from taking notes from books to taking notes during lectures. My family and it never really chased up medical issues, especially if we were tested and told it's normal. You just accepted your new normal and got on with it. 

I didn't know I had hearing issues, I'd been directly told my hearing was fine. So I didn't even know where to begin to help myself study better because at the end of the day I swear the issue is in not hearing the lecture properly or easily without headaches.

I started learning Auslan when I was in uni which is fine, but learning a second language in adulthood is way harder than doing it as a kid, it's fine because I've got plenty of time to learn with my rate of loss, but it's very difficult to find time to study when you're dealing with everything else adult life throws at you."

Anticonsumption,fdz288z,t1_fdyavk4,1578785903.0,"I asked my grandmother what they did before garbage bags.

For starters, there was less need for garbage services.

A man literally came right to your door to collect compost, fabric scraps, and bones which you separated into two different buckets. You'd just wash the buckets after emptying.

There wasn't much packaging, the ""dustbin"" really was just a bin for dust, maybe a few broken bottles.

Everything else you could return to the store and it was shipped back to the manufacturer for reuse, or the grocery store could directly refill it from bulk storage. or you'd have countless other uses for it in the home.

When I started trying to shop package free, the few grams of rubbish I did have - fruit stickers, some twist ties, the plastic foil from the top of the milk bottles, dust from my vaccum, etc), I'd fold it up in an old newspaper.

I got multiple letters from my local council stating I needed to ensure all my waste was enclosed in a bag. They recommended putting a padlock on my bin if I suspected that passers-by on the street were throwing unwrapped newspaper in my bin.

So now when I drop off the soft plastic recycling at the supermarket I also bring my newspaper envelope of rubbish and throw it in a public bin which is already lined with a bin bag. Because I refuse to buy bin bags just to throw away.


I even tried getting creative. If I had a bag of frozen peas, it's a plastic bag right? I'd put my garbage in there and tie it off... Nope, still got a letter saying my garbage was inappropriately sealed for collection, it must be in a garbage bag.

Fuck off, why can't I just put my trash in the bin. It's a machine on the back of the truck that tips the bin into the truck so it's not like the poor garbo runs the risk of getting trash on them, then I hose out my bin when it's dirty!"

Right, but they could still be at risk of cancers originating from the penile, or other epithelial cells used to craft their vagina?

They could still have cancer that starts in the vagina, it would just technically not be from ""vaginal"" tissue in the strictest sense.

I think saying ""vaginal cancer"" is accurate because even if the tissues aren't biologically vaginal tissue, it's cancer, and it's in that woman's vagina.

Calling it ""cervical cancer"" is what confused me. I wasn't sure if they craft a cervix or what (I'd never heard of this, so that article confused me because it made it sound like SRS surgeons make a structure that resembles a cervix - in definitely didn't assume they were ""putting a cervix in"", the first successful uterus transplant was only a few years ago, so there's no way that would be routine), but it sounds like a trans woman has something similar to what I've got, a vaginal cuff.

LifeProTips,fdk2lxo,t1_fdjzwms,1578494530.0,"Sort of, a sensation that it's not in the socket is probably due to lax ligaments, either due to an old injury, hypermobility, ligamentous laxity or a connective tissue disorder like EDS. This can cause the joint to subluxate, it's like a partial dislocation, it's technically still in the socket but it's not perfectly aligned, it could be putting pressure on one side of the socket, or beginning to slip out of the other side. If this only effects your hips and has happened your whole life, there could be some congenital issues with your pelvic socket angles.

Generally the movement you need to do to get it to feel right is very specific. They're a deep ""clunk"" noise and sensation, and you can't make that clunk noise repeat itself because that clunk noise was the joint going back where it belongs and its fixed now, it instantly feels better, but it will still ache for a while. 

Dancers hip is caused by tight ligaments in one area and lax ligaments in another area, they twang like a guitar string as they move over the head of the femur through lots of various movements like taking a step, bending over, crouching. You can make the noise repeat infinitely with every step (unlike fixing something that's subluxated where the noise only happens once), and no amount of decompressing or rotating the leg makes it feel any better, stretching and massage helps more than osteopathy or orthopaedic reduction.

For me, when I'm not moving, It feels like there's a tinter hook inside my leg pulling my sacroiliac joint down the side of my leg and twisting the back of my knee through via a pulley in my hip socket.

I should note that dancers hip is really common with hypermobility conditions, ligamentous laxity and EDS, so there's a chance you could be experiencing both types of issues and both sensations simultaneously.

[Volunteering Australia] (https://www.volunteeringaustralia.org/australian-bushfires-heres-how-you-can-help/#/) doesn't have a list of bushfire related volunteering opportunities, but they do offer some vague advice on what areas you could look into. 

I'd recommend the resources at [Victoria Alive] (https://www.victoriaalive.org.au/), it's a project developed specifically to help make volunteer work more accessible for people with disabilities and chronic illness.

---------

Personally when I started volunteering I really struggled to find flexible positions. I found some great opportunities and when meeting with the coordinator they boasted that they were perfect for people with disabilities because the duties and tasks were not strenuous and were accessible.

 However very few places understand the difference between static disability status, and the and dynamic disability caused by chronic illness.

With chronic illness, you don't always know when you'll have a good day until you have one, and you might not be able to give volunteer coordinators enough warning that you can or can't come in. 

When I volunteered, I helped in community museum gift shop, sorting inventory at vinnies, community garden work, lifestyle support in aged care, council event staff, and social support at a day program centre for people with more severe cognitive and intellectual disabilities. Every single one of those roles required me to be punctual and accountable and rostereed in for specific times. But as I'm sure you're well aware, chronic illness doesn't like to follow a roster. I'd have to call in sick on bad days, and I felt bad when I was having a good day but I wasn't rostereed and no one needed to swap.

Lots of places were honest with me, it was more work for their paid staff to have a volunteer they couldn't rely on to be healthy enough when rostered. I was better off finding something else. 

I wasn't really in a position to volunteer until I had a better treatment plan and my illness was more predictable, and because my illness was more predictable it made more sense to get paid work for the 10 hours a week I'm able.

-------

So I guess what I'm saying is - unfortunately, calling specific charity groups directly is probably going to be your best bet because you're going to need to talk with them in depth about how they coordinate their volunteers and if this is suitable given your illness.

Depending on your situation, I'd recommend looking into services like the Red Cross Telecross or similar programs where your role is to call socially isolated or at risk people and just have a chat. Many of these can be done from home, and at the moment with many people worried about friends and family, having someone to talk to about anything and everything can help them avoid further anxiety. It can also help ensure that elderly and other at risk people on the call list are staying safe with all the air quality and heat issues.

I know that councils like Brimbank have their own version of social call services, so check with your local council in addition to charity services."

Oh yeah, this was my brand of fatlogic before I realised how moronic I was.

I'd skip breakfast, then when I got home I'd have 1000 calories worth of fruit juice and Nutella toast.  Then maybe an additional 500-700 calories of juice or chocolate or corn chips before dinner, then I'd have maybe 1/2 of the food my parents served me, and I'd tell them I'm not hungry enough to finish.

When they asked what I ate that day, I'd be honest, I'd had a few glasses of juice, two slices of toast with Nutella, and a handful (30-40g) of corn chips.

My parents would mutter to themselves that ""hm, that's not much food, you need to eat the rest of your dinner"" sometimes I would, sometimes I wouldn't.

On nights I didn't finish my dinner, the idea that I hadn't eaten much food really got in my head.

I didn't understand that calories are what matters, and while the volume of food I ate was less than what some people would consider average, the calories were more than what my 5ft disabled body needed.

Even to this day, I'll occasionally think to myself ""I haven't eaten all day! I'm going to have a big dinner *and* rich dessert"" then I'll remember the 3 coffee's I've had, equalling 400-500 calories, and have a modest dinner and small dessert so I can hit my 1600 calorie TDEE."

That was my experience asking my dad to take me to the doctor.

My mother was much like me, she knew when something didn't feel quite right about what the doctor said and she would take me to a different doctor for a second opinion. But after 5+ doctors all give you the same feeling of ""that doesn't sound right"" (even if all 5 doctors are giving you 5 different answers) then you start to get a reputation as a doctor shopper, or you start to wonder if the common denominator is you and your incorrect gut feeling, and you start to try and reason with yourself that the doctors are right, it's just constipation/anxiety/normal period pain/stress headaches/whatever and any lingering sense of ""hm, that answer doesn't feel right"" is because you're crazy and a mild hypochondriac.

Some doctors have mistaken this for health anxiety because I have questions about things we both know are minor - for example, I have dancers hip, it painfully snaps, I asked about some physical therapy exercises so I could manage the pain it causes, instead I got a lecture about how it's a benign common phenomenon and I shouldn't worry about it... I'm not ""worried"", I'd just like to do more to keep my hip as healthy as possible)

(my current doctor actually developed a care plan for me! I've been asking previous doctors for years if this is possible, they said it was unnecessary because I was so young and care plans are for ""really sick people"". But I have two chronic illnesses and I struggled to stay on top of all the therapies and treatments, having a care plan had helped so much and I have less health issues as a result, my current doctor agreed with me that if a care plan helps prevent further illness, then it should be utilised, his job is to set things up to make sure I don't have to see him for the small things)"

cfs,fdidv1c,t3_elbkjv,1578440668.0,"Temporary peripheral neuropathy is normal when sitting or sleeping in a position that puts pressure on certain nerves.

Everyone will experience this at least a few times in their life.

With CFS you may be more prone to it because the body shifts less in your sleep, and changing position can be impossible depending on your energy.

You may think that you're in a neutral position and not putting pressure on a nerve, but just lying still long enough can sometimes cause this, especially in areas like the shoulders and knees, resulting in numb arms, fingers and toes.

The three things to look out for to know if this is normal or something serious.

1) how long does it last? Once you notice the numbness and start moving the limb again, how long does it remain numb? 20 seconds to 2 minutes is common, anything up to 5 minutes is considered within the range of normal. Any longer and you should talk to your doctor, it could be the start of a neuropathic illness.

2) is it numb with normal function, or numb and paralised? When the numbness goes away, does full function return? If full function doesn't return even after the numbness subsides, or if full function does eventually return but it's taking longer than the 5 minutes mentioned above, it's time to talk to your doctor.

3) do you experience this numbness even when awake and moving around? For example, have you ever been doing the dishes or going for a walk when you get the same numbness in your feet or arms despite having been moving them? Time to talk to your doctor."

As far as I know, they are more rare to see performed. I just hear so many women saying that's the kind they want, then after a consultation and getting more information about the procedure they usually end up with a total hysterectomy anyway.


I know many doctors are dubious of patients who say they've had a partial hysterectomy.

There are a lot of people out there who even after a total hysterectomy wrongly believe they've had a partial hysterectomy soley because they still have their ovaries.

Lots of people think a total hysterectomy= uterus+tubes+ovaries, and a partial hysterectomy=just uterus.

They don't realise that having your ovaries and or tubes removed is a separate procedure (oophorectomy and salpingectomy, respectively) so they say ""total hysterectomy"" as short hand.

Doctors have had to deal with so many women saying ""I've had a partial hysterectomy"" only to find no cervix, they just assume that anyone claiming a partial hysterectomy is misinformed.

But calling it a supracervical should highlight that you know exactly what your talking about. That doctor you saw sounds very rude to repeatedly dismiss your report on the status of your body."
childfree,fdibluo,t1_fdgx8s9,1578439280.0,">Did the doctor put the ""vaginal cuff"" in the right spot? Will there be scar tissue that will make sex hard/impossible?

OMG, I had the exact same thoughts!

My partners penis is quite curved so I was wondering if the majority of the scar tissue would be on the anterior or posterior wall of my vagina and if either would cause pain because of my partners anatomy.

But as a sewer I tried to picture it, and realised it would just be a straight seam at the end of a tube, or it would be like a basted circuit, or drawstring bag that's pulled closed. Either way, any scar tissue would only be at the top where my cervix used to be, there was no incisions ""down"" my vaginal wall or anything. They'd literally just lopped the top off.

Trigger warning - illustrated and simulated surgical images: the following pictures helped me understand what the vaginal cuff looked like [This is what the surgeon is seeing via laproscopic/abdominal incisions. Looking down at the walls of the vagina after removing the uterus. (this is a hysterectomy training dummy) ](https://i.imgur.com/g3m8VGQ.jpg) and [These are some old-school suturing techniques for the vaginal cuff. ](https://i.imgur.com/jIopNBB.jpg) while I believe [This suturing method is the most commonly used. ](https://i.imgur.com/aI8ObQv.jpg)

>but what stitches of yours didn't heal properly and what happened?

First, a disclaimer, I have a connective tissue disorder. One of they defining symptoms is ""poor wound healing and increased risk of wound dehissence"" so when I talk about my stitches not healing well, it's almost certainly because of this pre-existing condition.

I had a laproscopic hysterectomy, so I had 4 suture sites total, one above my mons pubis, one in my belly button, one off to the side of my lower abdomen, and the vaginal cuff.

The mons pubis site developed atrophic scarring. This is nothing new, my knee scars are all atrophic and after my cholecystectomy in 2015 my substernal scar is really sunken and thin. No big deal.


In my country, follow ups are with your GP, not the original surgeon, and I'd just gotten a new GP who was still learning about my connective tissue disorder.

At 8 weeks, He removed the abdominal and umbilical stitches, said he'd leave the mons pubis ones an extra week to be safe, then looked inside my vagina, he said it looked good, I assumed he was removing those stitches too, because he then told me it was safe to have sex again. 

Long story short, the vaginal cuff was not fully healed, because when my partner and I had sex the first time I felt like I'd torn a muscle in my pelvic floor (the pain was similar to when I tore my knee), and there was a ton of blood. We went to the ER, they said I'd ""popped my stitches"" and they flushed the area and did something to reseal the wound but they weren't very good on the communication front - I later learned they used dermabond. I had to take antibiotics just to be safe. 

I waited 8 weeks, then tried again, and once more I had pain (not as much) and bleeding (lighter than last time) so this time I just saw my GP asap.

Because this was the second time it happened he called my surgeon on speaker and the two off them looked up complications of hysterectomy associated with my connective tissue disorder.

That's when my surgeon realised he'd used the wrong type of stitching - he'd used the right kind of nylon on all my external incisions, but he'd used dissolvable stitches in my vaginal cuff, and they'd dissolved before I'd fully healed since I take longer to heal, and basically left a really weak bond between the incision site walls, which easily split open. My doctor had a look inside at what was going on this time, I'd only just started to very slightly dehiss the wound, it was only a few millimetres at one end. My doctor could see that the rest of the incision was dermabond.

So he put in some actual, nylon thread stitches, and 4 weeks after that I had them removed. A total of 20 weeks without sex.

But it's been 3 years since then and I don't hold back in my sex life, and I've had no issues since that initial delayed recovery."

I had cervical motion tenderness (chandeliers sign) which caused me to be incredibly light-headed from pain when my cervix was touched let alone rammed. I passed out a few times with rough partners and during pap smears. 

It took me a long time after my hysterectomy to have ""trust"" in my vagina, I was still really hesitent and gentle with it for almost a full year post op - but then I did have issues with the stitches not healing properly so there was additional fear behind having more rough sex.

But I never realised how much my cervix effected my sexual function.

I've heard some people are nervous about total hysterectomies (as opposed to a partial/supracervical hysterectomy where the cervix is left intact) because they worry it will be effect sexual function. Unless there are major complications with healing, or you are the type of person to really enjoy having your cervix hit during sex, then this is absolutely isn't the case. My hysterectomy has been the best decision I ever made for so many reasons, and sexual pleasure is one of those reasons."

Depending where you live, some women's prisons don't provide menstrual products and expect the women to buy them using commissary money (which not everyone has), some prison do provide menstrual products, but a ridiculous amount (7 pads per period should be enough, that's one a day!). Some provide enough pads but the quality is worse than toilet paper wads so you leak no matter how hard you try.

You don't have access to cleaning supplies 24/7, you need to speak with someone to arrange to be able to clean something. Again, depending on the prison, there can be repercussions to *accidentally* leaking, so some women probably don't want to ask for cleaning supplies if it means they'll have meals cut, or recreational time reduced.

In some cases, bodily fluids in women's prisons is an act of protest - a way to demand access to suitable menstrual products. In other situations, it's a result of a broken system of poor products and punishment for unavoidable accidents.... And in some situations it's because women are just gross, I'm not going to deny it, I've tried to pee in a public bathroom after a hover-pisser has sprayed the seat, and I myself have had brain fog on heavy period days and spent so long making sure everything was wrapped and thrown away properly, no stains on the toilet seat etc, then completely forgotten to actually flush the tequila sunrise coloured material in the toilet."

OP actually has there terminology a bit confused.


A partial hysterectomy is also known as a supracervical hysterectomy, it's where they leave part of the cervix behind.

A total hysterectomy removes the entire uterus, cervix and all.

A radical hysterectomy removes the uterus and some surrounding connective tissue.

A salpingectomy removes the the fallopian tubes.

An oophorectomy removes the ovaries.

You can have a total hysterectomy performed at the same time as a salpingectomy and oophorectomy, so you wake up with everything gone.

Most radical hysterectomies are performed with a salpingectomy and oophorectomy because they need to remove everything to prevent the spread of cancers.

If you don't have an oophorectomy, or an oophohysterectomy, then your ovaries are not being removed!

Apparently, he thought they put a vaccum up your vagina to suction out a few eggs, then put them in a vacuum sealed package and froze them.

I explained that first you need several months of drugs to prepare the ovaries to release multiple eggs, the drugs increase the risk of certain cancers, as well as ovarian cysts and torsion. The drugs can cause side effects that mimic early pregnancy.

Then you have to time the egg harvesting perfectly with the eggs maturity, and it's removed with a giant needle through your abdomen.

Mine had grown very attached to some of the tissues surrounding it, my doctor had to dig it out and cut a bit more tissue than she was expecting, she warned me about this action before doing it, I couldn't really refuse unless I wanted this thing in my arm the rest of my life but it was nice to be informed about what was happening with the procedure (apparently leaving it in is an option, there's no harm in keeping it in there, they can insert a new one in your other arm or just below the old one - but obviously if you're getting it removed because of side effects or to start a family while it's still got active hormones in it, leaving it in is not an option)

I was totally numbed up from the local anaesthetic. I couldn't feel a thing except for pressure where my doctor was holding my arm. She chatted to me about random stuff, the procedure took maybe 10 minutes tops from when she wheeled the trolley with the equipment in to when she said ""alright, you can sit up now"". I was lying on my back with my arm outstretched on an exam table, it was pretty comfy. 

She bandaged it up, and told me to leave it bandaged at least 48 hours.

When I took the bandage off, the incision was barely noticeable, it was about the size of a scabbed over pimple I'd been picking at.

The area around it bruised up a bit, but it wasn't a painful bruise. My arm felt a bit like I'd done an intense work out the day before, but it was way better than the week long ache I had following the insertion of the implant.

TrollXChromosomes,fcxw9o8,t1_fcwx36w,1578071353.0,"I still vividly remember my first gallbladder attack. It was 1am. The pain wasn't the worse I'd ever experienced (I'd dislocated my hip before, and I have occipital neuralgia, and that can get pretty bad) but the location and gripping nature of the pain made it all consuming. Combined with the nausea and vomiting, it was horrible. All in could think about was the pain. I knew it wasn't my appendix because that was gone already, and I knew it wasn't an ectopic pregnancy, or ovarian cyst or ovarian torsion. It was part self assessment and part innate knowledge of my body that gave me this clarity of ""oh, it's my gallbladder"".

Now I'd heard you're supposed to go to the ER for a gallbladder attack, but I also knew that gallbladder disease can be chronic. I'd had terrible experiences at the ER with rushed examinations, missed indications, and being sent home prematurely. (the appendix and dislocated hip being a prime example, don't even get me started on the bullshit I heard when going to the ER for those issues)

So I figured it would be quicker and less stressful to go to my regular doctor in the morning, since they have an ultrasound tech on site, then they can call into the hospital and refer me for any treatment nessesary.

I called my doctor first thing in the morning and she squeezed me into an appointment after I explained what I was going through.

She poked my abdomen, and sent me for an urgent ultrasound, the entire process was less than 30 minutes and she was able to confirm I had an inflamed gallbladder full of gallstones and an occluded duct. She faxed the hospital then phoned through the fax, and told me to go to the ER, she printed a copy of the referral for me to take in just in case.

I arrive at the ER, they tell me that my referral is being processed and triaged. I need to go home and wait for a phone call. They give me some mylanta and buscopan for the pain...

A week goes by, I call the hospital, this time they tell me to wait for a *letter*, I go back to my doctor, she writes a prescription for extended release ibuprofen and orders a liver function test.

My liver isn't doing so great, so she sends an update to the hospital and phones in again. She it's also met with red tape, and told my case is marked as urgent and I'll get a surgery spot when one is available, but I have to wait, I'm not dying.

3 more weeks pass, my doctor sends a referral to 2 other hospitals in my state which are ages away but at this stage I don't care, I'm having multiple gallbladder attacks every day, lasting up to 7 hours for the really bad ones. I'm losing weight from low appetite and vomiting, and my complexion is getting yellower by the day. When I am able to have a bowel movement, it's like someone mixed grey clay with chalk. 

My doctor is doing her best, she prescribes me ursodiol to try and dissolve the stones and finds an endoscopy clinic that does lithotripsy, initially they rejected me because my case needed surgery, after my doctor explained that I had been waiting on surgery for almost 2 months they tried any way.

I got some relief, but there were so many stones in my gallbladder within a week my duct was occluded again.

I went to the ER a total of 4 times because the attacks were so bad I couldn't cope at home. Each time they told me to take some ibuprofen and wait to get my letter, I was already in the system, what more did I want? if I was lucky someone would poke my belly or take a blood sample to update their file on my liver function. 

It was 5 months before I got a letter from the hospital saying that they had a surgery date available, on my birthday. I was so relieved, happy birthday! You're getting this thing cut out! 

I can still remember when the surgeon was doing rounds the morning after my procedure and talked to me about the surgical findings and said ""you were so close to experiencing biliary ischaemia, you really should have come to the ER instead of going through the subacute referral system""

I was livid. I could have given him a cholecystectomy with my bare hands.

In hindsight, I wasn't dying, I was able to survive those 5 months without any long lasting damage. So I guess they knew what they were on about when they said I could wait. Lots of people had lots of more emergent, life saving surgeries before me....but lots of people probably also got elective surgeries before me too
 I missed so much school and work, I was a mess of a human being, and emotionally it was traumatic to have acute pain and a diagnosis but still feel completely ignored and abandoned. Each night having an attack and not knowing if this time something was going to rupture or be cut off from blood supply. 

Also I have an incision between my breasts that never healed, and my surgeon just said something about my peritoneum when I asked why the incision was so high (why do they talk to you about serious stuff when you're still loopy from anaesthesia and alone!?).

I asked about options for managing the APD since I think that's more difficult to deal with than the RSHL - the RSHL makes it difficult feeling safe when walking through car parks, or talking on the phone, but in other areas of life it's a blessing: for example I live next to a highway and traffic noise keeps my partner awake but I can't hear it.

My mum had her hysterectomy under the private system, and she did not have insurance, but even then, it was only $7,000, which is nothing compared to what Americans might pay even with insurance.

I have no idea how insurance works in the US, my understanding is that every provider is different, and unlike in Australia where what they cover and don't cover is very clear and transparent, in America it seems like the insurance company is always trying to negotiate *not* to cover things and hiding how their coverage really works and constantly changing the rules. 

If you and your doctor can explore medical needs for a hysterectomy - for example if you've ever developed anaemia, if you have endometriosis, Aladenomyosis or fibroids, or if you have a mullerian anomaly (eg: bicornate uterus), pre menstrual dysphoric disorder, idiopathic dysmenorrhoea etc

There might be a way to get insurance to take some action. 


Again, I'm not sure if it's similar in America, but for example my GYN felt my primary need for a hysterectomy was my genetic condition, and my primary idiopathic dysmenorrhoea. Neither of which would be covered by Medicare, I'd have to go private. But because I had a family history of endometriosis he suggested my dysmenorrhoea could be due to occult endometriosis, he diagnosed me with occult endometriosis *then* submitted the hysterectomy request,  and hence it was covered by Medicare

My mother had her hysterectomy on the private system because she too had idiopathic dysmenorrhoea so Medicare wouldn't cover it... But upon removing the uterus they found stage 4 endo. And the exact same thing happened to me. I'd had a laproscopic explorative surgery in 2012 to rule out endometriosis, they found no abnormalities, but in 2016 during my hysterectomy they had to cut adhesions from my bowel, and my fallopian tubes were tangled with adhesions (but I was always planning on having them removed with the uterus because it's safer) so turns out I did have occult endometriosis that rapidly progressed to frank, stage 4 endometriosis in just 3-4 years.

You can ""re-activate"" silica gel packets by putting them in a sunny window on a dry day (ie: low/no humidity) or in an oven that's low enough to dehydrate. But I find the packets last years unless I accidentally get them wet, so I don't really bother with this.

TrollXChromosomes,fcoubba,t1_fcngjka,1577841761.0,"Aftercare is pretty easy. 

Diet: eat a balanced, high soluble fibre diet after surgery because you won't want to be passing any hard stools because your rectum is so close to your vagina and if you have a total hysterectomy, you will have stitches/dermabond in your vagina. I don't know about a partial hysterectomy (ie: supracervical hysterectomy)

Bleeding: You may have some vaginal bleeding as you heal, I didn't have much, but you should still wear a pad for a week post op.

Post op risks: They'll get you up and walking asap after surgery because there's a risk of pneumonia, prolapse and blood clots if you stay sedentary after a hysterectomy. They had me on blood thinners after surgery, and it's had to wear thrombolitic stockings to prevent clots. A physio visited to teach me ""deep breathing, lung clearing"" exercises, and how to bend, move, cough and poop without damaging my stitches. 

Bladder health: I had a urinary catheter in and honestly it was the most painful part, I wanted it removed so I could try and get up and go to the toilet, they kept telling me to try getting up and walking with it first, I felt busting and I just couldn't relax enough to let myself pee through it no matter how hard I tried. Long story short, it had gotten tugged at some point while I was still waking up from anaesthesia, so it wasn't working, hence the pain. So that wasn't good, but it's not because of the hysterectomy specifically. You will likely also have a catheter, so when you're allowed to have water by mouth after surgery, drink plenty, because a catheter increases your risk of a UTI

Exercise: Do pelvic floor exercises as soon as you feel able, start gentle and slow to just get the muscles warmed up, then as you heal more, you can return to doing them more intensely. Core exercises are important too.

Sex: No vaginal sex, insertion of any object or finger for ~ 8 weeks, and no oral sex without a dam for ~4 weeks to avoid infection or splitting the stitches.

Booking a follow-up appointment: Before you leave the hospital someone will examine your incisions (I had a laparoscopic hysterectomy, so I had stitches on my abdomen and in my vagina. If you have a devinci/NOS hysterectomy, you'll only have stitches in your vagina) then they determine if you need to come back in at 4,8, or 12 weeks to have your stitches removed. If you have dissolvable stitches or dermabond, your follow up appointment will just be a general recovery check up, and If you're recovering well you'll get the all clear from your doctor to resume normal activities, including sex.

------

My experience: For me, it took 10 hours post op to get up and walking slowly. I'd get up every hour to wander the ward. I was discharged 3 days post op, after a successful bowel movement. I was resting at home and doing the exercises I'd been given by the hospital physio, as well as taking gentle walks to the mailbox and back to the couch. Within 5 days I was doing housework again, everything except laundry and vacuuming because you're supposed to wait 10 days before lifting anything over 4kg. At 10 days I was pretty much back to my normal life. However I am disabled and don't really do anything more strenuous than walking or scrubbing the bathroom floor anyway.

At 8 weeks I got my external stitches removed and got the all clear to have sex if I wanted. Unfortunately because I have a connective tissue disorder, I definitely should have waited, I split my vaginal stitches and ended up in the ER, they flushed it, and used a dermabond type substance again and sent me home. It was pretty simple to fix and wasn't as painful as it sounds. However turns out that my connective tissue disorder makes dermabond petty useless, because a week later after a poop I was bleeding from my vagina, I went to my family doctor who sent me to the hospital, where they used real stitches to suture my vaginal cuff. All in all, I had to wait 20 weeks before I could have sex because my original surgeon had used the wrong suture method. (which was disappointing, because we'd discussed my connective tissue disorder, and he said he'd use nylons instead of dissolvable because that's what the protocol for my condition is... But he must have been on autopilot when doing my vaginal cuff, because he did do nylons for my abdominal incisions, oh well, no long term harm done)


As for long term follow up:

* **do I need hormones/oestrogen?**

I still have my ovaries so I produce all my own normal hormones. It's exactly like being off birth control and just letting your body do its own natural thing. Only no pregnancy and no periods.

If you have your ovaries removed you will go into instant menopause, and you might be recommended hormone replacement therapy, but it's a personal choice. I'm 28 so I've got a while before I consider if HRT is right for me.

* **Does it effect my mood?**

Because I still have my ovaries, no, it doesn't hormonally or chemically *change* my moods to have had my uterus removed, but obviously my ovaries themselves have a huge impact on my moods. 

My ovaries don't know I'm missing my uterus, so they're still doing their job of releasing an egg each month, they raise my estrogen, then raise my progesterone, then lower both, just like they've always done since puberty.

So I still have follicular, ovulation and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle, and hormonally I still have a menstrual phase, I just don't bleed. So I'll still get irritable and a little bit blue when my hormones are in ""period"" mode, but not having to deal with cramps, bleeding, anaemic fatigue etc means I'm not *as* irritable person sad as I used to be.

If you have your ovaries removed, your moods would be effected, and you'd experience all the usual symptoms that come with menopause. 

(having your ovaries removed is called an oophorectomy. Having your ovaries and uterus removed is sometimes called an oophohysterectomy)

The hysterectomy technically has effected my mood in that it was the right choice for me. I feel more myself. I have more confidence, I'm less anxious, I've lost weight I needed to lose because I have more love for my body. It turns out I had some mild body dysphoria/identity issues around having a uterus, and now that it's gone there's this weight off my shoulders because my body is the way it's supposed to be now."

Or, [tw:graphic] there is just enough oxygen to start the regular decomposition process, but not enough to complete the process, and the bacteria that feeds on the body to break it down die from lack of oxygen, and anaerobic bacteria take over, creating a toxic sludge. In most cases these bacteria produce gases that cause the seal of the casket to break, and decomposition eventually resumes, however the parts of the body that broke down before oxygen was reintroduced won't become healthy compost, it will remain sludge.

TrollXChromosomes,fcn9dao,t1_fcn7vl3,1577806614.0,"This is actually why I opted for a hysterectomy over a tubal.

I knew I wanted sterilisation, so when discussing my options with my GYN I explained that if I had a tubal then I'd be permanently sterile but I'd still have to deal with periods - and my periods brought a lot of dysfunction into my life due to pain, PMS, dysphoria etc.

So I explained that I'd prefer a hysterectomy as a method for sterilisation. I was fully aware it was a more complex surgery, but if I'm going to remove my ability to reproduce it might as well also remove my ability to menstruate.

After going into more detail about the specific reasons I wanted sterilisation (I have a genetic disorder that I don't want to pass on, and it would make pregnancy high risk anyway, and drastically impact my health even in the early stages of a pregnancy) then I went into detail on the history of my difficult periods.

Ultimately my GYN agreed that my reasoning for a sterilisation was sound, and he was happy to perform a tubal, and he agreed that my reasoning for wanting a hysterectomy over a tubal was also sound, and I was medically fit for that procedure, so he brought me a consent form to sign and that was that.

I'd been knocked back by a lot of GYNs before, so it does depend on the surgeon. 

Best decision of my life. I can't even begin to express how not having periods has improved my mental, physical, social, occupational and financial health.

I still have my ovaries, so I still get some PMS symptoms, but it's nothing compared to what it used to be.

Depending on your age and personal situation, I'd recommend looking into procedures like ablation or even hysterectomy. If you're already sterilised the only real reason a doctor should turn you down is if it's a large health risk to you personally to undergo the procedure.

You can also still take certain types of birth control after a tubal if you find hormonal contraception helps you manage your periods or PMS."

I strongly believe this will be your experience.

You say ""I gained 7+ lbs in one week. Unfortunately, I feel this is mathematically possible"", so let's look at the maths.

I don't know your height, weight, or activity level, but let's assume you're a 5ft 115lbs, very sedentary, post menopausal woman, putting your TDEE at around 1300cal a week.

To gain 7lbs of fat, you would need to eat 33,600 calories in this week. Or an average of 4,800 calories a day.

Now is ~5000 calories a day possible? Yes, I guess, but only you can know if this is likely what you ate. And of course, If you are taller, heavier, younger or more active than this hypothetical woman I've used in my example, you will need to have consumed even *more* calories than this to gain 7lbs of fat.

It's very likely you've gained 2-3-4lbs, and because of the sudden changes in diet, you've also retained a lot of water, adding up to 7lbs total. Given where you are in your menstrual cycle, water retention is common and likely to be more than usual. Stress from the holidays and high sodium holiday foods also increases water retention.

Can you come back from this? Of course you can! You know deep down that any weight gained can be lost. But I understand that emotionally this is very difficult to feel as an inherent truth.

But you can only take eating better one day at a time, one food choice at a time. It sounds like you're already back on track with buying healthy foods, so you've got this.

I'm recently back on the wagon after giving up mid last year. I gained back 15kg of what is definitely actual fat, but since Christmas I'm already seeing my weight trend down, I've just got to remember that even though my goal feels ages away, it's achievable and I'll get there if I stay focused and even if I have a cheat day, remember to stay holding onto the wagon instead of falling off completely."
