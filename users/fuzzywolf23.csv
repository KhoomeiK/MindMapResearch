explainlikeimfive,ff85a1z,t1_ff82qxw,1579666370.0,"That is not a good example.  By the 1600s, we had tons of astronomical data that could only be organized into a cohesive understanding if we adopted a more fundamental view of the solar system.  

There are two options when it comes to physics fundamentals.  Either there's an infinite regression of ""why is it like that?"" layers or there isn't.  If there's not, eventually we'll reach the bottom, and the answer to ""why?"" will be ""because that's just how the universe is"".  If there is, then we will never know the most fundamental thing, and we will have to make peace with that.  Both options are unsatisfying philosophically.

On the bright side, there's no shortage of predictions to make and phenomenon to explain at our current level of understanding!"
explainlikeimfive,ff7v3p4,t1_ff7nd2j,1579659070.0,"No, this is incorrect.  Particles emerge matgematically when you take averages of wavefunctions.  Particle like behavior is a subset of the wavefunction description."
explainlikeimfive,ff7ukdh,t1_ff7f2yl,1579658713.0,"The only real argument against the wavefunction model, at this point in time, is that humans don't find it philosophically satisfying.  String theorists have spent 50 years trying to find something testable that hints at physics beyond wavefunctions, but have found nothing"
explainlikeimfive,ff7u86p,t1_ff7jfr5,1579658483.0,"I'm going to give you an honest answer, but you're going to find it unsatisfactory.

In my opinion, the question of interpretation is unanswered and unimportant.  The wavefunction beats the particle in a clash of explanations, but they are both mathematical models which describe a thing, not the thing itself.  The wavefunction does a better job describing because that's what it was designed to do.  

It may or may not be the fundamental description of the universe, but if I had to guess, I'd say not.  However, until we have some experiment that can't be explained by wavefunction, there is no way to know what that more fundamental thing might be, and no reason to describe it.  

On top of that, wavefunctions are so complex that we can't solve for them exactly except for a handful of toy examples.  Everything else must be approximated via computer, and those calculations get expensive very fast.  For my dissertation, I did multiple calculations that took a month of processing time on 8 core servers.  A more productive use of our time, in my opinion, is refining the approximations we make so that the calculations we can do are more accurate."
explainlikeimfive,ff7ac92,t1_ff79sye,1579644524.0,"No.  There is a difference between a classical wave and a quantum mechanical wave*function*.  The first cannot adequately describe the photoelectric effect, but the second definitely can.  A classical wave is an approximation (of bulk particle movements) of an approximation (particles are actually wavefunctions)."

His basic thesis is that a fascist group is primarily concerned with the purity of its in group and how that in group deserves power.  Empowerment of the in group is morally right and empowerment of any other group is indicative of moral decay.

As a fascist group gains power, they will trim away who is considered a member, focusing on being more ""pure"" to whatever arbitrary trait makes them deserving.  When the group is in decline, they will expand their definition of who is ""in"" to attract new members and increase the group's power."
