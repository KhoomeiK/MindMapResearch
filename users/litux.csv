Cultures should merge and become one too. At one point or another it will have to be this, peacefully or by force it needed.

Now I honestly don't know whether you are arguing your real opinion or whether you are being sarcastic. 

Are you suggesting that we should just pick a language (which one? English? Russian? German? French?) and force 600 million people to switch to it? And abandon their first languages, their rich cultural heritage? Reduce their mother tongues to a hobby or a linguistic curiosity?

Are you suggesting that Italian poems, Czech drama plays, Bulgarian fairy tales and Finnish folk songs should become niche material for a small amount of enthusiasts?"
europe,ff5upjk,t1_ff5s7vi,1579610902.0,">An European continent with one official money, one official language and a common set of laws should be the goal of everyone. 

Why? 

Why do we need the same set of laws for Spaniards and Swedes? Their cultures have a lot in common, but also a lot of differences.

Why do we need the same currency for Germans and Greeks? Each nation obviously has a different approach to economical issues, and having common currency means that one nation's approach now seriously interferes with the other one's approach. 

And why should most Europeans suddenly have to use an official language that is not their first language? What kind of a tyrannical dystopia would that be? I'm all for learning new languages, but you shouldn't need a foreign language to talk to your own government."
