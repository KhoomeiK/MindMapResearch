Tbh, I've never had any romantic relationship either, and I am quite conflicted on that with myself, but there was once a guy whom I've met on a archeological digging place and became sort of  chatting buddies. 
Months later he asked me out but I rejected him since I just didnt see him like that ((note that we had a 10year gap.. )) 

But my commitment problems aside,, I would have never guessed that my very first time to get confessed to would happen because of me doing volunteer work outside of school.

I can only support you to never give up. Maybe you should try finding a community to hang out with (and also one that is within your boundaries ofc) I mean, not bars and the like, but a curriculum of your hobby  or something maybe :)"

aww,feaiay0,t1_feady5p,1578949125.0,"My art teacher once showed us a few minutes documentary like this. It showed a girl being adopted into a family, and celebrating the birthday party of her now adopted sister, then as time went by the family started to ignore her and eventually abandoned her in the middle of nowhere. Only then did she turn out to be a dog.

It was years ago but I still remember it and embrace the lessons that it tought me. It's really sad how people get pets as gifts then the next moment they take them back to the shelter if not something worse..

MapPorn,fd11ylm,t1_fcyuavn,1578126671.0,"I dont think it is necessarily directed at Scottish people, more like it started out as one person just randomly picking a nationality, and it just stuck. Like how ''dumb blondie jokes'' are not true to most of the blond girls around the world, but just rather stuck as a 'genre'.
I mean, the blonde jokes are essentially making fun of dumb people and the physical aspect of it is just unfortunate. With our scottish jokes, it's the same. We make fun of ''chinzy'' people, and the nationality was just a stereotype at the time this ''genre'' was born. I hope it made some sense?"
