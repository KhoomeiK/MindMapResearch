aquarium,feiwhx1,t3_epe7hq,1579149121.0,"You can check the classifieds, there's usually lots of cheap used lights around. Look for one that has blue LEDs as well as white.

Amazon also sells lots of cheap full spectrum LEDs that should do the trick."
Cichlid,feirh1w,t3_epailz,1579145352.0,"Lots of clean buckets and some fish bags! You'll want to do it as quickly as possible so this is what I would do:

1) Rinse the new substrate and set aside

2) Remove the rocks and clean them. I find the easiest way is to fill the sink, add a bit of bleach, and use a scrub pad. Rinse each rock thoroughly and set aside. Then drain the sink and refill with clean water and add some dechlorinator and put each rock in for a soak (I only do about 20 seconds per rock and it's been fine). Drain the sink and set the rocks aside.

3) Unplug your filters and heater. Do not clean the filter as you'll want the bacteria to keep a cycled tank.

4) Drain about 80% of your tank and use the tank water to fill as many buckets as you need for your fish. Get rid of the rest of the water (the good bacteria is in your filter, not your water). 

5) Catch the fish, put them in the buckets. If you have an air stone it would be great to put it in.

6) Drain the rest of the water and get a dustpan and use that to remove the old substrate. Since you likely have about 130 pounds of substrate make sure you get heavy duty construction garbage bags and don't overfill them. You can use a shop vac to get rid of the water and the bit of substrate you can't get otherwise.

7) If the glass needs cleaned from algae use a scrubber or razer and do it now. If you have hard water stains use half water, half vinegar in a bottle and scrub. Rinse.

8) Add the new rocks and substrate back in.

9) Refill the tank and get it as close to your fish bucket temperature as possible. Add dechlorinator.

10) Turn your filter and heater back on

11) Bag your fish and make sure there's lots of air in the bags (most fish stores will give you some bags for free). Float your fish for 20 mins to equalize the temperature and release!"

PlantedTank,fe07h64,t3_enib1s,1578805090.0,Shrimp molt and it often looks like they're dead when it's just their old shells. Maybe that's what happened?
Aquariums,fe07ead,t1_fdzxepp,1578805024.0,"Love the arch and the general grouping you've done! 

What kind of man made rock did you use? It's it lighter/cheaper than natural rock?"
todayilearned,fe06jg6,t1_fdx0iuf,1578804328.0,"Thanks, that's a great idea!"
todayilearned,fe06g2d,t1_fdxk0c5,1578804256.0,"All babies are different, my daughter crawled at 7.5 months and is cruising. She's also pushing a walker around. She can easily move a blanket if it ever happened to cover her face. Our mattress is also on the floor so she can't fall off.

I did a lot of research before co sleeping and I'm satisfied it's safe. The highest risk is for smokers, drinkers, and people taking heavy medication, which doesn't apply to us. She also sleeps with an Owl sock on that monitors her heart and breathing.

Co sleeping is the norm in most non Western countries and they have lower rates of SIDS in most cases."
Aquariums,fdzco79,t3_enbywh,1578788981.0,Male guppies or pea puffers are nice!
todayilearned,fdw9hjo,t1_fdw4ofv,1578756427.0,"For me it's mostly that you don't get a break... I'm pumping and feeding my 8 month old directly and on the nights / mornings where she is sleeping I'm still up because I have to pump. It's gotten better since the 6 month mark when she started eating ""real"" food but it's still a lot of work to pump. And for most pumps you need to use 2 hands so you're just sitting there for 20 minutes doing nothing."
todayilearned,fdw8lxv,t1_fdvz2o2,1578756205.0,"It gets easier as the baby gets bigger. Mine is 8 months old and she sleeps in bed with us and in the middle of the night she essentially feeds herself - I wake up a little but for the most part she puts it in her mouth herself! Sometimes if I'm facing the wrong way she'll tap me until I roll over, lol"
Aquariums,fdt3mgt,t3_en105p,1578711481.0,Love it! How do you find stacking the river stone?
Cichlid,fdkoysq,t3_elv78m,1578508129.0,What about electric blue jack dempseys?
AfricanCichlids,fdko31u,t3_eltl1g,1578507598.0,The one in the back looks like P. socolofi to me.
woodstockontario,fdkn9xw,t1_fc5qkd4,1578507111.0,"Second that, it's a great place! The only problem is it's an hour long wait for take out most nights and to sit you need to make reservations."
theLword,fdkm1jy,t1_fdken73,1578506351.0,Good points!
PlantedTank,fdiqmzm,t3_eli7sg,1578448857.0,Love the way the flat river stones look with the rest of your set up!
theLword,fdiop56,t3_elfdq7,1578447615.0,"I agree with the mouth open/chewing/slack jaw stuff... It annoyed me even from the opening trailers before episode 1. I don't know why her mouth is always hanging open and she doesn't enunciate her words.

Is she supposed to be like the new Jenny? A character that's meant to be annoying?

Saying that though the last episode I started to care about the character a little more. Still my least favourite of the new cast (Micah is only slightly above) but she's slowly growing on me."
AfricanCichlids,fdio5e3,t1_fdh1s2c,1578447264.0,"When you add more fish it can help a lot to take all your stones out first and rearrange them so everyone needs to establish a new territory at once, instead of the new ones having nowhere unclaimed to go. You could easily add 10 fish if your filtration is sufficient."
theLword,fdcv9xx,t1_fdb4ltc,1578285310.0,"Molly and Shane are my favs too! Molly was the only character who seemed to ""get"" Shane."
theLword,fdcuyoq,t3_ekdup5,1578285054.0,"Favourites: Bette, Kit, and Molly. I wish Molly and Shane worked out. I also enjoyed Joyce and Phyllis as characters.

Least: Jodi. I just found her character kind of boring.

I didn't mind Tina... I think she's one of the more realistic characters, at least until she suddenly has a career in film it of nowhere. But her reactions to the drama in the series seemed pretty believable to me."
Aquariums,fdcoic2,t3_eklfqd,1578280044.0,Looks great! Post an update in a month or so!
Cichlid,fdcmbby,t1_fdc9izc,1578278456.0,Thanks! I used to have demasoni but it's been 15 or so years since and I want to make sure I'm up to speed on everything as I get ready for my new tank!
Cichlid,fdc0zjd,t1_fd4xudx,1578265000.0,"They have a great selection, thanks!"
Cichlid,fdc0p9h,t1_fd0jukc,1578264859.0,Thanks! I'll have to look into the process for potentially bringing them across the border!

Cichlid,fdc09xz,t1_fd0dq1q,1578264633.0,Do you have a preference between demasoni or saulosi?
aquarium,fdbzmwq,t3_ekgu2s,1578264369.0,"It's a bit hard to tell from the picture but it may be a lack of light. With the tall tanks the amount of light that reaches the substrate is reduced. The plants you have don't have high light requirements but it may be that not enough is reaching them. To test it out you could put them closer to the light in a breeder box or something since they aren't rooted plants and see if that helps. Once your algae issue is resolved you can try keeping the lights on longer too.

You can usually pick up decent led lights used :)"
Aquariums,fczecm0,t1_fcyz4hi,1578099283.0,You can still try GBRs! My water is naturally hard and my rams are breeding and have great colour.
Aquariums,fcxd50y,t3_ejdlrq,1578059708.0,Looks great!
Cichlid,fcmbgut,t3_ehy5ai,1577769564.0,"I haven't used the Nicrew ones but have a similar Amazon one called Pawfly that seems to be unavailable now. It was about $40 for an 18"" light. It's been 2 years and it's worked well, I have it on a 20g high tank with anubias and some  rotala colorata. I do 25% water changes every week and add some Excel when I remember but otherwise the plants get no attention from me. They're growing well and the rotala reaches the top of the tank and needs cut back often enough, so I think the cheap lights are fine!

I'm setting up a 90g mbuna tank and am planning on a Nicrew light - for the price it can't be beat, and with the plants you're thinking of it should be more than enough!"
Aquariums,fcma7hz,t3_ehwu2y,1577768470.0,"I think a solid black background would really make the contrast with the white sand pop, and maybe a gourami as a feature fish would look great!"
Cichlid,fc7m9mx,t1_fc2una9,1577512081.0,"Thanks so much! I'm setting up another tank and am near Woodstock, I was planning on driving to Finatics in Mississauga and didn't know this guy existed!"
aquarium,fauquq9,t3_eamd1f,1576351490.0,"Poor guy.... You can try doing a large water change, then lower the temperature a few degrees F and adding freshwater aquarium salt. I've had good luck with paraguard. Make sure to take your carbon out of your filter if you add medicine."
