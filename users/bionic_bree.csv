TrueCrimeDiscussion,ff3raf3,t3_erdx2j,1579547151.0,Golden State. Sorry y'all.

aww,fdfnu3d,t1_fdfb0wq,1578366003.0,Don't forget about 100+ degree weather in places like Texas that actually kills the elderly in their homes who can't afford air conditioning. What's the point of having a dog if you're only going to leave it outside? Not the best pet-ownership situation in the slightest.
Justfuckmyshitup,fdfn5o2,t3_el39ms,1578365557.0,The attention paid to those eyebrows tho...
myfavoritemurder,fdfkelh,t1_fdeofag,1578363757.0,"If you click on the black box that says ""Weatherforddemocrat.com"" it will take you to the story.

Thankfully no one was home at the time. Keyes said it was basically a hoarder house and looked like nobody had been home for at least a few weeks. I was 31 at the time and thinking I could have had a run-in with him is so scary!"
oddlysatisfying,fdffd79,t3_ekyy8o,1578360395.0,That's one hell of a golf swing.
bipolar,fdehf49,t3_ekvjlq,1578339082.0,This made me tear up. What a sweetheart.
SweatyPalms,fczl33z,t3_ejfk2t,1578103585.0,This documentary taught me so much about cave diving. https://youtu.be/IvNWboZ96YY
myfavoritemurder,fczb3na,t3_ej4pmr,1578097339.0,"So yeah... I was listening to this great podcast True Crime Bullshit: The story of Israel Keyes, and during one of his interviews he talks about setting a fire in a small town south of Dallas. In February 2012. Then the podcaster said the name of the town was Aledo, which sure enough is where I was at that time. This house is literally five houses down from mine. It totally trips me out that this vicious killer came so close to my home."

BipolarReddit,fbwqtyh,t1_fbwqoil,1577157000.0,Aw... thank you for posting. I grew up with a severely bipolar mother and was diagnosed myself four years ago at age 34 (ugh) so I have a lot of experience with both trauma and the disease. I'm here anytime you want to talk/vent/cry whatever.
BipolarReddit,fbwqkp2,t1_fbwpmga,1577156807.0,I take Klonopin for panic attacks. It's very mild (won't fuck you up) but effective for calming me down. I really hope you have a great therapist who will go slow with you and let you work through things as you can. It can be hard to find a good one.
AskReddit,fbwol2v,t1_fbw4ig3,1577155322.0,I lol'd.
BipolarReddit,fbwoc9f,t3_eeusef,1577155147.0,"Also, happy cake day!"
BipolarReddit,fbwoayz,t3_eeusef,1577155122.0,"Good job! That's a really good sign that you might be coming out of your depression. Self care is soooo hard when you can't get out of bed. I tend to self-medicate with alcohol too, so I feel you fam. Don't give up. It will eventually get better. Are you taking your meds?"
