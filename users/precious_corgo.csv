beauty,fdr9j19,t3_emsj4d,1578681366.0,I bought a bidet toilet seat for my BF and I for Christmas and it is amazing! We've wanted one for years and we're travelling to Japan later in the year so I thought we'd better get used to it now. Highly recommend!
beauty,fdr991j,t1_fdqv3ma,1578681200.0,"While some use cold water, you can buy ones that heat the water."
cricut,fdpms7l,t3_emksth,1578633080.0,"I love the colours you chose! I made my first flowers the other night; I found them so fun and addictive I ended up making 22 in various shapes, colours, and sizes!"
cricut,fdhnevp,t1_fdgos5b,1578426337.0,So far I've just been using the butcher paper sheets that came with the Infusible Ink transfer sheets. I haven't been able to find any locally and the options on Amazon (.ca) are way too expensive. I plan on doing some testing to find a more affordable option.

blackcats,fdd56qs,t3_eknfuu,1578295290.0,Congratulations!! She’s so adorable! I especially love when kitties jump up into pets!  ❤️
MakeupAddictionCanada,fdd1x1p,t1_fdd07n3,1578291527.0,I'm using tretinoin now and I can't imagine using a Clarisonic on my skin now! I can however use a Foreo daily without any irritation.
cricut,fdcwsq0,t1_fdcwosq,1578286607.0,You have great taste!! 😁
MakeupAddictionCanada,fdcwi4y,t1_fdcwe9e,1578286353.0,"You're welcome! I definitely fell for the hype, plus I'm totally addicted to buying gadgets!"
MakeupAddictionCanada,fdcwahu,t1_fdcw0rc,1578286169.0,"I don't use it at all anymore, it was just too irritating. I'd say it wasn't worth the investment."
MakeupAddictionCanada,fdcvq2h,t3_ekov1r,1578285685.0,"I have rosacea, sensitive skin with hormonal breakouts and I found the Clarisonic with a sensitive brush head too rough on my skin to use daily. Plus I hated having to buy new brush heads!"
cricut,fdca1yc,t1_fdc9mjj,1578270080.0,"Thank you so much! Aww I love German Shepherds; my grandparents had one when I was growing up so they hold a very special place in my heart <3 

He definitely gets called Morgie, Morgie Corgi, Morgan Corgan, and many other variations! =D"
cricut,fdc7w4y,t1_fdc17cj,1578268832.0,"Thank you so much; that's incredibly kind of you! =) It's not something I'd ever thought of before, but if I decide to I'll let you know!"
beauty,fd5p5xn,t1_fd5o61h,1578179899.0,"Fortunately for me, in Canada, the base and top coats are on sale at $8 from $20, but it looks like they're not on the US site."
beauty,fd5m1v0,t1_fd5jjor,1578178929.0,"I just had gel polish on my natural nails, a glittery red with silver holo candy cane stripes. It was so sparkly and shiny and easily lasted 3 weeks without chipping or separating from my nails at the tips. It soaked off easily  without destroying my nails. I love the colours I ordered, they're so much prettier in person than how they looked online."
beauty,fd5iui1,t3_ek1zhv,1578178059.0,I ordered some Bio Seaweed Gel after having my nails done at a salon with it and I'm super happy!
cricut,fd0al5i,t3_ejljoo,1578116087.0,"It's beautiful!
