I doubt there are many Brits like me on this sub, but my dad was a financial advisor and he definitely did need qualifications up to degree level as well as being directly regulated by the financial conduct authority."
AskUK,fe99gig,t1_fe7nbsh,1578935539.0,"I watched Stewart Francis live and it wasn’t hilarious, but I had a constant smile throughout. I watched Bill Bailey and Tim Minchin recently and they were able to keep the audience laughing throughout, Bill Bailey in particular did nearly 40 minutes just working off the audience and it was really really impressive watching him work."

todayilearned,fdrjqoe,t1_fdrjl6e,1578685509.0,"Working in First there’s a maximum of 4 passengers per crew member, had this gentleman been sat in economy where there’s 50 per crew member, I probably wouldn’t have made the small talk that made me aware he was a cardiologist."
todayilearned,fdr8btg,t1_fdr7tpx,1578680887.0,Yes
todayilearned,fdr2qwa,t1_fdr2e8u,1578678754.0,Yeah you’re right. We can call MedAire whenever we need support in anything medical related. I’ve seen them be used simply because we wanted to give a child some anti-vomit medication but the packaging said we couldn’t use it on a child that young. We called them to double check it would be safe to do so as well as give them the legal responsibility of making that decision.
todayilearned,fdr1oo5,t1_fdr1h42,1578678329.0,Yes
todayilearned,fdr1gby,t1_fdr0vvt,1578678224.0,"We have a medical kit full of medication we can use on the direction of a doctor we contact issuing a satellite phone (we use MedAire in Phoenix) as well as the doctors kit. We are fully trained in CPR, airway clearing and defibrillator use as well - we don’t need clearance to use this. Just from a legal standpoint only crew or doctors can use medication apart from a couple of exceptions like Eli-pens and ventolin inhalers."
todayilearned,fdr0122,t1_fdqzpgd,1578677707.0,"There’s a lot of factors we have to take into account. Someone could be complaining of heart issues and just be having indigestion for example. We have a very strict process to go through where we call a doctor on the ground (MedAire based in Phoenix) and they make a decision for us based on the care we’re able to get on board, and what the options are on the ground for us. If a man is having a suspected heart attack, would it be safer to have him treated on board with the help of a doctor, or divert immediately into South Sudan with a medical shack? A lot of long haul flights fly over extremely remote and sometimes dangerous countries, there’s a lot of factors to weigh in and diversions are carefully thought about with the safety of all passengers on board."
todayilearned,fdqz68p,t1_fdqybq9,1578677195.0,"Actually, the medical kit we carry on board has a section of controlled substances, drugs and equipment that only medical doctors and paramedics are allowed to use and administer. They’re there specifically for when a doctor or similar is able to assist in a medical emergency. We can’t use them as crew."
todayilearned,fdqw6zr,t1_fdqvbj6,1578675673.0,"I’m not too sure if they do, but as the crew onboard we gave him 3 bottles of $100 a bottle champagne to take off with him."
todayilearned,fdqru5o,t1_fdqgrxh,1578673523.0,"I mean in theory they could’ve performed the surgery there, but they would’ve had to carry her up a 1 person wide ladder to get there."
todayilearned,fdqrpe0,t1_fdqlhg0,1578673443.0,"I’m a flight attendant and actually had a very similar event. Flying home from Chicago I was working in the First Class cabin, noticing a customer had Prof. as his title I struck up some light conversation with him and discovered he was a Professor of Cardiology travelling home from a conference. 

Later on in the flight we had a customer in the economy cabins who was quite evidently having some heart issues, there was a medical student on the aircraft but couldn’t offer too much help as they didn’t fall under the medical professional criteria we require for them to be able to access the medical kit that we keep on board for medical professional use only. 

Having spoken to our customer in First Class I was able to very discreetly ask him for assistance and he immediately went down and I can honestly say I’ve never seen someone handle a medical emergency with such clarity, coolness and certainty. The gentleman was determined to be suffering from a heart attack and we diverted into St John’s to have him seen to on the ground. Without this persons assistance things may have been a lot worse."

AskReddit,fci4ida,t3_eh6tfh,1577657693.0,"I don’t work in a famous or historical building, but as a flight attendant I get to see the bunks above the cabin that we sleep in (occasionally they’re below). Also I have access to the flightdeck during flight."
Cooking,fc6ol7h,t3_egdr2u,1577485557.0,My mum made a cranberry sauce so sour that it made my aunt vomit. She also royally messed up the timings but luckily my uncle is a chef and was able to fix most things.
flightattendants,fc2g2sc,t1_fc27o9w,1577358219.0,"At my airline the trips are not seniority based. We have a bidding system and we have up to 200 bids to put on trips or days off we want. Everyone has the same priority. You can put 200 bids on one specific city or you can put 200 separate bids on 200 separate trips. If you want a popular destination, you would have to place a lot of bids on that destination to give you more chance of getting it."
Southampton,fbr3234,t3_ee6kt1,1577038557.0,I live near Romsey and commute to London. 1hr 15mins in each direction. Moving to Alton next month and cutting it down to 45 minutes.
