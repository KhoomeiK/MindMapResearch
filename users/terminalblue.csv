But thats also the nature of being a private contractor like many models ini any industry are.  but the fact that they let crucial identity documents get out is disturbing and honestly mortifying and for some some of these girls I fear for their personal safety.

Edit - I am probably crazy, as i was sure that there was a dual screen version of it, but as more people talk about it i don't think there was.  maybe it was being ten years old when it was new.

movies,fdxhjgk,t1_fdsja6k,1578768781.0,"you know, if they had just made one movie, cut out most of the zion stuff, made the ending a little less hokey, trimmed down some of the stuff inside of the matrix they would have been at least okay.   Really the zion stuff just had no real value and slowed the story WAY too much.  I feel like if they had introduced zion when the Mjolnir crashed in the hanger bay, gave us a few establishing shots of the city MAYBE a few character moments, and left out all the councils, orgies, people worshipping neo, The pointless battles, and made zion look like a city of defenseless refugees instead dirty rave the movies would have been MUCH MUCH better.

Here is the thing, the matrix movies bullshit philosophy works great in the ""matrix"" itself, but none of that really works ""in the real world"".   And introducing Zion the way they did made everyone look ridiculous .  I was fine with all the speeches, I am even the guy that LIKED the the architects long winded narrative dump.  But the complete disconnect between the two worlds was just jarring and off putting.   

It makes me wonder if there is a fan edit that just scraps all the zion bullshit and makes one decent 3 hour movie."
