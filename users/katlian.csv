One type of botany career is with one of the land management agencies like Bureau of Land Management or US Forest Service or a state agency such as state parks or forestry.

Sometimes it also includes creating and implementing conservation projects for those species such as habitat improvements or seed banking. I was this kind of botanist for a while but I got tired of writing documents all day and never going outside.

You can also get jobs doing field surveys for plants, usually rare plants. I did this during summers in college. It doesn't pay much but you get to be outside a lot.

bitters,fc6t85o,t3_eb3ras,1577488887.0,"I'd just like to point out that the bitter alkaloids in gentian, angelica, and horehound are all water soluble so spending the extra money on high proof spirits for steeping really doesn't gain anything and may in fact reduce the amount dissolved.

Wormwood's components are a mix of water soluble alkaloids and oil (or ethanol) soluble terpenes. ABV will alter the ratio between these two groups for different flavor profiles. If you steep the wormwood in 65 or more ABV, expect a fair amount of louche when diluting it with other ingredients later.

Steeping time is affected more by the physical structure of your ingredients. Bigger pieces = longer steeping time. Not as much of a problem for wormwood and horehound but angelica and gentian can range from tiny 2 mm diameter sticks up to 10 mm chunks. Smaller chunks and more surface area will give you a faster steep.

Edit, sorry had proof number instead of ABV."

I set up Shipping Profiles and labeled them as:  Free Domestic Shipping (3 pounds, $10),  Free Domestic Shipping (6 pounds, $15), etc so that I know how much postage cost to add to a listing's price based on its weight. My US postage prices are based on actual average postage for that weight class over the previous year. We're on the west coast and tend to get a lot of orders going to the east coast so it's a bit higher than just the average for that weight class across all zones.

This works for us because most people buy one item from our shop but if you frequently ship bundles of many items, you might need to calculate differently.

We had to go stand outside with him and then he would go. Maybe if your dog is used to only going outside with you, on a leash, going outside by herself is kind of scary."
AskReddit,fc3fova,t1_fc2rv2t,1577388774.0,"Yes, a constant diet of restaurant food sucks. I usually travel by car and take my own food but recently had to fly with a group for a 3 day meeting in Vegas. Everyone wanted to go out for pizza, burgers, fast food, etc. I ate so much salt that I swear I gained 4 pounds of retained water. I felt like crap and it took a few days of regular food to get back to normal and I'm not even on a special diet. It must be really hard for people with kidney problems to eat while travelling."

One would eat so fast she would immediately throw it all up so we had to feed her 1 tiny spoonful at a time. Food puzzles helped both of them by spreading out their meal and giving them something to do besides sit around and beg for food."

The pdf is hosted on our own site so I hope that draws some customers there for future purchases. It's pretty easy to set up downloads that require a password so then you just send them the password in an email after purchase or put it on the physical receipt.
Catahoula,fbzlitp,t3_ee6pvy,1577250776.0,My mother-in-law's lab liked to disembowel toys so I bought here one of these [balls with holes](https://www.amazon.com/JW-Hol-ee-Roller-Size-Assorted/dp/B00X1TMDAC) and stuffed it with strips from an old t-shirt and some fleece scraps. She had a blast pulling all of the cloth bits out and they were easy to stuff back inside for another round (and easier to clean up than bits of stuffing.) You could even stuff it with the pieces of torn up toys.

Do you ever look at photos of a dog that looks a lot like yours but has the blue and brown eyes switched? It's so weird.   [https://i.postimg.cc/65z5YQrn/IMK35103.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/65z5YQrn/IMK35103.jpg)"

TwoXChromosomes,fbz34p7,t3_ef8fzy,1577233647.0,"Read a little ""Dear Prudence."" Learn to say ""Sorry, I'm not going to be available for that."" No explanations or excuses, just not going to do it. The more times you say it for shit you don't want to do, the less people will ask.

I have family with weird allergies and a boss who is vegan, trust me, there are plenty of things you can buy that will meet their dietary needs. Most local bakeries have at least a few things that are nut/soy/wheat/dairy/egg/pumpkin/potato/whatever-free. A store bought cake isn't going to ruin Christmas. If that fails, take a box of oranges and apples, they probably don't need more cake anyway.

The ""You're Ruining Christmas"" guilt trip is a load of crap anyway. As long as no one ends up in the hospital and you don't have to call the fire department, Christmas is fine. Christmas will happen again next year and if someone wants something done differently, they're welcome to do it themselves.

Sit back with a good book and a cup of cocoa and don't worry about making everyone else happy."

Two arrived the next day, the third took a detour through Phoenix and was only delivered today. had I known it would take so long I would have just driven it over there myself.

But USPS isn't the only ones. We ordered supplies from California the shipped on UPS. One box arrived the next day, the other box went to Illinois first and took 9 days to reach us. Of course the items we really needed ASAP were in the second box."
