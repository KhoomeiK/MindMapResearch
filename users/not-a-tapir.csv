beyondthebump,ffbnz7m,t3_eskjum,1579774972.0,"Mine right now would be a dragon and dad. Pretty sure my son calls me dad because he thinks it's funny. My husband bathes him then stands at the top of the stairs calling 'Muuum' and as soon as he sees me, my son grins and announces 'Dad!' He calls apples 'mama', too, which is fair, I eat a lot of apples."

So many moments where I wondered if the advice was right, if I was just making him clingy and reliant. Nope, he trusts me to be there when he needs me and that gives him the confidence to be away from me. Definitely doesn't last forever!"

books,ff365fp,t3_ercxjc,1579534607.0,"I don't find them so terrible I wouldn't read them to my children, but I wouldn't read them again for myself. The pacing is pretty bad, in my opinion, for most of the books. They're very short children's books, so events move at pretty break-neck speed. There's not a lot of time for any of the characters to have a personality, so they mostly don't. They are also very dated in a lot of ways. It's definitely not a comparable experience to reading Harry Potter, The Moomins, Redwall or even shorter series I enjoyed as a child like The Talking Head. All of those were still thoroughly enjoyable as an adult (The Moomins books are pretty weird, but still enjoyable). As a child, I listened to the Sir Michael Hordern audiobooks and I think that's largely why I loved the series. I would recommend them still.

I honestly don't care about the allegory, it's really not that obvious unless you're really trying to be aware of it."
LoveIslandTV,ff30gvn,t1_ff2zt1i,1579530353.0,"We don't know that she would have done that. Look, I don't like her, but let's not wilfully misinterpret what she said just because we don't like her. She said she was looking for her Aladdin before the show and said Nas looked like him during. It's a bit misguided, maybe, but people need to chill out."
LoveIslandTV,ff2wxct,t1_ff2w6tu,1579527204.0,"Regardless, the context is that she called Nas Aladdin which to her was a compliment.

I don't think I'd want to risk making a call on her ethnicity. I'm of Southeast Asian descent, grandparents on both sides, but most people assume I'm white because of recessive genes. People usually don't assume I'm related to my family, either, but I'm just as Vietnamese as my sisters who look more Vietnamese. I probably call attention to my ethnicity more than I should because I wish it was more visible and I don't know for certain she's not doing that."
LoveIslandTV,ff2wijf,t3_er2ygu,1579526798.0,"I don't really dislike her that much, she's not as annoying as some islanders in past seasons. I can't get over her aggressive interview style of getting to know guys, though, it's a bit horrifying to watch."

LoveIslandTV,ff2u7c3,t3_er3lk8,1579524334.0,"He's not even that short. The national average height for women is just under 5'5"", Nas is likely still taller than most of the girls, but they're all in heels."
LoveIslandTV,ff2u45t,t1_ff0yq0f,1579524237.0,"Lack of game wouldn't have resulted in nobody being at all interested him from the first day. There may be an element of racial preference, and there may now be an element of him lacking game, but from the first day, Siânnise said he was too short. She didn't say he was ugly, she actually compared him to Aladdin, which she said before the show was what she was looking for, but then she said he was too short. It's just a bit awful to me that height is considered so important, an average height woman in 6"" heels is going to be about 6' tall when the national average height for men is 5'9"". Actually, people were calling Anton short at 5'9"" because of one shot where he was walking with, who is also 5'9"" but she was wearing heels. Maybe I have some sort of short girl privilege because I'm 5' nothing, but I just don't think height is that important, particularly if you're wearing heels all day."
AskReddit,fev23z6,t3_eqies2,1579392201.0,"When I was a kid, we lived in a manor house that had been repurposed as an office building then split into flats, so there was a huge heavy fire door leading into the sort of entrance area where our neighbours had their living room. My mum and step-dad would go watch movies with them sometimes after all the kids were asleep. My room was directly opposite the fire door at the end of a long corridor.

I was up reading after I was meant to be in bed. I heard the fire door open so dived under the covers and turned my lamp off, knowing my mum usually checked on us. I heard footsteps down the hall and then my door handle pulled down and the door opened. I stayed under the covers. The door stayed open. Just as I started to wonder why my mum was checking on me for so long, I heard the fire door open and my mum say, ""Why is not-a-tapir's door open?"" and I heard her and my step-dad come down the corridor, she must have looked in and then she shut the door. Obviously, I immediately sat up and put the light on, thinking a monster was in my room. Never been so scared in my life. Logic brain says maybe the pressure from the fire door opening opened my door, but I was sure I heard footsteps and I was sure I heard my door handle pull down. My mum also says they hadn't opened the door twice, so who knows?"

I did not realise size 16 was the average here, that's awful. On the bright side, 45% of women here are size 16 or bigger, so the majority of the female population is still smaller than the average. Averages are a terrible way to condense data. [This](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN03336) is also very helpful, it shows that age is a huge factor, as well.

I don't know if you've heard of it, but it means that people can 'travel' from one place to another. Once there, they can actually reproduce, maybe with locals, maybe with others like them, who we call 'migrants'. I can't imagine why, but those children and their descendants not only get to keep the name that came with their ancestors (if their migrant ancestors were male) but having been born and raised in this new place, they're actually considered to be *from* that place. Fancy that! Imagine if simply being born somewhere and living there your whole life made the culture of that place so inherently part of your identity you actually got to consider yourself as being *from* there, despite having filthy migrant ancestors! No, no, clearly only people with good, strong Irish names can be Irish."

Connor is insecure because most people think Sophie is several ranks above him appearance-wise, not because he's possessive and controlling and there are 'massive red flags about how he'll be on the outside'. Also, yes, I think it's a bit inappropriate to post trophy-hunting photos, regardless of the reason the animals were killed, but no one has had a single nice thing to say about Ollie based on that alone. Maybe he's just a rich kid who doesn't know any better or maybe he thinks that the reason makes it acceptable or maybe he didn't realise how bad it was at the time, I don't know, but everyone was so ready to hate him.

Personally, I can't take anyone with that bowl cut seriously, but just because he's not my type doesn't mean he can't be her's. People get kind of fixated on their own tastes and opinions, like people not believing Maura was into Curtis because he wasn't to most people's taste or most people couldn't imagine them together. Just because you think Islander A is a 9 and Islander B is a 5 doesn't mean everyone agrees. Obviously, most people here don't see it, but I think there is a point where people need to stop projecting their preferences while watching, because it then leads to, ""So-and-so must be playing a game, how could they possible be into the person they're coupled up with?"" and that starts to go down the bullying road. Just my thoughts on it."

DoggyDNA,fel53kq,t3_eplvfz,1579214247.0,"The main thing that bothers me about WP results are the percentages. Time and time again I see results (including mine) that are 50/12.5/12.5/12.5/12.5. Sure, it adds up to 100 and looks neat on a family tree, but in reality, that's just not how genetics work. It's also pretty unlikely that a crossbreed would have mostly pure, 100% pedigree great-grandparents. So when you look at your dog's family tree on WP, it looks right at a glance and, largely, I accepted it, because most people think about dogs in terms of breed and it was so neatly laid out, ""Oh, my dog had a 100% purebred Boxer parent and a 50/50 GR/Akita grandparent and a Lab cross grandparent."" It feels comfortable enough for you to accept, but when you've seen 50-100 posts with the exact same percentages as your dog, it does actually click that that neatness is the result of skew to try to present the information in a way that customers will feel comfortable with, not necessarily what is the most accurate. I suspect that someone in the marketing department for WP has said, ""Well, actually, customers don't want accuracy, they want to understand their results,"" and while that is probably true for a lot of people, it's also not true for a lot of people and I don't really think they make it clear that they provide *neat* results, not necessarily accurate results.

The end result is that a lot of people feel a bit like they wasted their money, particularly when they get a high percentage of 'Breed Group(s)', which doesn't really mean anything and a second test with Embark usually severely lowers the percentage of unknown breeds. If you can't afford Embark, Wisdom Panel is great and it's led to me realising a number of things about my dog's appearance and behaviour that are really interesting and I don't regret doing it at all, but if you can afford Embark, Embark is the obvious better choice."
DoggyDNA,fel2z3u,t1_fel1xyx,1579212936.0,"The main thing I've learned from this sub is that WP not only test for fewer breeds but round up percentages. So you see a lot of 50/12.5/12.5/12.5/12.5 results with very neat supposedly pure pedigree-filled family trees, where Embark will give more accurate percentages. I'm retesting just to confirm (also added the health screen to make it feel like more than just curiosity), but I do hope I'll also get some clarification on a breed group that came up. Most comparison results I've seen do clear up some of the 'breed group' results, but I don't think I've seen any comparisons yet that were 50% breed group, so I'm not sure. I'd definitely do it if I had that big an unknown, just to see."

Terriers are a group of dogs that have historically been used for vermin hunting, they're not genetically linked as a singly group. You can't prove a dog's breed based on appearance, humans find an appearance attractive, they breed dogs that look a certain way and then when they like the appearance and have enough numbers to breed the dogs to one another, they say, ""This is a pedigree breed."" A breeder intentionally bred out Dalmatians to Pointers to eliminate a recessive gene linked to liver disease, those dogs are now considered Dalmatians because they *look* like Dalmatians and have been bred back to Dalmatians for enough generations. You could, if you wanted, selectively breed non-Dalmatians together to create dogs that look like Dalmatians if you want, you just the right mix of dogs to make a dog that looks like a Dalmatian, you don't need a Dalmatian and that dog would not be a Dalmatian.

UKParenting,fejnxvl,t3_ephlro,1579181178.0,"My personal rule for sick days is unless you're contagious, go in and get sent home instead of not going at all. It's natural that you might not be entirely on the same page about how concerned you are about his condition, but school is a legal requirement, it's not up for debate, in my opinion. I don't think our school system is amazing or has more value than what children learn at home, but currently, what your son is learning at home is that he can play on his mum's fears about his health to get his own way. Also, being clever and being ahead is a bit of a trap. If you're not pushed to try harder, you won't because you don't need to and that's a terrible life lesson. If he's not learning anything new at school, the solution to that isn't not going but asking the school to provide more advanced material for him.

I'd suggest sitting down with your wife and agreeing on criteria that necessitate a day off school (e.g. specific symptoms) and what a day off school should look like (as others have said, boring, no games, no TV, no trips out). Minor symptoms should be acknowledged, definitely, but I don't see why he can't go into school with an 'achey ankle' and come home if it develops into further symptoms over the course of the day. Realistically, this is a condition he's going to have for life, so there is going to be a point where your partner is going to stop fussing over every tiny little issue, if nothing else, it sets a bad example. As a habitual school skipper with good grades myself, I don't recommend letting him get into the habit."

I mostly don't give a shit what people do in the comfort and privacy of their homes, but when you're smoking weed in the comfort and privacy of your own home and the smell is so strong it permeates through my bedroom wall to form a stench cloud right over my infant son's cot, we've got a fucking problem. And what exactly can I even do about it? Confrontation with my neighbour? No, thanks, terraced house, we basically live on top of each other. People here smoke in the street because our police service is too stretched to stop them, reporting it is pointless. I'm not saying we're moving house because of it, but it definitely is a factor. Weed is just antisocial and obnoxious. Stoners don't realise how much they, their home, the contents of their pockets stink, the money they use to pay for my second-hand goods, even.

babywearing,fdvl2kw,t3_en6ysw,1578748516.0,"If babywearing hurts, it's most likely that either the carrier is badly designed or you haven't adjusted it quite right. I don't know that specific brand, but looking at it, it looks quite standard. So, main things to do when you put it on:

* Waistband is over or above your belly button and ***tight***. This is where the weight is meant to be distributed, so you're carrying from your hips, not your shoulders.
* After putting your baby in, lift him up before tightening the shoulder straps. This will get him in close so he's not pulling away from your body. Make sure the straps are the same length (mirrors help).
* I can't see from the photos if there's a back strap clip, but if there is, it should be directly in the centre of your back. You might need help or orangutan arms to adjust this, but once it's adjusted once, you shouldn't need to mess with it again.

Honestly, having owned 3 different carriers, I do think you get what you pay for to some degree. I can see that carrier is very much on the cheaper side of things and although it looks the right shape, if the structure or fabric has any weaknesses, that can result in a baby leaning back away from your body, which will hurt your shoulders. Stretchy wraps, I think, are really for newborns, there's a point where the stretchy quality becomes completely counterproductive. Woven wraps are a bit better in that regard, but I found it very hard to adjust a wrap correctly every time and it's frustrating if you find out you've done it poorly after 10 minutes of walking when you can't put your baby down to have another go.

Have a look and see if there's a local sling library near you or a babywearing consultant. You can usually rent carriers from them to try them out (as well as having an expert teach you how to use them) before buying and definitely don't bother buying new, check Facebook Marketplace, Shpock, whatever other second-hand selling sites are available in your country. The bigger brand carriers usually go for about £40-60 in the UK second hand and of course you can sell on your own carrier and wrap to offset the cost a bit."

Also a lot of trophy hunting companies sell foreigners on the idea of it being conservation, just like in Southeast Asia, it's common for 'sanctuaries' to actually be full contact wildlife tourism centres. I'd need to see more about the company he worked with to feel confident that it was purely about conservation.

My sister has done this to her son, it's deeply embarrassing."

povertyfinance,fdqtsbb,t3_emo6p7,1578674714.0,"Myself and my husband both have financially abusive exes. Mine acted like he knew how to handle finances and I was 18 when we met so let him. He spent all our bill money on burgers and Lucozade over 9 years, still not sure how he evaded debt collection for so long. Our debt can be measured by his waistline. Weirdly similar story for my husband, his ex had him living on rice pudding while she binged on takeaways she wouldn't finish (but also wouldn't share) every night, had a meltdown if he refused to pay for anything so he took out pay-day loans to pay for bills and then pay-day loans to pay back pay-day loans. I paid off my debt just because fortune landed me with a great job working from home when I had very severe anxiety. Lost the job just before my 6-month probation, my boss is a bit trigger-happy and hired me before realising he didn't actually need me in quiet periods so offered me some freelance work for the same rate, but only in busy periods and eventually not even then. I also applied for PIP for my anxiety, which is a benefit in the UK that isn't means tested, just based on your condition. Application was declined because I have no physical disability. Muddled along, paying off dribs and drabs that we could for the last 3 years, but knowing it'd be a long time before we were debt free as a couple. We had a baby, got married and were starting to save to buy a house, knowing that we'd have paid off my husband's debt before we saved enough. We didn't have to save too much thanks to my mum, it was basically just fees we needed. Just before Christmas, got a phone call, ""Oh, hey, there was an error in the law that prevented you being entitled to PIP for your mental health condition, you're now entitled to 3 years of arrears."" 3 years of arrears is almost £10,000. Spent the next 2 weeks thinking it was a prank or a mistake or that I'd calculated the arrears wrong. I didn't. The only thing stopping us buying now is our lease being almost up and not wanting to be rushed, so we'll rent for one more year in the area we plan to buy and that'll be the last property we rent. I just can't explain how I feel. I'm still in shock. The people responsible for my anxiety will never face any kind of repercussions for what they did, but it still feels a bit like victim compensation, in a round-about sort of way."

AskUK,fdq9z51,t1_fdq1248,1578660684.0,"Yeah, there's a complete wage trap in London and my sister's in the same boat. She has talked about moving back to London for work a lot, where I think she should consider completely different parts of the country. I think she sees the wage difference and thinks they'd be worse off, but the Midlands and north have such a cheaper cost of living, even if you need a car because the public transport is worse (assuming you don't pay a ridiculous amount on finance, we just buy retros outright).

Where I grew up in Scotland is sort of a different kind of trap, I think. The housing is cheap but the cost of living is very high, particularly in tourist towns where the only local shops will sell butter for £3 because they know you can't go anywhere else, but wages are still quite low. There's a lot of poverty in tourist towns, but it's hidden away from the shiny facade. I also increasingly feel I grew up in a place that intentionally or not protected sexual predators. A fair few men I was aware of as being 'a bit dodgy' when I was a kid have been charged in recent years for sexual offences against children and teenagers. I feel like people must have known about it, since even as a child I knew something was off, but that nobody reported it for 20-odd years is disgraceful. People think rural towns are safe because everyone knows everyone, but that also makes them incredibly closed communities where nobody wants to be the one to rock the boat. I reported a historic incident myself and I fully expect to get shit for it if it leads anywhere, it's sort of a 'turning on one of your own' thing. People don't want their little world to change, people don't want to be accused of poking their nose in, even if they suspect something is going on. Not sure people consider that aspect of things, really, but I definitely do now that I have a child of my own."
AskUK,fdq0mvs,t3_emnqnz,1578648980.0,"I moved from Highland Scotland to the East Midlands as a teenager. Other than meeting my husband, huge mistake. But you couldn't pay me to live in the South of England. Sure, it's a bit rough round the edges here, but at least we can afford to buy a nice 2-3 bed house here. We don't even have great jobs, I do shite freelance work during our son's naps and my husband is lower management at a company that is quite well known for offering low salaries.

By contrast, my sister lives in Brighton, is an architect, her partner a web designer and they're forking out double our rent for a space smaller than one floor of our house. Despite huge disparity of income, they constantly worry about money and we don't have to. With lower rent, we can afford a car and therefore get to cheaper shops like Lidl, whereas my sister can only reasonably get to corner shops and expensive supermarkets, so they tend to have a lot of meals out. The South seems like a bit of a trap to me, where people are fooled by big salaries and wealthy communities into thinking their lives will be better there, but the cost of living is ridiculously high by comparison."

aww,fdln5ii,t1_fdl2wmt,1578527809.0,"Most dog training is associated with a hand signal as it is, e.g. Sit is usually a raised finger or hand, stay with palm open flat, pointing at the floor is usually lie down. To train basic commands, you'd use the appropriate hand signal for her. In terms of daily needs and actual assistance, it depends what she needs.

If she needs a dog to wake her up when an alarm clock goes off, for example, all you need to do there is teach a behaviour then associate it with a sound. In a really easy, not necessarily 'pro assistance dog' context, you could just record the alarm sound and play it before the dog's meals. I know my dog would be bouncing off the walls trying to wake me up if he knew the alarm meant breakfast! Basically, train a behaviour, such as 'touch' (dog touches nose to hand) as an alert, then add the trigger to the command, then remove the command, always rewarding with treats or play.

The only sort of requirements for assistance dogs is that they be quick learners and not have severe behavioural problems (e.g. are well socialised, not nervous) and being food motivated helps."

AskReddit,fdhdagn,t1_fdgz62x,1578420313.0,"Mate, you clearly know nothing about breastfeeding. Expressing isn't easy at all. Either you're there squeezing your boob getting hand cramp for about an ounce an hour or you try to use a pump and after 3 hours, nothing comes out. Why? Because milk isn't just there on demand, there's a thing called letdown that happens about 5-20 seconds after a baby starts suckling. When a baby is nursing, looking at them triggers oxytocin release and that's what triggers letdown and further milk production. Funnily enough, it's hard to trigger an oxytocin release with a machine. Yes, you can look at your baby's face if you're pumping near them, but even at my most productive, I could only pump 6 ounces *a day*. Babies need 4 ounces *a feed*. Even then, my son often refuses to bottle feed and needs the comfort as well. Breastfeeding (as opposed to bottle feeding) also helps with bonding, emotional security and reduces the need for dummies, which are meant to be phased out by 6 months (babies need to have breastmilk or formula until 12 months, the WHO advises breastfeeding for 2 years).

If you're just glancing over like you're describing now, who cares? But you've said 'staring' several times, which is a completely different thing. Like it or not, the law is the law, if you make a breastfeeding mother feels so uncomfortable with your behaviour that she feels she doesn't want to feed, that's a breach of the law. It is a business owner's responsibility in the UK to ensure that breastfeeding is possible and unhindered on their premises, including ensuring they aren't harassed or victimised. There is a hugely dangerous and damaging formula feeding culture that is currently believed to be the leading cause of obesity. Why don't women want to breastfeed? Largely because of people like you, because people think their breasts are sexual rather than a method of feeding their babies and because they feel too embarrassed to sit in a cafe and feed their babies. Cloths, covers, bottle feeding, sequestering yourself in a dirty toilet, these things are easy to suggest when you're not a breastfeeding mother and don't know how frustrating it can be to feed your baby sometimes without some arsehole leering at you across the cafe. You know what? When my baby needs to be fed, I couldn't give two flying fucks if someone catches a glimpse of my nipple because my priority is my baby, but I'd absolutely complain if someone caught a glimpse and then didn't have the common decency to just turn away. Do as you would be done by and all that."
