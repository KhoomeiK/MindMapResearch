antinatalism,ffcpmbg,t1_ffas5mt,1579804533.0,"It doesn't make sense to say it's better for a person to exist when they would not have felt deprived of anything or worse off in any way by being non existent. 

The water analogy makes sense because if there is no thirst, there is no need to drink water. Drinking water is a good thing for existing people, because it slakes or prevents thirst. But it doesn't follow from this that we should bring more people into existence so that they can drink water. It is exactly the same when applied to pleasurable experiences. If you don't create the need for pleasure (and along with it the liability of being deprived of pleasure), then there is no need for the pleasurable experiences. Like water to drink, it is an instrumental good which only has value because it is needed or desired by an existing consciousness.

A universe filled with happy creatures isn't inherently superior to a barren one. And it is not ethical to create unneeded need and desire unless you have an absolute guarantee that it will not become an unwanted burden. A non-existent child is not deprived of anything, so there is no justification for creating a person who will be at risk of harm. If in a perfect universe, you were able to guarantee that all lives would be very happy with no significant suffering, then it would not be ethically problematic to create those lives, but still would not be fulfilling any intrinsic need for those happy lives. So I still wouldn't accept that you were doing anyone a favour by bringing them into existence."

Where you're coming from with that question doesn't even really make sense. If a person doesn't exist, there is nobody that you can refer to and say that they are worse off for not coming into existence. As far as we know, the universe itself isn't keeping a count of how many happy experiences are enjoyed on Earth, so human happiness doesn't seem to be serving any objective purpose. Creating a person so that they can experience happiness makes as much sense as creating a person so that they can drink water. If you don't have the need or desire for the thing in the first place, you don't need the thing that fulfils the need or desire.

Usually the problem is people getting hung up on the part where Benatar assigns a ""good"" to a condition that will not be experienced. But there are ways of wording it differently to try and prevent the argument getting diverted from philosophy to semantics. Granted, it doesn't always work, because some people aren't interested in trying to gain an understanding, they just want to grind the other person down with their intransigence.

The problem is that then they can just say ""it's all worth it"". I think that it's important to stress that you aren't rescuing someone from non-existence. Not existing isn't a harmful or deprived state. So that necessarily invokes the idea of an asymmetry. There's a risk free condition on one side, about which there is nothing needing improvement, and a risky condition on the other side, which is constantly demanding improvement.

The objections to Benatar's asymmetry are mainly semantic in nature.

I tend to pre-empt those cavills by just saying that if someone doesn't exist, they don't have any interests to be served by bringing them into existence.

>Is this a serious question? How does this follow from anything I wrote?

It follows from your denial that discomfort and comfort are states that supplant each other.

>Maybe you need to focus more on what I actually write then. Where have I ever denied the suffering?

You're denying the value of it, by failing to give justification for why it is worth bringing into existence for ends that, even by your own argument, don't need to be accomplished, and cannot even be objectively verified.

>They don’t need to be. It’s just permissible to serve them.

It isn't, because if I had the chance to give or deny permission for it to be done with my own welfare, I would deny permission. Given that you cannot guarantee that your future progeny will not be similar minded, and you cannot show what *existing* interest is being advanced on their part, then in order to avoid an ethical trespass, you must avoid risking that outcome.

>We are talking about existing beings then, correct?

We're talking about the fact that you aren't serving the needs of the same beings that don't exist prior to your intervention, because those interests do not exist.

>Only if their interests align with yours. Otherwise you discount them. That’s egotistical.

I await evidence that my tendency to avoid unnecessary harm to myself by not washing my mouth out with bleach and looking both ways before I cross the street is a mere eccentricity, and not shared by the majority of the population."
askphilosophy,fel1fmu,t1_fej8pw1,1579211987.0,"> My justification never once referred to my desires. You have to ask yourself why you cannot just confront my argument and have to argue against positions I don’t hold.

So having children is completely selfless. You don't have any desires at all invested in it? Liar. And if it's not your desire, and it's not the desire of non-existent entities, then what exactly is your basis for claiming that the lack of happiness of your potential future children is a problem worth risking (their) torture for?

>The latter was never doubted and in some moods you accept that it’s good to serve the interests of others, so if you call that preposterous, then go ahead.

I said that it's good to serve the interests of someone who already exists (provided that it doesn't come at a greater expense to someone else). I never said that it's good to create interests out of nothing for the sake of hoping that those interests can be well served.

>Some people? How should anybody ‘remember’ how unproblematic nonexistence was. Are you referring to the needs and wants of nonexistent people again?

No, I'm pointing out that people have an irrational bias towards existence, because they cannot conceptualise non-existence. People fear non-existence, which doesn't make any sense, and this has a bearing on whether people think that they were lucky to be born. If you can actually understand that non-existent entities cannot lose, then I don't understand how you can also argue that existing entities win merely by existing.

>That’s clearly false.

So there's no human life on Earth right now that you wouldn't be happy to accept for yourself? You wouldn't mind being disabled and in chronic agony every minute of the day? You wouldn't mind working 16 hours a day, 6 days a week in a sweatshop in an oppressive environment, just for the sake of being able to feed yourself rice every day and share a dorm with several of your coworkers? You wouldn't mind being so psychologically tormented that you are imprisoned in a psychiatric ward, and being so unhinged that you smear the walls of your cell with your own faeces?

>False analogy, because the same people who will say that they didn’t want to be punched will insist that they wanted to be created. You need to show that they are wrong. If you can’t, your argument fails. It’s that simple.

The analogy was that you create a problem that needs to be fixed, out of something that wasn't a problem, and then claim that you've done something productive. So that is an apt metaphor.

>One doesn’t exclude the other.

Your act cannot be serving interests that would never have to exist but for your decision to bring them into existence. Once you've set fire to your neighbour's house, yes, it is now in their interests for the fire department to be called, but there was never any need to create the circumstance where they have the need to have fires in their home extinguished.

>“Playing god“ is just emotional rhetoric that reveals you have problems looking at the issue soberly. Much like “enslavement”.

It's not. When you create a new consciousness, you are taking matter that was in a completely benign and value neutral state and then turning that matter into something that can be tortured. You've created an entirely new set of unneeded interests, needs and vulnerabilities.

>So then you don’t think that a world with a higher proportion of happy people is better than a world with a lower proportion of happy people even if the number of unhappy people stays the same?

Not unless it could be proven that increasing the number of happy people was ultimately going to extinguish unhappy people. If those additional happy people don't have the gift of ensuring that 100% of their own offspring will also be happy people, then that original generation of happy people cannot be brought into existence.

As it happens, you have nothing to show that you can guarantee that your child will be happy. To claim otherwise is an implicit indictment of any parent of an unhappy child (such as my parents, for example).

>That’s clearly false.

It's clearly true that you will not be cloning your own psychology, and therefore don't have to worry about being born with low functioning autism.

>And if my child will live a wonderful and satisfying life, I will not be the one who can enjoy these experiences. See how that works?

It seems obvious that you're bringing them into existence at least in part so that you can benefit from their existence. But you haven't shown why the possibility of the satisfying life is worth the risk of torture, when, as we both agree, a non-existent child is not missing out on anything by not existing, and therefore you are not remedying a state of deprivation by creating the potential for happy experiences. 

>Our combined ignorance is no argument for anything.

I know enough to know that I wouldn't take the gamble with anyone else. You likely know enough to know that there are lives that you wouldn't have wanted to be born into, but won't admit it, because then you'd have to justify potentially subjecting your own child to that torture.

>I understand that. And I am just pointing out that this is obviously a bad argument against moral permissibility. Like, it’s really obvious.

It's not a bad argument, because fundamentally, it's not your interests that you're gambling with. If you're gambling with someone else's interests, you need a much stronger case to justify it than ""I want it"" or ""I think that the universe needs more happy people, even though I can't articulate exactly how it is degraded by not having these happy people"". If you're taking your own savings to Vegas and gambling, then that is your moral right and privilege. If you're going to take out a loan in someone else's name without asking them first, that's an entirely different moral equation.

>Quote me saying it is logically inconsistent then. Can you?

I'm not going through the entire long discussion, but you've challenged me several times for supposedly invoking the interests of non-existent beings, with the implication that it undermined my argument.

>Where have you demonstrated that it will be broken? You are constantly referring to the decision as a gamble, which only makes sense if that is not guaranteed. Please make up your mind and argue for one of the positions

It will be broken, because the thing that you create will be capable of being tortured. And statistically, if everyone has the same attitude as yourself and keeps bringing more vulnerable people into the world, even if your child avoids the torture, there are guaranteed to be a continuing supply of torture victims. 

>So if the nonexistent had interests, then your argument would change?

As a reasonable person, my beliefs would be subject to change in relation to new evidence. It would depend on what was gleaned about the interests of those non-existent people and the character of the conscious state that they are currently experiencing. If the non-existent beings were in a state of perpetual bliss, then I would remain a staunch antinatalist, because we would be degrading their circumstances by bringing them into an imperfect world. Conversely, if we found out that they were being tortured by deprivation of worldly experiences, then I'd likely be a very staunch natalist and consider it my own moral obligation to have as many children as I could.

>How so?

Because you don't have the evidence to support your assumption, and have no insurance against the worst outcomes.

>No, in the very concrete sense that all my ambitions to experience something will be thwarted by my death.

So if that is a ""concrete"" harm, then how does it manifest in your universe? If you were the last conscious being alive, and you went to sleep one night thinking of all the wonderful things you were going to accomplish the next day, but after you fell asleep, you never again had another conscious thought...where exactly would the harm associated with your extinguish manifest in material reality?

>Only to the point that others agree with your evaluation of these experiences. As soon as they disagree, their experiences don’t count anymore. That is not concern for others.

So I suppose that things like taking pain killers when I've got terrible joint pain are just my little eccentricities. Interesting that medical science should have put so much funding and brain power into developing ways to combat pain and physical discomfort just in the off chance that someone with my particular set of idiosyncrasies should be born and want to avoid suffering that doesn't serve any valuable purpose.

>I do foresee that it’s possible. But possibility is no argument for impermissibility.

It is an argument for impermissibility when the alternative to taking action is harmless and costless, and when it's someone else's potential to be harmed that you're gambling with.

>That’s clearly false.

You haven't accounted for the risk. If there are no non-existent creatures experiencing the deprivation of pleasure, and the universe itself isn't keeping score of how many new happy people come into existence and have fun moments at Disneyland, then exactly how do you contrive the justification for imposing torture?

>Is this a serious question? By judging the likelihood of positive and negative experiences and their respective impacts. I am concerned about real people.

It's a serious question. And you haven't justified why your assessment is either accurate, or why you're willing to risk x possibility of torture for y potential of happiness that was not needed or missing from the universe prior to your intervention. My equation is perfectly simple, on the other hand.

If satisfying your desires was ethical paramount and the collateral damage irrelevant in comparison, then your position would be ethically justified. But that isn't what I understand to be ethical.

>That’s clearly false. I am claiming there will be a person that will profit.

And that's a preposterous claim, because the value of the 'good' is something that has to be contrived by bringing into existence a person to desire it. Now, some people, not having remembered how unproblematic non-sentience was, may feel as though they have been profited by coming into existence. However, the difference between those people and the ones who wake up every day resenting having to endure another day of conscious experience is nothing more than luck. Not fairness and not competence on the part of their parents at securing a desirable outcome. Luck. And you're imposing preposterous liabilities on your child by putting them into a position where they need and may or may not receive the joy that you wish for them. Some of those potential liabilities are things that you would likely not be willing to accept for yourself.

>That’s irrelevant because the goal pertains to the being that is created.

But you contrived the existence of the goal in the first place. If you punch your child in the mouth and break their teeth, then their goal is going to be to seek dental treatment. But that doesn't mean that the dental treatment is an intrinsic good that justifies the assault in the first place.

>That’s clearly false. Most people intuitively accept that serving their future interests is sufficient for moral permissibility.

Because those people *have* future interests already. In the case of procreation, you're gambling with future interests, not serving them.

>That’s clearly false. I have their future interests. You only have your interests.

But you're creating those future interests, which will only exist because you decide to play god. The future interests will not have been frustrated in the unlikely event that you humbly decide that you aren't qualified to play god with someone else's well being.

>That’s clearly false. You reject the permissibility of procreation even under the assumption that they will increase the proportion of happy people, as long as they don’t live a “perfect life”. Under this assumption the proportional increase is guaranteed and your position is inconsistent, since you claim there can be a morally impermissible action that is guaranteed to improve the world according to the standard you just defended (higher proportion of happy people).

You can't guarantee that your future child will be happy. Unless you're blaming all the parents of unhappy offspring for their childrens' misery. And I never said that someone and all of their descendants should be put at risk for the sake of increasing the proportion of happy people. I said that a world with a higher proportion of happy people is better than a world with more happy people, but in a lower proportion of the total. And I think that making people happy is a laudable goal, whilst making happy people is a reckless and impermissible one (in a world where their happiness is not a guarantee).

>That’s clearly false.

You can assert this confidently knowing that you're not going to wake up tomorrow having been reincarnated in Bangladesh, or reincarnated with some horrendous disability that will cause you to be in a state of agony and dependency all of your life. You think that you're insulated from the worst horrors that life can impose, and don't have to face up to the horror that you may be imposing on your child. If your child is going to be born into a life that is relentless, oppressive misery, you're not going to have to be the person to consciously endure that life.

>Same holds for you, unless you have been reborn.

Well that's the point; I wouldn't impose life. I know that there are lives that I wouldn't want to live (even without having experienced firsthand the horror of such a life), so would not impose the risk of having one of those lives on someone else.

>I see that. But other than negative utilitarianism you are lacking an argument. You can ignore the interests of human beings all you want. It doesn’t make you right, it only makes you egotistical.

I'm not ignoring the interests of human beings, I'm saying that the non-existent don't have interests, and that's not a problem. Once you create a person, you create interests, and then frustration of those interests is a problem. My argument is ""don't fix what isn't broken"".

>Where was I arguing for logical inconsistency? Please quote me. If you agree that the nonexistent are irrelevant to the argument, then just stop talking about nonexistent people.

The numerous times that you've accused me of saying that non-existent people have interests and appealing to those interests. The non-existent people are irrelevant because they don't exist, but the lack of interests needing to be served via a risky gamble with the future interests of an actual person is relevant to the argument. Because I'm demonstrating the fact that what you're proposing is an attempt to fix something that isn't broken in the first place, but will be made broken by your efforts to fix it.

>True. Does this invalidate anything I said?

It invalidates your assertion that your ""assumption"" that your child will have a life worth living is good enough to justify the gamble.

>That’s clearly false. Dying would thwart my ambitions irrespective of the fact that I will not notice that.

Only in some abstract sense, that would have to be assessed by some other consciousness. Actual experiences of being harmed are what I'm concerned with. 

>No. I am telling you that that is exactly what I would care about. And should it turn out that I could or should have foreseen this development and didn’t try my best to prevent it (including not procreating) then I am responsible for that suffering. But I care so much about actual interests of actual people that should my son come to me and tell me how happy he was to be alive and how thankful to me for giving him this possibility of leading a wonderful life and should it turn out that I could or should have foreseen this outcome and did everything I could to bring it about (including procreating), then I am responsible for that, too. I will certainly not ignore what he says and claim he was just deluded and that it was a horrible decision irrespective of whatever he has to say. You might find it odd, but I happen to care about people and like being consistent in my judgement.

You do foresee that it is possible for your future child to be miserable. If you go on to procreate again, then you simply choose to ignore this potential consequence. You know that the only way to avoid bringing more misery into this world is to refrain from procreating, but yet you will do so anyway and just hope for the best, because it it turns out for the worst, it's going to be them who have to experience the horror, not you. You're not going to be the one who will crash and burn, it will be them. Thus you can justify to yourself bringing about the potential for that outcome.

>That’s clearly false.

Where exactly in your reasoning have you accounted for the potential costs of your biological experiments?

You've accepted as some kind of fundamental truth that to exist is desirable, so that is where your logic stems from. But then your basis is in faith, not an objective truth. We can't observe that the non-existent Martians are deprived of the opportunity to have experiences. If I'd never have existed in the first place, it would not have been a problem for me that I lacked any chance to have experiences, because the consciousness that craves the experiences would not exist. There would be no desire to be satiated. And if there's no afterlife, my consciousness is not going to be able to regret the decision and feel deprived of future experiences.  Again, no desire will go unsatiated. Whilst I am alive, I will be deprived of many experiences that I would like to have, and that deprivation will manifest as suffering.

I'm not an emotional basket case, and I'm not experiencing any kind of overwhelming adversity at the moment. I'm on a fairly even keel most of the time (if a little on the dour side).

>As far as I can tell, this is not true for me and most people around me. I desire to live because life is great. There are many things that I would still like to experience. I’ll be peacefully dead soon enough, that is why I am not worried very much about harm coming my way.

Most people in the world aren't just having one big adventure after another. Most people are struggling just for the basics in life, day after day. Not everyone has a middle class American or European lifestyle, with a job that they like, no serious health issues, and so on.

And if you had a stroke tomorrow and were paralysed for the rest of your life and also went blind as well, that would thwart your ambitions to continue having certain experiences. Dying in your sleep would not thwart those ambitions because you would never consciously experience the deprivation of the experiences that you coveted.

>So then I am also the source of all their happiness until my distant ancestors do not procreate any more? Count me in then!

So are you saying that if your son came up to you once he was grown up and told you that he was miserable ALL the time and in constant pain no matter what he tries to do to remedy that, that you just wouldn't care about the fact that it was your actions that caused him to feel this way? All you care about is the potential for people to have their ephemeral and trivial little Disneyland moments, and you don't even care if your descendants have to endure another holocaust, just as long as there are more people experiencing more happy moments?


>Can you see how that second sentence invalidates the first? Interests only matter to you if they are related to avoiding harm, since harm is all that matters to you. If a person insists that his interests are related to different values, as actual people actually do, you just discount that. It is in this sense that you do not care about the actual interests actual beings express, only your interests. Hilariously enough, if nonexistent beings had any interests then this could affect your argument, since it relies on nonexistent beings having no interests. It is in this sense that you care about the interests of the nonexistent, but ignore the interests of the existing beings. My stance is the other way round.

All interests are ultimately concerned with minimising harm, and creating positive sensations is the way that harm is dispelled. Everyone wants to avoid having a nail in their eye, and having a nail in their eye will ruin anyone's Disneyland buzz. You're ignoring the entire suffering side of the equation and just pretending that the victims don't even exist. In non-existence, there is nothing needing or wanting to be comforted or pleasured in any way. If there were such things as incorporeal souls floating around, and they had a welfare stake in whether to be incarnated into a body, then of course that would ethically have to be taken into consideration. For example, if there were such things as incorporeal souls floating around feeling tormented by the fact that they weren't incarnated into a body, then the act of procreation would be a rescue mission, and a moral imperative."
askphilosophy,fegs6hv,t1_feg82ik,1579101295.0,"> Sure. So?

So then you are gambling with the welfare of your progeny and risking terrible suffering, and risking that they will be extremely resentful of the imposition. Since you're not correcting a problem that lies in non-existence, then you cannot ethically justify your imposition.

>Sure. Because you think there is nothing to gain, right?

There's nothing wrong with non-existence, so axiomatically no proposal to improve on that condition makes sense. By saying that you're going to bring someone into existence so that they may experience joy, you're implying that there's already a person who would stand to benefit. There is no person who stands to benefit until you create that person, with their need for joy, so therefore, there is nothing to gain.

>Can you give me an argument other than negative utilitarianism for that conclusion?

It would be the same argument against slavery. You should not gamble away the welfare of others in pursuit of goals that pertain only to you. You wouldn't want someone to steal your money and then go and gambling with it in Las Vegas. Even though it's possible that the gamble could work out in a way that satisfies you, and the thief returns more money than was stolen in the first place, you would still likely resent the fact that one of the possible outcomes would have been destitution for you, and they took that risk on your behalf without asking.

The argument that I'm making is one that is entirely ethically intuitive. Most people don't like other people taking unnecessary risks without our consent, when the stakes can be high. Especially when the person taking the risk had no reason to prove that our present situation needed improvement in the first place.

>That’s not true. Nobody says that the gains are required. You keep arguing against a stance I have never given voice to, because that’s the only argument you have. You should stop doing that.

If they're not required by the non-existent person, then the only justification that you have for the action is your own selfishness and lack of regard for the consequences of getting what you want.

>Improvements don’t need to be “demanded” to be improvements. If I think that a world with one happy person in it is better than a world with no happy person in it, then that’s all I need to talk about improvement against a world with no beings. As it happens, that’s exactly what I think!

I can't see how that argument would work, unless the universe is somehow objectively in a deprived state due to the absence of happy people. You have to create the first person in order for there to be any concept of improvement, so you are creating the problem before you are creating the solution (which solves nothing more than the problem that you have created).

>Clearly you don’t think that as -ceteris paribus- me creating a happy child increases the proportion of happy people on earth. Here we go with inconsistencies again.

Mathematically, there's no reason to think that your child is going to increase the proportion of happy people on Earth in the first place, as you have no way of ensuring that they will be happy. But I'm concerned with reducing the proportion of unhappy people down to 0%, and bringing more people into existence is injurious to that goal, in the long term. Even if your child does temporarily increase the proportion of happy to unhappy people in the world, they will likely cause more people to be brought into the universe, which delays the goal of the 0% unhappy people being actualised.

But what I'm pointing out is that it doesn't make sense to say that the number of happy people is more important than the proportion of happy people. The best option would be no people, but having a higher proportion of happy people would be superior to having a greater number of happy people but with happy people being a lower proportion of the total number of people. No inconsistencies at all, because my point all along has been that I want to reduce suffering, not increase happiness.

>I don’t think there is “a right way” for population ethics, so I am not phased by the repugnant conclusion. I think any form of utilitarianism (including negative utilitarianism) is wrongheaded for this reason. If I had to chose between the two worlds in your example I would say that neither choice is obligatory or impermissible. If you were to add an empty world to that, I would also think that all three choices are permissible and none obligatory. There can be reasonable disagreement in moral dilemmata, because they are set up such that different values are in conflict.

The reason that you would permit unhappy people to be brought into the universe is because you've already been born and, as far as you're concerned, the risks are being applied to people other than yourself. If you're entered into a lottery wherein 9 people are delighted and 1 person is tortured, you're far more likely to endorse the lottery if the numbers have already been drawn and you are one of the 9 lucky people, than if you had been the 1 unlucky person who has to be tortured. If the lottery has yet to be drawn, and you know that there is a 1 in 10 chance of being brutally tortured, then you're likely to have serious misgivings about being entered into that lottery in the first place, especially if you aren't already feeling deprived of the prize that you would win.

>Let me ask you a question in return: If you life a life in bliss, but stub your toe once and suffer from the pain for a minute -an event that you forget already 5 minutes after that-, do you hold that this is a life worth living and creating?

It's not worth creating in the first place. I don't know whether it would be worth the trouble of committing suicide over. If a stubbed toe was the worst outcome possible, then I wouldn't be bothering to promote the philosophy of antinatalism, because I am concerned about non-trivial suffering. But I still wouldn't concede that anyone is better off for having been born into such a world.

The world that you're actually bringing someone into is one that is filled with unimaginable suffering. You don't know 1/1000th of the suffering that your child could realistically have to experience. You haven't even died yet, so you haven't any experience of the dying process that you are willing to impose on someone else (and all of their descendants). 

>That’s a false analogy precisely because it is not possible to create happiness without creating a sentient being if there is none. Since I give a positive value to happiness it follows logically that -all else being equal- I have to give a positive value to actions that are logically necessary for the creation of happiness. Can you see that?

And if you don't create the sentient being, then there's no problem because there is nobody to need happiness. That absence of happiness does not manifest as a deprivation of happiness. I understand what your point is, but I vehemently disagree with your assertion that it should be your moral right to make that decision on behalf of other people. Your belief that the world can be improved by bringing more happy people into it is not a problem that exists outside of your perception, and therefore it is unethical to gamble with someone else's welfare for the sake of validating your philosophical belief.

>Imagine that John had no interests then.

If John exists and hasn't been permanently rendered unconscious, then he has interests. 

>I didn’t say that it’s a logical error. It certainly is a moral error to worry about the interests of nonexistent beings. If god doesn’t exist it simply doesn’t matter morally what this nonexistent god is interested in. If a nonexistent god hated blasphemy, that wouldn’t change the moral assessment one bit. Do you see the difference?

You were arguing that it was logically inconsistent and claiming that I was referring back to the interests of non-existent people, when I was actually referring to the absence of interests. Just as would be the case with someone who is defending the right to blaspheme, which you don't see a problem with. I don't worry about the concerns of non-existing beings, and I have never said that non-existent beings have a preference between non-existence and existence, and that we need to take the non-existent preferences of the non-existent into consideration. I'm arguing that when you create a person, you create a set of interests. And they will experience things in their life that will be in violation to their interests. Sometimes they will decide that the majority of what constitutes being alive is in violation of their interests. 

>Free from excruciating harm maybe, but not free from any harm. That is what your position would require though.

I'm not experiencing excruciating harm, and I'm not enjoying life much at all. It's demonstrated even in the cases of people who are very wealthy that the state of bliss is not something that is sustainable, and that there is a tendency once you have what you desire, to crave more and more. It's called the hedonic treadmill.

In most cases, I don't think that it is bravery that keeps people living, I think that it's a lack of bravery in most cases. Living is what happens by default, to die is what requires overcoming powerful evolutionary instincts and taking a risk of seriously harming yourself. Although that isn't to say that there aren't some who did have the bravery to die, but continued to live out of bravery. I just think that those are a minority of cases, and it certainly isn't my situation.

> I thinks its braver to live a full life which is unpredictable than to end it (most brave probs being people with suicidal thoughts who are able to suppress it) but thats just my opinion 

In most cases, I would say that this isn't so. But it really also depends on how you value life. If you've rationally decided that life is all work for nothing of any intrinsic value, then it wouldn't be bravery to suffer for something that you've rationally decided is not valuable."

That's a really ridiculous excuse for depriving someone of their freedom, based on the fact that since they're suicidal, they *may* (in a miniscule proportion of cases) also be homicidal. You're talking about convicting people without a trial, or any evidence, basically. Based on some notion that suicidal people are deranged and are at high risk of going on a murder spree. 

Also, this doesn't explain why people are stopped in the process of a suicide (one where they are not harming anyone else). Clearly in that instance, it is obvious that they have no intention of posing a threat to others."
unpopularopinion,fef6ou3,t1_fef5otx,1579049462.0,"> PLEASE explain the bigotry. Religion did not even enter my argument. You are a pulling things out of thin air to justify your rage.

It's not innocuous when it's used to deny the autonomy of those people that you are casting aspersions on. 

>No person in their right mind would ever say ""Yeah Ill kill myself tonight."" It takes an extreme event or long deep seeded sadness. Or just straight mental instability.

Why the fuck would nobody in their right mind have that idea? Do you remember feeling deprived of your life before you came into existence? If not, then why could someone not rationally come to the conclusion that life is not worth living, if the only problems that it solves are the ones that it created itself? I can't remember a single problem that I had in non-existence that was solved by coming into existence. Returning to that seems like a rational choice when sentient existence is something that *always* requires maintenance and always leaves much to be desired, even in the best cases. A reaction to an extreme event, or feeling persistently sad is not insanity. There's no evidence that a life affirming attitude is the one that lacks any kind of cognitive bias, and that any outlook that is negative relative to yours is deranged and deluded.

>I never once mentioned god or gay rights. You pulled those straw mans out of your ass to sound noble.

The significance of gay rights is that homosexuality was deemed to be a form of insanity, and was in the DSM until the late 1970s. The reason that it was taken out of the DSM was not due to some breakthrough discovery, but due to the fact that the majority of psychiatric diagnoses are based on subjectively determined criteria, not hard empirical facts. And if you think that it's impossible for a rational person to think that life is not worth living, then that does imply that life was created by a rational agency, given that unintelligent designs tend to produce more failures than they do successes. Producing a successful design usually requires intelligence, and we've no evidence that life has received the stamp of approval from anyone capable of making objective, authoritative judgements, that are applicable in all cases.

>Do you know who we ""lock up?"" People who are a danger to others in society... or themselves.

People who are a danger to others should be locked up. The other group are those who have subversive ideas that run contradict a philosophical outlook to which you subscribe and cannot allow to be discredited in any way by allowing people to invest their own welfare in a competing philosophy.

Nobody should be locked up on the strength of the fact that they don't have unwavering faith in the belief that life is better than non-existence, when such has never been proven. You're the one making sweeping generalisations concerning people who have come to the conclusion that life is not worth living, and not only that, but by dismissing them all as insane, you're trying to prevent them from even being able to express their opinion and be listened to without prejudice."
