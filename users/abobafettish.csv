Military,fdpa9um,t3_emjtqe,1578623657.0,"To start,  You are definitely not a badd person for wanting to improve yourself. I'm sure most of us who joined the military joined for those reasons among many others. Whatever reason you choose to join the military is for you and you only and who gives a funk when anybody else thinks about it. I knew people who joined just for the college money. I knew people who joined just to escape problems they had at home. I also knew people who joined out of a sense of patriotism. No matter what the reason is as long as it's something that you really want to do and no one is coercing you to do it, then join.

That being said the military is not necessarily for everyone nor will it necessarily fix your problems. It can definitely help you improve yourself in the ways that you mentioned; improving your physical and mental strength, as well as creating that sense of camaraderie that bonds everybody in the military together. But don't think of the military as your only option for improving yourself or for serving the U.S.

There are also other things you can do to serve your country that doesn't require you signing your life over to the government. You may look at something like the Peace Corps for example. They deal lot of amazing and much needed work overseas, and I believe the commitment is two years. 

If you do decide that you would still rather join a branch of the military, make sure you take the time and do your homework on the different jobs that are available in each service branch as well as what you would want to ultimately do as a career once you're out of the military (you won't be in forever).  The military is a great way to find a career path that you could potentially do in the civilian world once you're done. What I'm saying is, find a job that translates well into the civilian world. Don't be a dummy like me and go infantry, because no one is hiring trigger pullers unless you want to do manual labor or be a cop/security guard.

Second, don't apologize. It's good to vent about what's bothering you, and it sounds like you needed to do it. You have support here.

Third, thoughts of suicide are very common; it's acting on those thoughts where you run into trouble. I personally deal with suicide ideation on the regular, and it sucks. For me it becomes a downward spiral of negative thoughts about myself as a person, which further feeds into the ""you should just off yourself"" rationalization. So please know that you are not alone. 

Fourth, please seek help or at least someone you can talk to who you know won't judge you. It's not easy to share these kinds of thoughts with others, especially loved ones. If you love your family, talk to them and share what you're dealing with. Never be ashamed by these thoughts.
