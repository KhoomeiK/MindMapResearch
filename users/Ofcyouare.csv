That's my point. They were afraid that new government will try to get out of the lease. Black Sea fleet was one of the biggest points of conflict between Russia and Ukraine ever since USSR was gone. Always a lot of tension, always a lot of protests. And anti-russian ideas in Ukraine were on the rise at that time, as things like tragedy in Odessa showed.

>why would a base in Crimea of such utmost importance? Russia has it's own naval bases on the Black Sea.

Sevastopol was always the main base of Russian fleet in the area. Yes, they made new base in Novorossiysk, but it was more of an additional one. Crimea remained the main point, three of the four Black Sea fleet bases are there and most of the current aviabases of that fleet as well.
