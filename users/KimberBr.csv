AskDocs,ffevvc5,t1_ffduc38,1579867730.0,"NAD

It is in the States as well. After getting any kind of shot, its standard practice to remain in the waiting room for 15 minutes. Usually most people ignore that but it's there for a reason and allergic reactions are a big one."
Veterans,ffevbsl,t1_ffd19g4,1579867105.0,"I am proud to be American and am a Permanent resident of Canada with no intentions (right now) to become a citizen of Canada. That being said, I love Canada and as long as I'm married (so hopefully the rest of my life) I will remain in Canada as that is what my hubby wants and I have no reason to fight him on it. If/when we have kids, we plan to have family vacations in both countries to show them both their heritages. 

It's really up to you whether you live in the US or Canada. 

Pros for the States:
Its infinitely cheaper (depending on the state and area of the state of course) to live in the Statea. As an example, rent on a 2 bedroom here runs anywhere from $1200-2000 depending on the city. Also buying is cheaper. I've seen housing and acres of land go for $15,000 in parts of Texas, etc. Of course depends on the market but a 2 bed house here is around $150,000- 500,000 if you want a house to fix or condo already done

2. Healthcare, while not cheap, is faster. In Canada its ""free"" (while paying 14% in taxes compared to 8% in the States) but things like xrays and ultrasounds etc (unless emerg) can take months if not up to a year or even 18 months.

3. Schools are about the same in either country I've found (international students pay out the wazoo either country

4. Living in the states is a bit more vibrant. Again depending on the city it can be more active. Malls and such stay open later. Here malls close early on the weekends. I remember staying at a mall until 11 or 12 when I was growing up so it could just be that but in Canada they always seem to close early even on the weekend lol

5. Depending on your political views, Trump can be an asset or not. Politically and economically he is good for the country but his personality and such rub people the wrong way and the rest of the world has worst views on him as our Prez. 

Pls dont turn this into a war if you arent a Trump supporter because I do understand where yall are coming from but I didnt vote for him (I was already living in Canada when he was elected) and Canada's PM isnt much more popular here lol

Pros for Canada

1. ""Free"" healthcare (non residents do have to pay but Permanent residents and citizens are eligible for the free healthcare)

2. Quieter and safer (smaller cities vs big cities). Take with a grain of salt since some small cities in the States are safe too. 

3. Cities are greener. In Canada they try to keep as much of the natural land as they can.

4. People are friendlier. Apologize a lot but they are so much more polite and most of the time, its genuine. Not to say there arent rude people but overall they are nicer imo. 

5. There are a lot of different cultures in every city. There are in the States too but here they stand out more and so I hear it every day. You can immerse yourself in the cities without feeling like you might get lost.

I hope this helped. Regardless of where you choose to live, you have to make the right decision for you and it might take some moving around to figure out where you want to stay. When I got out of the military, I moved 6 times in 7 years. And I only became stationary after my hubby and I started dating. Otherwise I would have kept moving :)"

polyamory,ffck35q,t3_eskokv,1579801141.0,"My husband was married when we first started dating. My Dad and step mom have met my hubby (separately and step Mom  met him 2.5 yrs ago when we got engaged and started talking seriously about marriage). We were also in a bdsm lifestyle and my dad is super religious (now) and was not happy at all about what I was doing but he at least has met him and seems to accept my husband though we are not close at all. 

My mom, brother and sister all declined attending my wedding. None have met him and have no intention of doing so.

On the flip side, his parents accepted me way back when we started dating and have made a point to keep in contact with me (as in his mom and I talk 3-4x a week. I talk to my mom maybe twice a year. 

And to top it all off, hubby's gfs parents are also accepting of all of us. 

I agree with the poster who said start having family nights at your place. Then you can have both over and won't have to worry about one being left behind. Your parents will have to understand that it's your house and you can invite who you want so they can accept or decline. I hope they learn to accept!"

I agree you deserve to find someone who checks at least 95% of the boxes for you.

I've been with my husband for 12 yrs. If he didnt make me laugh (or giggle or snort) and vice versa, I absolutely wouldnt be with him. Everyone needs laughter in their lives to counter pain and anger.

relationship_advice,ff0dci2,t3_eqvtiq,1579467838.0,"NAL

There is no excuse for this kind of behavior. Your wife needs anger management and you need to consider if this behavior continues if you are comfortable in your wife ever being alone with your son. If the answer is no, you may need to consider more permanent options such as leaving her and making your son safe. 

Document everything. All the times she screams at you, any time she gets physically or emotionally abusive. And you need a lawyer if you decide to leave her. as the Stay at home Dad, they are actually more inclined to look favorably on you. The courts are no longer so biased against the fathers as they used to be"
Veterans,ff0bcpd,t3_eqwqmi,1579467182.0,"I went to college 3 months after I got out, did a 2 yr program until they decided to extend that another yr. Didnt want to stay in Iowa at the time, so moved to Wyoming, stayed there 1.5 yrs, moved to Massachusetts, stayed there 1.5 yrs, moved to Texas for 8 months, moved in with my then bf, now hubby for 3 months in Canada while searching for an apt in Buffalo NY. Visited between US and Canada for 5 yrs while working odd jobs and trying to find out reasons for my medical diagnoses via Navy, went to college 2011-2013 on GI Bill, graduated with a degree in Medical Office Admin, returned to the states for 1.5 yrs (seeing a pattern? lol) while working as a medical transcriptionists, returned to Canada to earn my PSW Certificate (think Healthcare aide) in 2015. Moved permanently in with my then fiance, now hubby and got married Jan 2019 after 11 yrs of being together. 

Looking back, I was restless and didnt transition as well as I thought I had either. 

But I stuck it out and am doing something I love. 

For all you vets out there, I highly recommend college. It honestly did help more than most people would have thought. and it gives you a focus that you might be lacking when trying to figure out where you belong in ths crazy civvie life of ours.

Veterans,femlou1,t3_epu8xl,1579261645.0,"I moved 7 times in 6 years. The only reason I stopped was because I started dating my hubby and Buffalo, NY (blech) was closest to the Canadian border. We have been together 12 years and married 1 (was trying to get here permanently before we married). 

I am a personal support worker doing homecare here in St Catharines Ontario Canada. My job in the military was Hospital Corpsman (Navy). I love my job and will do this job as long as my body allows. I also graduated twice from college (once using the GI Bill) with a degree in Medical Office Administration (2 yr degree that I fast tracked and was done in 15 months). So when I stop physically being able to do my job (its exhausting but well worth it), I have a career I can fall back on. My second time going to college I got my certificate as a Persona Support Worker (1 yr done in 8 months). 

Whether you decide to follow your career in the military or go in a brand new direction, do something you love. I rarely get up and hate my life. My job is very fulfilling and knowing I'm helping people who would otherwise be in ltc facilities stay at home is a reward in it's own right.

His family are jerks for treating their son and you that way. My hubby is tall and skinny so I have seen his self esteem take a hit now and again when people say that but he does have muscles from working in a kitchen so it's not exactly the same.

Has your bf tried construction? I know that's a weird question but he could get stronger and build muscle without the self consciousness of a gym. I honestly think they should have a private area for guys the way a co-ed gym often does for women. Men are self conscious too.

It might seem like the worst idea to apply but I say go for it. I'm not sure what country you live in but there should be grants and such you can apply for to help with rent and school.

polyamory,fcsyv2u,t3_eing94,1577928554.0,I'm so happy that you had a great experience. I havent been that lucky on my side but my husbands family has accepted me since the beginning when he was still married to his ex-wife and his gfs family has been the same (in fact I'm watching her little brother so they can have some alone time; we live next door to each other).

I think maybe he just wasnt expecting it and it caught him off guard but he still over-reacted

Veterans,fc05d8x,t3_efbmtk,1577279310.0,"Thank you for this. I am a Navy vet, medically discharged but not because of combat (screwed up my back and knees) and I never truly feel like I did my service because of it. I've always been proud to have served but whenever anyone asks if I was stationed overseas, I always felt uncomfortable saying no, as if that made me less of a veteran. I was stationed at the hospital in Great Lakes and my doctor never would have signed off on me going overseas anyways but I still somehow feel like that makes me less"
