Based on my own experience, I would say your cat simply prefers being at his 'grandparents' house more due to the fact that it is a richer environment.

The only thing I can suggest is to try to make your apartment more exciting for him - plant him some cat grass, catnip and valeriana, make sure he has a nice spot on the windowsill, get him additional cat trees and make use of vertical space by installing shelves for him."

this disease is hard as fuck 

Tbh bulimia is a bit different in everyone so I can only say what would help for me 

The most important is do not comment on her weight like AT ALL. Even positive comments can be triggering. Do not say anything if she gained weight, do not say anything if she lost weight, do not even tell her she looks healthy, people with EDs tend to hate that. Try to take all the focus off weight, whether it’s her weight or anyone else’s.

For me, a big part of my bulimia was uncontrollable binge eating. Some foods were very triggering to me and having them around made me automatically go into binge mode. I would recommend asking her if she has any trigger foods and avoiding them around her (Of course full recovery means you are able to eat everything in moderation but that’s usually not possible in the early stages of recovery). I personally felt bad telling people not to keep certain foods around me but secretly really wished they would...

Do not judge her or get angry if she purges, that should go without saying but some people still get angry at me when I admit that I have purged thinking it would help...

Does she see any therapist / take any medication? At first I didn’t believe in that shit but after I was hospitalized I didn’t have a choice and found out that meds such as Prozac and topamax as well as meditation and mindfulness help A TON.

Thank you for being so supportive and not judging your girlfriend. I think that doing this and listening to her are the most important things and you seem to be already aware of doing that :-)"

I don’t know much about Norwegian forest cats but I’d recommend a Maine coon. They still tend to be very friendly to humans but tend to be more assertive, for a lack of better word.

I dont think the spaying will be an issue if your other cats are spayed and you find the right window of time to spay the new cat just before he reaches maturity.

Also the owner of the dog seems very friendly so I don’t want to report her and I feel like it can be solved between the two of us if we both knew what the answer was (and I doubt that the landlord would know the answer to this issue any better...)

Also sorta off topic but my landlord didn’t do shit when I contacted him when two particular neighbours were having loud fights in the hallway so I doubt he’ll help w this lol

I feel like this cat will miss her passed companion regardless of whether you get a new cat or not and a lack of companionship will just aggravate her suffering. 

I would assume that this vet probably does not know her all too well and just goes by the standard rules. But each cat is different, some (like yours) are way more social than others so make sure you make the judgement yourself based on her personality and how much you are absent from home.
