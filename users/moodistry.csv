ForeverAlone,ffdsgci,t3_et03wv,1579827782.0,"I think it's a bit narrow for someone to suggest that if you've had sex, or even been a ""normie"" for some part of your earlier life, yet are facing the prospect of being alone for the rest of your life, you're not FA.  

For example, if someone was a high flying ""normie"" with a vibrant sex life (maybe married) through their 30s and then got in an accident and became a divorced quadriplegic, disqualifying them would mean an overly narrow and exclusionary definition.  That's a dramatic example, but there are many more subtle situations where I think people are legitimately FA.

I think FA is less about your history and more about where you are in life and the future you are facing, and ultimately of course, it is an identification anyone should be free to take, because it sure as fuck isn't really an identity any one would really want to have.  Exclusion is baffling, especially in a community that by enlarging, offers more diverse viewpoints and better support.  I don't think it should be a club or clique or echo chamber."
BipolarReddit,ffdr4t8,t3_et0rnt,1579826904.0,"I have no problem with my immediate circle knowing that I have a bipolar diagnosis.  But bipolar is just that for me, a diagnosis, and I keep that thorny thing at arms length, and use it for certain purposes.  I work to educate those people I share the diagnosis with to use that knowledge responsibly and carefully when interacting with me, and to resist the temptation to pathologize me.  They still do that, but I'm learning to be tactful and graceful and patient in setting boundaries and educating.

Rather than having or being a diagnosis, I'm much more interested in figuring out a way of describing how I am in terms of the wide range of actual mood states I experience, some of which are very spiritual and uplifting for me.  I want to go beyond defining not just myself, but even my mood patterns, in a strictly clinical way.  I already have a way of communicating the role of moods in my life, but it takes a lot of words to get it across (even then, some of it is beyond language).  I'd like to distill it down, maybe eventually to one word.  

I think that by finding a non-clinical way of describing the part of you called ""moods"", you take important ownership of that evolving experience in your life."
ForeverAlone,ffdpopu,t1_ffdbnui,1579825991.0,"Thanks so much for you response - it really touched me.

ForeverAlone,ffd8rsw,t1_ffd5l6m,1579815645.0,"Regarding friends who are parents, the experience of seeing people's family lives unfold on FaceBook is often a thing of sadness and some resentment.  Fortunately, I've deactivated and don't expose myself to the pain of that anymore.  FaceBook is supposed to keep people in touch and connected, but I think in many cases it can be somewhat toxic for single folk.  

When I was 47, I suddenly experienced a worsening shortness of breath.  After being misdiagnosed three times, it turned out to be a progressive and untreatable illness, with the only intervention being a double lung transplant.  I had two years of intensifying sickness, alone in my cold apartment, with no immediate family support, on oxygen 24/7, gradually losing lots of the things that made me me, and the ability to do activities of daily living.  Thankfully, I had volunteered some years prior with a hospice organization, and although my relationships with the people I worked with were casual in nature, they really stepped up in amazing ways to support me as a became sicker and waited for new lungs.  It was a major stroke of luck I never would have foreseen.  I never expect a ""return on investment"" for my hospice volunteer work, but things really came around for me.

It was a huge thing to having been a very independent person for my whole adult life to having to ask for and receive help - it was a big lesson in vulnerability and our inevitable need for assistance.  It would have been great to have a spouse, to have someone around most of the time, for touch, for help, for conversation, for love, for good food, for medical advocacy.  But at the same time, I knew people with SOs who were terminally ill, and that involves it's own serious challenges, in terms of conflicts and guilt about demanding so much care, so to some extent the grass seems greener but isn't necessarily.  I'm really glad I didn't have kids because it would have been so difficult to put them through that, in so many ways. 

So I basically cobbled together a support network, and that included a few young people who inexpensively provided me with a variety help.  

Obviously, I got my lung transplant, five years ago, and I've been thriving since.  For the lung transplant, I had to have a main support person 24/7 for six weeks after the surgery, and I ended up living with one of my hospice friends for those six weeks, and she was my primary carer.  She saved my life by doing that, giving up her privacy and energy and love, because I simply had no other options.  I'm very sad that she's pulled away from me over the last couple of years because she played such a critical role in my survival.  Really sad, and self-critical about the whole situation.  

I now live 2000 miles away from that support network, and 300 miles from the hospital that monitors my lung transplant.  If I go into rejection, although a second transplant is technically possible, it is simply not an option for me - I just don't have the support network in my new community, much less 300 miles away.  I'm okay with that - I long ago came to pretty good terms with my mortality, and I'm trying my best to stay healthy and live as meaningfully as I can in the days I have.  But it is a powerful reality related to being single and isolated: I will likely die at least indirectly as a result of that reality.  

I do have a couple of local friends who I don't see much, but can rely on in an emergency.  But they are not in a position to provide major help, nor would I want them to.  

How about you, in terms of support network, health and emergencies?"
mentalhealth,ffd5gyl,t3_esz9j3,1579813798.0,"Yikes, do I ever relate.  I'm a software engineer who is entirely self-taught since I was 14 (I'm 54 now) and so imposter syndrome runs through my veins.  Arguably, being self-taught in my field actually indicates passion, self-direction, and intuitive comprehension.  Though I can think of those things rationally, and see it about others like me, my IS just runs wild sometimes, mostly in the form of insecurity and paranoia and fear of discovery (of course).

I'm going to put this out there as the approach I would try to take in your situation (and I've been in similar situations).  I honestly think that in order to make the most of the situation, short-term and career-wise, if this guy is good at what he does, embrace him as a team member, make him feel welcome, and acknowledge what he offers in terms of good ideas and plans.  Do this things in plain sight so the project manager sees it.  The point is that your career doesn't simply rest on your writing, it rests on your effectiveness as a team member.  

I hope that's helpful."
SuicideWatch,ffd4dsp,t3_esz2ig,1579813190.0,"I'm 54 and was in a suicidal crisis about four months ago for very similar reasons.  

Please indulge me with the suggestion I make in the next paragraph.  If you find it an utterly annoying thing to ask, I understand and ignore it.  You've made a strong case for killing yourself - I had a list myself, and a note where I attempted to explain and justify my choice.  I can make an impressive case.  I can totally relate to how in a suicidal mindset, you get pulled into a powerful story about your flaws and the pointless of trying to repair yourself and your world.  

I'd like to encourage you, just as an exercise, to try to write a different story of similar length where you describe the good things you've done, the people you've touched, the accomplishments that you've had despite the failures, the most beautiful and uplifting moments you've experienced, and anything else you can think of that is a counter-point to what you say above.  I cannot believe those things don't exist in the totality of your half century of life in this realm.

I'd love it if you share it, but understand if the exercise feels pointless or you want to keep it private."
depression,ffd3bw2,t1_ffbhz0n,1579812599.0,"You said in the title of your post that you have depression.  Trust your own intuition about that, and in that sense (and only that sense), ignore the doctors.  If you've only tried only one doctor, try another.  Learn about the symptoms of depression and compare them to your situation to further define your sense of your mental health.  Bring that self-analysis to your appointment."
mentalhealth,ffd2x0y,t1_ffd1fg0,1579812365.0,"That sounds like really good advice.  If things change and you think I might be able to help more, I'm available and would love to help.  Wishing you the very best."
SuicideWatch,ffd2t3y,t1_ffcxl12,1579812301.0,"Thanks for sharing.  Like I said, I express love and care online, through text, but I don't have any illusion that it is meaningfully conveyed under these circumstances.  Sometimes there just isn't much else to offer or say, so I just send it out with an open heart hoping that it touches hopefully 1 in a 1000 people.  

My love and care for you is based in the fact that I totally relate to paranoia, hopelessness, and loneliness - in that sense, is not general but very specific.  I don't want to write an essay about me and my situation either, but suffice it to say I was on the edge of suicide about four months ago (researching methods, writing a note) for exactly the three reasons you mentioned (and a couple of more I won't go into it - I had a literal list).  All three are really hard, but hopelessness is in my experience of it the most dangerous and awful one for suicidal thinking, so I'll share my experience and thoughts about that.

I totally could not grasp what I'm about to say when I was suicidal myself, so I understand if you can't connect with it.  I'll say it from the perspective as someone who has (perhaps only temporarily, but I hope forever) recovered from the disease of suicidal thinking...  

Hopelessness is logically flawed insofar as it takes the past and assumes the future will be the same.  You can look all over the world and see experiences of transcending terrible circumstances, where people's lives take unanticipated pathways to betterment.  There is always the possibility of a future we don't project, that we cannot visualize.  I don't know if that sort of logic makes a difference to you - like I said it wasn't all that useful for me or foremost in my mind when I was critically suicidal (I was just drowning in despair) - but maybe it helps you in some small way.

The other avenue for me in battling hopelessness has been to seek out and respect the journeys of other people who have been in really dark, terrible situations themselves and have gotten through it, and seen their lives turn around.  My point is definitely not about ""your situation isn't as bad as others who have recovered"".  That is stupid blather, because suffering is deeply subjective and experiential, and comparisons between situations are meaningless.  Rather my point is just to find those stories and use them as mantras and reminders that there really is always hope and the possibility of recovery, even if you can't see it when you're in the pit.  

I hope in some small ways my experience and perspective resonates with yours."
bipolar2,ffcy68c,t3_esyci2,1579809700.0,"In my experience, most people are on meds for life.  A big risk is you get on meds that manage your bipolar well, and you begin to believe you don't need your meds.  Avoid that path.

If meds manage your bipolar well, then you may grow to be more comfortable and accepting of taking meds for the rest of your life.  They may give you a lot of emotion relief and make you a more effective person in your daily life.

Meds should absolutely be combined with lifestyle changes that support stable moods.

That said, there are people who carefully, thoughtfully and with planning, slowly go off their meds, and instead commit to lifestyle changes and careful self-monitoring of their moods.  There are actually online communities that support that process.  Often they are people who have diligently explored lots of combinations of meds but nothing worked.  Not using meds is absolutely something that should be done with full disclosure and  cooperation of your psychiatrist.   

I strongly encourage you to give meds a chance first.  It may take a while to find the right med, or cocktail of meds, for your personal version of the disease."
SuicideWatch,ffcx5m5,t3_esy5hp,1579809114.0,"You have my deepest and most heartfelt sympathies.  I am so very sorry.  Your pain is unimaginable.  

The best way to get help is to ask for it, and you're doing that right now.  Now start asking your loved ones, asking your friends, and asking professionals like a psychologist who specializes in grief.  Reach out to people like your life depended on it, because it does.  Another powerful way to get through it is to find a support group for grieving people.  You may be able to find one for parents who have lost children, if not one that is local and face-to-face, then an online community.  If you want help, I'm available to help you research it.

You can get through this.  You are not alone in facing this, so don't be alone in your struggle to process your grief."
mentalhealth,ffcwk87,t3_esx1aw,1579808764.0,"Those are very interesting and sensible ideas to me.  I have similar beliefs, though not exactly the same, and I'm pretty stable right now.  I think you can also find very similar ideas in some established spiritualities and religions.

That said, at the same time, if you've come up with these ideas relatively recently completely out of the blue, it could very well indicate psychosis or the beginning of psychosis.  Most people will regard your thoughts as ""grandiose"" delusions, which is a symptom of psychosis.

It makes great sense to seek help from a psychologist or psychiatrist, if for no other reason than to confirm that you're well.  It can't hurt, and may very well help!  At the very least, it will put your mind more at ease."
SuicideWatch,ffcv11f,t3_esx2j2,1579807831.0,"I'm not going to lie and say I'm a person who ""prays"" in the traditional sense, but as I write this and re-read your post, I'm thinking of you with full attention, and trying to send loads of compassion and love your way."
SuicideWatch,ffcufsj,t3_eswuo7,1579807485.0,"I see that in comments too.  Although I'm tempted to, I don't copy and paste suicide hotline information in my comments.  Just doesn't seem helpful and often some other person does it.  

Instead, apart from trying to give a kind of radical love, support and affirmation, I sometimes take a chance on offering a suggestion/observation that is somewhat off-beat and unusual, just to shake things up a little.  

If you tell me more about your situation and reasons for your suicidal thoughts/impulses I'll try to say something truly different, if I can come up with something.  I'll try to avoid the typical stuff, and I'll hold back the love if you don't want to hear that."
ForeverAlone,ffctprm,t1_ffcodwr,1579807064.0,"Your response and thanks really mean a lot to me.  Everything you said resonates with me too.  Yes, agree about parenthood and validity.  Another thing about parenthood for me is that as more and more of my friends from my 20s and 30s had kids, they had less and less time to invest in our friendship, and partly interest in it because we didn't have parenting in common.  That's been true to pretty dramatic extent, where contact as dwindled to one or two phone calls per year.  Thanks so much for your kind words!"
ForeverAlone,ffcl9vq,t3_eswe57,1579801861.0,"Weed is not a good idea in general in terms of easing loneliness, at least for me.  It is fleeting relief.

However, if you think weed is good medicine for you, and you feel certain you're not a substance abuser/addict, here's my approach.

I've been using cannabis for about 30 years, and it's been an ongoing ""conversation"" with the drug, always evolving.  For me, I get the most benefit when I haven't used for a while, but the problem is that if it's in the house, I gradually start using it everyday, and gradually earlier in the day/evening.  It just ends up being a big negative in my life, keeping me from connecting socially, eating compulsively and just binging on Netflix a lot.

Sometimes I've gotten high for a while, and when it starts getting sucky, and then let my supply run out, and I'll go weeks, months or longer before I use again.  This is a little bit of a test if you're an addict or not.  It's a good ""reset"".

Lately, I've been doing better with having it in the house by limiting my use to the weekends.  It does good things for me to a greater extent that way, but it is a challenge to adhere to the rule.  If it stops working, I'll stop again altogether for a while.

The key is to be self-aware about whether or not cannabis is serving your well-being, or when it's just making you unwell, and taking appropriate action.  

I hope that's helpful."

The fact that you're doing better after re-starting the med is a really positive indication that you have hope, and that's always a good thing to have!

If you really want to sort out if the med is effective yet given you've been taking it for two days, talk to your doc!  They'll be able to sort it out based on the med, the length of your holiday from it, and the rate that it becomes effective.

I hope the good changes continue!"

ForeverAlone,ffa1xm4,t1_ff9ztij,1579726246.0,"Thanks for clarifying.  I hear you, and appreciate your point.  And like I said, I appreciate your desire to deploy the term to convey the severity of the oppression of wage slavery.  The term contains a lot of power and is very impactful, and generally I think repurposing language and using it to purposes to fight oppression most definitely has its place.  I'm just uncomfortable with this particular case of doing that.

I mentioned ""contemporary"" slavery above specifically because estimates say there are 40 million people around the world who are enslaved today (the exact number depends on the definition of slavery), so it is not really just ""past generations"".  

While US slavery may be in the past as an institution, it's consequences have shaped the circumstances of many Americans until today, so it is not in the past in that sense, and many of those Americans feel pretty strongly about how that term is used and might feel that using it to describe wage labor diminishes the uniqueness of their experience, present and past.  Some African Americans may be okay with it, particular those in oppressive wage labor situations themselves.  (BTW, full disclosure, I'm white.)

I think it is somewhat similar when people redeploy the term holocaust instead of reserving it to refer to the Holocaust.  I'm not saying that as an answer to whether doing so is right or wrong - I think it depends on the situation, and I think many Jews (I'm not Jewish) would agree that it can be redeployed in contemporary situations.  I think people have made comparisons between the camps and the detention of immigrants on the southern border - there was a lot of controversy about that in the Jewish community, so no simple answer."

Work should be something to enjoy and that provides what we need to live happily.  And I can understand why you use the term ""slave"" to convey the intensity of discouragement and injustice that your work involves.

But I'd encourage you to use the term ""wage work"" rather than wage slavery.  The institution of chattel slavery in the US entailed unique horrors and degradations for enslaved people, and the comparison to wage work in its contemporary form just doesn't map.  Wage work is demoralizing and unjust but it doesn't compare accurately with most forms of slavery, especially to its history in the US, but also including contemporary and historical enslavement around the world."
NonBinary,ff9u9aa,t3_esgufl,1579721457.0,"Here’s how gender meaningful for me in a spiritual way.

If my perspective fits into an existing expression or term, I would love to learn about it.

I’m going to say “my God” below but by that I don’t mean to sound possessive/owning at all. It’s shorthand for “my experience of God”, avoiding the any notion that my truth is the ultimate truth…at all. I generally say “God” instead of what some people mean as “divine power” or “The Universe”- they are somewhat similar I think, depending, and for me “God” is a better shorthand.

TW: If you’ve been traumatized by institutional religion, this might not be something for you engage with, although it is not at all religious and entirely spiritual. Also, if you are a believing member of a traditional/organized religion, the ideas below you may find to be sacrilegious.

First, my God is non-binary. Their pronoun in language is in the “they” form, but they are beyond pronouns, because they are beyond language. Their true pronouns encompass all possible pronouns. Language can only reach toward their pronouns but never specify or say them. “God” as a name make is also just shorthand thing for communication sake - their name is also beyond language.

My God loves gender in every possible expression or experience of it, including traditional, binary forms, and including the form where gender is absent in someone’s identity. It’s a gift for us to express a core part of ourselves, to be creative with, to celebrate, to become more true to ourselves. Those who are expanding what gender is in the world are taking that gift and the highest possible expression by exploring, playing, expanding, sharing and diversifying it.

My God is not separate from from who and what we are. Our consciousness and bodies are a part of divine power, and not some separate thing. They love when we have new ideas, combine ideas, evolve ideas. They love when we are playful with our bodies (I’m thinking here in terms of body art, piercings and surgery, but also things like dance and song).  

They love when we harmlessly share our bodies with others.

I wrote more than I planned so I’ll stop. I want to find new ways to see all of this so would love to hear the thoughts and experiences, including having my idea challenged."

bipolar,ff9ftf7,t3_es76p2,1579712097.0,"I think when someone is newly diagnosed, or if they're a poor observer of their own mood cycles, it helps to have folks around them that are aware of their diagnosis and can raise red flags, only if truly appropriate and based on a real understanding of the disease.  A lot of folks to that with a half-assed understanding of bipolar in general, and my specific experience of bipolar in particular.

For those of us who have been coping with our disease for a while and have a strong handle on our patterns, triggers and signals, I think its useful and necessary to set strong boundaries with those who think they are authorized to interpret our behavior only in terms of our disease.  It may mean gently but firmly pointing out when people are doing that, and avoid being reactive about it.  It's going to be a lifelong and evolving practice of ""managing"" those around us, especially loved ones who really care.

It really sucks to be reduced to a diagnosis and to have our evolving sense of sense of self reduced to a set of symptoms.  My hypomanias are generally really good things, and it annoys the fuck out of me when my friends feel as though they need to interpret it as negative and remind of the risk of pathological directions mania can take, as if I don't know.

It sure makes me very cautious about who I share my diagnosis with.  For people I'm not comfortable with sharing the diagnosis, I'm working to develop alternative language to describe my mood cycles in a non-clinical way, so they can know this important part of me without just seeing it as mental illness."

To lose BOTH your parents at one time at age 14 is just such a huge thing.  You'll be working through the grief and implications for a long time - I think you know that.  

But reading your words, your humor and insight into yourself and your life, tells me that you're going to do the work of grieving fearlessly and in a way that will strengthen and deepen you as a person.  You're off to a great start acknowledging your mixed feelings about your parents as parents.  It is a hard thing to look directly at the real reality of our relationship with someone we've just lost.  

I think you should be in therapy with a specialist in grief, not because you are exhibiting any symptoms of a mental health issue, but because you can enlist their help in the grieving process.  Use them.

You are obviously very intelligent, so I would encourage you to also research as much as you can online and in books about the grieving process.  Everyone goes through loss, and good people have thought about their own experiences and have shared insights and practical advice on moving through grief.  Know everything you can.  

You are such a gift writer.  If you're not journaling already, please start.  Not only is the act/process of journaling healing and clarifying, it can act as a touchstone as time passes and things evolve for you.

bipolar2,ff95gqu,t1_ff8s3tc,1579705295.0,"I didn't do a therapy dog training program with my boy.  He already had basic obedience, and he was tested through a national certification program called Alliance for Therapy Dogs (there's another one out there but I forget the name of it offhand).  It's a pretty basic test where he goes into situations similar to where he'll be working, demonstrates obedience (sit, stay, lay down, come, heal) and is put in situations, such as encountering another dog and being around medical equipment (like a wheel chair) to see if he gets spooked.  Volunteer opportunities will require that you have some type of certification, and the key thing about that is that it gives you liability insurance, which the organization you're volunteering with needs.  If you have a specific volunteer opportunity in mind, ask them what certification/s they require.

I think the most important thing is that the dog have a disposition appropriate to the work, and that the handler have a really good, intuitive relationship with their partner animal.  For example, you should be able to tell if a certain situation is stressing your dog out.  Digit can only work for about 90 minutes before he starts clearly signaling that he's done working for the day - I can tell by his responsiveness to people, how he looks at me, the position of his tail and ears, etc.  The certifying organization requires the dog be one years old, and that you've had him for one year.

Our main gig is visiting pediatric oncology once a week, but we had to stop that temporarily because of flu season - I'm immunosuppressed because of a lung transplant and I can't risk exposing myself.  We've also volunteered through a hospice organization, and at the local VA, and I plan to pick this those up again after flu season.

depression,ff7rxu5,t1_ff7p8p2,1579656896.0,"A certain experience of mine I think relates a little bit, so I'll share it. 

About six years ago I came down with a life-threatening respiratory illness that progressed extremely quickly over the course of 1-2 years until I was left with only 14% lung function.  That meant 24/7 supplemental oxygen, and a stream of losses: had to stop my work, had to stop cooking, had to stop walking my dogs, couldn't shower on my own, etc., and ended up pretty much home bound.

I'm single so I was in quite a pickle.  But in a way that astonished me, my friends stepped up, even ones who were really just casual friends, and provided me with loving support in a variety of ways.  It was so wonderful, but I have to say at first it was extremely difficult to receive support from them.  I've been a very independent, mostly single, strong, capable person my whole adult life.  And given the realities of my disability, there was simply not way for me to reciprocate in any meaningful sense, except being open-hearted with my gratitude.  I had to just receive and receive and receive, without much giving back.  It was a big spiritual lesson to learn how to do that, to be vulnerable and in need in that way.  I value that lesson so much because I will, of course, someday be in that situation again, as we all will, when we become elderly and when we're dying.  One of the most important aspects of the lesson was really coming to believe that people not only want to help sincerely, but that helping lifts them up.  Allowing someone to help you is a gift you give to them.  I do some service work these days and though I'm giving, I also receive so much in the very act of giving.  It is not draining, it is energizing.

Now I realize, you're in a pretty damn intense situation and maybe my thoughts and experience don't really map over to where you are.  No doubt, letting her in you would be asking a whole lot from her.  I understand your resistance to it, I think, a little bit.  But like you said, she has a lot of strength, and probably more endurance and resiliency than even she knows.

I have reclusive tendencies, and having to walk my dogs gets me out of the house, usually twice a day.  That means sunshine, fresh air, running into neighbors and getting exercise, which is so important because I tend to do no other exercise when depressed.  

Also, I moved to a new city about three years ago and having the company of dogs has helped me deal with being alone a lot.

Google ""therapy dogs"" to get some good information on the ways that just being in the presence of a dog, and petting them, really helps with stress relief, anxiety and overall well-being.  (One of my dogs is a therapy dog and we go to the local hospital to visit sick kids.  I continue doing that in the depths of my depression and it helped me so much to serve other people with my sweet pup Digit). 

If you get a younger dog, they'll play with you, and that can be loads of fun.

I became seriously suicidal but simply would not abandon my dogs that way.  When I rescued them I made a commitment to take care of them for the rest of their lives.  To me, that was a solemn thing.  So, they saved me.

Caring for another being shifts the focus off yourself a bit, and it's very gratifying to be taking care of someone in spite of your depression.

People say ""dogs give love unconditionally"", and I think that's true, but for me the more important thing is that dogs receive love unconditionally.  Loving on my dogs makes me feel better.

It's fun to get a puppy but that can be very challenging.  If you're getting a rescue, maybe a middle aged dog that has a good disposition and is house-trained is probably the best choice.  It's always a good idea to foster the dog first because mentally it puts less pressure on adopting that specific dog - you can test it out to see if it's a good match.  Do not keep a dog if after a week or two your intuition is telling it's not a good fit.  It's better for you, and it's better to be homed into a situation where they'll thrive.

In your situation, you need a dog that's not going to be challenging to handle or form a strong relationship with.  Be honest about your situation with the shelter and emphasize you need a dog who will work for you right off the bat.  I recommend getting a small or medium-sized dog, not a large dog.  You may be able to bring a small dog into more situations more easily - it may also be easier for someone else to care for the dog if you're temporarily unable to.  

Of course, a lot of that advice doesn't so much apply if you're getting a professionally-trained emotional support animal.  I guess whether you do that  depends on affordability and if you have objectives with the dog that require that kind of training.  That's obviously a more reliable and less complicated approach.  I don't have much knowledge or experience regarding that.
