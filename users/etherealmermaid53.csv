muacirclejerk,ff5qchf,t3_erk0x3,1579605925.0,i identify with this strongly as this is something i’d do in a possible manic/depressive episode
BeautyGuruChatter,ff2wjov,t1_ff2c2be,1579526831.0,"Yeah the only one I actually used was for Kehlani so I’m kinda sad I got duped into it because I really love her. 

Although I do appreciate the fan interaction it reminds me of how in the late 2000s/early 2010s celebrities would say “call me on this number!” and it was just a pre recorded message of “thanks for being a fan :)” and that’s it. [This brought back a memory of 10 year old me frantically googling “Demi Lovato phone number”, “Jonas Brothers phone number”, and so on and all calling them lmfao. There were some Yahoo answers asking for their numbers and people replied with the fan numbers, and vividly remembering probably 12 year old girls saying “yeah it’s their real number!! i talked to them!!1!” If you know the song Kiss Me Thru the Phone by Soulja Boy, My Girl by Mindless Behavior, and another song I think by Mike Jones idk, all those songs that mention a number were fan numbers with prerecorded messages.] /end useless trivia lmfao

Also I love your flair haha."
college,ff2imx3,t3_er72ir,1579507795.0,Yup. It wasn’t worth all the mental anguish for me so I just dropped out. I thought college was supposed to be a happy and fun time while although challenging it leads to new experiences and growing older. It’s weird how a lot of people are just fucking depressed but hide it well for the sake of others.
NightmareExpo,fey8xjt,t3_dqzk9q,1579442277.0,"Aw if this is a scam I feel kinda bad, I just subbed with my Prime because I thought it was real and I have anxiety too. Oof, oh well it's just a month."
UnresolvedMysteries,fet5a6a,t1_fepiif4,1579371935.0,It’s Northern VA. Nobody carries guns around here. You’d have to go further South.
BeautyGuruChatter,ferfn02,t1_feoxj3i,1579353338.0,I think it’s more for middle/high schoolers in my opinion. Just like VSCO girls are.
BeautyGuruChatter,feoszw6,t1_feorri7,1579304965.0,"I think I’m projecting an idea so I apologize for my earlier comment. I was talking out of my ass I guess.

My train of thought is that growing up in the Bay Area you have to put this facade of being tough and headstrong and stubborn. Of course not all people go through the same experiences I was just basing my idea on friends I’ve had that grew up in the hood who act in similar ways sometimes. 

But like I said I’m probably projecting lol, it makes sense in my head and I feel I should have kept that thought there."
BeautyGuruChatter,feocomg,t3_eq1pyw,1579298219.0,Maybe I’m weird but I feel people forget Alissa is from Oakland and to me it explains her actions and words sometimes. Not saying I agree with it but I understand. To me it gives her more authenticity but I know this is a very unpopular opinion. Just my couple of pennies.
UnresolvedMysteries,fenfoaj,t3_eq36gt,1579283680.0,"I’m from here. My heart literally stopped when I saw Springfield, VA. I was 6 when this happened so obviously I can’t help but I hope their killers are found soon. Stuff like this worries me."

muacjdiscussion,fe6pb8d,t1_fe6hlil,1578899167.0,I was very surprised at how quick they took Smoke Show off the website. It came out only two months ago I believe. It seems kind of wasteful and just weird for their releases to keep disappearing so quickly after. This whole limited edition thing is very annoying.
muacjdiscussion,fe6p852,t3_enyuh5,1578899061.0,[Here](https://www.bustle.com/p/colourpop-x-becky-gs-hola-chola-collection-is-inspired-by-the-singers-mexican-heritage-19449088) Bustle said that once the line sells out it’s gone for good.
travel,fe08pef,t1_fe08jev,1578806138.0,"It’s a weird situation because I didn’t save the money, it’s still a weird thing I don’t understand that my narcissistic dad did with social security and I somehow got money idk. I used half of it for tuition but since I dropped out I don’t really find any need for it."
travel,fe08m2t,t1_fdxwg1u,1578806053.0,Thank you so much!
travel,fdxteo2,t1_fdxsceg,1578772726.0,She’ll try to talk me out of it and tell me I need to save money but it’s something I’d really like to do for her. I think having her input would work and I’m bad at surprises haha. Thank you! I only mention her age because of health problems and making sure it doesn’t interfere with her travel and ability to enjoy the trip.

college,fdegsdl,t1_fddmriq,1578338694.0,I hope you're able to take a break because you deserve it! College is a lot of hard work and very taxing. I'd love to talk to you privately if that's okay because it's nice to have someone that feels the same way.
college,fdegots,t1_fddozng,1578338633.0,"Thank you so much and I'm glad your friend is doing well! That's the plan I hope to do, I've had some friends from high school do the same."
college,fdegmvr,t1_fddy527,1578338601.0,"Many professors suggested I take a break and at first I was offended but I realized that I'd rather be happy and be able to work harder on my grades when I'm actually in a good place mentally and emotionally. I also had a fear on not finishing school ""on time"" but that fear has dissipated. I want to go on vacation so badly too! Where did you go if you don't mind me asking and how did planning go and how did you manage the cost?"
college,fdegg0w,t1_fddjawx,1578338484.0,"I'm not sure how long I'll be out of a four year university but I plan to finish my basic coursework at a local community college either this summer semester or the fall semester. It may be too late for me to register for this winter semester but I don't mind because I think a break from schooling would be fine.

I plan to work and relax and do things I enjoy doing things that I didn't have enough time for (without feeling guilty of doing during school) such as reading, writing, watching films, etc. as it has to do with what I want to do as a career path. 

I'm thankfully blessed to have a parent that is very supportive and kind and who actually influenced me to drop out as they saw my unhappiness and wanted better for me. I want to work and pay them back because they've done so so so much for me and they're still willing to go above and beyond for me to make sure that I'm okay."
swatchitforme,fd731vd,t1_fd6h2f5,1578198812.0,"Yes haha I’ve noticed that too that they’ll take some time to announce colors on their social media. I also love your IG btw, I check it almost daily and I appreciate your reviews and looks."
swatchitforme,fd6d88f,t3_ek3jcd,1578189188.0,"I agree with u/qaganoficeandfire. I’ve been lusting after the Juicy Olive palette for months because I love the GMG singles I have. I believe I have 8 in total and I totally agree with the pigmentation. I wanted some pigmented color because the colorful palette I have is an old BH Cosmetics one. They don’t have a full rainbow of mattes I believe but the orange (Orange Soda Pop) and Sashay (it’s either Sashay or Sky High) and the hot pink (Bubblegum or Dream House) are insanely pigmented and the formula is fantastic. I also use Creamsicle as a highlight because of the peachy color it has which I love. It’s similar to Colourpop’s Ready or Yacht but Creamsicle is more yellow toned.

Sorry for the word vomit I just love the formula of GMG. You really only need a small amount of product and the pans are huge. I sometimes use the colors I have for blush. The only time I’ve been disappointed by them is the color of Wink. I’d rather it be a lighter periwinkle because on the eye it can be dark, I wanted it to be more pastel and because of GMG’s pigment, no matter how much I mix a white with Wink it doesn’t get much lighter. 

I keep checking their website to see if they’ve expanded their colors lol."
thesims,fcrytqz,t1_fcrn1pm,1577908566.0,Thank you so much for the detailed response!! I will definitely try that and focus on less Sims to help them do well.
thesims,fcq1v8p,t1_fcozf7l,1577876931.0,Yeah I did that with most of them and the ones that had excellent/normal quality presentations still did bad. I think focusing on one or two Sims would be better and I’ll start a new save file to get more of this pack.
thesims,fcq1rcf,t1_fcpyibc,1577876865.0,I guess I should have done that for more Sims more and focus on one or two instead of four lol. I might just scrap this save and start over. Thank you!

muacjdiscussion,fchnuwp,t1_fcbj1gi,1577652198.0,A lot of the mini Zodiac palettes looked ashy and just cheap looking in general. I know when each one released many people were let down in trendmood’s comments. Also the “sequels” to the zodiac palette aren’t as cohesive to me as the original is.

Also Tiny Pretty Things is another drama. But I have yet to read as well."
ifyoulikeblank,fc6bw8g,t3_efyifp,1577476964.0,"Teen drama for books is kind of a broad subject but two YA “teen dramas” I enjoyed this last summer are [p.s. I enjoy YA books that actually sound like a teenager’s life, from the way they speak and act since I’m a teen too]:

Girl Mans Up by M.E. Girard. It’s about a girl named Penelope, goes by Pen who lives in a small town outside of Toronto and is coming to terms with her sexuality and how she presents her gender identity. Really enjoyed it.

The DUFF by Kody Keplinger. It was a movie but I personally like the book better but the movie is not bad by all means. It’s one of those romances with the unpopular girl and the popular guy but it’s a bit different and more likable. It was written by a high schooler I believe? Or she was in her early college years I forget.

If you like teen thrillers/mysteries [with catty girl drama of course]:

Dangerous Girls by Abigail Haas. Kind of like the Natalee Holloway case but different. It’s pretty good but I haven’t read it in a couple years so I forgot the main plot except for some tidbits.

Dare Me by Megan Abbott. Weird book about cheerleaders.


Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is on my to read list so I apologize if these suggestions aren’t the best!! r/suggestmeabook might help more. I’m not a big fan of John Greene-esque books so that might influence my reading choices and enjoyability. :)

EDIT: Also maybe Every Day by David Levithan but I don’t know I haven’t read it."

I’d say a good reference is soul/dance music in the late 60s to late 70s. :) Artists like the ones mentioned above. Spotify probably has some playlists to help you get the vibe. I’ll name some playlists for you.
