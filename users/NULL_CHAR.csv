I fell in love with the Mk5 GTI, the Mk6 looked great, and the Mk7 improved upon the Mk6. This just looks like a step backwards. The GTI was already a very under-stated hot-hatch having a very mature design with subtle hints that it was a fun car. This Mk8 design just makes it blend in with the boring econo-cars.

This is not the GTI design I fell in love with... At least the TCR looks kinda interesting although the Lambo-style front does not fit too well in my opinion. We had better get the TCR in the US..."
pcgaming,ffakvkq,t1_ff9vf0p,1579738292.0,"No, I'm fairly sure the person claiming optimization has no bearing on performance is the person who has no clue what they are talking about.

ARMA is terribly optimized and yet I can still play ARMA 3 easily on my PC. What does that tell you about the new call of duty?  The new call of duty is far beyond unoptimized. It's literally a dumpster fire in that regard. There's no fancy physics or simulation being done. The bullets aren't doing any crazy calculations. There's no AI. You can turn off all the CPU heavy graphical settings making it look like Modern Warfare 3. And it still chews through a 4Ghz quad core like nothing. 

It's widely regarded that it's poorly optimized. It ran fine during the beta and early release, then they put in a patch and everyone reported how badly it started performing on PC. I'm not sure why you would even challenge that notion. 

Also, for the second half of your comment, you literally seem to be agreeing with me. Not sure if that's like a language gap or something but you're definitely using the wrong words if you're trying to argue against my point. But regardless, Overwatch has more going on at any given point than Call of Duty in regards to CPU oriented tasks."

pcgaming,ff9mt4u,t1_ff98uql,1579716283.0,"There's no problems with 4-cores, it's all how they optimize the game. 4 cores at 4GHz each has more processing power than 6-cores at 1.7Ghz each (which is what the consoles are clocked at). The problem is that the 4-cores aren't being utilized properly. Game makers are optimizing heavily to utilize the poor single-core performance of the new consoles but they aren't putting that same level of rigor in changing that mentality for the most common Gaming PC CPUs."
pcgaming,ff9ml6o,t1_ff9dbg0,1579716153.0,"It has everything to do with optimization. I'm not sure how you can even make that claim when there are games with far more physics from 10 years ago that run fine on even a 2-core processor. Optimization means everything. 

Look at ARMA 3 for example. The amount of physics calculations in that game makes Battlefield 5 look like a joke. Every single bullet fired does trajectory shaping, impact analysis, ricochet calculations, penetration calculations (every caliber of bullet has different penetration levels into different materials), wind calculations, and constant force calculation updates. And that's just the bullets! ARMA 3 released almost a decade ago and runs fine on an i5.

Overwatch actually has a ton of physics calculations going on all the time. Every single soft-body is actually undergoing constant physics calculations. If you shoot a flag, watch as it interacts with your shot. You get knocked around, watch as parts of your model interact with the force being exerted. A lot of the newer games downplay these small interactions in favor of more obvious physics calculations. 

Overwatch has far more going on with physics than the new Call of Duty, not to mention all of the other interactions involved with various different projectiles and abilities.. You honestly have no clue what you're talking about."
pcgaming,ff9ljf4,t1_ff9e4di,1579715533.0,"You don't understand what simple graphics are. Overwatch has a cartoony art style, but from a graphical rigor point of view, it's far above anything in the new Call of Duty. If you look closely at models, physics, interactions, etc, Overwatch is actually very complex. Blizzard is King at optimization and they always have been. Diablo 3 still holds up to this day and runs very smoothly even while you kill hundreds of enemies in a second with every single body on screen calculating physics."
pcgaming,ff99nbl,t1_ff94q9m,1579708018.0,It's terrible optimization. I can run games with far better graphics and many more complex processing interactions when they are optimized properly. For example  overwatch at 2k/144hz.

pcgaming,ff8zmlo,t1_ff8seak,1579701032.0,I'm terrified. Console developers have already optimized games for the 8 core low GHz spectrum.

I then sent it in three times for that issue (they kept returning it without fixing the problem) and eventually it was fixed. After a year, it had the same problem again and now out of warranty. 

Something I did see recently is a poll on Reddit found that ~40% of Neato owners have their robot fail within 1 year. So I guess it all comes down to chance. Except most people are likely able to get their robot properly repaired. I spent more time dealing with mine than the time it would have taken me to just vacuum my floors myself.

WhitePeopleTwitter,felf3nl,t1_feko9s2,1579220685.0,"First off, you've only decided on minimum wage as your target. The original post is referencing much more than a small and gradual cost of living adjustment to the minimum wage which is what the economists you point at are in support of. It's talking about raising the minimum wage beyond the intent of it, being the ability to support a single person. 

The original post also mentioned things like universal healthcare without addressing the cost of care problem in the US as well as ""free college.""

You haven't backed your statement with facts you have moved the goal posts. We were addressing the whole package in this tweet and instead you point at be a handful of economists who are in support of a gradual adjustment of the minimum wage over 5+ years in regards to the changes in cost of living. You're failing to address everything else in the package.

Also, pointing ""experts"" opinion without arguing a point is known as an appeal to authority fallacy.


-----------

Second, small apartments in most of Seattle showcase incredible rent costs. Yes I am referring to roommates here. The difference in Seattle is that even the relatively wealthy need to have roommates to afford to live there and good luck ever affording a house. Last time I was up there it was over $2 million dollars for a house smaller than the one I'm currently living in which I bought for less than $200k.

The changes in Seattle are in response to the insane levels of the cost of living. And yes, you are correct, you see the same thing in SanFran and NYC.

Even if you ""have friends who live in rural towns"" (and geez, doesn't that sound like a hilarious statement) you obviously underestimate how much a cost of living difference there is. For most places, they would need to make double to triple what they do currently in order to have an equivalent life in Seattle. That is a huge factor when discussing economic policy and the effects of it on people. That's why you're ignorant of anywhere outside Seattle. You see stuff like that as trivial.

And I'm a computer scientist with a minor in economics and a minor in philosophy. So what?

Also, you can call bullshit all day. But yet again, you have made a critical logical error. I've not argued against any of these points. I've mearly offered a point that these policies do in fact come with downsides for many people (especially the middle class), something that should never be ignored. I'm personally I'm favor of universal healthcare and a minimum wage hike. 

But I'm also a realist. I understand that if we were to implement things like a universal healthcare plan that we'd need to address the extraordinary cost of care in the US, otherwise we're still going to have a terrible system. I also understand that making too large and sudden of a change to the minimum wage has adverse effects on people who have worked hard to obtain a skilled labor position. I'm not saying we shouldn't increase the minimum wage, but that there should also be a plan in place for how to ensure that people who invested in themselves do not lose that investment.

My concern is people rallying behind these causes without concern for the problems. Also people who lie about that issues promising ""free everything."" Everything has a cost and it's up to us to determine if it's worth it. Spreading misinformation is not doing anyone favors."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fekiusw,t1_fekdhsu,1579200960.0,"Yet again, like everyone, you misrepresent this post. This person is discussing much more than the minimum wage increase and yet that's the only part you talk about.

You keep changing the rules and moving the goal posts. Figure out what your argument is before you present it.

Also, living anywhere near Seattle requires a large amount of money. People are already having to bunk with several others to just afford an apartment. What I'm referring to already happened in Seattle before the minimum wage hike. And the minimum wage hike there is in response to the issue. But you like many other people from that area fail to grasp how much different life is outside a major expensive costal City.

PS, I have a minor in economics and am leftist in practically everything economic related, support minimum wage hike and universal healthcare. You have no clue what you're talking about. I just like to present people with realistic downsides rather than lie to their face"

They make a lot of money by investing in companies and the champion measures to increase their investment which usually means employees take the hit so that the company stock can give these people a return on their investment.

If both lower and middle class were able to see a jump, then we'd be great. But even then, we have the problem of companies just adjusting prices to the new levels. But there always has to be an incentive for people to gun for better jobs.

Either that, or the people who worked to get better paying positions now see their efforts diminished as they will likely not receive a similar bump in pay, which actually decreases their purchasing power because of the ""new floor"" (aka inflation), not to mention they also see their taxes increase to pay for all of it.

interestingasfuck,fe6e7ut,t1_fe6blt9,1578888295.0,"I agree really. Pitbulls are completely capable of being fine, loving dogs. It's just the breed in general requires much more responsibility and care than what most people are willing/able to give.

They are extremely common in animal shelters, and a lot of people just adopt or buy them without any research on their needs and the concerns about raising them. They are high energy, they need to be entertained, and like most terriers, they have a strong prey drive. Couple this with the fact that they were literally bred to be fighting dogs and you have a breed that can definitely be a bit dangerous.

This does not mean all pitbulls are dangerous, but just that people should definitely exercise caution around an unknown pitbull. It's not irrational for people to be wary around them. And you probably shouldn't leave them alone with babies, although you really shouldn't do that for any large dog. They are animals and sometimes things happen."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fe6cie3,t1_fe6a13t,1578886959.0,"That's an often repeated mentality that is fairly aggravating to see. First off, how many police officers work alone? In my state, it's unusual for there to be more than one officer per car. How often are bad police officers showcasing bad behavior in front of other officers. How many times is the displayed behavior actually something that an officer should go and follow up on? (I.e. is the officer swearing at someone or are they actually being abusive?) How many officers actually are reported for their behavior by another officer. 

Where are all these statistics? It's hard to find them because it's not actually accounted for. That statement is using an argument backed by little to no data to prop up a claim that can't really be argued against because yet again there is little to no data.

I'm sorry, but I often see that mentality not as an honest critique of officers, but moreso a justification as for why someone *wants* to hate all police officers.

Either way, people randomly harassing police officers and lying about misconduct to abuse the recent societal issues is a terrible mentality to have and it does nothing but destroy credibility and cause further problems. In general, if you make being a police officer an unfavorable profession full of hatred and harassment, you're not going to get better police officers, you're going to get people who don't care what anyone thinks about them, or worse, people who enjoy the spite."
interestingasfuck,fe66qfn,t1_fe60azs,1578883033.0,"Statistics really don't lie. Pitbulls are responsible for 80% of fatal dog attacks on humans and depending on study, typically over 70% of dog bites requiring medical care. They are also typically seen as the cause of over 95% of fatal dog attacks on other animals.

There are other big dogs with irresponsible owners such as Rottweilers, Dobermans, German Shepherds, etc, but they don't have anywhere near the prevalence in the data. 

Anecdotal evidence doesn't save you from the data.

I myself have one of the mildest terrier breeds out there and I still paid extra attention to ensure no aggressive behavior to smaller dogs/animals. People who live in denial of the responsibility they incur by choosing these kinds of dogs are a major problem. Pits are terriers bred for aggression and fighting, do not take them lightly."

Pitbulls are a bit different from other dogs in that you need to be even more responsible to ensure they behave. A lot of people aren't up for that task and don't know it.

Even then, there are many stories out there of Pitbulls being loving and sweet for many years and then suddenly they attack a small child or other dog.

They are just a more dangerous breed than others and honestly, we should be attempting to either stop breeding them, or attempt to change their characteristics."

While it may play a factor, I think it's much more important for the parents to instill concepts such as discipline, good work ethic, and caring for other people.

I personally went to a private high school and noticed that much of the students there were as bad if not worse than public schools. A lot of them (not essentially the majority but a significant chunk) had been given everything they've ever wanted and had no respect for other people. They never seemed to believe that they had to work for things in life. They harassed the teachers and other students all the time, and treated everything like one big joke.

When we actually graduated, about 70% went to college. Within 1 year mostly everyone had dropped out with about 20% remaining. High school, you could skate by with minimal effort and still get Bs. College slams you hard if you don't actually study and try."

summonerswar,fdo86na,t1_fdnzd1h,1578600569.0,"First, mobile games aren't inherently MMO games. It's not good to compare an MMO to a once-and-done game I'll give you that. But most major PC games are MMO nowadays too. Even then, the big single-player ones like GTAV have cost over a billion dollars to develop. That's much more than has been spent on Summoners War.

Second, The initial development of the server architecture is included in the initial development cost of the game. Further upgrades to the development of the architecture is handled on an as-needed basis and funded through the players causing the problem.

Third, Even then, server resources actually aren't too bad for Com2Us.

Com2Us syncs at the start of a dungeon run and at the end of a dungeon run. You don't need anything between then. You can actually disconnect in between dungeon runs to prove this.

Other than that, you need client requests for rune and monster information, but even then, much of that is likely cached locally and only verified on actions (such as upgrading/changing a rune). Overall, you're limited to about 750 monsters and a few thousand runes in total. Maybe a couple of megabytes of storage per heavy user.

And actually, the concurrent players for Summoners War actually isn't that much. There are millions of accounts sure, but concurrently playing is likely in the upper tens of thousands judging by various statistics and community event progress. 

Compare this to games like Hearthstone, or World of Warcraft, or Path of Exile, or Overwatch, or etc. In these games, every single action is verified by the server. Majority of positional changes, actions committed, all of this at a much higher pace than Summoners War. Your average FPS is calculating trajectories, positions, and events for many tens of thousands of players at 30 to 60 updates per second. (30 and 60 tick servers)

If you want to see some crazy server architecture, look at how Path of Exile does it. They often times have 100,000 concurrent players, killing tens of mobs per second per person (keeping in mind all damage calculations, model positioning, etc), dropping thousands of pieces of loot, making trades, putting stuff in banks, and much more. All of that is verified by the server. Path of Exile is a F2P game without any Pay-to-Win purchases."

* Graphics are pitiful compared to something like Witcher 3 there's no dynamic calculations, everything is hard-coded from lighting to particle effects. 
* There's no need for an advanced game engine. This is largely home-grown.
* Physics calculations are replaced with hard-coded animations. 
* Limited actual in game content. You basically have 2 zones in the game, the island view, and the dungeon, and they just replace models to make it seem like you're doing different things.
* Simplistic combat system, it's just a turn-based dice-roll like the old JRPGs which only used that methodology because it was easy to develop. It's extraordinarily easy to expand this methodology to new content as well.

The development costs on this game are miniscule compared to something like Witcher 3 or Destiny. You can bet the big-time developers are drooling over the profit margin here.

Even Hearthstone likely has a higher development cost. Having actual dynamic graphics, physics engines, and more complicated event based systems. Not to mention far more cards to balance around.
