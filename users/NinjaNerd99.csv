todayilearned,ffad90h,t1_ffa9e36,1579732815.0,"> The Allies moved to 'terror bombing' (a subjective term but I can live with it to a degree) purely as precision bombing proved impossible and targeting alleged choke points didn't produce results. 

Incorrect. Bomber advocates had long advocated for general terror bombing as a way to break the morale of the foe's public and win the war. This was attempted after it was realized that precision bombing was largely proving ineffective, especially after German war industries were decentralized due to the bomber raids.  


Ironically Nuclear weapons made the dreams of the bomber advocates a reality due to the shock effect of the weapons.  In war there's 2 sorts of morale weakling events: One is massive losses of casualties/destruction over time the second is a massive loss of lives/stuff in a very sort period. The second it more likely to result in a loss of morale even if the total killed was far less than the effects of the first.  The bomber advocates were wrong because they didn't have the sort of shock weapon necessary to achieve their goals.

>but it didn't mean the RAF was content to simply kill civilians

They were indeed content with it. You need to read some books written by people from the era.  They're quite open about what they're goals were.  Every bomber advocate believed that terror bombing would win the war and they attempted it. They justified it because it would shorten the war. It failed because heavy bombing doesn't have the sort of shock effect that nuclear weapons have.

>The key to the success of the transport attacks from 44 was the sheer number of planes and the proximity of bases, as well as Germany depending more on transport because she had decentralised her production... due to bombing.

Germany had always done decentralized production to some degree based on economic efficiencies, particularly in the movement of raw materials, but you are correct that that when they rebuilt their industries it was mostly farther east out of bomber range increasing the productivity of hitting the transport grid. However, it was the lack of raw materials reaching the Ruhr Valley that caused the complete collapse of the German war economy, something that could have been cut off at any time in 1943 and 1944. 

>You are thus certainly correct that bombing did not achieve the most optimistic promises of its advocates. But between 1940 and June 1944, it was the only possibility to inflict severe harm on Germany from Britain.

It was the smart move to do. However, the attempts to terror bomb and to continue it hit industrialize targets after the easy targets were taken out wasn't nearly as productive as a generalized campaign of destroying the transport grid was.  Factories can be hidden and decentralized, but rail lines cannot.  Nor does it take a lot of planes to hit random sections of track day after day, since the defenses of a given section of railroad track is most likely non existent.


>Bombing did not cripple Germany's resolve to fight on. But it did undermine the credibility of the regime. It changed the political culture in Axis countries, their attitudes to nationalism, militarism, their sense of racial superiority. The stark destruction left no doubt as to who 'won' the war. There was no 'stab in the back' theories being put forward by German militarists in 1945. Ditto, Japan. Certainly you are right, but it was the memory of bombing, it was the result after it stopped that is forgotten.

I don't see how any of the evidence supports this.  Let me take it apart bit by bit.

>But it did undermine the credibility of the regime. 

The Germans fought for far longer and much harder in 1944 and 1945 than they did in 1918.  German propaganda used the bombings as a way to inspire people to fight on.  The Nazi and Japanese states showed no signs of political collapse prior to surrender.

>The stark destruction left no doubt as to who 'won' the war. 

You're attributing that to the air campaign without evidence.  What I see looking at Japan and Germany is nations who were forcibly occupied by foreign troops, their women raped or sleeping with their foes, their property stolen, and their people humiliated and forced to do slave labor.  That's why there wasn't any sort of stab in the back theories or a feeling that they hadn't lost. They suffered the normal results of losing the war, something that didn't happen in 1918.  But again, that required boots on the ground to achieve, not blowing cities to dust.

>That's my position and I can't really prove that conclusion. But I don't think it can be disproven either.

Why didn't the terror bombing of the UK produce the effect you believed happened to the Germans and the Japanese?  The bombings of London increased civilian and military resolve, the opposite of what you're claiming should have happened."

My source on the issue is Robert McNamara who was doing statistical analysis for the allied bombing campaign during WW2.  The Germans were rebuilding industrial capacity faster than the allies were destroying it.  Which is why the allies switched to terror bombing and then finally transportation grid bombing.


>The collapse in Germany was a complete one: focusing on transportation or oil in 1942 would not have worked, it could in the last year of the war as overall exhaustion made choke points vulnerable. Also, the means available to the USAAF and RAF then was far greater. No bombing in 1941 to 44 would have seen vast numbers of tanks and planes, and well trained crews, available to Germany in Normandy and to delay the USSR in Poland.

Early UK Night bombing was highly ineffective.  The effective Bombing campaign against Germany only got fully underway 1943.  And bombing the transportation grid would have been just as effective then as it was in 1945.  It's impossible hard to defend every mile of train track, every foot of river barge canals.  

You're correct that Germany defending against the bombing raids was enormously draining on their war effort, in particular their stock of fighters and the eastern armies were basically striped of 88mil anti-aircraft guns to defend German cities.  But that's a far cry from collapsing the German economy as the allies and air power advocates intended. 

>My specific (and separate) point was that the big difference between 1919, from which fascism and militarism returned, and 1945, was the wholesale destruction of German cities and the exposure of the German leadership and war machine as unable to defend the homeland. While not quantifyable, that was what destroyed the credibility of German militarism once and for all. 

Your analysis is at odds with the results of other terror bombing campaigns.  Terror bombing strengthened the resolve to fight in Spain, the UK, Japan and Germany.  It was the occupation and re-education campaigns that resulted in a shift in German attitudes.  Though I note that Germany remained highly militarized in the post war period as both super powers armed a divided Germany for war with each other."

In the United States, Hull argued that nothing would be left to Germany but land, and only 60% of the Germans could live off the land, meaning 40% of the population would die.[19] Stimson expressed his opposition even more forcefully to Roosevelt. According to Stimson, the President said that he just wanted to help Britain get a share of the Ruhr and denied that he intended to fully deindustrialize Germany. Stimson replied, ""Mr. President, I don't like you to dissemble to me"" and read back to Roosevelt what he had signed. Struck by this, Roosevelt said he had ""no idea how he could have initialed this"".[20] The theory that Roosevelt was not truly rejecting the plan is supported by Eleanor Roosevelt, who stated that she never heard him disagree with the basics of the plan, and who believed that ""the repercussions brought about by the press stories made him feel that it was wise to abandon any final solution at that time"", but other sources suggest that Roosevelt ""had not realized the devastating nature of the program he had initialed"".[21]"

>Estimates of the death toll, including civilians and Red Guards, vary greatly, ranging from hundreds of thousands to 20 million.[1][2][3][4][5][6] They range upwards to several million, but an estimate of around 400,000 deaths is a widely accepted minimum figure, according to Maurice Meisner.[170] MacFarquhar and Schoenhals assert that in rural China alone some 36 million people were persecuted, of whom between 750,000 and 1.5 million were killed, with roughly the same number permanently injured.[171] In Mao: The Unknown Story, Jung Chang and Jon Halliday claim that as many as 3 million people died in the violence of the Cultural Revolution.[172] The Holocaust memorial museum puts the death toll between 5 and 10 million.[173] The exact figure of those who were persecuted or died during the Cultural Revolution, however, may never be known, since many deaths went unreported or were actively covered up by the police or local authorities. The state of Chinese demographics records was also deplorable at the time, and the PRC has been hesitant to allow formal research into the period.[174]


>The Cultural Revolution wreaked much havoc on minority cultures and ethnicities in China. In Inner Mongolia, some 790,000 people were persecuted during the Inner Mongolia incident. Of these, 22,900 were beaten to death, and 120,000 were maimed,[175] during a witch hunt to find members of the alleged separatist New Inner Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party. In Xinjiang, copies of the Qur'an and other books of the Uyghur people were apparently burned. Muslim imams reportedly were paraded around with paint splashed on their bodies. In the ethnic Korean areas of northeast China, language schools were destroyed. In Yunnan Province, the palace of the Dai people's king was torched, and a massacre of Muslim Hui people at the hands of the People's Liberation Army in Yunnan, known as the Shadian incident, reportedly claimed over 1,600 lives in 1975.[176] After the Cultural Revolution was over, the government gave reparations for the Shadian Incident, including the erection of a Martyr's Memorial in Shadian.[177]

>Harry Wu has written books, including Troublemaker and Laogai, that describe the system from the 19(?)0s to the 1990s. Wu spent 19 years, from 1960 to 1979, as a prisoner in these camps, for having criticized the government while he was a young college student.[17] After almost starving to death in the camps, he eventually moved to the United States as a visiting scholar in 1985."

He'd been treated multiple times for it but it finally killed him quite suddenly. My point was that he wasn't bad with relationships, his new girl friend was proof of that.

>Many couples go through struggles and couple counseling with a good Christian therapist can help marriages.

I've yet to see any statistical evidence that's not family counseling funded that shows that and I've observed many cases where it had the opposite effect.  

>You want what? That there's NO counseling, communication or understanding...so that what?

My mother almost divorced my father when I was around 10.  They fought and argued all the time and my father spent increasingly large periods of time away from the family working because of it.

The thing that saved marriage was simple:  She made a conscious decision to put him in charge in all things, as God commands.  The fighting stopped and they've got one of the best marriages I've ever seen.

>23 The husband is the head of the wife, just as Christ is the head of the church people. The church is his body and he saved it.

>24 Wives should obey their husbands in everything, just as the church people obey Christ.

A former of boss of mine (among others) went through the marriage counseling process.  The net result was his wife banging her new boyfriend in his bed and treating him like shit because all the problems in the marriage was his fault. This was after 20 years of marriage and 2 kids.

The sad thing was their marriage problem was simple: She'd gotten a promotion above him at work(they both worked for the same company) and was no longer longer attracted to him because of it(a common issue).  He was devastated, but within a few months of getting divorced he got his shit together found a younger better looking girl friend and was doing well for himself."

Not really.  Turkey was on standardized European rail gauge, something Russia were not.  German Units were never effective longer than 100km from a rail head in Russia and it was taking forever for German engineers forever to switch the rails over to European rail gauge. Nor were the Turks in any way armed and equipped to fight against combined arms warfare.

Germany was bogging down in North African because: A) Lack of Shipping making it through due to the UK breaking the Italian naval codes and sinking almost every supply ship and B) there was no rail network in North Africa to ship supplies from the ports to the front.  Neither of which would be a problem in Turkey with it's railroad network."
