insaneparents,fezed1u,t1_f18itgi,1579456492.0,"Most millenials have boomer parents. My dad is gen x, but barely, and he had me pretty young (he's 51, I'm 31, it's a little uncommon to have a parent that age at my age but not super unusual). So a lot of us do have boomer parents, but younger people likely do not."
fatlogic,fesia5y,t1_fesh6sp,1579365436.0,"3 comments? Jesus I struck a nerve. Threads in this sub frequently have a theme of hating fat people, period. It usually isn't direct, and mods don't do anything. Yeah, this sub may have a lot of prior fat people who have a lot of self-loathing still. That's unfortunate. Doesn't mean this sub isn't full of shit."
trees,fesi0k9,t1_ferob8e,1579365308.0,"Realistically, many people are probably fine. However, since there really isn't any information on cannabis use during pregnancy, we should abstain completely. I say this as a woman who plans to try to have a child in the next few years and who loves to smoke, so I know I will be giving it up for quite a while!"
trees,feshhdw,t3_eqed7a,1579365184.0,"Isn't it...obvious not to use cannabis during pregnancy though? I love to blaze but when the time comes and my husband and I try to conceive it's no cannabis until I'm done nursing. At minimum, there's just no information that it's SAFE to use during pregnancy which is enough to abstain completely."
fatlogic,fesfwcg,t1_fesdcmn,1579364754.0,"It's a pattern in a lot of threads, sometimes the top voted comments. Of course there are good people here too, but overall there is very much that sentiment. This is not a healthy place, especially if you are actively losing weight. I rarely come here because it just makes me feel like a piece of trash usually because I'm still fat even after losing a lot of weight, and most people here Would Not Approve. You're a useless Hambeast unless you're thin and fit, reading between the lines of many comments (and sometimes NOT reading between the lines)."
fatlogic,fesbyop,t1_fes4wqs,1579363679.0,"This sub just hates fat people, even just slightly fat ones. I was accused of succumbing to fat logic for saying that being 168 lbs at 5'3"" wasn't extremely obese, you just needed to focus on losing weight slowly before it got out of control. Like...yeah it's borderline mildly obese but not world ending? Holy shit. This is a pretty toxic sub."
rheumatoid,fes7t2b,t3_eqhn0b,1579362270.0,"I am both RF positive and had a high CCP (I think it was 180) at initial diagnosis in August. I had very clear symptoms too (bilateral pain in both feet that was impacting my ability to walk, far worse in the morning). I was diagnosed almost right away after seeing my primary doc the first time, and started treatment with a rheum a few months later. Some people wait years. I do think I was lucky that I have a very standard disease presentation in the beginning because there was no delay in treatment."
fatlogic,fenfg8b,t1_fen9zk8,1579283544.0,Oh boy yep that's what it is. This isn't a thread and subreddit full of people who just hate fat people...
fatlogic,fen76zz,t3_eq0je2,1579278475.0,"Jesus Christ this subreddit. So many comments about how fat 168 pounds is for that height. It's borderline obese, but it's not enormous. Work on losing some weight slowly before it gets to a bad point. This sub is really just fat people hate now. What is the POINT of this post?"
AmItheAsshole,fejxw6z,t3_epirbk,1579188352.0,"YTA OMG you pressured your girlfriend under extreme duress to terminate and are manipulating her again?  You got family on both sides to manipulate? No way this happened. Horse shit. If it did, you're a sociopath."
relationship_advice,fehdcng,t1_fegqf6h,1579114223.0,"This guy was dragging it out though, to try to get into a relationship with her as soon as he could. How is that ok? I do not understand this logic. If you are truly ""best friends"" with someone, even if you ""catch feelings"", you don't act this way. Or men are incredibly weak, which I don't believe to be true."
relationship_advice,fehcxhv,t1_feggjm1,1579113979.0,"From the way this was presented (one sided of course) it sounds like this guy was only her friend to get with her. So yes, while men do not owe women friendship, this guy presented himself AS her friend, until he could be in a relationship with her. When that didn't work out, he just ghosted her. That's shitty. He was never her friend at all, and likely didn't give a shit. He just wanted in her pants."
rheumatoidarthritis,fee67ru,t1_fee4yyl,1579027238.0,"That is VERY strange. I wish I had an answer for you, but I really don't. I'm sorry it's happening, cannabis can be such a help. NOT A DOCTOR but it sounds like maybe you developed an allergy? If you're in a legal state ask your doctor about it. I'm not in a legal state and I still would. Cannabis is a big part of how I manage day to day!"
rheumatoidarthritis,fee603s,t3_efad8s,1579027112.0,"I just kind of started having severe problems with my feet one day last February. I thought I had hurt myself. So yeah, it can. I was diagnosed with seropositive RA in August."
rheumatoidarthritis,fee4kwh,t3_en2vsd,1579026267.0,"I've been on methotrexate for a few months, just increased to 20mg weekly (although I will be switching off in April as my husband and I may try to have a baby sometime in the next year or so and methotrexate is NOT an option in that case). I had a hard time at first with side effects, until my rheum increased my folic acid to 2mg daily. It has helped me a lot. I'm hoping I do ok on the 20mg weekly, as the dose just increased, but we will see. Unsure what med I will be switching to in April, but my rheum said most of the biologics are considered safe for pregnancy so likely one of those. Good luck. Just remember that untreated RA is far worse than the possible side effects of medication!"
rheumatoidarthritis,fee42ux,t3_eknr2d,1579025973.0,"That is strange! I have only recently started smoking daily (for the pain, and after my diagnosis in August 2019) and have not had this problem. What other meds are you on? Does it happen if you vape (like a dry herb vape, not an oil vape), or use edibles?"
vaporents,feb3dxv,t1_fe8jw6u,1578955052.0,"I really like my Pax2. Ease of use, portability, etc. Maybe not the best option at that price point, but I'll use it until it's dead. It seems pretty unacceptable to feel that way around here. You MUST have a dynavap. Thing is, I did buy into that. I saved up and bought one. It's SO inconvenient. The torch makes it look like I'm doing hard drugs. I'd rather just smoke from a water pipe with all the set-up involved. I need to sell the dumb thing."
AmItheAsshole,feaa28r,t3_eo33vy,1578946147.0,"YTA. Going against the popular opinion here. Everyone seems to think women's vaginas are disgusting, slimy, germ-ridden holes that must be sterilized or something. They really aren't? Pour that water out, it was already boiled to sterilize the cup. Boil some new water, it'll be nice and clean. Meaning the inside of the kettle is perfectly fine. Unless it's porous and sucks up everything, in which case, why are you using it in the first place? It's not like you plunk your cup filled with blood in the kettle anyways. Dear lord people."

Boise,fe9c34h,t3_eo44vk,1578936231.0,"I watched a high schooler do a 360 and end up on the side of the road (thankfully not in a ditch!) this morning. After checking with him, poor kid was clearly shocked/terrified, clearly did not know how to drive on the ice and had not anticipated that happening. Fortunately he and his car were totally fine and he seemed to learn a valuable lesson, but it could have gone a lot differently. Be careful everyone!"

I can get raw milk and make my own cheese though, which is a hobby I'm starting. I live near farm country, but not near dairies that produce cheese. Are you closer to Portland or Seattle? I visit both at least once a year in summer and now I want to go the farmer's markets!"
ShitRedditSays,fdnz6ps,t1_fdn81fw,1578595825.0,"As a school psych, 100% this. These people have never met a person with disabilities in real life and I wouldn't want them around any child, let alone a child with disabilities, anyways."
fatlogic,fdnvgo9,t1_fdnjp3i,1578593661.0,"There's a huge variety of non-Kraft cheese. Sargento and similar are pretty flavorless. I don't know if I could tell the difference between cheap white ""cheddar"" and cheap white ""provolone"" (quotations due to the fact that in the US, we don't produce cheeses in these styles, not the actual version). You can also buy well-made, high quality cheese. The only thing I've never found is raw milk cheese, since apparently someone decided everything MUST be pasteurized. Stupid."
fatlogic,fdnv8t5,t1_fdna4rq,1578593533.0,"Sargento is not great, I don't buy it. But it's not plastic...that would be the shitty ""American"" slices that come individually wrapped in plastic (we do love to systematically destroy the environment)."

rheumatoid,fdlb9la,t1_fdl8n4k,1578520347.0,"I mean, obviously. This is also why a specialist makes the diagnosis (or should be) as they have the specific knowledge to really look at the complete picture. But it likely isn't being tested for no reason, either. And unlike the RF factor, it is pretty unusual to have a really high positive and not have it."
rheumatoid,fdl83qw,t1_fdesxyw,1578518646.0,"I was under the impression that a positive CCP was PRETTY indicative; people who are positive are very likely going to show symptoms, and if you have them, you'll likely meet diagnostic criteria. Not a rheum, but what my rheum said (however this shit is complex and I'm still learning)"
rheumatoid,fdl79iq,t1_fdl5qxa,1578518240.0,"Same. If I need cleaner, it's one of those as well. It's reduced my plastic and paper waste significantly, and no longer rinsing caustic chemicals down the drain. I wish washing machines had  ""lint trap"" to reduce rinsing the microfibers down the drain. Or a way to install one on my existing machine. I'm trying hard to go low/no waste as much as possible which is challenging with RA anyways."
fatlogic,fdl5ic2,t1_fdkon1y,1578517395.0,"Your brain is wired better and you can eat ""normally"" without thinking. You are VERY lucky. Some people, like myself, will have to track forever. I cannot trust myself to just ""eat"" because I will always overeat a bit. I start to slide, gain a little. Over time, that becomes a LOT. Then you get used to eating more, and you add a little more to that. Tracking keeps me honest and aware of what I've had and how to adjust."
cannabis,fdl2hg5,t3_elxayc,1578515939.0,"Idaho is trying. We have to have ~56k signatures by April from all around the state. Lord I hope we get to vote, it'll pass we if we do."
fitness30plus,fdkkjs4,t1_fdkjryz,1578505515.0,"500 is a good deficit, if you truly track your calories you will lose very steadily. It doesn't show quickly though and people end up discouraged and give up in my experience, which sucks. It's a marathon! I've done a 1000 calorie deficit but never consistently over time, just like a day here and there. I had a lot of weight to lose and still have 50 pounds to go, so I usually do a 750 deficit. But I was morbidly obese and had health concerns so needed to get the weight off."
fitness30plus,fdkkadn,t1_fdkjjrm,1578505387.0,"1000 calorie deficit max, don't go below your basal metabolic rate. It's recommended men not drop below 1500 calories per day to maintain muscle mass. Calculate your TDEE, subtract 500 cals per day to lose 1 pound per week, 1000 to lose 2."
rheumatoid,fdkk1zz,t3_elo54j,1578505269.0,"I really like E-Cloths (you can find them on their site, or Amazon, etc). They're a variety of microfiber cloths that you can use to clean with just water or cleaner if you like. The range/stovetop cleaner was freaking amazing. I could NOT scrub to get gunk off and was about to just switch kitchen duty to my husband, but all I needed was water and this cloth thing to get that stuff off and it was perfectly clean. I didn't have to push or anything. Just wipe, throw the cloths in the washer, use again. Granted, my hands aren't super affected yet (mostly my feet). These things are like Norwex but not MLM."
AmItheAsshole,fdkjklx,t1_fdkci6i,1578505035.0,"When I'm having IBS-C issues, I have the same problem. It's like the shifting/standing causes more shit to move down. Super frustrating. It's the only time I take longer in the bathroom!"
AmItheAsshole,fdkjau8,t1_fdk237z,1578504899.0,My husband reads books. Probably occasionally masturbates but I don't ask him about it. Doesn't bother me as he isn't avoiding me or not doing his share of the housework. Personally I hate sitting over the toilet or being near one longer than I need to so I'm in and out.
fatlogic,fdhq1h9,t1_fdhnpco,1578427901.0,"This is why people dislike vegans, actually. It frequently comes across very holier than thou. Eating less meat is clearly better for the environment (and weight loss!) Same with eating less shitty, simple carbs. I did/still do both when I started losing weight. I'm not vegan. Mostly fish and locally sourced dairy now. Guess I'm delusional."

Back at work like normal, it'll last a week as I only smoke evenings after 5 and weekends. If I'm reducing usage it'll last 2 weeks to a month depending on how much I want to reduce.

Most that are, are active with someone older than them (personal experience, I don't have data for this but true in my area). Sex ed is critical in elementary, I agree. But I wouldn't say many young girls are sexually active with their boyfriends. They don't really start having sex until high school, much higher numbers there (and usually with each other, overall. Thankfully.)"
