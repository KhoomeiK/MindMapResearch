Sims4,ff9ox4p,t1_ff7zxhg,1579717607.0,A majority of jobs in America require an age of at least 16.
Sims4,ff9osk3,t1_ff97h6j,1579717515.0,Lol my cat's name is Spike but oddly I say this to him quite often.
Sims4,ff9ohu3,t3_es73jl,1579717304.0,Lol. Yes. But not until I had the game for well over a year.

fatlogic,ff74gn0,t1_ff73jzx,1579640932.0,"And from what I read recently, those options aren't going to improve any time soon."
fatlogic,ff74ays,t1_ff71ioa,1579640840.0,Love that.
fatlogic,ff7436z,t3_erw0ky,1579640716.0,"I earned it. I worked super duper hard at not giving a shit about my health and now I'm working hard at making sure no one else does, either. Proud af over here."
Sims4,ff72s39,t1_ff6zk4k,1579639972.0,Lol!
Sims4,ff6y9ow,t3_erzm53,1579637363.0,"Were there any mitigating factors, like were they tired or anything like that, or was it just random? And was it when they were taking it down/putting it back up, or were they already sleeping in it?"
Sims4,ff6wyd9,t1_ff6nv80,1579636590.0,It released at 10 AM Pacific. Check the website instead of the client.
Sims4,ff6woq7,t3_erzluy,1579636434.0,Have you tried repairing your game?
fatlogic,ff6wge4,t1_ff6tazb,1579636297.0,"I get that. It definitely is more difficult as an adult! And yeah I am mainly on my own as far as the diet and exercise, though I have one friend who is good about it, it's just something we don't do together often. The three women I consider myself closest to - the one I've been friends with for over 15 years (I'm 34), and the other two since we've been 6 lol. So I don't really have adult-onset friends that I spend a ton of time with lol."
fatlogic,ff6or2h,t1_ff61hgu,1579631720.0,"Yes! I love how they always go to the extreme: I subsisted on air, special diet water, and one piece of celery a day and I got rEaLLy UnHeALThY. Oh really? Did you? Well might as well just go back to eating 4000 calories worth of whatever you want, there's certainly no middle ground to be had."
fatlogic,ff6mdoj,t1_ff6j2xr,1579630285.0,"Lol I mean I was with you until the not having friends part. The actions of your SO's friends are not normal friend actions. At all. Edit to add, if they are normal for your friends, then they are not actually friends. Plain and simple."

Sims4,ff6icd8,t1_ff5iacg,1579627825.0,Your EA folder should be in your Documents. At least on my PC it is.
Sims4,ff6h7vf,t1_ff67fe3,1579627137.0,Well what about just turning it off for everyone? Basically just pauses the whole world and then once she's done you can turn it back on and it will be like normal.
fatlogic,ff4oevf,t1_ff4kpc2,1579568554.0,I almost spit out my water lol
Sims4,ff4jm0j,t3_eri7ow,1579565195.0,I love watching Kelsey's 100 baby challenge and Call Me Kevin's Jim Pickens saga. Of course those are not new but just commenting in case they're new to you :)
Sims4,ff4j3t2,t3_erldf4,1579564835.0,I read it's because there's a patch from the 16th for PC that console doesn't have yet. Unless you have it now? In which case I'm not sure.

But it releases 10 am Pacific in the US so just change that to whatever it is for you :) Edit to add, for expansion packs they do the staggered release but doesn't look like they do the same for stuff packs. Everyone gets it at the same time."

Sims4,ff3wuee,t1_ff1otz2,1579550590.0,The creator I like is leahlaz. Lots of cool builds in basegame only.

fatlogic,ff31wsh,t1_ff2n7ab,1579531516.0,"Depending on how much weight a person carries, moving until breath is moderately elevated could mean the walk from the couch to the refrigerator. Workout complete."
fatlogic,ff31qr0,t1_ff1zlzj,1579531383.0,Omg I never realized I could get so angry at that word until I found this sub!
fatlogic,ff31oul,t3_er6wz7,1579531340.0,Also know what treats sleep apnea? WEIGHT LOSS.
fatlogic,ff31kq5,t3_er6wz7,1579531247.0,"Honestly this is disgusting and it pisses me off. Just like the people who say don't get chemo, use essential oils to cure your stage 3 cancer. Also, what the hell, man? You know who you should be asking for advice? YOUR DOCTOR. Not some goddamn internet charlatan."
fatlogic,ff30voi,t1_ff2zqgb,1579530691.0,"I watched a ton of Twilight Zone last year and I thought everyone was super tiny, but really they were probably (most of them at least) just normal healthy weight."
Sims4,ff2zlza,t1_ff23bdb,1579529638.0,"Hmm interesting! Yeah I think it might be from MCCC, when I looked it up before it said only males could become pregnant when abducted, females just get the abducted moodlet. I don't want have to start worrying about my female sims lol, they're the only ones in my game who ever get abducted in the first place üòÇ"
fatlogic,ff2cji7,t1_fek5lvn,1579500726.0,"Agree on Target. I wear XS-S on most things there when normally I'm M-L. Not sure on numbered sizes, though."
fatlogic,ff2ad6p,t1_fek1eie,1579498582.0,I'm American and I've never heard of them.
Sims4,ff1z86t,t1_ff1o1dp,1579489622.0,That only happens with male sims.
Sims4,ff1yxlr,t1_ff1o5yg,1579489408.0,No. Only men can get impregnated with alien babies. Edit to add: I mean randomly from being abducted.
Sims4,ff1yipn,t3_er6joq,1579489119.0,No. I like having my game updated. I don't find them annoying.
Sims4,ff1otz2,t1_fesi76f,1579482870.0,"Haha sorry, I haven't been on in a while. I'll probably play tomorrow and I can have a look. I do like a more modern look in a lot of my builds so they might be more open than you prefer, but there's for sure one creator who has a lot of great BG stuff. I'll get back to you!"
fatlogic,ff1lxw3,t1_fezm2da,1579481353.0,"Random fun fact: ""first, do no harm"" is actually not found in the Hippocratic oath, though it is a quote from another one of Hippocrates' works!

That's not to argue with your totally correct point lol, just something a lot of people don't know :)"
fatlogic,ff0lrfk,t1_fexupma,1579470088.0,"Man I can't recall, do they have the M√©xico storyline in the book? I don't remember it if they do. I remember other areas being mentioned in passing but that's about it. Like I said in my other comment it's been a minute, though!"
fatlogic,ff0lc18,t1_feyhyzw,1579469931.0,"I do remember some comments in the book referring to the fact that the issue was with the men. I've read it a bunch of times but it's been a while. Of course it may just have been that the men are ALSO sterile, as you said. Guess I'll just give it another read! :) But yeah both being affected would really make the most sense overall."
loseit,fes0yca,t1_fepvh70,1579360287.0,"Yassssss, love JJ's unwiches!"
Sims4,ferqobg,t1_felxhum,1579357236.0,"Yeah as the other person mentioned lots of casinos just showers. Nicer ones often tend to have a shower and maybe a separate bath/jacuzzi. I've actually seen that in casinos way more often than shower/tub combos. But *most* regular hotels, like a Courtyard, I've seen combos. :)"
Sims4,ferpzcr,t1_fen19ow,1579357025.0,"Hmm that's odd, I've downloaded quite a few BG only builds that are furnished."
Sims4,fepeck3,t1_fep47r5,1579318406.0,I posted my newer comment before I saw this. Well that's just unfortunate. I didn't even know Origin Legacy was a thing...
Sims4,fepe7kh,t1_feov03m,1579318312.0,If I were you I'd try looking into this further. I've read a lot on the forums of questions from today and yesterday regarding legacy edition and no one has mentioned it being discontinued. Most of the time the people who are answering questions on the forum do not actually work for EA. Not to mention I think we'd see a lot more about it on this reddit. Don't give up hope!
Sims4,feouqm7,t1_feotjfw,1579305864.0,That just makes zero sense. Why would they discontinue something they made as the discontinuation? They don't ever have to update it or anything. I haven't seen anyone else mention this on here. If it's true that's a bummer but very very strange.
Sims4,feoqb1u,t1_fentqqi,1579303876.0,That doesn't seem right. Where did you hear that?
Sims4,fenezx1,t1_fen6t93,1579283265.0,Yes.
Sims4,fenekcg,t1_fenajxl,1579283000.0,"I'm not sure but I assume they mean you can click on a decorative pile of books and take books out of it, like with a bookshelf."
Sims4,fenehjp,t1_fenagle,1579282955.0,"Omg I didn't see the bed upgrade thing in the patch notes, that's awesome!"
Sims4,fen3dir,t1_fen1n1b,1579276074.0,Sadly I'm guessing that may have more to do with it. :( https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/2f6f61/tutorial_how_to_unlock_download_and_play_sims_4/. I believe this is what I followed to do it! Good luck!
Sims4,fen17nw,t3_eq1oos,1579274687.0,Search for basegame only builds on the gallery. There are a lot of good ones! :)
Sims4,fen13a9,t3_eq1l0q,1579274608.0,"I used a VPN to download University early (I paid for it of course, just used it to look like I was in Australia as they were able to download before me in the eastern US). So no, Origin doesn't block VPNs."
Sims4,felmkq7,t3_epsven,1579225772.0,...what?
loseit,felgs4g,t1_feku8xx,1579221810.0,"""I am the one with self control issues."" You said it yourself. You need to deal with those issues, they aren't going to magically go away just because you lose x amount of weight and go on a vacation."
Sims4,fel6zca,t1_fel0dly,1579215401.0,"Lol, I will say I've never heard it referred to as that irl."
loseit,fek5tkn,t1_fejqr1l,1579193221.0,"^This. It certainly doesn't happen with every person, but every person I'VE personally known (three) who've gotten the surgery has not kept the weight off. They aren't learning sustainable methods for doing so."
loseit,feivk9i,t1_fehp7o4,1579148387.0,"34 year old female with anxiety issues since my late teens here. All great suggestions. I think probably one of the best things for me has been getting comfortable with feeling uncomfortable. Not trying to ignore it or gloss over it, but saying, like you, I'm feeling like shit and that's OK. It won't be this way forever. Granted it takes practice to get there, OP, but just keep at it. And ignoring it is still a valid option if it's just too much! Walk, listen to music, play a game, whatever!"
Sims4,feirprd,t1_feikp2q,1579145521.0,I'm more concerned about the fingers on her right hand.
Sims4,feiefyg,t1_feicoqf,1579136601.0,I've definitely seen people say they play on console with a keyboard and mouse.
Sims4,fefgnzy,t1_feewasn,1579055931.0,Ok that was my guess! üòÇ Thank you!!
Sims4,feeux4f,t3_eop7ud,1579041748.0,I don't get this because I have literally zero idea what the selected option means. ü§îü§£

loseit,fe3je0y,t1_fe33c1x,1578849754.0,"Also if you like the WW setup but want something cheaper, I use Ultimate Value Food Diary. You can get the premium version for $17.99/year. There's no message boards or anything so some people might not like the lack of support, but I never used that much so I'm good with just the point tracking."
Sims4,fe36ky5,t1_fdru317,1578846488.0,Lol been there!
Sims4,fe2rm1i,t3_ennrsm,1578842084.0,"I'm on 11th of my current one now. I'd also like to shoot for the Alphabet Legacy achievement, or really as long as I can. I started end of November 2018. I played on regular span for first 10 generations but now I'm using custom spans through MCCC."
Sims4,fdy10b8,t3_enbxv5,1578774940.0,It won't work until they put out another patch and fix it.
Sims4,fdxg6x5,t3_en9x7i,1578768434.0,"Yes and no. Yes in general, but for all the time I've gotten out of it (over 800 hours), no. I can easily go out for food and drinks for 3-4 hours and spend over $100, so for all I get out of this, I'm OK with it."
