MovieDetails,fdvtzzv,t1_fduve02,1578751480.0,Movie makers apparently get away with a lot. Like ruining real forest to make fake forests.
worldnews,fdvsgwc,t1_fdu4b6i,1578751052.0,"If it was taking off from Iran, and then Iran shot it down.. To me that is the biggest indicator that this was from a source of some kind of error and not from grievance."

AnimalsBeingJerks,fc096y1,t1_fc08iyn,1577283671.0,Yeah I love how the gentle prodding of the butt had to turn into a crow bar between the raccoon and the wall to turn the raccoon-to-wall suction cup effect off.
