poetry_critics,ff9ydqp,t3_escll7,1579724169.0,"I like the no punctuation. That, the energy and raw emotion in the poem, and the repetition, all make it feel like it’s the intense climax of an argument. Which I think fits nicely with the subject talked about I the poem. 

I have mixed feelings on the rhyme scheme. In some places, I feel like it limits you. For example, I didn’t like the rhyme scheme in around the first 16 lines or so. I don’t think it helps the flow or adds anything. However, I LOVED the lines “you died alone in your hospital bed / nothing was left to be said / but life had some lessons to teach / my forgiveness was not out of reach / maybe we shared more than a name / maybe we are the same / were you also not alone but afraid / in the home your father made”. They really stood out to me and had an impact me, and I think the rhyming definitely helped with that. So my suggestion world be to either make only some parts rhyme, like the amazing lines I pointed out, so they punch even more. Or to keep the rhyming for the whole thing, but rearrange and change a some of the beginning/end of the poem. 

Really good job, I really liked this! Thanks for sharing!"

OCPoetry,fesqde5,t3_eqbi99,1579367923.0,"This is beautiful. The poem has a lot of amazingly done imagery. One thing I will comment on is how I don’t like that every line ends in a comma. You could not put any punctuation at the end of line 2, and you could put a period at the end of line 4. Those are just examples, but I think since the lines themselves have variety so should the punctuation. But honestly that’s a very minor complaint and won’t harm the poem at all if you don’t change it. Really good job, I loved this!"
OCPoetry,feskj4l,t3_eqepi7,1579366199.0,"One thing that stood out to me was your use of punctuation. You weren’t consistent with it. You didn’t put commas in some places that would make sense for them to be, like after “life”.  Yet you chose to place them in others. So I would recommend being consistent. Either no punctuation at the end of lines, or punctuation in every place it should be. 

Like another comment pointed out, “lost” kind of breaks up the flow of the poem. If you either moved it, removed it, or not put a period at the end of it, I think you could fix that. 

All of that being said, I like the theme. I would be interested to see if you could develop this more or play with more ideas, without extending the size of the poem too much. Because I really did like the feeling of being lost you created in such a short poem. Hope any of my feedback helped, thanks for sharing this!"

OCPoetry,fcndvfe,t1_fcmz03k,1577809646.0,"Okay, I will!

I didn’t really notice these the first time I read it, but now that I’m reading it again, I realize you could clean some things up. For example, in the first stanza, the line that says “and nonchalantly wiped your tears” might work better without the “and”. 

In the fourth stanza, “he’s always done more for you than I couldn’t”, did you mean “could” instead of “couldn’t”? That change would make more sense, but it’s possible it already does make sense and I’m just reading it wrong. Also in that stanza, I think “then why are you so repulsed” would sound better as “so why are you so repulsed”. 

But all of these are just my opinions to make an already well flowing poem sound a bit better"

OCPoetry,fclzleq,t3_ehsdx3,1577760384.0,"As another comment pointed out, I think this poem is quite long in a way that isn’t good. I usually wouldn’t say that’s a bad thing, but this felt like it went in so many different directions. I know there is a central theme, but it’s hard to focus on that when there were parts that didn’t feel connected. Maybe you wanted it to feel like it keeps going off in different directions because that’s how you (or the narrator) feels, but to me, it didn’t benefit the poem. Maybe to fix this, you could make it shorter.  But you could also add some repetition, I think a certain line or beginning of a line repeated throughout the poem would help. 

However, I do think the flow of most parts fits this poem very well. If it weren’t so long, I would’ve really liked how it was all one stanza. And that, plus the very well done imagery and language paints a really good picture. Thanks for sharing!"

poetry_critics,fc7u5zc,t3_egfz24,1577518716.0,"About what the other comment said about how it doesn’t flow well, maybe try to help that with using shorter lines. That’s not always the case, but in this particular poem I think the long lines drag it down and hurt the flow. 

Another tip I have to generally improve the flow would be to read it out loud, or at least whisper it. Try to keep a steady rhythm, or keep the emotion consistent with how the poem should be. If you keep getting stuck on one part, then that’s probably a part you should change to make it sound better. This might sound weird, but keep editing it until you get it to a place where it “clicks” and comes together. 

I don’t know if any of my advice made much sense. But good job on this poem, i like it besides the flow! And good luck with future writing!"

OCPoetry,fc7rn21,t3_egl8d4,1577516865.0,"I really loved this. Firstly, it flows very well, every line leads into the next in a way that’s very well done. I think my favorite thing about this is the way you convey emotions. I can feel the anger, the frustration, the feeling of being trapped, the desperation, all throughout different parts. The way you describe things really does bring it to life. Also I thought the way you described trauma and intrusive thoughts was very well done, and gave me a lot of insight into what you (or the perspective) went through and is still going through. 

The only criticism I have is about your punctuation. Correct me if I’m wrong, but it doesn’t feel very consistent. It might be intentional for certain parts to be different, but I didn’t see a reason to make it that way and didn’t think the change (if there was an intentional one) added much. But that is just my opinion, and there might actually be a reason for there to be punctuation is certain places that I missed. 

Overall, this is a very well done poem that I can really see the intention and meaning put into it! Thanks for sharing"
