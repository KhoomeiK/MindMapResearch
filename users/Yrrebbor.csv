widowers,ff373xq,t3_erbl7b,1579535264.0,"I’m sorry for your loss.  My wife died at 34, and we were trying to conceive.

Just take a moment at a time. The shock is probably still there, and it will take some time to even try to process all the feelings you are having now. 

Someone told me the advice of “say yes to everything,” meaning don’t turn down any social invitation. Getting out of the house was a lifesaver for me, as it forced me not to sit on the couch crying all day. Go to dinner, get drinks, go for walks, go for drives, etc.

Counseling and group meetings didn’t feel like they helped in the beginning, but they definitely were excuses to get out of the house, which in itself was a positive thing. 

Just make sure to get up and out of bed every day, take a shower, brush your teeth, and reach out to all of your friends and family. I had a call list when I needed someone to speak with, and called down the list until someone answered."

Ultimately, do whatever you think will make you feel better.  Seeing her photo might always make you feel horrible; I lose it every time I see my late wife, and just try to avoid it.  Maybe not the healthiest, but it hurts so damn much!"
