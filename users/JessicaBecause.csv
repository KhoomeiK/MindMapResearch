When you are traveling down a place like 91st and Sheridan and there is a merge lane about an 8th of a mile long **USE IT**. Because when you dont, you have a dozen cars behind you stuck in a  single lane that cant go anywhere until 15 cars in the left lane go thru the light in a single file.

Then everyone is like ""But why is the traffic so bad here??"" There are two lanes to hold all the traffic thats lined up to back to Memorial.....

Additionally, how much better would south bound Yale be if you didnt all use the left lane a block away to get on to the creek turnpike?

These lanes are there and if more people use them more often, and you guys that dont let people merge (or ""cut in front of you"") began to do this, traffic would be going as planned by the city.
