whatcouldgoright,ffcz01p,t1_ffcsj8v,1579810177.0,I dont think its exaggerating nearly as drastically as everyone is saying. I think yall are getting bamboozled by her leaning. The cliff is the same steepness when she walks past it at the end even tho she is upright.
whatcouldgoright,ffcyq8a,t1_ffcts8p,1579810024.0,"Thats what the backpack is for... 

And my point was that you dont have to stand perfectly straight to avoid falling. See ""bending over""."
whatcouldgoright,ffcyhsl,t1_ffcw5jm,1579809890.0,"How do you not see her walking upright on the dirt path at the end and notice the basically vertical cliff next to her? Also, trees and shrubbery grow weird on slopes (have you ever been hiking/camping?). Center of gravity doesnt have to be perfect, just good enough which is what the backpack is for. The pack being tight or not is irrelevant unless she is bending over or violently shaking back and forth. 


Even if you turn your phone to make her stand perfectly vertical, she is still on a tight ridgeline with a near straight drop (unless the ridegline she originally was on and the dirt path she ended up on were both heavily slanted....which almost never occurs). Just use the ground as reference and it becomes quite clear just how steep that 16+ foot fall is."

I could be very wrong."

You can see it is steep as shit and that the ""tilt"" of the camera added almost no effect to the perception of the cliffs angle. In reality, she was tilting, not the camera. She has to because if she doesn't, her right shoulder would be scraping the wall. 

Very dangerous. Loose gravel means she is falling on top of her baby."

I care if you think the two acts are comparable/equivalent. Thats all this has ever been about and yet you constantly avoid this very easy question to answer with things like ""according to my law textbook..."". You do realize that both of these VERY DIFFERENT actions would receive VERY DIFFERENT outcomes in a court case. There is a difference between calling someone a slut and purposefully attempting to ruin someones life by spreading information that could get them fired (not possible with slut accusations).

And we had a back and forth earlier about you never comparing the two. Im not going back there for your dumbass.

And we are arguing the morality NOW because i have to explain to you the difference between these two actions (i didnt think you were dumb enough to need an explanation). Calling someone sexually promiscuous is nowhere near as severe or harming as claiming to as many people as possible that your ex lover is a drug addict, cheater, and STD carrier.

If you really think those two things should carry a similar punishment in court, you should never be allowed on a jury."

3. You actually never answered the question. All you kept saying was ""i never made a comparison!"" (Which you did) and ""they are both textbook definitions of defamation"". Both of those arent answers

4. Severity is key, dum dum. First off women call men out on sexual promiscuity all the fucking time on social media, as much if not more than men do calling women out on the same thing. Also, you mean to tell me that you think on offhand comment calling a girl/man a slut is the same as alleging someone to be a drug addict, cheater, and as having multiple stds? Mind you that the person making that last claim also showed they specifically put this info out there  to attempt to ruin the accused's reputation/career (specifically by texting threats to the accused).
