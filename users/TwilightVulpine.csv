These are not rare original masterpieces from dead authors, they are items which just got mass-produced at a smaller scale and then discontinued, maybe got a special finish, maybe got some better game functions. Some of the rarity and collectability may be organic, not every card meant to be sought after becomes popular, but they deliberately try to create that effect.

I also find it kind of funny that they invented a game mode that's all about buying a bunch of packs. I dunno if that came straight from WotC or some clever shop owner, but I almost respect the clever marketing mind that came up with it.

There are *less explotative* ways to engage with booster-based card games. In theory people can just buy boxed sets, which would be fine. But I don't think that represents most of the market. From what I know of avid Magic players, it's still often a huge money sink for many of them, even when they supposedly know better. The game's design, print and marketing tactics are aimed towards impulsive spending and gambling. 

One other thing that makes it less explotative than some lootbox games is that having to go to the game shop, or waiting for online delivery creates an obstacle for the impulsive purchases and instant gratification, people can't just get it anytime they feel an urge.

I don't see all this worry about players having to make new characters when DMs kill their PCs.

Nevermind that this is taking it to the extreme. The PC can just as easily decide ""more people need my help, I must keep going"". They can decide to make a more lasting character after that. 

Quite frankly, as long as the player is swift at character creation and well-prepared, playing as a series of locals who join the party temporarily seems as good as a concept as any. But if you  can't even entertain what such a player wants, what makes you think you are going to make it better?"

It is helpful to guide the player towards the intended experience, but too much enforcement of a certain playstyle may end up alienating players who want to try an adjacent unintended playstyle. Lately I have talked to another gamer who decided they don't want to play Sekiro, because they liked the defensive approach and variety of Dark Souls better, ""making him play right"" pushed him away from the game.

A designer may have more knowledge and experience in designing the systems they want to present, they can spot negative patterns players may fall into, ""optimizing the fun away"" as they say, but they don't have an ultimate all-encompassing understanding of what players may want.

If we can relate it to other media as well, tabletop RPGs come to mind. D&D was originally created with the goal of mostly tactical dungeon crawling.

Definitely parents should pay more attention, but no. When a company financially tries to exploit their audience using addictive elements, [which are essentially like gambling, psychologically](https://www.sciencealert.com/psychology-loot-boxes-reflect-gambling), they should at the very least be proactive about preventing children's access to it. They should be proactive about informing parents about controls.

When someone is scammed, they may have been stupid, but the scammer is still the one most at fault.

It's relevant to point out as well that EA, alongside multiple other companies who resort to lootboxes, are members of ESA, who controls the ESRB.

The ""different opinions"" are about what kind of society we ought to be building. It doesn't work like signing a bill that just says ""make things better for everyone"" and it happens.

When we get to objective specific matters such as, ""should impoverished people have access to basic healthcare"", that's just one of the many matters where opinions split. There is no universal ""make it better"" choice."

brasil,fehl0ri,t1_fegf3ye,1579118692.0,"A militância exagerada tende a ser usada por grupos que querem desmerecer o valor da diversidade e do combate ao preconceito. Tem lugares que compartilham cada absurdo que um adolescente militante extremo aleatório fala, mas ignoram as centenas de outras pessoas apenas buscando empatia e oferecendo argumentos razoáveis.

Dito isso, também não aprovo o pessoal com as ondas de ""cancelamento"", porque acho que as vezes toma um aspecto exagerado canibal. Tendo gente tão pior florescendo, Bolsonaro e afins, focar a energia em sabotar pessoas progressistas que fizeram umas poucas declarações erradas é má estratégia. Mas é complicado, que na mídia social tudo é muito pessoal para cada pessoa que participa. As pessoas ofendidas muitas vezes tem motivos válidos para criticar.

Mas as pessoas que me preocupam não são grandes celebridades tipo Stephen King ou J.K. Rowling,  escritores de renome e sucesso com pilhas de trabalhos publicados e fortunas feita. Duvido que a carreira deles vão ser sabotadas por pessoas criticando no Twitter, e num caso extremamente improvável de afetar, eles ainda vão estar muito bem de vida. Me preocupam pessoas tipo a Contrapoints, uma YouTuber com uma quantidade moderada de seguidores que ajuda a conscientizar pessoas sobre questões de preconceito e minorias, mas fala uma besteira ou outra aqui e alí. Ela pode ser afetada de verdade, e a perda da voz seria um prejuízo."

Other RPGs, especially MMOs, have been doing this for a while now. Pokémon Go too. So it's not even particularly inspired from them. 

It would be much better for the gameplay as a whole if the player could meaningfully affect the odds of getting the right pokémon that they want. The sense of accomplishment is completely artificial, there is nothing different from the time you get the right pokémon, to the time it is a different one. It's just a % roll you got unlucky at, like a roulette."

But part of it is that they actually put the time and resources needed to make a better game.

I do not envy this team that is just made to churn out more of the same 20 year-old game every other year even though it's becoming blatantly evident to everybody how stale it has gotten. People already got mad about the cut pokémon, I doubt that the people who stuck around will mind changes as much. Maybe this is the best time to make changes, now that the backlash has been winding down."
