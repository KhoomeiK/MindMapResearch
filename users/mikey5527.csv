>Down south in the Woolsey fire, in the Malibu area, it is actually grass and shrubs that are burning. The native chaparral shrublands are dominated by shrub species that evolved with fires occurring every several decades to every century or so. Human activity has shortened the time between fires, however, which kills native chaparral species before they can produce seeds. These frequent fires also allow non-native grasses to invade. Unlike shrubs, such grasses are capable of burning nearly every year and still recovering. This mix of invasive grasses and chaparral is what is fueling the Woolsey fire.

>Up north, in the Camp fire, it is grass, brush and timber. Here another wildfire factor comes into focus: human development patterns. We like to live in beautiful places and oftentimes this includes building our homes and communities among the flammable vegetation.

>Prescribed fires, which are planned fires lit by managers, are conducted during much more benign weather than the warm, dry and windy conditions that are driving the current flames. Prescribed fires help reduce the buildup of vegetation and break up the continuity of these fuels across the landscape. Extreme weather will continue to occur, but at least when vegetation is more variable, it acts as an impediment to fires spreading rapidly.

Matt thinks that Trump wants to clear cut forests, and is opposed to that. Matt isn't opposed to the idea that controlling the dead vegetation will help control these fires or that human activity is responsible for the dead vegetation."

Only if you smoke it, but that's because of combustion, not the cannabis itself. 

>Schizophrenia is a particular problem when using it from youth

False. There is an increased risk of developing psychosis and schizophrenia if you are predisposed to schizophrenia. This is a non-issue for the vast majority of the population. 

>Furthermore the medical benefits lack evidence

Pain relief, nausea suppression, and many other benefits can be gained from cannabis. This is self-evident if you've ever ingested THC. 

Nobody who is serious about MMJ claims that it can cure anything. I'm not sure if this is what you were getting at.

>and you can become psychologically dependent.

Okay? You can become psychologically dependent on anything, especially things that make you feel good. The good thing about a psychological dependency is that it is relatively easy to quit. Cigarettes have taken me years to quit, but I went from smoking weed every day to not smoking at all for the past week, and my only ""withdrawal symptom"" was a half-night of insomnia. 

>and typically relate to the use of cannabis in producing a given medicine not smoking it directly. 

The only FDA approved medicine that is derived from cannabis is Epidolex. This is simply a CBD pill. You could get the same benefits from smoking, vaping, dabbing, eating, or using cannabis in any other way. There is nothing special about Epidolex other than the fact that you can travel across state lines with it. In fact, you can get additional benefits if your strain has CBN, CBG, or CBC in it. All of those can be found in hemp (which is the O'Douls of cannabis).

There are several other medicines that are cannabis-like, but they are created synthetically. 

>Alcohol on the other hand can be consumed in moderate amounts with virtually 0 ill effect

It's absolutely amazing you said this. Alcohol is a toxin, and can cause damage to your body even in small amounts. Nothing found in cannabis is a toxin. You can't even overdose from ingesting cannabis in any form. The *only* unsafe form of ingesting cannabis is through inhalation, with combustion being *much* more dangerous than vaping or dabbing. Using edibles is no more dangerous than eating anything else.

>and is a connoisseurs product which can be enjoyed in a cultured manner like opera or literature. To my knowledge is not true of cannabis. 

I have no idea what you mean by this, but I'll take a shot. 

Cannabis is much more than rolling a joint and smoking it. Each strain has different combinations and levels of cannabinoids (CBD, THC, terpenes, etc), which all effect the overall high. Different brands of whiskey taste different, but the effect is pretty constant. 

I personally enjoy getting a light high before visiting art exhibits. Oftentimes, it makes me view art from a different perspective than I would sober. Also, I precede every hike with a smoke session. It allows me to hike 8-12 miles without getting too worn out and makes the views absolutely amazing. 

I honestly recommend buying a preroll at some point and smoking weed once. You're not going to get addicted, you probably won't do something so stupid that it will ruin your life in any way, and it will give you some well-needed perspective on what cannabis actually is."

Legalization also gives me an option to purchase some bud in IL, where my parents live. They won't accept my medical card, but they'll be happy to sell me recreational weed next week. 

TL;DR - activists can feel free to parade me around. Give me a couple joints and buy me a ticket. I'll go wherever they need me."

I'm curious what your opinion is on people who use it medicinally. It's been a rough few days back in IA now that my migraines, IBS, and GERD are all flaring back up. It's not much of a choice when the options are existing with crippling pain vs being somewhat productive and not in pain."

Marijuana,fc0gc00,t1_fc0eycw,1577290205.0,"Not really. One thing he could do is order law enforcement to not enforce marijuana laws. Sales would still be illegal. 

Another thing he could do is remove it from federal scheduling. Some states will jump on this and legalize it, but this still allows states to keep it illegal and doesn't necessarily open up trade between states. 

Anything he does still leaves the order open to lawsuits, which will definitely happen, as there will be conflicting laws. It's unclear how those will be ruled on, but it will be years of litigation. 

Finally, legislating from the executive leaves the order open to being removed later. What happens when someone else comes in and cancels the order or puts it back into schedule 1 or 2 status?

Like I said before, focus on the legislature if you want  the laws to change."

The date that it goes into effect is a little questionable though. Most sources are telling me that it takes effect immediately, which was last Friday. Others are saying it may not be until next summer."
