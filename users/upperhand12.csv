Drugs,ffaxs2a,t1_ff9z6rj,1579746961.0,"I have heavily abused mdma in the past. One time 5 days in a row. Other times, weekly for a few months. Shit like that. 

Some things I‚Äôd like to say: I have pretty gnarly anxiety now. I used to have anxiety but it seems a bit more amplified nowadays.

Some depression but it‚Äôs mostly just being unmotivated, pretty manageable. (has never gotten to the point I want to kill myself).

I think my speech has been affected. When I was younger I would stutter a bit, but now it‚Äôs a lot more often and sometimes I have a hard time saying what I‚Äôm thinking.

Yes I‚Äôm still alive and love life. No I‚Äôm not a vegetable.

If you rolled 2 days in a row recently and are worried you fucked yourself over, don‚Äôt worry, I have you beat by 1000x and I‚Äôm still conscious, living, and breathing.

news,ff4txdo,t1_ff4rnrf,1579572365.0,"Ecstasy is just a pill pressed with some binders and MDMA. Of course, sometimes it might be cut with something but that can always be dealt with by using a test kit on it. 
If test kit shows it‚Äôs cut with something else you simply throw the pill away.

Although, there‚Äôs plenty of pills going around nowadays that have just mdma in it. 

Yes there is *just* MDMA which comes in crystal form and it‚Äôs pure. That‚Äôs what they call Molly. But that‚Äôs exactly what you find in ecstasy pills unless it‚Äôs bunk or cut. Buy a test kit and always test your pills or crystals. Even mdma crystals can be bunk or cut."
