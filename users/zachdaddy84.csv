There are these little pen sized things off the wings and tail called static wicks. The airplane absorbs the energy of the strike and it dissipates out via these static wicks. That's why if you ever watch the videos of airplanes taking a hit, that it seems to go straight thru the airplane. It doesn't go thru the airplane but is redistributed as energy flows and reconvenes underneath the airplane. It's quite fascinating. 

But those static wicks usually work well enough to dissolve the direct hit and tend not to puncture a hole in the airframe. But, that's why you're delayed.

TwoXChromosomes,fcvfbl5,t1_fcva6rv,1578000901.0,"While combined BC meds are on the market, such as Yaz, seasonale, and lybrel, that are meant to suppress both flow and PMS symptoms, the majority of BC on the market still will produce some sort of flow. If you are taking the PMS suppressant combo, it would make sense to keep track of your cycle, regardless of how not exact it can truly be. 

At peak chance of egg fertilization, you are looking at about 33% chance. That's day of ovulation. The egg, once planted in the uterus, has a lifespan of roughly 24 hours (some sources say up to 36 hours) to be fertilized before being shed. Sperm have a lifespan of 24-72 hours while inside the womb. 

So all in, there are probably 6 days out of the month that the female can conceive, and only up to 33% chance of that actually happening if all stars align, so to speak. 

No, the apps out there aren't exactly science, but it will allow for proper communication between partners that will give them chance to properly protect themselves if they choose not to have offspring. Which education in this area clearly lacks"
