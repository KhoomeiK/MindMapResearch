""You've been giving Beanes bad grades your whole life.  Now you have to eat...beans...""

(It cuts to a contraption where the teacher is strapped to a chair and a steady flow of beans are going into his mouth.  Sometimes faster sometimes slower.  There are sensors on the floor that measure how many beans fall away and aren't eaten.  Then there is a blade that gets closer to the teacher's throat if floor beans are sensed.  So as soon as the teacher's mouth gets too full and the blade barely touches his neck it causes an immediate reaction of spilling all of the beans onto the floor - then the blade goes clean all the way through his neck due to most of the beans being dropped.)"
