DestructiveReaders,ff9pbhj,t3_esegfp,1579717899.0,"So the piece read okay for me - the premise reminding me of Kvothe in the Name of the Wind series: a young-ish boy seeking to study the unknown in a dark environment. The Master here came off rather extreme, a super-scrooge and also, kind of just... weak? Like he's spattering all over the place, first slapping the kid for offering him money, then berating the kid for payment. It's all a bit grandiose for a not-so-grandiose spectacle in my opinion, at least if this is to be near the beginning of the piece. We have no idea what 'The Red' can do other than keep a dead dog alive, and not very well at that. Then our character jumps the gun at giving away his soul - whatever that may be in this world - to a seemingly gross Master who we may have no idea how talented of a teacher he is or what he can even do. 

I also found  your prose floundering on itself in more than one occasion, using ""Perhaps"" and ""As if"" too frequently - it will make the reader guess about the scenario, sure, but also if you have us guessing about your prose so much like in this piece, it will just produce *weak prose*."

The person who stared into the sun for 45 minutes also had their vision return to normal (6/5) you do realize that right?

Like, they all had their vision heal over time with lasting sunspots. That still sucks, that's a lot of damage, but it's not permanent blindness.

Literally not one single person in this study was defined as blind. They all passed the visual acuity portion.

I'm glad you provided the source though, it actually was interesting and took all of 3 minutes to read the 3 pages, but I know reading in much less fun than typing rants for you, and that's ok, to each their own.

DestructiveReaders,fek2tq2,t3_ep82g3,1579191416.0,"Hey! Poetry can be daunting to share, or re-read. I'll write sometimes and when I flip over some pages of things I've written long ago, sometimes I cringe in reflection. Sometimes I will read a page of what I wrote, and enjoy 3-5 lines of it as stand-alone-good writing, and the rest is taken with a healthy dash of salt. 

I find poetry fun to write, challenging at times, and can be very expressive to the point where we are able to write out emotions we can't quite grasp fully, and that can help us understand them (and ourselves) better - but this does not mean the reader will. And that's not always bad or wrong.

The first few poems fall into this blunder for me, as a reader. First, your language is kind of... scrambled, per se. My vocabulary isn't incredibly vast, but I never mind looking up a word or two - I enjoy learning new words.

&#x200B;

> Staccato-dotted sea of synapse impulse

Granted I knew what staccato meant, but I had to look it up again to see if there was another definition of it I had forgotten. If anyone can read this piece and directly relate what this line means, I would be surprised. We can slowly, a bit  strugglingly, begin to infer what is means. 

When in the workshop classes, poetry was often the least, \*and\* most judgemental as far as peer reviews. People don't want to tear apart another person's poetry, but there are also pieces with are so abstract and wrought with overly flowery language or cliches, one can't hold back.

I could not enjoy the first 5 poems much at all - they came off as writing exercises, or stream-of-consciousness without care for the audience. 

The strength of your diction is actually fine, but needs some tuning - but the biggest problem for me throughout the poems was the structuring. They kind of bumble around in terms of images, self reflecting, etc-  and I'm not given much substance to work as a starting pad. 

&#x200B;

>too non-subtle metaphors

Why? I mean, if  you are using a metaphor, it should be there for whatever purpose you give it. If you're going for subtlety, give it that purpose, and if not, don't worry or pay mind - you should be picking each writing device specifically and carefully, and not worrying about ""will the reader get this?"" because, more often than not, the reader is given less credit than they deserve when it comes to interpreting. 

This was the poem I was able to enjoy, and you should title it without the parenthesis

>Some days, blossoming trees and their wide-stretching arms are prettier than otherwise  
Sometimes I wake up and a brittle tapping of guitar strings that flow and surge into huge chords and phrases are all I need to feel complete

You see the difference in your opening pieces compared to this one? We have immediate imagery, immediate narrative ""lens"" in the fact that the language expresses some positivity (blossoming, prettier). It is clear, it's communicating effectively, and I like that. The only part that doesn't hold up to the rest is ""surge into huge chords and phrases"" because that does not sound musical, nor pretty to me. If you have to use ""flow"" *and* ""surge"" perhaps pick one or the other, or a better alternative. Phrases also detracts from the musical nature, unless you are talking about someone singing.

&#x200B;

>Some days every spoken word touches on some fundamental universal truth  
Sometimes I wake up and know with full confidence that today the world is mine and by letting my feelings well out over its open fields I will force it to yield, that since I love it everything will be okay

Repeating Some days works well for this piece. I would remove ""some"" out of ""some fundamental..."" because we want the word ""Some"" here to be impactful after each line break, and using it elsewhere (also here it makes fundamental truths seem less powerful) weakens it in my opinion. Again, your thoughts expressed here are much clearer than in the other poems, and even though it's still a bit imaginative, I'm not lost completely and just shaking my head not *wanting* to understand. It's honest.

Sometimes I wake up and find I've gone to Heaven; I live among angels and I transcend reality and I cannot do wrong, the Earth is a mere silhouette underneath

>And down there lives dissatisfaction. 

Dulcet touch didn't work for me in this, maybe that's due to my unfamiliarity with the word. Also, if you are going to break the pattern you've set up by including another line right after, I say go all the way, and make this last stanza even more unique. I like the ""transcend"" part but ""...reality and I cannot do wrong"" doesn't elicit the same transcending feeling for me.

I would reform / edit this stanza to such

Second, people use different terms for conversation. Why say central scotoma every time instead of sunspots? You're the one giving it an innocent connotation, not me. 

The one woman's vision returned to 6/6 acuity. I take it you read the article and understand that. Just in case though, it means she can see objects 6m away at the sharpness of 6m, opposed to her previous 6/9 from the sun damage weeks before.

The reason they are called sunSPOTS is because they are simply spots in one's vision. They aren't blinding everything. These people can still function.

They are not blind.

How can a blind person have 6/6 acuity? 

Again. They. Are. Not. Blind.

They have blindspots. Maybe some have it worse than others (likely) but the journal didn't delve into the extent.

It seems the eye is very sensitive (surprise) but like much of the body does an amazing job healing. However burning out rods / cones doesn't seem to end well.

This kind of furthers my belief though - you won't go ""blind"" looking at the sun, but you're going to fuck up your vision with blind spots. That would be so goddamn annoying I can't imagine. Even staring at a light for a second and turning away to see a green/red spot is annoying enough.

Yes while this is true, everyone should be under the lense. Even MLK had his less-than-flattering flaws.

And ghandi and George washing both DID have their flaws that I'm surprised you aren't aware of? Not suicidal lovers or broken people, but slaves and racism, reapectively (iirc). 

There's also a difference for me - I enjoy taking in art, or song, or whatever media, and absorbing it as is - then if it interests me enough I'll often look into the creator, and learn about them. That adds directive and scope and can be really eye-opening, or sometimes, a bit depressing. This doesn't *ruin* the piece of art for me, I'm a believer of once art is made, it's umbilical cord is sort of cut off from the artist - and people are more than free to interpret how they chose (sometime mistakenly or misled).

Finding out MLK was a habitual cheater doesn't lessen his social accomplishments, but it does diminish his character.

The reaction is definitely a ""fuck I'm an idiot"" by the guy, but that doesn't mean he had pure intentions or anything"

Yeah, could be that, could be something entirely different. What we DO know is the girl was extremely uncomfortable then, and after - she is heard saying (in response to watching the video with her boss) ""get the FUCK away from me"" to the fucking video... Like, that's how much her skin is crawling.

It's not just a cutesie oopsie, it's a -what the fuck are you doing cornering COWORKERS for a kiss- kinda thing. You know how you convey feelings? Well, hint - your first ""display"" shouldn't be god damned cornered-kiss."
VeigarMains,fe6ek0k,t3_en9gly,1578888566.0,"Hey! As a veigar main (one tricked it s7/8 to d3) in the ADC role I can say this about Pyke and Brand, and Veigar.

The *main* reason Veigar does not want an aggressive AP supp like brand is due to veigar already having more than enough damage for mid/late, and the desire to play more passive / poke / disengage early. Brand can't peel a Lee sin very well, or naut, etc. But brand does offer good ranged support and CC, but also compounds the weakness of an AP heavy team (so with an AP midn/ top, and Veigar adc, brand becomes yet another hero for the enemies to build cc against).

That said - the combo of brand W alongside veigar E (gate) is very, very oppressive versus lanes that fall in range (cait, aph, Senna can all evade this and poke in the process).

Pyke offers a lot of Pros for veigar - AD, CC - and the biggest boon is truly his sight. Veigar will die to roams from mid, jgl, etc, and if the lane isn't dead on sight, Pyke can roam and ward deep jgl / river. While in this role, you should be looking (early levels 1-5) to cover peel - hooking the enemy engage away , or simply threatening a pull during necessary CS moments (wave pushing close to turret). Levels 1-2 MUST be played passive, but from 3-5, it is ""Cc / poke"" and disengage. 6+ you have 1 shot potentials and BOTH veigar / Pyke should not be holding onto R for kills - use it for the damage asap in CC combos because you *know* one of you will be executing. 

This still suffers the same problem as brand - not a lot of disengage, nor cc. Enemy comps of Olaf, Morg, and heavy divers like fizz, Lee sin, etc will make Veigar prone to tilting when their supp can't easily peel.

Most of all, it takes practice, and syncing up styles. Sometimes you have a great veigar, a great Pyke, but one is one aggro and the other more passive, and it will turn into a feed fest. Don't duo with *anyone* if they tilt. You should duo to progress, learn, and climb, end of story.

If you do this, and do it a lot, you can climb even versus the harder matchups (cait + Morg would be the worst thing to see as veigar, as well as kog / ez)"
VeigarMains,fe6dslk,t1_fe27aft,1578887958.0,"I'll look at the vod later, but I believe comet is underrated. Veigar late game is primarily a monster BECAUSE of his 8 second cooldown, 3 second stun, 3 second duration gate. This means, for me, almost 80% of my engages after the 20 minute mark (when we begin to scale very well) are going to be with gate. I do play very aggressively, and my rathe lackluster K/D/A reflects that unfortunately (I think he can be played better with front-lining teamates that are not shy to engage).

Comet scales very well, has a low cd (can someone share numbers for it's scaling compare to aery / elec?) And does aoe, which is nothing to scoff at in team fights - which veigar really, really wants with the right composition"

leagueoflegends,fe5w6k0,t3_enw1cy,1578876307.0,"Yeah going to be hard. My suggestion is maximizing early pressure with grasp / biscuits build and poking hard - going non-dorans-item + pots. You aren't going to out scale, and you're vulnerable to ganks if you push.

At least with this set up you have the ability to bully and zone levels 1-3. Max E and not Q. Teemo  is more of a counter pick than a blind pick anyways, so you should avoid these harder patchups (rumble, etc)"
