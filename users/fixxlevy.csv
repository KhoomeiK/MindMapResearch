I actually felt somewhat bereft but within a week or so, new leaves appeared and grew very quickly so I now have three beautiful large leaves + a tiny wee bonus baby Yoda-esque one. My feeling is that I gave it too many nitrates because my Polly did almost the same thing at the same time. It’s not quite as rapid with the regrowth, though, so I’ve got one very proud and glossy new leaf thus far in the same period. Have you been over feeding it, perchance?
