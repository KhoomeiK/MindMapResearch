feminineboys,feermzy,t3_ekz1jp,1579039739.0,"Soo esthetician here, do you use a cleanser? The best way to take care of your skin is to cleanse, exfoliate (but make sure you are not over exfoliating it can cause further irritations and spread bacteria) *USE A TONER* and moisturize (after a shower so that your pores are more open and can absorb it better)  make sure you use an SPF moisturizer the sun is the #1 cause of most damaged skin.  But speak to a dermatologist and see what they say. They will likely put you on a pill that will exfoliate your skin more chemically. If so don’t get any waxing done it will rip your skin. But waxing is a good choice for semi permanent- permanent hair removal, the more the hair follicle is damaged the less hair it’s going to grow back. Hope I could help some!"

Wiggle is in a 2.5 right now because I wasn’t sure if he’s be able to swim to the top of my 10 gal. But now he’s doing so well I have been debating wether or not to test him in 5 out of the 10 gal. If you don’t mind me asking what was it that bucket didn’t like about the 10g? Was it just to difficult to get to the top for him? That’s my biggest concern for wiggle.
