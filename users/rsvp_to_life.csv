In all honesty we know what the technique to weight loss is. Count calories and eat less than your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure). If you don't know what your TDEE is there are any number of calculators to help you figure that out, or professionals will do it as well at any gym. 

I'm open to peoples conversations and views if they think this is wrong, but it seems to be the only solid evidence for losing weight."
