Dissociation,fejkwdp,t1_fejkl57,1579178342.0,"Based on what I experience:


You can have a strange feeling like you're not fully in reality. It can seem like a dream or that you're not in charge of your body. Your body moves, but you feel like you're just watching it. You look into a mirror and you're not sure if it's you. Your memories are in fog, it can feel like it happened years ago even though it happened yesterday. Or it can feel like the memories aren't yours, you remember things, but it feels like it wasn't you who went through it."

She doesn't understand me at all and doesn't even want to understand. When I say something about my feelings, she acts like it's not a big deal. She's not supportive. She invalidated my feelings many times. Screw people like this. It's probably just some entertainment for them on screens."
