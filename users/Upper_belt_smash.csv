If we completely buy your argument then all is lost and the only ones ok to do well are those already doing well. I think that‚Äôs a false choice. 

Yes the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù is probably lower than what we had in the 70s and 80s but I‚Äôd also argue that a lot of the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù is skewed against those in the middle class are are designed to suck away wealth towards the top. Namely things like student loans, credit cards, health insurance."

videos,feztft2,t1_feyh2r5,1579461430.0,Fun fact: the music is by Erik Satie I believe who was an eccentric French composer. This is from the Gymnopedie series of songs and were meant to be what he described as ‚Äúfurniture music‚Äù which is basically the first ‚ÄúMuzak‚Äù or background music. Meant to be ‚Äúheard but not listened to‚Äù. Satie hated the fact that the songs became popular because that went against their purpose. I think they are neat.

I have learned many different skills and I know how I learn best. That‚Äôs actually a skill in and of itself and I was explaining that part in response to another comment about not overwhelming yourself. 

When you seek out an instructor (in anything) you are seeking an expert in the skill not just some person to open the door and turn the lights on. If you don‚Äôt trust your instructor to show you what is important and help guide you then you need to switch instructors. 

To each their own though so if you think you learn best by watching a bunch of YouTube then have at it but in my experience those that do that also do a bunch of crap like flying armbars but don‚Äôt know the fundamentals. But again to each their own."

When people make comments like ‚Äúall politicians cheat or are corrupt etc‚Äù it only hurts those that actually want to help and doesn‚Äôt hurt those that are already shitty.
