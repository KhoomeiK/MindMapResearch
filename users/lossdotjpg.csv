This doesn't really mean anything, a lot of places didn't implement the tax correctly. I paid tax for unsweetened sparkling water and had to complain to get it fixed.

Anyway, the original point is that there is no reason for juice to not get taxed, which it didn't (juice-adjacent beverages non-withstanding)."

I definitely gained some (\~10lb) weight on it, but in retrospect that was because it really made it a lot easier to get to a state of comfort, and food/alcohol was the easiest (subconscious) choice. What really helped was getting after-work hobbies to distract me from food/provide mental stimulation which is why I didn't gain a bunch more weight.

The two crowds are very different, so you're also hedging your bets in case you fit into one crowd better.

I did look through your profile briefly, and I also want to point out that the west part of the loop is NOT west loop. West loop is approximately west of the river until Ashland. That being said, if you live in the loop you'll be next to both Blue AND Red line stations, which run 24/7.

Then set up an automatic monthly deposit to that account from your main checking for the rent amount, and pre-write the checks for the remainder of your lease, then just mail them out every month and don't even bother looking at the second checking account."
