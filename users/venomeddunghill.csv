shakespeare,fegt053,t3_ep2mba,1579101850.0,"Here's a quick rundown:

1. First things first: The play is a sophisticated satire of both numerology and the scientific method.
2. The manuscript of Twelfth Night was lost for centuries, and even when it was discovered it was initially assumed to be a forgery. The first full production of Twelfth Night was in 1978. (You could draw some interesting parallels between the play's approach to identity and society's misidentification of the play itself!)
3. The key to understanding the play is noticing that ""Viola"" and ""Olivia"" are anagrams of each other. Viola and Olivia, and sometimes Sebastian, are traditionally all played by one actor, with multiple *very* quick costume changes. Are they all just aspects of the mythic One, the Ur-character of which all of Shakespeare is an exploration? 

Good luck with your homework!"
