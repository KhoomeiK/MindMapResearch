I'm in betting league with a few dozen people, that doesn't use betting lines, so most people bet on the favourites.

I joined it 2 years ago and won both years so far, and how I differentiate myself is by spending a lot of times on the lesser known debut'ing or second fight guys that not much is known about.

You see two 8-0 guys fighting and they've got 'pickem' odds because there's no info  or one guy will be 7-0 VS a 5-2 guy, so the 7-0 gets way better odds, so I go through sherdog fightfinder, and I use like 'Swiss tourney rules' for tie breakers by looking at their opponents records, and then if need be go deeper, their opponents, opponents records.

So often you'll see one had real fights and one was padding, and often the 5-2 guy is the better bet, because he's actually been fighting real competition, like bellator or ex UFC guys while the X-0 guy has never fought anyone with a positive record."

As far as the language thing, trying to see things objectively, it seems bad from both sides (in some spaces obv not all), lesbians  maliciously misgender, because they know it's an insult, and use similarly degrading language. And the Trans side has their whole favourite 'terf' thing, and other equally degrading language. 

It's gotten pretty ugly. 

But I feel like people don't see it enough from the lesbian POV lately. They've had decades of men telling them they just haven't had the right man, and this sort of trope that 'the right dick will cure them'.

This to them, seems like yet another group of 'men' (which is likely why they misgender so much) now telling them they're bigots for not accepting that some girls have dicks, and to stop 'fetishizing' vaginas. 

I saw a post a cpl weeks ago, reminding lesbians that they should consider going on the pill because some women can get you pregnant now, and to respect that condoms can cause dysphoria.

Seems like Trans women seem to mostly keep their sexual preference when they transition. So there's a lot of them suddenly trying to jump into the lesbian ranks in a short period of time.

Lesbians obv often have an aversion to penises (Sometimes from abuse), so because of that, there's apparently not enough lesbian sexual partners available for the quickly growing ranks of the trans females, and causing tensions on both sides. It's been interesting seeing the trans side trying to find a way to phrase, *'you guys need to get over hating dicks'*, without saying that overtly.  A lot of *'Question the feelings you're having, and you might see they stem from cultural indoctrination that are inherently transphobic*"" or some such thing. Which is dangerously close to stating being gay is a choice.

It's a weird stand off with no easy answers, and I feel for both sides.  Not easy being trans, and finally being told everyone accepts you, but then being very limited in sexual partners. Or being lesbians minding your own business and then having a group, of people who were recently male, knocking on your door asking to be let into your sex pool, and everyone calling you bigots for not immediately complying.

A confident, good looking person, deprecating their looks, comes off the opposite; it's 'unauthentic' false modesty and conceited - it's the 'humble-brag' like you said.

But if it's too genuine, you're picking on your obvious flaws, and as you said, beating yourself up, you're either making people uncomfortable with your self loathing, or it's a thinly veiled compliment 'fishing trip'.

It sort of seems like walking a thin line, but I think it comes down to intention.  

Are you saying this to make yourself look good, or solicit praise? 

Then don't do it."

So often you'll top deck hand removal late game, and even if they have a couple cards left in their hand, often time it's land they've held back, or a cpl bolts they cast in response. So now at least this card isn't just a blank, and given the new mechanics it will often have a relevant target."

Izzet plays 7-8, 3 dmg bolts (and that new 4 dmg sweeper), as well as blast zone, brazen borrower.   

If this is a 4of main deck in an archetype, flash won't love it but it's an annoyance at most, it's certainly not going to kill 'flash'."

I thought Romero won his last fight, so the right guy gets the belt. And I mean a tiny alteration of one judges perception and Romero was supposed to be the guy fighting here anyway.

Also, despite the fact he's a genetic freak, he's gotta be coming up to his expiry. I thought when he lost that decision, that was it, there wasn't time or him to make another run, but now he gets his last chance."

Seems like a solid half the most famous painters/writers/artists in general of all time, when you look at their life stories were horrible people to one extent or another.

Look at Charles Dickens, and he's probably worse than anyone ousted in the MeToo era, but that's not what we focus on.

Sad fact is a lot of the most damaged people create some of the best art, that's not giving them a pass on their behavior, but if we try and pretend their creations aren't objectively amazing unless we make sure they haven't committed crimes that our current society deems unforgivable, it's a slippery slope with vague rules.

Ultimately it does have to come down to personal choice, it'd be nice to leave it there, unfortunately, other peoples virtue signaling involves attacking anyone else who doesn't agree with them for tacitly condoning the behavior."

It wasn't some person coming out of the woodwork to cast aspersions while a person is in the lime light, it was his own voice, there was no context you could frame it in, to make it anything other than what it was.

Considering his Christian base, I figured there was no way.

Even years later, I still can't quite understand it."
