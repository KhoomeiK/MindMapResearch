The problem is if you don't understand anything that his profile is saying, besides lying about age, it is cringy.

Im glad your post begins to do what needs to happen in this topic, which is separating the catalyst of the behavior (the attractive woman they are forced to pay attention to) and the root cause of their behavior.

They have personal issues, likely with women, that causes them to undermine the accomplishments she made in order to better perceive themselves. This is done easily by re-categorizing her from a position of respect (mentor, professor) to a peer-like place (a love interest, something to use). By objectifying her, they have brought her worth down to an approachable level.

THIS ALL ON THEM, THEY HAVE PROBLEMS. The world ALLOWING them to play into that is the biggest issue.

Is there a resource to use for determining a breed that fits your lifestyle?

Ive got a pretty good support network that would be able to care for the pup when Im working with lots of love and walks but the PNW isnt very walk friendly all year.

Im also not too keen on bigger breeds since I can imagine they put more wear on the environment but IDK.

I appreciate the response, this is all a new decision to fill the void my terminal (FIP) kitten will leave.."

Its pretty stereotypical in the USA that a woman can assault a man or practically anyone and receive zero physical defense. In fact it's still a pretty good bet that onlookers will DEFEND the offender if a man does fight back to protect himself.

  


So you can go ""die on that hill"" so to speak. That's on you but you're incorrect and I hope you'll learn that eventually even if it isn't us that reveal that to you."

You are right. We are also having this discussion in a ""justice porn"" type sub where the content is literally people getting what they deserve so it's a fantastic way to sort out the sexist asshats."

You gotta up the edge just a tad.

Weird how you have to get them alone to even talk to them at all if they are so grounded and you are so right about everything go approach in public and not when they are isolated and get ousted for the utterly disturbing pile of trash that they really are.

Just yesterday was a comment chain about being catcalled at **EIGHT** years old.... My kid I only see 4 days a month is 8 now and I am always trying to get my mind away from how little control I have in her life right now.

Maybe time it a little better and go on the 16th year so the pup is strong and connected when they go on their own and will do this for them in the new place and have quite a few years to be able to do it for them..

I never wanted a dog before reading this comment."

It would just be another check and since the functionality is already there to check if they have it, removing it from the drop table after activation shouldn't take too much dev time and testing would be easy in a qa environment.

  


I fucking hate this feeling, dropping a legendary only to find out its $1 item at you HAVE to pickup and drop or it will haunt your lost loot. Can't even delete them, have to go to a vendor.

I guess it's cool the dr had to get real thorough after you called them out, I hope they at least have you respect during that exchange.

  


I don't have insurance either and am pretty sure at 34 I'm going to learn a hard lesson about that choice... But I guess that goes with being afraid to hear the answers about why something hurts or you feel a certain way in your body.

  


Its all about being ready to deal with it. Congrats to overcoming so much and then standing up for yourself even more."
