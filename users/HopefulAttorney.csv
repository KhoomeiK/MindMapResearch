&#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/z7jO037](https://imgur.com/z7jO037)

&#x200B;

It's still my favorite, however there are problems with it for both newcomers and serie's veterans.

&#x200B;

\-The controls are unreliable, this is fine during the first half of the game when you don't really face too many fast or overpowered enemies, but it makes the second half of the game incredibly hard. For instance, quick turn is back from RE3, but you have to press down on the analog stick and *then* the run button, if you do these actions too close together it simply won't work or even worse, if you don't release the run button and then quickly press it again you will accidentally turn right back around when you push the stick back the other way. Also, small gripe, but there is no seperate auto aim button for explosive barrels, instead your character will automatically aim at an explosive barrel, even when it is incredibly close to you, or there are more immediate threats.

&#x200B;

\-The shot tracking in the game is off, again it's a problem you don't notice when you are facing zombies, but once you have to go up against bandersnatches or hunters it becomes a problem. for instance, I've had grenades arc over spider's and hunter's heads, six arrows blow right by a zombie, and two perfectly placed magnum shots clean miss a slow walking boss at close range.

&#x200B;

\-The guns are weaker and have a habit of ""whiffing""(shot firing, but nothing happens) way more often than the other games in the series. I once shot a Zombie three times in the stomach, I literally said ""Excuse me?"" outloud when it happened

&#x200B;

\-Enemies have certain death animations and they will only die in those death animations, so if you bring them down to zero hp and you don't hit them in their death animation you have to waste additional ammo to kill them. And if an enemy is dying or falling in front of you, there hit box will often block you from hitting any enemy behind them.

&#x200B;

\-Enemies have quick recovery times and can only be damaged in certain animations, so you get a lot of trading blows with Zombies and Bandersnatches. This also leads to 2 or more enemies being able to stun lock you and 80% of the time kill you. For instance, if you get cornered by 3 dogs they'll take turns biting you till you die. Carcinogen abandoned his no save, no damage run on the second part because there were way too many cheap shots, and he just pieced together a no damage run from save games.

&#x200B;

\-Zombies still go turbo, however unlike RE3, their tracking is incredibly percise and they'll often push through a crowd of zombies to bite you, or find you on another side of the room.

&#x200B;

\-The game is incredibly dark, I couldn't even see with the lighting turned all the way up.

&#x200B;

\-There are two bosses in the game that require you to use a scope, however the aiming mechanic is  slow and unresponsive so you'll often get hit trying to line up your shot. This is especially infuriating with Nosferatu because not only can he stun lock and kill you, but he also is only vunerable on his chest in certain animations, even if you hit him dead on in the heart.

&#x200B;

Having said that, the game is gorgeous looking and the fighting is fun once you get a hang of eccentricities of the mechanics and enemies. While I hated Steve \\, I really liked the Ashford twins and Rodrigo. I also loved Wesker coming back and his super human abilities, but was pissed you didn't get to fight him. The level designs were really on point and creepy too.

&#x200B;

\-I like how Claire woke up in media res of the attack on the base, it reminded me a lot of 28 Days later.

&#x200B;

\-The A Rank was the most challenging out of the original four and took me the longest to do, while that was mostly down to some crappy mechanics and enemy design, it was also because it was a really long and challenging game."

I'm doing Code Veronica right now and while the first disc is really easy, the second Disc, when Claire goes to Antarctica, ramps up the difficulty a lot. I mean it's a 50/50 chance whether or not I even get past Nosferatu and once I do I usually die due to the peculiar physics of the game which differs from the other three, like I died as Chris because a grenade shot arced over a Hunter. I haven't even gotten past Rockford Island as Chris and I've already restarted at the middle of game save so many times, though to be fair most of those restarts are because of Nosferatu. I know I can just use explosive arrows and kill him, but I really want to save the bow gun and explosive arrows for Chris."

fatlogic,fctiq54,t1_fcserz2,1577944655.0,"> Honestly, a lot of that happens even on this subreddit. A lot of people are fine with examining the things that FAs say that they personally disagree with but the moment something hits a little bit too close to home or challenges one of their own sacred cows it all turns into ""OMG you guize are such fatphobes! This place is turning into fatpeoplehate! I'm so sick of the biggits on this subreddit"" and so on and so forth. Of course, this subreddit is nothing like Voat or fatpeoplehate --- and not only because the moderators are pretty active here.      

  

There's a tension with this sub because there are Right and Left wing criticisms of FA/HAES and Fat Logic, which means we have differing thoughts on the causes of and the solutions to the obesity epidemic. The only comparable issue, in the US anyways, that we share somewhat of an agreement on is foreign policy.

&#x200B;

So where as I for instance would see it as a public health and food culture issue that's not entirely the individual's fault, someone on the Right might see it as a matter of will power and therefore something to take pride in, which makes them come off as haughty ,moralizing and somewhat mean spirited.

&#x200B;

The Right wingers would also see FA/HAES 's defects as caused chiefly by the nature of Social Justice itself, thus extending their criticisms to feminism, race advocacy, and LBGTQ politics. While a Left winger would see it as a well intentioned, but ultimately ill founded idea that doesn't reflect on the other parts of the movement."

For Analysis of Algorithms, I suggest reviewing Calc II (Especially summations) and Prob and Stats.

I'd also suggest taking a look at this guy's youtube videos over winter break as he explains the topics better than anyone I have ever seen and it tracks pretty closely with uml's course:

For OS, you happen to be in luck as you have your choice of two knowledgable and highly organized teachers, who scale somewhat generously, Wilkes and Moloney.

Moloney also puts all of his course materials online, including slides, if you wanna take a peek. I'n not sure if I'm allowed to link that, buf if you email him and ask permission I'm sure he'd be willing to link his archive if that's okay.

Good luck!"
