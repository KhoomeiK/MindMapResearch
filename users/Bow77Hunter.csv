Fishing,fcxbe38,t1_fcvvmpd,1578058203.0,If the run was year round I would have beat you to it
Fishing,fcxba0a,t1_fcw272o,1578058103.0,"I was lucky to meet someone who taught me a lot of his secrets. Not sure if it’s the bait, technique, or spot but there’s times we’re one of the few boats catching them. Have also been skunked a few times but it always seems like the bite comes in waves"
Fishing,fcxaw1t,t3_ej22al,1578057752.0,I smoke the fins from salmon too sometimes...especially springers. there’s a lot of oil in them...not a ton of meat but they come out really good
Fishing,fcxanm9,t1_fcwha02,1578057535.0,"Medium..I keep the smoker at around 130-150 using a mix of alder and hickory...takes 3-4 hours. Dry brined 24-36 hours in advance. Brine is mostly brown sugar and kosher salt with tablespoons of lemon pepper, cayenne, onion powder, and garlic powder. I put minced garlic and crushed red pepper on top right before throwing on smoker"
Fishing,fcx9yri,t1_fcwpzok,1578056874.0,Yes on a boat. I’ve never been to Fort Stevens. What are you fishing for?

Fishing,fcw7ss0,t1_fcvyrjg,1578019112.0,Use them for soup and pick the meat off...it’s actually the best meat of the fish. Same with salmon heads
Fishing,fcvl9q2,t1_fcvj7mu,1578004519.0,Definitely at least want to deep freeze these before eating raw
Fishing,fcvl42m,t1_fcvkezw,1578004420.0,Yeah I’ve always heard rainbow trout are fresh water version of steelhead. I can definitely taste a difference here and most the freshwater fish don’t get nearly as big
Fishing,fcvf066,t1_fcvehal,1578000713.0,True...all 4 of us got our limits so that’s always a GREAT day :)
Fishing,fcve2j7,t1_fcvd233,1578000162.0,I don’t eat rainbow trout but steelhead taste very similar to salmon to me and I love the taste...don’t waste any either..use the heads for soup. Appreciate you releasing if you aren’t going to eat them though👍🏻
Fishing,fcvbiyk,t1_fcv9xi1,1577998640.0,You’re probably right on it being spearfish...I specialize more on fish found in the PNW but decided I better take advantage of some offshore fishing for Marlin while there. Unfortunately we didn’t get any marlin but someone else on the boat got a good size yellow fin tuna

guns,fcpj4k1,t1_fcnx56u,1577865550.0,I just traced it then used a knife. The foam is multiple thin sheets so you cut as deep as you need and pull out the part you cut
guns,fcpcepz,t1_fcpc7e1,1577858144.0,There’s a reason I chose a couple of my cheaper guns for this
guns,fcpca2t,t1_fcoqfgj,1577858005.0,You can but the foam is cut so gun fits pretty tight so it might make it a little easier to pull out

guns,fcn7aqy,t1_fcn6z32,1577805134.0,I suppose but most people don’t carry magnets on them and then you gotta know where to hold the magnet. It’s mounted to wall studs pretty solid but I’m guessing if someone really wanted to get into it they would tear it to pieces. They would also be on camera doing it though

gardening,fcmzrwa,t1_fcmz2is,1577798978.0,Unfortunately I’m a Mariners fan so failure is the only taste I know lol. I was just driving through Boston this fall and as a sports fan I enjoy seeing historic fields so I did the Fenway tour. I also thought this was a great idea. Maybe Seattle needs to adopt this idea and bring some better karma our way😆

FoodPorn,fcltzbm,t1_fckkxo8,1577756413.0,Haha.. it had a fresh glaze of butter/olive oil
FoodPorn,fclttr3,t1_fckvp7y,1577756308.0,I’ve been thinking about smoking one for 2-3 hours then finishing it off in the oven. This one was still really tasty and moist with crisp skin but I’m curious if it would come out similar in a fraction of the cook time.
FoodPorn,fclpd9d,t1_fcl7k75,1577753223.0,I haven’t. I really like the hickory flavor but I’ll have to try experimenting sometime.
FoodPorn,fckeig2,t1_fckdinm,1577723538.0,This was a little over 20 pounds btw so about a half hour per pound at 250.
FoodPorn,fckdz7w,t1_fckdinm,1577723193.0,Took about 10 hours at 225-275 shooting for 250 most of the cook. Offset smoker using charcoal with a few sticks of hickory for the smoke flavor. I also brined and brushed with olive oil/butter mixture every couple hours

hiking,fcbpelv,t1_fcaar7n,1577589505.0,Like others mentioned you can’t camp and it’s a rather short scenic hike that’s good for families so it can be busy especially when wildflowers and huckleberries are out. It’s worth a stop though if you’re heading to Rainier from the east on Chinook pass. Just be sure to have your National park pass already because there isn’t an entrance station. Rainier has some good camping/backpacking areas not too far from there as well.
hiking,fcb8qqv,t1_fca2423,1577583833.0,Thank you! Yeah that’s an awesome view too when it’s hugging the hills rolling in :)
