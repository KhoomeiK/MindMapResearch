I love how Walmart pulls this game honestly. I remember in Quebec (Canadian province), a place populated by the French (notorious complainers; love to unionize and maximize salary vs workload), a Walmart opened and immediately the employees tried to unionize. If I remember correctly Walmart not only closed the store for a few months they just walked away. Instantly. Building built and all and they just dropped it. 

Some say waste of money, I say sets a precedent that they aren't scared to walk away and frankly I loved it."

Why are American ships patrolling the Arabian sea might be a better question to ask yourself. They are in a situation where individuals who border those waters may feel they are being encroached upon...

Saying this as a Canadian too."

They went from being bullies to being sanctimonious and now their content is frankly quite boring."

There is almost no possibility Capone would kill or hurt someone he lent an enormous sum of money to who returned it, in full, after 'truthfully' telling him the scam didn't work out.

At best the guy gets 5k, at worst, he gained Capone's trust (through deception, funnily enough) and Capone won't forget him."
todayilearned,fdi1jgx,t3_elfc3c,1578434095.0,"I don't agree with this mentality.

Growing up in poverty isn't a product of mean parents, there's just no other option. If you grow up with wealth, sure, don't spoil your kids, but you want to show them what you didn't have, give them the finer things, and try and give them a head start.

I grew up with relatively wealthy parents and my buddy told me something very insightful. I often felt guilty about my wealth and tried to play it down or not accept free stuff/advantages to match my friends. He said don't turn it away, prove you're worthy of inheriting it and you'll do with it what most won't. 

He's right. With my dad's help now we've started a real estate company (that I found and brought my dad into) and I am being smart with money. Being wealthy is wonderful and I hope to provide it to my kids. I won't buy them senseless shit, but I want to give them good meals when they are young and teach them the importance of money and how to preserve, and later earn it."
todayilearned,fdf1a0l,t1_fdf16nk,1578351040.0,"Agreed. The richer people are the more they track their money too.

I'm sure he had his reasons though; maybe testing character with large sums of money brought people around him he eventually found he could trust and they would earn him ten times as much later."
todayilearned,fdeuwl9,t1_fdepxne,1578347108.0,So capone trusted a guy he was almost convinced would rip him off with 770K... Just to test his character... Damn Capone had money and did NOT care.
AskReddit,fdd02gn,t3_ekgic7,1578289561.0,"Another one:

Complaining about the environment but supporting companies and practices that entirely contribute to environmental damage such as travel, eating foods at supermarkets, wearing clothes, buying expensive technologies, literally everything.

I am not a climate change skeptic, I am a human skeptic. Everything we do contributes to climate change and many do it unknowingly but preach to the high 9s about how we should all do better. Those lululemon pants? Made in china shipped on a tanker. Your mac laptop? parts made in china and I guarantee 1 or 2 ships have sunk and those parts pollute the ocean. The car you drive? Foods you eat? Air pollution and palm forests. Get off your high horse, live your life to make yourself relatively happy, and just do your best to try and preserve climate. All that can be done and asked from each of us."

True self-acceptance is accepting who you were born as and what you are and coming to terms with your strengths and flaws and finding happiness not by chasing what you are not, but by relishing in what you are..."

Our neighbours come to our door maybe once every three years and that's if shit's going down. Always worth checking the door. There's nothing wrong with telling the salesman you aren't interested very quickly once you do."
