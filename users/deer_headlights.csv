Edit: ok I see it now. Under the map after you return to aim hub. Oops."

ElizabethWarren,fekn0qz,t1_fek8dsn,1579203442.0,"I agree they should ask candidates difficult questions and make them accountable. 

That was not what happened in this debate."
WayOfTheBern,fej49x4,t1_feivf15,1579156340.0,"Sanders would never think like that. His actual inner monologue:

""This hurts my heart and I wish I had a way to heal the movement and move forward.""

Bernie is ahead of the curve for everything that is right because he cares more about others than his pride. He has a deep empathy for other people and I believe even in his obvious point of frustration he was focusing on others and his empathy toward their concerns. 

This is the man who in the 2016 campaign was screamed at by BLM protestors and instead of being upset he requested that they have a moment to explain their case. Afterwards he organized meetings with them and listened to their excellent points. He then invited leaders from BLM to join his campaign team as staffers to help shape a better America for all."

Thanks for doing a giveaway. Stuff like this is a cool part of the community."
ElizabethWarren,feis9rk,t1_feir95y,1579145908.0,The phrasing of the question. They were trying to antagonize.
ElizabethWarren,feiov0k,t1_feinpr5,1579143565.0,I suspect this person is calling out CNN for the debate moderation that was structured in a way that many people feel was forcing an angry exchange between Warren and Sanders.
SandersForPresident,fef5iq9,t1_feeymj1,1579048668.0,Thank you
CFL,fdp57xw,t1_fdowpun,1578620280.0,"Jokes on us, he is telling them the truth."
FortniteCompetitive,fdd6aph,t1_fdd3728,1578296683.0,"There was a YouTube video by Linus umm Tech tips guy. He had shroud, another pro player, a noob, or something like that. They all tested 60, 144, and 240 Hz. The pros did as good and could not see the difference between 144 and 240. I love tech, faster equipment and all but if the pros are not seeing a difference... Maybe it is good enough at 144.

Plus shave a ms off your monitor but your network latency is still 60 ms.. who cares."
todayilearned,fdcchbm,t1_fdcabo6,1578271574.0,"If they are not taking it off, that is a safety risk and should be reported as such."
todayilearned,fdcbz61,t1_fdaeapn,1578271261.0,"Technically every person who can register as an engineer can get a ring. Foreign student who graduated from an unrecognized institution? Apply for an academic review and after some tests or upgrade classes, register as an EIT and get a ring by attending a ceremony. But the ceremony and ring are optional for all"
todayilearned,fdcb0d7,t1_fdajekz,1578270679.0,"""Professional Engineer"" is protected. The term engineer in other areas of work where there is no confusion with that of a ""Professional Engineer"" is fine. See Microsoft certified engineer as an example. In other words, don't believe all that your self regulated professional organization tells you and find the case law."
FortniteCompetitive,fd6u7d3,t3_ek60zw,1578195767.0,"I get poor ping (60-70) but I have used this 

https://www.speedguide.net/downloads.php

It optimizes the windows 10 stack for low latency and high performance. Then connect a high quality Ethernet cable directly to the last device inside your house before it goes to your internet provider (no switches or routers in between). With those things I am getting 50-60 in game. It is not much but it helps. (One day I will be rid of the crap 2wire router....)"
FreeGamesOnSteam,fczobg1,t1_fczo1h9,1578105606.0,"Huh, ok I will install it overnight tonight (internet connection is still not great) and give it a go. Thank you for the recommendation."
FreeGamesOnSteam,fcznf4d,t1_fczm9rc,1578105035.0,"I like the build aspect, though the battle royal is cool. I have watched a lot of pubg on Twitch and would love to give it a go but I do not know anything about the weapons and all these attachments and whatnot. Daunting."
FreeGamesOnSteam,fczlym5,t1_fczlgm2,1578104125.0,"I understand it is not for everyone. I have never had good enough internet for online games so all the fps or shooters I played in my past were solo. I have now tried others but I love the challenge of trying to build fight. I am old, slow, and not great but when you can drop a cone to block someone and open it up fast to kill them with a pump shot to the face... It may not be gory and is cartoony but it feels cool. Plus I like gaming with other people and chatting in between fights. (I am not competitive so I dun care much when I die... Though I have cursed lol)"
FreeGamesOnSteam,fczgsfd,t1_fczg7s8,1578100918.0,"Haha thanks! I been gaming since the colecovision days. I have played them all. I just have been sucked into this game for too long. Outside of finishing other games alongside still dropping out of the battle bus, I have been mostly into fortnite. (Loved red dead 2 for ex)"
FreeGamesOnSteam,fczbvpm,t1_fcz5vlr,1578097795.0,Thank you kindly. I appreciate that.
wherearetheynow,fcz3u1t,t3_ejjbel,1578093109.0,Anyone who claims to be from the future on Reddit is not. Don't pay him any attention
FreeGamesOnSteam,fcy9f50,t3_ejf6n9,1578076614.0,Been an awesome week. Today happens to be my birthday so I intend to spend lots of time gaming. I mostly play fortnite (poorly) so it should be fun.

WayOfTheBern,fcvz96y,t1_fcvxf0n,1578013493.0,I have watched his specials and soaked up most of his content. I just don't remember this particular phrase. I will try some googling.
WayOfTheBern,fcvv8ci,t1_fcvqvuu,1578010862.0,"I tried a Google search for this but all I found was a tweet by someone second hand who said they saw him at a show and Dave said he is backing Yang. Dave has only once backed someone politically and that was an old friend. I doubt Chapelle is backing anyone at the moment. 

Realistically we should never follow a politician because of any celebrity no matter whether we like their work or not. Do as Bernie suggests and back policies, find candidates who want those policies and cast your vote."
WayOfTheBern,fcvumwz,t3_ej1xwl,1578010479.0,"Anybody got a source on where/when he said this?

Thanks to /u/ZinnRider providing information I found the source.

OP's picture is not an exact quote but pretty darn close (meaning is maintained just some comedic fill removed)"

politics,fciw0el,t3_eh9muv,1577671153.0,Over simplification and generalization is bad no matter the end of the political spectrum from which it comes.
funny,fcihol2,t1_fchzu19,1577662717.0,Upvoted your comment in the hopes that others will follow and your most upvoted comment ever will be spouting facts!
BernieSanders,fc77aeb,t3_egiw3p,1577499438.0,Man I hope she ascends to the position of president one day. Her intellect and care for others is something to admire in a leader.
AskReddit,fc3f3ih,t3_efqzp6,1577388403.0,"Started a new job and was eager to help my boss. Got an email from her asking me to buy $1000 of Google play cards. Bought them but realized it was a scammer before sending. Now I have $1000 on Google play cards that the retailer said they will not return, google told me they don't care. I have no use for these and a big credit card debt. Wonderful."

BernieSanders,fbzn795,t1_fbzj5qb,1577252545.0,Sadly she is going to endorse Biden. Just as she went Clinton in 2016
InsideFortnite,fbjwh5m,t1_fbjvqgk,1576941139.0,Haha cool. Thanks for setting something like this up.
