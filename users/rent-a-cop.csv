The FBI lists the stats in their website. White supremacists are the biggest group of domestic terrorists in the united states. That group is filled with right wingers.


>""Biggest"" aside -- do you deny Antifa commits acts of violence against innocent people and destroys property?


They probably do but I have yet to see the numbers. As it stands, white supremacists are the ones with the terrorism issue so bad that they have statistics for them.
