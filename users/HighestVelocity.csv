I like to listen to vlogs on YouTube because it makes me feel less alone. I don’t actually watch them though because I can’t get interested, I just have them in the background.

AskWomen,fdkmpo6,t1_fdiupv4,1578506762.0,"Not OP but here’s what I did. 

I’ve always had extremely bad social anxiety but I wanted to go out and do things but I didn’t have any friends to go with me..so I had to learn to to thing myself.

One week the internet went out at my house so I decided it was the perfect chance to go to a McDonald’s and download some movies. That was my first time eating alone.


I also started shopping on my own. It was pretty easy but I did have my fair share of random panic attacks... 


One year there was a haunted house event thing going on and no one would go with me and I didn’t want to miss it so I went by myself! They were sending people in groups though and I didn’t have one so the couple in front of me said I could go with them. It was awkward because I never said a word to them but I’ve always appreciated that they did that.


The last thing that gave me confidence was, I was looking for my brother at a fair and when I spotted him, I just started quickly walking towards him without paying attention to the people around me and it turned out that I was heading straight for another dude in the way and the dude moved and apologized. It was the first time that someone had moved out of my way...so ever since then, I make a point to walk with purpose, with my head held high, and act like I know exactly where I’m going. Just doing that has helped me a lot and people tend to move out of the way instead of bumping into me all the time like they used to."
