YouShouldKnow,fcuk4ep,t1_fcuiwka,1577982819.0,">BitWarden is not self hosted. You *can* self host it

True. 

>but there isn't any reason to for most. 

I beg to differ here. When compared to most other password manager offerings, Bitwarden stands out by being open-source and providing the option to self-host. It seems to me that a lot of people who choose Bitwarden for the former reason will end up using the latter. Meaning that those who assign importance to it being open-source will also probably self-host it. 

>BitWardens free tier will give you all the features you need, and is dead simple to use.

I agree. Then again, by and large, Bitwarden is pretty well-known in circles in which people are not opposed to getting their hands dirty at the command line."
YouShouldKnow,fcug0k0,t1_fcudrnh,1577980069.0,"Right. But for a lot of people, setting up a self-hosted solution is not something they'd be willing to spend time and money on. Besides, if you don't know what you're doing, you could leave a lot of openings for bad actors to gain access to your password database when you try to self-host. So there's definitely a learning curve to it."
YouShouldKnow,fcu2klu,t1_fcu1o5g,1577970551.0,"That's true. It's definitely a lot easier to use a hosted password manager. Also, since most people have a Google account, syncing with Google Drive is almost effortless."
YouShouldKnow,fctxa4f,t1_fctx0k0,1577964209.0,">If only more sites accepted U2F.

Exactly. The implementation is lacking. Also, there seems to be some issues with using U2F keys on Safari. 

>Interestingly, Amazon Web Services don't allow you to sign in from a mobile device when you have U2F enabled... (As I found out the other day).

I see. Good to know. Thanks for the info."
YouShouldKnow,fctv8cm,t1_fctud9s,1577961271.0,I see. I've been using Syncthing for about 2 years now to sync my ebook library between the laptop and the phone. Has worked really well.
YouShouldKnow,fctv32j,t1_fcts65s,1577961057.0,"The service provider needs to provide that option. You'll usually find it under the name of Security(or something along those lines) in the account settings. Try to avoid the SMS-based OTP though as they are vulnerable to SIM swap attacks. Use TOTP with an application like Aegis, Duo, or Authenticator."
YouShouldKnow,fctujzc,t1_fctql3b,1577960270.0,"Reset the password to all the accounts for which you've been using the old password. By and large, use different passwords for each account. 

>does resetting my password and using 2FA from now on help or is is too late already?

As I've mentioned above, if you've changed the passwords to all accounts for which you were using the old password, and if you've enabled 2FA, preferably TOTP based, then you're fairly safe. Do try to start using a password manager. That way, you can generate a ridiculously long and fairly random password for each account. You also have the option of setting an expiry date for the password. If you're willing to go that extra mile, get a U2F security key(like a Yubikey) and use that for 2FA."
YouShouldKnow,fcttmkn,t1_fctrzd7,1577958886.0,I use KeePass paired with Syncthing to synchronise the key file and database between devices. It has worked well without any issues so far.
linuxadmin,eil2qho,t3_b1afrj,1552655577.0,That seems like one of those free domain names that FreeDNS provides.
