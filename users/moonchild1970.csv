MakeNewFriendsHere,fcl3d88,t1_fckxo73,1577738921.0,"It’s because people stiffen in front of a camera. Never let them smile unless they’re really old or young because that’s hella cute. I always just chat to them, pretend like I’m not taking many photos and I take them when they’re relaxed and least expecting it. Another life hack is to get them to wear a mask if it’s a fashion shoot. Covering their face is they’re shy is always a bonus. You can convey a lot through someone’s body
I’ll attach my first photoshoots I ever did"
