Edit: it is the same one. The review from this post is the top review on the pad I bought!

IdiotsInCars,fd3ncvv,t1_fd3cudi,1578159951.0,"That guy had some skill to recover from the spins. 

Live PD showed a case where the officer didn’t execute a PIT very well and took himself out of the chase instead of the target."
IdiotsInCars,fd325ia,t1_fd27ir7,1578154036.0,"It wasn’t my intent to get into a debate about the subtleties of performing a PIT, but here’s what an industry group has to say about it: (pursuitresponse.org)

“The PIT technique requires approaching the fleeing vehicle diagonally from behind. The pursuing officer must match the speed  of the fleeing vehicle as closely as possible. With a slight impact, the officer maneuvers the vehicle to gently push the suspect’s rear bumper, with the intent of sending it into a spin. The officer’s vehicle continues forward as the suspect’s vehicle is disabled.


The abrupt change in thrust direction of the fleeing suspect’s vehicle will typically stall the powertrain, which essentially ends pursuit. The often stunned suspect can then be taken into custody.”

Edit: I’m not a LEO and don’t proclaim to be a PIT expert. Just made a random internet comment!"
