fsu,ff878kb,t3_es6twx,1579667984.0,In my experience (one semester for what it's worth) it's not that hard to find fun things to do with your friends besides drinking. ASLC movies and Club Downunder events are the easiest ways to have fun without drinking.

If I'm not in class or getting food, I'm in the library working on school work. I try to fill up as much time as I can with focused, intentional work. When I'm working I don't use my phone. The pomodoro technique is a very useful strategy. I don't use a timer for it anymore because I'm used to the system now and just have a general feel for it. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). Hope this helps"
