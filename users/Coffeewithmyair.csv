TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffb6f0n,t3_esns9n,1579753032.0,I’ve had 2 IUDs placed and both were unbearable pain for a few days. The first one I was laid up for a couple days and I’m someone who thinks tattoos aren’t painful and recovered quickly from multiple surgeries.
Broadway,ffb5qtx,t1_ff9ak11,1579752517.0,I’m seeing it Sunday. So excited!!
fatlogic,fek3nw9,t1_fejxep7,1579191925.0,And as a fellow short woman pants that are too long and drag aren’t flattering. Especially when your heel catches on the back of your too long skirt and you trip *not that it happened to me last weekend or anything*
fatlogic,fek38zd,t1_fejtk2d,1579191676.0,"I have the exact same experience. Being able to say no to an outfit because of something other than “this makes me look fat” is such a great feeling.  Something like pants not having pockets, or too short for work or not the right color feels so much better because it’s not my fault. I would buy clothes I hated before if I felt they hid my fat and spend hours distressed trying to find something to wear. Now I’m more confident and can try styles I would never dream of before. And yes, flattering doesn’t mean fat phobic. I once saw a girl wearing jeans that zipped all the way around to the top of the ass and thought no one would look good in those. The girl was beautiful....the pants...not so much."
fatlogic,feh0w3e,t1_fegnevw,1579106811.0,I tried wearing some old pajama pants the other day thinking it doesn’t matter since I’ll be sleeping. They fell off walking to bed. Time to purge those PJs lol.
1200isplenty,feexurp,t3_eoqai2,1579043589.0,OMG you are my hero. I’ve been craving no bake cookies forever!!
loseit,fee6anp,t3_eolqek,1579027285.0,"r/1500isplenty and r/1200isplenty have great recipes that can help. If your main concern is portions get a $10 food scale off Amazon and weigh and log everything you eat/drink (I like the free lose it app). You can’t outrun a bad diet, but if you’re looking for free safe indoor exercise you can find walking videos on YouTube or other exercises that may be easier on your ankle such as yoga."
fatlogic,fedxhva,t3_eomg76,1579021970.0,"One of my friends is trying to lose weight and asking for advice, but doesn’t take it. She told me she’s not eating enough and wants to add calories even though she’s not hungry. She is underestimating her calories and saying “well I don’t eat it all so it doesn’t matter that my estimates are off.”  Extra frustrating is she tries to give me advice that I don’t ask for. I lost 100 pounds last year and focusing on specific training and maintenance. She’ll tell me “you need to tone up and stop with the cardio bullshit.”  She’s convinced starvation mode is a thing and she’s not losing weight so she wants to add calories since she’s “starving herself”

Sorry thanks for letting me rant."
running,fedsb16,t3_eomqad,1579018824.0,Hey fellow turtle runner!  I signed up for my first half in December and my top speed is about 9:30/mile. Even though you had a difficult race you’re bravery in sharing inspires me. You did it!  You completed the race and lived to tell the tale. My furthest long slow run so far is 5.5 miles so 13.1 seems impossible. My race has a 15 minute mile pace max so I’m terrified I’ll be swept off the course if I have to walk.
loseit,fedm58k,t1_fec96e8,1579014911.0,"So this is where I previously failed and am currently maintaining. Weight loss is one goal and one metric, but it’s important to find other metrics and goals. I did couch 2 5k last year and I have goals to improve my time and run a half marathon this year. Other goals can be mindfulness, stretching, trying new activities that are healthy, meditating, sleep goals, and whatever else speaks to you. 

OP: sometimes our minds don’t see the changes and other times our goals won’t give us the expected outcome in terms of our physical figure. Losing weight is one part, but toning can give you that flatter stomach and arms. I lost about 100 pounds and have loose skin. I did have it removed surgically on my stomach and breasts, but my thighs are still flabby and I’m learning to accept it. My body will never be “perfect”, but I’m amazed at what I can do now and how I feel. When you’re feeling down take stock in the non-physical appearance changes you’ve achieved so far. You’ve got this!!"
1200isjerky,fe49ax8,t1_fe3pcrb,1578856963.0,Makes the afternoon meetings just fly by.
1200isplenty,fe3lvvi,t1_fe3bu57,1578850508.0,I tried the peach ones last week and loved them and felt like I got so many!  Just need to get more now. I read the sour patch kids are disappointing though.
fatlogic,fe2rzti,t1_fe01djq,1578842254.0,"As someone who lost 100 pounds my boobs were still huge and saggy. I did get a breast lift and even removing the extra skin I’m sitting at a 34DD/34DDD. However, I didn’t get my surgery until I hit my goal weight and my surgeon was super happy with my overall health and size and I had an easy recovery. He wouldn’t have performed the surgery at my high weight."
delta,fdoaf7q,t3_emepn8,1578601658.0,Me please!  I have a bunch of flights coming up!
delta,fdggabc,t3_el6bs7,1578395470.0,If you have any left I’d appreciate one!  I’m flying Thursday!
PlasticSurgery,fdf8vwb,t1_fdeyq9t,1578356031.0,"I had an extended tummy tuck, muscle repair, lipo, and a breast lift for around 15k."
fitbit,fda1dk9,t3_ekdez8,1578240577.0,"I have a Fitbit versa 2 and decided to run on the treadmill, use my half marathon training, and amazon music. The pace was WAY off saying I’d gone a 1/4 mile when my treadmill said a mile. It said my mile pace was over 72 minutes per mile (jogging at 5 mph). Did I just have too much open?"
bodyweightfitness,fd97cjx,t1_fd6yw5f,1578229484.0,Thank you!
bodyweightfitness,fd6lgr6,t3_ek0j4h,1578192744.0,"When I first went from massively obese to my current goal weight I made myself a deal. Every day I would at least get dressed in my workout gear. If I REALLY didn’t want to work out I could skip it. I think I did that twice (and probably on days I needed a rest day). Eventually when getting myself dressed was an easy enough goal I decided I’d at least get on my treadmill. If I was too tired after a half a mile I could quit. The goal was never run 5 miles daily, but make an effort. Once I did my mini goal I usually hit a larger goal. 

Whenever I tried to be “perfect” in a goal I tended to fail. My mini goals changed as my long term goals changed, but understanding that every positive change made me better overall. I changed my mindset from focusing on my failures to focusing on my successes."
loseit,fd3fndy,t1_fd2u10w,1578157824.0,When I eat healthy foods it’s amazing how much food I can eat for the calories. One method some people use instead of the standard 500-1000k deficit is to eat at the maintenance calories for their goal weight while losing so you don’t have to reduce your calorie intake as you lose weight. If you’re confident in your accuracy of your calorie counts and are not feeling deprived this approach could work for you. For me it’s always been harder to maintain after weight loss so I used this approach and I’ve been easily maintaining after losing 100 pounds.
loseit,fd3ee4g,t1_fd3cgly,1578157530.0,As long as you’re hitting your target calories the timing doesn’t matter. I do intermittent fasting and sometimes OMAD so I don’t eat breakfast and often skip lunch if I know I’m eating more for dinner.
fitbit,fcusy3b,t3_eiwo7x,1577987880.0,I love all the watch bands (check amazon) for the versa 2. I have some dressy ones and sport ones. I’ve had no issues syncing with my iPhone.
loseit,fcrqb4e,t1_fcrq0cd,1577905190.0,"Yeah I’ve been traveling a lot for work and a lot of mandatory restaurant meals so it adds some challenges in general, but I’ve maintained within 3 pounds of my UGW since September. I’ve thankfully found what seems to work for me but it’s a lot of managing indulgences and being mindful. Being short makes it so freaking hard."
loseit,fcrpgpn,t1_fcrp1kp,1577904866.0,"Hiking is one of my (and my dogs) favorite activities. I was out of town so no pups this weekend, but normally I visit this town and eat and drink all weekend. It was nice to have a great meal, but stay on track calorie wise. Maintenance is a fun beast to manage."
loseit,fcrn0bl,t1_fcr50ja,1577903940.0,Yeah craft beer calories (especially my favorite Belgians) add up quickly. Fellow shortie and beer lover commiserating. I did a 13 mile hike Saturday to offset dinner and drinks at a Belgian restaurant. #worthit
fatlogic,fcr9riv,t1_fcr9iqv,1577898836.0,"My first 5K I had a 45 minute time back in March. This half has a minimum 15 minute mile pace or you’re kicked off so super scared, but I guess I have awhile to train."
fatlogic,fcr8oqs,t1_fcr8gvy,1577898393.0,"So not impressive to most, but 32 minutes. I just signed up for a half in December so I need to step up my game. Not that bad considering a year ago I was 100 pounds heavier and couldn’t even imagine walking a 5K."
fatlogic,fcqwsjm,t1_fcl4ofr,1577893406.0,"Just had to brag somewhere that people would understand, but I got second in my age group today!  First time ever placing!!"
safe_food,fcqt5en,t1_fcqjsgv,1577891807.0,The oh snap brand is awesome. There’s a local company that makes them near me and have a cute Mastiff as their logo so I buy those a lot.
loseit,fcoiybf,t1_fcn39qk,1577833376.0,Remember what you learned as you lost weight before. You’ve learned a lot and that’s not lost. Remember it’s a forever journey so you haven’t lost the war just a battle.
loseit,fclp01s,t1_fcl26lk,1577752973.0,"You can also set a weekly calorie budget instead of a daily calorie budget and it helps to plan for indulgences that will happen. I went on a trip this weekend and splurged a bit (2200 calories) but today was a nice 1200 calorie day to offset it a bit. Just like your financial budget some days you spend more than others. Just because you paid your rent on the first doesn’t mean you failed your budget, but the rest of the month you’ll likely not spend as much on a day by day basis. 

By planning the nights out and it keeps me from feeling like “oh I went over so now I may as well eat everything”."
safe_food,fcll6gv,t1_fclek3n,1577750363.0,"I’ve only tried a brand called from the ground up and the nacho cheese flavors. They aren’t as intense of a flavor as cheese it’s, but lots of flavor and really feels like a nice amount of food."
safe_food,fckohr3,t3_eholsg,1577729769.0,"Cauliflower crackers (44 to a 110 calorie serving), fiber one cookies/brownies, sugar free pudding, spicy pickles, individual portioned normal cookies (iced animal crackers are my current go to), seaweed snacks, individual packs of almonds, skinny popcorn, and jerky are my favorites."
fatlogic,fcknus2,t1_fcknrkg,1577729376.0,Thank you. Enjoy your run. I’m trying to get into trail races as I love hiking in general!
fatlogic,fcknhx2,t1_fckm1kb,1577729151.0,This!  I’m running a 5K on New Year’s Day and people are asking about me skipping staying up and drinking. It’s as though the new year won’t happen unless I’m partying.
loseit,fcfimjr,t1_fccg172,1577630388.0,"This is exactly where I had lost so many times before. I’d hit my goal weight and it would be time to celebrate with food. I’d gain back the weight very quickly. 

Over the past year I hit my goal weight and have been maintaining for a few months. I just changed the goals to fitness goals and keep finding new goals once I reach my current ones. 

For anyone starting out whether you have 5 pounds or 500 to lose find other goals and milestones along the way."
loseit,fc38e5t,t1_fc33djp,1577383942.0,"There are a lot of lower calorie noodles. Zero noodles, zucchini, black bean, and beet noodles. I love them by themselves, but you can also do a half and half mix to get the volume of pasta you’re looking for."
loseit,fc31nmn,t1_fc2td6o,1577379400.0,"Calorie counting can be so freeing as well. It can take out the “bad” food beliefs and allow you to eat anything you want as long as it fits your goals. Friday night pizza and beer night?  Eat light during the day and have a few slices and a couple beers. Wanting to eat a lot?  Cauliflower rice and grilled chicken and you can eat a really satisfying meal. Giant note: certain foods can cause fluctuations on the scale which can be a bit daunting, but if you’re sure on your calorie count it’s easy to say eh it’s water weight from the salty can of soup yesterday and it’ll correct itself in a few days. 

Good luck!"
