wholesomereddit,ffdgzma,t3_esn84x,1579820664.0,My boyfriend's mom loves memes. She sends them at least 3x week. And they are usually on point. Unfortunately for me they are in Russian. But the translations are hilarious.
Showerthoughts,ffdgrd0,t1_ffcu2c0,1579820527.0,Exactly. The thrill of drinking and dancing in public with other who are doing the same thing? It does something to the brain. That's why we have music festivals I guess.
Showerthoughts,ffdgmdh,t3_esxw00,1579820446.0,That's why I do it at home. Still trying to get my bf on the same page.
catsareliquid,ffdgbz3,t1_ffd909w,1579820280.0,"Fellow cat lady. I'm sorry about your loss (of Meow to cancer). Thank you so much for being kind to cats. I'm from NY and people in nyc area treat strays like shit, so my boyfriend and I rescued a pregnant cat who was literally begging on the street while we were living in Queens. We took her in, she gave birth on one of my living room pillows, and had four beautiful kittens! We were living in a tiny studio at the time. We got all of them shots and took them all to the vet. We kept one kitten because we already had a Maine Coon. Got the rest adopted to good homes. You will get though this. Thank goodness for Tila!"
catsareliquid,ffdfhhs,t1_ffcyidx,1579819781.0,I'm so sorry for your loss. I also lost my floofy kitty a few years ago due to a congenital disease. It is heartbreaking. She was a rescue and I miss her everyday. I still have my other rescue though. I literally found him on the street in Queens NY- adopted him and marched to the vet and demanded shots and an exam. Got everything I wanted!

birthcontrol,ffclvwx,t3_esouq3,1579802227.0,"I realize that you have to be on birth control due a medical condition. I'm sorry dude. But my alarms went off when I read that you have had bad reactions to multiple kinds of birth control. Reminds me a lot of myself. I tried literally everything but it made me depressed and gave me body pain. This is a long shot but maybe get your doctor to order a blood test to check your homocysteine levels. I cannot tolerate any kind of hormonal birth control and I just found out why- it's my genes. I have a mutation in my MTHFR gene. Found out on my 23&me test. I'm homozygous, some people are heterozygous. Women with this gene (especially when it's homozygous) cannot tolerate any kind of hormonal birth control. This is because HBC lowers the folate levels. There is an excellent subreddit for this mutation called r/MTHFR . This may apply to you or it may not, but I suggest to all women who are considering taking HBC or have had a bad reaction to HBC to get a 23&me test, run the results through a service called Promethease, then in the topics menu you select folate. Then if you have a mutation in the MTHFR gene it will show you. If so, take the results to your doctor and get them to order the homocysteine blood test. Treatment is called Deplin. You can also get l-Methylfolate (a generic version of Deplin) on Amazon. Google the symptoms of MTHFR mutation and see if these symptoms apply to you. Good luck, gurl. Remember that everybody has a different body, and this mutation is pretty common for Caucasian and Latino/ Hispanic races. Knowledge is power! ps. This mutation sounds a lot like ""motherfucker"". It really is a motherf\*cker lol. My boyfriend completely understands and willingly uses condoms as our primary method of birth control. He wants me to be happy and healthy. Any guy who gives you crap for having to use condoms is not worth keeping around. I know that you need HBC for a health condition, I'm just afraid that a lot of women are going through hell because of this mutation as HBC exacerbates it tenfold."

Also had to postpone finishing my degree for the same reason- at this point I‚Äôm like screw it I might as well finish at some online college. Although my bf is a programmer at a decent company based out of Manhattan, and we are both under his health insurance (good insurance, low out-of-pocket costs, low deductible) we crunched the numbers and we just can‚Äôt afford the cost of giving birth/ complications/ etc right now. We would both love to have kids while we still can so it makes us so sad. The only way I could make it happen is to study and work remotely while in horrible pain. Apologies for the neck injury rant, but I think it is somehow relevant. The concept of not wanting even more medical bills compounds the issue that so many of us with injuries/ health problems face. Hell, even without those issues young couples are still getting raped financially because they want a safe hospital birth."

AskReddit,ff4xpmd,t1_ff40s8l,1579574958.0,Yeah. He just doesn‚Äôt consider his venting as venting for some reason- I said if you do it too then isn‚Äôt that a bit one-sized? I think it helped but we‚Äôll see ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

However, some may experience increased anxiety. But I also know ppl who do not get increased anxiety.  I use 94% thc distillate. It makes me less grumpy at night and feels slightly psychedelic. Ps. This is sort of off topic but too much thc in general may slightly cause delayed or skipped ovulation, but the studies are too few in number imo. We need bigger studies on this asap"

I do feel positive but it‚Äôs hard to accept that the rest of my life may be a struggle, at least financially, unless I get my shit together. My father may also have adhd (undiagnosed). My mother even told me that he was given amphetamine a few times in college to try to finish his economics papers and paintings for his art minor. Apparently he did 10 paintings in one night üòÇ. I am not surprised. He does not take meds because he has good coping mechanisms. He makes good money in real estate but he struggled for years before that. We have to believe that we are evolutionarily fit, because in a way we already are! We wouldn‚Äôt even be here if whatever parent or grandparent who had adhd could not succeed. I take great comfort in my genes, despite the hardship adhd can produce in modern society."
adhdwomen,ferdo83,t3_eq6x91,1579352681.0,"I went through this too many years ago. For me, it gave me closure after I got a 23&me test. The results said I do carry the genes for adhd/ depression. I was like ok then. At least I am somehow not depressed, but you best believe I have the attention span of a goldfish if I don‚Äôt take my prescription. If you really feel like the diagnosis is not accurate then it may not be. I‚Äôm not going to tell you what you are. It is normal to go through a denial phase.
