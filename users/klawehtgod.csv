explainlikeimfive,ffd1ncv,t1_ffckues,1579811648.0,"Probably not. Their endocrine system (system that controls hormones) is going absolutely berserk because there’s, you know, a second person in there. The baby starts to produce their own hormones, and those find their way into the mother’s bloodstream. Hormones are meant to be interpreted; they're how your body communicates when it doesn’t use nerves. Except the hormones from the baby don’t make any sense to the mother. And the mother is in pain, and unbalanced, and the wrong shape, and needing extra calories, and a hundred other abnormal things. Some of those things trigger hormones to be released. So the mother has a huge mess of them, and they get misinterpreted, leading to (among other things) mood swings and changes in appetite."

BlackPeopleTwitter,ff9a52e,t1_ff98xwv,1579708326.0,"The players are unionized. The union negotiated with the owners to create the collective bargaining agreement, which is a legal document outlining pretty much everything to do with players in the league. This includes strict salary guidelines for rookies. This includes the option for either the play or the team to negotiate for a no-trade clause. And it allows/disallows for basically everything else that happens. The reason rookie players are stuck with their salary is because the union is full of veteran players. Given that teams are limited in the total amount of money they have to spend, veterans are incentivized to negotiate lower salaries for rookies, thereby increasing the size of the pie available for veterans. And there’s precedence for this need: in the last draft before rookie salary caps were implemented, the #1 overall pick received an $80Million contract, dwarfing all but the highest paid veterans. As for getting traded without say, that is not unique to American sports. Soccer/Football players are bought and sold across *national borders* during every transfer window. Forget having to move to a different company in a new city, imagine being told you have to live in a brand new country where you have no friends and no one in your family speaks the language.

To address your edit: Teams don’t move very often. And don’t forget teams in other countries are free to move as well. MK Dons ditched Wimbledon not that long ago. There have been 4 teams move in the NFL/NBA/MLB in this century. It’s really not that common."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff99b2i,t1_ff98aod,1579707807.0,"It’s the doing of everyone who encouraged them to prioritize football over their education. A lot of these guys don’t graduate. Many of those 80% enter the workforce with moderate-to-severe brain damage and only a high school diploma to show for their efforts. Every year there’s a new scandal of a college putting their athletes in bullshit classes so they have time for practice, while still claiming the scholarship and free “education” is all the payment the athletes deserve. And before you say “well they could decide for themselves not to do this”, let me remind you that these are children. This mindset is instilled them as soon as they step on a high school football field, if not sooner. When kids are being surrounded by adults who tell them this is the way their life will go from age 14 to 21, how will they ever know to question it?"

AskScienceFiction,ff5ynhd,t3_errncj,1579614475.0,"To answer your question, Baby Yoda will speak Galactic Basic in with standard sentence structure, if he is raised by Mando. Here is why:

He’s only “reversing” sentence structure because you are a native speaker of Galactic Basic (English to a human’s ears), while Yoda is not. Basic is an SVO language. SVO means “Subject-Verb-Object” and it refers to the order in which sentences are constructed. “We have a visitor” is a normal Basic sentence. “A visitor, we have” is a sentence Yoda speaks in Ep. II. Yoda’s sentence is ordered OSV, meaning “Object-Subject-Verb”. That’s a perfectly valid ordering of a sentence. The obvious conclusion to draw is that Yoda speaks Basic as a 2nd language, and his native language is an OSV language. Given what we see and learn of Baby Yoda in The Mandalorian, it could be decades before a newborn Yoda-species is mature enough to begin training at the Jedi temple. That’s decades of Yoda hearing his native language spoken at home, engraining in Yoda’s brain’s speech center the OSV sentence structure, so that even when he is fluent in basic, he still naturally expresses his thoughts in an OSV manner."

They fought against freeing slaves, they fought against women’s right to vote, they fought against worker’s rights, they fought against civil rights, and they’re currently fighting against LGBT rights. They openly oppose the “progressives”, who want to affect changes to their society. The literally fight against progress.
