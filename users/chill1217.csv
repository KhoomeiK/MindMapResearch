dogs,ff5irh3,t3_epuxkd,1579594772.0,"I have a shiba in nyc and he is pretty well behaved. Shibas are kind of popular in nyc and I see them around all the time. My shiba has low prey drive, mostly quiet - barks when people are at the door but stops barking when I pick him up or show him nobody is outside, and sheds a lot. He is not super cuddly but likes to sit at my feet, doesn’t mind getting picked up, loves play wrestling.

I would take all dog breed stereotypes with a grain of salt. Other shibas I’ve met don’t bark at all and don’t like to be picked up at all and some don’t play in the dog park. Each dog has its own personality"

investing,ff4anrz,t1_ff49nqs,1579559204.0,Isn’t that what amazon does with its marketplace..? They do not provide data on the best selling items and instead create their own in-house branded version of the best selling items. Why wouldn’t amazon do the same with video content?
AskNYC,ff1opm3,t3_eqx3js,1579482795.0,if you can read chinese then freshgogo is a better choice.  chinatown/flushing prices plus a delivery fee.  good quality and more convenient than costco
nyc,fen88v1,t1_fen2tfh,1579279127.0,real estate is measured in $/sqft. you can fit way more $5mm than $10mm condos into the same size building.  developers want to maximize the highest $/sqft * sold curve
RealEstate,fekvnxs,t1_fekseza,1579208550.0,"It’s contracted but obviously it can be taken into consideration and negotiated if seller agent acts as a dual agent. 

Two transactions, one with a buyer agent and one without. Nyc"
RealEstate,fek2y5b,t1_fek0qyh,1579191491.0,Not a myth at all. Say you have one buyer with an agent and one without an agent. Buyer without an agent offers 2% less. The buyer without an agent has a 1% edge still that can be distributed between seller and seller agent.
RealEstate,fejzcyt,t1_fejy0d9,1579189276.0,"in my experience, if the buyer is engaged and goes to open houses on his own/finds the place/hires a lawyer/etc, then it is around 20 hours or less of work for the broker, and that is being generous.  90% of the work is collecting documents and shooting emails."
nyc,feix2es,t3_ep8sch,1579149579.0,"I don’t think it’s accurate that “most people are too ignorant about the system to realize”... I believe the vast majority of nyc residents are aware of the downsides of ESCOs.

AskNYC,fe8qd4c,t1_fe6me0n,1578929230.0,"I don’t know, I usually go to Chinatown 1-2 times a month and have never seen people with actual flyers on canal street and broadway doing that. Usually it’s maybe 1 random guy saying “Rolex, rolex”, but now I saw 6 people holding menus with pictures of the merchandise as I walked down"
AskNYC,fe69cru,t3_enwtxd,1578884665.0,just an aside but i went to chinatown today and noticed a ton of people with flyers hawking bootleg watches and bags.  it was very blatant and much less discreet than before

nyc,fd6ytji,t1_fczkgk4,1578197405.0,sounds like there is some catch like it being a land lease building because $8/sqft in fees is astronomical. a full service 1000 sqft apartment is usually like $3k/month in fees
investing,fd6uafm,t1_fd4hvlf,1578195799.0,"going to vanguard.com, i want to navigate to my personal account.  i need to scroll down and search for the link, and it takes me another click to get to my brokerage page. then the login area is in the middle left when industry standard is top right.  and that's before i even access anything.  there's clearly a lot of UX work that can be improved.

i have fidelity too and i vastly prefer its interface.  have you used both?"
