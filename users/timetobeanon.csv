AskMen,fcmghs4,t1_fcmfjx7,1577774370.0,"well context matters a lot so i wouldn't want to impress onto you a blanket judgement, but here's my thought process

I use shorthand on reddit/social media but in texting as it's more inconvenient i never bother to take the extra steps to abbreviate and people who do so are just.. idk man why do you care so much about what someone thinks about you over text that you have to type in the most inefficient way? That you want to project a certain image of yourself or show off you know what all the textspeak mean? I don't even know for sure why people do it but it just comes across as weird to me. Also to add, mirroring is important. If a community you're involved in types/speaks a certain way it can help to integrate into a culture by mirroring their lingua franca. Like if in the workplace something is commonly abbreviated then its more appropriate to abbreviate than not. 

Other than that i really don't think less of people who do it on the computer because it's just more efficient. In the words of kevin malone, why say more word when few word do trick, but not in professional emails of course that's the wrong place to be relaxed about typing etiquette."
AskMen,fcmf7ro,t1_fcme9fh,1577773052.0,ever since t9 was introduced there is absolutely no need to type in short form because it actually takes longer to abbreviate. People that still do this today do it as a conscious decision and it tells a lot about their personality
