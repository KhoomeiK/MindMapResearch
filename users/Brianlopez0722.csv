Ask, Ask, Ask, Ask ..

They're waiting for initiative.

They want someone to step up and be like ""quit the bullshit, I need a job offer or you're wasting my time""

Make sure you're asking other questions during the interview, so it's not a one sided interview..

They rarely get asked questions, and the more you ask, the more serious you sound.

Ask about daily duties, ""what would my daily duties consist of?"" 
""What is the most common issue I will run into?"" ""What would be expected of me during the week?"" Etc..

And when they are finished they will ask ""do you have any more questions?""

And BAM!! BALLS OUT

Edit: do some research on the company, and ask questions about the field they are in. The longer the interview the better  and always PRACTICE IN THE MIRROR.
