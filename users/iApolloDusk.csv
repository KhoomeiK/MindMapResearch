Haha, never met a real life Bears game before. I'm honored. 

On a more related not, I imagine it sucks even harder to go to the NFC championship game and see your team lose. Oh well, the Chiefs get to go to the Super Bowl for the first time in ages and the Pats get to stay home and cry- so I'm happy. I would've loved to see Rodgers and Mahomes duke it out for the Super Bowl though. That would've been a cool game."
science,ff8c326,t1_ff8agzh,1579672476.0,It literally just shows that candidates make smarter decisions of where to run when they have evidence to substantiate that they'll have more success in certain districts. It's apparently a novel concept to people in this thread that parties like to run candidates in locations of least resistance. Mind-boggling.
television,ff82xrg,t1_ff7oqlg,1579664586.0,"It's just what they grew up with and prefer I guess. It does fit the original canon persona of Goku being a man-baby a lot better though. So it's more true-to-source for him to sound like that. I just think that superman Goku is more fun to watch and listen to. I just hope that by the time I get done watching DBZ, Super will finish being dubbed. I can't find a decent source online about when it's supposed to be done, unless it already is. Either way I'm just now starting the Buu saga, so there's a good few months or so until I start Super."

television,ff62bw0,t1_ff5s3zy,1579617355.0,"Well he's explicitly called ""General Tao"" in the Roshi explanation during the Android arc (just after Garlic Jr. Filler) and then KEEP calling him that a few dozen episodes later when Goku is looking for Dende's dragon balls for the first time. I think it's the filler space during the 10 day training period leading up to the Cell Games. It was just really sloppy how some of the stuff referenced in the original Dragonball was handled. It's almost unforgivable to think that DBZ was dubbed before Dragonball, but I definitely get that the high-paced action was a necessary gateway for the west into anime. Dragonball was a better story, but it just didn't have that pull factor."
television,ff6203r,t1_ff5l6b2,1579617111.0,"I was also talking about the Nadolny and Sabbat thing, but you're right. No concrete sources exist out there, but you can't really expect there to be given that Sabbat voices half of Dragonball. He's virtually untouchable."

I've been sitting here for a few minutes trying to think of a comparison of how drastic of a change it would be to go from her to someone else. The best analogy I could think of would be someone coming in and replacing Tom Kenny as Spongebob when he dies. Toriyama is also getting up there in age and I'm sure he'll want to do something else after a while, and the beloved Nozawa dying might just be the catalyst he needs to either switch projects or stop working on Dragonball altogether. While you're right that there are Goku actors that are equally as prolific, I think you're really underestimating how important Nozawa is to the core Japanese audience as well many people around the world. Personally I'm not a huge fan of her Goku and find Schemmel to be a better voice, but that's what I grew up with. I can just really see Toei stopping production of new content that has Goku in it after Nozawa dies."

television,ff5c30l,t1_ff55ucv,1579586818.0,"Yes and no. Many people will tell you Z is better because that's what they grew up with. The thing is, the story was meant to be watched from the beginning and that wasn't possible for a while in the West. Not in English, at least. Dragonball was just more of an adventure show. Each of the main story groups was capped off with a tournament to sort of show how all of the main characters stacked up against each other. It was more whimsical and light-hearted at times. At other times, it had demons that were trying to take over the world and martial artists that killed for the sake of killing. All of the powers and transformations were feats of the spirit (not exactly, but I can't think of a better word) and were mystical in nature. Everything in DBZ had a scientific explanation and process. 

Dragonball Z just ends up being more of a sci-fi piece and all about whose number is higher than the other guys'. There's no inherent danger or feats of skill that grow at all throughout DBZ. It's just someone that's stronger and stronger. By the end of the first story group in DBZ, you had a villain that destroyed planets with blasts from his index finger. How do the feats become bigger and grander than that? How do you show that an enemy is more dangerous than that? You can't. Toriyama wrote himself into a corner. Goku's power level keeps going higher and higher, but the feats are still the same. Halfway through Dragonball, they were already fighting faster than light. You had a character who could destroy the freaking moon who is basically just perverted comic relief now (Roshi.) It ultimately became a game of who has the highest number, not who's more skillful or smart in combat and it gets annoying. I love DBZ. It'll always be close to my heart, but Dragonball is an objectively better story all things considered."
television,ff5bi4o,t1_ff569e5,1579586224.0,"Goku doesn't have a problem with killing people in the Japanese version. The only reason he had Vegeta spared is because he wanted to have a strong opponent around to fight. He actively encouraged Gohan to kill Cell.

I remember being really into Dragonball Z even though it wasn't really playing on Cartoon Network anymore and my only real experience was with the Legacy of Goku games. Colors TV would air Dragonball and I always thought it was cool they made some stories about Goku as a kid. Anyway, they would do the same shit. They would run the story all the way up to Goku finishing up in the first saga right before the Red Ribbon Army bit of the Tienshinhan saga and as a kid I didn't understand why every 2-3 months I would have to see Goku fighting Bulma's car again and embarking on their journey."
television,ff5aaaz,t1_ff58mnn,1579585033.0,"The problem isn't with the voices, it's with the dialog changes, i.e. Bardock being a scientist in the Ocean Dub that created the power ball false moon technique that Vegeta used to become an oozaru. It was an attempt to make Goku more superman-like. The Funimation dub kept that vibe, but made Bardock back into a low-class peasant warrior. Another problem was the censoring and editing down of the content to the point that entire episodes were removed. It was really bad overall in all honesty, but it started anime being widespread in the U.S. and brought Dragonball Z domestic, so it wasn't without purpose."

insaneparents,ff46ayb,t1_ff3chsf,1579556485.0,"Barring the fact that it's illegal to kick your kids out before they're adults, I'm not sure what to tell you on that one. I think there's some responsibility on the kids' part to play it safe until they're 18. Giving up a few hours on your weekend, assuming you're not being abused, ultimately isn't that bad of an exchange for a peaceful home life. You're a kid. Just do what your parents tell you until you're an adult. 

I completely get it though. I started questioning my beliefs at 15 and was raised in a hyper-christian southern home. I told my parents I didn't want to go anymore when I was about 16. It made them really sad, but they were never angry. It sucked around home for a little while, but they still made me go and I didn't argue. It wasn't my place. I just made it clear what I believed. I know I was lucky to receive only such a mild reaction (though it really fucking sucks to make your mother cry) and there are others that don't get so lucky, but that's where the legal protection comes in handy. The situations where parents get mega pissed and kick their kids out for their religious beliefs is more so an example of abusive parents than an abuse of religious freedom. 

Now to the fun part. You asked earlier how the classes would be abused and I see it like any other power that you give the federal government: if you don't want the party/person/group you don't support to be able to wield X power, then don't surrender it just because your guy that you trust is in control right now. For a republic to be safe from tyranny, the people must be safe from harm if the most evil and corrupt person *does* come to power. I think we're leaps and bounds too far gone from that and have been since the Civil War (see [Lincoln's suspension of Habeas Corpus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_Corpus_Suspension_Act_(1863\)#Aftermath).) Since then, the power of the executive has done nothing but become this enormous tentacled monster. 

Now more onto the topic at hand. The problem with federal control of public education is that the U.S. is such an enormous, diverse, and culturally different place all around the country. Different regions have stronger aptitudes towards different subjects, math, business, agriculture, history, industry, etc. That is due in part to the demographic makeup. Regulation on a large scale like that just doesn't work because it doesn't take into account that not all students learn the same and they don't learn at the same pace. Teachers should be given ultimate freedom to teach within the curricular confines of the class, but able to shape the class how they choose (like how college classes are instructed vs having to take the same standardized test as everyone else in your State or the entire country.) Federally controlled public education has been a flop with the CCSSI trial run over the last few years.  

The abuse specific to those classes is what I've been trying to build toward with the previous paragraphs. A federally mandated class on critical thinking and world religions can be so easily and potentially abused because it will be taught based on whatever party is in charge, first and foremost, and then whatever teacher is in charge secondly. The curriculum and books are decided by the governing body over the school and if a more right-wing government is in power, your kids will be taught world-religion from a fairly neutral perspective... but with a big feeling that Christianity, and likely protestant Christianity, is the ""right"" one. On the other hand, a left-wing government will teach all the systems from a fairly neutral perspective, but be more likely to state that none of them are right. If you're not comfortable with your kid being given either an atheistic/agnostic perspective OR being taught that Christianity is probably right, then the idea of a class like that should scare you. It will almost certainly never accomplish its job because teachers can't be non-biased. That's why we don't teach children (not commonly at least) about politics, political parties, and the beliefs of said parties until they're older. There's almost no objective way to teach the subject. By the time they learn it, they're usually aware that their teacher has a bias of some sort. 

Ultimately, my chief problem comes down to it just being another blatant defiance of the 10th Amendment. No one seems to care about it anymore, but it's one of the most important pieces of legislation the country was built upon. Now we spit on it routinely."

insaneparents,fez728r,t1_feyncp5,1579454424.0,"The thing is that you're undermining the parents and the way that they want to raise their kids. People love to bring up the separation of church and state as well as the government not teaching morality, but have no problem in undermining the parents' rights to instruct morality and enforce atheism on children. I don't believe in any of that shit either, but if a parent wants to raise their kid in church until the day that kid turns eighteen, that should be the parents' right. We're currently in the process of turning the federal government and, by proxy, teachers into parents for children and it's going to lead us down a very scary path. I don't oppose critical thinking or even instructing world religions. I do oppose how the classes will be abused though. 

The problem isn't with freedom of religion and right of the parents to bring their kid up in a religion. The problem is that some religions are unequivocally more abusive of the innocent than others. Scientology, the Mormon church, Jehovah's Witnesses, and some other christian sects are inherently abusive. It's not all christians. It's not even most christians, but Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses are cults, and cults shouldn't have free reign in the U.S. to the level they do."

It's not like every couple of parents only had two children and kept their numbers the same. As generations progress, an exponentially larger group of people will be able to trace their lineage back to that group to where even a lot of non-mormons will one day be able to trace their lineage back to that event.

You're bringing race into a pretty unrelated video. Do you not want criminals brandishing guns while walking toward the president's HOME to not be shot and killed, regardless of race? I mean there's a thing called necessary force, and shooting a man that's on the ground and not reaching for a weapon is an overuse of force and can (and does) put you in jail for murder. 

If an armed, and brandishing, black man OR white man was actively threatening ANYONE, I would want them shot because that's the police's duty- to protect and enforce laws. It's one thing if it's a knife, but a gun is just a bit harder to rationalize not shooting a criminal over.

I don't know if people realize this or not, but the founding fathers were god damned criminals by a certain point of view. No one has the right to deprive a man of his right toself-preservation unless he's explicitly proven that he's not worthy of it. 

Now, both rights probably shouldn't be restored immediately after prison. There should have to be a reasonable time that passes between release and restoration of those specific rights to prove that they're not a recidivist. Hell, I think that someone who committed second degree murder should one day be able to own a gun again if he's not deemed mentally unfit. Jail is supposed to reform. If we even want to hold a modicum of that as truth, we can't afford to not restore an individual's constitutional rights.

Prior to the start of the MCU in 2008, the average person knew the origin stories to Batman, Superman, and Spiderman. That's about it. Those were the three biggest pop-culture superheroes. I would even be willing to argue that a lot of people, though significantly fewer than the amount in the three aforementioned superheroes' origin stories, knew about the Hulk's background. Superheroes really weren't super mainstream until about 2010 I'd say. That's about the time the culture shifted, by-and-large, to include more ""nerd-culture"" into the American ethos.

I've specifically stated countless times that I know nothing about the political landscape of Chicago and Illinois as a whole. I was speaking on the general aspects of gerrymandering and that it's POSSIBLE that you could be gerrymandering specific groups into having less power by giving them a seat, but potentially denying them more if the districts were diverse. It's gerrymandering to separate everyone of a specific group into one district, thus denying a specific party (or group) multiple votes IF you've done it to specifically do that. 

Specifically messing with districts for an ulterior motive IS gerrymandering and it IS an ulterior motive to put all of the people of one group into one district so that another party can have more districts. Again, I know nothing of Chicago so I wasn't (and still am not) specifically speaking on it, but the rationale behind putting (for example) a group that votes heavily democrat all into one district, ignoring reasonable geographical boundaries.

Reasonable gographic boundaries and population numbers should be the ultimate deciding factors. Sometimes Geography and the way people settle doesn't look planned- because it's not."
MapPorn,fei24gr,t1_fehhzol,1579128612.0,"Forcing competition doesn't make a whole lot of sense in my book since reasonable geography and population are how these boundaries are meant to be decided. The competition aspect of it would make fine sense if we could redraw districts every 6 years instead of every 10. Demographics of a city or State can change rapidly. We need look no further than the popular sovreignty issue in the [Bleeding Kansas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_Kansas) situation. That was nearly 200 years ago now. Imagine how much worse that could happen today if the right event provoked it. Either we keep the 10 years and redraw to account for population shifts, or we switch to a smaller increment (even every 2 years) and redraw competitively."
MapPorn,fei1n81,t1_fehpjek,1579128320.0,"Again, since no one seems to get this for some reason, I was speaking on gerrymandering as a whole and was not trying to speak on this specific instance. I'm not familiar with Chicago, or Illinois at all for that matter. I was merely trying to spread information that gerrymandering for the sake of separating all the people of one party or cultural group into a single district (or a few districts that form a minority in the State overall) is one of the ways that gerrymandering is done."
MapPorn,fei1dnh,t1_fehqiyi,1579128159.0,"They're two separate types because they're two ways of grouping in order to make a district. One chokes off the life of a particular group's representation by shoving minority amounts of people into each district in order to secure the vote for the other party. The other type says ""fuck it"" and puts all of the like-minded people into a small amount of districts that way there's fewer battleground districts and it makes it easier to campaign. The first type is beneficial overall, but it can be tricky to accomplish since different parts of a State are generally what decides politics. The second type is a great way to win the presidency, but not a whole lot of seats in Congress (depending upon the State of course.)"
MapPorn,fei0zx8,t1_fehqum9,1579127928.0,"Racial is partisan in a lot of cases when dealing with minority groups. It just is. They're special interests. That's not to say that all members of a minority group vote the same, but they do tend to have very similar interests, especially if they're huddled together like that. 

Now, I'm not familiar with Chicago or anything, I'm merely just stating things. I wasn't meaning to speak on Chicago specifically, but rather about gerrymandering as a whole. Sorry if it came off that way."
MapPorn,fei0nfi,t1_fehrnca,1579127717.0,"I never claimed to. It's pretty hard to confirm or deny the existence of gerrymandered districts unless you're familiar with the States in question, which I'm not in most cases. My point wasn't about whether or not it was happening, but rather that gerrymandering takes many different forms and it could be to the detriment of said minority group even if it makes them look like they have a voice. But ultimately, I don't know. I've never been to Chicago and don't have a whole lot of experience with the place in general."

You can gerrymander for your party's benefit, or for the other party's detriment. For instance, you can uniquely design your lines so that every district has an X party majority. You can also design the districts so that you include all of Y party in one singular district, basically ensuring that they win the district, but don't have a chance in Hell of winning anywhere else."

todayilearned,fee6ljr,t1_fee5785,1579027463.0,"You make some good points, but the non-dissolution of the monarchy ultimately comes from there not being safe and legal way to do it. As far as the economics of it, the monarchy also brings in a fair amount of tourism especially between July and October since that's when Buckingham Palace is open for tours. Historical-tourism is huge in Europe primarily dealing with WW2, but there's also a respectable amount of tourism for Medieval France and England. Let's not forget how many swathes of people travel for Royal Weddings. A lot of us Americans eat that stuff up. Ultimately I'm not sure that the protection and provision for the monarch, since she actually does do some government work, is that much different on an economic scale compared to the Pope or the President. Some people might be pissed off about it, but in my time of studying the subject I've never really heard of a whole lot of people being pissed off in the modern era about their taxes going to support the monarchy and their way of life."
todayilearned,fedxxvs,t1_fedw2m3,1579022236.0,"Yeah, it's an interesting question, but again we can only ask that question from our experience with the monarchy. No one alive today has really experienced the true power of the monarchy, thus the myth of the Queen being a ""figurehead"" or ""mascot"" for the country. All monarchs in recent history have been pretty laissez faire regarding government.

Hypothetically, the monarchy holds the power over whether or not legislation gets passed. The last time assent was withheld was in 1707 (Queen Anne didn't want a militia settled in Scotland) and the last time it was even attempted was 1829 (George IV didn't want Catholics in parliament, but backed down after the P.M. threatened resignation.) Legislation is only passed with the assent of the monarch. Per my previous post, the monarchy had a lot more power pre-2012 with the capability to dismiss parliament at will... but that's not so much the case anymore. At the end of the day, the monarchy is the government in the U.K. that allows parliament to form and carry-out business- not the other way around. 

Though unlikely and likely unsuccessful, a future monarch could declare absolute power. Legal dissolution of the monarchy isn't even possible as far as I know because, like I said, the crown gives parliament the right to exist and not the other way around. The Queen is basically a lifelong president of the U.K. in some respects because she's the Head of State and is (sort of) like the executive branch here in the U.S. in that she decides what legislation becomes law.

There's another factor to consider though in that it's also one of the longest standing institutions in the world. It'd be like tearing down the Roman Colisseum because it costs too much to maintain (even in its current dilapidated state.) It'd be like shutting down the Louvre because ultimately it's just a bunch of paintings and whatnot in a building. Yes there's probably more useful things that tax-payer money could go toward such as providing housing, food, and healthcare for people. All of that ""tax-payer money"" is by right the crown's though if you think about it. 

The problem is that cultural preservation comes at a cost. If nothing else, the monarchy a part of history that should be preserved that ultimately doesn't do any harm. On the other hand, some people don't like the idea of a potential tyrant lurking in the shadows, and I can't say that I blame them. Ultimately though, monarchs only have power when they have the consent of the governed. I don't imagine many people would want to give up such a lavish, peaceful, and relatively relaxing experience such as being the monarch of the U.K. 

I hope this was informative in some way. Let me know if you have any other questions I can answer."
Unexpected,fedwbco,t1_fedvdrk,1579021253.0,Of course that's a thing. I've heard of making vagina bread... but using it to make beer just seems wrong and an extra level of insane for some reason.
todayilearned,fedu1z6,t1_fedse6i,1579019893.0,"Well, it makes it exactly what it is- a Parliamentary Monarchy aka a Monarchy with a parliament that can (hypothetically) be shut down at any moment. Per my first post, there's now no longer an at-will dismissal of parliament as of 2012. 

Fascism and monarchy are usually synonymous so the situation you present is kind of an ironic situation to think about. If the monarch didn't like what a fascist parliament (whatever that might look like because fascist ideology doesn't work well in a representative government) had to say, they could just refuse to enact the fascist party's legislation. It's important to note that this really isn't done often. In fact, the most recent time a monarch withheld assent was in 1707 by Queen Anne who opposed a militia being settled in Scotland. The most recent time it was attempted, however, was in 1829 when King George IV wanted to block Catholics from parliament, but he eventually backed down after the Prime Minister threatened to quit. 

It's very hard to legally come to absolute power in a parliamentary monarchy (unless you're the monarch yourself) as was done when Hitler came to power because of the inherent checks and balances of an enlightened despot, sans absolutism, and a people's representative government. The reason Hitler was able to succeed the way that he did is because the perfect storm was formed and the only guy that could check him (President Paul von Hindenburg) was extremely sick and died. Hitler took the opportunity of his sickness, coupled with the Reichstag fire, to enact emergency measures and ultimately become the supreme leader.

It's not entirely pheasible in the modern era, but well within the power of the crown. You have to remember that parliament forms only with the permission of the crown. Before 2012, the crown used to be able to unilaterally dismiss parliament. She also has to officially pass any act by parliament, but there's really not been a challenge to that in a couple hundred years. I guess the reason we don't see this as feasible is because it hasn't been done in the post-enlightenment era. The royalty isn't as castrated in the U.K. as it is in most other western countries. We've just been blessed to live in an era of level-headed British monarchy.

Showerthoughts,fedjyzq,t1_feddzr2,1579013434.0,"Well it's for sure more consistently structured. The problem with English is that it had so many influences, it's a real bastardization of languages. For instance, you can trace modern English back to having heavy influences from Latin, Celtic language, let's not forget the huge germanic influence, and also greek word origins. It's a real Frankenstein's monster of language when it comes down to it. Not only that, but there was also the huge issue of so many drastically different regional dialects (due to England's tumultuous history regarding who owned the island, which parts, and what language they spoke) and formal ways of writing specific words. It's insane that we've agreed upon a language that really only differs internationally with regards to slang and whether or not color has a ""u"" in it."
