Frugal,fffpaoy,t3_etd9w0,1579888854.0,"Family of 6 here. Spend about 400 a month. Plan dinners, roll left overs into meals the next day, limit desserts to once a week treat and those are made ( cookies from flour/sugar, boxed cakes/brownies/pies) not store made dessert. Follow serving size ( not plate size) guidelines. 

Stick to store brands or off-brands (within reason, sometimes I feel off brand cereal have a lot of sugar and *powdered bits*. Rice, dried beans, buy in bulk and store. Frozen veggies (frozen at peak freshness)  are just as good or better than the stuff sitting out in produce collecting snot.

 If possible, purchase a stand alone freezer (about 150$ for a half sized) helps, especially if there is a sale on bulk meat which you can breakdown and vacuum seal (cheap sealers about 20$ on amazon). Van freeze bread and milk if you let a little out first so the container doesn't burst, both can thaw in the fridge a day or 2 before use.  

List is a must, track prices as you shop to stay on budget. Coupons. etc.

If you attend church, try out a community dinner for a change of pace/no dishes. Also if you're close to family arrange a once a week potluck/get together, could try that with close friends
 
Covered a lot, probably missed a lot. Good luck.

*edit* Avoid juice and soft drinks. Too sugary, bad for kids, waste of money. Water is fine."
