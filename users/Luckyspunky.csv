You, being a lawyer, should take all necessary steps to have your first point of contact that day sued and possibly even struck off. So sorry to hear you had to deal with all of that."

Your mum, whether she is in a difficult position or not, should not have subjected you to this kind of lifestyle. The whole thing has no doubt put an awful strain on your relationship with her and your money is probably gone for good. This guy is no good for you OR your mum. I'm glad you got away when you did."

You're obv a good person with good morals and I do believe everything will come good for you. But in the meantime, here's something to hold on to.... When this child of your brother's comes along, how do you think it is going to be brought up? I bet you can take a pretty good guess! And who do you think will be asked to babysit?? This 2 or 3 year old who's already running wild bc daddy doesn't care and mum is finally realising how shit life can be. You'll be safe from all that misery! I've seen it before btw. This isn't the product of imagination :)"

Like you said, you're happily married so that's gotta be a good thing. Some ppl say family is everything, but you've got you're own one now. Sounds to me like ur original family fucked up by forcing your hand. Have to say, I'm very surprised at ur dad. Mums I have seen side with their boy a shit load of times, like they can do know wrong. 

Your dad. Jeez. He's left you in the lurch. Having to put up with ur mum is a shit excuse. Sorry to say, but he needs to grow a pair!!!! Having said that, best thing that can happen here is that ur bro disappears."

So where did your stance on the wedding come from, if u don't mind saying? Was it a religious point of view? Or did ur bro mistreat the girl and leave her with no option maybe?"

depression,fei0abv,t3_ep9mac,1579127500.0,I can defo understand that way of thinking. In your current state of mind it's difficult to argue with it either. Does it make you feel slightly better? Is that possible?

Too much social media can be a bad thing as they say. Too much else to do rather than keeping it real with real people. Of course, lots of people keep that balance but some obviously don't."

I have mobile numbers for some folk I worked with and they are the only ones I would tend to keep in touch with."

You'll no doubt have crossed their minds and they've wondered how you're getting on. It can be like that anywhere when someone leaves a workplace though, they've maybe assumed you want a fresh start and have better things to think about. If you want to keep in touch with any of them you might need to make the first move. Start by saying ""hey! How are things back at _________. Still the same with such n such? Give me a shout if any of you are going for a beer on Friday"". If they don't get back to you then take it from there and try your luck with someone else.

On a personal level, why don't you try to come up with something you can choose to do to keep yourself busy instead of having that drink?
