Justrolledintotheshop,ff865cw,t1_ff6cb8v,1579667071.0,The 2UZ is why the GX470 is starting to become an off roading option. Cheaper than 4runners with weak V6s and wayyy cheaper than LandCruisers with the same power (for the time). Not to mention that for my 2UZ at 200k miles I haven’t put anything into it. It costs me nothing to have the car and to “maintain” it.

PandR,ff59hcx,t1_ff593zi,1579584275.0,"At one point in the late 90s Rob Lowe has sex with an underage girl. I believe she had told him she was of age, but she was a minor. I may be misremembering bits of it, but it only happened once as far as I ever heard and it never sounded like he actually meant to sleep with someone underage. But again, he did have sex with someone under the legal age."
blackmagicfuckery,fexkco2,t1_fexjied,1579432393.0,"Level of difficulty is everything for this sub. Black magic fuckery is literally being so good at a “magic” trick it looks supernatural. In every black magic post someone explains how it’s done. We understand the basics of magic and can figure out roughly how someone did it. I’ll still upvote crazy talent displayed here. It’s black magic when someone doesn’t just play the guitar, but destroys it. Watching the drummer from Rush recently was fucking black magic to me. It’s a phrase, not a legally binding thing. It evolves and can morph due to changes in culture. This mans precision and craft is black magic to me."
blackmagicfuckery,fexhyvm,t1_fex1rjd,1579431308.0,Are you question if it was precise?
blackmagicfuckery,fexh1gf,t1_fexgl2j,1579430870.0,"Right? All these people acting like this isn’t talent. Go out, buy a hoop and see if you can do it within 5 tries. If you can’t, it’s a skill. It’s not “magic” in the sense of complete mystery, but pushing it perfectly and backing up to where it will be at by the third rotation is still impressive. Maybe not decades of practice and mastery impressive, but amazing nevertheless."
sadcringe,fewankv,t1_few7drn,1579407623.0,That’s actually cool to hear Apple uses Jamf. I’m setting up a new MDM for my school district and they’re the last ones I have to look at.
sadcringe,few3qlp,t1_few2z2g,1579404921.0,"Huh. I’ve always wanted to get a job there to see how Apple handles their MDM over how I have. I figure they actually get to make it more effective, but only due to it being their product. Good to know! Thank you."
sadcringe,fevkgds,t1_fev3hk0,1579398448.0,"Do they call it “imaging” for that? It’s a profile lockdown, their phones at the Apple store in demo mode now are just supervised phones running an MDM profile (which I’m assuming they just use configuration for still?)."
news,feuvxgo,t1_feupp0b,1579390434.0,"Plus, I’d be interested to see what the district initially told her happened and if that was a direct reflection of what actually happened. People want privacy, but want immediate video evidence, but want it in 1080p but also want multi camera angles. This stuff costs my district hundreds of thousands a year. Making us IT people comply with this and the amount of work we pay lawyers already is mind boggling. I agree that more should have been done though, half the rules around employee firings in districts is ridiculous."

They barely did anything outside of collecting $60 a month and mowing all the grass and fields in the area and cleaning the streets and shaping the bushes. Maybe some states have different rules, my new city won’t let an HOA exist in its boundaries, but not all HOAs are bad. You just have to read the fine print.

Most aren’t moving back since fire insurance is either way to expensive, or they just won’t provide fire insurance to homes now.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fcbclf7,t1_fcbb7jf,1577585219.0,"That’s fair. I know a lot of really good teachers that would leave pretty quickly after the bell (usually they stayed 30 minutes after to let anyone ask questions). 

I’m taking it like a lead-teacher of technology where you are training about like G Suite/Go Guardian or O365?"
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcb7b4d,t1_fcb4m1c,1577583294.0,"I saw you were active on a teacher subreddit. I’m going to assume you are one. 

Let me be clear, I spend 9 hours a day on a school campus. I work with some of the most amazing people on the planet. I have experience in several districts around my area, both high and low income. I went through the public school system and saw the same problems then (at some districts) that I still see today. Not every teacher is amazing and a hard worker. Most are great people, and some really do just enjoy teaching and learning. 

My “make-work” position could be eliminated. Sure, but it seems when that happens teachers complain about lack of access. When every student has a computer in their hands and when teachers have multiple devices that they are required to use, someone has to maintain those devices and systems. 

Just the other day I was setting up a device for someone with a disability and spent hours setting up something specific that no one had really worked with in my county. The greatest feeling I got was knowing a student continues to get to learn based off of the work I help do. 

Also, I’m a stakeholder via my taxes, which pay my salary and others around me. Just like you and everyone else. 

You must feel the same about custodians, administrators, maintenance and other positions. All that play a vital role in a children’s ability to learn at school."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcb4o7t,t1_fcb0052,1577582302.0,I know a couple teachers who go in on weekends. They are definitely the dedicated ones. Though I also knew one who we swore just lived there. 😂
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcb4ifv,t1_fcb02yf,1577582244.0,I’m a 12 month employee... I work 40 hours a week. It’s why I make more than a teacher. My day is spent maintaining systems more than it is training. That’s why I’m in IT/EdTech. During the start of school for about two months straight I usually pull 10-12 hour days.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcaydo7,t1_fcavha4,1577579059.0,"Yeah, a lot of people assume that every teacher in a state or even county makes the same, but it can wildly differ. It doesn’t even have to be something like poor area teacher make less (which happens a lot) and a teacher in a rich area makes more. We can see low income area teachers making great money and high income making measly money. It really depends on a bunch of stuff, like negotiating, board approved budget, years of service, degree level and certs, and a whole bunch of minute details."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcaxki3,t1_fcau7lf,1577578601.0,"😂😂😂 I cant even with you. If my comment history isn’t enough then I don’t know what is. I’m sorry I offended you. I’ll keep my years of experience to myself, both around and in the classroom."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcaueam,t1_fcasvk4,1577576806.0,"It may also be district dependent. My newer district seems to have a lot less teachers that get up and leave when the kids do, but my last district had teachers practically shoving them out of the way. I maybe see 33% that don’t work over even 8 hours now, where before I would peg it around 55-65%. 
That said, tech has a huge cost. I’m fortunate that my district really cares about kids and the cost of tech, but also cares about student data privacy and ensuring that students are learning. I was always told grass is always greener for other schools, but sometimes it is. Glad to see good teachers on reddit! I always like seeing educators on the same sites as the kids. Helps keep us all young at heart/mind."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fcarpoq,t1_fcaqs77,1577575314.0,"You can literally see it in my comment history. I work in EdTech. I have for about 6 years. I also played a role in the classified (non teacher) union, have teachers for family members, and have parents with long lineage of education service. 

I also serve on district teams dedicated to finding new ways to increase teacher engagement with the integration of technology (mostly due to increasing standardization of eTextbooks that require training a whole generation of teachers who never had such a thing), and my biggest achievements include providing accessible technology to students with disabilities. 

So, ya know, not exactly a teacher.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fcaofol,t1_fcamcb1,1577573335.0,"My last district had a contracted time of appearance of 7:45 and a leave time of 3. So my bad, not 6.5 hours. Less than 8 a day though.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fcaitqw,t1_fcago1o,1577569988.0,"For those that really care, I agree. I work in education though and I can assure you that for some, it’s more than enough. They get two months off, and really work about 6.5 hours a day. They get a bunch of holidays and training payed for. 

For the really good ones that actually care, they should be making double, if not triple."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcaimi0,t1_fcai0ia,1577569881.0,"Public school IT employee. My public record of how much I make shows around 110k, but my actual is more like 80K. They include your benefits as your income. Which is vacation, sick, dental, vision, social security, pers, Union, and a few other fees that districts pay for employees. 

So kinda take the public record with a grain of salt. Granted, most people who run don’t get those benefits would have to pay for them so that’s why they consider it part of our “pay.”

But yes, a lot of teachers after 10 years of service to the same district can make 6 figures, but they won’t ever leave because of that longevity."
