pcmasterrace,fecbdij,t1_fec1wxs,1578970092.0,"I‚Äôm going to pull a hard disagree. 

Even if someone doesn‚Äôt necessarily do any real productivity, there are still quite a few benefits to having more cores. 

The thing about more cores is that while it may not be massive on the very top end, getting an extra 4 threads for the same price at the mid and lower tiers could do lots for longevity. 

Arguably games are becoming less cpu bound and taking greater advantage of rising core counts. In the future when 4 cores is looked at in the same way as dual cores are now, I reckon AMD chips will still hold their own while 4 core intel chips may struggle a bit more. 

Of course this is pure speculation, but I personally think extra cores for a slight (and for the games I play) unnoticeable ghz Trade off is worth it. 

Idk, I like to have the option, and I think more cores becoming standard will lead to better games in the future."
pcmasterrace,fecapvy,t1_fec9dgf,1578969719.0,"First off, where does he talk about 6nm? I‚Äôll admit I only skimmed the video, but the only concern he raised against silicon transistors was quantum tunneling. 

Secondly he said nothing about graphemes, so I‚Äôm going to assume you pulled that out of your arse as well. 

Finally, prototype 3nm transistors have been produced by Samsung and TSMC (though not for cpu style chips) and the thing about quantum tunneling is that it‚Äôs still a fairly unknown and we aren‚Äôt exactly sure when and how it will cause problems - at least from my research. 

Again, if you can find a high quality source that effectively refutes my point I will gladly concede. However until then I strongly doubt your claim that ‚Äú6nm is the limit‚Äù has any truth to it."

In the words of u/KeyboardFromElbaf 

‚ÄúLook, I know I'll be downvoted for this. But here I go anyways.

If you have nothing to do but link the suicide hotline, just don't comment.

We know about the suicide hotline. It sucks. The suicide hotline link just seems to be something for people to link so they can go ""oh I'm helping"" but you're not. Best case scenario your comment is ignored because the person has already been linked it a thousand times. Worse case some poor soul calls, and if they can get past the line (Yep there's usually a line, your suicidal tendencies will have to stand in line.) they talk to the operator about how they want to end it all. Then what? Well, the police are called and that person is put into the hospital, put into medical debt (Yay America) and they come out ether fucked up on medicine or more suicidal because now they're in debt.

If you can't at least say ""I'm here to talk"" don't say shit. The suicide hotline is an impersonal link people reply with to feel like they've helped somebody.‚Äù

If you don‚Äôt believe me sort by controversial before the rest are removed. Comments like, ‚ÄúThis and other funny jokes you can tell yourself‚Äù and the ones leaving replies like, ‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù or ‚ÄúYeah, but it is though‚Äù are perfect examples of this."

Recently creator burnout has been all over the place.  Some of YouTube‚Äôs top personalities have faced it, and been overcome by it. People like PewDiePie, Nigahiga, and the creators of Smosh perhaps the 3 most influential YouTube channels of all time. So maybe he hasn‚Äôt gotten burned out yet, but what does this 8 year old have that no other YouTubed does? Plus if you follow the lives of any extremely successful child, they often spiral into deep depressions or drug addictions unless they can keep achieving. 

Basically, this kid is 8 years old and is being robbed of his childhood, because all he does is go to school and film. This child also makes tens of millions of dollars every year, which will likely evaporate unless he can shift his content to match his aging (part of what makes him successful is kids relating to his youth). So he‚Äôs an 8 year old who‚Äôs basically peaked, and has no social life. He may enjoy it now, and I hope for his sake that he‚Äôll continue to do so for the rest of his life, but from a totally outside perspective, the future looks grim."

Each uploads 10-20 minute videos daily or even more often than that. Assuming he probably needs additional takes (because he‚Äôs fucking 8 years old) and bits are edited out, he‚Äôs easily spending 2-4 hours every day behind a camera. Mostly alone as well. The kid goes to school and then films. I doubt he has the time to do extracurricular things or hang out with friends away from the camera. That sucks, money or no money."
