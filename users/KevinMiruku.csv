Since it was growling, I shrugged and left it alone. Later on that day I looked under the bed again and  it wasnt there anymore.

When I was a bit more older, maybe 7? I ended up somehow outside alone at night and the dogs I've always seen in the streets were all there. I remeber the husky with gold and blue eyes sitting and staring at me with other dogs sitting and staring at me all cirlced around me. I was scared but I'm more of a keep quiet type. They never showed any aggressiveness, but I couldnt help it. Then all of a sudden a golden retriever arrived and lured me back home.

Once I had a dream of a beautiful field of flowers and kids playing. One told me to come join them, but right when I was about to go play with then, my cousin Pedro took my arm and shook his head 'No', and then I suddenly woke up. I asked him about it and he said he had the same dream of him stopping me. Our older relatives overheard us and said had I gone with those kids, I would have never woken up.

In my late teens I was in my bathroom and all of a sudden there was this huge dragonfly that appeared out of nowhere heading right at me. I like dragonflies, but just that it was so sudden, I flinched a bit. But when I tried to find it, it was gone. My door and windows where closed the whole time."

My depression makes it hard for me to want to stay friends cause sometimes I over talk from excitement or talk about my depression, then I regret it and start hating myself. I kept hearing how people need to rid the negativity and I consider myself negative. I rather be home with my dog than going out with people. Idk..."

AmItheAsshole,fct1sxz,t3_einuyo,1577930662.0,NTA You told your sister how you felt about it and she didn't want to understand. Never was theirs to begin with. Dont let them have it.

AmItheAsshole,fcqqt4i,t3_eigcs9,1577890739.0,"Even if someone apologizes to you, you don't have to accept it. The way I see it, if it helps one cope with saying an apology, that's good. But if its forcing someone to accept them, that's not their choice. If she's done something so horrible to the point you pretended to not know her, that's a choice you'll have to live with. If it bothers you too much, you could chose to meet her again settle things, but again, you dont have to ever feel obligated to accept an apology."

But coming here and bashing on someone for speaking their mind isn't helpful. I get your rage, but you also do NOT speak for all of us. Have a nice life."
