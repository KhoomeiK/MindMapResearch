People with dementia can also learn through spaced retrieval: https://tactustherapy.com/spaced-retrieval-training-memory/

Think about things like quality of life...what is the toughest part of his day?  Are there little things that could make his life easier?  For example, dementia may be worse toward the end of the day...helping him with a solid turn-in routine may help.

It is also possible that different drugs could help with some of these symptoms.  Good luck."

Parkinsons,feds60c,t3_eome6w,1579018739.0,"16??  I'm so sorry to hear you're going through that.  There should be resources (e.g., a social worker) available to you at your high school, assuming you're in the US.

I am not trying to target your mom, but it sounds like she may, without meaning to, be abusing you.  Children do not deserve to be yelled at or made to feel emotionally unsafe in their own home.  There may be resources out there to support both of you, although it depends on your area what those look like.  I absolutely do not think this is on purpose.  You're right, the yelling likely comes from the disease, but that doesn't mean this isn't traumatic.

It is also possible that she needs her meds adjusted.  Her symptoms may be helped by an antidepressant.  If you can go with her to a doctor, it sounds like that would be best.  Also, consider that you may have to start making legal decisions for her (power of attorney), which will involve some doing.  Not sure what kind of age restrictions are in place here around that.  You may have to be 18, or legally emancipated, for example.

I'm also worried that you haven't been able to get your license.  That implies to me that she is still driving.  I'm not sure, from what you say, that is safe.  I would seek out an adult who can help you get going with this process (a teacher at school?)  For your family, but also for you.

I really encourage you to reach out as much as you can so you are not shouldering all of this yourself.  You need to start planning for your own future as much as possible.  I know you love your mom.  Sounds like a heartbreaking situation all around."

Similarly, take your wife on a nice hike or whatever she likes.  Even if you choose not to take sides in the issue, do things that let them both know you value them.

If it’s any consolation, your daughter is doing exactly what she should, which is pushing back against authority in an effort to be more independent.  And mom is struggling because she’s no longer an obedient little girl who wants to come snuggle.  That’s natural too."
