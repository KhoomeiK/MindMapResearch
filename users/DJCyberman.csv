Cyberpunk,fe8m22c,t3_eo4cur,1578927758.0,"Let's be honest though, its meaning will change in 80 years because those who witnessed the birth of the computer age and internet age will be gone.

The thing that makes it different from other 
genres is it does have an expiration date.

Cyberpunk,fdyrrtk,t1_fdymgcx,1578782886.0,"Funny thing, I didn't know that during the 80s there was a whole thing about an increase in teen suicides and parents blaming it on stuff like heavy metal and D&D.

I just like cyberpunk because it was birthed from the futurism of the computer age. It's relatable now more than ever and technically in games like Mirrors Edge it's a clash between the two since you have a stable society but with inhuman working conditions."
Cyberpunk,fdylqgt,t1_fdwvmqj,1578781183.0,"I'd be interested to see someone make a game or movie about it with grounded current facts

Cyberpunk tends to reflect on current issues and the deeper understanding of what makes us us

Solarpunk honestly makes no sense. We cyberize to evolve while Solarpunk means, what, we eat more vegetables and grow trees?

The biggest difference between cyberpunk from everything else is that it's not just a style, it's a way of communicating. You become a cyborg to be a better human but at the cost of your humanity as you upgrade.
You rely on your phone to remember phone numbers so can you even say that you remember just as much as without it. Then your phone dies and you feel like you lost a part of yourself because it became a part of you.

That's cyberpunk ^

Stuff like that actually happens"
Dissociation,fdord6f,t3_emfoby,1578611175.0,"I believe so.

I've mentioned that it went away all of a sudden and I relapsed

I got a angry about something and couldn't focus on anything other than that.
( fun fact: thx to internet trolls I've occasionally snapped myself out of it. They point out how stupid I sound and I can realize that I'm obsessing over something pointless and that there's obvious flaws in my logic )

So I've concluded that it's some kind of chemical imbalance, maybe. I'm no neurologist but what I do know is that strong emotions are a factor.

I've never thought internet trolls could play such an amazing part in improving my mental health. 

Understand this, I find that most answers to the grand question are often obvious and simple but require a lot of hard work to achieve.

Dissociation,fc9lzbs,t3_egpfts,1577554667.0,"It sounds like a very mild experience but you seem grounded.

Dissociation for me causes a disconnection from all people, it's like eventhough I have bonded with them nothing ever seems to be enough for me to go out and hangout with them. You get desensitized to people whether you like them, are annoyed by them, or hate them, you just exist with them.

Friends 
Family 
Everyone 

I had an inconvenience that kept me from seeing friends that I haven't seen in a year and that wrecked me but that's as much genuine caring that I've felt all year.

Best advice: keep your friends close. My friends pulled me out of it and I owe them so much but I don't get to do that this year.

Also a major sign is zoning out constantly and losing track of time. Like 1 hour feels like 15 minutes all day but that only happens when it gets really bad"
