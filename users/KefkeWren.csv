This is extremely relatable. My players are great people, but they have a knack for always doing the one thing that I have no prep for. Leaving me to have to pull so much out of my ass. Or, pull out things that they weren't supposed to encounter for at least four more levels. It's ""exciting"", and we have a lot of fun, but I swear they've given me grey hairs."
rpghorrorstories,ff6o7sv,t1_ff6ms58,1579631397.0,"By the same logic, being for the Crown and not holding a personal grudge against magic, he could also have decided that his character recognized that Necromancer was using their powers for good, and begrudgingly allowed them to continue. He could have made it clear in character that he didn't like what they were doing, didn't like _them_, but recognized the help they had been. Sort of an, _""I'm watching you...scum.""_ sort of thing. There are also plenty of stories like that. It was OPs decision, and OPs decision alone, to play their character as having such a massive stick up their ass."
rpghorrorstories,ff6l1yx,t1_ff6isz0,1579629477.0,"> Why should consequences be only done by the DM?

Because that's the DM's job. The job of the Players is to work together. You can have conflict, but conflict is different from forcing a situation where someone must lose their character. Conflict is ""I don't like you"", not ""you must die"". 

It's fine to say that the trial might have gone in the Necromancer's favor, but it's not realistic. If the law had exceptions for people using the bad magic for the right reasons, then the Necromancer's character wasn't a problem in the first place, and the Knight should have just acknowledged him as one of the good ones. If the law _doesn't_ have that kind of exception, then calling for a trial is just suggesting that instead of losing his character right away, the Necromancer should have to not be able to play his character while they're tied up, and then still lose them later, which is a non-compromise. More than that, based on the circumstantial evidenced, if there had been a trial, and the Necromancer had been exonerated, that would only have left OP dissatisfied with how no one was playing the lore correctly."
Fallout,ff6kaw2,t3_erriqs,1579629019.0,"I think that one option would be to spawn in more enemies at high levels. That way, even if each individual goes down quickly, they'd still be a threat as a group. That would be pretty engaging, as you'd have to plan out your attack, focus big threats, look for ways to take multiple enemies out at once, or just rely on stealth. Also, going from struggling with a couple of mutants to wiping out a squad of 15 or more would make you feel like a total badass - as opposed to going from quickly taking them down to struggling even with your most powerful weapon.

Degrees of AI would be another option. Weak enemies might stand and blast or charge in recklessly, catch each-other in the crossfire, and generally act like bumbling mooks. Stronger enemies might be more inclined to take cover, flee when injured to recover, maybe even have a enough of a limited awareness of what other mobs are doing to set up rudimentary tactics.

Maybe add a system that gives tougher opponents special abilities. For instance, a commander might be able to shout out ""Open fire!"" and give all their underlings in a certain range increased accuracy and fire rate/swing speed for a short time. A really strong enemy might get the Deathclaw's ability to hurl chunks of concrete, or a ""stunning"" attack that throws the player back and holsters their weapon. The stronger they are, the more abilities they have, and/or the more often they can use them.

...just some ideas off the top of my head."

rpghorrorstories,ff67wau,t1_ff5f0jk,1579621233.0,Bad bot.
rpghorrorstories,ff67ukk,t1_ff5jnu1,1579621202.0,"Honestly, since OP wouldn't disclose the system and has since deleted their entire post, we have no idea how much the magic was actually hated in universe. We only have their perspective, which was clearly _""Necromancer deserves to lose their character for playing the wrong class.""_ However, given that they did acknowledge that the book doesn't say to never let a PC be that class, just that it has to be done carefully and the player has to essentially sign a wavier, and given that the Necromancer was being careful about how they used their magic, I think it's pretty reasonable to say that DM and Necromancer did talk things out and follow what the book says, and Necromancer was being played correctly. At which point, we can argue about how in-character Knight was being, but Knight's _player_ was definitely making a choice of either making another player lose their character or denying that character the ability to do anything and side-tracking the campaign for several sessions to take them for a trial where, according to Knight's expectations, they would then lose their character. 

PCs should only do things to deliberately screw other PCs like that if the player their doing it to has been an asshole and is ruining everyone's fun. Which, by the way the rest of the table rallied behind Necromancer, we can be pretty sure they weren't being. When nobody at the table is being an asshole, PCs priorities should be in working together and letting everyone enjoy the game. If something Necromancer does is going to bring a witch hunt on them, it should happen because an NPC saw what they were doing, not a party member. OP constantly looking for proof that another player was doing something illegal so they could bust them and punish them is totally a dick move. 

Imagine someone playing a Rogue, and another player is always trying to convince everyone else that they're acting suspicious. Then, one day the party is in a situation where the Rogue has to open a door in front of everyone. The other player sees them using lockpicks and goes, ""AHA! I _knew_ you were a thief!"", then starts demanding to either cut off their hands for thieving, or to turn them in to the guards who, according to setting lore, will likely do the same thing. That's basically what this is. In both cases, one person is just trying to play their character, and the other is antagonizing them. Yes, what they're doing might be illegal in-setting, but adventurers do things that are technically illegal all the damn time. PCs in most games are some of the most ""ends justify the means"" groups there are."
rpghorrorstories,ff660gz,t1_ff5kr53,1579619971.0,"Based on the way OP told their story (before deleting everything), I seriously doubt that they would have been okay with that. It sounds an awful lot that they would have just whinged even harder about how lore-breaking it is that someone in a position of power would be okay with it. As a GM myself, I would have to recognize when one person at the table is being unreasonable and trying to ruin everyone else's fun, and head that shit off before it completely derails the campaign."
rpghorrorstories,ff65op2,t1_ff5rhuf,1579619745.0,"It's not breaking the lore for someone doing something illegal to be a good person. Also, OP themselves stated (before deleting their post) that the rules _do_ allow players to choose that class under certain circumstances, as long as they understand the lore and know the risks. 

More importantly, though, there's a difference between how PCs and NPCs should react to things. NPCs should be expected to stick pretty strictly to the lore for the setting, because they _are_ the setting. PCs, on the other hand, are being controlled by players. Players know damn well that the other PCs also have real human beings behind them, and shouldn't be a dick and try to ruin someone else's fun unless that person is being an asshole, which OP's story made pretty clear that Necromancer wasn't."
rpghorrorstories,ff657md,t1_ff618jl,1579619418.0,"Not really. OP was pushing for strict adherence to setting lore. Setting lore is that people who practice the kind of magic Necromancer was using are burned at the stake. Sure, the Necromancer should have expected that there would be consequences from _NPCs_ if the kind of magic they used was known, but you generally don't screw over your fellow party members unless they're being dicks."
rpghorrorstories,ff64v4b,t1_ff61jk4,1579619176.0,"Honestly, nothing other people chose was stopping OP from continuing to play their character.

rpghorrorstories,ff5cwfb,t1_ff2zl4q,1579587685.0,"> If I was playing a thief that stole from the poor and you were a lawful good paladin should your character have the 'character growth' to accept my character and not arrest them?

First of all, false equivalence. We have no evidence that the Necromancer did anything beyond the school of magic they used, and the fact the rest of the party sided against OP suggests the opposite, in fact. This is more like wanting to chop off the party rogue's hand the second you catch them with lockpicks, and demanding to turn them into the guards when the rest of the party rightly tells you to chill.

Secondly, the answer to your question is a little more complicated than yes and no. Probably, the paladin _should_ reach a compromise. Because tabletop roleplaying is a cooperative effort, and you have to be flexible so that everyone at the table gets to have fun. However, more accurately, the paladin needs to recognize that there are more options than ""ignore everything"" and ""remove another player's ability to play the game"", and roleplay things in a way that makes it clear that their character _has a problem_ with the rogue, but not take them out of the game unless they are ruining the game for everyone else.

> Also why should it be OPs character that needs to have character growth from the situation, why couldn't it be the Problem player learning that using the dark arts is wrong and only using accepted types of magic?

Because of the two of them, only one of them can have a change of heart that still allows the character they created to be played."

People will try to insert their politics everywhere. Best thing to do is to downvote political memes, even if you agree with them. Otherwise, this ends up turning into just another X-flavored political meme sub.
