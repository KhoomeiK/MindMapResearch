dogs,fff4l4n,t3_et9z7l,1579875545.0,Is she getting enough chances to sniff and explore during other times?
dogs,ffezub8,t1_ffex1f8,1579871680.0,"'No' means nothing to her. Simply don't let her get up the bed, block her path when she tries and direct her to the appropriate place. You can set up a pen with her bed and toys in the room, for exemple. If she gets up, immediately say whatever word you might want to use to get her off things and throw a treat/toy on the floor. Once she's got all her feet on the floor toss a few more treats. That's it."
dogs,ffewiuo,t3_et9ekw,1579868443.0,"She is very young, so for now management is your best friend. While she learns you'll have to be vigilant and consistent. If she's not supposed to get on furniture, don't let her, ever. Interrupt the behavior before it happens and redirect her to the appropriate place, reward her there. As for chewing, put away anything you don't want her to get and give her ample choice of things she can chew, like bully sticks, pig ears, frozen kongs, etc. Don't let her wander unsupervised yet, either put her somewhere safe (crate, puppy proofed room) whenever you're not around, or keep her with you. Resuming, you avoid what's forbidden and reward what's permitted."

dogs,ffcxel4,t3_esxusg,1579809263.0,"Antlers aren't available here, but we use cow horns and hooves as a substitute. Works great. They get softer once they start gnawing on them and are very stinky. The good part is that you can fill them up just like a Kong."

dogs,ff9o98w,t1_ff9en5a,1579717146.0,"There are tons of toys and diy ideas you can do that would fill his need to scavenge. Put his food in a cardboard box and let him tear it open, spread it in a snuffle mat or grass and let him sniff it out, fill the kong with something soft and freeze it so it gets harder to pull out. Just look up canine enrichment and copy some of those ideas. Mine hardly ever eat out of a bowl and sometimes feeding time leaves them so mentally tired they go straight to sleep after. Get his brains working."
dogs,ff8sz2p,t3_es6wjv,1579694924.0,"Yep, it's ok. You can also just rinse it with water if you don't feel the need to use shampoo everytime."
dogs,ff7fdb3,t3_es2lpv,1579648267.0,Poodle breeders start shaving puppies' faces before they even leave for their new homes. Age is not a problem. The sooner they get used to being groomed the easier it will be in the future.
dogs,ff6lvqr,t1_ff63js0,1579629981.0,"A day isn't enough. My youngest went on a hunger strike once that lasted 4 days. She was fine, she just wanted something else to eat. I simply put the bowl down and picked it up a few minutes later, same thing on all meals. On the 4th day she caved it and ate it whole. Never tried it again and eats whatever I put in front of her. Either you toughen up and don't give in to him or he'll always be like this."
dogs,ff5quc8,t3_erpfjz,1579606581.0,"That will depend very much on your yard and how secure it is. If there's any chance of anything or anyone coming in then she can't stay outside. She also needs proper shelter, both from warmth, cold and rain. If it's properly secure and weather safe I have no issues about it, as long as the rest of the routine fits her needs as well. Since it seems fine I wouldn't be too worried."
dogs,ff3pqnf,t3_erhc8m,1579546204.0,"I follow a local trainer-ish who uses a set up like this with her dog. It works, with a few changes from what you plan: the box stays on a fixed place and the dog can access it whenever it wishes. She uses a plastic box, soil and grass on hers."
dogs,ff3lvt0,t1_ff3kbhu,1579543827.0,"When that happens you move on and find a new vet. Happened to me, but the same medicine that made one of my late cats throw up blood bc the dose was wrong is helping one of my current cats. Get a vet you trust and ask about hypercaloric foods, they're made exactly for this kind of recovery when the dog to gain weight."
dogs,ff3ljnv,t1_ff3abwp,1579543620.0,"Compulsive licking, himself or something else, is a sign of anxiety, and since you already said he has separation anxiety I'd guess it's the cause for both the carpet and his paws."
dogs,ff2uqxe,t3_er66yq,1579524946.0,"Just tell him grapes, chocolate and xylitol can kill the dog and shouldn't be given in any situation. Don't sugarcoat, straight up tell him he could kill the dog. And then suggest a few things he could share with the dog that won't harm him. My dad loves to share his food with our girls and he also has no idea about what's dangerous, but he learned that he can't give anything with these three ingredients. We catch him sharing everything else though."
dogs,ff0yp6r,t1_feyz553,1579473581.0,This is... whack.
dogs,fenr5s4,t3_eq28nv,1579289646.0,Lmao the dog can't even walk on a leash and they're making noise about it being denied on a plane...
dogs,feh5pkk,t3_ep51hq,1579109685.0,"It took me 6 months before I looked in my younger girl's eyes and thought ""I'd kill for you"". These things take time."
dogs,feeig76,t1_feeb5i2,1579034402.0,Then I'd go ahead if you feel the puppy is right for you. I have two females and they do wonderfully together.
dogs,feeamrn,t3_eon31z,1579029834.0,"Labs aren't really known to have same sex aggression, so if your current dog never displayed any sign of it I wouldn't stress about it."
dogs,fed6lkz,t3_eoc376,1579001359.0,"Renovations stress me out, so I imagine the dogs feel it even worse. Since que didn't have anywhere to take ours to while it was going on I just redoubled their activities to keep them tired and kept them out of the way. We survived."
dogs,fdxtk0q,t3_enb8li,1578772783.0,"It's really cool that the Huskies you know are good offleash and the GSDs are big babies but the very nature of these dogs say that they won't be good for someone who wants a cuddly, easygoing dog while working 9-5, living alone and walking it 30 min a day. Oh and it must be good offleash and people and dog friendly. It's just common sense my dude.

Same way you can't get a herding dog and expect it not to herd, a hound and expect it not to have prey drive. People here don't overstate genetics, they just tell the truth. Yes, you are rolling the dice with dogs of unknown background. No, not all dogs will be perfectly well behaved no matter how well cared for and loved they are. Again, that's just common sense.

If you think it's toxic to tell that breed A has these known traits and wouldn't be the best choice for someone you might need to review your concepts of what's toxic."
dogs,fdxcy8v,t3_ena7oo,1578767553.0,"Google ""puppy nursing station"". Maybe it works for you guys."
dogs,fdv2lmm,t1_fdstbgv,1578742420.0,Yes! That's the feeling!
dogs,fdv2hcx,t3_en0jjj,1578742353.0,"You can lift that without issues but you need to use proper form (squat, lift from your legs, not your back) and maybe strenghtening exercises. Or you could get a ramp! My vet was always a bit amazed when I just picked up my then 30kg girl and climbed two sets of stairs with her on my arms so I can tell you, it feels really good to be able to carry them."
dogs,fdrotji,t1_fdrnghc,1578687536.0,"Learning about threshold is what you need to do. When he goes over it nothing you do will get him to give his attention back, so you need to learn his 1) triggers and 2) limits so you can start working on them. What makes him react? Dogs? People? Bikes? Something else? At what distance does he starts to react? In which situations? All this matters and all this has to do with learning about threshold. It's a multifatorial thing, not something just changing tools will solve."
dogs,fdraf4y,t3_emuuts,1578681632.0,"Depending on your speed, and I know mine would barely make a Dane pick up their usual pace, I don't think there's any problem with it. She probably won't even be running, more like a trotting."
dogs,fdr88v4,t1_fdr60on,1578680837.0,"Obviously all things have levels but yeah, it's a red flag. In a long term relationship one day the animal person will need the other's help, be it for health reasons or something like that. If the person doesn't at least shows a small level of care and empathy for animals it just won't work. I've seen that happen, because unlike other interests you can't just put away pets. Sure, I've seen indiference turn to care, even if just when necessary, but I've also seen it become real dislike, and that's stressful for everyone..."
dogs,fdqhjpz,t1_fdqh9jt,1578666830.0,"If none of that works you may try to use non slip floor wax or carpet runners, if she's still slipping. If she's not slipping anymore you may use them while you work to get her used to the flooring again, reducing slowly. Good luck!"

dogs,fdqcbss,t1_fdqbrhc,1578662809.0,Just have one person stand in front of her with peanut butter on a spoon and another take the pic from the side.
dogs,fdqbkkg,t3_emf3r7,1578662151.0,"Post a side full body pic, can't really tell just by the face. To be a dalmatian/boxer mix she'd have to be really lanky and long legged, since that's what both breeds are. If she's stout and muscly she's probably a pit mix."

dogs,fdq9rs1,t3_emptje,1578660487.0,"Look for leashes with locks like [these](https://http2.mlstatic.com/guia-zeedog-mickey-p-D_NQ_NP_856733-MLB29882338104_042019-F.jpg). They're pretty safe and heavy duty, but sadly [the brand](https://www.zeedog.com/) only sells leashes up to 4ft."
dogs,fdlnfhx,t1_fdl2sfn,1578527991.0,"There are other brands besides Bayer. I've only ever used local brazilian brands,  both cheap and expensive, to good effects so I'm sure OP can find others in US too."
dogs,fdkz3jq,t3_elvnk5,1578514133.0,"Use collars. They last longer than chewables and are just as effective. I used them on some community dogs we care for and they lasted over 6 months without catching ticks, which is pretty good considering they live on the streets, even though they're supposed to last only 4. I don't know about US, but here in Brazil there's a lot of brands and as such price ranges. The ones we used were 50$, while a Bayer Seresto costs like 200$ for the same size. EDIT: looking it up on Amazon, you can buy like 2 for 30 dollars, and your grandad's dog will be tick free for maybe a year."

dogs,fdkxo9y,t3_elwhbf,1578513290.0,"Eye ulcers can increase ocular pressure, even after healed or loss of eyesight. That causes pain. In these cases it's more indicated to remove the eye completely, it won't be able to cause more issues if it's not there anymore."
dogs,fdk1ved,t3_elqp97,1578493993.0,"Don't adopt this dog, it won't be fair to your current one. The size difference makes his 'dominance' dangerous by itself, even if he never took it as far as hurting. It might be dog aggression, might be resource guarding, might be a lot of things, but i wouldn't subject a pre existing dog to this. Pass him and wait for another option."
dogs,fdjx26s,t1_fdipdaf,1578490244.0,"Can tell you it doesn't happen. The wag is still there, but with a finger lenght nub. Insane speeds now that it's lighter. It's still pretty visible though, so you can read her emotions easily."
dogs,fdjt907,t3_elllb2,1578486689.0,"If this happened multiple times I'd go for docking. It's more uncomfortable for them to be constantly splitting their tail on things than to take a bit off and never have to deal with it again after it's healed. My poodle had a partial adult dock due to a bad kink that kept snagging on things, so I decided to do it instead of waiting for her to break it one day because she got it stuck. The recovery is ehh, could have been better, but after that she's perfectly normal."
dogs,fdicd3m,t3_eliy5c,1578439715.0,Nonsense.
dogs,fdic9gc,t3_eljqba,1578439655.0,Probably marking. Females do that too.
dogs,fdgm6m7,t1_fdg458l,1578401989.0,"Honestly, just leave him locked in your room when you're not home and don't give her a key. She's going to end up hurting him seriously one of these days, not to mention she's stressing the fuck out of him already. Don't leave them alone at all."
dogs,fdgkbdm,t3_el7tau,1578400167.0,"She's stressed and shouldn't be made to tolerate stuff at this age. She needs space and the young dogs are the ones who have to leave her alone. Teach them to stop bothering her and giver her a quiet space that's only hers, like a crate. Give her one on one attention and don't force her to interact with what she's scared off unless she's the focus and you're able to keep her before her limits (seeing strange people at a distance while you reward her for exemple. Old dogs need comfort and a space adjusted to them, not the other way around."
dogs,fdgjz1p,t1_fdfmndl,1578399818.0,"Yeah, I don't think one single person would disagree if OP just came and said ""Less and less people at hearding trials/sports forget that the well being of the livestock is more important than their/their dog's fun and the whole point of the practice and associations are just letting it happen by allowing unfit dogs to perform and win titles"". It was just poorly worded and it came out like the breed was the main point (at least to people who aren't active in it)."

dogs,fdfh4fn,t1_fdfgcnl,1578361561.0,"I remember what my grandfather used to tell me about the dogs they used to work. They were all the same kind of landrace dog and they were used to hunt like hounds, hunt like terriers, herd sheep, herd cattle and guard properties, according just to their individual abilities. The same dog often times worked on 2 or more of these. I don't think breed is the main concern here..."
dogs,fddll10,t3_ekqusg,1578316901.0,"If the dog snapped this many times and never broke skin I wouldn't rehome. This is a case of better supervision and teaching the child boundaries. She's old enough to learn how to interact with the dog safely, even though she still needs supervision. No more moving the dog, picking up the dog, poking the dog, hovering over the dog, while you're not with them. Don't put her face near the dog. This sort of thing. Practice with her, teach her to call the dog down or call an adult when she wants to move it somewhere, teach her to get away if the dog growls or shows teeth. She can learn, but you need to teach her."
dogs,fdclhpc,t3_ekmk40,1578277865.0,"If I tried to walk my 13yo with the young one I'd end up with two unsatisfied dogs. The old one can't keep up with the other so she's be overtired, and the young one needs way more exercise than the other, so she'd be pent up. Separate walks is the only way. Give the dog who stays behind something to do when you leave, like a Kong, to keep it entertained."

dogs,fd5vgdk,t3_ek3bmf,1578181991.0,"I give mine meat trimmings and chicken parts sometimes. Chicken backs, necks and feet, meat scraps minus fat, this sort of thing. I prefer big bones than smaller bones, exactly because they have to work it before swallowing. If I give my youngest small pieces the temptation to swallow it whole is bigger."

dogs,fd3zo98,t1_fd2bk6z,1578163021.0,"They do just fine with adult cats, but they will kill kittens. The vast majority is hellbent on killing small animals, and yours being different doesn't change that."
dogs,fcy7i7s,t3_ejikix,1578075896.0,"If the problems are 1) the dog doesn't drink enough water and 2) the dog eats too fast, there are better ways to solve it. Slow feeder bowls for eating too fast, mixing a bit of stock in water if it doesn't drink enough, etc. It's ok to put a bit of water on the kibble, but a whole liter is excessive."
dogs,fcxbq81,t1_fcxa3e3,1578058504.0,"That's the hardest part, but like, be honest. Say the dog would try to hurt the hamster and even in it's cage the hamster would be really scared all the time, so he'd be really sad. Give him a big ice cream."
dogs,fcx7zup,t3_ej92em,1578054886.0,"You don't. This is normal dog behavior, it's his way of checking it out. Some dogs are fine with just sniffing, while others also lick it. It's normal and there's no need to discourage it (unless he's like hyperfocusing on it and spending over a few minutes doing it. In that case just calmly call him away with some nice treats and go on your way)"
dogs,fcx7qx1,t3_ejecn0,1578054621.0,"Both will be severely stressed out. I've seen Pinschers killing kittens, rats, bats, you name it. If it's smaller than them they will kill it, and if they can't reach it they will keep trying. The poor hamster will live in fear."
