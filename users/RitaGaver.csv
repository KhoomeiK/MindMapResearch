GriefSupport,fdawen1,t3_ekefb0,1578251132.0,Gosh. That was an understatement hubby said. Would he feel the same way? Wow! Maybe he keeps everything inside.
GriefSupport,fda9vvi,t3_ekbc70,1578243438.0,It's tough when you loose someone. She is part of you and now you miss her presence. Your life has changed and the change is very hard to accept. People around you also change bc your life has changed. That can be a positive or negitive change.

depression,fcu08qv,t3_eikk9a,1577967981.0,"Even if a person hasn't achieved their goals or whatever shape a person wants for Him or herself,  the scale of depression should not tip into thoughts of suicide, feelings of having no future, misery, hopelessness not wanting to continue through college. What in the hell is going on.... Whether it's the internet, pollution, not getting enough nutrition too many meds life shouldn't be this tough. People should be able to live a life of some of of happiness not a hard life. Is it money? Corporations run the world not people. Just a thought."

depression,fcrz28j,t3_eikk9a,1577908701.0,You would think life should be more pleasure than pain. Then the purpose of living would be worth it more. How can that be achieved?
