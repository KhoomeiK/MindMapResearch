We have one bar here that insists on taking your picture when you walk in, like a mug shot, and I won't consent to that either. So I don't go there.

alberta,ffb1x2n,t1_ff9nh9z,1579749736.0,"Ya. CRA is really really good at taking a small sum you owe them and making it huge by adding interest and penalties. 

My dad had an accident at work, which resulted in a TBI. Things got put on hold (he owned a business). Found out he owed around 15 000 in back taxes. The accountant didnt do what they were supposed to. Anyway, he'd put 3000 on it, they'd charge 4500 in penalties etc. In the end, the cra jacked that 15k to over 125k. When my dad was paid out when his lawsuit was finalized because of the work place accident, they took a very large chunk from him. They legit bullied him to soak every penny they could from someone who suffered from a traumatic brain injury. He paid well over what he owed plus the lump sum they took. Absolute crooks."

New tech, new books, playground upgrades, field trips, breakfast and lunch programs, special guests to present at the schools, rental spaces for events, etc. 

The money has to come from some where! Not like the govt is handing out hundreds of thousands for this. If you don't like it, move on. School has got to make ends meet at some point. We all want the best for our kids and their education. And for every person bitching about a fundraiser, there's someone bitching about lack of fundraisers. Smh. Nobody is happy. 

And I'm sure if you wanted to just donate to your school or parent council, there's probably that option too. Sorry you got scammed by a church *big surprise* but not every school is out to scam you. They just need the ability to raise funds for the things they need. So what they went this route to get a little kick back or some perks like new material. Gasps."

She happened to leave out that part when giving him access to the recording) however that is my fault and no one else's. I regret every one of those moments.

AskReddit,fcnc6hi,t1_fcmxygk,1577808533.0,"So happy to see men reaching out to help the youth. They need solid Male role models, as so many don't have a Male they can look up to and relate too. Hi5 to you great sir! 

And yes BBBS is a great program. We are so short for ""bigs"" where I live. Clearing for these kind of programs are simple also.  Criminal record check, which can be obtained from your police station and a child welfare check. Where I am the welfare check is free but the record check from the police is 50 bucks. Super simple. I should add I live in Alberta Canada, so obviously things may vary with location. 

I highly encourage people to look into helping these programs. Their help and effort is immeasurable and so widely needed."
