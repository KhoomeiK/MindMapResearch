actuallesbians,fdpjtfr,t3_eml0yc,1578630573.0,"Me personally, I would not. My ex wife wasn‚Äôt out to her family and it was one factor that created strain on our relationship/marriage. I mean, 10+ years and I was still ‚Äúthis is my friend Blah and blah‚Äôs kids‚Äù.. (I have 2, not hers). I get maaaaaybe the first couple or three years but not at the point of the relationship where it‚Äôs serious and marriage is involved. I‚Äôm 100% out to everyone in my life, work, friends, family...no one gives two shits I‚Äôm a lesbian. I‚Äôm grateful for this, absolutely - but at this point, it‚Äôs a factor that plays into me choosing to not be involved with another person in the future, if she isn‚Äôt out to her family members."

TooAfraidToAsk,fdjr4ap,t3_elg1a9,1578484320.0,"Hey, I say whatever makes you feel comfortable and if sleeping with a stuffed animal helps you, then that‚Äôs what helps you. :) 

I‚Äôm 40, and have always slept with a ‚Äúblankie‚Äù, which is basically a cool cotton twin sheet. Even when traveling, it‚Äôs priority to go with me. My 16 year old daughter and 11 year old son both sleep with a blankie, they always have. My daughter has one from when she was a toddler then another one that‚Äôs not so old. My son has one from when he was also a toddler then has like 5 others that are similar to it. 

Take care. :)"

However, 2 other players over level 125, showed up and after a couple of minutes just standing around, one finally blew me away. Go figure."
