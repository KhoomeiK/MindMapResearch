I use a few of those and I'm happy and it costs 200-300-500USD for 3year old device.

my t61 is still working despite being 13years old. I switched to different laptop only because the cpu could not keep up (C2D 2.2GHz).

The first change you described gave us better working conditions and lower prices. That was a massive improvement. 
The second change went a bit sideways. One thing is that people pursued degrees or skills which are useless or unneeded. 
Second thing is sometimes employers dont recognize some skills as useful for them.

However there are organizations who try to close the gap. They analyze what employer need and try to match the best candidate from the pool.

The problem with that is the pool is not delivering whats needed.

Thats very popular opinion. I disagree. AI and CL is right now very good at matching stuff. Its not smart in any way. You can easily train even nit very bright person to do new simple job. To train AI for new task you need to hire fancy specialist and spend a lot of time.
Of course once trained you can easily switch from one task to another but in many cases its not needed.

Iam now looking at US reality.With my european background I can see how US is lacking.
The stuff US aims now (college degree, higher education, being not specialized in one job but being flexible) was naturally solved like 60-70 years ago in europe.
Germany, Eastern block had vocational and college like schools were a must in 1950-1960s.
And in those schools you did not became a specialist of one thing. You learned a lot to be able to shift from one industry to another (but similar, like mechanic/welder or carpenter/mason).

Lot of people in US does that but thats not really a common path. 

Thats one half of the problem.

The other half is employers mindset and the system. Employers need to realize that sometimes you need to pick a candidate and put an effort to train it and not to be fixed with the naming or expect strict prior experience in this role.
And the system part: US should shift to more freedom in many areas of employment or jobs.

IT is thriving because its not regulated.

Trades are kind of doing well.

Many other areas are heavily regulated, once you are certified and ready to work you are out of options, you are locked in.

The system needs to be more general. Certifications needs to be broaden to let people shift between positions.

Sorry for such long rant."

Over time the cost is equalized, price is low as it could be and there is equilibrium. If new player wants to enter the field he needs to agree to existing conditions. If there is a lot more players than positions they will be desperate and drive prices to the ground.

If not it should be) and school part of the property tax. Also by ems I mean fire and police. Im not sure who pays for ambulance.

Right now school and ems is the largest chunk of the property tax.
The rest is very little. So if an owner pays 3kCAD of tax, 1200 is school, another 1200 is ems, this leaves about 600 for all the infrastructure. 

And still I repeat, school and ems are not really bound to area. School is not much more expensive if the kids come from the distance. The same for police or firebrigade

So either, school and/or ems will save or become more efficient or city would bump the 600 to double that and all goes their way happy as now the issue is solved.

Winnipeg,fef69w6,t3_eorxqo,1579049182.0,"Complicated topic.

From my perspective: American cars dont have proper blinkers.
The blinkers of those cars are red which is confusing and they are not located on the sides of the cars. Which prevents people from seeing the intention of the merging cars.

Additionally a lot of places have this ""ending lane syndrom"" either because of parked cars or because the merging lane is short or actually nonexistent.

On top of that many drivers dont turn right into empty right lane because they are afraid that the car from their left will change the lane and they will be at fault.

How to fix: Simple solution: some paint job on the intersections plus lane designation will work in the summer. May be confusing in the winter when the lines are invisible.

More fancy solution is to add regulation that cars should have european style blinkers.

More expensive solution: remodel the roads allowing easier merging."

For others its a non issue as they dont install stuff besides their normal set of apps.

For another group it may be a problem if they run an update and the app breaks the way you described.

But that happens also on desktop, including windows in android or ios too (however not really frequently). 

To me this blog post is a bit grumpy. I dont know what you have been reading but I did not have an exposure to this overly positive and misleading news/info.

In most places I found pinephone (or linux on desktop in general) news or opinions its always stressed that its not for everybody and its not finished and its open source and so on.

So I react to it negatively as its mostly grumpiness and no constructive criticism.

And my other opinion:

I was very dissapointed seeing android gui when it was born.
I am still dissapointed with it and I dont find it in a state of ""customer ready product"". I have similar feelings towards windows 8/10 interface. The older devices had the interface consistent (windows CE, symbian, palmos) while android and windows got confusing (android hamburger menu being three dot menu or not being there at all and you have to use bottom soft menu button, windows having this tile interface mixed with old style windows mixed with the web style window contents and the list goes on).

Also the old style interfaces were very detailed. Lots of information was on screen. Now the only detailed piece is the status bar. All the rest must be finger reactive and the buttons are still huge despite we have so huge screens.

There is a large dormant group of people who want the old style GUI back. We want win98/lxde style gui. We want to have lots of info on screen, we want tiny fonts, crisp graphics.

For me Pinephone is a chance for that kind of liberation."

Second: When replacing them dont touch the glass. Like at all. Some people suggest to hold it in gloves but actually to replace them you dont have to touch the glass at all.

The oil/dirt from your fingers will degrade the glass.

When you replace the bulb be sure it fits. People sometimes stick the bulb wrong way and it gets out of focus.

As for public transport, north american cities which layout is grid could implement very nice pattern of bus routes which would work well. But the cities now are a mix of grid and baroque layouts.
And the routes usually go like ""from nowhere to nowhere through some key points and downtown"" Which works for some people. But not for many others.

When looking from stastical point of view that also does not matter. the differences are small. By small I mean 20-30-40% depending on case. Sometimes there is no change, sometimes its change for worse.
This will not influence significantly almost any of the things you mentioned.

I know this sound like old prick complaining but thats the truth.

I asked why because that influences the solution.

But ok. You want to change the above? Good. 
My solution: Move to a milder climate. Move to a place which is nearby a safeway and place to work. Maybe switch to remote work. the place should be close to schools.

This way you can fix all the issues as an individual.

But then you will ask, its not possible for everybody to move to such place!
Yes. Correct. This place should be like a big Chinese city. Lots of tall apartment buildings, all places of interest in close proximity. Solved?

Partially. You will still have to allow people to travel. Its not easy (even as for Canadian standards) to move places because you changed your job. 

You see where its heading? Do you prefer to have Winnipeg condensed to downtown like place? All population crammed into limited space with all of its pros and cons?

I see it differently, to change the car obsession you need to make it unneccessary. So more like no travel than bus travel. More like cheap and efficient travel than current public transport experience (bus is late, bus is crammed, next bus is empty but you are not sure if it is a ghost on bus display or real one, etc...). 

And most importantly, you need to make car unneccessary not by making it ridiculously bad option (no parking, parking fees, lane limits, move restrictions etc.)

To achieve this you not only need to make public transport and cycling better. You need to change almost whole city. Almost rebuild it. Are you ready for winnipeg rebuild discussion?"
Winnipeg,fdcet6o,t1_fdbz7sh,1578273146.0,"This is a evolutionary attempt to fix the issues.

It will help, a bit. It will improve some aspects but It will not change it much.

Based on my experience Winnipeg is not a bad place. It has its problems here and there but usually its not that bad. 

I dont want to sound like nay-sayer but its not possible to significantly change the situation without making fundamental changes.

You can tweak a bit here and there you can make an intersection more smooth and reorganize the traffic flow to make it more efficient. But in the end the individual people will calculate their effort and time wasted and in a lot of cases car will win. Even if you pay for like 40-60-80% of their bus fare.

If you want to make Winnipeg really good place to live you need to make a bigger change.

I shared some suggestions in some other threads (change the way neighbourhoods are planned - lindenwoods is a good example, make merging easier, put less traffic lights, separate local and transit traffic, organize places like university campus better so students dont have to travel that much, etc.) 

But to do that you need to have a plan and make the decision and stick to it.

And last hint.
In my old country there is a lot of places called ""new place"". Like New York or New caledonia etc.
Sometimes its better to start from scratch and create a new winnipeg on either side of the river so there is less topographical problems, clean slate and time for planning. Here in Winnipeg its possible. There is a lot of space still. With modern planning you can have new city which might be car free."

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/authority

: persons in command

: an individual cited or appealed to as an expert 

: convincing force 

In setting up standard there is no requirement for the authority to be any kind of highly established. If I run my own company and set my own standard, used solely by me, I am the authority. And I defined and used a standard. 

Dont blame me for using words exactly what they mean. The fact that usually they are used in slightly different context (the one you suggest and I am aware of) does not change the definition of the words.

Dictionary holds explanation of the word. There may be many meanings of the word. Thats it. If the standard had to be defined as an multiple entity concept it would be there. Its not.

You seem to ignore that there is a base meaning of the word and extended meaning. Both, standard and authority have very simple base meanings, the one I used. The extended meaning is the one you are thinking about.

If you dont agree with this interpretation then obviously you will not understand my point.

And explaining further, in algebra which explains a lot of logic there is a concept of a dimension. You seem to treat standards, authorities as entities which does not exist in lower dimensions. Thats logically false. 

Still, if you dont agree here, I see no point of arguing.

As for the last part.

I understand your point of view for standards as an implemented agreement between multiple entities. I know how it works. But you said you cant build standardization by yourself. And thats what spawned this offtopic.

The fact that minority agrees to something does not mean its right or true. 

This topic is controversial and as you can see spawns a lot of questions across philosophical stack. Im not trying to convince you. I am proposing my point of view and as a result I can see we dont agee on the basics. This is beautiful proof how delicate and complicated issue this is.

1. Powerstates (cpu throttling, screen dim, specific device power save states)

2. Standby (all processes are halted but still in memory.

3. Hibrenation (all is stopped and saved to disk).

There is no general way to tell process that it shoud react specifically to current power conditions. Each process may do in its own way. They may check the battery status or the charging state.

Yes, thats really what it is. The same applies to api. You can have api with single function used by single instance of single computer. Its still an api and it can be considered an standard and being adopted by someone else.

I know usually thats not the case but still, its standard.

As for API.
I understand what you are saying. But from my point of view it does not really matter. The issue is the api here. Whether its part of something more and patentable is not relevant. The point is that up until now we viewed API as a simple mindless stuff between meaty parts.

IMHO today API can and usually is something non trivial and therefore worth patenting or protection.

And on the same rule as you look at api, the beefy stuff behind may be often worthless without api. Its the other side of the coin, very often inseparable.

I get your point. Im not trying to convince you or convert, nor I am siding with anybody here.

As for the small company thing. Its almost never api only thing.

Its always api+logic behind.  And while some of the logic is patentable the api currently may be not. And as you can see, even if you copy api 1:1 there are still people who think its not an infringement.

For the small company its a lot of effort to build the solution (along with finding the best approach, failing many times AND getting the customers).

I can build a standard and use it all by myself. 

I agree that spreading standard is community action. But you dont have to have multiple entities to have working standard. Just one user can use it and it still will be standard.

In the context I provided the api is a standard. And its adopted between vendor and clients. Its not an effortless work. the vendor needs to put effort to design the api. Its not merely a bunch of random calls with random parameters. Its published to clients, they may use it. 

But to copy api and the concept behind it is a different matter.

Api is an equivalent of a story. Its written with words (network/os calls) the words may be generic - non patentable but the whole piece will be patentable. Or at least its not obvious that its not."
