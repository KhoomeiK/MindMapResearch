adderall,fcvd2rh,t3_eiacip,1577999567.0,When I’m having trouble with dry mouth I’ll buy those Liquid IV packs that you mix into water. Has electrolytes and low sugar (as opposed to sports drinks). Really helps the dehydration/dry mouth.
adderall,fcvclm7,t3_ej3gi9,1577999279.0,I’m in between 5-10mg per day depending on what I’m doing. Mine sits at around 100. I’m a dog trainer so when I’m working with the dogs it sometimes gets up to 120-130.

AskReddit,fcpdwln,t3_eic8yl,1577859839.0,Yes. I would’ve wasted less time telling myself that I couldn’t follow my passion and still be happy. I would’ve been happier sooner. Glad to have my perspective now but it would’ve been more fun to do it sooner.

AskMen,fcg1i58,t3_egz7x9,1577635624.0,"What about finding a job that combines your passion for the outdoors and work? If you’re just out of college there’s no reason to take a job you fundamentally hate YET. This is the time to try all the shit. Regardless if you fail or not you’ll learn. And you won’t have regrets. I think the worst part about working 40 hours a week in a job you hate, is the REGRET. Don’t do that to yourself. At least try to make yourself happy before you settle."

teenagers,fc9l3d6,t3_egp26y,1577554272.0,"Losing a dog is one of the worst pains. They are there with you through everything, for more than a decade you had someone that would love you without conditions or judgement. There is no timeline on this grief. If anyone dismisses your pain or gives you any shit about “just a dog” tell them to fuck off. Grief if just love with no place to go. 

After my guy passed, I took my time, and realized I needed to honor him in some way. I was given the skills and the passion to train people to teach their dogs. So after a bit of time, I started a business helping people be the best humans for their dogs so I could try to let them have the relationship that I had with my dog. This was my coping mechanism. But If and when you’re ready, you can honor her by volunteering at your local shelter, offering to foster dogs until they find homes with local rescues, or walking friends dogs for them. No rush to get a new dog yet, but there are things you can do to fill the need to put that love somewhere, even temporarily if you’d like. 

I’ll leave you with this poem that made me cry my eyes out but also made me feel better. 


“It feels bittersweet to love you, as though time has already run its ruinous path and everything good is over before it begins. It feels perilous to love you, like a dust scorn swallowing up the sky or a comet skimming the stratosphere. But it is an honor to love you. Like the snow drifts giving way to spring, I will hold you for as long as I can.” — Lang Leav"

myfavoritemurder,fc3npjz,t3_efxjzb,1577394092.0,Super weird that a show that you get FOR FREE you’re complaining about. Just maybe turn it off or just enjoy what you get instead of complaining? But y’all live your lives the way ya want.
confusing_perspective,fc0kxaa,t3_efcef1,1577293318.0,Hahaha thank you for this.
rarepuppers,fbz9kb1,t3_ef67cl,1577239379.0,"I know this is supposed to be funny and lighthearted.. which it is without context. BUT if your dog consistently does this to the point where they are obsessed with their tail/legs/etc it CAN be a form of OCD. If that’s the case, a veterinary behaviorist can assess them and maybe provide medication to balance out the brain chemicals. Or a normal vet can be talked to about it, but if you can find a vet behaviorist do it. Extreme Tail chasing and separation anxiety are diagnosable mental illnesses in dogs, after years of research. Just your local dog trainer trying to help. I’ve seen dogs with this kind of mental state be medicated and lived much happier lives. Imagine waking up everyday with the obsession of hurting yourself, isn’t a fun place to live mentally. 

If this isn’t the case ignore me!"
