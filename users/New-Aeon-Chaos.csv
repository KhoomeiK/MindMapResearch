aww,fdom87c,t3_emc9vi,1578607997.0,Is your friend Kirk Windstein from the band Crowbar?
wholesomememes,fdl0wc8,t1_fdjyc9x,1578515098.0,"I can kind of agree with it being metal but, it's nowhere near the level of heaviness as their earlier stuff, in my opinion. The new album, in terms of heaviness, doesn't come close to songs like Lunar Strain, December Flower, Food For The Gods, Coerced Coexistence, or Pinball Map."
wholesomememes,fdkzyj2,t1_fdkjhbu,1578514599.0,"Lunar Strain through to, and including Clayman are amazing. Colony has always been my favourite but, I have no idea why."
wholesomememes,fdjxrlk,t1_fdjxn8y,1578490839.0,"Fucking brilliant way of putting it, haha. At The Gates were the opposite, made a masterpiece, disappeared, then returned with a banger."
wholesomememes,fdjxaw0,t1_fdjx4g1,1578490451.0,"Fuck yeah, just put them into my Spotify. Will give them a listen and keep my eye on them and show it around."
wholesomememes,fdjwx5v,t1_fdjwoa7,1578490120.0,"I like all of Soilwork, but their first four albums are just godly."
wholesomememes,fdjwh09,t1_fdjvzs9,1578489731.0,"Alot of what I see is because of the reason why they changed. They altered their sound to appeal to more people, it was a business decision (this is their job, I get understand it), Bodom did the same thing then went back to making more technical albums. I purely don't like the new albums because they just don't do anything for me, I find them a bit boring, especially compared to the uniqueness of they're older material."
wholesomememes,fdjw77k,t1_fdjvy0z,1578489494.0,"Love that idea for a tattoo. Haha, fuck Limewire, those were the days.

Well, better late than never to get into any band :) glad to have helped someone find new bands. I'll give Dosarmonka Mundi a look, big fan of Speeds vocals."
wholesomememes,fdjvpu0,t1_fdjvlmd,1578489061.0,"I'm a big fan of both bands, I live in Melbourne where they're from :). Check out Twelve Foot Ninja, they're from Melbourne too, they're not prog, but do alot of genre jumping/bending."
wholesomememes,fdjvcr7,t1_fdjvagk,1578488727.0,"Mate, I love Clayman it's an amazing album. Even Reroute and Come Clarity have a couple of songs I like each."
wholesomememes,fdjv9kb,t1_fdjv51s,1578488643.0,"I'm a fan of Ensiferum, Mors Principium Est, Winter Sun and Try. I forgot to mention them, same as Swallow the Sun. I will give Suidaka and Harikiri for the Sky a look though!"
wholesomememes,fdjv56v,t1_fdjv2gs,1578488528.0,"Ahhh, yeah. They're playing Download festival soon here in Melbourne. I don't even know if I'll bother seeing them based on the latest setlist."
wholesomememes,fdjv2kc,t1_fdjuxlv,1578488460.0,Swamplord and The Black Waltz 10/10 albums
wholesomememes,fdjv0hw,t1_fdjutmt,1578488407.0,Is old school melodic death not your thing? Or is it more what they turned into has turned you off them?
wholesomememes,fdjuwdy,t1_fdjpel1,1578488302.0,"I agree. Watershed was decent, but holy shit did it pale compared to the genius of Ghost Reveries."
wholesomememes,fdjut0n,t1_fdjt5tg,1578488215.0,"Ehhh, they started as Doom. I'd say they're more Gothic metal these days."
wholesomememes,fdjunwu,t1_fdjuei4,1578488080.0,"They're kind of their own thing. They spawned djent, but aren't djent. Probably Avant-garde?
Metalcore is like Bullet for my Valentine, Killswitch Engage, As I Lay Dying that kind of stuff."
wholesomememes,fdjum5c,t1_fdjst2j,1578488033.0,"Mate, hit up the albums Destory Erase Improve, Chaosphere and Nothing to start with. Also, the song Clockworks off their latest album is a fucking banger."
wholesomememes,fdjtejx,t1_fdjoxbu,1578486845.0,"None of them are melodic death, they're core. Unless you were just listing bands you like, then carry on :)"
wholesomememes,fdjszmv,t1_fdjsxwu,1578486423.0,"Mate, I will suck your dick to just let me see that vinyl.

No homo"
wholesomememes,fdjsy5d,t1_fdjphzg,1578486379.0,Them and Kalmah are two of the most underrated bands out there.
wholesomememes,fdjsvw8,t1_fdjstk3,1578486313.0,"Still an amazing band, I'd rate them up there with Cattle Decapitation and old-medium era Decapitated."
wholesomememes,fdjstlt,t1_fdjnqo2,1578486245.0,That's a funny way of spelling Fiction :)
wholesomememes,fdjsr60,t1_fdjr8w6,1578486175.0,"I'd have to say Natural Born Chaos, and Predators Portrait are my favourites. Verkligheten just didn't really do anything for me, even after multiple listens."
wholesomememes,fdjshz0,t1_fdjsguv,1578485897.0,Digging the name. They're painfully underrated.
wholesomememes,fdjrhrn,t1_fdjrdxr,1578484761.0,"Ah shit, I forgot about Mors Principium Est, and Swallow The Sun come to think of it! I'll give Sunnata a look. I also forgot Stam1na, they sing in Finnish."
wholesomememes,fdjnvak,t1_fdjnt4e,1578480029.0,"It does, looking at Jester Race and Colony then looking at the last 10-15 years is so disappointing."
wholesomememes,fdjneea,t1_fdjncsw,1578479354.0,"I only said that because I thought I remembered reading that the frontman said they're more rock, and not metal."
wholesomememes,fdjncht,t1_fdjltvc,1578479282.0,"Insomnium, Soilwork, At The Gates, Dark Tranquillity, In Flames (90's albums), Children of Bodom, Be'lakor, Amorphis, and Kalmah are a good starting point."
wholesomememes,fdjn9hg,t1_fdjjq39,1578479160.0,Ghost are rock.
