movies,ff7dhgn,t1_ff6uvtg,1579647026.0,"> Disagree - our brains can still tell when a stunt is real and well done.

That's just not true, look at behind the scenes stuff on modern action movies, there are usually dozens of scenes full of CGI that no one would have suspected to be fake. Especially stuff like car crashes are usually done in CG now and it has gotten so good that people just can't tell the difference anymore - if it's done well. 

> Heavy CGI tends to come with bad lighting

Where the hell did you get that from?

Dark scenes with bad lighting is only used to obscure bad, rushed CGI, good CG is easily good enough to fool people's eyes no matter how bright it is (except for specific elements like human faces, but we're getting there)."
