wow,ffexbch,t1_ffevr96,1579869258.0,"did we or was that all one of his Illusions >?

Im going on the assumption that the entire fight never happened and that we are dead. But because both us and the Old Gods dont suffer death like other mortals do he has a plan that involves the true enemy, Death itself.

All he needs is for us to go into the Shadowlands and deal with it for him, we are key here since we cant die truly either but the Old Gods cannot enter The Shadowlands.

Remember in Lore the Old Gods do not die like other mortal races, they are beyond the cycle of life and death.

Im assuming he needs the Death machine working again, no new souls is bad for both the light and the void and neither side can let Death win so it falls onto us the Heroes to set things right, even if it means helping our enemy.

of course I could be wrong and Blizzard really is lacking some decent story writers, but nothing about the fight with N'zoth makes any sense."
