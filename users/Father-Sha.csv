Dude is 100% muscle mass. Muscle weighs more than fat I thought we learned that in middle school. Jokic is legitimately fat. Raymond Felton is actually fat. Zion is not fat. Not even a little bit.

todayilearned,ffajzgl,t1_ffa3ngb,1579737624.0,"My argument is not ""AB's problems are recent"". My argument is why can't AB's problems be CTE related? Why do all these other football players get the CTE pass for their behavior but when it's AB its ""that's just the way he is""? Because CTE invokes sympathy and I believe AB's attitude combined with his race makes many individuals reluctant to be sympathetic of his mental state. Nope. He's just a bad apple. I guarantee you AB suffers from CTE as well. It is likely the cause of his behavioral problems. Mix that with a turbulent/violent upbringing in Gehttosville, USA and there you have it."

nba,fep05zp,t1_feowolg,1579309193.0,"What made me realize how complex really is was watching Red on Roundball videos on YouTube. These are videos from the late 70s and early 80s where the late Celtics coach Red Auerbach teaches simple basketball stuff with various basketball stars of the time (Dr. J, Larry Bird, Pistol Pete, Bill Russell, Wes Unseld, etc). Red would say to do something and he would be so vague about it yet the players (all of them) would instantly know what to whether they were on defense or offense. He would ask them questions about stuff and their deep knowledge of the game just baffles me. And that was back then. Imagine how much more complicated and intricate the game has become since then."

todayilearned,felm7tc,t1_felc5jx,1579225523.0,"Well just wait a second there buddy. That isn't a black and white scenario. If a man is having sex with a woman who claims she is on birth control and then she instantly pops up as pregnant and flat out refuses to get an abortion, should the man be forced to be a father? When that isnt what he wanted and he thought he was engaging in responsible sex practices to avoid it? Flip the scenario. A man tells a woman he is sterile and she gets pregnant. She wants to have an abortion but he forces her not to and pushes her into motherhood. Is that right? The fucked up thing about it is women hold all the cards once she's pregnant. ""My body my choice"". Well then it sounds like some women are choosing to be single mothers."

And it came out in the 90s. Theres very little crossover appeal. If you dont like ultra black music then you probably won't like Aaliyah. A lot of hip hop and rnb today is tailored to appeal to a much more diverse audience. 90s rnb was made specifically for black people. So I can understand why a lot of this sub wouldn't like it. This sub is mostly white males. Don't think a lot of white males are listening to 90s rnb lol. That being said, I'm black and I've never cared much for rnb myself.

Yea, that's kind of the problem. White people seem to feel as if they can buy their way into black culture like they have bought their way into everything else. That's probably Noname's issue. She's making music for a group of people that probably cant afford to go see her shows. It's a conundrum. Most black artists aren't sitting down with the pen and pad and thinking about what their white audience would want to hear. They're speaking on what they know. They're speaking to the people they know. Black culture and black people. But they also want to make a killing and that means catering to the audience with a disposable income. Middle class, young white people. It's a weird area to be in. You can make music exclusively for a middle class white audience and recieve all the money but none of the respect (Flo Rida), you can make music exclusively for your niggas in the streets and make significantly less money (Webbie) or you can find a middle ground and have both sides scrutinize you for something (all of the greats, like Jay Z)."
