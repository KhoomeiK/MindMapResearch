That's not my response, it a portion of it. I explicitly clarify that it is console focused and newer game focused later on. Old PC games for a penny is irrelevant. Subscription services are irrelevant. Different games that are free to play is irrelevant. If you looking at buying a given game for your console, the physical copy is usually available cheaper between used copies and better sales than the console monopoly stores and does not depreciate to worthless the second you buy it.

> Then I reminded you about subscription services, bundles, f2p, and free games with no strings attached, all of which are exclusively digital....

Subscriptions are not exclusively digital. Have you never heard of a fucking library? Lol. There's also gamefly. Either way, that's not buying a game. 

Bundles aren't exclusively digital. 

Free to play yes, but you don't buy them, so moot point. If you're looking at a game to buy and comparing digital or physical, a different game being free to play is totally irrelevant.

No, I said that originally but your illiteracy got in the way.

Where exactly did I say gamestop would be doing okay? Again, you're illiteracy is the problem here. All I said was that at the moment, if you're going to buy a game on consoles, you'll save more and have more flexibility going physical. 


Maybe you're angry about being illiterate, maybe you're angry about being wrong, maybe you're just angry and haven't read a word I've said... either way you're wrong, on irrelevant tangents, and making things up.

Sure, game passes are just getting good, but that's not buying a digital game. I'm not dismissing them at all, I have Xbox game pass for PC as it's insanely cheap at the moment for what you get. However, games are often (not always) older, you only have the limited selection of publisher you choose, may need multiple to get what you want, and some game simply aren't there. Physical is often still cheaper to get what you want without limitations, plus you can always keep it forever if you want, you have the option. Digital purchases can't be sold, and subscriptions are temporary with continual fees. 


Yes, physical sales match digital. Not the other way around. Because Sony, MS, Nintendo run digital monopolies (PC us much better), their sales are shit and don't match amazon or whatever. Buying a digital game, especially console, is almost always a terrible idea in terms of price and flexibility, that's just the way it is. Sure, steam sale for $4 on a old game, go for it. Buying a new console AAA title released in the last year or two, probably should never go digital."

BattlefieldV,fefxqki,t1_feeq3kt,1579068712.0,"Who in their right mind would say the dropping of BF4 content was good? You either never played the game when it was actually dropping or have extreme amnesia. Can people please stop acting like disaster that was BF4 never happened. You want to know why BFV is a shit show, like every other fucking battlefield? Because they know you're all goldfish and will forget how they fucked everything up 30 seconds later and start praising it as the best thing ever. 


The game released and immediately dropped 2 expansion by Christmas, which was 40% of the game's expansions. 40% of the expansions right away is terrible pacing and frequency, it's just dropping a larger initial games. Which is fine, but nonsense to call an expansion or support and makes for longer delays between content. Not to mention that game was a literally unplayable dumpster fire so the concept it getting any sort of expansion was laughable. But of course none of this work was done after release so they just dropped them anyways and then fucked off for Christmas with a broken game that had seen no major patching. The expansions were also fucking broken and unfinished, just like the rest of the game. China rising was shit full of unbreakable bugged trees and other nonsense on release. 


Then by April they rolled out the third expansion, to a game that was still literally not playable in a 64 person lobby, not to mention a whole host of other issues. The new naval maps where the absolute worst offenders of the entire game, absolute dogshit performance. They had promised the date in stone, so made it even if it meant to leaving a completely fucked game for months longer. 


They then started to actually fix the fucking game, and rolled out the other two expansions at August and December. 


The of course, these release dates had a whole host of fucking shenanigans going on. Did you have premium? Where you on Xbox one? No? Then fuck you. 


BF4 is an example of everything not to do. The only exception is it being an excellent example of how to fix a pile of shit a year later, but most of the DLC fell in the absolute trainwreck period. 


As for your claims that BF4 had more than BF1 and BF1 had issues with how long it way between expansion, these are just outright false. BF1 had the same amount of expansion content as BF4. BF4 has 5 expansions of 4, BF1 had 6, 6, 4, 5. Same thing. 


As for length between new content, BF1 was shorter. The major thing that changed was the schedule was delayed to start a few months after release rather than starting immediately, which did not do anything with the time between. This delay turned out to be a good thing because they could then focus on patches after release, they were able to actually incorporate some feedback into the first expansions, and you'd don't need a whole host of new content dumped on when the entire game is already new anyways. BF1 however had a higher frequency/less time between content, depsite almost an identical schedule to BF4 ignoring the delay,  because they split the expansions into half releases.


The ONLY thing BF4 did better than BF1 when it came to expansion content release was the couple extra complementary maps DICE LA made during the couple year support period. It would have been nice to have this extra support for BF1 too, but unfortunately they had to rush out BFV where as BF4 had more time due to the hardline flop coming inbetween from a different studio."
Games,fefrori,t1_fefehyi,1579063220.0,"> It's so much more cheaper and convenient to just buy it off client. 

Except it's not, at all. Physical is way, way cheaper. Digital is overpriced as fuck for what you actually get and what is actually cost to sell. Where do people come up with this shit? 


New games typically have identical physical and digital prices, with rare exceptions like where Blizzard sold overwatch cheaper digital... but only from their own store. However, you can usually get pre-order discounts, new game discounts, pre-order sale, trade-in bonus that can easily cut a new game price by ~30%. Even with digital tax loop holes in some places, physical is still usually cheaper. Newer games rarely if ever have cheap digital prices, unless someone is trying to promote their client (see overwatch). PC's almost irrelevant to the discussion anyways, because physical is pretty much nonexistent. For consoles, MS, Sony, and Nintendo run monopolies that have far worse offerings than say steam. The digital game prices are fucking horrendous. 


And then after a game comes out, you can almost immediately but a used physical copy for less. Slightly less at Game stop or equivalent, even more of a discount from other people. Digital Games won't be close to being on sale for months unless the game flops hard. Physical is easy to loan and share too, so you can divide the price on single player games quite easily with friends/family. And when you're done, you can sell your copy. If you don't hold onto a game for years and it's not your active go to game, you will easily get over half your money back. So in essence, all physical games are at least half price even without a sale.


Once a game is two, three years old you can definitely find cheap digital offerings that are compatible to the physical market. At that point, it may be worth the convenience **if** you have the internet plan. Three year old games or ones you intend to keep forever while also needed immediately at release and didn't plan or have time to shop around, those are the only times digital is comparable. And just comparable, not drastically cheaper. 


Plus, physical can't be hacked (although could be stolen). Physical can't be banned. You can return physical with excellent return policies. You can back charge with physical without all your previous game purchases being held ransom. You can cancel pre-orders of physical. You don't have to pay for pre-order or physical until it's in your hands. The digital stores have god awful fucking business practices. Sony can go fuck themselves if they think their store is acceptable platform. The law needs to crack down on them hard for the protection of the consumer. 


Jedi Fallen Order cost me $5, between a pre-order sale and then selling it when I beat it. There is simply no argument that digital is cheaper, it's just fucking nonsense. I *wish* it was cheaper, and had better business practices. It should be cheaper as there's no manufacturing, no transportation, no store or warehouse to pay for, minimal employees to operate, and no risk of resale for the seller to try and cover. It's better for the environment. With the right Internet, was easier and quicker than going to the store or delivery. You don't have the clutter of disks. You don't have to swap disks. It takes the same amount of hard drive space either way. My internet actually seems to go faster than a PS4 BluRay drive for installs. I can do it drunk and play it right then."

askscience,fdlrx57,t3_eltlyf,1578531048.0,"> Is this related to the pauli exclusion principle and splitting of energy levels on a large scale to the point where they become effectively continuous?


Yes, you answered your own question right here. Energy levels don't exist for bulk collections of atoms, near continuous bands do (with a certain density of states).

Take [diatomic hydrogen](https://opentextbc.ca/introductorychemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2014/06/h2_MO_energy_diagram.png) for example. Even with just two, the atoms' electrons shift to two different states slightly off of the isolated atom valence energy level. The one you'll note is lower that the isolated atom, and this is exactly what hydrogen bonds to H2, the energy level is lower. With a bulk macroscopic chunk of matter, this happens a trillion billion whatever times, and you get an effectively continuous valence band instead of valence energy level. 


Is there intermediate? Yes. Ever heard of the new quantum dots TVs?  That's exactly what that is, small ""dots"" of atoms behave somewhere between a continuous band and an energy level and have more ""quantum"" behavior, hence quantum dot, and from this you can get very pure colours. 


So why are some solids transparent and other aren't? 


Well, firstly let's ignore anything messy. Ice for example is clear, but as soon as you make small powered like snows it's not. A brick is actually sort of messy, lots of small particles or a variety of compounds. Some of the crystals in a brick are clear. A messy object is never going to be transparent. 


The continuous bands don't actually have to touch each other. They can sometimes overlap, but they can sometimes still be seperated by a certain amount of energy that an electron cannot have. Take metals. They are always opaque, and usually silver which is just white but specular reflection. Why? The valence band and the one above it that is empty (unless an electron is excited) overlap. It's dubbed the conduction band, because it's responsible for electrical conduction. Due to this, an electron has an available state to move into with any amount of energy. So metals are opaque from radiowave right up to the visible spectrum. They also can immediately reemitt the photon, hence they reflect anything from RF to visible. Although, most start to struggle at reflecting in the UV, and some at blue. Why gold and copper are slightly reddish. 


Other materials have an energy gap between levels, called a band gap. If it's close, they're a semiconductor. Like silicon. If it's large, they're an insulator, like diamond. If visible light happens to fall within an energy in this gap, they're transparent. Like diamond, glass, ice, etc. Again, at least while in a nice organized macroscopic crystal or even glass. Again, powder them and you lose it.

> follow-up question: what prevents a brick from re-emitting e.g. 650nm radiation when i shine a 650nm laser on it? It's my understanding that it would instead sequester all of the non-reflected energy from my laser as heat energy which is then dissipated as (broadband?) infrared.

It might. Metals will do it. A red object would do it quite close. A green object won't. A transparent object won't. 

Because a photon is not the only particle it can emit and it can take intermediate steps to different bands and subbands on the way done. 


It can also emit a phonon, a quantization of the vibration of the atomic lattice. Phonon to phone as photon is to photo. It's a sound particle, although unorganized sound is just random vibrations, aka heat. 


Take silicon for example. Great semiconductor, can absorb light just fine in solar panels. However, can't make an LED. Electrons simply won't fall back down the same way that incoming visible light can excite them up. They end up needing a momentum shift as well for the easiest way back down, and light carries almost no momentum. An state/energy level isn't just energy, it's also momentum. Imagine it like it needs to move sideways and down, the sideways being momentum space. The lowest spot of the conduction band and highest spot of the valence band in silicon are offset sideways by a large amount of momentum.  That's where a phonon comes in, happy to exchange a lot of momentum with an electron, so most electrons in silicon go back down via a phonon rather than a visible or near IR photon.  


Take fluorescence or phosphorescence as another example. UV light comes in, visible light comes out. Why?

Hydrogen gas is not really better than water, you're going to have to break both apart into a plasma anyways. To bring up diatomic hydrogen being uncommon in regards to a fusion reactor is just absurd. 



The question of hydrogen sourcing for a nuclear reactor has nothing to do with the molecule, and everything to do with the isotope. Water or diatomic hydrogen, we don't actually want hydrogen. We want tritium or deuterium, which are significantly rarer in any hydrogen containing molecule. Fusing hydrogen-1 is pretty much out of the question, even the sun is bottlenecked by taking million of years to actually get the first steps steps of the reaction down with raw protons.  From there's is easy with deuterium or tritium lying around, which is where we would need to start from. Unless we crack some super efficient fusion method that's better than stars. Leptons heavier than electrons are a feasible way to drastically increase the viability of fusion, but good luck finding any muons or taus lying around."

askscience,fdgw1tu,t3_el64mw,1578409743.0,"No, scaling size does not preserve properties like you are implying. 


There is what is known as the cubed-squared law. Assuming shape and proportions are kept consistent, if you change the linear dimension of something by a factor, you change the surface area by the square of that factor and the volume by the cube of that factor. Really easy to consider a cube to see if this makes sense. Take a 1x1x1 cube. Height of 1. Surface area of 1x1x6 = 6. Volume of 1x1x1 = 1. Double the height to 2x2x2. Surface area is now 2x2x6 = 24 (4x the original). Volume is now 2x2x2 = 8 (8x the original). 


When you say ""scaling down one of them to 1/4 of the original"" I assume you mean a linear dimension. So if it was 1m high, it's now 0.25m and the exact same shape. 


This means the volume, and hence weight, is now 0.25^3 less. The weight is cut by 1/64 (1.6%). 25% of the size is nowhere near 25% of the weight. 


As for structural strength, that's loosely attached to surface area. The strength of a column for example is more or less dependent on the surface area of it. So your 25% cut to size would roughly cut the strength to 1/16 (6.3%). It's a little more complicated than that, but that's a ball park. You also reduced the weight, so it does gain a little in not having to support as much of itself. 


These scaling rules are why things such as an ant can carry so much and have weirdly different anatomy. A horse sized ant would just collapse it tiny legs, forget being able to carry many times it's weight."

In earth's case the conducting fluid just happens to be mostly liquid iron, which is also ferromagnetic. The sun and Jupiter do it too, and they aren't nickel or iron. The sun's is made hydrogen-helium plasma and Jupiter's is likely liquid metallic hydrogen.  


Iron would never be above carbon, it's heavier than it. So if there's a carbon core (somehow, not sure how you get a vast amount of carbon as the heaviest element from stellar remnants), you'd need to have a carbon or lighter mantle. Is liquid carbon conductive? I don't know, and I don't think there much research on the topic given it takes extreme pressures as carbon usually just skips right to a gas at low pressures.


The lack of a magnetic field also wouldn't rule out life due to intense radiation. The atmosphere does most of the blocking for us. The magnetic field does nothing for UV or strong cosmic rays, it only deflects the charged particle solar wind, slowing atmosphere loss. It would just rule out a few billion year prolonged atmosphere like in Mars' case. Mars likely did have a thicker atmosphere in its 4-5 billion year history, it just doesn't have much of one now and that's likely in part to lacking a magnetic field. You could still have a sea, possibly under ice, that would block the radiation without a magnetic field for billions of years. Or an atmosphere simply because there's more of it and quicker replenishment than the solar wind can strip away. Like with Venus, which is much closer than Earth or Mars so faces stronger solar wind, is less massive than Earth, has no magnetic field, and yet still has a denser atmosphere than Earth. Life as we know it's probably not on Venus, but it's not because it's lacking a magnetic field."

The game launched with an RNG loot box system that paid out powerful upgrades adding additional abilities and large stat buffs with zero tradeoffs. It was earn loot boxes and luck to win.


They never intended to launch with the microtransactions for the loot boxes. Like every other game, those were to come in a month later when the reviews were done, the copies are sold, and the player base is engaged. All they did was simply not turn on the microtransactions a month later like they intended to. 


The launch state of the game was the pay-to-win game they always were intending to launch. They just never ended up turning on the transactions for loot boxes, so it left the game as an intentionally frustratingly slow, random grind-to-win experience. The paid shortcut pass around the shitty experience to the powerful items just wasn't added. Better than pay to win, but still a shitty game.


A few months later, after Christmas, they actually changed the game's unlock system and moved into a cosmetic microtransaction system. Not that they changed all that much, they just added a leveling system that gave unlock tokens instead of loot boxes letting you pick what you want. The game is still fundamentally a terrible competitive multiplayer experience, as grinding the game out still gets you objective upgrades with stat boost and additional abilities with no trade off. You just can't pay to make the bullshit go away, and the choice rather than loot boxes means you can work towards the best powerful upgrades you want as quick as possible. The pay to win foundation is still there to this day and still hurting the game. If the game was actually fixed, it would be a truly fair shooter experience like overwatch or at the very least a reasonably balanced progression game with tradeoffs like say CoD or battlefield.

If you take your standard shooter for example. Shoot and aim are on the triggers. Usually grenade, mark, special ability or somethings of that nature are on the bumpers. Then sprint is in the left stick and melee on the right stick. Games are struggling for more buttons, hence both bumpers pressed at the same time is used by most games now as an additional thumbless button. 


Things like reload or swap weapon are usually fine on the inferior letter/face buttons as you can give up moving or aiming to do them. D-pad also acting as a seperate set of thumb buttons that is also full because again games are struggling with button limitations.  However, jump and prone/crouch are also on the letter/shape buttons, even if you usually want to do these things while actively aiming and moving. These rear buttons would take things like jump or prone and allow you to aim and move at the same time.
