ElizabethWarren,ffa1hbb,t1_ff9hfnu,1579725983.0,Hopefully she campaigns for Amy McGrath as well. Mitch needs to be taken out.

They had someone who was a part of Epic bullshit everyone on the status of the game, in the closing weeks. I (naively) asked about their plans to fix matchmaking (which was notoriously bad). The person was like, ""YEAH THEY'RE TOTALLY LOOKING INTO IT STAY TUNED"", that kind of bullshit. It was infuriating."

I just can't fathom how people can be against the CFPB. I get it, ""they vote against their best interests"" and all of that nonsense, but man...it's rough."

democrats,feupfin,t1_fesigv0,1579388733.0,That's what I don't understand. What is being done to censure this motherfucker? And then what is being done as far as investigating him goes?
Impeach_Trump,fetlbfb,t1_fes1jof,1579376528.0,I agree with you...in a general sense...but how can this specific issue concerning Nunes be remedied?

Economics,fen5jqx,t1_fen0pcf,1579277447.0,Houston is overpriced as far as the rental market is concerned. All of the major Texas cities used to brag about cheaper rentals. Now they can't.

You would if you engage in schemes where you don't pay as much as you're legally supposed to, leading to tax fraud.

Her (cop-out and bullshit) response? ""Well, all I know is at the end of the day, that guy (\*points to the ceiling\*) decides how everything goes"". I almost laughed out loud in her face, but just walked away, like ""how goddamn fucking stupid are these people?""."
