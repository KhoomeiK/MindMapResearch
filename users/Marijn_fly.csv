Hue,ff9ag7u,t3_esd1i7,1579708521.0,Try resetting the bulbs using a Dimmer Switch or the Philips Hue Bluetooth app by holding it close to a bulb and pressing the on and off buttons for 10 seconds. The bulb should flash three times. Then find them again with the 'normal' Philips Hue app and see if that solves the problem.

aviation,ff97o7k,t3_esc7hu,1579706755.0,"Last summer, I spotted this plane from a glider near Ommen in the Netherlands, flying towards the east (while on it's way to Roskilde). I wanted to have a closer look at it, which is not easily done while flying a glider.

I expected that it would trace the many B-17 memorial sites in this part of the country to pay tribute. So I decided to ambush it at the most eastern one in the area. 

The plan worked. I think the B-17 flew over every single memorial site. But the thermal I had to use wasn't very strong and I ran out of time to climb. I still got a brillant view of this plane in flight."

IOT,ff75aoz,t3_erffx4,1579641406.0,"My home devices have a bootcounter which stores the boot number into the RTC memory so it  will survive a sleep cycle. When reporting data, it also includes the boot number. When the backend notices that the boot number is lower than the previous boot number (bootnumber is 1 after a crash), then the backend sends me an email, which adds a timestamp. That's it. When I get 1 multiple times after each other, then I know the device has crashed on successive boots. This primitive system could be extended with more debugging info.

My experience so far leads me to software design which runs in robust sleep cycles and fails gracefully. Occasional crashes should not harm the overall functionality. I have devices running for weeks on end and then suddenly crash and start running for weeks again. Really, how much time would you spend debugging such a situation?"
Gliding,ff72ijv,t1_ff6x8d3,1579639817.0,"It's true that the principal function of Flarm is to act as a safety device and that should not be restricted in any way. Encryption would require a new model to be installed by everyone. That is not going to happen anytime soon for a variety of reasons. But it is a ridiculous situation. Flarm was ahead of it's time more than two decades ago. Now, as a connected device, it would not pass the most primitive demands on security a cheap Chinese chip would.

New hardware is needed to fulfill the safety feature in a secure way, at a price point which would render Flarm obsolete instantly.

But it takes a considerable investment of money and time to get any hardware using radio functions certified. If it's also related to aviation, then double that. And then per global area. 

So at both ends, the end-users and the manufacturers, there is no will to innovate."

A cat is a predator by nature. If you have a problem with that, then don't take cat. It's actually very *selfish* to insist on having a cat for the comfort of it but at the same time deny the cat any opportunity to live a cat's life. 

Outdoor cats often look much happier than indoor cats. Many indoor cats are obviously overweight and will get kidney problems due to amonotonous diet and lifestyle."

Gliding,fddoym6,t3_ekk7zq,1578319988.0,I've seen some pictures about the unfortunate animals in Australia. I feel sick about it. So sad. Soaring would't be on my mind.
cats,fddobag,t1_fddmyip,1578319420.0,"What sort of risk scares you most? Busy roads with traffic? Dogs? Fights with other cats? Neighbours who hate cats? The cat getting lost? The cat getting itself locked up somewhere? 

My cats have bluetooth trackers on their collars. That gives some peace of mind.

If there is a good reason for not letting your cat out, then don't do it. But if it's only your fear, then you should overcome it. Your cat will be happier."
cats,fddmbb9,t3_ektu06,1578317608.0,"If there are no direct threats outside, consider letting your cat go without a line. Cats need to roam freely."

Every piece of good news is very welcome."

Hue,fd870o4,t3_ek6bxc,1578214589.0,"You can use them as normal bulbs by flipping the light switch. But they will turn on with maximum brightness.

You can also download 'Philips Hue Bluetooth' if your device supports it, and then control the bulbs using bluetooth."
Hue,fd86jog,t3_ek8sfp,1578214388.0,"There are three types of GU10 spots, white, white ambiance and color ambiance. So you have to be more specific which ones you're after. 

Also, I think current products are labeled as gen3, but I am not sure if it's even relevant.

They ran out of stock globally it seems. New stock should become available in time."
homeassistant,fd7z9wd,t1_fd7s8jz,1578212107.0,That is a great analysis. Very insightful.
homeassistant,fd7v56i,t1_fd6m37g,1578210600.0,"Possible. It's a bit beyond my knowledge, but a protocol is an angreement to do things in a certain way. I would consider BLE more as a transport layer. 

We're operating at the byte level here, so I don't think it's necessary to even know what protocol is in use. The way I see it:

BLE is the road. The protocol is the side on which you should drive.

What we're doing is first trying the left side and see if we bumb into anything and then we try the right side and check if we hit anything."
homeassistant,fd63zpf,t1_fd62hr7,1578185213.0,"If the official app can send commands to it, it must have at least one writable characteristic, right?

Inspect all unknown characteristics and be careful you don't open the same ones twice and overlook others. The long UUID's can be intimidating. Writable characteristics have an arrow pointing up next to them. How many can you find? Any characteristics both read- and writable? What does it read when you press the down arrow?"
homeassistant,fd61pem,t3_ek47k2,1578184313.0,"Download 'nRF Connect for Mobile'. It's a generic BLE debugging tool. You can use it to discover the services and characteristics of the BLE device and directly test sending commands to see if it works. With a bit of thinking, trying and testing, you can sometimes work out how the device works and what commands to send. 

The app will indicate which characteristics are writable, which means you can send commands to it. Others are only readable, such as fetching the firmware version number. 

If, for example, you can read a writeable characteristic and it returns 0x00 while the kettle is off, it makes sense trying to send 0x01 to see if it turns on. If that doesn't do anything, try the upper limits of a byte and send 0xff and so forth.

If you can set a temperature with the app, look for a writable characteristic which looks like it allows you doing so. If the kettle is turned on but unused, I would expect it to return something close to room temperature. Probably as a byte value, so you have to test some assumptions and conversions before you might learn something interesting. It's good fun."
