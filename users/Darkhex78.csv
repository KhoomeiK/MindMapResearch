ageofsigmar,ff2766k,t1_ff0s4jb,1579495751.0,"Nagash is a better caster than archaon, however I've seen both in combat and I have to say that if archaon can get to Nagash I want to say archaon potentially has him beat. Archaon has several ways to negate/reflect mortal wounds and can negate spells on a 4+. So on a 4+ he can negate Nagash's instant kill. If Archaon gets two 6's with his 4 attacks with the slayer of kings he will also insta-kill Nagash. 

So I'll say it depends on if you can get to Nagash before he can do alot of damage. If you can, Archaon can beat him fairly easily. Even if you don't kill him in the first combat, with how much damage archaon can dish out it shouldn't be too hard to bracket him and make him far less dangerous."

AskReddit,fexbdh0,t3_eqphy8,1579428090.0,"I cannot for the life of me remember the name of the movie. But it's a movie where a group of people are trapped on an island (can't remember why) and one by one are killed off by someone. There was a scene, where one member of the group went to a security room to look over security tapes I think. He's gone for awhile and they go check on him.

The guy is found dead, nails all over his body, and he is strung up as some sort of very twisted marionette using said nails to tie the sting onto and suspend him. Than music starts playing and his corpse begins dancing and the nails begin to tear his skin from the strain. I was only like 7-8 when I watched it, and FUCK ME it was terrifying.

There's another scene where everyone gets drugged and gets knocked out. During the blackout one member of the group is exsangunated in his sleep and decapitated. it isn't found out until someone taps on his head and his bloodless head falls into his lap. This was an EXTREMELY twisted movie and I'd love to know the title of it."
aww,fex9oak,t3_eqt8yp,1579427342.0,"You are INCREDIBLY defensive about these animals being good pets when they aren't, but it's true. Bush babies are exotic animals and should not be kept as pets at all. In some locations it is very illegal to own one and you could be fined or worse. Additionally if anyone buys one they are thwn supporting the exotic animal trade. Again highly illegal. If this guy is a rescue and cannot be reintroduced into the wild than fair enough to the owner for taking him in.

These guys are also nocturnal and shouldn't even be awake during the day..."
