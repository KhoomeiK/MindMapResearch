I have a lot of experience writing and thinking about tales, I've watched countless movies, anime, series that popped a lot of ideas into my head..

Moderating this sub, I could turn it into a big party of people, sharing their tales and stories.. let us share our thoughts and tales!

And who knows, maybe some will get famous xD 

How will we do it? 
We can use bots that will post places and backgrounds, users would could come up with tales using those two functions, then post them. That way, everyone can share their minds creations.




It's an amazing opportunity and I'd love to get your support!! <3"

Israel is not to blame in the situation.

The Arab countries were the ones starting the wars, and the ones refusing our proposal for the two state solution.

And it's ironic since they also don't accept the Palestinian refugees.

So until the Arabs get their mind set straight, the status quo is fine.

Would you mind if I ask you, what is your solution?"
