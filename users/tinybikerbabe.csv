bipolar,ffa0ub3,t1_ffa0o1d,1579725610.0,I do but I can‚Äôt do that for a few reasons plus I‚Äôm not at risk of harming myself. I‚Äôve felt like this since I got diagnosed in sept (knew for like 15 years I had bipolar just didn‚Äôt want to be medicated)
bipolar,ffa00wc,t1_ff9y9ep,1579725131.0,Iowa.
bipolar,ff9x8u0,t1_ff9w48d,1579723488.0,Well shit. That explains a ton. Got an appointment made today...12 weeks from now was the earliest....because I thought they missed a diagnosis or two because I‚Äôm all over the place.
bipolar,ff9vtln,t3_esgxil,1579722611.0,Oh is the one of the left a blank thing or what is it?!
bipolar,ff9vrbv,t1_ff9tqsg,1579722571.0,Right but I‚Äôm like legit serious also? I‚Äôm medicated should I still be a hot mess?! I mean I‚Äôm hot but the mess part is what concerns me.
bipolar,ff9t1dm,t1_ff9s9zj,1579720628.0,Gosh this is me daily even on meds....is that not normal?!
bipolar,ff9rukq,t3_esg282,1579719791.0,It‚Äôs no different then somebody with any illness! You are still worthy of living and having a great life. It‚Äôs just a little harder for us.
bipolar,ff7puiz,t3_es4cbm,1579655437.0,Sorry....maybe go for a walk (super not being serious making fun of the dr who thinks that‚Äôs a cure all) I hope you can get some relief
bipolar,ff7lkdo,t3_es35k8,1579652443.0,I need to figure out what‚Äôs feeding my demons.
bipolar,ff7l84g,t3_es3m87,1579652206.0,Same.
bipolar,ff7axah,t1_ff7a6yc,1579645021.0,The thing about deleting it completely is it‚Äôs not in the back of your head to want to check and see what‚Äôs up because that‚Äôs just a log in away. No going back after it‚Äôs totally gone.
bipolar,ff74jlg,t3_es0lqr,1579640979.0,Best thing I‚Äôve ever done was completely delete my Facebook and Snapchat accounts. Helped my brain more then I thought it would.
bipolar,ff74bzt,t3_es0qfp,1579640857.0,I‚Äôm sorry. I wish I could make it stop for you. Find a ‚Äúhappy‚Äù spot in your brain if you can
bipolar,ff685iw,t1_ff66u3d,1579621398.0,I want meds that give me the irresistible urge to eat. Seriously though.
bipolar,ff681nt,t1_ff62m76,1579621329.0,I see what you did there.
bipolar,ff5bfij,t3_erqb8q,1579586152.0,I‚Äôve been told one way to see if you are going into a mania is if you are trying to fix all of your life and your life problems...at once. Not sure if it‚Äôs actually true
bipolar,ff57b8l,t1_ff4n1dv,1579582317.0,I always rapid cycle but f me not like that.
bipolar,ff5789h,t1_ff4v7p2,1579582245.0,Sooo I just went outside to take that garbage to the curb...I love where the air hurts your face....massive piles of snow in my yard. I shit you not I stared at the snow like I‚Äôd never seen it before. Was super confused. Started to realize what it was but still found it strange about how it could be so cold we have just piles of it.
bodymods,ff55e33,t1_ff52651,1579580712.0,Don‚Äôt tell me that!! I usually heal great but I guess when your nipples are thicker they take longer.
bipolar,ff4v2yw,t1_ff4uphj,1579573145.0,Wow thanks I‚Äôm going to read this again when my brain works but what I did pick up was great. My mom would tell you I‚Äôm incredibly talented because I am so good at all the things crafty.  Interesting. Thanks
bipolar,ff4obpq,t3_ermw4i,1579568490.0,I love it!!! Very pretty.
bipolar,ff4oaew,t3_ermwbt,1579568465.0,I feel you there ( got super fucked up and woke up with 2 people in my bed and a hangover but I do this shit when depressed)  Do you have any hobbies at all? Anything else you can put the energy and focus on? Not sure where you live but is it nice out there? Go for a long walk and try to get yourself ground with nature? My depression is the one that scares me the most.
somethingimade,ff4jijg,t3_erm5h6,1579565118.0,So much crochet! üòç
somethingimade,ff4ia9t,t1_ff45fru,1579564276.0,Aliens don‚Äôt.
bipolar,ff4i5mr,t3_erlxsd,1579564188.0,Yes that‚Äôs why when I‚Äôm in the middle for moods I write out unrealistic and realistic expectations for my life. So I can keep myself a little centered.

bipolar,ff20qxk,t3_er6sk4,1579490724.0,Oh man I buy all he things when depressed. Bought a 29k motorcycle once. Every month I‚Äôm reminded of that decision.
bipolar,ff20a3o,t1_ff1upbl,1579490385.0,What could it lead to? Everybody‚Äôs bipolar is totally different. Mindfulness actually helps me be more aware when my mood is starting to change so I can adjust things to what would benefit me best for them...with that said the swings are bad now and they don‚Äôt affect my life as much since I‚Äôve been on my meds.
bipolar,ff1udrg,t1_ff1po1k,1579486397.0,Thinking clearly?
bipolar,ff1nx5n,t3_eqm860,1579482324.0,Love it
bipolar,ff1nrei,t1_ff0x9tk,1579482243.0,Pinterest is my best friend for things you can put in there. I need to add it to mine but a gratitude spread is great because it makes you see the good side when down. I also like to write out my unrealistic expectations and then counter them with realistic ones so I can make sure I‚Äôm thinking clearly.
bipolar,ff0wdw9,t3_er3fl0,1579472901.0,Love bullet journaling. Lots of things you can do for mental health and mindfulness
weightgain,fez8ycb,t3_eqyu7q,1579454953.0,I do it myself. It‚Äôs easiest to get massive amount of calories by drinking them. I also add a bunch of weird things to those shakes for more calories and fat and what not
bipolar,fewna6q,t3_eqrqtu,1579415544.0,What‚Äôs my problem?
Converse,fev5dre,t3_eqo7fd,1579393304.0,I can‚Äôt do it!! Don‚Äôt scuff the chucks
bodymods,feu5j9u,t3_eq5pxj,1579383342.0,1.5 years in and mine still aren‚Äôt fully healed because of how thick my nipples are. Good luck

Mindfulness. Positive thinking when I think negatively. My bf who‚Äôs a massive support. Journaling. Meditation. Goal setting."
bipolar,fely2jb,t1_felwmf3,1579233856.0,Yea I‚Äôm asked all the time if it hurt...Yea bad mental health will do that to you. Or it super fucking hurt but not worse then how depressed I was.
bipolar,felk60v,t3_epsz9i,1579224127.0,Yea actually it can be fast cycling and my psychiatrist was in total agreement by things that I told her. And why would people want to pretend they have this!? It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a badge to wear and be proud of since mental health already has a stigma to it so yea let‚Äôs go around making up you have bipolar which has even more stigma to it. Get off your high horse and just be empathetic to others. No two peoples story and symptoms are going to be the same.
bipolar,felik4p,t3_epsszm,1579223020.0,That‚Äôs great!!! I hope that medicine helps you. And that‚Äôs great about getting a support group!
bipolar,felhl8i,t1_felhe0a,1579222354.0,Stupid anxiety. I weigh 106 at my highest weight. When I‚Äôm in a super anxious stressful point I will drop 16 pounds in less then a month....yet my dr gave me Wellbutrin which is an appetite suppressant
bipolar,felggd7,t3_epsjim,1579221597.0,80% of people have a magnesium deficiency. It can do some pretty great things to your body when you have enough magnesium in your body. It helps relieve my anxiety a little...not a ton that it goes away but enough were I can eat a little
bipolar,felezxv,t3_eps8de,1579220617.0,I already have a high sex drive and mania makes it 10 times worse. I have stories I could tell that might make you feel normal if its super high while up.
bipolar,felb8wj,t3_epqynm,1579218124.0,Love it!
somethingimade,fel2uye,t3_epqcmv,1579212865.0,I love it!
bipolar,fel2tt5,t3_epqg6z,1579212845.0,I was offered an accommodation when my regional manager (ugh retail life) found out. I denied it...but for us it‚Äôs we can call in if we need to without it being considered an absence from work. Nothing really besides that I don‚Äôt think from my understanding.
AskReddit,fel1t0h,t1_fek6or4,1579212211.0,Money?! Good sex?!
AskReddit,fel1r8u,t1_fek1vio,1579212181.0,Don‚Äôt go big and expensive. It‚Äôs just a piece of metal and stone. It doesn‚Äôt make a good marriage and it‚Äôs over-rated. ( was married and had over 2 karats of diamonds my marriage was shit)

AskReddit,fel0533,t3_epm34w,1579211221.0,If we get to include what‚Äôs already available in my home it‚Äôs gonna be fettuccine chicken Alfredo. There‚Äôs nothing better then homemade Alfredo sauce.
bipolar,fekzh5w,t3_eppyn8,1579210825.0,Don‚Äôt give up. It‚Äôs a hard journey. I‚Äôm a firm believer medication alone will not fix things. Talk therapy. Journaling. Mindfulness. Positive thinking. These are all things I do to feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but I also like that I got diagnosed because now I‚Äôm so much more aware of things that I‚Äôve been able to control my reactions to my mood better and has made my life a bit easier. Don‚Äôt take that as it‚Äôs all rainbows and glitter it still sucks to have this just a little bit less.
bipolar,fekz49i,t3_eppz4n,1579210609.0,"I don‚Äôt art as in paint or draw or anything like that but I‚Äôve taken up many hobbies over the years as a creative outlet (sewing, knitting, crocheting, embroidery..you get the idea. I did it to have a place to put all the energy when I was up and as a way to keep me from sinking when down. At one point I just got so down I lost all interest and years later it‚Äôs not come back. 
It was a coping mechanism for sure."
bipolar,fekxvux,t3_eppnvv,1579209869.0,When I went in for depression all I told him was simply it‚Äôs strange because I‚Äôll be incredibly depressed and want to die and then the next day I‚Äôm on top of the world.  Just bring it up when you go. It would be worth it to get the meds you need.
bipolar,fekx006,t1_fekwdtz,1579209343.0,Oh man the reminds me of the month I spent on Colorado for work in July of 2018 and was super up I left Colorado with 3 new tattoos...yeah this list goes on and on and on since then. On my money.
bipolar,fekwlhe,t1_fekw6bx,1579209105.0,There is that.

bipolar,fekoj2e,t3_epoic0,1579204341.0,"Oh it‚Äôs so ugly it‚Äôs adorable!

bipolar,fejwh8y,t3_epkfo3,1579187440.0,Oh I rapid cycle so fast it‚Äôs both in one day often. It‚Äôs exhausting. I‚Äôve had days where it was one for a few hours then I‚Äôd crash for a few hours only to go back up and I did that for days in a row. Not fun
shittysuperpowers,fejvbp9,t1_fejv0v1,1579186689.0,"Yep ditto. It might not be the same but I work in retail and I‚Äôm constantly moving and having to stretch and kneel. My hip to thigh was the worst as far as working goes.

Want a easy tattoo to heal without much work at all...get a head tattoo. Heals within days"
shittysuperpowers,fejuct2,t1_fejtra4,1579186047.0,"Yikes they got dried out. Next time thin layer of whatever you use to heal, then a bit of plastic wrap so they don‚Äôt rub against whatever you are wearing. Learned that fast with a hip to thigh tattoo and needing to be able to work."

weightgain,fdvx0wy,t3_en7w50,1578752657.0,I have even touched a weight since my journey. I put muscle on way to easily. Upped my calories to over 3k a day. Tons of carbs and tons of fat. I‚Äôve even made drinks with over 1000 calorie that I found on the net.  If I have a protein shake or have a coffee or even cereal and oatmeal I put heavy cream in it. Just what I‚Äôve done to put actual fat on me and not muscle
bipolar,fdstcrk,t3_emxsmy,1578707681.0,I cycle very fast. It‚Äôs awful and I hate it.
bipolar,fdssnvw,t3_emwx6n,1578707430.0,Same. Piercings stopped hurting so I moved to tattoos. Last time I was fast cycling (before diagnosis and meds) I got my head tattooed. It was then I decided I really needed help with my mental health.
bipolar,fdsrksn,t1_fdseay1,1578707028.0,I‚Äôm so sorry to hear. ü•∫
bipolar,fdsrarr,t3_emzeja,1578706926.0,My ex husband was not supportive at all. My first serious boyfriend after him has undiagnosed bipolar and we fed off each other to much. My current boyfriend is incredibly supportive and it‚Äôs made this the best relationship I‚Äôve been in.
AskReddit,fdn66av,t1_fdm9v2y,1578578374.0,My ex husband did this when we were married. Everybody in bed at 9pm...even his wife who hated it. There‚Äôs a reason he‚Äôs my EX husband.
