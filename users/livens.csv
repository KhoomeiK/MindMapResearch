NoStupidQuestions,ff860le,t1_ff7qww7,1579666963.0,"I know why... When I watch TV or movies I get really into them. My brain shuts down and I just become immersed in that universe. The better the show the less chatter in my head, the less outside distractions pull me out of it. As a consequence I don't remember alot of details, especially names. It took until the last ep of Witcher to remember the handsome fighty dude was Geralt. Yennifer was easier because it was odd.

Meanwhile the girls at work not only know every characters name, but the actors names too. They also catch alot of the little hints that can predict what's going to happen next... That all goes right over my head."

They may have assumed that all of the force would be directed straight down. But wine bottles are generally stored tipped down towards the cork a bit. Once it was completely filled the slight imbalance in weight was enough to tip it over.

Pretty bland taste by themselves, they really need a sauce on them.

Her house had a walkout basement with a shower down there. She would hint to me to stop by a certain window at 8:00 or whatever. That window happened to look straight in to the bathroom down a short hallway. So after her shower she would leave the door open while she dried off and lotioned up while I watched from outside.
