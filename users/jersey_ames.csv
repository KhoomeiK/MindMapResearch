CrimeJunkiePodcast,ff6xqd5,t3_eryxac,1579637051.0,I don‚Äôt understand why people continually gripe about this. Just fast forward the 30 seconds. And someone was asking why it always happens right before something big is going to be shared. Umm it‚Äôs the same for TV shows. It‚Äôs called building suspense.
women,ff63a9m,t3_erup3a,1579618057.0,"I don‚Äôt see it as harassment. Sure it was a jerk off thing to say to try and get business, however, to have that print off each time on a receipt seems a bit much. If he had called you names or something like that, that‚Äôd be different."

AskWomenOver30,fetdya6,t3_eqgpal,1579374389.0,"I‚Äôm also 38 with three children. I‚Äôve been a stay at home mom since my oldest (13) was born. I just registered for community college!! I‚Äôm really scared as it‚Äôs been SO long since I‚Äôve been in school. My adult life was marriage, children, a horrible divorce, remarriage, and my last child who is on the spectrum. 

Trying to face a fear and focus on me and make some dreams come true!"
CrimeScene,fecjmhf,t1_fecd6qj,1578975513.0,I don‚Äôt really know what was going on personally in her life or with her extended family. I‚Äôm definitely going to follow the case to see what evidence brought on the arrests. I‚Äôm guessing drugs and possibly an affair.

CrimeScene,febpji5,t3_eo8loo,1578961306.0,"I just found out yesterday (stay with me because it gets confusing) that my cousins ex gf‚Äôs (they were together for around 10 years and is still considered family) husband was arrested on charges on a cold case from 25 years ago! He, his mother, and a friend are charged with murdering the aunt and father. I even talked with my cousins ex on FB messenger a little just reaching out.

news,febjffb,t1_feajcvz,1578959422.0,"I‚Äôm in agreement. This was such an interesting case as I don‚Äôt believe there had been anything like it. Thing is, everyone wants someone to blame. I understand the parents were obviously in extreme pain over the loss of their son. He had been contemplating this for awhile; why didn‚Äôt they get him help? Did they have access to all the videos he was posting and if so again, why didn‚Äôt they get him help? If he had done it without her involvement would the parents blame someone else; themselves perhaps?"

I completely agree. She was also mentally ill and needed help. They were a bad mix together and something was bound to happen to one or both of them."
CrimeJunkiePodcast,fe9aroc,t1_fe98i7n,1578935947.0,It‚Äôs so rude.
Dallas,fe6gz3u,t1_fe68mco,1578890598.0,I totally get that. A lot of places are super fun when you‚Äôre on vacation but it‚Äôs always different when you live there.
Dallas,fe67xom,t3_enurwe,1578883770.0,"I‚Äôm the opposite, I want out of Dallas! I think CO is very beautiful and there is much to do in summer and winter since it‚Äôs not sweltering hot and winter sports if you like it. I‚Äôm not a fan of freezing cold either but excessive heat sucks too, and you basically have to either be inside or a pool. There is no topography and the influx of people during the last four years is crazy!"
newjersey,fe64wbx,t3_engp70,1578881851.0,"This is so damn crazy!! I‚Äôm from NJ and lived there the majority of my life. I had not heard of this case while there and I didn‚Äôt live far from Long Branch. 

My cousin dated Ted Connors wife for many years and she is still considered part of our family. I have NEVER been so close to a crime like this. I am also big time into true crime cases so this is just nuts!"

TrueCrimePodcasts,fco5t8o,t3_ei6haw,1577824631.0,"I feel similarly. It was the first true crime podcast I listened to. All the chattering for 20+ minutes got kinda old. I liked the cute little phrases that they would come up with and so many people loved it and I also wanted to be a part of that. I then randomly started to try other podcasts (still true crime) and it was refreshing to hear a full story that was researched in around 40ish minutes vs MFM where they just rambled about random stuff, each gave a 10‚Äì15 minute story that may or may not be correct. To me it‚Äôs less about true crime and more just two friends bs-ing about their lives."
