tonightsdinner,ff6ky1g,t3_erneo2,1579629412.0,"Slow-Roasted Beef with Leeks
By Donna Hay
Serves 6–8

* 4 leeks, trimmed and halved lengthways
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 x 1.6kg (3 ½ pounds) beef sirloin roast
* 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, extra
* 400 ml (13 ½ ounces) beef stock
* Sea salt and cracked black pepper
* 2 tablespoons chopped tarragon
* 2 tablespoons thyme leaves

Preheat oven to 100°C (212°F). Cover the leeks with boiling water and allow to stand for 5 minutes. Drain and pat dry. 

Place the leeks in the base of a baking tray, drizzle with the oil, and pour over the beef stock. 

Brush the beef with extra oil and generously sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat and cook the beef for 3 minutes each side or until just browned. Place the beef on top of the leeks and sprinkle with the tarragon and thyme leaves. Roast for 2 hours or until the leeks are tender and the beef is cooked to medium-rare. Remove the beef from pan, cover and keep warm.

Increase the oven temperature to 220°C (425°F) and cook the leeks for a further 10–15 minutes or until golden. Thinly slice the beef and serve with the leeks and pan juices."

Cooking,fefe6sd,t1_fef9nxm,1579054414.0,"1. She gets her mother significantly more than two hours a day four days a week. 

2. My husband is finishing his PhD so I am the primary breadwinner. 

3. Even if we could afford it, I wouldn’t want to be home with her 24/7. I would be at my wit’s end and we would both be far less happy. 

4. Please explain to me how I am supposed to simultaneously work full time and personally take care of my child all day. Would you ask this of a man who works in an office? “Why are you working? You should be home taking care of your baby! You think your baby is BOTHERING you by being there?” It’s absolutely ludicrous. I do specialized work 40 hours a week and make good money - I just happen to be in my house while I do it. There is no way I could do this and care for my baby at the same time. NO way. Should I be leaving her unattended in a childproofed pen all day while I earn money so that she’s physically at home with me (never mind being ignored) rather than in an interactive and nurturing environment with other children that she loves?"

Daughter is 11mo so family dinner time will probably become the norm over the next few months. At that point I’ll probably become the morning person and my husband will mind her after work/daycare while I cook and then we’ll all eat together. Mayhem, but nice mayhem. ☺️"

Cooking,feetbsr,t1_feermia,1579040768.0,"I shouldn’t have to justify my life choices as a working mother to you, but:

a) She’s at daycare Tuesday through Thursday and at home with me and my parents watching her on Mondays and Fridays, and then of course I’m with her all weekend. 
b) No. She still has no teeth and has to be hand or spoon fed and can’t have heavily-spiced or salted foods. My husband and I like to take our time with dinner and enjoy our meal together without wrangling a barely-toddler at the same time. 
c) Have you ever tried to get any work done while minding a baby? It’s nearly impossible without either seriously compromising your work or the care of your child. In fact I was barely able to type this response out to you just now. 

So thanks for your concern, but we’re balancing things just fine. I’d love to know if you have children, and if so, how you schedule your days!"
