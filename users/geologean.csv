She was just an underwhelming candidate who did not communicate a real vision of how the future would be better than the past.

That position does **nothing** to excite and rebuild the middle class that was obliterated during the 2008 Credit Crunch.

On the other side, she's had a 30-year target on her back, ever since she was the face of Universal Health Care in the 1990s. She underwhelmed progressives and was demonized endlessly by conservative media. Hilary Clinton was specially poised to lose in 2016.

They might give Naomi Novik a shot. There's something very poignant about her writing. Uprooted does have a sex scene, so maybe wait a bit for that one, but Spinning Silver is a *beautiful* book. The prose, the character growth, the very loose inspiration from Rumplestiltskin, all come together to make a story that feels familiar and surprising at the same time.

Cathryn M. Valente also has gorgeous prose. Her fantasy has a sinister tinge to it, but it's just so beautiful that it's practically like reading poetry. I've only read a few of her books, but her Fairyland series is meant for Juveniles, and should be safe for a 13-year old.

It might be a little juvenile for your reader if they're already devouring Cosmere books, but try introducing them to some Patricia C. Wrede books. The Enchanted Forest Chronicles is a juvenile series that pokes fun at a lot of fantasy tropes while simultaneously embracing them. She has other books for older readers as well. Some of the stories from her short story anthology, The Book of Enchantments still haunt me as an adult.

The Ring of Solomon is also a pretty good book for Young Adults. I enjoyed it, but haven't read the rest of the series. The main character is a demon named Bartimeus, who is exceedingly lazy.

Stormlight_Archive,fdq2dbv,t3_emld83,1578651464.0,"Making an enemy completely frictionless would actually be a huge advantage in a fight. They would fall and be unable to get purchase on anything. Alternatively, giving someone infinite friction can root them to the ground, or possibly even set them on fire as the air rubs roughly against every square millimeter of their surface area (a la meteors passing through the atmosphere). I don't think we'll see the latter, but I can see Lift making a bunch of voidbringers slip and fall while she nabs their field rations.

Lift has only sworn the third ideal. There are going to be 10 books. You can be sure that Sanderson will come up with really creative uses for the surges. Hell, in the very first Interlude, Szeth uses gravitation to hurl objects at an opponent and to break a balcony by increasing it's own gravitational attraction to the ground.

Also, think of a perfectly frictionless shard blade unable to be brought to a complete stop by another shard, half-shard, or Last Clap. Now imagine that in the hands of an Edgedancer who can skate up walls and then root themselves to the ceiling as needed, or one who can control friction enough that enemies can only graze them. Then throw in accelerated healing, even faster than other surgebinders. And if you're facing multiple surgebinders, the Edgedancer can heal the ones you've wounded or incapacitated. 

Edgedancers sound fucking amazing. I imagine them skating across battlefields and weaving in between voidbringers while cutting them down effortlessly. Lift in particular will be very potent, with her ability to metabolize food into stormlight. One of the pre-chapter excerpts of Words of Radiance even mentions how a ruler of one of the ancient silver kingdoms practically crapped himself when he was told that the Edgedancers were coming for him.

I personally think that Truthwatchers have the least compatible surges: Illumination and Progression. But Dalinar's Tension surge is not the same as a Stoneward's according to the Stormfather, so maybe Illumination works differently for Truthwatchers than it does for Lightweavers? I hope that's the case, because I like Renarin and don't want him to feel less useful than other Orders of Radiant. He's already had plenty of being overshadowed by everyone else in House Kholin."

Both Jillian and Bob frequently chided contestants for their Game decisions because it really was a distraction from the bigger prize of a full life without obesity.

The show was more focused on the Game than it was on actual sustainable weight loss. It was a reality show first, and did extremely little to teach people how they could lose weight at home. It perpetuated the myth that you needed to go away to a luxury ranch in California to lose a large amount of weight. It perpetuated a lot of fatlogic with their promos of ""easy healthy brand snack food no. 59"" instead of teaching people that they should forgo snacks if they're serious about weight loss and especially if they're morbidly obese and need to lose weight quickly before they experience serious health problems.

The Biggest Loser wasn't garbage because of the training regimens. There's no way to tell how contestants were actually training from the show because so little screen time was dedicated to diet or exercise. It was garbage because it was a game show that wanted to get credit for fighting the obesity epidemic, but did nothing to educate people on the danger of obesity or how to lose weight at home."

If they take away your computer, but you continue to be plugged in, then they'll need to come for your phone next. 

If you actually do need to get healthier, then your parents are right, and you need to spend some time away from screens and do something physical with your time. Maybe start lifting if your school has a weight room? It's really easy to end up overweight or obese now by being inactive and overeating. It's better to avoid that, and if you're already heavy then you need to get active and in control of your diet now while you are young. It is *really hard* to change your diet and exercise habits as an adult.

Take this as an opportunity. There will be *a lot of time* as a working adult where you will not be able to avoid screens and screentime.
