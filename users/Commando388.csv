Minimalist art is by nature very simple and sterile, but that doesn’t automatically make it less valuable than a detailed oil painting. The art is often in the presentation, context, and the feelings it evokes, not just the object itself. Does minimalist art like that make you angry when you look at it? If so, why is that? Art doesn’t always have to evoke joy or serenity.

I realize I probably sound like an English teacher here, but I’m just trying to help you see it the way I do. You don’t have to agree with me, but then again, that’s what makes art so interesting."

lotr,feplm7e,t1_feoy1uq,1579323730.0,"I understand PJ adding some complexity into Faramir, and I even think the change was almost necessary given the medium. 

In books it’s easy to show a character’s motivations without using dialogue because you have access to their thoughts, but in movies it’s different. Given how from a filmmaking perspective we have been shown that hobbits are the only ones able to withstand the ring for long periods of time and that even Gandalf is susceptible to its power, it would be weird to suddenly introduce a Man who is unbothered by its temptations. The closest we come to that is Aragorn, and even he feels the draw in Fellowship.

I like how they portrayed Faramir as a better person than Boromir, who fell to temptation, while still eventually coming to his senses and letting Frodo go, something that few Men outside of Aragorn have the willpower to do. It shows that he’s still a good man without creating an inconsistency in the movies.

I realize that the explanation as to why he isn’t tempted in the books Is a perfectly good one, but given that the movies don’t have the advantages the book does in being able to develop characters in more depth I think Jackson’s decision was a sound one."
