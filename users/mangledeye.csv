educationalgifs,fe38k28,t1_fe2bjk2,1578846958.0,"Conservation of angular momentum. 
You know when ice skaters spin sometimes they pull their arms together and that makes them spin faster?
Same thing with everything else. Now imagine a cloud of gas that maybe rotates once in a million years, but it is slowly coalescing into a blob, and eventually that collapses into a star conserving the same spin, except the blob is much smaller and thus it's spin becomes faster as the star forms, ""bringing it's arms(stuff) together"".
Now that we have a super massive star formed it's spinning much faster, since all that area has become smaller, conserving the momentum.
Super massive stars , as they die and explode sometimes can avoid the collapse into black hole if all things are right in their situation. Instead when they form heavy elements in their core they collapse into a neutron star.
Did you know that atoms consist of 99.9% of empty space? We don't fall through ""solid"" objects because of electro magnetism.
When an object has enough mass the gravity (weakest force) finally has enough power to collapse that empty space, and all the matter left within the star after supernovae, collapses (not enough fuel to keep it lit anymore) into a relatively solid neutron. That is what a neutron star is. 
And most of that angular momentum (spin) remains, except now this star has shrunk from the size of Mars' orbit to the size of Manhattan.
Hope this makes sense to you."
