Long story short, my grandmother died in 2011 and one of my biggest regret was how I wasn't there at the end of her life (I was a college student then). I had the dream 7 years later, in 2018. For some reasons, we unburied her and realized she wasn't dead. So she came back home to live with my parents and my siblings. I don't remember the rest.

&#x200B;

**Team 1 : Double Waver team, RNG involved**.

* Lancelot + Khaleido
* Nero caster + Holy Night Supper
* Waver + Waver

Fairly straightforward : use Lancelot NP in both wave. Last wave, you need a Burst/crit from Nero or brave chain.

&#x200B;

**Team 2 : Less RNG involved. I think it's possible to improve this build by using a Plugsuit and a second Merlin or  Shakespeare.**

* Lancelot + Khaleido
* Arash + MLB imaginary
* Nero caster + Holy Night Supper
* Merlin

Kill Arash wave 1. Wave 2, use Merlin 20% NP charge and cast illusion to generate more stars. You should have 45-50+ stars. Wave 3 requires a burst card from Nero OR Lancelot. Use Merlin Burst buff on the correct servant.

I think this team has room for improvement. I stopped using it because Lancelot and Arash are now bond 10.

&#x200B;

**Team 3 : Double Merlin team. Still a little bit of RNG involved.**

* Nitocris + Khaleido
* Nero caster + Holy Night Supper
* 2x Merlin + plug suit

Fairly easy to use. Wave 3 requires a little bit of RNG : 1 burst card from Nero, or a regular card from Nero + burst card from Merlin. I think 2 merlin cards can sometimes clear it if one of them is red. My HNS is almost lvl 100."
