He was old school Jewish, not *quite* full-on Orthodox, but pretty old school. I was raised Reform, which means we didn't tend to worry much about things like keeping kosher.

The night before my Bar Mitzvah we went out for dinner, and I got some fried shrimp - which my granddad commented about them not being kosher, but wasn't being super serious about it. Come the end of the meal I have some left over, and he reaches over and grabs one and starts eating it. I ask him about what he said earlier, and he just shrugged and said he said a blessing over them so they're okay now.

He was a fairly quiet and serious man, but that was one of the times I remember him being that relaxed and humorous."

If we're talking comics, I fucking *loved* the ""Post-Crisis Superman in New 52"" era of the book - the one from Convergence, Lois and Clark, and the Rebirth books before Superman Reborn (and even after that, before fuckin' Bendis). I loved him being not just the Last Son of Krypton, but the Last Son of the Multiverse along with Lois and Jon, balancing his heroism with the needs of his family, as well as their existence from another timeline. It was one of the most fascinating and interesting runs for the character, and I really wish they hadn't retconned him into the timeline so quickly... or at least had done it better.

It can be hard, especially if you're in the younger block and have only really been politically aware the last few years, to see the whole thing as pointless - even when you win, it takes one asshole from Kentucky to stop everything.

They thing just getting Trump out of the office is going to be ""enough,"" rather than wanting to change things so that Trump can never happen again - because doing that admits that the system itself is broken, which challenges a lifetime of familiarity with how it works.

Right now the only other planned animation for the game is two movies adapting the Camelot singularity, which takes place immediately before Bablyonia.

The movie and anime were made due to a poll of Japanese users asking what Singularities they'd want to see adapted and how they'd want them adapted.

That second part is the big reason you're seeing more of it. As YouTube's demonetization model becomes more and more uncertain for mid-grade producers (Adpocalypse, the COPPA fiasco, overly zealous copyright trolls), they need some guaranteed level of stable income - and one way to avoid being entirely reliant on YouTube's monetization is to get the video sponsored, which guarantees a minimum certain return on the video, regardless of views.

Companies like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Blue Apron, SquareSpace, Skill Share, and plenty others are taking advantage of this by offering sponsorship for videos in exchange for some kind of ad for their product, and Raid Shadow Legends has been one of the most prominent - helped because the audience for a gaming focused channel would probably respond better to a game related ad than something like Blue Apron or Skill Share."

The Kara No Kyoukai movies in particular are kinda ambiguous, since their existence doesn't really contradict any sort of stuff in the Fate series, so they're more vague on if they can appear in our universe. Some stuff like the Fate/Zero events or the Prisma Illya event have explicit Singularities being created based on parallel worlds. It's still primarily Fate universe stuff - besides KnK, it's all Fate stuff, we haven't seen anything with Arcueid or Ciel for example."

This is a totally separate timeline from the other Fate material - this isn't taking place ""after"" Fate/Stay Night or anything like that, it's an entirely separate and unique timeline/story.

AskReddit,ff2oc0o,t3_er3a4t,1579516155.0,"It's not the major or explosive thing some other people have posted, but I just got kinda lost imagining how the mindset of this person was.

We were going into the grocery store, and this woman walked in through the Exit door, nearly running into a few people. The other person with her said something to the effect of ""Hey, I think that was the out door."" And her response was ""Well, it's not in my line of site so I shouldn't be expected to follow it.""

So this woman acknowledged she was wrong, and quite possibly *did* see the sign, but decided that she didn't need to follow it because she wasn't in her immediate line of sight, and she could just outright ignore it."

The full story is pretty spoiler heavy, and hasn't actually been explained in the NA server of the game yet. But this *is* the first we've seen of him in the game during the Lostbelt prologue stuff, you're not missing anything on why he's there yet."
fatestaynight,ff2mt3k,t1_ff2mcec,1579513793.0,"Depending on things like your availability, reading speed, servant strength, etc, it can sometimes take a little while. Assuming that I don't have any major issues with the battles, I can usually clear a story in a couple of days, maybe a week tops, with some time set aside to play it. 

The first few are a bit shorter and Septem in particular is kind of a low point writing wise, but America and then Camelot/Bablyonia are top tier levels of writing and should be read in their entirety for sure - even if you've watched Babylonia, it's worth reading and experiencing the full story, as they did cut out a lot of nice, if non-essential, scenes for the characters."

Both having seen a sort of warning of where his ideals might lead him, as well as having Rin's support, likely mean that he won't fall to the same problems as Archer did, and will hopefully be able to move ""beyond"" the point where Archer faltered, finding a way to balance his ideals with the reality of the world around him."
fatestaynight,ff2mfa3,t3_eqxgi5,1579513195.0,"The good news is if you can get through the first half of 2wei Hertz or so, it picks up after the fifth or sixth episode - the first few seasons kinda all have the pattern of the first half-ish of the season being full of the cutesy slice of live ecchi stuff, and then they realized at some point they only have four episodes left and need a plot.

Fortunately, 3rei forgoes this and is full on Fate awesomeness from start to finish. And Oath Under Snow is Heavens Feel levels of good."
fatestaynight,ff2mc8q,t3_er0x8m,1579513062.0,"Imagine that the whole story of a heroic spirit is a beam of light. Rather than summoning that entire light, we're instead filtering it through a prism, and selecting one ""color"" of the light to focus on at any point in time. Some servants will break into more defined colors while others will only split into a few, depending on what you can use to summon them. The catalyst used to summon them effects which ""color"" you'd focus on, and some are harder to focus on than others.

Coming from a more theoretical standpoint, there are differing views and legends about heroes, and more focused attention given to their different points in their lives. We are always changing and becoming new versions of ourselves, and there are often points in our lives where we would consider ourselves a ""different person"" from who we are now. The same is true for the heroic spirits, where we can see differing points in a hero's story as different enough that they can be focused on and summoned.

For example, Gilgamesh *before* his journey and Gilgamesh *after* his journey are two distinct focuses of attention - one the heroic tyrant, the other the wiser, more solid king.

Medusa's three flavors are three different aspects of her life - one as the young goddess living with her sisters before her punishment from Athena, one representing the tragic heroine who was treated as a monster but was still considered someone to be pitied (often representing a more feminist bent on the legend), and one representing the full legend of her as the monster that needed slaying by the Hero.

Alternatively, even if they're not different times in their lives, different classes can focus on different aspects of a hero's story. Cu, for example, can be summoned from his historical prowess as a spear-user, or from his reputation as a powerful user of rune magic. The different classes amplify and focus on those different aspects."
