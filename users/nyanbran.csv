Mentally there's a lot of built up regret, resentment and anger that's always gonna linger. Mostly about the lost years and youth which is something you never get back no matter what you do. With other things you can work harder to catch up or luck out somewhere along the way but you can't get time back. If he's anything like me the more he tolerates having his freedom taken away the more these feelings inside are gonna build up and the sooner he starts loving himself and finds a way to get away the better cause one day those feelings are gonna hit and it won't matter if he has his life sorted at that point."

He has to break away from them the first chance he has or they're going to completely ruin him. Fuck ""family is family"", this is like excusing horrible behavior with ""boys will be boys"". In my eyes they are abusive and he'll be better off away from them."
catcare,fewtclz,t3_eqqa2f,1579419192.0,"You have to get her fixed. If you can't pay see if there are any other options around you, like an NGO or TNR or look for a new home since your parents don't seem to be good pet owners. And don't do that with the cage. It is horribly stressful for the cat and she probably thinks you're punishing her and doesn't trust you anymore that's why she's aggressive. One of my cats was so stressed that I brought her to be fixed that she lost trust in me, it's been more than a year and she still can't forgive me and probably has horrible flashbacks cause she pees herself out of fear if I put her in the cage that I use for vet visits. Cats aren't stupid, they just express themselves differently. Cat memory is many times stronger than a dog's."

Guildwars2,fefyjov,t3_eot6jr,1579069569.0,Yes what I really miss is the unique item drops from bosses in the classic mmorpgs. Even gw1 had these kind of mobs that drop greens and we would have double / triple green drop weekends and everyone would farm the mobs like crazy. It was so fun. I also remember farming fiery / icy blade axe. Solo farming was one of the most fun things in gw2.

AskReddit,fdu1oxh,t3_emuqkb,1578725941.0,"I've had many but the one I want done on a massive scale is for all building rooftops no matter what kind (office, house, store, ect.) to be made flat (if not already) and turned into mini gardens / forests with trees that don't grow too big ect. Reasons are mostly ecological - more green on the places you cleared in order to have the building, regulation or heat - think about it those bare rooftops are the gates to hell in the summer, it's going to be huge for birds in the city - they will have proper living space, cleaner and fresher air with all the added green ect. Economically it would open a lot of maintenance positions for the rooftops."

Like Americans, people always say they're on the stupid side and I replied there's nothing wrong with not knowing where my country is on the map as long as they have a good heart. Then they elected Trump. I thought brits were level headed and educated then they emotionally chose brexit based on hate. Australia I used to read how much they care about their nature. So much that they allow extermination of feral cats and would arrest you at the air port for a fruit. Now they don't care for this devastating tragedy and leave it to insufficient volunteer work. What's next, Canadians cease to be nice and start bombing everybody? On a serious note politically the last few years are pure satire to me."

And I'd like to add something to the list that's typical for people in my country who travel. They always HAVE to wave our national flag every fucking where. Under water while diving, on top of a volcano, in the desert, it's ridiculous. Those places have nothing to do with our country. It's disrespectful. If someone started waving foreign flags at our mountain peaks and caves and beaches all hell would break lose I'm sure of it."

Advice,fdnkasb,t3_em2qcw,1578587585.0,"Why do you think you are stupid? I don't think I'm stupid but people don't reach out to me either. In fact the majority of people are probably stupid. At least in my country all they care about is booze even as adults and I avoid them on purpose cause there's just so much you can tolerate of that and the majority of them get bored or aren't interested in my stargazing for example, they'd rather talk about how they did their nails yesterday or some pety gossip / drama. When I get lonely I like to take the train somewhere. I find it very relaxing and i love the views and exploring the destination when i arrive. I've also had many conversations on trains with random travelers which were fun and sometimes even serious and deep. One thing you can do is find someone who loves to talk so all you'll have to do is listen. They will hang out with you often cause they'll have the chance to talk a lot. Downside is those people don't really care about who they're talking to, they just care about talking and being heard so they won't even allow you to talk or share stuff yourself cause they're all ""me me me"". The other thing is join a circle. Some kind of group activity / classes ect. so you have a pool of people with at least one common interest then you can start from there."

Advice,fdmzfcs,t3_em87i3,1578572378.0,"She probably had different sexual needs from the start plus having a kid is an additional sex drive killer. It's difficult for a woman to have sex if it isn't her thing. I don't think she doesn't care, more like she doesn't enjoy it in general and who wants to do something they don't enjoy. Not sure there's anything you can do, I think you had a kid too fast before you realize that you are not sexually compatible. Sorry. Your needs being met is important but forcing her to do something she doesn't want with guilt or shame isn't good either. She's clearly not into sex as much as you are. Simple as that."

aww,fcl4p6g,t1_fckw4uo,1577739751.0,Ultrasound for pregnant pets can be done to count the babies in early stage of pregnancy. When they get bigger they overlap and it's hard to tell how many are there. Knowing how many babies you are expecting lowers risks during birth (for example if you are expecting 5 but one gets stuck or dies inside the mother you can tell earlier if something is wrong before any fatal outcomes and do emergency operation).

Guildwars2,fcd9ovk,t1_fccauqy,1577607976.0,"Every game declines with time and especially between expansions but when you don't see hope for the future yes that's what's makes it bad. Compared to the personally signed Christmas cards Anet used to send out, a generic NCSOFT card advertising other games is a mockery. I've been with Anet since GW1 and I liked them exactly cause they were not NCSOFT. Things changed with GW2 but Anet still acted as it's own company. Now it doesn't seem to be that either anymore. Meanwhile Aion is getting Aion 2, Lineage is getting a remaster and B&S an engine update I think? Who's to say it isn't also NCSOFT fault not just Anet's for not investing in GW2 anymore. I used to be hyped for new expansion and class specs cause that's what I though was causing the drought. But now I don't think we would be getting one."

catcare,fca8d99,t3_egt06i,1577564615.0,"I think it was a bad decision to vaccinate in all this stressful ping ponging of locations. Cats are VERY sensitive with changes and stress can literally lower his immune system and make them sick. It takes around 10 days to develop the immune response. There's a risk the kitten can get ill from the vaccine now. Did they run a blood test when he was at the vet? Could the kitten be getting into something in the house that could make him vomit. Like plants or toxic substances for cleaning / insects. I personally would get another vet check and have him back with mom for another week. Also did you give him the same food? Feed him whatever he ate before you bought him. Change in food can cause vomiting too.

Edit: I don't know why people feel the need to down vote. I have rescued cats and worked with vets. I've been exclusively told not to carry around and stress a cat too much after I've vaccinated them."
