I don't even know where to start so I will end with this; If we cant discuss the merits of two players without devolving into ""But de coaches know better than you"" then we may close the forum. 

Why are you even here if your only contribution is to tell people that the coaches know and we should all shut up because we don't know enough?

Edit: I have just gone and had a look at your post history and instantly found you evaluating a player's strengths and weaknesses. Fuck outta here ye pup"

Being a lineout option a couple of times a game and jackeling the odd ball is not enough to mitigate some of the work rate issues he has. Ruddock is also a dog at the breakdown, a better carrier, a better tackler and just has all up better numbers. POM is in on previous reputation so let's hope he can find some form."

There was genuinely a moment where the QPR fans were weighing up their morals about kicking fuck out of a little kid and decided against it."
soccer,fegai8e,t1_feg55qc,1579084953.0,"Okay, so Liverpool won a CL 15 years after their last major trophy win. United have also been in and around 2-6th since Ferguson left and their last PL win in 2013. They also have won Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup etc.

We are engaging in a narcissism of small differences scenario here. It's also worth pointing out just how far ahead United are financially than the other teams, which was not the case for Pool during that time. They are pretty much the only team who would not be majorly impacted by the TV deal losing 25-50% of its value. All teams are tied up in the TV rights continuing to be the gravy train that it is now, except for United.

I think that you are being exceptionally kind to Liverpool here and exceptionally negative for United, which is normal because Pool have come through the looking glass and United are still in the middle of the downturn."
soccer,feg48d6,t1_fef1h8f,1579076188.0,"Meh, this feels like wishful thinking from rival fans tbh. Liverpool spent 3 decades with at maximum 3 title challenges, multiple dire managers with boring football, and they still kept attracting fans and making decent money. To give context, it would be the equivalent of United last winning the title in 2013 and not winning it again until 2043. I don't see how people think it will be different for United."
soccer,fe9gv6p,t1_fe97012,1578937446.0,"And then what this leads to is attackers and flashy players over exaggerating contact, milking the ref for yellows arc diving etc. There seems to be some sort of weird dichotomy between the way football fans view kicking fuck out of a flashy player and then that player playing outside the rules by feigning injury and diving.

soccer,fcn3m39,t1_fcmwgs9,1577802338.0,"United have the bones of a good team there too. Massively inconsistent but they can do damage to any team at the moment.

soccer,fcmtp61,t1_fcmf504,1577791774.0,"He has. He still has developing to do but he is a very good all round midfielder right now. Good positioning, strong in the tackle, distributes the ball well, decent shot when he gets a look at goal, good in the air and a leader on the pitch. A bit of a shithouse too so if he continues to develop and stays in the team, expect fume levels to rise about how he plays the game.

facepalm,fc8o57m,t1_fc8n5q7,1577538887.0,"Look, my country isnt without its issues either. The dual option healthcare system needs some TLC and some reform, education is very good so no issue there, but we do have issues with tax haven status for corporations that the people of the country are starting to become bothered by. It is easier to move the needle with a smaller populace, but I would say to you that the starting point is voting for people who seem to put the people first. A country as great as the US can be should not accept that poverty is a life sentence. Everybody benefits when poverty isnt a generational thing and the best way to stop that is by keeping kids healthy and educating the shit out of them. Even from a purely selfish standpoint, a healthier and smarter populace means lower healthcare costs, lower crime rates and thus policing costs, better industry and fewer people needing welfare. Voting in Sanders won't fix it straight away either. But good policy after good policy will incrementally improve things

Oh, I nearly forgot, but the likes of Sanders is against massive wealth hoarding as well. There is  no logic behind Bezos having 100bn in wealth, or the Walmart dudes, and their frontline workforce needing welfare to continue to subsist for their whole lives. That absolutely needs to be looked at and regulated and Sanders has a load of plans for that too! 

I know I sound like a Sanders shill, I really am not. I have no horse in this race other than having a read of their policies and voting histories."
facepalm,fc8km5y,t1_fc8i34r,1577536882.0,"So I will start by saying that I am not from the US, I am Irish. Happy for you to discount my opinion from here. Your starting point with any politician should be: Who is paying for their campaign. It will tell you pretty quickly what their talking points are going to he and what industries or religious groups are going to benefit from them being in charge. Best case scenario, nobody is paying for the campaign except for the voters. This is Sanders and Warren currently, although Warren hasn't always been this.  Logic dictates that somebody that is beholden to the voters will keep their interests at heart. 


What Bernie Sanders advocates is not that everybody gets equal money, everybody gets handed a degree or that everybody is equally intelligent. What he advocates is twofold: some solid safety nets for those who fall on hard times. Have a look at unemployment numbers. When the going is good, people work. You will see unemployment rates under 4%, 1.5% will be transient or between two jobs, and then you will have 1/2% or so that will never work. Even in places like Norway, or Ireland, with strong welfare payouts they see the same thing, people choose work over welfare in overwhelming numbers, so that fear of people becoming welfare Queens and what you have you is more pronounced than it needs to be. For that 1/2% that don't want to work, fuck all you can do about this and you have to write it off as spoilage, but the raw dollar value wont be a whole lot and also, their life is one of basics. Enough so that their kids don't get fucked for falling out of the wrong vagina, but they ain't becoming rich people out of it. The second thing is healthcare and college for all. This should be a no brainer but I have long since given up understanding the US obsession with privatised healthcare and college. Getting help when you are sick and getting a good education should not cost and arm and a leg and should not out people into financial difficulties. It should be one of the main functions of government to ensure that their populace is looked after health wise and is well educated. If it is not doing that, the system is broken. Sanders has crunched the numbers and believes that socialised healthcare will be cheaper than what you and others are paying privately. These numbers have been pored over and are hard to argue with. It would also decouple your job away from healthcare coverage, which will only be a good thing as well.

What I will say to you, from looking in from the outside, the democratic party in general has its issues, but they are garden variety issues that could be fixed by people voting at local and state level. They fundamentally seem to give a fuck about the people though (not just those who voted for them). The Republican party has lost itself and its message entirely and the criminality in this current regime alone would see me vote anybody but Trump.

Edit: I would like to say good on you for looking at your options and don't just take what I am saying at face value. Look at their policies themselves, look at their voting history and educate yourself. I swear to god getting representation that aligns with your core beliefs will make life better for you in the long run. But any politician who feels like a shill for corporations, you need to be super wary of. Hope some other people can give you their two cents here as well. 

Also, the Republican party didnt always suck completely, from what I can see. I disagree with so many of their opinions but there were some smart guys in there with courage in their convictions and logic to their actions. Right now this feels wholly absent."
