Now if youâ€™re talking an iPhone or something, big box stores keep the IMIE info on file so if the phone is stolen they just report the IMIE and the phone can never be used.

PublicFreakout,ff24z71,t3_er54qf,1579493954.0,"Iâ€™m an American who lived most of my childhood and a good portion of my adult life in Mexico, I canâ€™t be  sure if this is in Mexico but they are definitely speaking Spanish, I also taught autistic orphans computers while there. 

In Mexico its much different then in the US, Children with autism and most any handicap are treated as demon spawn or demon children. They are often seen as a nuisance and discarded at birth. Mexico has almost no program to help them and they are often thrown in with all the other children and made to fend for themselves. 

I can tell you for sure that none of the teachers are trained to deal with special needs and often allow other kids to pick on them without coming to their defense. This is likely why the teacher allowed this to happen and only stepped in when the other student got in the bullies face. 

Itâ€™s pretty sad how these poor kids are treated but itâ€™s unfortunately part of their culture. This isnâ€™t an excuse and I still believe itâ€™s disgusting behavior, just offering some context for anyone who might be curious."

AtlFilmmakers,fdxjgax,t3_en4wmu,1578769270.0,"ATL Local 479 checking in, youâ€™re good, I started when I was 16, tomorrow I turn 37, I took 6 years off and came back to it when I was 34. No such thing as too old however your choosing a path that is very difficult to break into. To do it right youâ€™ll need to log 600 days on a union show as a PA then apply for entry into the DGA. This is a difficult task that requires you to save every call sheet you get with your name on it. My GF is in the DGA as an assistant Director and believe me, itâ€™s challenging and requires quite a lot of long hours and verbal abuse. Itâ€™s definitely not for the weak willed. 

On the other hand you can go the non union Indy route and start directing tomorrow. It doesnâ€™t really require much but youâ€™re chances of making a living a significantly lower then the union route. 

I didnâ€™t personally know much about the Indy world here. Only that it exists and some people are successful. 

Alternatively you could also learn a craft and join a union like mine and play with different departments and see if something speaks to you. The chances of becoming a successful director is completely based on part luck and part skill. You could be the best director in the world in your mind and know exactly what you are doing but still never get hired. 

Anyhow, I wish you all the luck but if you make this choice, know it comes with a lot of sacrifice. Relationships outside the industry are tough to maintain, having animals is almost impossible, children is rough. Pretty much doing anything accept eating and sleeping while on a show is a challenge. If youâ€™re good at time management youâ€™ll be fine but it does get tiring. 

Again, good luck."

â€œJail breaking, or implementing a JTAG mod, on your console allows you to play home brew software and hack your video game library. Hooking up a JTAG mod on the PS3 is simple when done as a soft mod (flashing the software) rather than as a hard mod (rewiring the console). Owners of PlayStation 3 consoles with 3.55 firmware can use a USB flash drive and a few downloaded files to JTAG their PS3 and enjoy hacks in games such as ""Call of Duty."""
ps3homebrew,fdx043j,t1_fdwxfa7,1578763965.0,Just another name for jailbreaking but seems you are already jail broken so just research mod menus for games you wanna play. Itâ€™s best with games that you would benefit from having unlimited money and weapons.

Pizza,fcv8qqm,t1_fcv55da,1577996991.0,"Yes! I have two peels, a large wooden one, which is what I use to transfer it to the oven and a metal one for rotating and retrieving it from the oven. 


So I guess Iâ€™m doing it right I just need more practice. 

The other issue is not having a stone thatâ€™s big enough, mine is about the size of a medium pizza so Iâ€™m always concerned itâ€™s going to slide off the edges of the Stone. Itâ€™s weird because when I was younger and made pizza I never had an issue and now for some reason I do. I remember when I was younger I didnâ€™t have all the toys and Iâ€™d use a cookie sheet to transfer it to the oven. 

The other issue Iâ€™m still working on it figuring out the right dough recipe. I never seem to get the yeast all frothy like I see it in videos. Mine always seems to look like brown water. I assume itâ€™s because my water temp isnâ€™t correct? Might be time to get a laser thermometer to make sure Iâ€™m not killing my yeast or that the water is too cold. I buy all the high end 00 flour and use a scale to measure everything out but it never comes out that good. 

So seems the moral of the story is practice makes perfect. I have the right technique I just need to do it more until it becomes 2nd nature. 

Thanks for the comment!"
AskElectronics,fcuuc4e,t1_fcts9dz,1577988670.0,"You could use film gels, look up a company called Rosco, I work in the industry and gels are part of my department. I will warn you though, itâ€™s very expensive, a single roll of one color can range between $100 and $300 but you could go to the rental house and ask them for scraps that they have left over from cutting out 4x4 frames. 

Blue looks like full CTB (color temperature blue) and and red is just red and the yellow can be achieved in many ways. You could use super white flame, yellow gel, combo of CTO(color temperature orange) and opal(diffusion) for it. 

I can look in my stuff when I get home and see what I have and if you want Iâ€™ll send some to you if you pay postage?

Anyway Rosco also has a color chart that you can look at but most rental houses are only going to carry the popular ones. 

Let me know if you need any help, and so you know there are other cheaper companies that make gel, a few are very close to Rosco and others are very very bad so stick to Rosco or another brand that the rental company sells. 

The scraps usually get thrown away so they shouldnâ€™t mind giving it to you for free and sometimes even have a big garbage can full of it."

Iâ€™d be happy to CNC you a control panel if you pay for materials and shipping. Shouldnâ€™t be that much. 

As for painting MDF, I have done it ALL, you need to first seal it then prime it. Whoever started this bullshit about primer and paint in one just wants to watch the worlds burn! 

Steps are, seal, sand, clean, seal, prime, sand, prime, sand, paint, paint and clear. Donâ€™t use shaker can paint, use house exterior primer and paint. 


If youâ€™re looking for mirror finish follow the same steps but youâ€™ll need to paint it like a car. There is a fantastic tutorial on YouTube, Iâ€™ll try to edit and link it but word of warning itâ€™s a bitch and requires some reasonably expensive paint tools and compressor, your main mistake was likely using water based spray paint which will give you that fuzzy nasty finish. Oil based is best. I have gotten decent results with kils oil based primer. 


I am in the middle of renovating and moving into my new house/shop so it might be a little before Iâ€™m setup and ready but as I said Iâ€™m more then happy to help with some CNC work. I can do it on plexi, MDF, cabinet grade plywood, pretty much any material you want. If you have CNC Gcode already Iâ€™m happy to cut it for you otherwise I can help you design one that will make life a bit easier. Check my history for my most recent build, Iâ€™m always making improvements but the most recent took me a year from design to finish do to the person wanting a ton of controls in a small package. Im no expert but a lot of us here have made all the same mistakes as you and we can all offer you assistance. However Iâ€™d be lying if I said it wasnâ€™t all worth it. My cabinets always get comments when friends are over and itâ€™s always the center of the party. 


Anyway send me a message if you need any help with anything, otherwise good luck!"
