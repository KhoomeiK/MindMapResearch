Honestly it's a weird relationship and can be illegal in a lot of places if sexual. But really not unheard of not necessarily always pointing to a pedophile (though is suspicious of abusive relationships since they are probably taking the lead on all of this)

Honestly I encourage people to spontaneously have a quick conversation with people, you never know how much it means to some people, but often it can mean the world.


Also asking prematurely might make them shut you out for various reasons."
uAlberta,fdomzoh,t1_fdomiiu,1578608451.0,"If you can only review each class 30min a day that's better than nothing.

I find in lectures it's usually a mix of trying to correctly interpret the important info and writing it down. Reflecting after class and what was gone over and trying to understand it in your own terms from your own notes should help you stay up with the class.

Also of you have assignmenrts you can do those during those times.


I generally have the rule that weekdays are work days, I get all the shit I need to do, and go hard those days, but on weekends I don't even think about school at all unless absolutely necessary, gotta protect that mental health too."
uAlberta,fdoikyu,t3_emg9m6,1578605874.0,"Go to class is the best first defense.

Second is at least review each class 1.5hrs the same day as each class, so if you have 2 classes then 3hrs review of what you learnt.

Third is start studying for finals early, not to wait til the week of.


If you were looking for actual study methods, those very from class. For physics and Stats and Math, doing questions help.

Social sciences I would think reviewing is good.

Universally working through old exams and trying to answer each question without help should be quite a decent way.


You may not want to do/might wanna cheat once a day, but generally if you follow this advice perfectly come final you shouldn't have to worry about passing and can focus more on getting good grades, ect.


Also do as I say not as I do cause I'm weak and work and am tired all the time and should probably quit but money is nice to have, don't work."

Then I really like math, but not much for jobs in pure math, but compliments compsci, do throw those together"

uAlberta,fdnxcao,t1_fdnu90r,1578594752.0,"If you are struggling with questions of precalc nature, like factoring, trig, abs, it is probably a very good idea.

As you go through more classes they don't focus so much on how to do question and less are the ideas and processes of it.

Then won't say you need to factor a^3-b^3, they will assume you have already done it.

Probably a little bit of an exaggeration but if your stuck on the precalc stuff in your calc class, it's going to be a rough time."

And ideas or suggestions? Like a group chat, or something?"
