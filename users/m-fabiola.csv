GilmoreGirls,ff3wxgp,t1_ff3wra5,1579550645.0,Yeah I agree because I think a larger theme in that separation was that Rory & Lorelei were almost too close. Rory was doing a late teen rebellion and differentiating herself from her mother for the time
GilmoreGirls,ff3wo3u,t3_eridps,1579550479.0,Rory was really angry and defensive when she initially brought up taking time off from school to Lorelei so I always thought it was just her being angry and resentful.

It‚Äôll probably be helpful to read the episode descriptions after every few chapters I guess to gage where you are, however there is one episode toward the middle of the series that has nothing to do with the book really"

I would suggest wearing ear plugs at least to dull the sound & headphones also work but as soon as you feel yourself getting triggered is it possible to walk away& retreat to your room ?
