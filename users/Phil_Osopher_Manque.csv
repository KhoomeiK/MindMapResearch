In the US anyway, most adult people *are* fat people."
fatlogic,fdji0k7,t3_elcpmx,1578471704.0,"Not a rant but an observation:

Maintenance is working well. Just changed my flair from 165# to 160#. I checked my Excel spreadsheet on which I record my daily weight (how it fluctuates!) and the median weight for the past 30 days was 159.3#. 

Standard BMI: 22.2, ""New"" BMI: 21.4 

So this is right where I want to be! However, I got here with a bit of a cheat. In December I got a bad cold, and then the flu, really really sick. At one point I only ate one small bowl of rice porridge over a 2 day period. Weight plummeted to 156#.

This is not how I want to lose weight! But I'll take it for the time being, as it does seem to have reset my ""settling point"". We'll see how much I can maintain around 160 in the next 30 days as well."
