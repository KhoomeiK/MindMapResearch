DIY,ff4hic3,t3_erh2q6,1579563743.0,"Nicely done! The way you positioned each of the colored pencils and angled the end cuts gives it a really satisfying starburst look.

I'm curious how you got them all to stay in place; lightweight objects are notorious for shifting around once you start pouring resin on them. Did you just stick the back ends of the pencils into your casting material then cut them flush after the cure, or did you use another method?

Edit: Just looked through your image gallery where you explained that you did indeed use the method I suspected, though you actually flush trimmed both sides. That's probably easier than cutting and positioning each pencil perfectly and using a self leveling epoxy.

You also mentioned that a few of the horizontal pencils did float out during the pour; a good trick to prevent that is to drill a couple small holes on the back of the pencil then wood glue some toothpicks in so you have something to stick into the cast. That said the true mark of a DIYer is the ability to recover from small mistakes and make it look as though you'd planned it that way all along.

You will always notice the small epoxy blemishes because you made it, but everyone else will only ever see an heirloom quality work of art."
oddlysatisfying,ff4gvbd,t1_ff2tgqm,1579563302.0,"In addition to what others have said about the likely presence of plant fibers, it's also likely that the sample was only compressed downward.

Rather than a 3-dimensional compactor, it's likely that the loose material was poured into a tall rectangular mold, then compressed in a single direction (down) to form the brownie shaped sample.

When you compress something (especially if it contains long fibers of material) it tends to decompress in the opposite manner of which it was compressed."
Damnthatsinteresting,ff4gevm,t3_erg7jt,1579562987.0,"The reason the mixer was abandoned is absolutely not that it was ""too heavy to move"". The real reason is that it never made economic sense to move it.

It looks to be only a few yards from the road, in a ditch with maybe 10% grade at most. Even if it were full of cured concrete, a few heavy duty winches mounted to a pair of trucks could easily drag it next to the road, where a small lifter could easily load it onto a truck trailer to carry back to the concrete service. They could have then broken the cured concrete out of the inside of the mixer, and potentially used it again. The only thing that stopped them from doing this is that the cost of retrieving and cleaning this mixer would likely be greater than simply buying a new mixer.

Whoever owns that property probably doesn't care that the mixer was left there either. They likely have a huge property, and easement laws prevent them from utilizing the land within ~10 ft of the road anyway. It doesn't lower their property value, and if the owner of the mixer declines to retrieve it, the property owner is free to break it down for scrap."

nextfuckinglevel,fei9tyz,t1_feh8bw8,1579133509.0,"That's not as dangerous since she's commiting to a full rotation; The ""Korbut flip"" has you mostly cancel your momentum after half a backflip so you can grab the bar.

nextfuckinglevel,fei9d09,t1_feh8y7u,1579133203.0,"It may look scarier, but think about it this way: what could actually happen if she fails to perform the trick correctly?

With the hip spin on the lower bar, she's only about 4-5 feet above the mat and is in a tight spin. If she flung loose from the bar during this trick, it would be a short fall and she'd have a good chance of using the spin to land on her feet; gymnasts are crazy good at landing safely provided they have a bit of spin to work with (they can flatten out to slow the spin or tuck to speed up).

What makes the ""Korbut flip"" so dangerous is a combination of the height (at the peak of the jump she's about 8ft off the mat) and the lack of spin; she basically has to do a precise half-backflip and cancel her momentum so she can grab the bar. If she missed the grab, she'd fall right past the top bar torso/head first, with virtually no ability to rotate her legs underneath her.

assholedesign,fd20hzi,t1_fd1quld,1578139738.0,"They are actually the best style of razor for thick hair (aside from a straight razor, but those are for crazy people).

When a razor cuts your beard hair, that hair has to go somewhere so that it's out of the way of the next cut. If your facial hair is thick, and your razor has multiple blades stacked close together in a tight cluster, the cut hair will struggle to clear out of the way and will clog up the space between the blades. A clogged cartridge razor will at best fail to cut your hair, and at worst it will snag hairs and rip them out. Safety razors have a single blade with ample room for clearing cut hair, and if they do get clogged they're super easy to rinse.

If you do go the way of the safety razor, I highly recommend getting a sample pack of blades so you can find the type that works best for you. Blades come in small cardboard boxes of 5 blades each, and Amazon sells lots of sample packs with 6 or so different boxes. Try one of each, then go through them again (since your technique will have improved by then). Once you've gone through the samples twice, pick a favorite; you can probably buy a box of 100 of them for about $10.

Also, watch a video on proper safety razor technique. Cartridge razors are more forgiving of excessive pressure since the force is distributed across multiple blades. Safety razors have just the one blade so gentle pressure and keeping a good angle are key."

One blade lasts me 2-4 shaves. 3 years later and I still have more than half the razors, and about 25% of that tub of shaving soap. Another bonus is that since the blades are paper thin, all of my used ones so far have all fit in a single disposal box (that's about the size of a D battery) with plenty of room to spare.

Cartridge razors are a scam; Gillette should have stopped when the perfected the safety razor ~100 years ago; there has been no improvement since.

I don't think your suggestion solves the problem, and I think that the current state is as good as it can be.

All of the heroes are balanced based on the assumption that there will be 2 of each role on the team. If the game were allowed to eliminate a tank or healer slot (which it would undeniably resort to most of the time) then certain heroes would be unviable for solo-tanking/solo-healing. Additionally, playing one of those roles solo would be significantly less fun, leading to fewer players queueing for them, thus putting the problem right back where it started.

The real fix is, and always has been, for players to accept personal responsibility by either not queueing for DPS exclusively, or by accepting the consequence of their decision by enduring the longer wait time.

There is no way for the devs to patch out selfishness. Any change they could conceivably make to improve the queue times would only be foiled by the consequences of players acting selfishly.

OverwatchUniversity,fcw8wj2,t1_fcvh7ou,1578019839.0,"I think it comes from some combination of empathy, guilt, and/or selflessness.

Before Role Lock, trying to play DPS meant you were part of the problem; 3-5 other teammates were likely to insta-lock DPS, so if you wanted a tank or healer, you had to be the change you wished to see in the world. 

Now with Role Lock, you can queue for DPS guilt-free knowing that you'll have a balanced team composition. The only consequence is long queue times; if you're a selfless / empathic person, you'd take a 20 minute wait any day vs. making a personal choice that negatively impacts the team."
OverwatchUniversity,fcw82cs,t1_fcuvbg9,1578019286.0,"Well that's a catch 22. People who only play DPS are the direct cause of the long queue times. If a large number of them leave the game, the queue times will shorten; if they then come back, the queue times will go right back up.

Long queue times for DPS players is nothing more than the consequence of the problem being shifted onto those causing the problem; previously everyone suffered, now only those contributing suffer.

This all started with too many players locking DPS and refusing to swap; the devs encouraged more players to flex, but far too many continued to be selfish, so they added role lock to solve the 4-5 DPS problem.

This led to long queue times for the Damage role, because too many players are still refusing to play tank or support. Rather than remain available during the wait time, these selfish players believe that their free time is more valuable than everyone else's, so they go AFK and risk match cancellations. Rather than accept personal responsibility by interpreting the act of ruining a game for 11 other people as the problem, they can only conceptualize the personal SR/leaver penalty as the problem.

Now apparantly we're at the point of trying to enable AFK behavior by using a bot to let people know when their match is ready. If this gets widespread adoption, it's only going to make DPS queue times worse, because more players will be willing to wait through long queue times now that they're free to walk away.

You can't perpetually kick the can down the road and expect a technology solution for the problem you're contributing to."

whatintarnation,fctfilv,t1_fcs4ulx,1577941621.0,"""Circular saw"" is just the generic term for the Skilsaw (a style of power-saw invented by the company SKIL).

Calling it a circular saw distinguishes it from other types of saws. Some also have circular blades, like a ""table saw"" or ""miter saw"". Others have blades in different shapes, like a ""band saw"", ""jigsaw"", or ""reciprocating saw"".

The term ""circular saw"" was probably not the best choice for generic Skilsaws, but that's what we're stuck with."

changemyview,fcp50c2,t3_ei8ckv,1577850661.0,"I agree with you as an individual who shares the same opinion, but depending on the context I believe the opposite is true from the perspective of society as a whole.

For example, if a politician is accused of wrongdoing, it's often in their best interest to deny it /deflect blame and hope everyone moves on when it ceases to be interesting. Admitting to the wrongdoing and apologizing only serves to legitimize the criticism, and raises concerns as to what else they may be up to, leading to calls for their resignation.

I don't like it, but the harsh reality seems to be that people in power don't apologize because the bulk of society won't accept apologies from them.

Peers, and those with minor separations of power are capable of accepting apologies, especially if the acceptance is decided on an individual basis or there is interest in preserving a relationship.

For example, I can personally forgive a friend, a relative, or a direct supervisor if they sincerely apologize for a misdeed. If however the CEO of a large corporation screws up, they're going to have a much harder time getting the collective acceptance of the whole company should they admit fault; they'll likely have to step down."
WinStupidPrizes,fcouuor,t1_fclttda,1577842189.0,"That's why bull fighters don't actually fight the bull at it's full strength.

Spanish bullfights are a 3 step process:

1) First Picadors on horseback armed with lances ""fight""  the bull by repeatedly riding past and stabbing it in the neck. Their goal is to tire the bull out and make it more difficult for it to raise it's horns.

2) Next 3 Banderillas ""fight"" the bull by jabbing barbed spikes into it's shoulders. Their goal is to lower the bull's speed and maneuverability, while simultaneously pissing it off so it maintains the will to fight.

3) Finally the Matador comes out with a sword and cloth to finish off the bull. This is the part people think of when they imagine bullfighting, but it's little more than a coward stabbing to death a severely wounded and bleeding animal. They waggle the cloth to get the bull to charge them a few times so that it has the illusion of being a fight. At this point the bull can barely coordinate itself due to all the damage it's already received; it's only sustained by rage.

Spanish breeders take pride in the strength and ferocity of their fighting bulls, but over the generations they obviously did their jobs too well; the bulls are too formidable for anyone to fight them without severely crippling them first."
