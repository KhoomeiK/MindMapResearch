We both support each other and we communicate phenomenally. I’d argue if you don’t know for sure after a year or so, you are with the wrong person.

Most of the people I know who are divorced dated for 5 years or more. They didn’t really feel it but were dating so long it had to be the next step right?"

Now I expect men to be able to support themselves, but I know many many men who are loaded who think they are hit shit because it. Despite the fact they have no decent traits as a partner whatsoever. My husband makes less than I do, but he respects me and treats me far better than men I’ve dated who make 5x more."

I work in special education and the formal psychological, speech/language, and occupational assessments have come a very long way and are significantly less biased than they used to be. The issue is many assessments are 10+ years old and poor quality. The new assessments published in the past 5 years tend to be great."
AskReddit,fdznlbd,t1_fdyuvg4,1578792044.0,"This isn’t true for modern assessments. They specifically look at racial, SES, and family education level as part of the normative sample to ensure the bias is minimal."

relationship_advice,fdbol7r,t3_ekilwh,1578259550.0,"Look, I literally got married 3 days ago at the courthouse because I didn' want to deal with the drama. 

Let's face it *weddings aren't for the bride and the groom*. This is a lie people tell and it only ends up hurting you. Your wedding isn't about you because everyone has a say and you have to do all of this shit you don't wanna do to appease people you barely care about. 

Go to a courthouse with you, your fiance and whatever family/friends you want. Most places near me accommodate between 10-20 people max. We had 8 total people at my wedding. Fuck we didn't even have rings. It was less than 2 minutes. This is about YOU and YOUR future husband and if you want it to be about YOU, you have to just go do it.

If you have a family that can't handle their shit, they don't get a wedding. That's on them."

It’s very high pace; I am constantly making snap gut based decisions during treatment sessions. My treatment sessions are 30 mins so by the time I’m getting irritated with a kid, I’m basically finished with them anyway. I am constantly troubleshooting and fixing the breakdown children’s speech sound systems, language systems, emotional regulation skills. It’s bad ass and I love that part. I also very much love doing diagnostic evaluations to get to the bottom of “What this hell is up with this one?”.

I don’t like the adults I have to work with a lot, but I am completely autonomous in my job. I loathe the paperwork. I had to get a master’s degree to work. It certainly has it’s downsides"
