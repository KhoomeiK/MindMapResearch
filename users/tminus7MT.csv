AppalachianTrail,ffd5xds,t1_ffd3b9l,1579814050.0,"I mean, do you plan on running though? I have above-average size titties, but also not a big fan of bras. On long hikes, the discomfort of wearing a bra, especially when I’m not used to wearing one, is not worth it just to reduce the jiggle a bit. You could try a short hike with a bra and without though to see what’s comfortable for you. 

If you do go with a bra, I’d just go with one of the super relaxed sleep-style bras. They don’t compress like sports bras, and are real comfortable for extended wear."
BDSMAdvice,ffd492g,t3_esyzqh,1579813118.0,"It’s your wife, dude. She’s asking for you to still make her feel like she is. When she says love making, she’s asking for the intimacy, kindness, and gentle affection from you that she doesn’t get from your dynamic. She shouldn’t have to command you as your Domme in order for you to do what she’s asking you to do as your wife. It sounds like your mind is coming at this issue from the wrong angle. As much as she loves to be your domme, which fulfills all of your needs, it sounds like she is communicating to you that her needs aren’t fully met from this dynamic. This doesn’t seem like a BDSM problem, it seems like a relationship problem. 

When you have these romantic sessions, how does it happen? Do you plan it? Who initiates? 

My advice is for you to come at this as an act of service, and be romantic about it. Light the candles, get the lotion, put on the baby-making R&B, talk and laugh and enjoy each other’s company while you take turns massaging every inch of each other. Use this as time to reconnect, as partners, instead of as part of your dynamic. Sit on the couch and just make out during a movie like teenagers. She’s asking for you to still court her during your marriage and within your dynamic, and it shouldn’t be a boner-killing chore to do so."
AppalachianTrail,ffd2a8n,t3_esz053,1579812004.0,"Of course, as long as you’re normally comfortable when you exercise without a bra, there’s no reason to wear one. If you sometimes get nipple chafing, you could just wear a tight tank top or comfy sleep bra underneath."

I had almost the exact same thing happen when I was in college. 2AM my boyfriend at the time had to drive me to the ER where I was stuck for 3-4 hours, by which time the pain was starting to fade, for the doctors there to tell me that the redness and irritation was probably just an infection. Did they test for an infection? Of course not. So one ER bill and a prescription for powerful antibiotics later, I just went to the OB/GYN the next day for an ultrasound where they told me I had a hemorrhagic cyst burst on my ovary and had been bleeding internally all night. :// obviously switched birth control immediately, and firmly refuse to go to the ER ever again. 

My mom’s advice after working at hospitals as an RN for 20 years is that if you don’t have a knowledgeable advocate with you, the hospital is going to kill you before your condition will. After hearing so many similar horror stories, I believe it."

Ex “I’m getting really concerned about smoking and driving. It’s driving while intoxicated and x, x, x reasons. I’ve noticed you keep edging the time you feel good to drive after smoking up, and I don’t feel I can trust you to be my designated driver anymore. This is a big issue for me, I don’t feel respected when you’re okay with endangering my life and our finances/home/livelihood over something this stupid. We need to lay some ground rules for this.”

Go from there, set up rules together. Make weed a “only when you’re home, and in for the night” thing if that works for the both of you.

Anxiety,ff6a8ra,t3_erwbgi,1579622757.0,"I’m sorry, sweetheart, this sounds like a very stressful situation for you and your family. There is not a lot you can do for her besides what your family is already doing, and I know hearing “It just takes time” sucks. The pit that your sister is in is so hard to get out of, but it sounds like she has the support system she needs to crawl back up. 

Try not to push school, have your parents considered online or home schooling? It could be necessary for her to not fall behind academically , while still maintaining her health. 

Keep being supportive and firm! Maybe think about finding a good nature trail to start visiting or maybe a volunteer charity that you’re both interested it, and make a habit to go once or twice a week. Being outside, just for a walk, in the woods can be a great way to unwind from anxiety. Get your whole family to go if it would help. Get some binoculars and just go sit with some sketch pads and draw the trees, birds, plants, whatever you like. Make a safe place escape where she doesn’t have to think about school or her friends, just the world around her. If she can’t go to school, she needs to still just get out of the house once or twice a week, and it doesn’t have to be an awful thing."

Better socialization, better bite inhibition, and normally the start of potty training and obedience imprinting. If your breeder is fine with that, and you’re okay that they might charge a fee for the extra food and socialization, there wouldn’t be any problems with it."

And, I still felt useful being able to heal him even tho I’m not good at actually killing anything yet. Once I kind got the hang of it and figured out what I liked doing, then I made several different classes to see and ended up with a Druid. Druid I think is a real nice beginner class because you can try a little bit of everything, turn into a bear, and there aren’t 17 million buttons to push and keep up with like the priest had.

Greyhounds,fezd3wv,t1_fez24er,1579456084.0,"Okay, the first step is management, making sure the problem doesn’t get worse. So, no more plush toys or greenies for now. Just store them out of sight, out of mind. It’s easier to work on resource guarding with low value items first, and then work your way up to the higher value items. 

Step two is getting him some more appropriate toys for heavy chewers. The extreme black Kongs are popular, benebones are fantastic and last for a couple months in my house before the small plastic pieces become rice-grain sized and I replace them, I like Goughnuts because they have an indestructible guarantee, and I also have really been loving the super chewer bark boxes because of the variety and puzzle toys. Toys should be large or extra large, and he should never be able to fit the whole thing in his Mouth at once so he can’t try to swallow them. 

Step three is actually starting to work on the resource guarding. How do you normally give him toys and treats? Does he have to work for them? Does he snatch things or is he very gentle when taking objects from you? How is his “Leave it” and “Drop it” command? A good technique to start, is learning a trading game. When he has a Lower value toy or chew, sit down and offer him a higher value treat like peanut butter or cheese whiz, when he drops the toy/chew and goes for the treat, reward that behavior and let him go back to his chew afterwards. When he starts to get the game, then you can reach for the toy/chew and hold it while he takes the treat (which is why I like peanut butter for it, takes him a second to eat) and immediately offer him the toy/chew back once he’s done. I love puzzle toys for this because then I take the toy, fill it with treats or peanut butter, and give it back even better than when I took it. The whole idea is working to show him that toys and chews will not go away just because you interact with them, and that he gets even better rewards when you do interact with them. Me and my resource possessive dog also play a great game called “Hold this while I chew on it” that is her absolute favorite. I use a big chew, hold one end, and just let her stand there and go to town, occasionally wiggling it for her. It’s like a variation of tug of war. I let her take it away and chew on it a couple times, and reward her heavily when she comes back and asks me to hold it for her again."
AskWomen,fez7utu,t3_eqxs0f,1579454594.0,"I love my mom to pieces, but I would never have the amazing relationship I have with her as an adult if she had been my best friend as a kid.  My mother knew her job was to be a parent before anything else. We did not always get along when I was growing up, and I’m so thankful for that, because she taught me how to argue with respect, and how to forgive. No matter what was going on, or how mad we were, she always made me say “I love you” at the end of an argument. There was always a discussion when we calmed down, she talked to me about how I made her feel and allowed me to do the same. She showed me empathy and taught me to always show it to others. No one was allowed to raise their voice or slam doors, including her and my dad. 


She always let me know I could talk to her about anything, and she was always amazing and supportive of my goals and ideas. She told me that if anyone made me uncomfortable at all, to tell her. And that if she ever made me uncomfortable, to tell my dad or grandma. And she respected it when I did tell her, and never forced me to interact with that person again. Even more than that, she led by example. She wanted me to have a good work ethic so she worked fucking hard, she was a DIY Queen, she would landscape, fix plumbing, paint trim, pursue her own business ventures and never quit if they didn’t work out. She made me a part of all of it, no matter how much I complained. She taught me that business is business, and no matter what’s happening with your personal life, it stays out of your professional life. And vice versa. 

She wanted me to be kind, so she showed it. She made a point to take me to volunteer two or three times a month, to make me offer to share what I had with my friends, every holiday we would spend the full day before it cooking for the shelter and the morning of we would go deliver armfuls of pies and homecooked food to the shelter. We stopped to help turtles cross the road, rescued baby squirrels and birds, always checked stray dogs for collars or chips to try to get them home. 

She wanted me to know my own worth, so she never accepted anything less for herself. Sometimes it seemed like she let people walk all over her, but she explained to me that killing them with kindness was the only true way to win. She showed that every service and kindness she showed to someone was given without any thought of what she would receive in return, so she could not be taken advantage of. She was kind because she wanted to be, everything she did for others was because SHE wanted to do it. 

She wanted me to know that I can achieve anything I put my mind to, so she did the same, she took up new hobbies all the time, went back to school to get a degree, and saved up to take a couple trips on her own to a foreign country.  All of these trips and experiences were not optional, I had to do them, and I’m glad she made me.

My father was her first husband, and she left when I was too young to really remember. By every account from people that knew him, and the few memories I do have, he was abusive, lazy garbage. But, I never heard her say a word against him, because he was my father. When I was old enough to start wondering about it, she was honest with my questions. She told me it was my decision and if I wanted to meet him and have a relationship with him, she would do anything she could to support it and help me. That no matter what he’s done, he still did her the biggest favor anyone ever had by giving her me. I never wanted to, and when he somehow got my phone number when I was a young teenager, I called her, terrified, and said I didn’t want to talk to him. She took care of it, and he never contacted me again. She had a rough start, and got married and pregnant young, but it never stopped her and she never felt bad for herself. 

Then She found a man that treated her how she wanted a man to treat me. And I am so thankful that she gave me the example she did because It means that I have not and will never settle for less. After 20 years they separated suddenly, and she was shocked and hurt, and still was not done teaching me. They both handled the separation with love, kindness, and grace. They still care deeply about each other, talk regularly, and are very close friends. They make sure that we still do holidays as a family, we still have a family group chat. Because it doesn’t matter that their relationship didn’t work out, and it doesn’t matter if it hurts a little bit sometimes to see and talk to each other, it’s worth it. They are still there for each other, and always will be. She showed me what real, true, selfless love is, and continues to show me every day. 

And I guess you know that she did a lot of things right when I can write this much on it and still feel like I could fill a whole book about it.

Edit: I’m glad y’all love my mom too!! She’s my constant inspiration to be a better person, and the coolest lady on earth. I did end up showing her this post, and some of the comments, we had a good cry about it, lol! Thank y’all for being so nice, she was so so excited to see what people said!"
depression,feywoxk,t1_feysem5,1579451474.0,"Alright, I’m just letting you know, I also grew up in the Deep South and moved to the PNW several years ago. I travel all over the country, road trip cross country 3-4 times a year. Definitely not less tweakers, if anything, there’s more meth and heroin here than I ever saw in south AL. People really don’t change that much wherever you go, there are always the same general categories. Your heavily religious people just become Mormons in the northwest, your big money is still big money, the trailer parks are still trailer parks, and there are still the same problems. The accents and the weather change, but that’s about it. It’s great that marijuana helps your chronic illness, but it isn’t the best choice for your mental health, or at least the amount you’re doing isn’t. Since it’s legal in some states now, we’re able to find out a lot more about it and if you’re dealing with depression, marijuana isn’t going to help you with that. It just stops you from actually dealing with the issue. Really, it will make any medication that you take for mental illness ineffective. While marijuana in itself is not addictive, when used with other substances and medications, it can increase your likelihood of developing an addiction to those substances. It takes away your motivation and makes you more likely to suffer from psychotic episodes, schizophrenia, dementia, and Alzheimer’s. It’s not a totally safe bandaid for your problems. 

There is definitely the possibility for marijuana to be a great medical tool, but there is not any science on dosage, and just like with cigarette companies 50 years ago, no one is going to tell you about the harmful side effects. And just like with cigarette companies, your dealer isn’t going to tell you about how it was grown. Hemp plants are used all over the world to absorb toxic metals and contaminants from the soil because they are fantastic at leeching everything from the soil around them. This includes pesticides, radiation, and heavy metals, none of which you should be ignoring and inhaling into your lungs. There are several CBD brands that have had lawsuits over heavy metal poisoning because they buy the contaminated hemp at an amazing discounted price. Dispensaries are nice because you have a slightly better idea of what exactly is going into your lungs, but THC concentrations are getting higher and higher in the professional growing world. The medical use, safe/natural plant framing, it’s all the same thing cigarette companies did. It’s a very successful marketing technique, and the people that sell it to you are not in the market for making sure that their clientele are making informed decisions. 

Overall, I love weed too. But it’s not a magic, perfectly safe miracle plant. I’m all for legalization and recreational use, because how is it different than drinking or smoking tobacco? It’s a fun time, but moderation is important just like anything else in life. You have a right to make informed decisions about your body and what you put in it, so don’t just take anyone’s word for it. Look for the studies, pick up a book on addiction medicine, and don’t brush any addiction off as harmless."

puppy101,feypkrb,t1_feyf8oq,1579448789.0,"Having the crate in your room is a good start, stay the course for a couple nights, continue to build that positive crate association with meals and learning a “Go to bed” cue during the day. When she gets a bit more comfortable with the crate during the day, you can start asking her to take a nap instead of waiting for her to go in by herself, but give it a couple weeks. 

Also, keep in mind every puppy is different. For one of my current dogs, I actually put the crate on the end of my bed and let her sleep there for the first few weeks, it’s how she was the most calm. Then, transitioned the crate to the floor right next to the bed, and slowly farther away. For my other, we had to crate her on the other side of the house at first because she could not settle if she could see us. You can definitely experiment with it! Just give it at least a few days in each location before moving it again. Honestly, it’s a good idea to change the location of the crate every once in a while anyway, it prevents the puppy getting too possessive of one area of the house, and lets her get used to all of the spaces over time."

It takes a lot more time than that for things to start going smoothly, so take a deep breath, and keep doing what you’re doing. It’s going to be fine, but it’s not going to be instant. Check back in a month or so if you’re still not confident about crate training, but right now there’s nothing to worry about. That was a totally normal night with a young puppy."

Or immediately preceding it, did anything happen in the garden? Could have been something silly like weather, a bird that startled him, some lawn furniture changed positions, the grass got cut and he wasn’t used to it being stiff and pokey. His behavior just sounds like something spooked him outside. Have you tried taking him to a different area like maybe out the front door down the road a bit and seeing if he just seems nervous about outside in general, or just the garden? 

If you can figure out what spooked him, it just makes it easier to work on building a positive association with that stimulus. If you can’t think of anything, start with some basics! Get him really excited for meals, take him outside,  and then sit with him in the garden while he eats. Whenever you initiate playtime, move things into the garden and get him actively involved with playing with you outside. Keep it short at first, reward him with lots of praise and excitement for voluntarily coming further from the door. Keep outside time positive, happy, and he’ll get used to it again in no time."
AskWomen,fenvx4j,t3_eq5a2y,1579291711.0,"I actually love period sex, so someone that wasn’t willing to have sex when I was on my period would probably just not be compatible long term. I’m not interested in being celibate for a week every month, I love that orgasms make my cramps minimal and take away my back pain, and there are enough people who don’t enjoy having sex on their period that I don’t feel the need to compromise on it. Don’t like it, plenty of other options out there for you. 

Someone who was grossed out by periods though? Nah. Grow up, it happens, and there’s nothing gross about it. If you hunt, fish, change your own car oil, or kill bugs, all of those activities are way more bloody and/or nasty than the 2 tablespoons of blood that are immediately soaked up into a sanitary product and tossed away.

I once accidentally trained my dog to head-butt me in the stomach when she gets excited. I didn’t mean to, but I was absentmindedly reinforcing the behavior when I was sitting on the couch petting her while she would slowly bury her head into me. It was cute, blah blah, didn’t really see it as a problematic behavior. A few months of this later, we were playing in the yard and I called her over to me while she was all worked up and all 120lbs of her came flying across the yard head-first into my gut. Now, I was able to acknowledge that I had made a problem behavior, and it definitely took a few weeks to change it, but learning is an ongoing process!

And if you haven’t puppy proofed the yard, the dog is only 7 months old, outside for 12 hours by itself, he will get bored and dig holes, chew on fences or the house, eat anything that’s out there. There are plenty of dogs that enjoy spending a day outside, but it really depends on your environment if that’s realistic.

It’s a living thing that will have the intelligence of a 2-4 year old child. I love dogs, I work with them for a living, and I love the work and reward of raising puppies. But Honestly, it would be an instant deal breaker for me just knowing that my partner makes that kind of huge decision about our life without consulting me first. Even if he didn’t realize what a commitment it was, that’s no excuse. It just shows that he’s immature and doesn’t do his research before making decisions.
