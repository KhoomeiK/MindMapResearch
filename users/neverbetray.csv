I don't disagree, as I watched my beloved grandmother waste away from this disease, but eventually, it is no longer torture for the sufferer, only for the family.  My grandma was terrified when first diagnosed, having nightmares every night and grasping at straws every time a possible ""cure"" hit the news.  She cried almost constantly, but as she got further and further from awareness of reality, she really was like a happy child, amused by the simplest things, like squeaky toys and bright balloons.  It was terrible for the family, especially my dad (her son), but she was in no physical pain and apparently no emotional pain at the end.  Everyone's experience is different, and each of us must decide for ourselves if we want to end it or let nature take its slow course.  I would judge no one on his or her choice."
