depression,felb9gp,t3_epm2ch,1579218134.0,"I’m so sorry that happened to you. I feel like with his lack of empathy and compassion there is something something wrong with him. Take that as a blessing in disguise, you saw his true colors before you were committed to him. You need a man who can love you unconditionally, and with time you will find him. For now, use this time to focus on healing yourself. ♥️ best of luck to you"
eczema,fe72uyh,t3_enp67h,1578909221.0,"The same thing happened to me! Someone asked me “what eye shadow are you wearing?” On a day I haven’t been wearing any make up ☹️😭

Sometimes, I just put concealer under my eyes and don’t put any on my upper eye lids. Haha 🙈"
depression,fdjp4pp,t1_fdjnuzg,1578481775.0,"thank you, I just started going to therapy the other day. I will be having another session on Friday. I'm just trying to think of other alternatives that I could do whenever I don't have a therapy session, or if I am at home alone. (:"
depression,fbj9qou,t3_edhcd2,1576928436.0,"All the time. I feel like I have a hard time contributing in a group discussion, because I’m so worried about sounding like an airhead. I’m pretty sure a lot people see as boring. 🥺"
weightwatchers,fbffbl4,t1_fbfe3wa,1576809195.0,"Thank you. 

I should actually consider cleaning, lol. I need to de clutter my room, I haven’t been taking care of it like I usually do. I’m glad you suggested that, cleaning should help me feel better. ♥️"
loseit,fbdlslp,t3_ectfa6,1576765712.0,"Congratulations! I just checked your older posts and you did an amazing job! I’m so inspired by you. I’m in the beginning process of my weight loss journey, and seeing people reach their goals gives me hope. 
I pray that one day I will be able to say “I did it!” and will be proud of myself. 

Great job! You looks fantastic, keep it up! ♥️"
Music,fbdhk8q,t1_fbdh9sn,1576762368.0,"Just started listening. I am currently listening to “Goose Snow Cone” and it’s making me tear up a bit. The music video reminded me of when I had my cat that died from high grade lymphoma a year ago. 

Anyways, I really like the sound of Aimee Mann’s music so far. Thank you so much for sharing! ♥️"

dating_advice,fbd5sn5,t1_fbd5qyz,1576748223.0,"Yeah, it didn’t really work out. I guess I didn’t really give it a chance though, because I only tried dating two guys. This was last year."

SuicideWatch,fbcymjq,t3_eco0n9,1576738651.0,"I lost a very close family member to suicide last month, so this hits close to home. I know that you’re going through a lot of inner pain and turmoil, but try your best to stick it out.
Everyday is a struggle, but things will get better eventually. The people that you will be leaving behind will be so hurt and won’t understand why you want to cause yourself harm. 
The pain you leave behind is everlasting on those affected. I know you say that you wanting to kill yourself is no one’s fault, but your friends and family members will be blaming themselves for the rest of their lives, knowing that they have failed you. 
Please reconsider taking your life, you never know what the future has planned for you. Yes, you’re going through a lot right now, but that’s temporary. Everything is temporary. You are not a waste of anyone’s time, and your parents clearly love you because they want you to get help by the therapist. Try giving that a shot, maybe it’ll help you. 
I’m sure that what I’m telling you doesn’t matter, but everything I’m saying comes from the bottom of my heart. I’m sorry that you’re going through this, and I’m sorry that you want to end your life. However, please try your best to stay strong and continue on living. Maybe one day you will find your purpose in life. Even though I’m just a stranger, if you want to talk, please feel free to DM me. I’m here for you."
depression,fbcy1pu,t3_eco3f7,1576737988.0,"Thank you for this, someone who actually understands that as a depressed person I don’t choose to be this way. Who in their right mind just wants to be sad all the time? It’s not a good feeling at all, and it’s mentally exhausting. 
My sister who doesn’t have a clue about depression is always telling me to stop being so weak, and to get over it. It’s really easy to say, especially if it’s coming from a person who doesn’t have any mental health issues. 
I’m trying hard to cope with it, and force myself to do things I really don’t have the energy for. However, there are those days where I just want to lay in bed and not do anything for the day. 
For those of you that are currently going through depression and anxiety, don’t let anyone make you feel bad or less because of it. Just take it one step and a time, and one day we will recover from this and things will get better eventually. Self-love is something we should all practice."
dating_advice,fbcxqp6,t1_fbcx7gk,1576737648.0,"I’m a (27F) also! Going through the same dilemma. Where can we meet these introverted guys? If only he’d show up at the front of my door. Would be nice if I don’t have to force myself to interact with a bunch of new people that I probably won’t be seeing again. Half the people I meet through mutual friends all like going out all the time and drinking out. 
I can see why guys wouldn’t approach me though, I’m usually busy doing something on my laptop if I’m in the coffee shop. I’m not sure what to do about it tbh. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
dating_advice,fbct8bd,t3_ecm75l,1576733088.0,"Hm, I’m like that and you’re right.. introverted girls are mostly found at either home or a coffee shop, or going to the movie theater.  I don’t like clubbing or that kind of scene, maybe going to concerts every now or then but that’s about it. 
Try going on internet dating sites, I’m sure there are a lot of introverted girls on there. Just be real and say exactly what you’re looking for and what you aren’t interested in. I’m sure that you’ll match with someone soon enough."
WeightLossAdvice,fbckdsl,t3_ecnakv,1576726017.0,"Way to go! I'm so happy for you, if only I had your determination and discipline! Keep it up, I am sure that you will reach your goal weight by April! You're going to feel so amazing when you get there <3"
weightwatchers,fbck0az,t1_fbc0c6s,1576725755.0,"Literally how I feel, I feel like I have to crawl out of bed just to go downstairs and get myself some food. I really don't feel like doing anything honestly. I'm just glad that I downloaded the reddit app so that I can have some people to talk to without worrying about any type of judgment."
weightwatchers,fbcjuqm,t1_fbb2edw,1576725648.0,"Going out for a walk next to the beach would be nice, but at this moment I feel like going outside the house is a chore. I need to get out of this mindset negative and gloomy mindset that I'm in."
weightwatchers,fbcjqi8,t1_fbb4hid,1576725566.0,"I should probably binge on fruits and veggies, but I never go straight for those type of foods. lol

weightwatchers,fbcjmnu,t1_fbat9ng,1576725489.0,"Yes, it's nice to know that I'm not alone in this and that there are other people in the boat as me. However, I am sorry that you are going through something similar, it's not easy. We can get through this with time and self-love. <3"

vegan,fbcjad3,t1_fbc7eqf,1576725250.0,"Thank you ! I just started watching a few documentaries on youtube, I will check out the resources that you have linked for sure. I also started the vegan bootcamp yesterday, I am hoping to be able to keep up with that and completely change my lifestyle. Most especially since all these Christmas parties are coming up, it's going to take some adjusting."
socialskills,fbbkajh,t1_fbbh9i9,1576702222.0,"Yes, I’m blessed in the sense that I have people who love and care for me. I really need to stop being so hard and down on myself. My depression and anxiety has gotten so bad ever since one of my close relatives committed suicide last month. I’m always anxious about the next thing that could possibly happen next. 

I know that I shouldn’t think that way, or anticipate the next thing that could go wrong. However, with the way that things have been going over the last year, I am a little bit traumatized by it.

You’re right though, we can get through this. It’ll take time for healing, but we can overcome all of this.  I wish you the best as well.. thanks again (:"
weightwatchers,fbbjoqm,t1_fbbh4ig,1576701863.0,"No, I haven’t been seeing a therapist. I probably should though. It isn’t something that I can currently afford and since I’m a studying abroad, I don’t have any insurance here.

I feel like that is one of the reasons why I joined the Reddit community, so that I would be able to have some sort of outlet. Hopefully one day, I can get the professional help that I need when I go back home. That’ll be a while from now unfortunately."
socialskills,fbbeweh,t3_ecgvqh,1576699006.0,"I’m really glad I stumbled upon this. I’m also going through my own personal struggles as well and am having a really hard time coping with my circumstantial depression and anxiety. It has gotten to the point where I am feeling paralyzed in a way and don’t want to leave my room. 

That was a really nice message. So I just wanted to say thank you, I really needed to hear some positivity and words of encouragement. We can get through this, just have to take it one day at a time, and need to practice self-love."
travel,fba2lyl,t3_ebxnjo,1576661228.0,"Haha, I think it is because some people are just so impatient, ""sheeple"". They always just want to be first, which is pointless. I would rather wait an extra couple of minutes while everyone else disembarks the plane, versus getting squished and trampled. Plus, it also takes time for the luggage to get to the carousel, so by the time I get there, it's waiting for me. 

It's the same thing while people are boarding the planes too. I'd rather relax and sit down chat on the phone for a bit, have everyone standing around waiting in line to board, meanwhile I just take my sweet time being one of the last people to go on the plane. The only downside is having to put my hand carry bags in the over head compartments while everyone is looking at me, lol."
weightwatchers,fba1yyv,t1_fb9bw48,1576660256.0,"Thanks, that actually means a lot to me. I am trying to find my way out of this negative cycle honestly, I am having a little bit of a hard time though. Thanks again for your kind words and for the tips. I am going to do my best to take it one step at a time and recover from this low point in my life."
weightwatchers,fba1ugy,t1_fb9cm69,1576660070.0,"I don't have a lot of endurance so that is something that I need to work on if I want to start running.

vegan,fb9z1m5,t1_fb9edes,1576656047.0,ah! oh wow. I don't know why I never thought of making vegan versions of the food. I'm going to do more research and try it out. Hopefully I will do a good job. Thanks!
vegan,fb9yzfm,t1_fb9dh4f,1576655960.0,"you have a valid point, I think it is better to do a whole food plant based diet. I just need to look up more recipes and do more research. thank you! I'm definitely going to take a look at forks over knives."
weightwatchers,fb9b6gh,t1_fb9ai7e,1576634065.0,"Actually, thinking about it I haven’t found any other positive ways to channel my emotions. I should start working out and focusing my energy on there, but then I get lazy and unmotivated. I need to change my way of thinking, and just do something that is good for myself rather than something that will hurt me in the long run. 

I seriously need to muster the will power to act on doing the things to help me feel better. 
All I am doing now is just force myself to go to school, eat unhealthy food, or go out for drinks with my friends.. which isn’t really good."
