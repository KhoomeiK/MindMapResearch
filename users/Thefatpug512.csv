China_Flu,ffft6tn,t1_fffiac6,1579891263.0,They said they would reconvene in ten days prior to their last announcement which was yesterday unless there are significant changes to warrant a sooner announcement.
HongKong,ffdx2fy,t1_ffdomx6,1579831065.0,There’s definitely much deadlier viruses to spread if that was their intention. I mean as of now(granted it could change) the flu has a higher mortality rate. The news is hyping it.
puppy101,ffdvv4a,t1_ff2t7al,1579830210.0,Just be careful it could get expensive if they don’t come back and decide to go on a rampage with the treats and toys

alcoholism,ff8fc5q,t1_ff759np,1579676035.0,It was actually probably similar to what you are drinking now that I think about it. I’d drink anywhere from a bottle to two bottles of wine. Or half a bottle of hard alc. but towards the end of my drinking I stayed away from hard alc.
talesfromcallcenters,ff71v8i,t3_erwd3a,1579639460.0,Your managers an asshole and that’s how you end up losing customers for life. If someone said that to me after losing my parent I would definitely not be ever using their service again.
alcoholism,ff6u8aq,t3_eribr1,1579634987.0,I’m not a doctor but I drank more than you and didn’t have seizures. Also I would do the same where I would only drink at night. I think that helps limit the risk since you aren’t drinking 24/7 but like I said I’m not a doctor and everyone’s different.
alcoholism,ff6pbpf,t3_erlf2r,1579632063.0,If it makes you feel a little better I once peed on my friends parents couch.... I imagine that’s harder to clean then the bed. I’m sober now and it’s so much better. If you have a mental illness I feel like any sort of substance messes with you more than the average person.
alcoholism,ff6cnry,t1_ff6bz5x,1579624300.0,It concerns me that she would even think it’s ok to ask you. Granted I don’t know you guys and there can be more to it then what I’m seeing from a post on the internet but it’s just throwing up some red flags for me.
Crystals,ff5g2tn,t1_ff56wnh,1579591321.0,Not saying you are wrong but curious to how you can tell so I can learn to spot the differences myself.
MealPrepSunday,ff248oi,t1_ff22va9,1579493373.0,Maybe they don’t like to freeze it and food can get kinda sketchy on day 5

zyramains,feze3p0,t1_fexkhp1,1579456411.0,Im a diamond zyra otp. I do t have an issue playing her mid. You won’t see it done in the LCS but it definitely works in solo que if you know zyra well. I’m forgetting the guys name but there’s a masters player who one tricks zyra mid.
AmItheAsshole,feyeq2m,t1_fex7q0u,1579444480.0,I think it’s a lot harder to cut your parents out of your life even if you disagree with their beliefs then people think it is
AmItheAsshole,feyekvk,t3_eqtevd,1579444422.0,Nah but more towards NTA. I think your sister was too young and brainwashed to really understand the consequences of her actions and now that she’s gotten older she feels bad and has been able to separate herself from her parents way of thinking. If you can I would try to forgive her but I understand how that might be impossible.
leagueoflegends,fes7ztj,t3_eqfo7g,1579362337.0,Tbh I don’t they had the time or desire to feed the amount of games it would take to get that mmr. Can guarantee they just bought a low rank account with shitty mmr.

Cosmetology,fehrx4k,t3_ep5uwk,1579122667.0,"In my experience you are likely to make more or the same as a waitress/ bartender except you don’t have to pay money to go to school and it’s not as hard on the body and you deal with the same annoying people except you can distance yourself from them easier as a server. You also aren’t exposed to toxic chemicals regularly with no protective gear because of appearances. After five years I’m going back to college to get a better career. 

Edit: you also deal with cool people just saying."
AmItheAsshole,fe350fu,t3_enopnj,1578845987.0,"I get most people are disagreeing but as someone who works in the field ...YTA if you tip them less because they raise their prices. Also we will remember you. At my place I have no control over the prices and my income is based mostly on tips when people
Short me because of something out of my control I’m really bummed. It’s common for the owners to raise the price every year. Also if they do have control over it a lot Of time they are raising it because the rent on their station was raised."
AmItheAsshole,fe33g0l,t3_enotpt,1578845547.0,"I can see how she would be upset if you refuse to ever make things she likes but she makes food for you. You can easily still make chicken and then make a vegetarian option as well. It’s not that hard to learn how to cook it and can be fun as well. Check out the app tasty they have lots of cool recipes and show you how to make things with videos and written instructions. 

I’m gonna hold off judgement even though I think it’s possible either one of
You could be the asshole and say nah"
dogs,fdzsbgh,t1_fdrm6ku,1578794628.0,Or she could just keep her dog separated from her child while they search for a rescue... it’s not that hard.
dogs,fdzs4h5,t1_fdrz9yg,1578794498.0,No pitbulls commonly suffer from skin problems that are completely treatable. Maybe I’m biased because the Pitbull we adopted from piece of shit owners was covered in painful patches when we got her. Also they decided to stop feeding her. Anyways they told us the same thing that oh there’s nothing that can be done . That was not true at all it just takes effort to get it under control. You have to regularly bathe them and regularly give them allergy medication.  I’ll agree that the aggression towards the child is serious but What op is saying about it being untreatable and their dog being in pain is rubbing me the wrong way.
dogs,fdzrtlv,t1_fdrgsdc,1578794306.0,"Idk man seems like op is making excuses to justify it. I get the dog should not be with a baby but what she is speaking of is a very common problem for pitbulls and if you bathe them regularly as well as give them allergy medication/ shots it takes a lot of effort but it’s treatable. She acts like this is some incurable
Disease but in reality it’s treatable if you put in the work."
unpopularopinion,fdze94q,t1_fdxz33f,1578789398.0,"Yeah my coworkers are from the Middle East and they say it’s normal to have parties celebrating circumcision. As far as I know it’s not customary in the us to throw parties celebrating it.  

Although I would definitely agree its not a big deal to not be circumcised and it’s strange how the us encourages it."

insaneparents,fdsogfd,t1_fds6099,1578705889.0,They don’t really seem narcissistic (granted it’s hard to tell from this small exchange) they do however seem to have a severe anxiety disorder
AmItheAsshole,fdsdjsv,t1_fdqwq92,1578700195.0,NTA Also it’s even sadder and speaks to their shitty character that once they find out your deaf they lose interest...
AstralProjection,fdrmbnx,t1_fdpxjex,1578686518.0,"Exactly that was me. I know my parents were just trying to build up my confidence but unfortunately it made me believe that if I didn’t know something right away it was just too difficult a concept for me. I know now that is an extremely flawed way of thinking, but hey teenagers don’t always think the smartest things. It worked out in the long run, I’m now a basically a straight A student in college it just took me a little longer (I’m 25 now) to realize the key to being successful isn’t all natural talent and a lot of it is work ethic.Also my parents are great and incredibly supporting I don’t blame them for my stupid teenage brains."
AstralProjection,fdopuh5,t1_fdok9wu,1578610177.0,"Awesome! It’s definitely hard to balance everything, but I think it’s great you have her explore her gifts as well."
SampleSize,fdoknvl,t1_fdo0rxb,1578607071.0,While that is common and how I tend to view it as well sometimes it is different and in professional surveys they tend to clarify exactly which is the worst and best.
AstralProjection,fdok2rg,t1_fdni7ox,1578606733.0,Speaking from experience try to stress the importance of hard work and less on how special she is. While she definitely does sound like a special child when kids believe that they are naturally gifted they tend to give up easier when they face challenges later in life.

AmItheAsshole,fcv3rnt,t3_eizcvf,1577994041.0,"NTA because they aren’t entitled to having a babysitter. However, that is a lot to charge for babysitting and you probably would of been better off explaining you don’t have the time."
AskReddit,fcsz1gk,t1_fcng3y4,1577928679.0,My best guess why he chose to tell you over someone he’s more close to was out of respect to his sons privacy. Good on you for sticking up for your employee
IAmA,fcnnou2,t1_fcnfbta,1577814944.0,Did you tell them later on that you were present for that. I think it would seriously make them reconsider how they act with patients.

hairstylist,fcilge6,t1_fcii8nj,1577664547.0,"That’s permanent hair color so honestly at this point your gonna need to highlight it to get back to normal which I strongly suggest not doing yourself. Color will not lift color so going back over it with a lighter shade of color will not work or will not lift evenly which is just going to create a bigger problem. It will still probably fade over time but it will take longer. I don’t know how much darker you went. If you went super dark it may take several sessions to get back to how it was.

You can try a color remover but they do not always work and can sometimes be damaging"
hairstylist,fcicrkd,t3_ehd004,1577660623.0,Depends on if you toned your hair with an actual toner or did you use permanent color? What product did you use? If it was toner it will fade out over several washes. Use hot water and shampoo with sulfates in it. You can even use dish soap for one wash.
alcoholism,fcheloz,t1_fcfvi5g,1577649763.0,"I’m not sure if your a troll account meant to spark a reaction, but if you are for real you are lacking in self reflection and fail to own up to your choices. Do some soul searching and stop blaming others. Take responsibility for your actions and forgive yourself after realizing how you were acting and you will likely find happiness. Stop making excuses and blaming others. In life people will have horrible circumstances happen to them but how you choose to react to them make a huge difference."
UCI,fc9g8rn,t1_fc76746,1577552229.0,Of course there’s still hope. I use to not care much about school and was put on academic probation. My mindset changed and I’m now an A student who gets an occasional B. Go talk to a counselor and see what resources there are for you.
dogs,fc6segb,t1_fc6c45x,1577488285.0,"I think it’s better a dog gets rescued from a shelter and has several good years of life rather than put down in a shelter because someone does not want to get a dog because they can not afford an expensive surgery in the event something bad happens to the dog. However, I do agree people should not buy puppies if they can not afford expensive surgeries."
malehairadvice,fc5svmj,t1_fc4lceg,1577465122.0,"Hard to say for certain because I can only see the top part of your face but I’m not too fond of the shorter one. However, I’m someone who prefers longer hair so I might be a bit biased."
AmItheAsshole,fc4pw3i,t1_fc3htmd,1577424173.0,Ops daughter is bipolar though. Anti depressants are not suitable for people with bipolar disorder because they cause manic episodes. Unfortunately the drugs for bipolar disorder tend to have some pretty bad side effects which is why it’s harder for bipolar people to want to take their meds. It’s not uncommon to gain 80 lbs with bipolar meds.
