Amberfossil,fdo15xs,t3_em51qd,1578596982.0,"So last time, we saw two dinosaur tails with feathers, where we learned that they were most likely flightless judging from the structure of the said feathers.  
This time, on the other hand, according to the Nat Geo article, the feathers are seemingly more similar to modern birds. They didn't really specify the exact species of the specimen, but we can probably hypothesize that this comes from prehistoric birds rather than dinosaurs or their direct descendants.   
Am I right?"
offmychest,fdnc0pv,t1_fdn6hg8,1578582530.0,"Alright, that's fair.

Looking at the two posts, I hypothesize that it might depend on what age your children are. I believe you're right that young (especially pre-teen) children are not capable of learning to think for themselves. However, that may not be the case when they gain the ability to start to question the validity of what adults say to them. For example, the child may statt to feel discomfort when the parent or guardian tell him or her to become a doctor, because he or her subconsciously know that that career does not necessarily fit his or her mindset. This is usually around the time when the child becomes a teenager and starts to show signs of irrational  rebelliousness towards people around him or her.

I am not a parent, but as someone who have ""grown out"" of the teenage years in the last 5 years, this is how I feel reflecting back on my life and how I was raised.

What do you think?"
