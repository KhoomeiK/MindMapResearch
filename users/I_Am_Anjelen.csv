AskScienceFiction,ffcqw1k,t3_esvzsc,1579805378.0,"Wookiepedia article [on Lekku](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lekku/Legends) and the Togruta's (Ahsoka's species) [Montrals.](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Montral/Legends)

The prehensile lekku protruded down the back of the skull and contained part of a Twi'lek's brain. A Twi'lek's braintails served many purposes in their daily lives and culture, storing fat and other qualities. The Twi'lek's native language of Twi'leki was spoken using a combination of words and subtle movements of the lekku.

A Twi'lek's brain tails were highly sensitive, and grabbing them forcefully was so painful that it could easily incapacitate almost any Twi'lek. 

Since the top portion of the lekku near the head housed parts of a Twi'lek's brain, damage to this part of the brain tails also caused lasting brain damage, since the tissue within governed basic motor functions, as well as housing repressed subconscious memories.

Togrutas also sported head-tails. This species, however, had three (rarely four) head tails, the two at the side of the head and one from the lower-back of the skull. The stripes on their lekku would become more or less vibrant according to their emotions such as getting embarrassed. Togrutans' native language of Togruti was similar to Twi'leki in the fact that both languages involved the use of the head-tails.

Combined with their head-tails, Togrutans also had two hollow montrals which could ultrasonically detect objects. These montrals possessed a form of passive echolocation by means of their hollow montrals which allowed them to sense the proximity and movement of physical objects around them. Along with their three head-tails, they did not grow fully until adolescence. A Togruta's head-tails were generally longer than a Twi'lek's and were draped forward due to the third head-tail in the back."

unpopularopinion,fezutqe,t1_fezrrz9,1579461946.0,"If anything the reverse is true for me. Cigarettes, due to being stored bone-dry after the melange is applied to them, burn up faster and aren't nearly as satisfying as rolling good, dark rolling tobacco. 

I can go through a pack of 20 cigarettes in a day, half a day if I don't pay attention. A 50g pack of tobacco lasts me a week. 

This may sound counterintuitive, but perhaps try a more expensive, european brand of rolling tobacco, such as Van Nelle Zwaar?"
unpopularopinion,feylalr,t1_fey58yc,1579447106.0,"American rolling tobacco and European rolling tobacco is greatly different, though - no offence, but every pack of rolling tobacco I've bought when I was in the States contained only bone-dry chaff that every smoker I've ever known in Europe would refer to as 'crumb' and more than likely throw out at the end of their pack.

Because European-styled rolling tobacco tends to come with an infusion and is supposed to feel slightly damp to the touch, pre-rolling European-style tobacco is an actual sin. It messes with the flavor and throat-feel to the point where I'll personally just throw out a rollie if I forgot about it and left it out for longer than ten-fifteen minutes. 

I can hand-roll a cig in about 15 seconds and get about 80-100 rollies out of a 50 gram pack of rolling tobacco the price of a 20-pack of cigarettes. That's a  no-brainer as far as I'm concerned..."

At app 0, Nosferatu aren't just 'ugly', they are _legendarily_ ugly. They are the kind of ugly that doesn't get revolted reactions from mortals, their simple appearance can cause heart attacks and aneurysms. A weak-willed human being might look upon a Nosferatu and simply keel over dead from the shock - or outright ignore their existence as an impossibility.

They are _that_ impossibly ugly.

Looking directly at a Nosferatu is like having acid poured into your eyes while someone pounds nails through your ears via the back of your skull. It isn't just you going ""Damn, that's ugly!"" - it's you having an experience of something impossible, something that will cause a visceral reaction. Nosferatu cannot coexist with humans because humans will react with an atavistic flight-or-fight response to the mere _sight_ of them. Ramble on I could, but I couldn't drive this point home deep enough. 

Honestly, I personally feel that doing that kind of ""damage"" through Flescrafting would take at the very least a _heavy_ measure of artistry. It's not a matter of squelching some flesh this way and that. To create an abomination of that scope takes hours, if not nights of careful, pre-planned, _exquisite_ work.

>The version closest to the biblical story of Noah, as well as its most likely source, is that of Utnapishtim in the Epic of Gilgamesh. The most complete text of Utnapishtim's story is a clay tablet dating from the 7th century BCE, but fragments of the story have been found from as far back as the 19th century BCE. The last known version of the Mesopotamian flood story was written in Greek in the 3rd century BCE by a Babylonian priest named Berossus. From the fragments that survive, it seems little changed from the versions of two thousand years before.

We can tell by written record as much as geological record the physical environment of the pre-flood area in [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Mesopotamia). It would not have supported redwood-sized tree growth.

> Preflood conditions and postflood conditions are totally different. Where do you think coal comes from?

First of all, where do your base your supposition of pre- and post-flood conditions on? Secondly, _how_ were conditions different? For the love of all that is theorycraft, man, _show me the fruits of your labors_. 

Where do _I_ think Coal comes from? Well, I hold to the scientific explanation. As per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal)- 
> Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams. Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements; chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal _by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years_. Vast deposits of coal originates in former wetlands—called coal forests—that covered much of the Earth's tropical land areas during the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) and Permian times.

and

>Coalification starts with dead plant matter decaying into peat. Then over millions of years the heat and pressure of deep burial causes the loss of water, methane and carbon dioxide and an increase in the proportion of carbon.Thus first [lignite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignite) (also called ""brown coal""), then [sub-bituminous coal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-bituminous_coal), [bituminous coal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bituminous_coal), and lastly [anthracite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthracite) (also called ""hard coal"" or ""black coal"") may be formed.

and 

> The wide, shallow seas of the [Carboniferous Period](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboniferous) provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods. The exception is the coal gap in the [Permian–Triassic extinction event](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event), where coal is rare. Coal is known from Precambrian strata, which predate land plants—this coal is presumed to have originated from residues of algae.

Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera...

>""Ham"" was literally the first word in the video, and the video continues to explain it is a reaction to Ken Ham reacting about things. I am sorry if I am too lazy to wade through ad hominem to find any information that addresses the bible account. If you want to bring something up, write it here.

And this is how I know you haven't been bothering to so much as watch these videos with anything other than superfluous criticism. Thank you for providing me with that insight.

However.

Yes, 'Ham' is the first word in the video, as it is the standard introduction tune of the series this video comes out of, as is the explanation that it is a reaction to Ken Ham reacting about things. If you _had_ bothered to look deeper into the series, you would know that Paulogia makes a _point_ of reacting to the various things he does in as respectful a, if perhaps whimsical, tone as the claims warrant. 

While such can't always be said for his guests, and the interplay that this causes is often the source of jocularity, I have yet to find a single ad-hominem in these videos that isn't also caused by such jocularity, and in the spirit of jocularity.

Paulogia goes out of his way to express, where possible and warranted, respect for the views of Ham and his ilk, while simultaneously providing entertainment through the interplay of him and his guests. This happens. The Hovinds, Ham and their assorted entourage often speak in the same voice but make no effort of respect _at all_ and moreover often outright maliciously dismiss anything they can't twist and turn to suit their needs. Keep that ad-hominem in mind, though, because I'll return to it later.

> Well for a start, it makes the same mistake that you do, which is to allege the window in the ark was square, which I have already shown you to be an unfounded assumption.

So - based upon a single fragment of evidence you do not like, you dismiss the entire body ?

You know what? I've taken some time to reflect on our previous conversations and I've come tot the conclusion that you are, indeed, the troll I've suspected you to be. I'll admit, you've been clever about it, but if you had been truly trying to debate me you would have shown a measure of _intelligence_.

And I have yet to see _any_ of that. You attempt to _prove_ but refuse to _debate_. You attempt to refute, but refuse to show evidence. You make no effort whatsoever at actually saying anything of consequence or content and finally, based on what you just said - if you don't like it, you ignore it.

This is not a debate on equal footing. This is you, wasting my time with zero-effort, copy-pasted refusal to consider the points that are being made - at least insofar as you cannot outright dismiss them, claim them incorrect or simply refuse to acknowledge them. And as such - I've concluded that this debate with you has taken up too much of my free time and energy so far already.

As far as I am concerned, you needn't reply to this message at all; there is no intelligent debate here, and as such I shall consider this conversation terminated.

However; returning to that ad-hominem? I'll give you _my_ opinion on the the Hovinds, Ham and their entourage.

They seem by all evidence to go out of their way to mislead, straw-man and stonewall arguments, actively seek to discourage anyone from seeking out information that doesn't fit their narrative to the point of outright deception and drown everything else in language pedantically constructed to support that narrative and _only_ that narrative through the fallacious re-definition of known concepts across the spectrum of science, history, physics and logic. 

In my opinion it is their specific way of 'teaching', 'thinking' and their entire mindset which is holding back the advance of science and in places actively seeks to undo it to the point where those who _have_ studied science at reputable schoos, have outright _admitted_ to only going through the motions of honest study so as to have a degree they could use as a smoke screen, and the point of falling to ad-hominem, reductio ad absurdum, special pleading, straw manning and _any amount_ of [logical fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/system/App/HomepageRow/images/000/000/002/original/poster.jpg) and in the mean time they are grabbing by the throat any and all opportunity to make any small amount of money whatsoever, and twist that throat to within an inch of breaking so as to wring just that extra penny from it without any regard whatsoever for the life they are choking out of their respective congretations, who they treat in exactly such a way as to _keep_ them isolated, misinformed, illogical and simply afraid to step out of lock with those around them.

It is my honest opinion that Ham, the Hovinds and their entourage form a cult of devious, actively malignant miscreants making money over the backs of their _victims_ - and I count as victim anyone, willing or not, who falls for their particular schemes.

In short, if I were to express my outright distaste for Ham, the Hovinds and their entourage in as strong terms as I would _like_ to be, I would be expressing myself in a tone of outrage at their willful and _malicious_, outright _abuse_ of every single person in their congregation and, if it were my decision, they would be jailed for what _I_ consider to be outright crimes against truth, knowledge, science and their advancement, and again for their willful taking advantage of the religious fervor of their congregation they abuse, condescend and patronize in the worst possible way possible while remaining a facade of teachers and preachers to further their own agenda and none _but_ their own, to the detriment of _literally everything else in the world_."
DebateAnAtheist,fcmou45,t1_fbj74l3,1577784840.0,"Okay. Outright dismissing every single thing you say that's quoted from the bible as truth - because, and say it with me kids; ""You cannot use a biased source as proof of the veracity of that source.""

However, I would like to go into a _few_ things. In particular your use of the sentence ""And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth..."" to supposedly prove that everyone and everything was friendly up to this point...

This is not in any way shape or form something I could take away from that particular sentence. All it tells me that ""The fear of you and the dread of you"" shall exist _from that point on_. It says nothing of anything that happened _prior_. Try again.

> Perfect things can become corrupted, in the same a reprint of a perfect book can introduce errors. Or gamma rays can introduce flaws into a perfect diamond.

A diamond can possibly have flaws introduced to it, yes. And a reprinted book that gets reprinted incorrectly is most likely due to human error. Neither of these things prove your point. Quite the opposite, in fact.

Neither of these can exist perfect to begin with. Perfection _does not exist_. A perfect item, or perfect state, can only exist in a perfect stasis. Such is the nature of physical perfection, because the very existence of entropy and change rules out the existence of a perfect state. For something to be perfect, entropy may _by definition_ not have any effect whatsoever on it.

> So your math is out by a factor of 2, that's no a large amount given the guesswork of your numbers.

Honestly, is it? Because it seems that [10x5x5] foot is indeed, \[[two hundred fifty cubic foot](https://i.imgur.com/YZCli4G.png)\] and basic arithmetic puts twelve thousand times two hundred and fifty at three million. I haven't been able to be _arsed_ to do most of the math from there.

> Also the cubit used in the ark was a royal cubit of 20.6"". Which means you underestimate the volume of the ark by 50%.

Is _that_ how the Imperial system works? I've always been under the impression that two cubic inches are less than fifty percent of eighteen cubic inches. Please, enlighten me and show me your math, as I've shown you mine, incorrect as it may have been.

Still. Anyone with a lick of sense can tell you that holding fourteen thousand animals in a box _either_ size for forty days, as a largely closed system with regards to freedom of movement, space of motion, food, water, waste and the management of the previous three by a group of roughly a dozen people without the use of technology more advanced than dumbwaiters and wheelbarrows _just isn't going to happen_. Even if I -were- not to bring in the required differences in engineering between a box-shaped building and a boat built to withstand [the forces of a presumed Great Flood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN7dNQSbmjs).

Regardless of _how_ friendly these animals are _or_ the laughable claim that all creatures were vegetarians at the time.

That's just not how nature works, how physics works, how labor works, and how infrastructure works.

But I welcome you to prove me wrong by providing evidence of the contrary. Show me a closed-system environment in which a dozen people can keep alive a population of fourteen thousand baby animals for forty days. I'll _even_ allow your claim of a window that should have sunk the ark in the statement 

> The window was most likely all the way around the top of the ark, one cubit high. The bible does not say anything about it being square."" 

Which would have been a structural _nightmare_ to create on a boat that size.

> But if what you are saying, is that God cannot be true, because the Egyptians could not have had wagons, even though we know they somehow built giant pyramids, then there is more hope of a fool than of you.

I have made no claims as to the existence of God in this particular thread? I can't find any upon re-reading it. We're talking about the _Bible_ here. So to get the matter of the existence of God out of the way, let me quote something I've said in another thread a few days ago; 

> Why would I seek to defy or deny what simply isn't there ?

> As per dictionaries and, for instance, Wikipedia, [Atheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism) is defined as ""Disbelief or the lack of belief in a God or Gods.""

> Funny enough, Merriam-Webster also refers to it as ""a philosophical or religious position characterized by disbelief in the existence of a god or any gods.""

> Which is ... Honestly, slightly insulting.

> I _personally_ define my Atheism as rendering the existence of a God a complete non-issue. I have no consideration for or against the existence of a God or diety - I simply have not found any reason to consider that a dietic entity of any nature exists, and therefore find no reason to question the assumption that they do not exist. Full stop.

And since we're on the topic of interpreting my words - I have not said that trees were _not_ available. I have said in an admitted simplification of  my understanding of the Egyptian economy at the time that, and I quote, Both wagon and draft animals are commodities that were simply not availabe to the vast, vast majority of the population of Egypt.
> Have I mentioned the famine stele that confirms the biblical account of the seven years famine?

Yes, _about_ [that stele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine_Stela); 

""More recent investigations have shown that a seven-year famine was a motif common to nearly all cultures of the Near East: a Mesopotamian legend also speaks of a seven-year-famine and in the well known Gilgamesh-Epos the god Anu gives a prophecy about a famine for seven years. Another Egyptian tale about a long-lasting drought appears in the so-called “Book of the Temple”, translated by German Demotist Joachim Friedrich Quack. The ancient text reports about king Neferkasokar (late 2nd dynasty), who faces a seven-year-famine during his reign.""

I remain unconvinced.

> Most of the trees were buried in a cataclysmic flood.

There is no proof for that _whatsoever_ outside of myth. But let's entertain the notion for a moment.

We would have _evidence_ of the existence of these incredibly vast trees. We do not. Even the existent [redwood forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_sempervirens) offer no such evidence simply because of their environmental requirements - and in fact make it preposterous by those very requirements to assume that they _did_ exist in the way that you describe.

Moreover, we have knowledge of the environmental record of the area your story takes place in, at the time your story takes place. As per again the [Wikipedia article on Noah's ark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark) - 

>For well over a century scholars have recognised that the Bible's story of Noah's ark is based on older Mesopotamian models. Because all these flood stories deal with events that allegedly happened at the dawn of history, they give the impression that the myths themselves must come from very primitive origins, but the myth of the global flood that destroys all life only begins to appear in the Old Babylonian period (20th–16th centuries BCE). The reasons for this emergence of the typical Mesopotamian flood myth may have been bound up with the specific circumstances of the end of the Third Dynasty of Ur around 2004 BCE and the restoration of order by the First Dynasty of Isin.
