It wouldn't have changed the plot while also nailing in what happens to bravado and superficial honor in that world.

The voice over in combination with the cheesy mountain top fight that took forevor and was like no friggin contest and that idiot who was walking to the egg was the only dude that got blasted.

The only problem with the dragon episode was the part with the dragon. The rest of it was seriously awesome."

The fact that we celebrate this man to assuage our racist guilt in this country is there very tool that keeps the people down he fought for. Capitalism only works in an environment where wealth is distributed, and our capitalism is broken.

It was just one of those things where a lot of people were like, ""WTF?"", then more important things happened and it was such a hot air bullshit thing to begin with it was dismissed out of hand.
