Stims,ff65m4y,t3_ertzcv,1579619696.0,"Amph is better than coke, but you have to do a lot of it. It’s basically just a lot weaker , white powdery meth. It’s just all around not as good in every single category. Except like one, it is less caustic on your sinuses. But you gotta snort like 10x more of it for a weaker shorter duration , less sexually boosting drug. 

Adderall is the best in my opinion but its so damn expensive."

Stims,ff4k770,t3_er46tj,1579565601.0,"Meth has maybe the worst stigma of all the drugs . Even heroin has some chic/hipster appeal, you got John Travolta shooting up some exotic heroin in Pulp Fiction, lots of beloved celebs and musicians OD'd on H... Imagine how much meth has actually accomplished paired with the millions of people using it in secret. Not many authors, musicians, artists, actors, scientists, engineers, etc,  are going to shout out Meth, or really even subtly nod to it in lyrics. Because if you do meth you only have one pathway that is your destiny... you will become a sketchy hollow faced skeleton of a person that wanders around in slums of a city like an NPC of Fallout 2. sleeping on a soiled blanket inside a burnt out house shared with other people who tried meth, and you will eat rats you catch with your bare hands, and do unspeakable sexual acts on satanic men who grow more and more sadistic and harder to satisfy with each miserable day that passes"
AskReddit,ff2troc,t3_eqzdrn,1579523830.0,"I was getting close, I could feel the tingling pressure rising as I stared hypnotized by a 4 second animated .gif playing on loop (about 8 frames total) on a glowing CRT monitor just inches from my face as I sat in the computer chair hunched over my dad’s wood-pattern particle board desk with my jeans undone and pulled down almost to my knees. The .gif was from an uncredited movie of a salacious nature, and in frame were a woman’s upper body, her large, round breasts bounced up and down and then up again as the rest of her body perhaps played hopscotch or rode a pogo stick, it was impossible to know for sure. My 14 year old stealthy wank sesh on the ol' family Packard Bell x386 PC had almost concluded successfully without any signs of trouble or threats of necessitating an early abort— when Mom barges through the *very* conspicuously almost-fully-closed hallway door with the wholesome innocence of a mom who is oblivious to such straightforward warning signals left by her male counterparts; She still walks with the carelessness of a young mother that hasn't yet been throttled with the horror of stumbling upon one of her sons hunched over like a dog taking a shit, curiously polishing something vigorously in his lap with both hands…

Today I am that son who is furiously polishing, and I was just wrapping up the final strokes of my polishing job. Spurts of white wax began squirting into the air from the blowhole atop the helmet of my swollen red dick head, and just as I begin to relish in a job well done and reap the reward of that sweet wave of euphoria as it comes crashing against the beach and right as its foamy edges rush towards my toes and I await it’s embrace, my fantasy is fucking shattered as I hear movement— the door has opened, and my mom strolls carelessly round the corner.

Everything had slowed to a crawl, I saw her crest the edge of the wall slowly, her inviting, friendly face appearing like the moon over the horizon. She was already smiling before she rounded the corner, and I watched as her face melted as she began to understand what she had just walked into. Ropes of jizm were still on an upward projection from my cock as she slowed her merry stroll into the computer room and recoiled in disgust as a second, thicker pump of jizz laucnhed out of my dick hole.  I attempted to ‘cap’ the hole of my cock with the palm of myhand just as another spurt erupted, and I shielded my mom’s view as best I could with the other as I turned my back and frantically scrambled “OK MOM!” before she had the chance to internalize the situation or say a word at all.

My mom muttered “dinner is ready” as she turned on her heel, her face drained of blood and her steps were quick and silent as she retreated from the scene.

I was left trembling,  my pants and pubic hair glazed, my heart pounding in my chest.

I had just busted a nut in front of my mom. I did not answer the call for dinner, instead electing to eat alone in my room that night, sneaking down and stealing some graham crackers from the pantry.

I would never speak to my mother again.

Until the next day. In the morning, when I complained that we were out of milk.

We never spoke a word about what transpired ."

The only bombing that hit multiple people was when he tried to bomb an American Airlines plane ""injuring"" 12 people (smoke inhalation), but the bomb did not actually detonate.

 I am a hammock camper and I was out solo in the big mountains of North Arizona .. it's like really tall skinny spruce trees up there on red Rock , there's really very little soil up there I have no idea how those trees grow so big or where the roots even go because everything is stone .. but anyways it was a beautiful day and I set up in a spot I thought was ideal. Two big healthy spruces and my hammock is basically in an opening in the forest and I have clear sky above me. Sun goes down I'm chilling looking up at the stars... Then the wind picks up. Like it realllly picks up out of nowhere it's gusting like 40mph. These spruce trees that weren't even on my radar are now very real threat to me, rocking back and forth in this wind so hard the tops must have been moving 15 - 20 yards up at the tops. And I'm right in the path of this super tall skinny giant , rocking backkkk and forthhhh , creaking and just threatening to come down and kill me at any moment. I do not scare easily.. I go out into the wilderness alone for multiple days .. but this situation was truly terrifying. But it was too dark and too cold for me to move everything , I wouldn't even know where to go, I couldn't just wander off in the dark in 20 degree weather to find what? A place where there’s no trees for 80 feet in all directions ?.. I was committed. So I just laid there watching these trees swaying like crazy above me and had to just accept that I was helpless and hope that if a tree did fall on me it just smashed me and I didn't get a fate worse than a quick death...  A long night , that was."

It would be like getting hit by a giant with a louiseville slugger.

this kind of shit is super dangerous for people who ride ATV's out in the woods , give it enough time and some branch is going to come pop up through that wide open window space and stab you like it's Mel Gibson in Bravehart yelling ""HOLD"". Or you'll just rattle a tree and shake some dead branch free and it will fall down and  crush you."
