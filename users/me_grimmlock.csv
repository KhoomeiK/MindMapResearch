My spine in good I lift weights, hike, bike etc. pretty active with no issues besides this lame back muscle issue that happens a few times a year. 

Just seeing if anyone here might have other advice. 

Happened last night. Went to the gym worked shoulders and trapezius along with abs and cardio, felt great. Then relaxing at home in a recliner in the evening, I get up BAM!  Low back right side pain. WTF!  Popped a muscle relaxed and iced it, woke me up several times last night, turning over or getting up to take a leak, hella pain and stiffness in that area. This morning it‚Äôs 90% gone. Iced it a little more but it‚Äôs pretty much gone. 

Want to hit the gym and do biceps abs back today but might stick to cardio just 
to avoid reinjuring it."
