highrollersdnd,feyu94k,t1_feyquyt,1579450590.0,"Oh, got it now. I understand what you mean. 

That can be a little more complicated. I'll direct you to one episode that I like very much. It is basically the start of a new ""arc"" in the story. 

Try [Campaign 2: Aerois, Ep 27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtqwZtDYXI8&list=PLHv5CBoZYv4X5NpzLQKKC6loNz2ZZYyyz&index=28&t=0s)

As I said, it is the beginning of a new arc in the story, and it is a damn good one. Try this one and the following, maybe. See if it is something you'd like."
highrollersdnd,feyltyr,t1_feygp8d,1579447328.0,"The YouTube channel is ""HighRollers DnD"". Hulmes (the DM) and the players have played quite a bit of D&D 5e over there. They're pretty damn entertaining, and the praise of Hulmes bing a great DM isn't undeserved, IMHO. I just don't like this whole ""the best DM"" thing. 

Now, they have quite the amount of hours of videos in there. You could try watching one of the ""short campaigns"" that run for a few episodes, instead of watching Campaign 1: Lighfall (that has around 100 episodes), or Campaign 2: Aeroies (that will just have its 57th episode today IIRC). 

In the end, the YouTube channel has enough hours of content for you to decide if you like the gang or not."

He literally said that if our group (6 players, with one of them being TN) would start a fight with a group of 5 NPCs, the TN would stay out of the fight (5v5); then if we'd kill one of the NPCs (5v4), the TN would harm one of us to make the fight even (4v4); or if the NPCs had one of us down (4v5), only then he'd start fighting (5v5).
