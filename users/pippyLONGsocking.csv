AskAnAmerican,fe7nvu6,t3_enw14u,1578917206.0,"I'm from the south, went to school and lived up north for a bit and visited the west coast for a bit

The west coast is like a different world. I don't think I saw a single church while I was there (or at least not an obvious one). The south has a lot and the east has some, but west coast, way less.

The cars are smaller, the local food is healthier, and everything feels breezy. It's like going to an artsy cafe but it's everywhere. There are run down areas and people can get snippy and rude and be cagey, though, and some parts of it are alarmingly similar to less progressive subsections of the south. It's a fascinating place"
