misanthropy,ffa9pe8,t1_ffa8qh9,1579730621.0,Yes I know right?! And stupid people wonder why they shoot up schools. Those same people who were bullied. nobody paid attention until that person took matters into their own hands! now I don't condone it but there are some people out there who just can't take the bullying. Some people just let the pain build up until they erupt like a volcano!!
misanthropy,ff9vwn0,t3_esf4rj,1579722665.0,I skipped school a lot because of this. I didn't want to be around these toxic people. The school system sucks! The teachers didn't do nothing to help me. They just ignored my issue. People don't understand the feeling of going to school and seeing that same person who is there to make your life a living hell.
misanthropy,ff34z9e,t1_ff2lz1o,1579533802.0,That didn't make sense at all but ok.
misanthropy,ff34t1s,t1_ff34l9t,1579533683.0,Oh I see lol. I'm black and native american.
misanthropy,ff1m9d4,t1_ff1gxar,1579481513.0,What does my race have to do with it?  Why are you humans so fixated on race?
misanthropy,feyrh2o,t3_eqshgt,1579449732.0,"I have come to the realization that being in a relationship is a waste of time. Love doesn't exist. The purpose you can only have out of a relationship is procreation. If I'm not having kids, I shouldn't be in a relationship. People are fickle. They can love you today and hate you tomorrow. You will never satisfy any person in a relationship. People have an appetite for change."
depression,fewr2qe,t3_env9a0,1579418224.0,"Yes. The only option you have is to kill yourself. Or  become better at playing the game called life. Yes, this is a game we are in. You are a tool for the system. You help keep this thing active. And just like any tool, you will be replaced. Welcome to the beast system..."
socialanxiety,fe6uapi,t3_eo0wt4,1578905299.0,Same here. I like working alone. I hate when society forces you to work with people!
socialanxiety,fe6u2yu,t3_eo16dm,1578905230.0,Sorry to hear that. At least you went. I would be scared to go to an interview lol. I'm just not good at socialising.
NativeAmerican,fe6mfwx,t1_fe6lw1i,1578895900.0,"If I knew the tribe, I wouldn't be here asking lol. I am currently in an indigenous group on Facebook. I posted my pic on there to see what people think. Some say apache native. A native woman in that group said I look 25% native. My Cherokee friend who I met online said I look like a plains native. Perhaps Hopi, lokota or some other tribe."
NativeAmerican,fe6lufq,t1_fe6kalw,1578895267.0,"I believe that my grandfather is the only one who is of mixed blood. Nobody else. Apparently, slanted eyes, nose bridge and high cheekbones were dominate traits. Just by the nose bridge alone tells me that I have North American native blood. People on the northern hemisphere tend to have narrow noses. And Again, people stare at me a lot in public. I do think that I intimidate people. I think it's the piercing eyes. üëÄ"
NativeAmerican,fe6jt61,t1_fe6cwu9,1578893215.0,"Yes I did pointed out my characteristic and compared it lol. You are correct! nobody really talks that way. I like to analyze and research. I look over information and come up with my own conclusion. I'm aware of people who blindly say that they have native blood. These people don't look into things like me. 

I just wanted to see people thoughts on what I look like. ‚ò∫"
NativeAmerican,fe6c349,t1_fe5zlej,1578886641.0,"Well to be honest, I just love my physical appearance lol. I like to look in the mirror and take selfies. I think my look is unique. I just love the way I look. I know I'm probably sounding like a narcissist but ok. üòä"
NativeAmerican,fe5eosm,t1_fe56qjw,1578868507.0,"Thanks for the information. Yes, I know many African Americans claim that they have native blood without really looking in it. However, that is not me. I look into the information and see what others think about my physical features. I know that only few African Americans have native blood. Most have European blood. When I look into the mirror, I see native features. I can't really dig deep unless I know what happened to my grandfather. I'm in the dark on this one. But thanks! üòÅ"
NativeAmerican,fe3lfbc,t1_fe33jn9,1578850345.0,"My mom told me that her father had native blood. I have seen one photo of my grandfather. He does look mixed race. The photo is lost now.
 
My mother hair texture is close to straight. My hair texture is curly when i grow it out. She doesn't have the slanted eyes and narrow nose like me though. I'm the only person in the family with those features."
NativeAmerican,fdsbi4o,t1_fdrujyu,1578698794.0,"Thank you for your thoughts. üòá I'm a spiritual person. I try to live a minimalist lifestyle and walk the path of wisdom. I like to observe and learn.
I'm the only person in my family who thinks like this. I'm quiet and a lone wolf. That's just my nature. Probably has something to do with native blood but who knows. 

People use to make fun of me for having a long nose and small forhead in school. It's rare for a black person to have a narrow nose and small forhead. My Cherokee friend told me that the reason my forhead is small is because of my broad face which is a native trait. I did a lot of research on myself. I wanted to know why I look like this. I notice that I have shovel shape teeth and large earlobes similar to natives. I also have dry earwax which are common in native americans and some Asians. My slanted eyes gives off a piercing stare. some say I look like I'm going to kill someone if they make me mad lol. It's just my face! But I guess looking naturally mean, quiet and 6'2 will make me a physically intimidating person. My native blood is from my grandfather on my mother side. We don't know if he's alive or dead. He is a mystery."
NativeAmerican,fdrhuuv,t1_fdr7g5k,1578684667.0,Interesting. My Cherokee friend told me that I look like a plains native and i might have native blood from Dakota.
NativeAmerican,fdrfif4,t1_fdqybut,1578683781.0,"Sorry but You are delusional. I wouldn't be asking this question if people didn't point out my physical features. Yes, I do have African blood but I obviously have native blood. my physical facial features are more native. That's just genetics. People stare at me a lot in public. I did my research. I have High cheek bones, slanted eyes and a nose bridge. I always wondered where that came from. I also have a broad face and my forehead is small. That is a native american trait."
socialanxiety,fdqlf68,t3_ejqdap,1578669481.0,Same here. I be so embarrassed for the people I see do cringy things on tv or out in public lol. I need to stop thinking like this because it's not me who is doing or saying bad things. It's them.
NativeAmerican,fdqjgrj,t1_fdqfv9o,1578668166.0,"Indeed. One of my Cherokee friends I met online said I have the look of a plains native. Perhaps, Hopi, lokota or another tribe. Other natives said I look apache in a indigenous group on Facebook. I always see people staring at me in public by the way. I guess I have a unique look or something."
