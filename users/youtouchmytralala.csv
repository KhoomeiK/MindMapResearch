Bass,ff404lh,t3_erguyd,1579552642.0,"Yes, the transition should be a fairly easy one technically - especially if you've gained good familiarity with the fretboard. Left hand technique is nearly identical (though spaced differently), if you're not playing playing with a pick right hand technique will take some getting used to.

Learning to groove, improvise and write your own lines on bass may take a bit, but the playing itself should be fairly straightforward."
wholesomememes,ff1i5bz,t1_ff1fmn9,1579479592.0,"Haha okay, thank goodness it's not serious. For a while there it seemed like you thought asking a stranger for ""mouth love"" was a good idea."
wholesomememes,ff1fa8w,t1_ff0zu1b,1579478394.0,"Yeah this. The parents response in this panel is obviously beyond the pale, but it's a huge amount of pressure and stress on parents if they feel society mandates they have to humour their kids at all times. It also probably isn't good for kids to be raised thinking what's interesting to them is interesting to all people at all times.

Though I don't have kids, I have worked a lot of kids sports and recreation programs and I concur with what others have said. Sometimes you need to be direct about needing to talk about or do something else. As tactufully as still gets the message accross, but if the kid knows they're loved by all the other things you do for them I think it should be fine."

comics,feze4h8,t1_fezapje,1579456418.0,"Canada has a pretty good track record for flying large jets as gliders (and I guess a bad record of having enough fuel in their airplanes), here's another incident, this one the longest a jet has ever been flown with all engines out:

comics,feyxzok,t3_eqw5cp,1579451829.0,"This actually sort of happened. When an Air Canada 767 ran out of fuel, it diverted to a military base which unknown to the pilots had been decommissioned and turned into a racing track. They were holding an event at the track that day and people had to run for their lives as this eerily silent wide body jet descended from the heavens and nearly crushed them all.

climbing,felt9ua,t3_epq3g5,1579230384.0,"I mean, I'm sure everyone knows the rules about holds that are out of bounds. I think everyone else in their competition focus just didn't notice the setters had forgot tape. Seems like the judge probably noticed though which is maybe why they gave the answer they did so quickly."

climbing,fdievh8,t3_eljm9f,1578441325.0,"Usually no, start holds are to be controlled when your foot leaves the ground. That said, not all gyms work the same way or have the same ""rules"". Some might mark a problem like this in a special way to indicate this is the way it's intended to be.

In competition lead climbing there are no designated start holds - brain farting on if bouldering has them or not."
climbing,fdf879f,t1_fdd0jk6,1578355564.0,"Are you ever concerned about anything fucky happening with the carabiner with this set up? All that movement in the system and  [this](http://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/13200305300/Fall-on-Rock-Inadequate-Protection-Inadequate-Clothing-and-Equipment-Weather) accident report makes me a bit paranoid. Obviously a high factor fall while lead soloing is different kettle fish, but I feel a bit weird using a standard screw gate in this context."
climbing,fcvudp6,t1_fcufvae,1578010316.0,"I do believe getting outside is a great way to meet generally curious, motivated, interesting people with good priorities and values (some exeptions apply). I was raised in an extended family of sorts with family friends who all met in University outdoor clubs. It was a great enviroment, but all of those people increasingly balanced life priorities against sick outdoor experiences as they got older. I'm sure they were far better off for it."
climbing,fcvtbvv,t1_fcvk65g,1578009635.0,"I agree, and am trying to tack hard in that direction at 32. Wish me luck."

climbing,fcvs6pj,t1_fcupf67,1578008901.0,"I think a huge part of why this doesn't get explored has got got to be survivorship bias. Who is writing the articles, making the movies, selling us the gear, discussing the sport etc? Well, it's people who really did succeed at making outdoor pursuits their life. It's probably a bit tough for them to understand. It's the same sort of story in media generally - it ain't the disenfranchised making the talking points."
climbing,fcucesu,t3_eiymem,1577977697.0,"I'm not at all surprised to see this. A mentor of mine in the climbing industry took his own life last year I believe for similar reasons to what this article mentioned, and I've found myself having to distance myself and look elsewhere for the same reasons.

There is a huge downside of trying to form a durable sense of connectedness  and purpose exclusively through outdoor sports while ignoring the more traditional institutions that typically serve this purpose. If your body can no longer do it, you slowly lose your membership - it's the unfortunate reality. Even if you hang on, chances are people your age won't and forming meaningful connections becomes harder and harser. And if you've gone so far as to orientate your career in that direction, unless you're one of the lucky few, chances are much higher you haven't made enough money to really be on top of your life in a way that you can build something satisfying for yourself.

On the level of personal psychology, chances are if you're the kind of person that lives for the outdoors, you've come from a middle or upper middle class background and you're something of an idealist. You don't make the money you need to match your expectations (sometimes even basic ones), and reconciling yourself to an existence that isn't all that beautiful doesn't come very naturally.

I'd caution anyone who tries to build their life only around climbing and doesn't adjust as life moves on. It seems to make sense when you're young, but that feeling doesn't usually stay. Climbing and the outdoors can be a wonderful pillar in your life, but if it's the only one ... You may be in for a bad time."

climbing,fblzxw7,t3_edwiha,1576974669.0,"What? What am I missing here? Aren't you just stuck with the same problem when you undo the slip knot?

Even if this acutally is a solution, why not just loosen your knot a bit more before your untie? Your way I'm sure makes the yosemite finish even more prone to rolling (which I've had guides tell me has actually resulted accidents, can't find any accident reports to back that up), makes your knot bulkier, instroduces another point for it to get snagged, and overall looks silly."
