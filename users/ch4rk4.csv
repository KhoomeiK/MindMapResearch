A few years ago I read an article about some specific foodstuff that can (when consumed a lot and frequently) add a methyl-group to those regulatory areas in front of genes. This altered the way those regions interacted with the gene and lead to a complete shutdown of a whole gene in one example. Those changes to the DNA are not mutations, but modifications because the coding sequence didn't get changed. The whole thing is summed up as 'epigenetics'. Unfortunately I didn't really follow up and am about 5 years behind. So if you take a look at very new studies I'm sure there is much new information available . Have fun ;-)"
MurderedByWords,ff751ny,t1_ff6j96a,1579641266.0,"you're mixing up genes with dna. and we actually know a lot about it and don't call it junk-dna anymore (scientists didn't even like it in the 60s). the more fitting term would be ""non-coding dna"", which also explains the difference between those parts and the coding ones. the genes are on the coding ones exclusively. but the non-coding ones are very important, too. we know that those parts have a huge impact on the rate of expression of the genes. they can accelerate, slow down, start, or even completely block the genes' expression rates. also many other impacts are well described. but you're correct, many features are not explained yet. fun fact: some decently recent studies found out that those regulatory parts (as explained) can be altered over your lifetime by behaviour, diet and so on. and this information is inheritable! this doesn't really sound stunning at first, but i think it will change the theory of evolution as we learned it. the parts we learned are still correct, but need to be expanded. like a crossing between lamarack and darwin. imagine that can you can alter your gene expression' information over your lifetime and you can even pass those information on!

Just shut up if you don't understand the joke and don't have any knowledge about this topic to discuss with anybody here or put in any extra-information.

Also stating that the amount of expressed genes are close, doesn't give any information. There are species that are closer to human males than human males are to females (numberwise). Which genes are expressed is what counts. And even there you would have to state a specific number (99,994%), because we share so many genes with most species (over 50% with bananas for example).  And now we all learned: No gender is better. But to be fair, we are not even better than any other species. There is no better or worse under the eyes of evolution."

I also completely neglected (cause it was a joke,- can't emphasize this enough for obvious reasons) that the silenced X-chromosome is not completely useless and the male y-chromosome doesn't carry too many functioning genes either.

The study claims 8-15%, not 15% and talks about 639 genes, not 800. The study mentions 3-7% additional, individual tissue and strain-dependent expression, not 15% and also the study mentions that the expression rates for the genes escaping the silencing are much lower (they talk about at least 10% of actives chromosomes' activity)  

The rest you wrote is completely correct.

I am amazed how knowledge has changed! Assuming that I read the most recent studies about this in 2008-2009 where we learned that there are only 20 genes being expressed on the silenced X-chromosome....... and it doesn't really matter if we talk about 100, 150 or 200 genes,- it defenitely are far far more than science expected 7 years earlier.

MurderedByWords,ff66a4u,t1_ff65uh6,1579620153.0,"Yup, I explained that in another comment. About 20 genes are still expressed. If you compare those 20 to the 80000-140000 other genes distributed over 45 chromosomes it's a vanishingly small amount. Even tho it are just 20 genes,  the complete lack of that chromosome will lead to severe health issues. So I get your point, as they are not completely useless. But close to that ;-)"

The inactivated X-chromosome is silenced and will stay so except for very few exceptions (germline i.e.). ofc, it's not completely out of activity as i said (""to nearly no activity""). To be exact the few genes that are being expressed from the silenced X-chromosome lie exactly on the PARs (pseudoautosomal regions),- the two regions in the X and Y-chromosome that are homologous . Those are 20 genes (or it at least have been 20 identified genes when i learned that shit in 2009) ;-)

i stopped reading at your nazi-germany argument, because i now know how backed-up all your claims are. I am german and this is not correct! germans had to give all their military-grade and private weapons into governments' hands in 1918 after loosing WWI. the NSDAP was founded in 1920. in 1928 they still just had about 1% of the votes. In 1933 they captured the political power. Being 15 years off, while talking about a time where major changes occured daily? Knowing I was right anyways I interestdly checked on Nazis' gun control. I would like to quote the first link to be found: ""The Nazi gun control argument is a belief that gun regulations in the Third Reich helped to facilitate the rise of the Nazis and the Holocaust. The majority of historians and fact-checkers have described the argument as ""dubious,"" ""questionable,"" ""preposterous,"" ""tendentious,"" or ""problematic and described this theory as ""false"" or ""debunked""."" It is all backed with literature and quotes,- a quick google search will help you. It is clear that many american right-wing politicians and gun-rights activists use this argument (they are even named and cited) wrongly. It doesn't surprise me that they are uneducated. But i expect you to fact-check your stuff before running into an argument with senseless bullshit you heard on your local television. read a book before you come at me with ""history"". We all know muricans don't even know their own history, so don't start that shit...

why not take an eraser? It's forbidden to sell peanuts in Lee Country after dawn. Do you want to tell me we need to keep this law because erasing this is no proper solution? And i never sad erase it btw. I just have a problem with some kinds of guns. So i talk about change (the word I used), not erase (the word I didn't use) parts of the constitution.

They try to weed them out? doesn't work obviously. 

That's not the whole truth and you know that. BTW, if you get a gun you need to prove you can handle it properly, right? How can a gun be stolen? Either it was unlocked or they all stole it (unarmed) from your hands with some extra rounds? I don't get it... Weren't there many cases last year of ppl without licence buying guns in official shops? I am pretty sure I remember some cases where those official shops didn't take the laws toooo serious.

Even if you're right and you have to get through many checks and the killers all were young weirdos: it is prove that it's wayyyyyy to easy to get guns, and that's because they're everywhere...

well if it's not for yourself, aren't you scared of having to kill a human being then? I would be, tbh. Aren't you scared for the people around you? your partner, kids, friends, parents siblings??? I would immediately move out of a country where a psycho around the corner could wait with an MR-16, not for myself ut for my beloved ones. you can't always be there with your own gun. Or what happens when three intruders with three guns come to your house? Your gun won't help then neither i guess.

Good point, a gun is just a gun. It only gets dangerous when wrong ppl get their hands on it. History (and i mean the last 10 years) have shown that 1. America has many of those wrong ppl. and 2. they seem to get weapons too easy and too frequently. There is only one logical explanation: The law and mechanisms to make it safe don't work and need change. You are obviously properly trained and know how to handle and store your gun. Probably over 95% of the gunowners are like that. But then there are still like 10 million psychos with guns...

I think the discussion is unnecessarily heated, as we're not too far apart with what our intention is. I would never take your gun away. But why not change it? I mean, I have absolutely no clue about gun regulationing, but why not something like that:

Guns have to get much more expensive, so only the ppl that need it will purchase it. No gun advertismenets. No guns for kids (I've seen disturbing christmas ads from America with pink ""girly rifles"" - holy fuck!!!). Only ppl that prove to be worthy and well-trained (more strict, extensive and frequent tests). And only for ppl that can prove to be in need of a gun (can have several reasons like work-related, rural areas....)."

youseeingthisshit,fejuj4w,t3_ep7d71,1579186164.0,what has the height to do with it?
therewasanattempt,fejsprf,t1_fejmdnr,1579184914.0,"Held and used small calibers. But true, don't own one and there is absolutely no need. Some kind of guns make sense, I agree. Small calibers for defence (home intruders, wildlife) and some hunting rifles are absolutely fine. But why in the hell do you need automatics and shotguns? 

That's the point I tried to make mate. The constitution is not up to date anymore and needs change urgently. To claim that it's your right to bear machines with the only purpose of hurting or killing humans (no hunter uses automatic rifles) backed by a 230 year old document is very unprogressive. If you argue with laws, you should know that you're probably breaking them daily. There are so many weird 200 year old laws in the US nobody cares about (cause they her bullshit). So arguing with the constitution is pretty much the epitome of a hypocrite... either you follow every single law, or you agree that some laws don't make sense and need to be changed. Just because it's the constitution, doesn't mean it will stay Luke that for eternity,- thank god! If I think about the laws that applied here 250 years ago I am so freaking thankful the world has changed. You should also try to embrace change for the better instead of fighting it. Tell me from which state you are and I'll tell you which laws you've already broken this year ;-)

The hunting point is something different, nobody needs machineguns to fight off bears and you're very well aware of that. 

 Thats a point I totally agree with. The US has an immense mental health and drug abuse problem. And this should be tackled,  too. But isn't that another argument for me? Or do you think it's a good idea to throw a bunch of killing devices into a country full of psychopaths? And don't argument with your background check, more than half of the mass shootings from last year have proven that they do not work at all and everybody, literally every single American is ankle to get his/her hands on a gun if they really want to.

This issue frightens me even tho I live 4000km apart. I am sincerely scared for the good ppl in America. And I'm even more concerned that Americans like you are not afraid of this huge threat, just for the unnecessary luxury of being able to own guns?"
