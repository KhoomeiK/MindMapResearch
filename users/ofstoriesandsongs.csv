booksuggestions,ffcubdl,t3_eslfns,1579807413.0,"The Martian. It actually pulled me out of a similar spot when I first read it. This dude had literally *everything* going against him. He was stranded alone on an entire fucking planet, physically had no way to communicate for months, and even when he did, all they could do was talk. If he wanted to live, he still had to do all the work alone, because there was nobody else. Giving up was the easiest, cleanest, fastest thing he could have done, *but he didn't*. Mark Watney literally lived because he was too stubborn to die, so the only other option left was to fight like hell for his life. I don't know, I found it inspiring when I needed exactly that brand of inspiration."

running,fes7gbx,t3_eqg0m7,1579362179.0,"I just don't really notice other humans when I'm doing any type of workout. I keep track of cars when I'm running on the road so I don't get run over and die, but that's as far as I go. Otherwise, workout time is me time. I use that time to get deep into my own thoughts and I don't come out until I'm done.  

In any case, it's totally me and not at all personal. :)"
fatlogic,fejgflc,t3_ep4l2t,1579173046.0,"Hunger, fullness, appetite, and enjoyment signals? Really? Are you kidding?

This works the exact opposite way for me. If I estimated my caloric and nutrient needs based on my completely subjective and deeply fucked up hunger, fullness, appetite, and enjoyment signals, I'd starve to dead, probably. My anorexia thinks that hunger is an accomplishment and fullness is an unwelcome sign of failure at the same. I'm still not at a place where I have any sort of appetite or enjoy most food. If I only ate what I enjoyed and when I felt like it, I'd still be at BMI 16. Recovery is a conscious choice I make every day, by actively disregarding my hunger, fullness, appetite and enjoyment signals, and following the math instead. My body lies. Math and calorie counting doesn't."
fatlogic,feffynm,t3_eotyif,1579055509.0,"It is, though. If I were to hire a personal trainer or take a fitness class, I sure as fuck wouldn't be hiring one who isn't, y'know, fit. When I see an overweight fitness trainer, the only logical conclusion is that their program obviously doesn't work, or that they themselves can't be bothered to follow it, or both. Either way, I have no use for such a professional."

books,fdwxjop,t1_fdvunwr,1578763206.0,"Well I happen to intensely dislike using bookmarks. The damn things keep falling out and then I lose my place. If I buy a book, it's mine. I will dog ear, highlight, underline, and write/draw on the margins all I want. What is the point of owning a book if I'm afraid to read it?"
books,fdwv7mv,t3_en5uar,1578762646.0,"This literally doesn't bother me at all. The only thing is, sometimes I absolutely pick books based on pretty or interesting covers, and if I'm in that sort of mood, I'll never reach for one with people on them. But that's only when I know nothing about a book. If there's a movie or a TV show, I've probably at the very least heard of it. Otherwise, if I like the book, I really don't give a crap what's on the cover. The inside is the same either way."

fatlogic,fdrh0pt,t3_emudqk,1578684451.0,"Yeah, but my eating disorder has exactly fuck all to do with society telling me that I should be thin. For me it's about control. I went through years of daily abuse and vile bullying in school that my parents never fully believed was happening. I started controlling (restricting) my food because it was the only fucking thing in my life that I could control. Thinness never meant anything to me other than validation that my control was working."
fatlogic,fdqerd5,t3_emqf8o,1578664775.0,"Every time I see one of these, it makes me wonder what the OP's definitions are of the terms ""big eaters"", ""slim"", ""life-long self-starvers"", and ""fat"". I would be willing to bet my bottom dollar that at least one, and more than likely all of them, are dramatically skewed. Especially in regards to slim and starving. I've noticed that people who make excuses like this tend to think that ""slim"" is anyone slightly smaller than themselves, even if that person is still 50 lbs overweight, and ""starving"" seems to be curiously equivalent with eating four donuts instead of six."
books,fdnb2xg,t3_em5s00,1578581923.0,"Yaas! I've recommended that book to everyone who's ever asked me for a book rec. I don't know what is it about Mark Watney, but I just never get tired of him. I'm currently reading it for the third time, and I'm not usually a re-reader."

fatlogic,fdkvzge,t3_elw2xp,1578512298.0,">You will most likely have to continue to manipulate your food and activity level to maintain.

...you mean, if you lose weight and then go back to eating like a 400-pound person, you'll become a 400-pound person again? \*gasp\* Who knew?"

That sounds to me like it should be okay. I read GoF on Kindle and I didn't get a feeling like I missed out on anything. Although, to be fair, I also never compared it to the print edition."

fatlogic,fdbvu10,t3_ekgr6e,1578262711.0,"This logic makes no sense to me. They act like the society at large owes them something. I mean, let's play along with this for a second. Fine, yes. This is exactly why I work out. There is no other reason in the world why I might ever want to get up from the couch and move, if \~the society\~ hadn't told me that I should. There, I admitted it. You got me. And now what? Even if I meant every word of that, it's still my choice to participate in fatphobia if that's what makes me feel comfortable. I don't owe it to these people to stop an activity I choose to partake in for my own reasons or to weigh 300 pounds just to make them feel better about themselves."

fatlogic,fcvq8qu,t3_eizw2r,1578007650.0,"...but I literally have a life *because* of calorie counting. I'm alive because of calorie counting. Before I discovered how TDEE works, every minute of every day of my life revolved singularly around restricting and burning off every single bite I do eat. Now it doesn't. Now I have my maintenance range, my logging app and my math, so I'm no longer terrified of food and I can find a better use for all that brain space previously occupied by my eating disorder. Because I take five minutes a day to count calories."
fatlogic,fctxj60,t3_eimgv0,1577964554.0,"""Snack"" and ""need"" do not figure into the same sentence for me. I do not ever need, or even want, a snack.

I'll never understand why these people seem to be obsessed with constantly having something in their mouths and stomachs. Doesn't it get uncomfortable being full all the time?"
fatlogic,fcqz24q,t3_eiii15,1577894353.0,"Hang on a minute. If ""exfats"" is a term... then does its existence constitute FAs implicitly admitting that it *is* possible for a human to be an exfat, i.e. lose weight and keep it off?"
running,fcp3zfk,t3_ei82xa,1577849754.0,"I'm like that. I don't generally do races. I've done a few, and the pretty much the only thing I got out of the experience is a realization that I really don't feel any particular sort of way about races. I like running. I'm completely indifferent to racing at best. I'm not very competitive, especially when nothing is really at stake, and I don't use a race deadline as motivation. I run because I like it, I try to improve because I like being good at things I enjoy, and I compete against my own time, if I bother. I might do a race if there's a good reason, like raising funds for a cause I support, and then if I can comfortably spare the registration fee.

I don't think it really matters either way. Racing isn't a prerequisite to running. You can be a runner and never run a single race. And on the other hand, there's nothing wrong with races or people who like races. So long as people run and enjoy what they do, it totally doesn't matter why they do it."

books,fckxlqo,t3_egyz63,1577735369.0,"To be perfectly honest, I don't struggle with it at all. All of the local bookstores by me have insane markup and are prohibitively expensive for my current income. If my only choice for accessing books was local bookstores, I'd never read at all because I plainly can't justify to myself spending that much money on books when I have other things in my life that I need and want more than books.

My price range, and honestly, my interest range, is my library membership and the Kindle Deals page. I read what I can find in those two places. I'm not particularly obsessed with getting new books as soon as they're out, so this works pretty well for me."
books,fckwcw1,t3_ehisez,1577734612.0,"This is me. I like the idea of owning physical books. I love to wander around bookstores, I like the smell of books, I like to feel the weight in my hands and the paper under my fingers, I *really* like gawking at people's home libraries and reading nooks on Instagram... but they're kind of a pain in the ass to actually read. If I'm reading a paper book, I have to have decent lighting, I need a comfy sitting position so my hands don't cramp, I have to schlep it around in my purse all day, if it's a thicker book it's invariably awkward to hold, i can't change the font if it's too tiny or ugly... gah. I find that I often procrastinate on reading the paper books I borrow from the library because they're so annoying.

My Kindle is just less fussy. It weights almost nothing and takes up no space in my purse, I can pick whatever brightness, font and size are comfortable to me, and if I'm bored with whatever I'm currently reading, I have *hundreds* of options right there. It's just so convenient, which, to me, equals ""I actually read on it""."
