bulletjournal,ff3stiw,t3_ergmub,1579548090.0," At the end of 2019, I went to the authors of the most popular bullet journaling blogs.

Most of them were super busy, but still, they took their time to respond and even have a small conversation about their number one tips for the #bujo community. It took a month, but finally, my round-up post(and this infographic that summarizes it) is ready.

Names of some of these blogs are:

LittleCoffeeFox

LifeIsMessyAndBrilliant

TinyRayOfSunshine

PlanAnotherDay

Organized31

ElizabethJournals

LittleMissRose

OopsaDaisyUK

BulletJournalAddict

(I hope it is not against the rules to give the names of the blogs.)"
