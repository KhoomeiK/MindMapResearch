DnD,fe6ae0k,t1_fe65xtg,1578885397.0,"It is the nature of optimizing a dnd toon to fill a roll to take advantage of every opportunity of the action economy.  So I would say the dm should allow it.  

Cast find familiar and have it use the help action to grant advantage disadvantage.  Cast evards black tentacles to lock down enemies too.  

Heck, have one of your zombies carry around a bag of critters, like rats or rabbits, and if you need more temp hp have it throw it into the spell so when the spell kills the critters you get some temp hp in case you ran out.  Keep in mind however temp hp doesn't stack.

Buy sets of manacles and give them to your zombies.  Cast hypnotic pattern and while your enemies are incapacitated have your zombies chain them up.

When you get stronger later on and lower magic items ain't a big deal to acquire have your zombies just run around and throw beads from a necklace or fireballs at your enemies.  That would be funny too."

Get the inspiring leader feat and give your allies and zombies hp.  Have your zombies take the front line!  Use the zombies for grapple/shove/ help action for battle field control and granting advantage/disadvantage to attacks and skill checks.

sex,fd3gkef,t3_ejkfsl,1578158154.0,"I think what might help inform you a little more as to why he has this way of thinking is by looking at the frequency of your sex.  If you're having a lot of sex but he prefers you keep a shirt on, well, he's still attracted to you and it's probably just a preference.  If you're not having a lot of sex or you have to initiate sex yourself most of the time, than he might have intimacy issues or issues with women's bodies.

I mean, I'm no sex therapist so I hope I'm not misinforming you, but if your having lots of sex and the shirt thing is the only thing coming up then I think he's into you.  And since you find his habit odd it probably means you haven't experienced it with other partners so I don't think you need to be self conscience (or maybe you haven't had more partners but you haven't heard about this before, which i have to admit, i haven't either)."
