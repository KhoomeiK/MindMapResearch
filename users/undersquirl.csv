LiverpoolFC,ff28yy6,t3_eqz4yo,1579497309.0,"Are people actually saying this wasn't a foul? What?! He headed the ball out of the keepers hands, that's a foul. What the hell? How can anyone say that's not a freekick...

The whole idea that Virg was only looking for the ball and all that makes no sense. It can still be a foul if i'm only looking for the ball and kick you in the fucking face.

This is stupid."
LiverpoolFC,feq1egt,t3_eq1ofm,1579336046.0,Didn't they show much better replays of the tackle during the game?! This vid really brings nothing to the discussion except maybe seeing how the crowd reacted.

When i start blaming myself for the way i react i just say this in my head over and over and it seems to help me. It's just the way i handle it myself. I promise i was just trying to be helpful."

AskReddit,fddqlv2,t1_fddlgjp,1578321365.0,This is the most level headed comment i've seen here. Most of the comments here sound like your life should revolve around your job not the other way around. It's crazy.
AskReddit,fddqf1k,t1_fddi0eh,1578321210.0,"This comment gave me a very horrid feeling that we as a society have been brainwashed into thinking having a job is such a privilege that we should be slaves to the fucking machine and be grateful for it.

It's fine to be late if your job doesn't involve saving lives or something. As long as you don't abuse it, you shouldn't feel bad at all from just being a bit late."

soccer,fcd5zv4,t3_eh1ilr,1577606783.0,"The problem is not how the technology works but the people behind it. They have no fucking clue where to position the lines. 99% of the time they find the part of the body they think is offside and move the line from there towards where they consider that body part ""leaves a shadow"" on the ground. Most of the time they do this by thinking ""this foot seems to be in the right place"" which is wrong. The shoulder that they keep bringing up will not always be alligned to the foot they select on the ground.

The people in charge of thise decisions need some training in perspective, but what the fuck can you expect from 40 year olds that are used to having their way without any kind of repercusion?!

The system is brilliant and it works, the people are stupid.
