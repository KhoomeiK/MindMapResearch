muacjdiscussion,fehnrlt,t3_eozj48,1579120279.0,"**Not gonna buy a Tom Ford cream shadow.**

I’ve been pining over a fancy cream shadow for weeks now (think CT cream shadow, TF cream color for eyes). I imagine it would be so ~nice~ to have a high quality, non-creasing and one and done type of a cream shadow that is easy to apply yet still dynamic. I even stopped at a Tom Ford counter at the airport and asked about them, and they demoed the **Cream and Powder Eye Color in Golden Peach** on me and it was soooooo beautiful. I absolutely loved it. 

But $65?! £50!!???? I love makeup and all but that’s just CRAZY. 

Fast forward to me getting to my parent’s house, where most of my makeup collection is currently (studying abroad). I was playing around with the contents of my makeup drawer and came across a very lightly used H&M cream shadow I had totally forgotten about. I’m going to use it tomorrow and see how I like it. If I get hooked and want an upgrade as a replacement, then I can start to think about allowing myself to reconsider (lol) the TF one. 

So yeah, not gonna buy a £50 eyeshadow. Instead gonna try my existing cream shadow to see if the formula is everything I thought it would be. Will also try layering with a shimmery shadow (like from Norvina palette) if the effect would be similar than with the TF demo I had. Pretty please to not have made that impulsive purchase 😅"
muacjdiscussion,fehlf27,t3_ep5fpd,1579118920.0,"Use lighter layers on my base, less is more look. Also not really a technique but more a goal, I want to stop picking at my face cause I actually would have great skin if I just left it alone lol.

I woke up and at the foot of my bed there was a cloaked dark figure. Normal sized. I freaked out and tried to call my sister (who was in the next room) for help. When I started to try to call her (I couldn’t because paralysis lol) the figure turned around and kind of magnified over my bed, as if it could swallow the entire thing and me with it. My explanation is probably not great, but imagine if you were small and some adult stood to tower over you and that terrifying thing became the whole world.

PanPorn,fcximrz,t1_fcx066h,1578063865.0,"Not OP but yes. I used up the Kiehl’s one, but ended up buying the Origins GinZing one (in the orange pot with white cap) because I thought it would somehow hide my dark circles. Turns out it doesn’t lol and I don’t actually like the origins one much at all. Also I didn’t really know what I wanted out of an eye cream, just used whatever, but after not having the Kiehl’s one anymore I’m missing it! I’m always looking at the avocado one when I’m out near a Kiehl’s, wanting to repurchase it because it was so nice and hydrating. 

By the way, if you haven’t tried it, it might come as a surprise that it is kind of a weirdly thick texture for an eye cream.. But you just need a small smaaaall dot of it on one finger (I use my ring finger) and then I warm the product up by rubbing my ring fingers together until it softens a bit (maybe like 5 seconds). Easier to apply :)"

Just feels like this pump is kind of stone-aged in comparison to the new ones on the market. Also the sensor is so unreliable, it will literally suspend for a low when my blood sugar from the finger is 300/ 20mmol numbers higher.. I’d say about half the time the sensor will be around 5 numbers mmol or ~100 off. soooo over it and the constant beeping because of the sensor not working as it should."

muacjdiscussion,fcmu0u8,t3_ehwppt,1577792227.0,"These are the favorite products that I either started using this year or owned before but only used sporadically. 

Face

- **CT Airbrush Flawless Powder** in Fair. I bought this in August as I wanted a powder to use under my eyes to set concealer that wasn’t loose so I could travel with it too. I was weary of buying because of the price and seeing it soooo often on r/panporn and people saying how quickly they used it up. So I only use this for my under eyes (hence using less product), and for that it’s perfect! 

- **UD All Night Setting Spray**. Heck yeah. If I have an especially long day ahead or am going to a special event I’ll spray once when I have finished applying cream products, and once after applying powder products. Mascara I throw on after spraying, because I have a tendency to smudge it otherwise heh. I also bought a travel size of the summer solstice and it’s lovely! Wish I would have bought full size. 

- **JOAH Truly Yours Dark Circle Concealer** in Natural Ivory. Shade selection is so god-awful that it’s embarrassing, but otherwise it’s a great concealer! I like to wear it on my face and then just add power. 

- **Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder** in Dim Light. I embraced my ambient lighting palette this year, even though I bought it in 2017 or something. Fell in love with and fully panned Dim Light from the palette, and bought a full size (which I had been considering for over a year but weary because priiiceeeyyyy) at a Black Friday sale. Win! 

- **Nars Blush** in Bumpy Ride. I got this in the NARS advent calendar last year and I love it!! It’s a beautiful pink peachy sheen, but not glittery. It’s been my absolute go-to blush all year. 

Eyes 

- **Essence Lash Princess Mascara** in False Lash Effect (the green one). EXCELLENT mascara. Cheap and effective. I don’t buy other mascaras anymore and am appalled to be asked to pay like 30 euros for a mascara when Lash Princess is 5e and sooo good. 

- **Stila All Day Waterproof Brow Color** in Light. I really enjoy this, because my brows are quite light. I use a powder and angled brush at first but adding this in small strokes over it a) makes my brows look cleaner and b) stay in place longer. I’ve seen so many reviews for this like “this is the worst eyeliner ever you can’t even see anything!!1!” Lol so I guess if you like very dark and opaque brows or something this might not be the product for you. But for me it’s great!

Lips

- **L’Oréal Infallible Pro-Matte Les Macarons Scented Liquid Lipstick** in Mademoiselle Mango. This is such a beautiful red lipstick with a hint of orange. The macaron smell is nice and not overwhelming. Application is easy peasy and it stays in place ALL DAY. It’ll last through a meal well, but a touch up after is nice. I love this! 

- **MAC Powder Kiss Lipstick** in Devoted To Chili and Mull It Over. Soft, easy and comfortable to wear. 

- **Bobbi Brown Lip Balm SPF 15**. This is lovely. I’m not a usually a fan of balms that you have to apply with your finger as I wouldn’t carry this with me and use on the go in town, even if I would like to. Instead I apply it as soon as I sit down to do my makeup, and it’s lovely and makes my lips soft. Lovely! 

Happy new year everyone! :)"

It’s cheap, good quality, and doesn’t flake or smudge on me. I am never able to justify other mascara purchases because this one is like 5 euros and other drugstore ones can be 10-15. If you can get one, I’d definitely give it a shot! And if it doesn’t work out, then it wasn’t such a big loss because of the low price :) 

Only downside is that usually I refresh my mascaras with a drop or contact solution after about 2-3 months to get another month of use, but when I tried it with this one it became veeeery clumpy. So I wouldn’t recommend the contact solution drop with it 😄"

Is it out of the question to not paint your nails (or use a clear/pale polish) or do you also just like the look? :)

LifeProTips,fc3kic2,t1_fc3jcyf,1577391827.0,"Personally I prefer writing by hand instead of an app. I’m on my phone enough otherwise haha. It’s really a matter of getting to know yourself and reflect on your thoughts and actions, and become aware of any improvements you could make. I’d also emphasize that keeping a diary is really a matter of habit. 

Some ideas: 
- recount your day. Any significant details you missed in the moment? 
- or then focus on just the highlight / lowest point of the day. Really go through it and figure out why it was so good and what you appreciated, how you felt, why it was important to you etc. 
- google diary / self reflection prompts
- set a timer for 20 minutes and just. Keep. Writing. No stopping, no pausing, just write whatever thought comes up. 

Old diaries are also fun to, albeit cringy lol, read over after some years have passed. I wrote a lot in my diary when I was extremely depressed and lonely as an outlet for those feelings, and it’s sad to look back at entries from that time. But still it’s amazing seeing progress and growth. Good luck!"

It was fun to experiment but in the end I’m pretty happy with just a ruler, black pen, and maybe a color or two. And most people probably have some colored pencils or markers already lying around! 

Experiment but you don’t need to get sucked into the loop of buying everything! If you are still in school you can probably go to the art class and ask the teacher to borrow a few pens or pencils or whatever instead of buying them. :)"
