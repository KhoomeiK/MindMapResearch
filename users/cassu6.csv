It was nice chatting with you, even though I really started our chat on the wrong foot :)"
Nordichistorymemes,ff9eagw,t1_ff9e0bc,1579711146.0,"I definitely don’t agree on your use of ethnicity.

Nor the use of “white” in white privilege, but I do agree on that employers definitely favor local workforce over foreign and with a good reason too. That of course depends on the area of work."
Nordichistorymemes,ff9d9hk,t1_ff993is,1579710460.0,Okay umm??? Since when did “ethnic” mean African or Middle-eastern?
Nordichistorymemes,ff98tbv,t1_ff98pbv,1579707493.0,Well no... if a white russian dude tried to get an interview you’d still give the interview to someone local. Nothing to do with color mate
Nordichistorymemes,ff98kws,t1_ff98frt,1579707343.0,And that has nothing to do with white privilege. Rather that people want to hire people who most certainly speak the language of the country they reside in.
Nordichistorymemes,ff96ijb,t1_ff8otxx,1579706002.0,Fuck off cunt. White privilege ain’t even a thing

My grandpa also taught us that if you put a stick in a nest the ants will come and “piss” on the stick and you can then lick that stick and it will taste good(?). Honestly can’t remember what it tasted like but I did that a couple of times so it must’ve been decent"

todayilearned,fetvbir,t1_fetubaw,1579380417.0,"I think a big part of people being okay with conscription is because of the “propaganda” we been fed our whole lives. It’s not really propaganda but Finns surely love to brag about fighting against the Soviets and surviving, and because of that many Finns are extremely patriotic. Also most of us believe that it’s a necessary “evil” to have conscription.

Still most people actually want to join the army because it’s basically playing soldier, but not with sticks."
todayilearned,fett72a,t1_fes6lff,1579379785.0,Honestly as a Finnish man who is about to serve his time in the military. I really don’t mind conscription or that it is only mandatory for males. Neither do most of my friends
