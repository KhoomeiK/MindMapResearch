Children's books are for children. Yes. Good show. And if someone is genuinely refusing to move past children's or YA lit in what they read, then that's a pity because they're missing out on the whole new world that is adult literature. Yes, OP was trolling, but even so, good discussion resulted of people either reminiscing or bonding over old favorites. Maybe that seems trite to you, and that's okay. But if we've reached a point where /bookscirclejerk starts to troll, maybe we should look at it from the opposite perspective: that readers on this sub still feel the need to defend the idea that YA lit can be quality lit as well as adult lit. I've honestly never come across someone who either parades YA lit as the ultimate or tries to enter the conversation as someone who reads nothing but YA lit, yet that strawman is what everyone seems to think of when the topic comes up. I don't know, man. I've read good YA lit, and I've read good adult lit. For what it's worth, I finished Chesterton's _The Innocence and Wisdom of Father Brown_ a few days ago and really enjoyed it. 

I'm not personally offended. I know what I read, and I'm fine with it. I just truly don't understand why some care so much as to actively disparage those who read YA lit, especially when it's never been stated that YA lit is all they read."

I think another example, as others have pointed out in this post, could be the idea of fantasy (and L'Engle may have been thinking specifically of that in her quote). Many adults obviously enjoy the fantasy genre, but I'd imagine there are also many who think it's a waste of time since it's not set in the ""real world.""
