leagueoflegends,feru6mg,t1_ferkzj2,1579358383.0,"I think his passive is what makes him interesting to play, and it makes him at least slightly more fair to play against. Your two main abilities alone don’t give you 3 hits unless you hit double Q, so every combo you go for requires a little bit of setup. You have to hit a stun, go in at a time that you can auto after your E hit without getting punished, hit a double Q, or set it up so you can ult on your target. Unless you’re already fed you have to do something to get your 3 hits off and then use the movespeed to get out or you will lose the trade."

There is a CUM EGG alert in aisle 4!

Someone came all over the floor. There is cumeggs everywhere. You cannot stand in aisle 4 without seeing or feeling cumeggs. The amount of eggs and ejaculate in aisle 4 is simply unnatural. Please for the love of God, we need a cleanup in aisle 4. This lagoon of cummie eggie must have been produced by a fucking blue whale.

Oh God I can smell it.

She only gets her maximum mobility potential if she gets a really good setup where she can use her E to close in on you, combo you, and then take her E back out, and it runs out pretty quickly. Even then she probably has to use her W sooner and than she otherwise would and extend past the safety of the shroud to get the setup where she can dash away to it.

Compare that to champions like Zed or LeBlanc whose regular combos include a free blink back out."
