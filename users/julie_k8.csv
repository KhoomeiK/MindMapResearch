WESOŁYCH ŚWIĄT! I cant wait to visit my family in Warsaw from Chicago"
TrueOffMyChest,fbyaifv,t1_fbyabk7,1577212074.0,"I do too. I’m sure I even get the same when I say it too, but I KNOW I have it & have proof. 
People just want attention now a days and don’t realize the actually physical and mental pain that happens. It’s not a little nervous feeling in your stomach."

TrueOffMyChest,fby7swk,t3_ef2tx3,1577210176.0,"Absolutely agree with you. 
I am diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. 
I’ve been in the hospital for suicide attempts, and anxiety attacks. I’ve been seeing a social worker all my life and still struggle 13 years later. 
People compare my attacks and attempts to their small anxiousness and scream, “oh, I have anxiety”.
It’s such bullshit because people who are diagnosed and legit FUCKING STRUGGLE EVERYDAY DAMN DAY aren’t taken seriously because suddenly “everyone” has it."
depression,fby1fr0,t1_fby0q6u,1577205781.0,"I feel the same. 

Thank you. Much appreciated. I hope you get through it too. Least your little ones can bring out joy. 

Happy new year too"

Cheers to working. Merry Christmas Eve."
depression,fbxy0wd,t1_fbxwtjd,1577203421.0,"I can’t imagine how tough it must be with children. I’m sorry about that. 
I wish I could tell you to feel better but I myself can’t even feel better. Every year just seems like the spirit is deteriorating. And for some reason this particular Christmas seems like a weight of emotions or no emotions at all. 
At least I have it in me to still hope for a better Christmas spirit next year..and the year after. 

Cheers to you and your family. M*rry Christmas."
depression,fbxxng7,t1_fbxx0np,1577203156.0,"I guess it has to do with trauma and knowing how small and divided my family is. Then not have a good start to today’s morning. 
I don’t know. I feel disconnected and disassociated with life and myself. Can’t seem to enjoy anything and when everything is piling on top of you... you just become a ticking time bomb. 

But you’re not wrong. It is up to me... just can’t find any will to try"
