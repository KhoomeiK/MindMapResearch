MagicArena,fdoarks,t1_fdo4wew,1578601826.0,"I didn't say win before they hit, I said win before they become a problem. An aggro deck doesn't care about baby tef coming down and bouncing one of their three creatures, or Royal Scions coming down and rummaging. Oko is a huge problem as soon as he hits, I agreed with that, that's why he's banned.

>nobody is saying that walkers are primarily powerful because of their de facto lifegain

Your statement that I responded to was that Royal Scions is ""broken too but because of essentially giving +6 life to UR, not because of its loyalty abilities"". If your point is that walkers are powerful in general then yeah, we're in agreement."
MagicArena,fdnzxr6,t1_fdnvrrp,1578596264.0,"My point stands, if you're playing an aggro deck that cares about lifegain you really should just be aiming to win before the planeswalkers become a problem. If you're playing another deck, there are other ways to deal with planeswalkers.

The issue with something like Oko is that he provides huge value AND is hard to remove. An aggro deck can't just ignore him because he comes down and starts making blockers and food. Royal Scions is generally seen as a very fair and reasonable high loyalty PW.

To be clear, planeswalkers are really powerful, I agree there. It's just more because of their repeatable persistent value than the pseudo-lifegain effect."
MagicArena,fdnvies,t1_fdmppqd,1578593689.0,"From an aggro point of view, if you kill them quickly enough you never need to target the scions at all. If the game goes long enough to the point where the scions will make a significant difference... then you probably weren't gonna win anyway.

If you draw into it on turn 12 and go infinite, how is that any different than drawing into a Craterhoof and winning that way?

A few suggestions:

How about [[Nissa, Who Shakes the World]]? Double mana from all your forests is no joke.

[[Gaea's Cradle]] is pretty expensive, but I love running [[Growing Rites of Itlimoc]] as a budget replacement. I bet there are a bunch of other good lands you can include instead of just all forests, theres a ton of room for creativity there - even just a few cycling lands like [[Tranquil Thicket]] would be good since they're easily replaceable draws late game

Imo every single green deck should have [[Beast Within]] - unconditional interaction is always good

[[Seedborn Muse]] and [[Wilderness Reclamation]] seem to be along similar lines as [[Awakening]] but are one sided. The muse especially would do a ton of work for Omnath, Wilderness Rec isn't quite as powerful but is a little harder to remove since it's an enchantment instead of a creature. Either way, it's probably worth running both

Also [[Doubling Cube]] is just hilarious. I'm sure that's standard tech for monogreen Omnath, I'm just honestly not super familiar with him and I laughed out loud when I saw that

29 lands does seem pretty low, how's that been performing for you? It's not objectively wrong, I know a lot of cEDH decks run low land counts like that, but you really need a lot of other pieces to make that work.

EDIT: maybe something like Finale of Devastation or Chord of Calling would be good (no tagging in edits sadly) - you're gonna have the mana, so tutoring for any huge Eldrazi in your deck and putting it right on the field would be awesome"
