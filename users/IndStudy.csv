Instead of trying to distract him, or to get him to sit, I just kept walking while holding his leash taut. It has worked for me so it might work for you. Best of luck."
BeAmazed,ffdkwfn,t1_ffdjn97,1579823046.0,You didn't think a sanctuary was the right choice cuz he was too attached to you so instead you decided to kill him? A bit odd.

How do I get an Atom plugin which allows me to use a python IDE? Should I just search up python ide atom plugin? Is there anyone you can reccomend or is there something I should be looking for?
learnprogramming,fef250z,t1_fef1o90,1579046393.0,"Yes, Python. But all the info I found online is saying most python coders use a text editor rather than an IDE. Not sure why."

suggestmeabook,fdrvht5,t3_cv09of,1578690345.0,"Any of his other works honestly. Some are less focused on individuals but they are all an analysis of a part of our society with historical/current examples. I cant really remember any specific book that talked about human interaction but if you look through what he has released you might find something you like. I really liked ""Tipping Point."""

Whatcouldgowrong,fdfy0y2,t1_fdfiqmt,1578373382.0,"That certainly doesnt make it not true. I also should have made a distinction between the government and the culture/identity. Eastern Ukraine has a very strong Russian identity, it's harder to judge the treatment towards the government."
Whatcouldgowrong,fdex7p3,t1_fdesj1z,1578348502.0,Not all Ukrainians want nothing to do with Russia. The eastern part of Ukraine is incredibly Russian the only real difference is a border.
