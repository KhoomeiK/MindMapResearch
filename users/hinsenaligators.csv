I think it’s the extent of the fires, the length of time they have been burning and how many people are being impacted. People have lost everything and it’s so bloody sad. I think at the moment most people are just trying to get through this, and will deal with the fall out when the dust settles.

It’s on the news every night, always on social media and it’s all people talk about. And it’s because I think most of us are just heartbroken and feel pretty helpless.

My parents are in Gippsland and have come close to losing their home, and that’s something that’s always on my mind. They have had to evacuate but were able to return and are so lucky.

I think it’s also the frustration that a lot of us are feeling at our Government’s response to the situation. It’s all too little too late. Even after experiencing one of the worst droughts in history and then these cataclysmic fires our Prime Minister can’t utter the words Climate Change. He’s too busy appearing at places attempting to shake peoples hands and generally being a PR disaster! 

It rained yesterday in Melbourne and no one complained. It was so beautiful to see rain. We need so much more of that!

I just want to say thank you to the international community for reaching out and supporting Australia. The concern and love shown is amazing. We’re all feeling the love and it’s so appreciated!

So yeah, we’re a bit all over the place and just hoping things improve soon!"
offmychest,fd6kg3e,t1_fd6j1hy,1578192363.0,"Mate that’s what we do. And I’ll admit it. If I watch what the pollies are doing I feel hopeless too. 

But where there’s life there’s hope. I have to believe that. And watching how Australians are rallying to fight these fires and look after each other I feel less helpless and hopeless.

We’re all in this together."
offmychest,fd6djeo,t1_fd6cnwt,1578189324.0,"Bushfires are actually an important part of our eco system... it’s just when global warming and extreme drought meet that we have major issues.

Australia’s Indigenous people have burnt off parts of bush land for thousands of years so that major fires like this don’t happen. It’s something that we still do to a point as part of modern day land management.

So yeah, this is less petrol tress and more climate change at this point..."
offmychest,fd67ae3,t3_ek042i,1578186567.0,"This is the worst summer I can remember. Half of my state (Victoria) is literally burning. We’ve nearly lost my parents house in Gippsland three times this week.

I’ve never seen a natural disaster so bad that we have called in the Defence Force for help.

And all of this off the back of one of the worst periods of drought in our history.

Our PM is pretty close to being a Climate Change denier and I don’t see that the government is doing much good in this crisis....

But what I do see?

I see our volunteer firefighters defending lives and homes, without pay, for months on end. I see communities coming together to look after those who have lost their homes and those in need. I see strangers showing up in towns, having driven for hours, cooking meals, offering solace and friendship. I see the courage and humanity, the mateship that makes Australia such a wonderful country, and I see it each day when I turn on the news.

All is not lost, Australians are a tough people. You have to remember that we are a nation who grew from hardship, defined ourselves in times of great crisis and uncertainty and who will continue to do so.

Look not to the politicians, look to the people. To the men and women on the ground, day on day, standing firm in this hell fire. They are the people, who, when all of this is over? Will demand the change we need and won’t take no for an answer. 

It’s pretty fucked. But we’ll fix it. We have to. Our lives depend on it. And Australians have a reputation for not backing down in a fight, especially one for their lives. Everything’s not lost, not yet."
AmItheAsshole,fcm8rh6,t1_fckr820,1577767274.0,"NTA. This is such an excellent piece of advice and... actually something that you’re taught to do if you suffer from an anxiety disorder.

You’re taught to practice the act while not in a state of panic, so that when an attack starts you’ve got it down and can do it as second nature.

Clear instructions will help her to engage with the steps she needs to follow rather than succumb to the anxiety she experiences.

But man do I feel for her. Seeing your kid go through that is tough."

toastme,fbtpzk1,t3_eedr0i,1577089664.0,"The way you have faced the challenges thus far in your life is inspiring man. Keep going, keep fighting. You’ll face more challenges but always remember that the best way is through the fire, always doing your best. If you’ve done your best? Then you have achieved more than most.

Changing the attitude of others is no small feat, but it’s one of the most important battles. Because until people begin to see things from another’s perspective they’re only seeing it from their point of view. Be gentle, be kind and be compassionate in this work. Not everyone opens their eyes quickly.

You’re amazing! 16! You’re gonna take the world by storm, you already are. You should be so proud of yourself. You’ve already done more self work than some people will do in an entire lifetime. You’re a beautiful human. Well done my friend. So much love!!!"
