Second, even if you're hung up on hymens, the average virginal hymen can easily allow a tampon into and out of the vagina. (There are exceptions, because humans differ.)

TwoXChromosomes,feh3qg1,t1_feh2q9w,1579108519.0,"Go ahead and buy teacher gifts if they're within your budget, but don't let peer pressure from other parents make you feel bad. The best gift you can give a teacher is a child who wants to learn, and your words of support throughout the year. If you have a really good teacher, another thing you can do is to write down why they're great and send it to the principal for inclusion in their personnel file. It costs nothing, and you can give the teacher a copy for their own reference."

TwoXChromosomes,feh23l4,t1_fegv4qj,1579107540.0,"I was a teacher for 10 years, and I think I can say, not just for myself but for the others I knew, that teacher gifts don't have any influence on how your child is treated. With the unfortunate exception of major unethical bribes. Teachers spend all day with your kids, so what influences them is the kid's own behavior. If the parents are generally supportive and friendly, or if they're dismissive of the teacher's expertise and rules, that might make a difference as well. But we understand about the differences in life situations (income, culture, family dynamics) just as we can tell which kids did the science project on their own vs the ones who had so much help they barely participated. One year I had a bunch of kids putting presents on my desk and little girl asked, ""Is a card a present?"" Oh you betcha honey! A card is definitely a present. Especially when you drew it yourself. 

But it is true, in the schools where teacher gifts are the norm, they're mostly bought by moms. Sometimes the kid helps pick them out, in which case they're often less usable/appropriate, but more adorable.

Nowadays I work in a gift shop, and I've never seen a man buying teacher gifts. If he did, he'd get all my help. So if you're a man reading this, go to the shop, and ask the old lady for help.
