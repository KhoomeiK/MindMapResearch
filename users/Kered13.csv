This is trying to count the number of times the loop runs, but because `i` was not initialized there is no telling what value it will hold at the end. Instead it should be `int i = 0;`

Another common mistake is to not initialize a pointer. This will *usually* cause a segfault when the pointer is dereferenced (same as dereferencing a null pointer), but in some cases it may cause more subtle errors.

The tricky thing about uninitialized variables is that because they can contain anything, they can even contain valid values that will not cause errors. This can cause inconsistent errors, or errors that seem to appear and disappear when you try to debug them. For example adding print statements or running in a debugger could cause the error to disappear or change it's nature. This can make them very difficult to track down."

And this is how it's always been, ray tracing is just not as efficient as rasterization, so whatever you can render with ray tracing you can render with rasterization faster and with more effects.

Where ray tracing might see some use is in applying effects that rasterization can't handle well, like refraction, caustics, and shadows, on top of an otherwise rasterized scene. The thing is, this isn't new either. Every game engine has a ray cast function and it's used for a lot of effects (and gameplay, like hitscan calculations).

Without seeing your code it's impossible to give a definite answer, but it's important to understand that Javascript is singly threaded (per webpage), meaning that only one thing can be happening at a time. If you start something that will take time to complete, nothing else on that page can execute in the meantime (the page will freeze). Async-await provides a way to work around this by allowing tasks that are waiting for something external to complete (usually an HTTP request or a timer) to stop running so other tasks can run instead. This is called [cooperative multi-tasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking).
