excel,ffa1dtj,t1_ff8xre4,1579725926.0,"Fantastic. So PowerQuery is another layer to Excel. It extracts data, you can create steps to transform (filter) the data, and then PQ saves the new data set, without changing the original data.

Steps to apply filters are:

1. In your original data sheet, make the dataset a table (Ctrl + T)

2. In the PQ/Data tab you should see an ""Import from Table"" option, if not navigate to Get Data and look for it in the menu.

3. PQ should have opened, use the drop down filter on the column you want to filter, Conditional filter > does not contain ""AA"". OK

4. Notice there is a panel on the right of PQ with ""Steps"" your new step is not listed, under Source (which gets the data) & Change Type (PQ trying to detect numbers & dates), feel free to click on the little COG beside your Step to change or update it. New steps you apply will be listed under here & it's all traceable.

5. In the PW home tab, top left, hit Close & Load. PQ will close and your cleaned dataset will appear on a new tab.

6. Change your data in your original table and hit Refresh in Excel, PQ will run, apply your steps and your cleaned table will reflect the new data. Tomorrow just overwrite your original table"

We often use words like ""staging your flare"" but it's all ambiguous, so really is best coming from a coach in your region. Perhaps look beyond your local DZ for a regional/global coach that specialises in canopy

For me the pulses flare felt mushy, so I found I was landing it like a old school square canopy. Almost a single stage flare but in reality the first stage of my flare was held for a shorter than usual, then I transitioned smoothly but rapidly to a full arm extension and strong flare. Using the speed to generate lift, rather than (what I'd usually do) washing off the speed in the first stage of the flare. 
Again I was on a higher WL and a bigger wing (which generates more lift) so you may find the pulse to be a different canopy to fly, look for people like Pete Allum in Europe or Flight1 courses and learn from the best"

That being said ensure that you are comfortable in the wing you intend to jump. The Pulse is a different canopy than the pilot especially in the flaring characteristics. I was flying them at 1.4WL and that will also factor into how they fly so I can't give you perfect advise (which is why we say talk to people in person). 

On the higher WL Vs smaller canopy. Yes higher WL gives somewhat more forward drive, however a smaller canopy is also a smaller platform (think of a rollerblade Vs a roller skate) and a smaller canopy will be less forgiving to inputs. Theres a great talk a called [Girls can't fly parachutes](https://youtu.be/2Kl57GYip5c) about this. 

Best advice I can give is do a canopy course and talk to your coach about your thoughts. She/He will give you the best advice"
