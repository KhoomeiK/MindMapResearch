puppy101,fc780zu,t1_fc77t1e,1577499989.0,I’ll watch that now. Thank you for the recommendation.
puppy101,fc77fh0,t1_fc77b9r,1577499543.0,Thanks. I definitely will 😄
puppy101,fc771a7,t1_fc7696q,1577499251.0,"Are there any products you can put on a puppy’s paws? That actually works and doesn’t make them uncomfortable?

Edit: https://woodrowwear.com/retail-locations/power-paws-wholesale-program/

Anyone have experience with something like this?"
puppy101,fc75wg6,t1_fc75ayj,1577498389.0,"Thank you, I will read those. And I too, have kind of an idea of how difficult it’s going to be and there’s no doubt in my mind that I will feel overwhelmed at some point. But I’m prepared to face the challenges that it will bring. 

Thankfully I have my girlfriend to help me just like you have your wife, so I’m positive we’ll come through. 😀"
puppy101,fc74rl1,t1_fc74i1r,1577497510.0,"Oh wow I had no idea. Thanks for the heads up. It’s a small apartment, would it be enough to get one rug and hope he will learn naturally to stay there as much as he can?"
puppy101,fc74i68,t1_fc7454k,1577497310.0,"That’s a great idea, thanks!"
puppy101,fc74ep3,t3_eghtiz,1577497238.0,"Could very well be a health issue, schedule an appointment with a vet.

Also if you haven’t you should schedule his drinking instead of having water out for him to drink whenever I want."
puppy101,fc73qy6,t1_fc72dvq,1577496739.0,Thank you. I’ll definitely do my best.
puppy101,fc73p5p,t1_fc71vve,1577496701.0,"Thank you so much for the reply, I’m scared but still confident that I will succeed.  The only thing I’m worried about in my home is the hardwood floor. It’s absolutely brand new and I’m really worried about potential permanent damage."
puppy101,fc72zc7,t1_fc71nfp,1577496151.0,"Is it safe to bring him to my mom’s house before he’s vaccinated? My siblings are 4 and 6 and my older siblings have 3 kids between them that spend a lot of time there. And would it be safe for him to walk outside while he’s young? My mom lives on the street below mine, it’s a 5 minute walk but it’s cold and the snow is pretty heavy. 

The temperature is generally about 0 to -10 C. Will he need a coat for going outside to do his business? I’ve heard dogs are generally not comfortable in those so I won’t put him in those unless it’s necessary.

Thanks for the input!"
Coffee,fc729c9,t1_fc5xayc,1577495611.0,"i’ve actually heard from a lot of people as well as on the internet that the french press was the best method of brewing coffee, as it uses no filters.

Why do you say it’s the worst for flavor? I got one from my gf’s parents this christmas and have only used it once using pre-ground coffee (I bought a coffee grinder but it won’t arrive until sometime next week.)

The coffee does taste pretty good but it’s really weak compared to what I’m used to, but I assumed it was because the coffee is preground and not coffee beans, and because the coffee I bought that was made for a press seems to be too fine, at least for the press I have.

Also I haven’t tried making an entire batch of coffee, only 2 cups at a time, and it’s my first time using a french press."
facepalm,fc0frcv,t1_fbziqy3,1577289750.0,"Oriental is literally regional. Oriental basically means east while occidental means west. So no, not a slur. Never met an asian in my life that finds it offensive, my girlfriend is asian and I’ve asked her and she asked her family.

You can really just google it, the term has never been used offensively.

Also I googled Eskimo and I’ve looked into it, it’s not a slur according to a lot of sources. Again, just google it. Just because some twitter star starts telling people it’s a slur doesn’t make it a slur. It needs to actually be offensive. Which it isn’t.

Edit: but it’s really sweet of you to think I’ve never met an asian person in my life when my girlfriend is asian. Good job buddy."
facepalm,fbz7rrc,t3_ef7seu,1577237737.0,"Reminds me of this “progressive” girl I know whose most recent contribution to society is telling us that “eskimo” is a slur, this same girl also tried telling us that “oriental” is actually a slur.

She is neither oriental nor an eskimo."
AskMen,fbwfum7,t1_fbw9m5o,1577148818.0,"Some do, but it’s probably some kind of erectile dysfunction and not something to be bragging about."
instantkarma,fbwfep1,t1_fbwecy2,1577148481.0,"So you clearly lost your argument and now you want to get into the physics.

The impact of the collision is spread through the entire mass of that train, it’s cargo and it’s passenger. Worst scenario an elderly woman who happened to be standing as the collision happened and she falls over. Which again is nothing to be glad about. The best and most likely scenario is that no one who didn’t see the impact even realised it happened.

The train also impacted with the rear end which means that the impact was absolutely miniscule in the grand scheme of a TRAIN."
instantkarma,fbwdnk9,t1_fbwcqeo,1577147171.0,"Do you honestly believe that the passengers of a train like this could be physically hurt by the collision? Nope.

Also you’re just making my point for me. All I said is that it’s not right to be “glad to see shit like this”

You can blame the driver as much as you want but it’s nothing to be glad about."
instantkarma,fbwcbnv,t1_fbwbkeo,1577146177.0,"That’s just immature. 

I don’t need to defend the person operating the vehicle because he/she was most likely killed instantly by the collision. I just have sympathy for him/her because that was probably never the intention.

I’m certainly not glad about the event because for all we know there was an entire family in that car. How is this so difficult to understand? 

Tragedies are just not the time for life lessons mate, you clearly have issues."
instantkarma,fbwb43y,t1_fbw98xt,1577145289.0,"Lol. I was trying to saturize what you originally said. But whatever. I just think it’s a bit odd to be glad when a tragic accident happens, what if it was a relative of yours? You still glad? Or god forbid you one day make a mistake and you’re the one getting smashed by a train?

But of course, you’re not capable of mistakes, are you? (This is sarcasm, just to be clear here, we’re all human and we’re all capable of mistakes, which is why we shouldn’t be glad when someone  tragically loses their life, even if their judgement was wrong)

Feels like I’m trying to teach basic moral princibles to a toddler, but in reality you’re probably just a very self righteous adult dickhead."
facepalm,fbwa7bx,t1_fbw8wu2,1577144609.0,"Pretty sure if we had any data about this amount of fails before passing would probably prove to have 0 effect on the likelyhood of said driver causing an accident. People can barely pass first try and people can get a perfect result after five failures. Also, a person who fails 5 times most likely has some kind of anxiety or even just a real lack of motivation than just being incapable of safe driving."
instantkarma,fbw8dls,t1_fbvd9xw,1577143272.0,"Yes, he is. And 52 upvoters are too.

And here, your comment, a small sliver of rationality in an otherwise mad crowd is instantly downvoted."
instantkarma,fbw7zvk,t1_fbue1y9,1577143016.0,"Yeah. Fuck him. Fuck his kids too who might have been with him in the car, fuck any pedastrian that might’ve been hit as a result of the catapulting truck. Everyone who I perceive as assholes should die because I’m the best most perfect person in the world so it’s okay.

That’s pretty much you."

ShouldIbuythisgame,fbw5miu,t3_eer4mz,1577141509.0,"Pretty mediocre, not worth full price imo."
rpg,fbw5gzd,t3_eer5fk,1577141410.0,Not an RPG but he might really love subnautica.
facepalm,fbw4h62,t3_eerds6,1577140793.0,"Hmm. The homeless man committed a bank robbery for $100? Why not just steal food from a supermarket?

I’m guessing the homeless man committed the robbery in order to be sentenced to jail where he’ll at least have shelter and food."
facepalm,fbw2oxc,t1_fbv2aro,1577139793.0,That’s pretty stupid. Everyone is capable of improvement.
facepalm,fbvvn8d,t3_eeoh5r,1577136735.0,"Bisexual. The real facepalm on her part is that she thinks she has to explain or validate her sexuality to people when in reality, people probably couldn’t care less what you’re into.

Shocker, I know."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fbvu96j,t1_fbvsrdr,1577136153.0,"To begin with you play as a pre-established character, Geralt of Rivia, who has already been given a personality and a history. There are no skills to level up or customize, no class system and little customization when it comes to gear and stuff, although every gear piece has it’s own stats and sometimes a set bonus it’s not nearly as exciting as gear in skyrim. Combat is also pretty much limited to swords. The combat system is still refined and very fluid, pretty similar to shadow of mordor except more difficult. 


Still, fantastic game and the story and characters are pretty much unmatched by anything else. So definitely give it a try, you most likely won’t regret it. Just don’t go into it expecting a skyrim-like RPG because that’s not at all what it is."
facepalm,fbvs17g,t1_fbvkpt0,1577135239.0,The realest facepalm is you lmao
ShouldIbuythisgame,fbv1o98,t1_fbuun78,1577123941.0,"The Witcher 3 definitely wins in all of those categories. But let’s be real. Nothing tops the adventurous feel of Skyrim. The Witcher is so restricting it barely even qualifies as an RPG...

I think they are both good in their own ways but having played both, Skyrim wins by a mile not by objective standards but because of something that’s difficult to put in to words, highly subjective obviously but no game ever made me feel like Skyrim did. The world is just so immersive and every moment in the game takes your breath away.

But yeah, TW3 is definitely the objectively better game."
politics,fbsvomo,t1_fbsuo1e,1577061491.0,"If you dislike him so much your time would be better spent actually criticising him as a politician, instead of just goofing on the guy. 

Bush was famous for his way of speech, there’s an entire wikipedia page dedicated to it, called “Bushism” and you probably remember his “fool me once” bit. People laughed and all but they didn’t try to call him out for being a “fucking moron”. Probably because they actually had shit to complain when it came to him as a president. With Trump you’re just grasping at straws because you really just hate the republican party.

Anyways I’m done trying to rationalize with someone who has the mind of a child so enjoy your night."
