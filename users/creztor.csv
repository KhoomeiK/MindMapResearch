Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the shit out of the game but it was clear they were taking the piss out on me. Flashlights and general juking. Yes, it shows I need to improve. Main issue with switch is not enough player base, but same problem exists."

HongKong,fdhxl6c,t1_fdhr8el,1578431993.0,"The person wanted an explanation as to politics in Taiwan. They obviously wanted non biased info. I am 100% pro kmt. However, I've no problem with people voting for DPP."
HongKong,fdhpx1j,t1_fdh0z59,1578427828.0,"Please, that post is heavily biased painting the DPP in a good light. Google Chen ShuiBian and you'll see another version of the DPP. KMT supporters are definitely not pro CCP one China. I'd say they want to maintain the status quo, being business with China and Taiwan just left alone. They are not pushing for independence. The DPP is more about pushing for independence but China has been whittling away the last few remaining countries that officially recognize Taiwan as an independent nation. I've got no problem with people who vote kmt Vs DPP, what annoys me is when they twist things to make one party look better than another."

tasmania,fd781r0,t3_ek1vop,1578200646.0,"Can't stress having work lined up enough OR a huge amount of savings to support while looking for work. Tas, more than other places, is about connections. You are a mainlander. You don't know anyone here. You are pushing house prices up. You are turning tas into something some locals do not want. I hope I am wrong and you find full-time work in the first week or so. I'll gladly take it all back. Tas is an amazing place, though. Lonnie or Hobart is where I'd go, mainly due to work. NW Tas is, in my biased opinion, a better place, fewer people, better bang for buck on housing and more stable weather BUT less work. Best of luck."
tasmania,fckxs06,t1_fcjuk5h,1577735474.0,Just gotta drop that T word casually into a sentence like a gangster :-).
tasmania,fch856r,t3_eh5bk2,1577648100.0,"Job lined up, don't need to work or very deep pockets to support for a few years while getting established? Otherwise, NW Tas is great. Climate wise and just my biased opinion :-)."

Couldn't someone move the bed when loading the fire? Embers aren't going to be a risk when the door is closed. As long as the bed is not on the hearth I can't see how it is a fire risk."
aww,fc4x2sh,t1_fc4wutw,1577432078.0,Just like the flammable carpet on the floor? Not to mention the box of flammable cardboard on the right side of the wood heater which some is sitting on the hearth.
