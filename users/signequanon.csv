Most people have at least 3 month notice from the employer if they are let go and it can be up to 18 month (that is rare, though) depending on your contract and how long you have been with the company.

I told her, that when she was a baby, she didn't know how to put on socks or brush her teeth. When she started school, she didn't know how to get there by herself or how to make her lunch or know what homework was due when. When she was 10, she didn't know how to wash her clothes or get off at the right trainstation to grandma. 

Now she knows all of those things, because she learned little by little when she needed to. I didn't know everything when I was 18 or 20 or 25. But I learned little by little and so will you. 

Whenever you need to know something (like how to apply for a job) ask someone or search online for guidance. You may not get it right the first time. Nobody does. 

I am 45 and I bought my first house 5 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing and asked some co-workers with financial insight for advice. They gladly helped me with all my questions. So it is never to late to learn.
