Wipe your ass thoroughly, it's easy to go around inadvertently smelling like sweaty ass juice because you don't wipe thoroughly enough. Shower thoroughly every single day. Scrub your scalp and wash every surface, nook, and cranny from head to toe. Behind the ears, neck, pits, tits, ass, junk, feet, under any folds/love handles, belly button, etc.

If you wear deodorant and cologne but do not wipe your ass or bathe properly you'll just smell like somebody tried to febreeze a filthy house and call it good.

Also don't leave clean laundry on the floor, especially where it gets trampled/stepped on. You don't have to fold it and put it away (it may last longer if you do) but at least put it in a basket out of harm's way and it shouldn't get musty, dirty, and smelly.

Brush your teeth and scrape your tongue, and floss daily. Don't leave food stuck between your teeth, it rots and despite your best efforts will give you awful breath real quick."

The former allows for differences in people's particular situations and acknowledges that a cheater is not always obvious going into a relationship, the latter assumes that men who cheat on their partners are also blatantly mistreating them in other ways or that their 'inevitable cheating' should have been somehow obvious and apparent from the get-go.

Somebody who cheats on you is not necessarily going to come neatly bundled in a package of red flags and abusive behavior. Many a cheater have been busted by a partner/spouse who thought the relationship was happy and largely problem-free, or well into a long-term relationship after noticing problems arise that did not exist before.

I'm actually appalled that a mental health professional would suggest such a dependency-based relationship and validate one's expectation that others are responsible for solving his problems.

So one psychiatrist disagrees and suggests essentially exposure therapy.

This does not mean that people are *trying to make things worse for you* just because one mental health professional in a sea of thousands openly disagrees with the common consensus that it is not fair to expose others to potential abuse if you have unstable moods, excessive paranoia, control issues, etc because most people are not equipped to handle them and 'fix' you.

Leave it to a dependent person, though, to make it everybody else's responsibility to fix him and assume malicious intent when they are well aware that they are not qualified to do so. Additionally, the kind of paranoia that assumes ""people are out to get me"" instead of ""people might be misinformed and I should study this more and find out what is best for me"" is absolutely positively 100% not relationship material.
