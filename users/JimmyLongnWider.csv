Virginia,ffdkc54,t1_ffbv23k,1579822704.0,">Men donâ€™t apply as much and typically do poorer academically.

Why? Is it because they deal with only female teachers in primary? Men have been slipping academically for a long time and I doubt it is because they have somehow gotten stupid. To use your own shoddy logic, men just want to fail academically? Do you think that is true?

So, it's ok for women, military officers, to pass on combat service because, well, who wants to do that?"
Virginia,ffdjy40,t1_ffburfb,1579822467.0,I didn't say underrepresented men. I said men. Like all those programs I saw in college aimed at women in general. Where are the programs aimed at men?
Virginia,ffbt3ng,t1_ffbr3s0,1579781755.0,"I'm saying it is apparently so. Women aren't rushing to combat positions offered to them. Women aren't rushing to fill roles in any number of dangerous occupations that are dominated by men. The only time you see women complaining is when men dominate in high pay, comfortable occupations. Fair is fair. Where are my female garbage collectors? Women are now the majority in college admissions, yet, there are no efforts to 'reach out' to underrepresented men. Quite the contrary, all effort is toward getting more women into higher education."

Virginia,ffbn62s,t1_ffbhy03,1579773743.0,"I don't imagine he was saying he wants women to actually be drafted. Just addressing the glaring unfairness of only men having to do it. In any case, in the few instances where female officers were offered combat posts, for the most part they declined. As it turns out, most women don't really want equality. They want 50% of the comfy jobs. 

This is off on a tangent. I'd be thrilled if ridiculous laws restricting abortion were removed."

Because the only possible solution imaginable for gun proponents is more guns. They won't be happy until everyone is carrying one. They're helpless to imagine any other way. Completely helpless. 

Prove me wrong. Maybe current efforts are ham handed. Propose better ones that aren't ""everyone get a gun and menace everyone around you.""  I can dismiss all your solutions as casually as you dismiss everything proposed so far. But that was the idea, wasn't it?"

He assassinated soleimani just to get a ""squirrel, squirrel!"" moment, so when the election results are showing a firm loss, I think he might gin up another military emergency and argue that he cannot leave while it is going on - which would be forever. 

He has posited that he deserves extra time as president since so much was 'stolen' from him through the Russia investigation and impeachment. Another card he might play. But most likely to me is simply arguing that all the American people that matter are obviously behind him, any election result that doesn't reflect that is fake news and a deep state conspiracy, and anything less than Trump for Life is unacceptable. The Whitehouse will become the Goldhouse, a huge throne will be installed for His Highness and court will be held. I don't know about that last part, we'll have to see what Putin tells him to do."

For example, I have many of the symptoms you describe and I am very strongly left handed...but my right handed sister has them too.

I've been reading for a long time. A very long time. Words. Articles. Shit like your posts. 

So, since you are keen on urging others to up their game or whatever, why don't you try to put on your imagination hat and think of comments online as words coming out of people's mouths. You can apply one thing they say to another, like ""I remember X"" followed by another person saying ""My research says y,"" and then the first person saying ""OK, no argument from me.

thedavidpakmanshow,fe25c5y,t3_encq3j,1578834668.0,"My late father was born just before WWII in Europe and emigrated to Canada and then the US. He has a two year engineering degree of some sort and always did well for himself. He thought of his kids as losers since none of us could seem to do what he did. I tried pretty hard. I had a great paying job and a clear career path after the military and college, but the Great Recession put me out of work for over two years and I never again earned anything like what I was earning before.  I was born in 1969, so I'm a Gen Xer, I suppose. Between my wife and me, we do fine, but we are far from rich. 

The post WWII world was marked by enormous expansion of wealth that Baby Boomers came to believe was normal. It most certainly is not normal. We are living in the new normal. Two income households making ends meet and little hope of amassing any sort of wealth or retirement. There is still a lot of wealth out there but the new normal for companies is very low pay and little or no benefits for workers so that the profits from all that increased productivity can be shoveled upstairs to the coffers of the extremely wealthy, who spend their time changing laws through bought and owned government representatives and legal teams to make sure there is no way to challenge them. I'm old enough to remember when unions were viewed as a way for workers to band together and protect themselves. Today, young workers see unions as some sort of affront to their freedom as a worker. Yeah, you're free. Free to starve in the street."

A little homework and a modest outlay in equipment and quality ingredients has always resulted in better and much more affordable results. Like so many things in the world, I think there are steep diminishing returns on restaurant food. In other words, there is very little difference in a $30 ribeye and a $300 ribeye. A $300 one is certainly not 10X better. If someone wants to pay $1000 for gold foil...have at it."

On almost any given post you have one opinion that catches fire while it might not be based on anything factual at all.
