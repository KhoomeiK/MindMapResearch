I never seen elitist behaviour from arch users, I have however seen people taking ""I use arch"" jokes seriously when all it is is just jokes 

It's common for people to pretend to be elitist arch users for fun, I do it sometimes and usually very exaggerated and theres often one or 2 people who seem to think its really"
technology,ff5iled,t1_ff5icvw,1579594546.0,"Most laptop users dont actually care about graphics card, they want a not too heavy, cheap laptop with decent performance
Dedicated graphic cards take alot of space, so you get a big laptop, they produce lots of heat, and quickly drain the battery and are very expensive 

There are laptops with good graphics cards, but you may have to look a bit more for them"

He allowed you to go on a date, you went one date and did date things: dinner, movie, kiss

Even though, yes that problably shoudnt have gone that far, it was well whitin the lines of what a date is unless defined otherwise

Well, it's possible to manually recover them, but at this point, just make sure your phone is turned off and not in use (the more the phone is used, the more of the video is lost) I'd persoanlly immidietly turn it off or remove the batteries

The speed of light, is the same as speed of causality, which is the max speed that anything in the universe (information) can travel at

Gravity travels at the speed of light and so the planet will only start sailing of at the same time as the sunlight disappears

I'm not an expert on physics so correct me if I'm wrong

The answer to op's question is no, speed of causality is the same as for light, no information/event or anything can move any faster, this humans/earth wont know the moment the sun goes away"

Hmm.. try to.. right click ""my computer""
Click ""manage"" I think
Then device manager
This should show all your devices installed on your machine, find the camera in this list

You should be able to right click and enable it, if its here that he disabled it (you can also re disable it after you are done to hide that you figured it out.. and be ""safe"" as he puts it lol)

Though I kinda doubt its disabled here becuase if a virus was to attempt spying, it could just enable it but itself

Most likely the camera is disabled in bios, that would make it practically impossible for anything to spy on you"
