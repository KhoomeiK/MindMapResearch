magicTCG,feh4djp,t1_fegzmrz,1579108897.0,"I disagree. Regardless of how it was done, at the end of the day Hasbro wanted Chandra to be straight. Weissman could have fluffed it up and made it more palatable, but it's still bi-erasure. It's still a removal of diverse representation for the sake of homophobic audiences. The bad writing simply put a spotlight on the poor creative decisions. Honestly, I think this way is better. Kowtowing to bigotry doesn't deserve good writing."

armoredwomen,fdt9pdn,t3_en0v2u,1578713753.0,"The issue with the codpiece comparison is that, at least to my knowledge, it doesn't make the armor bad at its job. It's not there for a practical purpose, sure, but it's also not actively hindering the wearer or replacing protection with fashion. A codpiece is extra decoration on your armor. Boob plate is BAD armor."

RoleReversal,fcn28rz,t1_fcm5ab2,1577801211.0,"I don't currently have time to read all your links right now, but I do have a point I'd like to quickly address. You ask what I would call someone who has a weird transition. My understanding is that you don't even have to transition to be trans. Transitioning is a good treatment for many of the issues being trans brings, but it's not a necessary step. Trans people are trans regardless of whether or not they actually do anything about it. The only real qualifier is that their gender and their sex don't match up."

RoleReversal,fck4u2r,t1_fcjsy05,1577716627.0,"I mean, Platinumtoast said they have gender dysphoria. That's possibly the biggest sign that someone is actually trans. They also said they were considering transitioning, so it's sensible that someone who's done that would pitch in their two cents on the matter."
