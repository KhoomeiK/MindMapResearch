knifeparty,fdtnnr3,t3_elx5k4,1578719403.0,I mean he stilll sings kinda serious in Begin Again. But there’s a lot more humour in KP overall definitely.
knifeparty,fdml1dl,t3_ekm17w,1578553912.0,"Unison and Last Time remixes. They were released around the same time as the first two EPs so they seem to have been overshadowed by the hype of that, but they are every bit as good."
selfimprovement,fd20yu9,t3_efvbgb,1578139951.0,"Hey man, can I be added please?"
Pendulum,fct5q2d,t1_fc2otua,1577933564.0,WTF?! those aren't rob's vocals? I always thought that was his voice just heavily processed. I'm shook.
selfimprovement,fcqvyz6,t1_fck7aef,1577893043.0,"Wow I massively relate to this especially about the music stuff and losing something that feels personal to you. Electronic music used to be quite a niche thing that required brains to be good at, now its  become absolutely inundated with FL Studio wielding 14 year olds who don’t have a musical bone in their body. What can you do eh?"
selfimprovement,fcokong,t3_ehlumt,1577834652.0,"Wow I really had no idea this would get so many replies. I probably can't respond to every one but I just wanna say thankyou to everyone for your advice and input, it means a lot. I've skimmed through and upvoted them all but it will take some time to digest everything that's been said here. But yeah, massive thanks to you all. :)"
