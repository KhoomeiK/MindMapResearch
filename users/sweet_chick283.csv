You are right in that they technically would not have run out of money yet, but their portfolio is in a death spiral (down to < 60%) if they had a withdrawal rate above 2.5%, and for their portfolio to have maintained capital value, excluding inflation, they need a withdrawal rate of less than 1.5%.

I fully appreciate that your 14 year old friend can't  afford to be a father right now- but it's not really his choice at this point. It's 100% up to his girlfriend as to whether she has an abortion or continues the pregnancy.

The thing to remember is it is HER choice.

changemyview,fdb4vsr,t3_ek8xy4,1578253861.0,"Drinking to get drunk is not only associated with a range of health problems, both short term and long term, but a massive increase in risk of violence - both in terms of the likelihood of being the victim and being the perpetrator.

This increase is particularly notable for men. 

Did you know 85% of male rapists note alcohol use to the point of intoxication within 1-2 hours of committing their offence?

Let that sink in for a minute. 85%.

Obviously we can't conclude from that statistic that the crime would not have been committed without alcohol. Alcohol doesn't put new ideas in anyone's head, it just lowers the inhibition and makes people feel like they have license to act on their impulses.

But, given the well established evidence that alcohol lowers inhibition (particularly social inhibition) we also have to consider that at least some of these crimes would never have happened without the alcohol in the mix.

And OP, I'm certainly not accusing you of anything or saying that you have done something socially unacceptable as a result of drinking to get drunk.

But I would argue that the potential social cost of drinking to get drunk, in terms of the increased risk of violence in our society, is too high and therefore drinking to get drunk should not be socially acceptable."

ABoringDystopia,fcu6y95,t1_fcu4kzd,1577974033.0,"Thanks for your comment!

I agree. One day, in the future, was can in theory go 100% renewable. But we just don't have the infrastructure yet. 

Adjusting the load on a steam turbine generator is ridiculously easy and quick, as is on a gas turbine generator. We've been doing it safely and reliably for years. It's nearly impossible to adjust the load on hydro generators or wind generators (you technically can do it over the period of a few days but my god it's difficult). And storing solar, say by molten salts, not only has a huge environmental impact in the setup, but has other MAJOR safety risks.

Even when it is theoretically possible - say by replacing a hospitals emergency diesel generator with a battery bank- it may not meet the acceptable risk of failure on demand in terms of reliability.

Social acceptability prevents us from replacing much of our domestic power infrastructure with nuclear, which would allow load balancing with almost 0 carbon impact.

The problem with those sources is that they don't take in to consideration that the sun doesn't shine all day and night every day, and the wind doesn't blow all the time... and we just don't have the infrastructure to have batteries that would keep, say, a medium sized city going for 10 hours on a windless night.

Scotland managed to go for 2 hours on 100% renewable energy last year- and the only way they were able to do that was by leveraging the UK power grid to allow them to load balance.

Your sources are talking about what we might have, one day, in the future. I'm talking about what we, globally, can do right now. And reusing what we have - whether it's oil wells, clothes, electronics, books, furniture, or whatever- is far better environmentally than making new ones."
ABoringDystopia,fcu3rfa,t3_eiw1xr,1577971744.0,"Ok... So please don't hate on me too much for saying this... but please just hear me out. 

Rightly or wrongly, there are 7 billion people on this planet with (for most of them) the infrastructure set up in such a way to rely very heavily on hydrocarbon based energy.

Fundamentally, civilization is not yet in a place to have full reliance on ""green"" power (now I use the term loosely as the impact of the mining and refining of the catalysts and components to generate renewable power is rarely considered, and the environmental impact of things like platinum and lithium mining and refining is NOT pretty). 

We also can't peak load balance (at least, not yet and not with the infrastructure we currently have). 

As such, Without at least some hydrocarbon based fuels, our society doesn't function. Ambulances can't get patients to hospital in an emergency. Hospital emergency generators can't keep the lights on without diesel to supply their generators. There is literally no way of making aviation fuel without oil, so no way of Medevac-ing someone in an emergency. Many of the drugs and tools people rely on for survival are (at least in part) derived from hydrocarbon based components, and at the moment, we have no way of deriving these components from any source other than oil or gas. 

In terms of the environmental impact, finding a way to reuse the wells and infrastructure that's already in place is WAY less harmful than drilling a new well. It reduces the CO2 footprint of a barrel of oil by about 1/3 if you can take it from an existing well rather than drilling a new one, and by even more if you would have to build new roads etc to access it.

This is amplified if it involves CO2 reinjection as it's effectively turning an old oil field into a way of sequestering CO2.

Fundamentally- if you want to stop the use of oil and gas- help develop a way to create Avgas from renewables; or help develop renewable technology that can be ramped up and down really quickly to allow us to get away from gas turbines for grid peak load balancing; or help develop an emergency generator based on renewables that can be installed locally at essential infrastructure (hospitals, nursing homes etc) and look at the logistics of doing this.

So. TLDR. Oil is shit for the environment. We can reduce its use and we must reduce its use if we as a species and a planet are going to survive. But we don't have a way to avoid using it unless we are prepared to compromise the health and wellbeing of the weakest members of our society.

Its much less harmful to get the most use out of what we already have than to throw something away and write it off and buy a new one instead."

I'm so sorry to hear that you are going through such a tough time.

I'm not a professional in this area - but your 11 year old sounds almost exactly like me at her age.  

One thing I really wish had been around when I was your kids age is Circle of Security training for parents.

At 11, kids are testing the rules they used to think are immutable. They are going through massive changes in their brain structure, and are picking up on signals in ways they never have before. It's a wild, overwhelming, confusing time for anyone going through those changes.

This constant deluge of new perceptions, subtle gradations of emotions and hormonal changes makes emotional regulation HARD. Oh and their friends are going through the exact same thing, too, turning social situations into a pressure cooker environment. They might feel a bit like the whole world is ganging up on them.

So how do they let their anger and frustration and fear out? Why, by taking it out on someone they trust to love them no matter what, of course! You have to remember this, when they are making you want to tear your hair out- this is the highest sign of trust and love a (pre)teenager can give. They are venting that anger at someone who they trust to love them, no matter what.

I know it doesn't make their general shittiness and aggression any easier to handle. You have a right to feel safe, and to be treated as a human being.

But hopefully this perspective on the situation will give you some ideas on how to move forward. At this point, there is no magic bullet that will fix their behaviour- the only thing you can do is work together to build your relationship with them. Let them know that you know things are rough at the moment, but you want to be their safe person, and you want to build trust with each other. But you have needs, too, and you need to feel safe - ask them if they are willing to work together with you to work towards making sure your disagreements are constructive and respectful, and making your relationship stronger. Ask them what they think they need from you to do this - chances are, it won't be a realistic request, but chances are you will be able to reframe it to make a commitment to meet them half way. For example, they might say they need to be treated like an adult. An appropriate response might be ""I absolutely agree you're not a little kid any more. Sometimes I forget that. There's lots of steps to take to be treated like an adult. Shall we think about them out together and come up with a list of privileges and responsibilities you're ready for, and what you can do to work towards earning the rest?"" Most importantly, whatever you agree, you MUST honor it - and gently and respectfully hold them to account when they fail to honor their side of the bargain.

  When things are getting heated, stay calm - let them know you won't let them hurt themselves, or you, but otherwise you are going to give them the support - or space - they need to get to a calmer place where they can talk about the feelings underneath their actions. Ask them whether they need support or space, and respect what they say. If you get angry - know that it happens and there is nothing wrong with that. Own your feelings. Model the behaviour you want to see. Say, ""sweetheart, I love you. I'm feeling angry right now, and I need space to calm down."" And leave the room of its safe to do so. 

 Then, when you and they are calm enough to talk, ask them if they need you to listen or to help them work through something. Again, respect what they say. If they want you to help solve the problem, tease out the issue but also their feelings about the issue. Most of the time, the most effective goal is to help them see a different perspective on the underlying issue so they can better manage their emotions.

There will always be ups and downs. But if you can repair and strengthen the relationship, the downs will be much more manageable. 

Circle of Security will give you some ideas about how to build and repair your relationship. Oh, and it's the only parenting program backed up by evidence.

You are doing amazing! I promise this won't last forever!"

It earns the equivalent to your mortgage interest rate, it's immediately available for redraw in an emergency and it's easy to set up.
