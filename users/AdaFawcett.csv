Remember everyone is different and you find what works for you. If it doesn't work then something else will and you will get there.
I'm not on the same drug as you (I have Sertraline, I think it's Zoloft in the US, for depression/anxiety) but from one medicated 20-something woman to another, I'm on Reddit pretty much every day, and happy to listen if you need an outlet.  Feel free to DM me or whatever. It's rubbish when you feel isolated because of illness and worse when you feel your only source of information doesn't help. You're not alone in this, and you can do it. I know it's super cheesy but believe in you."

When I worked on the tills next to those lifts we had people press the button, stand for 5 minutes and then wander over to the tills and say ""Your lifts aren't working.""

interestingasfuck,fe0ffik,t1_fe00j6p,1578812501.0,"In terms of how it sounds, I think Old English sounds closer to Welsh. Not linguistically at all, but old English is a really musical language. It's got that lilt to it you get in Welsh and in the Scandinavian languages. 
In terms of grammar and structure, it's very similar to modern German because old English and old German are basically identical, but old English had 300 years of enforced French added to it, whereas old German did not! 
Sorry for the splurge, I studied Old English in uni and I bloody love it, don't get a lot of opportunity to talk about it, funnily enough!

interestingasfuck,fe0ejfu,t1_fe0bvl6,1578811922.0,"Old English is more closely related to German now in terms of the grammar and structure. For example, the old English past tense of the verb 'to go' is gegongen (that first g is pronounced like a y). German past tense of 'to go' is gegangen. They have a lot of other similarities too. It's Anglo-Saxon which originated in what is now Germany.
The closest language we have now though, as modern German has evolved too, is Tolkien's elvish. Tolkien was an Anglo-Saxon scholar and took inspiration from it to create elvish."

AskReddit,fdov98v,t3_elszb8,1578613655.0,"TL;Dr: King Louis XVI had to be taught, by his brother-in-law, how to consummate his marriage, 7 years after the wedding. 

King Louis XVI (him of the 1789 French Revolution guillotine fame) was not intended to be King and so was not educated in monarchy stuff. His older brother died before he could inherit, propelling a very unprepared Louis to the position of Dauphin. There were many things Louis did not learn which he could have done with, some of which contributed to his eventual date with Madame Guillotine.

One of the strangest though,was that he didn't know how to have sex. This is part of the reason that he and Marie Antoinette didn't consummate their marriage for seven years. 

Eventually, Marie wrote to her family, concerned that she wasn't knocked up yet, and her brother, the Austrian Emperor popped over to have a chat with Louis. On discovering that he would simply get hard, get inside Marie and stay completely still for around 2 minutes before pulling out and going to sleep, I can only imagine the face palming which ensued. The Emperor then gave the 23 year old Louis instructions on how to properly bone his, the Emperor's, little sister and a year later they had their first kid. 

Louis was apparently a very good amateur astronomer though.

wokekids,fc54rec,t1_fc4cx1s,1577443110.0,"The other one that shocked me is that medication trials often exclude women who are in an abnormal hormonal state, i.e. menstruating or pregnant, because a change in hormones can affect how medications work. 

The pregnancy one is more understandable because of potential harm to foetuses (although that feels like something that medical companies really should be looking into to prevent another situation like Thalidomide!) But menstruating? It's not an abnormal hormonal state, it's pretty usual! Obviously there are exceptions, but menstruating women should be included, because if it causes the medication to be less effective or more dangerous, or just have nastier side effects, that's a fair amount of the population screwed over!
