MensRights,fclvvtj,t1_fclviin,1577757739.0,"I had a woman give me shit for letting a door close behind me when I took the stairs, and I had no idea she was that close behind me.  she apparently had ran up the stairs to try to get through the door I had opened, after I was already going through it, because she didn’t want to have to get her security badge out of her purse and open it herself... this really annoyed me since the entire reason I took the stairs was because I didn’t want to deal with people at the time and the next thing I knew she was in my office bitching at me."
MensRights,fcluznh,t3_ehvkly,1577757116.0,"I’ve never seen this “manslamming” at all unless being done as a joke by someone I know... male strangers, even if they do not actually look at me or otherwise acknowledge my presence, will typically move as to avoid an issue and I likewise do the same for them.  similarly I hold open doors as most men do for me.  

now as for female strangers... there have been times where they clearly expected me to bow down as they passed (not literally but you know the attitude I am referencing) and and I have often stopped dead in my tracks and waited for them to actually go around me in situations where I couldn’t go around them.  likewise when approaching them they are more likely to not bother moving out of the way, in grocery stores they are much more likely to be blocking the entire aisle with their cart on one side while the stand next to it looking for something on the other side.  it is very rare for me to have to say “excuse me” to a man, but common when its a woman.  also, when walking behind women they are far more likely to stop suddenly in front of me and make me nearly run in to them.  or as I try to walk past them they suddenly move in a way that blocks me or they occasionally even run in to me.  I’m not some short, scrawny, easy to miss guy either.

I don’t think this is necessarily a case of attitude issues with the women I describe, and certainly not all women are like that.  I think it’s mostly a case of “men are more aware of their surroundings”, or maybe women are just more oblivious (maybe this is an instinct from prehistoric times when men were the literal protectors of the tribe?).  throw in a few with actual attitude issues and voila... current day society.

oh, and as for holding doors... I can’t remember ever having a guy let a door slam in my face when I was nearby behind him, but women do it often."

techsupport,fc5vkqh,t3_egbepb,1577466832.0,"looking through the answers, basically they are telling you everything you need to know but it's kinda all over the place and maybe not very clear.  

since you have an add-in GPU, the PC will default to using that over the things built in to the motherboard.  that is why some people are saying you must plug in to the HDMI port on the GPU.  Alternatively, if you remove the GPU, the on board ports should automatically start working as it no longer detects an add-on GPU.  note:  to remove a PCI-E GPU like that, there is a little tab that must be pressed or pushed down to release it... do not just try to yank it out!  that tab can sometimes be very hard to see/reach but it will be at the back of the slot the GPU is seated in on the motherboard.  and by ""back "" of the slot I mean the side farthest away from the back side of the PC.

The easiest solution would be to go to a store (or order on amazon) and ask for an HDMI to DVI adapter.  a store like bestbuy should have one.  walmart probably does too... fred meyers does, if you have them in your area.  there are different versions of that adapter... I would get the one that has an HDMI end, about 4 inches of ""cable"" and then the DVI end.  the smaller ones that are kinda trapezoid shaped will work as long as you never try to uncover and use one of the ports next to it for a second monitor, however they tend to get knocked loose very easily, and as I implied in my previous sentence, they take up too much room if you want to use the next port over and will block you from using it."
