thebachelor,ff4x86u,t3_ermsy9,1579574620.0,Peter and Hannah really are a good match. They both get stuck on one topic and ruin the night for everyone because of said one topic

fatlogic,ff4qysp,t3_ermqnt,1579570325.0,"> this is targeting me personally 

Kind of funny considering most FAs take EVERYTHING personally even when it has absolutely nothing to do with them"

Floribama,felm84l,t1_felm4ag,1579225529.0,"From what I’ve seen posted on this sub regarding their social media activity, I’d say it is not squashed. For the shows sake, I hope it is so we don’t have to spend more time watching a petty Gus"

Floribama,fe39pmh,t1_fe38mjw,1578847254.0,"Completely agree. He comes across very manipulative and narcissistic, his behavior isn’t normal"
Floribama,fe36jma,t3_enk44w,1578846477.0,"I love how he then lied about what Jeremiah paid for saying he paid for the soup himself or something and the show played back Jeremiah saying he’ll pay for the sake, appetizer and one roll. Does Gus fail to realize he’s being filmed? He has been caught lying so many times this season. And then going off that Jeremiah “let” Mattie pay for him.. no, you let Mattie pay for YOUR food because you’re a petty bitch. ETA: also, Mattie was on the “losing” team and since “the losers” pay for “the winners”, they should be allowed to choose how to split the check. That was the deal. It wasn’t stated from the beginning that “hey, if we win, Jeremiah and only Jeremiah pays for me to eat the whole menu! 🤪” The three of them should have been on one check anyway and said check should have been split 4 ways. Jeremiah didn’t lose any more than the other three people on his team, he shouldn’t have been fucked over like that. I’m starting to dislike the entire cast 



I can only imagine how many lies he has spewed throughout his years that he got away with when there’s no camera crew following him around. Pathological liars/exaggerators are the worst"
Floribama,fdxt77s,t1_fdwp09z,1578772652.0,He probably picked this photo specifically because Jeremiah looks so bad/unlike himself

curlyhair,fcktecw,t3_efv8cs,1577732785.0,"Seeking some personal opinion: My little sister (16) has curly hair and no one else in my family does (I’m 28 and live in a different state but saw her over the holidays). She has nice hair but cares for it how you would care for straight hair and it definitely doesn’t look as nice as it could with proper care. She keeps it in a pony tail most days because it’s “frizzy”

Would you have been offended at 16 if a sibling purchased you a starter kit with products and care instructions to get the full potential out of your hair? I have to do my research here first as I’m completely clueless about curly hair but I want to help her out as much as I can without offending her or making her feel like I find her hair “ugly” (which I obviously don’t)

Any opinion is greatly appreciated!"
fatlogic,fbqghvt,t1_fbq2qbv,1577031486.0,It’s unhealthy for males to have a body fat under 5% so I doubt your friend’s husband is at 3%. Insanely ripped male bodybuilders might drop down to 3-4% for competitions but it’s unusual otherwise to be that low
