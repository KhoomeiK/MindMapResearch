boy was he surprised

ate a lotta pie

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff24245,t1_ff04w3x,1579493230.0,"> almost everyone can agree that naked women are fun to look at

I don't know how many straight women and gay men think naked women are fun to look at. I'm pretty sure most of us are more inured to it than anything.

The complaint also wasn't just about naked women everywhere in art, but the same basic naked woman. Different ages have different ideal female bodies, but ours is Betty and Veronica. The proportions are not only strained, but sometimes actually off in order to emphasize the sexy parts. It's not just boring, it's bad art.

The post was also asking if other people were annoyed by it. She wasn't complaining about only seeing boring stuff. OP wanted to see if she were unusual, and she already has unsubscribed to r/Art. She was saying that a great deal of popular art reduces women to sex parts and that she finds that disturbing. Why should she not share that opinion?"
AreTheStraightsOK,ff204pk,t3_er3883,1579490276.0,"Wait. So straight men shouldn't like the part of the body that surrounds the genitalia, and one of the structurally slightly different parts of the body between men and women.

In this model, Jews control everyone else by selling us degenerate movies and music that lead to mass misery. This misery makes non-Jews buy antidepressants, drugs, weapons, porn, flashy jewellery, abortions, and so on, all of which deepen our despair, ensure our continued dependence, and bring in profit to the Jewish elite that sells those things.

Left to our own Aryan devices, the story goes, we'd all live like Ozzy and Harriet, crime rates would drop, we'd live simply but fully, and all deserving white guys would get laid by their young, slender, and submissive wives three times a night. Non-whites would go back to happily working the worst jobs for the least pay.

Unfortunately, we brilliant, hard-working, and clean-living Aryans are too stupid and trusting to resist the siren call of *Captain Marvel* and *Black Panther.* As a result, women are now uppity.

Did this clear anything up or is it even more confusing?"
cringepics,fefb5cn,t1_fef8pqr,1579052443.0,"2) may be true, but there are still limits. As for that ...

As to 3), he's treating her like he has access to her. Read the comments from women throughout this thread and the last one: many women get men asking them out in the dumbest places, and the more inappropriate the request, the more you wonder how you're going to deal with a rejection. The guy who has your address and thinks it's okay to ask customers out already showed he doesn't understand what boundaries are.

If you saw a crucifix on a customer's wall, would you send them an invitation to your Baptist church? If you saw that they ordered a set of bathroom shelves, would you text them about your cousin's bath bomb and candle business? No, because that would be weird. That's getting in their private business. You don't do whatever you feel like wherever you are because that's not what you do. You don't run a side business or try to convert people on work time and in their own homes with no warning or consent. It's part of the whole ""look but don't touch"" thing.

This is where it comes back to point 2). Women get enough unwanted sexual attention in public. They don't need it in their own houses, the place you're supposed to feel safest. When you couple that with the small but significant numbers of guys who don't take ""no"" for an answer and you've already established he doesn't understand boundaries, you assume you've got a guy who seems to think that if he sees something or someone he likes, he can make a metaphorical grab for it or her.

It's about the safety of the people he works with. To you this may not look like a threat, but this doesn't look like a little ""oopsie, aren't I a big dumb romantic idiot"" to women, it looks like the first scene in a trite horror movie.

If the lesson he takes from this is not ""damn, I fucked up"" or ""man, IKEA sucks"" but ""I hate women,"" then his problems are bigger than this one incident."

3) This isn't brain surgery. This is teaching a toddler that the whole world doesn't belong to them, and that when they're out in public they can't just grab what they want without regard to the situation."
cringepics,fef77lr,t1_feeyv0r,1579049812.0,"It's not excessive. This is misusing a customer's personal information at the very least. At the worse end, women worry that a person who's probably bigger and stronger than them now has a fixation on them and might do start harassing or even threatening them. In the first thread, the women posted about how creepy this was and many said it had happened to them and they had been too scared to inform the company.

As far as that goes, it used to be that companies assumed that for every person who expressed an opinion, good or bad, that meant 10 more people had the same opinion but hadn't bothered to write or call. Maybe that's changed in the era of easy online complaints. I bet they assume this guy has done this before and they hadn't heard of it, or maybe he definitely has done it before and they're going off that. The stories on here suggest people aren't reporting it every time. Companies probably know that, especially companies who make home deliveries to a lot of women, like IKEA.

If you think women are being too paranoid here, think of every online conversation you've seen on rape. There are always people who put it on the women to live their lives in fear: don't look too sexy but don't look like a guy. Don't go out at night. Don't drink alone. Don't drink in groups with people you don't know. Don't go off with strange men. You're supposed to spend your life keeping men from using you as a sex urinal. About the creepiest thing a guy can do is letting you know is he's going out of his way to get at you.

There are times and places to ask people out. This isn't one of them."

exredpill,fedx1ln,t1_fedtgwk,1579021697.0,"Who's ""we""? Who sees this happening? There are insecure women who expect abuse, but the whole ""hot chick is so used to compliments that being treated like dirt turns her on"" makes no sense to me. I don't go to bars any more, but when I did I never saw anyone try this, nor would I expect it to work.

I thought even the PUA people say that you may have to do it dozens of times to get it to work once. Is that going to have a better hit rate than talking to a woman like a human being? Like, ""So where do you work? What's that like? Do you run into a lot of [X]?"" or asking about the music that's on or her favourite beer or what she's wearing or literally almost anything other than ""Hi. So ... uh ... let's fuck?""

You know where I see redpill shit in action? In the women's subreddits, where they talk about leaving an emotionally abusive partner. You hear the whole nine yards: his calculated insults, his silence, his emotional distance, his high expectations and low response, his implication he might just go bang another woman, his surveillance over her actions. It's fucking terrible.

You know who's actually confident? The people who don't need to micromanage every situation and who don't treat other people like poon dispensers with tricky interfaces."

The human brain loves patterns and especially loves faces, which makes sense, as the difference between dead and alive could be seeing a hidden predator's face. It's easy to see faces in things. This one isn't very clear and it doesn't make sense why he'd hide a monstrous face in a story about a saint tormented by visions of, here, monsters. (Now, were it a naked woman, maybe, since Anthony was supposedly plagued by visions of lust.) Add to that the design of the painting, with the demon heads in a row pointing to the main tormentor, who in turn is looking at the saint — those heads make seeming eyes, and once you have eyes, you're halfway to seeing a face. Plus, that larger possible face isn't doing anything for the image that the crowd of demons doesn't already do, which is to lead the eyes to the lead torturer.

More and more schools have a policy that says you can even erase the failing mark so long as you pass it later and the failing course was in the first year of your degree, which in most cases means the first quarter of the total number of courses you need to take. Always check with your program, though, as some degrees take more total courses than others and the number of credits per course varies by institution.

If you fail the same course too many times, you may be able to sub in another course, though it will affect your GPA. If it's a required course, you may have to change programs altogether. If you keep flunking required courses in all the degree programs you pick, you just plain flunk out, which usually means you're dead. You might be able to scrape together some sort of certificate, which would at least let you work as a test subject in a lab or maybe even a biological weapon, if they can keep you upright long enough to get you onto the field where you explode and infect the enemy. This is outlawed by the Geneva Convention, but if you flunk that many courses of antibiotics, you're probably not that bright, plus whatever brain you had is literally rotted away, so you won't know you're committing war crimes. We'll all know, though, and are already very disappointed in you.
