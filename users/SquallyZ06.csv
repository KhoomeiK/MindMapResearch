SAM flows much smoother and your rotation feels faster. It's fairly simple to play effectively and it does great damage."
todayilearned,femgv7f,t1_femav4n,1579254859.0,"It happens daily so I wouldn't say it's rare. Uncommon? No because it's a daily occurrence depending on the time of day.

Chikan are more rare but still a thing and reported in the JP news often.

Source: Live in Tokyo right now."
todayilearned,femgkc4,t1_femghpz,1579254402.0,I live in Tokyo and take the train often so....

todayilearned,fem74cq,t1_fem3yd0,1579242133.0,"Pissed on? No but drunk Japanese salarymen like to pee on the street sometimes so I wouldn't be surprised if at some point in time someone was peed on by another person on a train in Japan.

I'm assuming you're trying to say trains in countries outside of Japan are worse? That wasn't the intention of my reply, just that there are rude folks on Japanese trains too. But if we're gonna have a dick measuring contest Japan just recently had a fatal knife attack last year on the shinkansen train in 2019. Oh and of course there was the famous sarin gas attack, I'd say both of those are worse than getting peed on."
todayilearned,fem38q7,t1_fem1f06,1579238289.0,"There are plenty of rude folks on trains in Tokyo. From drunk salary men falling over to people talking loudly among each other/on the phone and even the nefarious chikan groper.

:edit: people seem to think I'm trying to compare Japan to other countries. I'm not, simply saying there are rude Japanese people on trains in Japan. I live in Tokyo and see it first hand."
AirForce,fem14pl,t1_fekwgd5,1579236381.0,"This. While we didn't have Balfour Beatty at Shaw it was privatized. Other than some charges for some frayed carpet caused by our dogs and a damaged toilet seat, I got part of my deposit back and they weren't super strict on their inspection. Just took care of the house and did everything on the list prior to our inspection.

The people who have major issues and complain the loudest probably had nasty houses. Nasty people usually don't realize they're nasty until someone else points it out."
AirForce,feexnxp,t3_eokwzu,1579043465.0,What's crazy is you get different levels of customer service depending on your rank. If you're high enough rank (SNCO or officer) those little fresh customer service airmen at the MPF are quick to take care of all of your needs.
ShitpostXIV,fdul6gi,t1_fdrjeze,1578734664.0,I almost reported a white mage because their raise macro was similar to RMT spam. Gave them a comm after noticing it was serious.

AirForce,fdcspdv,t1_fdcs98z,1578283229.0,"Sure thing, I'm sure our exchange will make for great conversations in whatever conservative safe space you frequent online snowflake."
AirForce,fdcotr4,t1_fdcntc9,1578280276.0,Asking for clarification is not being disingenuous but ok.
AirForce,fdclcws,t1_fdck8ta,1578277770.0,"Now you say you don't approve, before you just said one was worse and were dismissive of Saudi funded terrorism. Which is why I called it hypocritical but now I see you're just ok with the Saudis doing it because they're our ""allies"". Which would make you a hypocrite IMO but whatever, you've made up your mind.

This whole situation is crazy when you think about it. Let's not forget Iran is the way it is because of what the US and it's allies did in the 50s to force regime change and install a dictatorship that was brutal (but a US ally) and overthrown by their current Theocracy."
AirForce,fdcivy0,t1_fdcik8i,1578276010.0,"I read your comment smart ass, I'm pointing out that it's hypocritical to not be equally outraged at Saudi funding state terrorism as people are about Iran.

But I'm talking to a brick wall at this point, no point in wasted effort."
AirForce,fdcg05g,t1_fdcfu5v,1578273975.0,"So you don't think wealthy Saudis funding attacks on Americans is an issue? Don't you think it's a tad bit hypocritical to condemn Iran for the same thing the Saudis turn a blind eye to?

:edit: pretty sure there are links between the royal family funding groups like Al-Qaeda."
AirForce,fdcfjqs,t1_fdc736z,1578273655.0,They literally flew the planes into the WTC and fund extremism groups like the Taliban and Al-Qaeda so can you really say Iran is better?
AirForce,fdc53vl,t1_fdbrb9e,1578267281.0,"r/AirForce isn't for discussion, it's for memes and shit posting."
AirForce,fdc4nmx,t1_fdbxeji,1578267031.0,Sounds similar to Saudi Arabia.

AirForce,fcj4jlj,t1_fcbzlsr,1577677101.0,"Most adults can't tell you shit from civics courses they took years ago so I wouldn't use that as a bar to determine voting age. 

Hell, most adults can't tell you shit about how the government is supposed to work but they all still vote."
modernwarfare,fbn5bld,t1_fbn558z,1576992932.0,Because you're just making up anecdotal stories at this point because you hate cash shops?
