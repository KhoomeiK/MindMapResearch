I kind of blame the Chinese government because 1. the one child law may have been the reason I was abandoned in the first place and 2. the orphanage probably violated so many damn health codes. I also have been told that in China, boys are favoured over girls and the thought that I was possibly abandoned over that makes me so angry. And as you said, despite my feelings toward China, I still really want to be accepted and belong. Thank you for talking the time to analyze what I wrote because it makes me realize I have to let go of the grudges I‚Äôm holding and all the thoughts of what would of happened if I was raised by the bio parents.

AmItheAsshole,fcmaweu,t3_ehxb52,1577769065.0,"YTA. 

In some circumstances like how in Afghanistan the Taliban force women to wear a Burqu(I think this is the correct term, I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs not) it is oppressive because they aren‚Äôt given the choice to choose. 

Women who chose with their own free will to wear a hijab aren‚Äôt being oppressed though. It‚Äôs their body, their choice. They‚Äôre doing it for personal reasons they don‚Äôt have to explain and that we shouldn‚Äôt question. 

It‚Äôs all about choice. Whether they choose to wear it or are being forced to. I understand there is a stereotype that muslim women are oppressed and mistreated by men but that‚Äôs not always the case. Women of all religions can be mistreated, men of all religions can be mistreated."

Why tf is she trying to compete with your child? The kid should be both of your top priorities. Honestly she‚Äôs acting childish. Just because you love your daughter doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt love your wife.

suggestmeabook,fcjfxyj,t3_dxhei2,1577686158.0,"the Guests Of War trilogy by Kit Pearson. 

It‚Äôs set during World War 2. A pair of siblings are evacuated from England to Toronto, Canada as War Guests because England is unsafe. Their host family favours the younger sibling more than the protagonist (who‚Äôs perspective the story is told from.)"
suggestmeabook,fcjfb06,t3_ehe89g,1577685519.0,"The Mortal Instruments by Cassandra Clare is a pretty good series. She also wrote a trilogy(kind of like a prequel) set in Victorian England called The Infernal Devices. TID is one of my favourite series of all time with TMI being in the top 5. Her newest series, The Dark Artifices, I don‚Äôt like as much but it‚Äôs still a good read. 

I just got a book called Caraval for Hannukah this year and I love it. It‚Äôs a trilogy, the 3rd book came out recently I believe. It‚Äôs about these two sisters who escape from their abusive father to see Caraval, a magical performance that they‚Äôve wanted to see since they were children."
suggestmeabook,fcjekqb,t3_eh6kz5,1577684819.0,"Cirque Du Freak was amazinggg. 

I personally love The Infernal Devices by Cassandra Clare. It‚Äôs a trilogy all about demon fighting in Victorian England with 3 loveable main characters. 

I just started Caraval by Stephanie Garner and it‚Äôs amazing. It‚Äôs a fantasy adventure type trilogy. It‚Äôs about these two sisters who go to see Caraval, a magical performance that‚Äôs run by a kinda evil immortal dude. 

Beyonders by Brandon Mull is also very good but directed at a younger audience. I think my library has it in the 9-12 section, but it‚Äôs amazing regardless. It‚Äôs also a trilogy."
