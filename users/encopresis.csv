Provided you don't have a lot of medical or psychiatric comorbidities, no real prerequisites to meet."
educationalgifs,fe400q2,t1_fe3lj99,1578854503.0,"In my experience, the only potentially functionally beneficial ones are brow lift or upper lid blepharoplasty.

The number of patients with functional rather than cosmetic concerns are fairly small."

Practically? There are often better areas for harvest with better quality fat."
educationalgifs,fe2x5os,t1_fe2v5f2,1578843838.0,"You could probably delay it by a bit, but the main problem is that as you get older, the muscle thins, and also, the two halves of the muscle tends to separate at the midline. This is what causes the banding that causes the appearance of a droopy neck area. Unfortunately, the only good fix for this is to surgically repair it."
educationalgifs,fe2w7u6,t1_fe27hyd,1578843532.0,"As others have mentioned, yes - it's called fat grafting."
educationalgifs,fe2vvar,t1_fe2kzvt,1578843382.0,"Yes - there are localized surgical options depending on what you are trying to correct.

There are also non surgical options such as Botox and fillers, which address different problems. The problem is that a lot of people are going for the 'over corrected look' popularized by celebrities. You can get very natural corrections with appropriate application of product and technique."
educationalgifs,fe2sjsx,t1_fe25dj1,1578842400.0,Yep - it's called a platysmaplasty. It's intended to tighten up the muscles under your chin / upper neck so that it appears less droopy.

Happy to answer any questions about the actual procedures that can be done though, sans food references."
medizzy,fctq34u,t1_fct77dp,1577953706.0,"You may want to get a second opinion.

Amputation is a very last line option for Dupuytren's. You have a number of different options available for you before then.

Dupuytren's will always recur - its a question of the recurrence rates at 5 years. 

I am speaking from the perspective of someone who has managed Dupuytren's, but as always, this is for general information only, and is not intended as medical advice and does not intend to be a replacement for proper assessment, diagnosis and treatment by a medical professional."
medizzy,fctpdqo,t1_fct2tvi,1577952736.0,That's an armored ETT.
todayilearned,f2oqhiy,t1_f2op9ae,1570331979.0,"Let's paint you a picture.

How easy is it to get a 7 year old to sit still for 30 minutes, without fidgeting?

Now, how easy would it be to have a 7 year sit still, after you put a needle into the bottom of their foot, multiple times, to freeze the area?

I agree with you - it would be ideal to do it under local anesthetic. But medicine is all about balancing risk vs. benefit, and it's not safe for me to be operating with sharp instruments in a child that's moving around."
