Maybe I'm reading it wrong (edit: I was), but I think your math is off, since you're assuming it's 2015 in your calculations, and the lifespan of the 2015 Camry is just beginning, which it isn't. The reworked numbers only prove your case more, of course! Here's what they shake out to be, but please let me know if I'm missing something as to why you didn't use them in the first place. 

>...Well, let's look at it over the life of the vehicle. Let's assume an average Camry lasts until the car is 13 years old.
>
>2015 Camry LE = $22,800/13 = $1,754/yr

If we assume a 2015 Camry will live till 2028, then it's only got 8 years left (9 if we disregard that we're at the end of December 2019), so I think that math should read, **2015 Camry** is **$22,800/8 = $2,850/yr**

>2011 Camry LE = $14,300/9 = $1,589/yr (I divide by 9, because the car is already 4 years old)
>

And for the same reason mentioned above, if we're gonna say the 2011 Camry will last till 2024, then she's got just 4 years left till you're shopping again. The math then would be **2011 Camry, $14,300/4 = $3575/yr**, meaning the older one is actually *more* per year now, and we're getting a worse deal buying the older model at that price.
