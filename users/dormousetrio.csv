Exercise,ffal6wv,t3_esgo3o,1579738521.0,"The only advice I have is to find some kind of exercise that you enjoy. (Sounds impossible, I know. I feel like I break out in hives when I think about exercising. So much loathing.) It doesn't have to be in a gym to count as exercise. Maybe it's yoga at home. Maybe you take a dance class. Maybe you take up hiking. Maybe you walk around your neighborhood. There are millions of people in the world who don't go to the gym or make specific time to do fitness, and they are still healthy--they just have something worked into their daily routines that exercises their bodies in some way. And no, you don't have to be a Mongolian yak herder to for fitness into your daily life. For me, doing yoga is just about the only thing I -love- to do fitness-wise. It took me over thirty years to figure that out."
writing,ffainrk,t3_esexb9,1579736650.0,"Lockpicking. It's never accurately portrayed. Locksport is a thing (my SO got into it maybe 6 years ago), and ever since then, I've realized how inaccurate lockpicking is in movies, television, books, and whatever else. Like, you can't use a singular toothpick or a hairpin to unlock a door. ðŸ™„ A little research by writers and editors would go a long way!"

Oh my goodness, that's hilarious! And yes, it's a bit of an odd job! It was a part-time weekend job while I was in college. :) Mine was a *little* more involved because it was a super fancy schmancy hotel, but yeah, totally unnecessary. 

For those curious, we would deliver ice to the rooms, turn down the covers, dim the lights, place chocolates and a breakfast room service menu on the cover, straighten a bit, refresh towels, and empty any full/overflowing garbage bins. We were also on-call for any housekeeping-related requests until the end of our shifts as well as maintaining all public areas."

JustNoSO,fe8rsev,t3_ens31l,1578929913.0,"I would be angry too. Something to keep in mind is that anger is often a secondary emotion that sort of covers up an underlying emotion that is harder to express. I'm not saying that's the case here, but when (and I do hope it's a when, not an if) you see a counselor to process this event, I'm sure they'll guide you through everything that's going on. I'm so sorry that you've experienced this."

Fortunately at the time, I worked with a fellow turndown attendant so nothing really ever happened, but it was SO creepy."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fcybb65,t3_ej4any,1578077589.0,"TW: suicide

When I worked at a hotel, a woman committed suicide in one of our rooms. Front desk didn't suspect anything as she'd been a pretty positive guest upon checking in. The only reason anything was suspected was when her family called asking about her because they had reason to be worried about her and had been calling around to all the hotels in town. I was the only housekeeping management on site that day so I was roped into redirecting our staff from the floor as GM and FDM investigated. Sadly, we were too late, and the woman had already passed away (alcohol and barbiturates were found on her nightstand).  There was a framed picture of her dog next to her. So so sad. We did our best to keep the story quiet, but word got out amongst the staff, and everyone felt pretty bummed and/or scared about it. It's a terrible thing to have happen in your hotel, but it sadly happens a lot."

JustNoSO,fbz650b,t3_eevv4q,1577236263.0,"This sounds a lot like a guy I dated in college. We dated for awhile, I felt like it wasn't the right relationship for me, and broke things off. I didn't stick to my original conviction that it was a bad fit and we started dating again for several months, during which time my mental health plummeted. I finally got the courage to break things off again, and he was really mean after the second breakup. He accused me of being interested in someone else/cheating on him. ðŸ¤· It didn't really escalate from there, and I moved away to go to a different college and put some literal space between us. A few months later, my sister was dating him, and then a month later, they eloped. So now he's my brother-in-law!

Obviously, my situation isn't the same as yours, but at this point, you're leading him on if you aren't on the same page as him. The other point I'm trying to make is that you *know* that it's not the right relationship for you, and you should honor yourself and end it before you bring any more pain and frustration into your life. I know it's hard, especially if you feel no ill will towards him, but you can do it."

I was surprised in first grade when I found out my cousin (4 months younger than me) believed he existed. I love the mythology of Santa, elves, and the North Pole, but I'm also ok that I didn't have to experience such a let down as discovering something I thought was real wasn't actually real. I can't imagine how hard that would be."
