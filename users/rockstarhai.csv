Brad Pitt's last few movies have been a delight too.


They both started as good looking poster boys but end up to be the power house that they are. Looking forward to more movies from them."

television,fbuqe8d,t3_eekl79,1577118699.0,"I've played alot of RPGs and there's something about Witcher 3 that made me replayed it again 4 times with all the side quests completed.


The storyline is great. Soundtrack is awesome. I don't know how to put it into words but it just made me feel wanna log in everyday after work to just explore around and talk to Yen. 


I guess Witcher ended with the perfect ending. It shouldn't continue anymore. Let's just leave it as it is and let hopefully the TV series will keep up the good work to tell the stories."
