We have zero connection to Scientology but it was *that* unnerving. Their cult is frightening and I hope they are exposed for who they truly are. If people continue to speak out, a tipping point will be reached - albeit too slowly for those who are being harmed right now. 

I honestly don't know what I'd do if someone did that to my dog. How heartbreaking."

booksuggestions,fe4y6jr,t1_fe4mf20,1578863890.0,"It has to do with going out of our way to discover viewpoints other than our own. It's much more than ""skin color"". For example, as a white, rural, middle-age woman I have no idea what it is like to be in the world as a black man. No matter how I might *try* to understand, it's challenging because I'm coming from my own (admittedly limited) experience.

As a further example, I was raised in foster care, never knew my father, and don't do major social media under my own name because I **must** have zero contact with my bio family. I guarantee that if I were talented enough to write a book I would include social settings, emotional insights, and dialogue that would not be present were it not for my unique experiences. Those experiences, woven into a story, might prove interesting to someone from a different background.

One of the reasons I enjoyed reading The Broken Earth trilogy were the gems in dialogue between characters. Things where I went, 'Huh. I never thought of it like that.' Aside from that, she created a unique world with believable characters that I grew to care about. I'd recommend it!"

I've never done a challenge before, and I'm setting my goal for 52. I'm going for a nice mix of fiction/nonfiction as well as alternating kindle/paper. I've always loved reading but have fallen waaaay off of where I'd like to be. 

I recently finished my Yoga teacher cert. so some of my nonfiction will be yoga-related topics. The last few years I went on a big graphic novel binge! I love that genre so I'll include a few of those. I used to read a lot of poetry when I was younger and I miss it, so I'm including poetry - either anthologies or works by a single author. I enjoy nonfiction and have a few books I'm really looking forward to! I'd also like to include some humor because I need to balance out the heavy and I've never gotten into that genre. I don't have my whole list ready yet - I don't know if I'm going to do a formal challenge like Pop Sugar or just read 52 books. One of my goals is to read as many books as I currently have on hand as possible, then get others from the library and used book store.

Social media has had a negative impact on my reading because there's only so much time and it's easy to give it away by scrolling and reading headlines. So, I'm gonna make a positive change :o)

I'm looking forward to this year - it will be fun to see what you all are reading! My first book is The Way of Kings (first in The Stormlight Archive trilogy) by Brandon Sanderson."
