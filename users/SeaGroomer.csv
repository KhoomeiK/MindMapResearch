Yes, that is *literally* what I just said.

> No it is not more durable the chemical process makes it that gummy chewy crap it is. 

No, cow hide *is* more durable than bull penis meat - and from the start, not just because of a 'chemical process'. You are letting your emotions take control of your argument here and you're not making any sense.

>I do not used bleached flour as I know the chemicals they use to make it. I have already cut out overly processed food from my life.

Ok that's cool for you but the vast majority of people do eat or bake with bleached flour.

>It worries me if they cannot afford a chew toy that cheap they can't afford the dog. Meaning how do they afford vet bill, flea/ tick, Heartworm treatments. Food, treats, or all the other things they need.

You don't think adding a substantial additional charge on top of those things makes a big difference for a lot of people? Vet bills aren't too regular outside of vaccinations until they get older, flea and tick medication is less than $100 a year, and you can get pretty good food at Costco for cheap. It's not fair to say people shouldn't be allowed to own dogs because they can't spend almost ten times as much for chew toys that won't last as long. 

These [Bully Sticks](https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/good-lovin-traditional-beef-bully-stick-dog-chew) and [Rawhides](https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/dog/dog-treats-and-chews/rawhide/good-lovin-traditional-rawhide-roll-dog-chew) are pretty comparable items, though the rawhides are a bit bigger individually. You get 6 bully sticks for $30 ($5/piece,) whereas with the rawhide you get what looks to be maybe 12-15 rolls for $13 (~$1/piece.) You'll also notice that the sticks are labeled for 'moderate' chewers, while the rawhide is for 'aggressive' chewers. 

For what it's worth, I give my dog a mix of those rawhide-free 'bones' made of peanut butter and chicken and whatnot, and some of the smoked bones, his favorite being [knee bones](https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/dog/dog-treats-and-chews/dog-bone-treats/good-lovin-hickory-smoked-knee-bone-dog-chews), but I work at a pet store so I get it all at a discount and my dog isn't a huge chewer. I can definitely understand how someone with a big chewer would not be able to afford giving them those types of chew toys all the time.
