Sneakers,ff4jddq,t1_ff4izrj,1579565017.0,Fashion goes in cycles. Right now almost every hyped kick is toned down earthy and modest colors. But going back to the Black box SB era it was the opposite. Everyone shat them selves fir the 3 bears pack meanwhile I stocked up on 4 pairs of Stummers for 50 bucks a pop.
Sneakers,ff4hz97,t3_eriq8e,1579564067.0,I really cant wait for the Jordan 1 hype train and Dunk SB hype to die down so I can afford the sneakers ive been buying since 2005. Being forced to enter lotteries for plain ass J1s like what the fuck.
Gunners,ff3m9nf,t1_ff3f1pp,1579544069.0,But thats something that every club deals with. Even Madrid and Barca. Sometimes a player is just not a good fit.
Gunners,ff2nuot,t1_fexvggj,1579515419.0,"I hear this argument a lot but other than Fabragras and Van P. What star have we sold at the peak that didnt have plenty other issues? RVP had 1 good season after he left and Fab sat on Barcas bench. Ramsey has been injured for Juve and we all know what happened to Alexis.

Edit: forgot about Anleka but he's always hopped about.  The only Outlier is the big man himself. For the most part we have kept players for their most productive years then moved them on. Also Cashly. But fuck him."
gaming,ff2n0mm,t1_ff28hlx,1579514116.0,My sneaker collection agrees with you.

Hawaii,fe5x6a2,t1_fe5wety,1578876935.0,"im pro choice 100%   but I dont doubt that deep in their hearts many do believe they are about protecting innocence of children. I think they are wrong and some are just about control of women but its not just men who are pro life. Plenty women are too. We need to cut out the cancer that brain washes them as opposed to just railing against the individuals. I think its clear that simply trying to shame them deepens they feelings that we are just child killers. 

That being said I still get furious at their ignorance."
Hawaii,fe5vsm2,t1_fe5ik6j,1578876055.0,"I try not to make assumptions about others beliefs. I suspect that tends to be the subconscious factor behind a lot of it but I dont doubt the propaganda of religion and the right that some of these people feel it truly is murder. 

It doesnt justify anything but I think its important to understand motivation on all levels if can."

Showerthoughts,fdq0srw,t1_fdpzsug,1578649209.0,"They are both very obvious and everyone knows but yet are always told. Every time an older person asks me to take a photo They point to the button.

mildlyinteresting,fcpqehg,t1_fcpgg15,1577869876.0,"Kinda reminded me of astro bot but as a dog. Teal thing looks lime a coffee table with a screen built in. I have an ipad on my coffee table so that checks out. Also godzilla is on an oversized flat panel TV mounted to the wall so that checks out as well.

Edit: as for floating slices of pizza. We can only dream."
