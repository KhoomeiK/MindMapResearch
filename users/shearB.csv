beyondthebump,ff53nwa,t3_erom20,1579579342.0,My poor husband got up to feed the baby at 11 last night and LO ended up fussing until 2am. Apparently he tried to wake me up to help him but I turned him away in my half asleep state. Poor guy. I'm proud of him though. 😂
beyondthebump,ff2ygzc,t3_eqwugs,1579528642.0,"I'm thinking about moving our little one out. He currently sleeps in a bassinet next to our bed and I don't know how much longer I can take the grunting noises. He's currently 7 weeks old. I used to be able to sleep through anything but whenever he grunts, my heart rate literally spikes and I wake up. It's like my body just won't let me ignore every little sound he makes."

beyondthebump,fep6wfi,t3_eq8tvg,1579313486.0,"Do your nipples hurt when the cold air or the water from the shower hit them? When you experience pain, look at your nipples. Do they change color? Like to white, or purple? Does the pain happen even when it's been a while since the last feeding?

I went to my doctor since I found myself saying yes to all the above, and I finally decided that it wasn't normal. Turns out you can get Raynaud's of the nipples. (Vasospasms that constrict blood flow. Involuntary and painful.) She wrote me a prescription for a cream to apply to them as needed, and it really helped. I did have to go to a compounding pharmacy to get it, and insurance didn't cover it.. but it really helped with the discomfort. Maybe you're experiencing something similar?"
beyondthebump,fedoqzl,t1_fecqsw9,1579016601.0,"I hope things improve for us. My baby is currently 6 weeks and he's still a lazy eater. He latches fine, but he has trouble with keeping the suction and using his tongue correctly. When we saw a LC she didn't seem to think his tongue was tied, so she suggested suck training before every nursing session. He still falls asleep though! If he doesn't, he just gets frustrated at the slow flow. I usually have to massage my breasts as he's feeding to get him to swallow anything. I usually hand express after he's done only to discover that he maybe took half an ounce from me total.

My milk came in really late so we had to start supplementing from the start because of weight loss. I've practically been triple feeding since his first week of life but he's still bad at nursing. I'm losing hope that things will ever get better. I can keep up my current strategy, but I don't think I'll make it past 6 months at this rate. My supply is still low, but it's been slowly climbing up. I tried pumping for quite a while but discovered hand expression last week and it's made my supply go up a lot more quickly. When I used to pump, I literally had to use my hands to get anything to come out. If I just tried to sit and relax, it took nearly 10 minutes for my milk to let down and 45 minutes before milk stopped flowing. With hand compressions. At least with hand expression I only have to do it for 30 minutes max."
beyondthebump,fedgu7d,t1_fedgksw,1579011152.0,I'm wondering if it's a portrait mod. I want to know which one it is if that's the case. I searched forever but couldn't find one I liked. Most of the really good ones don't include every single villager.
beyondthebump,fed2hdb,t3_eocwb8,1578995445.0,"Ha! I said the same thing. My husband said ""where else is he going to stuff a fistful of cheerios?"""
beyondthebump,fed2fhp,t1_febvnlw,1578995367.0,It's currently almost 4am and I almost burst out laughing. Too good.
beyondthebump,feagtjw,t3_enuo2n,1578948593.0,"We're in a similar spot! 6+3 and yesterday he ate SO MUCH. We also combo feed because of supply issues so it's not so bad, but seriously he downed almost 5oz in one feeding last night. He had so much in his tummy that I could hear the liquid when I rocked him. He did spit up but not so much that I felt like he was overfed. It was crazy! Just a few days ago he was only taking 2-3oz per feed."
breastfeeding,fe6chl8,t1_fe6af1n,1578886943.0,"It is pretty bad in the cold, but the pain persists even when I'm warm. I held a heating pad to my breasts last night and my nipple still hurt. 

I've wondered about vasospasms too though. Last night when I felt the worst pain I looked at them and saw that they were turning pale. Weirded me out."
breastfeeding,fe6a5da,t1_fe69sxu,1578885226.0,"I'll be calling my doctor tomorrow. There's no flu symptoms, so I suspect thrush, but the pediatrician didn't think my LO had it when I went to urgent care today, but I had them swab him to make sure. I'll find out if he has it in a few days, at least."
YouShouldKnow,fdremwp,t1_fdrbyqa,1578683475.0,"Ha, we met at a college club for fans of My Little Pony actually... And I know how it sounds, but he's not that crazy about it. He collected stuff when it first came out and went to conventions to meet voice actors, but he hardly talks about it. Actually I was probably the reason we kept up with it until the show ended a few months ago. He's not the kind of fan you think of when you think of ""bronies,"" but he'll probably give an eye roll when someone assumes it's a stupid thing to be into because it's ""for little girls.""

I've always been into the awkward nerds. I dated some in high school and avoided others, mostly the type that only wanted to date me just because I like video games. My husband was kind of shy at first, but as more of his quirky personality came out, I became attracted to him. I admit I also liked the fact that I was the only person he could be emotional and open with. It made me feel special. I really started liking him when I discovered his sweet side. I admit at first even I thought he was a dick at first, but he soon showed his sweet side I fell for him. I came to understand quickly how misunderstood he was, and that made me want to understand him more. He tells me he never could have imagined getting married and starting a family, but that it was his dream. (We just had our first baby!) 

I am the first and only relationship he's been in. He also suffers from panic disorder, so that's another thing that is often misunderstood by others. Panic attacks are real shit.

I wish you the best. I hope you find your someone someday. :)"
YouShouldKnow,fdqq2da,t1_fdqplz3,1578672434.0,"My husband has admitted that he doesn't like my parents, but he doesn't hate them. It has caused many misunderstandings with them in the past though. Lots of awkward and uncomfortable situations. I've learned to put my foot in my mouth though and stop speaking for him. If he doesn't really want to engage with them (especially my dad) I'm not going to force it, and I'm not going to apologize for his ""rude"" behavior."
YouShouldKnow,fdpvnsm,t3_emlplf,1578642390.0,"Yes. My husband has a very strong ""resting bitch face"". So much so that even I have asked him on several occasions""why are you looking at me like that?"" It hurt his feelings and we had a good and open conversation about it. 

It's frustrating because while he can interact with other people, it takes the right kind of environment for him to actually relax enough to engage with everyone. I had a friend/co-worker who thought my husband hated her for over a year until they finally got together in a comfortable place outside of work. She said to me after ""wow I've never seen your husband like that, he seemed so much more talkative!"" All I could do was tell her that's what I've been trying to say about him. He doesn't ""hate"" anyone, he's just not very social.

Anyway, yeah. Don't assume the worst in someone just because they don't seem to want to talk to you. If they don't know you, they're probably just worried about what you're thinking of them. Be patient with them. I'm still learning with my husband how to not assume he's upset when there's no good reason for me to assume that, but I make mistakes."
BabyBumps,fdphnct,t3_emd4ry,1578628879.0,"My baby will be 6 weeks tomorrow and I too was tired of hearing all the negativity from other people. Was it hard adjusting those first few weeks? Yes. Were there tears? Yes. Is breastfeeding a lot more difficult than I thought it would be? Yes! But you know what? I've stopped putting expectations on my baby. He's a pretty good little guy. Sure he only goes 1.5-2.5 hours between feeds at night, but who am I to put this needs on my schedule? He can't tell the time, why should I expect anything from him right now?

The first smiles have started this week and it's seriously the most heart melting thing. It makes every hard moment absolutely worth it."
mylittlepony,fdpfw5u,t1_fdpe1nl,1578627567.0,"No joke, that was the line where I finally decided ""yup, I like this show."" 

Before that I was watching because a friend told me it was good."
beyondthebump,fdpe7pk,t1_fdoqzan,1578626364.0,"Yes! I have just one niece, she's 2. Last I saw her, my brother and her mom kept telling her to give everyone a hug goodbye. It was obvious she didn't really feel like it so I didn't push it when it was ""my turn."" Just a couple hours later my SIL texts me saying my niece was asking where I went. I felt like she knew I was the only one who respected her autonomy."
beyondthebump,fdltypy,t1_fdl1ynh,1578532433.0,"Lol probably true. But to save you a little bit you can go longer between changes. Modern diapers can hold a LOT of pee. We have a 6 week old and have only just now figured out that we can wait up to 4 hours between changes. Then again it might be different if you have a girl since the risk for UTI is higher, but the pediatrician told us they aren't as worried about boys going longer with a wet diaper."
beyondthebump,fdltr2y,t3_elxun0,1578532292.0,"We started off changing it every time we saw blue, so I was a little confused when we were told that 6 wet diapers was the normal range by the pediatrician. I thought to myself ""we change it like 10+ times a day though..."" And only now do I realize they meant actual wet diapers. Like diaper feels kind of full wet. We don't change the diapers as often now. So much better."
AmItheAsshole,fdgcr29,t3_el2ls9,1578390459.0,"NAH. Except maybe your friends and family for saying such a thing. Your husband is just looking out for you, I'm sure. He'd be the asshole if he wanted to stop you from getting surgery. Unless he plans on just that. Then he's definitely an asshole. Your body your choice.

I just had an unplanned c-section just over a month ago and I feel you on not liking your postpartum body. I have a nice big scar above my bikini line that I have to live with my entire life now. I really hated it at first but I've accepted it. If it doesn't fade well though I'm going to consider getting treatment to hide it a little better. I don't want it completely gone, but it'd be nice if it wasn't so obvious. 

I'm not a fan of my squishy tummy or my stretch marks, but I'm sure those will fade a bit too. I'm still 15lbs above pre-pregnancy weight so I still have a little ways to go."
BabyBumps,fd8aiy9,t1_fd7pemx,1578215944.0,"It's super awesome! Especially since we use Dr. Brown's bottles. So many little parts. 

Another suggestion I have is a heating pad. It's great for warming up the bassinet before putting the baby down. I usually stick it in while feeding so that when I put baby back, he's not shocked awake because he's not being held anymore. A rice bag works too. Ofc you want to remove anything from the bed before putting baby back."
BabyBumps,fd7p35j,t3_ek09da,1578207890.0,"Piggybacking on the topic of sterilizing bottles. There's a company called Milton that makes sterilizing tablets that dissolve in water. I bought the 5 liter container they make and it's been great for cleaning stuff between feeds and pumping sessions. You just wash everything with soap and water, stick it all in the solution, then whenever you need it, you can just take it out and use it right away. The great thing is being able to leave stuff in the solution and knowing that everything is completely sterilized. It's been a game changer."
beyondthebump,fczqdl7,t3_ejf4ed,1578106775.0,"I have a couple things in common with you. Baby is five weeks old now and we're still supplementing. I found out a better position for breastfeeding though that gets him to transfer milk better and it's made a difference in how much formula I have to give him. I've been pumping 8 times a day since week 2 but my supply is still a bit low. I also had an unexpected c-section. Thankfully it didn't end up being an emergency though and we were able to discuss things and remain calm about it. I was extremely disappointed though. When they first told me that it was likely going to be cesarean, I cried and cried. But it's okay.

I wish you luck ♥️"

beyondthebump,fcrttcc,t1_fcrmeu4,1577906528.0,He will be 5 weeks on Friday. I'm mostly exclusively pumping since he is a very weak sucker so he gets less from me himself than the pump in the same amount of time. I don't nurse him much.
beyondthebump,fcr37d3,t1_fcqsnxn,1577896131.0,"I pumped just over 2oz this morning. Compared to a few weeks ago when I started pumping and only getting a fraction of an ounce each time, it's a huge improvement! I'm still about 10oz under baby's daily needs, but I'm working my way up!"

beyondthebump,fce8j5p,t3_egyy7g,1577617920.0,"I took my baby to a support group with other new moms at 2 weeks, a Christmas party with the same group a few days later, then another small outing a few days after that, and then a couple restaurants at weeks 3 and 4 since family is in town. I've kept him close to me all times, either in carrier or his car seat stroller, so I haven't really worried about him getting anything. Little one is fine."
beyondthebump,fcaeuse,t3_egrsm7,1577568025.0,"I'm currently in the same situation. Baby is 4 weeks old and has been supplemented since his first pediatrician appointment. During the day, I nurse, then bottle, then pump. I usually offer whatever I pumped at the next feeding, then rinse and repeat. I don't nurse at night though, just bottle and pump. I only pump 1-2oz every session and baby is a super lazy eater at the breast. We did a weighted feed with a LC and he took less than an ounce after 20 minutes total, both breasts. On rare occasions, he eats half and half expressed milk and formula, but mostly he eats formula. 

I'm hoping my supply will catch up to him, but I don't have high expectations."
beyondthebump,fc5ew2v,t3_eg82nc,1577455556.0,"I kind of understand. I'm currently supplementing only because I have to, and while at first I was sad that I needed to pump around the clock and use formula, I've gotten used to feeding baby with a bottle. I do like knowing how much he eats, especially since I know he gets so little when he nurses (lazy eater.) I've been advised to triple feed in the daytime just so my baby can get experience with breastfeeding and help boost my supply, but I find nursing incredibly tedious. It basically adds at least 15 minutes to every feed during the day. I like the system we have at night. We wake up, and husband feeds baby with a bottle while I pump. 

I think once my supply is up, I want to start exclusively pumping. I'll still nurse, but it'll be for comfort/bonding more than anything else. I might even still use formula if I forget to pump for a couple feeds or something."
breastfeeding,fc1yjzj,t3_efq37j,1577333766.0,"We bought formula and bottles just in case but didn't end up needing the formula we bought since the pediatrician gave us some to start supplementing with at his first appointment. My milk came in extremely late (7 days I think) and my supply is pretty low, so we're still supplementing. I'm building up my supply with pumping though. My most productive session was 2.5oz total. Baby is almost a month so he eats about 3oz every feeding."
breastfeeding,fbqlv6p,t1_fbpaqwe,1577032973.0,"Even at night, don't let baby go more than 4 hours. At least that's what I was told. Ideally they should eat every 2-3, even at night. At least for the first couple weeks. I know it's hard but newborns need to eat. Their stomachs are tiny! Like I said, as long as you are nursing before using the pacifier, it's okay."
