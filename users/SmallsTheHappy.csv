Then you’ve got the fucks who you ban for breaking to rules that they were supposed to read brigading on your rival sub about how “corrupt” you are and how you have a “god complex” because you banned them for saying the n word. You name is constantly drug through the mud because you temp banned someone who didn’t follow the very simple formatting rules for the 4th time. All of this shit for free.
