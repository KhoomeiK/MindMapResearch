careerguidance,ffe19q1,t3_et1wx4,1579834098.0,"A couple years ago I came to DC for an interview at the Waldorf for front desk. I'd been working in hospitality for about a year at that point but had never been in a hotel so fancy in my life before. I arrived nearly late, having done no research beforehand about the building, the people managing it, or anything. Firstly, I had chosen to drive in rather than navigate the unfamiliar metro, and being unfamiliar with city traffic I ended up arriving at exactly the time of my interview....still needing to park.

At this point I'm just doing all I can to just get through it...but the moment I needed security to let me in the building I knew I'd fucked up. For reference, my current hotel routinely had overflowing toilets, one person on the desk at a time, and I was essentially a cashier/janitor during my time there.

As i sat in the office waiting for my interviewer I managed to (and this was literally my thought process) channel my best Emily Gilmore and impress the first person I met with, at least enough to be taken to a second person....as we discussed my background and the history of the hotel and the fact that this place literally serves high tea, i realized i didnt belong and was rapidly deflating....

By the time the second person came, I was giving one word answers. The interview didnt last much longer and I cried as I left the parking garage knowing I would never even be fancy enough to work at that type of place...."

WeightLossAdvice,ffde0ij,t3_esxuiv,1579818896.0,"Maybe you have a genetic mutation where avocados taste bitter to you - to most people, they hardly taste like anything which is why they're so popular (they enhance or take on the flavors of whatever they're paired with). Maybe you got a bad batch? I could see them being bitter if they've gone bad. Avocados should be a deep, uniform green on the outside and have a soft, uniformly light green interior. The pit should be light brown and be removed fairly easily. You do not eat the skin but only the flesh. If there are dark brown/grey/dark green bits in the interior, that part has spoiled. If a few of those pieces are in an avocado I'll scoop it out and only eat the light green part, but if there is a lot I discard the full avocado. If it's not ripe (ie is hard) then it probably won't be tasty either.

Does this sound like your avocado?"

fatlogic,fel0v52,t3_ep3ge4,1579211650.0,"I squeezed in a workout Tuesday when I barely had an hour between when I got home from work and when I had to leave again. I felt great the rest of the night and slept better than I think I would have otherwise.

Been eating at deficit regularly and working on listening to my body and making smarter food choices when true hunger I can't squash down appears. In those times I'm trying to reach for cantaloupe or an apple or some freeze dried raspberries (these are literally a game changer for me and I LOVE them), and being lenient with myself if it means going above 1200. The interesting thing for me is that by switching my meals around I can manage better throughout the day, and I'm craving fruit - I'm literally sometimes not eating chocolate because I want cantaloupe instead. 

I'm not stressed about having to exercise like a madwoman to lose weight like I was when my trainer wanted me to eat at 1600 - because I know this will be more successful for me. I always overeat, even if just by something small. And I'm not going to stop living my life - I still want to be able to go out with friends or to a bar and enjoy a couple beers without having to worry I won't lose weight. Since I don't have to focus on using exercise to cause a deficit, I'm able to actually enjoy it and focus on what I actually want to get out of it and what my goals are (run a mile, then a 5k, learn to dance).

So far I've lost about 3 pounds, so I'm feeling pretty good!"

Depending on the pain your experiencing, you may want to try doing foam rolling exercises and PT exercises, which you can find online.

careerguidance,fdqgv7d,t3_emr5za,1578666345.0,"Well. given that your experience with your internship was very different than your job and it was at a different company, and given everything else you've said, I'm going to say it's the company.. I know that the creative world can have you working extensively or staying late especially if there is a fire to put out or a deadline to meet. However, if this is always the case, and most of your coworkers are coming and going very early and very late, some even sleeping in the office, that is really on the company. It means the workload they have signed up for is to extensive and they're worried more about their bottom dollar than investing in their employees.

When I got my first ""real"" office job after college, the company culture was very much the same thing - if you don't know, figure it out, if you have to work more to get the work done, get it done even if it takes hours and hours over when you would like to leave - and even though you're hourly, DON'T report those hours. That's not sustainable and I've seen a lot of people from that company burn out. By contrast, I work at a marketing company now, and no one is here later than 7PM - and that's with flexible start times. People work hard, but our designers, devs, account support, and everyone else on our various teams are rarely working to the point of burnout. In fact, we're a rapidly growing environment and getting more and more work every day. Since I started 6 months ago management has seen the need for more staff and delivered - we had 3 designers when I started, and now we have 5. The same thing has happened in other departments and in fact, my entire position was created to distribute work load more evenly.

It might be that in your section of the industry (architecture), it's long hours and tight deadlines everywhere, but I doubt it. The only way to know for sure is to move on to a different company now that the rose colored glasses you had about your ""dream company"" have been removed."

It could be constipation, having eaten an especially salty meal, differing times of day that you weigh yourself, that you're not drinking enough water, recently increased physical activity, that you started drinking more water, that you had alcohol in the past few days, or even an allergy to something you're eating that isn't mind to produce symptoms other than the bloat.

Either way, stick to it and it will eventually go down again. I recommend using an app like Libra to record your weight so you can see that you are still trending downwards."

Regardless of what their manager thought of you, you're not working with him directly and on a day-to-day basis. You are working with the people who thought so little of you they didn't even ask if you were okay.

Withdraw your application. Tell their manager why. Tell their HR department why. You were sick and should have rescheduled, yes, but that doesn't excuse their behavior at. all.

I know its hard to recognize that when its the only thing about yourself that you like, but it is something you're going to have to work on and realize. You are not one part of yourself; you are gorgeous freckles, sparkling eyes, the kindness you show to others, and so, so much more than just your breasts.

You are on this journey to feel better about your body and get healthier. A holistic approach to health also includes a healthy self-image. Learning to accept your looks and act in a healthy way for yourself is part of that. 

(Also, worth noting: 1- 38DD is a fairly decent cup size 2- Most people see your breasts in a bra, anyway, so you don't need to worry about it 3-Maybe one day you \*will\* be able to afford a breast lift, so no reason to stop now! 4- weight training may help give you a bit of a natural lift, building the pec muscles 5- Your boobs aren't going to look like this all your life, anyway, between childbirth, aging, and the weight loss.
