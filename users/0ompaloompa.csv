PublicFreakout,fe6nu4k,t1_fe6ng41,1578897430.0,"Sure maybe you aren't. But the use of ALM absolutely is whether you see that or believe that or not. 

If you are truly being genuine here, you should try to think about it from the prospective of marginalized Americans. They are fighting to be treated the same as white people. They get some traction with the BLM movement and the white folk jump in and say ""What about us?!"" That is what ALM  is doing. No matter what you proclaim your intention is...

PublicFreakout,fe6m6qz,t1_fe6cpxh,1578895631.0,"Saying ""All Lives Matter"" is so intellectually dishonest. It's using a slogan that in it's literal sense is irrefutably true to move the argument from the actual social issue. 

Black people in America are exponentially more likely to be murdered by law enforcement. That is the issue. 

Trying to dilute that message because it gets attention but doesn't help you is so disrespectful to you fellow humans."

AskReddit,fdpix0q,t1_fdpcans,1578629852.0,"This isn't what we are talking about. We are talking about borrowing against future cash flow. 

Imagine buying a car on credit. You make $32k/yr at your job. The US govt gives you $12k/yr under Yang's plan.

You are buying a $20k car and put 10% down. So pay 2k up front and have a $18k note.

You can use Yang's money to make the down payment. You can use Yang's money to make the monthly payment. 

What the bank can't do is underwrite you as a borrower that makes $44k/yr. You must be able to qualify for the loan solely based on the cash flow from your job ($32k/yr).
