CapitalismVSocialism,ffded4n,t3_esxht7,1579819105.0,"I always appreciate a long post OP, but you've set the goalpost on exactly what libertarianism is waaay too much without explaining why. This isn't a critique of libertarianism, it's a critique of a whole bunch of positions that libertarians might or might not hold, and which lots of non-libertarians probably hold too. 

Say you take a much looser definition - *libertarianism is the view that individual liberty matters above all*. From that you can wind up with wildly different positions. You could go all Hillel Steiner and say that because of that belief, there should be a great deal more redistribution, because part of having freedom is having the resources to exercise that freedom. And from that you might wind up with strong tax policy, unions, etc etc. That's a far cry from what most libertarians believe, I know, but it follows from the same principles you kind of strawman at the start of your argument. 

From what I managed, you launched a solid attack on someone who holds the beliefs you laid out. But the conclusion that it's a middle-class pathology only works if you start by assuming it's purely middle-class and pathological, and you seem to do that."

bulletjournal,ff2dpdd,t1_ff1qbek,1579501944.0,"Haha nah, just a photo of my Leuchtturm notebook. I just googled Rocketbook and it seems real cool"
bulletjournal,ff2damw,t1_ff26cyd,1579501511.0,"So not to get too deep or to make any assumptions about your life, but this was me when I started, and when I read back over a few months, I realised I was depressed as all hell. 

I just used it as an actual 'what I did today' tracker, and I kinda knew I was on the same repeat pattern of work / come home / smoke weed / do nothing / feel sad. But seeing it actually play out so many times was shocking. And seeing the (much fewer) entries when I was having a good day was a starting point to fix things for myself.

Not saying this is your situation too, but just posting this in case it's helpful in any way. Hope you're well :)."

Also, thanks for making this incredibly low-effort content my highest updooted post ever! Was having a real shitty day up til then, so it's nice to know people enjoyed it."
HelpMeFind,feylotb,t1_fb4p94y,1579447271.0,"Found!

And sorry for not doing this earlier! My sister was really surprised at Christmas :)"
glasgow,fengt6n,t1_fem5p8i,1579284374.0,"I'm actually really glad you asked, because I've made it sound horrific haha. Yes, there were bad times, but the good times were *so good*

I met some of the kindest people I've ever met. I met people who'd been helped by my charity who had incredible stories. I met people who needed our help, but didn't know we existed. I got to talk to so many people with so many interesting stories. And when you get a lot of people on board, you feel like you've done something really valuable with your day. 

Like I said earlier, most members of the public were great. For me, the odd bad interaction didn't take away from how much fun I normally had. Over time it piled up and became harder (as did coping with our fair city's weather), but overall, I'm really glad I did it. I'm a much more confident person than when I started, and can take criticism much less personally haha. 

It's absolutely not for everyone, but it was weirdly hard to gauge who would take to it, if that makes sense? Some really outgoing people crashed and burned, some quiet reserved folk like me suddenly became a different person on the street. 

Anyway, I'm rambling, but it really wasnt a bad job at all. Great stories, mostly great colleagues, and all of my favourite work memories to this day."

glasgow,fegybrt,t1_fegwnee,1579105243.0,"I'm a guy, and can confirm that the harassment towards women was much, much worse than I ever experienced. I was always amazed at how they dealt with it. 

One of the big factors in lots of people I know not doing the job long-term was the strain on your mental health. There's definitely a limit to how long you can be told to fuck off and keep smiling. And unfortunately, the bad guys tend to have a much higher tolerance for it than the ones who do everything by the book."
glasgow,fegukeb,t3_ep1rmg,1579102863.0,"I used to do this as a job. If you find anyone harassing you, get either their name or a description of them that differentiates them from any other fundraiser on site, and report them. 

[Here's the rulebook](https://www.fundraisingregulator.org.uk/code/specific-fundraising-methods/collecting-money-or-other-property). If you catch anyone breaking anything laid out there, report them to their charity. 

In my experience most charity fundraisers are wonderful people, enthusiastic about what they do and about the cause they work for, but there's almost always one dickhead salesman harassing the hell out of people. Trust me, we hated them too. They're a big part of the reason we get daily abuse, threats, and the occasional assault (because like fundraisers, most members of the public are great, but a small minority aren't, and some can be downright scary). 

As long as people don't complain, those people tend to get a lot of signups, which encourages charities / agencies to look the other way. They shouldn't, but like with any job they need reason to move people on."
