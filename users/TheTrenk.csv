You see it a lot when he’s watching footage and giving advice - he rarely says something that suggests he’s looking through anybody’s eyes but his own. Another viable plan would have been a Kobashi jab and clinch strategy, or a Miyata strategy where he pins his hopes on a big counter. Ippo’s not telling Kimura to fight like Kimura, he’s coaching him to fight like how he likes to fight."

kungfu,ff5d9qx,t1_ff4dcjg,1579588083.0,"Oh, I know. He doesn’t value sparring, the experience or input of others, nor anything the community offers him. Every time I see him post, I’m a little bit curious of two things: If he’s so incredible, why not become a professional fighter and be a millionaire who is paid to train, and if he doesn’t value anything he finds here then why does he keep coming back? 

But, at the end of the day, I guess I am also curious in a demented way as to what he’s gonna say next. Most people here seem to know not to engage and I’m certainly not learning anything about kung fu or martial arts or even fighting. It’s more of a morbid fascination, like watching My 600lb Life or a strongman or eating competition or those documentaries about murderers or even a fight, except much more interactive for me as a viewer."
kungfu,ff57cjh,t1_ff4b4aj,1579582349.0,"The point of a sparring video would be to see what technique you value. Most people who come here aren’t professionals in any sense of the word - they don’t fight competitively, they don’t own gyms, I doubt many are even professional in the sense that they get paid to instruct. So that leads me to believe that the main point of the forum would be to discuss technique and kung fu as a whole; in order to do that and be taken seriously (which, again, you have made clear the opinions of others do not matter to you) you typically have to give in order to get. It’s a conversational transaction, so to speak. 

Now, in this instance, you again bring up kicks as an entry and whether or not they’re valid and, unlike on other topics, you seem willing to engage. So I’ll bite and take the opposing stance - kicking can and has been used as an entry not only in kung fu, but worldwide, since man first discovered he could hurt another man with his leg. From the teeps and low round kicks favored in muay thai to the stabbing front kicks you see in TKD and karate to the knee height oblique kicks in wing chun and the side kicks that see so much use in sanda, kicking is a time honored entry tactic that can not only force your opponent to react in order to allow you to close the distance, but also cause an injury if it makes solid contact. You can kick to the leg or body disrupt the rhythm of the other fighter, or to slow the pace of the fight. You can create or close distance, allowing you to follow up with punches or more kicks or even disengage. You can even use them as feints to set up other kicks or to close the punch, in a Superman punch setup. 

Off of the top of my head, in case you cite that many of those things are not kung fu, I can think of entry kicks and kicks that are intended to be part of a combination and not in a fight ending capacity for both the wing chun and hung ga disciplines. 

Perhaps in your system, you don’t enter with kicks. But there are a lot of ways to win a fight, and no one of them is “best” for everybody."
kungfu,ff464ck,t1_ff42get,1579556372.0,"From the top down, I’m mostly curious about the tone. What you’re saying and how you say it doesn’t foster conversation or growth, and while some of what you say (such as mentioning when people telegraph or are off balance) is just biomechanical fact, other things you mention (such as not using kicks as an entry) are tactical differences that you present as irrefutable truths. 

On top of those things, because I’ve never seen anything that you consider “good”, I have no idea really what you’re looking for - and neither does anybody else, is my guess. Sparring footage, even if not of you, would establish what you consider to be good technique and a breakdown would tell us why you think that way. On top of that, it would lend some legitimacy to your criticism rather than you making arguments with no support other than your own word, which is verified by nobody but yourself. 

Now, I understand you care very little for the thoughts and disapproval of others, you’ve made this clear over the course of a few interactions and not all of them with me. I’m just curious where you and your apparent mastery of this subject are coming from and what your goals are. 

Final note, no. I would not try to steal the form of somebody else’s sparring. I have my own style and role models; just trying to adopt something unfamiliar to me is more likely to get me beat up than add to what I’m trying to build myself into. But even if my game plan was to take their techniques and build myself into some kind of kung fu machine, you’re giving me a lot of credit in the assumption that I could view something that I (by your own estimation) don’t understand and then plug and play it without any prior practice but in the name of evil."

MMA,fesxfzb,t1_fesdm6l,1579369916.0,"There is no Goddamn way. At 5’5, sustaining 115 (and she would have cut to 115, so really she could sustain five to ten pounds above it) is about 2.4K calories - and that’s assuming only 2x daily workouts. If you burn a pound of fat for every 3500 calories that you provide off of your body instead of off of food, she’d have been losing a pound every two days for seventy days. 

Did she go into camp at 150+? And, if so, how was she sustaining the energy for four workouts a day if she was consuming so little food? She would have had to enter fight prep way out of shape and then had a grueling, low quality (compared to what she could have had if she was starting smaller) camp in which she could sustain no injuries because she’d have been healing way more slowly with so little food and so much body use aggravating any possible wounds. 

IMO it’s likeliest she was either doing a PR stunt by talking about how tough her camp and, by extension, she is and flexing her size advantage, or she was woefully misinformed about how much she was consuming."
martialarts,fepnemc,t3_eqazxb,1579325175.0,"I think an appropriate reaction would have been to tell her she needs to go slower, personally.

I don’t even think a conversation with the instructor is warranted, really - this is the kind of thing that can be handled between students in amicable fashion. 

That being said, sitting out because you felt unsafe was also a fine route. She just may not fully understand and it could help to explain the situation instead of relying on somebody else to do it."

I liked that and the solution of clinching, driving knees, and tossing him. I liked Blue Sleeves’ teeps and his low round.

Another is to think about how you spend your downtime - are those guys getting in extra hours while you only do the prescribed workouts? Do you show up early and stay late? 

Break down old tape, frame by frame if you need to. Have you started reacting more slowly? Are you no longer enjoying a strength advantage? Have other people simply improved technically? 

Break down your losses. Why did you lose? Was the other guy faster or stronger or just better? Is there a common theme among your losses? 

Then look at your wins. Where could you have done better? Are you making the same mistakes that you do when you lose, except the guys that you beat just can’t capitalize on them? 

Most of that stuff should be pretty rote by now since it sounds like you’re pretty damn good and used to being on top, but they’re things that help me prepare for competition.

Being strong is a tremendous advantage in a fight - you may lean out as cardio becomes part of your routine, but you really don't need to alter your lifts at all. Your pulling exercises will help with clinch work and grappling. Your pushing exercises can help with framing, creating distance, or striking (depending on the exercise). Being able to support your body weight and the weight of another person, tremendously useful for grappling or being in the clinch. Being able to toss somebody off of you or to hold them in a corner? Not only is the muscle and strength you develop by lifting extremely valuable, it never hurts to strengthen your kinetic chain with compound lifts like deadlift, bench, and squat. They're not only motions that are regularly used in various aspects of MMA, but they help you create neural pathways that help chain motions together more easily and more explosively.

wma,fd17cr9,t3_eiybvf,1578128277.0,"I’ve got a few things. 

The most effective fighting force isn’t necessarily comprised of the greatest duelists, and having great champions in your army doesn’t guarantee success. If you watch the 5v5 or 21v21 buhurt HMB fight’s, you’ll see a lot of the fight boils down to situational awareness (good fighters rarely leave their back to the center of the arena or land more than three hits before finding a new target), teamwork (you hold, I halberd), and good, old fashioned cardio. Physical ability is not the be all, end all of a fight, but it makes up for a lot of sins - and the further into a fight you get, the more fitness will help you, and the less technical skill is able to stand alone. Also, you’ll see that great duelists will get caught up dueling somebody and then they get blasted from the side or back. In HMB it’s funny ‘cause they fall down; IRL, that’s a spear or some other kind of killing blow. 

Range is king. A gun is preferable to a bow is preferable to a spear is preferable to a sword is preferable to a knife. But not only does being able to hit a guy from far away matter, being able to dictate where the fight is taking place and how is important. Getting by the point of a spear is a difficult, often fatal task - but doing it leaves the spearman very vulnerable, especially if they have nowhere to retreat to. 

Dual wielding? Generally for assholes. Ideally you’d have a shield, barring that, a cloak or a two handed weapon. But having a second weapon like a sword or a dagger or an axe beats having nothing at all. You still typically swing them one at a time, though. 

Movements should have a reason and be easily explained. Spinning to spin is pointless, spinning as a set up for a kick or a back fist or a backhanded strike can be justified. Why take two steps when you can take one? If a guy is newer, then sure, step back and then forward to escape and then reengage. If a guy’s more experienced, then just stepping in at an angle and partying or blocking does the same thing in fewer steps. Part of how you set something up is how you attacked previously, though, so it’s worthwhile to explain your character’s motivation for doing it (in my opinion). 

Choreography can and, in my opinion, should tell a story. Does a given fighter use heavy handed strikes? Does he focus on vertical, cleave you from crotch to crown type attacks or horizontal eviscerating blows? Does he thrust a lot? Don’t just focus on what he does well, either - a given fighter might run out of breath or step too heavily and be susceptible to sweeps; maybe he drops his shield when he thrusts, leaving him open to a daring opponent. 

Finally, people stay alive, active, and dangerous for quite some time. I dated a girl who got stabbed and slashed 32 times and survived - she was able to escape her assailant and go door to door seeking aid, eventually making her own 911 call on somebody else’s phone and staying awake until the medics arrived. She was five feet tall and ninety pounds when this happened. 

Finally, too much realism is boring. Just enough is exciting. It’s a fantasy story - yes, it’s exhausting to fight and it’s difficult to fight groups of people, but folks’ll mostly overlook it so long as you either keep a good pace and move right by the unrealistic part or if you explain it well. A good way to explain unrealistic fights well, in my experience, is to watch some hack McDojo martial artist explain how theoretically something would work and then just run it as described with minor tweaks. A lot of stuff works on paper."
kungfu,fd0nw0m,t1_fczcikr,1578121399.0,"That's a good reason to pick your school and to get started and, even if you had taken up Disco Street Fighting or Tap Dance To Kill or something, you're not trying to be an elite MMA fighter (it sounds like, anyways). You've got a great reason to train and it sounds like a great place, and I hope you do well at the UFC gym - though, as your school doesn't train on the mat, expect to get rolled up in BJJ. But, as you say, that's not your school's focus and you need to cross train to be relevant as a martial artist today, so even that's not really discouraging.

&#x200B;

I'm not here to bash kung fu or fighters that are based out of it. Some of my favorite fighters have backgrounds in wushu or sanda, and I am a tremendous fan of kung fu cinema besides. Further, I think the flexibility and athleticism granted by even non-combative wushu is far more applicable in every day life than the grittier, more combative styles like boxing or muay thai. After all, you need to move and pick stuff up every day, you want to not be injured every day, you get seen every day. If you can pick stuff up and move it more easily, be less likely to get injured, and look good, isn't that more practical than training for a fight that will most likely come once or twice in your whole life? 

&#x200B;

All that to say, I hope I'm not coming off like I'm attacking you or what you train. I browse the subreddit hoping to see more examples of effective kung fu and maybe (but doubtfully) find a fighter universally approved as a kung fu man. I say doubtfully because you've got people who say sanda/ sanshou isn't really ""Chinese martial arts"", and many fighters that claim a kung fu background and do well (like Alan Orr's guys) are derided as ""not really Chinese martial arts"".

kungfu,fcz96k4,t1_fcyvkpk,1578096199.0,"Granted, but you rarely see anybody with a kung fu style as their striking base, either. You need to grab for judo and BJJ, too; much of wrestling also centers around grabs, yet these see use in MMA. Muay Thai is very clinch centric, and that sees widespread use. There are even people who have really great wrist control and who make it a point to grab the wrists, the gloves do not impede them. 

As far as utilizing multiple weapons and it hurting you to have your skill set pared down to just punching, alright, that’s fair. You don’t really see nak muay or karateka at the top of boxing or bareknuckle boxing - but they do show up in lethwei, where you have access to everything you listed as well as headbutts and no point based system, so you cannot lose on points. There doesn’t seem to be a reason that kung fu fighters wouldn’t excel at lethwei nor that the striking portion wouldn’t see use in MMA. As we’ve agreed, no one style stands alone - which means that you need two or more to blend. Why have so few chosen a kung fu style as a base?"

Lethwei allows for punching, kicking, knees, elbows, and headbutts and has no grappling or gloves - pretty much the freest available striking rule set. Kung fu styles are not the dominant skill sets there, either. 

I’m not saying kung fu fighters aren’t out there. Zabit Magomedsharipov and Cung Le are two great sanshou practitioners. But I think a lot of people make excuses for things not to work rather than reworking their tools for the situation."
kungfu,fcybqxu,t1_fcxn1bl,1578077781.0,"You don’t see kung fu guys dominating in lethwei or bareknuckle boxing, either, though. I’m on board with “a guy training a single style can’t be compared to the guys training a bunch of overlapping styles”, but the gloves argument always came off weak to me. It’s very rare that kung fu guys get the better of bareknuckle encounters or come out of them looking like masters (or even hardworking journeymen) of their craft - and every time they lose, people are quick to say “that is not real kung fu”."
kungfu,fcybbhr,t1_fcy3ord,1578077593.0,"In general, you seem to have a very low opinion of MMA fighters. For one thing, you over characterize them as all having one style - each fighter has access to the same tool sets, yet employs them differently. 

Dominick Cruz uses unorthodox footwork to set up his knee taps and striking, while somebody like Khabib will just blast a double leg and chain wrestle somebody to the fence before ripping them to the mat. A guy like Tony Ferguson is gonna throw a lot of elbows and vertical fist punches, but a man like Justin Gaethje will hammer leg kicks, hooks, uppercuts, and overhands while seeking the clinch. Stephen Thompson is a karate master, Cody Garbrandt comes from a boxing background, and Zabit Magomedsharipov is a sanshou fighter. Greg Hardy used to play in the NFL, Volkanovski was a rugby player. 

They all have different backgrounds and skill sets and deficiencies. It’s far from “just brawling”. I’m open to you showing some videos of people you feel would “easily” beat men like Max Holloway, Francis Ngannou, etc though. Before you do, I have to ask: Being an MMA champion is a route to millions of dollars. Why, if it’s so easy to beat them and MMA is a style so simple to figure out, has no one come out and conquered the field with their kung fu? Why haven’t you?"

MMA,fcsklek,t1_fcr65xp,1577918471.0,"It’s not entitlement, it’s disappointment. People pay $5.99 for ESPN+, $9.99 for Fight Pass, and $60 (soon to be $65) for numbered cards on a monthly basis. Add $12.99/ month on top of that for Prime and it’s fair to think that, for almost $100/ month, maybe you oughta get all available content. But on top of that, they want to charge $4 for every 18m of this. 

They can do what they want, but it’s disappointing to see business conducted in that manner."

martialarts,fchoy4z,t3_ego5hg,1577652603.0,"I think JKD is a great philosophy from a time when mixing martial arts was uncommon. In today’s day and age it’s a lot more prevalent to cross train and learn a lot of different things, so the distinction between JKD and MMA has dwindled to pretty much nothing. 

Some instructors teach Jun Fan JKD, the style that Bruce Lee developed, but even the man himself said to stick to what works for you - if you’re not physically capable of doing what Bruce Lee could do, why adopt his fighting style? There is no “one way”. I would even go so far as to say that people who peddle JFJKD under the JKD banner are charlatans. A good JKD instructor should, in my opinion, have a decent grasp of multiple ranges (kicking, punching, clinch, and grappling) and be able to instruct people in those to at least a level of basic competence. From there, they should be helping determine what works for you and fostering that growth."

After Masvidal took Till out with a leaping right hook from southpaw, Till fought Gastelum. Gastelum tried that same entry and Till countered by jamming him and clinching. The man clearly develops between losses - maybe not between victories, but he is an evolving fighter.

Edit: And Tyron timed a right counter over Till’s left straight, he didn’t touch him on the chin because his hands were low. His head was stationary, sure, but that’s the aspect of his offensive striking he worked on between bouts."
fatlogic,fc50ckv,t1_fc4w3md,1577436590.0,"Maybe my workouts are too cardio based, but I’m on 2x daily workouts four days a week and one a days for two more, with Sunday rest days, and I’m sitting at 5’10, 165lbs, right at the upper end of the BMI scale. Mon-Thurs are lifting days, too, so it’s not that I don’t lift at all. 

If you’re lifting and eating significantly more than I do, then you’re definitely at the gym more often than the average person. After all, 70% of America is overweight to obese, 33% are obese or higher, and only 23% of Americans get the recommended amount of exercise. It’s safe to say even fewer than that exercise enough to overlap fitness and being overweight; fewer still that use that exercise time specifically to get large with muscle. 

What I’m coming around to is, while you may not physically be a freak, if you define freak as “out of the norm in a big way” then you’re definitely a freak (in a positive way) regarding your dedication and capability. You’re well within natural boundaries, but that strength to size ratio is not exactly something that can reasonably be expected of a given person."
fatlogic,fc4uxey,t1_fc0isg0,1577429406.0,"Not to be macabre but, in the US, at least, birth rates are down while obesity is on the rise. Give it sixty or so years and the problem’ll pretty much fix itself."
fatlogic,fc4tvpq,t1_fc4byou,1577428240.0,"BMI is also just used to figure risk factors, though. If you’re 250lbs, it doesn’t matter if it’s muscle or fat - you’re at higher risk for a lot of things. Your joints are gonna hurt more, your lungs and heart have to work harder. But, on top of that, working out on a regular basis won’t take you out of the BMI norm. You would have to be training pretty extensively to hit that point, and it would be something your doctor either noticed (if you were new with this doc) or knew beforehand (if you were not). 

It’s not a perfect indicator of health, but it’s not meant to be. What it does do perfectly is tell you how much of an increased risk you’re at to develop given complications. To say BMI isn’t good for determining your current state of health is like saying a thermometer isn’t useful for telling me how far above sea level I am."
WingChun,fc4myqm,t1_fc49cbs,1577421495.0,"All other kung fu masters routinely get beat up in earlier movies. When he was based in Fo Shan, an interloper came in and in the first act beat the tar out of the locals. In the second movie, where he was in Hong Kong, he had a run in with the local kung fu masters and also the primary antagonist burst onto the scene by laying down beatings. In the third movie, again, the local kung fu council is defeated. 

All in all, it’s mainly done to show that Ip Man is a cut above. If the villain can best the local badasses and then Ip Man can beat the villain, obviously that makes him king of kung fu."
martialarts,fc3rzf1,t3_efy12f,1577397134.0,"A lot of people want to deride stunt actors for being “actors, not fighters”, but you tend to have to stay in pretty phenomenal shape and have a grasp of at least the basics to be a martial arts stuntman. Combine that with the training footage a lot of these guys release and it’s easy to believe that while they’re not as good as pros, on sheer athleticism and basic form they can probably hold their own against a low to mid talent amateur or any given untrained guy. 

And that’s not to say these actors can’t go pro - after all, Idris Elba found himself a pro kickboxing win at 44 years old. It’s just that the skill set and physical requirements overlap but don’t overtake an actual, high ambition professional’s training."
WingChun,fc2fiwc,t3_efobid,1577357294.0,"The cartoonish villainy of the American antagonists makes Twister look positively reasonable, but the fight scenes were pretty kick ass. It was much grittier than the past movies, I think, in terms of the damage sustained by fighters. The original movie showed some pretty gnarly fights, but most of them were relatively tame compared to Ip Man 4. 

Overall, fun action flick so long as you can get by the really overt propaganda feel."
