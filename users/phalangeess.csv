RandomActsofCards,ff5zybf,t3_ershbr,1579615536.0,"I’d love this! And here’s my story: when I was about 5-6 years old, I had a teddy bear I really loved. One day, I was in kindergarten, just playing with my friends, when I realised I don’t have my teddy bear - I lost it. I panicked and ran around the room to search for it. Suddenly, I saw it on the floor underneath the teacher’s desk. I started running towards the desk, and I didn’t see a plastic bag on the floor, but I slipped on it and broke my right arm. I spent the next few weeks doing everything with my left arm, even eating - which meant spilling a lot of soup. But thankfully, it healed perfectly and it’s as good as new now. :)"

The Holy Trinity presents a unity, and they are a part of one God, at least that’s what i’ve been taught. it’s far from polytheism. but is it necessary to be a polytheist to practice witchcraft?"

needadvice,fci7h14,t3_eh9nx1,1577658653.0,"This could be because people usually subconsciously refuse to accept change, and your relationship was last seen like that, and he continues to behave as if you’re still lacking confidence and as if he’s the number one. 

Had a same thing - my best friend from elementary used to be very mean to me when I was self-consious. When we went to different schools, I gained loads of confidence. Whenever I saw her again though, I would still be the quiet, scared me, and she would be the mean herself she’s used to being towards me. I just decided to stop hanging out with her; it was too much of a hassle and was causing me to feel very bad. 

I don’t have any better advice than to say this: next time you see him, try to act excited to see him. tell him some of the cool things you’re doing, show off a little. try to overpower the conversation, ask him questions, don’t just stand there amazed at his successes quiet, but share your own too and with pride. show how outgoing you can be. 

and if that doesn’t help, maybe it’s time to leave this friendship in the past. i’m sorry for not offering a better advice, good luck! I’d love to hear an update :)

edit: just adding that if he keeps redirecting the conversation towards himself, try to be blunt about it and say “okay, but i was trying to say that i..” and if he interrupts you, ask him why does he keep doing that! sometimes it’s good to be scarily honest - he knows what he’s doing."

Advice,fcf5vy5,t3_eh5w3j,1577626924.0,"I’d advise not telling your parents but try to have a talk with her instead. Please, try not to be patronising or parental, instead, approach her like an open-minded sibling. Is weed legal where you live? If your family is unstable, she likely has no-one to turn to, and just being supportive and being the cool sibling with the “hey, if it’s not going downhill, and you’re not doing anything that could ruin your life, i’m there for you and i won’t say anything.” would be great. That way, if something actually goes downhill, and if she ever gets into something worse, she’ll know she can turn to you for help, without causing too much hassle in an already chaotic family.

edit: just wanted to add, don’t try to forbid her to smoke. she won’t listen to you, and it would just make your relationship worse. express your opinion about it, but remember everyone has their own choice."
Advice,fceysls,t3_eh5h4i,1577624953.0,"Ouch. I was in a similar situation a year ago, but we didn’t see each other on a daily basis, thank God. 

Would you rather tell the truth to Alan, lie to him or avoid the topic? I warmly suggest going with the truth, because no matter how difficult the topic is, I think it’s better to hear the truth than to be lied to. I’m not sure if this is a good advice, but I would pull Alan aside and say something along the lines of “I have something to tell you. Yesterday we went out and this and this happened.” (Don’t go into details (such as “i touched her knee and she kissed me”) and don’t justify yourself with the “i was tipsy” or “she came on to me first” or anything remotely similar.) 

You can say “I understand if you feel hurt or betrayed, and I apologize. I’d like you to know that I treasure our friendship and I wouldn’t like to lose you.” Shape this into your own vocabulary to sound honest, but try to sound unambiguous. 

Good luck!"

INTP,fc4ylri,t3_efyngy,1577434118.0,"“INTPs are not usually liars. In fact, they are far more likely to be chastised for being too bluntly honest to the tune of, “That’s awful/weird/absurd!” or “How can you say something like that?” Rather than lying, INTPs are more likely to clam up and hide what they feel or think completely.” - citation from The Secret Lives of INTPs by Anna Moss. 

I might be analyzing this too deeply (sorry can’t help it, I’m an INTP myself!), but if you’d really like to know, see what words he used to make you know you’re welcome in his home. INTPs tend to pick their words very carefully at times, especially if they’re trying to *avoid* the truth. So if he simply said you can come around and he wants to meet you, he probably means that! It’s not odd for an intp to be on-and-off, even though that must suck to deal with. 

Now, if his words don’t directly say that you can visit him / that he would like to meet you / whatever message he sent, I’d suggest asking him about it. You can say something like “Hey, just to be clear, when you said _____ did you mean ______?” Because he might be either trying to avoid directly inviting you (but he doesn’t want to be an asshole and not offer a place to stay), or (if you’re romantically involved) he’s just afraid of putting his feelings out and he’s working his way into inviting you but without sounding too desperate.
