That‚Äôs a wild assumption to think that making a phone call telling Santa that they‚Äôve been bad would fuck them up. Maybe your friend is a shitty parent. My kids kick ass

news,fefph4v,t1_feev4q7,1579061551.0,"I‚Äôm 28 and riding the fence. The funniest part about writing that, is that I accidentally typed 39 and it made way more sense...

On my way home from work today a semi truck ride into my lane, damaged the rear axel of the hybrid car I bought in July, and now I‚Äôm going to pay out of pocket for the damages and my insurance premium might go up.

I finally started visiting the doctor and dentist this year after avoid them since leaving my parents‚Äô insurance, and it cost me thousands this year. It‚Äôs insane the world we live in. 

I have two kids, and they a huge financial and psychological burden. It‚Äôs insane how much I love them, and yet I‚Äôve never been more stressed t work and provide for them. Not only did I get into an accident today, but one of my kids is sick so I have to take the day off tomorrow. It only compounds my problems. 

Suicide, drugs and alcohol cross my mind daily. It‚Äôs a real struggle to fend off the urge to do them all at once."
