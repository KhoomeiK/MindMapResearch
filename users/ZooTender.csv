family,fe0hzui,t1_fe0c0u6,1578813735.0,"OP: you should REALLY look at things this way, for sure.

""just don't make her feel bad about it because that will just push her further away."" - YES so true. See my whole life as the example. 

""How totally cool your daughter has so many people in her life that love her so much?"" - just keep this mantra going in your head on repeat, forever. 

@acrystalroze thank you for posting something shorter than the novel I shared - it's spot on & from a mom's POV!"
family,fe0heel,t3_enibai,1578813472.0,"My husband shared your story with me, thinking I might have some insight for you. I'm the oldest daughter of divorced parents, & I've been where your daughter is now. 

I can't imagine how hard it is for you right now, but just know that if you can keep a cool head & keep your emotions in check you can end up in a really beneficial situation that will help your daughter tremendously. & you'll end up with a kid who has a better support system than anyone else, what with having a 3 (or 4, if you have a SO too) person parenting team.

She's 7. She doesn't/can't understand *right now* (or for years & years, probably) that you're not a SAH mom because you're working to provide for her & give her everything & every advantage you can. If you harbor a jealously towards her stepmom, keep it leashed. Don't let your daughter get any inkling that you are jealous, dislike, or even flat out hate her other mom. ((yeah, you might not like it, but your kid has 2 moms now.)) 

The relationship that your daughter can develop with her stepmom is important too. And if you can work *together* with the stepmom & your ex, you can create a REALLY strong foundation for your daughter. It might not seem important right now, but as your daughter gets older, experiences adversity, body changes, friendship strife, troubles, etc, having that strong relationship with you AND with her stepmom is important. It gives her someplace soft to land with *either of you* when needs come up. And if you can *work together* with her stepmom to create plans & communicate when these things do come up, then your daughter will benefit even more. 

Is that what happened in my own experience? Hell no. My mom was jealous AF of my stepmom, & it caused a lot of issues with our own relationship, as well as my relationship with the other half of my family. My mom displayed & verbalized her dislike of my stepmom (& my dad. I'm 29 now, & it's still a really messy divorce with all kinds of weird problems. maybe my mom just likes the drama?). I tried to be ""loyal"" to my mom & keep myself distant from my stepmom & my dad, but it was lonely. My dad & my stepmom didn't let my distance keep them from trying with me, & we ended up with a REALLY strong relationship. For about 8 years my mom & I barely spoke, not for lack of trying on my part. We're building a relationship again, finally, but it's been hard. 

I would have loved to have had 4 parents I could turn to for help instead of feeling like I was completely on my own."

Embroidery,fddadw2,t3_ekhu5i,1578302407.0,That is incredibly beautiful & so intricately detailed! I love how you did some color management & used the weave structure to your benefit near the bottom of your piece to kinda look like water/ripples/waves before moving up in to the rest of your piece.
AnimalsBeingDerps,fd7k663,t1_fd7j121,1578205770.0,"It would be a great training place! The crowds & cramped aisles would be super helpful with training your pup to ignore everyone (& everything) else & focus solely on you. Especially because I always see kids running around without their parents üôÑ they'd probably go nuts too see your dude in the store. 

Good luck!"

The cashier seemed super excited at the prospect of me trying to bring in 1 decently trained pitsky & 3 super excitable Siberian Huskies ü§¶ she said that Marshall's is pet friendly! 

Though the Marshall's here is right next to a Petco or PetSmart (I can't keep the damn chain pet stores straight) so maybe it's to keep people from killing their dogs out in the parking lot by leaving them in hot cars in the summer? I dunno."
