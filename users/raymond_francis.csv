Unexpected,ff7bfdo,t3_erxgs2,1579645495.0,How is this unexpected? We've all see Robin Hood Prince of Thieves.
UKPersonalFinance,ff2oeww,t1_ff2m0jo,1579516276.0,"You need to get on the aldi and lidl biscuit selection next year - thems the tits, every one has thick chocolate on and it's a really weighty box. No disappointment there."
BuyItForLife,fexn0yo,t1_feunfg4,1579433500.0,"Codswallop means nonsense, old wives tales etc. Not junk or poorly produced items. Different meaning."
WTF,fepf1de,t1_fepbpd6,1579318880.0,There have been multiple incidents of normal upstanding citizens confronting young men and teenagers (in the UK) and receiving savage beatings and even being murdered for their trouble. Just for asking them to stop littering in one case. I don't know why they were laughing but don't be too hasty to judge.
facepalm,femoq88,t1_femhybv,1579264975.0,"Thanks for your considered thoughts. I was asking their opinion on a subject I have an interest in - nowhere did I indicate that I was looking for advice, but assume what you will. I hope your day gets better x"
facepalm,femftjk,t1_femfg68,1579253272.0,"Fair point. I didn't even think there was a vaccine, probably because of this https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/chickenpox-vaccine-questions-answers/"
facepalm,femema5,t1_femed4u,1579251491.0,"What do you think about it? We mixed our children when they were tiny when we knew their friends had it because getting it when they're young is fairly harmless vs getting when you're an adult. It's pretty much par for the course, never heard of anyone who doesn't want to do it."
thalassophobia,fej41v3,t1_feisltq,1579156101.0,None. I've also never been to the sun but I know it's hot. What's your point?
thalassophobia,fej3y3c,t1_feiua63,1579155991.0,It could be an iceberg but it could also be a meltwater lake/river which can be hundreds of meters above sea level on top of a glacier.
thalassophobia,fehk7pl,t3_ep4l5g,1579118229.0,"Hardly anything gets me on here but that had me almost looking away. Those glacial rivers/pools can suddenly drain in seconds with no warning, with no way of knowing where you'd be spat out or just get stuck and drowned somewhere inside."
xbiking,fe2ea7y,t3_enl596,1578837399.0,I bought a retro GT for a song with a rad paint job a couple of years ago - high original spec components and great condition but I just didn't have the room for it. I sold it to a local guy for a healthy profit but I still look out for it in the hope I'll see it about. Ridiculous as I won't be buying it off him but the heart wants what the heart wants! I feel for you.
UKPersonalFinance,fdy4wyg,t1_fdxrz1o,1578776188.0,"Yes yes, poor people deserve to rot in their filth. How dare they breathe! Shocking. Are you a tory by any chance, because you sound like one? Tell me - what percentage of the population qualify as reckless and what percentage are worthy poor?"
cycling,fds66vp,t3_emxil0,1578695254.0,"I always thought I was fine without until my brother bought me some for Christmas a few years ago and they are a game changer - they're thermal winter leggings and I find my legs just have more to give when they're warm. Makes sense, warm muscles perform better. Whether they are necessary is up to you and what you want out of your riding. For me it made my commute easier in cold weather."
mildlyinfuriating,fdrdgl7,t1_fdqzt2c,1578682990.0,Pretend a public pool is a layer cake. Guess where all that slimy hairy poop particle fuck-knows-what else inhabits? Right where your face is - that glorious top layer. Don't lick your lipsssss......
britishproblems,fdn6zgj,t1_fdmwm02,1578579003.0,You can get umbrella-fold strollers that are suitable from birth.
LV426,fdi5s7c,t1_fdhzglb,1578436233.0,"You clearly think you own the franchise, oh gatekeeper."
trashyboners,fdec7ae,t1_fde1zub,1578335838.0,"I grew up with a friend who has a massive cock and yes he said he'd rather have an average one. It hurt his girlfriend if he went too deep, he felt lightheaded and woozy with a full stonk on and he felt frustrated as he could never really go for it and pound away - always trying to judge stroke length and never go conkers deep. He could only ever really enjoy a wank and that's a shit way to live."
UKPersonalFinance,fdcjwfy,t1_fdcco3j,1578276730.0,You should plan for the very real possibility it doesn't work like it should or some other reason among many that it doesn't end up happening. You can lmao all you want but breast feeding doesn't work for everyone regardless of best intentions.
UKPersonalFinance,fdcjoia,t1_fdchykq,1578276573.0,"For somebody who is about to have a child with no maternity pay then yes the £3000 figure you have is ridiculous, regardless of what they earn now. How do you know what their current outgoings are? They may be up to the limit each month. I'm not arguing that these products don't exist, I'm saying you have been mugged if you bought them when perfectly safe, user friendly and long lasting alternatives exist at much lower price points. The £60 IKEA solid wood cot with adjustable height settings cost us £60. Mattress was extra I'll give you that. It was made of beech if I recall, not chipboard, and it converted to a toddler bed later. Who cares if it matches the drawers? The baby doesn't! What baby clothes are you hanging in a wardrobe that can't go in a chest of drawers? You've been sold shit you didn't need and are salty about it. I spend where I need to - we also have expensive car seats (woo hoo!). You mentioned the pram again, it must bug you that you wasted nearly a grand. A lie flat stroller for £200 does the same job. Lie flat like a bed, as you pointed out. Then they sit up and you still use the same stroller! You said a car seat can be laid flat with an expensive pram. They cannot. The angle of the seat can be tilted but it does not change the position if the baby in the seat."
FellingGoneWild,fdchq7u,t1_fdcbzhd,1578275185.0,I'm honestly surprised you've not had any punch throughs because I've seen it a number of times. Large and medium laterals can snap off on impact and the sharp stub goes in with the full weight of the tree pushing it in. What about the sign? Why couldn't you climb it?
UKPersonalFinance,fdcg8mk,t1_fdcfmry,1578274141.0,"Exactly where did I say I'd cheap out on a car seat? You say you can counter my points, I can say the same."
bristol,fdceoyy,t3_ekliuy,1578273062.0,Do you mean cattle market road?
UKPersonalFinance,fdccivm,t1_fdccaui,1578271601.0,I know - top 5% all over.
UKPersonalFinance,fdcbxjb,t1_fdc3ngy,1578271234.0,Send it to them out of the goodness of your heart. BE THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO SEE!
UKPersonalFinance,fdcbmrm,t1_fdbyq3f,1578271054.0,"This guy is mental and he's either delusional or winding you up. £600 cot? £900 pushchair! Fuck me. Even buying new those are firmly stick up your arse prices. Check Facebook marketplace and gumtree. Moses basket for £10, cot for £20 easy, new from IKEA £60. Forget a travel system, the only benefit to having one is that you can (with optional extras) move your sleeping child from the car to a pushchair seamlessly. But when you consider that an infant shouldn't be left in a car seat for longer than absolutely necessary because of the position of the spine and overheating issues you quickly realise they are pointless. An umbrella fold stroller that's suitable from birth (has ability to lie flat) is all you need until they start walking. Travel systems are huge and they occupy your whole boot. Strollers fold up and are much cheaper in comparison. Because of how often you'll use it spend a couple of hundred at least, we had a cosatto supa something and we're very happy with it for two of ours. Even sent it for replacement wheels half way through. Also a lot is said about stokke tripp trapp high chairs - they are worth the hype and again when considering cost per use they are worth it for a good second hand one. Again, no reason to buy new for a product designed to last until adulthood. Ps they can puke a lot when small especially if they get a cold so it's worth having a shit load of sheets and bedding. It's no fun at three in the morning when you run out of clean/dry baby grows and sheets and have nothing to put them in because they sicked up 15 times in half an hour. Children are stressful, some people breeze it and some people want to kill themselves, support from each other will get you through it. Sorry for the essay but I've had a bit to drink and I have a 6 and a 4 year old. Ask away if you have any questions"
UKPersonalFinance,fdc9nk0,t1_fdc1olm,1578269847.0,Second this - HUGE fucking assumption. Plan for £15-20/week on formula.
FellingGoneWild,fda00ts,t1_fd9y3sd,1578240105.0,"Unless the area is marked for development and the street/pavement is being ripped up soon, or some other similar situation, nobody should be dropping them like that. They hit the sign although it looks like they got away with it, who knows how much of the heavy timber punched through and what will have to be repaired.

Is this OC? Does the OP have a reason why it wasn't dismantled? Genuinely curious."

PublicFlashing,fcyl6ok,t1_fcyi2ap,1578082034.0,Yes I get that not everyone will like it. Its one of those things that I just can't wrap my head around like feeders or scat.
PublicFlashing,fcyhsi1,t3_ejgfr0,1578080400.0,I've never seen somebody who's head looks and moves like a Barbie doll as much as this. Her lips don't move at all. I'll never kink shame but the fake look is baffling to me.
explainlikeimfive,fcv9d1b,t1_fcv4mby,1577997362.0,The term 'selective hearing' just means pretending to not be able to hear what you'd rather ignore. Like children being asked to tidy up and children being asked if they'd like some chocolate. They'll magically not be able to hear you when you ask the former.

UKPersonalFinance,fcsoa1b,t1_fcsmjoq,1577920965.0,You're potentially doing somebody else out of a house at the lower price who might actually want to live there - not just turn a profit. Just become a landlord if you want to screw people for money.
FellingGoneWild,fcs2kzh,t3_eilyxl,1577910522.0,"Just in case you weren't convinced from the other replies, you should get somebody in for this and not attempt it yourself. You could possibly save costs if you can deal with/remove everything once it's on the floor but you'll have to discuss that with whoever you employ. Good luck."
bikecommuting,fcl59ig,t3_ehqy5q,1577740100.0,Several people do it that I see along my route. They're heading into a major city so they park on the outskirts and ride in. Big downside I can see is if you get battered by the rain you've either got to change by your car still getting wet or get your seats wet.
MorbidReality,fcl420f,t1_fcl2fn5,1577739349.0,You honestly think because the UK has the odd knife attack it is somehow worse and less safe than the US?  [Mass shooting in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States_in_2019). I grant you that with a much larger population comparing UK to US figures is misleading but the initial comment was about feeling safe. They don't feel safe anywhere - I feel safe everywhere.
MorbidReality,fckv5xc,t1_fckogro,1577733878.0,I was thinking how odd the statement seemed and I couldn't put my finger on why it didn't seem right. Then I realised it's because I'm in the UK and I feel perfectly safe almost everywhere.
bristol,fck3r8s,t1_fck1tfq,1577715712.0,Nice. If you take a second to see when I commented details hadn't yet been released. But OK I'll fuck myself.

AskReddit,fc6tcvd,t1_fc659lv,1577488983.0,He's got it all wrong brother - the medieval war hammer is where it's at for melee. A halberd is too showy and can snag easily on clothing or armour making it difficult to take repeated swings for multiple enemies. This is a cringe as fuck video but you get the idea of what a war hammer is capable of - [there's no resisting the spike](https://youtu.be/qhknaG9ifbs?t=93)
