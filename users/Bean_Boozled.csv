naturalbodybuilding,ff7boc6,t3_es1jsn,1579645715.0,"First, there are no mixed opinions on squats and deadlifts from anybody who knows what they're doing. If you have proper form, and use proper safety, you will avoid injuries. You're making yourself do far more work for no reason by excluding those two, as they are very beneficial for leg and back growth, respectively. Second, the ""bro split"" is very effective, and can be as effective as any other regimen. What matters is which training program works for YOU. There's a reason why many bodybuilders use ""bro splits"", and why many use other methods: if it works with your schedule and how you like to train, it'll be effective for you. I will say that your leg day needs more actual leg workouts, instead of the conditioning work you are doing. Throw out all of the garbage you're doing for legs other than lunges, and throw in squats(or other types of heavy weight work, if you REALLY are against all forms of squatting). Your leg days will be shorter, but also 1000x more effective. Your chest, arms, and back all need more variation in exercises, you're doing far too little work if you want to be serious about progress; shoulders you're barely doing anything at all... Each muscle group should be worked fully, not just one or two movements to isolate them. In short: quit fucking around on leg day, start actually working out your shoulders, and stop listening to people who say that they don't squat or deadlift because they're afraid of getting hurt; they don't squat or deadlift because they're too lazy or stupid to do hard work. Regardless, hope all goes well for ya man!"

Either you have no idea how to determine bodyfat %, or you have literally no muscle on your body. You pick which one makes more sense. The method you used is known to be inaccurate. It's not good for determining exact bf%, it's more to get a very rough estimate and keep track of whether you're gaining/losing fat. No offense man, but you don't seem to know what you're doing. You cut down to a decent shape(although lacking too much muscle to be cutting anyways), but then just put on a bunch of water and fat during your rebound diet. You say you ended around 13%, but that's total bullshit judging by the pic you posted. Looks more like you were around 12-14% when cut, and then went up to like 20-25% to end. You didn't get below 8% bodyfat, you're just lanky and lack mass, which makes you look like you have less fat in certain areas(like the one you focused on in the pics lol). Furthermore, you don't get that lean and ""feel good"". That's the BIGGEST red flag in your nonsense story(other than the obvious bits of fat/lack of definition).

If you're a veteran SWG player and don't really care about that, then really you could do however many crafters as you want to specialize in; just keep in mind that unless you really go all in with every single crafting char(which will be VERY expensive), you could easily just buy better gear from vendors or the bazaar to save both time and credits. Of course, it is cool seeing how the different crafter types work, so if you get bored of one you can also respec and redo the character.
