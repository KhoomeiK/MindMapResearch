AskVet,ff1i0ya,t1_ff0qzwt,1579479541.0,"I haven't had her and I'm unsure if she is been  Over weight at any point. The vet said the enzymes were what pointed to fatty liver but they didn't do any ultra sounds or anything else.  He did do a blood test and that's how we ruled out infection or diabetes.

 The vet gave me an update and said that with hand feeding she has been eating, But I will ask about the feeding to when I go in to see them."

fatlogic,fduabuy,t3_emqf8o,1578730311.0," I work as a server so I can eat over 2000 calories  a day and still be skinny.  I actually keep losing way even though I'm eating a ton of food!


 Back when I was bigger  I didn't burn as many calories because I didn't exercise or have an active job.

 Also when I eat out / junk that's all I eat for the whole day."
personalfinance,fdqy7r2,t3_emqyx6,1578676615.0,"I wish more people understood the amount of time and money pets take.  I got a cat because I thought that he would be less of a time investment but I still need to play with him quite a lot and snuggle him quite a lot or he gets lonely. That's OK because I got him to keep me company! 

But I see all these people who get dogs and don't get them their shots or get them spayed or neutered or train them or play with them and then the dog becomes aggressive or destroys their furniture and they get rid of it."

eczema,fdkx6qm,t1_fdkuby4,1578513004.0,"The last big flare I had  2 weeks ago I tested this by popping the blisters on one hand and not popping them on the other hand.  I actually found that popping them made the wounds heal faster and moved it to the scaling stage. 

 I find that wrapping them in bandages after popping and putting the steroid cream or even neosporin on after popping helps with the pain!

 I hope your eczema gets better soon!"
