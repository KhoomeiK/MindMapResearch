Dublin,fcgqvxa,t1_fcg7218,1577643081.0,I didn't realize brewdog had opened yet. Thanks for the heads up!
TheExpanse,fcf7w2g,t3_egul2z,1577627403.0,I'd personally like to see some pre discovery  Trek cast show up somewhere. Or someone from the cast of Dark Matter.
TheExpanse,fcf7d65,t1_fca21n1,1577627286.0,"To be fair, I really enjoyed Hamill in Knightsfall, and didn't ruin the immersion at all.

That being said, Hamill seems like the wrong casting for this type of show for some reason."
Dublin,fcetsef,t3_eh5453,1577623707.0,"For renting -- Good luck. That was a battle for me. It's not impossible, but it's damn hard. When you get into the 2000 range or higher though for rent, it does ease up a bit, so here's to hoping you're well off! Otherwise many have stated ""just don't say anything"" -- For me, that was too much added paranoia, so I forgoed it and painstakingly found a place.  
As for overall etiquette, dogs are ridiculously friendly here (well, the majority). You will see dogs off leash more times than not. If your dog is an asshole, you will likely have issues (just keep them on a leash and work on socializing them slowly).

No dogs parks in the city, but plenty of greenspace -- pretty much dogs are allowed in all of them \[on leash\].  


Taxis are hit and miss. Completely at the discretion of the taxi. If you have a little dog that does look shaggy and not a lap dog, you likely will get denied. Assuming thats your pup in the picture, you'll be fine.  


Luas doesn't \*officially\* allow dogs, but some people do it... I generally avoid it personally. the DART **does** allow dogs though, so relatively easy to travel with them. Note that many of the Monuments and castles don't allow dogs there, so check before you embark on a trip with fido.   

If you plan on traveling, get an EU passport for your dog -- though you may already have that since you've lived in London."
Dublin,fces9f5,t1_fcel9fg,1577623270.0,"Pretty sure they're wrong. There's an adequate amount of places where you can take your dog in with you. Its up to the establishment though, and most places don't. There's a Google Maps list with some options near St. Stephens green.  


There's a few articles on it, I'd just Google it: [https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/food-and-drink/chow-down-pets-are-now-legally-allowed-in-restaurants-but-are-they-welcome-1.3402353](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/food-and-drink/chow-down-pets-are-now-legally-allowed-in-restaurants-but-are-they-welcome-1.3402353)"

Either way using Opera VPN as a work around shows that something is blocking his traffic.

Betting on it being girlfriend."
dogs,fc742i9,t1_fc6z5md,1577496984.0,"Poor people can't afford to take care of their dog in a way that won't be shitty to their dog, or massively fuck up their lives if something happens.


Stop being so emotional about this. If you don't have money to take care of something properly, which includes the emergencies that occur, your shouldn't own an animal. Period. 

It's animal cruelty to do anything less."
dogs,fc6hsdg,t1_fc6h3yh,1577480892.0,"You don't deserve a dog if you can't provide for it, just as it is for a child or relationship. You trying to justify that it's okay to not plan for the unexpected is naive and dangerous to the dog."
dogs,fc6fkxp,t1_fc5jhmk,1577479403.0,"So what's your solution when a dog has cancer or needs some expensive surgery? 
What about a dog who develops an allergy which requires a really expensive diet?

Why is it okay for you to put down a dog or ""just make them live with it"" because you can't afford to handle something that comes up.


It's not gatekeeping, it just not treating an animal like a disposable toy, and more like a family member.

Your obvious retort will be ""well I'll give them up if it comes to that"". Animals have emotions too, why is it okay for them to go through that because you're irresponsible

The road to hell is paved by the best intentions. Just because you haven't hit any issues yet, doesn't mean you won't"
