The poster above me acted as if a service that wasn't available 0.5% of the total time (4 hours out of a month) should only be 0.5% cheaper than the price for the full time.

Obviously it isn't.

The difference between 99% and 99.999% is less than a percent, but the difference in price is much, much more.

Saying that if you pay $19 a month for a service and you have four hours of outage the difference in value is only a dime is stupid.

Yes that would be what you paid for every 4 hours if you broke it up, but you aren't paying per hour, you pay to have the service as close to always as possible and the difference between 100% of the time and 99.5% of the time is a lot more than 0.5% of the total value of that service.

The people who make the SLA contracts understand that and ask much more the more nines you want.

I mean, as a customer, in your mind and ignorant of the actual contract you signed, you are not paying for a service to be available for 24 hours in a given period that happens to be 24 hours long, you are paying for it to be available the entire time.

If a product only works two times of of three it isn't worth two thirds of the product that works almost all the time to most people.

Even the service providers agree with this. 

An availability of two nines does not cost more or less the same as an availability of five nines. mathematically there is less than 1% of a difference between 99% and 99.999%, but price wise a service with a 5 9s guarantee cost significantly more than one which only promises 2 9s.

If you find a worm in an apple and bring it back to the guy who sold it to you and they tell you that by volume only a tiny fraction of the apple was actually worm or wormhole, you will not appreciate that sort of math.

At least in their minds they do.

In the contracts they sign something different will be written.

They are wrong, but I get where they might get their wrong ideas from.

Of course, if some customer calls their customer provider to complain that they are losing big money every minute their service is down because they are using it for business and it turns out that they are not a business plan because they thought they might save themselves some money, that is just stupid.

Service providers need to communicate clearly to their customers what they are actually providing for the money they are getting. If everyone is on the same page things are much easier.

If marketing and sales leaves customers with the wrong impression and than has some poor call center drone sort out the misconceptions, that is a wrong if profitable way of going about things."

The rules for the stuff that you make them do are fairly simple, the actual math is mostly build in on a hardware level and the computer can do millions of such operations per second.

Early pocket calculators sometimes actually took a noticeable amount of time to present you the results of some more demanding calculations but by the time I got to use one in school (I am old) The only thing that could give them pause was to do crazy stuff like taking the factorial of a too large number.

Modern computers won't be slowed by such a task anymore. They are fast.

Remember that every single pixel on your screen and every single sound from your speakers is the result of some part of the computer doing some math somewhere and you end up with a lot of pixels and really complicated sounds without ever thinking anything of it.

On a hardware level you can look at stuff like how you can use simple logic gates to build stuff like adders and how these can be used to make a computer do simple addition on two numbers and everything else sort of builds from there.

The important part to keep in mind though is that when your computer is described with terms like GHz or gigahertz this literally means that it can do a billion things a second. It may take several of those things to do the full calculation you want it to do, but it can do billions of them in less time than it takes you to count to 1.

Your body is not just made of muscles, you have all sorts of other stuff in there and evolution has it fined tuned to the world you live in. 

Just think about blood. People can get lightheaded just from sitting for a while and trying to get up too fast. People have died because they sat for too long without moving. Sitting in an airplane seat for a long flight can give you thrombosis and kill you. 

There is a reason why really tall people tend to die before they get old. Your heart simply won't be able to keep up with the strain of living under significantly higher than normal gravity for too long. 

Our sekeltons are barely adapted for walking upright and when doing something simple like lifting something up with our arms we have to remember posture and lifting with our legs not our backs to avoid doing ourselves harm. 

Living in high G environments would be like being morbidly obese for our skeletons and joints. Not a recipe for growing old. 

What about all the plumbing inside you? Stuff works fine in zero G or when doing a handstand, but it might not work so well in higher G environments.

What happens the first time you have hicup in a high G environment? You may really hurt yourself. 

Just look at some earth animals that are a bit larger than us humans to see what might go wrong with the human body under high G. 

Our bones are too thin, our feet are all wrong, our heart isn't big enough, nothing quite fits. 

Did you know that for a horse throwing up is a life or death thing? their long necks simply make it too hard. What do you think would be the highest gravity under which a human throat could work to alow to be sick without killing you? 

Then there is all that every day stuff. Our insicts would be all out of whack for high G environments. We might be able to adapt in time to relearn the new instincts mecessary, but we would be especially clumsy in the meantime. 

Every accident would be a lot more dangerous though.

On Earth a toddler falling flat their face will be fine, but and adult doing the same would be in serious danger because their head has more time to accelerate on the way down. 

If you trip and fall on a high G world, you will be much more likely to do yourselves harm. Beyond a certain amount of gravity a fall from a standing position may be certain death and the higher the gravity gets the harder balancing will be as trying to right yourself will require more and more energy that you simply can't bring to bear. 

Your ankles would be prone to injury just from stepping wrong and once unbalanced the likelihood of coming away without and broken bones would decrease drastically. 

And then there would be your muscles. Sure at first they would adapt the easiest, but keep in mind that muscles have mass too. Putting on mre muscles would mean that your muscles would have to work harder to carry them around. Skipping leg day would really not be an option. 

The end result would not be pretty.

Imagine a bunch of ocatgenarians doing crossfit and pakour. Some might do surprisingly well, but it would only be a question of time before the lot of them got themselves killed.

Pennies don't weigh all that much and will tumble as they fall due to their poor aerodynamics. The relatively sedate velocity at which they hit the ground squared times their mass divided by two is the kinetic energy they have when they land and it is not much.

Dropping something else like a heavy metal dart,rod, bullet with fins from high up can actually be very lethal and militaries in the past have used such simple device (called flechettes) from planes with nothing but their own weight and gravity to turn them into lethal projectiles. 

Raindrops don't have quite the same punch. They are made of water and thus have a much lower density than anything else and they tend to be soft and use up most of the kinetic energy they have by splashing themselves on the ground rather than transferring that energy to deform the ground and cause damage.

They still can cause some damage if enough drops of water hit the same spot over and and over again for long enough, but randomly dropping raindrops, don't.

They are too small too random and too fluid to do much damage.

It all depends a lot on the border in question. Some borders in Europe are of the sort where you only notice them because the road surface gets a bit worse/better and signs look slightly different. Some borders you might not notice at all unless you look closely.

Other borders are heavily fortified and deadly to even get near.

Many borders in Europe are the result of centuries of warfare and peace treaties with complicated histories about who rules what when. Many other borders are the result of some English guy with a ruler drawing a line on a map.

Exact locations are usually hashed out in treaties and marked with border markers. If the surveyors placing the markers were off by a bit from what was agreed in the treaty the markers count.

Often natural borders like rivers are chosen, because they make a convenient place to stop invading armies anyway and they are already drawn on the map. Unfortunately rives shift their location over time requiring neighboring countries to work hard to keep up.

Energy is just the ability to do work stored in some way.

You pick a stone up from the ground and hold it at about chest height and the stone now contains some potential energy, from the work you di by lifting it up. if you drop the stone the potential energy will be transformed into kinetic energy as it falls, and the kinetic energy can perform work by deforming whatever it is the stone hits when it lands and by making a sound and by heating up a bit.

Oil is just a complicated molecule that you can add oxygen too to turn into different molecules. The resulting molecules will hold slightly less chemical energy than the stuff going in and the difference gets emitted as heat and light.

You can do the same thing with flowers. Pick a flower, set it on fire and watch it burn. Oil and coal is just plant stuff that has been dead for a really long time.

The flower and the original plant stuff that became the oil and coal got their energy from the sun.

Sound is just air moving around in a pattern. You can try to turn that into different more useable types of energy. This is how microphones work. turning sounds into electric signals.

Computer store letters like ""A"" as numbers like ""65"". Back before computer were commonly networked, many different computer used different numbers for different letters.

Once people started to transfer texts between different computers more and more this became a problem as those texts either came out as gibberish or had to be converted with the knowledge what sort of computer they came from.

Then ASCII was born. It was single unified standard about which number used which letter and everyone used it and all was well.

Except the A in ASCII stands for American and the standard only covered the sort of letters Americans commonly used.

People from countries that used additional or different  characters build on that in different ways, so you could easily transfer documents that only used the normal alphabet and some standard symbols, but as soon as someone added letters that aren't used in the US or symbols like fancy quotation marks, there was no guarantee they would come out right on another computer.

Worse yet some people didn't use the Latin alphabet that you use to write english at all. There were documents written in Greek or Cyrillic or Arabic or Hebrew that did things completely differently. and then there were Asian languages using thousands of different Chinese symbols.

It was quite a mess.

So everyone got together and they created on standard that would include every single character or punctuation mark or symbol that anyone might conceivably use to write documents. Every letter or symbol or grapheme that might ever be used to write something on a computer was included.

In the process they also included a lot of things we would not normally consider letters or characters, but that people had been using on computers as characters.

They included everything that was already in use by someone, so that any texts already written could be converted to the new standard without missing any characters.

Enter Japan.

One code for writing letters in Japan (for there were many) included a number of funny little symbols used in some obscure messaging applications. (The Japanes already had thousands of different characters so adding a few more wasn't that frivolous to them.)

The people who created the Unicode wanted to create a code that would include all the letters. They didn't set out to include all sorts of funny pictures, but they wanted to be complete. So they put it all in.

The general thinking was along the lines of ""I don't think anyone will ever want to write a document with these, but just in case there are any important documents out there in Japan that have a small picture of an eggplant in them for some reason, we will put it in the code so that the document will work.""

I guess everyone was rather surprise when instead of some obscure side note, these emojis became a major use case of the standard. People use them all the time and everyone wanted lots of additional emojis to extend what was already there.

Imagine trying to embark on an ambitious project to catalogue and quantify all human writing and people are more interested if you can add a female poop emoji for the sake of diversity.

It must have been pretty weird.

But they rolled with it and it works.

In practice documents and text with emojis are just like any other text on your computer or phone. And the pictures shown are treated like fonts.

Unicode doesn't say what the emoji has to look like just what it is and it is up to the makers of the OS or font to decide how it looks in practice. This is why an Emoji will look slightly different on Android, Windows and apple devices.

It is up to the maker of the devices to decide which emojis from the code they have pictures for and what pictures they use.

In some cases the Unicode people used concepts they already had from all their language encoding to make work easier for them. 

They use stuff like combining characters.

Instead of creating male and female versions for all exiting characters based on popular demand they just decided that if you write your normal emoji with a male or female symbol next to it, that should be displayed as a male or female version of the original symbol. the same goes for the stuff with emoji with different skin colors.

A very clever thing was found to deal with all the country flags. Instead of creating symbols for the flags of all countries and their states and what not and having to update it regularly as things change and getting into argument with people who don't recognize the existence of some countries, they just decided to create 26 symbols with values of a to z and declared that if some text contained two of these special letters next to each other and the two letters were a valid code for a country they should display the flag of that country. There problem solved and now it was up to the device makers to figure out what are real countries and keep that list of symbols up to date."

Accents may make a character sound like they are uneducated, due to prejudices many people have. If that isn't what you are going for you should stay away from it.

Viewpoint is also important. Your viewpoint character will consider the way they speak normal, so even if they speak with an accent you can render it as normal English, because that is how they think they are speaking.
