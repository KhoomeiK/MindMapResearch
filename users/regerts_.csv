todayilearned,ff6bzsa,t1_ff69det,1579623878.0,You say it's wrong and dangerous but all you did was explain the scientific method over the course of three paragraphs...
todayilearned,ff6apga,t1_ff5utt8,1579623057.0,"I'd say most people are like that. Some just don't care to put on the act of caring, and honestly, I prefer that. At least I don't have to do the mind reading/guess work to know. Saves for a lot of drama right up front."
HistoryMemes,ff4m05f,t1_ff4jjb3,1579566852.0,"While that's always a possibility, I think the good Reverend would have wanted to see this kind of change from the FBI. Considering the past, this is a huge improvement."
Awwducational,ff1widc,t1_ff1m61q,1579487774.0,He wasn't almost anywhere because he stole that pun from the linked posts comments.
unpopularopinion,fekvm3k,t1_fekfj8q,1579208520.0,"10/10, would recommend."
dankmemes,fedcd5k,t1_fedbq6h,1579007449.0,"There’s not going to be a next according to Microsoft. Their plan is to continually update Windows 10. I’m not sure what you mean by “feels dirty”, but I’ve seen this in people who are unwilling to accept change as it comes along."
dankmemes,fedby63,t1_fedbmcw,1579007073.0,"I work in the IT field and use multiple OS’s, Windows 10 is fine."
dankmemes,fedbpzh,t1_fecydwa,1579006863.0,F
dankmemes,fedbp4c,t1_fed3mbj,1579006840.0,A firewall alone will not solve his issue. He can get Windows 10 for free and it’s more secure anyway. He should just do the upgrade if he can.
dankmemes,fedb1zt,t1_fed5263,1579006232.0,Sounds like preference to me.
dankmemes,fedaz4v,t1_fed41pn,1579006157.0,It legitimately is not heavier. And animations can be adjusted in the settings.
dankmemes,fedau59,t1_fecxk5z,1579006027.0,"Windows 10 is better in almost every way, but the people in this thread are butthurt because they might have a recommended app in their start menu."
worldnews,fecdcfl,t1_fecahlu,1578971246.0,"This is rich. You’re going around generalizing an entire country of people just because they might be here in this thread, and I’m the dweeb? You’re obviously salty for some reason. I actually have a favorable opinion of Koreans despite my encounter with you."
worldnews,feca6gl,t1_fec9zwe,1578969423.0,I’m critical when the information warrants it. You just assumed that guy was American simply to be a condescending asshole and now you’re trying to sell yourself as not biased. Talk about being a hypocrite.
worldnews,fec6xr4,t1_fec3bsd,1578967697.0,"Are you just assuming he’s American so you can be condescending?

Edit: You’re Korean. How  ironic."
worldnews,fdm42gg,t1_fdlzt3k,1578539303.0,"Never fails, always the whataboutism back to the US whenever some country does something wrong, like what the US used to do somehow absolves their actions."
politics,fdjwljt,t1_fdjsvae,1578489842.0,"I have no idea what I'm talking about? You know this information is included in the reports, right? I said ""even if they did"" just to show you how absurdly dumb your comment was. I wasn't going to respond to any comments on this post, but yours was so pulled so far out of your ass I felt compelled, so congratulations.

Also, do you know the effort it would require to track every single person on a bases of these sizes? That would be a feat the U.S. would struggle to accomplish. And then to position your munitions in such a way to not hit them in real time? Your comment was complete bullshit, bud."
politics,fdjct0i,t1_fdj9gda,1578465582.0,"Nope, that came before Nick Cannon's diss tracks. That's what prompted the whole thing."
politics,fdj15vz,t1_fdiz0em,1578455798.0,"Dumb comment. They had no idea they weren't going to kill anyone. They did not not fire guided weapons and even if they did, they more than likely had no intelligence on troop locations inside the base. Iran got lucky, plain and simple because the outcome of this could have ended poorly for them."
interestingasfuck,fdiimeq,t1_fdihyw1,1578443749.0,"Yeah, you can dig up bad shit from any countries history."
assholedesign,fdiewyt,t1_fdia0aa,1578441352.0,"Yeah, if that's the case then there's definitely a disconnect between what the app offers and what the store offers. I still don't think that means we should bring people back so much as they need to improve the app."
assholedesign,fdi7kts,t1_fdi77ce,1578437153.0,"Sounds like something unofficial your KFC is specifically doing. If this was a thing being done everywhere in Australia, they would have just added it to the app."
assholedesign,fdh8tuu,t1_fdgnyxt,1578417882.0,The picture is misleading. The kiosks show you what's on the menu.
assholedesign,fdh2n2t,t1_fdgn30x,1578414054.0,They do. I've been to these before and there's usually someone in the lobby to assist with the ordering for the handicapped.
assholedesign,fdh2j1z,t1_fdgnbvc,1578413984.0,"I've watched an older lady in Kansas walk into a McDonald's with these kiosks just completely confused. She walked up to the kiosk, took one look at it and got immediately frustrated and left. No effort on her part to even attempt to use it. On the other hand, that was the best ordering experience I've ever had at McDonald's."
assholedesign,fdh1l0l,t1_fdgnwz6,1578413391.0,99% of people don't use secret menus anyway. Small loss for a faster and more accurate automated system.
assholedesign,fdh1964,t1_fdgnykj,1578413185.0,Humans are inefficient and unreliable. That's all there is to it. More so in the fast food industry where people are getting paid minimum wage.
pussypassdenied,fdeor5r,t1_fdegt2o,1578343474.0,"Fair enough. She wasn't doing Jedi force stuff though, that's all I'm saying."
pussypassdenied,fdegonz,t1_fdefw3h,1578338631.0,"Okay? But the person you were replying to was not referring to the original trilogy. If you weren't addressing that, I'm not sure what context your statement was trying to make, if not trying to justify Leia's magically new found powers in the latest trilogy."
pussypassdenied,fdeetys,t1_fde6jnp,1578337480.0,"I've never heard anyone complain about Rey's character outside of the fact that she got too powerful too fast. Other than that, people were fine with it. Rose is a completely different story because her character was written like shit to point where it appeared that she has no purpose in the movie but to provide diversity."
pussypassdenied,fdeei8b,t1_fddwkln,1578337277.0,"I can see where you're coming from with Sarah Conner... But that Leia stuff is way off base. They just shoehorned her powers into the last trilogy when she never had them before. Not saying it wasn't possible, but they tried waaaayy to hard to sell that. Hence why people hate the Mary Poppins scene from TLJ."
starterpacks,fcv48kk,t1_fcurucj,1577994321.0,"Lowest rated by critics. Look at the viewer ratings, it's actually rated quite favorably. Also, these are the same critics that rated TLJ highly, and we all know how bad that movie was."
starterpacks,fcuimjd,t1_fcuefrr,1577981839.0,"No, the critic ratings were lower, but the viewer ratings were actually higher. The lesson here is that critic ratings are garbage. The critics also rated TLJ highly and we all know that movie was not even in the very least enjoyable."
starterpacks,fctoibr,t1_fctkcvh,1577951550.0,"Most people did. The viewer ratings are very positive.

Edit: Fucking downvoted for a hard fact. Never change, reddit."
starterpacks,fctohk6,t1_fctjrj6,1577951521.0,"Based on the viewer ratings, most people didn’t even consider it disappointing."
starterpacks,fctoelt,t1_fctm1o4,1577951409.0,"Considering that the critics ratings were completely off base from the viewer ratings, I would say yes."
starterpacks,fcto3ez,t1_fctlpop,1577950991.0,"Based on the **viewer** ratings, I'd say that's the popular opinion.   There seems to be a vocal minority that wants to push the narrative otherwise, but the viewer ratings don't lie."
gwent,fcajsga,t1_fc7l5mu,1577570554.0,"Because the no one new can play the seasonal mode. I'm not even suggesting changing the cards, but make some adjustments to the mode so anyone can actually play. Add a card banning mechanism or **something**. The way it is now shows either no concern or creativity from the developers."
gwent,fc4rco1,t1_fc3dc0l,1577425595.0,"Do the developers feel this is acceptable, or do they just not care? I just got into the game and I have to admit it almost makes me want to quit already."
freefolk,fbep433,t1_fbengwh,1576790662.0,"And her lines after that were just so cringe worthy, it just compounded how bad that scene actually was."
