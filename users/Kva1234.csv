I closed my Facebook account 1.5 years ago, and didn't download any of my information. Since I'm planning to start a business I try opening a Facebook account (a different one from the one I had). I began using one of those 10 minute emails rather than my personal, also I used a different phone number, and name. After setting up the account, I went to the privacy settings and I turned off everything nor I allowed access to my contacts. After, I check my feed. To my surprise, on the suggestions section, there it was everyone who was my friend on my previous Facebook account. Even people from work. It honestly scared the shit out of me, and I closed the account."

We all have our pace, take your time and follow what you love. Don't let anyone take away what you love doing because that is what dying is imo. You can tell your mom to stick it, and your dad sounds like he is misinformed about depression, perhaps you want to take him to your psychiatrist so he/she can explain to him what depression is. It worked with my mother (dad left when I was a child). I would like to become your friend if you'd like. Once again, happy birthday Supergirl. Keep being awesome."

depression,fcz4kwb,t1_fcz3njg,1578093543.0,"There is something called  false happiness. Being ignorant about a fact can make you feel happy momentarily, but if your told that fact and then go unhappy. I'm afraid it wasn't real happiness. Real happiness has a sense of peace with yourself, the good and the bad, and lasts longer. Once you reach true happiness no one can influence your moods or ruin your day. However, real happiness is not forever, that is why we need to do things that stimulate our brains and make us happy again. For example, if I wanted a Ferrari and get to buy one. What comes after that? I already got what I wanted, what now? The answer to happiness is stimulus, the journey, not the destination. I'm always honest with people, and I appreciate honesty. The fact that you want to shut someone just because it might make OP feel bad is not good, the truth is not always pleasant but at least they're not lying. Instead of wanting to change who gets a say or not, why not saying thank you and moving on?  In my job almost no one likes me because I'm honest, but they can't say I'm a liar. For me that's a win."
depression,fcz2mc7,t1_fcz2027,1578092406.0,"He's not being a dick. I'm happy that OP is doing well, but I'm not denying the truth. Depression is about an imbalance in the chemicals of the brain. Doing things that make you happy help your brain transmit this chemicals better and make you feel better. However, if you stop doing them, depression might come back. I'm my case, it comes back when I'm not doing anything (I hate having free time). But when I workout I feel better. I hope for OP it never comes back. Best wishes."

The UK and Scotland wanting to leave the UK and continue being part of the Eurozone. Printing of notes increases inflation, which can be bad for businesses and companies but not for individuals in some part. See, for people who have a loan, inflation is good because they have to pay less money. However, it can also be bad due to price stickiness. Which is going to cause people to start saving up, and spending will decrease. Purchasing power will decrease (because of inflation) which is bad. I would say, trade only when you see an opportunity, not when you have established a sentiment. Keep an eye on the pair, and see how important events affect the currency. Also, understand why it happened that way. A short course on economics shall give you the basic knowledge to analyze political events around the world."

For the dandruff, find a medicated shampoo that contains ketoderm, it's going to get rid of the dandruff and remove any bacteria that may be causing it. I personally use it, it works. Having oily skin is normal when you workout, just shower after a workout session so you don't have any dandruff or sweat stuck to your skin. For psoriasis, please talk to your doctor so he can prescribe a treatment. It could only be that you're deficient in vitamin D, or that a bug bit you. Check your bed for bed bugs, and make sure you rotate the mattress every 6 months. The reason I'm telling you this is because most of the things you mentioned have a fix, of course depression and anxiety are shit but I have them also. The things you mentioned apart from depression and anxiety, in my opinion wouldn't be a reason for me not to date you. I would actually get you to the doctor and help you get through them.
