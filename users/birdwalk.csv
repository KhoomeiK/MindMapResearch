saltierthancrait,femrv0l,t1_femlsoa,1579267818.0,">I think Daisy Ridley does about as well as she could with such a bland, flawless Mary Sue but she is totally forgettable and really irritating

I haven't seen Ridley in anything else, so I don't have any concept of her range. However, I feel she could have done more with Rey, despite her being so poorly written. 

Rey was so one note. Always uber serious, never vulnerable, never jocular, never relatable. 

I wonder if, even within the confines of the script, Ridley could have injected more personality into her role, interpreted the dialogue a bit differently.  I wonder if another actress could have given us a more likeable main character."
saltierthancrait,femrdgf,t1_femn1wz,1579267408.0,"Same. Changes in appearance are a symbolic way to show character growth. 

Luke started out in an outfit similar to Rey's -- desert clothes, dirty, suitable for moisture farming. By the end of the OT, he was wearing a sleek black outfit with a mandarin collar that was better suited for combat. 

He went from naive, impatient farmboy to confident, centered Jedi, and his costume changes reflected that. 

Rey basically wears the same scavenger outfit -- with minor variations -- throughout the trilogy. Kylo Ren probably has the most significamt outfit changes. Trying to think if anyone else did. 

Really baffling."
