worldnews,fcldfm3,t1_fclb73a,1577745238.0,"> I did not twist your words, you're just shitty at communicating and woefully pedantic. 

Let‚Äôs see how you do...

>You suggest they are the same when you blatantly state that if someone is in favor of reducing immigration restrictions, they must also support reducing restrictions on entering their home or else they are a hypocrite. 

Correct so far...

>Entering a country and entering a home are not the same, and conceding as much concedes your whole point, that anyone who supports open borders but locks their doors is a hypocrite. 

Boom, there you go. Apparently you are unable to comprehend the difference between entering a house legally with the owners permission, and breaking and entering a house without the owners permission.  I said that those who oppose border restrictions should leave their doors unlocked and welcome anyone in their house, which you continually referred to as breaking and entering.  

Illegally breaking into someone‚Äôs house, who‚Äôs doors are locked, is comparable to entering the country illegally.

> Conservatives can cry all day about being called names; if you're being a moron, I will call you one and that does not make you a winner. Be smarter if you don't want to be ridiculed.

Name calling is a predictable Liberal response in a debate with a conservative. It doesn‚Äôt hurt my feelings at all, so it all you want, but it‚Äôs severely weakens your defense and your point. It makes you look like you no longer have anything valid to offer and so you resort to name calling like children do."
worldnews,fcl3ed4,t1_fcl2ou5,1577738941.0,"They are not the same thing, I never said they were the same thing, and I specifically said someone entering the house would do so with the owners permission and the door unlocked. That is not breaking nor is it illegal entry.

You are twisting my words in a dishonest way because you no longer have any defense. And, like all liberals, when you run out of arguments you result to name-calling.

I don‚Äôt understand the twin bed reference, but even though it is irrelevant to this discussion I am an atheist conservative."
worldnews,fckxi95,t1_fckuyis,1577735309.0,"I oppose illegally entering a country or a house. 

My point is those who are not opposed to border restrictions shouldn‚Äôt offer restrictions on their homes too. It‚Äôs not B and E if the doors aren‚Äôt locked and the homeowner welcomes all into his home like he welcomes all into his country. 

That‚Äôs where the hypocrisy shows up, when open borders are okay but open doors are not.   Also when you suggest immigrants can ignore some laws if they don‚Äôt like them but be held to following other laws regardless."
worldnews,fckrjpi,t1_fckpapc,1577731647.0,"True. Nor would the child be sent back home alone, or allowed to roam the streets alone. They‚Äôd be taken somewhere and kept safe. Probably in a foster home, or some other group home.

worldnews,fckoxf1,t1_fckhorq,1577730033.0,"In neither election were the presidents selected on total national votes.  Having a majority of the votes cast is irrelevant.

I am only suggesting that the immigration laws are good or bad based on what the majority of the country wants. There are other laws that are, and have been, bad."
worldnews,fckokdk,t1_fckhvdc,1577729813.0,"Now I know there‚Äôs no point in debating you because you change your claims when proven wrong.

Your original claim was that most Americans voted for Hillary and Al Gore. In 2016 the United States population was 323.4 million people.  Half of that is 161.7 million people.  According to your own statistics both candidates combined did not get that many votes. I can see why you keep claiming that math is hard for you, and I believe you.

However, because this country does not use a popular vote election, total votes are completely meaningless in elections.  The fact that Hillary got more total votes than Trump is completely irrelevant. He got more votes in the states who‚Äôs Electoral votes added up to more than hers.  That is how presidential elections work. 

This is another case where you think that the law doesn‚Äôt reflect what you want and therefore should be ignored. You want the president to have been selected on a system that doesn‚Äôt exist and claim that it somehow was wrong, even though it‚Äôs the same system that elected every other president so far. 

Speaking of changing the goal posts, I was not talking about German laws. I am only discussing the immigration laws (both the laws against entering the country at will, and the laws regarding the kids). If the majority of the country wants to change the law, it will be changed because it no longer reflects what the country wants. That is what I meant by a ‚Äúbad law‚Äù.  If the majority of the country wishes to allow immigrants into the country without vetting, or anything the current laws prevent, then they will vote to change those laws and foreign people may enter the country at will. However, if this is a good law that does reflect the will of the American people overall, then it will remain.

The lag time doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it is either a good law that should remain or a bad law that should change, according to the people. I‚Äôm not speaking on how quickly laws should or should not be changed, only that ignoring them is not the way to disagree with a law that is in place. It is also why I maintain that people who wish for immigrants to ignore immigration laws should also be willing to leave their house unlocked and not complain if something gets stolen or if someone is inside their house.  If they don‚Äôt do this, they are hypocrites.

If people are not being allowed to vote then that is wrong, I agree with you. The law states that people should be allowed to vote in most cases, correct? It‚Äôs ironic that you are suggesting that other people who may be disagreeing with this law should not be ignoring it and breaking the law to suit their own wishes. This makes you a hypocrite.

As I understand it, the illegal immigrants are free to return to their own country with their children if they wish. They are waiting to be allowed to remain in this country with their children.  In the meantime, they have broken the immigration laws and are being detained. This is no different than any other lawbreaker, such as a bank robber, who has children with him. The children would not be allowed to remain with them in prison."

What would you prefer the country do with the children of the lawbreakers that are entering the country illegally? Should the children be sent back to their country without their parents? Should the children be allowed into the country without their parents? Or should the children be cared for in custody centers where they are fed, clothed, and kept healthy? You call it punishment, I call it the best alternative in a situation that the horrible parents put them in."

> The people of the United States were in favor of Al Gore and Hilary winning the presidency but that didn't happen either.

So not only do you not understand how immigration laws work, you also don‚Äôt understand how presidential elections work. Are you suggesting that the majority of Americans voted for a law to make Al Gore and Hillary president? Or, are you trying to suggest that the majority of Americans ever wanted those two to be president? Spoiler: there are no facts to support this."

Just because I support the law against people entering the country illegally does not mean I also support every other law that does exist, or has existed. 

Slavery was a bad law, it got changed, that was a good thing.

Nor am I suggesting that a bad law that cannot be changed is always a good law, just that this particular law against illegal entry is a good law if it cannot be changed. My point was, if the people of the United States are in favor of people from outside the United States coming in without being vetted then the law will get changed. If the people of this country for the most part agree with the law, then it will not be changed.

I, for one, agree with the law. There are legal ways to enter the country if you are not a citizen, if you choose to enter another way then you are breaking the law.

And if I support a law that later gets changed, how do you go from me being wrong, to me being a domestic terrorist? Talk about faulty logic!"

Hey Liberals, if you don‚Äôt like the laws you can‚Äôt just allow people to break them, change the damn laws! That‚Äôs possible to do. There‚Äôs provisions in the legal system for just that.
