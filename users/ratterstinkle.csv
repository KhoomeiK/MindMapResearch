I read a book a while back titled God is Disappointed in You, which gave a more comedic spin to it. There’s another one called Bible Stories Your Parents Never Told You that talks about the same stuff.   

But I think the biggest paradigm shift that I went through was after taking a course in the history of Christianity in college. I was amazed at the evolution of the texts that are used (or excluded) today. 

The wording, syntax, and messages changed enough that it made me realize that none of it can be believed. The funny part is that devotees don’t care. 

I gave up on arguing with people about the absurdity of religion a long time ago. It’s fighting for the sake of fighting. I realized that I was never going to convince anyone, so it was a waste of my time, effort, and emotion.
