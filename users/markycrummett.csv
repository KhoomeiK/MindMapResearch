u_Superfy_app,fes19dk,t3_eq53rn,1579360397.0,I can’t fathom it being 2020 and continuously getting an ad where someone’s invented google but worse and thought it was a solid business idea
aww,feq24n1,t1_fepyfuc,1579336416.0,"Haha, mine is learning that slowly I think. If I get up for the loo after 6am though then he assumes it’s food time. By 7am he starts contemplating tapping me on the face 😄"
aww,feps97q,t1_feppu1d,1579329530.0,"My 9 month old cat is currently sitting, looking up at me while I’m sat at on the loo because I left the bedroom where he was sleeping at my feet. I’d never had a cat or dog till we got him and its surprised me. Far from uncaring, he greets me at the door when I get home, he sleeps on me, he sits on the edge of the bath if I have a bath, he sleeps on my bed, he follows me round my home. He also seems to rotate between myself and my fiancé as to who he is most affectionate with."
britishproblems,feok25r,t3_epx3wp,1579301270.0,This and Miranda. Can not for the life of me work out what about those shows makes anyone laugh. Seems to be older people. It’s so over the top and obvious and just Eugh

AskReddit,fe18dcz,t1_fe0w774,1578823704.0,"I hear this kind of stuff a lot and it amazes me. I’ve got IBS so I can go from nothing at all to “I need a loo NOW or I’ll shit myself” in a matter of minutes sometimes. The idea of holding it in for days is baffling! 

If I had a girl over I used to use excuses to rush out for a shit if I was having troubles. I’m sure after the 4th trip to get another drink they must have worked it out. That or the distant flush of the loo the other side of the house each time.  4/5 years with my now fiancé and it’s a lot easier.  “I need to shit”, sorted"

nextfuckinglevel,fdc3hnb,t1_fdc25gr,1578266371.0,That would make some level of sense. Although don’t lucid dreams usually occur during REM?
nextfuckinglevel,fdbnnyr,t1_fdbjvgu,1578259203.0,I think jet lag is mostly down to misaligned body clock and new time zone. But it probably doesn’t help sleeping in a new place.

AskReddit,fcmnvtg,t1_fcl3d97,1577783496.0,Haven’t spoken to my sister for nearly 10 years. Get nudged by family to do so but to me it makes no sense to awkwardly add back someone to my life who adds no value
television,fc7y5nc,t3_eghdau,1577521758.0,I usually find “critics” look to have some deep meaningful point in shows so their reviews can sound “impressive”. Meanwhile audiences mostly want something that’s entertaining to watch.  Reviewers could do with remembering their reviews aren’t school English essays
relationship_advice,fc52nsw,t3_eg3q65,1577439965.0,My fiancé’s family are the complete opposite. They appreciate everything and in a really heartfelt way. You could give one of them an old pen you’d found and wrapped up and they’d still appreciate the effort!
