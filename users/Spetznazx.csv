Browns,ff7wwa2,t1_ff7urw4,1579660286.0,"To me he was like a what if a browns fan who had some football knowledge became the head coach.  He said the right things, but it felt like he was trying too hard to support the team at times (such as wearing that shirt after the Myles Garrett incident) and I feel like this truly bled into a lack of discipline.  He's a good guy but came off as a a buddy coach which doesn't really work in the NFL."

movies,ff5skbb,t1_ff4q17l,1579608633.0,"For every reply that says it's garbage, I'm gonna go against that and double the recommendation.  We need more sci fi horror and the atmosphere and monsters in Underwater were great.  The suits they wear fit perfectly thematically and I thought the acting was pretty good, not stellar but good.  The characters really don't make any dumb mistakes and the movie doesn't feel like it wastes time, honestly my only big complaint was I wish it was longer."

Browns,fe95ijq,t1_fe93x9g,1578934439.0,"Because it's probably meetings based on the FO level, like asking how things are going with the coaching process, are there any hurdles, anything we can do to make it easier on you, any assistants or coaches or players you're having trouble with, etc. 

To me these meetings are clearly a way to see how Stefanski is handling the job on a personnel and planning level, after hearing how overwhelmed Freddie was Jimmy probably wants to get ahead of that problem before it ever arrives, so if Stefanski is having issues somewhere this is the meeting to discuss it at."

Browns,fdzz2ft,t1_fdzwbsk,1578799243.0,"That was a good pass that should have never been attempted.

It was triple coverage and the receiver had to make a spectacular catch and take a solid hit for it to be a good play."
Browns,fdzyzo0,t1_fdzw6o9,1578799191.0,"And here's what I'll say to that; scheming, Greg Roman is a fantastic OC, most of the time Lamar's targets were wide open otherwise he didn't throw them. He cannot consistently make the tight window pass. There's a reason he only had 3000 passing yds, he took easy throws and didn't take risks."
Browns,fdzud3b,t1_fdzrrna,1578796004.0,"Lamar is facing the same problems Vick had. Lamar and Vick both had strong arms and we're amazing runners, but they're both not very accurate.

They're regular season gimmicks"
Browns,fdzq5jx,t1_fdznfyc,1578793239.0,"This is false, Freddie was not hired for culture or staff he was hired because the offense had played apparently really well under him and that they didn't want to stunt Baker's growth"
