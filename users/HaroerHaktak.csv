But you should teach your children to shuffle the cards before play. Because, at least when I pack up, all the cards in the current pile are usually put on top or bottom so it puts all the ""good"" cards together and in order. (blues with blues and reds with reds)

Also. Do you just play 1 game of uno? nobody plays just 1 hand. And do you not shuffle after each game? have I been playing wrong?"

So I was hanging out with a friend at my local creek almost 15 years ago when we started doing stuff we shouldn't, after a few minutes, we hear a noise and noticed someone spotted us. We quickly got onto our bikes and rode as fast as we could down the creek.

I saw the foot bridge to go across the creek (it wasn't even tall enough to be counted as a bridge tbh). Without slowing down I did a hard 90 degree turn, front wheel hits the bridge, I'm still going my original direction. Bikes on the bridge, nice and calm and happy looking and I'm about 5 meters away in the rocks. There was no water or mud to pad my fall. I sorta broke my ankle? I needed stitches and couldn't really walk.

So yeah.

TL:DR - Rode down creek, did a cartoon fly through air. Landed on rocks, cracked ankle open. yay"
