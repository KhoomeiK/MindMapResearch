ElectricSkateboarding,fenrzt9,t1_fenqnoz,1579289944.0,"Lololol kudos on the downhill, yeah you shouldn't run off but I didn't even commit to the run. Honestly wasn't completely focused.

I criticised this behavior before but now realise it happens to everyone. So ride very hard or very soft, the in between can be dangerous when you get used to speed."
ElectricSkateboarding,fenetn7,t1_fendj7a,1579283158.0,"Yeah dude rebound, cracked floor and survival reactions.

After you whip right you have to oppose the force on the left, the cracked floor and incomplete concentration made my body step of the board.

The lesson here is commitment and speed has to be proportional. If My knees were bent right and I was focused this never would have happened.

When your major concern is in cleaning yourself off and not the hospital you know you did things right."

ElectricSkateboarding,fe6tdir,t1_fe6k530,1578904546.0,"But that's silly, you should get the cheapest one! Imagine he can't afford the 7 but gets a six, he would get nothing more from it than from a five! Or perhaps four.

Man.... Go see reviews or read or or

Get the seven or don't get one at all and save

(Or 8 but I guess that's implied and it should be even more expensive)"
ElectricSkateboarding,fe6jbip,t1_fe6drts,1578892741.0,"Nope, IMO never get one below 7 

The stabilization of the 7 and the ones after that are in another level.

Really you can just skate around and the footage will be fine, with the ones before it was always shaky.

And the image quality doesn't differ much from the go pro one!

But the milk smooth stabilization Jesus it's just the best. The difference between the 6 and 7 is that they added a feature called hyper smooth and it's not gimmicks at all it works wonders."
ElectricSkateboarding,fe6i52y,t1_fdroxno,1578891634.0,"That's awesome, cause I know some people really like the display.

This comment is by no means an attack on the poster.

For all I know it would be cool to ride with the guy, and the first thing I would say after ""hey whats up"" is I fucking hate that helmet! 

Hope I've been enlightening"
ElectricSkateboarding,fdzthzm,t1_fdz9r5m,1578795428.0,"Dudes here is the thing, I saw that helmet on previous eskate vids. Like the previous coments said style is subjective.

And in my opinion style wise is, I fucking hate that helmet, don't get me wrong it might be great. 

I didn't down vote those who really liked it, so maybe you shouldn't down vote me? Just a thought"

 Then you put gigantic wheels on it... My question is won't it affect the ride negatively, cause if you want to cruise and a comfortable stable ride the exway isn't your board. 

 If you went with this option. You should look at switching board if you want a mellow ride, something with a bit of flex and pneumatics perhaps."

Remember that weight gain, unless you have a super shitty diet, is mainly an hormonal issue.

But more important than that, don't get a boosted."
ElectricSkateboarding,fbx7jqr,t3_eexuyo,1577172861.0,"Man do yourself a favor and get that system with belt drive. It's so much smoother! 

Minis don't really have the flex to absorb vibrations and the real wheels muah! They make the difference.

Other than that cool setup!"
ElectricSkateboarding,fbx7ck0,t1_fbvxk78,1577172597.0,"I DARE! LOL cause I own one.
It's a super fun super nimble board. People get the boosted mini and don't realize it has double the weight and isn't nearly has nimble has the Faboard.

I known that the board has issues but it still pulls off what it tried to accomplish. Once you get used to the breaking, it's better than allot of minis out there especially the ones with hubs.

I still would advise people to get a Faboard dual belt and spend the money they saved on an extra battery."
ElectricSkateboarding,fbvfzp4,t1_fbuujiw,1577130256.0,Riptide and Faboard. But know that small boards and bumpy terrain are not two things that go well together
