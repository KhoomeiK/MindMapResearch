YangForPresidentHQ,ffbtw8l,t1_ffa5z2g,1579782579.0,"Policy-wise though you're more likely to get ideas such as UBI accepted by Dem candidates, many who have already praised Yang for bring the idea into conversation, while most of the core Republicans are still of the thought that any of these so called ""human centered capitalism"" programs are just handouts. 

Essentially all the primary Dem candidates have criticized big Tech, with Sanders and Warren especially talking about breaking down big tech corporations and adding regulations to aid the safety of our data.

Trump may have vaguely talked about it, but while he has been president, he has done nothing about it. What makes you think he will care about it on his second term? I doubt it's much of a priority to him. 

Trump is anti-immigration and supports a more nationalist vision, I'll give you that. If that's what you mainly support, then it makes sense. I guess it just seems a little strange for me that you'd jump straight from supporting human-centered capitalism and a son of immigrants to an anti-humanism and anti-immigration candidate. Trump being made of the corporate world, will always chose the corporate world and the profit line over humans like you and me."
YangForPresidentHQ,ffa3ttg,t1_ff9r61c,1579727338.0,"Why? Yang himself said he would support whoever the Dem nominee is, and he's views and goals align much more with Democrats than republicans. 

Why on earth would you vote for Trump, if you support Yang? 

Yang says to focus on the IDEAS and not the people. If you're voting for Yang because of his personality, you're voting for the wrong reasons and you've misunderstood his message. 

Trump is the antithesis of everything Yang stands for."

quityourbullshit,fehbiev,t1_feh9hjc,1579113149.0,"Generally when speaking of gender dysphoria, you can categorize it into three categories, which is social, cognitive and physical. 

I reckon that because we live in a very gendered society, those trans individuals who mainly suffer from social dysphoria, would be a whole lot less likely to transition if we lived in a less-gendered society. 

But when it comes to cognitive and physical dysphoria, both of which I have, I still think the cause behind the dysphoria would be there. Unless of course we evolve to be some gender-neutral species entirely, but seems unlikely. 

On one hand I don't think it's not much use for me personally to theorize about how trans people's existence would be in a more gender-neutral society, as that is not the one we live in, or have lived in throughout our evolution."

I realized I had gender dysphoria at age 4-5, but had no idea what it meant till I got tired of feeling confused and decided to Google my symptoms when I was 11, it was only because of access to internet that I realized I wasn't alone in this, that others shared this condition and that there was actually something to be done about it.

I invited him to live in a spare room that I had, he didn't have much money so I didn't ask for rent, he ate food I bought and I didn't mind. We talked a lot in the evenings, he'd tell me how his big goal would be to get a manager position at a construction site or start his own-home construction company, do home-repairs and that kind of stuff. He was good with his hands so it seemed like a good dream to have. On the other hand he started making more friends with dealers, and other very underground criminals, before I knew it he'd show up quite tipsy/high at my place and reveal he was just hanging out with a known murderer.

He got into school to get a degree in construction management, as he had applied before.

Nah, he was stubborn. It was summer and he wanted to smoke weed with his friends instead.

The way I saw it, this was his big break. The way to get out of this miserable path would have been to stay in school. But what happened next is he started drifting more into these underground circles. I moved cities myself, during the move he stole like 100 bucks from me. A few months later, I heard he was in prison for blowing up an ATM with some other guys.

AskReddit,fed3bq9,t1_febzand,1578996703.0,"They are both right and wrong depending on the context actually. A trans-woman increases her chances of developing breast cancer and cancers more common in women etc. if she transitions, while a trans-man (such as myself) has increased my chances of developing illnesses that are more common among men, such as heart disease, because of the effects of testosterone. I won't ever have to worry about prostate cancer, but the hormone levels do change the type of medical threats we become more exposed to, and align them more with the gender we're transitioning to. Also due to biological differences caused by hormone intake, you can't assume the same health-needs for a 45+ year old trans-man and a 45+ woman, because a trans-man who doesn't have much breast-tissue anymore or a lot of estrogen, is unlikely to develop breast cancer, and doesn't have to concern himself with the effects of menopause because of the supplemented testosterone, also won't suffer as much from loss of bone-density which is what happens to older women.

An intelligent mind can have faith, because as you said, faith is a strong intuition based on very prominent feelings, while still be assured that they will follow empirical and measurable evidence to where it leads.

You mentioned that having faith is similar to having a mental illness (in your view) but what makes you think that someone who suffers from mental illness can't simultaneously be an extremely intelligent person? There have been genius-level mathematicians who have had schizophrenia (like John Nash), a lot of people with high creative intelligence have perception wrapping disorders like bipolar, depression, aspergers etc. 

In fact some forms of mental illness and intelligence often go hand in hand. Because your inner-psychological workings, aren't necessarily tied to your ability to form patterns of the world around  you and draw conclusions.

You said that a brilliant mind doesn't ""need"" faith, but what if a brilliant mind would want faith? An individual can find value in having faith in something bigger than themselves, while still understanding the material limitations of this world we reside in, and wishing to study it as such?

Faith is a difficult thing for many to understand, and I used to be a pretty hardcore atheist that would look down upon anyone that held faith into something, but I've come to understand it more as a powerful motivator and experience of the human condition.

Also, as a fellow traveler myself, I've run into TONS of young women that are traveling all over the world by themselves or with each other, about 99% of them end up fine, maybe robbed once or twice, one I knew got beaten up and hospitalized for a couple of days but wound up fine overall. I've met more male travelers that have been targeted for robbing/beatings than women. There is danger out there, but most people are more capable of surviving and the world is not as scary as we make it out to be. However, we only hear about that 1% in the news, that had something horrible happen to them. People in other countries are not hostile just because they are foreign, most people have a sense of humanity, curiosity and kindness towards other humans. 

My friend found that the vast majority of strangers she came across wanted to help her, rather than hurt her. It really opens your eyes to see that the world isn't filled with as many horrible people as the news makes you think. You say ""she's lucky to make it home"" as if the default would have been that she would have been kidnapped or killed, when in reality, the odds are that she most likely would be fine, and there is a 1% chance of her being kidnapped/killed out there."

There's a lot of wild terrain there and mainly just fields, mountains, deserts, and deep-wild jungle woods scattered around. You can get lost between Northern China and Mongolia for ages, because it's a massive area.

>And the villagers make no mention of a foreigner to the local  authorities to maybe try and help her out as she very obviously wouldn't  look like she belonged there?

You've clearly never been to China or visited any of these small villages. These villagers love travelers coming in because they find it super fascinating that anyone would go out of their way to travel to be a part of their small lives, it was actually a lot harder for her to leave because they kept wanting her to stay longer.

I've actually spend some years living in China myself (though under very different circumstances and in a entirely different region, as I lived in Shanghai which is southern China) and part of her interest going to China was due to my stories of living there. This is literally just how Chinese people in the poorer regions are, they rarely get tourists or visitors, so when they have one around, they are super excited and curious and try to be helpful. Only thing is you're going to get all the kids and grannies in the whole region coming by to stare at you.

>Living off bugs like it was survivable?

This is a tiny part of her trip. When she crossed over a guarded area to camp in a jungle, that was closed off to any visitors, she wounded up setting a tent in deep in that terrain. There was in fact a tiny village about a 2-hour walk away, but she developed a fever and got sick for a couple of days and couldn't make the journey out safely to get food. She resorted to eating the same bugs and worms that some of the locals ate for like a day or two, before she recovered well enough to move her camp off. She didn't literally live off bugs for months.

>And the American woman just randomly saves the day, gives her a job and life gets better from then on? Really?

Yeah. This is pretty much what happened, I'm not an American myself (I'm Finnish) and neither is she, so I nor her have really no reason to make up a mysterious American savior out of the blue. She noticed the American woman as she was one of the only white people she saw in a tiny town bar in the middle of nowhere, and they got to talking straight away, upon which my friend found out that the American has been living as an expat in China for almost half a decade, and had come to that region to start building a hostel/resort in the fields located pretty much in nowhere. My friend expressed being interested in some work, so before she knew it, she was hired.

Her entire trip lasted 4 months in total, and 2 of those months were spend working for the American at the hostel/resort. She then went on to take a bus to the nearest real city, and got an actual flight back to Finland.

Like I said, there's no reason that you have to buy this story if it's that unbelievable to you. But as someone who has traveled a lot, this is not at all out of reach. A lot of of things happen in the world when you leave your home/safety bubble and venture off into the unknown."
AmItheAsshole,fduma20,t1_fdsfn36,1578735205.0,"They had discussed it hypothetically before she was pregnant, but being pregnant in ""theory"" and actually being pregnant are two very different things. She shows here that she valued his opinion on his own child, and wanted him to feel included in the decision-making. 

He took this opportunity to accuse her of cheating, instead of trying to be supportive of the woman he loves. He didn't even wait till the baby was born or big enough to conduct a DNA test, he straight up just wanted to remove his responsibility from anything immediately. From OP's point of view, that's a bit red flag, because she would never be comfortable actually having children with someone like that if they decide on it later. 

Once you tell your partner that you think they're a cheater, it's really hard to build any trust in the relationship anymore."
AmItheAsshole,fdulmtx,t1_fdsdov0,1578734881.0,"From how OP puts it, she went to him and said she's pregnant and wanted to discuss having an abortion. He's first reaction before saying anything else was, that he wants a paternity test. Anyway that you look at it, that is him accusing OP of cheating on him, because they haven't even discussed rather she's keeping the child or not. He knew she was a virgin before him, and has only been with him, but his first thought to hearing that the woman he loves is carrying a child, is to try to remove his responsibility for it and claim she's lying to him? That's a red flag. 

The reasonable reaction for OP's boyfriend if he was supportive of her, should have been ""Ok, what are we gonna do now?"" and if they end up deciding to keep the child, then requesting a DNA test when the child is born, which is reasonable. 

If your first reaction to your girlfriend being pregnant is ""You probably cheated on me"" then there's something seriously wrong with how you view the relationship, and OP wanting to get out of that situation is totally valid."

Considering neither of them wanted the child, its in a sense irrelevant rather he is the biological father or not. It seems more like he took this opportunity accuse her of cheating, and wanted a DNA test even though they were not keeping the child. Having a DNA test after a child is born makes sense, but it should by no means be the first words out of your mouth if your girlfriend says she's pregnant. 

This is not about him wanting to be assured that he is the biological father, this is about him wanting his girlfriend to prove that she hasn't been cheating.

If he can come out looking like a winner for his main base, he'll be pretty satisfied, because he places a lot of value on his image. 

Based on his statements following the attack, he had a fairly positive tone to it. Saying ""all is good so far"" and seemed to be gesturing that no damage was done and therefore he's previous threats to retaliate might not apply. 

If Iran does proceed to make more attacks, or if some US lives are lost, I am pretty certain the administration would go on the attack and then we'd be looking at a likely war or some kind of cold-war type tension and killings for the coming decades.
