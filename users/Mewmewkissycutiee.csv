AskReddit,ffb13sh,t3_eskc2n,1579749188.0,"We initially started talking because of his Undertale royal crest shirt in his Tinder pic. He actually put effort into his description and didn’t try to be deceptive with his pics.

He takes very good care of his hygiene, sometimes showers twice a day even. He doesn’t ignore me for his games.

Also he is very good at reading and predicting people which I find interesting because I’m awful at that. Some cool, useful skill like that helps."
relationship_advice,ff91afj,t1_ff8zuu8,1579702334.0,"Alright, since he knows, that’s pretty annoying and I see why you’re mad. It sounds like he does care about you based on the added info, but he is the flirty type with some women. My ex was clueless to how flirty they were with people and it took both me and our mutual friend to point it out for them to ask themself “wait, am I?” And we were like “yeah, dummy! You totally were.” (We broke up for unrelated reasons)

I would ask him to be more self aware about the flirting thing. It will take time to change that though. Except I’m not sure if he is unaware about how that comes off or if he knows, maybe it was just alcohol if he was drinking? I know it can make people more confident.

Asking people to change sucks, it feels like a dick move, but I think in this case it’s justified."
relationship_advice,ff8iazr,t3_erzi1i,1579679769.0,"The one thing that gets me is he was looking at her while kissing you. I don’t see a lot of people talking about this, just the whole bar thing in general. Everything else was concerning too, especially him saying he’s attracted to short girls. Yeah, that would immediately put me on edge. I think saying that combined with him looking at her while kissing you is the biggest red flag of all.

Have you disclosed to your guy that you were cheated on? You don’t have to, but I think it would help explain to him better that you aren’t trying to make accusations, you just still have fears from your last experience."

I have an ex who made a bunch of online friends that were girls and it was a bit alarming and I was jealous at first, but they were just really nice girls once I got to know them. My ex made is upfront clear that we were in a relationship, I wasn’t there for the exact convo but they introduced me to their other friends as “exsusername’s gf”. They never did any international meeting though, we did all talk about it. Difference is, I was involved in that hypothetical vacation.

You should go with and try out being friends with her. Get to know her. See how they interact, if she is cold and closed off to you and warm or annoyed with him, then you at least know she is/was interested in your guy as something more.

Your guy might just be naive to girls hitting on him, I doubt he’d actually invite you if it were anything romantic or sexual in his mind. If he has a history of talking to girls with borderline intentions I’d be worried. If not then they’re likely just friends and he’s being too cheap to save up for a separate trip.

It sounds much more like he’s just trying to avoid having to plan another trip."
SanJose,feocvfj,t1_fennen9,1579298336.0,"Yes! It’s just not sustainable. Unless if we can force big companies to spread out, but that’s not going to happen.

So the best way to go is to redo everything to stop the urban sprawl issue that’s making traffic and housing prices bad. Make housing high density around better public transit and then that should solve a big part of the issue. 

Amending or repealing prop 13 is another big battle that requires its own separate attention. This is part of what’s allowing the NIMBYs to keep the battle up.

I am bay area born and raised in 1993, so I get how it’s sad to see your home change from how it was when you were a kid, but the need for nostalgia is hurting the younger generations and the economically disadvantaged. I know people mid 20’s that can’t move out of their parents house with full on degrees and careers, others like me who live in teeny 100-300 sq ft rooms because they cannot live at home.

Meanwhile the rich keep getting richer off of us millennials, and all we want is to have our own place like our parents were able to get by our age. But instead we are labeled “lazy”. It’s the boomer equivalent of “why are you hitting yourself?”"

I can see being irritated at missing out on  social stuff, but you have to weigh wether having a social life is really worth missing out on the job opportunity or not. If it’s the social aspect, I would just stick it out.

If it’s because you are bored at work or just a morning person, I would inquire about a day shift instead and express interest in a faster pace. That way if the next person leaves, they will ask you first hopefully. Depends on if your workplace operates on seniority. For now you can take advantage of the slow hours and sharpen some skills relevant to the job you are interested in moving up to."

I rented a room in a house next door to a family with some kids, I think 3-4 of them from 7-13yo, I lost track of the number of voices. They left for school at about 6:30am. How do I know? They would YELL “hurrrrry uuuuup were gonna be laaAatE!” to their siblings, maybe 3/5 days. I regularly started work at 2pm and got home at 11pm. My bedroom window faced their driveway, my window was above the 6’ fence, and their house was spaced maybe 10’-11’ from the one I was in. Don’t get me started on the backyard shrieking playtime...

I ran into the daughters once, they’re really not bad kids. Just being kids, unaware of how loud they are. Still annoying though.

I didn’t complain because their mom was a karen type who harassed me about buying the house several times so they could bulldoze it and make a big kitchen (it was a small house built on an old large alley).

It is overused on Reddit, but that’s just cause there are so many people on here, like, millions of them. You’re likely gonna see it quite a few times. That’s true. But there’s a lot of far more overused phrases (and jokes) people use on Reddit. I’m looking at you, “I also choose this guy’s dead wife”.

I can see it being obnoxious if used incorrectly. Lots of people use it for not so stupid cases, seems to be the “Im so badass, lol brutal honesty” crowd that uses it wrong for everything they deem stupid (which to them is almost everything) just to say it.

After CA taxes and healthcare my takehome is more like $17/hr. 

Read the job description carefully. If it says you will be on patrol, might not give you enough downtime. I started out standing post in front of doors and it was awful.

Keep in mind I have been working security since 2014 and started with $14/hr. It’s one of those fields where a lot of people came from police or military background so they have a hard on for doing your time/paying dues for whatever reason. It might take a couple years to get preferred hours.

First, financial aid covers most of my tuition. The catch is I have to be full time (12+units), which is fine, I’m trying to rush this bitch to finally be done with school.

Second, I work 40hr as security because it gives me enough to pay bills and rent, and have enough downtime at work for homework. Also my only option is to do 40hr since I don’t have the option to live at home, and am 26 (super senior!) so I can’t be on my dads healthcare for free anymore.

Started in public community college, got 3 associates degrees (only pursued 2, the third just happened to be available to me so I applied) and then transferred into a public CSU after... 6-7 years, when I finally figured out what I wanted to do to get my BS. My prog. is 4yr regardless of transfer/freshman, so here I am.

I rent a small room. I could probably live cheaper if I shared my room but I snore obnoxiously loud. And I am on a diet anyways so I only eat one meal a day, really cuts down on costs. I try to cook at home but I suck at cooking and don’t have a lot of energy or time to do that."

Thank digital jesus for the starbucks app where it prints your name on the label instead of having to have the poor cashier figure out the right spelling. I usually just say “with a K” and then I get asked “with an ‘e’?” So I changed it to “with a K, and the rest doesn’t matter lol” because... I actually spell it different from how the birth cert says.

I spell it Kathrine. When I was little, I insisted that it was spelt that way. “It’s NOT ‘kath-ah-rine-eee,’ it’s ’kath-a-rine!’” was my alleged famous line. I didn’t stop to think as a 3 or 4 year old, that taking the ‘e‘ out in the middle did not change the emphasis on the last letter. And it certainly doesn’t make the middle ‘e’ letter an ‘a’ sound. I wasn’t really a smart kid, but I digress.

At this point I’m not sure how to approach job apps and whatnot. I usually put my legal name and forget about correcting people if they goof on the spelling. I was thinking of changing my name, my mom wanted to name me either Dakota or Sierra. My grandparents didn’t think it was traditional enough and pressured my mom into picking a traditional, “proper” name. My mom said she was too hopped up on the delivery drugs to pick a spelling though, and my dad didn’t care about that stuff, so the nurse just put whatever spelling lol.

Honestly I think living biking distance to work and cooking almost exclusively at home (except for maybe that sweet bowl of pho on sick days) will easily put you on track to $20k/yr savings. If you also don’t go out and drink then even better, since most social activity in SJ is basically just going out and drinking or eating.

Plus you aren’t against renting with roommates. That puts you way ahead, some people refuse shared housing.

Best of luck, and welcome to SJ!"

ABoringDystopia,fdopbob,t1_fdon2sw,1578609861.0,"Not always.

I and a bunch of my relatives want to sell my late grandparents house that my great grandparents built instead of renting it, because that’s a lot of work none of us have the time for and liabilities that none of us have money for- but the trust outlines that we cannot sell and in short we cannot modify the trust. Only way to sell is if a specific person within our trust passes away.

It’s vacant until we can clean it up a bit and fix some old wiring that was tampered with, black mold, peeling floors from a methhead squatter who didn’t take care of it at all (obviously, since they were a methhead).

Not to say that’s the person above’s case, but things are often more complicated than they appear on the surface."

I would also seriously suggest marriage counseling if you can afford that right now. Not sure how much maternity leave pays.

I would inform him that you have been counting the time he spends on things, and straight up tell him that you feel he only took paternity leave as an excuse to get out of work since he isn’t helping with the kids like he is supposed to be. That’s what paternity leave is for, not playing diablo and dicking around with his car for 80% of the time. But I can also be sort of confrontational, and it totally depends on if he is the type to shut down when called out or do something about it, so take that advice with a grain of salt.

Regardless you need to straight up call him out on his lazy behavior. Be direct. He is not being the dad his kids deserve. I would be pissed and very concerned for my future as a mom if I were in your shoes."

college,fdhtmom,t3_elcmhp,1578429939.0,"I work 40 and go to school for 12-15 units (semester) with summers.

I am extremely lucky because I have a job (Security) where I have enough downtime that I can get all my homework done in the 8 hours. We probably do a max of two hours of work. I can afford to live walking distance to school which makes it so I don’t have to pay gas, $600/year parking permit where I probs wouldn’t find parking anyways, and I can get some exercise in.

Downsides are that I have to work the swing shift every day except mon/weds, so there is no such thing as a weekend/ I have to show up super late to friend hangouts when I’m too tired to hang for long anyways. I also live in a HCOL area though, and have a financed car which adds to it. Rent is $780/mo for a tiny 9x10 room. And I have medical debt. No family to fall back on.

I have enough to make it work but if I skip a day without PTO, I’ll be behind. It’s stressful sometimes but it seems to be working for now."

Do they need 8? I suppose not. But to be fair, I don’t know police training, and I suspect neither do you. They seem to have handled it without lethal force, which we should be applauding.

If you boo the cops every time they do something right, you are potentially contributing to making good cops stop giving a fuck. They handled this situation fine, nobody was shot, nobody put on paid leave.

Tax dollars need to be used better across the board, I don’t disagree with you on that.   We don’t need a stupid high speed rail to LA, for example."

I fully realize that the kids involved are like 16, of course they are still learning life stuff and maturing still.

I’m hoping OP will see the advice and consider how to handle things in the future though. I learned a lot growing up by asking opinions, since I basically had to raise myself. More useful to compare a lot of varied opinions than source just a few from the people you know IRL. Everything everyone reads should always be taken with a grain of salt, though, ya know?"
femalefashionadvice,fdd2w1c,t1_fdd1anq,1578292582.0,"That’s very, very true. I used to pour time and money into cosplay when I had more time and spare cash. It can get expensive. Plus- it didn’t always look great, but it was fun. If you have the template already its much easier than figuring out how to cut pieces. More complicated things like a blazer get iffy, but if it’s a simple, casual sleeveless dress or something like that it’s not so bad.

I recently found a tanktop I wanted, but alas! I am too fat to fit any of the sizes they offer, and it has a weird crop top but with an elastic band at the waist thing that would not look cute on me at all anyways.

AmItheAsshole,fdcxzct,t3_ekicbi,1578287640.0,"NTA. My sister and I were in a court ordered guardianship with my aunt from ages approx 5-13 due to both of my parent’s various addictions. She didn’t really do much to parent me, just collected child support, paid the bills, and kept me fed. The rest of the time she sat on ebay while I ran around the neighborhood barefoot or stayed in my room. I can’t recall a time where she said my parents loved me, but she also hated my mom (my mom was the younger of the two and was more successful in a lot of ways). I still think she narc’d on them more out of spite, than to help me and my sister.

Nobody wanted to tell me a damn thing so they wouldn’t “hurt me.” Allegedly my maternal grandparents were the reason my aunt wouldn’t tell me, they told her not to, even though I kept asking what the deal was and why I couldn’t just go home (parents were well out of prison when I started asking). I ran away from her at 13 and only then did I get to go back with my parents, the courts decided.

My aunt recently texted me that now I’m 26 and my mom passed, she has been keeping court papers for me with evidence, I guess to explain herself and make herself look better? I’ll be honest, now I don’t fucking care. It won’t change a thing. I still hate my aunt, and don’t tell my dad I love him very often (for many other reasons too, post-guardianship, mostly).

All I learned from the ordeal was that if I can’t trust my parents and I can’t trust anyone else in my family to tell me the truth, why trust anyone at all?

The trust issues messed up my perception of familial relationships and extended into friendships in grade school. I self-sabotaged a few of those on accident because of the trust issues. I started learning how to come out of my shell and relaxing after high school, but today people probably still think I’m kind of weird or something. Still working on it, but I’m happy to say it’s far better. Just took a little over a decade and a lot of effort to work on...

So, yeah. Don’t feel bad about telling him the truth. Keep on insisting that his mom loves him. Give him sources about what addiction does to people so he knows what to expect if he decides to go meet his mom, try to contact her first to gauge the situation. And I would work him up to the idea of seeing a therapist, if you are willing to take him to one. But don’t tell him he has to do it, tell him most adults will go at some point for many reasons, and it’s not embarrassing or stupid. I was always embarrassed to go and didn’t use the therapy sessions to my advantage, I really should have."
AmItheAsshole,fdcmwts,t1_fdcgr9f,1578278881.0,"Not that I don’t agree with you but when people are angry or upset in general, they don’t care about technicalities. Pointing out stuff like that only makes people more angry and gets you further from solution.

If they lay it out simple and say they were being extra rude and they are sorry for saying her disability doesn’t matter, but they also need her to think before she speaks and apologize for picking on their friend, it will give the sense of “you went first and gave some, now I should give some” and will make her more willing to comply.

Deescalation is the goal here, not being “right”."
