politics,fefi8xp,t1_fefi41a,1579056873.0,"And what Warren was saying is that it’s wrong to say someone can’t win because of their sex, but only a woman can beat Trump."
politics,fefi4er,t3_eousl5,1579056796.0,"So Warren is upset because she says Bernie told her she can’t win because she’s a woman and then follows that up by saying Bernie can’t win because he’s a man. 

I’d be more than happy to vote for her against Trump, but you can’t have it both ways."

dogs,fdzuf15,t1_fdzsssu,1578796040.0,"It’s one of those things where any attention is better than none. And there have been some ads where my dogs have reacted really cutely. There was a car commercial awhile back with dogs barking at each other. Both of my dogs would stop what they were doing, run to the TV and cock their heads back and forth whenever it came on. I even had to look it up on YouTube once to show some friends how they reacted. The ones that get them barking annoy me, but not enough to boycott anyone."
dogs,fdzrryq,t3_enc83c,1578794276.0,"I took a marketing class where they said those things are done intentionally to get reactions out of pets. People have gotten so good at tuning out ads, many commercials attempt to get the attention of their pets in order to force the viewers to look at the ad."

politics,fdkcd87,t3_eluf2k,1578500894.0,Fuuuuck. I can't think of one good reason he needs all those military guys up there.
LifeProTips,fcsyjpx,t1_fcsne24,1577928334.0,"I did the same. I didn’t feel like being sexually active for a couple weeks after our dog died. I can’t even imagine how long it would take me to even consider a simple date with someone if my wife died. I understand everyone greaves differently, but there are just some things I can’t imagine anyone doing during that period."
