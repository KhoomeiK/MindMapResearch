Hell, that's even worse, because one is a teenager with their own thoughts and opinions about their identity, while the other's a fucking infant.

One girl thought she was part cat or something. I specifically remember her telling me she had ringworm, and only animals could get it. I'm sure she remembers that, too...

One boy I *hated*, because he bullied me, believed or tried to make us believe he was a wizard. He said he could make TV characters pop out into real life, and I remember one specific instance he said he froze our teacher, who was walking in the hallway, in place. When she walked in about 3 seconds later he said he unfroze her. He was annoying."

Torture is a human rights violation, and as much as I'd like to see offending pedophiles be subject to it, they're still human. What this law bans is conversion therapy on *minors*. Legal adults are still able to. Also, it's not even a complete (or effective) ban in the first place."
