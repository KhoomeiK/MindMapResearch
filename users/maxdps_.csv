It's unfortunate CBT wasn't successful for you but I'm glad you found something that was. It's just silly and surface-level to apply your anecdotal experience as objective evidence. Dumb people do this, and we don't want to be dumb. 
  
Objectively, CBT is the leading therapy for long-term positive gains, full stop. All therapy is ""mind tricks you can read about for free in a book"", you are simply talking to a professional who's equipt with picking up triggers and understanding why you think the way you do. You learn to identify those triggers and turn your negative coping mechanisms into positive coping skills.

intj,feobvb4,t1_fenxvcf,1579297884.0,"Well yeah, youre comparing apples to oranges.
  
CBT is precisely how you perceived it, *it focuses on the immediate situation and works to give you solutions towards them*  
  
Not all anxiety or depression stems from a past traumatic event and many people are just looking for a solution to why they are feeling the way they are, hence CBT. It just has a far less emotional component to it compared to standard therapy and focuses more on your thought-process in that immediate situation as opposed to questions like the ""Why"".  
  
CBT won't pass away, quite the contrary because based on statistics it's the most effective type of therapy for anxiety and depression."
intj,fenvi6s,t1_fenuqgo,1579291538.0,"That’s interesting because the whole idea of CBT being solution focused is to get away from the whole “motivational poster” type of approach.

intj,femzl92,t1_femuyvw,1579273612.0,"To each their own, I struggled more with anxiety and was searching for a way to snap that negative thought loop. Changing physical inputs did very little for me and had almost no long-term effect, it wasn't until I started seeing a therapist who specialized in CBT which promoted a far more successful long-term plan because it gave me actual resources to use for these situations. Also to add if it matters, I have severe vertigo so I can't do a lot of fun moving stuff like rollercoasters or even heights so I tend to not rely on that kind of stuff. I've had situations where I've thrown up and fainted, that was super fun lol.
  
But with that said, I still keep up with the physical inputs since I think they help too. I continue to take my daily vitamines and *magnesium* with a huge glass of water every morning, remain fit, and make sure to spend time on my hobbies. *Objectively*, my life is absolutely perfect for what I want out of it, it's just the issues in my mind that give me struggle.  
  
Something common here is that people are aware that they are feeling depressed or struggling with anxiety but don't know where to start. Since this is specifically an ""INTJ"" forum, I always make sure to mention CBT specifically due to how it's solution-focused. That point absolutely stands out for ""INTJs"" more than other personality types, I think, mainly because a lot of ""INTJs"" like to believe they are objective and fact-focused anyway.  
  
If that alone can kickstart someone going to therapy, then I'll continue to do it every single time. I've had people come back and message me weeks later telling me how they finally started to see a therapist and how much it's helped them. That makes it all worth it and is really the main reason I continue to frequent this subreddit."

You see similar patterns with car thieves who sift through rows of cars at a stadium or mall. They jiggle handles until one pops and then they start to take what they find valuable, they aren't busting windows of locked cars looking to steal the entire thing. Most thieves aren't assuming anything and only focus on what they can physically get their hands on and something unlocked is just a far easier target than something locked.  
  
I think your point about luggage thief favoring locked luggage over unlocked luggage is pretty surface-level because a small luggage-lock isn't going to deter someone with those intentions.  
  
However, it could deter the thief looking to sift through easy accessible bags where they can just reach in the bag, grab whatever, and move on quickly without being seen.

She was someone who never locked her luggage, now she does.

First, start with a car where the hood level is right about to where your hips are, this will ensure the level you need to raise your legs isn't so high to where you feel like you need *jump* when running to pick up speed as opposed to just *gliding* across.  
  
My personal recommendation for attire would go towards the Champs grey sweat pants for maximum glide with the lowest effort, but track pants will do just fine. I tend to prefer 100% cotton in these situations because sometimes synthetic material can create minute scratch marks due to butt friction. It's simple science bro.
  
Lastly, and probably the most important bit, is your trajectory and approach to the ensuing hood slide. Your trajectory should basically be perpendicular to the direction of the car and you want to slide across right around the middle of the hood, possibly even about 75% up the hood towards the windshield for a more robust support system. If you're a bigger man, you could slightly askew your entry so your slide somewhat down the slope of the hood, closer towards the front of the car which would ensure you make it completely across the hoodscape. 
  
A common misconception is that you *jump* upon entry but this usually results in a dented hood because the impact is too hard upon entry. What you really should do is rely less on your leg strength for the jump and more on your core strength to smoothly pull your legs up to more of a seating position and let momentum take care of the rest.  
  
As mentioned above, you want a car with a hood that's level with your hips so when your running and gaining momentum it takes less input action to pull your legs up and level that booty with the hood. Remember, you don't really want to *jump onto the hood* and you want to treat it more like a slip n' slide and I'm sure it's something a little bit of astro glide couldn't fix if you find yourself having friction issues."

leagueoflegends,fcxqbwk,t1_fcxnejn,1578068938.0,"> I think you overestimate how much authority is given to an individual representative or how much of a shit they would even give in such a scenario.

I don't think I'm overestimating anything at all, but your latter point is pretty much what I'm talking about. It's this point also in which I'm using for *why* these companies can even act this way to begin with, as I've already mentioned. 
  
Regardless of what *you think that I THINK*, there was an unfortunate situation for a customer that simply should never happen, he contacts *customer support* for help, receives absolutely no help or information on the matter and has the door slammed in his face.  
  
*Oh well, that's just standard procedure, right?*
  

  
>The rep might not care enough/be well paid enough to care enough to lose time to ask a supervisor to handle this problem. 

Right, further going with my point to why companies become *shit companies* overtime when stuff like this happens and people just allow it. 
  
*Oh well, let's just chalk it up to bad employees and move on, right?*
  

  
>Uncommon issues in support are really hard to solve because there are so many processes and policies in place in most lines of support.  
  
100% disagree. Anecdotally, I've worked in a customer support center and started in their shit T1 position and worked to T3, this is absolutely not how you handle these cases..  Even in T1, I had *all* the tools to complete my daily work and If I did actually come across that ""uncommon issue"" I would literally fucking stand up, walk 3 cubicles over, and talk to my supervisor who would give me answers or atleast information for the customer to show we can assist.
  
Again, *regardless*, what you absolutely DO NOT do in these *genuine, uncommon issue situations* is to just say you can't do anything, shut down the case without explaining anything to the customer, and move on. What you *do* is inform the customer, remain transparent, and continue your diligence on fixing the situation.   
  
OP was basically told to fuck off and figure out himself, given absolutely no information towards anything he asked for.  
  
What confuses me the most is how you create excuses and just assume that's what happened rather than look at the actual objective evidence in front of you and base your opinion on that."

leagueoflegends,fcxllwj,t1_fcxk8o2,1578065894.0,"Lol, prove your statement and Ill eat my shoe. It's hilarious that you are using your own assumptions as if they are objective truth.  
  
In the real world, when you make a mistake it's often intended that you deal with the consequences of that mistake. More specifically, when a *company* creates an inconvenience for a *customer* it's also often intended that they fix the situation in favor of the customer.
  
>Player support employees are not Adkins (Admins, ftfy) and probably don't encounter this problem too often  
  
Assumption #1. Let's apply some critical-thinking skills.  
  
It's literally in the name of their job title, *Player Support*, and yet you somehow think they don't encounter ""player issues"" like this? Bro, take a second to just read through the comments *here* and you'll realize this issue is far more common than you assume it to be as there's been a few people saying they had the same or similar issues themselves.  
  
Now that this has been debunked, lets move on...
  
>so they play it by their usual guidelines because you can't go and ask admins what to do for every little uncertainty.  
  
Assumption #2. You mention ""guidelines"" yet you continue to say ""can't go and ask admins...""  
  
What exactly are those ""guidelines"" you made up? Wouldn't it make sense for those ""guidelines"" to include a clause where it says ""IF YOU DON""T KNOW WHAT TO DO GO ASK A FUCKING ADMIN?""  
  
Instead, you assume that if they can't get an answer from their ""guidelines"" that they just shutdown a case and move on without helping the customer because they can't be bothered to ask another admin for help?  
 
Are you *seriously* this dense?
  
>They did not know hot to react in that situation, don't be so paranoid  
  
Incorrect, they knew exactly how to respond to this situation and it's to just say *""Sorry, we can't do anything""* and move on. *Player Support* has the tools to reinstate/remove skins from accounts, this should be nothing new since this is brought up a lot here. 
  
*You* are the reason why companies do these type of tactics to begin with, and calling it *paranoia* is hilarious because clearly this is something **that's actually happening**.  
  
It's pretty apparent to how gullible you are considering you just refuse to use the objective evidence you do have and would rather believe your own assumption.

""MMO"" specifically implies the social network, not objective gameplay or genre, which is preciously what my comment was aimed at. 
  
*To me*, GW2 absolutely feels like an *MMO* because it's specifically the social networking that enhances the objective gameplay for me and is the reason why I find myself coming back all the time. Not due to the actual gameplay itself, but specifically the organic social interactions within.  
  
As mentioned, it's all of the objective gameplay stuff that I find lacking. No verticle progression once at end-game, no real sought-after rewards other than those within the gem shop, and just the lack of replayable content are all reasons why I find myself continuously quitting. I greatly enjoy the ""MMO"" aspect of GW2, just not so much the ""RPG"" aspect."
Guildwars2,fcu441r,t1_fcqvyuu,1577972066.0,">Skip GW2 if you're looking for something that actually feels and acts like an MMO.  
  
Personally, I disagree, but to each their own. 
  
I've played just about every MMO to end-game and have been around GW since the early days. I've also ""quit"" GW2 multiple times but find myself coming back more than any other game *specifically due to it's community*.

The only thing I really do in GW2 is WvW and some sPvP, but it's the interactions and group play within WvW for why I keep returning. There's just something *more* when your apart of a lively group and everyone is enjoying themselves. I've met amazing people, had great conversations, and way more often than not am I enjoying my time out in the battle grounds.  
  
I'm an old DAoC RvR player, so it makes sense for why WvW in GW2 is my main choice, but it really has very little to do with the actual gameplay and way more to do with the people that I'm playing with. Of all the communities I've been apart of, GW2 has always left me with a positive experience. Not sure if this is an unpopular opinion or I'm just lucky, but regardless it's definitely the reason I find myself coming back to GW2 every few months.

Well, *""some""* turned into about **50 laptops**, All of which needed to be hard-wired as the state test application wouldn't work over Wi-fi... all within a fucking theater hall *that doesn't even have power outlets* let alone fucking network drops for these some 50 laptops.
 

  
The schools didn't provide equipment and all this stuff had to be a request made to the ""county"". So, I had to fucking negotiate with the ""County"" because anyone familiar with the school-system will understand how fucking scarce resources are... the only thing they ended up providing me with was a spool of cat5e cable, a bag of rj45s, and a crimper tool. They just straight up rejected my request for switches, power strips, and back-up battery banks.
  
This then turned into another meeting with the Principle because I had to inform her that it was physically impossible to set up the theater hall as a lab room, so we ended up negotiating with the computer class teacher to give up his room for a few weeks.  
  
His lab room had ~25 computers already placed and I sardined in **all** those laptops, just as they asked. Testing was an absolute shit show because they also didn't understand why the internet was so slow when the entire fucking school logged into the network to take state tests all at the same time.
