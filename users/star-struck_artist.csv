Basically, the lgbtq+ community is made up of different types of genders as well as sexualities. Gender is who you identify as, sexuality is who you love. (And sex is whatever is south of the border)"

Because her parents are super homophobic and Christian, they forced her to go to a Christian school. She said that her “parents thought that the other gay kids at school” made her gay too. My advice? Stay in contact. It’ll be hard, but trust me, otherwise you would be super sad without them. And stay positive!"
memes,fdzxl5v,t1_fdztx0j,1578798262.0,"Yes, but reducing the chances is important. Theres something called herd immunity. If everyone who can gets a shot, the people who can’t are safe because the virus cant spread as easily. However, when anti-vaxxers don’t vaccinate, the virus is able to spread via them, and reach vulnerable people who are unable to get the shot. I know its not perfect, but its all we have. The kid caught the flu because people didn’t vaccinate, letting the virus spread. Thats what has to do with vaccination."

wholesomememes,fddtqwp,t1_fd4roum,1578323755.0,"Well I do. I think the fact that you follow a lie like it’s the Bible without any actual proof or statistics might show that you need to take your own advice. And just saying, anyone who posts a statement like that needs to have at least *some* proof if they want anyone to believe them. So yeah, the “burden of proof” does lie with you. And by the way, you said that we are brain dead? Well, I wonder who made us that way...
