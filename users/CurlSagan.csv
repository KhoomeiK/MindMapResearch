trashy,ff59i0n,t3_erou3d,1579584292.0,"Some places have laws against drive-thru lines corralling cars in. If you're from one of those places, the idea of getting stuck in your car in a line may be completely foreign. You can't just drive out of the line.

People who are on call (firemen, medical professionals, police) can often get calls when they're on lunch and have to drop what they're doing and leave. So they're sometimes told to avoid drive-thrus. But when your lunch is at midnight and only drive-thrus are open, that's difficult. It's also a shit position when there's an emergency in the line (I worked fast food and we had a car fire).

And that's why they are illegal in some places."

Let the regular cards follow this sleek, black design and then the draw 4 should have holograms and bright neon colors and 4 different horrible fonts. If there's a way to get crappy animated gifs from old Geocities websites onto a playing card, that would be super. Ideally, every time you play a draw 4, there should immediately be a parade of loud children banging pots and pans just to twist the knife as much as possible.

The inexperienced people had bamboo that could individually move to absorb much of the blow, whereas the instructor's bamboo moves as a single solid unit. All of the force of his swing goes into splitting the bamboo.

It's like that scam carnival game where you're given a BB gun and you have to shoot a hole around a paper target.
