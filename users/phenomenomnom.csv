Fun fact: grits are healthier than other corn products: polenta or cornbread or tortilla chips,

Agree with stock for grits if you want it as a side dish for supper, I’m good with milk & butter for breakfast.

Had an anthropology class ages ago and we got into what “play” is. 

“Play” is practice for real life skills and behaviors. You can explore your feelings about difficult things in a safe way before you encounter them irl, you can hone skills. 

but it’s also a performance, a communication. 

So: a cat or a dog can’t talk so they use body language, right? Cat and dog lovers know how an animal says “I’m hungry” or “I’m happy” or “I’m angry” or “I’m injured.” 

Even “I love you.” Cats bare their butthole to you because that’s what a predator strikes on a fleeing animal. It’s the bullseye, the vulnerable target in a boss battle. Displaying it expresses trust. 

But how do you say “we are squad, and I would never hurt you”? 

They can’t express a negative like “would not”. Or conceive a future in which hurting may or may not happen. 

So what they do is, they *perform* it. They go through all the motions of a real battle, but with relaxed bodies and shesthed claws, They have a fight, in which no one is injured. They *demonstrate* “here are all the things that would happen if we were going to hurt you” and then they don’t hurt you. 

Really drives the point across in a deep way, no? 

(Skipping to the end of the class, this is where human ritual comes from. Reinforcing things that are hard to say but are VERY inportant to a culture, not in words but by a kind of performance. Football games are this in a big way, right down to mascots slapping each other around a little or having a dance off

Hi, I work in health care in the US. What you say is wrong on basically every level. We go above and beyond on a daily basis and let me assure you we are not thinking about salary when we do; we are thinking about good outcomes for patients. You don’t get into this field ONLY for dollars and if you do, you open a private boutique practice (or become an anaesthesiologist). 

If you need another example in an *already* socialized industry, consider public schoolteachers, who work themselves to exhaustion, 5-7 days a week and as much as 18 hours a day grading papers and chaperoning events, *buying school supplies out of their own pockets* — and who are paid a goddamn pittance — why? Because of greedy-ass short-sighted Republicans working day and night to underfund education. 

By the way the PRIVATE hospital I work at gave us shitty cold sandwiches for Christmas and Thanksgiving. That we paid for. Talk about the “bare minimum.” 

The all-knowing all-preserving all-improving invisible hand of the *market* must have had the night off. 

Actually, in unmonitored *capitalism* there is no reason to do more than the barest minimum."
