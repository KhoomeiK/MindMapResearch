That happens a lot with Canadians because you're allowed to stay 6 months in the US - definitely lots of things can happen in 6 months. 

Sounds like that got married in Australia and then he petitioned for her to come here which is by far the lenghtiest way to go about it, but 5 years is about the norm for that process. You're not allowed tourist entry in the US during that time because they know you want to live here permanently, that means there's a chance you won't leave when you visitor visa expires."
