aww,ffcky03,t1_ffcdiba,1579801661.0,"When we were young, my brother once spotted a cow in the process of going from sitting/laying down to standing upright. He said ""Oh I've never seen a cow standing up before"". Now of course we knew what he meant but 15-20 years later we still point at cows that are standing and say shit like ""Look! That cow is standing up!"""

If you know, how does CAR-T differ from other similar treatments? From what I know, we have treatments for many different cancers that work by binding to receptors on the cancer cells. Main issue being that those receptors exist on other body cells, like cells of the immune system."

She mentioned it enjoyed being brushed and I could likely do that. So after a while, when it seemed lonely and desperate for attention enough, I grabbed the brush, sat down, and it hopped in my lap. For a good 5 minutes it just purred.... I'd never seen it before. Then it looked up at me with big eyes, swatted the brush, jumped down and SANK it's teeth into my foot. Ohhhh cats..."
