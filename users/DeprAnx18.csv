philosophy,ffcb2pe,t3_erxhqb,1579795590.0,"There’s a chair in front of me. The chair that I think is in front of me is not actually the chair that is in front of me. 

He starts with this example, after saying that his work is being taken out of context by “in short, wooly philosophy”. He also claims that philosophers wants science to “keep its hands off my consciousness mystery”. Me thinks he protest too much. 

What exactly is it he’s trying to claim by saying the chair I think I see in front of me isn’t really what I think it is? That may we’ll be the case, but then does what “I think the chair is” matter anymore? There is no indication from the author that my perceptions are irrelevant, but I think this certainly ought to be addressed because I think it’s an easy inference to make based on what is written.  

If this is a way of saying, from within neuroscience discourse, that no one person’s bodily perceptions can provide an acontextual, objective view of the world, then I totally agree. 

If the argument is that science can provide us with a picture of consciousness and the world that is more “objectively” “correct” than the world of our perceptions, I vehemently disagree and find the level of scientism here frightful. 

It doesn’t matter to me what science says about how correct my perceptions are. Based on observation alone, I say I perceive things. I would even say that perception is a prerequisite of observation. Even if my perceptions are different from that which I’m perceiving (they are, which I know from having perceived other people in social interactions, and finding a mismatch between their intent and my perception of it), a complete scientific picture of consciousness still ought to be able to account for the fact that I perceive something. 

An account of consciousness that ignores our subjective experience of perception would be like painting an incredibly vibrant, detailed mural of the most boring office space in the world."
askphilosophy,ff9hc7b,t1_ff9da8a,1579713028.0,"Yeah when I said I found it ironic, I mean that as the most beautiful, perfectly encapsulating kind of irony possible. I’ve never made as much progress as I’d like to have in that book, but I’m pretty sure he opens with that reflection about only being able to pose that question late in life and I find it fascinating. 

I didn’t know he’d discussed that asking what something “is” is the wrong question, but I’ve thought that myself before. Or at least, I feel like “how” questions and “why” questions are often conflated in a way that makes both difficult to disentangle and more difficult to answer in a satisfactory way."
apexlegends,ff4xxfi,t1_ff4uw1i,1579575110.0,I mean both my games were 11:40 something. Don’t think it could be much longer than that. And I had 5 kills on both. Not trying to be a dick but you’re missing out lol it’s kind of a lot of fun. Nonstop action.

askphilosophy,ff35rr1,t1_ff31wop,1579534342.0,"Yeah I totally see that and I think one of the best things I’ve learned from “philosophy” in general is an inquisitive attitude and the continual reminder that I’m always missing something and there’s always something more I could know.

Hiding the whole game so I can get really great loot and die in the final circle is a really fucking boring way to spend 25 minutes.

AskFeminists,feyughn,t1_feyqfri,1579450667.0,"What about just “feminist” instead of “male feminist” or “ally”? Is there something about the term that excludes cis men from identifying with it? 

I’m only 23 so my life experience is negligible, but I remember being younger and feeling that feminist was a dirty word, and definitely not applicable to men. As I’ve grown and reflected, I realized that thinking that “feminist” is a dirty word is kind of a toxic idea in itself. The way I’ve tried to combat this within and outside of my own mind is by calling myself a feminist. If I call myself an ally, I feel like I support the same things as feminism, but by not identifying with the term itself I’m reminded of the feelings of feminism being a dirty word and not something for men. 

I wish I didn’t have to identify that way at all, feminism should be the default. I wish we lived in a world where it was only noteworthy when someone wasn’t a feminist, and I feel like calling myself a feminist is one of the contributions I can make to that effort in my lifetime."

MrRobot,feuyggz,t1_feuis9g,1579391177.0,"Sorry lol I just thought it sounded poetic and it was early, I didn’t mean to make a claim about all men. I, a man, personally cry a fair amount in front of people I’m comfortable with, but definitely not in front of anyone else. I’ve been afraid to since I was young and I would cry at school and that made it hard to fit in which is something I struggled a lot with back then. I chose to say “men”, because I think men in particular are shamed by our culture for crying, or at least, I got the impression it was a shameful thing to cry as a boy. So I said men because I want to live in a world where openly crying and healthily expressing emotion is associated with masculinity, and I want men to feel safer to express themselves. At the same time, I want everyone to feel safe to cry and express their emotions, and I didn’t mean to leave anyone out with what I said."

DarK,feneite,t1_fendf5i,1579282975.0,"It almost seems like a “loop” is intensely a matter of the perspective one occupies “within” it. Like from the perspective of the Winden we’ve seen for 2 seasons, Winden 2 would be “outside” the loop, and appear to be its own loop either breaking ours or interesting with it. But if we could somehow step outside of both Windens to a perspective encompassing both, I suspect it would all seem to be one massive unchangeable loop"
philosophy,fence2t,t3_eo8chq,1579281678.0,"Anyone else seen the Netflix original “Dark” out of Germany? There are implicit and explicit philosophical ideas throughout and to anyone who hasn’t seen or heard of it I highly recommend checking it out. 

To anyone who has seen it, what sort of philosophical themes have you picked up while watching? 

IIRC there are multiple explicit references to Nietzsche. I’ve been looking at Heidegger lately, and I have to think that Being and Time is making its influence felt in some way in the show, though I wonder (and suspect I’m at least partly correct) about how difficult it would be to grapple with someone like Heidegger as a German, if the controversy he invokes stateside is any indication."
DarK,fenblqz,t3_eq1aqz,1579281195.0,"I wonder if it will even matter in the end. Like, they keep talking about a loop, and a cycle. Why should we think this is anything more than a different way of talking about the life we all live? 

If the loop is, was, or ever will be broken, how was this not a part of the loop in the first place? One of the themes I’ve understood the show to be trying to convey is that nothing can happen in any of the years we witness that won’t effect the others. 

This means that if the loop is/was/will be broken at any point, from the perspective of “outside the loop”, the loop already has been broken, and we are already seeing those effects. But wouldn’t that make this in fact a continuation of the loop, rather than a breaking of it? Precisely. There is no difference between if the loop breaks or it doesn’t. The events play out the same regardless, for no other reason than that’s the way they happen to play out, based on the choices each character makes with the information and experiences available to them at the time."

philosophy,fegvmxt,t1_feg28mg,1579103547.0,"I mean that in itself is a philosophical opinion. Why are blogs “too shit” compared to published papers? Wouldn’t it be a bit of an over-generalization to suggest that simply by virtue of being a blog post the quality of a piece of writing will suffer? 

A lot of my professors had their own websites and blogs where they would write things that were never intended to be published. Does that make their work shittier? 

I don’t meant to attack you (though I was a bit put off by what seemed to me to be an unnecessarily critical comment), but I think in general we ought to be more critical of the authority we grant a text simply on the basis of it being published. Academic institutions, including a university press, are run by people who are pursuing their own agendas and are subject to human mistakes and biases.

But the world is all that is the case, so I’m not actually cut off from it, even though it is the case that I feel that way, because the world is all that is the case! 

That’s probably not remotely what he meant by it, but that’s another thing I love about philosophy: who gives a fuck what he meant by it?

But in a theoretical sense, it fascinates me. And when I do care I’m really not sure how to communicate a message when I don’t know who will receive what. If that makes any sense."
AskFeminists,fco5v7u,t1_fcnwdbx,1577824660.0,"I’m not sure there’s a reliable way to ascertain where such a stereotype, if it can even be called that, came from. I’m hypothesizing that perhaps, some people who tweet #notallmen do so, at least in part, because they misunderstand feminism and think that it’s equivalent to hating men. The thing is I don’t think it would take a large number of women (or men) who hate men calling themselves feminists in order for people tweeting #notallmen to come to that misunderstanding. I think that stereotype (like all stereotypes) is born out of a lack of nuance and willingness to reflect. Perhaps that lack of willingness, for many men (or women) comes from fear of (white) patriarchal power structures losing societal control. Maybe that can be more directly addressed in discourse as a remedy to reiterating the problems with #notallmen ad nauseam. 

I’m not really sure what my point was anymore, but the thing I’d want to emphasize is nuance in discourse, I wish there was a way to communicate a message to large masses of people without reducing the intricacies of the issue to hashtags."
AskFeminists,fcnmm81,t1_fcnk20x,1577814372.0,"Sorry if I didn't articulate myself quite right, I don't at all mean to say that the view points feminism advocates aren't (constantly, and exhaustingly) met with that response, but I think that response stems from a misunderstanding of feminist view points, in part because of people who call themselves feminists but really just hate men. Facebook and Twitter I think are really at fault here. If you're already following content that is remotely right of center politically social media algorithms are, I would think, much more likely to show you content that misrepresents feminism. 

I'm sorry if I've presented myself poorly here, I'm not trying to be a dick. I really struggle to write in a way that limits my point to just one idea, and I think sometimes it seems like I'm grasping at straws just to stir the pot, but there is a method to the madness and an attempt at a coherent point at least, I just don't always represent that very well."
changemyview,fcngxu7,t3_ehvu8x,1577811481.0,">More recently I've started realising that without minds to conceptualise the world, the universe really is just atoms and energy. A chair is only a chair because we say it is, else it's just a collection of atoms. And even the act of conceptualisation can be broken down into electricity reacting with atoms.

I've had this realization myself. But let's take it a step further. How is it we know the universe really is just atoms and energy? I'm not saying this invalidates that claim, but I believe the answer is still **minds**. Without minds to conceptualize the world, there wouldn't be a world to conceptualize. Our senses didn't evolve to present us with impressions of the world ""*in itself*"", our senses evolved based on what helped us survive. This means that our perceptions of the world, while completely valid, are uniquely *human* perceptions. A chair is only a chair because we say it is. But by the same token, the universe is only atoms and energy *because we say it is*. This doesn't make it wrong or invalid. Based on the *way we say* gravity and friction and aerodynamics work, we keep planes in the sky. The act of conceptualization can be broken down into electricity reacting with atoms, but so too can electricity and atoms be broken down into conceptualization. Without (human) minds to conceptualize the world, if we may take some imaginative liberties, the world would simply go on, whatever that means. The thing is, in our human lives, we grow up learning to talk and think about the world in particular ways. We literally couldn't imagine what the world would be like without thinking and talking in those ways, because those are quite literally the only tools we have for that job since birth. So what if thats the way science talks about you petting your cat, thats just a way of talking about it, and an unhelpful one at that. Your cat has a mind too, and probably a mind that is 100% unaware of the physics of the universe. I don't mean this to be a dick at all, I actually mean it very positively, but try thinking of humans as less significant. I think we all learn to think too highly of ourselves as humans. I think human value is lowered by introducing it to the messy world of human values.

I also highly recommend the 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume. He talks about dealing with this skeptical crises himself. He says that no matter how intense his skeptical crisis, when he returns to his game of backgammon it's still a game of backgammon. That nagging existential crisis will persist and come up in your life every now and again. Its a reminder to get out of your study and surround yourself with people you enjoy; they need to escape from that existential dread just as much as you. I think thats what friends are for, and I think thats beautiful."
AskFeminists,fcne77h,t1_fcncupr,1577809858.0,"I mean you’re right but that’s not really what I’m talking about. I even said I don’t think it should be incumbent upon feminism to add disclaimers like “not all men” to everything. I feel like a hashtag like #notallmen isn’t born out of a legitimate disagreement with feminism, but is largely motivated by people responding to extreme views masquerading as feminism. No legitimate feminist, as I understand it, would ever claim that “all men” are responsible for anything, it’s reductive and unhelpful. So surely #notallmen can’t be responding to legitimate feminist view points? And this is what makes me wonder if there are misunderstandings at play here, and makes me wonder if/how that can be avoided."
changemyview,fcnd9oz,t1_fcn0kxp,1577809253.0,"This is a good point and a very troubling point for me. You’re completely correct that we’re always communicating something about ourselves with our appearance. The trouble is, I’m not so sure it’s always clear cut what it is that we’re communicating with that appearance. I have no idea what some random person will perceive by m poorly kept beard. I can make some assumptions based on how I’ve seen people respond to poorly kept beards in the past, but I really can’t know for sure. So is it actually possible for us to “control” the self-expression that we’re always engaged in? Or does that sort of take on a life of its own, despite the fact that we are responsible for creating it?"
AskFeminists,fcnbvrn,t1_fcn2u52,1577808335.0,"I completely agree, but to sort of play devils advocate for a moment, is it possible that a lot of people who use #notallmen misunderstand the ideas they think they’re protesting with that hashtag? Not to say it’s incumbent upon feminism to add “I don’t think this applies to all men” to everything anyone says, but I wonder if there is a way of putting an idea like “patriarchal structures aren’t inherently the fault of all men alive today, but it is certainly in large part their responsibility to fix it” into an easy to remember catch phrase."
philosophy,fcignhv,t3_efyzgi,1577662245.0,I think it’s fascinating that Hume begins and ends his autobiography by acknowledging the potential vanity in what he’s doing. I wonder if one of the secrets to his success is his awareness of how easily wise men can fall into vanity.

So I punched him into the lava, grabbed his banner, and brought him back right next to circle, my logic being that if he wasn't back I really didn't care if he died at that point. That's when his buddy gets on mic and starts calling me a cunt because his mate was in the bathroom. Like you couldn't have said something earlier? If you're out here you British fuck, you're a real dick and I hope you at least feel better about yourself from being mean to other people so its not totally pointless.
