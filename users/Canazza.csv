Fixed Odds Betting Machines.

This is where they make all their money now. Moreso than actual bookmaking. So they filled their shops with as many of these as they could.

In 2005 legislation came in to restrict the impact of these. You were only allowed 4 FOBMs per store... So what did they do? They made lots of little shops with a token bookie booth and filled it with FOBMs.

What can be done about it? Well, last year legislation came in to reduce their impact, reducing the maximum single wager from £100 to £2.

[William Hill complained a majority of their 900 shops would become loss makers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44148285)

expect to see a lot of these bookies shut down in the next year or so.

gamedev,fdqiffp,t1_fdq6bbw,1578667452.0,"What I've done in the past is create separate instances based off the same seed, but with a constant offset.

So say you have a world with seed **A**. If you uses one instance of Random with seed **A** to position the player at a certain point in the world, and another instance of Random with seed **A** to create an enemy at a point in the world, you'll always create an enemy on top of the player because it'll always pump out the same two numbers.

If you use a single instance of Random with the seed **A** and pass it around, sure, you'll get an enemy spawn in a different position, but it's a lot more sensitive to changes in your code (like the order or number of times .next() is called).

If you use different instances of Random, with seed **A** + 10000 for player positioning and seed **A** - 10000 for enemy positioning, you'll get a different sequence of numbers and therefore different positions, and code changes will only affect the system they're used in.

[edit] also, in response to ""if it's a low value i'll restart the game"", this is done in a few speedruns, most notably Pokemon Emerald which sets its seed to 0 initially, but is constantly calling its version of 'next' constantly. Meaning it's entirely possible to manipulate the seed by starting the game X number of frames from boot (which some TASes do)"
