Getting around a foreign country is something you need to consider before you even book the trip. It's important to know facts, like that you use military time, so you can study it and prepare.

atheism,fehkaqe,t3_ep51iz,1579118277.0,"Many moons ago I decided to become a surrogate and carry a baby for a childless couple. 99% of the people who contacted me were dead set against adopting because the baby would then not look like them (I always asked why they opted not to adopt). They all said the same thing ""we're praying to have our own"" as if prayer would somehow put a baby in their doppelgänger, allowing them to have a new mini-me. For that reason, I insisted on only working with gay couples. Straight couples can adopt so much easier than gays, they just refuse to. I pissed off a lot of couples when I told them I'd never work with someone who cared more about what the child looked like rather than their health. They got even madder when I suggested maybe their 'god' was telling them not to have their own. After 6-10 years of trying, maybe it's just not meant to be? They insisted that wasn't the case, 'god' just had not yet blessed them yet. Riiight."
