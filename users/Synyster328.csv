personalfinance,ff7bdlt,t1_ff78k5z,1579645450.0,You're not wrong. Just a couple young 20yos making $70k  and no guidance. Being on the verge of bankruptcy was enough of a wake up call though.

personalfinance,ff59ske,t1_ff4cp6f,1579584568.0,"I think after reading a lot of these replies, and how the verdict seems pretty split, we may try to meet in the middle somewhat. We roll all our current debt into the home loan, but only do minor changes to the new place as needed rather than all at once. Then take the$15-25k from the sale of the current place and put it straight in an emergency account, only to be touched if one of us loses our job. That way, we get the lower payments to tackle our debt while still having a backup plan for a few months if shit hits the fan. 

If *either* of us lose our job, it shouldn't be a big deal since we'd for the most part both be able to handle things on our own. The only concern is if we both lose our jobs at the same time, which the odds are astronomically low. Still, I'd rather be prepared for it since losing the house needs to be a 0.00% possibility."
personalfinance,ff59flw,t1_ff570rr,1579584230.0,"I can see where you are coming from on that, but truly after mortgage, car payment, minimum card/loan payments, daycare, and groceries, we put everything we had left into extra payments. If we were to roll that into a home equity loan, we'd have probably double that, at least, to put towards knocking it down."
personalfinance,ff57uyk,t1_ff4doq2,1579582799.0,"It sure seems like it on paper! At the time, about 5 or 6 years ago, we were making $140k in unstable sales jobs. Thought we were on top of the world with only 2 kids, but when the 3rd one came along the jobs went to shit and by the time we realized how dumb we were, it was too late. Came really close to losing everything but we managed. Took a lot of hard work but we've finally pulled ourselves back to a good place, really a better place, but we've changed our ways and spend a fraction of what we used to."
personalfinance,ff52ehi,t1_ff4eeom,1579578374.0,"We were at $90k last year actually, which was when we finally got our spending under control and not stable jobs. So in a year we've paid down about $20k. Things are on a good track now."

personalfinance,ff51xg0,t1_ff4w828,1579578011.0,"The $70k isn't frivolous, it's necessary to make the place liveable.

personalfinance,ff4cif6,t1_ff4but3,1579560395.0,"Ha, yeah it would definitely be more cost effective to roll it all together. As for the remodel, it's not anything excessive, but the house currently has a few huge open rooms, we would need to make structural changes to put rooms in a useable state."

personalfinance,ff4c4f6,t1_ff4bqzs,1579560130.0,"That's fair. We racked up that debt from a year or two of bad luck with our jobs, and also getting in over our heads (3 new Audi's at once, for example). We've learned from our mistakes, gotten better jobs in stable careers, and cut almost all excess spending. We spent nearly 2 years sharing a car, while having 4 kids. Finally found the cheapest lease in town for a second car when we had the 5th a few months ago."
personalfinance,ff4bwxp,t1_ff4bptb,1579559996.0,"Would be a good plan, but we fully intend to move into the home. I guess I should have said it in the post but a relative knew we wanted this place, but didn't have the credit score to get a loan even though our income is good now. So they helped us buy it. We plan to retire in this house."
personalfinance,ff4bqvi,t1_ff4bk5t,1579559891.0,"Yes, wife and I went through a rough patch a few years ago soul searching our careers. Jobs now pay better than we've ever had, and more stable.

Kotlin,felxuem,t3_epn72f,1579233681.0,"Excellent generics, extension functions, data classes, syntactic sugar (writing the same thing is just more fun in Kotlin than in Java), full interoperability means there are no real drawbacks. Also hiring in the future, you will be able to target pretty much any Android developer.

Also working with collections out of the box is magical. 

And I almost forgot! One of, if not THE, biggest benefits of Kotlin over Java is the null-safety! 

Gone are the days of chasing down errant NullPointerExceptions. If you want something to be nullable, you declare it like

var foo: String? = ...

If you don't want it to ever be null, you declare it like

var foo: String = ...

Also the amount of inference Kotlin does is such a huge convenience. And having easy control over mutability with val/var is great too.

Honestly I could keep coming back to this list and updating it every 5 minutes because the more I think about Kotlin, the more I remember how much I love it."
