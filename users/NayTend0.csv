SCPSecretLab,fcc03g8,t3_egsyhz,1577592896.0,"Recommend using mic, it helps coordinate better as SCP, or NTF or just fucking around as D-Class. Game is not necessarily dying, just small. Not necessarily toxic either if you stay away from some servers. If you‚Äôre looking for servers, Dr Brights server or US East/West Official ~~CA East Official~~. It depends on how you like to play the game, since every server has different configurations and plugins, thus changing gameplay.

Things you should know:

-  **D-Class**: Avoid SCPs and NTF. Work with Chaos Insurgency. (Note: Disarmed D-Class will become Chaos when escaping, vice versa)

- **Scientist**: Avoid SCPs and CI. Work with NTF.

- **SCPs**: There are 12 SCPs in the game, 8 of which are playable: 173, 096, 049, 939-53, 939-89, 106, 079, 049-2. Other SCPs include: 018 - a bouncy ball that gains in speed when it hits a surface, 207 - coke that makes you run faster, but will slowly drain your HP, 500 - fully heals all damage and 207s effects, 268, - a hat that will temporarily make you invisible to everyone except for 939 and 079, and 914 - the machine that makes stuff better. Mainly used to upgrade keycards.

- **Nine-Tailed Fox** (NTF)/Facility Guard: Kill SCPs, D-Class (now optional), and CI. Rescue Scientists.

- **Chaos Insurgency** (CI): Kill NTF, and Scientists. Rescue D-Class.

~~- **Tutorial**: Technically doesn‚Äôt exist.~~

**Keycards**

Keycards help you get to places. Quick rundown:

- Scientist: Can open 914 (#914), 012 (#012) (Note: 012 does not actually appear in the game and cannot kill you, and the room makes for a useful hiding spot from SCPs.) Yellow.

- Zone Manager: Can open 914, checkpoints (EX-A / EX-B) (these are crucial to progressing). Commonly referred to as blue card. Teal.

- Major Scientist/Research Supervisor: Can open 914, 012 and checkpoints. Minimum card for opening SCP items. Orange.

- Senior Guard/MTF Cadet: See RS, but can open LCZ armory, HCZ armory, 049 armory, and nuke room armory. Light blue.

- Facility Manager: See RS, but can open exit gates, 106s chamber (106 can be recontained with a sacrifice to the holy femur croncher), surface nuke (boom boom), and intercom. Red.

- Containment Engineer: See Facility Manager, but cannot open exit gates. Pink.

- O5 Keycard: Can open every locked door. Black.

**Other keycards**:

- Janitor: Can only open 914. Light purple.

- Guard: Can open 914, checkpoints, HCZ armory, and LCZ armory (##00). Gray.

- MTF Lieutenant: See MTF Cadet, but can open exit gates (this is often required to escape). Blue.

- MTF Commander: See MTF Lieutenant, but can open the intercom room, where people can ~~make useful announcements~~ blast shitty music across the entire place. Dark blue.

Have fun!"
