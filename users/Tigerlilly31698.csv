GriefSupport,fd662xw,t3_ek2pfk,1578186036.0,"First, I want to say I am very sorry for your loss. 
Second, your sister looks like she was one of those people who could light up a room when they walk in. I bet she was a bunch of fun to be around. 
I know it‚Äôs hard when you feel like the light of your world, someone who lights burned so bright, suddenly goes away. The darkness can seem so overwhelming. Grief is difficult and different for everyone. Go through it however you feel you need to and take your time with it. 
Sending you and your family a great big hug!"

It was on somewhere between 2001 and 2002 I think. GWD was a villain. It was a pretty good show."

GriefSupport,fc0ijvw,t3_efd9b0,1577291614.0,"First of all...I‚Äôm so sorry. Second, I‚Äôm sending you a big, supportive hug. I hate that life hasn‚Äôt been fair to you or your beautiful son. There is a lot of joy bursting out of his smile in this picture, and I hate the world will miss out on this, as his light was extinguished too soon. 


This is my second Holiday Season without my mom, and the twenty-eighth without my dad. Since I don‚Äôt have any family within two-hundred miles, my best friend and her family are now my family. During the holidays I don‚Äôt want to hang out with anyone as I‚Äôd rather stay home and clean and watch Christmas movies, but I still go and hang out with her lovely family. Her family has been there for me even when I wanted no one around. Today I will grin and bear it, but will try to find the humor that will come through casual conversation. My best friend lost her mom eight years ago right after Thanksgiving, so she gets it too. 


I pray that you will be able to make it through today, tomorrow, and the days to come. When the funeral is over, and people stop coming around, just know there are those you will still be thinking of you. 


I hope in the days to come, you find the strength to greave in the way you want to. If you want to clean the house while crying, or if you can go somewhere private and scream out loud, do it. Everyone greaves in their own way. When some siblings that were in the youth group I volunteered with, suddenly lost their father, a group of us bought some old plates and cup from a thrift store, and we let the kids break them while stating out loud how angry they were that their dad had passed. We also let them throw and smash eggs against the side of a barn. It helped to let the anger of grief out. But you do whatever you need to do to make it through this dark time. Your true friends will respect that."
