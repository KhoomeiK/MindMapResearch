relationship_advice,ffg8wdp,t1_ffg7nq6,1579900987.0,I was in a long distance relationship for three years. I always trusted him but in the end of the relationship I realised that I was too trusting and naive.
depression,ffg8jsg,t3_etg010,1579900774.0,"I feel exactly the same. I feel guilty for being depressed. It scares me that my brain and my memory are not the same anymore. I have memory gaps, I can‚Äôt concentrate, my head constantly feels foggy and heavy. Few days ago I felt so desperate because I felt like I‚Äôm going completely crazy and I don‚Äôt have control over my brain anymore. I started to take a medicine with Piracetam and Cinnazirine few days ago and I feel tiny bit better. It helps with the blood supply of the brain.Ask you doctor to prescribe  you some nootropics."
relationship_advice,ffg76qn,t3_etg2fz,1579899928.0,"Email her (or text her) . Tell her how she made you feel to get it off your chest then block her if that‚Äôs exactly what you want. But since she cheated once , she might cheat again. Who knows , maybe she cheated before and she did not tell you about it."
mentalhealth,fesib51,t1_feouzvt,1579365449.0,My therapist said it takes two weeks to adjust and anxiety /panic attacks can get worse at first.
zoloft,fesg3hu,t1_feroe2z,1579364822.0,Thank you for your kind response. I think I had more energy when I was taking Zoloft. I suffer from insomnia so I hope it won‚Äôt affect my ability to sleep. My therapist said it‚Äôs better to take it in the first half of day and you should eat high-protein foods to have a better effect. I wish you the best too!
relationship_advice,fergoeh,t1_fer2v72,1579353613.0,Ask her what she wants from this relationship. Tell her you don‚Äôt feel loved as before and her behaviour upsets you.
relationship_advice,fer2koh,t3_eqfj3q,1579348917.0,"It seems like you shower her with excessive attention. Some people like to be on their own sometimes. I personally would not like that much attention, I need my space in a relationship."
relationship_advice,feomi0o,t3_eq7zen,1579302174.0,"To be honest, having a normal conversation is the best way. If you like a girl you ask for her phone number or add her on social media platforms so that you can invite her on a date next time (to try some new cuisine, new movie, play etc.). I never liked guys who try too hard and are too flirtatious, I never took them seriously."
depression,feo9svf,t1_feo9i95,1579297115.0,I remember having very colourful dreams with complex plots when I was on Sertraline before. Did it effect your metabolism ? Did you gain weight ?
depression,feo9jiv,t1_feo72mn,1579296972.0,"What you described sounds like a serotonin syndrome (plus you had a discontinuation syndrome because of other meds). It is usually takes two weeks to get used to SSRI antidepressants. She told me to take neuroleptics and tranquillizers if I need during those two weeks because of ‚Äúadjusting period‚Äù. And one more thing. You should not take it with caffeine (like coffee) and you should eat more protein while taking SSRI antidepressants. Thank you for sharing your experience. 
P.S. Phenazepam ruined my memory. I have gaps in my memory , can‚Äôt recall the conversations and my head always feels foggy. It scares me."
depression,feo672f,t3_eq6jji,1579295660.0,"That‚Äôs of my biggest fears. No , I definitely don‚Äôt want that. I take some tranquillizers whenever I fly."
bipolar,feide8a,t3_epbd14,1579135895.0,"To be honest, before you said that he told you that he is bipolar I just thought he is very manipulative and spoiled. If you are in a good relationship with his family , ask his family about it (was he officially diagnosed?)."

depression,feicsgm,t3_epbf4j,1579135488.0,"I start hitting my head when I‚Äôm too stressed. This happens because we bottle up our feelings and emotions, we don‚Äôt express our feelings and don‚Äôt show our frustrations to people. Then we start harming ourselves."

depression,fehxepf,t3_ep96tq,1579125775.0,"I feel you. People won‚Äôt get it if they were not in your shoes. Or they say they are also depressed and by depressed they mean occasional bad mood. Once my cousin said she is also depressed cause they have a mortgage to pay (she is not even the one paying, her husband does). I just stopped sharing anything with people. Some might say you are just lazy. It‚Äôs hard to explain that you have no energy or motivation at all. I was working out and crying few days ago, it was so hard to continue working out but I did it anyway. Nobody sees those moments."

It‚Äôs understandable that you feel that way cause you‚Äôve never met her physically ,  never hugged her or hold her hand. You did not have those ‚Äúnormal‚Äù mother-daughter moments to have that special bond. You are grateful but you don‚Äôt love her because she was more of a sponsor than a mother for you."

And yes, sometimes I get too angry or annoyed when I really should not. I can‚Äôt control it, I can feel all my insides burning from anger."

depression,fdqgar2,t3_emr4dw,1578665934.0,"I was heavily bullied when I was a child and it hit me hard in adulthood when I suddenly got serious social phobia and I suffer from that for the past five years which was one of the reasons of my depression. Things piled up and I isolated myself from society, I don‚Äôt want to be around people. It was building up for years."

relationship_advice,fdq3kyb,t3_emp70d,1578653180.0,"This is so wrong. You definitely should not go back to him because it will get worse and this is just the beginning. I‚Äôm sorry it happened to you and I know how being forced by your own boyfriend feels. He might try to apologise but he will do it again. Don‚Äôt go there alone to collect your things, go with a friend or someone you trust."
relationship_advice,fdq33oa,t3_emp3u7,1578652498.0,"Some people are squeamish and you should not  demand sex from him during your period if he is not comfortable with it. You can use a female condom if you really want sex during period and he agrees to try it. But in my opinion,  you should not push it because it is clear that he is uncomfortable with it. Your period lasts just few days and sex could wait."
OCD,fdpvwba,t1_fdoxuqo,1578642678.0,I had compulsions related to God too.  I used to pray even during classes at school (I was 7) because I would always get those disturbing thoughts. I still have the problem with praying. Whenever I pray I get the worst obsessive thoughts which makes it hard to pray and feels like a torture because I feel like punishing myself for having those thoughts during praying.
relationship_advice,fdpvaye,t3_emkm7y,1578641958.0,"You know it sounds like he got this idea from someone when he was a child. Maybe his mother, grandmother or sister caught him touching himself and said that only gay men do that. I feel like someone said something (I don‚Äôt know who ?)  which made him believe that. He needs to see a therapist because this is an issue from hygienic point of view and it affects the quality of his life and relationships."
relationship_advice,fdol5zw,t3_emg12f,1578607365.0,"You sound like my ex. You had to appreciate her while she was still with you. She probably realised that if you feel she has to change for you , that means you don‚Äôt really love her just the way she is. So why be with someone if you are not the way he wants you to be? No one is perfect and you should not have created a perfect version of her in your head. Real her did not match with the perfect version of her and you waited for her to change to ‚Äúdeserve the ring‚Äù . Someone else loves her for HER and that‚Äôs what she wanted all these three years from you."
AvakinOfficial,fdo6x7e,t3_emeypb,1578599947.0,Well you are being ignorant. You are not there to talk to people. You are are there to harvest likes and views to pet your own ego.
relationship_advice,fdnhz8s,t3_embkt8,1578586200.0,The best thing to do is to take her to a child psychologist. If your elder daughter was not violent and did not have mood swings it does not have to be the same with this daughter. Everyone is different during their puberty because of hormones. Maybe she has some problems with peers at school and can‚Äôt share those things with you so she gets aggressive at home. A child psychologist will help you to understand what exactly is going on.
depression,fdnfqv7,t3_emaov3,1578584851.0,"Sometimes I feel the same. I feel guilt , shame and hatred to myself. I think you feel guilty for being this way and it makes you think you don‚Äôt deserve anything and people around you deserve someone better (I have those thoughts)."
insomnia,fdlkxjp,t3_elul4j,1578526348.0,I suffer from night tremors (my whole body is shaking) which wakes me up when I am falling asleep or during sleep. Sometimes I have hallucinations like you but they are  rare. The scariest was when I woke up from a very loud funeral ceremony music and I looked out from my balcony there was nothing going on in the street but I could still  hear the funeral music. Then I realised there is no funeral and there is no music it was all in my head.

I wish parents would care about our happiness more than what is right and wrong. Maybe try talking to him and say how much you love him but you are who you are and you can‚Äôt change. You love that person and you will be unhappy without your fianc√©. I don‚Äôt know how close you are but try to talk heart to heart. But again , I‚Äôm not the one to give the advice because I don‚Äôt know what to do in my own situation."
depression,fdi0gpq,t3_elbx3m,1578433527.0,It hit right in the feels. My therapist is the only person I share things with. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm gonna do when she retires. I‚Äôve known mine since 2013. It‚Äôs so hard to find the right therapist. I‚Äôm sorry.
comingout,fdh0pbz,t1_fdgy8it,1578412831.0,"Thank you for your comment. There are no communities like that in my city but I feel like I found a ‚Äúsafe place‚Äù on Reddit. My girlfriend has been a lesbian all her life but she never openly came out even though her relatives and friends know about it cause it‚Äôs obvious (she is not from my country). She said she is finally ready to officially come out  and introduce me to her family as her girlfriend. I read your post about you and your girlfriend. It was heart -breaking to read . The line where you are worried about her parents‚Äô well being got me right in the feels. I‚Äôm scared of their reaction, I don‚Äôt want to shock them and cause any trouble. But the constant feeling of guilt and despair makes my depression worse and I think about suicide more often lately. Hope it gets better for you and your girlfriend."

He would always say something very bad and hurtful during arguments and few minutes later he would say he never said that ( I made it up / I‚Äôm too sensitive and got it wrong). During the last big argument he said I‚Äôm a miserable sad person (I suffer from depression, anxiety, ocd, cyclothymia) and after few minutes he said he never said that, I came across  one article about gaslighting and I realised he was doing it all throughout our relationship. Once on my birthday he said I‚Äôm mentally and physically unhealthy so he has to think hard before marrying me (very hurtful words) , then he said I said those words about myself ! And you know what ? I would start thinking that I might have said that! He would always make me question myself and my sanity. He would make me believe he did not say those things. But after our last big argument and my nervous break down, I realised that I‚Äôm not delusional. He was gas lighting me for years. I‚Äôm sorry you experienced that, I know how it feels."
