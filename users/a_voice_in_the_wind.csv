AskFeminists,ff3ac44,t3_er6wkk,1579537321.0,"I agree with lots of responses above, that say it really depends on how it was done.  We can all tell when it feels like a line has been crossed  . What I've done in the padtb, ifI feel the line has been crossed, and FEEL SAFE (daytime, busy street, perhaps walking past a construction site.  especially if other workers are there) the first thing I do is take my the phone out and start dialing a ” friend”,  as the phone starts ringing, and. I'm still walking , I’ve said  back “ I can walk away from you, but you can’t walk away from yourself... Pity”   I'm now cossing the street, Then and start talking to my friend  (whether they pick up the phone or not). Just to give a signal that someone is on the other side of the line.   My experience  in the past has been ... they look really shocked, by the time they come to themselves, I’m already down the street on the other side, especially others are there to “ribbing them “. Yes, it's kina.risky, but I just can’t abide by NOT saying something."

relationships,fewno5h,t3_eqpwjr,1579415982.0,"I would seriously consider going to a therapist.  For several reasons 1. They will be a witness to what’s going on  2. They’ll give you tools to cope as your working your way out of this. 3. Will help you figure out why you would stay and take this .   I really hope you do it.  If it’s s money thing. You might be  able to to find a theripst that takes sliding scale .  I’d also ask your wife to go to couples Thearpy , not because your going to stay. But for a professional to tell her to put a mirror to her while your making a your plan to go. Good luck"

olderlesbians,fdxjj6u,t3_emyyij,1578769321.0,"Thanks for sharing.  I  just realized, my original post never made it up.  I’m on my way out and have write this really quickly, so excuse any mistakes.  

My younger self would have thought I was a “traitor” .   I realized I was “gay” in 1978 when I saw a documentary called “ word is out” on “pbs”  during the doc, they had  3 or 4 names /addresses and phone number’s  running across the bottom of the screen of early gay organizations (one of which was “gay youth” ).  Long story short, I got in a bus to  manhattan the next sat and found my way to the “ gay youth meeting” i found my “tribe” and in short period of time, I became a “gay activist”  ( there was no bi, trans, queer terminology at that time)  and worked with the “Christopher street liberation committee” ( now “pride parade “).  Little  by little my interest moved in the direction of my  “ true tribe : wink: my lesbian “sisters”. I learned more about the “Herstory” of  my “Amazonian sisters” I was turning into a baby Amazonian myself and began to call myself a “Lesbian Feminist  Separatist”.  It became my mission to take down the”“patriarchy”.  and spent every waking hour doing so : laughs:  until I stared college, and of course made sure to created a chapter of lesbian feminist liberation “LFL” there.  I continued to spent my evening’s and weekends marching, plastering posters, and railing against the “MAN” with other “womyn”, until Tuesday night in April my 3rd year of college,  I received a call from one of the “boys” from gay youth.  Although I hadn’t spoken with him in 4 years, he asked me to come over because he had been sick, and “needed help”.  He had come out to his family years before, and they turned their backs on him, so he couldn’t call them” .   He asked if I’d help him. of course I said I would. I had no way of knowing he would die 6 weeks later.  As I was reeling from that experience, I got another call from a second friend from “gy” he also became sick, and continued to get worse until he too passed away quite quickly as well.  I remember how conflicted and confused I was, but had no time to deal with any of those emotions (and didn’t for several years) Because as so many gay boys from gy and from the “ the Christopher street committee” where sick and dying .  There where whispers of this new new disease they stared eventually calling GRID  (gay related immune deficiency) which then was understood to be the AIDS epidemic, and that had become my new world .  I took the same earlier anger about “men “in general, to the “MAN” that was letting my “brother”die by not putting any time or money into AIDS Research.  I became active in ACT-UP when I wasn’t hospital’s feeding and caring for the boys that where not being cared for in the hospital’s 
(staff was to afraid to come into rooms and  feed/change them).  Needless to say, those where difficult years and I was a very angry in my younger years.  But eventually the anger turned into spiritual questioning as so many of my young friends had died .  Which took me into my next phase of life .  There have been  many twists and turns that brought me here today, 42 years later,  I now have a job working for the “Man”, who pays me well, and happens to be an evolved, sympathetic, and kind human beingI live the Midwest ( never knew anything about the Midwest ( except what I saw in old movies), in a house with a white pickett fence with the love of my life and my 2 dogs.  Although the spelling of the name, and  I have changed, my love for “women” has not."
