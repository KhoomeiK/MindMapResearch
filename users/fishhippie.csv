However, myself and my sister have found that chiropractors (EDS knowledgable ones only) are the best first line of defense because they're cheaper, nicer and quicker than an ER and can do pretty much everything an ER would do regarding that anyway. So I've done that a lot."
service_dogs,fe42n34,t1_fe0c328,1578855155.0,"A SD should not suffer from separation anxiety. If they do then proper training needs to be done on that area. 
I dont have a cue or anything but I put him in his crate with a super high value treat that he doesnt get anywhere else. Ex: empty peanut butter jar to lick, a big done bone or special antler, a Kong toy."
service_dogs,fdx9y71,t1_fdx949s,1578766776.0,"Exactly, I dont take mine to the ER or Cardiologist Tests because of all the tests and such hes constantly trying to alert and it's too much hahah"
dogswithjobs,fdfc9bm,t1_fdepm24,1578358290.0,Right?! Sometimes hes literally a black hole and sometimes he looks chocolate! I kind of love it
dogswithjobs,fdeb6d6,t1_fde16db,1578335194.0,Done and done
dogswithjobs,fdeb1di,t1_fde1afi,1578335107.0,Halti brand!
dogswithjobs,fddorp2,t1_fdcxr8p,1578319823.0,Yep just a gentle leader. Pulls his head away from distractions instead of his neck. It was a vital tool when he was first getting used to going out with me
AskReddit,fcmcy9s,t3_ehtq3g,1577770880.0,My family collects Christmas ornaments! We have one from every major city any of us have visited as well as really special ones like a lightbulb from the first theater in Kansas and a preserved tulip bulb from Amsterdam.
ehlersdanlos,fciq0x1,t1_fcifv3h,1577667092.0,So much this. The eternal struggle between low pain and high pots vs high pain and lower pots.
service_dogs,fbyeevv,t1_fbydli9,1577214814.0,What does this have to do with recall? Her dog isnt running away and not listening. The off leash heel just isnt as tight as she wants it.
service_dogs,fby7pb6,t1_fby2j3r,1577210108.0,"Not looking in the right area? I'm looking where I live which is not in a big city so my options are limited. I was lucky enough to have a program dog and I just train with him to keep his mind active and commands sharp even though hes already fully trained. 

You're making generalizations that arent fair to the teams that work incredibly hard and have amazing dogs. Like I said, trainers can be very helpful to have and use but not everyone needs one for every little thing. There are plenty of owner trained dogs that are better than half the dogs I've seen go through pto trainers. 

OP just had one question on how to keep their dog from slightly wandering off leash occasionally and you just immediately suggested a trainer for it when it may not be necessary at all."
service_dogs,fby10hm,t1_fby0o6j,1577205494.0,"Well that's very lucky then because most trainers willing to work with service dog teams around the states I live in are multiple hundreds. You dont have to work with a trainer to be a real team, a good team, or a ""real"" handler. Plenty of amazing teams are completely owner trained. I agree trainers can be helpful but they're not always necessary."
LifeProTips,fby0jbn,t3_eevtso,1577205167.0,"We had this when we were kids. Could text ""we should have tacos tomorrow night"" to anyone in the family with a car and I'd be picked up or called to get out of situation."
service_dogs,fby0ddi,t3_eetv3i,1577205053.0,"Thin leads (sometimes called step leads I think) are helpful. They're super thin and lightweight so the dog isnt fully aware it's on. When she wanders just tug and correct either via clicker or vocal cue to keep her in a heel. One person said this too I think but keep their attention by changing speeds and defections or asking her to watch you (eyes, focus, watch, whatever your command is) that ways shes focused on you and not just walking aimlessly."

service_dogs,fby04vm,t1_fbxzhe8,1577204890.0,Dude what the heck chill. You can have plenty of money in the bank to take care of yourself and your dog but sometimes a $300+ trainer isnt a smart option monetarily for just one or two things that need tweaking. OP came for help not to be told their a bad handler just because the cost cant be validated.
service_dogs,fbxzcpp,t3_eevu4e,1577204352.0,It's been said before but I have a lab service dog. We live in a very tiny one bedroom apartment and he loves it. Hes mobility assistance so being close by all the time is nice. Hes got lots of energy but is also super content to just sleep all day long. Very motivated to work etc because of his breed. They're loyal goofballs. Get one ;p
service_dogs,fbut5q7,t3_eekslz,1577119960.0,My boy does this occasionally as well. I've started tucking him to the opposite side of wherever the waiter will be to avoid this. Purposefully putting that barrier for some outings has decreased how often he does it if we are unable to tuck away from them
dogswithjobs,fbqbiak,t1_fbq3966,1577030117.0,"Still not understanding where this ""certification"" has to come from though because colleges legally cannot ask for it per the ADA. They can ask for medical records, bite history, etc. And ask what kind of service dog he is (PSD, Mobility Assistance, Autism, Anxiety Response, Medical Alert, etc) but they can't require certification of any kind in the USA. 

Still super happy you got your bud to stick with you though OP. What a cutie."
