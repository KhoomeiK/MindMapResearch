AskReddit,fdrgi1o,t1_fdr9p8o,1578684141.0,"I've been in that situation but from the employees side. I was working at a firehouse subs shop and this maybe 16 year old kid came in drenched in sweat. I thought it was because it was early summer, this kid looked like he had went skinny dipping and put his clothes on without a single thought about a towel. His friend sat and waited, I offered a glass of water, and about 10 minutes later I notice they both leave in a rush. I go to use the bathroom and shit is on the toilet seat, the tank, the wall, the toilet paper and the floor. He must have pulled his pants half way down and exploded on our bathroom. Yours truly got to spend an hour making the bathroom presentable again."
aww,fdeffgj,t1_fdef6jd,1578337852.0,"just like a dog wagging it's tail means it's always happen, do some research before you try to make assumptions on the internet."
aww,fdeeqns,t1_fdee2dw,1578337422.0,"That actually is a defensive stance and how they got the nickname sugar bears, but guess when else they do this exact behavior. Feeding time, play time, when they're ready to jump onto something pretty much anytime they want. But guess what it's not doing, swiping, bearing it's teeth, backing away, crabbing, or even biting. Sugar gliders jumping on the backs of other animals like dogs and cats is super common especially if they're being raised together."
aww,fdedqtm,t1_fdecglf,1578336800.0,"If I ever have a question about a day gecko, crested gecko or snakes I'll defer you because I would assume you, as someone who successfully raised them, would know the answer. That's how the world works, when you have experience in something you are the one people defer to. 

No one said they ""can't be preyed on by anything"" it's just a fact that that sugar glider at no point in that gif bit that kitten or even showed aggression. Jumping on another animals back is a very common thing sugar gliders do especially at that age since that sugar glider is obvious only a few months out of pouch. What you saw is it nuzzling not biting.

Really going to stoop to going after anime in 2020? Going to have to do way better than that friend."
aww,fdebza0,t1_fdebeux,1578335699.0,"All im hearing is I'm an immature kid who thinks I know things about the world because i judge things based off of my emotions, instead of learning from people who actually have spent the time to do the proper research. But that's just my high horse talking or something. I pray that one day you grow into someone your parents can finally be proud of."
aww,fdeatpj,t1_fddhwbo,1578334975.0,"Sugar gliders not only jump at people's faces all the time, they also have really good aim. Mine jumps from my vr sensor, around 7ft in the air, directly onto my head all the time and I have the scratches to prove it."
aww,fdea680,t1_fde9fi1,1578334561.0,"No, I'm better than you because I own 2 sugar gliders and have done extensive research to make sure I'm able to take care of them properly. I'm not some random person who has no experience with an animal trying to act like i know what their behavior means. I own 2 exotic animals, a pure breed dog, and a specialty breed of rabbit. Ive sat through hours with all of them reading about their specific needs/health issues, preparing their specific diets, and talking with my vet to make sure they're all happy and heathy while you sit here making assumptions about an animal you've probably never handled."

aww,fddyp2z,t1_fddy9fw,1578327190.0,"Right, cause i didn't do my research before owning a Flemish giant rabbit, a dog, and 2 sugar gliders. Sugar gliders are great with other pets."
aww,fddtj9r,t1_fddtc4b,1578323600.0,"No, my dog and my sugar gliders live together and i wouldn't let them climb on his back if i thought there was any chance any of them would hurt each other. You have no knowledge of sugar gliders or cats."
aww,fddt2k1,t1_fddml3g,1578323264.0,"You obviously don't own a sugar glider, if that sugar glider was biting that kitten there's no way it would've just kept walking. My sugar gliders have bitten me hard enough to draw blood, and those were warning bites. Their bottom teeth are basically needles. Yes that stance at the beginning was a defensive stance, but that's super common when anything comes close to them and is how they got the nickname sugar bears. Sugar gliders are actually usually really good with other animals and mine have ridden on my dog's back the exact same way."
aww,fddsc4r,t1_fdda04p,1578322713.0,"Probably not honestly, I've personally seen my own sugar gliders do that exact thing to my dog (who was not very happy about the free ride) and to me. I have scratches all over from my sugar gliders deciding my face looks like a great landing pad."
