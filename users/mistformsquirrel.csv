HumansAreMetal,ff4ov7m,t1_ff3i6c6,1579568874.0,Don't forget the slave labor.  Making people you are oppressing build your stuff seems like a recipe for those people finding ways to fuck up said stuff in a variety of creative manners.  Which is what happened.

Transmogrification,ff3al9d,t1_ff36uqu,1579537462.0,"Yeah, that's how I came across this idea, odd as it is.  My usual gnomish power armor doesn't work well on mechagnomes at all, sadly."

Hey all, been awhile!

Really loving both the Crucible Prestige shader and the Righteous armor set this season.  Figured I'd show off my current look!  I sometimes rock the Empyrean Cartographer shoulder ornament instead, but they are remarkably hard to match in terms of shader compared to the rest of things."
