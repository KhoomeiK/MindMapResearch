AskReddit,ffaowov,t3_esi1iu,1579741050.0,"I worked at Fanny May in a mall before the bankruptcy/takeover. Highlights:

-Only one person was ever on shift because a busy night was three people in three hours.

-I started closing the store on my own on my fifth day working. I had never had a retail job of any kind before. I was having trouble closing the register and it was always off, even if I didn’t sell anything. Turned out it was day shift stealing. They were fired but not prosecuted.  

-Stealing money was bad but it was all you can eat during your shift, and you could come in and take up to a pound any other day even if you weren’t working. This was not corporate policy, just the manager’s rules.

-This worked because there was no inventory taken, ever, nor was there a formal ordering process of any kind. Corporate just sent us candy when they felt like it. The tiny back room was overflowing with candy that would never be eaten as we didn’t have enough customers to sell it to nor enough employees to eat it.

-To get rid of some candy the manager encouraged us to make trades with other stores. I scored three of us haircuts and dye jobs at the hairdresser on the second floor for about 10 pounds of expired mint meltaways.

-Expiration dates for products, when present, were so heavily coded that we needed the store manual handy to decode them. The predictable result was that nothing was ever rotated. 

-My frenemey’s boyfriend came in one night with some mutual friends and I told him that my frenemy really liked Swedish fish, so he should take the 1.5 pound tin of it from the display gratis. I had to dust it off while I was bagging it. It was an ongoing store joke that those gummies had been there since the store was opened five years before. This was almost true. The next day my frenemy bragged about her sweet boyfriend and the delicious (three year old) Swedish fish.

-My personal limit for eating overpriced free candy in a day is two pounds and change. It was a terrible breakup and no I’m not sorry."

You are already late filing estimated taxes for fourth quarter 2019, but if you owe them you should pay when you can and make a catch up when you file your yearly taxes. The penalties for ignoring these taxes can literally bankrupt you.

If you’re confused by any of this, hire a CPA.
