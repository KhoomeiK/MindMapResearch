On this land they built a country home known as Colborne Lodge. The Howards’ property became the basis of High Park when they deeded most of it to the city in 1873. The generous gift came with some strings:

*     The park must be kept in a natural state
*     It must be for the free use, benefit and enjoyment of all citizens
*     Drinking alcohol must not be allowed in the park
*     The name must remain “High Park”
*     John and Jemima would receive $1200 a year and would live in High Park at Colborne Lodge on a private parcel of 45 acres. Upon the death of one, the other would receive an annual pension of $1200
