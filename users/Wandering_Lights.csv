I went to family celebration and all they had were fake meats/meat substitutes-veggie burgers, weird not hotdog things, horrible ""chicken"" nugget things and some small things to snack on.

Paella, Pinto Posole? What the heck is that? I guess I am going to be going to google and hope I pick one that I actually like. 

Also please don't try and just serve fake meats. Most of the time fake meat is really gross and as someone who regularly eats meat if I am eating a burger I want a real burger not a veggie burger. This is just a personal thing. I am really weird about foods that are meat replacements. I would much rather just have pasta and veggies that I wouldn't expect to have meat in them."

*Before humans die, they write their last will and testament, giving their home and all they have to those they leave behind. If, with my paws, I could do the same, this is what I’d ask…*

*To a poor and lonely stray, I’d give my happy home; my bowl and cozy bed, soft pillow and all my toys; the lap, which I loved so much; the hand that stroked my fur; and the sweet voice that spoke my name.*

*I’d will to the sad, scared, shelter dog the place I had in my human’s loving heart, of which there seemed no bounds.*

*So, when I die, please do not say, “I will never have a pet again, for the loss and the pain is more than I can stand.”*

*Instead, go find an unloved dog, one whose life has held no joy or hope, and give my place to him.*

*This is the only thing I can give…*

*The love I left behind.*

dogs,fd61ys2,t3_ek4ztv,1578184427.0,"For an older dog watch how the interact with everyone. Are they super friendly, but to the point where they are jumping on people? See how they walk on the leash. If they no any commands watch how closely they watch you for the next command. As far a temperament pick up their feet, touch their ears, see how they are about their tail being touched. 

Unfortunately/fortunately the dog you get from the shelter might not be the same dog you end up with at home. We adopted a very timid dog that blossomed into a much bolder dog who loves strangers."
weddingplanning,fd01uw6,t3_ejqxkv,1578112402.0,"We had a small engagement party. It was us, a couple close friends, cake, and a night at a board game bar. 

Bachelorette party- I might do something small with a couple friends. We aren't having a wedding party so I would be planning it myself. 

Bridal shower- probably not. I don't think anyone will throw one. 

Rehearsal Dinner- Nope. Our families will get together for dinner the night before, but we won't be rehearsing anything again no wedding party and I am confident I know how to walk haha."
weddingplanning,fczrn5s,t3_ejplxp,1578107451.0,"How do you work out a timeline for the day of. I am really struggling with this. Our venue, which we are having the ceremony and reception gives us 12 hours inclusive of load in/out and no later than 11pm. Music needs to be off by 10 pm which is how late we would like the reception to go. 

Is starting the ceremony at 2 too early? We are only planning a short one no more than 30 minutes. I am just worried about the day being too long for the guests."
personalfinance,fczdbt8,t3_ejo25m,1578098654.0,Most dealers will take a personal check. You could also more then likely put a deposit to hold the car while you run to the bank and get a cashier's check for the amount you negotiate.
dogs,fcz560g,t3_ej93p4,1578093882.0,You can rest easy knowing that you gave Honey an awesome last few weeks. Any dog would be lucky to spend their last bit of time in a loving and comfortable home.
askcarsales,fcoqiqt,t3_ei5arb,1577838874.0,End of year. An out of state buyer communicating through email/phone is low on the priority list. Dealers are crazy busy with people physically at the dealer ready to buy that day.
careerguidance,fcoph4e,t3_ei1vdq,1577838111.0,"Just cover it and depending on how conservative the firm is don't bring it up. 

I work in the financial industry and have several tattoos. They are always covered when I am at work. I have had some older managers  raise their eyebrows when the topic of tattoos come up."
weddingplanning,fcoozgl,t3_ei4tx7,1577837750.0,"I am not very close with my family and I don't really have friends. 

I am not doing a bridal shower. FH and I live together already so we don't need a party just to get stuff. 

We are not having a wedding party. I am also not planning on a bachelorette party. 

I have also been dress shopping by myself and it has been really nice and a lot less stressful."
weddingplanning,fcoohrk,t3_ei80kl,1577837393.0,"Take the date you want especially if the date means that much to you. My FH and I are getting married 9/12/20 and is brother is getting married 10/3/20. We have been been dating longer and got engaged first. I didn't care if they did the wedding before us or not as long as they didn't take the date we set. 

Over a month apart is fine. Just don't ""steal"" her colors and other ideas."
askcarsales,fcltexi,t3_ehsc8y,1577756025.0,You got impatient. Its the end of the month and end of the year dealers are busy and people are taking time off. You should have given them longer than 6 hours. Now that you have called asking dealer B about the truck there is a snowball's chance in hell they will trade it Dealer A.
dogs,fcj71i4,t3_ehggi8,1577678866.0,"I wasn't there to say good bye to my buddy. He past at the emergency vets office without me. I took him in due to pneumonia and they advised me to head home and come back to visit later that day after some treatments. He was expected to be in the hospital a few days. 

I checked him in around 1pm I got a call around 7pm saying it wasn't looking good. I jumped into my car to make it over there and he passed before I got 10 minutes down the road. 

They brought his body into a room for me and I cried and hugged him for awhile. They gave me a clay impression of his pawprint. They also helped me get an ink print of it which I used to get a tattoo so he is always with me. We took him home let our cats see that we had passed and buried him in the back yard.  

I was a mess for awhile. He was only 10 and was still so healthy. He had also been my best friend through some of the hardest years of my life including some medical issues. He passed on a Friday. I laid on the couch crying and sleeping for the entire weekend. 

Healing was a long process. For months I would just burst into tears. Even now, almost 4 years later I will have days that I miss him so much."
weddingplanning,fcj5pan,t3_egjnbp,1577677908.0,Nope. We only looked at one venue and ended up booking it. The other venues I was finding that I really liked the look of were too expensive and the ones that were cheaper I didn't like the look of or they were really bad at communication.
weddingplanning,fcj4ibe,t3_eh1sqe,1577677076.0,"Our Anniversary is April 25th, which is a Saturday in 2020, but I have some health issues that flare up more in the Spring. I also really wanted a Fall wedding since I love the look of fall stuff. I was open to Mid-August through Mid-October. I work in accounting so end of month/beginning of month were out. I was leaning more towards October, but we had two friends book in October and our wedding would have been between them, so we found the venue we wanted and booked for that they had which September 12th."
weddingplanning,fcj3c96,t3_eh5fex,1577676238.0,Small weddings can be really fun. The most fun wedding I have been to only had about 60 people. Plus as long as the weddings aren't on the same day people would still be able to make both.
weddingplanning,fcj32az,t3_eh94a9,1577676040.0,I don't have it narrowed down too far yet but I am planning on doing a more heavy rock type song. My dad and I aren't close so the typical slow songs aren't for us.
weddingplanning,fcj27cr,t3_ehdomn,1577675437.0,"I got really bad nerves as a kid when I was showing horses to the point I would throw up. I know I am going to have the same issues on my wedding day too so I am making a plan. 

Decompress time- Once the hair/make up/everything is done before the ceremony I am kicking EVERYONE out of my getting ready room for 5 to 10 minutes to just relax and focus. I might have a couple of my favorite songs playing too just to help take my mind off things. 

Make sure to eat something. I suggest something more plain. Anxiety and an empty stomach are not a good combination. 

Chew on some mint leaves or some mint gum. Do this leading up to the wedding while doing relaxing exercises. Eventually your brain will connect the mint to relaxing. 

Focus on your FH as you walk down the aisle. It will make you feel less self conscious.

Finally right before walking into the ceremony space take a deep breath, hold it for a moment, and let it out with some force maybe give your arms a shake too if it won't mess anything up. This is my favorite thing to do before walking in the ring. It really helps me settle and forget that I want to throw up."
Equestrian,fcj0px9,t3_ehfody,1577674395.0,"I would just watch it for a few days for heat/swelling. Maybe a few days stall rest then turn out in a small paddock if you have one. 

Think of it this way if you hadn't seen the fall in the field would you even be considering calling the vet? Most of the time when a horse comes in from the field lame we just chalk it up to doing something dumb to themselves and they will be fine in a few days."
dogs,fciykpz,t3_ehfifl,1577672925.0,"It could have been abuse or an over crowding situation. However, since there is no proof of abuse you would have a hard time with any legal action. Plus since you dog the dog from a shelter how would you even go about finding the previous owners?

I would maybe get professional help regarding the resource guarding. That can get bad quick and lead to accidental bites. 

With the eating so fast she vomits I would get her a slow feeder bowl.

The other things will just take time and trust building."
weddingplanning,fc49rup,t3_eg36l1,1577410496.0,"My dad was raised Catholic and my FH is very Catholic. We on the other hand are not religious at all. Some of his family is disappointed we aren't getting married in a church or doing a religious ceremony. My dad was thrilled. He always says the only thing worse that a Catholic wedding is a catholic funeral. 

Also, I tend to think Catholic ceremonies are really uncomfortable for non-Catholics. They are so long and if you are unfamiliar with the religion it is very easy to get lost on what is going on when you need to sit/kneel/stand, the responses to the prayers, the pews are uncomfortable, churches are normally really hot, incense smells horrid."
weddingplanning,fc1aix5,t3_efdm2v,1577312981.0,I've gone once by myself and I am dreading the thought of taking my mother and FMIL with me. It is so boring. I feel like I should care a lot more than I do.
askcarsales,fbzad0q,t3_ef6sz7,1577240119.0,"Honest mistake that happens more than you would think especially if your state/county had recently changed their sales tax. 

If you wouldn't have caught it the title clerk or the clerk of courts would have caught it and the dealer would refund you the money."
dogs,fbwo9xu,t3_eekrbw,1577155102.0,Two 7 hour trips shouldn't be too bad. I pretty regularly take my dogs home to visit my parents. It is a 5 hour drive and they are fine. After the first 10 or so minutes the settle right in and sleep most of the way.
weddingplanning,fbwmpm1,t3_eeo402,1577153976.0,"So the cousin picked a date the week before your sister's wedding not the date you sister picked? In that case its no big deal. People that want to will be able to attend both. Ignore the cousin and go about planning. Frankly, the cousin sounds like a mess and I would not be surprised if she doesn't get around to planning/having the wedding. 

People like your cousin feed off drama. The best thing to do is ignore them and not let them get to you."
dogs,fbwk8ew,t3_eeo6j0,1577152127.0,"When he tries to nip at them discourage him and redirect him. Watch some videos on dog behavior so you can learn the signs to watch for that the dog is ready to get snappy. 

Don't let the dogs and cats be around each other when you aren't home.

You can also let the cat hiss and swat and see what happens. Hopeful Otto will realize ""oh the cat doesn't like that and is telling me to stop"" and will learn to leave them alone. Be ready to step in quickly if it escalates. 

I have had cats and dogs together most of my life and very very rarely have I had any issues. The few minor issues have been slight misunderstanding with some noise but no blood drawn and they sort it out pretty quickly.

Also I know several people that have  Dachshunds and cats and have never had any issues. Not all hunting breeds are bad with cats especially scent-hounds which is what a Dachshund is."
