ACPocketCamp,fffikif,t1_fffhjzn,1579884732.0,Thank you so much! Me too!
fatlogic,ffcuab8,t1_ffaxy3o,1579807396.0,"What sort of gets me is that these are the same people who say be mindful of invisible illnesses. Which like, of course we should be - so did she just assume that this thin person is laying down because they're inconsiderate and not because she has some invisible chronic illness?"

xxfitness,ff80f5l,t3_es5x06,1579662751.0,I feel you! I broke my foot on Sunday night at the gym and I just want to work out.
DecidingToBeBetter,ff7z03l,t3_es5pga,1579661740.0,It could be so many things! Are you depressed? What‚Äôs your nutrition like? Do you sleep well? Have you ever told a doctor?
ACPocketCamp,ff7n0st,t3_eno3d1,1579653447.0,"I have one too, if you want it!"
ACPocketCamp,ff5wmc2,t1_ff5k8bz,1579612706.0,"I love knowing there are other people out there who like Animal Crossing, Arrested Development, and Nirvana."
Death_By_SnuSnu,ff4t4ln,t1_ff470oj,1579571813.0,"Have you considered that NSFW is a catch-all term for anything you may not want the people surrounding you to see? For instance, I‚Äôm in the emergency room right now. Nothing to do with work. I‚Äôd like to scroll through my Reddit but would rather not flash a pussy to everyone around me."
AmItheAsshole,ff4lsih,t3_ermj3a,1579566704.0,"NTA. I almost don‚Äôt believe this is real. I know free bleeding is a thing, but I have a hard time believing someone would do it at a gym. Blood borne illnesses are a thing."

fatlogic,fev59mf,t1_fev3qtr,1579393257.0,Same.
fatlogic,ferouwz,t1_feqke6m,1579356636.0,"Not everyone has problems with alcohol, it‚Äôs true, but like someone commented it‚Äôs not recommended you start drinking in any capacity if you don‚Äôt already. The negative effects have been proven to outweigh any health benefits thought to have been gained. ‚ÄúPartying‚Äù on the other hand, to me, seems to be sort of synonymous than drinking your more than 4 drinks in a night and perhaps doing drugs. To each their own, though."
fatlogic,fermugd,t1_fepu688,1579355918.0,I‚Äôm a recovering problem drinker too. I‚Äôve been free of binge drinking since July and I have no desire to return to that. It‚Äôs really not worth it! It fucks with every part of you. I could be depressed/feeling ill for an entire week after a binge and then do it all over again that weekend. So stupid.
DecidingToBeBetter,fepohc6,t1_fepmx9p,1579326091.0,You‚Äôre a douche

AntiVegan,fdlhou2,t1_fdlh7qh,1578524247.0,"No, I agree. It was obviously a joke because stopping people from going where they want to go is fundamentally wrong (and illegal). But processed food is disgusting and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anyone eat it if they have the choice."
AntiVegan,fdlewpl,t1_fdleupb,1578522544.0,"By not letting him eat poison. But it was a joke, clearly."
AntiVegan,fdkfc3t,t3_elsg8f,1578502671.0,It‚Äôs pretty fucked up but honestly they‚Äôre kinda doing you a favour.

holdmyfries,fdejsyr,t1_fdejoz3,1578340532.0,And nice calves.
raisedbynarcissists,fddy4a7,t3_ejyrgy,1578326795.0,"My family is in law enforcement too and quite respected in our small community, so I don‚Äôt think many people suspected how bad things were at home. 

Have you ever tried speaking to a professional about this? I wish I had something better to say but I found therapy really helped me cope with my childhood and I hate see you consider suicide, especially after seeing you in r/momforaminute. You‚Äôre a good person, OP."
fatlogic,fcut5p5,t1_fcuk1so,1577987996.0,I feel like we could definitely find middle ground on this topic. It‚Äôs obviously a bit of both - I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs so black and white.
fatlogic,fcugcrt,t1_fcufyzi,1577980301.0,"Yep. It just bothers me because when you live in one of these communities and see people you care about having limbs amputated etc, it‚Äôs hard to just accept fatness. I accept and love a lot of fat people but I don‚Äôt want to accept that this is just the way it goes and this is totally normal and natural. The food we‚Äôre eating is hurting us."
fatlogic,fcubar9,t3_eiy3y2,1577976968.0,"What bothers me is just the settling done by FA. Like yeah, obesity does effect some people more than others particularly along class lines, but why are we accepting that? Shouldn‚Äôt we be so fucking mad that these huge corporations with their literal taste scientists and psychologists are trying to get us ADDICTED to shitty food that kills us? Where is the anger about that?"
xxfitness,fcsoyyk,t3_einwk9,1577921453.0,"Sober since July after years of problem drinking. Biggest tip (even though many of you probably aren‚Äôt problem drinkers) would be to not place yourselves in situations where you normally drink. You should still see your friends, sure, but don‚Äôt go over on a Saturday night while they‚Äôre drinking and expect to a) remain sober or b) have a fun time. Instead ask them to hang out during the day, and throw in a hobby or interest. Also, sparkling water."
AntiVegan,fcrobgi,t3_eil9t1,1577904435.0,I‚Äôm also curious! This is a really interesting perspective. I wonder if Lierre Keith has ever touched on it?
