The reason I think it might be right is I cant think of any other reason for Michael's line about the test subjects not being aware, since the audience could assume that and the demons could be told off screen and it wasnt like part of a funny bit, unless its foreshadowing.q"

fatlogic,ff65nxw,t1_ff5pnqk,1579619729.0,"I had basically no strength when I started. Like I didnt work out at all. I had a little arm strength from lifting cases of wine, beer, liquor at my job since I took in all the orders, but I literally never worked out or anything before classes. Just make sure to take a level 1/beginner class. And it's crazy awesome to see your strength develop each week. Like I'd barely be able to do something and come in next class and have it down. You def build strength faster in the beginning, but as you level up to harder stuff you're def gonna want to add some ""homework"" aka strength excercises at home to build strength faster so you dont plateau as long. But honestly they literally advertise at my studio to not be afraid or worried about not having strength when you start, you will develop it if you stick with it. We even have a couple ppl with injuries and the instructor just asks when you join if you've had any injuries and she'll make modifications if shes teaching something that she thinks could make a past injury worse or act up."

At least for me it's easier to hold myself accountable when I'm around other ppl. At home I wont push myself as much on the less fun things that I need to build strength. I've started to solve that tho by having some of my sportier friends message me to make sure I do my sit ups twice a day.

I totally wouldnt mind a series about her following in her parents foot steps as a lawyer, while also embracing the mob side shes clearly going to grow up in now. Could even still use the kid actress for flashbacks to childhood showing how she became a ruthless mob lawyer. I'd much prefer that to a Tariq show tbh."
PowerTV,ff23qt1,t1_fezeawt,1579492986.0,"Like I said in another comment I'm surprised people want her acting more like a ""kid"", shes had a life where shes had to grow up fast. I honestly absolutely loved this episode. I watched it 3 times last night. Like yeah some things were ridic (like a huge shoot out like that in the city and no cops showing up), but I've come to expect that stuff from Power and I take it with a grain of salt. But the actual character interactions were amazing.

I'm sure I'll get downvoted but honestly I liked last episode too. Maybe its cuz I didnt realize it came back so I didnt have to wait, (no longer have Starz on cable so no DVR notification) but I watched the first 2 eps of the year Friday night and I actually really liked Paz episode. Maybe its cause I've experienced a lot of loss, but I really related to seeing Paz grieving and it destroying her because she couldnt let go."

But I'm kinda done with this cause it's really become a circle jerk of ""ethical makeup"" shoppers making excuses of why people who cant afford to do the same are such terribleeee people. I really hope ya'll give every homeless person you see a few bucks everytime you see them cause that 100% will do more good than not buying ""controversial brands"" on clearance.

I can recognize I'm being kind of a dick, but it's kinda hilarious how ya'll act just as dickish and are totally blind to it. Lmao."
Youniqueamua,fewk38z,t1_fevqjc7,1579412328.0,"I was having a normal convo with the original person I was talking to where we both understood where each other came from and then the second person came in basically saying ""I'm poor and I dont have to do that so you're wrong about your life experiences"". Like they literally said I'm broke and can still ethically source makeup so you can too. That's why their level of ""brokeness"" and life experiences even came in to play. Like someone can be broke and I suppose have time to research every single purchase they make, but that's not the usual experience. And tbh I think that's what's bothering me the most. Just the complete lack of understanding that peoples experiences are different and ppl somehow throwing that on me for pointing out the hypocrisy in the person I was responding to using their being broke as justification to make judgements on how all broke people should do their spending.

Plus also just how dumb it is that people are getting so upset about broke people not ""ethically sourcing"" their makeup. Like how many of you guys responding are vegetarians? I'm not but I recognize that not eating meat has a lot more positive impact than what brand of makeup someone buys. Theres just so many better ways to do good in the world than ""ethically sourcing"" makeup, so it seems kinda ridic how judgemental people are getting. Like that's cool if you have the time and money to do it, but theres plenty of other ways (and more effective ways) ppl do good in the world. So maybe ppl shouldnt be so judgemental tbh."
Youniqueamua,fewhw4d,t1_few4k9d,1579410870.0,"You do understand the extreme examples I gave were me right? Like when I was homeless I 100% found free ways to eat and would treat myself to things I didnt NEED, but wanted to cheer myself up about my shitty life. And honestly everything you're saying about me applies to yourself, you get that right? Like you literally said extreme poor people dont care about my makeup, like you speak for every poor person. And while it not might be makeup for everyone, poor people, yes even extremely poor people, still have non essential things they like and enjoy. Like when you're that poor theres things you need more than a $2 lipstick, but that $2 isnt really going to make the difference with the things you actually need or the debt you're in so I think it's okay to let poor people have small comforts and not judge them. And judging poor people for not ""ethically sourcing"" their makeup is a joke. Like if we can get to the point that we agree poor people are allowed to like and buy non essential items, no matter how poor they are, then it should be understood that to afford those small treats or hobbies they dont get as much of a choice in selection and also that its easier for poor people to buy an item here or there from a clearance section (which let's be real usually has a lot of controversial brands) than to save up and a buy an expensive full price item (tho both options are 100% completely acceptable)

Like honestly it's kinda a joke how many ppl on this thread are acting high mighty and about their makeup purchases, while also completely ignoring the fact that they're being the kind of people who police what poor people are allowed to buy and enjoy."

One more time for the people in the back. BEING POOR DOESNT MEAN YOU ARENT ALLOWED TO EVERY TREAT YOURSELF TO SOMETHING NICE.

Like I'm starting to guess you dont know any actual poor people. Cuz trust me poor people still buy makeup and yes you can get brand name makeup for the price of drug store or even cheaper by shopping clearance at bargain stores. Like getting $20 lipsticks for $2.

You guys can go on and on but tbh this whole judging poor people by their purchases thing is a total joke."
Youniqueamua,fevoaw8,t1_fevm735,1579399668.0,"She made it my business when shes using ""how broke"" she is to justify telling poor people what they shouldnt and shouldn't spend their money on. Especially when I guarantee everything she spends money on isnt ""ethical"". If you can afford 100% of your purchases to be ethical you ain't broke in any sense of the word.

And btw I dont think all the shit I've been through makes me better than anyone. But when someones gonna claim ""broke"" as an excuse to tell poor people what they're allowed to purchase I'm gonna point out that other people have had it worse and didnt have the luxury to just not work through it."
Youniqueamua,fevnr4x,t1_fevlr3f,1579399465.0,"Lol at doing exactly what you're claiming to be ""above"". 

But also did you even read their comment? And did you realize I was responding to two different people? The person I've been responding to essentially went ""I'm poor and no one poor needs to buy KVD because they could buy cheap lesser quality makeup for the same price you can get KVD at clearance stores"". They opened themselves up to the discussion of their traumas and broke level by telling people ""I'm poor and I can do it so you can too!"" which is bullshit. Like cool you're a broke college kid, and there's plenty of people who are so broke going to college isnt even on their radar. So yeah it's kinda annoying someone not realizing their privilege while telling poor people what they can and cant afford and how they should spend their money. ""Either by crap makeup or spend a little more and be 'ethical' or just dont by makeup at all since poor people dont deserve anything nice ever"""
Youniqueamua,fevl4rq,t1_fev9t3a,1579398712.0,"Wow missing the point huh? My entire point is that the original person has no right to judge other people for not being able to be choosy with what clearance rack items they by ""because they're broke too"" cause there will always be someone more broke.

Edit: And yes things are relative, and if someone chooses not to work because they're having a rough time in life I'm not judging them, but when that same person is gonna go on about ""how you should do better"" to other people with traumas who HAD to keep working right through it to not get kicked out of school or end up homeless you open yourself up to be judged. When someone says ""Im broke and can do it so you should too"" they open themselves up to be judged."
Youniqueamua,fevkrju,t1_fevf81k,1579398571.0,"And there we go to the ""poor people"" dont deserve nice things argument. If you can afford to shop ethically good on you, dont judge other people who cant.

Youniqueamua,fevcyw3,t1_fev9a9w,1579395900.0,"I'm sorry, but you're not gonna get a ton of pity from me. I was kidnapped, beat up and more my freshmen year of college and still kept working after the incident because I couldnt afford not to. And I'm not tryna play a game of whose got it worse Olympics, but just letting you to know that as bad as u think I have it, trust me someone as it worse and judging poor people for making ""conscious enough"" purchases is gross. And for a ""broke college kid"" I'm genuinely surprised you dont understand how bargain stores like TJ Maxx, Marshall's, Nordstram Rack, etc work... or apparently even read my og comment. Getting an entire pallete for $5-$10 is hella affordable. So is getting lipsticks from $2-$5. And when they actually last and you're not having to reapply 5x a day the product lasts longer. I'm just super over this whole line of thinking. And also if you have the luxury to keep going to college and choose to not work, you're not as broke as you think. Some of us dont have that choice to take a break after our traumas."

Also just wondering why you're earning less than $150 a week, do you choose to not work a full time job on top of college? Cuz that's what I had to do. I would literally kill to be the level of ""broke"" I was in college. I'm just kinda tired of the whole ""broke college"" kid way of relating because trust me theres a whole lot more broke than that. Like have you ever been homeless and slept outside? On food stamps? Waiting for the van at night to drop off blankets and soup? Do u know every place in ur area you can get a free meal? Have u signed up for like 20 free rewards cards just to get the free chips and salsa and ur friend get the free drink so u can split a meal?"
Floribama,ferp3mn,t1_fer6l99,1579356730.0,"I dont think you read my comment at all. I specifically said I'm not talking about all the north and no where did I say no families up north are close. But cost of living up here is definitely higher. And gentrification definitely a larger issue. My whole point was that family closeness isnt a north vs south thing, but more reliant on property values. Like I said I have a family that was super close, all the cousins ran the streets together and grew up together and even for us our family reunion gets smaller and smaller each year as people move farther away and instead of having dozens of second cousins my age close by, I have enough to maybe count on one hand. But its definitely a thing more common for rural areas, like my example of being from Mass. My friends who grew up in western mass definitely have more family gatherings like the one the Butts through than my friends who grew up in Boston and are trying to stay there while most of their families have sold the family home and moved away. And the fact is a lot of southern people stereotype the notth has ""city foke"" (sameway they get stereotyped as ""rural rednecks"") so it doesnt surprise me that Jeremiah would identify family gatherings as a southern thing because its really a rural thing (which most ppl dont think of the north as rural despite having some rural areas)."
tacobell,feptumu,t1_feozs1d,1579331084.0,"I absolutely love cinnamon twists, but my local taco bell must not change the oil enough cause 75% of the time theyd taste like rancid chemicals. I had to stop getting them cuz it wasnt worth it the risk."
Youniqueamua,fepqur3,t1_fepfz41,1579328221.0,I'm gonna be real a.) When I'm getting an almost $40 pallete for $5 I cant imagine its supporting her too much and b.) I'm kinda so tired of people expecting poor people to take the weight of the world on them. It's like how people go out and make a plastic straw ban or campaigns for recycling when the fact is unless there's some real overhaul at the corporate pollution level it doesnt matter. And no that doesn't mean I just go out and do whatever I want cause it doesnt matter on the grand scheme. But I do stuff like volunteer locally where I know my actions are actually felt and leave buying responsibly to people who can afford it. Cuz honestly at my income level I cant really afford to buy anything that's 100% controversy free and humane. And I'm not tryna take a dig at anyone who can afford it. Seriously more power to you.
Youniqueamua,fepe4rn,t1_fepaz9d,1579318260.0,Damn does this mean I'm not gonna be able to get her stuff for basically nothing anymore? Cuz it's the only way I buy it. Lol.

Like if you really believe everyone is beautiful wouldnt u draw it realistically instead of basically just drawing the ideal hour glass figure on a heavier frame?

TheGoodPlace,feowvpg,t1_femupwo,1579307143.0,"They might, like Eleanor noticing she didnt belong in The Good Place, which would make the series description work. Basically if my theories correct theyd think they made it to The Good Place but be subtly tested while there (no chainsaw bears guys)."
TheGoodPlace,feovopd,t1_femtult,1579306416.0,Its definitely the series description and a lot of times shows will use that as a placeholder so that could definitely be what it is.

60daysin,femq7gz,t1_femewid,1579266371.0,Right like I dont see Dennis telling anyone about the program. It looks like he switched pods on his own next episode cuz hes worried about Alex tryna be friends with him.

movies,femnype,t1_feml5u3,1579264201.0,"Yes exactly, the only way to avoid any harm coming to his wife if he doesnt believe in the curse is to just marry her and not come back to his family so she doesnt have to draw a card. Especially since he doesnt even like his family. Like if he really believed there was no curse why would he go back to a family he hates and let his wife pull a card when theres a chance she pulls a card that triggers his entire family to attempting to murder her?

I'm not sure what's different between you suggested sentence and what she said tho."
TheGoodPlace,femnliy,t1_femg7ro,1579263823.0,"True, but I'm sure with his new philosophy ethics he'd agree that lying to them to give them a shot at getting into The Good Place would do more good than bad. Especially since it wouldnt be shocking if a lot of the other demons still held grudges against the core 4 so Michael might feel like he personally needs to be in charge of their test to make sure it's not rigged against them and they have the best shot of making it to the good place. With this show I never know tho. The biggest thing to me is looking back at Michael's line about ""Of course in the real test they wouldnt know their being tested"" (paraphrasing). Like telling the demons doesnt seem to really have a purpose worth wasting the time on that line and the audience doesnt really need to know that unless they want to remind us that the humans still cant know their doing something to get into The Good Place to actually get into The Good Place. Like yes they saved everyone souls and even offered themselves up to be tortured but according to the logic we've seen from the celestial beings they could just be offering to sacrifice themselves in the hopes that's good enough to get into The Good Place or that being tortured is a better alternative to them than being erased, so it could be viewed as selfishly motivated. If it does go the way I'm theorizing it wouldnt shock me if we get a line that basically since they had been rebooted so many times that any reboot for a test wouldnt be fair because theyve known about the afterlife for so many reboots that there was no way to let them keep a vague sense of everything theyve learned without them just having a sense that the afterlife is real, or something like that."
TheGoodPlace,femmypy,t1_femekrn,1579263141.0,"I think it could totally go either way tbh. But once I got this idea, Michael's line about ""Of course when they're being tested they wont actually know"" (paraphrasing) when they were testing scenarios on Tahani just feels like foreshadowing now."

I totally thought it was a placeholder when I first saw it, but then I noticed the next episode had ""Various conversations occur between various groups of people"". Like if it was a generic placeholder you'd think theyd use the same one, but u never know and it could just be a random thing. I wonder if it has the same description on other cable platforms (I have comcast) or if anyone remembers what tonight's episodes description was before it aired.

Im a huge Magicians fan and last year they had what seemed like really generic or weird descriptions for episodes, but then when the eps came out the descriptions actually made sense which gave me an idea that maybe they're doing the same thing here."
TheCircleTV,femmj3g,t1_fem9p24,1579262644.0,"Maybe it's just from watching other reality shows but I dont see why they wouldnt. Like even shows where the focus isnt dating (like my fav The Challenge) they allow and even encourage cast hook ups. I actually auditioned for The Challenge and they specifically asked if I would hook up with cast members and if so which were my preferences. Lol.

I was just surprised she didnt try cuz honestly when she first came in I was so surprised she was all about flirting (and not in a for the game way either, like she was genuinely about it) when it's a show where you never are in the same room as the ppl you're talking too, so I totally thought shed take advantage of the one time she was in the same room. Lol."
TheGoodPlace,femma5k,t1_fem81mu,1579262351.0,It's crazy cuz I started writing my original comment with the idea that The Good Place was too good for them. And then when I was going over the description for the next episode it just clicked that maybe this is to throw them off that their about to be tested. Like when I was rereading the description to write it in the comment I realized if the show description being the episode description is a clue than them being tested made more sense than it being too good for them.
TheCircleTV,femlz3p,t1_fem49zm,1579261988.0,So DCOMs (Disney channel original movies) are a guilty pleasure of mine and it reminded me of how in the final act theyll have a song where they flashback to things that happened in this literally 90 minute or less movie because the audience is small children... so what's The Circle's excuse?

TheGoodPlace,femluok,t1_felwvuh,1579261840.0,Yeah I actually saw more ppl commenting after so I checked it out. Is there a before or after show cuz the DVR recording for some reason on the last night is listing 90 mins.

I'm surprised productions not feeding her during the interviews."
60daysin,femfmhx,t1_fem3vrt,1579252975.0,"I kinda get the vibe she was the kind cop that thinks ""jail was bad cause it's supposed to be a punishment for bad people"" to justify sending people there, but had no idea how shitty it can be and she kinda seems like a control freak so I'm sure it's one of those dish it, but cant take it situations."
60daysin,femfbfh,t1_fem7sb5,1579252517.0,"I'm wondering if maybe it's a former inmate. Theres gotta be some reason they're blurring him in the trailer and that's got to be cause we dont know him.

Unless hes blurred for the entire show which means he could be a former inmate or an actual undercover."
Floribama,femde4y,t1_fellu9c,1579249762.0,"I was honestly thinking about that and it wouldnt surprise me if ppl in the south spend more time with their families, but not so much to do with the south and to do with property values. Like I'm from Mass and theres still some affordable areas but also a lot of gentrification so if you dont want to live with your family you end up moving far away where it's harder to see each other all the time. And down south has more rural areas which tend to be cheaper. Like my fam does a family reunion every 2 years and honestly it just keeps getting smaller cuz more people, especially the younger generations, keep moving further away. We now hold it an hour and a half away from where everyone was originally from cuz less ppl down here and no where affordable to hold it since the local VFW closed. But yeah not speaking for all of ""the north"" lol but I see how certain parts of the north might be less family gathering oriented just for property value and family being further away reasons."
TheGoodPlace,felvr4u,t1_felo0af,1579232147.0,"So next weeks episode recap on Comcast is basically describing the plot of The Good Place, which I've totally seen happen before except the next one says ""Various conversations occur, between various groups of people."". Which makes me wonder if the shows description also works for next episode.

The full thing says: ""When Eleanor Shellstrop finds herself in the afterlife, shes both relieved and surprised that shes made it into the Good Place. But it doesnt take long for Eleanor to realize shes there by mistake -- and she'll have to change her ways to stay"" 

Which at first kinda made me wonder if she'll (and possibly the whole group) just feel like The Good Place is too perfect and be bored and realize if they're going to stay they need to find a purpose or something. But then I realized that them getting into ""The Good Place"" without taking a test was to throw them off that they were starting their own test. Especially because they made a point this episode to point out that the humans wont know they're taking a test and since our 4 helped create the system that's pretty hard to do without mind wiping them. So the description might be a hint that were getting a throw back to the original point. And maybe that was Michael's new thing, making the OG 4's test."

TheCircleTV,feloxji,t1_fel0yi4,1579227385.0,Yeah especially cuz it was like nothing. Tbh for someone on my level of female horndogness the fact that Miranda didnt try to get to laid was shocking since that was really the only in game chance. I'm not gonna lie I would've hahaha
TheCircleTV,felot64,t1_fekzfda,1579227304.0,"Lol I know that. Ovulation is when you can get pregnant. I went to look for the article I had read, but cant find it now. I'm guessing I was confusing ovulation cramping and implantation cramping with one sided cramping that can be caused by cysts. Tho it doesnt help that if I include ovulation and cramping in the search it only gives me ovulation cramping. Lol.

Either way tho one sided cramping at periods isnt a super rare thing."
TheCircleTV,feko6a2,t1_fejm342,1579204128.0,"Yeah the finale was off, as I've said in other comments they def wasted too much time on flashback clips for a show that aired in its entirety over the course of 2 weeks."
TheCircleTV,feknz2m,t1_fejtjtn,1579204011.0,"I feel like another issue with the finale was they didnt consider this is a show a lot of ppl are gonna binge. Even if u watched it ""live"" you saw the entire thing over 2 weeks, so all the flashbacks to previous episodes were super unnecessary."
TheCircleTV,feknnlz,t3_eoxzca,1579203820.0,"I just want to say I called it that Seaburns gf has pain on her left side during periods.

Also kinda annoyed me that the host was like ""she needs to get that checked out"". Pain being more on one side isnt some super rare thing and usually relating to the side your ovulating on."

TheCircleTV,feiq5k5,t1_feimgj4,1579144441.0,"I think the catfishes would do better if they just acted like themselves with someone elses pics. Cuz at least with ""Mercedeze"" and ""Adam"" and a little bit Sean they acted like what they thought ""hot people"" acted like which actual people, no matter there hot level, usually have multiple sides and personalities, so catfishes just came off as one dimensional and shallow. Like ""Adam"" only started making bonds when he started acting more like ""Alex"". I think they should get a catfish who actually has experience catfishing in real life and already has a multifaceted character their used to pretending to be."
fatlogic,feinyp1,t1_fei0qcq,1579142970.0,"I love box mac and cheese. It's my guilty pleasure. But I'll take a box and divide it out in 5 portions at 130 calories each and I only add a little greek yogurt so it's like 135 calories total and I'll have it as a side.

I gave it up for a while cuz you cant make a whole box and not eat it at once cuz it just doesnt reheat well. Then one day I just realized I could weigh it before I cooked it. Lol."
DaybreakNetflix,feim9hm,t1_fei5rbq,1579141836.0,"Seriously! Like even a movie. Like I loved The Get Down, it was visually striking too, and I'd reccomend it to mad ppl, but once it got cancelled I stopped recommending it cause it got no closure. Same with Santa Clarita. So when ppl post ""What should I watch on Netflix?"" or ""Debating getting Netflix, what should I watch?"" I have less answers everytime they cancel something. And I also have less stuff to rewatch. Like I cant imagine a 2 hour close up costs that much when you already have sets made. Just feels dumb to me. Like you think Netflix would understand things can be cult classics and while immediate ratings are good that with so much to watch between different platforms, having things to keep people for the long term is super important. Sorry but tbh it irks me so much."

antiMLM,feh8eri,t1_feh6vqx,1579111282.0,"I'd reccomend actually doing some reading on the McDonalds coffee lawsuit. They were heating their coffee so hot that lady actually got third degree burns, was not the first person burned, they had multiple complaints and didnt do anything about it until they got sued, oh and she only sued initially because they wouldnt even pay for her medical bills. And then they spent money making fun of an elderly women and making it look ""frivolous"" so people would be on their side and less likely to do it again. Like seriously, that law suit was actually important and by making fun of it you're literally doing what corporations want you to do."

shameless,feera5e,t1_fedbo6r,1579039523.0,"Exactly, like I know people want Lip to either be a criminal genius or use his genius to get out of the neighborhood... but the truth is a lot intelligent people from poor neighborhoods never make it out, especially with parents like Frank and Monica. And when it comes to quitting addiction, most people (especially those who use twelve step programs), completely change their way of life. Like if you're an alcoholic who uses the twelve steps to get sober, you like live that life. Idk exactly how to explain it, but like my ex was an alcoholic and when he got sober he didnt still smoke weed and stopped hanging with people who did and stopped hanging out with ""wild"" people, even his cousin who was his best friend."
