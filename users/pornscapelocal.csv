AmItheButtface,fenqz7x,t1_fenofqk,1579289575.0,"Idk, I think it’s important to understand the context. OP mentioned a lot of extreme things (CPTSD, abuse, etc). I think promises are things you should keep, too, but also we’re getting one side of the story. The promises OP mentioned are valid, and I think they’re right to be frustrated. 

But more information ALWAYS matters. What if the promises were petty and stupid? What if OP was holding their boyfriend to ridiculous standards because their CPTSD made it difficult to be rational? Context matters. Information matters. Otherwise you risk being an enabler on the wrong side of things. AITB is not for fawning over OP just because they asked the question first."

AskWomen,fek281t,t3_epgsr6,1579191046.0,"First few weeks of us dating, he told me he thought monogamy wasn’t right and he didn’t understand why I didn’t want an open relationship. I was really insecure and angry and it was an ongoing conflict for the first year I’d say. Both of us were not properly equipped to discuss it. I struggled with a LOT of trust issues for that time because of it. 

We’re almost 3 years in now and happier than ever. Still monogamous, but he’s come to understand and enjoy the benefits of it. I’ve maintained my preferences but even I’ve come to a point where an open relationship doesn’t seem so ridiculous anymore because there’s a lot of love and trust between us. It just need time to build and grow. I still really don’t have the desire to sleep with anyone else, but that’s my preference just as much as his interest in it is his. 

Big conflicts are really, really hard. Situations that make the relationship seem finite are scary. But you have to always try to build more love, trust, and respect. Those 3 components will get you through most if not all conflicts. And not all conflict is solved in one go! Sometimes you both need to grow a bit before you can come back to a conflict and properly hash it out :)"

leaves,fedklh4,t1_fedio6z,1579013858.0,"Yeah I think a very mindful break is in my future. I do take breaks here and there, usually 2-3 days if I’m visiting my parents (about every week/every other week) or at least a week if I’m doing an intentional t-break. Usually that time passes without me thinking about the fact that I’m not smoking though. I’ll try to be more consciously aware of the differences next time."
leaves,fedig5a,t1_fedfai3,1579012352.0,"I think I got it figured out, but even so I still enjoy building in a few breaks here and there. It enhances the first time I smoke after and makes me feel better about my (lack of) dependence."
leaves,fedid23,t1_fedfhuk,1579012289.0,"Yeah that definitely became the case when I started smoking in the mornings! I felt like I couldn’t do anything without weed first but once I scaled back it was easier. My rule is no smoking before 8pm, unless friends are coming over. That way I don’t smoke as much and I can usually hit the sweet spot where I’m not high anymore but I am very ready for bed at a reasonable hour. 

I think I’ll carry this routine through a little longer and just keep giving myself t-breaks as I see fit. I mentioned in another comment that I work in substance abuse recovery so “quitting” and “sobriety” are concepts that are always on my mind. It’s made me hyper aware of my own smoking habits and whether or not they resemble addicted behavior. Thanks for your answer!"
leaves,fedhz56,t1_fedfte1,1579012006.0,"Yeah, I’ve done that periodically too. Taking “T-breaks.” Any time I visit my parents (almost weekly holidays I go 2-3 days without it and I don’t miss it, but it definitely feels nice to come back to my own home, close the door, and enjoy my smoking ritual. 

It maybe makes sense to point out that I work in substance abuse recovery so while I don’t think my habit with weed is too similar to my clients’ habits with various hard drugs, my job has me constantly questioning the ethics of getting high every night. I’m trying to fight through my conditioning and training that makes me believe you should try your best to go through all of life independent of substance use. But my own personal experience has me questioning what “dependence” really even looks like. 

I think I’m pretty healthy and okay with it, but I’m always around people who are trying to quit SOMETHING that it’s affecting my own feelings. Thanks for everyone’s input!!"
AmItheButtface,febvekh,t3_eo6ld3,1578963128.0,"Basically what everyone else said. Also consider, if she’s been at uni as long as you and still hasn’t made any friends, maybe not having you around will encourage her to branch out and make her own friends. She’s only alone now because maybe she’s felt like she has everything she needs. If you do it kindly, this could be a good thing for her as well."

books,fdzk5zc,t3_en5uar,1578790965.0,"I don’t disagree, but I think the whole point of books is using your imagination to create the story. If a book has art specifically made for the book (eg Harry Potter) I think that adds to your experience with the book.

I don’t think it’s a strong argument, but maybe it’s why people don’t like it."

I know the sub’s name is misleading but I’ve thought of it more like r/CanILookBetter (which is not a real sub, I don’t think). Ugly people don’t need the internet to tell them they’re ugly. Decent looking people can probably always look “better” and be more attractive with better haircuts, makeup, outfits, etc.

No one’s really out here recommending plastic surgery so I think the subjectivity of attraction is a moot point.

amiugly,fby0kdr,t3_eer6zv,1577205187.0,"I really don’t think you’re ugly. I think you’re 16 and your body is still quite literally figuring out your whole self. If there’s “weight” to be lost, I would instead focus on developing healthy eating and exercise habits. Get yourself a cookbook and start finding fun at-home Youtubers who’ll work out with you 30 minutes a day. Developing these healthy habits will help you in the long run WAY more than any crash diets or whatever else will promote instant weight loss to you. 

Here’s my honest truth: some of the weight in your face reminds me of weight I had in mine at 16. Believe it or not, some of it IS baby fat still. I think once you pass 18 and start handling adult responsibilities, your face will begin to change itself with or without your doing. 

I know this is a more long-run answer to your question, so I’ll shorten it. You’re not ugly. You’re young. If you want to change up your hair and do things with your appearance to make you more confident, do it! It’s super fun to change up your look and play with different styles. But if you’re doing it to cover up what you’re insecure about, you’ll find yourself hiding behind a mask, and that’s INFINITELY harder to break out of. I think you have beautiful eyes and very striking features, they just seem like they need more developing with time :)"
