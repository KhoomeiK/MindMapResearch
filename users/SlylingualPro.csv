AskReddit,ff8ici9,t1_ff8gvuc,1579679826.0,">No, just because something large and convoluted is bullshit, doesn't mean every bit of it is. If a religion says do not murder, since it's bullshit, now you can murder?

Religion isn't required for morality, grow up and learn how to use analogies.

>Here's your mistake. You're treating belief systems as a scientific field. There will never be ""evidence"" for God. As a scientist, if you only derive beliefs from a scientific standpoint, you cannot logically believe in any deity, this much is known. But that's a level of the argument I thought we're past. Because my point was that science and religion can coexist, meaning if religion does not contradict science due to a given interpretation, it does not mean the religion is true, but it means it can be entertained in the mind of someone who is a scientist and is open to possibilities that answer the eternal question, why do we have a conscious awareness? for example And as a scientist, you also acknowledge that this belief system in your head and your head alone, you cannot possibly turn it into a series of objective statements that can be communicated to others, but it's just for you, based on your logic and your anecdotal experience.

It's not based on logic or evidence and is therefore unscientific. It's really as simple as that.

>If I had an experience that I am certain was mediated by God, say he saved me or helped me or something in a way that makes it extremely unlikely that's due to chance. I can start believing God exists, because even though this is not objective quantifiable and falsifiable evidence, it is evidence to me. And even to me, I am open to the possibility that this could still have been due to chance, but it's beyond where i draw my line (an internal non quantifiable subjective p value if you will).

That belief would still be unscientific and incompatible with logic.

>So to sum it up, it isn't about proving God exists. It is about showing there are possibilities where the existence of God does not contradict scientific fact. Which at least allows you to think about them because they're not straight out false, just unproven

No, it's about realizing that because having a scientific mind means you believe that which you have evidence for, God is incompatible with that thinking until we have proof.
