Once you get enough for the Outpost building (42kish) you can fit pretty much everything you need except the big weaponsmith(can fit on second level but that's my prisoner dueling ring).

Haven't tried the square houses yet, but going to try one for my weapon smithing. I own a few buildings and try to have each with their own purpose.  Lord Ohta is a dick though and I will murder him and his decendents."

Pro choice wants the woman(or man) who is pregnant to not be pressured into making a life changing decision that isn't the best choice for the pregnant party and their potential offspring.

Anti-abortion are saying that you are murdering a human life and that the morals required to undergo an abortion are the same as murdering a newborn.

I never see any actual discussion between sides. Shouldn't we be trying to defend out position while coming to an understanding with the people on the other side?

Inb4: We are completely correct and they are ignorant/immoral for how they want an unwanted pregnancy to be handled. No point talking to them."

I wasn't trying to cause an argument, put down the left, or defend the right. That being said I think that anyone who accepts the influence media is having on the right, but denies that its happening on the left is not seeing things through a clear lens. Americans are being influenced by people who want things to happen and have the power to manipulate them in their favor. Its the same reason gerrymandering is as strong as it is."

>There are mods for that. Placeable things that you refill from directly. Or run the seeder up next to the pallets to refill from there. 

No mods on Stadia unfortunately, and I didnt think it would be efficient to haul my seeder all the way to the store. But with my skills, maybe it is.

* Noivern (No idea, I got a shiny and was trying to help with defense typing, but my least favorite)
* Gyarados (Doing Gyarados things)
*  Togekiss (Debating between choice scarf special sweeper or paraflynch)
* 6th is either Ninjask for some Baton pass shenanigans (harder with protect not working on max) or some other supporty. Xatu screens, or drifblim status/setup.

In my case would you consider any a flagship? I feel Gyarados and Hawlucha are both sweepers but Hawlucha needs a field setup or max turn to unburden (which setting himself up makes it hard to get a swords dance off)."

The feet and leg skin would be much more tough than the rest of the body, so if it specifies that chicken leather comes from those parts I would think that means the rest of the chicken isnt suitable (my brain reads too thin) for chicken leather.
