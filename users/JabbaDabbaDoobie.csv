God has nothing to do with the decision- He accepts your choice, and that’s that. Hell is a place that God, through his respect for our decisions, has left- Hell is simply a place where God is not present; it just so is that a place of such a definition is awful due to a lack of His presence.

It’s a legitimate choice- you can either be in a place with God, or in a place without God. Making an analogy is difficult here, but I’ll try my best: imagine you find a great roomate (super nice guy, fun to be around, all that), but choose to instead move into a different place- you can’t blame that roomate if you hate the new place, it was your choice to move in there.

In regards to your question, of course. If tomorrow Satan himself said “Lord forgive me”, he would be forgiven- the only sin that cannot be forgiven is not believing that you can be forgiven. I don’t see how your second point ties to your first- assuming consent, God could empty out Hell. But, because people choose to be there through their actions, they this do not consent, and therefore their decision is respected by God- I would consider it more cruel and evil for God to *not* respect their decision.

To recap: if sinners in Hell wished to reconnect with God, there would be no problem. However, through their actions they have chosen to not consent to such a move- maybe some have, I obviously don’t have first hand experience there. The point being, God suffers too when people choose to go to Hell- if it was up to God, all mankind would be in Heaven; but He loves and respects us so much that he’s willing to let us make our own decisions, even if they are very bad decisions."
