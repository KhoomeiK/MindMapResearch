dogs,fefmaeq,t1_fef5vmp,1579059388.0,"Amen to that. But after chasing a beagle all over the county after he wandered off during a rabbit hunt, the price started looking a lot more reasonable!"
dogs,fe61agl,t1_fe4hy3k,1578879553.0,I wish I could upvote this more than once.
dogs,fe233pt,t3_enhwpo,1578833983.0,Don't wang your dog. That's never a good choice. :)
Hunting,fcuf8zh,t1_fcubfq6,1577979533.0,"What kind of dogs? Dog running deer isn't allowed here, but I'm curious about it."
Hunting,fct6tl7,t3_eilj70,1577934392.0,Man that looks good. I'm definitely going to give it a try.
dogs,fct4lm7,t1_fcsz779,1577932734.0,"Don't misread what I'm saying, the breeder is totally involved in the process. I've been training and working his line for almost 20 years. He knows what I look for and shows me the ones that best match what I want, but I make the final selection. My dogs' performance is what drew us together to begin with, so I'm willing to trust my own judgement."
dogs,fcshw6t,t1_fcs5nju,1577916826.0,"I know breeder gets first pick, but how common is it for the breeder to pick the applicants' puppy as well? I've never encountered that. 

My breeder's dogs are a working line and maybe that's the difference. But when I pick a pup, I'm looking for specific traits and behaviors that I want. Frankly, I'd be kind of offended if I wasn't given a choice."
coonhounds,fchgzof,t1_fcf8e69,1577650358.0,It's not that uncommon. My dog was similar and the black on his shoulders and hindquarters changed to brown in his first year.
dogs,fchei5v,t3_ehaf7w,1577649735.0,"They don't sound like hunting dogs. Anyone that puts in the effort it takes to train a dog to hunt doesn't let them get into the condition you describe, and they definitely don't ""abandon"" them mid-hunt.

Where in Ohio are you? I've been looking for a coonie, but haven't had much luck."
dogs,fc5av9n,t1_fc3wmr8,1577451503.0,"That's an unusual mix, but it could have been intentional. There are feral hogs in SC. Coonhounds are used a lot as bay dogs in hog hunting, and Cane Corsos are a catch breed. Perhaps some hunter was trying for a dog that could do both and your pup came from that litter.

No matter how he got here, he's a handsome fellow."
dogs,fc07ggs,t3_effz12,1577281791.0,"Corgis don't shed much, lol! I could have knit sweaters from mine, or assembled a whole other corgi."
dogs,fbp6xqw,t3_ee2h8h,1577018109.0,"Foster mom wants to keep the dog and is hoping you'll give up on the adoption. 

It's stuff like this that makes me dislike rescues. They're a good idea in theory but in my experience they're difficult to work with or the adoption process is ridiculously invasive and you have to sign the contract in blood after promising your firstborn child."
