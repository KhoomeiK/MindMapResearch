I think some people just have naturally high heart rates. I'm a 21 year old male 140lbs. My doctor didn't seem to be concerned when I had my heart tested a year or so ago.

R3: Batman, Gon has insane senses but since he wouldnt get bloodlusted hes not that dangerous.

R4: Batman is weaker and less durable than goku but hes around the same speed (maybe a bit faster) at this point. I think if he can trap him in a steel net or something he may win. He might also learn about goku's tail weakness in the middle of the fight.

whowouldwin,fcvs3ht,t3_ej2hg9,1578008843.0,"Ill just pick the Flash wally west for my servant. Im gonna make up some plausible stats since he would get majorly nerfed becoming a servant.

Strength: C

Endurance: D

Agility: A++

Magical Energy: D

Luck: D

Noble Phantasm: Ex (Speedforce is op)

Class Abilities: Phase through objects, arm tornadoes, minor regen, whatever else he can normally do.

R1: Would probably lose without using a noble phantasm(speedforce) battle continuation lets lancer use his noble phantasm one last time so the safe bet would be to use the stillforce to trap him in time or something)

R2: Difficult fighting a fast sword user with no weapon so noble phantasm would probably be necessary.

R3: Depends on setting, invading the temple would be a bad idea and we would probably lose. If we can blizt them somewhere else that would be ideal and that would probably be our course of action.

R4: Rider is shit with Shinji, I doubt he would have issues beating her while I stomp Shinjis head into the pavement.

R5: I feel theres a decent chance flash could beat EMIYA in a 1 - 1 match but with Rin there, theres no chance he could protect me from her and fight archer at once. Since I already know what happens in the story the best chance of winning would be sending flash alone while EMIYA is recovering from saber.

R6: Some speedforce bullshit like trapping berserker in the speedforce would be the only way to win really. Flash cant really hurt him any other way. I cant win agaisnt Illiya so he would go alone again.

R7: He should be able to easily beat him without giving him a chance to use his noble phantasm.

R8: Things like the stillforce and speedforce would count as magic in this scenario so Artoria would probably have a high resistance to it. Im leaning towards flash losing.

R9: Hes gonna die, if Gilgamesh couldnt win then the speedforce probably wouldnt help since sakura kinda absorbs magical energy I believe.

R10: Blitz with speedforce and I think the flash would definitely win."
