So basically the Von hippel dude was talking about a study done in I want to say the Philippines. 

It was done over a long period of time and looked at the testosterone levels on men from X age to Y age. It found that married men have lower test even compared to men of the same age who are not married. 


I dont believe it was the main goal of the study but was more of a side discovery. 


Rogan being a test head was all upset and trying to shoot holes in the methodology, when the dude was just using the study as an example for something else.

words of Iraqi PM.

""Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi stated that he was due to meet the elite Quds force commander after he landed in Baghdad for talks that had been agreed to at Trump’s request.

Abdul-Mahdi told the Iraqi parliament on Sunday that Soleimani entered the country with a response to a Saudi Arabian proposal to de-escalate the volatile situation between the two countries. He said that Trump had called for his assistance in mediating with the Gulf kingdom, which views Iran as its main regional rival, blaming it for attacks on its oil refineries earlier this year.


“[Gen Soleimani] came to deliver me a message from Iran, responding to the message we delivered from Saudi Arabia to Iran,” Abdul-Mehdi explained. But soon after he landed in Baghdad, Soleimani was killed in an attack by a U.S. drone described by the Iraqi prime minister as “a political assassination.”""

""    1. It is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy. Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy. The following acts are examples of perfidy:


        (a) The feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender;


        (b) The feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness;


        (c) The feigning of civilian, non-combatant status; and


        (d) The feigning of protected status by the use of signs, 







2. Ruses of war are not prohibited. Such ruses are acts which are intended to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but which infringe no rule of international law applicable in armed conflict and which are not perfidious because they do not invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under that law. The following are examples of such ruses: the use of camouflage, decoys, mock operations and misinformation.""
