funny,fetk132,t3_eqie8p,1579376197.0,"So your sister wants to marry a Disney boy? 
Easy. Just learn animation and buy (or bribe, I don't judge) your way into the Pixar studios, use subliminal messaging to convince the head animators to use your sister's likeness in the newest insta-classic Disney hit, and... the final step: profit. 

It's a win-win. Your sister gets the proposal of her dreams, and you get a boatload of cash from Disney's monopoly. 

I accept tips."
