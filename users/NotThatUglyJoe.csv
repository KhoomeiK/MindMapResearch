What you can do is to increase the scale of the second S. Wheel to cover the original sim footage one and stabilise the the footage so it doesn't move all over the place. If there is a camera movement in sim footage you need to track the the S. Wheel in that footage to the one from wheel cam."

1. It would be great if there was an option to use parent null function on a group on layers and create on null instead of separate null for each layer.

2. Like the crop functions, it is really handy, like really. However, is there a way of coping existing pre-comp without it being pre-compose again?

3. Split masks also very handy, I like the fact those tools are all available in a one panel, but I would like to have an option to duplicate layers based on masks without pre-comp. I'm guessing those are AE limitations.

Definitely would have to create an adjustment layer and animate its opacity.

1. White balance the blue of the light and adjust the lightness, add some tint. Use masks to keep the affected area to minimum.

2. Replace with color effect, replace with the dark unlight area, rgb curves + tint.

3. Lumetri second color and color masking, I actually used this approach for something else before and pre-compose the layer with just the blue areas selected and use it as a track matte for some sort of black mask.

4. Rotoscoping over an solid layer with generate fill and overlay blending mode."

However, some manual adjustments to key frames will be necessary if track is drifting a lot."
