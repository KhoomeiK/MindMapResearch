It's airflow activated (before screwing on the cart, try ""inhaling"" on the top of the battery and you'll see it light up...!) so you just screw the cart on and off to space you go  


Careful, these things hit hard especially on exhale so try a 2-3 second pull to start, no more. Don't hit it over and over you'll notice it warms up, carts can eventually leak if you were to warm it so much the oil leaked out! (Not usually a problem, but be aware of this)  


The carts don't require the airflow batteries, for future reference. So you can buy yourself any 510 thread battery and it'll work with these carts.

I had bought Voodoo Drips, worked fine

But not entirely sure on contents. Some people argue safety of different ones. But they are usually the same compounds used in vape liquids for e-juice, which people vape LOTS of each day and we are talking about sub-1ml amounts over days, so probably safe.

PEG/PG/etc. 

The premise works with basically any extract, but it's a solvent - so it's pointless to buy an expensive solventless extract to do it on like live resin (but people still do)

There's black market sites that sell all types of extracts they've liquidized, I just came across this intense site the other day that had a big chart too.

Here it is, can't find the chart again though
