Destiny,fcapnzy,t1_fc888ey,1577574082.0,">The alt-right grew to prominence because they were allowed to do so. It's a mistake that we should learn from, not repeat it with leftist extremists.

Did you listen to anything from people like the friaday or what's his name when he talks about deradicalization?  Or even people like Contrapoints and David Pakman?  Radicalization stems not from solely from ideology but the lack a solution that society doesn't provide. If society a doesn't give people particularly men the tools to be productive or have a place in society then obviously they would turn to more radical models. 

So what did the centrists did to white rural and incels? Ignore their problems and say things will get better. This is how we got young white nationalist. Now what is the center is doing again? If you really want to stop radicalization policies matter. Let's a radical leftist trans woman who went to the deep end.  Currently there is no place for her on the right, and the center left doesn't do anything except for asking for votes? What's the  logical alternative by deduction?"

Destiny,fc6osx8,t1_fc66lrh,1577485712.0,"Why are you trying so hard to pretend that there is a violent revolution coming in full swing? Do you have any proof.  With the alt right, we know that it was violent because rhetoric of gamergate.   I see that your argument isn't based on logic or even contextual evidence. The alt right, online Nazism  and white nationalism were always violent since 1975 in its approach. You can't create a ethnostate without killing people.  Online leftist sure they use Gulag  jokes but you can get medicare for all without killing people. 

Let me put this in perspective.  Racists jokes are okay even Destiny makes them, Sexual jokes are okay, transgender jokes are okay, but some how we treating online leftist  that make up 3% of all political violence within the US as a growing threat that needs to be de-platformed because of iconography? That's so gross. You can't jail someone when they didn't commit a crime 

This type of hypocrisy for an aesthetic of normality is the exact reason why people take radical positions or don't feel connected within society which ultimately harms society.  Also how does deplatforming helped in the past? It only got alt right grifters bigger."

Destiny,fc5n7ep,t1_fc4resk,1577461946.0,">Should we just wait until they do start killing people? If we're at that stage, isn't it a bit too late for deplatforming etc?

This comment is the purest example of the problem that we're having in discourse. When the alt right was making these memes and were actually using stronger language, the centrist liberal position was to give it leeway as interpret it as jokes.  When the left uses obtuse humor such as gulag jokes  when there is no proof of a violent revolution  but rather super enthusiastic Bernie Bros, we're sounding the alarms. 

What you're projecting is an undue assertion. This is the reason why in the US white nationalist groups are being declassified as terrorist groups but black and queer activists are considered dangerous even

Left wing violence in the US only accounts of 3% of all political terrorism. While 70% is accounted by the right.
