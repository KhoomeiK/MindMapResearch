If you spend the 1300 hours getting and working a job, that job will likely be around for awhile longer, you'll gain experience, and ultimately every $1 of value you produce today will appreciate into more value tomorrow.

Playing WoW though is like buying a car. As soon as you drive it off the lot, it's worth less.

Every minute you ""invest"" in playing WoW has a depreciating return on the next minute you play WoW."

todayilearned,fd3govi,t1_fcznrym,1578158191.0,"The two largest expenses to a business are real estate and wages. A self driving car has neither of those expenses.

The money a self driving car will earn will far outpace the costs of maintenance.

In fact, its borderline a poor business strategy to sell them to consumers. They would make tons more money hoarding them for themselves and managing the fleet internally (economy of scale). 

Reduce the cost of a ride to undercut the cost of owning a vehicle, until there are no more privately owned vehicles on the road. Then you are the only option, and can charge whatever you like.

For the above reason, owning a fully functional, revenue earning self driving car will be a very expensive purchase."

The only belief system I know of that maybe doesnt qualify under that umbrella is Buddhism and its contributions to mindfulness."

The left has and is the proponent of employees rights unions, voting rights, anti-trust laws, and environmental protection.

The left gets excited about the efficiency gains provided by large economic entities.

The right gets excited about how it can capitalize on regulatory capture and stock prices.

The day after Trump was elected, stocks in gun manufacturers and oil pipelines sky rocketed, and stock of environmentally responsible companies took a nose dive.

It's clear as day.

As for the environmental impact, these are electric cars so emissions will be low. The number of cars om the road eventually required will be a percentage of the ones that currently exist further reducing the impact.

I think what you will see, is as self driving cars become more normal the following will occur.

1. Private car ownership will dwindle as people realize the savings from not owning or maintaining their own car.

2. Prime real estate in the form of parking lots and garages will be repurposed

3. Self driving cars, which are on duty will drive near high demand areas in a loop. The number of self driving cars im an area will be a function of demand. Excess cars will probably park a short distance away from high traffic metropolitan areas (similar to airports).

4. The need for traveling to high density metropolitan areas will reduce. With the advent of Amazon 1 day shipping, and grocery delivery the need to go out is reduced. The insane decline of retail properties over the last decade supports this trend, and I think it will continue until the focus moves from ""retail"" to ""experiences"" and ""entertainment"". But one thing is for sure, the ""need to go out"" is trending downwards and we are nowhere near the bottom."
