NoStupidQuestions,fe1a973,t1_fe18o2b,1578824317.0,Thank you for being so understanding!
NoStupidQuestions,fe18epx,t1_fe184m6,1578823726.0,"No I get that. The reason I said it is because some people cant draw others to something they dont want to be a part of. Such as, you dont want to be on fb, WhatsApp, etc, and they dont want to be on discord. So since you cant force someone, and they cant force you, texting seems to be a middle ground that (most) everyone has."
NoStupidQuestions,fe15ral,t3_enlnck,1578822820.0,"Honestly, just show them discord. You can even create a server and have them join. Outside of that if they dont like it you cant force someone to change to your whim. You'll just have to adapt, or tell them to simply text you."
gaming,fe14jf7,t3_enjaan,1578822424.0,"I know this is stupid, and I think the guys message is an absolute 10, but one of my biggest pet peeves (whatever that means) is when people write loose instead of lose.

Other than that, wholesome. Wonderful. The thing I said was probs an accident."
