AskReddit,ff4htru,t3_erhu3x,1579563963.0,Doesn‚Äôt happen with any dreams worth mentioning. But I do find myself immediately falling back into the same dream after hitting snooze. Even happens multiple times. Not sure if this is normal.
morbidquestions,ff4hgbg,t3_erc0qo,1579563703.0,"The prisoners would have to be executed in the actual operating room. A person donating organs is ‚Äúalive‚Äù but brain dead when the procedure starts, and the moment of cardiac death isn‚Äôt until the clamp and cut the aorta to remove the heart. So a prisoner wouldn‚Äôt be able to receive any of the standard methods of execution, as the organs are useless the second their heart stops unless the surgery has started. They would have to be taken to a hospital and put under anesthesia and their actual execution would occur when the aorta is cut. I imagine the planning and effort of this isn‚Äôt something that the government would want to invest money in, as well as give a chance for a jailbreak during transportation to the hospital."
morbidquestions,ff4gth2,t1_ff3rfx3,1579563266.0,"I can imagine there being some people who would rather remain on the waiting list than take the organ of a murderer. I‚Äôd personally take it because it‚Äôs just tissue and cells, but people that are superstitious I imagine wouldn‚Äôt want it. 

But could you imagine the headlines we could get out of it later?

‚ÄúMan claims he only became murderer because he accepted the donated heart of a murderer.‚Äù"
morbidquestions,ff4gep6,t1_ff3is32,1579562983.0,"In the US they don‚Äôt take hair anyway and corneas are a dime a dozen. I worked as a procurement tech for bone and tissue. There‚Äôs times where they would temporarily shut down the ocular department because the banks would be too full anyway. Since the cornea is doesn‚Äôt have a blood supply, they don‚Äôt need to be matched as well for donation. Plus a lot of families consent to corneal donation only since the home and tissue part is rather brutal."

cats,ff26s8m,t1_ff22w4u,1579495426.0,"I think normally I wouldn‚Äôt care, but I‚Äôm pregnant now so I overthink in the poo schmoo department."
cats,ff20pgt,t3_er0kyu,1579490694.0,"As much as I would enjoy my cats liking water, am I the only one thinking about the possible fecal bacteria on their paws and butthole being in the same water my lady bits are soaking in?"
HomeImprovement,febvg29,t1_fe26n6p,1578963149.0,My sister in law got her money back. And when the employees left the store a bunch of them just took dresses with them. The one girl there remembered her purchasing that one a few days before and found her on Facebook and gave her the sample dress that fit pretty damn well. So she actually ended up with a free dress. It ended up working out in her favor since her wedding was still pretty far away.
HomeImprovement,fe0i9ij,t1_fdyhvte,1578813835.0,"Even if it was debit and not a credit card, call your bank and see if they can still revoke the charge."
HomeImprovement,fe0hzb9,t1_fdyhvte,1578813729.0,I third this. When Alfred Angelo the bridal place went bankrupt this was how my sister in law got her money back for the dress she paid for. Same situation where the company wouldn‚Äôt even take phone calls.
HomeImprovement,fe05y5j,t3_en863n,1578803876.0,I was going to agree with your wife until I saw the photos. That would bother the hell out of me.
morbidquestions,fdyd0e3,t3_en55hd,1578778424.0,I worked as a procurement tech and we would cut apart cadavers to remove tendons and bones. I always said I wonder what certain things tasted like and my coworkers thought it was weird. How can you cut apart a human and not at least wonder what a thigh would taste like?
LifeProTips,fds7i4k,t3_emriub,1578696104.0,"If I was homeless, I‚Äôd commit some low level crime. Enough to get arrested and sent to a minimum security prison. Food, shelter, healthcare. You could even pursue a degree or education if the prison offers it. Unless you‚Äôre totally cool with being homeless, I feel it would be an upgrade."
unpopularopinion,fds6tox,t1_fdpwwd0,1578695661.0,Sadly I‚Äôve met a lot of women who didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs neglect on the prescribing doctors part. Any woman should be warned that when given an antibiotic.
morbidquestions,fdpxmuy,t3_emn3i5,1578644865.0,Guess I‚Äôm losing a leg. Just need to steal some lidocaine. Tourniquet the leg. Start an IV there and create a bier block in the leg for anesthetic. Graft out enough skin for a flap. Cut skin and subcutaneous with a knife. Move onto muscle. Lighters and metal for some cautery of the vessels. Saw for the bone. Smooth the edges. Pull over muscle flaps. Suture skin flap. Release the tourniquet and then pass out from pain.
unpopularopinion,fdpwuke,t3_emljo1,1578643852.0,"I had a guy become a close friend after we got drunk and hooked up. I was open about wanting a friendship and not a relationship out of it. We remained like the best of friends for a long time. I never flirted or led him on. But everyone once in a while he would drunk text or call me about how in love with me he was and wished we were together. I‚Äôd back away. He‚Äôd apologize and ask to go back to normal. But the process just kept repeating itself. We drifted apart after I moved out of state and he made once last attempt and asked to move with me. Point is, if you can‚Äôt handle the friend zone and the chick is not sending you other signals, man up and remove yourself from the friendship. Sure it‚Äôs the loss of a friendship and it didn‚Äôt feel great. But the guilt of not feeling the same way killed me because I couldn‚Äôt do anything about it."
crafts,fdehgew,t3_ekqrl9,1578339105.0,Will do. Thanks for the input.
HomeImprovement,fcykxt5,t3_eji8ar,1578081896.0,"Live in Vegas. My mother in law had ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù stain their kitchen cabinets. Missed sanding half the areas. Any spot that was slightly difficult to sand they just skipped. Guy did 2 layers of stain without waiting for first to dry, mostly pulling off the still wet first coat. He randomly stained some of the edges where the drawers go but skipped other. Got stain on the counters to the point it wouldn‚Äôt come out (luckily she replaced them anyway but the guy didn‚Äôt know that was her plan). Not to mention they told her they would do prep work and didn‚Äôt tarp or cover a single thing. We spend 6 hours cleaning sawdust after she fired them. 

It took my father in law, husband, and I, a few weeks with our working schedules but we did them ourselves. I started with resending everything inside and just one single coat looked better than the finger painting disaster that guy did. Now they look like they were done by professionals. I can‚Äôt go over there without reliving the trauma. She says if she ever redoes the kitchen again she‚Äôs buying new ones thank god."
morbidquestions,fcv78hx,t3_ej0k8m,1577996090.0,You‚Äôd sleep eventually but probably get woken up easily by light and stuff. Eventually your corneas will dry out and be too damaged to see.
DunderMifflin,fcs8ciz,t1_fcs7kyx,1577912872.0,Jesus lord help me. Deserving to keep a job while pregnant is not deserving everything. Good god there‚Äôs some ignorant people here.
DeathStranding,fcs5lcn,t1_fcs51c5,1577911768.0,You might be the saddest person out there actually. I‚Äôve been there a year and have not remotely been useless during my pregnancy. Also 35k is not big bucks you fucking ass hat.
legaladvice,fcpn29t,t1_fcpmsso,1577867857.0,"I would love to expose the shit this company does. They have a high turn over rate and have a lot of people training their own replacements, unaware that they will be fired once they train the new person well enough. It‚Äôs behind messed up. But would never make anything public prior to a discussion with a lawyer."
legaladvice,fcpmueq,t1_fcpkli4,1577867720.0,I told them I was planning on staying in OR until I deliver and use FMLA. They explained that most techs who are pregnant don‚Äôt make it long and take a leave of absence prior to FMLA. I told them I didn‚Äôt want to do that and planned on working u til FMLA unless I felt my needs or capabilities changed. That‚Äôs what I meant by the statement there. Sorry it‚Äôs all over the place.
legaladvice,fcpm46w,t1_fcpkli4,1577867288.0,Understandable. The conversation went much clearer than that. I‚Äôm trying to paraphrase here and am mentally exhausted from all the emotion of dealing with this today.
legaladvice,fcpk387,t1_fcpj4i8,1577866107.0,"I did not ask for a leave but was told it was my responsibility to ask for it if I felt I was at a point where I can‚Äôt do the job. Meanwhile I have been doing my job 6 months pregnant, quite frankly, like a badass. I was informed by him that the leave before FMLA Maternity has been done but was not told more than that. Our company pays another company to run ours essentially. I do know that when our surgery scheduler was pregnant for the 4 th time (she works from home) that we had to be quiet because the higher ups tried to fire her with her last pregnancy and my boss told them they were not allowed."
legaladvice,fcpi4lf,t1_fcphc84,1577864952.0,"This begins as far back as our contracted office manager making jokes than women can‚Äôt get pregnant at our office for at least 4 years. 

My first convo with him about it for me was when he found out I wanted children and I asked how maternity leave worked there. He replied with I better not be pregnant. I wasn‚Äôt at the time but was trying. He then told me that I would be required to find my own maternity coverage. 

After getting pregnant and asked about it again and was told the same thing. A few months later he told me not to worry about finding my own coverage and it would be taken care of it. 

He is suddenly interviewing multiple people for tech jobs saying they are do the new surgeon coming on. When I express that I have been concerned they are interviewing for my position, he assures me that as long as I am ready, willing, and able to work I am safe. And leaves it at that. 

Later he brings up a convo with me and mentioned that most techs don‚Äôt last past month 7 with their pregnancy before they can‚Äôt work. My boss had made small comments that it may be better to put me in the office for a while. I ask what would happen if they didn‚Äôt want me in the OR and was told I would be required to take an unpaid leave of absence before taking my FMLA LEAVE after I deliver. 

Passive aggressive comments during surgery for the next few months and here I am today. The guy who fired me is in Mexico. Someone was there to fire me on his behalf and I‚Äôm not joking. My boss texted me thanking me for my work and said the job is just too strenuous for my progressing pregnancy."
legaladvice,fcpgy5n,t1_fcpgosr,1577863566.0,"Good point, I realized it was likely done that way so they didn‚Äôt have to pay me the 50 hours of PTO but I didn‚Äôt even think about the fact that most employers aren‚Äôt required to follow the FMLA if you have been there less than a year. Thanks for pointing that out."

DeathStranding,fahxv1c,t1_fageqa1,1576095756.0,Because I paid for it and want to finish it and give it a full chance. But not enjoying it this far makes it hard to sit and play for long periods.
