UNCCharlotte,ff3sgeg,t3_eregd1,1579547866.0,I would definitely say a fair number of CS students are on this sub reddit so it may be worth posting the details.
CodingHelp,ff2mgmp,t1_ff2li7k,1579513252.0,You didn’t capitalize the L in next line for age also you should only use one scanned and just reuse the scanner ie since u called it scanner just scanner. Method for all your inputs. I would also recommend not calling the variable scanner as that’s bad practice and can lead to issues particularly if you learn c/c++
CodingHelp,ff2li7k,t1_ff2hze0,1579511788.0,Can u post the code
CodingHelp,ff2driv,t1_ff2dppn,1579502009.0,Yes. The only issue I may run into is clearing the input buffer which can be done with input. Next line and don’t store the val
arma,ff1g572,t1_ff1g1ox,1579478695.0,"Yeah it’s a case off, is there an ini or mod I can use to improve the performance without ln2"
CodingHelp,ff0lqce,t3_er1hhb,1579470079.0,This is more a side note but you don’t need to declare and init a new scanner u can reuse the old one
Kalilinux,fem8kc7,t1_fem8jh1,1579243690.0,Likely although you’d be suprised when we are awake
Kalilinux,fem87ns,t1_fem4c2s,1579243299.0,Looks like it I’m no expert tho
Kalilinux,fem45k0,t1_fem44hz,1579239141.0,Are you sure unless the pc is brand new it’s unlikely there isn’t a new version I would think
Kalilinux,fem42zx,t1_fem41h5,1579239071.0,Yeah I would go back remove the partition and try to reinstall . Then worst case you may need to update your bios
Kalilinux,fem3y25,t3_epv8nb,1579238943.0,I would recommend re partition  thedrive with gparted and then re partitioning you kali space then installing again also redownload kali did you check it’s hash. Download could be corrupted as well. Kali also tends to get cranky when dual booted with intel chips in my experience. It’s something about the display firmware used

panthers,feftc0p,t3_eov8s6,1579064576.0,As someone who has had 8 concussions I complete understand his choice. Trust have been so hard but the only thing worse than losing what you love is losing your mind.

TBI,fecvvjm,t1_fecvrbe,1578986684.0,The doc perceived my propranolol but it didn’t really help. I only see the doc every like 6 months cause it’s impossible to get an appointment :( How do you function? I wanna punch someone when I’ve got a headache and no one even realizes my brain is freaking melting. It’s so weird cause some days I feel great and others I can barely function.

skyrimmods,fe6jlpe,t1_fe6j1vx,1578893016.0,I would be surprised as that much extensive animation changes plus if there is any scripting it’s likely gonna use skate imo. Someone may have a better idea than me tho. :)
HumansBeingBros,fdwe0aj,t1_fdtry11,1578757733.0,That’s plus a name would be enough for emergency services. Also you can get far more detail than just a city.
HumansBeingBros,fdtdify,t1_fdsh3vl,1578715206.0,Also if they were chatting it’s incredibly easy to figure out an IP address.

CodingHelp,fdny0bc,t3_ema8ke,1578595145.0,Try using a long as its 64bits as opposed to an int. Mod can be used to reduce the number while keeping the equal proportionally.

CodingHelp,fc08si3,t3_efgr6g,1577283255.0,You need to define the scanner in the method signature as it is being passed.  Ie public static void birthday(Scanner input){
UNCCharlotte,fb9t1n5,t3_ec78dw,1576648794.0,I really enjoyed Dr. Cao’s class.
