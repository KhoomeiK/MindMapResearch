darknet,ff92jj3,t1_ff8vwk8,1579703263.0,"I completely agree and uniformed people should not use them or give them to their pets. Not to mention, there's many different spectrums of antibiotics that treat different ailments. Drs make money prescribing them and hand them out like candy, even for issues Ike viruses, which only helps secondary issues caused by the virus but doesn't eliminate the virus. They also give them out for a peace of mind, all which are wrong.

However, they're good to have on hand for emergencies, if you know what you're doing. Much like steroids NSAIDs and many other meds, you don't want to overuse because there can be bad consequences and they build up resistance to antibiotics and steroids and with NSAIDs a tolerance and high doses are bad for the liver and other internal orgsns. Without giving too much personal info away, I'm very educated in medicine. I don't think people who aren't educated on the various drugs should even try to use them, thus they're behind the counter. However, if you know what you're doing, know how to properly diagnose issues, it's a huge money saver to have them on hand."

Second, does your dog have bad teeth caked with plaque and tartar? ToothÂ root abscesses may erupt into the nasal passages, causingÂ reverse sneezing.Â Or it's not reverse sneezing and could be symptoms of a collapsing trachea. Collapsing trachea noises can sometimes sound like reverse sneezes.

Start off with Benadryl to see if that helps. If it doesn't after a few days, go to the vet and have them check out your dogs mouth. If that's clear, get an x-ray done. It will show if your pup has a collapsing trachea. Good luck!

dogs,ff3bd60,t1_ff2h0do,1579537853.0,"I'm not arguing with you too. I put my original post to try to help someone and a dog, based on her description of the dog. You have the right to your own opinion. I don't disagree with a lot of what you said but, I'm talking about this specific case. An 18 month period is plenty of enough time to assess whether or not a dog had an alternate, negative personality. Also, I wasn't lumping all shelter dogs into one. They're all different. I was trying to point out the potential positives from the dog's long term exposure to living in a shelter. I'm not saying shelters are the best places to socialize dogs by any means. They can be hectic and cause anxiety and other potential behavior issues but, different dogs react to that differently to shelters. I've seen every type of shelter and rescue on can see, the past 17 years.

I work with multiple animal rescue groups, personally have had many fosters from shelters as well. Whether the shelter shaped their personalities is impossible to tell. Any regulated shelter has a legal obligation to disclose any potential aggressive tendencies the dog may have, before releasing them into ones custody. Again, some may react negativity in a different environment but, this particular dog sounds very docile. The most common negative behavior I've noticed when they leave the shelter is anxiety and need for attention. Anxiety can cause fear aggression but, in this case this dog doesn't sound very anxious. 

I 100% support her adopting this dog."

Its really hard to get the internal sutures or he'd need to be seen now. I can't really tell by the picture but, typically, if he got the internal ones open, it would be bleeding and could be serious. As long as you get him into the vet tomorrow morning, he'll be just fine. If I were you I'd sleep next to him all night to prevent him from doing further damage. Luckily there's no bleeding or else the situation could immediately life-threatening. Good luck! Please update us all tomorrow."

dogs,ff26ipo,t1_ff231ts,1579495206.0,"Wow! You're very ignorant! You're also absolutely clueless about dogs. I never said being in a kennel was an ideal situation for a dog but, they do typically become socialized in an atmosphere like that. Especially at a no kill shelter. Dogs are my life. I've worked in the animal industry for 17 years and judging by her description of the dog, it doesn't sound like this dog is going to hurt or kill anyone any time soon. Socializing a dog, simply means that they have been exposed to many other dogs and people. I'm not sure if you knew this but shelters have many other dogs and have a variety off staff with different people coming through the shelter to meet the dogs. The different staff members take them out of their cage a few times a day and just sniffing another dog, is socializing. Being in the same room with other dogs for an extended period of time is socializing. Meeting all of the various people and staff, the dog was been socializing with human beings. They don't just throw them in solitary confinement and throw food in there every now and then. 

An unsocialized dog would be if they had zero interaction with either or human beings or other dogs. Not to mention, if this dog had an aggressive bone in his body, the shelter would have said something about it. Typically, most shelters won't put up with aggressive or dangerous dogs. Even non kill shelters, secretly put dangerous dogs down. It's too much of a risk for the staff to keep them. If that dog was aggressive at all, he wouldn't still be there after 18 months. 

That probably didn't make sense to you but I know that I'm 100% correct."
dogs,ff24g1v,t3_er6wwl,1579493533.0,"Did he rip the sutures out? They're probably going to have to put him under again to resuture. Has there been any bleeding? Also looks like the surgery vet may have done a half ass job. That and the fact that he's been licking at it, means he definitely needs to be seen tomorrow and will atleast need antibiotics, if he's not already on them. It's going to be difficult but roll him up semi tightly like a burrito with a blanket or towel, with his head poking out so he can breathe and hold onto him all night. That will make it easier to restrain him so he can't lick at the incision. Obviously let him free to go to the bathroom. If you decide to do that, he'll struggle at first but, once he realizes he can't move, he'll give in. That's an old restraining trick for cats and small dogs, they use at the vet. Then you'll get a traditional e collar at the vet tomorrow. That probably sounds pretty bad but, I don't see any other way you'll keep him from licking at it tonight, unless Walmart is near your house and sells plastic e collars.  Fyi, i used to be a licensed vet tech and that's pretty bad but I've seen worse and they turned out ok."

depression,ff1yt4y,t3_eqz653,1579489320.0,"I know something that helps!

I've dealt with severe depression ever since I can remember. My mom was severely depressed when I was in her womb, and I think it rubbed off onto me. I was also neglected and physically abused by my older brothers as a child. I played football for 15 years and after countless concussions, I  guarantee I have CTE, which makes it even worse. I have no friends, live alone and don't have any social interaction. I'm completely isolated. All that compounded with my many other problems, ive been pretty bad off too.

First off, I didn't stop taking my meds so, don't do that. I highly recommend meditation. I started meditation atleast a half hour every day, a year ago. After about a month, I started feeling better and it only increased from there.  It's easier said than done but meditation is the only thing I feel that has truly worked for me. It re trains your mind and teaches you to clear out all of the bad, worrying and negative in your head. You need to stay consistent with it and it's hard to keep focused at first, especially if you have adhd, like I do. In a way it's similar to cognitive brain therapy only not boring. If you haven't tried it, it won't hurt to give it a shot. I guarantee improvement with your depression if you do it for a few weeks. Start with guided meditation. Just YouTube""guided meditation"" and they will walk you through what to do. Just find a voice that's the most soothing to you. It's also ok if you fall asleep.

dogs,ff0lpzm,t3_er09c4,1579470076.0,"I wouldn't worry about him being in the shelter. Being around that many different dogs and people, he's likely more socialized and gets along great with other dogs and people. I'm also guessing that he didn't get much individual attention, except for short periods of time, a few times a day. Having the much lack of attention over 18 months, he's looking likely going to be starving for attention when you bring him home and so happy to have a loving owner. Don't be overwhelmed if he seems extra needy at first. Once he gets settled in and realizes that he has an actual stable home, he'll likely become a little more independent. Plus, if you do a trial, understand he's been essentially locked up for 18 months so he could extra hyper, or extra nervous at first so give him some time to show his true colors. I think it sounds like you found a good pup. 

As for him being 5, that's a huge plus! He's already potty trained and you don't need to worry about him chewing things up and eating random things. Also, considering he was at a kennel, you already have a crate trained dog, which makes for low maintenance, especially while you're at work. Not to mention 5y is still relatively young so you'll have plenty of years ahead with him. 

As for introducing him to your other dog, make sure no food, treats or toys are around when they first meet and don't let either dog claim you. Some dogs will try to claim you and or objects when they first meet other dogs. You don't want that because they could get off on the wrong foot. Once they get to know each other, they'll be fine.

Let's say only gun owners in VA represent every 2A supporter in Virginia. There's obviously a lot more supporters oh, you don't have guns but, there's no numbers for that. There's about 8.6 million Virginians. About 29% of Virginians own guns. That means that about 2.5 million Virginians own guns.

In Charlottesville in 2017 the alt right tried to come with everyone they could get. They were represented by hate group activists from 39 different states. 11 of the hate groups there were from Virginia. This was the biggest alt right rally in a decade! The total turnout of alt right activists was approximately a whopping number of 600 people lol. Let's pretend all 600 were from Virginia and ignore the 39 other states involved. Let's also pretend half of the members from those 11 hate groups didn't show. There's about 22 alt right hate groups in VA. So only half of the groups participated in Charlottesville. That would that be 600Ã—2Ã—2 for a total of 2,400 alt right members in the state of Virginia. Let's give them 100 more people for the sake of easier math to 2,500. 

2,500 of 2,500,000 is 0.1%. That's still an incredibly small percentage of people compared to the rest of us. So, when those jackass's show up, the libs are going to pretend like they're the majority. That's all I was getting at."

Its actually used as an intestinal antibiotic for dogs, that helps with diarrhea and it's called metronidazole. Thanks for checking! I appreciate it! I'd like to have it on hand for all my dogs."

VCDL Lobby Day is a peaceful event about gun rights and NOTHING ELSE


We are NOT there to have arguments with the other side.Â  They lobby, we lobby, and never the two shall meet. Just ignore them.


And we are not there to push any other agenda.Â  Our total focus is on protecting our right to keep and bear arms.Â  Period. This is not about flags, statues, history, etc. Just guns.


If you somehow find yourself being harassed by the other side, don't engage them.Â  They could well be baiting you and recording what you do for propaganda purposes. If necessary, go find a police officer and let them take care of the person causing the disturbance.Â  Otherwise, just ignore them and go about your business.


VCDL has a great relationship with the Capitol Police, the Richmond Police, the Virginia State Police, and most other law enforcement agencies in the Commonwealth.Â  We welcome their presence and are glad they are there to keep everything peaceful, while we work on the job at hand.

-

This should be a great event, with freedom-loving Americans from all walks of life standing should-to-should to protect our most precious civil right - the right of self-defense.Â  See you there!

Virginia,fem87vk,t3_epqnni,1579243306.0,"I just wanted to point out a few things. The idiot white supremacists/far right hate groups make up  less than 0.1% of the supporters of the second amendment in Virginia.(I took the time to research and do the approximate math) They are in no way, shape or form representatives of us who support 2A. They are a disgrace to the cause and would be better off not showing up to the event. The liberal media is already trying to group us all together, which is very incorrect.

Anyone who thinks that bringing a firearm to Lobby Day helps the cause, are complete morons as well. First off, there's going to be tight security and you'll get in a lot of trouble, when you get arrested. Second, the liberal media is foaming at the mouth to get supporters on video, getting arrested and documenting it for the world to see. Bringing guns, which are banned from the event, plays right into the democrat agenda. They will then portray all of us as bad guys because a few idiots wanted to be tough guys.

In the long run, the Democrats in power are using these gun restrictions as means to control the people, especially for when they try to pass other outrageous laws through, in the near future. As for Lobby Day, they want us to bring our guns into Richmond so we can look bad and justify their laws.

I really think Northam wasted our tax dollars and declared a state of emergency to anger and provoke supporters of 2A into breaking the rules. I'd like to see proof that there were really serious threats. They won't show us proof or name names. I also wonder why they didn't release the names and details of the white supremacists the FBI arrested, who were supposedly going to cause problems at the Lobby. The liberal media could easily make up the story that these people had intentions of going to Richmond for the event. They could and will claim that any other criminals who get arrested over the weekend, were planning on going to Richmond in support of 2A.

Fyi, this isn't a protest. It's a lobby. The protesters will be the antifa affiliated people, trying to provoke us. They really who have no business being there, other than to cause violence. Antifa and the white supremacists should go meet somewhere else, away from the rest of us law abiding citizens, so we can discuss and debate the issues in a civilized manner. Problem solved.

The main organizers of this lobbying event are the VCDL. The following post is a statement from the president of VCDL, from earlier today and is a true representation of how 99.9% of the 2A supporters are going to approach Monday in Richmond."

I'm talking like to buy antibiotics and other meds that should be over the counter anyways. My friend has tried ordering antibiotics for his dog multiple times from ""Canadian"" pharmacies and they were all scams. Please pm me, if you do."
darknet,fem0ozu,t3_epnxct,1579236002.0,"There's definitely going to be a market for vape products. Especially since more and more states keep banning flavors. Although, I think it will be much more profitable, safer and easier for the vendors to just make flavored vape juice  than re sell cartridges, pods or e cigs. Just order a mod & tank online, then you're ready for your ejuice. You'll like that more, I promise. Way better than pods and e cigs. 

Not to mention, the risk vs reward of selling and shipping nicotine as opposed to other stuff sold on the dn wouldn't compare. I wonder what the penalty is for shipping nicotine accross state lines is. 

There's going to be more and more demand for e juice as the year unfolds. Vendors will start to realize the profits they could make. The smart ones will get in on it early. The proper/safe ingredients, equipment and safe instructions how to make it is online. My buddy already makes his own and it's pretty easy to make and cheap. The hardest part is measuring the few components needed. I'm sure there will also be shady f*""k$ out there making improper stuff but, it will be obvious by reputation. You would just need to be very careful. That's my take on it.

Just a disclaimer: My opinion is for adults who already vaped, who can't vape anymore because  their state laws banned flavors. Also for those who don't want to get hooked on cigarettes instead, which is what's happening. Cigarettes are far worse for you than vaping."

The Democrats have a lot more plans ahead as well, and they know that if we give an inch of our rights, they'll take a mile of our rights.

gunpolitics,feih11b,t1_fegrwpr,1579138340.0,"It's not just Democrats from DC. We have a lot of Dems transplanted from other states and countries too. I've been in NoVa my entire life, excluding 4 years going to WVU. These days, it's hard to find any other native Virginian in NoVa. I guarantee that if you went to a NoVa area grocery store in any of the local cities, 9 out of 10 people are originally from different states or countries. It makes me sick, how much this area has changed the past couple decades. Around here, I can't even say I'm a Republican, without being scrutinized, called a racist or even threatened. Me as well as most of the other Republicans in Northern Virginia just have to stay silent about our political views. 

God bless West Virginia and Go Mountaineers!"

I'm almost positive their customer service representatives are in India. They keep freezing my account to reconfirm my address. This has happened 6 times and no one is fixing the issue. I've had many other issues with them too. They love to lie, just to get off the phone with me. The worst lie I was told, almost put me out of business. It's a long story but, my business is based out of my home and I recently moved. My service area is where I used to live. The GMB guy told me that what you list in the ""service areas"" part is what dictates your Google location search and it's not where your business is actually located(mine is currently located at my house, away from my service areas). I figured out the hard way that it's all about where my business is located. My business went from showing up top 3 on the first page to not showing up at all, if you search my service areas.

gunpolitics,fecl5wl,t1_fec1wrk,1578976617.0,"Being a Virginian my entire life, I personally feel very helpless, sad, frustrated and angry to see this all unfolding. What a lot of people don't realize is that Northern Virginia dictates the what happens for the rest of the state. I live in NoVa and Its a totally different entity than the rest of VA. Most residents outside of NoVa, are second amendment supporting Republicans. It wasn't always so liberal in NoVa. Unfortunately, Northern Virginia(Mainly Fairfax and Loudoun counties) have most of the state money and most of the voters. It has become very liberal as of the past couple decades. Adding salt to the wound, a huge portion of these Northern Va liberals are transplants from other states. Being located where NoVA is, there's obviously a lot of government associated jobs. Most of them haven't been here long, and or aren't here for the long haul, yet are taking over.

If Northern Virginia was cut out of the picture, our state would never be in this predicament and I'd gladly move down south. We're completely f#@&ed. I think our state is going to s#!t. Hopefully the rest of the country sees the future disaster of our soon to be communist state and don't follow our example. I'd hate to see this plague hit the federal level too. Commonwealth my ass. Why wouldn't a picture ID be required to vote. How shady is that?!? Sorry for the ranting but, I'm sure a lot of other people can relate.

I forgot to mention the incredible amount of illegal immigrants we have living in Nova. I think the Dems are working out a plan to get them to be able to vote too."

I'm going to decide within the next few days. There's a lot more factors I have to consider but, my post was already too long. One other question I have in regards to some of my competitors. When you search plumbing in that city, 6 out of the top 10 listings have virtual mailboxes or virtual offices. I figured that out because I recognized the addresses because I was considering doing the same. Would it be unethical for me to report those people to Google? I've been in the area longer than all of them and a few of them definitely copied the format, pricing and ideas from my website. It would knock off some competition but, I can't decide if it's the wrong thing to do."
