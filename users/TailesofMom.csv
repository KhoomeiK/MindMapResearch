news,ffak7kx,t1_ffaf1x4,1579737789.0,"Retroactively revoking citizenship of innocent kids isn't the right thing to do. You can't just kick a kid out when its grown up its entire life in America. It isn't ideal to kick the parents out either as the kid would lose their family and be thrown into foster care. 

Comming here to have 'anchor babies' isn't the right thing to do, but neither is refusing admittance because a woman is pregnant."
ChoosingBeggars,fewjo2t,t1_few8j1z,1579412000.0,"Pro tip for those who cant afford disposable diapers or the upfront cost of nice cloth diapers. 

Make your own cloth diapers. A pre fold is so easy to make. You can use old clothes and sew them together. It wont be pinterest pretty but it will be functional."
ChoosingBeggars,fewienl,t1_fev3mot,1579411161.0,"To add on to this, each store has their own sku. So like,  don't buy huggies from Kroger and try to return them to Walmart.  The bar code isn't the same and sometimes they have different diaper counts. (For example, kroger might sell a pack wth 115 and walmart sells 117.) I noticed this when shopping online for the best price."
ChoosingBeggars,fewh63u,t1_feu62xk,1579410510.0,"Potty training underwear. Basically underwear with a thicker crotch. I personally did the 3 day method. (Basically let your kid be naked until he understands how to control his pee and put it in the potty.) I continued to buy diapers because they are cheaper than pull ups for nighttime use. 

The only downside is how much it sucks to clean when they poop in the training underwear."

AskReddit,fcv1tqj,t3_eipzwh,1577992884.0,"I was driving down the road and I was thinking about putting air in my tire and checking the oil after running my errand. (My car had a slow oil leak and I carried extra oil in my car all the time.) I turn my attention to the radio which was playing an ad. I guess it was about oil changes or something. The only part I heard was, 'Make sure you take good care of your car and it will take care of you!' 

POP! My tire exploded and I pulled over. Pieces of plastic in the middle of the road. I swear I didn't run over anything. 

It was probably a well timed coincidence, but 18 year old me was pretty freaked and checked my tires every stop for months."
JUSTNOMIL,fcsplmk,t3_ei65gt,1577921901.0,"Ugh! I didn't lose my baby weight from my 2nd child so I've got a serious mom pouch. Hadn't seen my mom in like 6 months and the first thing she asks is, ""Oh! Do we have another baby comming?"" While patting my belly fat. 

No mom I'm just fat. Thanks."

todayilearned,fc6wycz,t1_fc6sjvn,1577491630.0,"I said there are about 3 exonerations every week. I did not specify that there were 3 weekly death row exonerations.

You are being too simple minded about life in prison vs death penalty. Yes it may be more expensive to feed, clothe and provide medical assistance to an inmate for 70 years vs shooting a guy in the head with a 12 cent bullet, but this isn't the wild west. You can't just hang or shoot a man.

We have courts and laws where even a bad man has options. To put someone on death row you have to go through a legal system. A very expensive legal system. The expensive legal system makes it more costly to have an inmate on death row vs life in prison."
todayilearned,fc6cqw1,t1_fc6bdz6,1577477507.0,Court costs. The actual execution itself isn't expensive. Going to court for months to get a person sentenced to death is what makes the cost much higher than your average life in prison inmate.
todayilearned,fc63bnt,t1_fc616do,1577471318.0,"Fact: Life in prison is actually cheaper than the death penalty. 

Opinion: I'd personally prefer life in prison for convicts as a guilty person has to live every day with what they've done.

Opinion: I also prefer a life sentence because of innocent people thrown in jail. Did you know about 3 people get exonerated per week? Innocent people should have every chance to be freed."
