fatlogic,ffd16z1,t1_ffbzmte,1579811392.0,"it's muscle.  but not just having less naturally, they make choices that make them even less muscular.

women are more likely to choose a diet plan that reduces their already small amount of muscle.  like going vegetarian or vegan.

and women largely refuse weight training (and, frankly, any gym time that doesn't involve an instructor)"

todayilearned,ff9brmh,t1_ff8mfwv,1579709355.0,"beyond appearances he's basically just a normal dude.  he also cuts hair at a place downtown on Spring Street, which is where I see him several times a week just walking around or out at bars sometimes.

the first time I ever saw him is when I got my haircut by him.  I walked into the barber shop and he wasn't visible.  I put my name on the list and when they took me around the corner to his chair I was shocked.  I don't like clowns.

but his demeanor and mannerisms are completely non-aggressive and non-threatening and that's obvious within four seconds of talking to him.  so it was no big deal.

I shave my head bald now otherwise I might still go to him."

todayilearned,ff5wer8,t1_ff5ssrr,1579612506.0,"no but being on the phone constantly wasn't as much of a thing, many people still didn't have smart phones, most people who did still had a separate iPod for music bc phones had no storage, most ppl facebooked from a desktop, Instagram was in infancy and not popular among adults, it was WAY different back then.

we were still largely focused on communicating with the friends we were with."
