servant,fdxhz1j,t1_fdvnic8,1578768838.0,i thought he was trying to scare Leanne in the fish scene.
servant,fdkwuw4,t1_fdkwn4f,1578512811.0,i’m hoping it isn’t either not sure i can stomach the idea of that. honestly the theory about Dorothy drowning the baby and then putting him in the dryer to ‘dry him off’ is sticking with me and i’m hoping that’s not the case either. honestly any way of death is just so horrible to imagine since he’s just a baby
servant,fdkwaoa,t1_fdkvwbn,1578512481.0,"well, they definitely make it seem that way. not sure if they even flat out say it but what are the odds that a news reporters baby dies and literally no one knows? that seems improbable. there would be ambulances outside. there would be police questioning and it would turn into and investigation likely. i don’t see that not turning up in the news. that leads me to believe they covered it up."
servant,fdkv0tb,t1_fdkurql,1578511728.0,"that’s is super interesting. i guess my mind just went to the first most normal thing of it being sean, but this show has proven to be anything but normal lmao."
servant,fdktn6q,t1_fdkdx49,1578510912.0,for a lot of people collecting wine is a hobby really. like how some people collect coins or stamps or little trinkets.
servant,fdkt19d,t1_fdkmrv8,1578510549.0,he was there the next morning though? i was under the assumption he came home that night.
servant,fdksota,t3_elvrpk,1578510345.0,why would they cover it up in that case?
servant,fdhx5re,t3_elhs4w,1578431764.0,interesting theory!! i didn’t think about that but it actually is a pretty good theory
servant,fddyzs6,t1_fddddrh,1578327389.0,that’s how she met dorothy. could be some significance there.
servant,fdbydqi,t1_fd7rgdc,1578263803.0,also leanne was in pageants

raisedbynarcissists,fd73wuc,t1_fd6sadv,1578199108.0,"thank you, i really struggle with feeling responsible for his actions but i’m trying to work on it in therapy right now. i’m kind of new to learning exactly what qualifies as abuse because my whole life i’ve genuinely believed that’s how all dads are. it’s helped a lot to look over this subreddit and see that other people have experienced similar things and seeing that it also hurts other people. It’s really helping me show myself that i’m not just “too sensitive” and that this kind of abuse is a real thing. he’s so good at manipulating he has me second guessing my own thoughts."
SneakySasquatch,fct6h04,t1_fcn1w1h,1577934127.0,"i meant for the large and small house upgrade, but yeah even so that’s kind of an over estimate. it really does feel like so many 😅"

SneakySasquatch,fcp9we6,t1_fcp8xhf,1577855557.0,thank you so much!! it was the last fish i had to catch and i finally caught it thanks to you! happy new year!!
SneakySasquatch,fcp8mr1,t3_eicefg,1577854166.0,how do you find goldfish?? i’ve been trying for so long and haven’t found a single goldfish yet
SneakySasquatch,fcmwh68,t3_ei1yoj,1577795414.0,"it depends where you are in the game. the construction ducks build your house. if you don’t know what i’m talking about then you probably haven’t gotten that far yet. when you do though, you can exit your house through the shortcut the ducks build and turn right and you will see the ducks. you will need to go to the saw mill first though (go to the ski mountain and when you are driving you should see a little side road and a sign that says sawmill. you will need a truck for that part.) most of the furniture can’t be purchased until the large house, which you will in total need about 700 boards i think, maybe 800."
