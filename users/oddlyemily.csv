cats,ff372ms,t3_ereu0s,1579535239.0,Oh lord I have no idea. One issue I had with my cat was that he was missing the box when he peed even though it‚Äôs big box- he‚Äôd spray the wall behind him. Super gross. So I got a covered litter box and all is well now. Maybe a covered box would make him more comfortable?
MakeupAddiction,fetskha,t3_eqlg8a,1579379562.0,Omg you are beautiful!
college,femtgdy,t3_eq0kwi,1579269123.0,"Tuition remains the same for any amount of credits between 12-19 at my school, it is probably the same at yours. 12 credits is considered full time so that‚Äôs the base amount of tuition you pay"
AmItheAsshole,fem1ptw,t1_fem1n6a,1579236900.0,Yeah I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm sticking with YTA. I could see how you had good intentions but then having your dad lie about how he got the info makes it worse. I‚Äôm sure you can fix things with your brother just give him some time
AmItheAsshole,fem1f1l,t1_fem1bj1,1579236636.0,"No I‚Äôm asking why didn‚Äôt you ask your brother though? Like yes that‚Äôs what your mom said but you said you tried to speak for your brother, when couldn‚Äôt you of just asked your brother if you could give out his info first? 
you also could‚Äôve given him a heads up- and not just wait a week for your dad to reach out."
AmItheAsshole,fem12z0,t3_epvk0z,1579236337.0,"did you ask your brother if you could give out his information? If not why didn‚Äôt you? 

If you didn‚Äôt, YTA"
MakeupAddiction,fdu8mv0,t1_fdu8hb5,1578729479.0,You‚Äôre very welcome! I also really love the benefit lash primer. It looks good on its own for a really natural look (like just brows and the primer) but it works wonders under mascara
MakeupAddiction,fdu86tt,t3_en4ka3,1578729268.0,Love the shadow!! I recommend maybe trying a darker mascara or another coat :)
lanadelrey,fdou9p5,t3_emftks,1578613016.0,I think it‚Äôs in the national anthem music video where she‚Äôs speaking as Jackie :) after someone commented that I looked it up it‚Äôs very similar

college,fdb59t2,t3_eki03r,1578253969.0,Depends on how it‚Äôs weighted
Makeup,fd6j13l,t1_fd6ii7l,1578191785.0,I‚Äôve never thought of this!! I put it on right before bed typically :)
Makeup,fd4x0y0,t1_fd4wr6t,1578171883.0,I have the original pink one! It‚Äôs a pretty light scent I‚Äôd say maybe a rose scent
cats,fd4tfoe,t3_ek1xwk,1578170915.0,MY CAT DOES THIS he freaks out! He also doesn‚Äôt like if I talk on the phone while in the tub lol
Makeup,fd4silc,t3_ek2231,1578170712.0,I love the laniege lip sleeping mask! It‚Äôs amazing and you could use it throughout the day as well as a balm :) it‚Äôs $20 but honestly it comes with so much I haven‚Äôt even made a dent in mine

BodyPositive,fcrphih,t1_fcr5j3v,1577904875.0,"Honestly I‚Äôm not too sure on where I‚Äôm starting yet either. I am sick of hating the way I look in clothes and feeling like shit most of the time :(
In the past when I‚Äôve tried to make healthier moves I‚Äôve been way too strict on myself and I never succeed. I think I‚Äôm gonna start out slow- maybe take my dog on walks when it‚Äôs nice out (makes him so happy!!) and cut back on fast food. 

I‚Äôm not one for resolutions because I find them hard to stick to sometimes but one of my goals is to cut back on drinks that aren‚Äôt water, coffee or unsweet tea :)

I wish you the best of luck, and i know it‚Äôs so hard to find self love. I had a lot of difficulty throughout my childhood which makes it hard to love myself to this day. 

Feel free to PM me anytime and happy new year :)"

AmItheAsshole,fcp88y2,t3_eie1kg,1577853781.0,yes YTA because it‚Äôs considered return fraud lol
ChoosingBeggars,fcnwah4,t1_fcnsaa0,1577819721.0,Exactly. I didn‚Äôt even think of the struggle to keep everything else cold
beauty,fcnqb9t,t3_ei6a8s,1577816420.0,I sometimes even just use a lash primer on my lower lash line :) if your set on using this mascara they sell individual wands at Walmart really cheap. Maybe buy a pack and use the small ones to apply specifically on lower lash line. You can even reuse the applicator if you just wash it off!
ChoosingBeggars,fcnp15f,t3_ei6e7g,1577815711.0,"To play devils advocate though I feel like this is fair since they tried fixing it once and it‚Äôs not working again 3 months later, it‚Äôs gotta suck not having readily access to a working fridge for almost 10 days especially if you have to keep antibiotics cold"

MakeupAddiction,fccjb5y,t1_fcbtug8,1577599048.0,I tend to find I can get my brows more defined/sharp but still with a natural look after blending it out with the Anastasia pomade!!

Lumineers,fcasae3,t1_fcas97y,1577575629.0,Thank you so much :)
AmItheAsshole,fcadq3g,t3_egw7tn,1577567489.0,"NAH if you check with the bride and she‚Äôs okay with it. It‚Äôs your best friend! My sister got married this past year and I wouldn‚Äôt of missed it for the world. I think you should be okay with the antibiotics in your system, especially with how it‚Äôs only a four hour difference between the doctors orders and the wedding. Drink lots of water and get as much rest as you can between now and then and see how you feel :)
Also if you do end up going- probably don‚Äôt drink because of the antibiotics!! Feel better ‚ù§Ô∏è"
