Akali has been a living hell for months because of her mobiltiy. Garen e should be nerfed because he is way too tanky to just press E and clear a full wave at level 5. Vladimir is a nightmare because he scales so easily from cheap items that allow him to become a monster same with rumble. Rumble is broken right now mostly because he deals way too much damage early from buying cheap items. The difference between the cheap ad items and the cheap ap items is that the cheap ad items need to be built with something else to be good. If somebody buys GA first hes an idiot. If somebody buys rilays first, hes fine. 

The champions that are perma banned and mostly hated from the community are champions that share the logics that you deem too simple."

But honestly if someone is mad at me in Aram, Normals, URF, etc. I could not give a fuck. I am also not gonna play with them again or mute them on VOIP. I do a lot of games in a week with people I dont necessarly know but that are friends of friends and I have never really had anybody be toxic in games outside of ranked in years.

Obviously if its a ranked game, I am expecting toxicity, rage and disapointment so I am not too concerned if they get mad in those games. Usually we just stop after that.

I try to separate my ranked people with my chilling people. The people I ranked with are people that have chemistry in my playstyle, the same rank as me and that I wanna tryhard with and the people I chill with are people from various ranks from challenger to iron that I play 5men 10men, etc with. I am Plat 1 so I expect people to be bad in my chilling games and most of the times if they do stupid shit, stupid builds, stupid plays, Ill call them out but mainly because I find it hilarious and I dont understand how someone could play this way. Its mostly as a joke and not flame tho and they understand it. I am also very bad so I expect people to laugh at my bad plays too.

Maybe next time to lighten up the mood, tell him you were trying to hook his mother and she has a big hitbox so you dont know how you missed, or something, joke and see what happens, if hes mad dont play with him ever again."
summonerschool,ff2jwib,t1_ff2iu78,1579509494.0,if its in non ranked just ditch them. if its in ranked maybe you should drop ranking with people that are far higher than you. speak about it with your friend and see what she thinks.

As long as everybody knows boundaries you are all good. Two of my friends have very heavy boundaries as in you cant make much fun of them before they take it personally so it just usually ends up being the two same people that get laughed at, as long as you answer back and laugh everybody understands its in good fun. One of my best mate did a poorly taste joke about my family once and I hit him in the face (but like a medium slap), he understood he crossed the line and that had it not been him it would have been a punch.

summonerschool,fehylbl,t1_fehvbiq,1579126481.0,"what you like. if you wanna be the best lee sin ever gotta start somewhere. Obviously some champions are better in low elo and some are better in high elo but theres a challenger one trick for all champions somewhere in the world so its not a good reason to not one trick champions.

the learning curve is just slower on some champions and mastering that champion is harder for some.

I was hardstuck silver on tryn for 3 months before I started climbing. I was platinum 3 on malzahar at the same time on my main so you just gotta watch people play that champion, watch streams, watch educational videos and just climb some day. 

dont rush about your rank, mastering your champion is way more important.

the day you think you know everything about your champion, about every matchups, etc. get some coaching advice by someone who masters that champion and learn again. its really the fun about it.

my best advice is to watch a player of your champion in two elo higher so if you are silver watch platinum. dont watch challenger because they are too pure and people make too few mistakes so it seems like they are passive all game but they are not.

and twithc jungle is in a bad place right now, would not recommend climbing with this (according to tarzaned)

Another exemple, when can you allin riven? when her Qs or stun is out.

when can you allin renekton? if he wastes his dash on minions, or if he double dash into you, look to allin. etc. etc. it depends of your champion and their champion, money, items, etc. but basically you ought to create yourself rules of thumb against different matchups and with different situations!"

You will have a huge learning experience to do because when you play your first ranked you will see how far behind you are. Its just the hard reality. You are gonna have to learn so many things that the champion you are doing it on is not really indicative of anything. Play teemo if you like but its one of the few toplanes that makes you learn bad habits that a melee champion would not.
