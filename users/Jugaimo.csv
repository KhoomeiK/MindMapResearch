shittydarksouls,ff6g5hk,t1_ff6elyv,1579626476.0,"The game states that those with red eyes were given enhanced strength through the power of the fountainhead waters. Dr. Dogan, who you meet within the dungeons, is one of many people within Ashina who were experimenting with the effects of the waters on people.

All the withered corpses within the dungeons are people who were cursed with immortality through experiments with the waters, but are failed experiments. It can then be assumed that the ogres are people who were successful experiments.

Ashina’s red-eyed warriors were known throughout Japan and were the reason why they were the last kingdom to fall to the Interior Ministry’s reunification effort. The Ministry even brought fire weapons that would work specifically on these enhanced warriors.

Bukkake was so powerful in Ashina that it took all of Japan to fight against it."

Cringetopia,fe0fu8h,t1_fdzdi7g,1578812722.0,Furries were never about innocent animal caricatures though. They were always intended to be an outlet for sexual degeneracy. There’s a great video by “intotherabbithole” about the origin of furries.

Preferring thrills over comfort, she abandoned her studies and took to practicing mischief on estate guests. Pickpocketing unaware aristocrats and officials and slipping the stolen belongings into other people’s pockets so that conflict and entertainment might arise in her otherwise stuffy and stale environment.

The unusual cases of misplaced objects at her parents’ estate led to unkind rumors about her family and their eventual ostracism from high society. Losing her only form of entertainment, she left her ancestral home without a single thought for her parents.

Her character is more self-centered and naive in nature. She is unaware of how she might hurt others, but cares for her friends and family at the same time. Not mean in spirit but incredibly foolish."
