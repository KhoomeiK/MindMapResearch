Handwriting,ffbtenz,t3_esn7c7,1579782074.0,I’m currently in Patho as well and I wish my notes looked like this!!
nursing,ff5ea4c,t1_ff5531v,1579589199.0,Ah okay. That’s interesting. Thank you. I suppose they’ve just not gotten to that part yet. All we’ve covered in always do your hand hygiene and all about PPE but not gotten into finer details like that. Just starting patho now so I am sure it will be mentioned.
nursing,ff51ja9,t1_ff4zdbs,1579577719.0,"I mean, I am currently just a student, but we just covered how rings, watches, long nails and the like ARE a reason for spread."
nursing,ff51daf,t1_ff3ofcq,1579577594.0,"I agree and my reasons for that are just simply the effectiveness, or rather lack thereof, of the flu vaccine. It’s just not at all to par with the main vaccines, and never will be."
uncharted,ff4p23i,t3_erjlmd,1579569008.0,One of my favourite games. Nice work!
Old_Recipes,fewmz1y,t3_eqlnjq,1579415204.0,"I have this too, a 1912 edition. I love it. Such a great addition to my collection :)"
MadeMeSmile,felgnfu,t1_feio5r3,1579221726.0,"Oh I love to hear that!! I am a nursing student who, previous to starting school this year, was a daycare teacher for many years, and so I take it upon myself to learn about things like this. I was amazed when I first heard of this surgery years ago and I can only imagine the improvement to quality of life this gives. I LOVE that he is able to to TKD (I also was in TKD myself!) Sounds like he is doing just amazing! What a fighter ❤️"
MadeMeSmile,fei8wal,t1_fehjarb,1579132897.0,"Is rotationplasty the type where they make the ankle joint into the knee by turning the foot around? Either way, your son sounds like an awesome kid and I am glad he is doing so well!!"
fo76,fefrcex,t3_eotnls,1579062959.0,I’ve gotten that with my survival tent in the same area. I had to move it a little further down and could no longer place it as close as I had before. That started a couple weeks ago.
Cooking,feezxda,t1_feer70p,1579044932.0,But... they smell very different. Very different. Smell them first and you won’t do it again.
Reduction,fec00uy,t3_eoce6u,1578964776.0,Right away. I had zero issues. I didn’t need medications either. It was a really easy surgery and recovery. I went back to work as a daycare teacher a week after.
fallout76settlements,feawfz1,t3_eo8k86,1578952884.0,Thank you!! This is amazing!!
StudentNurse,fe6a0qa,t3_enxmj8,1578885135.0,"As a mom previously and now a nursing student, I am glad I didn’t have my baby or young child while in school. Wait until you are finished school so you can devote time to enjoying your pregnancy and baby imo. You don’t get the time with them back."
Cooking,fdzehqj,t3_enclpa,1578789445.0,Thank you so much!! Thai food is my fave
fo76FilthyCasuals,fdz4fdi,t3_end0xv,1578786603.0,"My fave is Bob, the vendor in Flatwoods. He’s the nicest and so polite. :)"
Old_Recipes,fdp20cb,t3_emanfd,1578618107.0,"It probably wasn’t for her. I had notes like this written out for my son while he was learning to cook and I might not been home. Not for pasta, but many things (though he is up to making his own cheese sauces and such now!)"
wow,fdp1qke,t1_fdog584,1578617926.0,I am glad someone said it!
fo76,fdizc8v,t3_ellc76,1578454535.0,Evil. So evil. And yet you won’t steal my stuff. I’m impressed. But also I panic at being put on the spot to do math. This would not end well for me.
theouterworlds,fdic2ct,t3_elg72i,1578439535.0,"I just got the game and thought the hair colours were weird. They all show up nearly black for me, just a slight colour tinge, even when I lightened they screen. So weird."
ABraThatFits,fdatm7c,t3_ekewoi,1578249982.0,"I do because I don’t want just any old bra. I need to know the company understands the difference is design for the types. You can’t just make a bra for tiny boobs bigger and think it will work properly, and a lot of companies try that and fail. If I am shelling out for a bra, it needs to do the job."
TombRaider,fdat7hy,t1_fd9845t,1578249811.0,"I mean, a quick braid down your back take literally no time. I don’t know why so many think super long hair is so time intensive— it isn’t if you just toss it in a Lara braid. I have always had long straight hair and recently cut it to just past my shoulders and hate it because it takes more time.  And braids come undone far less than a ponytail if you have straight hair! The braid on Lara makes total sense to me."
Market76,fdagmgx,t1_fd7ts6c,1578245868.0,I’m on PS4. I’d have to give you something though! I’ve been hunting that for too long.
Market76,fd73cx8,t1_fd68mpp,1578198923.0,I’m still scared of the regular ones even though I can kill them easily now. Not looking forward to my first sighting of this!!
Market76,fd6uigc,t1_fd6t6k2,1578195880.0,"Only two weeks??! I must have the worst luck in the world. It’s been months. I got green, blue, and forest but can’t find the others."
Market76,fd6u8dg,t3_ek6374,1578195778.0,"I have been hunting red, yellow, and pink, for months! I wish I were kidding."
fo76,fd62wsd,t1_fd5kkqw,1578184805.0,Twice this week. Once was just 15 minutes ago!
fo76FilthyCasuals,fd39pbm,t3_ejtig2,1578156090.0,I love it when players do that for me! I always wish for a better “thank you” emote just because sometimes I really needed whatever they gave me. Yesterday I had been wandering by Poseidon and someone’s workshop needed defended. So I did it since I was there. The player showed up just afterwards and gave me 10 fusion cores. They had no way of knowing I had just completely run out (having lost track of the fact I’d taken all from my inventory and not replaced!). A heart emote just doesn’t quite cut it sometimes!
thisisus,fcyhzhj,t3_ejc34k,1578080497.0,"I don’t look at it so negatively. Everyone has shitty traits, no matter how well their parents did. They all have reasons for the less than wonderful stuff they are doing in the show. I think Jack and Rebecca were great parents, and like all parents, still human and not perfect. Just like the big three aren’t. That’s the whole point. Even Jack, whom everyone wants to put on a pedestal, had flaws just like anyone else."
oldrecipes,fcxu7ub,t1_fcib9tf,1578070568.0,Not by that point in time. By the beginning of 1900 it was already considered more of a delicacy.
socialanxiety,fcxp5nm,t3_eje4uk,1578068204.0,"When my social anxiety was the most severe, I had recently moved to a very large city from a small city without a subway. Well I did this, and then I sat down and cried on a bench in a panic. 🙈 Eventually I managed to get up and just cross to the other side and catch the next train, but man I hate that my anxiety makes me look like a baby."
Handwriting,fcvu8eg,t3_eiz2js,1578010221.0,"Honestly, if you sold prints of this I would jump at the chance to buy it. I love the Goonies!"
uncharted,fcgej28,t3_eh719l,1577639180.0,"I have one too. Check Etsy, Amazon. Etc. I forget where they came from originally. I think they came with the game or a book."
Nurse,fcgdx93,t3_eh5nmv,1577638968.0,"I’m not a nurse, but I am in nursing school. I don’t have a stutter but I have social anxiety that is unfortunately most severe in school like settings or when adjusting to “new”. Trying to explain to my instructors that I need extra time and that eventually I will settle in, that it just takes me longer because of my anxiety, has been my biggest challenge so far. I expect it is the same for your stutter? Once you are more used to situations, more comfort with what you are doing, it isn’t as much an issue? I think the hardest part is others make you doubt yourself, but the reality for those of us with these types of issues is that we shouldn’t be held back because it takes us longer to adjust. Sadly there are many who don’t get it and think that this will affect performance long term, and it won’t. Eventually you adjust and the thing that caused you the anxiety or stutter, lessens and then you don’t have the same problems. We just need a little more time and we shouldn’t be ignored for it."
socialanxiety,fcgbxl0,t1_fcdyt9d,1577638416.0,"Why are you trying to argue me when I basically said as much? Of course diet and exercise help— but the person has to get to a point where they can do it for it to help. And again, yes MAOI’s May work better for a majority, but everyone reacts differently. So SSRI’s aren’t shitty, they just might be shitty for you. To make a broad statement about something that might work well for someone else, and not clarify *for you* is the issue I have."
socialanxiety,fccv19a,t1_fcapotb,1577602976.0,"First you should remember that just because a medication doesn’t work for you specifically doesn’t make it a shitty med for everyone. Every body reacts differently to different meds. Second, everyone knows diet and exercise will help. The issues are that it’s not some magical cure, and that if you are very anxious and/or depressed, it’s very difficult to get into such routines without help. You can just as easily start on meds to get you to a healthier state, and then go off later. Including going back on at any point of you need the help. Or you can stay on for life. It doesn’t have to be all in or not at all. You do whatever works for you."
StudentNurse,fc07bzc,t1_fbzghnm,1577281652.0,I do that too!! 😂😂 and it’s the worst because I can so easily say “well this really needs to get done” 🤦🏼‍♀️
