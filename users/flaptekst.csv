AmItheAsshole,fclnc5r,t1_fckyg0y,1577751838.0,"Totally agree with you on the ""the younger the better"" and ""knowing from the start"" parts. Telling it from the start would definitely have been the ideal scenario. What concerns me right now is the current, quite turbulent, age of the child. Becoming a teenager, developing his character, figuring out relationships, all of those hormonal changes, it's already hard. Getting that news on top of it all seems a bit too much to handle. Learning in such times that your most closest people aren't what you thought they were, must be shocking and is probably quite devastating. I think that someone a bit older, with a bit more life experience, and sense of self, would possibly handle it better. But, of course, this is merely a speculation, and I most definitely lack expertise to offer any advice. It's a sad story really, with no shortterm winners. The best course of action right now would probably be seeking counselling, and talking to a child/youth psychologist."
AmItheAsshole,fcke821,t1_fckct9j,1577723351.0,"Why don't you tell your relatives exactly that (if you haven't already)? That you will tell him, but when he's a bit older, about 16-18. Right now he's at a difficult age, as going in to puberty can be quite hard, and I doubt that telling him right now would be beneficial. Are your relatives sensible enough to not blurt out this information without informing you first?"
