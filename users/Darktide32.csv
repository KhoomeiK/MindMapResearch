ufc,fff7kqs,t1_fff5efz,1579877712.0,"Khabib goes up to a single person with a group of other fighters and slaps them trying to get them to do something. He done it to Nate Diaz and he did it to Artem. Artem was one of McGregor's teammates, and it was Khabib that started that in the first place. There is nothing honorable about that."

WTF,ff27mkg,t3_er4v8z,1579496138.0,"On your post about the mold, that usually happens when the walls arent insulated well enough, and it causes them to ""sweat"". If you pull your bed away from the wall about 6"" on each side it should prevent more from coming, but you will have to buy mold killer or put some bleach and water in a spray bottle and clean it first. Hopefully that helps."
Philippines,fe55xs8,t3_enmrr7,1578865937.0,I hope everything is ok for you all.
Feminism,fe52pms,t3_enbza2,1578865116.0,They could definitely make a great movie out of their stories.
Feminism,fe4zmm9,t3_enpo9n,1578864262.0,But I'm really sorry that he reacted that way. But the fact that you tried and still stuck around after shows the type of person you are. The way he acted shows the type he is.
Feminism,fe4yuff,t3_enpo9n,1578864110.0,"Unfortunately this happens, and when it does, they wont admit they are wrong. My sister doesnt know hardly anything about cars, and her low pressure gauge came on, and she took it to the shop and they charged her over $200 and told her it meant she had to have a lot of things replaced. I dont know a lot about cars myself,  but I knew what the gauge  was for so I had my step dad come to the shop with my sister and I because I knew something was wrong. She told them it was wrong before she called me, but they were laughing at her and told her she didnt know what she was talking about. My step dad is a car mechanic, and he became livid when he got there. He had them fully refund her and threatened to sue them, and almost beat up the person who told her she didnt know what she was talking about.     She was really upset and wanted to know why they would do that to her, but I didnt have an answer. Not everyone is like that, and you cant let the actions of a few define the rest. I'm glad my step dad was able to get it fixed for her without it getting violent, because the last thing needed is for him to go to jail for trying to fix something that shouldnt have happened in the first place."
Feminism,fe4v6mc,t1_fdwid96,1578863107.0,"When my wife had my son, my wife was in a lot of pain (she started having contractions prior to getting the epidural), and one of the nurses and myself were helping my wife push. After my son was born they took him to clean him off and i asked them if they can give her more pain medicine. Unfortunately they couldn't but a different nurse came to stitch her up because the tears were pretty bad, and also my wife is afraid of needles so she started getting worried. The lady started stitching her laceration and looked at me and said, ""Dont worry, we will make sure its nice and tight for you"" and I basically got pissed off at her because my wife just went through the most painful things in her life, and she is so tired she can barely lift her head, and the nurse is waving around this big curved needle in her face and then talking about how she will make sure my wife is nice and tight again. The nurse then tried to have me removed from the room because I said what the hell is wrong with you and kept asking for the Doctor to try and get s different nurse.
The same nurse also stole my wedding ring (my wife was squeezing my hand so hard I had removed it and left it near the sink), but luckily when I reported it missing, one of the other nurses heard her bragging about it and reported her as well. They didnt call it the husband stitch, but it is a thing apparently. They didnt ask my wife if she wanted it, all they said was, ""ok, we are going to get you all sewed up"" and then joking about it later."

creepyPMs,fe3nw4y,t1_fe31i28,1578851195.0,"Well I sincerely apologize that someone would send that to anyone, especially when you were in a place looking for friends. If he keeps doing it, you can try reporting him. That should work. I dont know what the rules are in that group."
Needafriend,fe3m5pu,t3_em45mt,1578850584.0,"Hi Samah, I'm sorry you are going through that right now. I'm currently in the Navy, and have been for a while, and I definitely know the feeling of being away from family. It can be very hard to deal with, especially if they are having health issues. I can definitely understand the feelings that come from that. I like meeting new people from different places, and learning about their culture, and I found that language and cultural barriers are the main reason people dont initially click right away. I've been to 12 countries so far, and I was surprised at how accepting people were once the initial barrier was broken. I've been to several Middle Eastern countries,  several European,  and a few Asian countries as well, and enjoyed my time there. So I do think that even though you said you are having a hard time connecting with people, that will resolve itself. I think that if you started doing the things you already enjoy doing (you mentioned reading and writing for example), or any other hobbies you have, you will meet people with similar interests as you, which will lead to some great conversations and friendships. If that isn't something you are comfortable with, that is perfectly fine. Even here online, you will meet some awesome people. You will find the creepy ones as well, but dont let them dissuade you from being yourself. I admire people that leave their home country to go to a foreign one, because it is so much harder than most people realize. Here in the U.S., people are raised to be independent and go and do whatever, and being close to your family isn't the same as it is in other places. But if you ever want or need to talk, please feel free to message me. If I dont respond immediately,  I'm probably at work and I cant have my phone with me. The things I like to do are reading, writing, comedy, video games, anything outdoors, going to new places, working, and a few other things. I was going to college for electrical engineering, but I just recently switched commands so I had to put that on hold for the moment.     Anyway, if I dont hear from you, good luck and know that everything will work itself out. Do the things that you love to do, and you will find genuine friends wherever you are. When it comes to your family, let them know your schedule and when you will be able to call, and try and speak with them whenever you can. The time zone difference can be hard to work around, but hearing the voices of your family and seeing their faces will help you feel better about it. If you need to send or receive money to/from them, they have cash app, you can do it through facebook, western union app, and several other apps are available. Most schools that have an international program also have a counselor or guide to help you with lots of different things, and it can help you find places around your area. I apologize for this being so long, but I hope this is helpful. Have a great day!"
