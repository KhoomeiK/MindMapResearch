relationship_advice,ffc2tao,t3_esqnjb,1579790132.0,"It's amazing that people are accusing you of being black out drunk. If your ""friends"" were drinking they likely weren't keeping track of whether or not you were drinking and likely thought the same - this girl is sloppy and can't hold her drink.  However, you sound pretty young and a lot of young people don't yet know their limit, so I'm not sure why they're shunning you even if it's for that reason.  For them to not believe you and then shun you over it is despicable.  When someone is drugged, they can act black out drunk, so if someone came up to me saying they've been drugged I would help them. Hell, I would help them even if I thought they were just black out because they clearly cannot fend for themselves either way.  

Your ""friends"" are horrible people.  Keep the friend who helped you and be glad you're rid of the rest.  Seriously, you are way better off without people like them. I'm not sure what to say to help you feel like less of a freak, but if anything, your ""friends"" are the freaks."

He's embarrassing himself right now.  Surely he see that?  If he goes to therapy, it's not like he'll have it tattooed on his forehead. If he goes to therapy, and he definitely should (on his dime), he doesn't have to tell a damn soul about it because that's his business.  Now, if he's worried about what an impartial stranger will think, he shouldn't be.  The therapist will not be judgemental and, while this jealousy is bad, I'm sure the therapist has heard much worse. 

That said, set a timeline for yourself.  If he doesn't seek therapy by x date and doesn't show signs of trying to improve by y date, leave. 

However, if you want to leave now, that is totally valid and understandable.  For now, do yourself a favor and check out [this](http://www.loveisrespect.org) site - just in case.

Well, I suppose I would do that no matter what because I don't have fun if my sex partner isn't having fun, but anyway, I digress.  I recommend talking about how you feel used during sex and that you would appreciate more foreplay. Tell him that he needs to last longer in bed if he cares about satisfying you and that you'd be happy to help him solve this (unless you aren't, in which case, don't answer) if he wants your help.  Finally, if and when he's able to last longer, perhaps invest in a cock ring.

I'm from Chicago and there are definitely weird neighborhoods/parts of neighborhoods that look like people from the burbs moved their entire block and just dropped it in the city.  It's wild.  I could see their doors being unlocked.  As for your friend - seems like she was pretty sheltered if she's never lived alone/only moved out of her family house once she was married.

todayilearned,fcypy6e,t1_fcyju8a,1578084695.0,Are your friends from a small or rural town?
relationship_advice,fcxi6ip,t1_fcwva57,1578063544.0,"Exactly.  I'm pro-choice and I would not sleep with a man who would try to pressure me into keeping the baby if, for whatever reason, it seemed better to terminate.  He doesn't want a baby at 19 - that's pretty reasonable.  He obviously can't get the abortion if she gets pregnant and he certainly can't make her get one as it's her body, her choice.  Therefore, if he doesn't want to risk being a father at 19, he should stop having sex with her and leave because accidents can happen even if you're being extremely careful."

Edit: Follow up question - do you talk about her (the anime character) a lot?  You've gotta be honest here or you are doing yourself a disservice."
relationship_advice,fcvllg3,t3_ej3aq7,1578004722.0,">Is it normal for a girl's expectation to be like this? 

Sure, it's normal!  If you live in the 1950s, where women didn't work and it was just understood that men had mistresses.  


I wouldn't necessarily break up with her just yet, but definitely don't propose any time soon.  Hopefully she can unlearn her mother's old-fashioned, sexist lesson - couples counseling would be a good place to start. 

Good luck!"

P.S. I laughed out loud on a crowded bus when I read that her crazy mother had called the police on you.  I really wish I could have heard that call.  I also feel satisfied that her friends now know what a monster she is."

When I'm in a relationship, I like to give my partner's interests a fair shot.  I feel like sometimes you just end up watching things you'd rather not watch when you're in a relationship - it goes both ways.  I'm sure you've watched something she likes that you don't."
