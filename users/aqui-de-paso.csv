lonely,ff5spqs,t3_erqjiw,1579608799.0,I hope everything will turn out alright. I'm religious so I will pray for you if it's cool with you.
lonely,ff2i464,t3_er2vl5,1579507127.0,"I'm in the same place as you, seeking productive ways to cope with my loneliness. I think doing volunteer work could possibly help. Seeing others' struggle can put problems in your own life (such as loneliness) in perspective, and being helpful and feeling needed can be very fulfilling. Generally I think it's important to do things that make you feel like you're contributing to something greater than yourself."
lonely,ff2gy3t,t3_er9q07,1579505675.0,"Oh absolutely. But I have this additional problem, I have a hard time letting go of the positive emotions I've felt while dreaming (because I can't stand feeling what you're feeling right now), and so these dreams become fantasies, and I get absorbed in excessive daydreaming that can last for months. Always ends with depression, of course. I've shamefully built intricate alternate realities over many years, always starting from one scene I had dreamt. Yeah I'm pretty lonely :>"
SuicideWatch,fefy2sj,t1_fef5n06,1579069073.0,"It seems to me like you are assuming the worst will happen, maybe I lack context because I don't know which country and culture you are from, but depression is extremely common, a lot of people with successful careers take medication against it. There is a lot to be done before hospitalisation is an option. In my country you cannot be involuntary comitted unless you are in a severe and very immediate danger, I assume it is so in all first world countries. I see no reason to assume your family wouldn't listen to your wishes, unless they have a history of being controling. Also I don't actually think telling them is necessarily the best idea, unless they can help with finding you professional help. You need professional help my friend. Have you seen a psychiatrist? Depression is usually curable. You totally totally deserve to have a support network AND be mentally healthy."
SuicideWatch,fef1rrf,t3_eosqzd,1579046148.0,"People get really weird about these things. When I was younger I was hospitalised in a mental facility for an entire school year and  I didn't receive so much as a phone call from any of my friends. Wasn't mad at them though, I guessed they didn't feel very close to me. I  think it can be a good idea to reach out sometimes, but only to the people who are closest to you who are unlikely to run away, like a loving parent, spouse or a close friend."
SuicideWatch,fef0gyd,t3_eorw4l,1579045287.0,Do you wish to talk about it?
SuicideWatch,feezyck,t3_eotio7,1579044949.0,"I'm sorry your therapist gave you that feeling, this sucks. Maybe it's best not to focus on how others perceive you, but simply about your own well-being. You don't owe anything to anyone, we're all basically a bunch of clueless children trying to do our best with what we have. All of us are quite useless in the grand scheme of things. Have a peaceful night."
SuicideWatch,feez6s2,t3_eot8q2,1579044452.0,"Being a teenager was the hardest thing I've ever done. I hope once you're out of school you'll be able to find friends who love you and accept you as you are. You're more than a depressed kid, but it will probably take time to get to know yourself and find your confidence. I hope you feel better soon."
SuicideWatch,feeyjhz,t3_eorqoa,1579044034.0,"I often feel the same way, like I'm not cut out for life. Things are too hectic and demanding, there's too much work to do with very little pay off. So much loneliness, and so much boredom. God, how boring it all is.
Having said that, I definitely experienced times when I was engaged and felt motivated, so I do understand that it's more about my current mental state than some objective reality. I hope you don't kill yourself and get better and be ok with existing."
SuicideWatch,feexggv,t3_eosvw9,1579043334.0,"There's no reason for him to blame himself, and I doubt he would. I think you should tell him, it sounds like you could use the support. I really hope you two will find a way to get you into therapy as quickly as possible. You deserve to heal from this. All that stuff, aspirations and goals, comes later, once you're not focusing all your energy on battling depression."
SuicideWatch,feewnpk,t3_eosxra,1579042824.0,"Umm I think your feelings need to be assessed by other people to judge the normality of your situation... You can't really be objective about it. 
Mental illnesses usually have a strong genetic component. But it's your choice how to deal with the cards you've been dealt. I mean, you don't have to self medicate with alcohol. there are other, healthier, options. A good therapist can help a lot to someone with a tendency for pessimism and melancholy, for example. You are not your father, you are a unique person with the ability to pave his own way."
SuicideWatch,feevtrd,t3_eosxyl,1579042304.0,"Taking a break actually sound like a good idea. I'm very lonely too, I feel ya. Hope you feel better."
SuicideWatch,feev3f9,t3_eor7ki,1579041856.0,"I'm going to ask the obvious question, are you in therapy?

I sometimes read threads about losing a loved one to suicide on askreddit. Gives me perspective and makes me not want to introduce that much pain and confusion in other people's lives.

I really hope you are seeing a therapist. Depression really skews one's perception of things, and so many things you wrote are an example of that. I dont think people would be so quick to commit you or that they'd get tired of you, and I definitely don't believe you've tricked anyone into anything. Also logically you must agree that having a mental illness shouldn't mean you automatically deserve to be alone, unsuccessful and poor. I hope you will find the help you need the get better and realize you definitely do deserve to have supporting family and friends."
SuicideWatch,fdhthyo,t3_elh128,1578429877.0,"Sorry you don't receive the support you need at home. You deserve being listened to, and you deserve feeling loved and appreciated for who you are regardless of your successes. I wish you the best in the future."
aww,fdhlqaf,t1_fdh19en,1578425323.0,Are you ok?
SuicideWatch,fbfx2eu,t3_ed5xfv,1576824169.0,I feel your helplessness. I sincerely hope you are better soon. ❤️
