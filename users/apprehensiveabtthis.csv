TalesFromYourServer,ff8trdo,t1_ff6fo5p,1579695779.0,"Are you saying it shouldn't be expected of a parent to actually parent their kid and teach them that not every adult that comes into their line of vision is available for whatever ""conversation"" the kid wants to have? How is the little girl going to learn that sometimes she needs to be quiet when her mother teaches her to be entitled to everyone's attention and conversation all the time?

I am worried for YOUR child, seems like she's going to get the same kind of parenting that dumb, entitled bitch was giving.

Oh wait, no, you live in a country where cashiers actually have basic human rights and aren't obligated to provide customers with a vial of their blood. My mistake."
