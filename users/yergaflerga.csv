By chance have you ever considered the possibly of it being something wrong with the brain? Like it thinking somethings wrong in the stomach and tell the body to throw up? Like mixed signals maybe you know?
IAmA,fditjxh,t3_ella3i,1578450719.0,I once threw up 23 times in about 12 hours and I could hardly drink and couldn't imagine eating how are you able to do it and keep up with your bodies needs? And is it like a constant stomach ache and pain or does it just... Happen?
Trombone,fdeqdtn,t1_fddbo8l,1578344427.0,I never used slide grease with it only oil so I'm not sure and also it was right where my thumb would go when holding it (not on slide)
Trombone,fdcjrlb,t1_fdbzl4e,1578276634.0,Its also good to note it rubs off. Ruined the gloves to my uniform (dont worry they were cheap easily replaceable gloves anyway) made a green stain where I had jt at on my old horn.
AskReddit,fcwfb2i,t3_eiwc0j,1578024154.0,"8.5/10 and as for tips .

1. Its okay to say ""fuck them I could do so muc better without them.
2. Sometimes with people not even the professionals can help unfortunately.
3. Think on the big decisions. Think again. Clear your mind. Think again. 
4. There is ALWAYS a reason to push on after you're at rock bottom or below.
5. Stop and smell the roses often.

Hope this reaches whoever needed it."
AskReddit,fcweuut,t3_ej7pm7,1578023833.0,"Now I dont feel very strongly about it and more or less only recommend it. (And note I'm not in the military but am very interested in it and might join) But its a very good idea to read this and books like it if you intend on going to the military and just good to know about in my opinion. The book is ""brothers in arms- Geraint Jones"" i feel like it might be a good insight to how the army is like for at least some eople (though its just about a British marines experience.) But I think gives an great window to how it might be like for some people. Shows how some of their humor is and other things like that as well."
