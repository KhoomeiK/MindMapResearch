I'll try 6.7 tonight, I didn't think about installing to a USB which is pretty dumb on my part (considering I did a freenas usb minutes earlier)

I don't plan on running tons of VMs, maybe 2 or 3 (Windows and Linux) so can I install both of them on the ssd and then give each one a hdd ?"

I realize what I said was not very clear 

The backplane accepts SAS drives but the connection from it to the motherboard happens with a sata to sata cable. 

Would what you say still apply in that case ?"
