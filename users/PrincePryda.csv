I noticed as soon as I got up but figured maybe she took the moment in between the team transition to send out a text. No worries. 

A few minutes in she’s still texting while smiling at her screen. Whatever. 

5 minutes in and this bitch hasn’t looked up once. It pissed me off because I watched her mumble through her entire presentation with a smile to try and make her feel more comfortable because it was clear she had no fucking idea what she was presenting. A lot of the shit she messed up on, I covered in mine. 

At the end of the day it didn’t really matter cause I wasn’t graded based on how attentive the class was, but god damn, show the minimum amount of respect. I honestly felt like stopping the entire presentation and announcing that I’d wait for her to finish texting, but I knew that would have been blowing things waaaaay out of proportion. 

Nonetheless, if you’re going to not give a single fuck about someone who’s presenting for you, at least _act_ like you care. If you can’t even do that, just say you have to shit your brains out and leave the room. It shouldn’t have upset me as much as it did, but I really cared about my presentation...."

Wow. Your bf didn't want to upset you. How considerate of him.

\> It was not the first time he did something like that, and last time I made it clear that I'm going to break up with him.

Wait, so he drugged you before and you did nothing about it?

\> I don't have the balls to do it though.

You, Reddit, and your bf all know this. You treated the previous incident of him drugging you as if you were a vegetarian and your boyfriend slipped meat into your dish.

\> I have a history of overlooking red flags and I feel like this is one. Maybe I'm blowing this out of proportion?

Ok, so you feel like there is a problem here with getting drugged multiple times, but you're not really sure. Is this a troll post or are you really as dumb as I think you are? I really don't like commenting on people's intelligence over the internet because I'm reducing them to just their post, but my fucking god. If you need someone on Reddit to spell it out for you, here I am. 

First of all, you should have dumped him the first time and lost all contact. Instead, you made it ""clear"" that you'd break up with him. Life lesson #1 - NEVER make a threat that you can't follow through on. A girl I know (22) is raising a 3 year old and threatens her daughter with punishments but never follows through. Guess who caught onto this? The 3 year old. THE 3 YEAR OLD. She completely stopped listening to her mother because she knows there will be no repercussions. Your boyfriend also caught onto this, which is exactly why he not only did it again, but felt comfortable enough to tell you. Take a second to think about how dumb he thinks you are if he's willing to give you an explanation as if you could sympathize with him trying to drug you. That's so insulting.  

Next - if I along with all the other responses to this post haven't made it clear enough for you already, you need to dump him. Additionally, I sincerely request you contact law enforcement. Even if you don't have proof - he needs to be on their radar. Why? If he's willing to drug his own girlfriend multiple times, I can assure you he's going to try doing this to his next girlfriend too. Nothing might come out of getting the police involved this time, but if the next victim reports him as well, I guarantee the police will get seriously involved. You could be saving god knows how many girls from being put in the situation you were in the other night. 

I really do hope the best for you. You're not blowing this out of proportion - you're doing the exact opposite. I'm no psychic, but if you continue to stay with him, I'm 99.9% sure he's going to drug you again. Please, please consider getting law enforcement involved. Like I said, even if nothing comes out of it this time, the next person to report him will indicate to the police that there is a pattern with this guy. Just think of all the women you could be helping. 

I sincerely wish you the best of luck and hope this never happens to you again. Stand up for yourself and for all the women out there, please. Keep us posted so we can help however we can."

About a year ago I was laying down on my bed at my parents house. I began falling asleep so I just closed this lid and passed out. A little while later, I woke up and realized that I was sleeping with my laptop right beside me. Afraid I might knock it off the bed, I grabbed my laptop, rolled over, and kinda held myself by the side of the bed as I slid my laptop underneath the bed. Not a second after rolling back to my original position, the bed started shaking. I thought it might have been from me moving, so I waited a second. It began shaking more. At this point, I was completely awake and sat up - bed was still shaking. I didn’t know what to think so I looked at my desk which had a glass of water on it, and the water was still. 

After about a minute, the bed slowly stopped shaking. I went back to sleep, but the next morning I told my parents to see what they would think. My dad initially dismissed my claim, but after I kept pushing, he too kinda seemed unsure about what to make of it. He said it might have had something to do with the split A/C and the springs in my bed, but I’m not sure how they could be at play here. 

To this day I have no proof, but I’m certain I felt my bed shaking. And it wasn’t just a soft shaking - it was almost as if a baby was jumping on my bed (not saying that’s what it was, but just to give you a frame of reference).

In fact, the watch he wears daily is worth more than both of my friend’s car combined - but they wouldn’t know that, and my roommate doesn’t advertise it either.

Getting assigned is a risk that generally the seller of the option faces - not the buyer (before expiration). If you’re the buyer, you have no _obligation_ to do anything before expiration. 

However, if the calls are in the money at expiration and you _do_ have enough funds to exercise the option, brokers like Robinhood which I’m sure you’re familiar with will exercise the contract for you. If you don’t have the funds to exercise the contract (but they’re in the money), Robinhood will sell the contracts on your behalf 1 hour before the market closes at 4PM EST. 

As you correctly mentioned, it’s possible that you can trade your option to someone else for a profit before expiration.

Tomorrow, he might still remember that, and it would almost seem as if he’s understood it! However, if you asked the same kid what 1+3 is, he’d be lost. 

Instead, if you taught him how addition works, he could not only add any two numbers together, but he could _construct_ his own formula just by being given a problem. 

For the CFA, you’re given a ton of formulas. The trick here is to understand what the sequence of steps in each formula is and, more importantly, _how_ those sequence of steps allow you to arrive at the answer. If you can do that, you don’t need to really worry about memorizing anything at that point. 

This really helped me when I was doing WACC calculations and unlevering/relevering beta in the Corporate Finance section."

You also want to consider positive and negative air pressure in your case. If you have negative air pressure, you’re going to be pulling air into your case from the small gaps that aren’t protected by dust filters."

options,feztokw,t3_eqzhx8,1579461525.0,"Because you’re only buying the _right_ to buy the stock at a certain price on or before the certain date (for “American” calls, which are diff than “ European” or “Bermuda”, but don’t worry about that for now). 

Let’s say you buy the _right_ to buy Tesla at $400 (strike price) on or before the second Friday in February (expiration date). Let’s also say that each contract is $0.10, and you buy 1 call option (so you pay $10 today). 

Let’s say on the expiration date that Tesla is trading at $500. A common misconception is that you’re just granted 100 shares, and this is wrong. You’ll still have to pay for the shares, but you’ll only be paying for 100 shares at $400. The profit is made by the difference between the market price ($500/sh) and strike price ($400/sh) less the premium paid for calls ($10). 

In this case, you’ll have made $90/sh with a maximum downside of $10. You would have realized this maximum downside if Tesla trades anywhere below $400 on/before the expiration date, because you wouldn’t want to exercise your right to buy the stock at $400 when you could easily buy it for sub-$400 from the market."

While we’re on the subject of total bullshit, I also recommend smoking as many cigarettes as possible (if you’re a smoker). If your body doesn’t want to smoke anymore - it simply won’t! No need to force your body to quit doing something it naturally wants - that’s seriously unhealthy and don’t let anyone shame you into thinking otherwise.

Reposting isn’t always a crime because, when you think about it, not everyone get’s a chance to see the original. I realized this when I scroll through the comments and hear people complaining about it being a repost when it’s only been my first time seeing it. That got me thinking - how many posts have I seen for the first time that were actually posted before (perhaps even several times). 

Upvote for you and OP."
