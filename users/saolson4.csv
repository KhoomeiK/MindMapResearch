ImGoingToHellForThis,fcyio9t,t1_fcxtc8s,1578080682.0,"So it's the action, not the toy. Because in your original comment it's the toy that's the issue. This is exactly my problem with the US stance on sex. Just be honest with each other and yourselves. If you have an issue with the action then say that. If you are uncomfortable with saying the reason then say that too. Dont frame it as something else and shame someone for their enjoyment in the use of a toy, when you yourself enjoy toys. It's perfectly reasonable to say that you dont wish to engage in the action because you have your own personal reasons and not offer further explanation in a more casual relationship, and if the other party doesnt accept that explanation then perhaps you should be questioning why you are in a sexual relationship with them at all. In a more serious relationship it would definitely be reasonable to explain in further detail, and again, anyone worth the effort will understand. But this is exactly what my issue with sex in the US is. If we can't be honest with ourselves and the people we plan to share a life with, and the most intimate part of life at that, then how can you justify saying that someone is at fault for wanting to use a specific toy? If it isn't something your into, it's fine, but dont project that on to someone else saying that they should be satisfied with the pleasure you can provide. Everyone has different thresholds for the pleasure they need for climax, some much higher than others, and it's more beneficial to both parties to discuss this and find what works for both, without the need to feel defensive about it. I understand that trauma can complicate this, I have my own trauma as well. What worked for me was counciling to work through this and then setting my expectations clearly in any relationship I go into. Granted, that mine has to deal with anal sex and I am a heterosexual male helps that it isnt an issue I have to deal with often at all, it still is helpful to set the expectation early that it isnt something I am comfortable with. I honestly dont agree that you should have been downvoted so much, everything said was perfectly valid and calm, but communication is key, in any relationship, personal, romantic, professional or otherwise.

Edit: And the communication goes both ways, you should demand that the guy your with talk with you about his likes and dislikes in sex as well."
ImGoingToHellForThis,fcxro2l,t1_fcxovvc,1578069525.0,"Which is probably why you dont want to use it. That's a terrible thing to happen, dont get me wrong. But then state that as your reasoning. You have trauma from your past in association with male toys, not simply that male toys make you feel less of a sexual provider. 

My biggest issue with sex topics in general are that the US is way to prude about it. Nobody is comfortable enough in discussing what they want with a partner until long after they have already begun to have sex. By then expectations have already been set in each others minds, and it always ends up disappointing both parties. In all my relationships I've been very open about what I want and like, and it either creates amazing pleasure for the both of us, or we find were too different and part ways. Too many people act like sex is a taboo topic, and that it doesn't make up a very large part of an adult relationship."

WTF,fcw9eny,t1_fcw861y,1578020176.0,"This looks to be a rural area, a lot of these areas only have volunteer fire departments. I'm sure the majority of small counties/towns have their police/deputies trained for medical emergencies as well"
WTF,fcw99v8,t1_fcw8qxw,1578020088.0,"I'm sure most departments have at least basic first aid training. I know for sure some do more advanced training as well, with a few that I know being optional. But in the majority of the US, the fire department is actually the first responders. Any medical emergency that goes out can, for the most part, be responded to by police, fire or EMS. This looks to be a fairly rural area, could even be only volunteer fire in the area as well. Which means that the sheriff's department would probably get there first most the time, followed closely by fire. So in a million words, it's very possible that they were the first ones on the way"
