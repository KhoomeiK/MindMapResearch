Looking at any media (gaming, movies, etc), it's clear that when done even half competently, ""badass"" still works whether people in 2020 want to pretend otherwise, we all can relate/cheer for a badass who gets fed up and tells people to fuck off before kicking their ass.

And yet there is no raging about this from the notoriously crabby Smash community, and the online is objectively the worst on Switch if not consoles in general based on its shit quality. Mario Kart is another example where you could play the SAME GAME free on the Wii U and somehow the playerbase has survived with paid online. At the end of the day, if people are fans of only one game series or don't play games at all and jump into something without even the tiniest bit of research it's hard to feel like that's anyone's choice but theirs.  Much like going on Christmas eve to buy something you didn't bother to check if it was a hot seller and blaming everyone else when it's not there.

Yes it's not fun to learn about, but especially on Nintendo (at least with what we've seen from Bank and NSO) the cost, as you mentioned, is not a huge price tag and anyone who gets that up in arms about 20 or 5 dollars annually may need a new hobby.  I very much get value for my NSO even without Pokemon between Mortal Kombat, Mario Kart, SNES/NES, Rocket League, Doom, etc.

That said, the GTS thing does very much suck and I would like it to be rectified. Also I don't expect Home to be AS cheap as Bank but if it's not somewhere around there and ends up being like Netflix-pricey I would obviously not support that.

Edit: I can't imagine Home costing more annually than the entirety of NSO but it IS the Pokemon Company so I wouldn't put it past them either."

1. No child who loves a show would suddenly stop watching it because a game based on it didn't come out at the same time, or vice versa.
2.

Sure ""expanded"" fans play some of the games I imagine and gamers have a few plushies or may have watched the show here and there, and yes some fans encompass both, but apparently (I forget where I heard it initially) there are distinct crowds, making point 1 even more salient.
3. Other huge media franchises have no interest in such shenanigans and it seems to work just fine. For example, Marvel released a game that heavily featured Thanos, Black Order, etc and didn't rush it to come out with Infinity War or Endgame, nor did Sony rush out their Spider-Man game to coincide with any other bullshit, and both Ultimate Alliance and Spidey PS4 have sold gangbusters and been well received by critics and fans.

I would imagine if people are treating this with nuanced positivity (not acting like there's no issues but not misrepresenting the patch), they will see the sense of continuing the dexit reversal.  However if people are going to act like this is the same and nothing has changed then why would they patch the rest in.

This is becoming like Mortal Kombat 11 where some misleading/false claims about lootboxes got blown out of proportion (when it had nothing to do with the legit issues at launch) and while NRS was out there patching up the legit issues with difficulty/game rewards people were crying bloody murder, luckily shit is great(ish) now in the MK community as facts were able to prevail there (in fairness Ed Boon is way better than GF/TPC have been at communicating)"

That's all choices made in production, it didn't have to be done that way.  Also a few haphazard things thrown in there abruptly without much logic, progression, motivation, or story structure in general in between giant chunks of telling and not showing is not the same as something like the character arc of Mando or Luke or Han.

Okay.

>$30 for DLC,

Not required to transfer pokemon up from previous gens, so irrelevant to my point and Dexit in general.

> and $15 for home. 

Source? I wasn't aware Home's pricing was made clear, much less that it would be quarterly and not annually/monthly.

>We can go further and add $20 for the Nintendo online access. 

No we can't, you seem to be new to console gaming. You pay for Nintendo Online to play all your games online, and if it's your thing, use the NES and SNES libraries and play Tetris 99. Console games in general have charged a fee for online play since friggin Halo 2, and Nintendo for a while was the only holdout. That said, while I won't pretend I didn't like playing Mario Kart Online for free back in  the Wii U days - and firmly believe that the practice for charging a fee  for online gaming is stupid in the age of Steam (which is a different   discussion), I don't see how anyone could have actually believed that  Nintendo wouldn't join MS and Sony in charging for online.

The difference is you pay more (and get more) with PS and Xbox live Gold   but as someone who plays Kart, MK11, Rocket League, Doom, NES/SNES, and a  bunch of other games online, I like doing so from my bed and really  find it hard to complain about the 20 bucks a year.

I  haven't got SwSh yet (had no interest since Dexit but am following this news with the potential of the pokemon coming back), but the existence of NSO is the least of its issues and a weird hill that people here and on [r/NintendoSwitch](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/)  (not necessarily you specifically) seem to die on.  In short, NSO is not some trap Nintendo made to make pokemon specifically more expensive, it's a console online service  which, if it's not your first day in gaming, is normal as shit.  Nobody calls online a ""paywall"" for COD (with its 6 hour campaign), Mortal Kombat, Rocket League, Smash, etc.  It is disingenuous and misleading to do so here.

Also, if you were hoping to catch them all without transferring up from a previous game, then as I said, you must be new to Pokemon because that has never been the case. The point of the dexit backlash was the removal of the transfer feature, and (as mentioned previously) if you did transfer and you preferred using 2 systems and games to literally trade for hours instead of cloud storage for 5 bucks a year then we are very different people I guess."

I also find it weird to stick with the series so long if you were never satisfied with any of the methods of completing the national dex/preserving your pokemon.  I just  had no real problem with paying 5 bucks annually to store and move my guys around between games.  It was certainly preferable to the previous method and I think most of us anti Dexit people just wanted to continue with that.  I have to say if bank was such a high price then pokemon and perhaps gaming in general are just not the best hobbies for you."

pokemon,feeldyn,t1_feekz8c,1579036108.0,"So, I don't get it.  You dislike paying 5 bucks a year for bank but were fine with the pre-bank days where you literally had to get two games and systems (or a real nice friend/sibling) and manually trade them all for hours on end?  Or have you never played pokemon before and didn't know that you've never been able to catch them all natively?  Barring Home being outrageously priced compared to bank, this is literally what the majority of us anti-dexit people wanted.  If you're complaining about NSO, you must be new to consoles (don't get an Xbox or PS4 then lol), and if you're complaining about 5 bucks a year for optional cloud storage for pokemon (as bank has been so far, and very user-friendly and effective at that), then gaming in general might not be for you.  As much as there are legit issues with sword and shield (and I have more than a few), this aspect of the backlash is misleading and silly, especially your last sentence which is pure speculation.

My issues with SwSh aside, this is a comparison that needs to be made.  People complain about the story and how ""easy"" the game is every gen, when they have never played against a human being (and would likely get trounced).  It really is like complaining about the story of a Smash game or calling it ""easy"" because you can beat a CPU.  I mean, play Smash (or Pokemon) however you want but choosing to ignore the main aspect of a game and complaining about it is weird, like yeah COD has a 6 hour campaign but if you're gonna spend your 60 on it and never play multiplayer it's a bit weird..."
