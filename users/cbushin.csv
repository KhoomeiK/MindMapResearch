childfree,feco0bu,t1_fea9g24,1578978750.0,"I took Sociology 105 as an elective when I was an undergraduate. The textbook for that class had a chapter about many ways that women end up with the lion's share of the workload when they have children. It had ways men weasel out of the work, believe there is less work that needs to be done, as well as the second shift. The textbook was about men doing the needs reduction, incompetence, reinforcement with praise, such as telling friends ""My wife is an excellent cook..."" and claiming to be splitting the work 50-50 when they really are unaware of the large amount of work the women are doing. I didn't get how any girl could possibly read that chapter and not become childfree."
childfree,fe911dn,t3_eny7ga,1578933029.0,"I think the kid's name is ""Cousin Oliver."" It seems like most TV love is toxic even before children are added. I like thinking the characters should have broken up on most shows or movies. 

I saw a few episodes of ""Community""  and it looked promising, but I only saw a few episodes and not enough to see if any good romance developed."

My coworkers have seen when someone brought kittens in to work and let me hold them. Everyone thought it was so cute. It is also fun when a cat sits in my lap and lets me pet it and people say ""It looks like you found a friend.""

There is existential nihilism, moral nihilism, epistemological nihilism, metaphysical nihilism, mereological nihilism, and ontological nihilism. There are a lot of choices of what type of nihilist to be.

I remember a suggestion by Camus about imagining Sisyphus happy. If Sisyphus can enjoy pushing the rock pointlessly up the hill, he has enough reason to get out of bed every morning. 

I think it is also that we don't need to falsely believe in things that do not exist."

They should have just said they ran out of toys if they didn't want to give you one. I wonder if saying you have a kid would have gotten you the toy sooner. Then you could have ordered a decoy meal in addition to the one with Buffalo sauce. I am not sure McDonalds employees will verify your claims of having a kid at home."

antinatalism,fd7ffod,t3_ek1t7x,1578203630.0,That is a big assumption about family loving them. Does that mean people from shitty abusive families should kill themselves? The idea that family or children are the only reason to live is bad too.
