AdviceAnimals,fdo1fbw,t1_fdnn84m,1578597117.0,"Two news articles does not make a scientific consensus. It's the stance of every major nutrition committee (ADA, mayo, Harvard medical) that a well planned vegan diet is healthy at all states of life, including pregnancy and infancy. On mobile so can't link, but it's easily googleable.

Some people are dumb and feed babies only raw salads and stuff, but that has nothing to do with veganism. 

This post is bad science and should not be upvoted as highly as it is."
facepalm,fdgtfuc,t1_fdgfgjh,1578407878.0,"This a complicated problem, but fundamentally there are more dogs than people who want dogs. I wish we had the problem that someone would seek out to adopt a dog, but there being no adoptable dogs available, but that is simply not the case. Puppy mills produce dogs at a rate far faster than people want them, because it is so cheap to do so.  

Now we have a couple things that can help:
1. Adopt don’t shop
2. spay and neuter your pets
3. encourage others to do the same (including trying to pass legislation against puppy mills)

PETA supports all of the above (as they should) but that is not enough to solve the problem currently. so then we have two options:
1. have massive shelters pouring tons of money and people’s time caring for them.  They will still not have good lives due to the inevitable high ratio of dogs to people caring for them.
2. Euthanize some of the animals.

It’s a truly heartbreaking situation, and I think there’s no easy answer. Although you may feel keeping these dogs and cats is worth pouring tons of money and time into, no organization (including PETA) currently has the means to do that.  If you feel strongly that PETA has the wrong approach you could volunteer at a shelter or donate large sums of money, but if you’re not I think it’s not fair to call PETA hypocrites here.

Also I don’t think them shaming people for not putting down sick pets is a real thing, probably some misinformation put out by CCF or something.

I encourage you to edit your post if anything I’ve said here makes sense. There’s a ton of misinformation about PETA put out by lobbyists and it takes mature people who are willing to change their mind to make a dent against the fake news out there.  “PETA kills animals” gets lots of clicks; “Peta struggles to solve complicated problem with no easy solution, sometimes requiring euthanasia” does not."

facepalm,fdgsd93,t1_fdgp1wr,1578407091.0,"There are wild sheep that are the same species. you just stop breeding the ones that have been selectively bred to require human assistance to survive.

The tweet is really a rebuttal to the argument “we need to shear sheep otherwise they get heat exhaustion, so wool is good for sheep!”

Peta’s point is that we’re solving a problem we created, and the best thing to do would be to stop breeding these sheep that depend on human intervention for survival."

I don't think that's really what they're doing though, they should just eat some beans."

The probability of being 1 standard deviation from the mean is fixed, the standard deviation (as percent of total population/) would get smaller."

z=(x-2)^infinity + (y-3)^infinity + 3


would be more interesting with more numbers.

I think the only better solution would be larger scales of infinity."
