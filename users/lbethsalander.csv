I have a dog very similar to yours. She is a terrier mix, including Jack Russell Terrier. She’s 3 now and I’ve had her for 2 years. She has been to 2 professional trainers. Both have said she has extreme anxiety issues. To make a long story short, I continued with the training as long as I could afford it. My vet suggested medication, which she has daily. She has bitten me a few times when she was in a situation which terrified her, but they were more nips than bites. I have other dogs at home which she deals well with most of the time. I do not take her anywhere she has to deal with people or dogs she doesn’t know. We do run errands in the car where we don’t have to leave the car. 
You have the right attitude to deal with your pup and you’ll find him a loyal companion in time. Should you choose to return him to the shelter, he’ll likely be euthanized due to the fact that he attacked other dogs and people. Continue with training, preferably a behavioral specialist. Consider medication if your vet recommends it. Use caution exposing him to other people or dogs. I could go on and on, but be patient and utilize the advice of professionals. I hope this info helps. Good luck."

My 3 month old puppy managed to grab a tampon out of the trash and ate it before I could get to him. I called our local pet emergency room and they said to bring him in immediately. I did, and they gave him medication to make him vomit. He did, and the tampon came up. They then gave him medication so he would stop vomiting. We were at the vet about an hour and my puppy is fine. But I was terrified the entire time. I hope your pup is ok."
