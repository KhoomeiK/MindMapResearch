I don't struggle everyday like some people do. I don't really ""struggle"" at all in the sense of not having money. The fact of the matter is, there are people that making millions in a hour and then you have people working 40 hours a week and can't feed their family. That's fucked. The system is obviously rigged at some stage. As an example



Look at the US pto. We usually get, what 2-3 weeks off a year? You're telling me a company that grows 200% in a year can't afford to give their employees a few more weeks off a year? Even then are most people making enough to spend 8—10k on a nice 2week vacation? This is all based on averages, but this system is fucked and it's not the bs the rich feed you.

That leaves me with very little to save / spend in case of an emergency. Next thing is, it takes away a ton of options, like moving to a different city. It also takes away from my free time because I have to work 40 hours and hopefully get some overtime just to get by. All that to hopefully take one decent vacation a year where I spend one week a year away from it all and actually enjoying life. Now tell me, is it truly all worth it for one week of enjoyment a year? There's just so much wrong with your statement. What if I get sick, fired, company goes under. I, you, anyone shouldn't be living like this. Life shouldn't always be a struggle until your 65 and about to die anyways... But wait, they want to raise retirement to 67 now.. You got a good 4 years to live your best life while they party on their 200million yacht.
