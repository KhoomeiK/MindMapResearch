1200isplentyketo,fcknev9,t1_f2edpuj,1577729100.0,"I sorta agree... at least anecdotally.

This was in 2010...

I ballooned up to 266 via stress and poor eating and sleeping.

I decided I would change it up.  

I went on a crazy 6 months super training and diet regime.  I lost 50lbs. at the same time I put on a good amount of muscle, I looked good, lean, and strong.  

Here is where it went wrong.  In order to gain muscle on a deficit you have to work really hard.  This kind of training paired with a calorie deficit is prime time injury time. 

This is why at least for me I'm looking to do a deficit diet until I lose my desired weight or at least close.  Then I will start with cardio to get past the the plateau.  Then I will raise caloric intake and start weight training.  

This is my plan at least.  Thoughts?"

It's not resources... they just don't give a fuck.  They could investigate, but isn't it easier for every police department to say the same shit about this. ""Sorry we are overwhelmed with bigger stuff"".  Bullshit.  There hasn't been a serious violent crime in my town in over a decade, yet they don't have time to go arrest the porch pirate because ""your high def video footage of them trespassing and stealing your package as well as the license plate of asshole isn't enough clear evidence to connect them with the crime""."
