legaladvice,feeqmjs,t3_eorw6y,1579039139.0,"Not lawyer advice but corporate culture advice here. You should talk with your employer and try to do this in a kinder way. 

Explain the mistake, announce a wage adjustment and give them 3-6 months notice about it so they can know to seek other work or make financial adjustments that might be needed. (please validate the legalities).  Basically this lays out why it's happening, gives them an opportunity to not be left in a financially bad place and signals to all your other workers that you are trying to take care of them.  A mass layoff and rehire will likely kill morale."
