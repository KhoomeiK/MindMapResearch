Advice,felgtdm,t1_felg2h9,1579221833.0,"We’re located in London, UK but he’s from Germany and will very likely leave the country once he finds out.

I can financially take care of the baby myself, but I haven’t decided if I want to keep it yet. I’m very confused and emotional atm, so I’m only making a decision once I’m sure. Thanks for the reply"
Advice,felglch,t1_felg3lp,1579221689.0,"He met a girl in a park and had unprotected sex with her in the park. He then had rash on his penis and when asked him about it, he finally admitted to cheating, and std. I dumped him immediately and we went no contact.

We always used condoms because I’m not on birth control, but he’s the only person I’ve been with so he’s definitely the father. 

I’m definitely leaning towards an abortion, but I need to think about it a bit more just to make sure I’m certain. Financially I could take care of the baby by myself. I have no idea how to tell him. Message, call, face to face?"
SkincareAddicts,fdysg4f,t3_end9aj,1578783107.0,How are you finding Differin? I’ve been using it for 4months and I’ve noticed an improvement but I definitely don’t have clear skin? How long have you used it and how has it worked? Thanks ❤️
LifeProTips,fdrh1uu,t1_fdp104m,1578684470.0,Thank you I will definitely try to implement this. Thank you! ❤️
witcher,fdqyw1y,t3_emqpq8,1578677025.0,He is just so handsome!!
loveafterporn,fdnxhlx,t1_fdncht1,1578594840.0,"Completely agree. He doesn’t think he has a problem/addiction and he won’t stop watching. He got violent when he  was caught out lying. 

OP if you decide to work this out with him, then please please be careful and stay safe ❤️"
photoshopbattles,fdns2ff,t1_fdmkudv,1578591691.0,This is so cute!
LifeProTips,fdnjqv0,t1_fdn8bz1,1578587257.0,I’m an adult but even now I cannot move into a new flat and unpack every box. I always leave a few boxes unpacked because I have it in my head I’ll be moving. I’ve been in my first apartment by myself for a year and I still have boxes. I’m an adult but I still have the same triggers as I did as a child. Really difficult thing to break :(

PMDD,fdndoti,t1_fdky6ah,1578583592.0,"I’m the same! I have PMDD and endo. PMDD kicks in from ovulation, then when the period comes I’m in hell with all the endo/period pain! The only way I cope is getting high daily on those days, I’ve tried everything else, but it’s the only thing that works!"

depression,fdfavan,t3_cml6ni,1578357367.0,I’m finding it really difficult to eat. For example: I’m hungry and then I make or buy food and I’ll take one or two bites maximum and then I’m full and disgusted by the sight of the food. Anyone know what this is? Thanks 🙏
toastme,fdfaev4,t3_ekyphd,1578357061.0,Absolutely amazing!! I’m so proud of you! You look so beautiful ❤️
loveafterporn,fdf992q,t3_el00c1,1578356278.0,"Absolutely agree! The last two men I were with were obsessed with anal sex and wanted no condoms with normal sex. I’ve always said no to anal because it’s something I don’t want to do. I’ve always said we need to use condoms because I’m not on birth control and also STDs. 

Ive heard the spiel about how condoms ruin sex a million times and I’ve been called boring more times I can count but what do you know? Both were sleeping with other people and one even caught a lifelong STD! So call me boring, but I’ll happily take boring over an STD any day!

EDIT: when someone asks me for anal I always say I’ll do it if I can put something up their ass too. Conversation is always shut down really quickly!"

BreakUps,fdb5t7j,t3_ekd6lc,1578254106.0,Wow thanks for this! I agree that a journal really helped me too. I write my thoughts and helps makes them tangible and then I can physically put my thoughts away when I put the book away. Best of luck to you ❤️
