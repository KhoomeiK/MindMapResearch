NoStupidQuestions,ffb8jps,t3_eso9v1,1579755059.0,"As someone who underwent spinal surgries for disc issues due to a lifetime of bad posture, let me share what my doctors told me.

1. Take frequent breaks - stand up and strech every 30 mins, or take a walk - go to the pantry to refill your cup or go to the loo or whatever - stand up and move 

2. Sit in a chair with lunar support and armrests, if possible 

3.  Sit as far back in the chair as you can, so it's straight back and you are not slouching 

3.5  your thighs must be parallel to the ground - use appropriate chair

3.6 your arms should neither be too high nor too low so wrists rest properly while you type

(I use wireless keyboard and mouse)

4. Neck position is extremely important - use laptop stands or even books to raise the level of laptop or monitor so it's at your eye level  

5. Do neck rotations frequently, rotate your shoulders frequently, strech 

7. Drink lots of water - lack of water may cause cramps"

And Tamils ran a terrorist organisation in Sri Lanka - as a sovereign nation, SL was well within it's rights to tackle that the way they deem fit.
