AskVet,fewek6c,t3_eqqznx,1579409283.0,"Not a vet. But I have certainly heard the vets say that yes, it is bad for pets.  


As a receptionist, I would think that one reason they don't ask that question is I'm sure some clients would be offended, defensive, or embarrassed, and also might not be truthful. I have noticed it's not uncommon for clients to get defensive even when asked a more pertinent question: if their pet has been seen and/or vaccinated by a vet, and some people will not be totally truthful about that even. And secondhand smoke means smoking around the pet, and not all smokers smoke inside. So I'm guessing very few people would report that they smoke inside around their pet, and if they did, they might be so embarrassed they would choose to go to a different vet who did not ask that question.

Also, I doubt it would change the course of treatment for the pet. They will listen to your pet's lungs either way. If the pet did have lung issues, perhaps at that point they would ask, and advise the client not smoke around the pet, but this is all speculation."
AskVet,fewda4f,t3_eqrjx6,1579408690.0,"Unfortunately the photo link is not working.

I would recommend calling your vet and asking him/her this question, as since they have examined your pet before, they will be best equipped to answer this question. You can ask them if you can send the photo too.

If you are concerned, it's always better to err on the side of caution and see your vet, worst case scenario it's a quick vet visit to know exactly what is causing the symptoms and have a bit of peace of mind. You can always try calling your vet first though, and then you can hear right from them whether they think it warrants a visit to get a look at what is going on."
AskVet,fewbmz9,t3_eqr1ic,1579408019.0,"This dog should definitely see a vet. Significant changes in behavior like this can be an owner's first clue that something is wrong, and time is absolutely of the essence if your pet may have a medical issue that is causing these significant shifts in behavior.

Unfortunately, no one can say for sure without examining your pet whether her sudden behavior change is the result of something medical going on, and what that might be.

When your dog does something out of character that seems like it could be a result of pain or fear, for no apparent reason, and continues to behave abnormally, it is important to get your dog to a vet to see if whatever is causing it is medical. Getting your dog in quickly if it is a medical issue is so so important. If your dog is acting this way because of something upsetting that is going on with her body, you do **not** want to wait. Please get your dog to a vet to start solving this ASAP."
AskVet,few7zh9,t1_fevog26,1579406673.0,"Thank you, that is much appreciated!

At our clinic, I've heard it said that our role is kind of like a gatekeeper for the vets, and I think that rings true. We basically do anything that doesn't require medical knowledge to free up the vets and techs to do anything medical.

We are in charge of the lobby, phones, emails, and faxes, which involves scheduling appointments and surgeries of course, and things like refill requests, getting and sending records, faxing scripts, updating info, scanning in documents, answering non-medical questions, getting answers to questions from vets or leaving them a detailed message if it's a more in depth question, that kind of thing. It can simple or more nuanced than it sounds depending on the circumstances.

For appointments, we check in and get them into a room with a weight when it's time, get them their intake papers to fill out, and get the charts to the vets and techs, and then they go into the appointments from the back, and send them out the front to check out and pay when they're done.

The vets would discuss things like the importance of heartworm and flea and tick prevention, but it's important for us to know the products, what they cover, deals, etc. because clients often want to know that when their actually purchasing the medication. The vets type up their SOAP notes usually, but sometimes the techs do.

I think the hardest part is managing clients and keeping them happy while still preserving the vets and techs time and practicing good medicine. There must be a place where people can get together and talk about what works, and tips I would think, but I haven't found one yet.

Do you think VIN is a place that would be helpful for receptionist too, or would it be odd for a receptionist to be on there? I don't want it to seem like I'm pretending to be a vet or anything; I just want to be better any way I can. I really like my job, and I like talking about ways to improve, and getting tips and advice."
dogs,fem8q0t,t3_en16fk,1579243869.0,"Aww little buddy, I just saw the update. I'm very glad you took him back in, but very disappointed that they haven't found out what is wrong yet.

I would do anything you can as soon as you can to try to figure out what is wrong if he is still not better, as I am very concerned about this puppy guy, much more so if it has been so long and it is still this bad. I would get him in for a second opinion, perhaps with an experienced veterinary hospital, as soon as possible. If they can't find anything either I would schedule a neurology appointment ASAP. 

I know the cost for vet stuff isn't fun, but Care Credit is a great way to help pay for cost over a period of time; it's a special credit card for medical stuff for humans AND pets, and they often have a 6 month plus period to pay everything back before they even start charging interest at all if it's over certain amounts (6 months for $200 or over I think), and it's much easier to get approved than most credit cards. It's very quick too, the other day I had clients worried about a bill when they went to check out, so I suggested care credit, which they had never heard of, and they checked it out and applied on their phone and were able to check out ten minutes later and put it all on their Care Credit, and they were quite pleased with it. A lot of the receptionists use it themselves for vet, human dentist, and human medical bills. I wish I knew about it 5 years ago.

I would ask the second opinion vet what they think about a CBC too, as even if you got one six months ago, I've seen bloodwork change DRAMATICALLY in even a few week period, and if something is going on, trust me, you want to detect it asap, so I really think it is worth it if they haven't found anything else especially. Unfortunately, just because a CBC was normal 6 months ago doesn't mean that much about how it might look now, and bloodwork can detect a myriad of different issues, not just liver and kidney.

I'm so sorry you are and your dog are going through this, it sounds just awful. From the symptoms you described, something is very wrong, and I encourage you to make sure your vet understands just how differently your pet is acting, and get a second opinion at perhaps a hospital that specializes in emergencies. I hope so badly that it is figured out soon, and perhaps with a second opinion or a neurology appointment (and I don't think you should wait for these) you will find the clue that lets you know what is going on. You and your pup will be in our thoughts and prayers."
dogs,fem6r84,t1_fdvl10l,1579241746.0,"Great! How did things end up, did they figure out what was causing this?"
AskVet,fefx1qo,t3_eov99z,1579068021.0,"First off, I think it's okay to say God Bless You for what you have done for this cat (whatever God or religion your prefer.) I am NOT a vet, but as a complete lay person in terms of medicine, I have to imagine that an injury like that any serious injury that dislodges the jaw would be horrific and painful, and cats are notorious for hiding pain, but now this poor cat is in the hands of veterinary professionals who can take away or at least ease the pain of this poor kitty, because of what you did. Thank you so much for that.

Second, I would really talk to the veterinary staff about your concerns. If they didn't mention humane euthanasia, it is likely that they think the best thing for the animal is to fix the jaw, but it would be best to talk to the veterinarians caring for the animal. Vets want the best thing for the animal. They also want the human in question to understand what is going on, and as this poor cat doesn't have an owner, but is lucky enough to have you, the vets I'm sure will be happy to discuss with you. So call the vets, tell them your concerns, and you can decide together what is right for this kitty. If you are concerned about the cost, which is understandable, you can talk about that too. The vets are not here to judge you, they are here to do the best thing for pet and owner, and I know it complicates things a lot that you are not the owner, but a good Samaritan, but they understand this too.

If cost is a concern, but your vet feels this cat has a good shot as recovery, I personally suggest taking to facebook with a go fund me page, but whatever happens make sure you and the vets make a plan to make sure this cat is as pain free as possible. Perhaps the surgery can be done now, and they can hold the cat until the funds are together from a rescue or something. What is important if the cat's welfare, and perhaps they can do the surgery now and whomever can be reimbursed after that. I don't have much but would be happy to contribute some, and there are many people I'm sure who would feel the same, provided medical documents as proof."
dogs,fefrtl7,t1_fedusp2,1579063327.0,"SOO true. Or even if you are just not a ""have a puppy"" person, but still a puppy person, and that is what a TON of people are. I work at a vet, and we get very excited when we have a litter appointment. I'll hang out past my shift to see the pups, just so I can help bring them in and out. I worked at a doggy daycare too, and it was amazing playing with the pups, and I so loved them, but it taught me how non-stop things are when you own a puppy. You have to be on your game just alll the time, especially during that adolescence time period. It is draining if you can't just go home and relax, which you can't if you own a puppy.

My dog has separation anxiety to the point she can't be left alone, other issues we work on, and we might start fostering other dogs with training needs in addition. But I don't want a puppy, because a puppy is just a lot. That should tell you something about how much work they are.

I'm not saying a would refuse a puppy in need or anything, but if I could choose between an adult dog and a puppy, I would rescue an adult, and the fact that adults are more in need of homes just makes that decision 100x easier.

Puppies. Are. Hard. Adorable, but hard. They are babies. Dog babies, but still babies. And babies are a lot of work."
dogs,fdtxpbp,t1_fdtroiv,1578723935.0,"I would never have thought of that. Poor Suzie, doesn't sound like fun! How were they able to treat it, if you don't mind me asking? I'd like to share this possibility with a friend who thinks he dog has night terrors, but now I'm wondering if this is a possibility."
dogs,fdtu9fc,t3_en13cx,1578722301.0,"I am so, so, so sorry. This is the most heartbreaking post I have ever read. You had absolutely no good options.

Her anxiety was a debilitating illness. You fought so hard to save her, you tried everything, so many specialists, and sometimes it seemed it was getting better. And just like so many dogs with a life-threatening illness, she had good days. But it sounds like no matter what you did, you were never going to be able to be in a position to find a way to give her mostly good days and still keep her safe from herself. Because if she had bitten a person or animal, they probably would have seized her, which would have been a horrible, awful experience for her, which surely would have resulted in forced euthanasia. She would have been scared and alone until she was put down. And a person or dog would have been injured or killed. And you would have felt terrible, and blamed yourself for all of it.

Sometimes there are no good options. She knows you loved her, and did everything you could for her. She was so so loved. That's more than most dogs get. And now she's free of the debilitating anxiety that ruled her life, and you'll be with her again too someday, although it's far away now. You'll have had a beautiful and full life, and she'll be so excited to greet you and show you that the illness she had that held her back in life is finally gone. I think she will be happy that you two had your time together, and that you got to love one another, but also happy I think that you didn't let her illness continue to eat both of you up. She'll be happy that you let her go so she could be free and you could have a real life too. And she'll know that you think of her and miss her all the time.

I know no dog will ever be what she is to you. But get another dog. You are clearly the kind of person that just needs one, and it's what she would want. There is some dog out there who wants to be loved as much as you loved her, some dog that has no one. Find that dog, and heal each other, to honor her memory, so you and the dog that your fated to find don't have to experience the fear and loneliness that she so afraid of. I think she would really like that."
dogs,fdtqod7,t1_fdszymz,1578720700.0,"This is a great comment, and that makes a lot of sense about the shaking more at night. DVM, tech, or have you had a dog with this kind of injury?"
dogs,fdtqahv,t3_en16fk,1578720536.0,"Also, I'm a receptionist at the vet I work at, so I don't have a ton of medical knowledge or anything, but I have gotten pretty good at knowing how urgent the vets will determine something is, and I can tell you pretty much for certain our vets would all recommend this dog be seen again ASAP and that it should not wait until Monday. Reading your comments as well, I believe they would probably advise that this dog go to the ER tonight, but if you decide to wait until morning, make sure he is seen first thing and that they get x-rays if they haven't already. It sounds like he is in serious pain.

You should post on r/AskVet , to have actual vets see if this is something that can wait until morning, and whether you should see a neurologist, etc., as I'm not a vet, and there are lots of vets there who might give you a better idea of what your next steps should be."
dogs,fdtotkk,t1_fdsxk8y,1578719908.0,"I really don't think this is behavioral, and I really think you need to see a vet again ASAP. This sounds very much like a dog in pain. I would go tomorrow first thing in the morning, or go to the ER tonight. Something is not right."
dogs,fdtoni7,t3_en16fk,1578719829.0,"Honestly, I would go back to the vet, and I might even go to the ER, especially if they didn't get x-rays to begin with. Show these videos to the vet too. Do not let him jump up or down on anything until you get this figured out.

I am not a vet, but to me, it really looks like his gait is not normal. It looks like there is something wrong with his back legs or back, that is causing him pain and making him walk oddly. I was really surprised when I read back and double checked he is in fact three, because this looks similar to the gait of an elderly dog (maybe because elderly dogs are often the ones with back or leg pain.) Again, not a vet, but to me it doesn't look like he is walking that way just due to being anxious or fearful. I work at a vet, and a large portion of the dogs we see are very nervous and frightened to be at the vet, and this doesn't look like a typical gait for that.

Your vet probably got some x-rays, did they show anything? I suggest either going back into your vet, or getting a second opinion ASAP, especially if they didn't take x-rays yet. What painkillers did your vet prescribe, and have they seemed to make any difference at all? If you try another vet and they still can't find anything, you should go to a neurologist.

Look closely at his back legs as he walks. To me, the walk seems really uneven, and he seems to be holding his legs in a weird position, almost out to the side but tucked under. You know your dog better than I though, is this his usual walk? Does he walk normally in the daytime? Are you sure he's totally normal during the daytime? It also looks like he keeps wanting to sit, but it hurts to do so. He keeps trying to, but sometimes can't bring himself to put his butt all the way on the ground.

I kind of really doubt this is behavioral, I think he's in pain, and I would not be at all surprised if he has a pinched disk or something. I really recommend going back to the vet tomorrow or even tonight, as he just looks like he's in pain, and it looks like it hurts for him to sit down, and walking hurts too. I would not let him jump up or down on anything at all until you get this figured out, or do anything that's going to put strain on his back, neck, spine, or back legs. If he worsens, go to the ER.

&#x200B;

If you see another vet, and they say it's not medical, and you're really absolutely convinced it's not a physical ailment, or to rule out an external factor, I would try spending a few hours some night (or a whole night!) in a totally different location that he isn't uncomfortable in to see if it's the same somewhere else. This will help rule out an environmental factor that may be scaring him that you aren't aware of. I've heard stories of neighbors getting those sound devices that deter dogs, and them being more powerful than you think, or you could have something in your home that for some reason scares him but only at night time. After all he is a rescue, so you don't know what random thing he could possibly associate with something traumatic. There could be some noise or smell that happens at your house that you can't hear or smell that he has a bad association with or even a noise that hurts his ears maybe. The other option would be of course getting a trainer.

I'd really start with medical though, as if it is medical, and he's in pain, you want to get this sorted as quickly as possible, especially because you don't know if the problem could worsen."
dogs,fdt02pu,t1_fdnrxfx,1578710180.0,"Well you got it taken care of before it got infected, and that when the pain is the worst and when it gets dangerous, and that's what's important. It's really hard to notice when dogs get cracks or decay, because they really won't tell you often times."
dogs,fdszlgv,t1_fdndil0,1578710002.0,"Oh, I'm so sorry, I know it's scary. But really, a think a big reason it's scary for people is because they hear horror stories from when veterinary medicine wasn't as advanced. I was shocked when I started working at a vet, by how rare it is to have complications. Given, my vets are really good, but still I had gone in thinking the risks of anesthetic were so much higher than they are I guess. I asked my vets once if they had ever lost a dog during a dental, because after seeing hundreds and hundreds of dogs come in and out and leave happy, I have not seen them have a single complication. They said they heard one of the vets did once, many years ago, but they weren't sure if it was a dental or not. In the past few years, the practice has surely performed thousands of dentals. I know that's just my practice, but still it puts things into perspective. You can ask your vet what anesthetic they will use, and how safe it is, and I'm sure what they tell you will make you feel better.

There are never any guarantees of safety with anything, not with a dental procedure, and not crossing the parking lot to walk into the vet, but that doesn't mean something is likely to happen. You will feel much better when he's all done with his procedure and grumpily snoozing on your couch, giving you looks when you're too loud, and you'll wonder why you were even worried I bet."
dogs,fdsx8d2,t1_fdnryzj,1578709120.0,"VERY true. Cats are even better at hiding pain, many of them won't give any indication whatsoever. It's not uncommon for a cat to have an abscess and the only real sign is the enormous swelling on their face. And it is much better to not ever ever let it get to that point of course."
dogs,fdswwsn,t1_fdnrcmz,1578708999.0,"This seems very unusual to me. Are you in an area that doesn't have the greatest vet care? I would look around for a really good vet, and have it done there.

The vet I work at, dentals are our most common procedure so we probably do an average of 5-10 a week, and I've worked there for one year, and never seen a dog die or come close from a dental. I asked the vet once if it had ever happened, and they told me I couldn't tell clients this, because we can't give clients the idea that it's impossible, but they only knew of one dog at the clinic, and they couldn't remember if it was even a dental, and the dog was very old and had a variety of illnesses, and it was many years ago. So I have to imagine the incidence at our clinic is something like 0-0.1%. Maybe it's just because we have really great doctors, but still."
dogs,fdsujwb,t1_fdnuk6a,1578708124.0,"Our vets will do hand-scaling without general sometimes and that seems to work out fine. I know there is only special circumstances that they do this in, but I'm not totally sure what they are. Or are you talking about something else?"
dogs,fdsq5g0,t1_fdn2jzb,1578706500.0,"Well the important thing is you took it seriously. You would be very surprised how many people are mention a broken tooth at a check up appointment as if it's nothing. I'm sure the antibiotic is helping if it's infected, and he'll feel have it out soon enough. Good for you for taking it seriously, getting him in, and proceeding with the vets advice."
AskVet,fdmfvod,t3_em23db,1578548529.0,"It can be very difficult to tell exactly what needs to be done with teeth just by looking at a picture, but for a five year old dog that has build-up, it is likely your vet will recommend a dental cleaning, and this is something that should be taken seriously. Cost at our clinic is often roughly around $300, not including extractions, but it may be very different depending on the area.

Like with humans, pain from teeth often is not made worse by pressure unless it has progressed to a quite concerning level, which hopefully will never be the case if your dog receives regular tooth cleanings and extractions that are need. If you have had a tooth ache, think back. Did it hurt to press on it, or did it hurt at random times, and/or all the time, regardless of pressure?

It's also not uncommon for dogs not to show too many signs of tooth pain if they show it at all. Dogs can do a good job of hiding pain, seemingly especially teeth pain. If they do find a tooth that needs to be extracted, it is highly recommended that you not leave the tooth in, as tooth pain can get very, very bad, and leaving a tooth that should be removed can cause serious infection as well.

Teeth cleaning can also help prevent teeth from getting to the point where they do need to be extracted or cause serious pain or dangerous infection. I recommend finding a vet you trust to do your pet's dental cleaning, and following their recommendations. Ignoring teeth that are dead or dying will lead to more pain, and eventually very likely much more money than getting the cleanings done, and any teeth extracted that need to be. If you don't trust that your vet will only extract teeth that are likely to soon cause serious pain or infection, find a vet you trust, as this relationship is important.

Many humans are lucky enough as to have never had serious nerve pain in a tooth, and most westerners have probably not experienced a tooth infection, but it is very painful and serious. You cannot treat serious decay at home, and unfortunately even good oral hygiene is not a replacement for dental cleanings and extractions when needed."
AskVet,fdmdeho,t3_em2fae,1578546308.0,"Hello, not a vet, but I would say I recommend speaking with your vet about these concerns. I know it's tricky, because clients can sometimes feel judged when questioning what is necessary, but your vet wants what's best for your pet too, and understands it's important to consider finances and quality of life when making your decisions. They will know best to what extent the worms have taken up residence, and how long it will take to produce more symptoms. Vets aren't there to judge, but to give you the knowledge you need to make the best choices for your pets with available resources.

I will say I believe vets generally do recommend doing the treatment even if the dog is older, because the heartworms do have a significant impact, but beyond that I would call your vet and just talk to them about the concerns you shared here. You can leave a message for your vet, and they can email or call you back to talk about this."

My dog is my dog. I just want to be able to share and communicate about her triumphs and hardships without everything being completely overshadowed by a breed she has in her mix. She has Boxer in there too, and fairly dominantly for the percentage, and those traits are things I want to talk about too, but no one can see past the freaking pit. She's a dog, just like any other. I care about the breeds that go in of course, like she's going to have a higher prey drive, but mostly I care about herself as a being.

The other doggies do have manners too, but many of them are elderly or small or protecting this or that... They're good pups too, but they all certainly had more demands and things from other dogs, while my baby just worked to try to not offend anyone.

It just feels so great to have other people share in our pride for my girl being the goodest pup ever! Thank you!"
dogs,fcmd0mv,t1_fcmbxgl,1577770940.0,"I blocked two of the people, the third I reported and didn't block yet because since they are following me and spreading hate on a pride post, I hope and believe r/dogs will temp or permanent ban them, and I want to follow through with it.
I have perspective, but if more people want to be nasty to me rather than give a simply thumbs up, when I post about how great my dog is, that's upsetting to me. When the only comment I get about how great my dog is, is that she'll give ""ouch bites"" and then that person follows me around on engagement ring sites, I'd just rather not post.

Who wants to post on how great their dog is, if the result is that you get some downvotes, comments about how your dog most love to bite, and then someone writing nasty things in your unrelated posts? I'd rather not post at all.

And I already blocked two people today, I can't remember what one was upset about regarding pits, but the other was telling me I was a ""pit nutter"" for telling a woman how inspiring her story of abuse and saving the dog in the middle was. Simply because that dog was a pit.

It's too much. So I am hoping I can get some support to ask the mods to up the stakes. I am hoping when people simply post about normal things regarding pits, bringing up the whole BSL thing will be banned, unless the post specifically brings that up. We shouldn't have to get hate for posting normal stuff about our dogs that happen to be pits or pit mixes. And the mods are very on their stuff and caring. So I'm hoping with some support, they will hear that we want things to be a bit more harsh when bringing up a pointless battle for people that just want their dog to be a dog."

I wish I could just move on, but some days it's really hard to feel the only people that care about my dog's accomplishments are people who want to kill her. My proud post should never have negative votes. She was a good girl. I should never have received hate for congratulating an abused woman on getting out just because her dog happened to be a pit.

They wrote something like ""Does your dog get carried away and sometimes give ouch kisses"" Or something worded really weird. I thought maybe they meant do we carry her around, and does she give kisses when someone has an ouch. We don't really carry her much 'cause she's pretty big, but she'll for sure give me kisses when I stub my toe or whatever.

Turns out all they thought from my pride at my dog doing wonderfully, with the other 6 dogs and many small humans running around at Xmas, was that she was a pit. ""Ouch kisses"" is I suppose a term for bites? Not really sure, it's kind of a stupid term for bites, but whatever.

:(.

I'm proud of my baby girl, even if other's only care about her breed and don't want to hear about how she thoughtfully avoided the kitchen and the couch for two of the grumpy growling dogs, cleared out of moving areas two of the Dachshund mixes were guarding, and was careful not to intimidate two of the scaredy cat dogs that would say angry things if a dog paid too much attention. Not to mention how great she was with the kids, because of who she is as a dog, which is awesome as heck. Means nothing that she came and got me when the dogs growled or tried to attack. She's a pit mix, and a rescue, so apparently I can't be proud of her. Well screw them. She wouldn't bite those jerk posters, but I sure will.

My posts aren't saying every pit bull is the best dog in the land. But why can't I be excited when the dog I saved and love does so great a job, I couldn't expect that from any animal on the planet?

She'll definitely attempt the standard dog licks to any scrape or toe stub that I incur. I'm sure she would too with the dogs and kids, but for scrapes or ouches, both kids and dogs need their space and their owner or parent, so we usually give them a few minutes and see what they'd like to do, and then if they want to come over that's fine. That's a cute term though, but for her it's more like ""ouch concerned looks and wondering if she should help."""

Rocky is going to be so happy never having to be around the mean guy that made him feel like his place was only temporary. You are going to be so pleased to see him flourish into an even more beautiful confident version of himself without that idiot ex around. Bella will surely be pleased to, to not have to worry about the crazy guy. You're babies are going to be so pleased, and they always seem to know what you did for them.

If anyone else reads this, just know what the chip says is NOT as important as what people think. Possession truly is a huge part of the law, but another big part is whom is willing to fight for the pet, and who cares for them the best, etc. Sure, if you get the woman you mentioned to agree to transfer ownership to you, and surely she will, certainly do this, as it may help. Also, take him to the vet, give him a good home, and let it be known his previous owner wanted to freaking ""release him into the wild"" where he would probably die. 

So ladies, while it helps to have the chip registered to you, do not feel it is necessary. Establish joint ownership, use your name at the vet and pay with your card, pay for his food, and hide the dog when you kick your ex out. Extra points for a text about him ""releasing him into the wild."" Dog ownership is much more than a chip, and a big part of it is maintaining possession of the dog, showing financial and other care of the dog, and just being willing to fight for the dog.

That being said, make sure his previous owner knows what the guy would have done and have her sign over ownership, because that is going to be a huge thing that makes him understand any legal action would be ridiculous, but ladies, know it could probably still be done without. The most important thing is NEVER let him take the dog with him. Most dead beat exes won't even challenge you legally, but if they do, him being in your care is very good."
dogs,fcj6cpn,t1_fc44syc,1577678370.0,"Breed bans don't make the problem go away. They don't even help. What else is there to say?

If you want solutions from people who spend their lives around dogs and understand behavior and ownership, we're all here, ready to help, most of all trainers and veterinary behaviorists who could fix it if anyone would listen and implement the appropriate steps. Sadly, they have learned humans are so stuck in their ways, any advice that doesn't blame dogs, but rather call for humans to change, will fall on deaf ears. More kids, elderly, and just great people will die. It sucks. Some places will attempt breed bans, which will fail, like every other place, so more people will die in the fruitless attempt. In the end, angry people don't care about facts, they'll still kill all the Dobies, Rottweilers, or Pits (depending on the era), despite the fact that that has never helped. It's sad, but all anyone with college level stats and a  rudimentary level of dog behavior can do, is try to occasionally throw truths out there so anyone smart enough can listen. Most don't.

I have tried so hard, I have appealed to sense, to logic, to mathematics, to canine behavior, NONE of it matters. All these people care about is pit bulls kill more than other dogs. So do minorities in the US, but that doesn't mean they are inherently more dangerous. Westerners want to do anything but say society is even partially the culprit and could fix things. Fine. Have fun with that, society. I'm sorry to people who die because of that, to children, I tried to save you. I tried.

In the meantime, you guys do what you want as you will anyway. We all try to give you the answer, if you wanted to ignore it, well I did my part. It's not my responsibility at this point. Would it have made more sense to, idk require a super brief temperament test for all dogs or of even a certain few breeds to allow them to remain unaltered barring medical necessity? Sure. It wouldn't have stopped all attacking, but it may have helped, especially if they did all breeds, and according to those that think it's all DNA, it should have eliminated any dog attacks (not true, but any breeding temperament test may have helped a bit.) But everyone wants to just kill a bunch of dogs to make sure it doesn't even at all seem like it's a problem people have. So go have fun, irresponsible people, and know this is ALL your fault. ALL of the dog behaviorists, CPDTS, vets, even the freaking CDC, ALL of the experts, they TRIED. They tried to save the kids, save the elderly, save all the innocent bystanders.

dogs,fc29txp,t1_fc0si5k,1577347559.0,"Agreed, and it's not really fair to expect your vet to solve that for you. I have the best vets at my vet hospital, and they always refer out when needed, but some people expect them to have behavior advice, and act like they are bad vets if they don't feel comfortable with it. It's infuriating. We've had people that wanted info from the vet on why their turtles were giving each other ""funny looks."" 

Or I had a call from a lady that wanted the vets to call her in their spare time and chat about how she felt the wildlife rehab facility and state authority on veterinary medicine didn't know enough on how to catch injured wild geese in a way that stressed them out the least as a mating pair. I guarantee there is not veterinary class on that for most vets, and I believe most vets have not had tons of experience catching wild geese. That's like if I called a doctor and asked wanted them to call me and chat about the least stressful way to catch whatever teen keeps tee-peeing my house, or some feral children I believe live on the street. That's clearly not standard medicine.

Vets hire behaviorists and trainers too, perhaps more than most people, because they know what a great benefit an expert can provide on specific aspects of pets, as they are experts on specific aspects themselves."

dogs,fc26lpq,t1_fbxwt3n,1577342757.0,"Tl;dr: warning is often different with different dogs, but the warning signs are often with past situations. If a dog nips and snaps and growls and gets upset at each new houseguest until finally one day they get up the courage to cause a level three bite upon the houseguest entering, that isn't without warning. The owners just ignored every previous warning the dog gave.

And when a dog you've never seen before shows up, you should treat that dog with caution, because the dog is unknown to you. If the dog begins to attack, with it's body, that's body language, and the message is that the dog is trying to do damage to you and you should try to get away from the dog. Attacking is like the most clear body language and it means I want to hurt you."
dogs,fc26db6,t1_fbxwt3n,1577342441.0,"I'm not saying every dog give a clear warning directly before reacting in every situation, that's absolutely not true. And dogs really differ in how they warn anyway. But when I'm using warning there, I'm saying warning signs period. Many warning signs come from dogs showing aggression signs in specific situations much earlier. For instance, at the vet, our absolute BEST warning is their file, not how the dog act at the time. Every dog that has reacted aggressively has a warning in their file describing what triggers them, and this is just as important as how a dog responds that specific visit.
The last home visit I went on, we had three older dogs, all very excited to see us, showing us toys, getting belly rubs, so pleased to invite us into their home. The Lab did great with vaccines, and wasn't bothered at all by blood draw. So even though the dog had a low level caution in the file, the vet decided to give the nail trim a whirl, but was ready to react, which was good because out of nowhere he lunged and tried to bite her, seeming out of nowhere. That's really not uncommon. The warning sign was that he had reacted aggressively before, as his file said, so our vet was ready, and she upgraded his caution level after the visit so any vet will use a muzzle next time. 
If a trigger occurs there may not be much warning in the moment, which is why owners must be very vigilant in recognizing warning signs, and why vets keep a caution section.
My pittie mix is not okay with other dogs on leash. Off leash, she is great, whatever dog, whatever size, she's all good with the possible exception or being attacked or being shocked by another dog she didn't know was there. If she met a dog on leash, it would probably look like she was aggressive without warning, but we've had plenty of warnings that she can't meet new dogs on leash, so we don't, ever. We've been bitched out by family and friends for ""overreacting"" and not just letting her meet dogs on leash, we've been pressured and told we were being crazy and overprotective, but we don't care. We listened to her warnings, and we've held hard and fast, and we just won't do it. If a dog is reactive enough to where they must be leashed to meet, they just aren't going to meet. She's so sweet off leash, and so patient, so NO ONE except our certified trainers understands, but she told us how she feels and we respect that. She warned us, and if we kept letting her meet dogs on leash, I'm sure people would say she snapped without warning, but she has told us repeatedly that it's something she just cannot do.
Like our trainer talks about, dogs don't really go from 0 to 60. But they also don't go from 30 to 20 either. Aggression or bites only really go up. So if a dog nips and growls at someone coming into the house, even if at the time they don't give other warnings, next time they may well give a real bite without first doing a warning. Their past nips and growls are the warning. When any dog crosses threshold, their past is the best indicator of their possibility to react.

That being said, with our dog, her body language does tell us what's going on too, she just doesn't growl or bark or anything until she crosses threshold, but then it's already a bad situation. This only happens really when she's on leash, so it's easy to avoid, but she certainly shows it then too, it's just that every dog may show things differently. Some dogs bark and growl, she get's much too intense, and fixates and has bodily reactions that show us it's too much, which is why we just don't have her meet dogs on leash.

Dogs really don't ever snap without warning, or at least I have never seen it or heard any story that has merit, and I've seen a lot of dogs bite, and gotten a dozen at least. Their history is often the warning, although it's also very possible their body language may warn as well.

The biggest thing I learned from working with dogs is that they don't do anything for no reason, humans just often don't put in the work to understand the reasoning, which is really too bad."
dogs,fbx0jk7,t1_fbww3fd,1577164842.0,"This is basically bull. I work at a vet's office with some of the finest vets in the area, and you can find some scary story with any breed. Surely especially pits, because they tend to have really crappy stories, even when you can't prove it. It's just not reasonable. Dog's are generally not unpredictable, I don't care what breed, and lots of our vets in fact decide to adopt pits. Would they really do so if these dogs were crazy and psychopaths? No, these posts are just silliness. I could also post some big stories of cats and dogs of different breeds and make it seem that they all of a sudden ""snapped,"" but dogs pretty much don't ever snap without warning, some people just don't listen to warning signs. Springer rage is a concern, but it's so uncommon people don't worry about Springer Spaniels killing them, and Springer Spaniels are the most common breed to embody this out-of-nowhere violence. Dogs really don't ""snap,"" that's pretty much a myth.

If you have a large dog and you aren't skilled in canine behavior, it is best to get a trainer to evaluate to teach you a bit about dogs. This applies to every breed. We had a woman hospitalized this week after a cat's fear signs were ignored, and it bite and it was bad. This cat had been with the family for 7 years, but the cat had been showing more and more anxious signs. Anyway, it's not a bad idea to get a trainer to get a feel for your pup.

I'm so tired of people saying pit bulls are all about biting. There are so many good pits, just like there are so many good dogs, and if you aren't experienced, with any dog, you should get a trainer at least briefly. Pit bulls are just as often awesome with people as any other dog. And their are some really dorky gooses who want to be adorable about it. Either way, it's super freaking annoying for people that know nothing about anything to assume these dogs should be blacklisted. It's dumb people, and those people aren't worthy of responding too.

I work at a vet, and many of my best vets have some really cool pits. Be careful with any dog, but pits bulls are dogs just like any other, maybe more dog aggressive. That's all."
