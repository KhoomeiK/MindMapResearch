funny,ff7w2uu,t1_ff788e0,1579659734.0,"I have two cats. One of them was very fat when I adopted him. I fed and continue to feed them in seperate areas of the kitchen, each with their own bowl, with a measuring cup to measure their food. When I wake up, when I go to work (half day shifts) and when I get home. Manually feeding your cats ensures that they are getting fed and also costs ~$100 less than an automatic feeder."

funny,ff7vdl2,t1_ff7pvxe,1579659255.0,"My cat is 16 years old this year, a good weight, can still jump straight up in the air to catch a treat that I'm holding at about 6' and looks as spry as ever. His diet has had grains in it all his life. My other cat is 13, and I've had him most of his life and he eats just the same as the first cat. When I adopted him, he weighed in at 21 lbs, and he's now only 9 lbs. So yeah, when people want to go on this grain free diet rant, I just roll my eyes."
UpliftingNews,ff7spbk,t1_ff7rymc,1579657428.0,"Lmao, no. A lot of theaters have them because it would be impossible to clean between sets without them. A lightly trashed theater still took about 15-20 for two ushers to clean when I worked."
UpliftingNews,ff7rg3m,t1_ff7e658,1579656557.0,"I saw a bloody tooth once. Like, someone just yanked out their tooth and dropped it on the ground."
UpliftingNews,ff7r9bl,t1_ff77w4p,1579656426.0,"Currently working at a hibachi restaurant. The meals are messy to begin with, since the chefs are there to entertain. But Jesus christ... Stop letting your children pick up handfuls of rice and throw them everywhere. People say ""well, babies are babies."" A.) that's not a baby. That'd a 5 year old. And B.) I've seen parents handle their actual babies in a better manner and stop them from throwing fits and creating huge messes so idk.... Sounds like a you thing."
UpliftingNews,ff7qytp,t1_ff75x5x,1579656218.0,"I didn't mind people bringing their own food and would usually just look the other way when I saw it during checks, but only as long as they picked up after themselves."
UpliftingNews,ff7qnfr,t1_ff7pxzq,1579655999.0,I like what you did there
UpliftingNews,ff7qht2,t1_ff75oqp,1579655892.0,"Yeah, Shrek 2 was a nightmare opening weekend. The garbage was over 5' tall when we managed to push it all the way up to the front."
UpliftingNews,ff7qdy6,t1_ff787y5,1579655817.0,Are..... We not talking about people and their ability to throw away trash or am I confused?

UpliftingNews,ff73i5w,t1_ff72doy,1579640385.0,"Unlike the theater during a children's movie where the parents are just like ""Eh, let the ushers do their job"" and that's how they end up breaking out leaf blowers to clean the theater in 20 minutes because of the mountains of fucking garbage everywhere. Fuck parents who don't teach their children manners."
UnethicalLifeProTips,ff4m0hq,t1_ff42stu,1579566859.0,"Or a ""cherry Pepsi"" and you try to say you don't have that and they already know ""just go mix Pepsi with grenadine"""
UnethicalLifeProTips,ff3rlj5,t1_ff38uvu,1579547341.0,"Nothing makes my day more than a family coming in and their children being polite. From 4 year olds to teenagers, hearing them say please and thank you is just.... ðŸ‘Œ

Then you get the families with little brats who can't be bothered to tell you what they want to eat because they're too busy texting Becky on their phone, or running around the place getting into everything. Babies throwing shit absolutely everywhere. All while the parents are enjoying their alcohol and talking amongst themselves. Go ahead, Johnny. Drink your soda in 2 minutes again. See how long it takes for that refill to come. Idgaf about my tip, I just want you to leave."

IdiotsInCars,ff2oham,t1_ff1zvp7,1579516378.0,"I live on a narrow dead end street and the school buses like to go all the way up the hill and then force whoever was behind them to drive backwards down the hill with them because they can't turn around. God help of there was snow or ice. All so the children won't have to walk an extra 10th of a mile. No, they're not disabled."
IdiotsInCars,ff2oaif,t1_ff281gm,1579516090.0,"I've never had winter tires. Place I live now doesn't need them, but sometimes I drive up in the snowy north. I've never had issue, even when the snow was up past my bumper (fwd sedan.) I just drive slow and not slam the gas. Kills me that people who can go faster will tailgate and try to harass me like it's going to make me go any faster."
IdiotsInCars,ff2o3he,t1_ff2gk5i,1579515796.0,"We get training. And have to have an instructor come with us for our driver's test. Just once though.... When we first get our license. Then over time, people just keep thinking that they're right and nobody tells them otherwise.

awfuleverything,fed0b1q,t1_fecy5sc,1578992275.0,"The lights in the city I live in are weight based or something like that. There aren't many zebra crossings, just the two white lines that tell you where to stop. I see so many idiots go across those lines and stop and then wonder why the fuck the light isn't changing. Or worse, stop completely before the censor and hold up traffic since nobody can move forward to trigger it."
wholesomememes,febnpdp,t1_feb3dii,1578960778.0,You know what I love? A man explaining what all women think as if we are a singular organism. As if we're so far different from men that men should buy books explaining our behaviors. Fucking lol

Only downside is, there's not a whole lot of older buildings, but that's a personal preference."

NoStupidQuestions,fdwp3by,t1_fdvr78h,1578760975.0,"I sometimes wonder if this is the thing with a lot of fear about spiders or other bugs. My parents and older brother never really cared much about them other than to get them out of the house, so I never developed any sort of phobia. But I know people who will scream and run at the sight of a spider or bug."
