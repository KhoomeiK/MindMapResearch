PoliticalHumor,febotpu,t1_fea1jh2,1578961094.0,"""Socialism"" covers a broad swath of ideologies, not one of which is remotely similar to fascism, which is a far-right extreme authoritarian ideology. The Nazis weren't socialists, either; they were authoritarians and economic centrists.

If you're looking for an authoritarian ""socialist"" ideology, you'd have to look at state capitalism like the later CCP and USSR. 

Communism is even further economically from fascism, and covers more ideological ground even than socialism. You range from Stalinism and Maoism on one end, all the way down to anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism on the other.

Compared to classical and social libertarianism, which occupy the ideological center of both main political axes, democratic socialists and social Democrats are more left-wing and less authoritarian. Republicans - including classical conservatives, neocons, and Trumpist NatCons - are universally more right-wing and more authoritarian. 

Bottom line: The GOP has *far* more in common with Mussolini than any American socialist."

Later on in the song, ""I'd have sworn that with time, thoughts of you would leave my head"" is unambiguously addressing his love.

""Stay close to me; don't let me be alone"" is ambiguous - he's either pleading with his love to come back, or asking the bottle to keep him company since it's all he has left. Very possibly both.

The patois verses in the UB40 version are \*obviously\* addressed to the bottle. ""I'm gonna hold on to you because I know you love true"" - unlike his former love."
