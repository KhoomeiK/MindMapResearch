I got away with it by dealing with it myself, HARD. If I'd had help, the bully would have gotten 3 days of ISS and maybe gotten to talk to a counselor. Because I had to worry about zero tolerance, the bully got caught doing something illegal off school premises and got arrested and kicked out of school. Of course, I didn't set him up in any way, I just followed his dumb ass around until I saw him doing something stupid, and then called the cops. It was that, or get my ass handed to me every day through high school, because if I brought it to a teacher I would have also been expelled. 

Again, zero tolerance only helps the school, it doesn't help anyone else.

Chattanooga,ff6nu24,t3_erxr64,1579631167.0,"Ok, so your post is mostly negative things about you. Not negative as in bad, but negative as in things you won't do.

First, I would either post here or just make a list of 5-10 things you would like to do socially. Many of us who are alone get hung up on being lonely, and forget that being with people usually means cooperatively doing something together. 

After you make your list, rank them in terms of how passionate you are about them (or just in terms of preference if you feel you're more passionate about your solo projects, and not necessarily about your social recreation).

Now that you are really clear on what you'd like to do, go to meetup to find something, or if there isn't something, come here to this subreddit and throw up a post like ""Hey, would anyone in the area be interested in joining a *insert activity here* group? I'm  a person in their *age range* just looking to *do activity* and maybe make some friends. Use the comment section to work out the details, and voila, you have a YOU controlled meetup group specifically focused around doing something YOU like to do.

Now, as for making friends once you start meeting new people. I'm guessing you're still relatively young (20s-30s), but feel free to correct me on that. The trick to making friends is to realize that after age ~25, everyone is pretty much dealing with the same sort of shit day in and day out, and you have to open your mind a bit more as far as age goes. A 10 year old is going to have vastly different interests than a 15 year old, a 20 year old even more, but a 25 year old and a 30 year old, even a 40 year old or a 60 year old are all perfectly capable of having the same interests. People who are married are also capable of holding the same interests as people who are single, and just as the fact that they are married doesn't define them as individuals, the fact that you are single shouldn't preclude you from making married friends or doing anything you really want to do. If you are starting from 0 friends, you must first lower the bar on meeting people, because the best way to make a few good friends is to make a bunch of alright acquaintances (same goes for finding a date, if you're interested in that. People love setting up their friends).

Now that you're meeting a bunch of people, you must make an effort to learn about them while you are doing X activity together. Ask them questions about themselves. Some good examples:

- So you like *this activity*, do you have anything else you're passionate about? When they answer, if you're familiar with it, don't just swap stories, tell them you also do X, and ask them a follow up question about their experience with it. ""Oh, you like to read? What genre? Oh man I love sci-fi. Who's your favorite author? etc.""

- How do you like Chattanooga/*place they live*?

Just any question that you can follow up with more detailed questions about, or to get them talking. Eventually, unless they're totally self absorbed, they'll ask you about you, BUT, the great thing is, even if they don't, by virtue of you asking them questions, they will automatically feel closer to you as a person. Remember, you have your whole life to tell stories about you, but only a limited amount of time to learn about other people, so if you spend your time focused on finding out about others, eventually it will all even out.

Eventually, doing this, you're going to meet some really great people. The next step is through asking questions about them, finding other social things they like to do, and invite them out to do that. THEN, to enter the friend zone, you'll need to get their contact info, and actively participate in a friendship. If you see a meme that reminds you of them, send it to them. If you have a question, text it. If you feel like hanging out but don't want to do whatever the activity is, ask them if they'd feel up to joining you. BAM, you got friends."

AskReddit,few1oel,t1_fevqxbn,1579404222.0,"Well, as for me, most recently, I was building a mantle for our fireplace (we just moved into a new house and realized we didn't have anywhere to hang stockings), and was pre drilling holes out in my wood shop. I set my drill down, or I think I did, to grab the measuring tape and the tape was missing, so I went looking for it. The wife wasn't home, so I rummaged around for a half hour and found it in between books on our bookshelf in the second floor of the house, then turned around, went outside to my shop, did my measuring, and went for my drill. My drill was missing at this point, so I went back in the house, couldn't find it, and called my wife. She directed me to the bathroom counter, which was correct, though I really would swear I neither used the bathroom AND had already checked in my first search.

I have developed a system to prevent these occurrences. I must actively decide where an object goes, and no matter what, put it back in that place even if I only need to set it down for a moment. Objects with places only go missing a quarter of the time. My wife calls me the absent minded professor because of my power and the fact that my interests are extremely varied so I tend to have approximate knowledge of many things, just not where I've put them. I have lost tools half way between picking them up off the table and using them at my bench. It gets frustrating.

My wife on the other hand, regularly gets calls from her long time friends from when they can't find something in their own house. She's either 100% right or she tells them she doesn't know. She never guesses, and yet she only says she doesn't know about 2% of the time. When we go over somewhere for dinner and she goes to help out in the kitchen, she usually navigates it better than whomever owns it, and has freaked out new friends more than once this way. We have had to call someone at random and ask what my wife's super power was on speaker phone to de-escalate the situation before. Also, the more random the object is and the more randomly placed it is, the more it upsets my wife when she performs her trick. She doesn't actively practice it (except for with me) and she's embarrassed by it, despite the fact that everyone we know loves her for it. The one weakness we've found is her ability only works on places she's seen and people she's met."

A D&D based Diablo II style game with 3 classes, Warrior, Conjurer, and Wizard. The campaign only had three separate story paths, but they were each tremendously entertaining and endlessly replayable in their own right. The versatility of each class was amazing. The warrior was smooth, fast, and beastly. The Conjurer could charm literally any creature in the game if you could survive long enough against them, and summon creatures from the bestiary as it learned about them. The wizard had spells on spells on spells, based off magic the gathering, with spell combinations and traps.

And best of all, it had a thriving multiplayer PvP with games like capture the flag and death matches, a sort football like game as well. AND they came out very shortly after with a free coop campaign.

You said ""So you're saying blue walls are ok? Everybody knows she painted that wall blue. What if you walked in on her painting that wall blue? Would you believe it was green? What if Dave ""Blue Walls"" McGee had said he painted the walls green? Then the walls wouldn't be blue?""

Do you understand how insane that sounds? You're being upvoted because people don't like being anywhere near the conversation and want to be seen as anti rape, but you have to know that I am not in any way defending rape. I am saying that in this very specific circumstance, IF (IF!!!) she is being truthful, then the situation is not rape. If your COMPLETELY MADE UP CIRCUMSTANCE that you JUST KNOW happened is correct, in which she took advantage of him as he was passed out, THEN YES, IT IS RAPE. Of course it's rape. That's ridiculously easy to pin down as yes, it was rape. But you just can't assume she's lying because ""no one in their right mind would be telling the truth"", and then use that to somehow accuse me of defending rape when I'm taking about a totally separate scenario.

IF IT DID NOT HAPPEN EXACTLY AS SHE DESCRIBED IT, IT WAS RAPE."

I know its implied that he doesn't want to kill, and I get what you mean, but comics really don't convey how fragile people are. In the comics, it's ""if they're breathing when you leave the room you didn't kill them,"" but in reality Batman and Daredevil and the other heroes that ""don't kill"" would have killed maybe a third of the people they fought, and that's being generous.

tricities,fedowym,t1_fedl54a,1579016705.0,"tl;dr: i know it's long, but it's worth the read. patient side isn't seeing much yet, but it will, and employee side has been seeing the downhill slide for a very long time.

I worked for MSHA before, during, and after the merger with Wellmont to become Ballad Health. What you need to understand is that the client care isn't what suffers first, but its definitely happening now and more problems are on the way. First, MSHA increased their client services through an initiative that attracted some of the best physicians in the country and improved services such that they really were a world class healthcare organization (with the exception of some things, like behavioral health), however, in doing this they doubled and sometimes tripled procedure costs to cover the overspending to the point where they charge almost double the national average for procedures now that they are the only option in the area. They also put out soft-layoffs, or hiring and raise freezes, using their overspending as an excuse for this, resulting in drastically understaffing most departments and resulting in pay that is 35% below REGIONAL averages. So they charge twice as much, and only about 5% of their employees reap any of the benefits of that, which is a problem seeing as they are now both the only provider in the area and one of the largest employers in the region. But they don't have to worry about people going elsewhere, because A) where would they go, and B) They have an agreement to pay for a significant part of nursing school and other programs for those graduating from Quillen in exchange for a 3-5 year contract ensuring them a steady stream of captive employees who have to reimburse Ballad if they want to go somewhere that pays anywhere near something rationally acceptable. Then there are underprovided services that don't make money that Ballad has no interest in continuing, but will absolutely smash competition so that they are the only ones available. Several years ago now, there was a company looking to build a new mental health facility in kingsport, but because mental health doesn't make nearly the profit (funny how a non profit cares about this, right?) of a normal healthcare organization, they decided to show they could handle the local need and accepted LITERALLY anyone into woodridge for a time (i don't know if this is still the policy as I'm no longer employed there). Previously, woodridge had a blacklist of violent offenders, medically unfit, and other individuals that weren't allowed at the hospital because it wasn't equipped to handle them as Woodridge has never been an institution for violent offenders or those who need hospital bed and IV drip level of medical care. But because there was a waitlist of over 200 people, it looked like another facility for the area might be justifiable (and it really was), so they just opened the floodgates and let everyone in for as long as they could, didn't hire any new employees so the ratios of patients to caregivers was horrible, and the fact that patients were no longer appropriately screened led directly, as far as I believe, to 2 patient deaths (you'll note that officially woodridge doesn't have any patient deaths. this is because they bring over a stretcher, pick up the corpse, and haul it over to JCMC where it is declared dead in the ER, and therefore leaves woodridge out of it, but if a man or woman doesn't have a pulse for up to 6 hours pre arrival at the ER, I would say they didn't die there, wouldn't you?)

Anyway, this is getting long winded. Let me wrap it up by saying that I was privvy to some meetings and interoffice conversations that directly indicated that the idea was to get Ballad Health up and running, look like it was trying to comply with the COPA as best it could, and then overspend again to prove the need for massive layoffs, drive down patient care, and look as much as they could like a failing healthcare system without any competition so that one of the even BIGGER healthcare corporations could be approved to swoop in and buy it, which is something that would have NEVER been approved had there been more than one major organization in the area, and would just happen to lead to a MASSIVE payout to the members of the board, certain other people invested in the plan, and literally no one else.

Now you can take what I say with a grain of salt, because I no longer work there and can't provide proof, but these are things I saw with my own two eyes, and I will never not be happy to enlighten anyone who asks. Also, check out Alan Levine's past employment, as it seems that he's the guy they hire when they want to do THIS EXACT SORT OF THING."
