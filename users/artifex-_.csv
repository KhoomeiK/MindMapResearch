Hormones start to balance, I believe, and personal views typically become more rational. Living on your own in itself usually sets highschool ages apart by a mile. The way typical culture is structured is that most of your environmentally influenced mental maturity happens in the late teens to early twenties. You realize how much of a difference a couple years makes in these age ranges as you go through them, and, hopefully, you realize how you should be treated by others. 

It drives me up the wall that so many women's first relationships result in them getting treated poorly and they don't know anything else. A friend of mine has many thoughts on that, as she went through it herself. 
This even goes for friendships (as I'm realizing how I want to be treated isn't something to neglect).

I wish I could help you in some way. I'm sorry you experienced this trauma. I'm sorry people are assholes when behind a computer screen."

AskReddit,ff9e14q,t1_ff80rhc,1579710980.0,"I'm not sure that's a quality that makes someone boring, that's just missing social queues and generally being awkward. Someone could be very interesting, just surrounded by people who don't care about what they say. An environment of people not giving a shit about what people enjoy is what can make people appear boring because they don't think anyone cares about what they want to talk about.

My opinion is never being interested in hearing about something that directly relates to what you do or enjoy makes that person boring. You close yourself off to possibilities."

RocketLeague,feni1hb,t1_femopyc,1579285134.0,"I'll start throwing when people act aggressively toxic and I'm trying to be nice like yeah we all make mistakes, I'm not getting mad at yours. Then they go off on me and blame me for everything, and I really don't want to play with them anymore as it already makes me play worse because they are scrutinizing me rather than their play, so I just don't try as hard. They won't learn to not be toxic players, not anytime soon. I'm not going to reward them for straight up being dicks. I'm doing what makes me less miserable."
fuckepic,fen3474,t1_felcfrh,1579275909.0,"Or proper critical thinking. People think they think critically, but that is just false because it also means you're able to acknowledge information that doesn't align with your beliefs and build upon them with it, not just attack someone or ignore this information. Seriously, it's a problem I see everywhere. People just ignore information they don't like."

pathofexile,fdnonx2,t1_fdngx2s,1578590041.0,"Yeah, it's a coin flip, really. Either way nasty people harm innocents though. Tbh id rather have to just be more aware and pay attention to my trades than risk being targeted and banned for no reason just because I did something that made someone unhappy.

I don't know if they keep logs of trades. If they don't, that makes it easy to forge images for ""proof"". I don't know how they review reports, if it's ban first at threshold then review, or review then ban. But these are all possibilities. It's not so simple, though it might be easier if it were. 

Idk what do you think?"
wemetonline,fdnlu35,t1_fdn9mvc,1578588492.0,"Also if he tries pressuring or manipulating you into it, I'd be concerned. I don't know his nature, but I think your safety is important in this case, so awareness is good. I've known too many gals who've had bad experiences and didn't really realize what they experienced was  assault until much later because they had no reference of what it should be like. 

Just stay safe and make sure communication is good and it's all consensual. Good luck!!"
pathofexile,fdnfmgw,t1_fdnc78l,1578584777.0,"To play devil's advocate, it's possible they do this to prevent people from mass accusations of people they target. Not a perfect system, but I understand that thought.

Chill with the downvoting just because you read something that isn't thrashing this policy of ggg."

pathofexile,fdl6tgz,t1_fdl2pbf,1578518029.0,"One of the few ways to combat the complexity though is good organization. If you know what the bug relates to, you have an idea of where to look and can trace the possibilities further. good organization and readability means the dev is good because they are not building for the current problem, but for the future of the product, at least that's how I see it.

But that's for fixing bugs. We don't know how many they are aware of at any given time, before or after the community finds them. It's possible that many of the bugs people post about have already been found by QA, and now it's pushed off to the devs, but they also have to balance adding to polish or completing something. So the time cost of bad organization/design and readability gets out of hand when more bugs are found (I'd also argue these things can PREVENT bugs from happening because it's easy to understand how something is to be used and what will give it erroneous behavior, which is very important with so many people working on a project). A lot of bugs happen from mistakes like this. If you're able to limit what other people touch, you're able to limit the possibilities of bugs created from that trickling effect.

At least in my experience, stuff like that is the cause of a lot of problems within software. Big one would be reusable properties identified by strings with no reference to a standard (like static variables for specific properties). Causes a lot of issues when people who fat finger or who aren't familiar with how it's structured come and try to make something. 
Complexity grows and then it's easier to make mistakes the longer that design stays in there.

So my belief really is that the fact they are able to release these leagues on these short cycles with surprisingly few bugs with how complex the game is, the developers are very well organized (or just simply, good at their jobs) and understand their code."
pathofexile,fdkm9l2,t1_fdkf6mf,1578506485.0,"I imagine they really do have talented devs that know their engine and code base well. Despite performance issues, they are probably at least really good at organizing and abstracting their code. Not to mention passion for their game means harder workers"

pathofexile,fdh2v16,t1_fdgr6lh,1578414191.0,"I'm dedicating myself to making clowny off meta builds viable and affordable so people have reference to those skills that sound fun but they can't find many resources on or no one plays them :) it's probably the most fun I've had in awhile on Poe. I've never found much pleasure in just following some meta leaguestarter and feeling locked in to what they tell me. It's been great for learning the game and how to adjust builds and scale damage and balance defences.

First try has been charged dash with reference to the one existing build on poebuilds, but I rolled different class/asc. 

It's fun though, actually works pretty well, but I've invested a decent amount of currency into it, and it's a bit clunky at times, so I'll prob try to improve on it to make it better for league starts, but that hard commit to making this build has been wonderful."

The more cynical side of me says it's just people trying to put on an image about helping and caring for others, but in reality, they are shallow narcissists.

AskReddit,fcucayx,t1_fctk1o0,1577977631.0,"My feelings usually end up being something relating to that issues are much more complex than they seem. There are so many cogs moving everywhere, it's really hard to say on a lot of things. A large gripe I have with the general population is that not explicitly stating a side means you're their enemy and they can get nasty. Conversations are shut down in attempt to gain power over the other person (can happen with both types). Small things or semantics get picked up in an attempt to do the same thing. I've experienced this many times all around. I feel trapped, like I'm hated for trying to consider complexity (again, still guilty of the fast paced opinions and information consumption, but this is something I work on constantly not to do)

People associate being progressive with being open minded, but I don't believe that it's true in it's entirety. Being open minded also means being able to handle other ideas and perspectives in a respectful manner where the end goal is a better understanding of each other, at least how I see it. Questions are important, accusations are costly."
