I vary between 2 and 6 a day, depending how many meals I remember to eat them. Bowels seem better off for it."

Following a genital surgery, movement is difficult and painful but also necessary, and then you've got this body part that needs to be kept very clean, observed for changes, looked after in various ways. You or a caregiver will also be running around getting food, clean towels, ice packs, prescriptions, and whatever else. Being able to follow post-op protocol is key for preventing complications AFTER surgery, and shit's potentially exhausting for a while. I'd imagine being overweight or obese would make it even more difficult."

And because I like power, independence, testing what I can accomplish, doing something for my enjoyment instead of for other people, getting to eat lots of great things without having to really keep close track of them, feeling like there's something I have control over, getting ready for the apocalypse...

I'm also completely okay with eventually becoming more visibly muscular than some people think is at all proper for a woman (although my girlfriend thinks it's great and supports my goal to carry her around, so go her). For general societal benefit, I could've stayed as I was, at a healthy weight but relatively idle, and done nothing. So no, I'm doing this shit almost entirely for me."

Given what I've said, I'm obviously not a strict tracker, and I'd probably suck at sticking to any given plan early on. So what I tend to do (mostly to maintain or gain a little) is focus on macros and calorie density. If I decided to lose from here, I'd be looking at less calorie-dense stuff with more fiber, more of whatever macronutrient is satiating for me (people differ in what works for them), etc(along with trying to stay hydrated better and being doubly sure I'm not eating my boredom or work frustration).

I used that with my girlfriend when she was losing weight. For a while, she was super into these toaster strudels, and I was like, ""having tasted these, they're not worth almost 400 calories to me, I'd totally forget about them and then be hungry later. Are they worth that much to you? For this much, you could've had a good quantity of full-fat ice cream, or like an entire bowl of nacho cheese popcorn, or whatever else."" I started to occasionally measure things in strudels on the fly, here's a strudel worth of calories--and even without a specific, written-up plan, it was a quick way of gauging density and making calls about whether this food was likely to be filling, dense but yummy enough to be worth a ton of calories, disappointingly forgettable, or something else, and it seemed to help with decisions in the moment. So there are ways to eyeball roughly what's going on and make tweaks from day to day."
