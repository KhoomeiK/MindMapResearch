PoliticalCompassMemes,ffcx12w,t1_ffct786,1579809041.0,"I know of John Money. Though obviously the base premise was deeply flawed (that you can just change someone's gender purely based on socialization), the results of that study do not constitute any form of meaningful scientific finding for the same reason Unit 731's depraved ""experiments"" have no value. There was no scientific method. More contemporary research supports a biological component that influences some nebulous sense of gender identity, like several studies that found the amniotic fluid of transgender-identifying individuals tend to have higher levels of hormones corresponding to their identified gender. Broadly speaking, though, it's a highly-contentious topic with little reliable research, so it's difficult to feel comfortable making claims that there is any real scientific conclusion. Transgender people irrefutably exist, but we don't adequately understand what makes them tick."

Up to 75% of cases are never diagnosed. Other conditions like Mild Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome and Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome can result in an individual with a distinct mix of male and female characteristics, though. Individuals with PAIS in particular tend to have atypical genitals that score as neither distinctly masculinized or feminized. Interestingly, Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome tends to result in individuals with a male XY karyotype but with a female phenotype, including a normal (but infertile) vagina."

furry_irl,ff2f0j5,t1_ff2dznv,1579503393.0,"Yes, it indicates negation or absence- that‚Äôs precisely the point. In this case, it is the negation or absence of humanity.

furry_irl,ff2dvca,t1_ff0q247,1579502124.0,"No, they are objectively not human. The Google-provided definition is too narrow, though, and mistakenly assumes that all non-human animals lack intelligence or personhood when fictional ones exist that do.
