Here's my advice after 3 years: know your policy and be ready to go to metaphorical war. They will work within the policy and the law to do their best to minimize payments. You need to do the opposite and be a thorn in their side until you are satisfied. Come correct and bird dog their asses until you are satisfied. These slimy fucks will find any pinhole to use as an out.

Estimates cost money to produce, adjusters need wages, even the CSR in Mumbai is running ~$7/hr. Anything not in the policy is negotiable and you've got every right to counter or ask for documentation. They may have $4,500 as their initial offer on any total-loss roof. People accept it and they're good, minimal extra cost. If the insured refuses, they need to provide some kind of substantiation that what they are offering will indemnify you as defined in your policy. If they guarantee a brand new roof and the lowest bid is $6,000, they will need to pay that amount at least. If you start smelling shit don't hesitate to ask insurance to check their shoes. If their offer cannot make you whole as defined in the policy, your magic words are ""This is not adequate indemnification. Based on my research $X is the minimum to be made whole as defined by your policy. Provide me a way to be made whole with your offer or I will consider this an offer made in bad faith and will be reporting this to *State Insurance Authority*."" If you're right and the claim is <$10K they will fold like laundry because those kinds of issues can get expensive fast."

For a given location, raising a kid ""adequately"" is a fixed cost with a fairly set amount of labor involved. Unless they're part of a vanishingly small minority, the kids are not providing labor or otherwise generating income. Before you even account for custody issues, you've got half the resources to come up with the same thing. Working more or finding someone else takes significant time. I don't think I need to elaborate on the issues poverty can cause. Many single parents do make it work through no small effort, but many also leave their older kids to raise younger kids. The lack of supervision and stress can kneecap their potential and makes it more likely they'll be a parent before they're ready; and you've wound up with a cycle of broken families throughout generations."
