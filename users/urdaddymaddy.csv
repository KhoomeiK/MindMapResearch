relationships,ff1wxuh,t1_ff1wofm,1579488065.0,"Also if she is opposed to therapy, suggest doing yoga together or trying to follow along with a meditation video— both things you can do together to calm down. Or you can buy her a nice journal where she can write her thoughts down when she needs to vent but doesn’t want to talk to anyone."
relationships,ff1wofm,t3_er5rz9,1579487889.0,It seems like you care a lot about your girlfriend. The pill can seriously mess you up mentally because the hormones are not as localized as other forms such as the IUD. I would just let her know you are there for her and support her decision if she wants to explore options such as getting off the pill or changing her birth control method to something that could decrease mood swings. Often when women get emotional they just want reassurance and to know you care. Don’t act like you are walking on eggshells around her— just treat her normally and show you care. surprising her with chocolates and ice cream is never a bad idea. Give her a massage or set up a relaxing bath for her or even both of you. Good luck
relationships,ff1vp0m,t3_eqyinx,1579487231.0,Yeah this is not okay. Giant sign of emotional abuse. Trying to make you insecure most likely so you won’t leave them.

study,fcumsyz,t3_ehqrg0,1577984369.0,"For a lot of people I know (including myself), studying in a coffee shop or the library places a helpful social pressure on you to focus. In my head it’s like “oh look at all the people around you being productive, you can too! Put your phone away”. Being away from the comfort of your home also eliminates some distractions such as laying in bed or checking what’s in the fridge 10 times. 
Good luck!"
premed,fa1pj9s,t3_e7m5wj,1575772781.0,"What works for me is setting a goal before studying. Such as ""Get through these 2 lectures"" ""Do half of the problem set"". I usually set these goals to be smaller than what I know I can achieve as when I finish them easily, it helps me feel like I have control/was productive and can get through more. Writing the plan/goal out in your planner helps since crossing them off bit by bit is satisfying and shows you that you are actually getting things done (some of my friends use apps). 

When I notice myself reading the same sentence over and over and not focusing, I give myself a 5-20 minute break depending on the severity of motivation loss. During this time I go fill up a water bottle/get a snack or talk with a friend if studying in a group. Or, if you have been studying one subject and find yourself not focusing as well, switch up what you are doing and study a different subject. 

Meditation also helps some of my friends. 5 minutes of purposely not thinking about anything can do wonders. 

Change of scenery may also help. 

Including a variety of study methods could also be beneficial. I personally don't enjoy staring at lectures on my computer for 6 hours straight. You can print off problem sets, make your own study sheets, draw out complicated processes on a white board, try teaching your friends the subject, etc. Studying either quietly or interactively with friends could also help. We help keep each other in check. They can also help monitor your breaks. We will tell each other, ""In 5 minutes make sure I'm back to studying"".

Some days you will just feel off, and that is okay. Taking a day or two off and having 5 or 6 productive study days >>> 7 distracted days of studying.   

Good luck! You can do it!"
