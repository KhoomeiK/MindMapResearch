Lore_Olympus,fd81vl2,t1_fd6kod8,1578212916.0,"I was talking about this with a friend; she hasn‚Äôt read it but it‚Äôs fully invested thanks to me, 

I told her how Rachel is extremely good at portraying emotions, I have like a tic every time I‚Äôm anxious or uncomfortable which is fidgeting my fingers or scratching very very hard on the same place; and the moment Artemis said -My brother is here- I started to fidget my fingers without realizing it

I was starting to feel anxious just reading this; and I‚Äôm getting frustrated at Artemis; because she‚Äôs forcing Persephone to have a ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù with her brother, I feel like if she finds out what happened she‚Äôll blame Persephone 

I just hope she hits the floor twice, not even for Hades to save her; just for her to have the emotional support and teach Apollo a fucking lesson"
AmItheAsshole,fd7zuho,t1_fd5re1e,1578212340.0,"Exactly, my husband is the same he likes dark long hair, I like it light short hair. I ask his opinion on how he thinks a certain hairstyle would look on me and he gives me his advice; but he has NEVER EVER told me not to do something I want, he even gets excited to see the final result

So please OP, don‚Äôt let him manipulate you into doing something you don‚Äôt want it‚Äôs ok for him to have a type, it‚Äôs another completely different thing for him to demand you not to do WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH YOUR HAIR."

I‚Äôm so sorry you have to deal with someone so immature, Hopefully your SO realizes quickly that that type of behavior isn‚Äôt normal.

Sending you a hug and good luck"
AmItheAsshole,fcmtyy7,t3_ehw713,1577792153.0,"NTA; this is one of the reasons I don‚Äôt want kids, I know the moment I have a daughter my husband will love her more than me, as it should be. 

You should talk to her calmly; this is a sign that something deeper is going on, maybe she is going through something and this is her way of diverting or dealing with it.

Hope everything works out"
JUSTNOMIL,fcjcqo9,t1_fciuglj,1577683194.0,"Hopefully everything works great for you; there‚Äôs nothing more frustrating than people getting angry at you for setting limits

JUSTNOMIL,fcd7d21,t3_egysy4,1577607268.0,"Nope not normal; yet really common.

I remember when my husband and I (we were engaged when this took place) moved in together,  his aunt came to visit because she lived super close and I always had a good relationship with her.

My husband was at work and I was on vacation cleaning and finishing setting everything up; she shows up and I was showing her the paint colors that we were going to use and suddenly she enters our room and starts checking all the boxes and our closet, just moving things and touching everything.

I was livid; because I was comparing her to my mom, she (my mom) had dropped by earlier that day and she sat at the living room and waited for me to give her a tour and even then she didn‚Äôt enter the rooms she just looked at them from the outside; so when his aunt went in and touched my STUFF I was angry.

She left and as soon as my husband returned from work I told him everything and he was equally confused and he talked to her explaining that wasn‚Äôt ok because those are our personal things; from there on every time she wanted to visit
She had to call before or I wouldn‚Äôt let her inside my house; she didn‚Äôt like it so she started to tell everyone what an ungrateful girl I was and how rude I acted towards her. 

That was 3 years ago and she still hates me; but I don‚Äôt care I set my boundaries since day one and if she doesn‚Äôt like it she can go and bother my BIL‚Äôs girlfriend"

At first I didn‚Äôt liked her because I thought she was too noisy; but then the more I watched her I realized that she was really good and super down to earth and I‚Äôve been a Stan since"
StephanieSooStories,fbs5ep3,t1_fbnekli,1577050503.0,"I feel the same; I know that maybe sometimes when it‚Äôs a really ‚Äúsilly‚Äù fight between two friends just being stubborn, the best policy is just to let them work things out; but not in this situation.

I‚Äôve seen friends cornered into something they are obviously not comfortable with and I ALWAYS step in, because I‚Äôve been on the other side and you feel your voice cracking, the tears about to fall, the hands shaking and even when you want to say something you can‚Äôt and every time I‚Äôve had friends stick out for me to other friends.

People need to understand that, if he took that approach it‚Äôs ok it‚Äôs his decision, but he shouldn‚Äôt refer to Stephanie as his friend because he obviously doesn‚Äôt think that way if he left someone made her feel that uncomfortable.

That‚Äôs my opinion, not against him not saying anything more against him saying my friends when in reality you could say it‚Äôs more like my acquaintances"
