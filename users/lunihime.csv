bulletjournal,fcki5xl,t3_ehkstk,1577725863.0,"Oh I had to comment because this MUJI planner changed my bujo-ing game.

If you guys suffer from bujo burnout, have no fear. I've been so tired from coming up with new themes and making 8-10 pages of the same weekly spread. I saw this one and bought it when I went to NY in November and let me tell you.... I'm finding my creative self again! It saves me so much time and the page grid on the weekly layouts allow me to do all the creative stuff on it. <3 

I love what you did with the washi tapes here! I'm going to try that on mine!"
bulletjournal,fckhaiz,t3_ehn40u,1577725314.0,Nothing warms me up like a good winnie the pooh quote. also i LOVE what you did with the washi tape for the corner designs!!!
