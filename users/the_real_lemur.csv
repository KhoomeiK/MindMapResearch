Both nation's exist on land that is strategically very important for a potential war against America's enemies. Pakistan is also one of the only connections controlled by the US that can ferry supplies and troops into Afghanistan. 

Additionally, Pakistan buys our weapons and airframes. India instead chooses an eclectic mix of whatever they found at the yard sale that year."

There was a woman in that documentary that worked at a factory coating pans with Teflon. 

She got pregnant, her supervisors at DOW chemical told her it was all fine to handle. She delivered a baby several pounds underweight that ultimately led to her child having a catastrophic level facial reconstruction done through hundreds of procedures through his life. The kid (now adult) speaks at length about it in the the documentary. 


The shit those factory's have done to local water sources in West Virginia are truly awful. Heads of cattle, groups of deer, even birds all lay dead around the banks of rivers and creeks around the factories and it was all brushed aside. 

But the alternatives are just as terrifying. The new BPA alternatives and reinvented teflon's are simply just untested variants of the things we know are deadly. It takes decades to find out the shit we now know about Teflon, and it will take decades to learn about all the new coatings and sprays we use on everything today.

It's not like anti vax. Those are crazy people that think the government is trying to kill kids. 
This stuff is fact, and proof that corporations couldn't give a shit less if they kill your kids so long as they make a buck. 

Sure, America was fine with that when it was Indian kids having their lungs melted out by Union Carbide or when Malaysian kids stitched a finger or two into a new batch of Nike shoes. But this is poised to harm everyone, everywhere from all walks of life."
