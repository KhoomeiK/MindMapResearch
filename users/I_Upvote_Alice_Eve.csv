Trent Williams went to the team doctor about a bump on his head, and the team doctor said it looked like nothing, but he should go see a specialist if he was concerned. They even made him an appointment, but he didn't go. He just let it sit there for six years. That is on him. Nobody told him he couldn't get it checked out; if fact it was exactly the opposite. Try reading credible sources before you tell lies."
