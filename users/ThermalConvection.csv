Also, people protest the use of the bombs claiming they're inhumane, which is true, but:

a) the Japanese had already commit various travesties of their own which did not really further their military campaigns (Rape of Nanking, for example), so Japan waving the victim card is a bit of a moot point

b) the damage caused by the nuclear bombs is actually less than the total damage from the firebombing campaign

c) with the information we have *now* it may be true that Japan would have inevitably surrendered, but at the time it was thought Japan would never surrender until it was either invaded or coerced by sustained blockade and air assault

In either case, the outlook on the surviving population is not good. The only way to force a surrender at this point is a supreme show of force - precisely what the bombs achieve. Military History Visualized covers this is one of his videos."
