The number of times you push/pull at one time without the 90 second rest are called repetitions (or 'reps' for short). Each time you perform the 9-12 push or pulls and then rest is called a 'set'. I hope this helps!"

From the top of a hill comes a pit bull leashed to a 12 year old boy who is ON ROLLERBLADES who is understandably unable to control the dog. The dog yanked so hard to get to us that the boy wiped out on the path but kept hold of the leash. We couldn’t believe our eyes. I don’t know what the hell kind of experiment this was. 

Btw, where I live pit bulls are a banned breed (since 2005) to lend some insight into the overall responsibility of whomever the owners are."

They lost all their ‘respect’ for him and were genuinely angry and strangely frustrated. Men are shallow and have flimsy senses of self.

Eta: did a search and she’s actually 10 yrs younger than him but because she looks like an actual 46 year old woman these men were saying he’s dating his grandmother. Like wtf? I wonder how young some of these men who imagine who they’d date in Keanu’s shoes would go. Sick."
