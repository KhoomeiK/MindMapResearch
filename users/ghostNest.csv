Confidence. The people who do that look confident because they're in their comfort zones, and that's not a bad thing. The same doctor with his stethoscope would be just as confident without it. 

They don't need these things to be confident, the same way you don't either. You need to raise your chin, straighten your back, lower your shoulders, breathe even, look where you're going, and be assertive. Fake it 'till you make it."

AskTeenGirls,feshaov,t3_eqha0k,1579365101.0,"It's less about the literal act of touching lips and feeling the connection, physically telling them how much you love them and feeling how much they love you.

It can be warm like a blanket, a gentle descent into a hot tub, and vulnerable, holding eachother close, a hand on a cheek, hip, or butt. 

It can also be magnetic, a lawful push of lips, melting, fusing, and possessive, dragging hands up shirts or legs wrapped around a waist.

They can be quick, reassuring and endearing, a burst of energy through your chest, a buzzing love in your heart. A shared smile, a giggle, and departure with renewed determination."

homestuck,fesfzpk,t1_fert1hc,1579364789.0,"Haha, he's already getting coffee from Dave.
 Possible explinations are:

A. He'll add milk to his coffee himself

B. He's getting it for other people

C. He's getting it for everyone, himself included

D. It was the first thing the thought of and doesn't tell us if he drinks milk. 

E. He's drinking the coffee and milk seperately.


Considering Roxy laughed and told him where, we can eliminate D. 

Dave also already made the pot and poured it into a cup by the time this has happened. He only had one cup and he's holding it, but there's a pot of coffee for the others left over.  

It's then that Karkat asks for milk. So we can eliminate E. 

Karkat, as angry as he is all the time, doesn't seem like the type to just grab milk for himself, and that leaves B and C. 

The way he asks if there is milk is obviously changing the subject, but it's still changing to the topic of coffee, which is relevant. 

Dave walked off with his coffee without putting things in it, so he either doesn't take milk or captchalogues it for later. 

Roxy says yes to coffee, so he could've getting milk for him. But if it was just for Karkat, I have a feeling Roxy would tell him it's cool and grab it himself. 

Therefore, all evidence points to Karkat preferring milk on his coffee. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk."
