MurderedByWords,fe3n7f8,t1_fcsqt7h,1578850871.0,"Just recently, a dude in Texas stopped a mass shooting by shooting the shooter before any lives were taken. I'd argue that the shooter is better off dead anyways and there's no denying the fact that the presence of an armed civilian saved many lives that day."
MurderedByWords,fe3l8ot,t1_fcsonk2,1578850279.0,"a.If you were going to kill yourself would  you rather go through the pain of hanging yourself or something or just end it with a gunshot to the head? It's not like the US has a higher suicide rate than other countries, it's just that of the suicides that do take place, a lot of them are with a gun.

b.If law enforcement has to shoot and kill someone and it is justified by law, the criminal would've likely been a threat to another person, and in that case I think we'd all rather have them dead than the people the criminal could've killed.

So we 80% of it is saving other people's lives and by killing criminals and easier suicides. I find it hard to see a problem with either of those."
MurderedByWords,fe3jga8,t1_fe2m3h2,1578849776.0,I guess? I know that in some martial arts the weaker people tend to have better technique but I'm not sure if the same would apply to this.
MurderedByWords,fdzbcfd,t1_fdyn5td,1578788484.0,Exactly! If anything having to make up for having less strength would mean that they have better technique.
MurderedByWords,fdzaon9,t3_ena2tr,1578788252.0,"(As someone who knows basically nothing about the topic at hand) I have a theory, and I want to know if anyone can confirm:

If you trained x numbers men to fight with swords and x number of women to fight with swords, the women would end up having better technique than the men if both groups were trained under the exact same conditions because, given that the average strength of all the men would likely be higher than the average strength of all the women, the men would be more reliant on their strength whereas weaker people in general would have to figure out the best technique to use.

Pretty unrelated to the post but it popped into my head so can anyone confirm?"

Now I was with you for the bulk of it, but your reasoning that pulling her tuition and preventing her from going to college would result in her changing her beliefs is where I came to my conclusion. While her beliefs are certainly something that should raise major concerns, I don't think doing something that could end up drowning her in student loan debt or make it so that her time and effort at uni was a waste. Also, if this is a teen rebellion thing, doing this could very well motivate her to distance herself more from you and, as a result, grow closer to the mentioned group (which would likely be pretty easy considering how tightly knit such religious groups become)."

This may just be because I'm a gen Zer, but I find that I always forget where the buttons for shit are whereas I can navigate the UI of a touchscreen. It's not for everyone, of course, but I feel like the phasing out of buttons has made it so that most people will be able to use controls that are almost exclusively touchscreen with relative ease."
