unpopularopinion,ff1gbru,t1_ff1a01l,1579478778.0,"I mean if you think about it, kids are a *lot* more exposed to the world now than they were then. Given most kids already know how to use a tablet or phone before they even reach kindergarten and kids as young as 8 years old are already on social media. Back then, I’d honestly say more kids were sheltered to what was going on in the world compared to the kids now. And I guess that could arguably be a reason why more kids are depressed and desensitized now as well. They are just exposed to so much at such a young and early age."
badwomensanatomy,ff0acyr,t1_fexbj5k,1579466885.0,"I don’t think anyone ever claimed vaginas can’t become looser lmfao. Actually, I think many people explained that’s the case when a woman becomes aroused. The vagina will relax to accommodate to a penis, and since different penises have different sizes, it’s possible she will feel somewhat different to a guy smaller than them for a certain amount of time. But the argument isn’t that women can’t be “looser”,  it’s that it’s not a permanent change, as others mentioned and how you mentioned. Not to mention the misconceptions and slut shaming that comes behind this as well. We’re arguing that a woman isn’t going to be “looser” for being sexually active. 

Our vaginas are muscles. They are designed to withstand lots of stretching because of birth (I’m sure you know that)."

unpopularopinion,fet1x3w,t1_feshivi,1579371043.0,"That’s what therapy is for, though? Helping someone learn to cope with their emotions and situations they’re in. It helps people get through their struggles and emotions and helps them deal with it in a healthier way. Yes, a 14 year old is not a baby but they certainly aren’t grown ups either. They’re not going to be able to learn how to cope with things on their own. Our brains are still developing at that stage and aren’t fully matured until 25. The part that deals with emotions, decision making, personality, behavior, etc, is the last to develop."
unpopularopinion,fesyuka,t3_eqh2c2,1579370273.0,"It’s easier for parents to ignore it rather than des with it , it seems. They’ll tell you that you don’t understand what it means to be “tired” or “sad” or even depressed. It’s very saddening honestly. We’re humans, and our feelings and emotions aren’t black and white. The human brain is very complex and it doesn’t have age requirement for feeling a certain way. Even if they didn’t believe you couldn’t be depressed, they could at least sit their child down and try and understand *why* they feel this way. Instead it’s just easier for them to tell them to “suck it up” and “wait til you get out into the real world”."
