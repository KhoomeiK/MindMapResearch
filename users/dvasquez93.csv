TeamSolomid,ff8rj32,t1_ff8r5ly,1579693205.0,"Because we understand that when you willingly sign a 2 year contract, and then further agree to stay on in the second year, you can’t change your mind about it after having played through the whole contract, whine about it in public, and try to smear your old team.  Especially when that team would have another championship under it’s belt had he not made the single dumbest mistake in NA Finals history.

Face facts: Zven’s acting like a spoiled child.  All he had to do was just shut up, look forward, and focus on playing well in the future and he’d have very little ill-will even among TSM fans.  After all, everyone has rough patches and sometimes the fit just isn’t there.  But going on camera and dishonestly smearing your old team will destroy any goodwill that was left."

You'd have to play around a bit, but I could see them rewriting the tenets as:

Douse the Flame of Evil. It is not enough to merely defeat an enemy in battle. You must ensure that evil never again has the opportunity to threaten the lives of innocents.  A blade can win a battle, but only extermination can end evil for go

Rule with an Iron Fist. Willful disobedience is the root of sin.  Tolerate no dissent.  Expect purity and obedience from those who follow you, and demand it from yourself.

Strength Above All. Only through strength can you resist evil.  Thus, only the strong are fit to rule, for only they can withstand the corruption of leadership.

With that, you also have a built in channel for inner conflict as their tenets and their zeal drive them to more and more extreme measures until someone can prove to them that they've taken actions that are undeniably evil, and they have a crisis dealing with their devotion to good versus their devotion to order."

zyramains,ff7odpn,t1_ff7nci7,1579654405.0,"No problem.  Yeah you just gotta run through games and try and learn or practice what you can.  Even in 4v5's, there's still mechanical practice to be gained and you can learn a lot about how to play defensively when offense isn't an option.  I like to treat 4v5's as practice for how to repel enemy pushes when one of your teammates gets picked.  Yeah over the course of a game it's just a matter of time, but that doesn't mean you can't learn anything.

Always remember: if you didn't learn anything from a game, you wasted your time.  But the converse is also true, if you learned something from the game, it wasn't a complete waste of time.  So even if you know you're gonna be surrendering at 15, make sure that during those 15 minutes you're as focused as you can be.  

If you want any advice or tips about Zyra, feel free to ask or pm me, I'll answer as best I can as soon as I can."
zyramains,ff7mbxl,t3_es3bjn,1579652974.0,"She's a champ that has good carry potential, but truth be told you aren't going to solocarry yourself up into another league.  League is fundamentally a team game, so unless you're a gold-level player playing in bronze, it's unlikely that you're going to be able to solocarry a solid chunk of your games.

And there's nothing wrong with that.  League is a game to learn, not a game to win.  Truth be told, League does a good job of placing people where they need to be for their current skill level, and I say that as someone who not only thought they should be higher than what they were, but was told so by multiple people.  

A couple seasons ago, I ran some practice with a plat-level college team my friend was on.  For a couple months I played with them, about 5 games a week against other plat ranked teams and higher.  And even though I was silver, I was more than holding my own on the team, and the players and coaches all said I should have been Gold ranked at the very least, instead of climbing slowly in Silver with a winrate just above 50%.  My warding was great, my mechanics were solid, and my laning was great.

And I bought into that for a while, but nothing clicked until I physically took a step back and watched how the other people on the team played in soloqueue.  I watched how they moved around the map, how they impacted other lanes, and what plays they looked to make.  And when I learned to see the game on that level, I went from Silver 3 53% winrate to Gold 2 with a 60% winrate in less than a season, and I probably would have gotten higher if I hadn't taken a 4 month break from league midseason.  

My mechanics didn't change.  I wasn't warding better.  My laning didn't get better.  Hell, if anything my individual carry ability got worse considering how much time off I took.  But because I was able to fill in the gaps in my play, namely game knowledge and rotations, I made massive improvements.  

So in short, Zyra is a great champ, and if she fits for you then go for it.  But don't expect a champion change to fix your game.  Instead, watch better players (not pros, but people who are where you want to be) and try to actively identify weaknesses in your own game to fix.  That's when you'll make your improvements.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk."

The Party finds, through their own scouting, that it would be deadly to try and extract the target through brute force, and the target knows they're coming.  In addition, the safehouse is located in a busy neighborhood so even if they could brute force it, they're looking at numerous casualties including innocent civilians.

Meanwhile the Pelicans have built a team around an unknown quantity that doesn't work without it, and even if Zion fulfills his expectations the ceiling for the Pels this year was still not realistically all the high with him.

They were all-universe when it came to pass rush and stopping the run, so it set the tone that this defense should be blanketing and shutting out offenses.  Which it did at times.  But not nearly like it should have been.  Had the secondary been on the same level of the front 7, it would make our current defense look like a joke.

Instead, basically every big play or miscue was allowed by the secondary.  It just kinda takes the wind out of you when the front 7 stops a team stone cold for 2 plays and then the secondary allows a first down and some extra."

If he QSS’s the slow and then E->Flash’s out, he doesn’t get ulted by Skarner and Double wouldn’t have Kaisa ulted in without backup.  Instead, he held QSS until after he got surrounded and by then it’s too late to flash."
TeamSolomid,fcurwoe,t1_fcuggvr,1577987257.0,"That’s not fair.  He was a solid adc for much of his time.  He would be doing what he needs to do for 90% of the time, but the 10% where we really needed him to step up he would collapse, which is arguably worse. 

He was good enough to make a few All-LCS teams, which unfortunately got him a lot more chances than it should have."
KurokosBasketball,fcurl6s,t1_fcuo8q6,1577987069.0,"In his game against Yosen, he singlehandedly shut down the entire team when he entered the zone.  By the end of the game, he was very clearly the best player on the court.  

Against Aomine in his second matchup, he went blow for blow with him the entire game and outlasted him in the zone.  Yeah he wasn’t head and shoulders above him that game, but you can’t say that Aomine was in a class above him."
TeamSolomid,fctbh0v,t1_fct8a6r,1577938106.0,"Eh, it’s a play that threw away a championship in which one person committed a truly mindboggling number of errors.  It deserves it.  

He was:

Ahead by a large amount

On his favorite champion

That happens to be the most safe adc in the game

Against a melee champion with no gap closer

With vision on the rest of TL

And yet he:

Randomly engaged despite there being nothing to gain

Used his E late

Didn’t flash

Wasn’t kiting, instead just stood still til Skarner walked up

Not QSSing early

That’s a next level cockup.

Edit: he did have QSS, he just waited til he was surrounded to use it."
KurokosBasketball,fct4c6c,t1_fct1cxp,1577932544.0,"We’ve already seen him match Aomine at his best, and Murasakibara doesn’t ever bring out his best so it’s kind of a moot point.

When Kagami is in the zone, he’s been shown to go toe to toe with any of the GoM, so even if there is a difference in level, it’s relatively small on the grand scale."

Hell, Kagami is one of the strongest players in the series and after Last Game its said he *might* have NBA potential."

And just because you dismiss a source doesn’t make it false, especially when it presents valid evidence that you can actually review and check.

Here is a breakdown of the allegations and evidence by the Journal of Political Risk: https://www.jpolrisk.com/what-is-the-evidence-of-forced-organ-harvesting-in-china/

Another source we have is the China Tribunal, an independent organization headed by an experienced human rights prosecutor, who concluded that based on available evidence that it is beyond reasonable doubt that the PRC has been practicing forced organ removal on prisoners of conscience on a large scale (https://chinatribunal.com/final-judgement-report/).  

Additionally, even Chinese sources indicate that there has been a strong surge in organ transplant available that is strongly correlated with the incarceration rates of persecuted minority groups."
CrewsCrew,fcjsz4e,t1_fcjsk5p,1577703146.0,">Not true. In fact you also put a tonne of them in Guantanamo and tortured them but that's being propagandised by some American outlets too so I've avoided that one.

That was well over a year ago, and that took place in a Taliban camp.  We’re not rounding up non-combatant Uyghurs with no connection to an active war.  

And we put 22 of them in Guantanamo and since 2013 all of them were either released or transferred to other countries for asylum.

>	No I didn’t. You’ll need to quote where I said that. What I’ve asserted is that there’s no evidence that this is genocide or any sort of mass psychopathic murdering of 10million people, as is frequently stated by others in this thread and as is the proportional reaction of american redditors constantly on this topic.

So what would you call the systematic internment of hundreds of thousands of ethnic minorities for the purposes of torture, organ harvesting, and murder?  Cause they have evidence of that, and where I come from we call that genocide."
CrewsCrew,fcjsf49,t1_fcjrm56,1577702332.0,"1) You brushed the accusations off as random abuses in an otherwise peaceful system, which is a vast understatement. 

2) you labeled the people sent there as radicalized individuals of a population were being bombed by the US, which is false.  We’re not bombing Uygurs.  Just because they are also muslim doesn’t mean that they’re the same people. 

3) you continue to assert that there is no evidence of human rights abuses despite numerous countries, populations, and independent organizations finding evidence of repeated violations.  As I stated before, there have been repeated discrepancies in the numbers reported for Chinese organ donations that strongly indicate the harvesting of organs from Uyghurs and other minority groups.  In addition, the Chinese government has been shown to have been lying about the sourcing of their organ transplants for years, and there has been no evidence of change on their part. There have even been instances where government and hospital officials have been admitted that they were harvesting organs from minority groups when investigators posed as potential buyers. 

And yet you call me deranged, while you yourself choose to cling to the word of the PRC while ignoring all signs that they are lying."
CrewsCrew,fcjrdvt,t1_fcjr71q,1577700814.0,"So you’re giving China 100% of the benefit of the doubt by claiming that those camps are simply peaceful re-education camps despite the fact that several human rights organizations and investigative councils have declared them torture and genocide camps, but on the other hand you’re saying that the US relocation camps, which have been operating on a level of transparency that is much higher than anything China has put together, are just rape and murderfests?  Are you being paid to say these things, or is there some other reason for the massive waiver you’re giving China?"
CrewsCrew,fcjqyby,t1_fcjqgq4,1577700178.0,"There have been several independent investigations into suspected Chinese human rights abuses , and they almost unanimously point to the same conclusions: that persecution of ethnic minorities is alive and well in China and that there is a distinct discrepancy between the number of fresh organs legally available for sale in China and the number of registered donors.
