loseit,ff7wup6,t3_es1a3x,1579660256.0,"I got some distressing news today at the eye doctor. Went for the first time in 4 years, and he found a micro aneurysm in the left eye. It's a sign of diabetes damage but, as far as I know, I don't have diabetes. I did have gestational diabetes twice and hadn't been back to the eye doctor since my last pregnancy. Ugh. I hope this is just a result from that last crazy pregnancy, but did I really damage my eyes in just 9 months? I will make an appointment with my OB tomorrow for blood work. Fingers crossed.

As for everything else, man, the scale is weird! Technically I dropped 2 lbs overnight. Realistically, it's all just water slushing around willy nilly.  Still, it would be lovely to reach my month-end goal a week early, pre Fogo noms.

The point of most weight loss subs isn't just to lose weight - it's to get yourself to good health and to sustain it for life.

You do you, but realistically, the difference between eating 1200 and 900 a day will have a minor delay on one reaching their goals (a few weeks later? A month), while it will feel very different. Most people will dearly miss those extra few hundred calories. 

TL;dr: by cutting too low on your daily calories, you might reach your goal in 5 instead of 6 months, but those 5 months will feel like 2 years."

askwomenadvice,ff11nbg,t1_ff0waej,1579474372.0,"You definitely don't need to be a different person! Think of it as trying new things and approaching stuff in a new way.

Give mascara a shot. If you hate it, forget it! But hey - maybe you'll like the look? A little bit of mousse on wet hair then blow dry it straight- see if it jives. Have a pedicure (if you run, the pedicure will feel freaking awesome). Instead of stilettos, go for wedge shoes or nice sandals. Experiment with different clothes. Instead of trying to be someone else, try to find a more elaborate version of who you are."
askwomenadvice,feyoaig,t3_eqwfsh,1579448188.0,"I am assuming you are a heterosexual girl, so I am going to give you some girly advice, from one female late bloomer to another.

1.  Be open and inviting. 

You mention that you come off more uninterested - that might be a bigger turn off  than desperate to guys because, well, they are basically like us, but with penises. They don't necessarily want to have someone clinging to them, but when approaching a girl, or even dating or calling, they want to know that girl is receptive. So, smile more (I know, I know! I cringed when I typed that). Be the first to text sometimes. Engage in light physical touch. Suggest fun things to do together in the future (did you see the trailer for xxxx? We should see it together when it comes out!)


2.  Be positive.

This may or may not be you, but whenever people say they have problems maintaining relationships, I always ask them to take a good hard look at how they interact. When people ask you how you are doing, is it a loaded question? When you convey something bad, do you end it on a high note? (E.g. ""I'm exhausted, working on this really difficult project at work, but when I finish it, I am going to take a nice, well-earned vacation."" Instead of ""I am so exhausted, work is killing me."") Life is hard sometimes, but that's true for everyone. It can be overwhelming for some to be around others who are always down. On the other hand, a positive attitude can make someone feeling down feel better.


3. Be interesting and entertaining. 

I think you got this, based on your friends calling you the funny one, but just in case. You want to be able to start and continue a conversation. If the answer to ""what are you up to?"" Is ""nothing. Bored."" That tells the listener that you are expecting others to entertain you, which gets old. Be well informed about current events, even current movies, to start or continue conversations. Continue being funny! People want to be around those with whom they have a good time.


4. Match your appearance to your intent.

Again, I cringe to bring this up, but, make sure you look like you are a single woman interested in dating. I was in college when I discovered skirts and makeup and it really made all the difference because it signaled that I was interested in receiving attention. Get your nails done. Use hair products and style your hair. Before you go out, spend a half hour on making yourself look a bit more single and out there. Wear heels. Seriously. I spent 6 months in skirts and heels exclusively and it was a complete game changer.



5. You are not ugly.

Or rather you might be- I don't know what you look like. But I know, just by looking outside, that being not hot doesn't prevent people from dating, finding love and affection, or raising families. There is nothing inherently wrong with you, OP. And as my husband always says, when it comes to love and dating, you only have to get it right once. Happy hunting!"
AmItheAsshole,feygskg,t1_fey8q62,1579445328.0,I don't think anyone is arguing that OP must reconcile with his sibling. The debate here is whether the golden child is an AH for enjoying that parental relationship while the black sheep suffers.

relationships,fer2i79,t3_eqet4q,1579348884.0,"This is one of those situations where how you handle things will say more about you and your character.

First, why are you so focused on feeling cheated? Maybe she used you. Or maybe she honestly was trying it give it another go but it just didn't work out. Maybe shortly after you two agreed to try again she realized she was sure it was over. You mention this was ""our"" dog, so were you really babysitting your own dog?  Would it have really been better to break up with you while she was traveling?

Second, by being vengeful, what do you really get? You want to make her feel justified in quietly moving her stuff and sorry she didn't move more away while you were out? You want your mutual friends and her family (and possibly yours) to think you're a jerk? Why are you so hellbent on proving her right that breaking up with you was the right thing? 

TL;dr: Break ups are hard, but how you choose to conduct yourself will reflect on you much more than on your ex.

EDIT:  I have a few questions:

1. Was there a reason she tried to break up with you the first time?

2. Had she broken up with you the first time, how would you have celebrated the holidays? Do you have good relations with your family?

3. Her parents own the apartment you live in. Would it have been legal for them/her to have refused to resign your lease instead of her just moving out?

4. In the event you start playing stupid games, can get parents refuse to resign your lease/have you kicked out?

5. Her name is on the lease of your apartment. Doesn't that mean she can enter legally and take her computer?"

It's the difference between ""sorry, I'm bipolar,"" and ""I am sorry. I has complications from my bipolar disorder, but I recognize what I did was wrong and will do my best to make sure it doesn't happen again.""

Truth is, everybody has an excuse. Poverty, neglectful parents, addiction, mental health, etc. Few people are just mean because it's fun. Recognizing mental health is actively trying to be more empathetic and more understanding.
