I think Biden summed up his candidacy and hypothetical presidential term when he told all his rich donors nothing would change for them.  He needs to gtfo with that crap.  Shit needs to change.  Change hurts, and can be scary, but much less so than this billionaires paradise/capitalist dystopia we live in.

They have had the wool pulled over their eyes and then stapled to their face.  There are things I disagree with Senator Sanders on, but we absolutely have to get an honest man in the White House and support him to fix things.  What is the point of voting for someone you agree with if they are just saying those things to get your vote?  But yes, I absolutely agree with you! **US!**"
SandersForPresident,fc62mm3,t1_fc5ganb,1577470871.0,"I feel like we have a real shot of capitalizing on the negativity that Trump has sewn.

At this point it isn’t about dem or republican, it is about a leader who actually has humanity and compassion.  Not an endless hunger for money and power at the expense of humanity."

BeginnerWoodWorking,fc5wa59,t3_efbyjm,1577467245.0,"So, a lot of people disagree with me, but I cut my routing teeth with a smaller Palm router.  They are easy to handle, usually cheaper, and personally, I found them less intimidating. 

As far as a table saws, man, that’s a tough one.  Job site table saws are generally smaller and cheaper, but I hated using one.  Trying to learn on one can be a pain just because they are so small you generally spend all your time trying to figure out how to make the cuts lol.  Cabinet style ones are great but expensive."
BeginnerWoodWorking,fc5vc6v,t3_efdu5g,1577466691.0,"I would recommend building some furniture like picnic tables that don’t require a lot of fine finishing work if that makes sense. 

Building a few things with what you have here is a great way to build your skill set.  Every time you add a tool try to build something that uses that tool and whatever technique it requires.  One day you will realize that your skills grew with your tools and it’s a good feeling to have mastered them.

The other end of the spectrum is people spending 4K on a table saw they don’t know how to use because they didn’t develop their basics.

This is just one mans opinion but I hope that your future woodworking endeavors are safe, productive, and most importantly, fulfilling!"
