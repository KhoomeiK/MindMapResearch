dnscrypt,fc33s3t,t1_fbyphjs,1577380759.0,"Sorry for reviving a dead thread but how do you verify that IP Blocking is working? I tried pinging and doing trace routes on a few of the IPs in the level 2 list after copying and pasting them into ""ip-blacklist.txt"", assuming that I wouldn't get a result but it pings and connects successfully every time.

Are these the wrong tests to use for verifying that IP blocking in dnscrypt-proxy is working correctly?"
dnscrypt,fbx1seq,t1_fbv7bds,1577166033.0,Do you just copy and paste these IPs into ip-blacklist.txt?
