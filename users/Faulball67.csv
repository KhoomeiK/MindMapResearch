AskReddit,ff20zgg,t3_eqzdrn,1579490895.0,My son is 14. He had a problem with his phone. Hands it to me. Clicked chrome while scrolling through. 5-6 pornhub pages up. Told him to learn to open up porn in incognito mode so you can close all the pages with one tap. Fixed phone. Went back to the living room. Pretty sure he avoided eye contact the rest of the day.
AskReddit,fecq3s0,t1_feclals,1578980537.0,"Mothers side is catholic.  No contraceptives were allowed.  Exactly why she's 1 of 6 kids. Im not sure of the current catholic rules, but from a quick glance it appears the catholic church has remained against all forms of modern contraceptive other than ""natural family planning"" or basically knowing from a womans menstrual cycle when she is fertile and avoiding sex during times of fertility.  

Side note, when i was younger we were taught muslims were not allowed to use latex condoms or pills but sheep skin was okay? Fucking 80s America was so uninformed."

People willing to leave their country, family, and everything they've ever known to join your country and be a part of your culture are typically way more proud of becoming an American than people who were born here by sheer luck. People born here tend to bitch about everything and anything while having 100x more than the people who struggle to come here and work their ass off for a better life. They tend to love this country for what they've been able to achieve that they could have never done at home. The poor and rich alike here have no clue how good they truly have it. People here haven't grown up with homes with dirt floors for a couple generations."

Didn't grow up poor per say, but my dad did and when i was young we didn't have much but i never went hungry.

dataisbeautiful,fcd1yjq,t1_fccoqy0,1577605357.0," You've clearly read half of what was written and do not have a full grasp of the topic. I'm clearly talking to the 79 percent or 79 cents on the dollar is the UNADJUSTED wage gap which intentionally fails to incorporate specific metrics that deflate the percentage. The ADJUSTED wage gap which actually takes into account other metrics like actually having the same job and experience, in the US at this time, is generally deemed to be 95 cents on the dollar. Hillary Clinton herself will tell you that. Still a gap but way better than the number. Thats the point I'm making. 

You also are being intentionally ignorant of societal norms and acting like all these women are being physically forced to stay home and be susie homemaker. You know who pushes women the most to stay in service and support roles and to stay home and have kids? Their own mothers. Family pressure to follow in the steps of their moms is one of the most understated cultural influences that plagues women today. You're also intentionally forgetting the large number of women who are single mothers which makes leadership roles much more difficult to sustain and hence further skews that UNADJUSTED number. I watch my boss, a younger than me single mother, ex is a d-bag. She puts in 60+ hours a week. Her mother watches her daughter and picks her up from the bus stop and keeps her until she gets home. She wanted to be a mom but she's WILLING to step away and be my boss and take on all that responsibility and not always be there for her daughter but is still a great mom. She's an awesome boss and wants to keep moving up and she will because work is prioritized. She's lucky to have that support system that many don't have which prevents them from following that path. 

I fully acknowledge that studies show women are called back for interviews at a lower rate than men. https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-03/upf--wa3032519.php
But saying women don't leave because they can't is utter trash. Too many women are simply unwilling to even send out those resumes/CV's in the first place. As the old saying goes you miss all the shots you don't take. I've seen this with women time and time again. Being unwilling to attempt to go elsewhere for more money is not the same thing as being turned down.

As an aside, I know plenty of guys that would gladly step the aside and become johnny homemaker if their wife was WILLING to take on the role of primary provider. I've got friends that do this and friends that don't. Ask the average suburban guy these days if they would be willing to stay home instead of their wives and the number is much higher than you might realize, specifically in later gen-x and millennials. I for one would gladly become a 1950s housewife in my home. I'll even wear an old Lucille Ball kinda dress if i gotta. I just don't care where the money comes from as long as we're financially secure and the cops aren't gonna raid the house at 3am looking for drugs.

 In my household not gonna happen. My wife grew up in the deep south. Its just ingrained into what womanhood is down there. I've never seen her happier then when she was off work for 4 weeks. She went full on leave it to Beaver. Spent her days cooking and cleaning and dealing with kids. She told me repeatedly she wished she could just do that forever. I'm not down with that personally and don't want my daughter to think that's normal so we compromise. I still do the majority of the traditional male roles like fixing things and yard work but I also cook and garden and include my daughter and son in those tasks when possible. Both kids helped me rebuild my old firebird. Both my kids get plumbing lessons and to be honest I'd trust my 11 yo daughter over my 14 yo son. 

Sorry for the length but for all the shit women go through i tire of seeing the shit they put themselves through for no reason. I've work with primarily women for 6 years and I always hear the same stories. I always try to encourage them to take the chance. Its funny because i don't usually have to talk much around women my own age. Its the older gen-x and boomer women that seem the least willing to step outside that comfort zone."

dataisbeautiful,fccfwes,t1_fccbp0m,1577597926.0,"It also doesn't take into account the fact men , generally, take more risks in their careers,  put in greater hours, or are willing to work more dangerous jobs.  I've changed jobs numerous times and informed my current employer before coming on board that I was coming to the company specifically for their stated promote from within attitude and that lack of promotion would have them looking for a replacement. Lady's I have worked with and currently do that have the same attitude and are willing to put money as the priority make just as much as I do with the same level of experience. Many women elect to stay stable and prefer feeling comfortable in their job rather than take the risk.  Many times this is related to home life and raising children etc, but women have to make that decision for themselves. If you prefer having children and raising them it is going to effect your career.  That goes for men or women.  Its going to effect your career. You simply can't devote the same amount of time if you are the primary caretaker."

FanTheories,fc3gxfr,t1_fc3ffjm,1577389551.0,"Die Hard 2 starts my non canon. The first one was great but 2 and beyond are terrible in comparison. We could say john mclain is actually in a coma after traumatic injuries caused by the repeated crush injuries, gun shots, dehydration, overpressure blasts from bombs, and blood loss that he went into hypovolemic shock exacerbating the onset rhabdomyolysis he already was going to experience from his injuries. All of that is compounded by John being the tough guy. He is refused to go to the hospital (left in the limo not an ambulance mind you) and was never properly checked for more serious injuries. He now in the icu with Al watching him on a ventilator and heavily sedated. Everything past the original Die Hard is a coma dream, hence his continued inability to be actually injured no matter what happens, each one more insane than the next (kinda like the homer in a coma theory explaining the ludicrous nature of the Simpsons after the early years)."

Showerthoughts,fc23cag,t1_fc22xgb,1577338737.0,Its all implied as being told off screen. If you don't see it that's fine but the vast majority of the original trilogy does a lot of that implied off screen knowledge.  Just like you don't see them get coordinates for endor and the power facility for the death star's shield. It's quite clear that Luke has a specific landing zone in mind. There's dialog peppered throughout V and VI that like is having other conversations with Obi-wan that we're not privy too. Just because you b didn't hear it spoken doesn't mean it's not there.  Doing so is simply bad movie making.
Showerthoughts,fc22cd3,t1_fc183au,1577337627.0,Totally disagree here. Obi-wan gives him coordinates not just a planet. I can give you an 8 digit grid (military version of Lat/Long) and you're within 10 meters of your spot. We used to walk with a map and compass in the pitch dark and find a post in the woods with this.  Your phone gps can track you within that distance when everything is right.  If you have galactic space flight ability I'd be willing to bet you have the ability to land with browsing distance of Yoda's hut.

TwoXChromosomes,fbzo16c,t3_ef8fzy,1577253477.0,"To me your partner sounds like an ass.  My wife and I went shopping for everyone's gifts TOGETHER. I had her take the day off work when I was off and we went and did everything in one sitting. WE wrapped presents TOGETHER. Im willing to bet his mom used to do the everything just like you and he just expects it cause to him it's the norm. 

2 caveats though: 
Does your family situation, being an orphan, give you anxiety around the holidays? I know it would sure make me feel like shit. My date's of multiple friends deaths, all guys i served with in Afghanistan and ask died in the same month, turns me into a bit of a nightmare to be around. 

Is your husband the primary breadwinner? I am in my home, and being short on cash can wreak havoc on me psychologically.  Its extremely hard to feel like everyone is counting on you and your income to make everything work. Being a guy, its always hard to admit you can't do it alone.  Our culture is fucking terrible in how men are made to feel you have to do it or you're a fucking terrible person. 

I guess I'm just trying to say
1 talk about your concerns. The biggest problem in all relationships is lack of communication. It goes both ways. 
2 just make sure you're not both emotionally fucked up and processing that shit on each other."
