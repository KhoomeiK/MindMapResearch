nashville,ffchysu,t1_ffamv06,1579799856.0,"This. I didn't like the transit plan because of two main reasons. It's prohibitive cost both in dollars and time (twenty years was their estimate; we've all seen how construction in Nashville works and know it would have wound up taking thirty) and lack of efficacy. There were five lines that barely went anywhere useful.

I was a big fan of the expanded bus lines. My biggest complaint there is that they didn't expand them enough. It's kind of ridiculous that in a tourism-geared city that stays open until 3am every day the buses shut down at 11pm."
