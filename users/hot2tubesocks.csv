You should check on her every few minutes but the big thing to worry about is if she seems to actually lose touch with reality, which this doesn’t seem like it is.  

Pregnancy psychosis is something to look up if she seems not to be making sense.

If she is just super sensitive and weepy that’s ok, the hormones she has rushing through her are insane.  Be patient and reassuring.  You will both get through this :)"

My best advice would be to find the people who are willing to teach you, stick by them even if they are grumpy fucks.
