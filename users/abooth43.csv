It may not impair you to the extent of alcohol but that sentence is factually incorrect. Driving while high is driving while impaired.

Almost any smart tv, which is the majority of TVs nowadays, has the ability to download streaming apps from your major content providers. 

The Chromecast doesn't actually offer anything different than your smart tv apps, but it does ""cost"" you the battery life on the device you're casting from.

1) works with Chromecast 

2) can't be accessed directly from a smart TV.

Which is kinda what spurred my mini rant when the commenter said he would need his chromecast. 

I understand we are a bit of a fringe case with the whole Chinese subtitles thing. I've just been very underwhelmed by the chromecast in general recently. Over the years it's lost its capabilities on many websites (ex. Solarmovie), and has fallen behind just your standard TV without plugging in an extra dongle and power cord.

The wife is Chinese, she likes watching stuff with Chinese subtitles (none of the big providers consistently have Chinese subs). None of the sites she can find with Chinese subtitles (paid or unpaid) support Chromecast. 

There's no button in the video player, trying to cast the chrome tab freezes the first frame of the movie/show on the screen and only plays audio. 

I have absolutely no use for my Chromecast. If it's supported, there's an app that will play direct through any smart tv, if there's not an app they don't seem to be supported.

It's about to go in the trash, because I unplugged it for my PS4 a few weeks ago, and we've literally never had a reason to plug it back in. If the wife needs subtitles, we just go sit in front of my computer and watch the movie because **Chromecast doesn't work**.

Edit: removed specifics of the TV because they don't effect my stance that the Chromecast doesn't offer any more than the standard  new TV of the past year or two."

 It blows my mind how much he's grown in the past few years and how...not a kid I am anymore. 

Plus, while he's currently much worse at all the games we play together, he is MUCHHHH better than I was at 12. Him and his friends really impress me and make me feel outdated and old."

Didn't realise we were weird for that at all!"
leagueoflegends,fbxrxgc,t1_fbxpt8p,1577198846.0,"Youre missing the difference between a bug and an unintended interaction or non-interaction. 

A bug would imply that it SUPPOSED to work as its currently implemented, but it's literally broken and not working. Nothing is broken about how the soul is applied to Keld, it just doesn't have a real effect because of the way it effects kled.  It will require a special case to be added for him, not to fix something that's broken. 

The guys aboves point with the examples was that they were all unintended interactions....not consistent with the idea upon mplementing them, at least not to the extremity planned. Another example is when AP galio was oneshotting people. 

It wasn't a ""bug"" but it wasn't intended either. Kleds non- interaction with the souls isn't a bug, but it's not intended either. It all happens within the mechanical framework of the game, as the effects are written. Kleds just a unique case."

 Nice and short so you can cast without worrying about knocking stuff over, plus they come with the little rubber fish that my cats have always loved chasing. 

We've got a cars themed one that's a couple years old, still going strong."
