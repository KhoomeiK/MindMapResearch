People gloss over how hard it is to be parented by someone going through an emotional crisis. My mom was living in emotional chaos, leaving me and my kid sister to parent ourselves and dodge the vitriol my parents spewed at each other. It was like trying to walk on cracking ice. All of a sudden, there was no longer any stability in our lives as both parents had to struggle through learning to live and parent on their own while trying to recover emotionally. Plus, at 17, I was not an adult but I was expected to be self sufficient

Advice,fdtjt1u,t3_en1sdp,1578717784.0,"It sounds like you had some people saying some horrible things about you when you were young. One potential side effect of that kind of abuse is that you learn to talk to yourself the same way your abusers did. It turns into a cycle of self-abuse, and destroys self esteem and affects your ability to form loving relationships. It’s clear from your post that you think of yourself poorly, and I’m wondering how your internal voice treats you.

It’s completely possible to change your inner voice to be more supportive, which can have profoundly positive effects on your self esteem. It takes a lot of conscious effort at first. When you find yourself feeling down or lonely, pay attention to what you tell yourself, then reframe it in language you’d use with a best friend (I.e., someone you don’t want to lie to but whose feelings you’d want to protect). The more you can do this, the more you will value yourself.  I feel like for those of us who had emotionally abusive families, self esteem is like starting afire by rubbing sticks together. You work really hard to get a lick of flame and then you have to protect that flame as hard as you can so it stays lit."

I studied Cognitive Psychology at the LhD level (basically ABD) and ran a series of seminars on how to study and take notes at the college level. Here are some things I think it’s important to know:
1) Taking notes by hand and studying from handwritten notes leads to better information retention that taking typed notes or studying from typed notes. Here are some reasons why and some additional tips to make your note taking more effective. When you hand write notes, you process the information in multiple ways. You hear what the prof is saying, so you have an auditory process, when you physically write the notes, you process the information during the act of forming the letters and words as you write, so there is a muscular process, and handwriting notes requires more visual processing (as opposed to typing, which is more rote and people don’t tend to be as visually engaged in rereading when they type.) general processing of information when you hand write. Most people write more slowly than they type, so you can’t just transcribe what is being said. You need to actually consider what parts of the message are relevant and write it in a way that you will understand later. This makes you engage with the material more actively which leads to better encoding during note taking.

needadvice,fcv6qih,t1_fct5t78,1577995793.0,"There are so many more factors than experience though. Think of the process this way. Every step is just a gateway to the next step and once you pass that gate, the previous step matters a lot less. So, when you respond to an ad, your goal is to have a resume and cover letter good enough to get to the interview. They probably aren’t so concerned with length of experience that they will rule out an entry level candidate based on that alone. So you and Mr. 2 year are on fairly equal footing and you both get calls for an interview. Once you get to that stage, you’re on equal footing again. Interviews are much, much more about being good at interviews than having relevant work experience. At this point, things like poise and confidence and fit matter most. So as long as you have good interview skills, it’s unlikely that 2years of experience are going to give the other guy an edge.

No two jobs are exactly identical, so the hirers always expect to have to train a new hire how to work in the new job in that a new work culture. So, those two years of work experience aren’t likely to be transferable enough to make the other guy better prepared to work in this new job. The only real thing the 2 years gets that guy is tossed into the interview pile quicker. But not so much quicker that a well tailored resume and cover letter can’t also make that cut without experience. So, when it comes to getting the actual job, don’t get demoralized about your lack of work experience. Instead, think of it as a game where you have to learn to play different positions well. Get good at the resume position the np the interview position and you’ll end up with an offer. (And you can tell what your weak spots are by where you flunk out of the process. If you are getting interviews but no offers, your resume is okay, but you need to polish your interview skills. If you’re not getting interviews, your resume isn’t working hard enough for you.)"

Also, remember that all symptoms you experience go through your brain. Your brain makes symptoms appear and disappear on their own.

I never seek out exposure to frogs and shy away from them in pictures or commercials. I hate them so much.

I like looking at the pictures in this sub like I enjoy the stories in /r/nosleep. Invoking the fear is a little thrilling. I also love aquariums and IMAX documentaries. So there is an element to my thalassaphobia I enjoy. I can’t imagine a situation where I’d be okay with going diving or sea kayaking though, so the fear is definitely real."
AmItheAsshole,fcssip3,t3_eij6bq,1577924005.0,"INFO: How old is the puppy? Is it being crate trained? If you don’t clean up after it, does that mean it is left to play in its own excrement until your sister is able to clean it up?"
AmItheAsshole,fcsr6zy,t3_eiawtt,1577923044.0,"NTA! I also stayed home because I have a puppy and didn’t know how he’d react to the fireworks (he was really into the excitement of things and it was cute). Pets are family and I prioritize family over parties every time.

That being said, I can’t recommend getting a thunder shirt highly enough. My previous dog was afraid of loud noises but would relax within seconds when I put his thunder shirt on."
AmItheAsshole,fcspiqb,t3_eihcs9,1577921844.0,"NTA! It’s your money, not his. Even if you got married, inheritances aren’t usually considered shared assets in the eyes of the law. This means you get to spend it on whatever the hell you want. It sounds like he thinks of savings as disposable income for spending, which negates the point of savings.

I am also of the strong opinion that working brings more benefits than just money. If he didn’t work, what would he do with his time? Loaf? I can see wanting to quit a job to dedicate your time to a cause you believe in, but, personally, not wanting to work reasons of personal enrichment is a sign of poor moral character. That’s just my opinion, but if I were in your shoes, I would think less of my boyfriend due to his reaction."

CasualConversation,fcnv5mk,t1_fcnlma9,1577819054.0,"I’m glad you replied because that is so good to hear! Depression is awful and it can take near superhuman effort just to take temps to get treatment, and then you have to wait to see if the treatment works at all. It’s like gotten beaten with a bag of oranges. So, I’m super happy to hear you’re growing better and I hope you realize what an accomplishment it is!"
CasualConversation,fcnnf04,t1_fbwn9bu,1577814796.0,"Hi! Hopefully in the 7 days since you posted this, things have gotten better, but I wanted to share a tip from cognitive psychology that changed my life. When you catch yourself thinking that someone cancelled or forgot a plan because they don’t care about you, try immediately changing the thought to, “Poor Kevin, I know he loves hanging out with me and he’s going to feel so bad when he realizes he forgot our plans (or he must feel so bad that he had to bail on me.)” You can use this tactic (called cognitive reframing) for any number of circumstances. E.g., someone snaps at you, try thinking, “Kevin must be thinking about that fight with their girlfriend instead of how much they appreciative me.”

The idea is basically this: Do you know how Kevin feels about cancelling/forgetting your plans or why he snapped at you? No. There are a billion reasons either could have happened and many of those reasons have nothing to do with you at all. So, the beliefs I suggested are no more valid that what you’re currently choosing to think. However, your current thought patterns lead to nagging and other behaviors you don’t like whereas I bet those will disappear when you start changing your reasoning. It certainly helped me a ton! If you google cognitive restructuring, you can find lots of worksheets and tools to help illustrate these ideas.

Anyway, I hope this is helpful because I know you are flawed or unliked, but I know what it’s like to feel that way. Once I changed how I thought about things (it eventually becomes habit), my confidence, popularity, and charisma sky rocketed. I hope yours will too!"
CasualConversation,fcnli35,t1_fbu1u2j,1577813805.0,"I’m hoping in the 8 days since you posted this and I read it (heh..reddit), things have gotten better, but if not, know that things WILL get better. Except in cases of suicide, depression eventually resolved itself. Of course meds and talk therapy speed that process along and it’s hard to see the end of pain while in pain, but you won’t feel low foreve ! Plus, your parfait is perfect and no one can take that away from you!"
