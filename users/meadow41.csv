And then that’s it. You can do a handful of radiant raider quests, but it just felt so lackluster. Especially with how good Far Harbor was before"

While I do agree that Pelosi should hold onto the articles until McConnell outlines the terms for the trial, (forgive me if I’m oversimplifying things, but I think most people, myself included, don’t actually know how this process works) we shouldn’t look at this in terms of “we can do what they did, since they did it first.”

Instead, why do we not look at everyone and say “we can do better than what they did”. Even the smallest amounts of cooperation have eroded due to ‘party lines’ ‘patriotism’ or whatever else people peddle from both sides. 

We’re better than this, and we deserve something better than this. Let the chips fall as they may, everyone, and I mean EVERYONE in this country, is entitled to a fair shake, no matter what anyone’s beliefs are."
