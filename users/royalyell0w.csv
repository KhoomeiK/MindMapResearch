The mod team is still working out the kinks in this policy, but we moreso take intent into account, rather than the actual words. Previous contributions within the sub are looked at, the tone used in the comment, and the commenter's intent to actually provide advice or sympathy/empathy.

If the commenter has a history of being rude, argumentative or derailing, and proceeds to start an argument with OP or other commenters, we know they aren't engaging in good faith and feel confident in sticking a ban on it.

From a personal perspective (NOT as a mod), I feel that clarifying circumstances often aren't even critical to providing good advice. Asking exactly what position someone was raped in or how much they had to drink is invasive and fucked up, and borders on victim blaming regardless. This sub is about helping the OP, not learning about the gritty details of a traumatizing experience. People tend to adopt this sub for popcorn and drama purposes and I think that's gross.
