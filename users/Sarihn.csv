I like to think that thw Maester threw the crow in the air with a turbine jammed up its ass, where in a flash it disappears over the horizon leaving a trail of smoke behind it.

  


Or Drogin breaking the sound barrier, and the ensuing sonic boom eviscerates Dany."

""Mom, I did the math, was I a birthday present for dad?"" 

""... Your father had a way with words"" 

  


Another funny thing is Dad would say some lewd stuff about him and mom to get a rise out of us every once in a while. Which sex talk had never really been a taboo topic for us, and mom made damn sure that when we started getting girlfriends and boyfriends that we would use protection and be careful. But anyway one of my buddies was hanging out with me and dad pulled his little schtick, I'm pretty used to it, but my buddy asks me

""That doesnt bother you?""

""What, that? Not really, I mean, It's how I was made so it had to be pretty fucking awesome"""
bestof,fec3psy,t1_fe9oov5,1578966203.0,"34 (last year) when I finally got diagnosed. I tried bringing it up to my general practitioner, but he was adamant that if I had it, I'd have been diagnosed as a child. But since I was more the inattentive type and not the hyperactive type most of the time, I was flew under the radar and told I had no motivation.

  


Plus my parents were the kind that didn't really believe in ADHD, and when I was talking to my mother about it, she would say ""Well you were always like that, mind wandering and daydreaming."" Well, yeah that's what I was getting at. Then she also told me that my uncles did the thing of stopping in the middle of sentences without finishing them. Which point to the fact that it's been in the family for a bit. Also the fact that my youngest brother would have literally been the poster child of what ADHD was thought of being in the 90's. (I did have a talk with him about it, but as an adult he's made it work for him, unlike me)

  


So, I had to go about finding a psychiatrist by myself, because most of the time the Doctors around here think people are just fishing for amphetamines, and the stigma of mental health issues, especially ADHD, is very real."

funny,fdjza1g,t3_elpisf,1578492047.0,"Storytime: I got my wife a KichenAid mixer a few years ago for Christmas. She's wanted one since we moved in together, since she grew up with her parents having one.

Now, I like to prank my wife, and since this was such a big present for her, I decided to have some fun with it. So after I picked it up, I took it to her parent's house, and removed the mixer from the box. I then replaced the mixer with a 20lb dumbell for weight, a bunch of packing paper and a smaller box with a replacement pocket knife to the one I got her when we first started dating. It made for a good line of ""Well, your old one is getting beat up, and I know how sentimental it is to you. You can put the old one away and use the new one"".

  


I then took the mixer to my parent's house, and asked my mom if she had any boxes that would fit the mixer. Well, she had just gotten a new Rachel Ray pan set a few weeks before. Perfect fit. And perfect for my wife, because she fuckin haaates Rachel Ray.

  


So this was a few weeks before Christmas, and my wife ended up getting sick a few days before Christmas. Shit. Preparations were already made, so, fuck it, I'll proceed as planned.

  


Christmas morning comes along and we're opening presents at her parent's house. When she gets to my present, she opens it, and gives the reaction of a child in the 80's, getting an NES or Genesis. Until she opens it that is. All she finds inside is the small box with the pocket knife. I feed her the bullshit of the sentimental value. But put a cherry on top with "" Do you know how hard it is to get a KichenAid box?"" Needless to say she stopped talking to me for the rest of the time we were at her parent's house.

  


We head to my parent's house, where she's lamenting to my dad about how much of a dick move that was. All the while I'm playing grovelling husband part. Now she get's to her ""Pan set"" and does the ""Oh wow we needed new pans"" While dying inside. Dad suggestes that she open it to make sure it was there, since I ""helped"" Mom find it. She opens it to find her now beloved mixer, which she pulls out of the box and holds it like a newborn child.

  


I get called an asshole for doing this to her when she's sick, but I couldn't predict that. She did thank me as well, but the asshole part was waaay more emphasized."

ShouldIbuythisgame,fc6gntp,t1_fc5xive,1577480135.0,"Gorn is way more cartoony and physical. They use a locomotion setting that resembles pulling yourself along 2 rails, and it's quite nice when you get used to it. Your hands are constricted to your physical body instead of your avatar, and you don't have to get a feel for how fast you can swing things like in B&S, but at the cost of the weapons acting like they're made of rubber.

  


The gore is cartoony and violent, and you get reactions from the crowd when you get over the top kills and such. It also has outlandish bosses, like a midget riding a giant crab.

  


In a nutshell, it's like comparing TF2 to CSGO. Both really good fps, both with merits and drawbacks, and thier respective fans preferring one over the other."
