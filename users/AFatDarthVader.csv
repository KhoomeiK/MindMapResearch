joinsquad,fclyzi6,t3_ehszo3,1577759941.0,"1. T-72. Best by far because it's fast, small, and versatile. Shoot-and-scoot is the way to go in Squad and that's what the T-72 is good at. Great turret armor makes it excellent for hull-down positions.
2. Leopard's the long range king, though no remote turret and the one it has is a GPMG.
3. Abrams is okay. It's huge, loud, and makes a really distinguishable noise that alerts the enemy and reveals your location. Good armor, though.
4. Challenger. Meh. Low ammo, vulnerable lower glacis, no HMG, and so goddamn slow.
5. T-62 is obviously the worst but it does well in an ambush against other MBTs. The tiny size is good for surprising blufor teams on urban maps.

The T-72 is the best because mainly because Squad isn't a totally realistic game. I'd rank them differently for MBT vs MBT fights but the game revolves around infantry combat and capture points. The main point of an MBT is to support the infantry by taking out enemy vehicles and softening enemy infantry positions; tank battles only take up a few minutes each game. The conventional MBTs aside from the T-72 are all huge, loud, and pretty slow, so attacking enemy vehicles is a little more difficult and maneuvers are telegraphed. The T-72 is still loud but it's small and fast enough to make a difference, and the ammo variety helps against FOBs. Just keep track of the enemy MBT timer and the T-72 is pretty dominant."
