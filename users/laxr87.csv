sabres,fchv8ix,t1_fcho469,1577654546.0,"I agree with that- none of those guys had first line talent except Kane who did his part here when he gave a shit, the rest were bad signings and trying to make talent grow where there wasn‚Äôt any. And I also agree on Olofsson- he was developed the right way, playing competition he could grow with. I‚Äôm from Rochester, I watched him play for years here. He‚Äôs a fan favorite around here. I actually work at the rink they practice at, Olofsson was a nice kid. I don‚Äôt know that he would be even close to where he‚Äôs at without Jack, though, stats-wise at least. I guess my biggest issue is having 19mil on a single line. 20% of our cap in 2 guys where one is completely self-sufficient and the other needs the former or else he gets 4 points a month is not acceptable. That talent needs to be spread across 2 scoring lines."

sabres,fcgfnog,t1_fcfrt9z,1577639444.0,Skinner is 27. He is in his prime. Sam and Olofsson are 24. Skinner should be the better player being 3 years older. I‚Äôm not sure what your point is other than to offer up short sentences where you presume you‚Äôre correct.
sabres,fcgetp3,t1_fcd5w2a,1577639268.0,"Fair enough. I‚Äôm of the opinion that a guy who makes 9mil a year shouldn‚Äôt need another guy making 9+ mil a year in order for him to be worth his money. Most teams don‚Äôt have their two highest paid players playing on the same line. But I‚Äôll also concede that he was paid based on playing on Jack‚Äôs wing and now he‚Äôs not so that‚Äôs a shit deal for him. I guess I‚Äôm just disappointed in the lack of production overall, as usual."
sabres,fcfqvaz,t1_fccduab,1577632820.0,"Olofsson? Reinhart? Hell, Jack even made Pomminville look young when he was playing with Jack."
sabres,fcbq0pn,t1_fcamepy,1577589699.0,"Sammy came up with Eich so there‚Äôs something to be said for line chemistry overall with him. Also, his numbers have improved each year as Jack as improved(42, 47, 50, 65) over the past 4 years he‚Äôs been consistently on a line with Jack, and he could eclipse that this year if he gets on a streak- he‚Äôs at 30 with 43 games to play. He‚Äôs probably never going to be a 50 goal guy but a consistent 25-35 with a ceiling at 40-45 will help win games. 

I think we forget sometimes that these guys are 23 years old. They‚Äôve been around so long that we forget they‚Äôre still 3 years+ from their prime. It‚Äôs hard for us to hear since we‚Äôve been suffering with shit teams and shit effort and shit coaching so long, but we‚Äôre almost there. A few pieces away, Ralph seems legit, or at least the guys respond to him. A 2C, hopefully Ullmark or 5K make some noise within the next 3-4 years. I know, I know. It‚Äôs always next year, haha."
sabres,fcaao3v,t1_fca4vkp,1577565728.0,"Except that every player that plays on Jack‚Äôs wing scores like that. A 7th round rookie is on pace to score ~35 goals and 75 points on his wing. He is an elite player, playing well with him isn‚Äôt necessarily indicative of much other than Jack‚Äôs talent. If everyone who plays on his wing scores(not taking anything from Golofsson) and then not on their own, it‚Äôs probably Jack and not the others. Jeff got paid to be an elite scorer, he is not doing that without an elite talent feeding him the puck which is not what you should be providing with the paycheck he gets. And MarJo is no slouch, by the way. He‚Äôs more 3C grinder than 2C but he‚Äôs also not garbage and the best we have at the moment until we move some D and picks for a 2C(god willing). Just my take, I guess."
sabres,fca12r0,t1_fc9g6dl,1577561299.0,"Carrying the line? He hasn‚Äôt scored since December 2 and has 4 points including the 2 on Dec. 2. He isn‚Äôt carrying shit, especially for 9mil a year.

I DO care that you treat her with the respect due to someone that you truly care about. I DO care that, especially when I(and she) are NOT around, you act with dignity and integrity. However you behave in front of me, I will assume you act when I am not there. If that is not the case, we‚Äôll have an issue. I do not expect perfection, but I do expect the attempt. 

And with every real or imagined heavenly being as my witness, if you lay a hand on her physically or abuse her emotionally, I will not have mercy.
