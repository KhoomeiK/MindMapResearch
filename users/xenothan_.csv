dogs,ffc6700,t1_ffc5ur1,1579792465.0,"Yeah, can be a common misconception, but depends on the dog! If your dog gets along with other dogs well I wouldn’t sweat it! My first dog has never been the most social and has always preferred people, so when we got our second we didn’t have high expectations. They get along fine, just not the kind of relationship you see on social media where they snuggle together and stuff."
dogs,ffc5718,t1_ffc44s0,1579791793.0,"Absolutely keep your puppy in a crate, unless you don’t mind utter destruction of your belongings and various bodily excretions in places they shouldn’t be. I have loved having two dogs, but it’s a lot of work, and you can’t expect them to be best friends. Puppies are difficult to begin with, but having another dog can just double the work. Walking two dogs can be a bit of a hassle but you adjust pretty quickly. Honestly though getting another dog just means having more dog in your life and who doesn’t want that? Unconditional love times 2!"

Speaking as a 16 year gay dude who would definitely be sexually active if I had the option, I think that’s really generous of you and I know I would deeply appreciate it. I know that a lot of parents see sex as a big deal and want to restrict it as best as possible, so I see where your wife is coming from, but they often loose sight of the fact that teenagers are gonna have sex wether they like it or not. I’m sure you guys did the same shit when you were our age.

If you feel really bad about it maybe tell your wife, but you could explain that she’s being a bit unreasonable and if they are going to have sex (which is unavoidable) it’s best they do it somewhere safe. Trying to limit contact isn’t going to prevent sex, it’s just going to make your son mad at you guys."

3) You can tell a lot from a puppy’s paw and tail size, I got my husky mix when he was about four months old and he had some chunky paws. The people at the shelter said he wouldn’t get much bigger but now he’s about 31kgs (dumb American here so I had to look that up).

Same kinda shtick as vegans that emphasize how their diet is far superior and that they should always be catered to. His dietary choices should not influence anyone else but himself, and if they are annoyingly and inconveniently affecting others he’s being unreasonable. The majority of the population do not partake in specific diets so the majority of food is going to be targeted towards them.  You and your friends have also gone out of your way to accommodate him, he’s just being a picky eater with stupid standards. I’d tell him he can forget about hanging out if he’s gonna make a scene about it, and if he doesn’t understand and respect that just drop him."

I can’t even imagine how much stress and pain you were already in and it’s 100% understandable that you would freak out over the only thing you asked for. If anything he’s the asshole for thinking it was appropriate to just sneak his mom in to watch this very taxing and private experience."
dogs,fewh17b,t1_fev7wu8,1579410447.0,"Okay, again, it really seems like you didn't pay attention to and/or disregarded most of what I wrote. If either I did not mention this or you ignored it here are some things to clear up: 

* I can say with confidence and 100% certainty my dogs would NEVER hurt a person. To restate: I only have ONE dog with aggressive tendencies and she is *only* that way towards certain dogs, never people. 
* Boo can be a bit rowdy by means of jumping and/or barking, but again it's something he is growing out of, and never unmanageable or dangerous. I can just get frustrated because I would prefer to have an easy uninterrupted walk, which I'm aware due to my location isn't always gonna happen, which is fine. It's just a preference and I'm expressing things that irk me, which is also why \[vent\] is in the title. Also, I don't know how you misinterpreted this and I thought this should go without saying, but to clarify, excitable does not in any capacity have to do with aggression. 
* I also never said hyper and/or skittish was synonymous with safety, but how would it be dangerous or whatever else you're implying? I don't think I mentioned it so that's on me but despite the occasional bark, he is very well behaved in dog parks, I'd even say better than on leash. 
* I'm not sure if by ""*you have accepted, apparently due to some unsavory past events, that Scout is aggressive*"" you are implying somehow I can control how trauma affects her. If that is the intention, dogs can only be trained to a certain extent, and not only is she old but she is also very stubborn. Obviously all dogs are different, but as I've mentioned Akitas are more prone to aggression and very hard to train. If that isn't the intention, my bad, but because of your previous sarcastic comment and because this is online it's hard to grasp a tone. 
* I don't think it is rare to have a dog (I use ""a"" because I only have one dog with aggressive mannerisms towards other *dogs*) with behavioral problems. I would find it surprising if the only dogs you've ever met and/or owned had been perfectly behaved all the time, especially if they're from a shelter. 
* Again, my dogs aren't provoked in any negative way because of acknowledgment from other people. And again, Boo just gets a bit excited and distracted *sometimes*, which last time I checked wasn't dangerous at all. I think it's important to be aware that dogs have various reactions to various greetings, it's not just my dogs, a lot of dogs are easily alarmed or what have you and it isn't just limited to aggression or nonchalance. Dogs have feelings and can be unpredictable, just like people, you can't expect them to all behave the exact same way when you greet them. I'm just saying it's more polite to ask before an interaction, that's all."
dogs,fet1n88,t1_fepnwgx,1579370973.0,"1) Your entire point is being bogged down by all this unnecessary sarcasm. This is just overtly rude and totally uncalled for. I'm making a post about the experience I've had with my dogs, this is not any sort of personal attack I'm just expressing my thoughts and concerns. This is an incredibly obtuse response and you're not even trying to have a discussion.

2) I'm assuming you either didn't read the post carefully or chose the parts you didn't like to point out. First of all, only one of my dogs is aggressive which I'm not sure you understood. Second of all, maybe it's just hard to read through all the sarcasm, but to me, it seems like you think it was somehow a choice to make her aggressive or I *wanted* her to be aggressive. As I said, she got into a fight that changed her drastically. I would assume most dog owners know that dogs have their own individual personalities and behaviors that cannot be influenced. 

3) Based on the sarcastic ""um"" I'm assuming you think I bring my aggressive dog to the dog park. I do *not*. I never said I did, in fact, I made it pretty clear I try to not have her interact with other dogs for everyone's safety. 

4) I live in a highly populated city. I'm not sure if you know what that's like, but basically everywhere is private property and there are lots of people and dogs all over the place. I need to walk my dogs and I need to go outside to do that, so it's pretty hard to find a place without people. I'm not saying everyone should know this, that's actually kind of the point of this post, which I said at the beginning. I'm more frustrated with dog owners because it seems like something that should be clearer to them, and this is more of a PSA for pedestrians. I never said you're not allowed to approach my dogs, I don't make any rules here, it's just way better to ask beforehand and be aware that there can be different reactions based on the dog. I love dogs, I'm not saying they're ""deadly"" I'm simply saying they're not all bound to have a positive reaction to everyone."
AmItheAsshole,feot8rs,t3_emfzof,1579305062.0,"YTA. This may sound harsh, but here goes - 

It’s pretty obvious you’re the asshole imo. Your brother CLEARLY feels intense regret and genuinely wants to repair things. He has tried several times in several ways to apologize and make amends. Yes it was a really shitty thing to do, but you’re being petty and quite frankly close minded. 

People are capable of change. You are being very apathetic and a bit selfish by not even trying to hear him out or provide your perspective. You seriously should at least talk to him. 

And tbh I see where your boyfriend is coming from, I would also doubt being in a relationship with someone holding on to so much anger and being so immature about it."
AmItheAsshole,fen15n0,t3_epwqk2,1579274651.0,"NTA - a wedding isn’t an opportunity to mooch off of friends and family members.

The trainer recommended a sprenger collar because of how hard Boo pulled, but he eventually got used to it and I think it might have hurt him. Regardless, it broke so it wasn’t super useful in the long run. The trainer also said because he was difficult she could do an immersive training session by having him at her house for two weeks and just doing intense training I guess. I thought that was pretty weird and I probably wouldn’t have done it anyway, but it cost 2,000 dollars! In hindsight, definitely more of a money grab then anything else."
