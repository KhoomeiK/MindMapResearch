Typically, ice cubes are filled with tiny pockets of air, which creates a structural weakness. For instance, if you were to boil the water before making it into an ice cube, it would be closer to truly clear and would not crack nearly as quickly. The tiny bubbles make the ice between them very thin, and under this newfound energy, break. The center is typically where the majority of bubbles form, since the water will freeze from the outside first in a traditional freezer."
