pics,fdnwm4d,t1_fdnvmp7,1578594333.0,yeah my point was just the packaging.  instead of selling you 3 for $2.00 at walmart they will sell you 1 for $1.00 at dollar general
pics,fdnwgfe,t1_fdnvner,1578594241.0,"okay so you're saying that the mom and pop stores offered a better selection of goods?  maybe that's true, maybe not, depends on the city probably

also you're saying we are better off with these people working at those mom and pop stores instead of working at dollar general (or losing their job).  in economics they assume labor is mobile and will move to a more efficient occupation.  mom and pop stores are not pareto optimal in a free market usually.  it is more efficient to have one store with lower prices (economies of scale) and let those workers move on to other jobs

btw I shop at dollar general all the time so I have a really good idea of what they sell.  it's the same shit, just packaged in different quantities"

pics,fdnkopw,t1_fdnja1q,1578587815.0,"well I have two degrees in economics and that is a concept they taught us in international trade.  so you're wrong, buying the same things for less money DOES increase the amount of money you have to spend on other things... AKA your ""income"""
pics,fdnimnb,t1_fdnhgmu,1578586589.0,"okay but if consumers are paying less for the same goods they were buying before, then this effectively raises their income.  sure, a few local store owners might lose their job but everyone else gets cheaper goods to buy"
