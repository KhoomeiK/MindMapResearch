wholesomememes,ffeojxi,t1_ffemamk,1579857501.0,I just read Hogfather and Night Watch. So good.
ThatsInsane,ffbknl4,t1_ffahg0i,1579769885.0,"Border terriers are severely underappreciated. My family has rescued two border mixes over the years and they are a uniquely crafty bunch. The first in particular would dig her way under the back fence, disappear into the neighborhood for a couple of hours, and be back just when we were coming back to the house to regroup from looking for her. When we fixed that and blocked it off better, she'd just hop over the 4 foot chain link in another part of the yard and we'd catch her slinking past us in the front yard. Eventually we had to jerry-rig a two foot extension to it and she could still almost clear it.

The second one is just as sneaky but in her own way. I moved out not long after we got her, but I've heard stories about how sneaky she is with food. Likes to steal from her pug mix brother (absolutely massive for a pug, and doofy beyond belief) whenever she can get away with it"
TalesFromYourServer,ffbjluc,t1_ffb1wqg,1579768383.0,"Well right now with the tip credit in NY we're getting 10/hr (minimum) plus tips. If restaurants raise their prices according to whatever the percentage the commission would be, then it'd overall be essentially the same thing to the business/GM and the owners. Money in goes up by X% and money out goes up by X%. There are taxes of some sort involved I'm sure, but I think at least initially a business would be able to pass it off as an included gratuity on each item and thus funnel it directly to staff.

Might be a different story, numbers-wise, for bartenders but I would argue that liquor, beer, and wine markups are high enough that businesses could find a way to justify it. Additionally a 25-30% higher price on well drinks would only mean $1.50 or $2.50 of an increase at most places, and a lot of the others are serving clientele that are spending enough to not feel the difference. Might mean a few fewer comps for friends and regulars so that bartenders can keep their sales totals but I doubt anyone's going to pitch a fit over getting comped 2 drinks a night instead of 3. Honestly, anyone who doesn't slip you an extra five or ten after you comp them a couple drinks isn't worth your time anyway and I doubt they'd change that habit if you're still giving them drinks (although it could if they're exceptionally unaware), so your totals stay intact and off the books.

I'm sick and tired of getting stiffed on $200+ checks, or even anything above 75, which is what's inspiring this. I realize that bartenders are generally doing better percentage-wise than most servers, but I also hear a lot from my bartenders about people who rack up over a hundred bucks in beers or shots then tip like nine dollars to round it to the nearest ten. It comes out in the wash because they've got a few overnight regulars who shower a few twenties on them for pouring two drinks of Old Rip Van Winkle, but I know for a fact those guy would still throw a good forty to fifty bucks their way, if not more, if prices increased and tips were rendered unnecessary.

Never going to propose banning tips entirely or having them go to the house, but in Manhattan at least (not knowing where you're behind the bar ofc) we get a ton of tourists who either don't know or are pretending not to know what a halfway decent tip is. When I went to Scotland for the Fringe, bartenders were ""accidentally"" giving me doubles for hours if I gave them a few extra pounds as a tip on the first round I got. That seems to translate here with tourists - I'll get profuse thanks and handshakes all around ""for the excellent service and for the banter"", and a 5-10% tip. 

It'd be nice to have something guaranteed when a table spends a lot of money, and have whatever else crosses my palm be a bonus, which is what tips were historically.

I usually average 19-22% but I'd happily drop to 18 if it were consistent. Would save me from having nights like New Year's, and I wouldn't be as anxious when I get slammed, which would honestly help me keep a higher level of service."
TalesFromYourServer,ffahbcm,t1_ff8yay2,1579735735.0,"My reasoning is that people buy more and return more often to the restaurant when they're happy with the service. It's not extra money in the same way, but higher sales would more directly correlate to higher pay. Also, there's nothing stopping a particularly happy customer from slipping you a little extra"
TalesFromYourServer,ffah3h3,t1_ff94gto,1579735593.0,"I guess you didn't read the post then because minimum wage isn't what I outlined here.

TalesFromYourServer,fexeeau,t1_fexcyl1,1579429646.0,"I'm very well aware of why big tables get autogratted lol

I'm not sure how that's arguing otherwise, though, since any sane person in a big party is going to get that it's significantly more hassle to deal with them than most other tables. My point stands: if people in big parties complain about being autogratted, it's because they mean to screw you after taking up a bunch of your time and effort, and taking up your table(s) for however long. Very few people are legitimately clueless enough (though maybe your margarita lady was) to not notice"
TalesFromYourServer,fexc4dt,t1_fexamh7,1579428428.0,"That's kind of an argument for my point, though. Raise prices so it's all on the front end, no surprises. Employee gets fair pay, and instead of having to shell out purely on hourly, the employee is still incentivized by the employer to sell more and more product. Customer sees a higher price on the menu but isn't actually getting charged more than they probably would have paid anyway, once the no-longer-a-thing tip is factored in.

The only people who complain about autograt are the ones who are trying to screw you in my experience, and we as an industry ought to take it out of their hands. I got tipped nothing on a 400$ check once because the guy was hammered and decided he didn't want to tip on a bottle of Dom and some snacks after my manager insisted on auto-gratting them against my better judgment. In NYC that's 70-80 bucks that I and my support staff just lost, plus the two hours he and his friend spent at my best table from 2 til 4 in the morning."
TalesFromYourServer,fexa7nl,t1_fex8q4m,1579427572.0,"I'm personally not about to downvote you for what seems to be an honest opinion, if one that my own experiences don't support. I'm happy to chalk it down to that difference, although I do have to disagree with your idea that it's already a commission based service. Commissions are paid out by employers, not customers. A car salesperson or a real estate agent isn't handed cash at the end of their transactions and told ""here you go, this is how much I think your help was worth"". The amount they get, the percentage of the sale, is already decided upon and agreed upon by the employer and employee.  


I acknowledge that prices would rise, and I personally would be happy to have that happen as a customer. What you're bringing up here is what would happen if owners (and I'm going to make the assumption and say primarily franchise and corporate owners, because mom-and-pop places go out of business fast if they don't treat their employees well) try to squeeze a little extra value out of the transition.  


When I was in Rome, or Tokyo, or Osaka, or Edinburgh, or any of the other places I've been that don't treat tipping the same way we do here, I honestly had a better impression of the service. Only in North America have I experienced actual crap service."
TalesFromYourServer,fex1su3,t1_fex092w,1579422923.0,"Sometimes it's even kind of nice haha

Basically how it works is our restaurant never goes on a wait, so the kitchen can get swamped with orders, and servers who have a few tables close out are vulnerable to getting quadruple- or quintuple-sat (regardless of whether or not the table is actually cleaned or set). When we're really deep in the weeds, having a table or two camping for a little while can actually be useful because it's safe from being sat for part of the rush. If they're just doing their thing then I can focus on the three or four new tables I have instead of having potentially five all sat at once. Given that some people come in and want to take ten minutes going through the entire menu with me at the worst times, that camping table is a potential lifesaver.  


On NYE I literally tried to get a few different groups of my friends to come in and camp my tables for a hot minute so I could use that strategy and keep up the level of service for my other overnight tables. Sadly, it didn't work and NYE was an absolute shitshow  


Speaking of great regulars though, there's this one little old guy that comes in sometimes, usually between 11:30 PM and 1 AM. Just a great guy, loves our half chicken and iced tea. He's a bit of a talker so it can slow down other tables by a bit (though he's super understanding that I gotta take care of other folks), but I was going through a really hard time for a big chunk of this year and he took time to make sure I was okay every single time I saw him. Still checks on my while I'm on my way out the door and I see him. That man has earned a lot of goodwill and genuine loyalty from me. I'd kick someone's ass on his behalf, very few questions asked."
TalesFromYourServer,fewqqd9,t1_fewbtq6,1579418080.0,"Employers certainly lobbied against it, but as the article says, employee representation groups were pushing hard for it. I'm not sure who exactly you meant by ""restaurant industry people"", but most people with foresight working as servers or bartenders wouldn't be against being fairly paid in favor of the occasional huge tip. Getting stiffed repeatedly and worrying about how the night is going to be outweighs that by a great deal"
TalesFromYourServer,fewpz1j,t1_fewm1c4,1579417752.0,"I mean I'm benefiting from it a great deal myself, but the numbers I'm proposing would have me making about the same as I am with tips now, assuming sales remain more or less consistent. It's less about whether or not it's a short term job and more about smoothing it out to be a little less miserable"
TalesFromYourServer,feutnqc,t1_feuom3a,1579389773.0,"When I was in Edinburgh for the Fringe this summer, it was astounding to me the difference in atmospheres between American (also Canadian) and Scottish restaurants. I tipped pretty much everywhere regardless just because I'm in the industry and I try to be generous with my fellow service people, but it was astounding to me what a couple of pounds would do.  


Part of the issue with tipping culture on this side of the Atlantic is just that - it's part of the culture and has been for long enough that people don't ""get"" the alternative. Another part is that we're used to relatively low costs in restaurants (at least compared to our frankly insane portion sizes). Restaurants here (I don't know anything about what costs are like in the UK or SA) are generally surviving on a very thin margin; the one where I work in particular is one of very few in our corporate group that's actually turning a profit. To raise workers' wages to a livable point for this city, the restaurant's food prices would shoot up by probably about 25-30%, and drinks most likely by 20% or so.  


Minimum wage in NYC right now is 15$ per hour. There's a tip credit of 5$ that can be applied against it depending on how much a tipped employee makes over the course of a pay period. Long story short, I always make at least 15$ an hour, but to survive out here - just rent, bargain shopping for food, utilities, and transport - I'm looking at needing about 25$ an hour. Little to no savings, no rainy day fund, barely any room for buying new clothes, no replacing stuff that breaks.  


So, I'd need at bare minimum a 67% increase from the minimum wage for living here to be an option. Right now, the restaurant itself is paying me 10$ an hour because my average tips/hour works out to be 15-25$  by itself. Meaning, with tips, I make between 25 and 35$ an hour. As you might imagine, I'm a pretty decent server and it's a busy restaurant. Sucking up to people is awful, but I'm really good at being friendly enough that sucking up is relatively rarely necessary.  


There are a few restaurants that pay a living wage, and they're doing well enough. They're generally very high-end places though, so they can fold in that cost without it being a huge extra burden on the customer."
TalesFromYourServer,feugyth,t1_feufw0n,1579386486.0,"Oof, I feel you about the seniors. We've got this one couple who's been coming to our restaurant for so long that they have a standing 15% discount and everyone knows their routine when they come in.  


Nice enough folks, (honestly kind of a riot when they're in a really good mood) but they take up a 4-top for the two of them for an hour and a half, their check rarely goes above 50$ (our entrees average about 27 or so), and they like to kvetch about the music before tipping 15-17% on the total post-discount.  


Consistent, and like I said, nice enough folks. But that four-top they like is one of the best tables in the restaurant and it's disappointing sometimes to see other fours racking up 3-400 while they're chilling there.  


I'll say this in their defense, however: they're very understanding when it gets busy and surprisingly low maintenance besides the music thing. They're the kind of people that I like having around when I'm slammed because their presence helps me keep pace without getting overwhelmed, since we never go on a wait no matter how rowdy it is."

AskReddit,fecvrde,t3_eodtd1,1578986552.0,"At one point a few years back, I dated a girl who seemed to be showing worse and worse symptoms of what I thought was bipolar disorder (I had been diagnosed with it myself a year or so prior and was seeing a lot of similar behavior to what I had done before starting medication). I tried repeatedly to convince her to see a doctor, if only for a consult or something. She promised me she would and every so often gave me updates.

Eventually it became evident that she had been lying about it, and she ended up breaking up with me to be with a mutual friend of ours who just so happened to have and sell a lot of drugs. They did a bunch of drugs together, then he decided he was more interested in a friend of hers, dumped her, and moved on to the next girl.

My ex, however, had only just started to spiral out of control. Our friend group was pretty tight-knit so I was around for a lot of what came to pass that summer before I left for college. She partied harder than ever before, in a way that she wasn't mentally or physically capable of sustaining. Drugs, alcohol, a whole lot of risk-taking behavior... Telltale signs of what I still assumed to be the mental illness we shared. I heard more and more about what she was up to whenever my friends back home told me about what they'd been up to, and it only got worse. Eventually we got back in touch with one another and she told me even more. It had gotten real messy and she wasn't in great shape.

After finals in my freshman year, I went home for the summer. My birthday was coming up anf I was planning a big night out, so when we were hanging out one afternoon, I brought it up and invited her. She got in real close and started alluding to wanting to get in bed with me again as a ""birthday present"". She continued on about how she'd been thinking about me a lot and wanted to get back together. I wouldn't have been able to handle the whole ordeal again and I knew it (nor could I afford to get involved in her new lifestyle for fear of getting sucked in myself), so I shut her down as gently as I could.

I got a panicked call from her father, who'd hated me from the first time we met, the next night after I got home from my seasonal job. He told me she'd gone missing and begged me to round up everyone we both knew to try and find her. A couple of hours later, after doing my best to locate everyone and look for her, talking to the police and trying to figure out what she could have been doing, the cops told us she'd been found and cleared out in a hurry.

I found out a couple of days later that she had run directly at a metro as it entered the station. She survived, but only just, and she was in a medically induced coma for a couple of months. Multiple broken bones, surgery to remove the parts of her brain that were too damaged, removal and replacing of a piece of her skull to allow the brain to swell enough all made it so that she was reduced to a toddler in an adult's body when she woke up. Some of it came back. Most didn't. She's not even a shadow of who she once was. That bright and fierce young woman is, for all intents and purposes, dead. 

It turned out she'd had schizophrenia all along, and was only diagnosed after the suicide attempt when they could observe her for extended periods of time. I wish I could have convinced her to seek help."
