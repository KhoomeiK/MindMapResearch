depression,ff8gydc,t3_es8jor,1579678022.0,"I think finding things to distract you will help. It sucks being lonely but friends, after they find relationships tend to slightly withdraw from you. That's how it's been in my experience. I did the same thing to my friends. Finding people to talk to helps get the mind off depression and loneliness. You can pm me if you want."
depression,fe0913c,t1_fdn65kr,1578806430.0,Thanks friend.
BreakUps,fe00epl,t1_fdu9b3r,1578800071.0,Thank you. I've been sober for 3 months.
BreakUps,fdu7ahh,t3_en3xmb,1578728834.0,Being honest with him about how you feel is probably a good thing. It really sounds like he misses you and I'm sure he does. It is extremely difficult for people to just lose feelings for someone.
BreakUps,fdu6akq,t3_en47b1,1578728331.0,"I don't think you should give this guy another shot. He's not putting in that much effort, and it would honestly probably be a waste of your time."
BreakUps,fdu5lu7,t3_en4ayb,1578727973.0,"I think the best way to go about this is to take a break. It honestly sounds like he needs to work on himself if he wants things to work out with you. Let him know the reasons why things aren't working because some guys never really think of why. Taking a break let's you have time to sort things out in your head, and it gives him time to do the same."
BreakUps,fdu4sm4,t3_en4crf,1578727553.0,I am in a very similar situation. My ex and I had been together for six years. She was the best friend I've ever had. We ended up getting married six months ago. Our marriage fell apart because of my drinking. We had been together since we were 19 and she was my first real relationship. It's been three months since we separated and we still live together. I'm still in love with her but she isn't with me. I'm not sure if still being friends is any better because I haven't gotten to grieve without her eventually being there to comfort me.
BreakUps,fdu0dp6,t3_en32c8,1578725275.0,I wouldn't worry about it too much. There is always the possibility he is trying to make you jealous.
BreakUps,fdtp07q,t1_fdtoazr,1578719985.0,That's a really good question. My problem is that I care too much. I will never understand how some people can't feel love the way I do or care for people the way I do
BreakUps,fdtn5ke,t1_fdtmim6,1578719185.0,Because it didn't mean the same thing to him as it meant to you. He took you for granted. It's starting to make sense why you two weren't right for each other.
BreakUps,fdtmb3p,t3_en32c8,1578718825.0,"It sounds like he wasn't a very emotional person. Some people take break ups harder than others. My latest break up I took extremely hard and probably won't ever get over. All people are different, but I definitely wouldn't blame yourself for him not feeling."
depression,fdtl8zz,t3_en2v47,1578718382.0,I feel like this a lot. I get connected with people quickly especially when we have a lot of fun. I feel like you're probably depressed because you miss that person
AskReddit,fdpz2o8,t3_emoe5t,1578646799.0,The sound of ice jingling in a glass of water.
depression,fdpyu2y,t3_em63p1,1578646477.0,"I am extremely happy to hear that! Life may not get better like everyone says, but at least you can make the best of it while you're here. I think traveling would be a very exciting thing to do. Almost makes me think of a bucket list type thing. Remember to try and keep your head up bud, and I will try and do the same."
AskReddit,fdp88zk,t1_fdp3fcx,1578622310.0,This is the song I was going to comment. My ex used to sing this to me in the car all the time. Last time I heard it i turned into a complete mess.

depression,fdmpwkd,t3_em70n1,1578559957.0,Going through the same thing man. Talking to people about the situation really helps me
depression,fdmpnfp,t1_fdmp1dc,1578559614.0,My gf of 6 years recently cheated on me. We got married 4 months ago. I wanted to kill the guy and then myself at first but of course I didn't. There are a few different ways this can pan out. Don't you want to stick around and see what you can make out of a shitty situation?
AskReddit,fdmp941,t3_em6nqm,1578559080.0,Hmm maybe Forrest Gump
SuicideWatch,fdmp62t,t3_em6o4c,1578558968.0,I wouldn't do it just yet
depression,fdmotxr,t3_em6paj,1578558518.0,The emotion should come back. Whatever you did had reasoning behind it. Hopefully you will learn to forgive yourself
AskReddit,fdmooap,t3_em6pgq,1578558311.0,She will eventually fall in love with me again. I am good enough
AskReddit,fdmolsr,t3_em6poz,1578558219.0,I tell him to go for the throat pls
Anxiety,fdmojs0,t3_em6prq,1578558147.0,This is actually normal I believe. I wake up in fear every morning for no reason. It's because we are completely vulnerable when we are asleep so anything could happen without us knowing. I get very little sleep

depression,fdmmfux,t3_em63p1,1578555545.0,"I am suicidal, but refuse to kill myself because of the pain it will inflict on other people. I think what would help in your situation is doing something completely insane that you have always wanted to do. I mean you have nothing to lose. If you die doing it, at least it wouldn't be killing yourself. Who knows this could be the thing that turns your life around. Good luck friend."
depression,fdmm6nk,t3_em63s0,1578555253.0,"It sounds like you have surrounded yourself with shitty people. There are good people out there who can be good friends to you. It's sometimes hard to find kind people, but they're out there. I'm sorry to hear about the rough birthday though"
depression,fdmm1op,t3_em63so,1578555094.0,Not sure if this helps but you're not alone. I am stuck feeling not good enough after trying to get a girl back for months that I was madly in love with. Hobbies and spending time with friends seems to help me though.
depression,fdmltm1,t3_em63vb,1578554831.0,I feel the same way.. it seems to me that the harder you try with people the more they push you away. Maybe it's just shitty people idk
AskReddit,fdmlmv1,t3_em63ym,1578554608.0,You find love and it destroys you. Focus on yourself and don't forget about your friends
relationships,fdmlhr4,t3_em63zl,1578554440.0,"You sound like a very loyal good girl. To me it sounds like this guy is eventually going to hurt you. He knows that you are uncomfortable with him see her and still goes behind your back. He doesn't respect you and therefore doesn't deserve you. I would never go hang out with another girl alone without making sure it was okay with the girl that I was with, especially if we had a history. There are way better guys out there that will show you and only you the respect that you deserve. Good luck"

AskReddit,fdmkmff,t3_em64js,1578553437.0,That's not wierd at all. It is still interaction with another human. You can learn about each others lives and even create deep feelings. This is completely normal
relationships,fdmk9fp,t3_em4mve,1578553033.0,"Thank, That's what a lot of people have been telling me. I know that's what I'm eventually going to have to do. I keep lying to myself and thinking I can somehow make it work. It's been three months and she still doesn't even treat me as a friend. Thanks again for the advice."
Anxiety,fdmfzid,t3_em59y1,1578548626.0,You are definitely not alone. People on here have a lot of useful tips and tricks to get panic attacks to stop. I have chronic panic attacks that get so bad that I will end up in a corner shaking. I would eventually like to try the no meds thing.
relationships,fdmewr3,t1_fdme69q,1578547635.0,"I will try that. There is definitely a lot to write. Leaving is another issue. If I do, she won't have anywhere to go as she doesn't have any relatives that live close, and she had no car or job"
relationships,fdme4ke,t3_em4mve,1578546940.0,"Thank you guys. It's difficult because I'm letting her use me just to be around her and care for her. I know it's pathetic.
We still have sex a lot, which I told myself I wouldn't do because it really messed with me. It doesn't effect her the same way. It's so hard to tell her no. I'm not happy here but I'm afraid I will be less happy if I leave."
relationships,fdmdwjv,t1_fdmbjg9,1578546746.0,Thank you. I know I deserve someone better. It's just so difficult to move on.

SuicideWatch,fdg56gq,t3_el7vp4,1578380454.0,The only reason I haven't killed myself is because of the people that it will hurt. At this point in my life I am glad I never did
AskReddit,fdg4yb1,t3_el7vsf,1578380195.0,"If you have already done everything humanly possible to win them back, and you are accepting of that, then you need to work on yourself. See why the relationship didn't work and fix certain things about yourself. Surrounding yourself with friends and family always helps too. I just went through a terrible heartbreak and I am just now starting to be okay. The thing that helped me most is talking to people. Hang in there friend, everyone has to go through this sometimes."
depression,fdg34pi,t3_el170m,1578378244.0,"This has been me lately. I never really paid attention to it until I really needed people because I was depressed. It seems that when you need people to talk to, they see that as a weakness and lose interest in talking to you. It's kind of funny how people work sometimes."
Anxiety,fd6ap72,t3_ejzjex,1578188096.0,Dude I had someone like that. Women that make you feel that way don't come along often. She definitely sounds like a keeper. My advise is to treat her like a queen and never stop.

depression,fccpxqk,t3_eh15k7,1577601256.0,I'm going through one of the most depressing times of my life. I am extremely chatty but honestly don't have a lot of people that want to have deep conversations with me. I live for long talks it helps me cope with things and listening to other people's issues helps me get my mind off my own. pm me if you want to talk
