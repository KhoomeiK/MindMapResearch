offmychest,ff64kil,t1_ff5gvp5,1579618968.0,It is. Growing up is hard. Being a new parent is super hard. The father of my child wasn't helpful at all and people don't realize how lonely that time is for new moms.  Sending good thoughts and energy your way. You can do this.
offmychest,ff47fze,t3_erggc3,1579557193.0,"Some guys and girls are honestly just good friends. Some have feelings that are more than friends. Some, one person has feelings that are more than friendship and the other person doesn't. 

It's natural for you to feel jealous if he is talking about her in a way that indicates he likes her as more than just a friend, and it's not respectful to you for him to talk to you about her that way. You're not his therapist or mom. 

I would suggest setting a boundary or re-evaluating the relationship. A guy doing this is a sign that he's not ready for a serious, mature relationship."
offmychest,ff43dtl,t3_erifgz,1579554663.0,"You gave your kitty a long, wonderful life. You didn't want to put him through surgery and that's completely understandable. He was near the end of his time and his quality of life wouldn't have been great. It's okay. You did what was best. 

I'm sorry for your loss <3"
offmychest,ff41z2g,t3_ereawd,1579553793.0,I am sorry that you have been through so many struggles. Maybe the best part of your life hasn't happened yet. Don't give up. You are not stupid. Message me if you want a friend to talk to. I'm a 30 year old female.
offmychest,ff3szs6,t3_ercjnm,1579548198.0,"Your self worth doesn't depend on how others treat you, it depends on what you think of yourself and how you let others treat you. Start thinking about what kind of life you want to provide your son and start working towards that."
offmychest,fedt42j,t1_fedcsuq,1579019320.0,"I think people are taking your comment personally and misunderstanding your point. I think you are describing how some people take zero accountability for their actions for years and years of their adulthood and continue to blame it on their childhood, instead of actually trying or getting the help they need. 

Trauma is terrible and not a person's fault, but it is the person's responsibility to eventually work on healing themselves and growing past the trauma. Help is available without insurance and can be found with not much difficulty, but a lot of people refuse to actually work through their issues and they continue the toxic coping mechanisms that causes self destruction and hurts others."
raisedbynarcissists,fc6lqlj,t3_ege5po,1577483558.0,"Same. I keep my mom at arms length, don't tell her anything personal and don't ask her for any favors. She will not say anything supportive and will use it against me."
raisedbynarcissists,fc6l6zc,t3_egb57x,1577483193.0,Get financially separate from your mom asap. I feel like I just read a story about me and my mom. You are not ungrateful. You did not misunderstand her. Keep enforcing your boundaries. Let go of the mean things she said. You're doing good. I'm proud of you.
raisedbynarcissists,fc6jrnl,t3_efzywu,1577482244.0,"YES. I experienced anxiety from over dramatic NM reactions if I wasn't able to ""read her mind"" and do what she expected me to do. There truly is no winning. I've learned to move freely and do whatever I believe is considerate to myself and everyone, and not take her reactions personally. I also take anxiety medication. I'm sure that helps with a lot."
raisedbynarcissists,fc3plc7,t3_eff0up,1577395453.0,"My boyfriend asked my dad and nmom if he could ask me to marry him. My dad responded happily yes and my nmom said ""Are you sure you want to marry her??"" Thanks mom :) 

We found rings we like on a cruise a few months ago and are waiting for them to come back resized. We have a very healthy relationship. He has seen my mom's N behavior a few times, acknowledged it as not healthy and has been very supportive and understanding. He's literally a God send amazing man and my best friend."
raisedbynarcissists,fbv6bqa,t3_eemlr1,1577126233.0,"I understand. I don't think people can comprehend how it has been for you, being her daughter. And anyone close to your mom is probably confused about their own experiences with her, or in denial about how 'off' she is....

I went through a very unstable childhood with my mother. Moving a lot. Her praising me and spoiling me in front of people, but not emotionally supportive or available when a person needs a parent to be. My mother would have fits of rage. When I was 14, she asked me if I was trying to seduce my step father when I was wearing a bathing suit during the summer and we had a pool in the back yard... just weird, jealous shit NM's do. 

Ever since I stopped depending on her for ANYTHING, became financially and emotionally independent from her, her narc behavior is much less towards me because she has nothing to hold over my head. 

On the outside and on the fake world of Facebook, she seems like a lovely, wonderful person, therefore a ""good"" mother.  

When I accomplish something, and no one is around to hear her, she will surely say something to discredit or judge whatever I did. This used to tear me apart. But I've come to accept that she will never be the healthy, supportive mother I wanted, and I'm a grown woman that doesn't need her approval. I believe in myself, and I seek out healthy friendships and healthy relationships with other family members."
