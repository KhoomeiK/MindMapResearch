He couldnâ€™t scrounge up $550 for for a wedding venue, flowers and photographer?! Thatâ€™s an incredibly reasonable price for everything you get. Also, they could have gotten married on the beach. A beach wedding doesnâ€™t have to be boujee or expensive."

Ya know, I got a sample of the Angel perfume recently (Scentbird) and it leaked in the mail. When I opened the envelope it about knocked me over. Yâ€™all werenâ€™t kidding when you said itâ€™s a strong scent. Thatâ€™s what I imagine Darcy smelled like that day."

MrRobot,fbwd80j,t3_eens3q,1577146845.0,Are we sure the Real Elliot looks just like MM Elliot? I thought thatâ€™s why the ID didnâ€™t match in the alternate/dream universe? Also didnâ€™t Real Elliot have a different eye color than the MM Elliot?
