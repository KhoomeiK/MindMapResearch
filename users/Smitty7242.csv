AlternateHistory,ff40yl9,t3_erdyfq,1579553163.0,"Martin Luther King would be a hell of a lot less popular today than he is. This is assuming, of course, he wouldn't just be killed in the next attempt. 

King was gunned down just during the period where he started to openly advocate for what we today would call radical leftism. Just like Bobby Kennedy. MLK believed that the fight for civil rights in the South was finished, and it was time to address racial inequality in the supposedly desegregated North. Most notably, he wanted to address black poverty and unofficial segregation in Chicago. 

He wanted busing, affirmative action, even to some extent the redistribution of property. These were all things he believed were necessary and justified in the fight to address the more subtle evils of northern racism. 

White people nowadays who hate Jesse Jackson weep insincere or ignorant tears over how far he and other subsequent black leaders strayed from MLK's white-friendly version of civil rights. The reality is that Jesse Jackson was one of MLK's trusted advisers, and although MLK was a much wiser strategist than Jackson, their beliefs were and are essentially the same. 

MLK's death saved him as a ""safe black hero"" for white America. And yet, still, all around the country today you have older white people rolling their eyes that we even have a holiday for him. And they don't even know how leftist he really was. If they read some of the things he was writing and saying shortly before he died, they'd actively take up the cause to remove the holiday."

gaming,ff3xuyb,t1_ff3qkpq,1579551228.0,"Although I am not familiar with this particular picture, I get the joke - so here goes:

The woman appears to be part of a video game criticism panel. Often times, feminist critics of games and other media will reject certain plot lines, etc., as being mere fantasy fulfillment for men. There are myriad reasons why a feminist could find this objectionable - sometimes it renders female characters shallow and unrealistic, other times it is just too predictable.

Video games players seem to take particular umbrage with this line of feminist criticism. Perhaps this is because video games have always consisted primarily of fantasy fulfillment, and rejecting certain kinds of fantasies just because not everyone likes them might have a chilling effect on video game creativity. Perhaps, as feminists often hold, male gamers like having a males-only space and consider any consultation of feminist critics to be a threat to that space.

There was an entire internet guerrilla war over this called ""Gamergate."" Its so convoluted and drawn-out that someone should make a video game out of it. Anyway.

The woman in this picture is engaging in the sort of feminist criticism of video game I mentioned above. One might imagine that the game she is playing, in order for her criticism to make sense, would be one in which a male character is dominating enemies, hunting game, and bedding the womenfolk.

The joke is funny because it subverts this expectation - the game actually consists of a man waking up and, for once, not being depressed. It is actually kind male-self-deprecation. Like ""Hey, feminists, if video games actually consisted of male fantasy fulfillment it would just be a bunch of men not being depressed."""

Showerthoughts,feklpwx,t3_epns4i,1579202665.0,"Perhaps that is the basis of the criticism - it is like a self-soothing fantasy.  

Older people, frustrated that the world won't stop changing, embarrassed that they are starting to fall behind in technological proficiency, imagine these young people attempting to navigate a world of rotary pay phones, snail mail and physical highway maps, and chuckle to themselves about how mystified and helpless the kids would be. 

The problem with this, though, is that if a person born in 2004 were born in 1974 instead, that person would have learned and become skilled at the technology which was in use during that period. It isn't like rotary phones are actually difficult to use - they are just difficult if no one has ever showed you how to do it. 

Same goes for all sorts of pre-internet problems. Its not like someone born in 2004 would be incapable of calling a movie theater to ask for showtimes rather than looking it up online, or of ordering a free-with-your-membership map from AAA, or of making a playlist with a cassette tape and radio that records. Its just that they never had to learn. If they, for some reason, were forced to learn, I think they'd be just as good at those things as older people used to be. 

I think what's really happening is the older we get, the more jaded we get about technology in general. Thus, the less interested we are in learning the latest technology. There is no generation alive on Earth today that hasn't lived through a period of rapid technological change. It has become a fact of life. And when you are 14 and hear about the latest method for listening to music, it sounds revolutionary and awesome and like something you immediately need to master.

Membership is complicated, and is usually dictated by the desires of the powerful and by the need to occasionally expand the definition in order to maintain the race's strength, but not to the point where everyone gets to be white and therefore it becomes meaningless. 

For instance, eastern and southern European immigrants to the US in the 19th and 20th centuries were not considered to be, strictly speaking, white. The Irish were seen as a lesser race of pre-Germanic Celtic barbarians, whose natural inclinations were to sloth, slavish obedience to masters like landlords and the Pope, and to drunken brawling. The Italians, especially the further south you got, were seen has having been excessively interbred with North African barbarians, especially during the Islamic conquests of that region. The eastern European Slavs were considered Asian - closer to the Chinese than to, say, the British. 

The KKK, for instance, did not consider these groups to be white. Neither did Hitler (he downplayed the unwhiteness of Italians out of convenience for his ally, but in general).

Thus love, honor, duty, etc., - things that once provided motivations for generations of society - appear to the post war generations as shallow abstractions, created by states, religions or corporations to manipulate people.

Wallace believed the rise of more irreverent pop culture in the post war era, including pop music, absurd and vulgar comedy, and cynical revisions of history were all influenced by this. And he believes that while much of the old world deserved mockery and deconstruction, he believed the entire point of the process was to find a better truth - one that resonates better with today's world.

But he feared we've become so addicted to sarcasm, cynicism and pretending not to care about or believe in anything that the process became an end in and of itself.

Back in the day, dudes used to bully each other's masculinity with accusations of homosexuality. Now that open homophobia is seen as lame even among many misogynists, the ""cuck"" accusation has become the perfect substitute. Its not that a man is a bitch because he has sex with other men, now its because his partner has sex with other people and he cowardly lets it happen. This extends not just to actual sex, but even the suggesting of something sexual. 

Not to say that jealousy or insecurity as a form of TM (that's toxic masculinity, not transcendental meditation) is new - it reminds me of Tommy in Goodfellas (Joe Pesci's character), who would get dangerously angry if his girlfriend even discussed a celebrity crush, and who couldn't be told by her about the doorman that hits on her every day because she suspects he would literally murder him. But I think its come back into vogue in a big way.

I was a bit reluctant about using the word ""spun,"" because frankly you'd think spin was hardly necessary. As someone elsewhere pointed out, our whole pacific portfolio of territories was hit as well as our fleet. It was bad and was clearly an attack on the US. Didn't take much to convince the people of that. 

Or at least you wouldn't think - I just read a book about America's complicated relationship with its overseas territories, and it basically was the entire reason I used the word ""spun."" 

Turns out, the US doesn't like to emphasize the fact that it has colonial possessions because we like to portray ourselves as the champions of self-rule. This is a reason that many people even today are unaware that Puerto Rico or Guam or the Virgin Islands are part of the U.S. 

When the Japanese attacked us in the Pacific, the Roosevelt administration was worried that Americans might not see it as an attack on our country. They believed Hawaii was the most likely candidate for sympathy because of the relatively high white-to-native population and the fact that it was already becoming a popular vacation spot for Americans. It just felt more like America and less like Asia. 

In his Pearl Harbor speech, FDR barely mentioned the Philippines even though they had already been hit by that point - and they were bigger, more populated and arguably more important to us than Hawaii. People in the Philippines, including General MacArthur, were really upset about this. But FDR worried that if got on the radio and said ""We need to go to war to defend the Philippines from Japan,"" the public would resist sacrificing American lives for Asian territory and Asian peoples. To this day, the war in the Pacific is always the secondary theater once the story of Pearl Harbor is out of the way. 

I guess what I mean to say is while I think it was certainly a defensive war in the Pacific, there was a surprising amount of spin involved in convincing the American people of this. If for no other reason than the administration thought such spin was necessary."

And when the soldiers themselves attempted to correct government spin on the war, they were treated with grave contempt. There were a lot of brave soldiers that stood up for their truth in the face of what seemed like universal disgust. And they still don't get the credit for it.

OldSchoolCool,fdno94y,t1_fdnmmos,1578589843.0,"For one thing I think WW2 was a lot easier for Americans to understand. The war in the pacific was spun as a defensive war after the Japanese attacked Hawaii (which wasn't a state of the US, but was a territory), and the Hawaii attack led a lot of people to believe that the Japanese might conceivably attack the west coast. People tend to be much more supportive of and willing to join wars when they have a clear defensive purpose. Tolstoy talks about that with Russia's defeat of Napoleon, despite the country's earlier inability to beat him when they were fighting him in Austria. 

As for the European front, although there was sentiment in the states that the Nazi conquest was none of our business, it was definitely more compelling to defend France and Britain from the Nazis than to defend South Vietnam from North Vietnam. Especially because by the time of Pearl Harbor, the Germans had been controlling most of Europe for almost 4 years and it was wreaking havoc."
OldSchoolCool,fdnngfn,t1_fdnm5kk,1578589442.0,"I agree about the treatment of veterans, that was a disgrace. 

But to characterize the entire anti-war movement as being the same people as the soldier-spitters is incorrect, though Nixon certainly enjoyed making that characterization. 

The anti-war movement became more popular as time when on. And when Nixon won in 1968, he promised he would end the war. As you say, even the Silent Majority wanted the war over, and even if they didn't go marching in the street they were willing to vote for those who seemed unlikely to prolong it. 

The 1969 moratorium demonstrated that, despite what conservatives wanted to believe, resistance to the war wasn't just coming from pothead hippies who would rather stare at their navels than defend their freedom. Nixon led the way for conservatives to characterize the war as a mistake created by Democrats, but which would solved honorably by Republicans. Except, in reality, Nixon purposely extended the war to keep it a viable election issue in 1968 and 1972. Yay patriotism. 

And they are not ""so incredibly different."" They started differently for sure - Americans had no idea what we were doing in Vietnam in the first place, because our involvement began almost secretly due to our paranoid fear of allowing the Vietnamese to govern themselves following French withdrawal. It was only once enough Americans were getting killed and maimed that the government started telling people we were there to stop communism and make the world safe for freedom. 

In Iraq and Afghanistan, both wars' commencements were generally popular (less so with Iraq, but still generally supported) because they were portrayed as revenge for 9/11 and as a proactive measure to prevent another 9/11. As the bodies piled up and people started to realize the futility of our colonial adventure, the same tactics were used by those who didn't want to end the war in a manner humiliating to the US - that it was our patriotic duty to bring democracy to these people, that pulling out would be a sign to the enemies of freedom everywhere that the US doesn't keep its commitments, and that those who disagree with the war are soft spoiled liberals who think you can get by in this world with flowers and compromises, and who secretly hate American greatness. 

In both situations America deluded itself into thinking it was more powerful than it was, and then when some Americans called the situation out, they were accused of being the reason America wasn't strong enough to win. Incredibly not different."

And even when anti-war protesters said the government was lying, the response tended to be ""Well, they can't tell us the whole truth, it would put our troops in danger.""

It wasn't until later that the full scale of bipartisan government fraud came to light. And at that point there was a lot more disillusionment. People realized that the government might be willing to prolong a war and sacrifice American lives in order to help the careers of individual politicians just as easily as they would do so to protect American security - though they will always claim the latter as their real justification. 

The funny thing is, by the early 2000's this lesson had either been lost or we made the mistake that everyone makes when they let history repeat itself - we saw the parallels but said ""This time we will do better.""

TwoXChromosomes,fdniqbt,t3_em7ox3,1578586650.0,"Dude here. I hated the phone number nonsense, and was frankly glad to get a fake number except that it was cause for harsh criticism from my peers, which criticism I was very sensitive to as a young teenager.

When I was a freshmen / sophomore in high school (would have been about 2002-2003), ""getting a girl's digits"" was a major status symbol. At this time, our activities on weekends or weekday evenings consisted of getting dropped off at malls or shopping / dining complexes and just hanging out until we got picked up. There would be all guy groups and all girl groups, with an occasional mix thereof.

When in an all-guy group, one of the top activities was competing with each other over who was ""better with girls."" It was during this period in my life that I was introduced to the destructive psuedo-science of ""game.""

At this point, this was done by managing to start a conversation with a girl or group of girls, and attempting to secure a phone number so that you could later possibly get a date. It almost never worked, but each failure was treated as a slap in the face of one's masculinity.

A few times I was called a pussy and a f\*g enough by older guys so that I gave in and approached a random strange girl and just straight up explained the situation to her and asked for her number. The problem, sometimes, with this was the girl would understand by my explanation and by the general demeanor of my nearby ""friends"" that the real point of this exercise was to bully, and would sometimes join in by demonstratively indicating her disgust at having been forced to interact with such a loser. Everyone wants to fit in. Sometimes they would give a fake number - and for that I was quite grateful.

Being able to drive myself started me on the path of no longer being trapped in malls and shopping centers with guys who I, being an idiot, wanted to impress, and who were only interested in amusing themselves by humiliating me.

The fact that people are apparently, on their own, going up to woman nowadays in 2020, and attempting to wring those digits out, is mind boggling to me. Do they have friends they report back to, triumphantly declaring ""Got some digits today""? Or do they genuinely enjoy creating awkward situations?

I wonder if they were the bullied or the bullies back in the day. I think either one can grow up to be a misogynistic piece of trash. For me, I had a lot of rage against both guys and girls by the time I went to college - especially if they appeared to be ""cool.""

But eventually I came to realize that if I were a girl and people kept coming up to me unsolicited and asking me for things, demanding my attention, attempting to bully me into hanging out, accusing me of being a trashy skank if I refused, that I would probably be relatively unsympathetic and wary of any guy who affirmatively comes up to me and asks me for my number within 15 seconds of the start of the conversation.

Eventually I realized that those masculinity-baiting bullies were the enemies of both of us. And that, to me, is why the concept of toxic masculinity is indisputable and is an idea whose time has come. And when I hear dudes throwing fits about how effeminate, irrational and ""anti-men"" it is to even use the phrase ""toxic masculinity,"" I have a pretty good idea of who they used  to be in high school. And who they still are."

I am, however, rejecting any concern for the government of Iran's moral outrage. Their outrage is either intentionally manufactured or demonstrates a shocking lack of self awareness. It was ad hominem openly and intentionally. It was certainly not a failed one - the only reason I  can see that you described it as such is that ""a failed _____"" is pretty much a standard boilerplate online. It makes me cringe. 

And who benefits is Donald Trump's ego and Saudi Arabia. I think Trump found out this guy was hanging out in Baghdad during unrest that had a big anti-American flavor and Trump took it as a slap in the face. I think that's why he ordered the killing. Because Trump has the mind of an adolescent boy who just got done watching an action film. 

Saudi Arabia benefits in their cold war with Iran. Trump probably likes that too, because now that murderous journalist-dicing Prince Salman will call him up and give him compliments.  And maybe give some juicy construction contracts to Trump's companies and those of his associates. 

And as for whether Iran's leadership deserves to be assassinated for exporting the Islamic Revolution - no that's certainly not what I meant. I meant to say that they have their own aggressive program of subordinating the various powers in the region to their own ambitions, and so they can hardly condemn others for doing the same thing. 

The best argument they have - and its a good one - is that if anyone should be breaking international law, the rules of ethics, UN Resolutions, historical precedents, etc., in order to impose their unchecked dominance onto the Middle East, it ought to at least be a local power that has some understanding of how the people expect to live. On that scale, Iran wins over the U.S. 

But Saudi Arabia and her allies don't want a Shiite revolution taking over the place and ""defiling"" the holy land. And they have an ally in the White House who thinks he's playing a video game. So here we are."

However, Iran and its leadership has been on that very same level for some 40+ years now. I'll shed no tears for them as they attempt to export their theocratic-nationalist revolution throughout the Muslim world. UN Resolutions and international law are, to a state like Iran's, sacred when agreeable and the tools of a nefarious international conspiracy to destroy your country's greatness if disagreeable.

You're just mad that we have someone like you usually have.

AskReddit,fddv6c5,t3_ekv97b,1578324766.0,"Not really right now. We have been closer to it in the past. 

What does worry me is the jingoistic attitude being displayed by Trump supporters in response to concerns about war. Their usual routine of condemning as deranged, hysterical and effeminate anyone who criticizes Trump's decisions is even more reprehensible than usual when unilateral actions in the direction of starting a war is now something No True Patriot would ever criticize or think twice about. 

This attitude demonstrates to Trump that he still has a blank check from his supporters to do whatever he wants. And because his supporters are still numerous enough that his re-election is probable, we could start to see Trump on a literal warpath. 

Trump, however, can be fairly unpredictable (unlike his supporters), and who knows - he may come out in a week and say that he and Iran are best buds now and all the drama from before has been hashed out. And Trump won't take any criticism for it, except for from the Democrats and Trump's GOP considers Democrat criticism to be an unmistakable sign that your policies are good. Trump's supporters are currently split between supporting Trump's decision because they believe he's using this to ""get a better deal"" from Iran and that it won't lead to war, and supporting Trump's decision because they think it will lead to war and that is good, because its finally time that Real American Strength be unloaded on these desert barbarians. They will support whatever happens under his leadership and rewire their memories to convince themselves that they always wanted whatever he does to happen. 

TLDR: I am not worried about imminent WW3, but Trumpist response to the assassination (even using that word triggers them) demonstrates his unquestioned power within an increasingly monolithic and totalitarian GOP. And that worries me more."
