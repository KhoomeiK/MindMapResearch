SkincareAddiction,ffa7xjs,t1_ff9dzjo,1579729626.0,"Oh awesome, an expert to help me understand the study. If possible, I have a few questions. Why do they experiment on rats if the results only apply to the same species? Do they know exactly what it was in the untreated mineral oil causing arthritis? From your comment I thought maybe you thought carcinogens were the culprit, did I misunderstand you? If not, do you think it is best to er on the side of caution or would you keep using it? 

I’m no scientist but a scientist I know was studying arthritis and when I asked him how he gave his rats arthritis he said mineral oil. I don’t know what type he used unfortunately but he did warn me against all types. He said that one thing he found was that the majority of arthritis sufferers were women. We have long thought that because of this, it must be some sort of hormonal thing causing it, but his theory was that it was the mineral oil they used, as you described, baby oil and such. He was the one who told me not to use mineral oil products. The study was cut short by the ethics committee because of the treatment of rats so there isn’t anything published on it (thus my reluctance to write about it earlier). 

I guess for me personally, having spoken to a scientist about this and having been warned against all mineral oil skin products, I won’t be purchasing any. There are enough correlations for me to not want to take that risk with the only body I will ever have. Having said this, I’m always looking for more information on this so I’m looking forward to hearing more of your thoughts."
SkincareAddiction,ffa49y0,t1_ff97rj2,1579727589.0,"Yes, I know it’s a good thing. I was adding it in case someone knew something I didn’t about quality of mineral oil. I’m pretty open minded about this one and am willing to be persuaded otherwise."

SkincareAddiction,ff7rnde,t1_ff7mwfd,1579656697.0,I think it’s been hard to prove because it takes arthritis a long time to develop in humans but they use mineral oil to give rats arthritis so that they can find a cure for it. https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/ar1824
SkincareAddiction,ff7k5y7,t1_ff7isun,1579651469.0,"Oh yeah, I don’t think she is lying, because she basically tells the truth about silicones. Just reading through her arguments they don’t sound that great to me, like saying that silicones don’t stop active ingredients penetrating the skin, they just stop the majority of them penetrating (just one example). She is super careful with her language. 

I agree with you about La Mer though. It has to be the biggest scam ever. They use mineral oil (highly refined I might add), which has been linked to arthritis in a study done here in Australia."

SkincareAddiction,ff7hqhp,t1_ff7fg0y,1579649825.0,"Dude, that post is sponsored by Grant Industries who sell silicones. She basically admits that it does limit the amount of actives getting through to the skin. She says it’s not completely occlusive. Which means that only some actives penetrate. They don’t moisturise, they prevent water from escaping. I don’t think they are terrible mind you and I’m not anti synthetics, I just don’t see many benefits to using them. Companies really do just use them because they are cheap, safe, and look like they have immediate effects."
SkincareAddiction,ff7e3o6,t1_ff6i7ux,1579647431.0,Why do people use products with silicone in them? While silicone isn’t damaging it is just a cheap way to bulk out a product and make it look like it’s making your skin better without actually doing anything.

news,fdc349q,t1_fd5ttem,1578266144.0,"This is a freak weather occurrence in the sense that it is unprecedented, but not in the sense that it won’t happen again when climate change progresses. It really has been a perfect storm. We haven’t been managing the land well. As another poster said, this land needs to be burnt. The land evolved alongside indigenous people. They used fire to control what plants grew where, so that they could also know which animals would be where when the sought out those plants. They did thousands of small burns during the cooler months to hunt (driving out wallabies with fire into a wall of spears for instance), knowing which holes lizards will be hiding in after a gentle fire passes through, also some plants won’t reshoot unless they are burnt. Different temperature fires encourage different plants to grow etc. They had this incredibly complicated and amazing system with knowledge of all the different plant and animal species and they helped to balance everything. This happened over the course of 60,000 years by the way, and they weren’t a great influence when the first started using fire as many species went extinct. But they got better. Anyway, the local fire brigades here in Aus are only now starting to use indigenous knowledge and we still have a long way to go, so we aren’t doing nearly enough cool burns which means that there are massive fuel loads come fire season. Couple this with the worst drought in history, our PM’s inexcusable attitude towards climate change and the increased temperatures and you get the perfect storm.

If you want to read more about indigenous fire practices, read Bill Gammage’s book [The Biggest Estate on Earth](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Biggest_Estate_on_Earth.html?id=aUddY9fGkNMC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button)"
news,fdc0egx,t1_fd6d8vv,1578264699.0,"Fire itself might not be a freak occurrence but this fire is. Indigenous fire practices like cool burns DO make a difference by the time fire season comes and are in no way as widely practiced as they should be. If you have 70% more fuel to burn by the time fire season starts, of course the fire will be worse. But yes, having Tony Abbott screw up the carbon emissions scheme then voting in ScoMo has been a very bad thing."

askphilosophy,fc8fgxb,t1_fc7y2dl,1577533732.0,Being exposed to different points of view. Having people identify the weak spots in your arguments. You can still learn a lot on your own but you need to talk to people to really find out about your own views. This cannot be underestimated.
philosophy,fc7pmkf,t1_fc7mqwq,1577515312.0,"I think what you are saying is “we don’t have all of the answers now, but let’s help people with the things that can be helped in the meantime”. The problem with CFS is that when we are not agreeing on the type of problem we are dealing with, we aren’t even in agreement on what things can be helped. You mentioned exercise as one of the basics that should be good for all cases. For many people with severe CFS, exercise (even a small amount) can put people in a pit that they can’t get out of for months or years. This is what happened with the PACE trials. Doctors thought that they were doing precisely what you said: mitigating symptoms with a treatment they took to be one of the basics of good health, applicable to all cases, whereas what they were doing is aggravating the illness. 

I’m not saying that there aren’t things that all people need that might improve life quality like, as you say, good sleep and good nutrition. Diagnosis for CFS is pretty thorough. If you have a bad diet you won’t get diagnosed with CFS until your symptoms prevail on a good diet. You also need to diary your behaviours. Most people with it also don’t sleep well so that is also another one that is used in the diagnosis of the problem itself.  Good sleep is probably the only one of your examples that holds true to your point because it is something that might be helped after the diagnosis is made (after the problem has been categorised). 

My concern is that it is not always clear, in the case of CFS, what will mitigate the problem and this is, to a large extent, caused by an ill defined problem in the first place."
philosophy,fc7m6f6,t1_fc7cpgn,1577511991.0,"The ethics helps raise awareness and funding. It’s not all simple abstract stuff like you learn in ethics 101. The problem of how we approach CFS patients is in part an ethical one. The hippocratic maxim to do no harm is, at base, ethical. The problem of misdiagnosis in the face of lack of evidence is an ethical issue. If more doctors were more ethical and intelligent people, people with CFS would not be suffering as much as they currently do."
philosophy,fc7kxtw,t1_fc7gvt6,1577510777.0,"I’m not sure your argument from analogy works here. In the case of CFS a huge part of he problem is disagreement on was sort of problem is being dealt with and thus what you can do to mitigate it. When patients feel their problem is their physical health but are treated like it’s their mental health, the consequences of trying to mitigate the wrong problem (mental) can be devastating to a person both emotionally and physically as is demonstrated by the failures of the PACE trials where patients were forced to do things that made their physical condition worse because of a belief that their problem was “all in their heads”."

I get a plate out of the cupboard they say “that’s not a plate to eat x off of”, I grab a tea towel to help dry the dishes, “that’s the wrong tea towel for evening dishes”. My grandfather won’t turn the heating on for my nana in winter but will turn it on and bring his tomato plants in to warm them up. A few weeks ago, I bought a bottle of champagne and put it in the fridge. Hours later I was doing the dishes and saw my bottle on champers on the back lawn. Mum and I looked at each other and I said to just leave it. In the morning my grandpa brings in the champagne and is excited by how much money he saved cooking it down outside overnight. I love them to death but man it’s painful sometimes."
