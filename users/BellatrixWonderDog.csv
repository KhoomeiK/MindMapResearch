TakeaPlantLeaveaPlant,fezuq3y,t3_ejhx4k,1579461907.0,"Located in PA, newish to the wonderful world of plant keeping so I'm pretty much interested in everything ðŸ˜‚ But specifically really want a string of pearls, Boston fern, seeds of any type, air plants, rubber tree, prayer plants, zz plant, peace lily, and pothos. I don't have much to trade. Preferably looking to buy small plants/cuttings/seeds as I don't have the money for a large established plant. Thanks!"
plants,feynhrt,t1_fevzyv8,1579447978.0,"Thank you, I'll do that!"
dogs,few0b27,t1_fevp7dh,1579403648.0,"Yes, so well worded!"
dogs,fevhmac,t3_eqoy0z,1579397569.0,"I feel like there are SOOOOO many breeds out there that there is something perfect for almost everyone (Personality, energy, etc, wise) That there's no reason to work on toning down a breed simply because someone wants, for example, the look of a Husky but not any of the other breed traits."
service_dogs,feuolz8,t3_eqnjl1,1579388523.0,"It sounds like you have a puppy! If it's a good organization they will listen to your concerns and help you work through them, so make sure you bring this stuff up.

Some puppies find the yelp or ""Ouch"" after they bite to be exciting and it rewards the game. The method I prefer is when the puppy bites, to get up, cross your arms, stand like a statue and pretend the dog doesn't exist. Another option is to completely leave the room. This ruins the fun of the game.

Make sure he's getting plenty of age appropriate physical and mental stimulation. A tired puppy is a good puppy.

Try the umbilical cord potty training method.

Good luck!"
Dogtraining,fet87tt,t1_fet5eew,1579372661.0,"I think what you're talking about is a Therapy Dog, not a Service Dog. Service Dogs are trained in specific tasks or work to mitigate the disability/s of their handler. Therapy Dogs are trained to go to nursing homes, hospitals, etc to bring comfort to people."
Dogtraining,feovw15,t1_feof571,1579306539.0,"Hey there, as a small Service Dog handler let me answer this question for you. The tasks you're speaking of are simply the tip of the iceberg, dogs are amazing creatures capable of amazing things!

A Service Dog is a dog that is trained in tasks and or work to mitigate their handler's disability (Or multiple disabilities) Small dogs are able to do many things that big dogs can do, for example... Retrieving items for someone who can't, alert to medical or psychiatric episodes (Seizures, heart rate, blood sugar, anxiety attacks, migraines, etc) turn on lights with a foot pedal, inturrupt behaviors, attract or search for help during a medical or psychiatric event, provide halucination discernment, find and lead handler to a location like a chair or exit during a medical or psychiatric event, carry items, locate trusted people and bring them to handler during a med/psych event, remind handler to take medication, take off shoes and socks, alert a person with hearing issues to sounds, do room or house search for someone with PTSD, and more.

There are pros and cons to both small and large Service Dogs. For some, small Service Dogs are a better choice, they tend to cost less (Need less food) are more inconspicuous, fit in places large dogs may struggle, etc. They also may be easier to handle during training for someone with physical disabilities. (Example: Person with poor balance training a Great Dane who wants to pull)

Small dogs can do many amazing things you'd never think of and can be valid Service Dogs."
dogs,feoos2n,t3_eq70b3,1579303233.0,"I think most owners just go ""A dog's going to be a dog"" when it comes to everything. They also don't bother to learn canine body language so they don't see inappropriate play.

I used to love the dog park near my house, but I'm unable to go there anymore. I had a bunch of large dogs gang up on my small dog trying to play with her more like a chew toy then a dog. When my dog clearly gave signs of ""Okay guys, too much, chill"" The dogs, nor their owners, listened.

At another dog park I've gone to in ONE DAY. I saw...

1. A child, no adult in sight, who brought a large lad to the dog park. Put it in the small dog side and then left to go play.

2. The same dog preceeded to dig at all the water dishes people had set out, splashing people. 

3. A dog that humped other dogs constantly, the owner would eventually stop the behavior, but didn't leave the park so the dog just kept going back to it.

4. About 90% of the people there didn't pick up after their dogs

5. Some not great play behavior

6. A super young puppy that definitely shouldn't have been there"
Dogtraining,fe6g2kz,t3_envf9v,1578889821.0,"Have you tried REALLY high value treats? Find something he LOVES like some smelly cheese, freeze dried liver, fish, hot dog, peanut butter, etc. Only break out these treats when working on being silent when someone comes in.

Kikopup on YouTube has a few good videos on teaching a dog to stop barking."
plants,fe6eqh8,t3_enxwhm,1578888710.0,"Super cool, please update us how it does!"
Dogtraining,fe5edpv,t3_enu6qh,1578868347.0,"Is making your own treats a possibility? If I want something HIGH value I'll cut up some beef or chicken and cook it very briefly.

Try explaining the situation to some different treat companies and see if they'll send you some samples."
Dogtraining,fe09co2,t3_enhj2o,1578806721.0,"It sounds like you may be dealing with separation anxiety. I'd get in touch with a good veterinary behaviorist.

Good luck!"
Dogtraining,fe08ppz,t3_enikzw,1578806146.0,"Hey first thank you for adopting, second it's great you're looking into training! What you may be dealing with is called ""Leash reactivity"" Here's a good article to read about it and some things you can try: https://drsophiayin.com/blog/entry/reactive-dog-foundation-exercises-for-your-leash-reactive-dog/

Personally I wouldn't let him greet the other dogs. A dog that is extremely wound up is likely to not read the body language of the other dog which can lead to problems.

If you can, I highly suggest finding a good trainer and/or behaviourist to help you.

Good luck!"
Dogtraining,fdyzj80,t3_en884p,1578785185.0,"Sounds like you're getting some great advice and it's good you're doing your best to stop any possible problems! Only thing I would comment on is you say you ""Shut down any tiny hint of food aggression"" Please be careful with how you are doing this. It's best to ask a behaviourist before working with food aggression as it's something you can easily make MUCH worse.

Good luck with your two pups!"
Dogtraining,fdmmcaa,t3_em5ahn,1578555430.0,"I'd say you need to find a good behaviourist. Until then, with the gravity of the situation you're describing, I'd do crate and rotate until you speak with a behaviourist."
Dogtraining,fdi9es9,t3_elb7gn,1578438101.0,"Snuffle mats, treat toys, puzzles, ect. Age appropriate body awareness exercises would be a good start for agility. Also starting on (Again age appropriate) Agility skills like sit stays for start line.

Socialization is also very important at this age and can help with mental and physical stimulation. You can Google ""Dog exposure/socialization checklist"" Find new things everyday to expose your puppy to and make it a great experience. Different types of people with different types of clothes, puppy socialization classes, different places, umbrellas, skateboards, mirrors, statues, etc, etc, etc. 

There's LOTS of trick and obedience training you can do at this age too. Teaching loose leash walking, dependable recall, crate training, stay, heel, leave it, drop it, watch me, retrieve, bark, hand target, ring a bell, etc, etc, etc. Make a list of things you'd like to teach and double check with your vet that they are okay at this age.

Good luck!"
Dogtraining,fd7kdkl,t3_ek7rmc,1578205857.0,"First off thanks for rescueing him! Second go on YouTube and look up ""Train your dog to love being left alone"" it's a video by a channel called Kikopup. (She also has many other awesome training videos I highly recommend)

Second look into one of those dog monitor cameras. Just from a quick look it seems like they have some $30 ones on Amazon. This way you can monitor how he does while you're away and hear if he's barking. Or if you've got a neighbor you trust you can also explain the situation and have them contact you to let you know how he does.

Next make sure he gets TONS of exercise before you put him in the crate and leave. A tired dog is a good dog. This can help to prevent barking/whining that stems from bordem.

As you said leaving him with a treat filled Kong is a great idea! If you'd like it to last even longer fill it with wet food, peanut butter, and/or yogurt and freeze it. Take it out of the freezer and give it to him right before you leave. If he's not interested in the Kong try something higher value for him. 

There are also many other interactive treat toys out there like the Kong if you'd like to give him even more things to keep him busy while you're gone.

Hope everything goes well for you and him!"
dogs,fd5dnsp,t3_ek3d9x,1578176617.0,"Sounds interesting! As you mentioned hygiene would be my only concern. I'd make sure you come up with a good toy sanitization method everyone should follow.

Let me know if you expand this online as I'd be interested!

If it doesn't workout you can always do a ""Toy rotation"" at home. This is what I currently do, I leave about 4-6 toys out at a time and store the rest in a bin, about every month I swap out the toys with the ones that have been stored. This way she gets exciting ""New"" toys every month"

dogs,fczh206,t1_fcybm66,1578101087.0,"Stores that sell or prepare food are not allowed to permit pets.

Along with that Service Animals go through tons of training, they must be potty trained, task or work trained, non aggressive, and under control. Who's to say the pet someone brings in won't go to the bathroom on the floor? Who's to say the pet won't bite someone?

Not to even mention people's pets interfering (Or even badly injuring) a Service Animal."
dogs,fcwm7aj,t3_ej93p4,1578029560.0,"So sorry you, your fiancÃ©, and her are having to go through this. Keep in mind that she gets to spend her final time in a loving home like she deserves, thanks to you rescuing her. She got to snuggle, go on walks, and ride in the car which is probably the best final weeks a dog could ask for.

The lose of a beloved pet is never easy but it will be a little less painful with time. You are making the right decision for her."
