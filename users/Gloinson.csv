No. It wasn't. Soviet Union opened war against Japan on three fronts (with 89 divisions: 1.5 million men and 3700 tanks) on August, 9th, which led to the previously unthinkable discussion of surrender at the Supreme Council on that day. The Nagasaki bomb fell during that meeting, Hiroshima was already three days old news nobody had reacted to.

Japan had delayed reaction to the Potsdam declaration (demanding unconditional surrender) on July 26th because they counted on the SU no entering into the war. They got their answer, they knew they had lost."

Read in exactly that context there will be a time when everybody regrets having had this children, even if he might regretting having thought that the very next moment."
photography,ff5pyjg,t1_ff5hurx,1579605400.0,"Self-documentation works mostly only in rigid scientific environments for those purposes. Journalists show a story from another, more detached angle than the concerned person. 

Journalists can, of course, have an agenda and publicize propaganda too and I never heard or read a lot of people saying said that this would be totally OK. But it is still a league away from the military telling the stories on its own, glossing over all the bad parts and embellishing the good ones. Which is what embedded journalists or dedicated service men are meant to do."

Around 2010 they started sublingual treatments and other variations that weren't available for my allergy. Make that two times \~150 injections and half an hour supervision, please ;)"

>I realise it holds some risk and probably only should be done in the presence of a doctor.  But I do wonder if it would be possible to basically fix these allergies in adults.

  
Desensibilisation works about 75% of the time (too lazy to find the study now) of the time and has to be done for 2-3 years weekly. That might not be an option for a all people. (I did it twice, yay for a mandatory and social health insurance in Germany).  


But: even then it is a desensibilisation, not a 'cure'. So people highly allergic to something will avoid their thing after a treatement nevertheless. For me it was down to sneezing attacks during high allergy season after the first treatment but still enough of a bother that I took cetirizine during that month."

It turned turned out to be a severe stomach flu right on time after they released me after the tests in the hospital, as they keep you in the bed until they are sure everything is ok.  


(I was really embarrassed, but the paramedic kept telling me that they rather are called 9 times in error for an infarction than the 10th time too late.)  


Don't know Spaghetti-Os but I wouldn't eat our tinned ravioli for a week in exchange. The pain is forgotten after your stomach calms down, the bad aftertaste lingers for hours after every meal."

Yeah, avoiding ice is travellers 101. Learned that before."
