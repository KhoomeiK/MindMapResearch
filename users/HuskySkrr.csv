WorldofTanks,ff88xby,t3_es3zu3,1579669455.0,"this comes from a guy thats just meeting the tank in battle and didn't play it:

It seems really over-powered tank from my point of view. the gun on top of the tank, the amazing depression,the armor angles that are in favor of wot shell mechanics,440 alpha, good camo (I think, couldn't spot him shooting me from 150 metters)mobility seems allright.

to pen the turret is almost impossible and if you use the suspension good, you won't even have to show your weak lover plate to anyone.

what are the negatives of it from someone who played it?"

I haven't seen ONE guy who had a bad stats with it. yes it's most played by the best players, but it doesn't make the tank anytime worse, you have ZERO weakspots for non'premium ammunition  and you have to have a good Penetration on Gold ammo to fight this tank.

This is against mechanics of the game. there shouldn't be a tank like that. that means that guy has to sacrifice ATLEAST 30,000+ credits  for premium ammunition to just destroy ONE tank. there is no counter play other than  pressing the 2 key and shooting you credits away, or relly on team that they will flank them somehow (but can you really relly on your team tho?)
