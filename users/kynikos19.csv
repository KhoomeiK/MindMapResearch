Do we live with an illusion of consequence, yes. The rich get away with a lot. But some people paid eventually. And that is important that we have some system and some faith in the system.

worldnews,ffc2s4u,t1_ffc0yih,1579790108.0,Obviously you know nothing about child sexual abuse. In very few cases is it “forcible” rape. Children are easily groomed and don’t typically fight or refuse their abusers. That doesn’t mean that it is ok. A 10 year old cannot consent. And the fact that they say they wanted it does not make it ok. And in the US the person is going to jail. Whether or not the 10 year old says they consented. That is the difference.

People making the law and people defending the law have no legal or higher moral ground. And if that includes the ordinary Turks then I guess they are included in that too.

Nice try with the gas lighting. I mean I will admit, you’re talented. First of course you’re obviously not trying to make it a race issue, you attempt to state an opinion can’t be valid because it is not from near you, double down on the “we’re still not as bad”, then I’m emotional because you’ve run out of arguments, then I must be making it a race issue therefore I can’t be disregarded.

Just like any other relationship, there are few things you can do just once to truly destroy a relationship or in the case of a child completely ruin the child’s life. So keep caring about doing a good job because it’s important that you care but don’t worry so much, if you care you’re probably doing a decent job.

Look one moment or one comment isn’t going to define your relationship. What people who have been raised with bad parents don’t realize is that yes the bad parent called them dumb. But they also didn’t praise and encourage them and show them unconditional love and support. If one moment defined any relationship, none of us would have any relationships. Don’t worry about it too much. The 50,000 other things you have done to show you care are more important. And I can guess you care by the fact that you bothered to ask a bunch of strangers whether you messed up."

Which would be fine if the taxi industry wasnt dying right now? None of them have any respect for their mother. The other family’s child won’t speak or see her father. And the last set refuse to have anything to do with the rest of the extended family.
