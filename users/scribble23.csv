nottheonion,ff33ehb,t1_ff31etr,1579532656.0,"I worked for the UK Civil Service at one point and used to get infuriated at colleagues' refusal to perform simple, quick tasks that weren't technically part of their specific role. 'That's a Band C role, not Band D', 'Why did you send the form yourself, that's for us Band Bs to fill and check, you should have passed it to us!' and so on. When I replied that it only took a minute a d I was actually trying to avoid interrupting them and adding a half hour appointment onto their day when I could just do it myself in two minutes, they'd get really, really shirty with me. I soon realised that if everyone did what I was doing, the task would be dumped on everyone at my grade during the next 'Efficiency' review - and the other band of staff would be made redundant or their temporary contracts not renewed. This was nonsensical as we were so understaffed anyway, but this is exactly what would and did happen regularly. Also if you're known for mucking in happily and doing extra work without complaining, everything will get dumped on you automatically. So I started sticking to the exact job I was contracted to do. No more, no less."

With maybe your children also living there, while you try to hold down the job you need to pay the mortgage and bills? Difficult when granny doesn't know the difference between day and night, wakes 24/7 and tries to escape when not sticking things in plug sockets/leaves the hob on/wanders out half dressed leaving the door open/phones 999 constantly crying she's been kidnapped/soils herself continually... When carers don't turn up or only have a few minutes allocated then leave again. Hard to stay in work and not endanger everyone in the household with all that going on, not to mention how distressing and depressing it is for the entire household. You could give up work and claim £66.15 a week carers allowance I suppose."
unitedkingdom,ff2vkb3,t1_fez18os,1579525820.0,What if their children are themselves elderly and have their own health problems. My parents needed carers of their own by the time my grandmother went into a care home. Her needs were such that even if her kids were fit and well they could never deal with her properly 24/7 anyway.

tifu,fex93em,t1_fewlesh,1579427081.0,"My sister had to have her ovary and fallopian tube removed last week because of this. In her case it was a cyst that caused it to twist. She'd been to her GP a couple of weeks before saying she'd had abdominal pain for a week but it wasn't sever at that point. So he referred her for a scan in two weeks and took bloods etc. to see if it was reproductive, digestive or something else. It's hard to diagnose before it gets severe, even then the pain could be many things. Last week my sister got much worse overnight and ended up having a scan via A&E which showed the problem. No amount of morphine was helping at all by that stage."

I tried to avoid the GP surgery but then I ended up developing into tonsillitis and a nasty ear infection, because coughing my guts up just wasn't fun  enough... Both my kids have had the same too, so we've taken seven different types of antibiotics between us. Of course, being kids, they bounced back within 24 hours of starting treatment - whereas I have been dragging myself around forlornly for weeks.

And the one I eventually stuck with cleared my skin completely, improved my mood and sanity and I lost 40lbs taking it. You can see why I stuck with it and cried when my GP said I was too old to be on the combined pill any more! My best friend went from perfectly sane to nasty, delusional and suicidal within weeks in one type. A colleague died of a blood clot from the pill.

His nursery taught nursery rhymes with signing too. He very rarely cried or got frustrated as a toddler because he could communicate what he needed even if he couldn't say the word yet. He hit all the relevant milestones and once he was talking fluently he didn't need the signs any more so he stopped. Just asked him (he's 14 now) and he doesn't remember a single sign now.
