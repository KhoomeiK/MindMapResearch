They were pretty much in every single game until it ended and had a ton of injuries too. If anything, they just need a new GM."

Edit: I'm really not trying to be a dick here. I'm sorry if it's coming across that way. But come on, ""chunky"" literally means you have some extra stuff going on."

Naturewasmetal,ff3753s,t1_ff2quqv,1579535286.0,"The aquatic dinosaur theory is way out of date at this point. As others mentioned, dinosaur bones are constructed similarly to the bones of their relatives, the birds, with many hollow spaces in them. This drastically reduces their weight. On another level, many people tend to underestimate how effectively a long tail can serve as a counterbalance to the weight of a dinosaur's torso. Look at modern diagrams of T-Rex anatomy: they all show the Rex with head extended forward and tail extended out behind it for balance. For example, some of the smaller anatomical details from Jurassic Park are incorrect, but the basic posture of the T-Rex is mostly correct."

He's clearly a little off in the head - not aggressive at all, but you can just tell by the way he was rambling and not getting the hint to move on with his life and leave this poor girl alone. Anyway, I basically eavesdropped on this entire conversation until the guy finally left just in case it got to a point where someone needed to step in.

As someone who found Supernatural on Netflix and binge-watched the first 8 seasons, I was really disappointed that the show didn't seem to be heading towards any sort of resolution.
