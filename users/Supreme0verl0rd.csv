AskReddit,ffdt4lc,t1_ffdfxqk,1579828265.0,"I'm in my 40's (closer to being a boomer than you). My household income is in the 82nd percentile for the US and significantly higher for my state. I have precisely two student loan payments left to make. My dad bagged groceries and my mom worked at a Things Remembered store in the mall. I've worked hard to do  better financially than my parents. I'm not rich and I don't equate money with happiness, but I am financially comfortable. I tell you this not to humblebrag but only to set the stage that I'm far from a bum. 
   
I support Bernie because my political and societal aspirations tend more towards 'let's help others be successful' than 'don't take my shit' and I recognize that the institutions and embedded imbalances make it very difficult for some socioeconomic classes to get ahead without help.   
   
So no, not all ""Bernie Bros"" are looking for a handout. I'm looking to give a hand-up."
