dogs,ff33ud5,t3_ere9v3,1579532988.0,"Our pup has a similar issue. According to the vet, it can be one of many things or even a combination of things. Could be a little anxiety, especially if he's doing it while you're not around. Could be a skin condition, maybe he has an allergic reaction to something inside or outside and his lil paws are itchy. Could just be that he's a little neurotic and needs stimulation. For the rug, it could be one of these or there was food on the rug one time and now it tastes/smells like food. Could also be that he knows humans at the table mean food so maybe I can get food here, ""hey guys I'm ready look gimme food!"" 


We use bitter apple spray on our dog's paws as well as anywhere he fixates and licks for extended periods. He hates it so much that we don't have to spray him often anymore. We also got a spray from the vet, it's supposed to calm the itch, I think it's a conditioner or something? 

Hopefully you can get to the bottom of this! Of not, talk to a vet, especially if it's getting worse or he's licking his paws bare. Good luck!"

Dogtraining,fcr4bp2,t3_eij3po,1577896590.0,"Have you tried establishing it as a command? We use ""cookie night night"" as our dog's signal for time to go in the crate. Of course, he gets a treat every time. 

Like any other command, you might have to ease into it. We found success with saying the command and giving the treat at first when he was already in the crate. Use high value treats so there's a stronger pull. Rewarding him even going near the crate on his own is also beneficial. 

Hope this helps!"
