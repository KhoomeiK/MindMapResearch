facepalm,felusm2,t1_felhyit,1579231461.0,"So, you bring up a very interesting point.

 In a free market, every dollar you spend is a ""vote"" for the success of the company you spend your money with.

Let's say there were two coffee shops. Coffee shop A, and B.

If coffee shop A provides a better quality product than B then they will sell more coffee. If they take some of those funds and use it to further improve their products they will continue to grow.

Now coffee shop B on the other hand sells coffee for less, but it's not as high quality. Some people will still buy from coffee shop B because of the price point, but they wont grow to the same extent. Both coffee shops are allowed to be in business and sell their product. They have to charge a fair price for the product they provide, based on supply and demand. Because coffee shop B sells a lower quality coffee, they charge less than A. This a free market.

Now let's say the government comes along and says instead of spending your money at either coffee shop, you give us your money and we will provide you with ""free"" coffee every day. 

The government decides to back coffee shop B, because there product is cheaper. Because it seems ""free"" everyone starts going to coffee shop B and A goes out of business.

Now, coffee shop B has no competition and realizes they can set the price of their coffee to whatever they want because the government is laying for it, not the consumer. So they double their prices and serve an even lower quality coffee. Their profit margins apar through the roof, and the consumer suffers. 

As their prices have increased, the government requires a higher tax in order to continue providing ""free"" coffee.

This is what so often happens with socialist healthcare systems. I come from a country with free healthcare. The service is atrocious. People die in the ER all the time waiting in line. There are other hospitals which charge a fair price, but no one uses them because the government already provides ""free healthcare"". The lines are full of people who dont work and pay nothing in taxes because if they get a job they lose their government benefits
 This harms everyone.

I  Do advocate paying taxes for things like infrastructure, e.g. roads, public schooling, public parks etc.. but when the government wants to take my money and fund a company with it, destroying my ability to choose a provider, I have a problem with that.

In the case of donations, there will always be two sides. Not everyone will support the same organizations, but as people in America tend to have different opinions. 

People will donate, but they will also spend their money with the organizations they feel provide the service they're looking for. Their dollars spent is what creates a healthy economy.

This is admittedly an oversimplification of the issue. Their is a lot of nuances and social issues to consider, but the bottom line is the government is pretty bad at managing their (our money) and shouldn't be allowed to take away our voting power in who we choose to spend money with."

They somewhat do this already. 

In the last 3 years, I've donated over $100k to charitable causes that I've vetted and trust. At great personal all expense, obviously.

Because of this, I have been able to deduct from my income taxes and pay a little less. Not nearly as much as I've spent, but less.

I'd much rather give that money to the causes I believe in than to the a government that will spend it on war."
