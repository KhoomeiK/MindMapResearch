It infuriates me when some newbie goes to Hobby Lobby and gets a MAPP gas beadmaking kit and calls themselves a glass blower. No, you're not.

We followed her as best we could but we kept losing her in the many trees in our neighborhood. We put up signs and called friends to look for her, and to ask neighbors to keep their eyes peeled for her. It was getting chilly at night and we were so worried she'd freeze that evening, but we found her (and lost her again) a couple of times the next day. Tiny was gradually working her way across our quiet little town and edging closer to a more open, commercial area with busy highways, and with the weather turning colder every night, we knew our time was running out.

She spent another night in the cold, and we were heartbroken that she had moved again before we were able to get to her last known location. We spent most of the third day not knowing where she was; my friend Kristina was heartbroken but still trudging around the neighborhood calling and whistling. Late in the afternoon she finally heard her whistling back from high in a tree. Poor Tiny seemed really agitated and was flying around but didn't seem able to maneuver downward, and it was going to be getting dark soon. 

The two story house across the street had an attached single story garage and an unobstructed flight path, and the owners kindly allowed Kristina to go out on their garage roof with Tiny's (large!) cage. She called to Tiny, and after several abortive attempts, the poor thing flew right across the street and into her cage!!

Aside from being hungry and thirsty, Tiny was in excellent condition and lived for close to another ten years. And Kristina was vigilant about keeping her wings clipped after that!

As a scale it functioned really well, although it would need to have the batteries replaced every other month or so. I eventually contacted the company and inquired about it, and they told me that wasn't normal and to send it back for replacement, which I did. A couple of weeks later I got a package back from the company, but when I opened it I up, it was a tiny kitchen scale.

I was confused, because I wasn't sure if they had sent me someone else's order, or if it was a gift for my trouble, or just a mixup with the model number that I should have received, so I called them. And the customer service person reamed me for not sending it back at my cost immediately and basically called me a thief and a criminal, and in fact was so unpleasant I was in tears when we hung up.

I immediately sent a response to their customer service email saying that I had never been so badly abused by what I had thought was a good and reputable company and that I no longer wanted my replacement scale, and that they could just send me a mailing label for the kitchen scale and my money back for the defective scale and we would be done. 

Long story short, I got an apology, a new bathroom scale, and kept the kitchen scale."

pagan,fcrr8ra,t3_eify3x,1577905534.0,"So, thirty-some years ago I was on Cozumel for vacation, and was wandering in the mercado looking for silver jewelry. I found one vendor that had a lot, and he had a shoebox sized bin of sterling silver charms, which I was particularly interested in as I'm always looking for charms for my charm bracelet. I found dozens of the typical sombreros and Mayan calendars, plus lots of fish and other beach/ocean themed charms; I set aside a few of those, but I'm always looking for something unusual, so I kept digging. 

I was almost finished rooting through the entire box when I stumbled across a toothy, dragon-y looking guy and was instantly intrigued, so I put him in my pile, too. When I finished looking and was totaling up my selections, I asked the vendor who it was, but he shrugged and said he didn't know. As we continued shopping I would ask the various shopkeepers if they could identify him, but nobody had any idea. Something about him seemed significant and it bothered the hell out of me that I didn't know who or what it was. 

We finally finished shopping and went in search of a place to grab lunch, and as we wandered down a quiet side street, I noticed a piece of paper in the middle of the sidewalk. What possessed me to stop and look at it, I don't know, but looking back at me was a likeness of my dragon guy! I picked it up, and evidently it was a little ""collectible"" card that would have come in a pack of gum or candy, and on the back it said his name was Quetzalcoatl and that he was a revered deity in Mesoamerica. üò±

I kept that card- it's still in my jewelry box all these years later- but I never did put that charm on my charm bracelet; instead, I put it on a chain and I wear it around my neck all the time. And that's how I was claimed by Quetzalcoatl. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

savannah,fcbl5sx,t3_egzxlz,1577588142.0,"Men's Wearhouse has had events in the past where they took donations of business attire for men and distributed it to underprivileged job seekers looking to re-enter the work force. Unfortunately, they don't do this year-round, and I have been unable to find another entity to take these types of donations. 

My husband has lost 50 pounds on the keto diet and I have a mountain of men's professional wear to get rid of, and I'll be damned if I'll give it to GW, so I hope someone will have some suggestions!"
witchcraft,fc7icl8,t3_eghvho,1577508340.0,"That's so awesome! 

My husband really surprised me this year- his son asked him for suggestions for a Christmas gift that he and his wife could give me, and he suggested books on gardening and Wicca! This was remarkable to me because I've never *ever* discussed my spirituality with him. Despite my interest in ""the occult"" and spirituality that goes back decades, I've never used my tarot cards or done anything remotely witchy in front of him; he's an atheist so I didn't think he'd care much one way or the other. But the best part was my daughter-in-law telling me that she was interested in Wicca as well, so I'm really looking forward to our discussing the book that they got for me!"
toastme,fc4kuei,t3_efvmmu,1577419626.0,"It takes some real strength to bare your soul like that, when you feel like you're as far down as it's possible to go. I think most of us have privately felt that despair, maybe even contemplated ending it all, but you opened up instead of closing off, and you should feel proud. Sending you love and positive energy."

I work hard on making sure she isn't shorted gift-wise, and have everything wrapped in birthday paper, not Christmas paper, but with all the hubbub around Christmas, I know it's difficult for anyone to avoid a mental and emotional spillover that eclipses a birthday. 

P.S. Her due date was the 15th, BTW- it's all her fault! üòÇüòò"

savannah,fbwpvzz,t3_eet4u0,1577156279.0,"We have been here for four years- moved here from upstate NY/PA to get away from the cold and cloudy weather and NY taxes. We really enjoy it- love the weather, the proximity to the ocean, the shopping and restaurants- and we are still learning more about the area all the time. If you are on FB I highly recommend following the local news outlets, and if you are interested in events (music, theater, comedy) and activities (kayaking, fishing, boating) Connect Savannah is awesome. 

I am an avid gardener and it has been an amazing experience seeing what gorgeous plants and flowers I I always loved and can now grow- gardenias, jasmine, ginger- and others I never knew I could grow (you can grow amaryllis down here like people up north grow daffodils!!). I could go on and on, but I'll leave it up to you to ask questions if you want to pick my brain. I wish you luck!"

Bonus fact: despite the confusion that evidently arises because it involves sound, it's vocal *cords*, not vocal *chords*.  Thank you."
