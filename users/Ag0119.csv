dogs,ffbpcjk,t3_eslwq0,1579777003.0,"Go so so so slow and be unendingly gentle.   You're new, your home is new, the rules are new...depending on her personality, the adjustment could be rough and scary.  I've also found that from an ""attachment"" side of things, it helps to describe the dog's future family when you talk to them.  First,  it helps you imagine them somewhere else and reminds you that this is a temporary arrangement.  Second, it keeps you focused on what kind of family your foster needs--activity level, do they gravitate toward kids, do they love to sun themselves in the backyard?  It makes you a better advocate for your foster dog!

Beyond that, it's all the normal ""new dog"" rules--2 week shutdown, limited access to home until they're trustworthy."

dogs,ff976nr,t1_ff8pmil,1579706440.0,"Bullies can be such excellent dogs, and they're so rarely considered right off the bat.  They love to be active and play and then at the end of the day, they want their head on your lap while they snore with their tongue out.  And as people pleasers, they're pretty trainable (but they can be stubborn!)."
dogs,ff96y2n,t3_es9k04,1579706286.0,"You're a great candidate for foster to adopt!  Most rescues/shelters give foster families first right of refusal for adoption.  Since your SO works from home and you have so few ""requirements"", you can work to find the RIGHT dog with trial periods.  So if you foster and it's not the right dog to  be your permanent, you try again.  (Don't worry!  It's easy to fall in love!)"
dogs,ff96ii2,t3_esd28e,1579706001.0,"Sometimes dogs just don't know what kind of noises they can make until they make them?  And then it's a really fun noise so they keep doing it.

dogs,ff969g9,t3_escg4d,1579705834.0,"Acclimation of the puppy continues.  He has learned in the last week that he can be in the bed WHENEVER HE WANTS.  It doesn't even have to be nighttime!  Want a nap?  Go to the bed. Too early?  Go to the bed.  Humans left?  Go to the bed.

I'm really pleased by it, since he's showing that he's becoming totally comfortable navigating our home and knows that he is trusted to hang out wherever he would like.  (It also means that his potty training is finally complete and we're no longer watching his every move, lol.)"

HOWEVER, you don't seem to be convinced of your readiness for a bully breed.  The fact is that if you are going to have a bully breed, even a pocket pittie, you have just become a breed ambassador.  I would recommend spending way more time with bullies in general and people who know them well before you consider taking one on.  

They have special social needs because ONE mistake -- and you no longer have a dog.  It doesn't even have to be a big mistake--teeth are not required and it could be something that if any other breed did, people would shrug it off.  It doesn't sound like you're ready for that level of responsibility."

Sometimes when people see things day in and day out, they don't notice subtle changes like weight gain and loss.  I would be wary of thinking there is any malice toward the dog.

dogs,fdn42qq,t3_em8x6t,1578576687.0,"In the situation you've just described, I usually just assume the parent is an idiot and direct instructions to their child--gently but firmly.  ""No petting today, sorry,"" or ""You can pet Fido in just a minute.  Please wait until he is done getting his nails trimmed.""  Kid will usually stop and wait patiently, or lose interest and wander away.  If the kid does anything else, the parent will typically call them away due to their behavior. If not, ""Please come get your child.   I do not want my dog to be handled right now.""

No one has a right to pet your dog, whether it's ""nice"" or not."

dogs,fdhut4i,t3_eldvww,1578430529.0,"1.  Just love your current dog the same amount.  Cuddles, snuggles.  Dogs aren't wolves--the ""pack"" instinct isn't the same.  Your dogs will settle on their own structure, given a little time, and it's your job to make sure that things stay relaxed and fair.   Your dog may not WANT to be ""top dog"" and that's totally cool.  Remember that they'll probably have different personalities, likes and dislikes, so you'll end up treating them as individuals regardless.
2.  As long as you're a little ways post amputation, you're fine.  There's a saying, ""God gave dogs 3 legs and a spare.""  We put our tripawd foster in a Kong harness with a handle and zhe was fine.  She still zooms around in her forever home and has a great time.  (Adopted by my brother.)  For a front'leg amputation, use a rear-attaching harness to provide something yo ""pull"" against.  Also, she may come up with some funny adaptations.  Mel struggles on steps, and goes down backwards for better balance.  You might need to put down runners on hardwood or tile floors--they're a little harder to manage on 3 legs.
3.  Just pick up the poop right away until you're sure the worms are gone.  You can also spray the grass with a little diluted bleach after pick up to make sure everything is dead.  This will not be good for your grass, but will prevent the transfer of worms.  If you do need to deworm, put the syringe all the way at the back of your dog's teeth.  Otherwise,  pup will spit it out, usually all over you.

Have fun!"

If you want, you can always stop feeding her out of a bowl, and have her ""hunt"" for her food after you leave.  Hide a puzzle toy somewhere in the apartment that she has to find and then work at.

It's like how you meet some people and immediately know somehow that this is your person.  Dogs can have that ""soulmate"" connection too.  You may need to let your love for the new puppy grow as you get to know them.

Not to mention that puppies don't always have established personalities yet, so it can be hard to feel like you really KNOW them."
