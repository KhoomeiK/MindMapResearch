todayilearned,ff7u4v7,t1_ff5yrjy,1579658419.0,Not my point at all. My point is BOTH PARENTS shouldn't be FORCED to work to support a family. The single-income household is a dream for most.
todayilearned,ff7ty5p,t1_ff5tcfw,1579658291.0,"The education and funding has not kept up with the ideal. Paying for enrichment activities to help kids progress shouldn't be a discussion, but it is. It gets cut time and again, but the school hours don't change. School hours appeal to the ideal, which includes kids doing activities, not the reality that many kids are excluded from activities due to financial status. And so high schoolers at left unsupervised, possibly feeling unwanted or uncared for, and that can breed trouble makin time."
TwoXChromosomes,ff5tkfh,t1_ff5fmtu,1579609725.0,"Right, but abortion is supposed to be decided on in the heat of the moment when the emergency happens and you feel like you're not ready for motherhood and you don't want to give up the life you're living so you quietly make an appointment and don't tell anyone ever. That's why women get guilt from it so often, because they make these decisions so quickly and don't realize the natural maternal nature they're giving up. Big /s

Planning ahead blows all those outdated ideas out of the water and normalizes abortion, and that's not okay to pro-lifers. Abortion needs to remain shameful, or else they can't shame people out of it.

You continue being a confident, mature woman, and you do what you think is best for your future."
todayilearned,ff5ov6r,t1_ff5iwa3,1579603843.0,"Not always. In some areas parents prefer to drop their kids off. My parents had to take me to the bus stop, we lived so far out (rural). Busses were a pain in town because they'd go door-to-door and not have a stop at, say, the end of the block. Having a schedule that coincides with the parent's means they can drop their kids off and reduce bus times."

askwomenadvice,ff46vwi,t3_erfmc7,1579556846.0,"A lot of people are saying, ""Just do something with the two of you!"" and that's a nice thought, but it ignores the real problem your wife is having. She's sad because she feels distant from her friends, and this was a really good opportunity for them to get together and have fun and show they care about her. Instead, they have plans a month ahead of time. Could that be true? Absolutely. Is the wife questioning if it's true because she's already feeling excluded? Very likely.

Unfortunately, I don't have advice to help with the birthday problem, but hopefully this helps narrow down the answers some."
asexuality,femmlki,t3_epsi62,1579262724.0,"Feeling this. Currently among my favorite shows are Adventure Time and Gravity Falls. Lots of world and plot, silliness and happiness, and any relationships are entirely romance/socially based which is really interesting to watch. They also try to teach some life lessons and set good examples for kids, and it makes it so much more realistic and relatable."
CrossStitch,fek36mb,t3_epl9bv,1579191635.0,"I use KG-Chart for Cross Stitch by Ikuta Software and Design Studio for creating/altering projects on the computer.

I use Cross Stitch Thread Organizer by Isegrim Stitches on my phone to track my thread and look up colors/substitutions.

Both cost money, but they're one-time purchases and they work well for me. KG-Chart has a 30-day Pro Version free trial (you can open projects on the free version, but altering, creating, and saving requires the pro version). Thread Organizer is a GODSEND for shopping and substitutions.

I'm curious to see what other people use!"
lgbt,feir1ah,t1_feidbv5,1579145046.0,"You're good :) I just wanted to clarify, for the future and for those with questions. I subscribe more to Satanic Temple, personally, but both have their merits and neither is better for any reason."
lgbt,feicmoy,t1_feib4nu,1579135383.0,"A quick Google search shows me that LeVay founded the Church of Satan, which includes the Satanic Bible.

""The Satanic Temple is a nontheistic religious group based in United States. The Temple is recognized as a church for the purposes of tax exemption, with chapters in 16 US states and 1 in Canada. The group uses Satanic imagery to promote egalitarianism, social justice, and the separation of church and state.""

The Church of Satan, meanwhile, has this to say: ""Founded on April 30, 1966 c.e. by Anton Szandor LaVey, we are the first above-ground organization in history openly dedicated to the acceptance of Man’s true nature—that of a carnal beast, living in a cosmos that is indifferent to our existence.""

I think you're Church of Satan, friend, not Satanic Temple.

Side note, because the Satanic Temple is an officially recognized church according to US and Canadian governments, it can be used legally for religious exemption. You are free to say you are a member of the Satanic Temple (no fee needed), which gives you full bodily autonomy as your religious right."

askwomenadvice,fed23zr,t3_eofl9g,1578994888.0,"My fiance worked nights for years, first at a department store then at a factory. He'd come home and go to bed right as I was going to work, then wake up between 3 and 5 so we could spend the day together. The weirdest part was when he went to first shift and I wasn't sleeping alone anymore.

Be aware, he's going to be tired, especially on Saturdays. If he falls asleep randomly, try to let him sleep. We'd go to family functions and fiance would pass out on the couch around 2 pm, but simply explaining that he'd been up over 24 hrs made everyone understand."

CrossStitch,fdw86u4,t1_fdvy1zg,1578756052.0,"I'll try, but I'm not the best at it. You don't double it over like sewing, it's a little different. Take one strand, put the ends together, and put *both ends* through the needle. You now have a loop on the far end. When you make your first stitch, don't pull tight and there will be a small loop in the back of the project. Thread your needle through the loop, and pull tight.

Basically, normally you'd have a tail to stitch over, but this version gives you a loop at the end instead.

Leave a few registers off the vents in the floor and you're good. *He neglected to put siding on the entire backside of a house once* and they noticed the registers, commented, and left.
