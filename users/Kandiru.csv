Qhira is obnoxious to play against. She just dots everyone up, dodges attacks, spins widly away and stuns you. Her spin move even seems to cancel Dva's Defence Matrix for no reason."

6 spells isn't very many for flavour and utility spells.

I kinda think warlocks should get their expanded spells as domain spells, and all sorcerer subclasses should get a 1 of each 1-5 as domain spells too."

If you move to a higher altitude, your body will sense the lower oxygen levels and produce more blood cells to compensate. This happens over weeks though, rather than being something you can sense conciously."

Netrunner,fc6r2za,t1_fc6j1ii,1577487324.0,"Corps can trash resources at will if the runner is tagged, but tag me decks are obviously designed to ignore this.

The old private security force dissuaded tag me, but it's a bit weak to put in most decks.

Maybe the corps should all get grey ops Events which do something weak at 0tags, but become nasty at a higher threshold. Not as powerful as closed accounts or scorched earth, but useful on 0 tags.

HB could be harnessing bioroids to spot the runner. Event, for the next runner turn making a run costs 1 Click extra, plus 1 Click per two tags. This would let you score 4 cost agenda very easily against a tagged runner."

Allowing patents for software without working source code in the patent is a joke though.

Copyright shouldn't need to last longer than patents, a book doesn't cost billions to write. I think authors should get some protection of their characters, but 100 years after their death seems too long."
