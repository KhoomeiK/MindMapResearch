Other than other tributes, he was not only capable, but also willing to contribute to the capitol's wealth. As a district 3 resident, Beetee's behavior shows that he is actually an adapted member of society. He is supposed to know about electricity and technology itself as this is what they mostly learn in school. Also, he did kill the other tributes with wire, didn't he? But he had the wire because it was put there to be used and the electric field was there because that's how the capitol holds them captured. 
Maybe they thought it was a more dangerous thing that Haymitch actively uses the limits that are put on the tributes for his own advantage."
mbti,feov6j0,t3_eq5caf,1579306122.0,"From NT female to NT female: I saw myself rationalize a complicated, frustrating relationship with the words ""but every relationship is somewhat frustrating, isn't it?"". I'm not saying that you can't have a good relationship with a person that is very different from you, but it really doesn't have to be complicated. Relationships are not meant to trigger wrath or impatience and love/affection sometimes just isn't enough for something that lasts. And to answer your question: It really depends more on how the person is/was socialized than on their type. Who are their friends and family, how are their other relationships like in general, what are their values, are they able to put themselves in another person's shoes, do they have any quirks, are they reflective...? Also keep in mind that nobody is 100% their type."

I'm not saying that nobody is able to, because there are extremely smart high school dropouts and really dumb university graduates, but 1) even if you're naturally gifted, you need lots of training and 2) it's also about your image.

Hungergames,fecwyfw,t3_eogd3x,1578987945.0,"Recently I read that research results support a hypothesis that says that the reason soccer is the most popular sports in the world is that a game's outcome has a very pleasant mixture of skill and chance. So I would like an arena that offers anyone a good chance by representing a broad selection of different climate zones in the world ordered from hot to cold from the inside to the outside where one half is dryer and the other half is wetter. This guarantees anyone to find an area they are experienced with. But of course, as the tributes haven't been to other places than Northern America and some areas simply more pleasant to live in as there is more food, more water etc, there will probably be a lot of movement. Moving between the zones will be realized with a tunnel system."

As you don't even know what field to switch to next, I think it's sensible to figure out exactly what makes you unhappy before you jump towards something else that might bear the same or other problems. I also changed careers completely, and I am really happy with that. But I knew what I wanted to do it and, more important, why. Changing itself hasn't made me unhappy ever since, but I also landed jobs that have much to do with my current field that I didn't like at all."

My bf used to be the same, but since I gave him a huge loud and angry wake-up call about me not having this as I'm not having children with a guy who will most definitely promote an unhealthy behavior for the rest of his short fat slobby life and leave me to be the one who cares about them because 10 minutes of cavorting will be too much for him he began to understand that his health is not only about him. He frequently asks me to go running with him and to show him how to prepare good healthy food. I'm not saying you should be as rude as I was, but probably you should make it absolutely clear to him that his behavior, especially the justifications, are a deal breaker.

relationships,fc9f6rq,t1_fc90huy,1577551781.0,"I think that many posts that say ""once a cheater always a cheater"" don't reflect the truth, maybe not even always their author's perception of the truth, but rather are meant to convince somebody to leave an unhealthy/toxic/abusive/whatever relationship.
Cheating in general deals with how serious people are with other people's boundaries, though. So if I was OK with my boyfriend kissing other women, it wouldn't be considered cheating if he did. For your boyfriend, what he told you what happened was that he had to recall that he had a girlfriend who would not tolerate him kissing other women. So he stopped. 
From what you told us, you do have a good relationship with him and are only worried about what other people have been saying about cheating. I think what they say is often narrow-minded, because people are actually able to change and learn. I think the people who they are saying this to often need to be convinced that their SOs have developed a behavior that is unlikely to change because they are getting away with it all the time. Saying ""cheaters gonna cheat""  is just easier than talking about complex social interactions, but if understood, both theses are probably going to have the same impact on the other person. So many people choose the easier path."
relationships,fc90g34,t3_egrev2,1577545029.0,"I cheated multiple times on my first boyfriend. It was just kissing, but cheating nonetheless. I don't think that our relationship could have been repaired, because the reason for me to cheat was actually that I wasn't happy with him and was looking for a reason to break up even though I loved him dearly. He cheated on me and I think he had a similar problem. ""Once a cheater always a cheater"" doesn't apply to me, but it did apply to the relationship I had with him. I just had to learn a huge deal about communication and boundaries. I think that a good relationship is based on honesty. So, I'd probably decide based on how I was cheated on if it is worth working on the relationship or not. Was it a drunk kiss that they immediately confessed or did they have multiple affairs over the years and I found out due to a child support notice on their desk?"
entp,fc8x17k,t1_fc7oey0,1577543437.0,"Thanks. :)

I understand from this last text, that you are referring to a specific situation or a specific person. If that is correct, I have been in similar frustrating situations in which I have pulled the following tricks out of my friendliness box: 

* Asking: ""Before we proceed: Do you want brutal honesty or do you just want to be heard and patted on the back a little?"" This can give the other person the opportunity to reflect on what they really want and to communicate this, because often they don't even know themselves. 
* Not saying: ""I told you so"", instead saying: ""You told me so"". ""I told you so"" has a very judgemental touch. Even though you are perfectly right, the other person will get really annoyed and therefore defensive. By teling them that they told you so before, you basically say the same thing but with a touch of remembering they already approached you about this and that you provided a solution for them.
* Saying: ""Tell me if you think that I am being too harsh, but please also explain why"".  
Sometimes it is very hard for me to go full truth without hurting somebody you like, therefore it is important to know their boundaries and to understand them.

Also, a very important thing is to communicate if you are done with their shit. So it is totally fine to tell them: ""Look, don't take this personally, but we have talked this through and through. You were asking for solutions, but honestly after doing this all over again and again, I do not have the impression that you really want to do something about it. I'd rather not talk about this to you anymore until you understand that to change the situation you need to do something about it and then really do it."" Keep in mind that you have emotions too, that are perfectly valid. It may be impatience, anger and frustration instead of more complicated shit, but they are there and they somehow need to be dealt with by you.

Sometimes all your efforts don't pay off. I had this with a friend who demanded I took hours and hours to talk through how shitty her relationship was and I provided her with honesty, care and advice. She chose to gratefully accept them at first and then to play stupid the next day as if our conversation had never happened. This was 4 years ago and the only thing that really changed was our relationship status from really good friends who were talking every day to friends/acquaintances who talk to each other every 6 months. I felt quite guilty at first, because she probably saved me from getting raped once, and I will be really grateful forever.  But by limiting our communication I have my peace of mind back, and that's what healthier for me in the long run."
entp,fc7ir6z,t3_eglk8g,1577508710.0,"Both options don't sound very appealing to me. Personally, what I do is as follows: I spend my time mostly with people who can handle my real self and treat them with honesty. I tend to use exaggeration as a stylistic device and to use cuss words, but that doesn't mean that I am rude to people. With my boyfriend (ESTJ), for example, I have lots of discussions. Sometimes we agree, sometimes one convinces the other, sometimes we agree to disagree. It's not a big drama. My ex-boyfriend (ISFJ) was very difficult to handle for me, because he was annoyed by my actions and by what I said basically all the time. What I learned from this is that sugarcoating is something I can definitely do, but not something I want to do for the rest of my life whenever I spend time with my partner. I want a relationship that is actually enjoyable, and that won't happen if I need to tiptoe around him all the time. 

Whenever talking to other people my actions always depend on several factors, such as: 

1) What is the topic and what impact does it have on me / them / our relationship?  
For example: If somebody at work suggests something unnecessarily complicated, I point out that I find it unnecessarily complicated and provide them with reasoning and a suggestion that makes more sense to me. I will not call them or the suggestion stupid.

2) Are they really wrong or are we just talking about different opinions here? How does what they perceive as the truth impact me / them / our relationship?  
For example: I will firmly argue against my boyfriends mother regarding the importance of marriage, because eventually, she'll notice anyway that I and her son will not get married. 

3) Who is that person? Do I know if they are somehow sensitive to the topic we are talking about?   
For example: When talking to my boyfriend's mother, I will not call marriage per se a dumb idea, because I know that she values it a lot.

4) How important is it to me to take a stand? Why is is important / unimportant to me?   
See example 1: Taking a stand is highly important because it has a direct influence on what I am going to do during the next week and possibly impacts other processes.

5) Is it smarter to speak my mind or to sugarcoat/lie in regarding to who I am talking to? How will it affect our relationship in the long term?    
See examples 2 & 3: As I want us to have a good relationship in the long term, it is smart to be at least friendly.

6) Do I plan on maintaining / improving the relationship with them? What is the best method for this?

7) ...

I think that generally it is a bad idea to be rude on purpose. Even worse if justified with your MBTI type. MBTI is a tool for self-improvement, not a justification of becoming/staying a shitty person."

Honestly, I do not need a guy to protect me, I can protect myself. I want him to challenge me. When I was dating around, that was something many men didn't really get.
I'm not the only woman who thinks that way, so you might as well get rid of your stereotyped thinking towards how men and women are or should be. Of course, if you have characteristics or habits that really annoy you because you don't like them overall in anybody, it's worth changing, but if they come from a fear of not being masculine enough, to me it seems more reasonable if you learn to overcome them. 
Also, being a softy at heart is not restricted to being a feeler."

askfatlogic,fbwmi7s,t3_e14khw,1577153821.0,"Couple's dynamics are often difficult.   
When it comes to dieting together, this can work relly fine, but cheating together often strengthens the bond two people have. It's kind of a light version of ""us against the world"". It may also add some playfulness in the relationship that is otherwise missing due to making boring responsible decisions as eating healthy. 

If you can find your relationship somewhere in this, I suggest to add some enjoyment into your way of dieting. For me and my boyfriend doing a bet worked nicely. We were going on ""who can lose more relative weight in a period of 4 weeks?"", but I can also imagine stuff like ""who can go longer without cheating?""."

This is something I'd totally do if I had children btw, because it's a way harder thing to do if you are unfit as fuck and feel uncomfortable in your body once you are in your 20s and still have to learn the very basics as standing on one foot or catching a ball.
