You dont realize that the things you feel, your thoughts and opinions are all warped by the dependency.

I was just thinking of the kind of people I met in the software field. And acceptable blandness perfectly described them. Brilliant but still so vacant.

That was a little fact they leave out when talking about the i.t. / software fields. I guess it would be wrong to point it out. But from personal experience the best programmers get along better with their machines than their coworkers.

There are two surfaces between which electricity is being passed.

Both surfaces are not the same hence they are asymmetric as opposed to being symmetric.

One surface is made up of graphene oxide and works like a capacitor...

A capacitor works by slowly building charge, and then once it reaches a limit it will release this energy.

The electrocity jumps from the graphene oxide to the other surface made up of polyaniline.

As the electricity flow from the graphene oxide to the polyaniline the polyaniline loses electrons as it heats up until it must be allowed to cool off again before the cycle can be repeated.

The cooling process actually replenishes the polyaniline, which is pretty cool
