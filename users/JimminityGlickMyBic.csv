HotPeppers,fen2wmh,t1_femyn9x,1579275776.0,Thanks for the tips. I’m fairly new to this. I ordered my pH strips yesterday. The few batches I’ve done so far were smoked pepper ferments. Based on an online recipe.
HotPeppers,femx9jq,t1_femvjml,1579271998.0,Thanks for the reply. I really want to try this one. Thanks for the inspirado. How long do you think it would keep in a fridge? A few months?
HotPeppers,femv8am,t3_epp9vl,1579270503.0,Not fermented? Just blended and cooked? Awesome labels btw

food,fd524xj,t1_fd37gzq,1578173512.0,Ok I have to ask. Is it really worth the price? Is it life altering better than a New York strip or porterhouse?
