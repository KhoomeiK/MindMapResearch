SuicideWatch,fdrmf8y,t1_fdomsn6,1578686574.0,"Oh cool! Well best of luck. Keep in mind that college will be your best opportunity to escape your parents, which makes it a great opportunity to pursue things you're interested in vs what they want or expect you to study"
SuicideWatch,fdnzyju,t1_fdnr5mz,1578596277.0,"Hang in there friend. I just entered college and it's so much better. My family was definitely not strict like yours, but there is so much more freedom regardless. Do you know what college you'll be attending?"
SuicideWatch,fdnnz5a,t3_em54sj,1578589710.0,"I'm sorry, that sounds awful. I'm not sure if there's a way to talk to your parents about this, but my guess would be that others are probably right and the best course of action is to wait until college to gain some freedom. You are fairly close to being in college, yeah?"
SuicideWatch,fdjd6np,t3_elj38e,1578465981.0,"Hey, I'm sorry that happened. Your dad sounds like an asshole. I hope you're still with us tonight.


What is your relationship with the rest of your family like? Could you talk to any of them about what he did?"
SuicideWatch,fdh5h1k,t3_el5nbr,1578415797.0,"You honestly don't sound lazy or at fault or anything like that. You sound like a person who made normal decisions at a younger age, amd who has had to learn to cope with loss in unique ways because your family is so emotionally unsupportive. Giving you money for college isnt enough; your family should have been there for you when your brother died, or when Ryan died, or when your grandmother died. At your side, not hurling accusations.

I'd say the first thing you should try to focus on is bringing up your gpa and continuing university. Tell your parents you can't finish yet because of the break you took. That it physically isnt possible and you need more money. You can also talk to your school's financial aid office about funds if your family refuses to pay. That makes you an independent and you are likely to get more aid that way. After that you can worry about getting a well-paying job, etc.

It seems like you've been taught your life to blame yourself for things that aren't your fault or aren't that big of a deal. Maybe you messed up with money, or with some classes, whatever. It happens, it isn't the end of the world. Don't beat yourself up over it, just take a deep breath and start brainstorming ways to move forward. That's what matters now. Also, don't be ashamed of things that bring you joy, like videogames. Maybe ration your time so you can work more on classes, but keep some time for yourself to relax and be happy. 

You can make it through this, I believe in you."
SuicideWatch,fdevkk7,t3_ekr9h1,1578347502.0,"There is a lot of good advice here, including making sure to invite her to things and being there for her. Remind her that being a ""burden"" is a necessary part of meaningful friendships. That she is worth any inconvenience she could possibly cause you. That she adds a lot to your life. Getting authorities involved is also likely necessary here. Keep trying to find helpful resources that she can use, but also prepare yourself to call the police. It may be scary calling 911 and explaining that you think your friend is going to attempt suicide, but you still need to do it if you suspect she is going to try. Make sure you have her address in this eventuality. 

Good luck, I'm sorry that your friend is going through this right now. Keep supporting her and don't give up even if she seems to have."
SuicideWatch,fdd0699,t3_ekhjqm,1578289666.0,"Hey, we're here for you. I know that isn't enough, but we're still here. I hope you're here too. I'm sorry things are so difficult, I'm sorry it feels so hopeless. It seems clear to me that some of the person you miss is still inside of you. I hope that person ends up fighting and wins. But if the odds are far too great and we were unable to help, I hope you are peaceful. Godspeed, we love you."
SuicideWatch,fdaa4w8,t3_ekbhf5,1578243533.0,"Hey, I hope you're still there. I had really bad OCD as a kid and I know it really sucks. It's not permanent though, and it can be treated. The medication works, and thanks to therapy Ive been free of compulsive/anxious thoughts for years.

Please come back and talk to us"
UCSantaBarbara,fd4z0js,t1_fd4r871,1578172573.0,"It's a requirement that you've taken it and done well on the test. That's the only real requirement. Might be at a slight disadvantage if they dont get to see your scores till June or whatever (after they make most of the selections), but it's probably ok. Focus on why you like physics/things that demonstrate your interest in math/science/physics/learning"
UCSantaBarbara,fd440ee,t3_ejsy44,1578164212.0,"CCS Physics freshmen here,

When you complete your UC application you will need to check a box and submit a letter to the CCS Physics faculty. In this letter you will sell yourself for the program. The faculty (the advisor that will mentor and teach you) then hand-selects 20-30 students for the program each year. For this reason, who you are as a person and how passionate you are about physics matters a lot more than exactly what scores and grades you got. Some of the students our year have already taken all of the lowerclassmen math coursework theough community college before getting to UCSB. Some have much less experience. A few have no traditional physics experience. The only set requirement is completion of AP Calculus BC (or equivalent, and you will need it). 


So yes, you have a chance. A wide range of people get into CCS, and the biggest uniting factors between us are interest in physics and luck."

SuicideWatch,fckzy9a,t1_fckzfgw,1577736811.0,"Oh man, OCD is exactly what I had. It's really debilitating huh :(. I got it when I was a kid, which I've heard is rare, and a year and a half of trying out different therapists finally got rid of it. Once we went to a dedicated OCD therapist who used exposure therapy and other methods, my life started improving so rapidly. I used to think I'd never be happy again, and now it's as if I never even had OCD. 

I hope you decide to give it another go, I know it might take a little while to find the right therapist (my first two therapists were 0% helpful before I found the right one), but I owe so much to the help I got"
SuicideWatch,fckys4s,t1_fckxtbr,1577736089.0,"Oh sorry, I totally missed that part somehow. Have an awful cold right now and my brain is clearly not at peak capacity.

I'm sorry you had a bad experience with psychiatry. A lot of my friends are on meds or visit therapists and it has been night and day for them as far as improvement. Therapy helped me a lot when I was suffering from mental illness. It can be hit or miss though :/. I'm guessing you would not be willing to try it again?"
SuicideWatch,fckxl26,t1_fckwize,1577735358.0,Have you sought treatment? Therapy or medication?
SuicideWatch,fckvs3r,t3_ehndfw,1577734257.0,Could you elaborate a little bit about what is going on? I assume something happened to motivate this question?
SuicideWatch,fcktmm6,t3_ehokdo,1577732925.0,"Hey, I'm sorry about what you've been through :(. It sounds like what you had with her was special, and it's no less special now that it's over. The fact that it ended is not proof that it was fake or meaningless, it's proof that you can make meaningful connections and that not all of the world is dark and uncaring.

You are a human being, and you are deserving of love. No matter what.  I'm sorry it doesn't feel that way. Could you elaborate on your situation a little?"
SuicideWatch,fcksqt2,t3_ehonx2,1577732381.0,"The people you love and care about would much rather have you in their lives as a ""burden"" than not having you at all.

Needing help and being ""an inconvenience"" are necessary, important parts of love. Of friendships, of relationships, of family. You are worth it to them; you bring light into their lives. There is nothing to be guilty about, you are worth it even if you dont think you are.

I'm sorry you feel this way, I'm sorry things are hard.
