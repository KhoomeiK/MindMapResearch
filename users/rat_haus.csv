GalaxysEdge,ff1qu4a,t1_ff1ci9x,1579484157.0,"You only scratched the surface.  The coolest thing you can do is hack stuff.  You know that eyeball monster in the drinking fountain?  Or the jets that shoot mist out of the bottom of the millennium falcon?  The app is how YOU and other guests activate those things.  Most of the things you cancan hack activate an audio or light effect, but those first two things are the special and very very cool.  The panels are part of a meta game, you can hack them for the First Order or the Resistance, and depending on which faction has hacked more of them they win the game, and participants on the winning team get some credits.

The next coolest thing is hacking transmissions which is fun if you're into Star Wars lore or want to learn more about the characters that live in Batuu.  Several buildings around the land can have their transmissions hacked, and when you do it you'll get a snippet of a written dialogue between two characters.

You may also recall getting a score on your panel at the end of Smuggler's Run, if you have the app open and running while you're on the ride you will have your score converted directly to credits and applied to your account.  But do be warned, it's a bit finicky and doesn't always work.

And Finally, you can translate the Auribesh you find around the land.  That one's pretty self explanatory."

I think there are just two varieties if I'm remembering correctly.  I think it's Kylo Ren's saber, and a jedi saber but I don't remember which one it's based off of."
GalaxysEdge,ff007kt,t1_fezq2t6,1579463725.0,"Kinda.  You just cover up most of the blade in black material, and only allow light to shine through the edges.  That's how cosplayers and prop makers do it.
