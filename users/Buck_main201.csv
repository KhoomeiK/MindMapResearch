modernwarfare,ff93ucx,t1_ff8z2t5,1579704188.0,"I'm the closest I've ever been to doing this myself. Last week I had a great week, most games I was at least 2.0 k/d and now every game I've played for the last week I have been getting fucking STOMPED. Like 6 deaths to maybe 1 kill. I really do love this game, just got plat camos on smgs but I might be quitting soon because dying 55 times in a game on shoothouse isn't fun at all"

modernwarfare,ff7qfzm,t1_ff7bjtw,1579655857.0,I just got plat on smgs and the longshots were always my last camos.

dankmemes,ff2l7w0,t1_ff2esq2,1579511365.0,I have paid for Google music for like 2 years and YouTube premium is included with it. Not gonna lie I don't think I could go back to seeing ads on every video
worldnews,ff1tcwr,t1_feyz6w8,1579485737.0,I fully support everyone of these guys being killed but you basically accused someone of being a child molester and threatened  to kill them with nothing to go off.  Did he have accusations or? I can see why you weren't allowed at the church tbh
todayilearned,ff1jbh8,t1_ff0xxln,1579480112.0,"Facebook hasn't been ""cool"" for a long time. I'm mid twenties and I stopped using it probably 7-8 years ago and deleted it about a year ago. Twitter and Instagram  have been more popular for almost a decade"

Rainbow6,ff0zybu,t1_ff07tvg,1579473903.0,"This isn't nearly as funny anymore. I can understand having a smurf maybe a division down to play with friends that aren't as good but a bunch of champions in copper is fucking toxic and stops new players getting into the game. Maybe I'm wrong and if I am, I apologize, but that looks way more like a champion charm than copper to me."
SiegeAcademy,feya6gv,t1_fewye3i,1579442853.0,"Works great when it works, then you get the odd time when you hit the top of the drone hole and a cooked nade  bounces back and kills you and the therm"
SiegeAcademy,fey9yj5,t3_eqti3r,1579442754.0,"I do this all the time. 1v2 being pinched with 2 doors in the room, toss an uncooked nade at one entrance and challenge the other guy. Hopefully you can finish him and have time to turn to the second players entry point before the nade has gone off."
