But I did some research and if you're really serious about getting rid of single use garbage bags there are a lot of options. Biodegradable/compostable bags, recycled plastic bags, resuable bags, etc. You can even go without a bag altogether and just use your trash bin bare."

aww,fcop2gd,t1_fcoietp,1577837810.0,I may be wrong but I think OP is calling the cat a crackhead. As a cat owner myself I think thatâ€™s a pretty accurate way to describe one
Hair,fc8qyy7,t1_fc8nf7k,1577540410.0,"From cheek to shoulder is great progress! I read that hair grows about half an inch a month so that sounds pretty average to me. But honestly, it's not about how fast your hair is growing, so please don't worry about that. Hair never stops growing and everyone's hair grows at more or less the same rate, contrary to what you might think. There's nothing wrong with the way your hair grows and truthfully there's no way to get hair to grow faster. 

It's all about how fast your hair is breaking off. I hope you understand that because it took me so long to get that through my head. I thought I was just born with slow hair but I eventually realized that I need to nourish my hair, get my ends trimmed often, and really just take care of it. 

I'm sorry I can't give you more advice about wavy hair. I'm lucky I can just throw all the products I want in my hair and it'll be fine, but with wavy hair like yours you really have to strike a balance between dry and oily. I would suggest you check out some wavy hair care channels on YouTube. They should have good product recommendations and tips that will help you out. 

I keep giving you really long replies sorryðŸ˜…. You remind me of myself from a few years ago so I'm giving you all the advice I wish I had."
Hair,fc8mqni,t1_fc8kwxt,1577538094.0,"I'm not an expert and we have different hair types but  here's what I learned from my experience (from shoulder length to almost waist length curly hair). 

I'm going to assume that your hair is relatively dry since you said you're on the curlier side. Dryness leads to breakage which stops you from seeing any growth. Make sure you pick out your shampoo and conditioner carefully. You'll want something hydrating, and sulfate free. Again, we have different hair types so idk if it would be good for your hair, but I like the Hello Hydration line by Herbal Essence. If you have a bit more money to spend, DevaCurl is a brand that specializes in curly and wavy hair textures. 

It's easier to detangle your hair with conditioner in. When you get out the shower, dry your hair with an old t shirt and put leave in conditioner. Deep conditioners are life savers also. If you're interested in defining your curls it's worth checking out extra products like texturizers and mousses, but just remember that the less is sometimes more when it comes to finer hair types. 

Sleep with your hair protected (pineapple style is a common one). A silk pillow case will minimize frizz and breakage. Try not to straighten your hair a lot and use heat protection when you do. 

This all that really comes to mind at the moment. I know what it's like to feel like your hair just isn't growing so I hope this help! Oh and btw try taking progress pictures if you haven't already. Sometimes we're blind to how fast our hair is actually growing, especially when it's wavy/curly and doesn't show it's true length."
Hair,fc8kthd,t3_egp6dp,1577536999.0,What's your hair type? That plays a big role in what routine you should have and what products you should use.
