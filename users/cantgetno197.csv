askscience,fet7c36,t1_fespujc,1579372450.0,"To a first approximation the regions away from the junction are considered in equilibrium and all voltage drop is assumed to occur across the junction itself.

It's worth pointing out that this is a bit of a little white lie. Current is conserved meaning that in order for a I=I0(exp(qV/kT) - 1) current to flow through the junction, the bulk regions, far from the junction, have to also carry that current is strictly speaking a drift current of majority carriers pushed by a teensy weensy electric field. The concentration of majority carriers is typically something huge like 10^16 per cm^3 so even the tiniest electric field can lead to significant currents (since current is ""number of charges"" x ""average speed of charges"" and average speed is proportional to the electric field strength (the proportionality is called the ""mobility"")). Point being to FIRST approximation there is no field at all in the regions away from the junction, but more honestly there must be a really, really, tiny one in order to supply carriers to the junction.

Another way of thinking of this is that in order for there to be an electric field in the bulk region there must be a potential drop (E=V/L where L is the length of the region), which is to say voltage has to be lost, which is to say we have to think of a resistor-junction-resistor system. To first approximation we don't consider any voltage drop away from the junction so there's not going to be any electric field and thus no push. Though, again, strictly speaking there must be SOME, but it's small. If you actually use a more fancy physics model you'll find that the non-zero-but-small field in the bulk regions is about 10,000 times less than in the junction, so the approximation is justified.

>except I think you mixed up the direction of the electric field, it points n to p, that's the direction that would oppose majority drift

Yes, you're right, apologies. Depletion of mobile carriers in the p region exposes NEGATIVELY charged acceptor dopants and oppositely for the n region so the field is n to p, you're right."
askscience,fesiwsh,t1_ferysuy,1579365701.0,"A common model of transport is ""drift-diffusion"", drift is charges being pushed by an electric field, diffusion occurs if there are more of a carrier type in on place than another (i.e. a concentration gradient). In the n region electrons are the majority carrier and there are lots of them, where in the p region they are the minority carrier and there is less of them. Thus there is a DIFFUSIVE flow of electrons from n to p. Since electrons are negatively charged a flow from n to p means a CURRENT from p to n (since is defined as a positive current being the motion of positive carriers). Similarly there is a diffusive flow of holes from p to n which makes a current from p to n. So both diffusive flows, whethet electron or hole, is a p to n current. On the other hand drift currents are electric field driven and the electric field is in the p to n direction. This repels majority carriers on both sides (electron in the n are pushed back to n and holes in p are pushed back into p). However, minority carriers in each region are going to find a p to n electric field as BENEFICIAL and they WILL flow through the junction. Minority drift flow of electrons would be a p to n flow which is an n to p current (again, sign flips cuz electrons are negative). Minority drift flow of holes is n to p which is an n to p current.

So majority diffusion is strongly hampered by the E field but is a p to n current where minority drift is a n to p. They oppose each other. Thus at equilibrium, by definition, they are perfectly cancelling and there is no NET flow. If you then go into reverse bias what you're doing is suppressing further the majority diffusive flow by making the electric field strong. This has no effect on minority drift though, it just means the electric field is extra helpful, but the magnitude of the minority drift current is determined/limited by how available minority carriers are, so a strong helpful electric field makes no difference, every minority carrier that arrived at the junction was already making it across even at equilbrium"
askscience,ferxavf,t1_feruo18,1579359312.0,"Because the only current that can flow is minority carrier drift, which is small and electric field independent. At equilibrium you have majority carrier diffusion and minority carrier drift and they are opposite in direction and equal in magnitude (thus there is no net flow). If you go into forward bias the minority carrier drift current is unaltered (the electric field is lowering but still in their favor) but the majority diffusion current increases exponentially because you're lowering the electric field which for majority carriers is repulsing them from the region. Conversely if you go into reverse bias you're INCREASING the electric field and thus you kill majority diffusion entirely but minority drift is still unaffected and its size is not electric field dependent (since it only matters that the E-field exist, so they can cross, the strength of it doesn't matter) and thus that's the source of the small saturated negative current you see in reverse bias."

An electron in the p-region would be a minority carrier. I very explicitly said that there IS a minority carrier drift current through the junction. That's where the small negative current is coming from in reverse bias.

There IS however a small negative saturation current in reverse bias which comes from MINORITY carriers drifting, for minority carriers the electric field is helpful; electrons in the p-side are pushed right and holes in the n-side are pushed left.

Specifically there he was talking about how the postulation of the quark (back then) consolidated and synthesized what was at the time a ""particle zoo"" of hundreds of hadrons to just 4 (now 6) quarks. 

There is a general sense that we may be approaching a time like that again (though it does seem like it's been feeling that way for a very long time).

They were referring to the fact that the end goal of physics is a mathematical theory that can predict any experiment, rather than cataloging a set of ""things that exist"".

>How do they know that the u. is just not in the initial state of expansion and that is why it is accelerating presently but one day it will stop accelerating?

In ""vanilla"" Big Bang Cosmology (BBC), which ignores any specific quantum effects we know are important and is an entirely non-quantum description, the observed acceleration is consistent with basically all ""space"" having a built-in, set energy density that even as space expands or, as an analogy, we sometimes say ""new space is created"" that ""new space"" comes with a certain fixed amount of energy. The amount of this built-in energy is dictated by what's called the ""cosmological constant"" which can only be a constant in order to jive with vanilla BBC. From day one when BBC theory was developed from general relativity (our theory of gravity) we (i.e. Einstein and Friedmann) knew that there COULD be a constant term and things would still work. Einstein famously kinda mangled it to make a static universe but now it seems that we don't have a static universe and it really should be there.

However, it's interesting to point out that when one starts adding quantum considerations into the mix there is an idea that exists called QUINTESSENCE:

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintessence_(physics)

Which attempts to assign a  quantum origin to this cosmological ""constant"" and in doing so actually allows for the possibility that the constant could actually change in time."
canada,fen7j8v,t1_fen2u6n,1579278684.0,"This is a mess of bad numeracy. You're confusing rates and absolutes and yearly numbers and proportion shifts to make a bunch of bundled nonsense. By your OWN DATA (the second link) a 10% SHIFT in the proportion of migrant labor (i.e. say 50% migrant/50% non-migrant to 60% migrant/40% non-migrant) is associated with a 4% drop in earnings. You can find a pre-print of the actual paper it's summarizing here:

https://www.nber.org/papers/w12327.pdf

So we need to find out how much the PROPORTION of migrants has changed from 2000-2019 (I'll get back to that in a second).

But before we get to that, for logic's sake, let's be clear that your first study seems fine enough but for whatever point you're trying to make seems just like noise. It deals with how much an IMMIGRANT's pay cheque (in inflation adjusted terms) changes based on a 10% increase in the size of the number of immigrants taken in at the same time. Not particularly relevant directly, though a more interested person could probably tease out something from it as an indirect metric, but I'm too lazy.

Your 7% is also being quoted out of context, they only say that immigration may have played ""a role"" in the observed 7% drop, not that the 7% is a prediction of their trend or something they're claiming is wholly attributable to immigration.

You then quote absolute migrants per year numbers as if that is sufficient information to inform your first part which is a proportion. To know a proportion you need to know some combination number coming in, number leaving, the absolute number of people and the growth rate. Otherwise you're just saying numbers.  140,000 a year!!! Okay. Is that a lot? Is that a little? First of all, that's like 0.4% of the 35 million people that live in Canada but again, all that matters is NET change relative to total population. 

Anyways, so your last two are meaningless numbers. So I did a quick poke around statscan gave me this which is PROPORTION of foreign-born Ontarians by year:

https://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/economy/demographics/census/images/cenhi16-8-image1-large.jpg

Now, YOUR OWN second data says a 10% shift in PROPORTION means a 4% drop. The shift in PROPORTION since 2000 is ~2%, which crudely applying your rule of thumb is then a 0.8% drop in wages due to immigration, all other things being equal. A somewhat puzzling issue with your second data is that it never says if that's a real wage or nominal wage, but regardless, for context, at the same time INFLATION from 2000 to 2019 in Ontario has been 43%. So if the ""4% for 10% shift"" is a real wage number than it's quite small, if it's a nominal number than it's literally a rounding error. One would assume it is real, because who the hell would quote nominal?

Anyways, the article itself is actually about the manufacturing sector and its decline in Toronto. But stagnation of real wage rate is sadly a growing global occurrence in all kinds of economies with all kinds of immigration rates."

I mean I think there is also a divide in our experience on experimental vs. theory. My PhD was condensed matter theory (quantum phase transitions, so pretty far from industry focused, but I was computational and high-performance computing focused rather than pen and paper) and most of the people I knew were CMT, particle (pen and paper quantum gravity mainly), AMO theory, soft condensed (theory and experiment) and lots of Astro with either observational or theory. We did have quite a few CM experiment guys (ARPES and neutron scattering mainly) but none of them ended up with jobs that used any skills that they learned there. Without careful branding and consideration, and honestly some prep-work, I don't think any semi company I've work with would hire any Phys PhD I knew ""as is"". I don't think a single one that wasn't a real go-getter didn't spend at least ~year unemployed or marginally employed at some point over the past 5 years. After the dust settled most are fine, but most also had to self-teach themselves stuff. You say, for example:

>""Here, I wrote [software] for [whatever]"".

And I fully agree, you need bullets like this. But none of them really had them. They might have been observational astro and wrote spaghetti Python code to hook up to some arcane API from some mysterious black-box FORTRAN simulation code from the 1990s and they thought that would hold up as ""experienced programmer"" and it didn't.  So they had to develop hobby projects and learn what the hell Object-Oriented Programming is and their stack vs. heap and so on and try at it for quite some time. 

Or they were a particle theorist, who had heard vague notions that they could just waltz into a quant position if their academic career didn't work out and then found out that no, no they couldn't. Lots of universities have dedicated Mathematical Finance masters now and banks now have a choice between hiring one of those or hiring an entitled String Theorist who couldn't bother to look up what the Black-Scholes equation was. Guess which they pick, even after they hit the books on the subject? So they'd do something like go for a second masters in math finance. Or they went to Coursera and taught themselves Hadoop and over a 6-8 month period developed a ""machine learning portfolio"" of hobby projects to show to interviewers and to add bullets to their resume.

THEN they had the bullets like you said.

I myself recognized about a year before my PhD defense that CMT was not for me, I didn't personally like being so lost in the world of spin liquids and gauge symmetries and quantum phases that may or may not exist in this one material at the nanokelvin, it just wasn't my cup of tea. So I did some soul searching and realized what I DID get excited about was emerging solid-state technology (spintronics, nanoelectronics, photovoltaics, resistive ram, etc.) and I got permission from my PhD supervisor to take additional classes in my last year on the side (hey, technically I'm paying tuition) in electrical engineering/engineering physics to take control of my post-PhD resume and I've been continuously employed in that field all the way til now where I have a quasi-permanent staff scientist position at an institute that focuses on that (though I'll probably be moving on in about a year).

So why would you hire some fancy-pants eye-in-the-sky person who had the poor business sense to dedicate 6 years of their life to something with no obvious connection to the real work when you could just hire a fresh Computer Science bachelor?

For engineering there are two big issues: 1) Even experimentalists don't have much ""bench time"" experience, which is what engineers consider ""the basics"", and 2) Engineers feel they are looked down upon by physicists, which puts kinda a chip on their shoulder about things. Now, as you say, for an experimentalist you may have SOME ""bench time"", depending, but many have none whatsoever and theorists definitely have none whatsoever. Even if the job isn't explicitly based around such work, it's just considered ""basic skills"" to be able to just lash something to an oscilloscope and do some basic electrical characterization on it, or the like. It's expected to be ""no biggie"". And, secondly, as I said, engineers don't like physicists. Part of it is cultural, part of it is because engineers don't see ""the point"" of blue-sky research and thus don't much see the point of hiring someone whose career up to that point has been exclusively focused on it. They're concerned that when you hit a road-block in whatever you're doing, that where they just want to find a ""good enough"" fast solution and move on, you're going to want to get lost down some rabbit hole of finding the fundamental reasons for it.

>Simply sticking a mass onto a force-carrying particle had disastrous effects

This isn't what you say. Explicitly adding a mass term to a gauge theory by hand leads to a broken theory, that's what this is saying, which is true. The fact that gauge theory DOESN'T have mass, does not mean gauge theory is broken. It's a fine functioning quantum field theory. It just isn't consistent with how the weak force was experimentally observed to behave.

Are you literally directing me to the actual original paper on Goldstone bosons? Ya, I kniw what a Goldstone mode is, it's not exactly frontier physics. What's next  you going to direct me to Newton's Principia for what a ""force"" is?

>This was LATER disproven through experiment

This is not disproven. Whenever you have a spontaneous broken continuous symmetry you still always get a goldstone mode. Just as true today as then.

>because of the constant interactions with the Higgs field which slow down the particles

No. You can see this is wrong by just Newton's First Law: objects in motion remain in motion UNLESS operated on by an external force. If I have an electron in an empty universe and give it a certain velocity it will keep going at that speed forever. Objects don't just slow down. The Higgs mechanism is not a drag, despite a million bad pop sci articles using the analogy.

Mass is not a drag, it's a ""minimum energy to create"". If we want to think of a particle as a ripple in a field then we use the terms MASSLESS and (energy) GAPLESS are synonymous and interchangeable. It's an energy cost to create one with no velocity.

Anyways, I'm not going to bother with the rest. You wouldn't get anything from it anyways, since you seem to be committed to summiting Dunning-Kruger's [mount](http://theengineeringmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/20111228.gif)"

I mean, it screams that you don't know what you're talking about. I understand you copy and pasted some stuff and reworked it a bit but you didn't know what you could cut and what you shouldn't so you emphasize weird things and omit weird things, and abuse terms and have sentences in sequence that don't actually connect to one another. But if you really want it then fine, sentence by sentence:

>Given that gauge bosons are required to have unbroken gauge symmetry, this phenomenon runs counter to our understanding of physics.

This is definitional, so obviously correct. How does it have any connection to ""mass""? You don't say, which makes it a sentence without context.

>The mass exhibited by such particles as the W and Z bosons has gone unexplained by scientists: the best current theories suggest their mass **should result in predictions that tend to infinity.**

Which predictions? QFT is all about taming infinities, which predictions/quantities associated with the masslessness of gauge bosons are supposed to be problematic that you're alluding to (honest question, none come to mind)? The issue was/is that the weak force is observed to be a short-ranged force where any force mediated by a massless field would necessarily be long-ranged. I understand you're trying to frame things in an ominous way, but mysterious infinities were not the issue when it comes to why the Higgs mechanism was needed.

>This mechanism has been designated SCP-XXXX-A. Current theories as to its nature include: A massless mediating particle

How can a proposed mechanism of gauge bosons having mass be that gauge bosons are massless? That's like saying ""An explanation for why apples are red is that they are in fact green"".

>This phenomenon has been found to arise due to interactions with the so-called 'Higgs field'. When gauge bosons interact with the Higgs field they lose kinetic energy, thus gaining mass energy.

This doesn't make any sense. Kinetic energy has nothing to do with things here and what does ""mass energy"" mean? Mass, by definition, is what you have, even when you have NO motion. So a mass-having particle with no kinetic energy still has mass. Take a shot in the dark here, is this sentence based on some misunderstanding of ""relativistic mass"" an out-moded concept in special relativity being somehow muddled in with Higgs mechanism physics (which is completely unrelated)? Relativistic mass has nothing to do with Higgs fields and gauge bosons (and, as I said, is a fairly out-moded concept). Anyways, that sentence is incorrect.  The mass for the gauge bosons is coming from the coupling/interaction with a Higgs-like field and so is in essence a potential energy. The mass of other stuff is largely just binding energy (which includes both kinetic and potential energies).

>This does apparently break gauge symmetry (once thought to be necessarily unbreakable), but is allowed by the Higgs mechanism which endows particles with mass.

This is confused. The gauge symmetry of gauge bosons is NOT broken by the Higgs mechanism, they remain gauge invariant. However, because of the coupling the STATE they end up in at temperatures below the electroweak temperature will be symmetry broken. One is about the laws of physics the other is about the state that results. In physics the laws can be symmetric while the observed state breaks that symmetry. This is what happens in, for example, an everyday fridge magnet. The special phrase is ""spontaneous symmetry breaking"" if you want to google more.  So, the point is, the thing ""thought to be unbreakable"" is still fine and not broken. Also, this is phrased in a way that conveys the opposite of the correct understanding: the Higgs mechanism doesn't FIX the ""symmetry problem"" it FORCES the states to have broken symmetry in the first place.

All kinds of systems have symmetry-breaking interactions, that is nothing special about the Higgs mechanism. Rather the Higgs mechanism is a specific set of criteria on a symmetry breaking field such that, when coupled to a gauge field, you'll get a mass-like term that pops out. How to get symmetry broken states in general was not the big mystery.

>As of 04/07/2012 observations at CERN have confirmed the existence of the so-called 'Higgs boson'.

In the previous entry you said ""Higgs field"" so you should probably be consistent. Perhaps something like ""As of 04/07/2012 observations at CERN seem to support the existence of a boson excitation of a field consistent with the posited ""Higgs field"""" or something of that nature. We don't care about the boson, the boson is just the name for an EXCITATION or ""ripple"" in the field but we care about the field and its non-zero vacuum expectation value. In a sense, what's important is the field at ""equilibrium"", not the ripples. However, you can't really prove the existence of the non-rippling field, so instead we create ripples in it and detect the ripples, that's what the Higgs boson is. But its importance is not that the ripples were important but that they directly evidence that the field itself exists. So CERN confirmed the existence of the Higgs field via detecting a Higgs boson."
AskPhysics,fegmlpg,t3_eoqmmy,1579097330.0,"Evaluated as a creative writing exercise in science fiction, it's probably not a good idea to ask actual physicists.  In science fiction I've noticed (as a sci-fi fan and physicist) there is a kind of Dunning-Kruger effect around ""technobabble"". For those who know little about physics, technobabble written by a non-expert can enhance immersion and willful suspension of disbelief. However for those who know a lot about physics, technobabble written by a non-expert sounds like nails on a chalkboard. A physicist would much rather have something called ""the void"" or whatever rather than ""an Einstein-Rosen Bridge"" because we know what an Einstein-Rosen bridge is and, sorry, they're not magical ""zip away to adventure"" macguffins. But what's ""the void""? We don't know. Could be anything. Could be a magical ""zip away to adventure"" macguffin. If a sci fi show talks about ""the Speed Force"", that's fine. It's non-specific, and it's not layering on concrete details and claims that can actually be scientifically evaluated (in which case they would instantly be found to be wrong and silly). So if instead you talk about ""Come on Barry, you're at Mach 3, you're almost at the speed of light, but the molecules in your suit are destabilizing, you've got to quantum phase shift a bit and then we can harvest the quantum tachyons and exploit the Alcubierre effect!"" it sounds like an idjit speaking (to a physicist).

My point being that to a physicist such writing is kinda silly and kinda cringy (just being honest) but they're going to be the tiniest minority of any intended audience. So, rather than focusing on specific scientific details in your writing I think it is maybe of some use to point out that the VOICE is not right. I know it's a document that's not necessarily supposed to have been written by a physicist but physicists don't write like that and there's a number of ""Hollywood-isms"" that Hollywood THINKS is how physicists talk and think that are really just things that they've invented from whole cloth.

For example, an easy one, mixing the term ""physicists"" and ""scientists"" interchangeably. Physicists are of course scientists but they don't refer to themselves in such a broad sense. That would be lumping them in with the ""dummies"" of Biology or Chemistry! They're Physicists, damnit! So ""physicists believe"" not ""scientists believe"". 

Another one is the term ""quantum physics"". This is a Hollywood-ism in general. There are two distinct mathematical frameworks in physics, i.e. different physical theories, one is called ""Quantum Mechanics"" the other ""Quantum Field Theory"". Generally, depending on what you're talking about you'd refer to the appropriate one based on specifics. Hollywood also thinks ""quantum physics"" has to do with time dilation and time effects. That comes from the field of Relativity which is something different.

The Higgs mechanism, for example, is a QFT thing. It's also not a ""theory"". QFT is a theory. Theory in physics means ""a concrete internally consistent set of math and equations that one can use to generate predictions for a certain sub-set of phenomena"". The Higgs mechanism is a recipe - a set of instructions if you like - within QFT for re-casting a non-massive field with an interaction to a scalar field as a re-branded ""massive"" non-interacting field. It's not a ""notion"" or ""idea"" in the sense that it ""may be true"", it's undoubtedly true that one can make such a mathematical transformation. The mechanism itself is not on trial. The issue is whether that's what's happening with the fields of the Standard Model specifically and thus the ""mass"" of, say, an electron is really secretly an interaction energy with some scalar field that meets a certain set of requirements.

So all of that is to say that sentences like ""and well understood theory in quantum physics"" or ""is the phenomenon known as 'mass' in quantum physics"" scream ""Hollywood writer who's never even met a physicist or seen one speak"". And again, that's just about ""voice"" and avoiding things like what is ""mass in quantum physics"" supposed to mean as a scientific statement? Quantum physics does not have a different meaning for mass than... like... non-quantum physics. But anyways.

The final voice thing is probably the most important because it's an issue throughout. And that's dramatically mixing levels of specificity and jargon-level from sentence to sentence. This makes the ""wikipedia-ese"" really pop out. Like you have a list where these are literally two successive bullets: ""A reality warping agent manipulating events"", ""A massless mediating particle"". The latter uses very specific language of QFT and the former is extraordinarily vague and non-scientific. Like, I understand creatively what you're trying to equate things to some eerie supernatural possibility as if it were plausible reality but if we're to believe the thing is written by an expert they would not mix levels of depth on a dime like that. You're not going to write a report saying ""It could be that a 1/4in piece of tungsten alloy became dislodged from the primary casing approximately 7 inches from the top end... OR... could've been gremlins"" (unless you're trying to be funny of course). You do this throughout, you go 0 to 60 with language like gauge bosons and gauge symmetries and dedicate entire sentences to things like ""This does apparently break gauge symmetry"" as if this was a concern the reader might have based on your previous one-sentence discussion and then throttle down in the next sentence to ""check out some papers"".  This screams: ""sci fi write - sci fi writer - some stuff I grabbed from google and don't really understand - sci fi writer - sci fi writer"". It's a tonal issue, you rev up and rev down in terms what you expect your ""in universe"" reader to be in a way that no natural person who could have written this document would."

The way a MOSFET works is that you have PNP junction where basically the ""doping"" in the N part can be altered in real time.

The thing is that ""conceptually"" when a MOSFET is below inversion, and it truly is a PNP or NPN junction the current is ""conceptually"" considered zero and we don't care. When we talk about IV characteristica we always phrase it in terms of overdrive voltage, Vgs - Vt > 0. At this point the junction resistance is minimal as you have at most a p^+ p (i.e. unipolar) junction and, as you suspected, the limiting resistor is the conductivity of the channel.

However, if we DID go the other way and bias away from inversion into accumulation then I believe you are correct that the limiting resistance then comes from the reverse biased PN junction and you would get a saturation current if one assumes a drain voltage is applied. If there is no drain voltage then there would be symmetric flow from drain to source and source to drain and thus no net currenr.

So I think you're right, resistance is junction limited in accumulation and drift in the channel limited in inversion.

askscience,fdgwpbr,t3_el88rf,1578410196.0,"An oft repeated misconceptions is that bonds ""hold energy"". This is wrong, by definition a bound states has an energy DEBT. It has negative energy relative to the components being separated from one another so they no longer interact. Its potential energy (i.e. the force holding it together) exceeds its kinetic energy (its speed) so it cannot escape. Thus to break up a bound system energy must be INSERTED. Conversely, one can extract energy by forcing a system to go deeper into energy debt (i.e. into a deeper bound state). Of course the cost to free it, should you want to, then increases by the same amount you extracted."

physicsmemes,fdet1ll,t1_fdes1yk,1578346004.0,">Another example is (ferro)magnetism: below the Curie point, two spin states of a ferromagnet are distinct phases, but if you go above the Curie point that distinction disappears.

The Curie point IS a second-order phase transition point. That transition is in fact paradigmatic of what a second-order transition is, it's the most famous example. However it is not correct to say that the degenerate spin states are distinct phases, the phase transition is related to the fact that you have had spontaneous symmetry breaking, not to which actual symmetry broken state you end up in (more on this in a second).

>In the supercritical region there is simply no concept of liquid and vapour because (by definition) there is no phase transition there so it's just a supercritical fluid. The two phases only exist in the subcritical region.

The concept of a phase lies in the ability to construct an order parameter to delineate distinct phases with a clear transition. The question is simple: what is the order parameter that separates a liquid and a gas? I am not aware of one. Conversely, your other example (ferromagnetic-paramagnetic) there absolutely IS an order parameter, it's <M> the average magnetization. Thus there is a complete unambiguous way of categorizing the two as different phases separated by a second-order transition: Is <M> zero (paramagnetic) or not (ferromagnetic)? Again, I do not believe any such thing exists for liquid-gas. 

Put another way, there is a deep connection between phase transitions and symmetry breaking. Fluid -> Solid represents a breaking of Gallilean invariance, but what is the symmetry being broken in going from liquid -> gas?"
physicsmemes,fdeg8us,t1_fdefdu6,1578338361.0,"I'm going to be honest, for fluids, I can't remember how it all works but doesn't one typically describe things in terms of an order parameter based around spatial density correlations <rho(0)rho(x)> and the functional dependence that has and at high pressures there's some term that basically goes to 1 and thus the correlations are indistinguishable and you have the same functional form. There is no phase transition from ""subcritical"" to ""supercritical"" so there exists a thermodynamic path connecting both sides without crossing a transition. One could of course define a ""constant pressure"" order parameter then there is of course a first-order transition but then one hasn't defined a generalized, holistic order parameter that captures the essence of ""liquid-ness as distinct from gas-ness"" as it's pegged to a pressure."
physicsmemes,fde8akr,t1_fdduvq3,1578333370.0,"""State of matter"" is something that doesn't really have a definition and is a fairly meaningless concept in real physics and largely exists only in misguided high-school textbooks.

The closest thing in real physics is ""phases"" but phases are not holistic nor mutually exclusive and also liquid and gas are not different phases (just look at a phase diagram you can ""walk"" a liquid to a gas over the critical point without ever crossing a phase transition)."
physicsmemes,fde7t1k,t3_ekv3ud,1578333062.0,"""States of matter"" is something that high school teachers have strong dogmatic opinions about but real physicists are like ""what does that even mean?""

It literally is probably the biggest example of the schism of ""knowing a lot"" and ""knowing a little"" in physics. It comes from an attempt to make the science of physics sound like a collection of ""factlets"" rather than understanding coming from a concrete, but abstract, conceptual and mathematical set of formalisms. I have no idea what a ""state of matter"" is and I have no idea how one could assemble a list that: a) has a countable number, and b) that number is going to be anywhere near 3.

What is a ""state""? Is it a ""phase""? I mean just within the sub-category of electronic phases, within the sub-category of that of magnetic phases, within the sub-category of that of spin-liquid phases there are... like... hundreds of them, if I recall? But more to the point a phase implies a phase transition and one can take a liquid to a gas without crossing a phase transition (go around the critical point)... so liquid and gas aren't even different phases."
Physics,fde6t7z,t3_eku6zq,1578332445.0,"You're confusing Applied Math/Theoretical Physics(which doesn't really exist, btw) and applied math/theoretical physics. ""Applied Math"" is not just applying math.  It's a job title indicating a certain educational path, a certain set of skills and a certain sequence of university courses. It's a specific undergrad degree and a discipline within a math department. 

They take different courses with different focuses (foci?) and surround themselves with different colleagues and prioritize different approaches.

Furthermore, ""Theoretical Physics"" isn't something that really exist. At least it's an INCOMPLETE descriptor of an actual person or area of study.  You need to specify TWO things, the first is the AREA of physics (particle physics, condensed matter, AMO, biophysics, polymer physics, etc.) and then the TOOLBOX you use to investigate it (experimental, theoretical, computational). Calling someone a ""theoretical physicist"" is something Hollywood made up and they approximately use it to mean something like ""theoretical particle physics"" or ""quantum gravity theorist"" or something. But in reality you can have ""theoretical polymer physicists"" who uses math to study, say, the phase transitions that long, chain molecules undergo and ""experimental cosmologists"" exploring dark matter through measurement.

There is also, for example, Mathematical Physics which if your only understanding of the meaning of these things is literally parsing the English words seems pretty interchangeable with ""applied physics"" and ""theoretical physics"" but again it's a pretty specific set of skills and interests which may have SOME overlap but is largely distinct."
