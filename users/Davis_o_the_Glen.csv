[https://spioenkop.blogspot.com/2019/07/that-time-soviet-howitzers-were-used-as.html]

The main ammunition types for a D-30 gun would be completely useless in an anti-aircraft role.  As far as I can see, there aren't even any fuzes for the projectiles that would be appropriate for this role.  Please supply information for the fuze which would permit the projectile to ""air burst"".  The Russian RGM series fuzes are all point detonating.

Attempting to use the D-30 in this role achieved the results expected.

The officer holding the assault rifle has the barrel section of a device *most commonly referred to*  as the ""Vorsatz P"" attached.  It was intended that ""Vorsatz P"" devices  would be installed in the roofs of armored vehicles, as a means of close  in protection from infantry assault.  Basically, the device consisted  of the barrel as seen here, a ball mount \[similar to those already seen  elsewhere on some tanks\], and an associated periscopic sight.

Documentation  on the history of the ""Vorsatz P"" \[later referred to as ""Vorsatz Pz""\]  is not complete.  Both of the above curved barrel projects commenced  sometime in the middle of 1944.  Such evidence as does exist suggests  that perhaps several hundred of the 90 degree curved barrels were made,  and no documentation currently exists to *confirm* that any of the *necessary*  periscopic sights were even designed, let alone assembled.  How many of  the completed items may have ever actually been fitted to vehicles, at  this time, would appear to be nothing more than conjecture.

To  date, I've seen no verifiable photographs of any vehicles in combat  fitted with the intended production device.  There are photos  circulating of a pre-production test fixture, with assault rifle  attached, in a museum display, as well as a unit installed in a piece of  steel or armor plate.  There is also at least one allied photograph,  showing just the ball mount, with rifle attached, lying on a bench or  floor.

The 90 degree curved barrel  was never intended for use by infantry for ""firing around corners""  because... physics guys.  Those of you who are firearms shooters can  easily imagine why.

The device  lying on the table is an example of the ""Vorsatz J"" attachment, designed  for infantry use, to allow infantry to fire from cover.  This had a  barrel angled at 30 degrees, and a prismatic sight for the operator.  As  with the ""Vorsatz P/ Vorsatz Pz"" devices, there is no documentation  currently available which can confirm that any of the ""Vorsatz J"" were  issued to troops.  It was tested with a grenade launcher, which is  attached to the unit shown on the table in this photo.

Ongoing  tests had not been completed with either of the above unusual  attachments before the end of the war, so no decision had been made  about continuing with development of the ""Vorsatz P"", or the issue to  troops of the ""Vorsatz J"".  An unverified number \[probably less than 50\]  ""Vorsatz J"" had apparently been completed for tests, but not delivered  to the appropriate authorities.

Because  numbers of ""Vorsatz J"" for test had been completed, and obviously  captured, pictures of them are common, in isolation and attached to the  rifles for which they were intended \[attaching them to the weapon is  fairly intuative\].  Photos of the items in tests by the Germans, before  the end of the war, have often been  reproduced.  I've never seen a  complete ""Vorsatz P"" in a photograph.

Museum examples of the ""Vorsatz P"" appear to be much less common than those of the ""Vorsatz J"".

I  would welcome photos of either of these two devices, or other  verifiable information, that seems to suggest that they were actually  used in combat.  Bear in mind though, that the Germans had a very strict  process \[just like any other military\] for the design, testing,  approval, an issue of new equipment.  Most information I've seen, across  several decades of informal research, indicates that the testing  procedures for both of these devices was never completed.  The end of  the war simply overtook the project.

Much the same as the issue of telescopic sights for German assault rifles, they simply didn't have enough time to finish.

Any amount of beard creates a ""path of least resistance"" around the edge of a mask's face seal.  It unquestionably *will* compromise the protection your mask should provide.  Complicating matters, many masks often have a smell of their own, especially when new, that may obscure the trace smells of a contaminant ""getting past the edges""  of your mask.
I'm normally a lazy shaver but, when I was in the industry, it was a daily thing to have a good close shave.  Largely because I chose to do some function testing whilst wearing the gear myself.  I can't in good faith make a recommendation, as I've advised against beards with masks in the past.  This is particularly important, if you need to mask up before using a pesticide.
That said, there are many brands of masks/cartridges available, which are suitable for the uses you've mentioned.  Basically, you're looking for what's often referred to as an ""organic vapor and nuisance dust"" cartridge, but each manufacturer will have a specifically labelled product.  All must meet relevant standards for their intended use in Australia, and should be so marked.  There are disposable P2 masks made for the tasks your referring to.
But, I'm afraid, the facial hair may have to go.
Could you settle for just keeping the 'stache?

A P2 filter doubtless meets the regulatory requirement for ""acceptable"" protection from a ""maximum"" of the particulates in fire smoke.

However, the P3 will trap even smaller particles, providing even more protection from the constituent material in the smoke.

Within the design limitations and intended use of the filters, never feel reluctant to use a pre-filter \[your P2\] ahead of your P3 cartridge.  Also, you extend the life of your P3 by doing so.  As a rule, the pre-filters are relatively cheap/disposable and when you compare the cost and effectiveness of your P2 and P3 mask cartridges, the advantage of the P2/P3 combination is obvious.

If nothing else will serve, you can still use those pre-filters with a P2 cartridge.  They will still help extend the life of that cartridge.

Weighing the cartridges ""before"" and ""after"" can be even scarier \[especially in the case of your main P3 filter, because that would disclose the near invisible contaminants that filter had stopped you from inhaling.

""Minimum"" protection offered by filter/mask combinations is regulatory/legal concept.  Don't be reluctant to use the maximum available to you.  And, unless other circumstances prevent you from so doing, please, continue to do so!

Tarkov has a fairly brutal learning curve, so be prepared to die, a lot.  On reddit and elsewhere, there are lots of posts full of advice on how to improve your chances as a new player.  Do a bit of research.  Safe to say, sight unseen, that this game is simply unlike any FPS you've ever played.

There is an offline mode, which you should probably make use of, to familiarize yourself with the maps and environmental conditions \[ I think the way rain is handled, in game, has been excellent\].

Personally, I've decided that, ultimately, I'm just never going to have the time at my disposal to really ""git gud"".  But, ***there's no denying*** that Escape from Tarkov has more than met my expectations for a game of this genre.

A lot of ""shoot on sight"" philosophy exists within the player base, for a variety of reasons.  Be very careful about evaluating chance encounters with other players.  Be prepared to die in these encounters, from time to time, regardless of your own intent.

The  game is in extended beta, so bear in mind that outcomes may be different \[sometimes even from day to day\] from the last time you played.

There are plenty of Discord groups operating in Tarkov.  Some polite inquiries, and a little research, should point you to a few you may be able to join for support.

Again, the game is in beta, and still acknowledged as not ""perfect"" yet \[is any game, really?\].

stalker,fdctmj2,t3_ekneuc,1578283963.0,"I always favored the Bubble and Compass for equipping myself, occasionally supplemented by a Snowflake, containers permitting.

The Firefly, Flame, Goldfish, and Snowflake bring the highest prices but, of the four, the Firefly and Flame will appear the most often.

I always felt that your artifact loadout would be driven by what suit you were using, what shape it was in/ mods it had, and what anomaly environment\[s\] you were traveling through/to.

Keeping one each of the most powerful against a given anomaly, plus a couple of Bubbles would probably cover you for most environments.

As always, YMMV"

The wikipedia article makes mention of reliability, and I've read elsewhere that, once fairly well fouled \[I mean, imagine the cleaning rod for that!\] it was not unusual to have to manually cycle the action for each shot.  Probably not the easiest thing to keep clean in the field.  Magazine holds five rounds.  Given the vintage of the weapon, it may be sop not to load five rounds, so that the magazine spring wasn't stressed.

Other sources do state that the manual PTRD was much preferred.

They both turn up elsewhere, from time to time."

Australia is a huge country so, while we've had bushfire smoke in our air for months, we're at no direct risk.  We're in a suburb of the city, removed from the worst of it.  Spare a thought though, for all of those much worse off than we are, for whom the only real remedy is rain...

To me, ""Israeli Filter"" is/is becoming an unacceptably vague catch-all descriptor for something the **seller** \[obviously\] knows nothing about.

Not sure about elsewhere, but info including the manufacturer, use by date, and applicable \[local\] standards complied with must be in evidence on the body of the filter, in Australia.

Be aware that, for example, GOST \[Russian\] standards are not identical to those of the EU, UK, and Australia.

I'm having a difficult time finding any info on the filter illustrated on Kyng's site citing *whose standard* the filter complies with.  The online entry is also deficient in information.

Thread compatibility is also a concern \[reason for compliance information also\].
