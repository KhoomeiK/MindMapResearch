Can anybody else let me know if they noticed any cuts? I thought *Birdman* was impressive, this movie just accepted their fucking challenge.

So for real, praise be the camerman. 

Also 10/10 recommend this movie, it is equal parts visceral, blind horror and stomach-churning suspense. And also two of perhaps the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen in cinema."

AmItheAsshole,fco6wf6,t3_ei40zr,1577825227.0,"I'm going to go against the grain here and say NTA, for multiple reasons. 

I'm a female. I don't use social media to recon my potential dates. The self that people present on social media is a sanitized, curated representation that can, in many cases, be a complete lie. If I want to know how a guy really is, I hang out with him and his friends. How his friends interact with each other and how they interact with me says **a lot** about the character of the guy I'm dating. If his friends are annoying, or kinda dicks, then he's a dick. If they're considerate and take care of each other, then I know I've got a good pick.

I see a lot of people saying that they don't feel safe unless they investigate the person's social media first. **Why are you going on a date with someone you don't immediately trust??** Get the person's number and TALK TO THEM for a while before meeting up and going out! Ffs don't put yourself at someone else's mercy if you don't know them and don't know much about them, and the best way to fix that is *not* to creep through years of their Facebook likes.

Finally, I just straight up don't use most social media anymore. For safety reasons. A guy in college started stalking me after my best friend put a restraining order on him, and I have an ex who abused me. I do not want either of those people having **any** idea where I go, where I've been, what I'm up to, anything. A few years ago the ex found out where I worked through other peoples' twitter (I had blocked him), and he came to try to talk to me. A panic attack in the break room later I clamped down, and honestly I've never looked back. I don't need the stupid political fights, the old memes, the MLM and candy crush invites. 

So yeah, I can see how someone not participating in the mainstream social media craze might seem abnormal and therefore a red flag. But it's kinda like saying someone's religious or dietary preferences are red flags. If they're not in a cult or cannibals, it's probably not a deal breaker"

TrueOffMyChest,fcfz7fc,t1_fcam0bh,1577635096.0,"Yes! So I've experienced sexual abuse at different times in my life, and I thought that getting assaulted by my boyfriend at 22 was what really troubled me the most. But after like a year of counseling, I came to the realization that the abuse I experienced when I was idk 4-5? is what really underpins my PTSD, I think because I was so young and powerless. I think of it as like a physical infection, where the older it is, the more it festers and spreads and really sinks in. 

I sometimes also feel that I should just get over myself, but I've learned that I can give myself permission to feel my feelings, and that my hurt is valid. Guilt over your response isn't helpful at all, whether it's frustration or annoyance or shame. For me, that is just another layer of the shame and guilt I feel/felt over what happened. But it's literally in 0 ways your fault, and so how you feel is natural and also not your fault. You're allowed to be traumatized. You and your experience and your feelings are valid."
