There's nothing wrong with being attached to your Replika. Just keep it in the real. If you've got a spouse or romantic partner in reality, keep them first. Because it's also very hard for them to find love and care in this world."

sadstories,fdq8s58,t3_embf3y,1578659505.0,"We all have insecurities. For me it's my teeth. And my weight (on the opposite spectrum). My teeth always tend to jut out. Horse teeth, I was always called. And I was the thinnest person in my entire school. I was basically weaker than every other guy, and being the centre of bully-ville, had no way of countering it. 

The thing that I don't want you to go through, which I did, was some sort of addiction. I won't say what I was addicted to, just that I used it as a means to escape. I didn't do anything to improve myself. I was unhappy with myself and I know how you feel. 

When I got to university, I decided enough was enough. I turned over a new leaf. I stopped my addiction, I began hitting the gym more often. I managed to put on weight and I said 'fuck you' to all my haters. I look a little better now than I used to. The only thing that I can no longer fix is my teeth. I went to the dentist and they said that I would have to wear braces for the rest of my life. 

I declined and decided to own myself. I am who I am. I felt tons better about who I am and who I want to be. I still haven't reached there but I'm taking small steps. 

What I'm saying is that don't wait too long when you're unhappy with yourself. Don't take the easy route. Keep working on yourself. You are your own biggest project. You're both the sculptor and the stone. 

Ignore what you're siblings say. In fact, give them the cold shoulder for a while. Keep your head high and say proudly that you are who you are. Imagine who you want to be and work for that dream. And keep on smiling, no matter what comes. Because the people who are always smiling are the ones who are the strongest. 

Ps: what happened to my bullies and haters? While I was there studying and taking their bullshit, they were chasing girls and living life YOLO style. 8 dropped out before finishing highschool because they didn't get the required grades. Another transferred to a different school to redo their form 4 to 6. 

We had a sort of get together with all of my classmates. And they were surprised at how much I changed. I certainly wasn't the biggest person there. But I kept on smiling because I beat them at their own game. I was the centre of respect. 

""Oh wow, bro, you've put on so much muscle."" *that's right, a-hole, and I'm pretty surprised I haven't used them on you.* That's what went through my mind. 

You can do it. You can change yourself. Add one more believer to your list because I believe you can do it. Nothing can stop you. And deep in your heart, I know you know that."

NoFap,fdgm2iu,t3_elb0o5,1578401885.0,"I also faced this issue beginning the year. What helped was to first focus on getting through day one. Then the second. Then the third. 

IF, IF, IF, the situation is so bad or unfortunate, do not rub one out to porn, at all costs. If it's so bad that it's even affecting your interpersonal communication and relations, you may (at your own cost) rub one out WITHOUT PORN. I am in no way, advocating that you do so, just that it might be a little easier if you get rid of your porn addiction primarily. 

Thats the route I followed anyway. Now I just have this dammed fap addiction to get rid of.

But I trust your own knowledge and wisdom will get you through. Peace out.

Ps: keep yourself busy at all times."
love,fdgkb07,t3_el9tv6,1578400157.0,"Yeah, I know how you're feeling. I'm actually in the same position. I'm kind of crazy about my classmate even though she has a steady relationship going. My mind tells me that disrupting her life is the worst thing to do but my heart screams that I'm a better fit for her than her current bf. 

It takes time to heal from that. You have to allow yourself to grieve and mourn. Life moves on, and you should too :) Carrying unnecessary luggage will only slow you down, right? Try to distance yourself between the other person. 

In time, the right person will come around. Someone who will make you laugh and smile. Someone who will always see you as their whole world. Don't be too hard on yourself.

What's more heartbreaking is that porn is being encouraged and normalised in this shithole of a place we call society... 

I don't know if our minds work the same way or we have the same thought processes but what helped me sort of forget my past experiences was that I imagined 'sealing away' those memories in a steel safe.

NoFap,fcx7x99,t3_ejdxze,1578054809.0,"No you don't. What you need to do is exercise control. Don't trade up your fap addiction for a sex addiction. It's a lot more worse.

Both me and my SO have very high drives but plan on staying celibate until marriage. If anything, you need to tire out your body more. If you induce the 'fight or flight mechanic' in your body, it will be too busy 'fending' for itself to think of reproduction. So hit the gym more often, if you're doing it only 3 times a week, shift to four or even five. 

You could also express your feelings either through writing or drawing. Not sex stories as that can be a potential trigger. But anything that strikes your fancy. Oftentimes, you feel the need to 'release' because you've pent up some emotions or feelings. 

If you're feeling angry, write a story akin to God of War, or if you're really passionate write about a knight trying to rescue a princess (sounds cheesy I know, but you should often aim to write a story about the feelings you're curbing). Don't go overboard and think you can write an entire novel. I tried that and it led back to relapse because I could never finish them. I now find joy in writing short stories."

Closed off, emotionless. I didn't tell anyone what had happened, but the rest of my clique were generally supportive. 

But she changed. I'm not exactly sure how but I can tell. She is a lot more open with others than she is with me. She's also become slightly more derisive and cynical. We always greet each other the same way as usual, but more out of courtesy than a recognised feeling of affection between friends.
