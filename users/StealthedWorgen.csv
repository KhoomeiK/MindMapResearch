Stellaris,fenkgdf,t3_eq49bv,1579286608.0,"Sol and Deneb are unique and are always the same. The star types and names for Sol will be the same for 52 stars (or more for the medium or large sol start), but what you find in those stars is randomized, with the exception of alpha centauri which will ALWAYS have your guaranteed habitable planet (if you have that set).

If you pick the sol starting system, United nations of earth cannot spawn. Same for deneb and commonwealth of man. 

And no the premade empires are identical to any empire you can personally make.

Humans may have some unique events, but if there are they are insignificant and wont provide any bonus unique to humans."
