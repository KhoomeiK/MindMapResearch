The rules are there to let people compete to the highest level with minimum possible risk of permanent injury. But, that only works if your opponent respects the rules and adheres to them.

Nothing can un-do what happened to your friend sadly, only severe consequences for people who don't fight fair can reduce the likelihood.

Obviously accidents happen, people can be caught unexpected and injuries caused but it's usually very obvious whether it was planned with intent to hurt or an unlucky happening of it playing out.

The latter, temp ban from competing for a while, those scenarios shouldn't happen as you get more experienced so can work through positions in a controlled, safe way.

The former, the competitor who knows he scoop them up but either doesnt know how to get them down safely or doesnt care, wants to drop them.

I'm of the opinion it should just be a straight up lifetime ban from all sports of comparable nature for people like that. They're trying dangerous moves on people not expecting them, possible not even done any training on how to spot it and avoid/regain control - why would you waste time practicing defending an illegal move..

(Just a long time enthusiast with quite some time on mats, around the world, meeting all different wonderful people practicing their form, however it was called).

  


I remember learning to hit the ground (htg) It sucked. Sucked a little less on one side but still sucked on both.

Then learnt to htg when unbalanced, starting in unnatural positions (sitting on a bar stall like in a pub. Or in a small bathroom with 2 other people (like in a pub). In a busy carpark, gravel floor, poor lighting.

All that was just doing it yourself - no one else touching or doing anything (except tying to stop you tap a car if you mocked up).

Then later, much later, you'd do all the same with a partner. Starts off them guiding nice and slow, leads you to your line you want, sorted. Then they lead s ittle less or s little more. Lead a little left or right when you were going straight.

Lead towards the car then spins you round so roll off the side. Would have been cool except I trying to circle back the other way to slap him , not end up in a puddle on my knees.

And it just keeps stepping up and up as you're ready for it - unpredictable attacks, weapons, variable angles, multiple together. Criteria for neutralising an opponent because more technical (and accurate,). Before, any reasonable manipulation into a trap or vice would be ok. Now, well, when you do that, they stand up and come at you with bat in the other hand.

Now it's not rehearsed what you'll do to each other, but you have practiced over and over, engrained in your muscle memory and instinctive reaction responses. He can grab, throw and toss you all around the mat over and over, you're going to be fine.

None of that means shit if they break the rules and dump you on your head

And frankly most articles about it, whether it's about Bezos or someone else, often don't clarify or explain. That wouldn't help sensational titles.

But, his net worth does give him unparalled buying power which is probably as good as cash for high value things.

This is my understanding of how it can work from what I've read, if someone has experience/knows this is wrong, I'll edit to correct: He doesn't need to pay several hundred million dollars in cash if he doesnt have it on hand to commission a new boat, his bank can do it for him then deduct it over whatever period from the returns across his portfolio. He is essentially risk free to loan to because he has so massive value of assets as collateral.

We'll never know unfortunately but it would be fascinating to see even a redacted overview of how his wealth is distributed - we know about Amazon obviously and any number of investments and stakes in companies and ventures in places like the USA, but there's going to be huge amounts spread across various places providing tax havens, highly secretive banks that only cater to the mega rich (some of the Swiss banks?). Do we know what else they use/do that's designed for the mega rich?

There was a document leak not too long about that had info about a money management company who specialise in doing this stuff. Lots of politicians, celebs etc using them.

I think (personal opinion only, admittedly based on very simplistic understanding) one of the biggest issues is the often unwavering loyalty to the ideology rather than the reality.

It's not dissimilar to the divisiveness of support and patriotism to the flag and the military. You can't be anti-war without being branded unpatriotic. Not wanting to risk the lives of the brave people who chose to serve is seen as disrespectful.

Pro-gun or ""liberal commie who wants to steal our guns and deny our constitutional rites"". Not ""enough already with constant school shootings"".

Pro-life vs pro-choice. One side defends the rights absolutely regardless of the circumstances, the other wants to murder innocent babies.

People need to be more open and accepting of different opinions and have to recognise that compromise and middle ground agreements are the only realistic way of moving forward.

Better for both sides to leave a negotiation equally unhappy when the only alternative is one side conceding completely."

Futurology,fekkzev,t1_fekgcqx,1579202227.0,"Pretty much - people justifiably critisize Apple for having proprietary chargers. At least with magsafe Apple had a valid argument for keeping it; despite the questionable durability of the charger cable, the port itself was very durable and the ease of plugging in and out was awesome.

Similarly they had a valid reason to use the port in iPhones (not sure what it's called..,) previously there was no standard for a reversible port that could carry the required power and data speeds.

But now there's really no excuse. Even more so when they've transitioned to USB-C on some of their products.

The EU signed an MoU some years ago, in 2014/15 I think, to pressure/encourage a standardised charger for phones - it (probably?) helped encourage the quick adoption by the majority of the little USB most used but it was not a legal requirement to conform. That MoU is expiring so they're looking at it again.

But it's necessarily a good thing to do - technology can develop and change very fast where as legislation, particularly for the EU, does not. Why should they prevent a company introducing a superior port (or whatever) because the law says they have to use a particular one."

It's great people doing it in all different places because it's indisputably a good thing to do, no controversy, no agenda, just helping repair and restore some of the damage that's been caused.

OP meme is funny highlighting the relatively low numbers from the tree team group which continues to get loads of coverage and support. Pakistanis been doing this for some time, it's a huge success, next phase will be huge, but little coverage or awareness programming from the media.

They're all doing a great thing, dont focus on one group/team to distort viewers perfection to focus on just one group / Org. It's a disservice to the many others doing the same or similar.

There's a range of models being tested, used, reviewed, etc.

\* Some are going gangbusters just plant as many trees as you can to keep those counters high. Absolutely still a good thing to do. Lots of wooded areas have a single dominant tree, everything else falls into place under it. Tiniest risk of course being single primary crop but much less variables to consider and manage so reduced process revision overheads. But always limimited by the environment, - there are ecosystem that thrive with a single dominant type but they environmental requirements can be quite particular and the typically not very robust to handling alien interference (aliens bring flora, fauna, animals, insects, etc) - most won't take hold. Some targeted weeding and insecticides and deterrents should minimize the risk. To what extent, no idea. Also no idea what the threshold is for acceptable level of alien activity, when what is unacceptable and must be purged / removed.

\* Some are slower paced but more methodical on dispersing patterns, selecting particular trees for particular areas where they have increased chance of maturing in a targeted microbiome that is best for a particular tree. They assess the immediate surrounding area, looking for what does not belong, and what does belong but is not here

Perhaps a balanced system they've not seen before. 

Or one where the outcome is know, the new has overwhelmed the old, through whatever means.

More efficient and aggressive root structure would overwhelm resource gathering, not leaving enough for the old who will spread away to potential space, grow, only to be caught up again.

  


I'm not an expert in this field by measure, experience or high level education, just from s basic understanding from watching documentaries on woodland and rainforest management.

  


No question though, anyone doing works like this, no matter how big or small, should be recognised for it. These are some of the things we the people can do help slow down the accelerating frequency of changes in our climates.

We can't afford to wait for UN and Government policy to be done in time and be effective, if at all.

Actions like these help promote awareness of the issues with minimal naysayjng or criticism because there's no tagline to latch onto to berate those people.

They prove that people **can** do things to help, not just stop using plastic straws and choosing goods wrapped not in plastic. Again, both good to do, but the impact it has negligible. It's a straw man to distract from the big corporate level choosing not to compromise their bottom line over greener business practice.

But as more people do community works like this, it greatly helps to spread accurate information, demonstrates very viable and cost effective programs that should be deployed nationwide that cant be blocked by the deniers and obstructionist.

Planting trees isn't going to solve the problem, not by a long shot, but it sure is good to revitalise the ecosystems improve the air quality, provide play areas for kids in woods and forest,, new walking trails etc. Most importantly of all, the community spirit, solidarity together making the area of your home a nicer, cleaner, better place for all to enjoy.

And trees are cool. Just that's enough too. If you've got a yard, plant a tree. Several if you've got space. Check with someone who knows what would be suitable for your place then go at it.

Not all providers of course - certainly in the UK a lot of banks are actually pretty good about trying to help people manage their finances better through their apps and online stuff. Ineffective if you dont take a minute to look though.

I looked at Nimble recently, a debit card provider aimed at teenagers getting their first card. The system let's parents monitor/restrict the card usage a little so they can't blow their balance on one thing or buy from unsuitable places, then for the kid it makes suggestions about budgeting based on typical debits and credits, suggests moving a little over to a saving account when possible etc.

Wonder if there's a market for something similar for adults where the providers team could act like the parents - talk to the card user about where their money goes, how to spend more efficiently etc."

\* Would the main attraction (the .. dead person).. want them to be there, and if so, why.

Anyone should come if they had a positive relationship that the deceased (doesnt have to be perfect, positive is must fine) and that by going it might help them and or the others who are also there.

Funerals offer closure for some, comfort in shares grief for others, reunions of lost friends who help stop your mind stagnating on only one thought and emotion.

I wouldn't expect or demand anyone at mine, come if you want, dont if you dont, no shame or wrong at all. Some folks just dont feel a positive result from them which is fine, leave them be.

But if you were someone who hurt me, caused immense pain, then fucked off out of my life? Made mo attempt set things straight or right over how many years.

If you are that person, you absolutely no right to be at this funeral. People thst think you do should put aside their loyalties for 1 second and ask ""would the person in the ground want him here?. No they wouldn't. Fuck off. You dont get to use my funeral, there for the people I loved and who loved me, as an opportunity to get some closure on your fuck ups. You had years to do it but didn't.


If I had s positive relationship with you, profound or fleeting, you're all welcome. And try no offence taken if you don't come. Anyone who judges or comments you for just, if I could adjust the lists (I'm dead st this point so csnt,) would be given 1wt and final earning that will not be tolerated at all. Next offence is immediate removal from the venue by trained security team

(OP, really good way to prepare for that - if not needed no big. Whe needed, you and your family not being doing the actual escorting is definitely classy and safer. Reduces risk of things escalating and if they do, those guys are trained to handle it so it shouldn't get messy.

Funerals are for people to come together to share the pain and support each other. For some, it is very cathartic. For others, of no help but there's expectations of being there.

I don't want anyone who my lasting impression of them was them fucking up my life and causing me pain to come. They don't deserve the opportunity for closure, for a public scene showing remorse.

If they truly felt that, they'd have reached out before the death, made an attempt, effort, to apologise sincerely, try to rebuild any sort of relationship, if possible. Doesnt have to be close or intimate, even a ""little complicated before but we doing better now"" is plenty. ""Dont want to rip his dick off and chuck it in the chese toaster anymore"" is a huge step!

Some beef and bullshite can be toned down if both sides are willing to try.

Of course, some situations are just too fucked,, too much history, too much intensity, too much high risk high reward type thinking going on. These, unless you have absolutely certainty you hold the moral, ethical and legal win conditions, you should give them a free demo of your up coming roaming dance comp,'s "" , normally best to just amble away a little, diffuse as much as you can,
