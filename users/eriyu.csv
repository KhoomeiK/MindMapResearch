[The chart in this article](https://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i37/Breaking-Plastic-Bag-Habit.html) found that it's only 8 times, for example;the study at the beginning of [this article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/paper-plastic-reusable-tote-bag-environment_n_5cd4792ae4b0796a95d88b5f) claims it's ""thousands of times."" Other studies will have myriad other numbers, and there are so many variables, from what type of reusable bag you have, to what you do with your plastic bags, that a single number is absolutely not going to be universal.

If I have one conviction on the subject though, it's to make sure you get reusable bags that are strong enough to last more than a few uses â€” especially if you tend to overfill them like I do. I've had the straps tear off [these kind](https://www.customearthpromos.com/media/catalog/product/r/e/recycled-woven-tote-bags-rb17.jpg), the plastic ones, and then they're certainly not serving any environmental purpose."

As far as intelligence specifically, the fact is that despite genetic components, it's a poor indicator of someone's educational achievement, or the quality of said education, and that's why I said ""no 'smart gene pool' *in the equation*.""

I don't think it's helpful in any way to assign people strict ""good"" or ""bad"" labels; you're right that life's not black and white, but you do have to hold people with that sort of prejudice to higher standards than they're at if you want the world to be a better place.
