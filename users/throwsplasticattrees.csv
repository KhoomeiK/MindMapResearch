Showerthoughts,fedi8wj,t1_fechgwj,1579012203.0,"The purpose of autopay is to ensure the bill is paid at the correct time in the correct amount.  I use Mint to manage my finances, so I am constantly checking my account activity.  If nothing is awry, then I let the autopay go forward.

Stuff like the mortgage, car insurance, cell phone, cable/internet that do not change the payment monthly are easy to autopay, not much to check.  The credit card however, is a bill that Cha he's based on spending, but having it set to autopay the balance ensures that I won't miss the payment and incur late fees or interest.

But ultimately, when someone is taking your money, you best make sure they don't take more then they're owed."

personalfinance,fdsdjoy,t1_fdrm0ct,1578700193.0,"Oh, I completely recognize and accept that I my spending on my dog seems ridiculous.  But, my wife and I elected not to have children, and our spending on our dog pails in comparison to the cost of raising a child or children.  And the last part of my comment was the most important: we have the financial means to provide all of that to our dog without any detriment to our family budget.

But my point was that my experience supports the notion that having a dog is a car payment.  And frankly, I spend more per month on my 2017 Subaru Forester than my dog.  So for less than Subaru money, I get Bentley dog - good if you ask me."
personalfinance,fdqhd2m,t1_fdqf3ru,1578666699.0,"Depends on the size of the dog.  My 110lb Rhodesian Ridgeback eats almost $200/mo in food alone.  His neuter surgery was $500.  We have seen the vet several times when he has eaten something he shouldn't (fortunately no surgeries needed) each visit several hundred dollars.

Add in costs for training, dog walking, boarding when we travel.  We have an insurance plan to mitigate emergency costs.  It is a car payment.  We easily spend a few thousand dollars a year on him.  He is worth every penny, he has enriched my life far more than the money could have. However, I was unaware of how expensive a dog would be and I consider myself fortunate that we have the financial means to support him without any detriment to our family budget."
