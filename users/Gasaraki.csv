AskReddit,fcnefa7,t1_fcnbc5t,1577810003.0,"If the US and Russia really teamed up, the US will first focus on Canada and Mexico, Russia will have to focus on Europe and China. Once the US finishes with Canada, they can send some help to the European theater meanwhile finishing up Mexico and South America. Russia will probably get pretty beat up by both China and Europe in the meantime, until winter. The US will open up a second front in Europe and Russia will get a breather on their western front allowing troops to reinforce the eastern front, which was pushed in from China.

The US will try to gain a foothold in Japan but the Japanese put up a valent defense. Due to Japan's mountainous terrain and Japanese fighting style, the US suffer heavy loses. 

It will take the US and Russia a long time to conquer the world and there will be constantly ""terrorist"" attacks."
