So they are clearly not pricing their labor effectively, and we the taxpayers are making up the difference via taxes.

The process of breaking them down for spare parts and scrap metal is extremely dangerous and environmentally disastrous. Unfathomable quantities of toxic chemicals and garbage are spilled into the oceans in the process.

This is one of the things people talk about when they say we need top level political change to help protect the environment. It's all well and good for individuals to drive less, buy less, use fewer plastic bags, etc. But this is a huge industry that only exists because of the lack of top-down regulations to prevent it. Change needs to happen at the highest corporate and political levels. If western nations would get together and agree to a minimum standard of cleanliness and worker conditions, it would improve the situation dramatically. So of course that won't happen, and the race to the bottom will continue."
todayilearned,fca3ivs,t1_fc93sao,1577562552.0,"Re: Chinese food. There are 3.8 million Chinese in the US. There are tons of authentic restaurants from many different regions: Sichuan, Beijing, Shanghai, Cantonese, Hunan just to name a few within close range of me. (I don't think any of them serve orange chicken with a straight face.) Also close by me right now are authentic Ethiopian food, Afghani, Lebanese, and Serbian, all run by first generation immigrants, plus plenty of Greek, Indian, and Thai places, of varying quality.

>There isn't really a true american dish that is impressive imo

Let's talk about barbecue for a minute. Memphis, Texas, Carolinas, Kansas, St. Louis, all have their own traditions. Savory or sweet sauces, dry rubs, mustards, type of smoke like hickory, mesquite, oak, maple, pecan; all unique to the region. Plus sides, baked beans, corn bread, corn on the cob, collared greens, mac n cheese, potato salad, the list goes on. 

Then there's bagels, pizza, cheesecake, and other food asociated with New York; Chicago style hot dogs and pizza, clam chowder in the New England region; cajun/creole food in New Orleans like jambalaya, gumbo, prawns, and pralines; chicken and waffles in the south; Tex-Mex in the southwest; Florida key lime pie; the list goes on and on.

Then there's all the foods from the new world, unique to the Americas: maize, potato, tomato (!), peppers, vanilla, corn, chocolate, pineapple, squash, more than I can list here. It isn't coincidence that those are staples in thanksgiving dishes: mashed potatos, yams, green bean casserole, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie, cornbread, pecan pie, and plenty more.

It's just plain ignorant to say American food doesn't turn pages in history.

>Stop your appropriation please

Come on, are you *trying* to sound like a triggered snowflake? It's food, it can be good or bad, just relax and enjoy."

Sorry to joke about your health issues, but this typo made me laugh. 

Mental health disorders are recognized under the Americans with disabilities act. HR should know about this. My opinion is that you should commit to your health first, and aggressively pursue rehab to kick the drug habit, plus medication for the depression from a good doctor you trust, and counseling/therapy. There absolutely is help and treatment available that is actually quite effective (I know this from experience, not just saying it.)
