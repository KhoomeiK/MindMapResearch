devops,fe9zip5,t1_fe93r7p,1578942844.0,">I'm thinking that most of the time those 50 years olds with 30 years experience comprehend some things in a way that's beyond our current imagination.

Well, this isn't astro physics or rocket science. Nothing is beyond anyone's imagination as long as it's explained clearly. If you cannot explain it, I don't think you understand it well enough."
devops,fe5ijgk,t1_fe5alm3,1578869873.0,"I admire people like you. You give us hope that 50s isn't something to be dreaded like these guys show. Look at gates, buffet, etc. They're very much *in* the game. Like him or hate him, there's still a lot to take from Gates's Netflix documentary about how he tries to self motivate and keep working irrespective of age.

The dude above deleted his comment, but I'm guessing he said something like ""you'll be there one day"". I have no idea how someone can come up with that kind of defense. This is what we call corporate politics shit. You want to ass warm the chair but you don't want to spend learning new things and staying ahead of the curve. This is why DBAs are also slowly becoming a thing of the past.

Either I work for the ship as long as my body/brain permits or get out and give way for youngsters to take the steering."

The argument is VMs are doing what containers can. Why change? But the real reason is this guy is around his 50s and has no learning skills anymore in his life, is resistant to change just because he cannot catch up on the architecture of k8s. All his years of experience would be a joke in him if he is on par with some fresh graduate learning/working on the same skill. He thinks he'll lose the edge of command. He's scared his position will be in danger if we move away from the age old stack of EC2, chef, Jenkins, etc.

Also a fixed mentality of don't fix something that's not broken."

For next time, try reading or watching some videos about negotiations. Few things I'd have done,

1. Set deadlines - ""Hi, I'll wait until 23rd 6pm for a yes or no from you. If I don't hear from you, I'll assume this isn't a right fit. Will that be okay with you?""

2. Be assertive

3. Run a quick cap off all outcomes and your moves even before you start interviewing. This includes everything like salary, benefits, location, etc. Some of which could be very imp and some not so much, but good to know where the employer stands."

Also, read up on the XY problem.

Google it before you ask.

Have all information handy.

Instead of how do I do XYZ? Ask - I'm trying to do ABC. I did DEF so far, but that doesn't seem to work. What am I doing wrong?"
