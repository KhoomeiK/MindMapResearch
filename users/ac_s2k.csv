WatchPeopleDieInside,ff2eqgd,t3_er5azp,1579503079.0,"This is the wrong way of introducing a new cat to a home with a cat already. See this stuff done all the time. You should have the house kitty in one room and then let the new kitty explore another room for a while. Then swap them without then seeing each other, and let them get used to this other cats scent. Then let them meet"

MitsubishiEvolution,feunhkc,t1_feuf0yw,1579388249.0,Yeah I‚Äôve heard a lot about the import laws in the US. Wasn‚Äôt it almost impossible to get an R33/R34 skyline into the US?
MitsubishiEvolution,feu9nst,t1_feu8w22,1579384511.0,"I used a company based near me who do the importing direct from a Japanese performance car auction. I just paid for the car. They sorted the shipping out. Only thing I had to do was wait 4 weeks for the car to be legally registered in the UK once it had arrived, and to get the new ownership document and plates fitted. 
Apart from the time it took, there were no hoops"

MitsubishiEvolution,feqt40o,t3_eqf5ei,1579345694.0,"Ever since I first saw an evo 5 when I was a kid, I knew I wanted one. Then the 8 came out and it became the #1 dream car for me. Finally bought one. It‚Äôs a Japanese import (I‚Äôm in UK) and came completely stock. So far I‚Äôve swapped out the stereo for a UK one, double din stock on JDM evos. And I‚Äôve had a custom exhaust built and installed. I came from an S2000 which was amazingly fun, but the evo is just scary fast in comparison and handles like a dream"
