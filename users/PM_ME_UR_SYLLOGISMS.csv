AskReddit,ffayj3s,t1_ffaxwjy,1579747452.0,So that's what that's like.
Showerthoughts,ffay60j,t1_ffat40f,1579747215.0,In the words of one of my actual friends: 'Ya basic'. It's a human insult. It's devastating. You're devastated right now.

gaming,ff5ki9u,t1_ff4yzq8,1579597248.0,Nah. Most games don't need a mic and many of the ones that do can be played amongst friends. I'm not sure there are any games where sharing your voice with strangers is a necessity.
TumblrInAction,ff5kfpi,t1_ff5gsrd,1579597143.0,I agree. I just think police should be held to a high standard.

TwoXChromosomes,ff2cmoh,t1_ff2c99o,1579500817.0,Is it? I don't think they'd disagree that they're against being able to choose abortion.
TwoXChromosomes,ff2c6n0,t1_ff0kgtn,1579500361.0,That's a fair point but I think reframing things can have a positive effect on the debate.

MagicArena,fdpprpo,t1_fdot645,1578635925.0,Remember they have to plan a long way ahead. This means it will continue to be available even after Eldraine rotates out.
