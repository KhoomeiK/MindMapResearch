television,fcursi3,t1_fct0z41,1577987187.0,"Re: Ellen Page, isn't that the point though? She's been medicated and... other things... her whole life so that she she feels small and stunted. She had very few moments where her character actually feels anything, and those moments usually consist of an overwhelming but single emotion. 

I definitely agree about the dialogue and Mary J. Blige."
