For the past year and a half I have been working as my grandfather's private duty full time live-in caregiver. He has macular generation, dementia, high blood pressure, and an indwelling catheter due to a stricture from scar tissue from prostate cancer. He is actually relatively low care and mostly needs minor assistance with medication management, catheter care, and supervision. He is still able to do most of his own activities of daily living. I run the household for him. I actually have quite a bit of free time on my hands to pursue my hobbies and interests. I negotiated a salary of $4,500 a month for compensation with my uncle who is my grandfather's power of attorney. I contracted an in-home care agency staff to provide myself relief care staffing so that I can have normal weekends off. Although its a huge sacrifice of time and freedom on my part, the family agreed I was best suited to do this and that its the cheaper option to pay me rather than have my grandfather pay out of pocket upwards of $10K/month to be in a memory care assited living facility. He has a rather considerable  amount of assets and investment portfolios in the upper triple digits so the family sees paying me to be his caregiver as safegaurding the family inheritance which is set to be evenly dispersed across trust funds for all the grandchildren (including me). I have been working as a caregiver for close to 20 years and have done my fair share of hard work over the years working in the adult foster care system, in-home health care, and assisted living facilities. Now my days are very relaxing and stress free. The only bills that I have is my car insurance, internet, cell phone, and personal food and necessities. The bulk of my money goes straight to investments of my own. I feel pretty blessed to have this opportunity."

legaladvice,feihwtr,t3_epbhsc,1579138921.0,"Typically visitors are not allowed to spend more than two consecutive weeks (fourteen days) within a six month period. 

Some leases make a distinction between overnight stays, so even if you were to visit every day, unless you were sleeping there every night, it would not count towards the fourteen days within a six month period.

If a guest stays a significant amount of time, usually for 30 consecutive days, they legally become an occupant. 

The set amount of days a guest can be allowed is specified in the lease, which your boyfriend should have a copy of to review. The number of days allowed varies from state to state, and even city to city for jurisdiction.

In all of my years of renting, I have never heard of or seen a lease that stipulates a tenant may only have a visitor over for only seven days out of the calendar year. Unless you are not staying there for 7 days straight on overnights, there should be no problem or issue with you spending time with your boyfriend. It is most definitely not a Federal Law.

Unless you intend on moving in and living with your boyfriend, under no circumstance should you sign a lease.

Here are the actual [Landlord-Tenant laws for the State of Pennsylvania](https://www.thelpa.com/PA_landlord_tenant_act.pdf)

>Section 250.504-A. 
>Tenant’s rights
>The tenant shall have **a right to invite to his apartment or dwelling unit** such employees,
business visitors, tradesmen, deliverymen, suppliers of goods and services, and the like **as
he wishes** so long as **his obligations as a tenant** under this article are **observed.** The tenant
also **shall have right to invite** to his apartment or dwelling unit, **for a reasonable period of time**,
such **social guest, family or visitors** as he wishes so long as his obligations as a tenant under
this article are observed. These **rights may not be waived by any provisions of a written rental
agreemen**t and the landlord and/or owner **may not charge any fee, service charge or
additional rent** to the tenant for exercising his rights under this act.

The keyword here is **reasonable amount of time**

Yes, there is. Your dad should immediately take control of the finances. What he should do is take your grandma to her bank and get his name added to her bank account. He should be the one responsible for paying her household bills. He can issue a check to your aunt for household needs (groceries, etc) and stipulate that all receipts go to him for expense tracking. He should also asap have any ATM cards canceled. Another thing to consider, is your aunt your grandma's primary caregiver? Does she receive compensation/wages for doing this? Does she have any other sources of income? The reason I ask is if she if the full time caregiver, how is she getting paid for this? Has she been paying herself out of your grandma's account? Is she registered with agency/state/county to get paid or is she considered a private duty caregiver hired directly by your grandma? It is possible to hire an in-home care health care agency to provide care, or to go through a state or county program to get services. This is something that DHS social services can help you with."

legaladvice,fdimejv,t3_elkkvw,1578446148.0,"[Elder financial abuse](https://www.sec.gov/files/elder-financial-exploitation.pdf) is a type of elder abuse in which misappropriation of financial resources or abusive use of financial control, in the context of a relationship where there is an expectation of trust, causes harm to an older person.

The Older Americans Act of 2006 defines elder financial abuse, or financial exploitation, as “the fraudulent or otherwise illegal, unauthorized, or improper act or process of an individual, including a caregiver or fiduciary, that uses the resources of an older individual for monetary or personal benefit, profit, or gain, or that results in depriving an older individual of rightful access to, or use of, benefits, resources, belongings, or assets.”

Family members and informal or paid caregivers have special access to seniors and thus are often in a position to inflict financial abuse through deception, coercion, misrepresentation, undue influence, or theft. Common abusive practices include:

Money or property is used without the senior's permission or taken from them, for example removal from their home and then use of the home by the abuser, or depositing income such as pension or benefit checks

The senior's signature is forged or identity is misappropriated for financial transactions

The senior is coerced or influenced to sign over deeds or wills, or caused to execute legal documents they do not understand

The abuser fraudulently obtains a power of attorney or guardianship
Money is borrowed from the senior and never repaid

Family members engaged in financial abuse of the elderly may include spouses, children, or grandchildren. They may engage in the activity because they feel justified, for instance, they are taking what they might later inherit or have a sense of ""entitlement"" due to a negative personal relationship with the older person, or that it is somehow the price of a promise of lifelong care. Or they may take money or property to prevent other family members from getting the money or for fear that their inheritance may be lost due to cost of treating illnesses. Sometimes, family members take money or property from their elders because of gambling or other financial problems or substance abuse.

Hybrid Financial Exploitation (HFE) is financial exploitation that co-occurs with physical abuse and/or neglect. HFE victims are more likely to be co-habiting with abusive individual, to have fair/poor health, to fear the abusive individual, to perceive abusive individual as caretaker, and to have a longer duration of abuse.

Two of the most wealthiest people I know with assets in the double digit millions are also the most frugal people I know. My grandfather is one those of the people. The other is a family friend.

The family friend grew up poor and was of modest means. When he was in his twenties, he purchased a 20 acre parcel of rural land. He ended up leasing that land out to a nearby farmer who down the road made a offer. He then took that money and purchased more land and also a residential home which he flipped. That led to more land and more house flipping. He now has millions in real estate ranging from pent houses in New York City to rental properties all across the United States. You would never know it. He lives in a small 10 acre farm with a really modest cabin, his vehicles are all used late model trucks that he pays cash for. He is extremely frugal although his only real vice is collecting artwork. I have no idea what the value or extent of his collection is, but he has more paintings than wall space.

My grandfather made his money farming. He had a very large cane crop operation that grossed around $300K a year. He raised everything from Marion Berries to Black Berries to Logan Berries on a 60 acres. He always did well for himself. 16 years ago he retired and sold his farm to his neighbor for $900,000. He took that and bought a modest three bedroom ranch style house on one acre in a residential neighborhood in a small town for $120K cash. He also made a series of good investments. His property today is now worth $500K. His investment portfolios is in the upper double digit millions. My grandfather is a very simple, modest man. The only money he spends is his social security check which is about $1,200/month. He never dips into his investments unless absolutely necessary. The only vehicle he drove was a 1994 Ford F-150 custom which is beat to hell - it was his farm truck and he continued to use it as his daily driver until he couldn't drive anymore. His health has now taken a turn, as well as other age related things, but he has had a very comfortable retirement, and a considerable amount of assets in place to address his health care needs.

legaladvice,fd64fz2,t1_fd54gsv,1578185393.0,"You did not mention which state/country you live in! The 'Prohibited Acts' charge varies state to state.

Always plead ""not guilty"". If you can not afford lawyer, you can request a public defender. I was also just thinking something here - if you have never touched or handled the paraphernalia, your fingerprints won't be on it. When you get a lawyer lined up, I would bring this point up and have the bong tested for fingerprints. Also, get yourself a certified drug test asap from a lab. This may help your defense proving that you don't use illegal substances which could help with the possession charge. However, you will still be on the hook for allowing illegal activities and improper supervision to take place within your residence.

If you have a public defender or attorney working for you, you may have a good fighting chance.

Best case scenario, they drop the charge for 'Prohibited Acts'. That particular charge has to do with simple possession of a controlled substance (felony or misdemeanor-level); possession with the intent to distribute; delivery of a controlled substance; or manufacturing of a controlled substance.  

The possession charge is kinda iffy: It is unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to possess marijuana unless the substance was obtained directly from, or pursuant to, a valid prescription or order of a practitioner while acting in the course of his professional practice, or except as otherwise authorized by the Drug Control Act.

What your lawyer may propose is to have you plead guilty to the Possession Charge. Because you have no prior arrests, good driving record, good grades, etc., all of this will be taken into consideration for sentencing. Some states use a matrix which is an algorithm that determines your level of risk to re-offend. A good lawyer will get the judge to give you a [Bench Probation with Suspended Imposition.](https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/suspended-imposition-of-sentence-sis/) This is the best possible outcome for you outside of charges being dismissed or being acquitted at a jury trial."

The law effectively is a wage increase for salaried employees. What was happening was that a significant number of salaried employees were working an excess of 40 hours in a week and not receiving enough compensation.

If they put you as a salaried employee, you should be receiving the federal minimum which would be a wage increase with no overtime. However, if they pay you less than the federal minimum, then they have to pay overtime.

As a teacher, you are exempt from the overtime requirement. Your employer does not need to pay over time.

That has always been the case for most teachers. My ex-partner is an AMA certified Montessori Guide working in private schools. She was always on a contract with a negotiated salary and that was her wages regardless of the work she put in outside of the classroom.  None of the teachers I have known were ever payed for their time outside of the classroom for grading papers, preparing materials, running errands, etc. For your company to pay you overtime for those hours is an exception to the rule.

To give you another example, I used to be employed as a Traffic Control Supervisor for a Traffic Control Management Company and I had a take home company vehicle and was dispatched from my home to various work sites. I was responsible for maintaining the vehicle, equipment, and completing paperwork.

 I was paid hourly at $32.50/hour. I was not ever paid for time off the job outside of the work zone location to complete my other duties revolving around the vehicle. 

At the end day, I still had to stop and refuel the truck, reorganize the equipment, clean the truck inside and out, take the truck in for maintenance when needed, complete my paperwork and do a mail drop to send paperwork to the main office which was 60 miles away from my home. 

These were all essential duties necessary to do my job, however I received a substantial pay increase to my hourly rate as compensation, as well as having a company issued vehicle to use for transportation for work purposes and a company issued gas card."

wage for all hours worked and overtime pay at not less than time and one-half the regular rate of
pay for all hours worked over 40 hours in a workweek.
However, Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA provides an exemption from both minimum wage and
overtime pay for employees employed as bona fide executive, administrative, professional and
outside sales employees. Section 13(a)(1) and Section 13(a)(17) also exempt certain computer
employees. These exemptions are often called the “white-collar” or “EAP” exemptions. To qualify for
exemption, employees generally must meet certain tests regarding their job duties and be paid on a
salary basis at not less than $684* per week. Job titles do not determine exempt status. In order for
an exemption to apply, an employee’s specific job duties and salary must meet all the requirements
of the Department’s regulations.

Salary Basis Requirement

>To qualify for exemption, employees generally must be paid at not less than $684* per week on a
salary basis. These salary requirements do not apply to outside sales employees, teachers, and
employees practicing law or medicine. Exempt computer employees may be paid at least $684* on a
salary basis or on an hourly basis at a rate not less than $27.63 an hour.
Being paid on a “salary basis” means an employee regularly receives a predetermined amount of
compensation each pay period on a weekly, or less frequent, basis. The predetermined amount
cannot be reduced because of variations in the quality or quantity of the employee’s work. Subject
to exceptions listed below, an exempt employee must receive the full salary for any week in which
the employee performs any work, regardless of the number of days or hours worked. Exempt
employees do not need to be paid for any workweek in which they perform no work. If the employer
makes deductions from an employee’s predetermined salary, i.e., because of the operating 
2 requirements of the business, that employee is not paid on a “salary basis.” If the employee is
ready, willing and able to work, deductions may not be made for time when work is not available.
