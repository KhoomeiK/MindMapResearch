selfimprovement,feir34r,t1_feils3k,1579145082.0,I agree with everything you said in both comments and think its good advice. It was just funny the way you added the lazy & unmotivated descriptors at the end when warning people about improving every aspect of their life at once!
selfimprovement,feikf1d,t3_ep6tod,1579140588.0,"The last half of this post doesnt make sense. If there's a person who's working to improve EVERYTHING in their life, ALL AT ONCE, they aren't lazy and they def don't lack motivation."
unitedkingdom,feij1qo,t3_eoya2x,1579139669.0,Good. The more border checks the better.
unitedkingdom,fdlu1zm,t1_ev9c7qd,1578532494.0,Im honestly just here for the gang bang link. Can anyone help with that?
