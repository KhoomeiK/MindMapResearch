Imagine an electrical fitter of 30 years becomes an electrical engineer and then applies for a position at the power company they worked for. They know the company policies, equipment and probably people. I would say they would have a good shot over the young person. 

I would imagine any company that uses their new graduates as slave labor would not want an older person as they would be more likely to push back when asked to pull stupid hours for silly money etc. 

&#x200B;

I would personally do some serious research though if I was late 50s looking at retooling and probably choose a path that lacks graduates. I have completed two degrees already, one I never used and another I currently work in. The second one I finished early 30s. I would not consider more uni unless it was to do a masters between now and close to retirement. I would consider one when I hit that age though purely to keep the brain thinking but that would be it.

I will help you contextualize your personal existential understanding. If you work to 67 (which unless you are rich or die, will probably be the case), you have 40 years of work ahead of you. You have not even hit half way through your working years even if you retire at 55. A 3 to 4 year degree will take up 10 percent of your remaining working time, you will have 90 percent of your working time left to build a career with that degree. If you started and completed a degree at 18, it would have taken up about 8 percent of your remaining working career. Not much difference in your case. (hopefully my percentages are correct lol)."

 [The Guardian revealed on Tuesday](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/blanket-secrecy-surrounds-australian-weapons-sales-to-countries-accused-of-war-crimes) that the Australian government had approved the export of weapons to the Democratic Republic of Congo four times in 2018-19. It has also issued more than 80 weapons export permits to Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. 

**That link takes you to this article**

 [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/blanket-secrecy-surrounds-australian-weapons-sales-to-countries-accused-of-war-crimes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/blanket-secrecy-surrounds-australian-weapons-sales-to-countries-accused-of-war-crimes) 

""Nearly 100 permits were issued to export weapons and military technology to the United Arab Emirates, [Saudi Arabia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia), Sri Lanka and the Democratic Republic of Congo over the 2018-2019 financial year.""

**So in this original article they notate that the permits are for weapons and military technology. Which appears to be dropped in the article posted on this sub reddit where they simply call them weapons permits.**

**As far as I can tell the human rights groups are**  

Phil Lynch, the director of International Service for Human Rights - **a tweet about the original article and a direct comment to the guardian.** 

""Lynch told the Guardian international human rights law was clear: the Australian government and companies had a duty to protect human rights and to ensure that their goods, products, services and supply chains were not implicated in human rights violations.""

Paul Ronalds, The chief executive of Save the Children Australia - **appears to have made a statement directly to the guardian**

**With regards to secretly exporting arms I cannot find where it says that human rights groups ""**claim that Australia was ""secretly exporting arms"""" **From what I can see, it appears to state HR groups say it is unthinkable that Australia has been secretly exporting arms. Which to me implies a sought comment and not a direct accusation.**  

 [Human rights](https://www.theguardian.com/law/human-rights) groups say it is “unthinkable” that Australia has been secretly exporting arms to the war-ravaged Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries whose militaries have been consistently accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. 

**I can see where they have drawn all the other data, I just cannot see the DRC bit. I don't think secret information has been used for this article. It appears the entire piece is based off FOI requests and the HR comments have been sought by the Guardian. With a cursory look I can partially verify what they print in the FOI documents.** 

**Just to clarify a few of these quotes** 

 ""*The extent of and extreme secrecy surrounding Australia’s foreign weapons sales are revealed by documents obtained by the Guardian under freedom of information.* 

 [https://www.defence.gov.au/FOI/Decisions/DisclosureLog.asp](https://www.defence.gov.au/FOI/Decisions/DisclosureLog.asp)  **Here is a link to the FOI database that has those documents**

 *The department of defence used the ‘commercial-in-confidence’ clause of the freedom of information act to refuse to reveal how many weapons have been sold, to whom, for how much, or for what purpose.* 

**You can see what they are talking about within the FOI documents**

 *Save for their existence and confirmation of country of destination, the documents have been almost entirely redacted by the government. That decision is being challenged by the Guardian.*"" 

**You can see this also in the documents.**

Oh and it turns out the ABC has already done a piece on this, not the DRC but regarding sales to UAE and Saudi, it is much more detailed and worth a look. It examined a company called EOS which appears to state they they had not applied for any export licences.

 ""The ABC has seen confidential EOS board minutes which reveal the company agreed to provide the weapons systems for use by Saudi Arabia in lots of 20 units.""

**Here is an earlier one where the Fed government indicates they want to get in on the arms dealing**

**I think this is an important topic, that should be explored. But from breaking down The Guardian's journalism, I am a little disappointed. It appears to be a shallow examination and hype headlines. The ABC has done a much better job of previously covering this.** 

This actually makes me wonder if the Fed government needs export licences for their own weapons and if some of these applications are ASIS/ADF related. I have no idea I would assume that they would have a streamlined system but who knows.

 This export permit is granted in accordance with Regulation 13E of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958.

                     (b)  for goods listed in Part 1 of the defence and strategic goods list—an Officer of Customs;

to grant a licence or permission to export from Australia goods listed in the defence and strategic goods list

**Which is**

 Part 1

For military goods, software or technology refer to Part 1 - Munitions List (ML). You should refer to sections within the ML to establish all the relevant controls, i.e. goods, software and technology:

* Refer to sections ML1 to ML 20 for controls on military goods (or munitions).
* Refer to ML901 to ML910 for controls on civilian firearms and explosive equipment.
* Refer to ML21 for controls on software related to military goods.

* Category 1 - Materials, Chemical, Micro-organisms and Toxins
* Category 2 - Materials Processing

**It also says something about a ministerial submission, I wonder if that can be FOI'd. I cannot find a database. But I would imagine that would be big ticket stuff.**

I cannot find the DRC FOI information so I cannot figure out where they got that from. I would like to see it though. There are a lot of items on that control list, it could be anything. I don't think all of these are weapon export permits. From what I gather they may be weapons, but they may be other items also. It also appears that when a foreign military brings its gear in, it has to apply for a permit to take it out. 

I am not saying Australia isn't exporting weapons but I think some of this article may be misleading. I do know that Lithgow Arms is trying to bite into the military orientated rifle export market so we do know that Australia is perusing arms exports. 

&#x200B;

Interesting article, but they should dig a bit deeper and provide some references to their information (I know it is just a newspaper but still). I really want to see the DRC document if anyone finds it could they please post a link. Also I encourage anyone who is interested to sniff around FOI databases, they are quite interesting and sometimes you will learn things that are not common knowledge."

But why even let that exist as a chance. It is not our money, throw it out or put it in the training room. 

I think most pharma start to loose effectiveness at a point (well it is probably different effects for every chemical). So I imagine the expiration date would be way before that starts to happen so as to prevent it coming back to them if a drug is ineffective. Guaranteed there is a profit factor behind the exp date."

Hello Medical Director

Could you please clarify our companies policy regarding expired medical supplies. There was an incident earlier this week where I discovered some lubricant that had been expired for five years. I took steps to actively dispose of these items as I feel it is important to prevent expired medical items ending up on scene. I am not a scientist so I am unaware of the effects that time has on lubricant and I cannot subject said lubricant to testing to ensure its integrity. My primary disposal method was to discard the expired lubricant into a waste refuse container as per company policy on non bio/sharps items. Later that day my supervisor informed me that I should not have thrown out this expired lubricant as he wanted to lube up my common sense and jam it into his anal canal. Was I correct in assuming that expired medical supplies should be discarded or should I cease throwing out expired medical supplies from this point on?

Station Break Room Lawyer

But then again maybe the supervisor wanted to use the lube in training which is fair enough, but it should be segregated into a training area if so. I would now take to asking whoever got up you for permission to throw out absolutely everything now, including old food in the fridge."

I mean some solid evidence, not Johnny's opinion piece because he needed to fill the 5pm slot. 

&#x200B;

Proven factors that actually cause accidents and fatalities that we as a society know of but still do...

1. Not checking blind spots before merging

2.  Drinking or consuming drugs and then driving

3. Tailgating

4. Fatigue 

5. Speeding (yes believe it or not the faster you go, the longer you take to stop and the less time you have to react). 

6. Using a mobile phone whilst driving

7. Shitty vehicle maintenance resulting in mechanical, electrical or hydraulic failure.  

 

If an external noise causes you to spaz out and crash your car then you probably should not be driving in the first place. Seriously if you suddenly decided to ram your vehicle into a bollard because someone used their lame ass Toyota tooter, are you really a competent individual to be on the road and around other peoples families? What sort of moron hears a car horn and instantly PIT maneuvers the car in front of them?

There are plenty of societies that use horns regularly whilst driving without startling each other into mass vehicle accidents. Although I am sure their road trauma levels are high, I doubt the horn honking is a contributing factor."

I have resource hoarding issues where I have to eat everything in the house. I have not been poor for at least 15 years but I still eat everything I can get my hands on. 

I only recently developed the theory that it may relate to not having any food in the house as a kid and opportunistically eating anything I could when I could. Dinner was the only meal provided by my mother and about 3 out of 7 days it was potato bake. School lunch was hit and miss. Sometimes I got some money for food. Other times I did not. 

I still had somewhere to live, but we only had things like a fridge when it was donated by someone. There was a solid 4 years where we had no fridge. Also no car. Still a better life than a lot of people so I am not complaining. 

My wife had a similar issue but she grew up with siblings so they would all pretty much fight to eat what they could when shopping was complete. She does not do this anymore though and now gets up me for eating all the food. I ain't even fat yo."
