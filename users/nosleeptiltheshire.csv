hiking,ff4965x,t3_erk441,1579558267.0,Only bad if they're on trails that arent meant for bikes. Just like hikers there are good ones and bad ones.
cactus,fewf60p,t3_eqmpe7,1579409569.0,I love these!
fatlogic,feepwk7,t1_feem6wf,1579038722.0,"Formula also results in healthy babies, so its not like formula and breastfeeding are mutually exclusive like its being presented here."
fatlogic,febmf2y,t3_eobdi8,1578960380.0,This is a lot of words for a person to demonstrate that they dont understand science.
cactus,fe60uvl,t1_fe60rmc,1578879273.0,"Half indoor, half outdoor. Midwest wet winters would kill it, but the summer it gets outside exposure. my grow light is a little far from it, but it seems to be doing just fine."
cactus,fe5zm1r,t3_envr09,1578878476.0,"It flowers in the winter with teeny yellow flowers! Ive been trying to get one of the pups to root for what feels like months, but the main plant has needed little to zero maintenance. I just give it lots of light and it does its thing. One of the easier cacti I have."
ArtefactPorn,fdz9z2g,t1_fdyv8yn,1578788110.0,"Not that overweight people didnt exist in generations preceding ours, but footage like this really does show how skewed our general population is in regards to bmi distribution. Its staggering."
AmItheAsshole,fdyw76c,t3_ene5a9,1578784205.0,YTA. Hiking with music on disturbs the environment (animals) and disturbs others. Listen to music on headphones outside of your car or your own home.
hiking,fdyv3q5,t3_enetso,1578783926.0,"Listening to music does go against the Leave no Trace principles in two fronts as it can disturb the animals in the environment, as well as create a situation where others are unable to enjoy nature as it is (no radio). 
I can see why people were angry with the guy. Most hikers dont go out into nsture to hear other people listening to the radio. Its generally accepted that music on trails is an unwelcome disturbance."
NationalPark,fdpb224,t3_emjoqy,1578624184.0,"I believe it depends on the state laws within which said park is located. NPS specific websites should help, for instance here is Yellowstone with links to the three different states laws for each district of the park: https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/management/lawsandpolicies.htm"
fatlogic,fdm4b26,t1_fdlljtk,1578539463.0,Finally someone else!
Old_Recipes,fdm4370,t3_em1iym,1578539316.0,This sounds amazing for the summer! I might try this and sub ginger for the cinnamon snd then add a decent amount of lemon zest to try to get a 'strawberry lemonade' type dessert.
nationalparks,fdm3u1j,t3_em1mpa,1578539146.0,"On your way to Mammoth you can stop at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Monument. A beautiful little stop and a nice shrine with a good exhibit for the kids! Its a short stop but a must see. Buy your Mammoth Tickets in advance if youre doing a cave your, they go faaaaaaaaast. And not to assume about your kids, but if theyre very little (toddler age) then a cave tour might not be the best choice for them. I got stuck in groups in Wind Cave and Mammoth with fussy kids, and the way the guided tours are set up is that there isnt really a private spot to pull a kid aside to let them calm down, and the rangers are on a time schedule so everyone has to keep moving. It turned into a fairly unpleasant experience in such close quarters as Im sure the kiddos were stressed about the different environments. 

Cuyahoga is great! The Ledges are a MUST see. I didnt expect much but the Ledges trail was amazing and really blew me away. Totally unexpected for Ohio. 

I also am from the Cincy area so good luck, those parks are far apart but worth it."
fatlogic,fdknyql,t3_eltusk,1578507526.0,"This person says that people have no obligation to pursue health. Maybe not to others, but what about to themselves? Do these people truly place so little value on their own selves to believe that they dont owe a little personal maintenance just to make their lives better?"
fatlogic,fdkma0b,t3_elw2xp,1578506492.0,Dont minimize my hard work!
cincinnati,fdigsn6,t1_fdign1f,1578442572.0,"I worked one of the auctions a few years back and it was a privilege just to get to handle some of those pieces to pack up. Stressful, but really a great experience."
fatlogic,fdh56so,t1_fdh4hzz,1578415624.0,"The only obstacle the new parents have faced was navigating what is a 'family photo for public' (usually portraits) vs 'private group family photo.' Some of the aunts wanted to originally post everything public and the parents had to set a few rules for what was ok. They eventually just set the rule of, if we share it publicly, then thats approved. Its funny because the older generation was the one providing most of the pushback whereas the younger family members immediately were cool with everything and understood the distinctions and what the parents were going for."
fatlogic,fdh4418,t1_fdh0wfe,1578414960.0,"One of my family members enacted a policy where there is a private facebook group for family members and friends to post and share as many pictures of the new baby as they want, but NOTHING goes public. This keeps the grandmas happy bc they get to take and share pictures with a willing audience, and the parents happy because baby is not being posted for public viewing. Just an idea if the SILs actions get a little too weird in using the bebe for her own social media agenda. Which, in my opinion, her using the baby is hella cringe and super weird."
HumansBeingBros,fdfwnwh,t1_fdfrevi,1578372236.0,"The teams usually walk with kids onto the pitch to listen to anthems/songs prior to the start of the game and photo ops. The kids represent the next generation of players and the adults are supposed to be providing examples of sportsmanship and camaraderie. They hold hands because its symbolic or whatever, but I personally believe its because each adult is assigned a kid and do you want to be the famous football player who lost his kid during the national anthem?!"
fatlogic,fdfvp1s,t1_fdd7ygj,1578371466.0,This is the best reason for purchasing a gym membership. Brb gettin' jacked so I can rule over the riff raff.
fatlogic,fdfu8aq,t1_fdfo3tn,1578370350.0,"Its been tough because my spouse doesnt share my same eating habits, but they dont care if i choose to eat separate because they understand that my fitness goals are the key to making me happy. I like running and i really like hiking, and my spouse really really likes me when Im happy, and losing weight made it so my hobbies were easier and more fun. So theyre happy that Im happy."
cincinnati,fdftdgj,t3_el364m,1578369716.0,Humler & Nolan have an auction yearly that heavily features Rookwood antique objects. Some really exceptional stuff comes out of there.
fatlogic,fd59m74,t1_fd48zx7,1578175436.0,"What baffles me is that the time and energy devoted to protesting and railing against 'fatphobia' and all that nonsense could be used on actual health/food education measures that would have a measurable positive impact on the lives of those who need the outreach the most. From my experience as a poorer, fat kid it wasnt laziness that made me fat, it was bad health and food education mixed with apathy surrounding 'what can I do about this?'

If FA feminists actually cared about the wellbeing of the women and minorities disproportionately impacted by poverty and obesity, theyd work to enable those demographics to empower themselves to improve their conditions, but that takes away the 'victim.' No one wants to educate you about real estate when they have a bridge to sell you..."
fatlogic,fd57kzb,t3_ek22r9,1578174978.0,"How is 'only eating when youre hungry' against the idea of true intuitive eating? 
Isnt following your cues truthfully like, the whole flipping point? 
What even?"
germanshepherds,fc2j9o4,t3_efu1o8,1577363139.0,"I slept next to my boy for 9 years and he never had any aggression issues, but he still used his crate as his spot. Still give her access to her crate as every dog needs a set location that is 'theirs' if needed. A crate isnt a punishment, think of it like her den. Often my dog would start out next to us on the bed, then move to our feet, then eventually move to his crate sometime in the night and we never had a problem. Do what works best for you but if you consider that she needs a space to call her own it may help with your separation anxiety. If it helps, my dog's crate was in our bedroom."
AskReddit,fbzvzgo,t1_fbztwkw,1577264573.0,There is a National Park that has an annual event for the fireflies. Check out Great Smoky Mountains at the right time and the trees look like glitter in the night.
