All guests are responsible for visitors who you allow in your room, ect. Basically be a decent fucking human who realizes that it's a hotel, not Skid Row, and we will be okay.


The 3 strikes rule..which was lax compared to many places, will result in an eviction with no refund of remaining stay..even if it was more than paying RACK per day.

nosleep,ff5r0bi,t1_ff5e75z,1579606796.0,"The easiest answer per Wikipedia:

""TheÂ mythologicalÂ kelpie is usually described as a powerful and beautiful black horse inhabiting the deep pools of rivers and streams of Scotland, preying on any humans it encounters,[16][18]Â One of the water-kelpie's common identifying characteristics is that its hooves are reversed as compared to those of a normal horse, a trait also shared by theÂ nykurÂ of Iceland.[16

][19]Â AnÂ AberdeenshireÂ variation portrays the kelpie as a horse with a mane of serpents,[20]Â whereas the resident equine spirit of theÂ River SpeyÂ was white and could entice victims onto its back by singing.[17]


The creature's nature was described byÂ Walter Gregor, a folklorist and one of the first members ofÂ the Folklore Society,[21]Â as ""useful"", ""hurtful"", or seeking ""human companionship"";[22]Â in some cases, kelpies take their victims into the water, devour them, and throw the entrails to the water's edge.[23]

Â In its equine form the kelpie is able to extend the length of its back to carry many riders together into the depths;[24]Â a common theme in the tales is of several children clambering onto the creature's back while one remains on the shore. Usually a little boy, he then pets the horse but his hand sticks to its neck. In some variations the lad cuts off his fingers or hand to free himself; he survives but the other children are carried off and drowned, with only some of their entrails being found later. Such a creature said to inhabit Glen Keltney inÂ PerthshireÂ is considered to be a kelpie by 20th-century folkloristÂ Katharine Mary Briggs,[5]Â but a similar tale also set in Perthshire has anÂ each uisgeÂ as the culprit and omits the embellishment of the young boy.[25]Â The lad does cut his finger off when the event takes place inÂ Thurso, where a water kelpie is identified as the culprit.[26]Â The same tale set atÂ SunartÂ in theÂ HighlandsÂ gives a specific figure of nine children lost, of whom only the innards of one are recovered. The surviving boy is again saved by cutting off his finger, and the additional information is given that he had a Bible in his pocket. Gregorson Campbell considers the creature responsible to have been a water horse rather than a kelpie, and the tale ""obviously a pious fraud to keep children from wandering on Sundays"".[27]"""

Lol as funny as that sounds, i would never recommend any one own one unless it was absolutely a rescue situation, and only if you were experienced. I can edit my post if it doesn't convey that..As much as i loved my first babies, they deserved a forests to fly about, not four walls to contain them."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fduhmkl,t3_ei88t6,1578733123.0,"I used to have two. Mick and Morty-cia. i resecued them after ALOT of research. They were on Craigslist and needed extensive specialized vet care. I had them both for 5+ years more, as they were already adults. 1/10 would not recommend unless osier recused under the right circumstances. As much as i loved them..i wouldn't recommend to the lay person. I spent years wearing them on a pouch around my neck when they weren't playing in their room or asleep. They would glide from the top of my cabinets to my waiting hand. I miss them every day, but they didny deserve being born in captivity or leaving in as small as space as a 1,750 sqft home with people when they should have large swaths of forest to fly through."
aww,fducgau,t3_ef39zb,1578731162.0,"I know the context.... God damn those fires and everything that caused them. I know they are doing their best. Any way i can volunteer to come and cuddle all the joeys. I am American and ignorant of most Aussie wildlife, but i have been sewing pouches and can cuddle with the best of them."

WTF,fdu42mx,t1_ewhc7zc,1578727173.0,"I had a VBAC with 2nd daughter. Was on pain meds. While i didn't get to the hospital until i was 8 cm dilated, i did recieve pain meds, and she did the crawl. Freaked me out at first, but not as much as her red hair."
WTF,fdu3l61,t1_ewher0d,1578726921.0,"Yep. The when my 2nd daughter did this, I thought it was the pain meds. Then became scared as hell when i saw she was a ginger with thick red hair already. Even though my Penny is amazing, she is still frightening as hell. (First one in 3 generations, yes I am sure she is my husband's. Our grandmother's were both Irish)"
WTF,fdu2ykw,t1_ewhyf6k,1578726601.0,"Nope, just feed on the opposite boob so that you give the one drained time to refill a little if their feeding schedules are close. You can even feed both from the same boob if you need to. Usually the child will trigger a unique ""let down' for every feeding. The human body is an amazing thing."
WTF,fdu0737,t1_ewhakko,1578725171.0,"Fun fact: Newborn infants can do the 'breast milk crawl' seconds after birth. Didn't belive it until my second daughter was born VBAC. They placed her on my stomach and she Saving Private Ryan crawled up my stomach to latch on. It was a surreal experience to say the least. This little being, who shouldn't be able to hold her own head up, crawled up my stomach to help herself to some colostrum.  With the pain meds, i almost had a panic attack thinking i gave birth to something from a horror movie. Then I also noticed she was a ginger, then my heart knew real fear. Lol"
