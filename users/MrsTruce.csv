I need to let larger clumps stay together if I want anything resembling definition, and a TT destroys my clumps. That said, some folks with tighter curl types (say, 3c and up) have a lot of success with them, as they're great for gentle detangling without tearing and damaging knot-prone hair."

*The Wolves of Mercy Falls series (Shiver, Linger, and Forever) by Maggie Stiefvater
*The Mortal Instruments Series by Cassandra Clare (and the prequel Infernal Devices series - those WRECKED ME. If you read both series, I highly, HIGHLY recommend reading them in the order in which they were published. You’ll have a much richer experience) She has also written a newer series, but I haven’t finished them, so I can’t recommend them yet. 
 
*bonus - I have heard wonderful things about The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern (stand-alone), but haven’t started it yet (now that I’m thinking about it, I’m going to stick it in my bag and start it tomorrow)"

curlyhair,fdh2z0v,t3_elbeie,1578414259.0,"Refreshing starts with protecting your curls overnight. Silk or Satin pillowcases are a good start. Cotton pillowcases = FRIZZ. Also, with your length, I'd highly recommend pulling it up into a ""pineapple"" on top of your head while you sleep. You could go all the way to the extreme of wrapping your hair in a silk scarf or using a buff while you sleep, too. I used a silk scarf for the first time last night and was pleasantly surprised at the results. @ me.and.my.curls on Instagram has a great tutorial for wrapping hair for sleep.

For the morning, it's hard to say what your routine should be. What works for some doesn't work for all. Some people can just get up and go, some dampen their hair and restyle, some just hit wonky areas, and some go all the way back to dripping wet. Start by protecting overnight and see what the damage is in the morning :)"

I've been working on ""training"" the back of my head to start to curl for the last month or so, with surprising success, and have found that scrunching in product while leaning back so that the hair on the back of my head hangs away from my scalp has had the biggest effect. As my hair grows out, I'm seeing that these layers just need a bit more length before they'll get in line and curl like the rest of my head. I'd suggest adding more water/product during styling so that those sections can form curl clumps, and then NO TOUCHY. Whether you're diffusing or air drying, don't touch problem sections once you've gotten wet clumps formed. Good luck! You'll get there soon!"
curlyhair,fdeiez8,t3_ekw1x9,1578339693.0,"I'll probably get downvotes to hell for this, but whatever.

Everybody needs to take a deep breath and calm down. Google it, folks. [Lots of people use lube in their hair](https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/frizz-control/unexpected-source-of-frizz-free-curls-k-y-jelly). Just because you think it's ""gross,"" doesn't mean it isn't effective. This brand does contain parabens, but the reason that they are considered ""boogeymen"" has nothing to do with how they function on curly hair, but rather the question of [whether or not they can cause breast cancer due to disrupting hormones](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/should-people-be-concerned-about-parabens-in-beauty-products/). The jury is still out, according to the FDA - but may I also quote this (researched) article that says, ""*Researchers have also found that some 90 percent of typical grocery items contain measurable amounts of parabens.*"" So cutting them from your hair care products alone doesn't do much to protect you from them.

@ OP - If you like the results, and aren't scared off by the parabens, then you do you. If, as you say in one of your replies here, the LEFT photo is the ""after,"" I think your results are lovely :) Sorry you're getting such toxic (not to mention, ignorant) feedback."

I chose that particular site 1) because it required a paid membership, and I figured anyone using it was at least semi-serious about finding a real relationship, and 2) the questions were more in depth than any other site I had tried (Match.com, etc.) so I had hope that matches would be better. I had a profile for about 3 weeks when I met my husband. I had limited myself to matches in a 100 mile radius, but when eH realized that I was running out of matches, they started slipping in matches from further and further away. My husband was from 2 states away (7 hr drive). I was annoyed that eH had matched me with someone outside of my specifications, but decided to give it a chance anyway... We talked on the phone for a couple of weeks, then decided to meet in person at a halfway point between our 2 cities. We dated long distance for 7 months before I moved to his city (his job was better than mine, so it made more sense for me to move). We got married 1 year to the day after that first meeting, and have now been married for 4 and a half years. I'd' say it worked out :)"
