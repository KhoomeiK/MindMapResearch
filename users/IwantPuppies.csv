Sex by deception may not be rape but its still despicable. It shows a complete disregard for the feelings of others no matter how unjustified you think those feelings are. 

As an ethnic male who passes for another (more ""desirable"") ethnicity, I've faced issues where women don't want to continue dating me once they find out  where I'm really from. I don't take offense and screech racism because I realize there are reasons for this that aren't blind hatred - maybe they identify with the culture, or they have ideas in their head of who they want to be with.  Everyone has preferences as they of course should. You and I happen to fall into one of those ""less desirable"" categories. It's life, deal with it, shaming doesn't change anyone's minds (opposite actually) and it just wastes your time and energy."
