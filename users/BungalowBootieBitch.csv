I can't speak for others, but, I know what I've been doing these last 25yrs; the good, the bad, and the ugly. I know my body and how to care for it because I've not only had access to education, but decent access to health care (thank goodness for cheap healthcare from my University). My health, however, really has nothing to do with me deciding that my body, at any size, is worth loving. I stopped living a normal life for so long because everyone had something to say. Not surprisingly I developed an eating disorder hoping I would achieve this imaginary, perfect body. I finally went to therapy, met a nutritionist, scheduled monthly check ups, and woke up.

As for the hyperthyroidism thing, I'm going to assume you've never had it (if you have, my apologies for assuming different). Since I was young and dumb, I decided, with zero research, hyperthyroidism probably wasn't bad. Plot twist: it's really that bad. The problem was that as many times as I was forced to get my blood tested for my cholesterol and sugar levels, no one could (or perhaps wanted to) grasp that my thyroid was causing my health to deteriorate. That was a rough year.

Now I'm older and a lot more wiser (excuse the cliche). That includes knowing I deserve to live a peaceful life.

You and everyone will always have the right to your opinions. It would be childish of me to say otherwise. I just hope you have an open mind and realize that everyone has been, is going through, or will go through a period in regards to weight, health, and body image. It's just not as black and white as it seems. I hope you understand."
