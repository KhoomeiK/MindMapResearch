space,ff9ane6,t1_ff8w9lo,1579708643.0,"The ""exploration of Earth"" era was bullshit. It happened over 100's of years and only a miniscule fraction of a fraction of humans were exploring. 

200+ years ago, going from Europe to the US was rather treacherous and you had a somewhat decent chance of dying over the month it took to get there. 

Today, you can not only fly there, but you can get there in literally less than 12 hours. You can eat breakfast in London and another breakfast, on the same day in NYC. 

Then you can explore the US on a steel horse that goes far faster than any normal horse could and all you need to do is to put some flammable liquid in to get it going. No training the steel stallion and you don't need an acre or 2 to keep it alive. 

Then when you've gone across the US, exploring more in a month or 2 than Lewis and Clark did in their entire expedition (if you go at 60 mph, you can spend 3.3 hours a day driving, then over half the day (13.6 hours) exploring and then sleep for 8 hours. In 40 days, you'll have traveled more than Lewis and Clark did over 29 months. 

Then you can fly again to China and repeat this. 

You have now explored more, on your own, than the men that made up entire expeditions did over a decade or two. You've done it in less than 6 months. 

Then you can go from China to Vietnam, then Thailand, Burma/Myanmar, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Tadjikistan, Uzbekistan, Kirgistan, Kasakstan, Russia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Northern Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo, Serbia etc... All the way to North Eastern Europe into Russia, then the Nordic countries then back south to Italy, France and Spain, then take a ferry into Africa. 

Now you have probably traveled more than any human has before 1950 or so. And it would take like a year or two. And you're able to explore all of these places. You might not find anything ""new"" like a mountain range or something, but that's boring. You need to name it, make sure it's not the same thing as someone else saw few years ago and then map it. 

Expeditions were also brutal back in the day. Magellan died in the Philippines. And I doubt he had time to stop and take in the sights for long before going back to sea for months. 

In short, you are living in a world of exploration. Yes it's commericalised, but it beats having dysentery, gout and scurvy. And if you get injured or have had enough, you can fly nearly straight home. The sailors of old didn't have that option. Even the airplane pioneers were pretty much unable to do it. 

You are an explorer, but you set yourself limits. If you were alive 200+ years ago, you would most likely be a farmer or a worker living in a small space, never travelling more than in a few dozen mile radius."

Depends on what you mean by ""better outcomes"". I've been relatively clear that it is better in terms of affordability and efficiency as well as amount of of people treated. That is my definition of better outcome, while you seem to think of it only in quality of care, regardless of who can afford it or not. But if you can't afford it, obviously it's not gonna do anything for you. Which you simply ignore and pretend that it exists in a vacuum, where nothing else matters.

Efficiency is effectiveness. More people being treated = more efficient.

 In the same way, the steak is nutritious, but the cost of creating it is also astronomical compared to the amount of land required for the same amount of nutrients from plants. It's 10-100 times more efficient to grow plants than meat when talking about nutrients, even though the meat is more nutritious per kilo. But when we look at the price of each calorie, we can easily see it's more efficient to use the land for crops fit for human consumption rather than that of an animal. 

In the same way, it is vastly more efficient to use a public healthcare system than a private one, even though the individual results are better. But we do live in a society and it's absurd that the richest country in history doesn't have a public healthcare system. Because instead of that, people die. Obviously not all, but a decent amount of deaths are preventable by a public healthcare system. 

And if we look at deaths in the systems, we can clearly see that fewer people die from preventable diseases in a public system than a private one even if the individual care is better in the private sector. But if a large majority can't afford it, but forced to use it, you get what you pay for, which tends to be shit or so expensive that you might have to change your retirement plans."

The fact is that the US offers one of, if not the best health care systems in the world if it were based solely on quality. There is a difference between a health care system and health care coverage.

State of the art healthcare that 90% of Americans don't really have any access to without going bankrupt. In fact, medical debt is one of, if not the biggest reason why households in the States declare bankruptcy.

Look at the opposition Obama got when he tried to pass the ACA.

It's how most systems do it, but through taxes rather than insurance. That's because it was never supposed to be a permanent solution, but instead something while the US transitioned to a better system. 

The worst part though is that Republicans absolutely shat all over it, changed tons of shit, then even if Democrats accepted the changes, the Republicans would go ""hang on, this is actually too good, we can't vote on this"" and filibustered their own fucking changes to the bill...

This is especially bad if other nations also have these arbitrary laws for when they might need to quell rebellions/protesters, since if they're gonna denounce a government for this action, the government being denounced can show the hypocrisy of others. 

But these kind of laws are useful when you want to stifle social movements that upset the status quo. The US did this when the civil Rights movement was growing, but fortunately, they hadn't gone as far in their arbitrary laws (although Nixon and his cronies did go there, by associating blacks with heroin and hippies with weed, then started serious campaigns against illegal substances) so things were able to get better slowly. 

In China and Hong Kong, I don't think these laws will be repealed. I think Hong Kong might be able to water down the extradition laws, but it will pass. Because China needs to quell Hong Kong the next time something like this happens. It will be an example to Chinese cities that opposition is brutally crushed. 

They would do it to Hong Kong, but they luckily have great relstions with the US and UK, meaning they're in the spotlight. Unlike cities in the mainland."

Irrelevant how? Pollution per person (average pollution, however, median pollution also works [and what I originally should have gone with], as it's more precise) is a decent indicator, just like GDP per person (average GDP, although again, median is better, since it has a more accurate distribution) is a decent indicator of economic health by country.

So you're fine with foreign interests building plantations and suppressing the population to maximize profits? Do you know where the term ""banana republic"" comes from and where United Fruit got their money? 

If not, I think you should read about it. The 1910's and 1920's foreign policies of the US in Central America, South America and the Caribbean was very interesting and profitable. For Americans. For the people that lived in there, life wasn't so great. In fact, it was worse and improved significantly after nationalization. Although of course the US couldn't have that and usually overthrew the leftis governments. 

Btw, do you know who gave you weekends, labor rights and paid vacations? Labor unions and leftist. Not the extreme leftists, but people that realized that there had to be a balance between capital and people. Perhaps you want to give up those rights in order to show me, a Democratic **Socialist**, how hardcore you are. After all, people that called themselves socialists were really good at fighting for their rights for paid vacations, weekends, minimum wages and 8 hour workdays.

China creates 24% of their energy with renewables (the US has 14%) and while they are the biggest polluters, they have 4x the population of the US. When we look at pollution per person, the US far outweighs China. 

You're probably gonna ignore that and the fact that China accounts for 45% of the world's global investments in renewables. The economy of China is smaller than the US economy by 5 trillion USD (or around 33% smaller).

So you're also of course opposed to the US doing it? Cause the US is the biggest provider of foreign aid in the world. Especially when it comes to the military, but they export soldiers for fees (a recent development), build extensive amounts of military bases (around 700 worldwide, more than any other country, including Russia and China combined)

>Do you wonder why that is? They have ""allies"" like you who hate them and have been raised to hate them for decades because you fancy yourself the new superpower but lack the means to do it.

Yeah, my country has literally 1000x fewer people than the USA. We couldn't become a superpower unless literally 99.9% of the population of the USA died out, 99.95% of China and around 99.5% of the population of Russia. And even then the population would be equal in numbers. 

And I don't hate the USA, but I definitely don't like the US government. It is full of itself and has done some seriously shady shit, not to mention, the US has overthrown, or attempted to overthrow over 72 governments worldwide. A lot of them for being leftist and attempting (sometimes by less than moral means) to improve the lives of their citizens by nationalizing important resources, like oil or fruit. But it's better to leave countries to correct themselves than to interfere and end up with generational wars. 

>I'm sure Belgium is next.

Sorry, Belgium has been hit. It's part of the EU and the US, or rather, Trump, started a trade war a while back. And the headquarters of the EU are in Brussels, Belgium. 

So honestly, it's a terrific example. 

And economic hits may not be what you expected, but it's a part of what I inclined. 

On the opposing end, the US (or Trump) denied military aid to Ukraine, a US ally, until Ukraine provided Intel on Trump's political opponent, Joe Biden. 

Honestly, the US isn't that bad, the people are cool, the food is incredibly diverse (and often amazing), the landscape is wonderful, the history interesting as hell and it's generally a cool place. It's also like 50 countries in one, but each state has its own customs, traditions and ideas, ranging from pretty liberal to rather conservative. 

What I do have a problem with is the US government. I have never really liked it, although there are a few good politicians there (good, as in, they take care of the people instead of special interests). My biggest problems are the CIA, NSA and of course the US military and especially the military industrial complex, which Eisenhower himself warned about (you know the general that practically won the European theater of WW2 on behalf of the US). 

The US political system is also extremely broken. Seriously, how the hell are there only 2 parties!? George Washington warned you guys about this and most of you idolize the fuck out of him. And why on Earth is the electoral college even a thing? And how can one guy in the Senate basically control the entire United States, a guy from Kansas, which has less than 1% of the US population and only received 213,000 votes in 2014?!?

It's a fucked up system and needs to be fixed... Because the US tends to also mix things up in other countries and usually for the benefit of the few that control most of the things (again, how the fuck can someone from a foreign country donate millions to politicians ANONYMOUSLY THROUGH SUPER PACS!?? Doesn't that make you angry?). After 2008, one guy, ONE GUY went to jail after the banking system and Wall Street bankrupted millions of hard working Americans through misleading loans and insanely irresponsible actions. 

You guys don't even have cheap healthcare. You have barely any paid leaves, not even maternity leaves... Education can sink you into a hole of debt for decades and minimum wage is abysmal... And how much have you benefitted from the DOW Jones going to 29,000 points? Probably not even close (in %) as the top 10%... 

Your government fucks people in the ass and doesnt even have the decency to reach around. Except to drop bombs on people on the other side of the globe. 

China is fucking terrible, but the US has been getting worse for the working man since the 90's. And has been screwing the world since the 50's (last rightful war/conflict the Uss participated in was probably the Korean war, although the support of the Mujahadeen in the 80's was also positive, right until the Soviets fucked off and the US said ""job well done, now let's leave these people with nothing but weapons, as everything else has been blown to smithereens). 

TL;DR: I am against the US government in general, not the people. They're mostly workers like me and have more in common with me than their government. I probably have more in common with the American people than my own government as well (not as corrupt, but still, there are a few corrupt cunts here that would sell their grandmother's for a dollar if they could)."

With Russia and China, you know why you're getting. Even if it's not the best, it won't change. 

With the US and their crazy political system, you can have someone that cares deeply about their allies, promotes free trade and unity, then 4 years later, some other guy comes along and removes everything at the stroke of a pen. 

The US is just too politically unstable to be always the best option. It is becoming more and more frequent that especially China is stable and has the force to actually do something about climate change for example. 

Don't get me wrong, China has tons and tons of problem, like the concentration camps of Uighurs, stifling freedoms and abysmal work conditions, but a lot of the shit they're doing is domestic. Europeans, North Americans, Africans and South Americans don't really care so much about that. A lot of them care about things that effect them domestically. And that includes climate change (China has increased their CO2 production, but they have also taken the lead, by far, in renewable energy output in terms of kWh) and saving money, which is why Chinese products are popular. China has also boosted spending in other countries, especially in infrastructure in order to gain a lot of soft power and even some hard power as well. 

Meanwhile, the US has been more focused on withdrawing or reducing, so while they're still probably the biggest spenders on foreign aid, by reducing it, they're giving up influence (someone going from 30k to 32k salary will get a praise, while someone going from 50k down to 45k might get seen as a bad worker). 

Uncertainty is bad for business and with the US being unstable in foreign relations, changing their stories constantly, and creating unecessary conflicts, people get a bit scared. Because they don't know if they might get hit next. 

That all being said, I think the US is a valuable ally and a friend, it's just he has been hitting the meth pipe a bit too hard lately and it's getting very uncomfortable."

ClimateActionPlan,fea55ru,t1_fe98eba,1578944486.0,"The main problem isn't that it's difficult to grow wheat in hydroponics (it's pretty simple), it's harvesting it on an industrial scale. 

You are kind of correct about potatoes, since they're starchy root vegetables, but it's still somewhat easy to grow them. But you do require quite a bit of depth, at least half a meter and that means for every square meter of potatoes, you need at least half a ton of water and that isn't exactly vertically scalable. That half a ton of water can also sustain around 20 m2 or more of leafy greens in a Nutrient Flow Technique system. 

And while it is energy intensive to grow vegetables in a hydroponic system, plants only use about 3-6% of the sun's energy. A solar panel can convert 20-30% of it and then we can turn that into light that the plants can use more efficiently (over 30% efficient, but that's 30% of the original 30%, so around 6-9%, which is still as good or 3x better). Then we can also retain heat in these buildings and water, meaning less energy goes into watering and we can grow them all year round, using electricity from other sources as well (such as wind or even biofuel from the parts we don't eat). It's not self sustainable in terms of energy, but it's far better than traditional agriculture, especially in terms of water usage. 

And with LED's, we can convert virtually all energy into light that's available to plants instead of heat as well. 

Currently, it's not economically viable to grow potatoes or wheat in hydroponics, but I have no doubt that with genetic engineering and some ingenuity, we could make it a viable alternative to things like traditional agriculture, especially in water sparse regions with enough solar (closed environment recirculates water instead of releasing it into the open air). Trees that have fruit are also a challenge, since they tend to need wind and deep roots to do well. So I don't see them being used in hydroponics without some serious genetic engineering to make them like tomato's or cucumbers, that is, more like vines instead of actual trees.

Synthetic meat is good, but also uses a lot of energy to be made. Although it is far more energy efficient than alive animals that need to generate their own body heat (and therefore waste around 90-95% of the energy). It will be a vital part of a greener future where nature can be a little bit free from human interference, as large swathes of land can become wilderness again."

>Let's break this down for a moment. Do you consider all military general and leaders equivalent? That is, is Justin Trudeau akin to a Kim Jong Un? Before we can have this discussion, this needs to be answered.

Trudeu is not the military leader of Canada. He has in fact little say in what the military does. Meanwhile, KJU has or can take absolute control over the military. The US and the Supreme leader of Iran have that in common with KJU. And technically, Queen Elizabeth as well (although she has never exercises that power as far as I know, instead giving that responsibility to her generals and especially prime ministers). The main difference between the POTUS and KJU or Khoumeini is that the POTUS is elected. Otherwise, their military powers are pretty similar (just look how many unconstitutional wars the US has fought. The last official declaration of war by congress was in 1945, but the Iraq war and the Vietnam war aren't called ""conflicts"" or ""incidents""). I'd even argue the POTUS has more power, as he doesn't have to be afraid of a more powerful entity attacking back. 

So no, I do not think Trudeu is the same as KJU, not because Trudeu is elected while KJU isn't (I guess he technically is, but we all know it's just one candidate and death for anyone that doesn't vote him), but because Trudeu has no power over the Canadian military. That power mostly falls on the monarch or the governor general, who represents Her Majesty the Queen. 

>That logic is akin to saying:

>""But for the fact that the woman did not dress provocatively, the rapist would not have been attracted and thus cause the rape"". In other words, ""she was asking for it"".

Did Iran ask for it? I mean, it looks more like Trump asked Iraq to ask Soleimani to go on a date with Saudi Arabia, then he jumped in and stabbed Soleimani in the neck like thunder from a clear sky. Then his people got of course paranoid, cause it's like a horror film and when one of the people in the house try to get out of a window they're shot. Because the people in the house heard rumors that Trump was about to enter the house through a window. 

Do you solely blame the paranoid teenager being hunted by an invisible killer or do you think the invisible killer might have started a chain of events that resulted in this? 

Imagine that the planes sent from Saudi Arabia were men surrounding your house while you have guests over. Your brother was recently killed by one of those men surrounding the house and you don't want your other brother dying (or maybe you, cause it's possible Khomeini would have been the next target) and you're paranoid, sure that they're gonna enter the window and you have a gun ready. Then one of the guests tries to escape the window while it's dark and you've had no time to really see if the person is going out or in. And when you tell them to identify themselves, they're too scared to respond or can't hear you. So you shoot. 

You're definitely to blame for killing the person, however, you would never have gotten into that place if the people that killed your brother weren't running outside your house, while their boss was basically saying you are a terrible person that should be taken out for the last 2 years. 

>That logic is akin to saying:

>""But for the fact that the woman did not dress provocatively, the rapist would not have been attracted and thus cause the rape"". In other words, ""she was asking for it"".

It's honestly more like someone that was raped being scared of being raped again. Iran didn't dress slutty, but their general was killed anyway. Of course they would be scared of the guy that killed their general and anyone looking like him (that is, military planes flying around). 

I also find it hilarious that you're dragging slutshaming and rape into this, as Trump has literally raped people. 26 accusers and Epstein was his friend. Even though Trump claims he never met the guy, there are tons of pictures and Trump has a history of being into... Younger girls... Epstein kind of girls...

And it's important to remember that, cause why on Earth would we not trust someone like Trump? He only cheated on his wives (plural), raped around 26 women (probably, but not proven definitely due to him suing them into Oblivion and them being unable to fight back his army of lawyers), slept and paid a pornstar to keep quiet, fucked over illegal immigrants after he hired them, cheated on his taxes (or else he would have shown them by now. He wants to, but ""can't due to audits""), barged in on beauty pageant girls changing room, where the youngest contestant was 15 and has done tons of other disgusting shit (including fantasised about his infant girls breasts, said he and his daughter have sex in common and explained he would probably be dating her if he wasn't her dad). 

So yay? 

I know I went off topic, but you did bring in sexual assault into this so I thought you should know what kind of a man you're using this analogy on. 

It's like defending a rapist."
