getdisciplined,fd6uvha,t3_ek701g,1578196013.0,"Pen & paper.

You make less effort to include ALL of the little details which makes it all seem simpler, and therefore easier to accomplish.

At least that's how it's been for me."
sydney,fd6au3q,t1_fd5r2p8,1578188154.0,"Oh I definitely agree! My point was more about if people want to donate so that things can be done with the money now, they should know what's going on. I wasn't trying to convince people that all donations are bad."

australia,fd5hkgu,t1_fd5h8lo,1578177729.0,"Well more 'inspired by' than copycat. Hers is directing funds to NSW, I'm seeing friends in Vic set up their own to send funds to Vic.

My point still stands though. Potentially 45 days. I don't think they realise."
australia,fd5a9sv,t1_fd57u0u,1578175650.0,"That's great to hear if Facebook are going to immediately release the funds, but at this point, when is the 'end' of her fundraiser?

If it ended today then great, the RFS gets their money ASAP. If it just keeps going up and  up then it becomes a delayed payment and a PR stunt.

Either way, people need to be aware of the mechanisms so they can make their own choices.

EDIT: I've seen friends & colleagues set up their own copycat fundraisers that probably won't get the same PR and if true that Facebook has promised to release Celeste's funds immediately, I can't see that happening for all of the copycat fundraisers that are popping up. Celeste's is just an example, I'm not trying to discourage it. Just want people to be aware."

It's great that everyone is giving, but cut out the middle man and donate directly so the money can be used NOW."

australia,fcw9lg6,t1_fcw48gp,1578020299.0,"Totally agree. We, the Australian public, need to start pushing the MPs more to kick him out.

I'm guessing they're either all too scared because they're either afraid of their boss, or they don't know what they'd do differently which is just as dangerous right now.

Unfortunately I think we're stuck with him until this is over. Yeah, I understand the problem with that statement."

Like, technically these are where all of the cameras are because all of the police are there helping with fires & evacuations. That technically that's where they are, but they're not turned on.

Otherwise it's just a dick move."

wholesomememes,fctio66,t3_eiu41a,1577944599.0,"TL;DR - I laughed at the meme but for the wrong reasons.

That sounds like something Australian's Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, would say about the fires.

AskReddit,fc6qvnn,t3_ega9qc,1577487181.0,"It's OK if you don't like it and want to leave. I say this as an ex gym user.

First time I started going as a teen it was great. Lost some fat, loved it.  
Second time around in late 20's I signed up because I knew I had to get moving. Wasn't motivated to go, felt guilty for not going but still paying, all of that usual stuff.  
Silly me signed up for a 3rd time just because it was in the building I moved into and they had a special going. Similar results to the second time.

I've found exercise that works for me now, which yes some gyms do (pilates & yoga), but I put myself through so much pain because I thought of myself as a failure for not liking the gym.

Try things, see what works for you. Do that for a bit. If it stops being enjoyable then you need to either learn discipline or change the activity. You'll know which one is right at the time."
