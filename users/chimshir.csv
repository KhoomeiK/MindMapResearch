People think I joke when I say I've lost weight, they mistake my cuts for random injuries and would say stuff like ""I thought you tried to sl*t your wrists but you'd never do that!""

The reason so many people want to study in the US, where I live at least, is because of the country itself. Though I personally wouldn't enjoy it, I see why others like it: it offers a completely different environment where hope to become better actually lives because its seen as a country of many opportunities. So they're not just picking a university, they're picking a country."

Since I had obtained my certificate a month or so before, my current classmate would brag about me in group classes. It made my old classmate reach out to me and we hang out every month or so when our schedules match up, and she eventually told me the nice things my other friend said in their classes. My face immediately caught fire haha,,"

AskReddit,fdnw2gb,t3_em2vfz,1578594014.0,"Straws got washed and reused. We didn't have much money when I was little, and it made sense to me that no one else does it, since everyone around us worked the same job and lived in the same conditions - they just didn't need straws like little me who'd always make a mess.

Eventually we moved out and the little boy that I played with every day was quite wealthy... he had so many plastic straws, it's a modern horror story when I think back to it. (they were a very nice family, I didn't have many toys and they let us play all day in his, get this, TOY ROOM! an entire room! for playing!!)"

AmItheAsshole,fdgi8gg,t3_el460c,1578397898.0,"NTA

As a slav I can assure you having someone named after you or being named after someone is one of the biggest honours there is. It doesn't matter what their skin colour is or what the name sounds like, it's a gesture of gratitude and respect. You could've made just his middle name Russian, but in the end its your child. You decide what to name them. It doesn't mean you respect your culture less or anything like that. In the end, one day when your child grows up, they can choose what they want."
AmItheAsshole,fd9k7h3,t3_ekbblj,1578234556.0,"NTA, I assume in Serbian you have 3rd person plural forms in masculine, f√©minine and neutral, and speaking a slavic language myself I know how harsh the neutrals sound, so I can see why it might've been difficult. I feel like maybe you should've apologised sooner, like just note it ""hey, I didn't have a way to translate your pronouns just now, I'm sorry""

Stuff like this is discussed beforehand because I personally would have a problem being called an it/ono/oni, however you put it, but there's definetly people that wouldn't mind it. Luckily my language doesn't have gendered pronouns in plural so we just speak in vi/vie and te, which is the exact equivalent of ""they""."
socialskills,fd9ept5,t3_ek7bi7,1578232380.0,"I used to be that friend. I came to my senses on my own, but your friend might need some serious help. For the time being, all you can do is talk to them. If my friends sat me down to say something like that I would've wanted it to go something like ""I love you, but it's getting hard for me too.""

This can go very differently depending on the relationship you have and the outcome can be vary a lot. 

Something my friends did after I told them about my ""enlightenment"" is that they sent me messages of encouragement and support randomly, even when I was doing okay-ish, so you can offer to do that? You've realised this at this point probably, but in each outcome your friend will be hurt more or less..."
mentalhealth,fd86x33,t3_ek86p9,1578214549.0,"Death is something we naturally fear, but it reflects mostly in other innate/universal fears (ex.: fear of falling - when you fall you get hurt and might die). It's important to understand that death is part of being human, there's nothing to fear. It's hard to leave or be left behind, but the world keeps moving even when we're gone. It hurts, but it's just how things are. I've lost enough people in my life to tell you that everything will be okay, and it's alright to be afraid a little bit.

It's good that you have better control over it now, hopefully everything works out. If it persists for too long don't be afraid to seek professional help - it might seem like something minor but I assure you, you'll be better off without it in the future. 

I'll take the liberty of recommending you a movie. ""A monster calls"" is a movie (based on a book) about a young boy dealing with and accepting loss. It's a very sad movie, but personally it taught me a lot. The trailer is bad though, don't watch it.

If you don't think you can handle a young boy losing his mother, I'd say watch it when you feel like you're ready."

CasualConversation,fd4u3jz,t3_ejx8wk,1578171126.0,"I thought of two!

""Dark India"" - meaning that its something you don't understand (and often might hide unforseen danger). Ex.: ""Driving for me is dark India, I think you should do it.""

""A fallen German"" - it's used to describe someone who looks rough or sad? I don't fully understand this one but I've heard it being used as like ""Why are you looking at me like a fallen German?"". As far as I know it comes from before WWII, when Germany had some kind of crisis and their currency lost a lot of value, therfore opposing the image we had of the perfect country, perfect workers, perfect families. It's barely used now-a-days.

I'm not the best historian, I know."

Being an introvert can be so exhausting! It's so easy to get drained without realising it and for me personally I end up getting irritated even when I'm in the same room as another person, it's like their presence itself is sucking out my soul.

My parents are anti-vax and don't allow me to take medicine, I didn't know how to get medicine but thankfully an online friend explained to me what to buy for headaches and stuff like that.

Until then not taking medicine hadn't been a bother for me as I was always healthy. Also, I'm aware that sounds like something very serious but understand I couldn't do much about it. Though I'm still underweight, the other two problems are eliminated ever since I started practicing stoicism (in a sense), aka I try not to react to stuff that causes me stress.

When someone hadn't signed their papers in class and the teacher went around asking who's handwriting it is I'd genuinely be scared that I just forgot what my handwriting(s) looks like. 

For clarification: If I'm using Latin letters I have a 2-4 different handwritings for French,then another set or a mix of these for English (switching them up feels uncomfortable). Same goes for Cyrillic."
