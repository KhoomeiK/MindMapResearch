fatlogic,feuw5w6,t3_eqi4rp,1579390513.0,"It's really amazing to watch how the bullshit they spew is growing crazier and crazier. When I've started reading this sub, they were saying you can be healthy at every size. Then they started saying health is not important, and after that, that caring about one's health is bad. Now they say diabetes is not a big deal. I wonder what will be next?"
IncelTears,fe8pxgs,t1_fe8632d,1578929143.0,It is. It's a comment that was posted here a few days ago.
fatlogic,fdq6urj,t1_fdpvjp7,1578657399.0,I've always felt like there had to be some omitted detail in this story)))
fatlogic,fdq1iay,t3_emmake,1578650226.0,"If someone has lost weight but still is constantly hungry, apparently they have an eating disorder, which is not how things normally work. A disorder is called that for a reason."
fatlogic,fdpyp7o,t1_fdpvlrj,1578646295.0,"Actually it was this sub that motivated me to research CICO. I hadn't seen my weight as a problem and hadn't felt any discomfort because of it (never been obese though, just overweight), but then I saw all these FAs and knew I don't want to be like them.

Now every time I see a fat person I can't help but wonder whether they are ignorant like I was or they are self-indulgent snowflakes like the FAs."
IncelTears,fdpdyrd,t3_emkqoa,1578626191.0,I have a distinct feeling that all of these guys are no older than 13...
IncelTears,fdp0vf8,t1_fdoiojq,1578617344.0,"Ah, yes. Though they are also the ones who bitch about how ""genetically inferior"" people (like their own parents) shouldn't have kids. Double standards are so double."
fatlogic,fdo6838,t1_fdo5ign,1578599603.0,"I used to be fat for years because I was an ignorant vegetable. Once I learned how CICO works I immedately started losing weight.

It's sheer idiocy. Being right isn't worth a lifetime of misery."
fatlogic,fdnxvdb,t1_fdnu41m,1578595066.0,"Well, can't say that I don't understand them. But I think no food is worth ruining my own life. Not to mention that I'd die from self-loathing for being so weak."
fatlogic,fdnt5eh,t1_fdnp254,1578592315.0,"Uhh... If one doesn't really want to do it properly as in learn to eat right and change one's eating habits for good, why even start tracking?

When I started doing it, it was because I didn't want to become obese and have any of the health issues that come with it. After some time I realized that I have an eating disorder because if I don't stop myself, I can eat until I nearly vomit, and then I'll sit and regret not being able to eat more. So since then, my goal was not just to lose 60 lbs, but to get rid of the eating disorder.

I want to be healthy, both physically and mentally. I want to be in control of myself and my life. It's fucking hard. It takes all of my willpower and I manage only by constantly reminding myself why I'm doing it.

Why would anyone do it if they don't want it?"
fatlogic,fdnlqah,t1_fdnj4vd,1578588431.0,This is exactly how I saw the wrongness of my eating habits when I started counting calories. It took me very little time to realize how I was overeating. I just can't imagine how one can fail to see it. The only possible way is that they purposefully ignore everything they see.
IncelTears,fdlt15a,t3_elm6w9,1578531803.0,Fucking fuck. This is a new level of yikes.
IncelTears,fdlssxs,t1_fdlb7fs,1578531650.0,"They don't want to speak to a woman, you know. It doesn't even cross their minds."
IncelTears,fdlsg8b,t1_fdlre3n,1578531411.0,"They don't know what women do in sex. Nor what men do, come to think of it (porn doesn't really count). And they never will, which is quite relieving to know."

IncelTears,fdlivuf,t3_elzwhv,1578525000.0,Imagine being such a human-shaped vegetable as to believe sex it the only meaningful thing in life...
niceguys,fdl6h9b,t1_fdl5cjr,1578517865.0,"It's what he himself said, eh?"
IncelTears,fdkx8b1,t3_elumal,1578513029.0,"""...believe everything he says, even knowing that is a lie.""


How exactly does this work?.."

IncelTears,fdisu25,t1_fdisl6y,1578450267.0,Where I live it's largely unnecessary but had I lived in the US I'd never left home without it.
IncelTears,fdisaun,t1_fdio6ak,1578449925.0,That actually would be a good idea.

IncelTears,fd5ghjp,t1_fd4aagg,1578177358.0,"It never fails to make me cringe. Such things are very personal and intimate and shouldn't be demonstrated in public. Seeing people do it makes me feel just like I would feel seeing a person walking in the street naked. Second-hand embarrassment is it called, right?"
IncelTears,fd5d5zl,t3_ejxc0g,1578176444.0,"Well, they are not completely wrong here. Am a former fat person, can confirm. Not that it makes them better than anyone though."

fatlogic,fc2rnag,t3_efljzj,1577372023.0,I can't tell my weight without a scale. How exactly is an act of finding out how much I weigh has anything to do with a diet?
fatlogic,fbx9m47,t3_eewkvm,1577175738.0,Some of these meals are more than my TDEE... It's a really great thing to have calorie count on the menu. I wish Russian restaunants had it too but something tells me it's not going to happen in the next 50 years.
