Crossout,fffg00i,t1_fffbpld,1579883143.0,"Don’t let others tell you what will work. This game is about developing a playing style and deciding what weapons work well together. Because your style can change in match (early in round mid range cannon, later round pursuit/upclose) a mix of weapons can be very useful. All depends on playing style. 

People that want to tell you what won’t work are the guys that bash drones, hovers being meta or even the age old complaint about aim bots. Bottom line is the game rewards creativity not playing the same as everyone else."
Crossout,fffb71t,t1_ffeu7gw,1579880109.0,"Disagree, they are good mid range in the mid 4Kish PS, for all the reasons you list they aren’t. DPS is great in relation to all other blue weapons and with some rads and coolers are great.

Further your statement RE: no one feeling threatened is based on what? A survey you took? 

Your explanation is devoid of context of when they aren’t any good, say higher PS like above 6k. AND based on an opinion that is not widely shared since you aren’t the only player thus leading to bias answer that is no doubt unhelpful to OP."

Crossout,fevaqhh,t1_feupnjl,1579395210.0,"When you create a video game then Your opinion will hold weight. And yes before you ask, I have and do work on video games. 

Your opinion on how to monetize a game is void of reason or clear thought. No, just because a YT’er helps “market” a game does not mean that the devs made money. The sponsorship cost can be more than revenue generated. 

Resources you use to create other resources that don’t have a short term value(ie daily fuel converted to plastic, electronics or copper) is a refund request since the coins have actual value in the system and is how the financials of the company is viewed. (Meaning this is why there are packs). this crossout market is directly relational to the value of dollar, euro and whatever other currency is taken by devs. Or how a cost for a pack is determined.

The fact that so few people understand how a video game is operated and yet so many want to tells the devs how to fix stuff is mind boggling. 

Bottom line, not one single person can directly affect what the devs do or need to do. 

To cause an effect you have to: complain in the actual video game forums or quit playing. No, saying you aren’t going to buy packs is not enough because you are competition for other players ( meaning most players want to play against other humans) the less that will play, the less that get online next time, ie a death spiral of a player base. 

To answer you directly, no I am not dense, But maybe just maybe you should quit trying so hard now?"

Also, next time you insult someone verify their gender, So as to not look stupid. Oh yea you love looking like a complete moron don’t ya. 

Lastly drone spamming is your problem? Why because you don’t know what to do when you lose? I love using all weapons, including but not limited to drones, tsunami, retcher, porcs, wedge/shotties, hover crickets, etc. need I go on?

But my absolute favorite thing so far is how you can’t just shut up about it. I LOVE trolling you it makes me smile to see such a useless waste of space in life like yourself get so triggered because they were told to that they were acting juvenile. Perhaps we could meet up huh? Would you like that, since you talk about sucking dick maybe I could bring a friend for you?

I have decided to do three things just because I like you so much....
1)troll you forever more. I hope it triggers you. I have enjoyed doing it all day.
2) jump on Xbox and watch for you and will play drones just to trigger you yet again.
3)continue to monitor all your comments and downvote forever, since as you can tell I’m a bot. It’s easy to monitor your account with my desktop app that queries reddit. 

It has been fun for me, not so much for you, but then again I don’t care about you or your feelings do I? So why should I stop?

The only person that should read this is you as OP so yea my objective of calling you a loser and you knowing that I did.... accomplished. Like I said you can whine but you can’t argue the logic of monetization, which you didn’t. Ironic isn’t it that you whine about points that make no difference unless you are just salty and a little cry baby but once a logical point is made you ignore it? Then complain that when you tried to make a bias, incomplete, illogical argument to try and prove your point, you further prove that all you want to is to make a “thorough analysis”, what you really do is further prove how salty you are that you can’t win."

Crossout,fen7zvm,t3_eq03e4,1579278972.0,"Another “I can’t win” whine. The game has all different types of weapons and all them have their place in the game it’s called appeal to a wider audience.

Some people don’t seem to understand, perhaps yourself included, that nobody works for free and monetization requires either high prices or large audience.

You will never get a game that is perfectly balanced. Nothing in life is. Your choices are: quit, stop whining and accept the developers perspective, or don’t and keep complaining about a setup that your input has no value to the devs. Bottom line you want to influence the behavior of a company then stop giving a way to monetize off you. Meaning even if you don’t buy packs, don’t play the game since players drive others to play since their is competition and not AI bots to fight.

It’s just sad to see people complain with such long winded posts with no outcome. Save your time and energy and get involved in something that will change when you complain because even if this does get changed it will be something else tomorrow that is wrong and you will be back then whining about that too."

Now in regards to access. It is not illegal if access was granted by company, and notification was not sent stating that the contract was terminated early(before payment) OR that they were accusing developer of breach of contract. Otherwise a contract is considered fulfilled once payment is complete and until that happens, the developer is still under contract and access that was granted prior is still in effect under said contract."

Posts like this piss me off. Until you offer to fix it for free and work for gaijan AND you offer to work overtime for free/salary then stop demanding something be fixed or act like it’s not a big deal when you know nothing of the code base, the testing, or the cross platform support required to make changes. Saying things like “still no option”  for a change implies they somehow work for you,which they don’t and you can’t even argue that they do because you paid for something because you bought something unrelated to the HUD and the game is free. How gaijan monetizes the game is up to them, and isn’t for losers like you to act butt hurt because you didn’t like something about the game. In fact do us all a favor and quit the game so we don’t have to hear you whine."
