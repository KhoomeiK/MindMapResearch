bulletjournal,fd44tsl,t1_fcw7gg0,1578164460.0,"The Green Rider series is a super fun read, to be honest I do think the series should be wrapped up soon so that it doesn't drag on, but still definitely worth the read.  If you like the other books I would also recommend Joe Abercrombie, The Blade Itself was excellent."
bulletjournal,fd43n0t,t1_fcwifzz,1578164098.0,"I will one day, but I didn't have any of the other books easily accessible when I finished HG2G so I just moved onto the next book I did have."
bulletjournal,fd43d8d,t1_fcwe0or,1578164019.0,"I like the bookshelf style, I used it for my ""to read"" collection that I no longer keep up-to-date because it's too much work. I found the book pages to be simpler, but I think it would be more satisfying to have the bookshelf style filled in."
bulletjournal,fd42jxx,t1_fcw2c27,1578163784.0,"Milk and Honey was 100% read Dec 30 and 31, although Heart Berries was actually the shortest book by number of pages, if not words."

bulletjournal,fd3zih0,t1_fcvyl0s,1578162970.0,"I will always absolutely treasure The Complete Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi. It's a comic book about her life growing up in Iran before/during the Iranian Revolution. I cried, laughed, and had my heart broken.  The story is both beautiful and tragic, it's not something I will every forget. I would highly recommend this book to everyone.

All of the books from Our Shared Shelf (Emma Watson's book club) are great. I tend to read strictly fantasy and scifi, so these are really good for broadening my horizons. These were: The Complete Persopolis, Why I'm no Longer Talking to White People about Race, Hunger: a Memoir of (My) Body, Heart Berries, Fierce Femmes and Notorious Liars, and Milk and Honey.

The Way of the Kings by Brandon Sanderson, I started this book then put it down for a while because it was incredibly sad, and honestly I was just horrified at what the main character was enduring.  Then I stumbled across the Brandon Sanderson subreddit and everyone was fawning over this series, so I kept going. By the time I finished this book I panicking trying to get a copy of Words of Radiance. I had to wait two whole days for it to be available at my library. The only reason I didn't continue onto the third was because after about 100 hours of these audiobooks I needed a little break. I will continue, and will eventually reread them, but I wanted something a little shorter for the next book I read.

I'm also excited to continue Joe Abercrombie's First Law series, I definitely did not start thinking about my teeth too much after reading it.

The only book that I would not recommend is Go Set a Watchman. Life is short, don't waste your time on that book."

bulletjournal,fd3o3w5,t1_fcwyz25,1578160186.0,"Reread, I don't know how many times I've read them, I don't think more than 5 though. Also I'm Racenclaw."
bulletjournal,fd3npxz,t1_fcwtvsf,1578160066.0,"Completely agree, easily the worst book of the year. I kept reading thinking it would get better, it doesn't. I find it very sad that Harper Lee was used that way."
bulletjournal,fd3myq8,t1_fcw34xl,1578159833.0,"I'm going to make the spread a little bigger for this year, so maybe I'll reach 42. I really enjoyed the book, it's so hard to describe because I've never read anything else similar. When you open the book you fall right into this wild and crazy adventure, instead of going where SciFi normally goes Douglas Adams took a sharp right and fell off the face of the planet, and it's amazing."

If it's not something you have a need for, then of course it's unnecessary, but USB C is supposed to become the new standard."
