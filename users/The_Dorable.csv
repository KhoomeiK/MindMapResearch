IAmA,ff1b5ib,t1_ff0on2f,1579477029.0,"There is a thing called human leukocyte antigen in bone marrow. The body uses HLA markers to decide which cells belong to it and which don't.

These markers are genetic. You're more likely to match a sibling than a random stranger. And white people have more in common, genetically speaking, with other white people than they do people of color. If only a few people of color are registered to donate, then the chances of finding a safe match that won't make the person even sicker drops dramatically."

HaircareScience,fei3rn4,t1_fei3gh2,1579129634.0,"The human eye tends to prefer things that look more natural and fit well with the rest. We're taught to follow the natural shape of the hairline as we clean edges because that's what people expect a hairline to look like. We just put clean lines in, but we follow the shape that the hair grew into naturally unless the customer specifically asks for something else."
HaircareScience,fei3bnl,t1_fei358x,1579129353.0,"There isn't one. You follow what the hairline around the ear does, more or less, because it looks more natural with the rest of the head. The head is your guide."
HaircareScience,fei29rk,t1_fei1x9j,1579128702.0,"Lol, what? Most hairdressers try to follow the natural hairline when they clean around your ears. No two hairlines are identical, no two ears are identical (including your two ears!) so unless you come in there asking for whitewalls, it just depends on your head."
piercing,fei21wi,t3_ep8tue,1579128568.0,"It's probably not infected. It's probably just irritated.

If it's infected, it'll be extremely painful, massively swollen, very red, and may have streaks of red emanating from it. If it's actually infected, you need to get to the doctor right now, because you can lose your ear."

piercing,fecyy01,t3_eoif44,1578990450.0,"That looks like an irritation bump. Those can take a minute to calm down. I once had one for six months, just because I'm an active sleeper and kept bopping myself in the face with a pillow.

Salt soaks aren't necessarily recommended anymore. If you don't get the ratio or salt to water *exactly* right, you can actually make it worse. 

Pressing on it will definitely make it worse.

Having removed your jewelry will also make it worse.

The piercing is old enough now that the most likely culprit is some kind of mechanical pressure or chemical irritant. If you're making sure to rinse all the shampoo and conditioner off your ear very thoroughly when you bathe, being careful to not snag it in your hair or hoods, and you don't roll onto it in your sleep, it'll almost certainly improve on it's own. I'd make sure that the jewelry is made of an appropriate material and it isn't too tight with the bump in it as well. 

Either way, it'll be fine. It's nothing to worry about; we all get them eventually, and they usually go away with a little babying. Using chemicals to try and burn them off makes them worse, so all you can really do is let your body sort itself out."
piercing,fecyfak,t1_fecqxi9,1578989782.0,"Please don't recommend Lulu's. They're pretty well known for bad piercing practices, and I don't really trust their jewelry, considering they sell provon soap for use on fresh piercings.

Going to the piercer is definitely the better advice."

piercing,fecy4i3,t3_eogppd,1578989383.0,"It might be possible to hold the piercing open by taping the jewelry in place and letting the majority of the tear heal around it.

But it would probably be easier on the ear to just let it heal completely and repierce. It would be rough to keep the original jewelry in place well enough to avoid irritation, and most tapes meant to go on human skin can cause irritation in themselves."
piercing,fecxnat,t3_eohmu6,1578988786.0,"Depends on the shop and how old the piercing is. Some shops will only use their own stock, which they're sure is safe, on fresh or deeply irritated piercings.

Also, a nostril screw isn't ideal. A flat back stud is best."
piercing,fecwxke,t3_eoi4qn,1578987918.0,"I got a little tab like that too on mine after it fell out overnight. . It was irritation and it lingered for a couple months. You may have an actual blowout; I don't know enough to say for sure. But mine went away, and it looked just about the same. It helped me to back off the o ring I had on it. What with swelling from pushing the jewelry back in, my o ring was fitted too tight and was exacerbating the problem.

Either way, good luck!"

2) Those words were reclaimed by the people to whom they were applied. I *choose* to call myself queer and a dyke. You don't get to choose to say those words are okay to be applied to me. 

Insisting that calling trans women traps isn't offensive when you yourself aren't trans is high-handed and presumptuous. Some trans ladies are okay with it. But most of the ones I know find it quite painful. And some of the ones who are okay with it are only okay if they themselves or people they know use it."

And a slur is a term that is applied to a group of people with the intention of being derogatory or insulting. The word trap is a transphobic slur, because it alleges that trans women aren't real women, just men trying to trap straight guys into being attracted to them. If it's an insult, then it literally fits the dictionary definition of a slur."

I personally found it too difficult to aim unless I had help.
