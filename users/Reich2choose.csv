AskReddit,fc9u6po,t3_egtuyt,1577558276.0,"Long ago, humans and gorillas shared a common ancestor. One group of these ancestors stayed in the forest, and the most successful of this population were able to repeatedly defend their territory with their brute strength. The forests were rich in foods and nutrients, so they didn't have to travel far to find food, but they were under constant threat from other populations of similar kinds and strengths. The individuals that were able to display short bursts of strength, followed by long periods of resting and foraging were best able to find continued reproductive success. 

Another group of ancestors were pushed out of the forest, and across the plains. Many new external pressures meant that the hairy, short, knuckle-walking ancestors were ill-equipped for their new environment. The stockiest and hairiest of this population found little reproductive success, while the taller, leaner individuals in the population had better chances of reproductive success due to their smaller caloric requirements, and ability to traverse their new habitat more efficiently. 

Fast forward 2,000,000 years (100,00 generations or more). Humans are now the ultimate endurance mammal on the planet. The physiological differences in strength are mainly due to the different types of muscle fibers, and the leverage of attachment points."
