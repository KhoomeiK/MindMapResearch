Suicidal_Thoughts,fekpdyf,t1_feknh3p,1579204847.0,"Same, I want attention in the form of help as well.
Still unsure if that will happen, I let my parents read 67 notes that I wrote in the past yr cause I ran out of options and wanted them to see how bad I was so they could help me.

That ended pretty badly, my mom thinks I'm being tortured by demons and they think the only thing that will help is church and reading the bible. So yeah I'm feeling a little screwed help wise and my hopelessness has skyrocketed pretty bad.
Hope u have better luck with getting help eventually."
Suicidal_Thoughts,feklpx2,t3_eplmgx,1579202665.0,"I'm basically in the same spot, it's sad how bad I want to die but I have things stopping me.
And it only makes it worse because everyone ignored me when I told them I was suicidal, it's like since they know I won't kms they don't care that I'm still seriously contemplating it.

I've been out of a job for nearly a year now and I'm always telling everyone that I'm just a burden and a cause of stress, but they say otherwise, however despite that they still ignore that I'm suicidal, they just want me to snap out of it and act like everyone else who's normal.
I guess I'll just wait till I'm kicked out lol if I can't get better on my own like they want they'll get fed up with me eventually.

I don't know if I have anything to say about anything getting better, cause I'm scared I'm forever fucked in this world myself.
I guess just know others are out there like us, it's nice to know some times that someone else is in the same thing trying to hold on.
I sometimes wonder if maybe we're the ones who have the right idea and everyone else is insane for wanting to live in this world lol"

That habit either already exists or it doesn't for the most part."

depression,fe7bt2t,t1_fe6pg46,1578912514.0,"Im not Christian, still believe what I did, but I have no interest in it. But kinda want to say the opposite, I'm suicidal af but no matter how bad I am I won't do it cause I still believe in hell.
So I'm jealous of people that don't have that over their heads."

depression,fe721q8,t1_fe4lpcl,1578908997.0,"When I told mine I was suicidal they took me to church to be exorcized, or whatever tf it was, they were praying aggressively over me and wiping shit on my forehead because they said I'm being tortured by demons. And guess what, still suicidal."

Suicidal_Thoughts,fctddnl,t1_fc7gcot,1577939718.0,"I'd tread lightly here, some parents are great, others are not. Generally speaking i have great parents, but when it came to how they handled me telling them I'm suicidal, it wasn't so great.
Now I'm in a constantly worsening state and there's no one to help me."
SuicideWatch,fc85no4,t1_fc7f4vo,1577527413.0,"Ur advice sounds too personal to really be helpful.
Things may get better for u and that's great, but a lot of people see that as fake hope.
Again I'm also glad that church helps u, but for someone like me where my parents took me to be exorcized cause they said ""Ur suicidal because you're being tortured by demons"" church really isn't that helpful to me, and other people could have a negative experience like that as well.
Besides church isn't usually something a suicidal person wants to deal with.

Here's my advice, none of us know wtf to do and usually can't give any decent advice anyways. So  the only advice I have is, find what blocks ur thoughts when their bad and try to keep hanging on for a little while longer."
