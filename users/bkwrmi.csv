- Some body parts we think of as being ""one bone"" in day to day life are actually made of several different bones fused together (skull and pelvis). The lines where these meet (called sutures) change visibly with age. In older individuals, they are smoother and less obvious.

- Wear and tear in various areas - how worn/damaged are joints?

- Bone can become somewhat pourous in older individuals (think osteoporosis).

languagelearning,ff19yx1,t3_er27hk,1579476700.0,"It's more complicated than that. For a basic sentence with only one verb, the verb goes in the second ""position"" - usually after the subject, but the word order is flexible, so it might be after an object or a phrase describing time. 

For most sentences, a verb normally *has* to occupy the second part of the sentence. If that's an auxillary verb (to have/to be) or a modal verb (can, should, would, etc), then any other verbs go to the end of the sentence (or clause, depending on the sentence.

So, a basic sentence could be:

""Ich mag Eis."" (I like ice cream.)

A slightly more complex sentence could be:

""Ich muss Spinat essen."" (I need to eat spinach; word for word, *I must spinach eat*)

languagelearning,fem73qv,t3_epvo3c,1579242116.0,"My German accent is usually able to fool native speakers, at least initially. 

I didn't start learning the language until high school, but had memorized some songs in it as a kid, so that may have helped with pronunciation. Also took linguistics, which helped me conceptualize what was going on with certain sounds. That, and just spending a lot of time practicing and listening *really* hard. It helped to overdo the accent at first, really slow things down and overemphasize the unfamiliar sounds at first. Eventually, they became ingrained and I could relax a bit and let them settle into a more natural pattern. It probably took a few hours of dedicated practice to get the ""r"" sound down. Some of it is really just playing with the way you hold your tongue and mouth, which muscles you tighten or relax as you're speaking, until you sound as close to a native speaker as you can. Over the course of 4-5 years of study, I also learned some tricks that go a surprisingly long way. 

- If you're having a hard time rolling the R's in German, start by gargling water. Then, start vocalizing while you gargle. Then try it without the water. 

- When in doubt, speak as though the tip of your tongue is glued to the spot where the inside of your bottom incisors meet your gums. 

TL;DR: Always listen carefully to how words are actually being said and try to imitate it - don't just grasp at the closest sound you're familiar with. It may help to learn a little about linguistics and look up *how* a particular sound is made if you're having difficulty imitating it."

explainlikeimfive,fe0c0xs,t3_enhkuj,1578809264.0,"Genes control how our bodies are built - our blood type, the shape of our nose, whether or not various things work correctly, etc. They are the ""blueprints."" 

Genes come in pairs - you get one copy from mom and one from dad. The two copies of the gene determine what version of a trait you will have. 

Some genes are dominant - that means you only need one version of the gene to have *that* version of the trait. Freckles are dominant, so if one parent has freckles and you get that gene, you *will* have freckles - it does not matter which version of the gene you got from your other parent. 

Some genes are recessive - that means you need *two* of the same version of the gene to get that version of a trait. Unless you inherit the same version from both parents, you will not have that trait. *Not* having freckles would be an example. 

Genes can also be incompletely dominant, which leads to an in-between version of the trait. For example, if you inherit the gene for curly hair from one parent and straight hair from the other, you'd have wavy hair. 

Some genes are codominant, which means if you get two different versions of the gene, you'll show *both* traits. While there are some examples in humans, they are usually things that are harder to see. In humans, blood type is an example (type ""o"" is recessive, but types A and B are codominant with each other, so if you get one gene for type A, and one gene for type B, you'll be type AB). A more visual example in other species is ""roan"" coloring in horses - if you look closely, the individual strands of their coat are different colors.

Some traits are ""polygenetic,"" which means many genes affect the same trait - hair, skin and eye color are all examples of this, and why we can see such extreme variation in those traits, even within one family. 

Finally, genes can interact with each other in more complicated ways- sometimes, an individual gene influences *many* traits or can activate/deactivate several other genes. An example of this is the condition of albinism - a mutation in one gene ""turns off"" several other genes that would normally influence hair, skin, and eye color. 

It all comes down to whether the kid got more dominant genes from one parent or the other. Additionally, if the baby is still very young, keep in mind that their features and coloration may change in the coming weeks, months and years. It is very common for a baby to have lighter skin than they will when they are older, or to be born with blue eyes that turn brown later."

Specific heat refers to the amount of actual energy that has to be gained or lost to change the temperature of something. For example, one calorie of energy is needed to raise the temperature of one mililiter of water by one degree Celsius. 

As a result, when the same amount of energy is available, different things will feel different temperatures. This is also why the temperature of the air and bodies of water may be very different - water needs to gain or lose much more energy to change temperature compared to air.

Jade likely needs to absorb a lot of energy before it feels warm."

The part around the pupil might be more green or more brown, while the outer edge is the opposite. As a result, if someone's pupils are constricted in bright light, the inner ""ring"" of color will be more obvious; in dim light, the pupil dilates, so the outer ""ring"" of color will be more apparent."
explainlikeimfive,fdthdrh,t1_fdtc4sg,1578716787.0,"You know how sometimes a particular cold or flu makes some people *really* sick while others are only sick for a little while? There are lots of reasons for it, but one reason is differences in the genes that control our immune systems. Some people have even been shown to be especially resistant to diseases like HIV or plague. 

Genetic diversity is good for a species. Genes control many aspects of how our immune systems work. Some genes might make you better at surviving certain viruses, while potentially making you more vulnerable to something else. Other genes might make you immune to a particular type of bacteria, etc. There are benefits and disadvantages to many versions of a gene, which can mean that the same gene is more *or* less useful in different situations (environmental, immunological, etc). By having lots of genetic variation, a population has the best chance of surviving an epidemic of some kind of disease. 

If you rely on cloning, there will be what's called a ""genetic bottleneck,"" meaning that there is very little variety in the genes, so all the organisms will have the same strengths and weaknesses. This is already an issue for many species that are severely endangered, or some that *were* endangered but have been well protected and are now coming back. The California condor is an example of this - at one point, there were only 22 condors left. Although there are almost 500 condors now, they are effectively ""inbred"" so many potentially helpful versions of condor genes have been lost; they may still all die out if a particular disease affects them, and none of the living condors have a gene that can help to protect them.

There are also times when this can be relevant with livestock and plants. Think of the Irish potato famine - the blight that killed the potatoes only affected some types of potato, but Ireland had mostly switched to only a couple of specific, high-yield varieties that happened to be especially vulnerable.  If more types of potatoes were still being grown in Ireland at that time, it's possible that the famine would not have been as severe."

Most important thing is to learn to use it - spend some time playing with settings - learn how to adjust ISO, aperture and shutter speed. Cameras have automatic modes for lots of things, but manually controlling those lets you get shots the camera can't figure out. You're smarter than the camera, after all. Also, learn how to hills the camera stable so you can get some slower exposures without a tripod, otherwise things start getting wobbly below about 1/80."
