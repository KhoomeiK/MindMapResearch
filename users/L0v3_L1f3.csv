ITS NOT FUCKING HARD TO AVOID TREES WHILE SKIING.... 

If you can't stop yourself from running into a tree, how would you stop yourself from running into another skier? 
If you think a helmet is necessary for your safety while skiing, you're probably the most dangerous hazard on the slopes."
whitepeoplegifs,fdocziu,t1_fdocgvk,1578602901.0,"Where do you live that helmets are common for skiiers? 
I remember when I was a child we all made fun of the only kid who's parent made them wear a helmet... Because no one wore helmets unless they were hitting the rales and jumps. 
Why is normal skiing so unsafe? Unless you're just constantly skiing out of control, I don't understand how someone would ski into a tree. You can turn and stop on a dime on skis.."
whitepeoplegifs,fdo6o9v,t1_fdo4io8,1578599828.0,"I go a lot.. all over the state.. and I  see plenty of snow boarders and young children with helmets.... The only adult skiers I've noticed wearing helmets are usually in classes or somewhere near the bottom of the mountain... 

After a certain point, trying not to ski into a tree is the same as trying not to walk into a tree.... You don't have to think about it if your eyes are open..."
