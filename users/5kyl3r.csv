(even had ME on a thinkpad I bought new)  Every one.  Even today.  I've built a new gaming rig almost yearly since about 2001 as well.

The people who are disagreeing are blind.  Like brainwashed North Koreans.  You don't know better because this is all you've known.  I'm assuming you're all young.

Windows 7: Disable windows update.  Uncheck some stuff in security section.  Done.  Permanently.  When you see an important update you want to install (or major service pack which is what I'd wait for), you can still manually go to updates page and do an update.  Total control.  No ads.  No telemetry.  No driver clobbering.  Yeah, the OS cost money unlike OS X, but at least it just works.  Buy it once and it's done and ready to rock.  No tom foolery.

Windows 10: Still costs money.  Free version crippled.  Forced updates.  Turn service off?  Too bad, watchdog turns it back on.  In the middle of something and need to skip the update that just popped up?  Too bad, you're going for a ride.  Ads all over the OS.  Cortana always listening.  Xbox live services always eating clock cycles.  How long did it take them to fix high DPI?  It was shit even when they literally SOLD a high dpi device that came with win10. (surface)  Apple was able to get a perfectly seamless fix for high DPI screens and non-updated apps.  Microsoft?  Enjoy using your magnifying glass!  (I assume this has finally been fixed years later?)

You have to run scripts to fix these things.  Which in itself is a bit sketchy, so pull from a safe repo.  You can use a firewall or dns solution, but what if this is a laptop?  More people use laptops now than desktops.  As soon as you leave home you're subject to update service pulling crap down and forcing updates down your throat.  Hosts file solution is the only option at that point.  So again, not a real good solution and stupid that this even has to be done.

On the subject of updates, remember win 10 launch?  It worked for a day or two.  Then udpate decided everyone's NIC drivers were old so it clobbered them with bad ones and people couldn't get online to get a fix.  So they tried windows rollback.  That bricked like 99% of the machines that tried it.  What kind of shit is that.  It STILL TODAY causes tons of issues for people with drivers.  Especially graphics drivers.  Got display driver stopped working?  Yeah, windows update probably clobbered your drivers.  reboot to safe mode, run driver cleaner, reinstall.  Make sure you tell windwos update to STOP TOUCHING DRIVERS.  (they added this AFTER the fact when they realized they were bringing thousands of people to a halt with driver issues)

If the OS were free from day 1, I could live with ALL of the above.  Then maybe a paid prosumer version where you can click an agreement and turn everything off.  And obviously an enterprise version.  But paying $250 for all of the above?  No.  It blows my mind that people just take it in the ass and are ok with it because they've never seen better."
buildapc,fd76m20,t1_fd5kko3,1578200104.0,"sure if you want the bend over and take it in the rear version, it's free, but if you want control over the OS you need pro or higher"

Windows server comes with Xbox live services.  Yeah.  Why?  It’s stupid AF.  Updates are forced.  I always disabled updates in old windows versions and just did major service packs but now it’s forced.  Even GPO and registry and disabling update service have not worked.  Absolutely stupid.
