offmychest,ff6rzjr,t3_eru1na,1579633652.0,"Yeah people don't realize how much of one's self is repressed by hiding ones sexuality. I only realised this when I moved to college . I'm still in the closet in my hometown and at home but I went to college on a different coast so I decided to just be me. I've found I'm a totally different person at school with the friends I chose, the way I walk, talk, seat and even the clothes I wear. At home I'm more repressed and quiet, I avoid arguments and just want peace. The is the major reason I applied to med schools so far away from home, I just want to be myself for a while, till I get the confidence to come out at home"

HumansBeingBros,ff38rft,t1_ff38hwr,1579536367.0,Damn relax dude. I am 22 first off. My mom's a nurse so I come to her for most of my minor injuries and if I feel sick. Neither of us thinks it would make the injury all better it's just a joke she does. Yes I technically still live at home since I'm a first year med student so im temporarily living at school. Finally I'm a woman not a boy
HumansBeingBros,ff2rgha,t3_era7cy,1579520811.0,"I'm 22 and I secretly still love it when mom kisses minor injuries good, but outward I'm like ""Jesus mom that's not going to help"" while I proceed to hold my sprained finger out for kisses"

Spent months looking for it in the US and found it one day at Kroger then they took it off the shelves. Now I'm looking for it again at every store I'm at.
