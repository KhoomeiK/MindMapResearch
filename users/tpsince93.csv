nba,ffgr05m,t1_ffgfjmn,1579912846.0,"ehhh it probably won‚Äôt improve the situation. There‚Äôs a reason why Bogi went on a tear when Fox was injured‚Äî the PG duty fell on him. He is best used as a primarily ball handler, almost like a Luka-lite. Him and fox on the court together,  it almost feels like two drivers trying to fit into the same seat."
nba,ffgoce8,t3_ethpo4,1579910955.0,>‚ÄúShould be noted that one point of contention between the front office and former coach Dave Joerger at one point was Joerger believing Hield should be a sixth man‚Äù  oof.
nba,ffgnzr8,t1_ffgf33c,1579910706.0,"This is a pretty ironic thing to say, given Buddy‚Äôs rocky relationship with Dave Joerger was one of the reasons why we got a new coach"
nba,ffgnmsz,t3_ethpo4,1579910454.0,"Oof. This is actually a really smart choice imo, Buddy would do really well in a Manu/Ben Gordon/ Lou Williams style role.  Buddy isn‚Äôt the most thoughtful dude  and has a bit of an ego, so this might not go over well."

nba,ffd8z5i,t3_esyr1a,1579815760.0,His willingness to work the catch-shoot and allow BI  to handle is pretty cool too.
MMA,ffd64jd,t3_esx6tf,1579814159.0,"These reactions are so divisive to me. One on hand, you are through the roof happy that your boi just pulled off an amazing win‚Äî- on the other hand, Cerrone‚Äôs grandma + loved ones are within eyesight. Great restraint on Kavanagh‚Äôs part, as well as great candor from the rest of the corner"
nba,ffaumrh,t1_ffar2eh,1579744871.0,"Shoutout to Mark Eaton, looking at his stats gave me a legitimate wtf. Dude almost had 6 blocks a game at his peak."
Boxing,ffatujc,t3_esd0cx,1579744353.0,"I‚Äôm obviously generalizing, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if a bunch of Eastern European boxers smoke. Way less taboo over there. Granted, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre puffing up a storm ‚Äî-  just have a smoke on occasion"
Boxing,ffaju9i,t1_ffad9s3,1579737523.0,Lol true that. The concept of getting a fighter ‚Äúready‚Äù for a championship is absolute turd‚Äî- 70% of the time it just equates to waiting for the champ to pass his prime/ get old.

nba,fezvxzc,t1_fezbyq1,1579462359.0,Yup this is pretty reasonable‚Äî- I just don‚Äôt think I had my ear to the ground at the time Luka was drafted. I didn‚Äôt realize other teams had him as a lock and were gunning for him so hard.

nba,feu0k7b,t1_fetzfu7,1579381932.0,"Dinwiddie is basically selling his contract to investors. Pay him up front, and he gets you back with interest as his nba contract pans out. I don‚Äôt necessarily think it will

nba,feoqp7p,t1_feopr4k,1579304113.0,"Yeah I really hope he can stay healthy, dude has such a smooth jumper + game overall. Have the Nuggets rested him at all? Or are they doing a minutes restriction?"
JoeRogan,feodydf,t1_feo4ytr,1579298773.0,"The quality of guests goes up at the cost of candor, unfortunately. I feel like very episode with a big name is just some rehearsed long form plug. This is just my opinion, but JRE has lost one of its big selling points and is now a little too similar with Maron‚Äôs podcast."

kings,fekqn6z,t1_feknuie,1579205596.0,Yeah I think that snake exec Brandon Williams was part of that whole fiasco last season. He‚Äôs the one who Joerger kicked out of practice last season and as a result was the prime shit stirrer for the media.

Boxing,feiy0nm,t1_feikvdj,1579150372.0,"If we‚Äôre going to mention Floyd, Conor took this wolf ticket stuff directly out of Mayweather‚Äôs book.

MMA,fdhlms8,t3_elfj2b,1578425265.0,"I think this is what separates the UFC and it‚Äôs fighters from a lot of other fighting orgs‚Äî- in a good way. Boxing, or even Bellator seemingly have no problem cooking up a 12 pack of tomato cans for a prospect."

7daystodie,fc3hqgz,t1_fc2qjm6,1577390059.0,"Yeah the spears are absurdly underwhelming, I said the same when 18 first came out. The devs just completely ignored the base function of a spear ‚Äî- you should be able to attack at a greater range + poke zombies **away** from you. Instead of a throw, the power attack should be a hard thrust that guarantees knock back. Why in the logical fuck would you throw a 5ft spear during a zombie apocalypse?"
