nottheonion,ff5uz27,t1_ff5q8kf,1579611163.0,"You're missing the fact that there is a **huge** difference between continental Europe (like Berlin and Amsterdam) and the Nordic countries. The Nordic countries (except Denmark) are much, much less densely inhabited than continental Europe. Germany and Netherlands have 233 and 420 (wait, that can't be a coincidence can it?) people per square km. In comparison Norway, Sweden and Finland are all around 20! Consequently the housing market is **much** more forgiving in the Nordic countries, especially outside the capitals. Meanwhile wages are actually higher in the Nordic countries compared to continental Europe despite the lower cost of living.

Keep in mind that in the comparison with the U.S. people also pay collectively for things like health care, college and child care. This means (1) none of these events have a large economic local impact on your life, so they present much less of a hurdle, (2) taxes are proportional to income so even though you pay for it through your taxes you pay much less than someone in the U.S. for the same cost, and (3) they are usually run much more efficiently, so the total cost is **also** cheaper.

So a 130 000 USD/year job in Seattle might get you the same quality of life in the U.S. as ~60-70 000 USD/year job in a second tier city in the Nordic countries.

However I definitely agree that continental Europe gets the short end of the stick in the comparison to the U.S. and the Nordic countries."

Hobbits live around 100 years, but had a tradition of attributing adulthood to 33 years old. However that didn't mean they were dependents until 33, it was more a recognition of maturity, so I'd say it'd be fair to equate it with roughly 25 years for humans (which coincidentally is roughly the age when the brain has matured fully).

Ég er líka nokkrar vikur á ári á Ítalíu og þekki nógu vel til þar til að telja það með.

Eitt af því besta við Ísland er fólkið. Hugarfar fólks og viðhorf er með allra besta móti. Almennt eru Íslendingar lausnarmiðaðir, bjartsýnir og greiðviknir. Þetta var t.d. það sem mér líkaði verst við í Svíþjóð, hvað fólk var ósveigjanlegt og stirt.

Annað er lýðfræði landsins. Ég er ekki stórborgarmaður. En það er ekki öll sagan að það séu engar stórborgir á Íslandi, það eru alls staðar smærri bæir. Vandamálið er að flest sérhæfð störf safnast óumflýjanlega í stórborgirnar ef þær eru til staðar. En vegna þess að höfuðborgarsvæðið og Ísland almennt er það langt frá stærri þéttbýliskjörnum þá eru öll þessi sérhæfðu störf ,,föst"" hér. Í röðun [Globalization and World Cities Research Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization_and_World_Cities_Research_Network) er Reykjavík sett í flokk sem kallast ,,Suffiency"". Í þeim flokki eru allar aðrar borgir þrisvar sinnum stærri en höfuðborgarsvæðið eða stærri. Þetta þýðir að þú getur sótt nánast hvaða menntun sem er og samt starfað í samræmi við menntun þína á höfuðborgarsvæðinu.

Þar að auki er höfuðborgarsvæðið eina borgin á landinu. Það þýðir að það er mun líklegra að skyldfólk og vinafólk búa til frambúðar í sama þéttbýliskjarna, sem spornar við stórum fylgifisk nútímasamfélagi, að maður missir tengingu við vini og fjölskyldu því maður neyðist til að flytja borga á milli vegna vinnu.

Annað er landafræðin og náttúran. Ég held að það sé óhætt að segja að engin önnur þjóð í Evrópu geti skartað sig jafn stóru hlutfalli af ósnortinni náttúru og Íslendingar.

Loftgæði eru líka alveg frábær jafnvel á höfuðborgarsvæðinu (nema upp við stofnæðir á annatímum).

Fantasy,fedac17,t1_fe96nkw,1579005536.0,"> It would be like reading LotR after having read the top 100 fantasy books of the last couple decades and finding it derivative.

Well, Lord of the Rings is honestly **very** different from the modern Fantasy genre as a whole. Which is quite funny really, considering how influential it has been on the genre. The difference is more than anything in tone. LotR is very sombre, almost subdued, but at the same time very intense. Take a look at when Aragorn speaks with the Fellowship after looking into the Palantir. Gimli exclaims about the peril of using the stone in an almost chiding manner, and Aragorn says ""You forget to whom you speak"". He doesn't yell or react with any surface level excitement, but his words carry weight like the current of a river. Calm but intense.

There's also a emotional sincerity and almost abundance that permeate the series. Characters are not afraid to communicate their friendship and love, not just for each other but also for places and concepts. Sam loves Frodo, but he also loves the Shire and the Elves. Gimli loves his friend Legolas, but also the Glittering Caves in Helm's Deep and Galadriel.

The whole halves featuring Frodo and Sam in Two Towers and Return of the King are like ~40% straight up examination and meditation on friendship and enduring hardship. In general the books feature very little magic, battle or action in general. Most of the battles happen off-screen, with us re-entering the narrative to be told of the outcome. That's not to say that what adventure there is (such as the fight with the Balrog) is extremely thrilling. Tolkien knew where to include it and where to exclude it is what I want to say.

There's also this heavy Christian/Catholic influence on the series that gives it an extra layer of depth. Characters' failings are almost always due to universal human imperfections, and susceptibility to fear and temptation rather than any inherent malice. Saruman and Denethor are both corrupted by the fear caused by Sauron through his Palantiri. Gollum is corrupted by his desire for the Ring. The dwarves' greed in Moria cause their downfall. Even Sauron himself was not evil until he was seduced by Morgoth.

There's also the Christian theme of redemption through repentance and actionable choices. It is by leading the charge into the center of the host of Haradrim and killing their standard-bearer that Theoden is finally redeemed. ""My body is broken. I go to my fathers. And even in their mighty company I shall not now be ashamed."" Same goes for Boromir. His last words are ""I tried to take the Ring from Frodo. I am sorry. I have paid."" In LotR the lowest of the loathsome are those that refuse out of pride to repent, chiefly Wormtongue and his master Saruman.

Another aspect of the Christian influence is the aspect of a world failing. In LotR things generally get worse with time. Magic is failing, especially after the Ring of power is destroyed. Elves much leave the world or else die. Newer generations of men are not as long lived, as noble or strong of spirit, as grandiose as the Numenoreans of old. This reflects the two somewhat unrelated concepts of Christianity of people in the Old Testament living to much greater ages than normal, and the fact that in Christianity this world is heading towards a 'Last Judgement' in which the early existence we know will end."

I think the evolutionary perspective is quite clear. The most ""advantageous"" form of life is one that is able to reproduce repeatedly across generations. You can't have an individual live forever, because he'd be competing with subsequent generations. But you can't have him die before reproducing either. Also, in the case of an animal such as humans, where your body and brain needs years and years to develop to the point of independence, you can't really die before your offspring is grown. But that's the point at which you offspring has offspring of their own, and turns out your assistance increases the prospects of your grandoffspring. At the point where there are grand-grandoffspring you're already at the crowding point, so those whose bodies were failing at that point (cardiovascular disease, cancer, some form of organ failure) were more likely to have their grand-grandoffspring succeed compared to those who were still sticking around.

Keep in mind that in our evolutionary history you were far, far more likely to die earlier than the onset of age-related disease (from accidents, infectious diseases, famine, etc., etc.) than today, so the parent and grandparent generations were already thinned out when they arrived at old age. So the crowding-out phase would be reached much more quickly with today's life expectancies, and age-related deaths ""should"" set in earlier."

[Here](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2752328/unprocessed-red-meat-processed-meat-consumption-dietary-guideline-recommendations-from) for example is a review article from a few months ago that summarizes the results of research papers. Among many other conclusions there is this (emphasis mine):

> Dose–response meta-analysis results from 17 cohorts with 2.2 million participants provided low-certainty evidence that decreasing unprocessed red meat intake may result in a very small reduction of overall lifetime cancer mortality (7 fewer events per 1000 persons with a decrease of 3 servings/wk), with **no statistically significant differences** for 8 additional cancer outcomes (prostate cancer mortality and the incidence of overall, breast, **colorectal**, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, and prostate cancer) (13).

I.e. they find that decreasing (unprocessed) red meat consumption (by three servings per week) has **no effect** on the risk of getting colon cancer.

There seems to be some tiny advantage in decreasing eat consumption. Around [12.5%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate) of people die from cancer, so a decrease of 7/1000=0.7% lifetime cancer deaths is only a relative decrease of risk of dying from cancer of 5.6%, which is hardly a large difference. The difference for cardiovascular disease is even smaller. In the end the authors confirm the currents standards for the recommendation to decrease red meat and processed meat consumption, that it's a weak recommendation based on low-certainty evidence.

This is in stark contrast to the lifestyle choices of smoking, drinking alcohol, obesity and exercise that have much, much larger effects on health and mortality."

AskHistorians,fdip17y,t1_fdgqtfc,1578447830.0,"> For example, restricting movement was more normal in India than in the US.

But it's right there in the quote you are replying to that the genetic isolation is **not** because of geographic distance (and restriction of movement), but rather two social groups, i.e. castes, live side by side but still remain genetically completely separate for literally thousands of years. This is absolutely astounding, and runs 100% contrary to the idea that you present in your original comment, that caste was much less important to an Indian's identity before British colonial rule.

>  if the definition of being in a certain jati is not marrying outside that jati, then people who did marry outside it left it by definition.

Unfortunately for you mathematically it works out that if even a tiny fraction (like the 1% number mentioned in the quote) do procreate outside their caste, then the mixed group they create will increase at a rate that will reduce all pure castes to next to zero percent long before 2 or 3 thousand years. For example lets assume for the sake of generosity that indeed only one third (33%) of Indians pertain to a strict caste. Then after one generation 1% of them will now be mixed caste, and the proportion of population in strict castes will be down to ~32.7%. After another generation it's down to ~32.4%. It doesn't matter that the vast majority of members of strict castes do maintain their caste, as long as even a very small fraction do not the genetic integrity so to speak, the genetic signal as it is called in the quote, will degrade to close to nothing in so many generations.

I can only reiterate the statements in the quote, the literal **only** explanation for a non-geographic subgroup maintaining a genetic signal from a bottleneck 2-3 thousand years ago is that society only allows procreation within some strict social divisions (i.e. castes), and additionally that they would have to had habitually killed any woman (or their offspring) that get pregnant by men outside their cast by any means (infidelity, pre-marital sex, even rape), and done so consistently for millennia!

In **very** simplistic terms, while the DPP and their voters represent a potential, even eventual at some point down the   line renunciation of mainland territorial claims, the KMT and their voters (30-50%) represent the idea of closer ties to the PRC and potential, even eventual at some point down the line reunification."

Lets assume Ph.D. are usually earned at around 1/3 through one's lifetime, and lets assume that the average female lifespan is ~85 years. Lets then assume that there were much fewer Ph.D.-s earned by women in the past, so lets use a past-multiplier of 0.5. Then we estimate the total number of female Ph.D.-s in the U.S. as 0.5 (past multiplier) x 42,000 (female Ph.D.-s per year) x 85 (lifespan in years) x 2/3 (the fraction of lifetime holding a Ph.D.) = 1,200,000.

Now we need to account for the white and urban part. The white part is [easy](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219), 76.5% of people in the U.S. are white, and as whites are probably not underrepresented in terms of Ph.D. degrees we use this fraction directly. The urban part is also easy, since the U.S. is [81%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization_in_the_United_States) urban, and since high-education jobs that Ph.D.-s usually have are more urban than the average we can use this fraction directly.

We then get a (probably conservative) estimate of the white urban women with Ph.D. voter base of 1.2 million x 0.765 x 0.81 = 750 thousand. I wouldn't be surprised the true number is over 1 million.

Fantasy,fc3510o,t3_efxpw8,1577381594.0,"It's just how the book is. No-one loves it at the halfway point, but most do when they're at the end. I was still putting in work at the 60% point, after which it starts to accelerate. But the pay-off is definitely worth the investment. There's a reason why the series is literally the [top Fantasy novel/series of the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/c7d7z8/the_rfantasy_2019_top_novels_poll_results/).

Of course no book is for everyone, but when you're already at he 50% point and your experience is pretty much par for the course there really is no reason not to see it through.

None of that is to say of course that Sanderson shouldn't cut (or have an editor cut) ~40% of the fat off his books, but that applies to pretty much every modern epic fantasy author. Even as is the Stormlight books are absolutely fantastic."

books,fc1k9e9,t1_fc1glr0,1577321274.0,"You are wrong to think I lean towards conservatism. I'm just making the simple observation that Broken Earth got much more attention than it's literary quality would merit. It's not any better than a host of other fantasy series from the same time period like Stormlight, First Law, Broken Empire, Locke Lamora, Riyria, Lightbringer, Red Sister, Powder Mage, etc. It's only because the author is a black woman.

Whatever your opinion is of such diversity recognition or affirmative action or whatever you choose to call it, if you've read a few of these series you can't seriously assert that Broken Earth has any sort of heads or shoulders over other Fantasy series from recent years."

Written by a black woman."
Fantasy,fbxt7h2,t1_fbx2vpf,1577199864.0,"> It goes into a lot of detail about how being an assassin could actually mess someone up permanently and scar them emotionally.

Which is not a hero's journey story. I really don't get why everyone is recommending Farseer to OP."
Fantasy,fbxsu4y,t1_fbwovn7,1577199577.0,"I have also read both books, and I can confidently say the Eragon books are **much** better written than the Belgariad books, concerns of originality aside.

Also, Eragon doesn't borrow particularly heavily from Belgariad, it's mostly the magic system and possibly the 'farmboy departs home village with wizard' aspect. The latter is more from Star Wars anyway, and the magic system is much more fleshed out in Eragon and isn't very impactful in terms of the story being told anyway.

So I see no reason to fear loosing appreciation for Eragon by reading Belgariad. But neither do I see any reason to read Belgariad, I personally regret not just stopping after the first one or two books, it doesn't get any better.

Although I haven't read them, you might try Raymond Feist's books. From what I've read about them they are precisely what you're looking for. You might also be wise to be careful with the Farseer books that are being recommended here, I haven't read them either, but I've frequently seen them described as the most depressing books ever, as supposedly bad thing keep happening to the main character, who is not able to reach the success and catharsis that is associated with the hero's journey type story."
videos,fbxid03,t1_fbwrlfz,1577188957.0,"> Why is Star Wars as popular as it is?

Because the franchise was started by two of the best action-adventure/sci-fi-fantasy films of all time. Even Jedi was a good if not great.

Inb4 nostalgia: I saw the films for the first time when I was an adult already."
videos,fbxhkta,t1_fbwdszp,1577187837.0,What are you sorry about? Star Wars is **indeed** a hero's journey story (and probably the best ever committed to film).
