You have to understand why they are the main problem, and not you.

If you don’t have this, I feel like you’re doomed to suffer the consequences of the abuse, or in the end you end up behaving like them."

CPTSD,feof80w,t3_eq4t95,1579299322.0,"When they do this they’re actually acting from their inner child, compensating for the sense of impotence they felt when they were children, as adults abused their power on them.

I get the hurt that this behavior causes us, but I usually can’t feel any kind of anger or think badly of them. If anything I feel pity. It’s a tragedy that they resolve to behave like this, I see it as a missed opportunity to have a good relationship with your child.

I’m not a professional at all. I’ve read the inner child concept on Alice Miller’s work, and some other material."

This was just after I had started “no contact”. I followed her advice and went straight to meet him after the session.

It was horrible. She had no idea what she was talking about, and had no idea about narcissism and emotional abuse.

Some therapists just don’t know what the hell they’re dealing with.

I wish I had a clear story I could tell myself. I still struggle with questioning myself if there really was abuse. And then there are times when some memories of abusive episodes are very clear.

I think this is relatively new to me. I’m two years into knowing what this kind of abuse is, and one and a half into NC.

I might just need more time to process all of it."
CPTSD,fefgi4w,t1_fef3xfy,1579055832.0,"I have trouble with that idea, that we don’t owe them our love or presence.

I feel very guilty for being in NC. I can’t really explain why. I feel like I owe it to him, like a debt I have to pay him back.

It’s very weird thinking about this. I try to keep him off my mind, but I seem to keep going back to it."
CPTSD,feffx8l,t3_eou052,1579055485.0,"I worry about this sometimes too.

Sometimes it even makes me want to get back in touch. It’s been a year and a half of NC.

He’s not not overtly abusive, but not really pleasant to be around either. People can usually tell something is off after a while of contact with him.

I also kinda don’t have anyone to judge me for the NC.    
Isolation was part of my story with him. As he managed to distance himself from everyone around him, so did I. I can’t say for sure if isolating me was conscious and part of the abuse, but I turned out to be completely isolated apart from my immediate family, and they know something is off with him.    
I can remember very vividly some times where I would distance myself from people I loved because of him. I still mourn those relationships.

When he had cancer I was the only one who made him company. I would take him everyday to the hospital and then back to work. No one from his family or mine cared besides me. That’s when I noticed he really had no one, just me.

My biggest fear about all of this mess is how I will feel when he dies. I think about regretting not spending any more time with him. I think about the missed opportunity to try to make him understand his behaviour, and maybe help him to change it and lead a more fulfilling life.

It’s weird to think I’m not angry or hurt about him, I guess I just feel sorrow and grief. I see his behaviour as a tragedy, as I see it as a choice for him to keep acting like this, and because it’s also from a broken childhood he might have had.

There are other abusers in my extended family, and I don’t imagine feeling bad for the relationships I had with them, or from distancing myself from them. But I don’t know, maybe it will hurt too.

Sorry for the rant. I don’t know what got into me, I guess I just needed to get this out.

I fear for the moment he’ll die as well, and I wonder too how people have dealt with it."

CPTSD,fefdxm1,t3_eote7c,1579054256.0,"I guess I agree when there was something you can point at and say it was abuse.

I’m wondering about people who experienced neglect, or a form of abuse that was very covert and over a long period of time. I’m imagining it might be harder for people that can’t confidently say they were abused to cut the relationship and not feel guilty.
