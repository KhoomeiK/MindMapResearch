guitar amp emulated output -> audio interface -> iPad <- HD webcam

Futurology,fec6s69,t1_fe9p49i,1578967613.0,"As someone who has kept their digestive autoimmune disease in remission through eating primarily grass-fed beef (NOT processed meat), it is extremely concerning watching this fake / “impossible” meat trend gain steam. 

Yes, I acknowledge it has a relatively lower carbon footprint. But when it comes to my health, I prioritize food that is nourishing / non-inflammatory. And the genetically modified composition of fake meat just isn’t that, whether it’s the soy based “impossible” meat  or fungus-derived Quorn mycroprotein.

I know that’s a lot of audio, but the database could be cleared every 24 hours because 99.9% of flights won’t need audio examined. And it would guarantee insight into crashes without the need of a physical black box."
