AmItheAsshole,fdonv0q,t1_fdomo1x,1578608975.0,"All I can say jumping into this is that everyone has preferences when it comes to body type, and she was attracted to how you used to look. Idk what she thinks of your body now, but it's a big change that you didn't let her know about at all while you were gone. Imo you're NTA but you should really have communicated with her about making the decision to get in shape. If she didn't like that, that's on her, but you not telling her in the first place is a big communication issue, and I can see why she would be upset about you not saying anything."
GenZ,fdnx8an,t1_fdnw541,1578594688.0,"I agree. After my first time I was left thinking ""Wow that's it? It's not all it's hyped up to be at all."""
GenZ,fdnx4r2,t3_emc4lf,1578594631.0,"You're not the only one like that. There's a lot of people I know who are seemingly sex-obsessed and act like they *need* romantic love and to be in a relationship, but people like myself, my brother and a few of my friends don't really care about sex. You might be asexual or you might just not having a driving passion for sex, but you'll have to figure out how you really feel concerning that over time. Only one of the friends I know who are like this is asexual, and as for myself I *like* sex and have a boyfriend who I have sex with, but I'm not obsessed with it and want it all the time. I could date him just like this and honestly go without having it at all too. It's not that the sex we do have is bad either, I've just become a person who could live without it too even if it feels very good. Is this similar to how you feel?"

SuicideWatch,fcntr6l,t3_ei137q,1577818247.0,"You guys are not that annoying, some adults are just self absorbed and don't want to listen to your feelings. They believe that because your brains aren't fully developed you can't feel the same shit that they feel. Of course this is wrong, and they don't care.

Source: a few years ago when I was a teenager, my dad didn't believe me either. He also don't believe me now though so what can you do ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"

SuicideWatch,fcjc4u0,t1_fcjbdib,1577682683.0,"Have you ever tried the butterfly method? Or the rubber band snap? I read about those online years ago, they weren't very helpful for me, but they might be for you! If you don't know what they are, the butterfly method is drawing a butterfly where you typically cut/where you feel like cutting in marker every time you feel like cutting. I heard of a similar strategy where you draw a line instead of a butterfly, but I think that looks too much like actual cutting. The rubber band snap is pretty much exactly what it sounds like, you snap a rubber band on your wrist when you feel the urge to cut. 

I thought of this too a few days ago that I might try out. I'm thinking of buying a small calenders and a lot of little stickers, and for every day I don't cut, I put a sticker on the day. It might be nice to see something visual other than whitening scars, at least that's my mindset on it. What do you think? Also if you feel uncomfortable with talking to anyone irl about this stuff and/or when you're down, you can message me any time, okay? :)"
SuicideWatch,fcjb5c0,t1_fcj9yi0,1577681884.0,"I hate when parents don't believe their kids when they confide in them about emotions! I wish your dad would take you at face-value. Are you comfortable with them knowing about how you're feeling right now, specifically your mom since she seems to be taking your emotions seriously (as she should). If not your parents, do you talk to any of your friends about how you feel? I just hope you have a good support network. Having loving people around who want you to be happy helps a lot. 

Also, please be careful about cutting, love. The more you do it, the more likely you are to get caught or do more damage that you didn't plan to do in that moment. It's definitely not a good habit/addiction, and I hope you can pull yourself out of it. It's definitely not fun when parents find out about it...trust me. If you're okay with me asking, what does it do for you? For me it's been a punishment tactic for myself, as well as a way to bring me back to reality through the pain. Is it anything similar for you? I've been attempting finding healthier replacements for cutting, if you'd like I can share what I've been trying to do"
SuicideWatch,fcj9oab,t1_fcj98x2,1577680750.0,"That is a sticky situation. Imo I always had a difficult time fully trusting my therapist, because when I opened up to things involving suicide, they always brought my parents in. It felt extremely exposing when this was a person I felt I could confide in and not tell anyone, and almost always caused problems for me when I got home. I can completely understand why you're uncomfortable. Putting aside breaking the law, do your parents at the bare minimum know if you're feeling suicidal? Not necessarily why, but just that you feel this way?"
SuicideWatch,fcj8zb6,t3_ehdush,1577680260.0,"I'm gonna talk to you girl to girl, you sound like you need a hug. It's completely normal to have emotions and feelings like that, and I hope you can feel good about yourself. You're a beautiful young lady, and a lot of us go through similar thoughts and emotions at your age, and years after your age. You're not alone. I was a lot like you at your age (I'm 20 now), and I know growing up sucks and growing into who you're going to be can be an awkward, emotional process. A lot of us girls sent nudes before we were 18, myself included. The body struggles are real, the need to feel validation is real, the confliction of wanting to enjoy childhood and knowing you're going to grow up too. And the feeling of paranoia due to possible consequences of your actions is very real too.

I encourage you to be safe and responsible when it comes to showing people your body, in real life before the age if consent wherever you live, and especially on the internet before you turn 18. It's a dangerous world out there, and the last thing you need is crazy people wanting to use you, especially while you're dealing with such inner turmoil. I'm glad you opened up to us, you're doing great in the fact that you're alive. I hope you can get professional help like a therapist if you're open to that, it'll be good to talk to someone you can trust outside of family and friends. But for now, us all on Reddit will be here for you if you need support!"
