OldSchoolCool,ffd61nf,t1_ffcl6mf,1579814115.0,"(This is just opinion) I don’t think he intentionally associated with them, it was just during the McCarthy communist witch-hunt when the FBI was all in hysterics and blaming a bunch of high-profile figures as communists. The FBI’s main reason for essentially exiling him from the United States was because his film “Modern Times” gave him a reputation as being a communist sympathizer. The movie is just satire on the modern/machine age (as of 1936). There was a scene where his character was arrested when he blended in with a crowd of protesters in favor of communism (I think the police were chasing him), so maybe people mis-interpreted that as him being a sympathizer. That’s just my opinion though, I think Charlie just wanted to make films and make fun of politics. Graham Green writing for The Spectator “also voiced concern that the film would be considered to be a Communist film when in reality Chaplin's message was predominantly apolitical. As Greene explains, ""[Chaplin] presents, he doesn't offer political solutions.""’ (From Wikipedia)"

I also used to love drawing and would do requests and such for people, but have just despised drawing for over a year now and I hate doing any art now. Sometimes I feel like a failure for both of those things— not being able to study abroad and quitting art— but this post makes me feel better :)"

niceguys,feftxma,t1_feeu1s1,1579065096.0,"I tried so hard to like someone who was upset I put them in the friend zone. I felt bad because I dated his best friend in high school (who I broke up with before the end of hs). So afterwards he would talk to me all the time about how he wished he had a gf and and how much he liked me. He had low self-esteem partially because I told him I just wasn’t interested. He wanted to know why and I couldn’t quite explain it, he just wasn’t the guy for me. Logically, he could’ve been because he liked video games like me, we had a similar humor, and he was smart, funny, and nice. I felt so bad because I thought “he’s all these things, why don’t I like him??” and he pointed out the same thing. I felt like it was unfair to him for me to just say “you’re just not the right guy for me, we aren’t meant to be” because I couldn’t give him logic behind it. For the next couple months I went on dates with him and tried so so hard to be romantically interested in him but I couldn’t.
Love isn’t logical, and I think that’s what a lot of nice guys get wrong (and girls). It’s more complicated than being “smart, kind, and funny.”"
