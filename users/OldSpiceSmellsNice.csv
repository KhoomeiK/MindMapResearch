RedditForGrownups,fezwb55,t3_eqwpuv,1579462494.0,"Yes and no. As a reference, problem-solving, and shopping tool, it’s amazing and incredibly convenient. Being able to have so much power and control over things like your own bank account, superannuation, and other financial accounts is fantastic. If I had the information that is available online now, years ago, it would have been great. That said...and I say this as a heavy internet user, I do think life holistically is worse off for it. People are glued to their phones (even at work), they stay in their social cliques/echo chambers and spread stupid/dangerous ideas (how we end up with flat-earth revivalists), ironically people can become disconnected/isolated from those around them, image pressure from media such as instagram is immense (I have 20 years olds at my workplace talking about botox injections), and online dating seems to have created a disposable environment. Let’s not also forget relationships affected by porn addictions, etc. While it’s true that internet experience is dependent on how one uses it, sadly, it allows a bunch of us an outlet for our negative qualities to grow (narcissism/anti-socialness/lust/addiction) and, sometimes, that seems to outshine the good. Personally, I was able to function just as well without the internet as I have been with it and, this may be my own issue, but when I think about how much time I have spent online just...browsing, I feel like it could have been far better off spent in the real world."

So many that I used to be able to wear and love, that I no longer can. It seems so unfair. Like, if I had just put on weight that would be ok, I could lose it, but how can I shift these bones?
