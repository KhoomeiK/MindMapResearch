(Sorry if it seems cynical, but if we threw in a ""by the way, the aunt's a lesbian"", no one would be surprised or bothered by her cutting off the grandmother.  Just way too many details we're missing to judge properly.)"
delusionalcraigslist,fcwg8v7,t1_fcw2m19,1578024835.0,"Working fast food for my first job, there were three different people who were full time, but would ask for their hours to be cut back towards the end of the year to avoid making too much for certain benefits.  Would they rather have a better paying job that can give them a better life working the same hours?  Absolutely.  But if they don't think they can get something that pays enough, then they'll be careful to maximize what they get in benefits."

Yes, people can understand you when you make up terms if they're familiar with the subject and understand from context.  They'll also probably know that you're using them inaccurately and judge you, appropriately, for doing so."
AskReddit,fcvg1in,t3_eixc75,1578001330.0,"I average one match per year per site, I've been on one actual date out of all the matches.  Happened to be my first date in 21 years. I was only 19 last time.  We still run into each other at various events, but a second date never really worked out.  Ended up dating someone else I knew from the same events a couple months later, lasted two weeks, longest relationship I've ever had.  (To be fair, we still hang out two to three times a week, meeting him later tonight in fact.)

So to answer your question, uh...  not well."

Same with killing in most match 3, but here you're conflating random pieces for procedurally generated maps.

The definition of a roguelike is not fuzzy, and is also not difficult even if people seem to want to make it out to be."
