Fallout,ff20n3r,t3_er3gim,1579490647.0,"My first introduction to the world of Fallout was through a crossover fanfiction that I was reading. And there was a character that was in a set of Power Armor. The description and actual artwork that was approved as ""canon"" for the character made me think that sets of Power Armor where what we see in Fallout 4. Then I decided to play Fallout 3 as my first Fallout game and I was pretty disappointed with it. So out of all the wrong they did with Fallout 4, the one right thing they did was the Power Armor."

modernwarfare,fet5n6i,t1_fet2gi1,1579372051.0,"And you are correct. That is extra weight. Upon average an infantryman in the U.S. army will be carrying around 150 Lbs of supplies, that supplies is stuff like their weapon, anywhere from 5 to 8 mags depending on the weapon they're carrying, a couple mags for their sidearm, food, water, MREs, and first aid supplies. Then there's also both their soft and hard body armor. For them to carry another weapon such as a shotgun and it's ammo for at least 3 extra reloads is gonna put another 10 to 15 pounds on you. And when you're in a combat zone, you don't want any unnecessary weight that may slow you down and make you physically tired"

He is now married to his high school sweetheart with three sons and is also the boss of a oil rig. Really awesome person, and other than me was one of the few people to be crying at my dad's funeral. He has been on the straight and narrow now for a good 20 years and is the reason I feel former felons like him should get their full constitutional rights back after a certain period of time."

modernwarfare,feaa06a,t3_eo5exb,1578946127.0,Yeah no you can get out of here with that shit. The maps are badly constructed and too camper friendly. Snd so.e of them are just straight up too big for 6v6 game modes.

Every map that isn't a classic map from CoD's franchise is just a steaming pile of shit and I dont see how they can't understand that. Their best course of action would be to take all the fan favorite maps from all  CoD games, put them in this, then let us enjoy them while they take a moment to figure out why we love the maps so much and try to emulate that with actual new maps. Instead we're gonna be teased with 1 or 2 classic maps every 2 to 3 months with a 24/7 playlist lasting only a week out of the 2 to 3 months per season."
