Jk, it's not that bad but chocolate from North America isn't made as well, not as smooth. Obviously there's some higher end chocolate too but that costs a lot more. Back home, even the cheapest chocolate ($0.90 per 100g bar) is still pretty good.

Lindt can be found at a lot of places here, I'm sure there's some malls in the States that sell them too. I'm sure you've seen those red Lindor Chocolate Balls? Amazing."

hockey,fccgbua,t1_fcbfnhn,1577598068.0,"That's awesome, congrats! So maybe you're able to answer something I've always wondered about: for refs to get to the NHL, they usually ref in juniors, then AHL and then move up to the NHL. Is that a similar path for broadcasters like yourself? Have most people on sports TV now (except for the ex-players on the panel) gone through a similar path, starting in juniors, then do some smaller leagues before broadcasting NHL games? Or is there a fast track to make it to national TV?"

Now I've skipped this Monday because it just felt right to skip it for some reason. Yesterday and today I've been really tired throughout the day, even after sleeping 8+ hours. Do you get tired when you take a break from MD'ing? Even after just missing one dose? 

I'm probably reading too much into this and the tiredness has another reason. Gonna MD again tomorrow Thursday."
