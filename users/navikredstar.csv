ShingekiNoKyojin,ffdlp3i,t1_ffdbk0e,1579823537.0,"Yeah, I have to side with this. It seems like Kenny's goal was far more important to him than familial bonds, as he left Levi to fend for himself while still in his childhood, though he did at least train him enough to feel confident enough that Levi could handle himself and survive.
  
Kenny didn't really have much capacity to care for others. His bond with Uri was probably the deepest one he'd ever had in his life, and it's apparent he did care for his sister Kuchel, since he went looking for her and seemed genuinely shocked by her death, and even Levi to *some* extent, but other than that, he really wasn't capable of caring about others. And yet, despite being a remorseless serial killer, this is a guy whose driving goal is to be able to feel and understand things like compassion, mercy, and love for humanity."

AskReddit,ffah30k,t1_ff9n1tk,1579735585.0,"That's if they even look at them in the first place. I've forgotten to take my e-cig fluid out of my messenger bag and put it in the clear ziploc bag the last several flights I've been on, and security's *never* checked it, even the two times they saw something ""suspicious"" on the x-ray machine and manually searched my bag. (The first time was  my laptop power adapter, and the second time was over an apparently shady small handful of change.)
  
Granted, the little bottle of e-cig fluid was well within size restrictions, but I'd completely forgotten to move it, and yet, they still never caught it or said anything, even the times they were actively checking my bag.
  
Edit: Also, IIRC, bottles of liquid in *checked* baggage can be larger than 3oz/100ml. The size limitation's only for carryon stuff. So the security theater BS doesn't prevent you from harm from potentially hazardous liquids in checked bags. I'm not opposed to airport/aviation security existing, but I'm not sure the TSA is really worth it. They seem to fail tests frequently, like way more than we should be comfortable with (although their incredibly lax hiring standards probably play a huge role in that)"

Shruikan was definitely underutilized, though I'm a bit torn on this. How much could he have really done, honestly? He may have been enormous in size, but he was completely insane and mentally broken, and I honestly felt more relief and pity for him when he died, because he was finally freed from his immense suffering."
Eragon,ff7fldq,t1_ff3j0yw,1579648414.0,"The description of it reminds me quite a bit of Legasov's description of how a nuclear reactor works, and what happened at Chernobyl from the HBO miniseries' final episode. It's a really simplified description of the process, delivered in a way that pretty much anyone could understand, without needing advanced education in nuclear physics.
  
I got the same vibe here with that description, the only difference being the character used magic to cause raw matter to split apart, instead of neutrons. But then, science and magic don't need to necessarily be completely at odds with each other. I mean, we used to think that turning elements into other elements (I mean like lead into gold) was magic and not possible, and while we definitely can't turn lead into gold (at least that anyone's discovered, and I'm pretty sure if it had been, someone would've gotten a Nobel Prize for it), we can turn some elements into ones lower on the periodic table by splitting them. It's something that would have seemed like magic to people even two hundred years ago, but we discovered the process. Not to mention, most of Paolini's magic system, minus the dragons' innate magic, has defined rules to it, like science."

ShingekiNoKyojin,feslvxg,t1_fepgjns,1579366605.0,"His whole thing was letting the rest of the world decide to do with the Eldians for the sins of the Eldian Empire. He figured (rightly, as it seems), that the rest of the world, starting with the Marleyans, would eradicate the Eldians for the centuries of oppression caused by the Eldian Empire and the infighting of the Eldian noble houses who held the other 8 Titan powers.
  
Given what we've seen of the first Fritz king, 2000 years ago in Ymir Fritz's flashback, there was definitely some truth to the Marleyan propaganda about the behavior of the Eldian Empire over the centuries it existed. Probably not to the full extent the current Marleyans claim - it's in their favor to paint the Eldian Empire in the worst possible light. I think Eren Krueger's the closest to the truth on it: the Eldian Empire probably was pretty shitty overall to the non-Eldians they conquered, but likely nowhere near as bad as the Marleyan propaganda states. 
  
But yeah. Karl Fritz was a pacifist, and his thing was letting the rest of the world do as it will to the Eldians. If that meant the eradication of the Eldian people, so be it."

I'd also argue the definition/interpretation of treason needs to be changed. I've seen good arguments for both interpretations of the definition of ""enemy"", as the current standard interpretation seems to be that we need to be in a declared state of war for treason to occur. This is problematic, because we haven't had an officially declared war since WWII. Granted, even if we change it, we won't be able to nail Trump on it, but it would make it easier to go after any potential future traitors, Presidents included.

I don't drive, but rather rely on public transportation or whatever, and it can be a pain to have to carry that stuff on the bus.

Our previous cat, unfortunately, *hated* going to the vet and would yowl and freak out, until the vets would bring out the warm towels sprayed with Feliway to cover him with. He'd mostly chill out then. Mostly. It sucked, though, because the poor guy had a lot of health issues late in his life and was in the vet's office quite a few times toward the end and was horribly upset by the visits to the point where the vet offered to make special home visits for him, to keep from stressing him out too badly.

AskReddit,fdifrp9,t1_fcux2dq,1578441905.0,"Honestly, for what it is, Who Killed Captain Alex is rather impressive. It's not a *good* movie by pretty much any metric, but it's a lot of fun, and it was made on pretty much no budget by a bunch of absolute amateurs in a very poor country without a real film industry. And despite all of that, it's perfectly watchable and entertaining, and it's clear a lot of heart went into making it. I'll take something like that any day over some of the big budget Hollywood stuff that *looks* pretty enough, but has no soul and is forgotten within a week of its' release. 
  
That said, I can't really criticize anyone's personal tastes in film, one of my all-time favorites is the MST3K version of ""The Final Sacrifice"". Which is *not* a good movie, but fuck if it isn't enjoyable."

ShingekiNoKyojin,fdheoqc,t1_fdgbua6,1578421059.0,"Her Ackerman ancestors almost certainly were all partial-Eldians, unless they got up into some serious incest over the years. We don't know how big the clan was after they followed Karl Fritz and prior to being mostly wiped out, but it's a good bet that they intermarried with regular Walldians during the past 100 years. The Ackerman powers seem to always be passed down to any offspring, same as any half-Eldian gains the ability to become a Titan. At least, that's my guess on it.
  
That said, I don't think it's likely Levi will become a Shifter, we don't even know if any current Shifters can transform or new mindless Titans be made at this point in the story."

Dina certainly believes she's the only royal left when she's introduced to Grisha's group of Eldian Restorationists, and unless the Owl was lying to everyone - her included (which *is* admittedly a slim possibility, but I don't think so), she was telling the truth and she was the only one left in Marley, until Zeke was born. 
  
And I think we can rule out her being a secret daughter of Dina's - Annie is a couple years younger than Zeke, and there's no chance in hell Dina and Grisha, extremists that they were at that time, would have abandoned another royal-blooded child. (And touching on the hair color thing, I think there's been far more dark-haired royals shown in the series than blondes - Rod Reiss and his kids, Historia excepted, were all dark-haired, as was his father, IIRC)"

Also, at this point in time, even if she didn't *need* to be a Titan in order for that to work, I don't think Ymir Fritz will ever again willingly obey a royal. Eren showed her she had the ability to make a choice, and she *chose* to let Eren use her powers despite his lack of royal blood."

A very well-written and entirely believable one, and a great character, but a horrible person. He's just some average person that managed to luck out and survive - there's nothing particularly special or talented about him at all. Those are the kind of people who can be the most dangerous when a nation turns to nationalism or they become radicalized. They're the ones who end up becoming pawns and doing the dirty work of their nation or group's leadership, and it's never *their* names we remember, even though they're the ones that carry out the orders.
  
So yeah, I think Floch's an abominable person (and yet, had some small factor along the way played out differently, he may not have become the monster he did - he may have always have been a petty asshole, but life is full of them, and most of them we can deal with in our daily lives, even if we don't particularly like them.), which is exactly what he's written to be. Again, I think he's a great *character*, but lots of really great characters are absolutely terrible people. Severus Snape certainly was fascinating and well-written, but even though he ended up as a double agent for the good guys, he was anything *but* a good person.
