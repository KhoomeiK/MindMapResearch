Stopping retraining for coal miners, tariffs on solar panels for no reason, massive disinformation campaigns. The main thing standing in the way are the people entrenched in the problem, and the people defending them all over this thread. Just scrolling down through this one chain, I see 6 visible posts from you, all pushing the supposed infeasibility of any alternative to sitting around and waiting until the only place on Earth capable of supporting life is a narrow strip at the top of Canada.

news,fejira4,t1_fehvy14,1579176040.0,"> the fight against pedophilia

I would reframe this as the fight against child abuse, or you're liable to have the (very powerful, media-controlling) people you're trying to fight here co-opt the small but somewhat burgeoning movements by non-offending pedophiles. The problem isn't that these people were pedophiles. That's something you are and can't change. They may not even all be pedophiles. But they are child molesters, and child molesting is an action that you do. There's much less to hide behind in the fight against child molestation, versus the fight against pedophilia."
