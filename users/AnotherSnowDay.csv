AskReddit,fepq54v,t3_eq8w4q,1579327568.0,"I'm in tech and developed a trading system used on the trading floor of one of the largest Investment Banks.  On the test  system, my friend was giving a demo of some new features we just added to our manager.  So he does a ""BUY 10,000 SHARES OF IBM"".  Normally on the test system an order would get filled in its entirety ... but I notice it is getting partial fills.  So in the middle of the demo I cut him off and ask him why it's getting partial fills .... he pauses for a second and starts shouting in a total panic ""IM ON PRODUCTION, I'M ON PRODUCTION"" then starts gasping for air and falls backwards out of his chair while still screaming ""I'M ON PRODUCTION"".

Long story short, the trade was actually executed for over $1M, the trading floor had to unwind the trade, and they wound up making a few bucks on it.  It ended up being a funny story at the firm, we made some changes to ensure it never happens again, and no one was fired."

Most drivers have at some point looked at their phone while driving ... without using auto-pilot on their car.  This is much worse than doing it with driver assist technology.

thesopranos,fcwiysd,t3_ej7bbx,1578026888.0,"I just watched the series for the first time ... and was reading the episode discussions on this sub after each one.   Bushy Top said some really off-base things in his summaries   This reminded me of one of them:

> *Upon seeing the small family leave the convenience store, Christopher realizes he has a second chance to have a family of his own. The scene also serves to show what Adriana and Christopher lost in this episode, each other.*"

> **From 2014:**  *Some owners are on their 3rd 12V battery already. Many others are reporting failures at the 1 year mark or even short of that like me. In ICE cars you can normally expect about 4 years of life out of your 12V battery. While it could just be “different” with the Model S where it may require a new battery every year, we’re seeing failures short of the 12 month mark which causes inconveniences to owners.*"

RealTesla,fbr2l6l,t3_ee72pl,1577038395.0,"If this was true, they would make a video of it, get everyone excited, and probably increase the stock price.  There is no video of it, this story is BS.   Elon said on Autonomy day that the improvements will be exponential going forward, as of the last release it is still phantom braking on highways. So there's that."
