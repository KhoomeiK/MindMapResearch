From what I remember, the GOP leadership pushed Palin on him to try and win over women voters. However I don't think many voters cared for how far right she was compared to his moderate stance. Plus Lieberman would have drawn over moderate Democrats.

It's still highly possible Obama would have won regardless because of the political climate around that campaign. However, I think it would have been much closer in battleground states."
