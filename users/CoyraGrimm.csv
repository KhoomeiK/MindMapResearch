Thritis,ff4b0rx,t1_ff42l2s,1579559432.0,"Hmm. So I would really recommend getting your HLA-B27 - test. It is a genetest. If you have the HLA-B27 gene, it is possible youhave arrhritis or any rheumatic desease for that matter. About 2/3 of people have it, not all of them get rheuma or something similar.  BUT if you do not have it, you cannot have arthritis and can rule it out, looking for another diagnosis. So it could be a way to get closer to knowing what is up. 

Really strange no one did it. Its kind of standard procedure for suspected arthitis where i live. 

I hope you get help soon!!!"

Also I eat a lot of sweets...like one bar of chocolate a day or something similar at times.

PsoriaticArthritis,fdyh62v,t1_fdqyk27,1578779724.0,"Thank you for your answer! It encourages me to try and establish a more regular routine for flares or worsening condition, kind of an emergency procedure. I am still trying to figure this desease out and taking the time to actually try different things instead of somewhat accepting my fate is taking a lot of energy.  Having hopes for different therapies, medication, diets or supplements, being disappointed if they dont work and not beeing sure if any improvement is placebo or coincidence can be a lot of work. 
It is good to hear you found your strategy of dealing with this and motivates me to find my own. A 2/10 on the scale I could live with ^^ the worst for me is the fear of damaging my tendons/joints and increasing pain if I overdo it just a tiny bit (happened before)."
Thritis,fdo1xsi,t1_fdcjdei,1578597395.0,"Hi, I currently have psoriasis arthritis with enthesitis, so basically my right and left wrists/tendons are inflamed. I love to paint and sculpt and would like to start an apprenticeship as goldsmith. I feel scared it might be to much a risk starting in a job like this with a chronic desease affecting my hands. Also i am scared i wont be able to support myself with that kind of career. On the other hand, i want to work in a field i like instead of ending up unhappy, but safe.

Do you have any insight or advice? What is your profession if i may ask? How do you cope with your desease in terms of making a living?

I would really appreciate an answer!

I have enthesitis aswell and I can do so much more since I get ultrasound therapy! It has to be specially foe arthritis though, as not to produce heat while therapy.

Also, if you are living with someone-if there are things you can not do, tell them! Be honest about it and pace yourself. If you have to move, do it in intervals and take a lot of breaks.

I take Erelzi, works well enough for me."
PsoriaticArthritis,fcuwkpz,t3_ej0rek,1577989990.0,"I am on Erelzi (Etanercept) which I think is virtually the same as Enbrel. For me it works fairly well, with the big advantage that people rarely develop antibodies, and even if they do it does not reduce the effetiveness. At least that is what I found, as well as what my rheumatologist told me.  I still have Symptoms, but it would be much worse without the biotics. I had to change from 25 mg every other week to 25 every week, 25 twice a week and now I take the ""normal"", most prescribed dosage of 50 mg / week.
I dont feel any side effects after using it for about 3 years.

I lack the professional english to translate, but I will try to summarize: Etanercept differs from most biologics in many aspects. For example it binds not only TNF-alpha, but lymphotoxine-alpha as well. The important bit of the essay is : 1% of patients appear to develop antibodies for Etanercept, but those are non-neutralizing antibodies that have not proven to reduce the effect or increase side effects."

I guess I am overly sensitive? To me, her just looking at me for food is posing the question and that feels invasive. Just as much as if she put her nose on the table or scratching my leg for attention.

Thank you for your answer!"
PsoriaticArthritis,fcs9rg4,t1_fcs2n18,1577913477.0,"Keep an eye on it. All the best for you!

For me it was like this: Etanercept helped, I had enthisitis in my achilles-tendons as well as planarfasciitis. With Etanercept I could walk longer distances drive more, etc. But at all times I still knew it was there and once I get a lot of stress or overdo it in any way it would come back. Same with getting new inflammations. If i do to much, I will have a new problem.  So etanercept raised my tolerance/threshold, but thats it."

I was only talking about Etanercept and the link you send referred to biologics in general. I was not posting my opinion, I was posting relying on the information my rheumatologist gave me. I am well aware of the risk of development of antibodies and thus reduced effectiveness.

So if you have to be salty about it, at least do your reaearch right.

I might heal better or react better to certain medications, or far worse. For all i know my arthritis could be gone and  never heard of again in a few years.

If you dont mind me asking: does your arthritis affect your joints, skin or tendons? I will talk to my doctor about a TENS-machine. I tried one for a muscular problem and it really helped, but i doubt know if it could do anything for my tendons. As for LDN-i never heard of it. I will do a little research! Hearing what helped others is always good.

I am really thankful for your answer!!! I showed my that it is worth trying. I love to paint and draw (digitally/manually)  and model (clay) and has to cut back on that massively. The 20 min -method seems a good idea. I have tried to push the interval, which might not be a good idea. I just have a hard tim stopping myself from continuing sometimes^^  

You really helped me get back my motivation and confidence!!! Especially since you have experience doing  what i want to do.

""Sometimes we do have to give up on certain dreams but first see how creatively you can solve challenges before you do that. Be realistic and adaptable.""

I am on erelzi, a biologicum and it really does a lot for me. Do not be afraid of injecting yourself, you get used to it quickly. I never had any side effects from it! 

Also, if you feel like your rheumatologist is not taking you seriously or is adjusting therapy ( for example if what he prescribed does not help) look for second opinion. 

Last but not least: high-frequent-ultrasonic therapy (dont really know if thats what its called in english) worked for me. Listwn to your body and your gut.
