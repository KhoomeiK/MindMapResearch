IndianaHoosiers,ff4kjft,t1_ff4k475,1579565840.0,"I'm not disagreeing with you at all.  His form is fugly, but it was incredibly successful for him up until he got to IU.  He was a very good shooter at Riley and in AAU ball.  
       
He was wretched last year and has improved a bit, but definitely has a ways to go.  That said, nobody else is shooting the 3 ball at a decent clip."
IndianaHoosiers,ff4jsw9,t3_er88f6,1579565326.0,"Great info.  As a South Bend guy and an absolute terrible 3 point shooting team, I'd like to see DA get some shots up.  He's crafty, but in Archie we have to trust."

hockey,felhb4a,t1_felfghb,1579222162.0,Lol.  He could barely skate at the NHL level.  He would dust most of the beer league benders around here tho.

baseball,fec4cf7,t1_fec3kq2,1578966466.0,"You literally said, 'were you alive during the era child?'
      
The difference here is the Sosa/McGuire home run chase did wonders for baseball ratings.  MLB knew damn well it was happening but turned a blind eye due to the money pouring in.  
      
It's all circumstantial when it gets down to it."
baseball,fec1pa2,t1_fec110p,1578965366.0,"Hahaha.  I was playing college baseball when this shit was getting underway young man.  I literally watched teammates balloon up King Kong style in size in the matter of 4-6 months, while the rest of us had decent to solid gains during off season workouts.  
       
Now get off my lawn!"

I've never used a Synology device but they're popular so I've been intrigued.  This would be for my home environment and I've got a 10gb backbone, because why the hell not!!?!? 
      
Appreciate the feedback and nice apartment setup!  And to note, Qnap offers a fully redundant Nas which is kinda interesting (and expensive).  It's essentially 2 systems in a box offering machine failover, kinda interesting."

DIY,fe5v9if,t3_ent9u5,1578875727.0,"Nice work.  I'm planning on something similar for the spring time, except going with storage instead of an office side.  The stamped concrete is legit tho, definitely worth the added cost."
Ubiquiti,fe5uyl2,t3_ensexs,1578875536.0,How do you like the Synology?  I've been debating picking up either a Synology or QNAP storage nas.

I have to wonder, how much of this is due to the civil issues happening in China versus loft profit margins due to the Tariff war?"

I was big on the Archie hire but the pack line D and lack of 3 point shooting don't mix.  We need to find some shooting."

subaru,fcnwiha,t3_ei07yv,1577819853.0,"Maybe it's me and my old curmudgeon ways, but I'm not a fan of the front end spoiler and rear spoilers.  On other people's cars, it's decent, but I can pull it off.  Yeah, I'm a 41 year old dad who's about to be 42, so that's part of it. 
      
That said, the rest of this car is fuggin gorgeous.  The color is so on point (wrap or paint, it's legit), to the point that the matte gray offsets the hoodscoop and makes it look wicked.  
      
Keep it up!  I currently have a 2015 dad Forester xt with the front end lifted trying to figure out my lack of heat.
     
*Edit* that front end grill/badge area is silky."

Analysis: Can't find fault with the Red Wings for taking Tyler after seeing his uncle play in the league with such longevity. Unfortunately for Bertuzzi, that is all he has going for him as the Red Wings look like they are grasping at straws right now."
