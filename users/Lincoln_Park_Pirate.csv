funny,ff9x137,t1_ff9fqvj,1579723355.0,"I used to work at Venture, an old Walmart style of store. If a shoplifter gave Loss Prevention any trouble, someone would announce over the PA a ""Code 1000"" and every male associate (I know, WTF?) showed up and the once the perp knew he was severely outnumbered, would quit resisting. Only saw that one time when a guy was stealing a few pairs of Levi's. Code went out, the perp hit the floor and a loaded gun fell out. 

I quit a few weeks later."
funny,ff9wf9b,t1_ff9eod0,1579722984.0,"That's good because they would have fired her for it. Best Buy, heck, retail in general, will give you the boot for using any physical force and for even going outside. I worked there from 1991-2000 and back then we could get REAL physical with perps. Once our Loss Prevention guy was run over by an escaping woman when she put the car in reverse while he had the door open. Tough bastard didn't miss a day of work. When I left if they suspect the perp was stealing anything over a certain dollar amount, you ""power served"" them hoping they would get the hint. If they left anyway, you just let them go. Overtime and time off for court costs more than the what they were stealing."

news,fep902v,t1_feo0qa1,1579314831.0,"You know what chaps my ass the most?  When people attach the “nut” part to gun ownership.  I own three guns.  One for CCW if I ever take the course, shotgun for home defense and one for plinking.  Does that make me a nut?  I am a gun owner, not a “nut”.  It seems that even owning one gun earns you the title, but only from non-owners.
I am not a member of a “gun club” so I can have easy access to a range.  That’s pretty much the only reason people join them.  But to join these gun clubs to have access to the range, a majority require NRA membership.  I don’t want a membership but I would like a place to work on marksmanship and refresh the skills once in a while on the weekends so I have to either wait for the rare non-member weekends where the pitch to join is worse than a timeshare sales pitch or I can find a land owner in a rural area with cool neighbors.
I would like to see public gun ranges run by city park districts like public golf courses.  Small fee for residents and higher for non-residents.  Safety officers, possibly volunteers, on staff and land to run it.  There are hundreds of parks here, many in very rural areas but an indoor one would be easier to operate.  I imagine the insurance would be a concern and taxpayer blowback would be an issue but I do think public ranges are a good idea.  But here in deep-blue Illinois that will never happen.  I guess that’s where supporting public education ends."
