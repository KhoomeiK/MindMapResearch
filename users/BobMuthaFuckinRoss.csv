AnimalsBeingBros,ffdgbkr,t1_ffdewol,1579820274.0,i've read somewhere that dogs play tug of war with an animal not to try and take it from each other but to help rip it apart. i'm not sure if that's true but i like to think when i'm playing tug with my guys we're working together for a common cause.

They're powerful and are socially awkward with other dogs with a higher potential towards dog aggression but regarding fear of new people or places I haven't seen it. Mine is a particularly bad guard dog because shes happy to see anyone who comes through the door."

That's a childish position to say you won't make any changes, you won't pay more, you won't lift a finger to reduce carbon emissions but demand the same lifestyle at the same low price, and that the energy companies need to figure out how to do all that in a carbon neutral way that pleases your moral sensibility."
