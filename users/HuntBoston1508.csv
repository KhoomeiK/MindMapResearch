oblivionmods,ff6a9yu,t1_ff6a1tt,1579622779.0,"Nah the stuff I found is related to the Ruins of Miscarcand mod. Also the Water FPS mod is largely incompatible with Better Cities, Unique Landscapes, or anything else that causes changes to water level unless you load it super early in your load order. I have instant crashes outside all cities if it's loaded too late in my list. And if it's loaded that early it means it isn't doing nearly as much. I consider it in the same category as Oblivion Script Optimization - may actually provide a benefit for the unmodded game, but needs to be ignored in the case something else changes that specific thing."

I was very disappointed with the lack of appropriate pathfinding in the entire modded zone, so I wiped everything and rebuilt it from scratch. I also fixed some small decoration issues as I found them, as well as deleting hundreds of underground objects which massively improves performance. I am very confused as to why a mod that looks so high-quality on the outside could have such a glaring issue as hundreds of buried rocks and trees, so if anybody knows better than me as to why they would be there please clue me in.

It may be some FormID thing to make it easier to update versions, but I think just not having the content there in the first place is better in the long run."

oblivionmods,fezqqtq,t1_feywxsm,1579460459.0,"LOOT and BOSS are both a little out of date but it's necessary to use them because they add special tags to your mods that help with merging them. If you haven't hit that stage yet don't worry. I actually found LOOT solved several problems for me so I would say generally it has the right idea, but you need to manually sort newer mods or ones that still have issues. Better Cities has been updated more recently than LOOT for example."
oblivionmods,feynaux,t3_eqxekb,1579447902.0,"Some things I noticed: the Unofficial Oblivion Patch needs to be loaded as soon after Oblivion.esm as possible, and all of the DLCs need to be loaded immediately after that, and then their patches. Nothing should be loaded before official content except for Oblivion Script Optimization which you don't have. Also you have both the HDR and non-HDR versions of Natural Weather installed which might actually be the problem. You shouldn't be running All Natural and Natural Weather at the same time since All Natural includes it, personally I just add the Natural Habitat and Vegitation parts of the mod. You also need to move Better Cities Full, Better Imperial City, and all Better Cities patches to the bottom of your load order or else they don't work properly, except for Better Cities.esm which needs to remain above the others. Better Cities Imperial Isle is probably conflicting because that content is included with Better Imperial City so just remove that one. You have also installed both the HD and non-HD versions of Enhanced Water. I also recommend installing New Vegas Anti-Crash which also works to reduce crashes in Oblivion, as well is the RefScope mod which adds an in-game tool to help diagnose any conflicts you may find. Since you're also installing a bunch of landscape mods you may want to run LandMagic which smooths out any holes you may find throughout the world."

vintagecgi,fes8h5t,t3_eqdspu,1579362529.0,"""Feature creep"" is a major problem with subreddits. But also, if subs don't adapt, they die. Personally I would much rather this sub stick exclusively to actual vintage content, that I why I come here. We have a term for new things that try to mimic an older style - retro. You're not allowed to dress a Prius up like a Clydesdale and ride it in a vintage car show so why should we let people promote their content? It's hard enough to find ""non-Hot"" content on Reddit anyways, if somebody came to this subreddit looking for actual vintage content and sorted by Top or Hot, would you want them to see art from the 60's-90's or something somebody just whipped up in Houdini and put some filters on it to look like a 90's CGI piece? If it's growth we're looking for, the sub will only ever get as popular as vintage art as a whole. 

Even if we made a flair system to sort things, actual vintage content would slowly become less popular until I could post something legit and it won't go anywhere unless it is a high enough quality to compete with modern artists. And that is what I'm afraid of - I'm here because actual vintage content has a very different aesthetic to it. If I wanted to see contemporary retro 8-bit content there is a seriously huge market out there I could tap into.

It's just like /r/glitch_art. It started off as legit, random computer glitches that looked aesthetic, and now it has transformed into a place for people to share their contemporary glitch-inspired art, but now there is very few actual glitches to be seen."
