And while not menstrual related, I have another friend who had an unknown medical issue and had to bounce through probably at least 15 different doctors because they either couldn't find anything wrong with her or just flat refused to listen to her symptoms.

I. Am. Poor.

I can't afford to go to the gym, I can't afford to go do things where people are, and I especially can't afford a therapist because this is America and even if I had insurance, mental health would likely not be covered.

And I'm sorry to hear about your mom's struggle. However, calling that hotline is a fast track to an even more ruined life for me. I'd be thrown in a psych ward and therefore lose my job due to no show, which would cause me to lose everything else I'm already struggling to keep.

You should stop thinking there's hope for everyone though because there's not for me. Not without a miracle and as I said, I'm an atheist, so miracles don't exist.

*Herself*. Girls can get away with doing things alone. Guys get sad looks.

>There is not a swing dance club in the united states that's going to call you lame for showing up by yourself.

That's irrelevant if there's no such thing anywhere nearby.

> Ultimate frisbee. Kickball league. Disk golf club. Join a gym. DND. Volunteer work. Bars.  Karaoke nights. Board game groups. Some towns have LAN meet ups for video games. A church if you're a Christian. Going to the park and reading a book (probably a summer activity.) I've met people by reading whatever is popular at the time. That's probably the worst way to meet people though, though holding a physical book these days seems like a conversation piece.

You didn't read a word of what I said. None of those things exist around here except bars, churches, and gyms and I'm a poor atheist. As for gyms, that's get in, work out, get out. You don't meet people at a gym. No one wants to be bothered. As for volunteer work, I already have one full-time job.

>Alternatively, Ok cupid. Tinder. Plenty of fish. Bumble. I know there are more. Ok cupid I have the best luck with. You can actually kind of message people on there. I'll get a response out of maybe 1/8 messages which isnt bad in my opinion. Saying something about their profile or making a joke.

Again, you clearly didn't read what I said. Dating apps do not work for me because I'm below average and uninteresting. Not even bots swipe right on me.

> If you go to those places with the purpose of I WILL FIND A SOUL MATE, or I NEED SOMEPLACE TO PUT MY PENIS you absolutely will not have as much luck as if you go to those places looking to make a friend and try to pretend like you're a normal human. That's what I do. You'll have the best luck making friends and connections in person in my opinion. But if you have that poor attitude towards going out ""people who do x are seen as losers""

I never said ***I*** see them as losers. I said ***people*** see them as lame. Which is true.

> You'll be fine friend.

I won't though. I'm gonna die alone and probably by my own hand.

>Fake it till you make it 100% works.

No it fucking doesn't. I can't fake an emotion I've never felt."
