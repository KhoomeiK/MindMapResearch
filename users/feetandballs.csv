MovieDetails,febm61f,t1_fe8ho9v,1578960269.0,"Ok. I don’t normally do math, but why not?

Peter Parker is 5’10” according to a couple google searches. The average American male is 5’9” (69 inches - heh) according to a 2015-16 CDC health survey, meaning Peter is about 1.5% taller than average. 

Using the average length of an adult male femur (18.9 inches [source](https://www.orthopaedicsone.com/display/Review/Femur)), we can estimate that Peter’s femur is 19.2 inches. Using [this page’s illustrations](https://my-ms.org/anatomy_nervous_system.htm ) and the “muscular branches of the femoral nerve” that are visible directly above Peter’s tingler in the screengrab, we can assess that this nerve is typically illustrated at around 80-85% the length of a femur. That puts it around 16  inches starting from the pelvis. I’m on my phone so I just used a ruler to approximate their relative lengths and the tingler is about 45% the length of the nerve branch, or 7.2 inches - not too shabby, spidey.

Bonus: it looks like he has some girth. It’s hard to estimate girth, but I’d say about 1.75 inches flaccid (presumably) from top to bottom looking from the side. Hide yo wife.
