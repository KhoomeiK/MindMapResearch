worldnews,ff48grl,t1_ff3rcsv,1579557823.0,"I think it's a problem also be to be blamed on national governments. If states and countries don't have labour laws to stop employers exploiting workers they'll continue to do so. In fact they'll *have to*, in order to maximise shareholder value. If it's forbidden, they'll find profitable loopholes. That's all they really care about."

news,fet6j09,t1_festsyp,1579372212.0,"Yeah. Some people are just bad but a lot of people who do bad stuff have already been broken. Does that excuse their actions? No. Does it help their victims? Also no. But brutality, rape, and violence seems to be a self-perpetuating cycle, and it's depressing to see people on here - who probably aren't bad people themselves - wanting to add to that cycle. FFS guys - this story is about a horrible person who did horrible things and you want to do more of the same? 

The only reasonable path I can see is to focus on helping victims, to educate, to try to learn our way past 'an eye for an eye'. And also to lock away people who do shit like this so they can never harm anyone again. Society deciding to lock someone up - IMO - doesn't leave a stain on your soul or push you into that cycle of pain and retribution in the way that some of the suggestions I've read here definitely would.

I don't know we remove this cancer from our society, but I'm pretty sure we can't torture and kill our way past it."

todayilearned,fdhbunj,t1_fdgwsgr,1578419595.0,"I worked at a recycling centre and I've seen *so many* oil paintings go into the landfill pile. At least one a day for the time I was there. We had a gallery of the worst. Seems like lots of people have a phase where they decide they're the next Monet or whatever. Most of them you could identify the subject, sort of, but lots of people seemed to paint large turds. Or maybe dogs, trees, cows, ships, houses - they all look like a large turd when expressed in the brush strokes of an incompetent oil painter. 

TBF that shit isn't easy. We also found a load of discarded oil paints and had a go on our breaks. My self portrait looked like I had radiation poisoning and was melting. 

We found all sorts of stuff. It's amazing what people throw out. Essentially, pretty much everything they buy. Actually it makes you ultimately disgusted with humans generally, we're so fuckin wasteful we don't deserve this world and probably won't have it much longer."
