Like think of it you’ve never been into exercise, but then you go sprint a few miles just the once . You’re sore to even touch, sore to move, let alone walk the next few days. But deal with it a few days, that soreness goes away. And then a month later you do it again. And repeat every month.

It’s like that, only in your mouth. Your teeth ache just sitting in your mouth, let alone trying to eat. But then after a few days the pain subsides, you can eat normally again, it finally let up. Then a month later the braces are tightened again, and the process repeats."

ATBGE,ff8l9w2,t1_ff8k2zm,1579684002.0,"My point is, tattoos are generally obviously a tattoo. This is designed to look like dirty hands. That’s the issue. If nobody sees? Do your thing. But the moment you want a customer facing position, you’re not getting it because you don’t look like you know how to wash your hands. And customers (and people in general) don’t like that.

I’m in a professional role now. I have a ton of colleagues with full sleeves, some with neck tattoos, a few with tattoos on their face. That’s fine, generally nobody cares unless they just have a weird boomer complex about tattoos anyway. But if someone had a tattoo that is intended to make them appear like they don’t wash their hands, the most basic step in the prevention of spreading disease? I don’t know anyone who would think that’s cool in any workplace setting. Nobody likes a Typhoid Mary, and the guy who looks like he doesn’t wash his hands is going to be the one blamed."
ATBGE,ff8kwut,t1_ff8k2zm,1579683448.0,"Me personally? I look past it, it wouldn’t even phase me, especially since it’s not specifically designed to look like dirty fingers. If I saw what I picture in my head by your description? I’d just assume it’s either fading tattoo, or they work as a hair stylist and got funky colored hair dye on their fingers. Lots of people work two jobs, and my sister always somehow gets hair color on her hands, no matter what. That’s fine either way. I honestly don’t care what art someone has on their body (ok maybe I clutch my pearls at a swastika or ss tats or something like that.. that’s just awful)  but those aren’t designed specifically to look like they don’t wash their hands. What you’re describing doesn’t sound like something someone who’d never met soap hands would look like.

But this is specifically designed to look like dirty fingers. And if my server or bartender or the person I could see who’s cooking my food, had tattoos resembling dirt smeared on their hands, I’d probably politely bow out and find somewhere else to go. 

If he’s in a closed kitchen? Tat shit smears on your hands for all I care. Just keep them clean. But if a customer can see it, it affects everyone, everyone’s tipshare, customers will leaves if they notice and care. You’re going to wear gloves every shift, and that makes for miserable sweaty hands."

If management is cool with someone who appears to not know the basics of hand hygiene just handling food bare handed, that isn’t a restaurant that anyone needs to eat at.

Again, I think you’re having a hard time grasping the difference between someone with tattoos vs someone who looks like they need a formal introduction to soap. This isn’t a “tattoo bad” convo."

Or are your friend’s tattoos supposed to look like shit and dirt smeared all over his arms, neck and face? That’s the only way your point would make sense.

This isn’t a “ooh tattoo bad” point, it’s a “you look like you haven’t washed your hands” point."
nursing,ff8d0xx,t3_erzcsb,1579673452.0,"Hospital politics are something... 

One of our new grad nurses started dating one of the surgery residents when she was still in school. She worked with us an entire *year* before anyone figured out they were dating. She took care (good care, at that!) of his patients, never was chatty with him at work, literally nobody had any idea. It was nothing but professionalism. There wasn’t even anything on either of their facebooks. But someone saw them out to dinner one night, mentioned it to her at work her next shift and she was like “yeah we’ve been together for two years..? My personal life isn’t my work life?” Then suddenly she wasn’t allowed to take surgery patients anymore. I thought it was bullshit then, and I think it is now. 

So when I started dating one of our critical care fellows, I kept that shit under wraps. A few months later I got a position as house supervisor, and then we weren’t so secret anymore. Not like making out in the hall or even me calling him by his first name in the building, but we would walk out together after shifts. Maybe grab breakfast with other coworkers (who were already friends with both of us) after a night shift. Most people love him, so when they heard I was dating him they were nothing but happy for us. But a few people suggested I got the house sup position because I was fucking a doctor, even though nobody knew when I got the job. And when he was voted resident of the year by the nursing staff later that year, a few of his colleagues flat out said he only got it because he was fucking the nurses. 

It’s bullshit. Doctors are people, they aren’t some deity to be placed on a pedestal. They can have friends who aren’t doctors. Can a CNA be friends with a nurse? Or does that insult the hierarchy too??"

And in Oklahoma it’s politeness bordering dangerous, you could be waiting to pull out of a parking lot into the road waiting for traffic to clear and people will just stop in the middle of the road to let you out. Or “my light just turned green but that car opposite doesn’t have a protected turn arrow but they got to the intersection first, I’ll wait for them to go even though I have the right of way.”

I envy it, but I’m also kinda lazy. Mine is just a tire track packed mess, I’ll shovel it if I have time, but I’m not waking up at 4am to do it before work when it’s just an inch or two, I’ll get it when I get back since it’s gonna snow more before then anyway.

Anyway, one of my first prenatal appointments was in the same clinic my husband works in. My midwife knew him in passing, but he wasn’t able to come to the appointment with me. And I was sick, like the worst cold I’d ever had, I was miserable. My midwife comes in with her computer and asks how I’m doing, and as I’m telling her I’m sick with this horrid cold, I feel the tears starting, and I’m trying to fight them because I’m a grown ass woman who should be able to have a cold without coddling, but the more I fight them the more they fight me. And she is listening but not looking at me, she’s typing in her computer my answers to all the questions she’s asking, when she gets to the “do you feel safe at home” question. And I answer yes, I do, and just as she’s about to ask the next question she looks up to see a puffy eyes half crying me, and it looks like I’m reacting to the question she’d just asked and that I’m lying about feeling safe at home. She gently approached the subject several times during our appointment, and it took several appointments with my husband with me that she finally believed that I’m just a big cry baby when I don’t feel good and that my husband and her coworker isn’t this abusive monster. I even brought it up one appointment and she said she wasn’t sure I was telling her the truth at the time.

I only have one food allergy, am the least picky eater in the world, and I’ve never been to a party or dinner where every single dish has oysters, so it’s never really concerned me, but hosts still always ask. It’s basic manners."

I’m sorry!” It was all true, I didn’t have any bills later than $10. I didn’t realize what she was trying to pull for years until I learned about people doing this. I was so naïve.

A few weeks ago I paid for stuff at the store and hit the cash back button for $40, but while the cashier was getting my change, she was chatting with me and instead of getting me $40, she got me $20. I noticed as I was putting it in my wallet, and mentioned it. I can see how it looked a lot like I was being chatty to cause  her to not pay attention, and while I think she believed me, she had to call a manager over to count her drawer to be sure. Her drawer was $20 over, so it all worked out, but the minor wait time to me was nothing compared to the protection that cashier had. I would feel bad if she didn’t have that added security."

I nearly ran into mark and almost spilled a TON of water on him, but somehow I didn’t, and also didn’t realize who I almost soaked until he held the door for me and smiled at me. I could have died, he was so polite and gracious. And you could tell the moment he realized I recognized him, and his demeanor never changed, just polite and wonderful.

They looked incredibly dated.
