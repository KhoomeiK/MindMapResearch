Do you think he'd devise a system that just cuts out completely and drops you to the ground when you get hit by lightning?  Lawyers in the future world of 2015 are no joke.

IdiotsInCars,fdzr2e7,t1_fdyvs4u,1578793846.0,"On most cars the engine definitely does not easily overpower the brakes. This isn't remotely true.

When there were all those stories about run-away throttles in Toyotas, Car & Driver [found](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a16576573/how-to-deal-with-unintended-acceleration/) that at 100mph WOT, a 268hp Camry was able to stop completely within 88ft of its closed-throttle stopping distance

It took a Stage 3 Roush Mustang (400ftlbs torque) WOT to overpower the brakes at 100mph, and it still managed to stop the car eventually."

A kid who's helped do it a handful of times could easily enough.

I'd be worried about htem operating the oven but the dude doesn't say the kid did that on their own. It's plausible.

On the other hand this could easily be a guy not confident in his cooking skills offloading the outcome onto their kid so it's more impressive."
thatHappened,fcw0zib,t1_fcvywl6,1578014635.0,"It all depends on how much effort you feel like putting in and what materials you're starting out with.

They sell premade roll-out pizza dough in a can, mixes you just add water too, or you can repurpose like biscuit dough if you're desperate I guess. 

To actually mix a pizza dough its just a packet of yeast, like 2c flour, some warm water, little bit of sugar for the yeast and just mix it up for a very basic dough. Its VERY simple to make a dough like what you see in the image."
