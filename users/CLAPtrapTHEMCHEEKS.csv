I don’t need a smaller, bigger or different colored government , I need one that’s gonna make sure I don’t have to call around for a decent quote on fixing a broken leg as every one of 4 major insurance providers scramble it’s teams of lawyers to figure out how to avoid paying for people’s treatment.

You understand that an insurance company’s best case scenario is not having to pay for your treatment right? And most of the time a hospitals best case scenario is you needing whatever treatment they can inflate the price of the most? Specifically to rip money from the hands of patients, insurance companies or sometimes both. This is the system you want to keep in place because....???

‘I’ve never had a major medical emergency and I never will, me and my family are actively invincible’

‘I don’t like paying for other people’s treatment even tho that’s literally how insurance is supposed to work’

‘Government bad. I want less regulation and somehow expect that to work for me, even tho it hasn’t so far’

AskAnAmerican,fdkutew,t3_elk12c,1578511605.0,"My thoughts are that this is fucking idiotic, no one that might die for this war actually wants this war, I’m sure most Iranian people don’t want to fight a war sparked by the murder of some shady ass dude in a shady ass branch of their military, I assume this because wars are waged and won purely for profit nowadays. Literally ONE DUDE chose to bomb Soleimani, not Congress, not the American people they are trying to represent, not the people that will be shot at by Iranians, should such an encounter come to pass. And you know what the worst part is? My life goes on! I’m not at threat of being bombed or shot at, and as soon as the next thing to get views is picked up by the news stations then I stop hearing about it. My country is being dragged along for some war that I have no say in, no stake in, and no reason for. AT MOST what I can do is hope that no one gets nuked, cause then I have to pay attention"
