TwoXChromosomes,fep8tus,t3_eq6mw2,1579314720.0,"I have the same issue. I'm 36, and most people say that I'm around 25. At my last job, I was the methodology developer and teacher, and had such difficulties with the senior engineers that have been with the company for years. They called me ""p√∂jk"" which is roughly ""kiddo"" in swedish. Not all, for sure but many of them just didn't like to be tought by a ""kid"". This bothered to such degree that I was almost ready to throw in the towel. I had the best talk with my manager (at that time) and I never forget what he said to me: 
You are put there for a reason. You are brilliant in your field. If the old guys are so ignorant with their noses high up in the air.. then they don't understand  what's best for them anymore and it's by any means their own loss. 
Screw them. 
Own them. 
Take your place. 
No one can take your knowledge and contributions away from you..

That moment changed the way I look at this things. 

A month ago another colleague called me ""just a baby"" and I replied with a big smile: YEAH! Thanks, I can still get away with it?

Edit: some spelling correction."
