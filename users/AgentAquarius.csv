DungeonWorld,ffau3xn,t1_ff90c30,1579744527.0,"Must be my small sample size, then, since the PbtA games I have rules for average at 4.

One of my RPG groups has played Shadow of the Demon Lord a couple times. I can see where it has less complexity than D&D, but I think in our case it works well for us. For me, it's the grimdark setting that makes me want to play it only in short bursts.

If there was going to be a fifth stat for this hack, I'm thinking it'd be a ""Magic""/""Mystic"" stat, sort of like AW's Weird. It'd be the Wizard's shtick, and show up in some of the more powerful/spiritual moves like the Barbarian's For The Blood God or the Druid's Elemental Mastery."
DungeonWorld,ffasjsa,t1_ff98jzx,1579743495.0,"That's on me for making a poor choice of paraphrasing. The goal is to make each attribute have a clear and distinct purpose, and I looked at other PbtA games as a reference point for this hack.

numenera,fel9gpi,t3_epmcyt,1579216973.0,"Because of how Cypher System makes difficulty levels based on multiples of 3 on the dice, I'm wondering how a 3d6 version would work (3-18).
It makes Level 1 obstacles routine and Level 6 harder to pass by luck alone, with an average just above Level 3.
Maybe adjust the 17-20 effects to be based on how many sixes the roll shows."

Dungeons_and_Dragons,fefvq1x,t1_fedptuu,1579066746.0,"One of my favorite PCs was from a Pathfinder 1e campaign: my Ifrit named Mars who was a low-Int, high-Cha multiclass Fighter (Brawler) & Cavalier (Daring Champion) and wielded a spiked shield.

The GM was running a Spelljammer-type reskin of the Skull & Shackles module. I decided Mars had been told too many times that ""you're destined for great things"" in an attempt to keep him on the right path, and was trying to break free to do his own thing. He was gullible enough to join the pirate crew of his own accord without realizing what he was getting into. After continued abuse from the captain, the party was pushed to defend themselves and seize control of the ship, with Mars as the new captain.

I'd give him the Chariot card to represent the ship the party commandeered, their victory over the tyrannical captain, and his ongoing flight from destiny."

DungeonWorld,fec5x07,t3_eo71jf,1578967160.0,"A few other comments have mentioned some moves being ""boring"", which I would specify that Dungeon Stew and several Cuisines just grant +1 to certain rolls. If you have the Class Warfare book, there's a Blue Mage class which might spur some ideas, especially since you have Quina as an inspiration. Overall, I think you should reconsider what focus makes this playbook unique from the default options (what does having a specialist cook bring to the party?), then tailor the starting moves and a handful of advanced moves towards that.

How about a move where offering to cook cuisine of a certain kind or quest to get an ingredient valued in that cuisine gives you leverage to Parley with that society? Or a move where offering to share a big meal with one or more NPCs lets you get to know them better, to spur on roleplaying and story hooks?

Things I like already: the Undead race option, the alignments, Meat Thermometer, Hot Skillet, Pudding/Vegetable Empathy (though I think Vegetable should be available at level 2-5)."

numenera,fdny7cz,t3_emdna4,1578595257.0,"Your Might/Speed/Intellect pools have no direct effect on your attacks or other actions, in contrast to how most other RPGs will have your base stats modify your rolls.

Your pools are more like wells of stamina -- some abilities cost points to activate, you can spend points to modify difficulty as you mentioned, and taking damage deducts points. The only ways pools affect your actions is:
* If you don't have enough points to spend on the activation of an ability, then you can't use that ability.
* If an obstacle is level 7 or higher and you can't apply enough Effort or other modifiers to bring the difficulty to 6 or below, then you have no chance to succeed on the roll."

DnD5e,fdctgas,t3_eklq5r,1578283825.0,"I'm imagining a villain that's like a mix of a lich and Genie Jafar from Return of Jafar. They're literally unkillable because their soul/essence/power source is contained in another object (phylactery, lamp, etc.) The party must find the object and destroy it to defeat the villain.

Maybe one quest is finding the item, and then another encounter is completing the ritual to destroy it while also having to fend off the villain, his minions, etc."
