BadMUAs,ff3v05t,t3_erdxk3,1579549444.0,"I was also the victim of some poor microblading. It was not as bad as this but it was pretty terrible. She cut far too deep into my skin and I bled like crazy. The dye didn’t keep and turned into an ashy gross brown color that almost looked grey. I also lost a lot of my eyebrow hair in the process. I will never have it done again.

Edit: spelling"

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fen31ds,t1_femhrsh,1579275860.0,All the jackets look like cheap plastic. I know they are supposed to be vegan but these look awful. I have seen better fakes Walmart. There are some super gorgeous vegan leather jackets but this is just cheap looking.

spoiledbachelor,feil67m,t3_ep75mb,1579141096.0,This post was shadow banned? Why? I saw it earlier today and I saw some conversations happening but nothing really that bad.
relationship_advice,feij4x5,t3_epajp9,1579139727.0,You will never regret this decision. Your cats are your babies. I am sorry about the end of your relationship but I firmly believe that this means someone better is out there for you. A person that wouldn’t force you to make that choice.

weddingshaming,feiho2k,t3_ep4qqr,1579138762.0,43??!? He is 43 years old? I thought he was maybe 23 based on his comments and arrogance. I am absolutely blown away. I really hope she just runs very far away from him.
awfuleverything,feigxbx,t1_fehx4sn,1579138271.0,What’s so sad is that I can see this being a legitimate headline.
bridezillas,fegh50c,t1_feg1ejy,1579092588.0,"I am very frugal and we had a very inexpensive wedding because I wanted more money for a honeymoon and a house post wedding. However, when it came to my dress, I did want something that made me feel beautiful. During my search for a dress, I found out that average for wedding dresses anywhere between $2500-$5000. $10,000 it’s considered high end. I spent $1,200 and don’t regret it. It was the most money I ever spent on a single garment but on my wedding day, I felt amazing. My husband fully supported me when it came to what I wanted for a dress. It blows my mind that even after the Brides family offered to pay, he still thought that wish was a better option."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fefnmz6,t1_fefmie2,1579060283.0,Yes! This had my rolling! She is sooooo concerned about vaccines yet let’s this scumbag impregnate her AGAIN. I just can’t with her.
oddlysatisfying,fefmn6k,t3_eorbz1,1579059622.0,This is my childhood dream. I always wanted to make a super large snake. I was also so disappointed in those little puny “fireworks”.
Delightfullychubby,fefferg,t1_fef6pso,1579055176.0,Nothing dramatic about that. I would line up right next to you.
weddingshaming,fef9ioy,t1_feexmls,1579051365.0,"I have known three people to buy wedding dresses on the Wish. Here is a synopsis of each experience:

Friend 1: the dress came smelling like sewage. The dress itself was ok, not exactly like the photo but it fit her somehow. But she couldn’t get the sell out. She tried everything and it kept selling like dead fish. 

Friend 2: the dress came with smashed and dead bugs in the fabric of the skirt. It had stains on it which she believed was from bug guts.

Friend three: the dress came exactly one month before her wedding and the top did not cover her nipples. It only covered and 1/4 of her boobs so her nips were just hanging out. 

Wish is the worst."
weddingshaming,fef94pw,t1_feepusz,1579051104.0,Yeah the market on those pieces of shit products are insane. The dress might be $100 but it’s worth like $2.50.
weddingshaming,fef90zn,t1_feeozbj,1579051036.0,"I am a VERY frugal person but when I got married I wanted something that I felt amazing in. I did find a dress for $1,200 and I don’t regret it one bit. I am normally very self-conscious and I didn’t want to feel that way when I got married. I paid for the whole thing myself. This guy just fucking sucks if he doesn’t give his fiancé the grace and understanding to maybe spend a little extra on something that will make her happy for her wedding day."
weddingshaming,fef8kpt,t3_eopjgl,1579050738.0,"My mom, when she was trying to be polite would say, “that guy is a real pride of work”. This dude even goes beyond that description. What an asshole."

90dayfianceuncensored,feedgkf,t1_feec516,1579031487.0,I hate how much pressure they put on her to act a certain way. They seem possessive to the point of just being unhealthy. Let Blake live his life.
90dayfianceuncensored,feed947,t1_feebnvq,1579031366.0,"I think the only supportive friend out of the whole season has been Sarah, Michael’s ex wife. But Blake’s friends seem super petty."

We went all over the country and met some amazing people and had some amazing experiences. The last two adjectives I would EVER use to describe the people and country would be filthy and broken.

Everyone I know who uses this hashtag does it because they think having a boy makes them special because boys are harder to raise than girls.  (Which I DO NOT agree with) Now, some women might use this in maybe a joking way but from my personal experience, they think having a boy elevates them to some special status in life. Honestly, I am going to go out on a limb and believe that this hun uses it because she believes she is superior for having a boy."
