But realistically, tho? Yeah, she's not beating Valentina in any area of MMA. Like, literary, Val would crush her in every single area possible."
MMA,ff2tpsp,t1_ff2qczb,1579523767.0,">Correction, they were actually 2nd degree BJJ black belt.

You got it backwards. You can't be a BJJ black belt at 17, nevermind second degree. Lol. Maybe they were karate black belts. You can find those in cereal boxes.

MMA,ff2lzid,t1_ff21ez5,1579512515.0,Quite a bit better is not enough to even consider her beating Bullet. She would maul her. Easily.

Pretty much summed up all his stand-up career."

MMA,ff2lkhu,t1_ff2dyvw,1579511881.0,I mean. Valentina has fought 145ers in Holly and Nunes. Nunes has so much power she fucking KOd Cyborg. Mayce has absolutely nothing on Val.
MMA,ff2ler8,t1_ff1wkon,1579511646.0,"Yeah. I thought the same. I thought she was at 115 and said, okay, maybe she has a chance, then look her up and it said she was at 125, and just thought ""yeah, that won't happen"". I couldn't believe how many people wanted her to be given a title shot. Like, do you want her to be KOd worse than Eye? Because that's what will happen."
MMA,ff2l877,t1_ff2cfkl,1579511379.0,What the fuck. And she is one of the UFC's biggest names.

MMA,ff2l1fh,t1_ff1yuv7,1579511098.0,I mean. Bullet is the champ. Those hopes would have been crushed either way.

She absolutely was."
MMA,fezxr2d,t1_fezxaui,1579463080.0,"Well, I said that she never will be champ as long as Val is there, and then you said something about age and Val retiring. So, yeah, I guess we were just throwing things at it."
MMA,fezvqo7,t1_fexabkr,1579462283.0,That's what I said. They don't deserve to even be ranked at any weight.
MMA,fezlyfs,t1_fezewz2,1579458822.0,"Yeah, but at her age Val was already a 16x Muay Thai world champ. I mean, there's level to this. I even think Grasso has more chances to be champ than her at 25."
MMA,fex2e7c,t1_fewzhna,1579423187.0,And his chin is also legit AF. Yeah. Not a good fight for Conor at all.
MMA,fex1r0z,t1_fex063s,1579422900.0,"But let's face it, Cerrone doesn't belong in the top 5 at WW. I mean, look at that fucking shark thank. Same with Pettis and Nate."

MMA,fewntt8,t1_fewnnw0,1579416164.0,Nah. You are downplaying other fighters achievements just because it happens that Conor beat a dude they also beat. Gathje even beaten him in RD1 as well.
MMA,fewnkeu,t1_fewng7h,1579415862.0,"No, that's your biased opinion. Facts is that Conor has beaten nobody yet to even be considered for title contention at any weight. Will he be there, maybe, I hope he does, but does he deserves it right now? No fucking way."
MMA,fewngbc,t1_fewnbal,1579415732.0,"Exactly. Bro, Bokamoto fucking asked him, will you wrestle? And the dude said no and he was dead serious."

Get your facts straight."
MMA,fewn5sn,t1_fewmex4,1579415409.0,"Tony is on an 13 win streak, Gaethje is on a three win streak, this is Conor's first win in 4 years. Not a fair comparison."

Edit: misspelled ""fuck""."

MMA,fewmu61,t1_fewmkwi,1579415057.0,"Lol. Yeah, Conor doesn't stand a chance vs Usman, not even Masvidal I'd say."
MMA,fewmt0g,t1_fewml1c,1579415022.0,I'd see him vs Poirier TBH.
MMA,fewmqoy,t1_fewmm4t,1579414951.0,"Nah. We all said that Cowboy was a journey man. Literally everyone said it. I gave him more chances than anyone because the fight was at welterweight, but he was in a two fight losing streak, now three. Let's not act that like he had a big change, and he went in there with the most idiotic game plan."

MMA,feol91d,t1_feof30e,1579301724.0,Ok. That's how she won then.
MMA,feny18v,t1_fenxxni,1579292540.0,Yeah. Because Holly was scoring points and GDR was doing actual damage.
MMA,fenncqh,t1_fem0lpg,1579288131.0,"But, I mean, GDR was playing with her. I mean, she was a total bitch with all those fouls, but still Holly did nothing."
MMA,fenn1k0,t1_femfa5e,1579288073.0,Cannonier about to murder someone else before that title shot. He vs Izzy would be a fucking banger.

MMA,felm9iu,t1_felb1wk,1579225556.0,"And at 170 where his power doesn't translate that well, with Masvidal that has a hell of a chin. Yeah, I see him losing as well."
MMA,felm5k0,t1_fell0vs,1579225480.0,"And I don't think anyone here can imagine the level of a star he is in Russia. The dude is literally selling out entire stadiums for only press and conferences.
