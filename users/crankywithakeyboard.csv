My husband brought home food from the restaurant (he's a cook) today.  I ate a bit then gave the rest to the dog.  Then he made mashed potatoes with gravy for dinner.  I did not eat any.  Carbs are so addictive for me these days.  Dude's killing me.  üò•

fatlogic,fd26roa,t1_fczqv4r,1578142569.0,I think because the surgery makes a pouch which serves as a smaller stomach.  And that pouch getting full sends out satiety signals to the brain to tell us that we are no longer hungry.  So the issue is we don't want food getting pushed through to the rest of the stomach (which is not artificially small so it takes a lot more to feel full).  Since the lap band involves no cutting of any intestine tissue (which happens in things like the bypass) there is no reduction in any nutrient or calorie absorption so that smaller stomach pouch is really the only mechanism by which it works.

No specific workouts or eating plans.  You log your weight at least once a week.  You log your steps and/or exercise minutes daily or weekly.  There are team to team competitions weekly.  You set a goal weight at the beginning.  Weight loss is not what counts; percent of the team that weighs in is what counts.  Very fun and motivating!

Anyway, one of the rules is don't drink with meals or within 30 minutes to an hour after meals.  If you do, it pushes the food through quicker and you get hungry fast.  I have really been neglecting this rule forever because I sip water or tea all day and get very hungry as a result.  Like almost intolerably hungry.  So the past few days I have strictly followed this rule and am staying full longer.  I am setting timers, etc.  It is a big help.  Note to self:  follow the damn rules!"
