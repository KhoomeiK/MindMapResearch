The open end of the syringe may be fitted with a hypodermic needle, a nozzle or tubing to direct the flow into and out of the barrel.

The difference is in WWII we were fighting agaisnt Nazi's and defending ourselves from imperialist Japanese who attacked first, and for most of Vietnam we were attacking people who preferred communism to capatalism. 

As soon as we crossed the 17th parallel the American army was no longer fighting for the right to self determination but against it, and we were forcing our youth to go die while doing it. It was inherently un-American,  and the people knew this."

>Indeed, the term is older than most of the people here:

>>Since the late 1950s, aerospace engineers have used the term ""unobtainium"" when referring to unusual or costly materials, or when theoretically considering a material perfect for their needs in all respects, except that it does not exist. By the 1990s, the term was in wide use, even in formal engineering papers such as ""Towards unobtainium [new composite materials for space applications]."" The word unobtainium may well have been coined in the aerospace industry to refer to materials capable of withstanding the extreme temperatures expected in re-entry. Aerospace engineers are frequently tempted to design aircraft which require parts with strength or resilience beyond that of currently available materials.

>>Later, unobtainium became an engineering term for practical materials that really exist, but are difficult to get. For example, during the development of the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane, Lockheed engineers at the ""Skunk Works"" under Clarence ""Kelly"" Johnson used unobtainium as a dysphemism for titanium. Titanium allowed a higher strength-to-weight ratio at the high temperatures the Blackbird would reach, but its availability was restricted because the Soviet Union controlled its supply."

The people who took time to register voters and engage with their community are amazing, but ultimately it took people getting over the idea that their vote didn't matter to affect change."
