mildlyinfuriating,fbsif69,t3_ee5xcs,1577055662.0,"I worked at Jamba Juice for nearly 2 years during high school and any baked goods that are put out and not sold are supposed to be thrown away at the end of the day, which would drive me nuts. 

So my solution was to throw all the baked goods in a clean trash bag and then take the trash bag full of baked goods to my car to save for later. At first I’d try and eat them all but eventually started trading them for weed or free smoke outs. It was fantastic. 

Then one day when I was carrying the baked goods to my car I noticed a homeless dude sleeping on a bench in the shopping plaza and decided to leave the bag of food next to him. When I left work a bit later he was already feasting. 

Unsurprisingly he returned around closing time the next night and I was able to hand him the food personally which felt nice. Not gonna lie, there were times I’d leave kinda hoping he wouldn’t be there so that I could take the food home or trade it, but I knew he probably needed it more. However, on one of these days he actually wasn’t there and sadly never returned. I’ve always wondered what happened to him. 


TLDR: Jamba Juice wastes a fuck ton of baked goods."
