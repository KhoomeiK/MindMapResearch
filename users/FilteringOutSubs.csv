That's probably also why people are saying fake, though it could happen if the cashier did get them and thought the customer would take them (maybe even asked before giving it as change). I've paid for a few things with a half dollar coin or two dollar bill now and then to clear them from a small pile I had, so those cashiers could've then given them as change.

And as other people have mentioned, every now and then someone will have no clue that the two dollar bill exists and think it must be something fake. It's not totally crazy though, because people aren't using the two."

Visually, I'm seeing a pink triceratops, but it could definitely be something else. I'm not turning anything up with that search, but I could definitely be searching in the wrong direction. 

Though if it *is* a pink triceratops, then I'm not sure the plushie is a Ty product. I'm moderately confident that the plushie would not be a Beanie Boo; I don't think there are any dinosaur Beanie Boos, yet with as many as there are I will not say I haven't missed any."
