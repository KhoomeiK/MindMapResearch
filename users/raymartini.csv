CatsAreAssholes,ff01d12,t1_fezyn39,1579464096.0,"Yeah but you donâ€™t understand, some will be best for the day, on top of lipstick or alone, for bed, for on the go (more compact), dif flavours obvs, stick vs pot ones,  itâ€™s perfectly sound logic"

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdl5tp6,t1_fdkvipi,1578517547.0,"Thank you for sharing - thatâ€™s definitely enlightening for me. I definitely think its a cultural thing to an extent as here in the UK I dont know any dogs who were crated (although they were locked in one room if the owner was out for a short amount of time). Totally get the benefits you mentioned though and can see how its helpful for abused animals. My cats are rescues and when i first got the second i had her in one room away from my other cat (as they were both moody princesses) and gradually introduced them. Luna, the new cat, was badly abused and recovering from giving birth and being neutered. She hid for ages behind a bed and gradually she gained her confidence. Eventually she would scratch at the door to be out so we started letting he roam free and introduced the cats with play. I cant imagine i could keep her in a single room now if i go out as it seems to make her more nervous. 
My auntie has a rescue greyhound and i think they gradually trained him to be sensible around the house when shes out. Hes a pretty well behaved dog though despite his past"
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdkpdv6,t1_fdkot9x,1578508379.0,"Yeah it doesnt sit right with me. I have cats and i cant imagine confining them to a small area while im at work, i just make sure theres no hazards lying around. Have they destroyed stuff before? Yeah, but its part of having a pet and iâ€™d rather they were free to roam than locked up"
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdkkplt,t3_elolaq,1578505597.0,"Never understood crating, maybe its just cos in the UK people dont usually crate but I imagine my pets would be bored in one room never-mind a crate"

Catswhoyell,fcajwsz,t1_fcafcz2,1577570627.0,"Yeah mine too! Its funny how subtle cats can be in their affection. Or theyâ€™re calling us both pathetic losers for crying, hard to say"
