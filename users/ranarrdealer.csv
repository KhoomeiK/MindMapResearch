BorderlinePDisorder,fcnylnv,t1_fcnw3pw,1577820954.0,"Yeah I've always been super self-aware, and it's just crazy how more self-aware you become every year, in a good way I mean actually. Living has been really rough, I've always been one to romanticize suicide, and also self-harm when I was younger, but I learned fast that wasn't for me, instead I found comfort in drugs, but I noticed the people I was doing them with were turning into junkies one at a time, and I noticed how different we really were, and distanced myself. I have to thank some survival instinct I guess, also I've been raised better. After losing all my friends to drugs and deceit I pretty much lost hope in people and isolated myself with weed, opiates and alcohol from 17-24, always one of those, sometimes all of them and more at the same time. Also lots of studies, jobs and other things that were fucked up royally during this period, debt and whatnot. Hanging out with my asshole friends every once in a while cause hey, doing drugs kind of is fun, but I always had my dose of my 'friends' psychopathy after a weekend, and remembered why I hate those people from the bottom of my heart. 
But I think over the years I've formed some kind of incredible will to live from all the pain and deceit that friends have caused. So I've kinda took it upon myself to be better than them and to stay alive to see them ruin their lives and die. If that makes sense. Also, I really don't WANT to die, I have to admit I love life, but I also hate it, and if I take my life before I'm 50 it was probably an accident.

But hey, I'll stay strong for you and everyone else in this thread too."
BorderlinePDisorder,fcnwkp2,t3_ei6z0b,1577819888.0,"If this is as one-sided as you've laid it out, I really think your girlfriend should take your feelings more into consideration, but also, if you haven't told her about all your traumas, how can she fully understand what your going through?
But yeah, I think a partner should be able to identify when someone really means something, like you really don't wanna go to a party and you really want to enjoy NYE with her company, she should be able to work around her plans and take your feelings into consideration, no matter if you have a 100-page essay detailing why, or not.

I'm sorry I'm so busy that I can't take more time to talk with you but I hope you both the best NY<3 Keep fighting and stay strong."
BorderlinePDisorder,fcntx7g,t1_fcnpz8f,1577818340.0,"Oh okay, it's just that I have big problems getting out of bed and doing normal human stuff, I mean, I eat, I sleep, I have a girlfriend but no job, my interests in music etc are dying and so on. I feel like I need some new motivation or energy to keep functioning normally, but I'm so hyperactive now and then I'm a bit scared of what a me in mania would look like. 

And now that you mention it, I mean I have debt and anxiety cause of that etc. also suspecting I have anti-social because I cannot see the good in some people at all, politicans, authority thinking they have a right to even lay a hand on me, I see that as confirmation of me being able to do citizens arrests on cops if truth be told etc etc. But yeah, my suspicions are not a legitimate diagnosis so I won't get into that, buuuut then again when I think about it maybe some of my problems stem from this more than BPD. I don't now yet, but I'm on the road to therapy and all that so all in good time I guess."
BorderlinePDisorder,fcnn65g,t1_fcnkzn2,1577814666.0,"Yupp that's the essence of it. Back when I was like 16 I ran around thinking I was bipolar, which was ridiculous looking back now I guess, and ofc my initial though when I started suspecting myself of having borderline was that I'm a fucking idiot for being so self-absorbed as to comparing my fuck-ups to someone else's real mental problems. Then I kinda had to look back on my criticism of myself and realize, yes, you are now 8 years older, yes, you can now unbiasedly suspect somethings wrong with you etc. 

I was beating myself up and belittling my own problems. Ofc, you should never start thinking about whats wrong with you too much, in my experience that just leads to paranoia and false diagnoses. Keep real to yourself always :) 

Also, I don't know your age but trust me when I say, it's best to be completely without drugs if that is possible. They can make you feel alive, and sometimes can be positive ""enhancers"", but often they aren't, and it becomes more of a form of escapism unfortunately... I'm still trying to kick weed out of my life for making me a lazy asshole too, and I occasionally take some opiates/oids, but I can tell you that the shame and disappointment is never worth it."

BorderlinePDisorder,fcnj38f,t1_fcniejo,1577812675.0,"Yeah, I'm not really expecting jobs to ever be so understanding, which is fine cause I'm lying to them about my mental state anyway I guess. So ""fuck them for not caring about me, I won't be honest with them either then""-type of thing :D Which is fine for me cause I know I'm just cattle for them, I'm not really understanding from the workplace. And hey thank you, that means a lot, the 2010's for me have been quite a time of dissapointment, denial, realiziation, growing up, and admitting my own faults before trying to make it someone elses fault. 

Time to try to apply all that shit in the 20's :P Gonna be tough but worth it."

Psychedelics scare me a bit, they make me too aware of my thoughts and Ive only had one good trip out of like 10. The 9 bad ones have been the most teaching experiences though.

And according to who and what system? The current one that is rewarding psychopath CEO's and politicians etc to use everyone else as their personal playthings? Then my question ofc is, is this current system even the right way? etc.

But the thing is, I've worked in the field before, and haven't found the work stressful, so my own judgment is that I can handle it, and I'm not the type of person to not speak up anymore, and I'm not afraid to ask etc, so I won't put myself and others at risk because of my own negligence if you know what I mean."
