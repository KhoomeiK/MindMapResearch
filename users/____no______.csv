This problem is due to industrial activity, and ALL industrial activity is ultimately driven by consumer demand.

It really can all be boiled down to this: **We buy too many things**.

Everything we buy requires mining/harvesting raw resources, processing/assembling them, and shipping them. Usually they are shipped multiple times, as sub-assemblies from one factory to another, as finished goods from the factory to the warehouse and then the warehouse to the point-of-sale... All of these steps use energy, and currently energy is primarily developed via the burning of fossil fuels.

Any solution to this problem that involves a reduction in fossil fuel emissions and does not involve transitioning away from their use will require MAJOR lifestyle changes for people who are wealthy relative to the global average (read: Just about every person in a developed ""1st world"" nation, just about every person on Reddit... if you make $30k USD per year you are in the top 1% wealthy people in the world)."

Fitness,fenvliq,t1_fenrw3e,1579291587.0,"Yes, it's called body recomposition. It's inefficient compared to bulk/cut cycling but it works.

Look at it this way, when you lift you damage your muscles and your body HAS to repair them... think of that repair like glue, you break a pencil, you glue it back together, suddenly the pencil is slightly bigger because of the added glue. This requires energy, so your ""TDEE"" just goes up a bit BECAUSE of the weight training (slightly). So really if you're perfectly maintaining your weight you are eating slightly more than what your TDEE would be if you weren't lifting, and that extra energy is going to repairing your muscle fibers.

At the same time you are losing fat because your body preferentially burns fat for energy over muscle (I believe it always burns some muscle even if you have plenty of fat... but more fat than muscle as long as you have some). So, your body needs energy to function (BMR), energy for activity, and energy to repair your muscle damage from lifting... whatever that amount of energy is you want to eat slightly less in calories. The deficit will be made up from fat AND muscle (different muscle cells than what was repaired), but mostly from fat if you have fat to lose. That's why this is inefficient. You simultaneously build muscle AND break it down to help with some of your caloric deficit.

Balancing this perfectly is impossible... I mean really it's practically impossible but you can keep yourself within like +/- a pound or two if you are diligent.

...and yes, when you cut/bulk cycle you lose muscle mass during your cut as well, but when you bulk you seem to gain it explosively.. at least that's my experience. Gains were agonizingly slow when I was ignorant of all of this stuff, but now when I bulk it seems much faster. If anyone knows any more about it please chime in."

Why can't any newly designed phone today use USB-C? There is absolutely no reason... and when a new standard is introduced by whatever society does that stuff then it will be adopted by the government and every new device after that point must use that standard.

Old devices are obviously grandfathered in... why assume the most obviously ridiculous interpretation of something?"

Right now you can turn your system off and back on again and have a ""blank slate"" so to speak. With nonvolatile RAM this will no longer be the case, you can't just wipe it out without wiping everything in your storage and starting over from scratch.

People who don't understand this: Imagine if your hard drive WAS your RAM... there was no distinction between them any longer. System instability due to accumulated software errors will be really friggin' hard to fix, let alone if done intentionally by malware."
