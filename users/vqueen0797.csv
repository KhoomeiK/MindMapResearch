I feel you when we rescued ed at first we were gonna find him a forever home little did we know we are his forever home and I dont think chuck norris would've let him leave they bonded immediately cause ed is a dwarf long hair cat but  is colored just like Norris here and norris just took to him.

cats,fdr14b3,t1_fdr068g,1578678035.0,"I know he looks so much better now this was only taken a week before christmas, when we found him he was maybe the size of my hand and wrist together and very dirty. He let me wash him and treat him get him to a vet and such and his coat and eyes are my fave  I adore him so much. He was like a present from the universe. So I named him after my granddaddy."
