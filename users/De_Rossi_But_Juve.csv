Just because a club hasn't won a competition in a long time doesn't mean they're not competing for it.   
That's why I compared teams who are competing for league titles but haven't won it in a long time.

It's a meaningless fact.

I would be interested **why** you think Juve won't win CL in the next 5 years, but based on the level of our ""conversation"" I don't think anything interesting or meaningful will come out of your mouth. 

I think I squeezed out every drop of amusement you had to offer, now you're just boring and your insults are unoriginal.   
I'll probably not respond anymore..."
soccer,fers1xm,t1_ferpdvo,1579357716.0,"Wow, you have no reading comprehension.

1) I said: ""you don't think for a second before you say something"". You said in a direct reply:""you don't think before you speak"".  
That's a ""no u"". You're unoriginal.

2) I said those things. I never claimed you said those things. Those were comparisons to show you how clueless you are. But apparently that was too hard for you to grasp?

You didn't actually give an argument why Juve won't win CL anytime soon. So I can't argue with you about that.  
You should learn how to construct an argument, you seem clueless.

Now read my comment again so you can understand more than just the first 2 words of every sentence. If you're a native English speaker you should feel ashamed of how bad your reading comprehension is."
soccer,ferl6ky,t1_fer9qn8,1579355338.0,"For an asshole your insults are a bit pathetic. Saying no u is what teenagers consider a comeback.

But that means that I won't enjoy insulting each other anymore. So I'll tell you normally why I think you're denser than a brick.

You tried to claim that Juve isn't challenging for CL. And your only argument was because we haven't won it in a long time.

So I gave examples of clubs who aren't contending for titles (napoli/roma for serie a). Liverpool for Premier league (they still haven't won it in a long time) and Leicester who has won the league recently, so according to your logic they should be a contender.

Your logic is shit and your argument was dumb.  
Now give me a real argument or just stop talking about things you have absolutely no knowledge of."

It's just that reddit works in hiveminds. If one comment is positive about vegans than all comments under it have to be positive too to be upvoted and even the most innocent logical contrarian word will get downvoted.

That's what I meant with searching for meaning behind his comment.

You're arguing technicalities right now, you're missing the point.

The point is that calling it a sacrifice is an insult to the animals.   
Most animals live in such dire situations we would call it torture if that happened to humans.

Now saying that's the same as humans goes a bit far, because we're more intelligent and thus ""better"".    

I don't care about technicalities, and your argument is kinda pathetic tbh. 

I already said that I don't think we should take the hyperbole literally. And you're arguing like I hold the same extreme perspective as the OP.

I don't even know what you're still trying to convince me off.    That the hyperbole isn't true? No shit sherlock.   
That technically it would be called a sacrifice? Yeah, fuck off.   
Or that eating meat isn't that bad and you shouldn't have to be made to feel bad? Tough shit, eating meat enables those horrific situations those animals find themselves in. So yes, you're participating in that.

That guy said that he shouldn't let the sacrifice go to waste. He is the one who brought that up.

Calling it a sacrifice is dumb. That's not what it is. It was a sacrifice in the prehistoric age, when mankind needed to survive. Not anymore.

I can agree it's a strong hyperbole. But it seems like you're searching for too much meaning behind it."

Why should meat eaters get a the same kind of respect as vegans or vegetarians? They aren't sacrificing anything and eaying meat is most of the time just the easy tasty choice.

Most meat eaters do so because it's easy, tasty and/or cheap. What other thought is behind it? 

If you actually go out of your way to eat vegan (which doesn't even have to be hard) and you abandon meat completely then you get much more respect from me and most people.

Putting them on the same level of respect doesn't make sense.
