During pride, though it’s intended to celebrate all LGBT identities, most people just talk about gay people, or mostly just use the rainbow flag. Though trans is probably the second most talked about identity during pride month, next to bi. 

The reason for the rainbow flag being the most used is cause it is often used as an umbrella flag for the LGBT community in general, or at least used to cover all sexualities/romantic orientations, and gay is used as an umbrella term for sexualities, just as q*eer is used by some as an umbrella term for everything. Likewise, the trans flag and the word trans is used to cover all gender identities outside of cis."

Also, when you dilute oils, I think you’re meant to dilute it with water, not another oil. 

These people seriously know nothing. Who let people who know nothing about oils start a company about them? It should be illegal to start a company about something and not do any research on how to safely use the product.
