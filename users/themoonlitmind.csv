bipolar,fel5p4l,t1_fekuytc,1579214613.0,I hear you. I am at the point where the depression is so brutal that I pray for a mania at times just so I can get something done.
bipolar,fekv4g0,t3_epnm4u,1579208229.0,"Do they worsen your depression, personally? Sometimes they help me (when I need to study and get some work done) and sometimes it convolutes my mood."

bipolar,fe49ao9,t1_fe02j7o,1578856960.0,"Many of the symptoms are very different: i.e.: BPD is a personality disorder and pervades the sense of self at the base of it. There are lots of black and white thoughts and a sort of emptiness. There is something called splitting, which is used within relationships with those closest to them - it manifests as a sort of Jekyll and Hyde phenomenon.

I've been very close to quite a few individuals with it, as well, one of my best friends took her life who had it, unfortunately.

Meds do not tend to work on individuals with BPD. Something called DBT (dialectical behavior therapy), is often used as the primary treatment."

bipolar,fdzv9ks,t1_fdy9xt3,1578796618.0,"Unfortunately also, people with BPD are wrongfully diagnosed with BP. I've read (and heard from multiple psychologists) that psychologists/psychiatrists don't want to put such a label on people and they will actually avoid diagnosing BPD."
bipolar,fdza9u9,t3_e9s8k8,1578788203.0,I love this.
bipolar,f0qsa6f,t3_d5w9jh,1568865409.0,All too true. Because it's the easiest thing in the world to jump on a bandwagon and post that you're there for support.
