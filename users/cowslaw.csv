blender,fcmzvad,t1_fcmzl9f,1577799067.0,"Itâ€™s impossible to win on reddit haha! Especially the one on the left, I think the roundness should be barely noticeable. Just so that you donâ€™t exactly see it as being round, but the light doesnâ€™t catch a sharp edge and create a perfectly straight line.

If you want to get more advanced, I guess micro-displacements on most of the surfaces and especially the edges would be the last necessary step to photo realism.

That being said, it looks absolutely incredible regardless. Wonderful work, really!!"
blender,fcmyufx,t1_fcmwsi7,1577798039.0,The only criticism I remember is how sharp the edges were on the last one. I think theyâ€™re a little too rounded now ðŸ˜…

There are a few instances where the artificial blur doesnâ€™t quite wrap around the right edges, but I was seriously impressed that it did so well here. In other pictures it had actually isolated some of his hairs as well"
