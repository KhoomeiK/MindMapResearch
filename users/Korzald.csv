college,fdiwci1,t1_fdhordq,1578452523.0,Yes you should disclose but the company's cover you if you have a run or passenger. Ride share insurance fills the gap between waiting for a pick up getting one.
college,fdiw1i4,t1_fdhsv0t,1578452322.0,I live just outside a big city. I start at 5 am drive till 10. Class till 2:30. Drive 5-7 then home bed and do that mon-thurs. Friday I start at 4 and drive till the rides die down or I am to tired. I do school work between classes and on sat and sunday. I don't drive at night if I need school work time. That gets me 700 a week if I drive all that. If I take time off for classes the money goes down. Some drivers in other markets make more in the same time.
college,fdhft2h,t1_fdha365,1578421734.0,I add on rideshare insurance for like 70 a month or so. Otherwise no change.

Bonus points if you stay near your folks. Your folks want you to be happy. They need to know you can make a living doing this. Then sit them down and explain this will make you happy and show them you can make a good living. Show them the degree plan and layout how you will tackle the degree. I am sure your folks will understand and if you put the time in they will respect that.
