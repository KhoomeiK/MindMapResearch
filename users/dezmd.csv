jacksonville,fesr5m2,t1_feovthb,1579368139.0,"We all already have zoning laws in place in Jacksonville, which do exactly what you are arguing against.   That's why there are public zoning meetings required that explicitly allow residents of the impacted areas to be heard. The community absolutely has a right to determine limits on building sizes and expansion. 

The specific neighborhood where these large developments are expect to go up will be considerably affected by vehicle traffic with the Publix alone (and they are all wanting Publix).

There used to be shops and homes/buildings all along Atlantic Blvd in the first place. Development of the area is needed, but the size of the development is what people are trying to cope with. 

We live in a democracy, if you don't like that people of a community can pass laws and support zoning limits on unexecpted or poorly planned (or even secretly planned) additions to development area projects, too fucking bad. You obviously want this to be a personal issue that you can address with political nonsense.

No, the ultimate question is, do out of state real estate investors have the right to  remake a neighborhood  and community in their own vision at the expense of the people are already part of that community?

You are simply wrong in your assessment on the San Marco development (it's the sudden addition of a very large condo/apartment complex on top of then Publix center that is at issue) and are you applying your politically motivated conclusions to a situation that is not what you imagine.

This isn't about housing prices, this is about who gets to define a neighborhood's development, the citizens of the community or an Alabama based real estate group that will be siphoning out the wealth generated from that neighborhood.  This isn't a local real estate investment group that will be directly generating local capital

But they certainly made sure to cripple the JEA's options by destroying generation capabilities instead of retrofitting existing infrastructure for newer or cleaner use. This looks like a slow roll strategy for the past decade, perhaps Curry was too greedy and tried to get the political (and likely financial) spoils from it in a way that didn't work for the people who originally expected the backroom bribes and deals for their moves.

It seems obvious the entire debacle was a Florida Power and Light, FPL, orchestrated scheme to take away our local control and open up pricing swings.  Why would a third party FPL controlled org be the front runner and require a meeting in Atlanta if it's a Florida focused power generation org? (Hint: It was definitely to avoid Sunshine Laws that require public disclosure and they should all spend a few nights in jail for it)

I suspect the need for Feds is because of the Atlanta meeting, and they probably thought they were being smart by choosing that route to avoid disclosures."
