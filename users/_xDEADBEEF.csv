Just using premium does not give you extra power. It allows you to run higher compression/boost/timing to make more power. If you want to make more power by changing fuels you have to use something oxygenated ."

Dude, ffmpeg -i somefile.mov -c:v mpeg2video -g 1 -b:v 10M -pix\_fmt yuv422p proxy.mov

You're welcome.

[Here's a script to experiment with various options.](https://pastebin.com/raw/AqrD2ikp) mpeg1, x264, x265 utvideo or ffv1 aren't useful.  However, x264 /5 intra is better than x264 long-gop. Dnxhd is too particular. Utvideo and ffv1 are just too high of a bitrate. I found mjpeg and mpeg2 the least taxing on a cpu.

The key option is to have a gop length of 1.

That's not what proxies are mainly intended for. It's the scrubbing where they come into play."

motorcycles,ff3ts3y,t3_erboph,1579548682.0,"Honestly, I don't know. Maybe because I was young when it happened.

Going down a hill turned a corner with a t-junction coming up. Tractor rolled up to the junction and crossed it, no indicators. I had nowhere to stop, it was wet and the tractor was pulling a trailer. I had to swing in front of the tractor, flew over the kerb and through a load of bushes. Didn't fall off but if there was a car waiting at the junction I would have been in a bad way.

Another time at night, on an a road, doing about 60 came around a corner and saw a black wall coming up on me fast. It took me probably too long to figure out wtf it was but it was a tractor pulling a tall trailer, with no sodding lights on! Thankfully there was a large cross hatch section in the middle for me to swerve into. I was fucking fuming and let the tractor driver know it.

Another time I was heading down a long straight. I could see a single extremely bright light coming the other way. It seemed to be moving very slowly so thought little of it. A parked motorbike perhaps. Just as I got near, I realised it was a tractor with one light in the middle of the grill and tyres crossing the central divider. Now that really shat me up.

I have come off once. I was heading up a pass into Austria. It had rained there earlier and I was hacked off with the person I was riding with. Mind totally not on the job and thinking I was on stelvio. Came into a wet switchback maybe only doing 30 and binned it.  Honestly thought nothing of it. I was only concerned about if I had holed the engine cases.

I still ride and race. I try to get the crashing and injuries done on the track ðŸ˜„"

He also complained that the EU wasn't interfering with Spain about catalunyan independence, or that they weren't blocking a Malta vote to hunt migratory birds. However, at the same time the problem with the EU is that they interfere with sovereign country matters. I told him his contradiction and that I'm confused on the point he was trying to make. ""Makes sense to me!"" was his response.

He also wanted to take a court case to the EU court of Human rights because it kept getting kicked out of British courts every time he appealed. Then he complains about Gina miller using the court system.

Apparently, another reason we don't need the EU is because we don't need to be in it to get a job there, because, back in the 50s/60s he had a job in Germany, except he's forgotten he's told me this story before countless times before over the decades and it was part of war reparations."

Dogtraining,fdq2eeu,t3_emk0rt,1578651507.0,"I have a dog with SA, although not as severe as yours. It's difficult to manage. 

What I will say is that it takes a lot of experimentation to find something that provides some sort of improvement.  

Here's a list of what I've tried:  
 * Crate training.  
 * Baby gates.  
 * Not making a scene leaving and entering the house.  
 * Dog calming videos on TV.  
 * Classical music.  
 * Talk radio.  
 * Kongs.  
 * Treat and train.  
 * Adaptil.  
 * Thundershirts.  
 * Yucalm.  
 * Zylkene.  
 * Vets best comfort calm tablets.  
 * Dog food specific for calming (turkey based).  
 * Distancing myself emotionally from my dog.  
 * Lavender oil on vet beds left out when I'm away.  
 * seeing a behaviourist.  
 * Staged conditioning exercises.   (gradually increasing the time away before any sign on anxiety over a very long period of time, e.g. months whilst including leaving queues e.g. jingling keys, putting on a jacket).  
 * Medication.  

Only the last two have helped somewhat and now my dog has become epileptic, she can no longer take Prozac meaning she's almost back to where she was a year ago.

From going into non-stop panic mode after 30seconds, after 8months of conditioning and medication she was okay up to 45minutes.

I can empathize with you if this seems like too much work.
