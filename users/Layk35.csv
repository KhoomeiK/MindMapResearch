coolguides,ffdf2h9,t1_ffdafu4,1579819528.0,Most restaurants I've gone to in the US just cook a burger. One time I went somewhere and they asked me how I wanted it cooked and it kind of baffled me. I always get my steaks medium rare so that's what I went for with the burger. That was a mistake.

AskReddit,ffaulei,t1_ffaqn9c,1579744846.0,"Yeah, I don't think all the posts saying family video is still going strong realize this. Going by Newsweek's numbers from mid 2018 to family viedeo's own numbers today, they've closed 150 stores in less than two years.


And anecdotally, the one in my town closed a few months ago"

gifs,feply6x,t1_feorm0t,1579323992.0,"This must be a common and natural thing for people to do according to the other comments. And to add my own example: in the commentary for Once Upon a Time in Mexico the director said that they had to keep telling Antonio Banderas to stop making gun shot noises with his mouth because they could see his mouth moving on camera, which I think is funny because he was in a bunch of movies before that where he used guns. I just imagine he did it every time until someone told him to stop"

StarWars,feiqa52,t1_feifu5c,1579144529.0,"They fucked up from the start in my opinion. Lots of people loved The Force Awakens, I however, did not. They went ""what did people love about the OT?"" and said, ""ok let's do almost exactly that down to every detail but bigger."" 


Then the rest of the series had no direction because it wasn't even based off of an original coherent idea to begin with, they started with copypasta and ended with shit."

I can imagine the answer being ""oh but it's such a joy and I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.""

Like, well there ya go, the ""joy"" is your reward, not going to the front of the line. Now let's both wait in line like equals, because you sure as shit didn't do anyone else in the world any favors by having kids."
science,fdsug3y,t1_fdstoaj,1578708085.0,I had similar thoughts. I was happy to see this was popular and I just now realized I haven't really seen any anti-GMO sentiment in awhile. Maybe people are finally realizing that GMOs aren't inherently harmful.
wholesomememes,fds8y5w,t1_fdrw154,1578697059.0,"I like this quote. It reminds me of something I heard awhile ago about people who say ""Real men do this"" or ""Real men do that."" The response I heard was ""Real men do whatever they want."" This one's more elegant though and applies to everyone"

Also doesn't mesh with how Luke was in the OT. He never wanted to murder his own flesh and blood then, even when his father had help slaughter literally billions of people. And he was *already* fully on the dark side. This new trilogy doesn't make any sense to me"
