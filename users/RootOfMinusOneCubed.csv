The play is seen through the lens of emotion. I mean, the plot is there, and dialogue, but it's very much the emotional track of the story playing out on stage. I'm sure that reading it after seeing the play would have so much else to it that it would be a new experience.

  


Fun fact: They had two actors playing Frankenstein and the creature, Benedict Cumberbatch and Johnny Lee Miller. They alternated roles on successive nights in the live run. So when you see it at the cinema you can see it twice - once with Cumberbatch as the creator, once as the creature.

I not saying he is cheating, but that's the hurt that you've raised. (That and his dismissive response to your hurt.) Don't read this as confirmation. But if you're asking *how could someone cheat?*  there are lots of books on the subject, endless web pages, some good TED Talks, and probably multiple Reddit subs. I don't know a lot about it, so any of those sources are probably better than me, but we're here now and you've asked, so here's my opinion: they think it's a victimless crime.    

Edit: when I say *someone who's cheating* I'm only talking about people who have entered into a relationship where they know the other person is expecting monogamy. 


  


There's more than one aspect to love, like intimacy, passion, commitment, etc. A lot of people (including you, I'm guessing) think that you should look for all of these in one person, be all of these to that person, and steer away early from any pull towards someone else. Someone who's cheating doesn't steer away. They grant themselves licence to indulge themselves, and they think *as long as I keep these things separate it's OK. What my partner doesn't know won't hurt them.* 

  


When you ask questions, you threaten that separation, and they'll try to protect it. That separation is now their primary loyalty.

  


I'm really getting way out over my skis here, and hopefully other Redditors will join in with better insights. But I think *how* they protect that separation might be a big tell for whether they're a narcissist. Clumsy, illogical, avoiding: maybe not a narcissist.

That's one cause. There are others, and you'd need to figure your cause/remedy. I read a self-published book by a guy with sever knee pain. He gave up seeing physios and doctors, started reading primary research papers, and ran his own rigorous experiments. In his case, his cartilage was worn down. It turns out cartilage *can* regrow, but it has no blood supply to bring it nutrients so growth is very slow. So how do the nutrients reach it? By compression and decompression of the fluid in the joint, like when we walk. Eventually he figured out the right amount and intensity of compression/decompression to rescue his knees.

Old-world thinking is 2 sexes, 2 genders. Ask them to define the boundaries though and - *well, they're just obvious, right?* (/s)

  


The reality is that there are clusters of traits, and there is no litmus test trait. A woman has breasts and a uterus, right? Except that some women don't have developed breasts and some have hysterectomies. Even the XX/XY traits aren't litmus tests because not everyone is born with a neat XX or XY arrangement.

  


The same goes for gender roles and gender expression. Clusters of traits with no litmus test.

  


A couple of clusters stand out statistically, and old-school thinking with its love of normalisation thinks everyone should be in one of them, and which one you should be in *is just obvious*. The reality is that it's possible to be born into one cluster but identify strongly *with* or *as* another. (Or with no cluster. Or with more than one.)

  


To put that another way, there isn't some specific characteristic of the cluster which is defining, but the gravity which pulls all those traits together into a cluster forms it into an identity. And the *identity* is that innate, internal thing you're talking about.

  


This thread seemed to kick off with the idea that if society no longer polices some visual cues which are associated with gender clusters, the ~~*clusters*~~ identities disappear and identifying with a cluster is somehow stunting that progress. And I think you're saying that while the traits which express the identity change over time, the identities are very real. (As is the identification with one which you weren't assigned at birth.)

  


Sorry for the essay. What I want to do is express that whole thing visually, rather than using the word ""cluster"" a million times. Some sort of animation which may / may not be interactive. Just wondering what you think of the idea, if it could be helpful as something to point people to, and whether my understanding of things is on track.

I have a few questions. First one is nothing to do with languages - did you let the data draw itself, eg using a force-directed algorithm? But they usually try to normalise the distances between nodes, which would be inappropriate here. So what algorithm? And did you use a graph-based database or just do it all as a bunch of data structures in code?

  


Second one is about the data itself. It's a very neat 2D projection, but I would think you could only achieve that by pruning the connections between languages. Otherwise some connections would pull the graph into a curve. So how did the pruning decisions get made?

Last question is actually about the distance between languages. I looked two layers of links in to see how distance is determined. It all seemed to be about word form. But grammar changes as well. I guess this is really a ponder-out-loud question... what would a grammatical equivalent, or overlay, look like?

Diplomats and heads of state across Europe were all played by Hitler. Their entire mode of negotiation was built on the idea that everyone was playing by the same set of rules. Not that everyone was honest - secret agendas have always existed - but they believed to their core that the negotiation process itself was a real thing. Hitler didn't. Hitler played his *own* diplomats.

  


They also had the shared recent trauma of WWI and thought that everyone was on the same page - that no-one wanted a return to war. Hitler did, and he used the negotiation process to buy time while his other tactics established advantages.

  


Those other tactics included unofficial commando/terrorist groups running false flag operations which made it appear that the large populations of German nationals in other countries such as Czechoslovakia were under threat and needed defending."

***condone***

*verb: accept* (behaviour that is considered morally wrong or offensive). 

  


The Bible sets forth a bunch of rules for how slaves can be bought and how long they should serve. It specifies a ceremony for pinning them to the door by piercing their ear with an awl. It gives laws allowing vengeance if a slave-owner beats his slave to death but not allowing such vengeance if the slave recovers from the physical beating ""because the slave is his money"". It has different rules for the enslaving of Hebrews and non-Hebrews. It dictates that if the Hebrews are at war with a town and the people of that town surrender, the men of the town are to be taken for forced labour. It also says that if the Hebrew soldier finds an attractive woman in a vanquished town he can take her and she'll have wifely duties.

  


This is all accepting the behaviour, to say the least."

LearnUselessTalents,fbxfeyn,t1_fbwog4g,1577184588.0,"It would work fine with zeroes and decimals. Every cluster of lines represents the count present in an order of 10, just like digits do. For zeroes you would still need the cluster to exist, but you could just use a dashed line and ignore any dots formed.

  


It's not any weaker mathematically, it just represents it visually, and uses a laborious notation of 9 strokes to represent a count of nine, instead of the digit '9'.

  


The big difference is that we mentally cache the results of a lot of small operations (learning our times tables is all about populating that cache). Counting those dots is the no-cache version."
