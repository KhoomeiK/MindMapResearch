It would explain everything from uncle George looking like he crawled out of a grave, to Jericho coming back, to the cult gathering around her and then vanishing. It explains the splinters, and how Sean no longer feels pain.

servant,feeqfmh,t3_eomz1d,1579039027.0,I think it shows that they passed up the more qualified candidates for someone like Leanne. The question we need to be asking ourselves is why.
servant,feeq0sv,t3_eonvi6,1579038788.0,"I really enjoyed your perspective. My only two comments are 1) I don‚Äôt think the size of the baby is relevant. Films/tv are notorious for getting baby sizes/ages wrong and there is a large variation in the sizes of babies of the same age, and 2)I don‚Äôt think we need to assume Sean was gone more than a week. I did note the missing leaves in the scene where Dorothy hears the baby cry, I suspect this is a reflection of Dorothy‚Äôs state of mind and not reality. I think we are seeing reality through several perspectives, Dorothy may remember it as being dark and bleak even if it wasn‚Äôt."
servant,fe89li0,t3_enrtsl,1578923996.0,"The whole comment about the magazines was in reference to the fact that even though Leanne thought of herself as being ‚Äúeducated‚Äú she really didn‚Äôt know anything. I paused and zoomed in on the scene where Dorothy is reading Leanne‚Äôs letter and it basically just reads like a small country town girl wanting to go out and see the world. Which is interesting because we see that there are other clearly more qualified applicants but for whatever reason Dorothy chooses Leanne. I think Leanne was desperate to get out of her house and the Turners were the first opportunity for her to do so. So I don‚Äôt think it so much that she chose them but that they chose her. I think she would‚Äôve gone with anybody who was willing to take her.

Leanne is young and it‚Äôs normal for young people to look up to older adults to emulate and to present an example of who they want to be. I think she looks up to the Turners as an example of what perfection is only to be disappointed when she realizes that they‚Äôre just normal human beings like everybody else with flaws. I think this is actually a pretty common thing that most young people go through when they come to realize that their parents really are just normal people and that they make mistakes. There is a disappointment that comes along with that, and I think we are seeing that through Leanne who wanted to go out and see the that the world is this great place that she had been denied, only to find out people are just people, warts and all."

servant,fdweyx5,t3_en812x,1578758033.0,"I think it‚Äôs a bit unfair because Dorothy has been presented as being unlikeable all along.

2)We see several qualified candidates for the nanny position. Then we see Leannes letter, which I zoomed in to read. She basically has no real qualifications, it‚Äôs a letter about how she wants to see the world, believes in Fate, and has a strong faith in God.

servant,fdrvuu6,t1_fdrc2us,1578690510.0,"I think what Leanne is going through is actually pretty typical of what teenagers go through when they grow up. I think we all have a pretty idealized version of the adults around us when we are young, and then we grow up and realize that adults are pretty much just humans and aren‚Äôt infallible and make mistakes. It‚Äôs hard sometimes to make peace with the disappointment of realizing that people are just human and no one is really above it all. I think Leanne is angry I don‚Äôt think she understands what happened to the baby, she‚Äôs looking at it from a child‚Äôs viewpoint, holding the adult to the highest standard. I think she‚Äôs punishing her in little ways to make her ‚Äúpay‚Äù for what happened to Jericho."

servant,fdqu30z,t3_emr33j,1578674895.0,It could be Dorothy‚Äôs perception/paranoia.
servant,fdqtxw8,t3_emr6zz,1578674807.0,I think the implication is that Dorothy straight up had a psychotic break. By the time she realized what she‚Äôd done she was in such deep denial she couldn‚Äôt face it. That‚Äôs why it took so long to retrieve the baby.
servant,fdqtnpx,t3_emlj7v,1578674637.0,"I had a thought about Sean feeding Leanne the pufferfish. He says they must be extremely careful and if you make even one tiny mistake cutting it, you could kill/poison someone. Then he feeds her the fish. I think the implication is trust, and making mistakes. People can make mistakes and people can die. Leanne trusts Sean enough to eat his fish. Sean trusted Dorothy to care for Jericho and she made a mistake, and it cost Jericho his life. Maybe there is an implied message of trusting others and how fragile life can be."
servant,fdqcmx2,t3_emlj7v,1578663069.0,"I enjoyed this episode but it leads to all kinds of new questions. I‚Äôve always thought it was strange that there are no videos of Dorothy from 2011 to 2017 and it makes me wonder if Jericho‚Äôs death happened a long time ago. It might explain why Sean now works from home, And why it‚Äôs questionable whether or not Dorothy actually has a job or we are just watching old DVDs of her job. I have always suspected the new baby is Leanne‚Äôs baby. Maybe she was brought on board as a way to help Dorothy cope and break her out of her psychotic state.

I thought the baby‚Äôs death was tastefully done. I watched the movie Trainspotting years ago and I was very traumatized by that death scene with the baby in the crib. 20 years later I can still see it in my head and it still upsets me."

I think the issue with vaccines is that there are too many, and I can‚Äôt blame parents for questioning them. I‚Äôd like to see children being required to have vaccines for communicable diseases like whooping cough or chicken pox, but to insist children have every single vaccine, including ones for diseases you can‚Äôt contract easily like Hep B and A, seems excessive to me.

I think sterilizing anyone under the age of 30 who has no kids is iffy unless there is a medical reason, or they have failed birth control methods. It may not seem like it, but you are going to grow and change all throughout your lifetime. The things I wanted at 20 are not the things I wanted at 30, the things I want at 45 are not the things I wanted at 35. If you don‚Äôt have kids, to say at 21 you never want them ever is foolish. You don‚Äôt know what you want because your brain isn‚Äôt even fully developed yet. Just like teenagers think they know it all, so do very young adults. Tubal and vasectomy reversals are extremely common. People absolutely change their minds. This goes for both men and women.

We have so many safe and reliable birth control methods, there is no reason to sterilize a childless person under the age of 30. Now if you‚Äôre 25, have a kid or two, want to be sterilized? Go for it. But unless you know what parenting is, it‚Äôs hard to know what you‚Äôre giving up. You might very well change your mind."

My working theory so far is that Dorothy killed her own baby due to postpartum depression. The dad and uncle were there when it happened and have guilt about the situation. I think Leanne ran away from a cult and I think Jericho is her baby. I think Dorothy knows more than she lets on and may have even arranged for an adoption of sorts.

Something about Dorothy is off and I can‚Äôt help feeling like these daily news reports are recorded and being replayed. Just a hunch I have.

I do think the Dad losing his taste is weird, but it might be trauma from witnessing what happened to Jericho.

I think they‚Äôre into ‚Äúhealthy eating‚Äù which is why there was applesauce and fruit. I saw candy and trinkets too. If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre used to, it‚Äôs fine for them. I once knew a girl who never got a cake for her birthday and I thought it was abhorrent. It‚Äôs all she‚Äôd ever known, so it never bothered her because it was what she was used to.

I did spy some gifts under the tree, I hope the kids had more stuff there.

I was bothered by how TRC was focusing mostly on his wife and child in the videos, like the other kids were just wallpaper in the background. That is going to drive a wedge between those kids, and Alice May play it up as daddy‚Äôs favorite. Emily looks checked out and out of it. The good news is if TRC is feeling resentful of the older kids, odds are it‚Äôs becayse they are giving him a hard time. The older 2 are on the cusp of puberty and will have each other‚Äôs backs against TRC. I can‚Äôt wait till they‚Äôre all teenagers, they‚Äôre going to give him hell, and I‚Äôm here for it."
