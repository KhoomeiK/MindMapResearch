todayilearned,ff5ateh,t1_ff57dit,1579585542.0,"It's not just ""giving them a subway voucher"". We're talking about billions of dollars of infrastructure and farming which then needs to be maintained and managed. The problem is, a lot of countries that have received aid DO get told all this, but then through corruption, lack of understanding or whatever reason just squander it all and it turns to ruin. Then the hand is held out again for more aid.

If poverty and hunger are a big problem in some nations, why are their population exploding by the millions?"

It's irritating sometimes when you get games using the popularity of the name just to get you in, then the game is totally different. Innovation is good in games though, so it should apply to the name also right :)"

vaxxhappened,fc5q2ka,t1_fc5dwvd,1577463516.0,"You miss my point, i am talking about the right for people to choose their medical treatment. If someone does not want to receive multiple ingections which may cause side effects or reactions then they have the right to deny such treatment.

It is fact that vaccines go through recalls and are can be mishandled by the company producing them and the persons administering them. There is also no viable reason for young children not to be able to forgo immunisation at a later age, or split the vaccines into multiple doses. In fact the very suggestion of this to a doctor and you are smeared as an antivaxxer, ridiculed by the media and slandered. Please tell me why a newborn healthy child in a safe family requires hepatitis vaccines so early in their development. Or that a concoction containing vitimin k needs to be administered at birth.

Edit: Since I am now banned for daring to question things (thats how any dissenting opinion or evidence is shut down) I'll have to answer here.

Since you cant read I am not switching my point, my second and third line of my post states 
""Choosing your medical care and what someone can inject into you is your right, nobody can infringe on that.

It seems some people out there think it's ok that the state should mandatory inject you with drugs without your say in the matter.""

https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-ethiopians-fooled-into-birth-control-1.5226424

""“They told us they are inoculations,” said one of the women interviewed. ""

as you can see there is a precedent for mandatory injections here is another example of nefarious intent."

Edit: since I am now banned for my opinion, I wasn't talking about the side effects of antibiotics, I'm talking about the side effect from vaccines, of which in some anaphylaxis is a LISTED SIDE EFFECT.

Quarantine? For a healthy individual with no disease to be rounded up by the state and forced into quarantine? I don't want to be a part of that country that allows that."
vaxxhappened,fc5bx1u,t3_eg8h5f,1577452660.0,"Anaphylaxis is a serious life threatening side effect, mislabeled vaccines and recalls are also possible and have been documented in many cases. 

Choosing your medical care and what someone can inject into you is your right, nobody can infringe on that.

It seems some people out there think it's ok that the state should mandatory inject you with drugs without your say in the matter.

In Africa a vaccine used in Kenya in March and October 2014 was laced with the Beta-HCG hormone, which causes infertility and sterilization in women.  Also, many HIV positive women in Africa are forcibly sterilized through injection without their consent.

Also look up vaccine litigation laws and cases, the fact that the cause of death can not be allowed to be listed as a death directly caused by vaccine, that should scare you. In fact, these companies are all but immune to lawsuits based on side effects of their vaccines.

""Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said Congress set up a special vaccine court in 1986 to handle such claims as a way to provide compensation to injured children without driving drug manufacturers from the vaccine market. The idea, he said, was to create a system that spares the drug companies the costs of defending against parents' lawsuits.""

""Such was the case for Robalee and Russell Bruesewitz of Pittsburgh, who filed their lawsuit after the vaccine court rejected their claims for compensation. According to the lawsuit, their daughter, Hannah, was a healthy infant until she received the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine in April 1992. The vaccine was made by Wyeth, now owned by Pfizer, Inc.

Within hours of getting the DPT shot, the third in a series of five, the baby suffered a series of debilitating seizures. Hannah continues to suffer from residual seizure disorder, the lawsuit said.

A federal trial judge and the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Wyeth. Indeed, state and federal appeals courts have almost always sided with the vaccine manufacturer in preventing the lawsuits from going forward"""
