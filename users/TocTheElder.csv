gaming,fdqmhpn,t1_fdqfndf,1578670174.0,"Honestly, give 5 a go. The gameplay is the best Halo has ever been in my opinion, and tje story is good. It's easily the weakest story of the series, granted, but still a cut above most games out there. It gets a lot of flack and I totally understand why. The marketing campaign was an actual lie and completely misrepresentative of the game. I think if the marketing campaign was actually honest about what the game was, it would have been received far better. I'm definitely not an expert as there's a ton of books I still haven't read, but I am a big fan of the lore. I always found the fact that he can't achieve a rank above Petty Officer to be a cool dynamic, as it places a boundary on what Chief can achieve. He is merely a weapon to be pointed, and him being a flat character is kind of the point. He is going to be outdated. He is getting older, and the Spartan-IVs are easier and cheaper to produce, and don't require kidnapping children and breaking them at a fundamental level to be moulded into instruments for slaughter. They don't require the same level of augmentation that Chief needed, and they also can achieve a commissioned rank. For example, Sarah Palmer, a Spartan-IV introduced in H4, holds the rank of Commander, and I believe that means that she technically outranks Chief, a ma  with decades of decorated service under his belt. He comes off as a flat, emotionless nothing person because that is the way the UNSC needed him. They needed a man willing to murder insurgents without question, and that's what they got. The fact that Chief still holds a moral conscience is surprising, and his muted, flat nature allows the player to both project their own interpretations onto the character, and to grasp some emotional semblance from high concept situations. Chief is nothing more than a weapon to be pointed, so when he makes his own choices, when he follows his own path, those are poweful moments for a man who has never had a choice before. I can totally get someone seeing Chief as lacking depth, but I think that misses the point of his character on a thematic level. Now, obviously you can't make the argument that if a character is flat on purpose that by definition makes it a good character, but I think Chief has enough nuance to justify that flatness."

>He's so good at it though you'd think he'd get a promotion,

Because he literally can't. Master Chief is a non-commissioned officer of the Navy, and thus cannot be promoted any further than Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy (MCPoN). If I recall correctly, this is due to the Spartan IIs being basically child science experiments, and didn't receive the same induction and training that commissioned officers do. There have been some commissioned Spartans, but they largely don't see combat anymore, as a commissioned officer has vastly different duties to that of a straight up soldier, which is what Chief is. Chief has hit the ceiling of what he can achieve within the UNSC. That's kind of the point of his character now. He's a stagnating weapon who has come to realise that he has agency and his own thoughts and desires that he has to wrestle with. This is why Halo 4 and 5 were good (yeah I know, it's illegal to like 5), because they started to deal with the fact that this ageing war machine has its own wants and needs and hopes and fears. They used those games to explore the consequences of what happens when you take a man who has only ever had one true link to the world (just going by the games for simplicity's sake) and sever that link, leaving him aimless and wanting. They definitely could have addressed such a complex moral question a bit better, but hey, it was cool to see them try.

Okay. Easy. According to the new show, Jon can't escape at the end because ""watch batteries."" Watch batteries made of lithium. However, in [this panel from the graphic novel](https://i.redd.it/aay1pmhdkou31.jpg) Jon openly boasts to Hollis Mason that he can easily synthesize lithium at will. In fact, this is so goddamn easy for him that it led to a technological revolution that fundamentally changed the world economy and its reliance on fossil fuels. It's why everyone drove electric cars in the original, and it's why there were so many airships. So it's very, very, very painfully clear that Jon has absolute mastery over lithium. So why would it suddenly be his weakness, when he helped create most of it? Because watches, I guess?

Also, Jon has faced tachyons before and only been a little bit confused. Since when can they ""forcibly teleport him away""? Oh, one episode from the end? That's a great opportunity to introduce such a fundamental change to the status quo. It's almost as if they really needed to find away to rob a god character of all agency... Similarly, Jon has had the strong nuclear force of his atoms negated, tearing him apart at an atomic level. ""I have walked across the surface of the sun. I have witnessed events so tiny and so fast, they could hardly be said to have occurred at all. But you, Adrian, you are just a man, and the world's smartest man means no more to me than does its smartest termite."" One of the most powerful lines in the entire book, and it takes place immediately after Adrian foolishly attempted to destroy Jon. 

>explain what about the character were changed or made cheap rather than just saying that it happened and that you didn't agree with it. 

Okay. Easy. Jon is only in this show to be used as a prop for the reveal at the end of episode seven. ""Oh no, he was here the whole time!"" Wow, powerful stuff. But why exactly was he necessary to this plot? Like, why does he suddenly return to Earth after 25 years and walk straight into Angela? ""Because that's how it is supposed to happen"" is just bad writing, and yet literally no other reason is ever presented. The writers clearly couldn't handle how to write Jon's character, and so they robbed him of all agency so that they wouldn't have to deal with the more pressing questions his existence begs. This is confounded by the fact that one of the pivotal moments of the original graphic novel was Jon realising that, despite the universe being a rigid four dimensional object, free will and agency still matter, and his decisions are still important. In fact, it's his decision at the end of the original that keeps everyone quiet, and it's his decision to leave rhe *galaxy* (back to that in a second). Jon's entire character arc is a commentary on predeterminism and his own free will. In Watchmaker, he questions whose fault it truly is for his life being the way it is: is it his fault? Is it the fault fat man who stepped on Janey's watch? Or perhaps the fault of his father for choosing his career? To abandon all of that storytelling, and boil it down to ""sorry I can see when I die, no changies!"" boasts a wild and woeful mishandling of the character of Jon Osterman.

Finally, at the end of the original, Jon judt straight up says he is leaving the galaxy. So why would he go to Europa? Why would he set up a fake version of himself on Mars? It's literally only there to fuck with the audience. They could have explained away his return with something about cosmic expansion and how Jon's teleportation can't outpace basic causality and relativity, making his journey a futile one, but that would require some understanding on the writing staff's part of Jon's character. These aren't minor things that they missed. These are major story beats that are just straight up ignored in order to facilitate a cheap twist that ultimately says absolutely nothing of value about predeterminism or free will or even broader scopes like the human experience.

Now, I don't think of this was unsalvagable. Three more episodes (twelve, like the original), ans they could have fleshed out the Jon plot, and made Trieu's plan a little more creative and challenging then ""I be Manhattan, no I be Manhattan!"", which is just lazy and childish and Watchmen is better than that. The Europa Jon sequences were brilliant, and Karnak was great too. The guy playing Jon was great, but Jon himself looked cheap and shitty and honestly they just shouldn't have bothered. What a mess."

television,fde16ho,t1_fddv1jn,1578328850.0,"Watchmen failed to understand its source material, and on top of that, said nothing of significance, unlike the dizzyning moral quandries and maddening philosophical implications of the original. It was a great show up to the end of episode seven, then it took a nosedive into bizarre Jon Osterman fan fiction. His inclusion added absolutely nothing to the show besides a cheap, flaccid twist, and twists can't substitute for substance. Characters from the original boiled down to cheap plot devices, and it was clear they were just writing this show to fuck with Reddit, rather than creating something genuinely inventive and worthy of discussion.

Also, it's strange how much attention they paid to the graphic novel, considering the whole plot of the last two episodes hinges on Lindelof completely ignoring information that the original graphic novel already told us. It's a shame, becsuse it began very well.

EDIT: Or just downvote me for my opinion. Brilliant counterpoint."

Like, if you showed me that trailer, and it ended with ""Inception 2, coming 2020"", I wouldn't have been surprised. It does look interesting, and I saw the IMAX trailer the other day before TRoS, and it was a very intriguing preview."

marvelstudios,fd6dz6d,t1_fd6ctkb,1578189523.0,">You can't make up a real scene on the spot based on a scenario like it's a game. Especially when you're working with very limited and specific schedules and sets that cost a lot of money. Actors rehearse for days before they go on set to quickly film their scenes due to all of the cast and crew's different and tight schedules. 

This is even more true when you think about things like basic scene-to-scene continuity. Unless you are shooting scenes in the order that they appear in the film (which is basically never done), it would be impossible to keep track of anything more than surface level details in the dialogue without having a solid, well established script."
