DecidingToBeBetter,ff2bxjl,t3_er02ro,1579500108.0,"An excellent point. Just for some perspective, I counted how many different hobbies I've thrown myself into in the last 7 years. Its 13 at least. I might have missed a couple. 

Just one passion is good, many passions are good. Comparing isn't fair to you or the other person."

tumblr,feu6fh6,t1_fetk95a,1579383560.0,People still name there children Jesus and Mohammed. I met an Allah in college. I don't think it's strange to name your pets after gods that are still worshipped.

LifeProTips,feeraux,t1_feepfwv,1579039535.0,Fructose is considered a simple sugar. I was referring more to the carbohydrates in fruit. Carbs are turned into glucose (another simple sugar) and is the body's first source of energy.
LifeProTips,feeqc5h,t1_feeh9fp,1579038970.0,"This tip is what I was told by my dietician a couple of years ago. Perhaps there is new information or I misunderstood. Thank you for your contribution! I just want people to succeed in their fitness goals and battling hunger is a huge part of that.   


For those of you reading, Fitness is an individual journey and some things work better than others. If you try my tip and it just doesn't work for you, try what u/thebadgerfish says and keep trying until something sticks."
selfimprovement,feead6o,t1_fedhbgq,1579029678.0,"Get a cat or dog \*only if you can afford to take care of them for almost 20 years\*. 

&#x200B;

\*\*If you can't afford the vet, you can't afford the pet\*\*. I have a separate savings account for my cat. She's richer than me, which sounds ridiculous until I remember that I made a commitment to keep her healthy and happy for the next two decades and I intend to do exactly that. When most people have to consider euthanasia, I can afford emergency surgery for her if she needs it. She will never go hungry, will always have a place to sleep, and will always be up to date on her vaccines and check-ups. Don't just get a pet because of a life crisis or need to nurture something. It is less expensive than a child, but requires just as much thought and planning as one. If you arent 110% prepared for the burden (and yes, pets are a burden) DO NOT GET ANY ANIMAL."
selfimprovement,fee9h9p,t1_fee02mr,1579029160.0,"Great advice. On a side note, I often forget that I have ""Millennials to snake people"" installed on my browser so I was really taken aback when I read ""If you are like most snake people you're not even close."" You gave me a chuckle today, thank you!"

Damnthatsinteresting,fe0dvgp,t1_fe0b9s9,1578811257.0,You can go to your bank and ask if they could get you some. But they'll probably want payment for the trouble. I dont know what you would do with the sheer amount of money even $1 would get you.
DecidingToBeBetter,fdzpdog,t1_fdz8zbb,1578792823.0,"I was a dental student for a while. I decided not to persue it. But one thing I did gain an appreciation for is how gently my colleages and teachers would handle cases like yours. I dont think you are going to get a lecture. Just explain your situation and your hesitation and I think you will find some solidarity on the professionals who you have trusted to take care of you.

You can also ask to keep the lead apron on after x-rays and during the whole procedure. Its a common request and the weight calms a lot of people down. I'm less afraid after studying, but I still get nervous at the dentist. Old feelings I guess. I bring a blanket from home and my headphones with my favorite music. Ive met adults who brought stuffed animals and others who wore those eye masks because they didnt like looking at us. No request is too weird. They want you to be comfortable and feel safe."

DecidingToBeBetter,fdmi8ss,t3_elshp2,1578550847.0,"I completely understand what you mean. 5 years ago, I never imagined life could be anything but suffering. I felt nothing except overwhelming, sinking dread every time I considered living. But in the past year alone I have done so many scary things like travelling alone, picking up hobbies and sports not usually started in adulthood, going back to college, performing, moving away from everything I knew... Every time I did some new scary thing I would think ""I've done scarier things"". And I have, I picked myself out of a depression so deep I thought there would be no hope of escape and I did that *by myself*. Nothing has been as scary as that. Nothing ever will be."
selfimprovement,fdivmut,t1_fdikopz,1578452057.0,"Look man, I majored in communications. I know how to make people listen to and like you. Its like getting a degree in charisma. This advice IS GOOD. 

If you don't take interest in your friends interests, they feel isolated from you. For example, A friend of mine loves BTS, the k-pop band. I dont give a shit about them but I still learned all their names and listen to their music around my friend because I love my friend and I want to show him that his interests are valid and important.

Letting people talk about themselves is a really good way to make connections. People love to talk about themselves. Take my opening paragraph for example. I like to talk about myself and I like when people let me. Ive found the same to be true in almost every professional and casual encounter I've had.

Telling yourself positive things is a good way to boost self esteem and *change harmful patterns* of thinking. Its literally a thing that therapists will teach you. Its backed by research. Go tell yourself you're special today because your snide attitude gives me the impression its not something you often say to yourself.

Saying ""find an active hobby"" is literally the same as telling someone to go workout. OP never said their workout couldnt be playing basketball or hockey or hiking. So maybe get off your high horse.


You should read this post again (all the way through). Most of it is solid advice. Good life advice doesnt have to be complicated or unique. Theres a reason you hear the same good advice over and over again."

NewSkaters,fcwtctl,t1_fcvu1st,1578036800.0,"In general you should work muscles in both legs equally. But since you have a specific goal for this training, which is to strengthen your standing leg, focusing mostly on that is going to get you there faster. Is it good for you, though? Probably not.

Do it on both sides, but pay special attention to how it feels when you are on your standing leg so you can mimic that when you are skateboarding."

NewSkaters,fctikq1,t3_eisocv,1577944504.0,Do some one legged squats. They helped me build my quads and get used to the feel of my body weight on one side. They also helped with my balance.
LearnUselessTalents,fcti35y,t3_eimygn,1577944017.0,"Play around with it. Try hopping off the board without it moving (to practice bailing). Try going slowly and see which leg you like to kick with and which you like to keep on the board (I skate with my right on the board but most people prefer their left). Try doing turns and stops then try them going faster.

Don't forget: Helmets are the coolest looking skating accessory. The coolest of the cool wear helmets. Tony Hawk wears a helmet. It's cool.

In all seriousness, I didn't really start improving until I wasn't afraid to fall and that meant wearing full pads and a helmet. I still wear knee pads and my helmet when I go out because its truly more fun when you know you won't get hurt."
