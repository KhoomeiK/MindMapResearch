AmItheAsshole,ffdrvr4,t1_ffdr27n,1579827399.0,Yeah I fear the day the house is actually paid off. Which is suppose to be in about 15 yrs. He said the day it's paid off he is quitting his job. At that point I have no idea what is going to happen. Even if I get my old job back and go full time there is no way I could make the utilities and food every month on top of whatever hes going to want to buy.
AmItheAsshole,ffdrovs,t1_ffdq245,1579827269.0,"Thanks. I'm not sure it will work with the current mattress, but it means I can probably get another cheap one and just get that to help."
AmItheAsshole,ffdr6z9,t1_ffdldu3,1579826943.0,"54,500 for the house

15,000 to fix a joist under it that broke after Florence

8,000 to replace the AC unit when it died

16,000 to replace windows and roof for insurance purposes

1,000 to Best Buy (it started with him wanting a switch)
-

I've paid the AC unit down to 2,056

House is currently at 52,000
-

A lot of the debt comes from the house. My ability to make better payments was limited by the fact that my husband absolutely needed gas and food money every paycheck. So that's 400-600 a month that wasn't being used. He used it primarily on fast food and never really ate at home. Then when I would want to go get food instead of cook he'd tell me we don't have the money or we eat to much fast food. He never really used it on gas because I had to get him gas a lot. He mostly used it on buying whatever game he fancied that week. I feel like with the extra money every month I wouldn't have had to do absolute minimum payments on a lot of things. Primarily my card that had to be used to make up the difference for the windows. It started at 4,000 and every time something went wrong the payments to that got to be less and less to the point I actually ended up being late a few times. The minimum now is 356 a month with the interest being around 150 added every month. Add that to the insurance and phone bill it's 355 a month added onto the card. I've basically only been able to pay 1 dollar every month. Whenever he gets a big bonus I insist on throwing it at the card. His last bonus he tried to convince me it was ok to get a dyson hair dryer. When I said no he bought a 100 ipad cover and Death Stranding and then gave each of his managers 100. When all that was done I got about 500 to work with ouy of the 1000 he got in the bonus.

*edit*
I may have forgotten things like what we owe my dad off the books."
AmItheAsshole,ffdjcdh,t1_ffdgodx,1579822096.0,I will look into mattress toppers. If I can get a really nice one then to hell with a more expensive mattress.
AmItheAsshole,ffdj7fr,t1_ffdca8c,1579822010.0,Thanks I'll keep this in mind. I'm going to try and make him wait though.
AmItheAsshole,ffd9afr,t1_ffd7r08,1579815939.0,"I think it’s not bothering him the same way because the only accounts in his name are his phone and we’re both on for the house. Literally everything else is on me. If we separated then I’m sad and screwed. If I stay and nothing changes I’m still kind of sad and screwed. He went through a period in time like this with his ex and at some point he gained the ability to just not care about owing people money. He was paying on the car because the bank would take it, but everything else just sat there. It all eventually “fell off” as the finance guy says. Now everything is on me which is my own fault, so it’s just me stressing. I felt uncomfortable with just his name on anything because if it wasn’t paid I wouldn’t know. My own paranoia got me into that mess when we bought the house. Also because no one would touch him with the credit he had."
AmItheAsshole,ffd8p7w,t1_ffd8jmr,1579815602.0,"Yeah I will set a schedule for the next one. This one is a lost cause, but if the next one can be preserved I’m willing to do that every 3 or so months."
AmItheAsshole,ffd88bj,t1_ffd4ut4,1579815330.0,Even a pillow top mattress? If not the next one is gonna be a different kind for sure.
AmItheAsshole,ffd84g2,t1_ffd504i,1579815269.0,I don’t know. I just want to be out of debt. That’s all I really want which if I stay on top of it I can have done in 15-16 yrs and own the house completely. Then a decent savings which I can hopefully accomplish in the next yr or two and from there if we’re still in the same house I want to extend the kitchen because as of right now my oven door opens and almost touches the fridge. That however I see happening in like 20-30 yrs not next week.
AmItheAsshole,ffd7qlc,t1_ffd647a,1579815053.0,I am aware and said this. I’ve been trying to pay my dad back for ages now. He will get his money back on and off the books regardless of what my husband wants. That I know for sure.
AmItheAsshole,ffd74cr,t1_ffd6szn,1579814715.0,No my dad is military well retired military and at the time my ID was stolen I was still his dependent technically. I am no longer. He just takes me on base now so that I can shop cheaper.
AmItheAsshole,ffd6afb,t1_ffd3u9h,1579814251.0,The last time I planned anything it was like a tiny mini vacation after one of my doctors appointments in the next state over. We went to an aquarium and we did Pokémon go. And then we ate at a nice restaurant that was not expensive. As far as I’m aware he had plenty of fun. I think the only time we haven’t had fun when I planned something was when we went to a waterpark in the same town that I used to go to as a child. Even then the only reason we didn’t have fun was because the park owner just let the place get into disrepair which I was unaware of. Honestly I think if he wanted to go anywhere especially since it’s not that far from us I think New York would be a better type of vacation. New York it’s more we want to see things and then buy things where Japan it’s more we want to go to buy things rather than see things. I’m not even really sure why he’s complaining about a vacation since his Boss is taking all their managers to Las Vegas or something next year and I won’t be going because he’s afraid something will happen to me while he’s in a meeting. Oh and I forgot also because he said it would be too expensive.
AmItheAsshole,ffd32x5,t1_ffd2352,1579812457.0,"I was actually in therapy till it got to a point where we couldn’t afford it. With this I was hoping I could return to it because it was actually helping. At least I thought it was. He regularly said he didn’t think it was helping me. I’m not sure if he’ll go to someone, but I can try to make him I guess."
AmItheAsshole,ffd2jk1,t1_ffd14dz,1579812150.0,He’ll probably try to split up the cost of tickets and hotels because just the tickets is 1300 at the lowest but I have no idea about hotels and then it’s going to matter about location. Airbnb’s are a thing but I also don’t want to deal with some of the nightmare stories I’ve heard about them. Like things he wants to do when he goes there ours go to a big ass spa and The Pokémon center and things like that. Honestly I don’t think it’s going to be all that fun to go. Like yes if we need to go but we’re going purely to see the Pokémon center store and to go to a spa and visit cat cafés and stuff like that. I know it’s not exactly something that we can do here in the US but I feel like going to a really nice amusement park or even a waterpark in the summer or something like that would be way better. My main concern is every time he has planned a vacation it has turned out to be an utter shit show. Like they’ll seem good on paper just like the one on his birthday last year but then it turns into a nightmare. We had a 6 Hour drive to the place he wanted to go and the hotel he picked out had a room that was over $500 and we didn’t even get the room we paid for. The place he decided to go was some amusement park where the primary focus seem to be children and drinking for the adults with a crap ton of roller coasters which he made me go on several times regardless of the fact that every single one had me in tears from anxiety and fear. It was so unbearably hot we found out that my feet and hands swell when I get overheated because I don’t sweat. Then we went to a waterpark where we had fun for all of like two hours and then I thunderstorm happened so they close the park. After which we started the drive home and at some point he pulled off into a gas station while I was asleep and left the door locked even though he swears he didn’t and someone stole my credit card and my drivers license and my military ID while I was sleeping IN the car.
AmItheAsshole,ffd1q5k,t1_ffd16vh,1579811691.0,If I could make you understand that I probably wouldn’t be here right now
AmItheAsshole,ffd0zl1,t1_ffczitg,1579811278.0,I’ve said that in the past. The whole can you please act like an adult. Usually his response is screaming I am an adult while saying he isn’t screaming. Then he says I nag him like his mother. I feel like his mother and not his wife sometimes.
AmItheAsshole,ffd0tev,t1_ffd0mtl,1579811182.0,Yes east coast.
AmItheAsshole,ffd0q9i,t1_ffcyu9i,1579811134.0,He’s just dead set against saving the traditional way and going yrs down the road. When he first brought it up my dad even said no you’re gonna have to save for like 10 yrs if you’re going to have a nice time. I don’t see the big deal with going when we’re almost 40. Why does that even matter? I just don’t get that thought process from him.
AmItheAsshole,ffd0dv9,t1_ffctme1,1579810947.0,"He’s gotten better in the last month since the budgeting was handed over to him. Only problem is now he makes me feel bad anytime I buy something small. Like food or yesterday when I picked up chicken breast to cook for dinner. I mainly shop on base where it’s cheaper, but my chicken at home was just not defrosting. The other option was just eat green beans, potatoes, and asparagus which my dad paid for. I didn’t see the $7.68 as an extravagant purchase vs his December habit of buying a new game every week because he’s bored."
AmItheAsshole,ffczwtc,t1_ffcuimt,1579810683.0,That’s something I can do and even mentioned. He’s just pushed back so much saying it can’t be off the table “because it takes away all hope.” I want to take the idea and shove it as far away as possible. He keeps saying “I don’t want to save for 10 yrs and go when I’m 40.” I’m just like sorry but you might have to? Like I don’t know how else to put that it’s something that probably isn’t happening in the next 2 yrs like he wants.
AmItheAsshole,ffcz683,t1_ffcuvsj,1579810272.0,"We’re in that much debt because of the house? Granted he does spend frivolously a massive amount of that debt is the house. As far as our spending the only thing that’s miscellaneous debt is Best Buy at a little over $1,000. The house was $54,500. Then the AC Unit died and that was $8,000. The windows had to be replaced and that was $12,000. The roof had to be redone or the house couldn’t be insured and that was $4,000. Then a joist broke under the house after Florence and the insurance company swore up an down that it was pre-existing so that was another $15,000. He spends frivolously yes, but that spending isn’t the specific reason we’re in this much debt. The house is the reason. He’s just wanting to blow what we’re getting and I don’t. I want to be debt free. I don’t want to owe anything on my credit card anymore. I want to not have so many accounts open in my name.

My thing is we’re finally going to be able to have money in the bank. We’re not going to have to stress about what if something else breaks. What if the car dies again. Everyone is assuming we’ve spent money completely on insane BS and we haven’t. Not really. Anything I’ve ok’d has been for the house, the bills, food, etc. If he used my card it was because he blew through his allotted 200 for gas and food on games. It’s not a lesson I need to learn. It’s one he has to learn. I’ve always been extremely frugal and that’s why my credit scores been over 700 for most of my life. If he’d just listen to me I don’t think it’d be as much of an issue, but he’s just been dead set against me being right for some reason."
AmItheAsshole,ffcylcs,t1_ffcvcy0,1579809946.0,"That’s something I’ve also said. The $3,000 set aside was like a serious overestimate. My dad and I had plenty of fun when we went to Florida and he only took a $1,000 for the whole trip. I don’t really want to go on vacation at all to be honest. I would have to leave my cats and that’s not something I want to do."
AmItheAsshole,ffcybby,t1_ffcxwju,1579809784.0,That’s round trip from where we are. I searched incognito as well.
AmItheAsshole,ffcskx8,t1_ffcrwqq,1579806401.0,We've been to see a financial planner. It's how we started the whole refinancing thing. When he started budgeting for us he saw I was using our money down to almost an exact amount and the excess was used pretty much solely by him. Marriage counselling is probably the best option. When I was seeing the therapist before she actually agreed with a lot of the things I would say and suggested counselling as well. We just didn't have money to do it. Now we might.
AmItheAsshole,ffcs9k5,t1_ffcs2xd,1579806212.0,I'm all for traveling. Like a year or two from now and not using money we owe to a bank.
AmItheAsshole,ffcrxe8,t1_ffcr6w4,1579806013.0,Well I've recently got him budgeting for us. He was a bit holier than thou when he started. Heavily implied (whether intentional or not is unknown) that I just wasn't budgeting our money properly. He quickly found out my budget was exact and the excess money we have every month is what hes spent on fast food and videogames.
AmItheAsshole,ffcrjqp,t1_ffcqyzn,1579805787.0,"That's what I've been telling him for the last 30 minutes. I just want some level of financial stability in my adult life for once. He's been short and cold since I told him no. I am getting a feeling he's gonna turn the whole want and need thing around on me tonight. Saying I WANT financial security. Problem with that argument is we also both need it more than anything. Also a new mattress...the one we got has a literal concave indent in it where he sleeps. I didn't expect much from a $500 mattress, but we've made it work for 3-4 yrs."
unpopularopinion,ffc9zo1,t1_ffbvocv,1579794910.0,I live here and it’s confusing as fuck.

gtaonline,ff1q5j6,t1_ff1ptt2,1579483715.0,The guards I don’t mind to much unless they get buggy. My husband just want to make sure we get as much out as possible. We like to joke about how broke the casino must be at this point and that poor dude who always gets punched in the face.
gtaonline,ff1pqqy,t1_ff1mvda,1579483446.0,"Yeah it varies. I round down to be fair. I always low ball that because memory is terrible. Last time we did a heist my husband got the big cut and it was like 1.7 and me and the friend both made between 400 and 700. Usually one of us gets 700k one gets 1 mil+ and one gets around 400. It’s been like 4 days so I round down to be safe. Plus it’s been a hot minute since I got the big cut, but I’m like 80% sure he got some where around 1.7. Maybe 1.5. Been forfeiting it till I needed the money. I do know for sure we never leave the casino with less than 3.3 mil though. We will absolutely fuck up the vault if we aren’t happy with the first run. Usually when one of us takes to long with the thumbprints. We’ll probably do it twice tomorrow if you want exact numbers. I also noticed there’s a cut off limit to how much you’re actually allowed to take. We had almost 5 mill with the gold glitch once and still only got rewarded like we got around 3.3. There all low ball numbers because I honestly can’t remember the exact amounts with how many times we’ve played musical chairs with the cuts."
gtaonline,ff1lpxi,t1_ff1l3pl,1579481240.0,"Well you’re doing 2 people. Of course you guys will get more lol. I’m going with 3 and we’re playing pass the blunt with the big cut. I’m sure me and the husband could do it ourselves fine, but we’re playing for fun at this point not money. We prefer art though since they patched the gold glitch. It was worth it to us if we got slowed because we had sort of like a buffer amount of any of us took damage for any reason. Runnings just way to slow with gold, but we won’t pass it up.

Also we’re clearing 3.3-3.5 with the art and at least 3.3 with gold. I didnt think those safety deposit boxes made much of a difference but with 3 people doing it I guess it does. Unless you mean after Lester takes his cut then yeah it’s probably around 2.9."
unpopularopinion,ff1kr31,t3_er1syq,1579480764.0,"It’s not that people think they’re gods. Animals aren’t evil. Animals aren’t really cruel to one another because “it’s funny.” People suck. They’re cruel to one another for fun. They will most definitely step on one another to get what they want. I’ve never seen animals torture another because it gets them off. Not all people are bad, but there are not enough good ones. People are selfish. When someone says they prefer animals over people they’re thinking of the cute kitten vs the asshole who killed her kid because “mother knows what’s good for her baby.” Animals don’t have egos or at least not the way we do. I’ve never heard anyone comparing an animal to a god. I’ve heard plenty of people say we don’t deserve them. Considering how many are tortured, abused or killed for the amusement  of a human I have to agree."
gtaonline,ff1jwk9,t1_ff1hpe9,1579480366.0,Eh we usually have one of us make 1mil and the other 2 between 400-700k depending on what it is and if we hit the deposit boxes too. Big con is the easiest and we never lose any money there.
gtaonline,ff1gfvh,t1_fez0ic0,1579478833.0,Ok then I guess
gtaonline,ff1gdgl,t1_ff1228k,1579478801.0,"Ok I have to get back home first though. I can add you on discord but it’ll be like an hour before I can try to do the heist.

*edit*
Name will be the same as on here plus numbers. So you know it’s me."
gtaonline,ff1g7ka,t1_ff0sy7b,1579478725.0,"Nah he does it every time we do the big con lol. All while saying “hey were here to rob ya...again.” “Pay the guy by the door more.” Plus isn’t was the dude all the way on the other end of the building. We were all like how did you even see him doing that?

Loud is so easy though. We only go after art and gold though. If it’s cash we reroll the heist. The most we loose from exiting the mantrap to tunnel is about 30k. The three of us never have much issue in it and it’s the fastest one. Also we pass around the big cut. So it’s always like 60/40. Unless one of us is getting to be broke then we bump it to 70/30. I guess you have to have a set system in place for it to work out. My friend who hasn’t even hit level 90 has bought pretty much everything he wants already. He’s just saving his last 12 mil to get the best car upgrades at level 100. I’m barely over 100 and at this point the only thing I want are just cosmetic stuff and maybe some cars to look at. I have all the upgrades and stuff that I want/need. Like my end goal was an oppressor mk2 and I bought it last week. It’s why I offered to help people. I don’t need a huge cut. Probably leave it at the 15% and I’d be fine. The only time I’ve backed out of helping someone was this 15 yr old kid. I tried so hard, but he was just so...so damn stupid. It was like he had a half baked potato instead of a brain. He actively stood in guards cone of vision. I was like dude please...I just wanna help. Just look at the minimap. I did all your setups. Just. Look. At. The. Map. PLEASE. Then 3 more times of him doing it I left. Couldn’t do it."
gtaonline,ff0ok3x,t1_ff0bgv8,1579470819.0,"The first couple times we did the big con we all went left till I accidentally shoulder checked the guard. Now we always go right. One time our friend was flipping off all the guards as we were walking into the mantrap. Apparently it made the dude by the elevator angry enough to set off the alarm. It’s not that frustrating since what we usually do when the game bugs is we record the last 30 seconds and we put in the discord to laugh at. Or just joke around in general when it goes tits up. If we weren’t able to make fun of it I don’t think we’d be able to keep playing. Sneaky legit frustrated us all though so we agreed never again. Besides loud and con aren’t even really much harder on hard. In con we literally only have to knock out one dude so we don’t even do Duggan or patrol routes for it. With loud we’re so efficient at killing the dudes on the way out we always stop to grab the extra cash you usually get in sneaky. Ive got so many recordings of stupid shit happening in gta I’ve just made it it’s own folder at this point. All I’ve learned is I have to be able to laugh at it or I’ll hate the game. The stuff popping up 3 ft in front of me is only super frustrating when I’m trying to sell cars. Like I’ve managed to almost get it to the buyer undamaged and bam a bus is blinking into existence. My husband always thought it was a modder till he saw it was just us in the lobby.

*edit* 
As far as finish time the way we do it is me and friend will do all the double missions while my husband takes care of the single and then trade off so my husband and friend are doing all the double missions while I do the singles. At this point we can pull off 4 heists a day as long as all the equipment isn’t in friggin paleto bay or whatever."
gtaonline,ff09pk6,t1_fez0i0u,1579466656.0,"No I mean we shoot it. With a gun. The stairwell one had been to much of a pain in the past coming back up the stairs we all decided it was the one we would destroy. Also it's so not the order. We have it down to a science. The game just bugs out. It legit just takes a heaping shit sometimes. I mean just 2 days ago my property tax went from around 20k to 840k out of no where. Getting in the prison is annoying for a setup because I teleport for no reason. During the heist when we did the big con we always go right when exiting the elevator because you can accidentally shoulder check the guard on the left and he STILL set off an alarm through the wall as we exited the elevator. We never actually screw up anything. We've only made it through silent and sneaky without quick restart once because the camera didn't bug and the guys actually stayed dead. Its a real big issue with the two you have to take out at once by the elevator when exiting the stairs. So many times I watched both the guys go down and both my husbands and my own screen did the little flash signifying that yes they're dead only for one to just t-pose and set off an alarm. There have been times where the cameras will just not move as well as guards not doing their route. We did the big con back to back and both times the guard right next to the uniforms just stood still. The next day when we were able to do it again everything was fine. It's constant bugs in GTA online and they only worry about fixing anything to make it easier to earn money instead of actual issues. Things not doing what they should, stuff popping into existence 3 ft in front of you, guards seeing you through walls, the infinite wanted level, etc. Loud and con have the absolute least amount of issues. I cannot tell you the amount of times we exited the stairwell in sneaky and the game said I alerted someone to my husband, that my husband alerted someone to me and that his friend alerted someone to him. A few times it even said I set off the alarm to both of them, but the alarm wasn't set off for any of us till we were halfway down the mantrap. It's buggy as all hell. I refuse to do silent and sneaky. I lost count how many times the game fucked us."
gtaonline,feyxm3n,t1_feyiw4c,1579451689.0,"We've run into the issue where we kill the guy and 2 of us clearly see the guy die, but our 3rd partner watches him get back up and alarm everyone. The camera in the stairwell has been an issue as well. It can be destroyed for all of us, but in reality it isn't in one of our games and alerts people. Then we've had issues where the guards just wont do their routes in the big con, but it's easy to get around. We have done the loud and con without restarting or losing more than 30k on hard. Sneaky it's a constant restart because every time something goes wrong no matter how perfect we do it. Either a destroyed camera sees us, a guard decides hes not actually dead (we've done duggan so he has no helmet) or a guard sees us through a wall out of his cone of vision. We refuse to do sneaky now and just bounce between loud an proud and the big con. I know it's not loud and proud but the first time we did it my husband screamed Murica and his friend screamed Grove Street every time they killed someone, so it's become loud and proud for us."

AmItheAsshole,feon71b,t3_eq1cpy,1579302533.0,Honestly they should never have charged you for something you didn't order. That's ridiculous. Don't feel bad about no tip. You paid way more than what you should have to begin with. It's their fault they gave you someone else's food. Not yours.
Advice,feo8mfw,t3_eq1won,1579296630.0,"Honestly talk to him and try to verify with something other than a pedohating community. Don’t get me wrong. If I had it my way anyone who was proven to have messed with a kid or had intentions of doing so would be taken out back of the court house and dealt with. Any official site I’ve seen in the US just has the offenders name, age, location, and a list of charges with a sort of age range. I found my FIL on it and freaked out. I asked my husband about it and he explained since he was there when it happened. The kid literally walked into his room after being told several times not to since the guy sleeps naked. Then went home and told his parents that he came out and intentionally exposed himself while the kid was going to the bathroom.

The reason I say all that is because the site itself made it look bad and it has bare minimum information. If you searched further you found the homemade stuff and it was honestly so much worse. It was as if they’d disregarded what the actual charge was and ran with their imagination. I don’t know how things are where you live, but I would definitely try to verify way before accusing the guy. Mainly because if he has done it he will do his most to downplay it. I worked with someone who was being charged with rape. I had literally no idea. He kept asking me to hang out and I always said no because the guy gave me the creeps. He finally ask/demanded if I heard about the rape charge. When I said no he was like oh well is the the child pornography thing? Like they can’t help but dig themselves into their own grave, but at the same time will defend themselves to their dying breath. “Yes we had sex and she just didn’t want her husband to know she cheated” and “Yeah the images were on my PC but they didn’t have proof of who put them there” 

Verify. Discuss. If it’s true then maybe bring the others into it. If they have children they have a right to know they may be in danger. If none do and you really don’t mind you can keep it to yourself. It will make it hard to feign ignorance at a later date when it does eventually come out though. Especially if you have talked to him. If it’s all true then the first defense he’d probably jump to is “well OP knows and they’re still my friend” in an attempt to deflect anger onto you."

He just does some insensitive shit and doesn’t get why or makes an excuse for it. Like on one hand he works all day and I don’t. I get he’s tired, but I don’t want to eat alone. Just makes me sad. I don’t ask for much help with housework because I know he works all day. I just don’t think it’d kill him to do the little things. Not act like it’s a chore to talk to me, actually eat the dinner I made with me outside of a video-game, maybe actually go to bed when I do so we aren’t sleeping together for only 3 hours at a time, etc. He doesn’t think they’re that important and I don’t know how to make him understand that they are. When I do he just blames my autism and then I’m like well maybe it is. It does help seeing that other people feel that way so my feelings are valid and it’s not just because I have something slightly wrong with me though. Sort of like I can stand my ground the next time it comes up and be like no it’s not the autism. The feelings are valid."

The husband I can’t REALLY be mad at since he’s at work all day and I know he just wants to relax. Just would it kill him to sit there with me and have a conversation for longer than it takes him to inhale the food before he disappears to play video games or sleep? He works really hard and gets upset when I bring things like that up. Wouldn’t be so much of an issue if he just went to bed. He spends all night playing games then goes to work followed by sleep and more games. We aren’t even on the same sleep schedule because he refuses to go to sleep at an appropriate time. I honestly have no idea how the mans even standing. He woke up at like 11 pm yesterday and stayed up all night and today to play games/work and now he’s passed out on the pile of laundry on the bed."

All that because one time I had a bloody nose and no tissue. That somehow equals you picked your nose. The fact that it was cold, dry, and I have bad allergies had zero to do with it. Only one fuckin conclusion there. Again in high school my best friend spread a rumor that I’d sleep with anyone who took me to the movies. Why did she do this? I was talking to a boy she liked (this I was completely unaware of) and the attention was being diverted from her. Honestly should have never forgave her when she pulled some shit after I got my first kiss, but how do you just throw away a friendship of 5 years? Did anyone ask if I ever even had sex? Nope. They just assumed it was true. Even people who had no clue we were friends. It took all of 2 days for me to become the school slut till I early graduated the next year.

If that’s what you’re getting you aren’t getting a proper sports bra because you did little to no research into it. You also never tried them on before buying them as well to see if they very clearly wouldn’t support you. You can even find YouTube videos very easily telling you the best brands and what to look for because they’ve made the mistakes already.
