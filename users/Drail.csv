snowboarding,ff7tv8i,t1_ff7it7u,1579658234.0,"I've been to both, Tremblant is my home mountain. I would say I enjoyed the skiing/boarding at Jay more. Its a bigger mountain with more snow per season and the double blacks were gnar. Tremblant does have a better park and quite the variety of runs. Off-mountain at Tremblant is MUCH better. Plenty of bars/shopping right at the base of the mountain with two nearby towns that are also very picturesque and happening.

Being a north-east coaster, it would be truly a shame for you not to make it up to Tremblant."
videos,fel5t5p,t1_fek1gtm,1579214681.0,"""Miguel’s father talked about the times his son would stand outside the house and spit at cars or even try and kick them as they drove past.

According to the father, Miguel’s sister has had to take out a restraining order against him due to sporadic violent attacks toward her. The police were called, according to the family, when he first started acting out three years ago.

Miguel had been given medication by Baystate Medical Center, according to Henry but he didn’t take them.

“He said he’s not crazy. He said he didn’t feel nothing. He said he didn’t like the flavor of the medications ... We wanted him to take them but we couldn’t make him,” Henry said.""

What a terrible prison this guy is living in. Hope he gets help but life won't be easy from this point onward. It's too bad he/his family didn't find effective treatment earlier, but it's such a complex issue."

Always, when I see ""share this to do X!"" I become skeptical. But the overt brotherly love shown is fitting for their culture.

Who knows. I really hope it wasn't just a few days ago, no bandages on a fresh open burn would be concerning."

They just buy youtube clips to collect on them. Absolutely no services. Inventing the middle man just to rake in money. Scum. 

More of this shit will just lead to a more restrictive and less creative internet. It should be illegal."

There's no way for a single person to encapsulate the ideals and information required to have absolute competence when navigating the world.

PHD's, STEM grads (myself), and other intelligent/specialized individuals are really just king idiots in a sea of idiots. It's terrifying but also helps in a way, I value community and searching for help even if it may cause a bit of a ruckus really doesn't bother me anymore."

Watch a downhill mountain biking/skiing competition that does good side by sides of first/second person views. Its best when the second person view is a follow cam. Not as narrow/steep as you think.

Falling would still be catastrophic, but the risk isn't as high as it appears."

People like Future, Kanye, Chance, Frank etc. definitely make it work to their favour. I do wish some of them used it less because they have fantastic voices, particularly T-Pain and Post Malone."
