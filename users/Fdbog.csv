worldnews,ff44egf,t1_ff3s3zi,1579555289.0,If life is unfair for everyone doesn't that make it fair?
funny,feo8fw8,t1_fenoj2b,1579296533.0,We have a local comic shop that bitches about this all the time. But then their prices are 25% higher on everything compared to a shop in a nearby city. Why should I be charitable when they are doing the exact opposite of that.
techsupportgore,fen5tiw,t1_fehx319,1579277621.0,Looks like the slice half of the tp7k system.
todayilearned,femulyd,t1_femsbso,1579270031.0,"I haven't read the entire thing but it's definitely a bit of both. He takes reasonable observations and conclusions to their absolute extreme. 

What he was most correct about imo was cybernetics and presenting a chicken and egg problem in regards to humans or technology. Which shapes which and who is really in control in a metaphysical sense. 

With AI and other tech advances he was definitely onto something."
freemagic,fegczj4,t1_feg1w1i,1579088211.0,So you can't bait things out by waiting until the last moment now? I'm glad I haven't been playing lately.
cars,fegctwa,t1_feg52jk,1579088021.0,"I just bought one on Monday. Not disappointed with that news, it's still a really fast car coming from a civic si."
history,fed6unm,t1_fecqxal,1579001678.0,Morning sickness is no joke. I went through a weird episode of male morning sickness due to anxiety. I can see how it creates PTSD if it's bad enough.
cars,fdsepq9,t1_fdrmcgc,1578701009.0,All of their cars are too expensive imo. GTI autobahn was over 45k otd in canada. It did not drive like a car with that price tag.
cars,fcmyri8,t1_fcmirqj,1577797953.0,If you haven't already look into a dealer license. Might help with the costs of buying and selling so many cars.
todayilearned,fc5nmlx,t1_fc5neqt,1577462171.0,"Oh I love my si, it will be hard to find something with such a great driver centered cockpit.

But it's also a civic, there are much bigger and faster cars these days."
todayilearned,fc5mpf5,t1_fc5jx75,1577461636.0,"Nope, I bought a ricer car and I had to use it for work so the only mods I did are nice tires.

Now that it's back to a normal daily I might mod it a bit but it's just money I could save for a reliably fast car."
todayilearned,fc5mi2h,t1_fc5lthr,1577461493.0,It's nice being able to use all 6 gears and not be breaking the law.
cars,fbxifk2,t1_fbwysrq,1577189055.0,Yeah my parents skimped on the engine in the caliber they bought years ago. It was manual so you could ride out the gears to compensate but it was underpowered. I think it was a 1.8 but the power band was only 4-5k rpm so it was brutal in a 5 speed.
cars,fbxhwjz,t1_fbwvo38,1577188311.0,"My grandma had the CVT version, my parents had the manual. I don't know which was worse."
metacanada,fb7w2z3,t1_fb7jxpk,1576600684.0,It's also horseshit because they don't recognize most of these credentialed skills from origin countries anyhow. We have an engineer on staff that we found bagging groceries because they wouldn't recognize or work to update his engineering credentials.
