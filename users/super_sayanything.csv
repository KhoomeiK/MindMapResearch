The list goes on. As a person, I always want everyone to feel safe and accepted. A movie having a minority or underrepresented person in it, doesn't make it a better movie.

However, when every single show is graded on ""diversity"" you're really just reflecting a reality that doesn't exist. I'm not sure how to accurately explain it. I for sure think that all cultures should be represented and celebrated, but when it feels forced it doesn't feel genuine.
