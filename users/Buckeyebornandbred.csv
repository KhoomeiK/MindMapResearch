todayilearned,ff1wirh,t1_ff0cwxi,1579487781.0,That's good because my ex used to work for a small time video store and it would easily cost over a hundred dollars for a new release before they were ever for sale to the public.
todayilearned,feztsxb,t1_fezpusx,1579461568.0,You could do an AMA!
AskReddit,feypd8d,t1_feww15l,1579448641.0,Haha!  The blinking  12:00.   Love remembering that one.
todayilearned,feynqvq,t1_feygz0q,1579448058.0,"For a while,  they had a movie guarantee.  If the new release movie you wanted was out of stock, you got a free rental.   They started buying tons of new releases to the point that there could be dozens of one popular movie."

todayilearned,fedxh3c,t1_fedr93d,1579021957.0,"Well, there's also the theory that at one time the entire human race was cut down to just 10,000 to 40,000 people on the entire planet, and we all descended from them.  That's a lot less than millions of people to pick a genius from.  Also, it's harder to make scientific discoveries when you spend most of your time just trying to survive."

bourbon,fecb4td,t1_fea58fq,1578969959.0,I've seen it but not used it.  Is it pretty accurate?
90DayFiance,fdli486,t3_elv6zu,1578524513.0,HE was SO nice!   He took care of me after he caused me to puke.   Up next: Nursing her back to health after beating her unconscious.

StarWars,fcxm3j6,t1_fbg9fws,1578066219.0,"Yes, but he didn't know about the parents until Palpy told him in the beginning of TROS.  Palpy must have put that nobody thought in his head in TLJ.  And Kylo knew it later to be Palpy, not Snoke that planted that thought.  It would have made more sense if Kylo told Rey that it was just a lie.  That Palpy deceived Kylo about her parents.  That she's inherently powerful.  That would actually have helped him get on board with his plan to kill Palpy.   Instead,  we get this shitty explanation that makes it seem like Kylo knew the truth all along and was playing with her.   It's shit."

politics,fcbpxiz,t3_egy41o,1577589671.0,"Just came from Christmas party with in laws.   All nice people.  They're happy Trump is there and hope for 4 more years.  Why?  Because they're investments are making them a bunch of money.  At the end of the day, all they care about is getting theirs.  That's all you need to know.  If the economy goes to shit in 2020, Trump is done.   If it's still doing well.  Then fuck."

AskReddit,fbu2fzq,t1_fbtdxxn,1577106062.0,"Thanks.   You know your mom and dad better than anyone,  but some people lie to make themselves look better in their kids eyes.  There is always a ton of guilt in divorce.   It's easier for some to blame the other person as to alleviate that guilt.  I went though 15 counseling sessions trying to save my marriage,  but she already made up her mind the first day she said she wanted to take a break.  When I finally got fed up and left after seeing there was no hope, she was happy because it made her look less like the bad guy to the kids.  Daddy left us kids!  I'm a much happier man after leaving that abusive relationship."
