Like I understand not needing to be best friends with your partner's friends but not knowing a damn thing about them? What if you're hanging out with people who negatively impact you but you don't see it yourself? Could be missing the opportunity for her to point that out and help you progress as a better person. This tells me that although she values you and being with you, she could care less about anything else that isn't involving her which is selfish imo"

MOMpics,fdlo5zi,t3_el6576,1578528491.0,"This was the best out of the three. Nice coating of trichomes all over. Green/purple with orange hairs. Didn't dank up the whole room but when held closer- strong scents of lemon/pine and fruit. Nugs are very dense and barely give when squeezed. Hits smoothe and fairly tasty in joint, bong and mighty. Burns to white ash. I wouldn't say very potent but decent strength at 22%, had me feeling sedated but still functional. Although this was a solid grab, I'm still unsure on the $150/half o price tag.

Quality: 8.5
Value: 7.5"
