Hes very controlling, overbearing, and I always feel, even at 35, that he refuses to hear me. Please don't let your relationship with him affect your self worth or self image. My sister never was able to move past our childhood and she's had a very tumultuous adult life. Mirrors often lie, so what you see others reflecting their views of who you are back are frequently incorrect. Just hang in there at home as long as you can to save and prepare financially for being on your own. Best of luck, sorry for the rant"

sociopath,fdgmtnb,t3_el7ulp,1578402575.0,"I always think the person is lying or has hidden motives. I simply cannot believe any person esp opposite sex just wants nothing but myself, my time, my affection or to bring joy into my life. 

I recently experienced something extremely disturbing to myself and it's really caused me a lot of unhappiness. I met a friends roommate in August. I walk in his house, first thing I see is my buddy's roommate. (I'm F and roommate and friend are M). The moment we locked eyes I felt an instant connection, attraction, whatever. A few weeks later we began seeing each other and hiding it bc we didn't want to make it weird for my friend. 

Anyway long story short I think I felt love when I was with this man. It was very painful for me. I loved every second of it, but it also poisoned me. I think I drove him away, we rarely see one another and I miss him intensely. I loathe every second that I think of him. I feel weak and disgusted with myself for wanting someone so badly, for fucking it up so bad the man won't even come casually fuck me. I haven't legitimately cried in years and I've been having short bursts of deep, guttural soul wrenching sobbing. 

I want this to end. I can't get over this. I am not blowing his phone up or on social media. But I feel crazy and weak and this is the first time in my life I can't shut off, I feel love, anger, despair and hatred all at once in random short bursts each day I go without seeing him and it's intrusive, irritating and confusing. 

Sorry I needed to vent."
