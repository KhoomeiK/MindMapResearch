ForAllMankindTV,ffb91gd,t1_ffattyn,1579755622.0,the fact it's the most popular clip of the series proves the show would do better as an actual sci-fi what-if scenario than a woke character drama.
space,ffb57m7,t1_fe6bh1y,1579752111.0,"Ikr, I was right with it through ep2 but 5 mins into ep3 and just devolves into a stage to showcase female empowerment over the men. There were inklings of it in the first two episodes but nothing too egregious. Then ep3 was all about it and just kept on throughout the season. I'm all for strong female characters. Karen is my favorite character in the show. But doing it at the expense of the men and, more importantly, the story itself is just distracting and pretentious. I want to be entertained, not preached to."

swtor,fehxnw6,t1_fehe02v,1579125928.0,"I am an artist. But you don't have to be one to see the current loading screen is an amateurish composition. It clearly doesn't hold up to the standard set by previous loading screen art. A subjective viewpoint to be sure, but one a lot of players share. It's also perfectly valid to criticize something as inconsiquintial as a loading screen if it's part of a game you love. We want Swtor to reflect the quality it always has and will call out the developers if any part of it seems rushed, buggy, or lacking. It's not motivated by racism or the need to get a rise out of people. It's not pettyiness or entitlement. Its simply out of love for the game."

BreakUps,fcoc7v5,t1_fcnphbh,1577828688.0,I can second this. I just broke up with my gf of 9 months. It's been the absolute worst. We went no contact immediately but I know if I saw her with another dude it would surely suck but wouldn't change anything. I know what I meant to her. It would just be her way of coping...or delaying coping. It's the same with your ex. She's just lying to herself. She won't be able to deny her sorrow for long. Stay strong man. We'll get through this.
relationships,fciwnkt,t1_fc1sp76,1577671597.0,"Don't mean to just jump in here late and hijack the post, but I just felt like sharing. Going with your gut is incredibly confusing. I've been trying to listen to mine more in general and just made my biggest life decision yet purely on gut instinct: I just broke up with my gf. It's been incredibly difficult. We both still love each other but something just wasn't right on my end. I tried giving her a concise reason and she took it very maturely, but in some ways that just makes things more confusing. Why can't our instinct give us a logical reason? I listened to what my gut's been telling me to do for months now and as soon as I do I feel like I'm making a mistake??? Life is so hard sometimes."
