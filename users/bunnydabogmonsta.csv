That means 80-90% of the population can be either and early mornings late night working doesn't really affect them, hence the normal work hours which follow the day light. 

Being in that 10-20% does suck and also have scientific evidence to support that it negatively affects a persons performance and health. Your better off to just find a job with flexible hours, be self employed or work a particular shift, put up with inconvenience and live healthier.

Floodlights dont help with noise pollution and also cause light pollution. 
I guess opening all hours doesnt increase profit thus why most places close at night, when something makes financial  sense people usually implement it.
6 hour work days 4 days a week increase productivity and profit.

A real solution would be to genetically test all people as being a night owl/lark is in your DNA.

unpopularopinion,fdnzzzi,t1_fdmx4hl,1578596299.0,"Very simply: eating only plants kills everythings and destroys the world through soil erosion, the ancient Egyptians died off because they switched to a grain based diet and cut down their meat consumption. The ancient greeks and romans both died out because of using up soil through intensive agriculture techniques and cutting down meat consumption. Listen to history.

 Basically the science says: cattle and livestock make soil and if moved regularly using mob grazing techniques also stimulate plant growth by grazing. Plants aka edible crops are all annual plants which are planted eaten and die, each annual plant uses up soil to grow and does not replace the soil, each annual plant uses vast amounts of oil to grow and be produced in the machinery, petrochemicals to increase its yield and fight disease and pests, plants rely of decomposing animals for nutrients to grow, where this is not possible we grind up the carcasses of the animals we have eaten, refine them into fertilizers and spray them over the crops (plants eat animals or they die) without us farming animals for food we cannot grow plants their wouldnt be any nutrients or minerals for the plants . 

Therefore plants,under our current system of farming cause far more pollution than cattle and use up valuable resources also know as soil, using up soil creates deserts where nothing survives that's useful for supporting human life. Therefore vegans cause desertification, carnivore or omnivores create fertile land. That's what they are doing wrong. Also most soy products are produced by clearing the rainforest, most vegan labelled products contain palm oil made by clearing rainforests. Most vegans are aren't actually vegan they just follow a carb only diet which is the worst diet for health and the environment. I hope that helps to partly answer what vegans are doing wrong?

Cattle food is the mashed up plant stem left over after the beans and oil have been extracted to make food and lubricants for humans, cattle feed grown where the rainforest is cleared is actually a waste product not the reason the land was cleared and crop grown."

unpopularopinion,fddk1kx,t3_ektql9,1578315322.0,"I think it was written into the books to help kids empathize but actually makes them rage instead. Also it makes wizard school way more desirable if the kids that go there don't even appreciate it.

The weird thing is you would be really fat, lazy with atrophy if you were a young wizard. As you dont know and are banned from vanity spells and pretty much fly most places (first years learn to fly a broomstick and levitate stuff) with unlimited epic food 3 times a day and all those slave elves to do your chores."

relationship_advice,fdb5g3k,t3_ekhyxl,1578253988.0," 50/50 is the fairest way by far, you still occupy half the flat and 50/50 on bills and food too. Another way is one pays the rent, the other pays bills and food (not including take out, eating out) generally works out about the same. 

Or get a joint account and both pay the same into it, this is used for food, rent, bills ONLY. If ones of you is short one month the other can make it up and all the income in and out can be tracked by both parties easily."
