Dogs of course have innate instincts related to their breed, but he'll do what you bring him to do. Not to mention, dogs all have incredible noses - I'm sure that with positive, persistent training, he'll be able to sniff out whatever you're looking for. Ours is wicked smart and almost too food-motivated, but I don't know much about purebred Maltese, so I can't attest to how much of that is the Bichon and Poodle in him."

It’s a Domestic Shorthair, sort of like a mutt in the dog world. It’s markings are tabby, which are the most common color of cats altogether (there are a bunch of variations) because it’s the oldest and most dominant color."

Adulting,fekuh2j,t3_ep5rjm,1579207848.0,"This sounds a lot like compassion fatigue - basically you're exposed to an issue you care about too much and it makes you tired (fatigued).

I deal with this a fair bit myself, having grown up in a well-off Midwestern family with a huge emphasis on volunteering and charity. Other users here have given great advice already so I won't recommend much but one thing we used to do was keep care packages in our car - toothbrush/paste, a blanket, some non-perishable food, a few pairs of socks, and a pack of wet wipes.

I believe we have an obligation to help others as long as there isn't a significant detriment to our own situation. As such, I still do this with the care packages when I go to larger cities (my current city doesn't have much of a homeless population, it's more food insecurity here I think) but ultimately it comes down to what you can do. Right now, it sounds like what you're doing is a lot more than most - caring. You may also need to, in a sense, ""take a break"" from caring for a little while so that you can recharge. If you aren't taking care of yourself, you can't take care of others.

Do what you can, when you can. That's all anyone can do."

They could also make sure he’s vaccinated and see if he’s neutered. URIs can get nasty quick.

Almost like a super mutt in the dog world. Sometimes they’re differentiated by coat color, Randall looks to me like a grey tabby.

When I got my cat, the one thing I was largely unprepared for was just how loving she is - all the time. If I’m sitting, she’s on my lap.

And a small piece of advice - don’t feed him first thing in the morning! I did that with Vienna and she would sit on my chest while I was sleeping and scream at me two hours before she was supposed to be fed. I ended up switching to feeding in the early afternoon or late morning and then right before I go to bed. Saved my sleep schedule."

From what I understand, and please correct me if I’m wrong, there’s a couple versions of cat allergies - saliva and skin oils. I think I heard this somewhere when I was volunteering but it also does make sense to me because I’m not allergic to my cat (who produces very little oil) but there are some cats where just being near them makes it hard to breathe. Depending on how involved her father would be, you could introduce him to the potential cats you’d be adopting beforehand to see how he reacts.

Additionally, if you have a guest room, the cat shouldn’t be allowed inside, so it’s as free of allergens as possible for him. There are also HEPA filters that apparently work fairly well, especially in one-pet homes, I’ve heard.

Alternatively, you and your partner could get a cat after he visits (if it’s a one-time thing or a rare occurrence)"

dogs,febw02b,t3_eodayw,1578963407.0,"Public transport might work, if you have access. The first thing to do (after separating from the attack) is check him all over for injuries. In a dog attack, especially with your dog’s size and that you’d be stepping in, it’s unlikely that he’d be seriously injured. Check for punctured wounds, which can become infected, and broken bones. Watch for behavioral changes.

Depending on your situation you may be able to call your vet and get their assessment. I know my vet at least will give a sort of unofficial opinion for animals that are farther away.

dogs,fe9hm1i,t3_eo5hue,1578937633.0,"Others have covered most of what I was going to say but I have one other idea. If possible, minimize carpet/rug areas where the dog can go, especially keeping him out of the bedroom and off of fabric furniture. It also might be worth investing in non-carpet floors, such as wood, tile, or laminate to minimize the trapping of dander. And think about getting a HEPA filter, that has helped a lot in my apartment to minimize allergens for my friends who are allergic to my cat.

When we moved into the house I grew up in, we had to switch out all the floors because the previous owners had cats and my mom and brother are incredibly allergic. So my dad switched the floors, then hired a professional cleaning service, and that helped a lot. You could also look into that."
dogs,fe99p2o,t1_fe96mqm,1578935616.0,"As a cat owner with outside experience with cats, these people would absolutely be a horrible fit for a cat. Cats are needy, cuddly, clingy, but if they're ""misbehaving"" you can't modify their behavior (except in a few circumstances) so you have to modify your own. Don't want cat hair in your food? In your bed? On your counter? Don't get a cat.

People who aren't familiar with dogs or cats often default to aversion techniques used on dogs. They don't work well with dogs, but cats don't operate like dogs. A dog will likely avoid the behavior and become withdrawn or aggressive. Cats, in response to punishment, hide and lash out - but don't typically avoid the behavior. Ultimately, people like this would probably just put the cat outside and never see it again."

This outside, observational perspective implies superiority (as in our view of humans as superior to other animals) so describing women using language reserved for that context to me implies a perceived superiority.

I seriously lucked out with roommates - the girl was super easy to live with, polite, smart, respectful, thoughtful, and our chores were divided well and she always did them. She cleaned the kitchen once/week, I cleaned the bathroom once/week, then we obviously were in charge of our own rooms and split vacuuming. Even washed my dishes occasionally, which I always felt bad about. She had next to no drama. Big family, though, who came over occasionally. She and her boyfriend broke up and we bonded, spent time together, basically became friends.

The guy on the other hand, didn't split chores evenly. He took care of his own dishes and whatnot, took care of his own room, laundry, etc. Never had to remind him. But never actually cleaned the kitchen or bathroom, didn't really clean up after himself other than dishes. He hung out a bit and never made a fuss when I was up late with a friend. Was cool with it when I slept on the couch for a couple of weeks after a breakup. He was gone a lot more, he was a climber, so he went on weekend trips with friends. He also never had any drama.

No difference in rent or anything like that, though the girl was a little less strict about utilities (like if the electric came to $73.23 she'd be fine with one of us paying slightly more than exactly half) whereas the guy paid to the penny. Personally, I would say it was easier to live with the girl."

namenerds,fdrbn8n,t3_emurvs,1578682140.0,"I think it would work better with a three-syllable first name - something about the flow is off to me. I don't mind the flow of Graves Scott, though the s's do flow together. All I can think of are girls' names unfortunately, but I do like the sound of an 'n' ending - Finnegan, Addison, etc - or a vowel ending, such as Malachi."
namenerds,fdr9fc0,t3_emu9z8,1578681306.0,"Have SO give some suggestions. One thing my then-partner and I did whenever we were trying to find a decision was to each come up with five options, then exchange lists and select two from that list, then we each selected our favorite between the two - maybe give him the restriction of five-letter names only."
namenerds,fdov9dg,t3_emhqbs,1578613657.0,"The only instance I've seen was on Queer Eye, the episode with Neil - he had a dog name Forever. I actually think he had another - there were two stockings on his fireplace, Forever and Always. Makes me think there was another named Always."
namenerds,fdo4kbe,t3_emenz5,1578598781.0,"I think either would work well in the middle spot! I'd be hesitant to put them in the first slot because nicknames naturally form and the dogs' names are natural nicknames for both, not to mention later in life telling stories about them. ""Once, Lucy got into the cupboard and ate a whole box of cereal!"" type of thing. Longer forms would work better in my opinion."
namenerds,fdo3tuj,t1_fdo32gw,1578598390.0,"In the myth, Persephone's name as a child was Kore (in Greek, pronounced more like kor-reh) which means ""little girl."" Persephone itself has debated meaning, but probably means ""bringer of death/destruction."" I prefer Kora/Korey as nicknames just because as a native English speaker, they're easier to say then the ""reh"" sound of Ancient Greek."
dogs,fdo39ii,t3_emd3dd,1578598091.0,"Those ears! My guess would be half pit, quarter GSD, quarter lab. His ears look a lot like the GSD I had growing up, and his body has a sort of shepherd-y shape. I actually wouldn't be surprised if the lab is actually some kind of terrier or similar."
namenerds,fdo1x0r,t3_emeaqe,1578597384.0,Love the full name! Prefer Seph or Kora/Korey for nicknames.

tattoo,fdfstoi,t3_el5sdf,1578369335.0,"I love them! They tell a story all together, and each piece is its own story too. My right arm will be a patchwork half sleeve, all in watercolor style so it’s still cohesive. The pieces aren’t really small though, there will probably be about five pieces total."
cats,fdf1d0b,t3_ekxoyz,1578351092.0,I love Eevee with the Christmas Eve connection!
dogs,fdemul7,t3_ekzdjw,1578342356.0,"Our Maltese mix was a puppy when we introduced him to the chickens (had the chickens first, then didn't have them for a year or so while he was growing up, so had to reintroduce him), but our German shepherd was probably five or so when we first got them. He had a pretty significant prey drive but was trained really well. As I remember, basically my dad didn't show him anything - he took the GSD around the chickens almost like training focus outdoors. Making the chickens irrelevant. The Maltese loves playing with the chickens, they chase each other around. I don't know if the chickens enjoy it, but he certainly does!

That was kind of all over the place but ultimately we just made the chickens out to be no big deal. Focusing on them seemed to make the dogs think of them as prey."
namenerds,fddjche,t3_ekm6vy,1578314581.0,"We had an exchange student named Salome, she hardly ever used a nickname and the one she had wasn't related to her first name. Of course she wasn't American, so that might change it a bit."
dogs,fdbcfqt,t3_ekhsqo,1578255970.0,"That’s part of why I’ve chosen to rescue and why I voluteered at a shelter - these animals are already here, and they all will die someday. I will die, you will die, my best friend, parents, everyone dies. But I have it in my power to make their lives better *now* and do my best for them before they go. They’ll die either way - you can make them happy or not, the outcome doesn’t change. Certainly your attachment does, but that’s true of everything. Feeling paralyzed and never doing anything won’t stop you from dying but it will stop you from living."

Hounds,fcvncya,t1_fcvf1r5,1578005823.0,Thank you! I guess with the equipment I was thinking more like agility hurdles and stuff. I’ll loot into the flirt poles.

namenerds,fcswape,t1_fcryb1b,1577926737.0,"With Auden Alex, your initials go from HEY to AAY. Auden Yael Y would be AYY which tbh is so much better to me. One of the biggest things for me with my name change was that I didn't want to make is somber - it's a serious thing but it can be as fun as you make it!"
namenerds,fcsvhl4,t3_eipj3r,1577926151.0,"How are Joan and Juno pronounced? When I was in South America my sister's middle name was pronounced with the ""H"" sound in English like Juan (but an O instead of a U). Is it the same? (So Juno would be hoo-no)"
