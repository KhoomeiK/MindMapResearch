AskReddit,ff54645,t3_er9gj0,1579579735.0,"Overpopulation was never a problem. It's always presented (wished for?) as a problem, but solutions are implemented and the population keeps growing. The global population has become healthier, and more people were lifted out of poverty in the 20th century than at any other time in history. Frankly, this is the best time ever to be alive.

Overpopulation becomes much less of an issue if/when we commercialize space, which we're close to doing. There's effectively unlimited room for population in space habitats. The mass of our planet converted into O'Neill cylinders can support something like 7 quintillion people. The other benefit of space habitats is less red-tape; living in a space habitat means you're self-sovereign, and don't answer to any government. That may not seem like a big deal to us in the west, but it sure will matter to people living in less-free countries. Basically where in the past populations immigrated to the new world, persecuted future immigrants will set up their own space habitats and answer to no one."

Futurology,fehj3dk,t3_ep4kxs,1579117574.0,"People are choosing to spend more on houses than they did in 1947. Houses today are bigger, have more amenities, are much safer, and have more entertainment value than they did in 1947. It's still possible to find super-affordable housing in the US, but people choose not to live in them."

Otherwise, just be aware that actions have consequences and be prepared to ""do the time"". When you're on your own you can follow your own rules."
pics,fdaquqt,t3_eke9h7,1578249065.0,Every crappy country on Earth is not that way because of some nefarious westerners being evil and twirling the ends of their mustaches. Most of the time those countries are crappy because crappy people are in government there.

worldnews,fcumdcj,t1_fcu9fay,1577984114.0,"What's sad is that you blame those issues on evil ""deniers"" instead of on your local government, where the blame properly belongs. Or don't, and continue to find your life going down the drain while government officials get rich selling you lies for your vote.

Australian are getting huge wake-up call right now on exactly who in their government is acting against their interests. It's not going to take a global effort for Australians to fix it either."
worldnews,fctmc8j,t1_fcsli74,1577948750.0,"Probably because “climate change” isn’t the cause of disasters like this, it’s poor management. Fix the climate all you’d like, but if you keep letting corrupt officials do whatever they want, stuff like this will still happen.

Not picking on Australia btw, for any Aussies out there. The US has plenty of our own corrupt fucks (see Flint, MI as an example)."
todayilearned,fcda2hy,t1_fc7gyze,1577608108.0,"So you're going to compare the social security payments received against how much is withheld in a tax year one-to-one, and completely ignore the fact that the average person will only be able to draw social security benefits for 15 - 20 years, but pay into it for \~45 years?

How very dishonest of you.

Also, the median annual wage in the US is $47k. You are extremely disingenuous."

personalfinance,fc6ye9h,t3_egg72f,1577492702.0,"Most of the comments here are spot on, and I know you’re catching up on retirement savings and therefor may not be interested in this option, but you can put that money into a Roth IRA in order to have a little retirement savings variety. 

Contributions into a Roth IRA are not tax-deferred, meaning you don’t get a tax break when you put money into a Roth IRA, but you also don’t pay tax on Roth distributions when you retire (your 401k and pension plan distributions will be taxable in retirement). So it’s a way for you to reduce your taxable income in retirement. 

The other nice thing about Roth IRA is that you can take out what you put into it before retirement without a penalty and without being taxed. That gives you the flexibility with your retirement savings, where you can pull some out to use for other things like purchasing real estate or whatever. 401k contributions have a pretty big penalty for early withdrawal, and pension plans usually don’t let you withdraw for anything but retirement. Since you’re already putting 12% of your gross pay into retirement, you may find the Roth IRA flexibility helpful for medium term saving or having some cash you can access penalty free if you need it."
