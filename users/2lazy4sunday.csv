AskReddit,fd5twli,t1_fd4k8v1,1578181464.0,This! I was deeply confused while in Sweden because everyone talks English but no one does smalltalk.
cats,fd47ov8,t1_fd301lf,1578165122.0,"Yes, you are right. Sorry, my bad. Thank you for correcting it!"
cats,fd2aw0x,t3_ejuigv,1578144478.0,It is amazing how fast cats adapt to litter boxes. All the kitten I ever had (even feral ones) almost immediately used it. Mujahid is a good student (iirc mujahid means student).

AmItheAsshole,fd1tqty,t3_ejn73n,1578136681.0,"YTA. Of course, that friend is delusional (maybe a mental illness), there is not such a thing like a water allergy (and if so, that friend is not suffering from it). But it is the same like telling a person during a paranoid episode that the neighbours are not monitoring her thoughts through a bug they secretly planted in her head: it serves no purpose. What did you win by telling the (obvious) truth? What did the other person loose? Did you honestly think your remark would make her refrain from her opinion/delusion? If so, you might have found the cure to some serious mental illnesses."
AskReddit,fcxgws7,t1_fcwkz6z,1578062630.0,"This was the first book of Remarque I read. Then I went for „Three comrades“, The Night of Lissabon“, „The black Obelisk“ and „The long way back“ (sort of a sequel to „All quiet on the Western front“). His novels take place in the time he lived in. They describe the political and social situation in Germany after WW I. Does someone else notice how exactly and explicitly, almost tenderly he describes food and eating? I guess this is because he had to endure extreme hunger sometimes."
AskReddit,fcuuj6e,t3_eixc75,1577988793.0,"Very well, I guess. Used a free service, did not expect much of it (was not ready for something serious after a breakup). Got the first message even before I could upload a picture. Went on three dates in a span of 3 weeks, had to cancel the fourth date because I had already met my now husband (date number three). Deleted my account after that. Unfortunately we did not keep copies of our very first (written) conversation."
AskReddit,fcaj2fn,t3_egpeod,1577570121.0,"Barcelona!
Attended my then-fiance to a business meeting. Stayed in a business hotel far away from the tourist hotspots but near a metro station. So I rode downtown and walked the city. It was during springtime so the city was not too overcrowded and the weather was just fine. Walked for hours through parks and gardens (nearby Montjuic) and was mosty alone there. Beautiful!"
aww,fc93wjx,t3_egf1nz,1577546618.0,Love them doing that paso doble!
AskReddit,fc10bp5,t3_efiwt5,1577304615.0,"I am 42, and may count as an older woman. I never felt better. Still looking good enough without all the insecurities I felt wheen I was younger. To remember you got along even during harder times lets you trust yourself."
aww,fc08mg4,t3_efftyq,1577283077.0,"Albert looks as if he is about to curse everyone and Christmas because of behing prohibited from ransacking the tree. Nice picture, nevertheless."
aww,fbzt4ct,t3_ef6ulf,1577260126.0,"Wait, was that a waran? I would have looked the same!"
cats,fbzssbf,t3_ef8k6g,1577259628.0,"I hat to laugh so hard I cried. Best of all: his slightly annoyed look „Can I help you, Sir?“"
AskReddit,fbx6eu5,t1_fbwq5lv,1577171363.0,Thanks for the explanation. It deeply confused me when I started learning English. The gift in Mitgift might be a derogative from the German word Gabe (which means gift in English).
