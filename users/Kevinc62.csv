I think it goes both ways as whenever someone speaks Portuguese, I can understand like 3/4 of what's they're saying.

Or maybe just the French can speak very passionately compared to Americans and so we get intimidated? 

This is so true. My boss is Italian and scares most people when she's having a conversation or even  being friendly. I have gotten used to it, but it's funny seing people's faces when we are talking: it always sound like we are fighting, when we are just working and even joking. 🤣"

Dude, as a social worker who has seenmany abusive relationships I would highly advise you to look for couples therapy. This is not something you need to get over it, but work through and put clear boundaries.

>We did talk though. I explained calmly why I was upset, and he did apologize. He said he knew he was being rough but swore up and down he didn’t know I wanted him to stop. I guess, in his defense, it is pitch black in our room with the lights off so he probably couldn’t see my facial expressions. But he also didn’t seem surprised at all when I brought this all up—so I wonder if he knew he had crossed a line somehow. 

Dude, no. Anyone who has had anal sex can see through this bullshit. You can tell when your partner is uncomfortable and crying, doesn't matter how dark the room is. He knew what he was doing. Please look for counseling."
