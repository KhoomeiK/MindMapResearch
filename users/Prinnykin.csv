Are you a man or a woman? I’m a woman and I don’t believe Nas has confidence. I can see why the other girls aren’t into him.

I can’t have a social interaction without someone commenting on my appearance by either strangers, friends, or family members, which has made me completely insecure because I feel like my only worth is my appearance. 

If I meet up with an old friend or family member, they don’t ask how I’m doing. The first words that come out of there mouth are about my appearance. Either good or bad.

When my father died, I messaged a friend to come over and sit with me. I opened the front door and the first thing she said was “You look bad” with a smirk
on her face. No shit, my dad just died. I don’t want to have to look good all the time. 

I’m tired of people commenting on my looks. It’s pretty exhausting to be honest.

My ex broke up with me because he says I’m not as attractive as I used to be. He said he loves my personality, but I don’t look as good as I used to. I got together with him in my 20’s and now I’m in my 30’s. That was pretty hurtful. I didn’t get fat or anything, I’m just aging.

It was obviously important to the client and they were upset. I’d probably be upset too, but I don’t think it was a good idea to make it public. Kinda looks like you egged him on to get content for Reddit.

All he had to say was “Unfortunately, I’m unable to build your unit as I have broken my arm. However, I have outsourced to ‘X’ who will deliver your unit on time. Feel free to call me if you have any questions.”
