unity,fe6oy80,t3_enyr3v,1578898731.0,"Definitely, first off alot of things will have to be modified from it single player state, such as the spawning of objects over a network. Another thing to keep in mind is when you set a game object active it false it will only show for that remote player,not over a network use this to your advantage. And thirdly, you'll have to create server scripts for joining and entering a game. Last note, you'll need to add a network transform script to objects that are going to be moving around such as destrutible items with rigidbodys and players, as well as their cameras."
