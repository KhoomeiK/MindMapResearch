Norway,fetmdb9,t1_fesrfd2,1579376835.0,"My town has around 13,000 inhabitants, and as far as I know, this has not happened anytime in the past years, violent crime is basically nonexistant (atleast I've never heard of it ever happening). Occasionaly bikes and stuff get stolen, but that's pretty much the peak of crime here.

Edit: I did some searching and found two cases where a gas station, and then later a man in his 60's, were robbed with a knife, although it seems like this was by the same people, as the incidents were roughly a month apart from each other. This was back in 2012 for anyone wondering. So there is a bit as I said, but mostly its pretty boring here"

One of the first things they did during the invasion was bombing the main airports, where the people didnt have bunkers or anywhere they really could go to be safe. So the bunkers were made so that the people working there could be safe incase something similar ever happened again. Again, I’m not 100% sure this is what happened, so I’d encourage doing a bit of research into it if you want a better answer."

As of March 2016, Norway employs a weak form of mandatory military service for men and women.  While 63,841 men and women were called in for the examination of persons liable for military service in 2012 (mandatory for men), 9265 were conscripted.[5][6] In practice recruits are not forced to serve, instead only those who are motivated are selected.
