popping,ffa6loc,t1_ffa3c01,1579728886.0,"My worst pain was from a necrotic gall bladder. I had an incompetent doctor who insisted (with no evidence) that the pain I was feeling was from gastric reflux. I'd had several gall bladder attacks before my gall bladder died so I expected the pain to go away after about five hours like the attacks had. It just continued.

To start with it was a sharp pain like a knife running through me from front to back. It continued for three days. I spent most of that time pacing back and forth. The pain didn't get stronger, but it became less localized. Instead of feeling like a knife, by the end it felt more like my chest was caught in a large piece of machinery. I lost my peripheral vision and everything was black and white. I could easily have passed out if I'd wanted to.

I was able to go talk directly to a surgeon between operations at the hospital. We literally talked in the hallway as he was walking from one room to another. He agreed to open me up to see what was going on.

My gall bladder had died and my liver had encased it to try to keep me alive. I ended up with half my liver removed, a bunch of big scars and a two week stay in the hospital with peritonitis. I learned that I don't like morphine."

I wasn't able to work and was laid up in a hotel room. Our local contact wanted me to go to his brother-in-law who apparently was a doctor. Based on the way they did everything else (rather slipshod), I wasn't comfortable having surgery there. Especially, since I only knew two people in the country and didn't speak the language.

I was able to get an earlier flight, so I abandoned my coworker and flew back. My wife had already contacted a surgeon. We drove straight from the airport to the hospital. I went into surgery not knowing what was going to happen. They had prepared me to wake up with no balls, but I lucked out and still had one left.

The surgeon said that he couldn't tell quite what happened. Apparently my scrotum was full of blood and pus. The epididymis was puffed up and ruptured like a balloon animal gone wrong. So he emptied out the left side.

If someone with actual medical knowledge reads this, you may well see that what I'm saying seems off. I'm not a medical professional and this happened 20 years ago, so I wouldn't be at all surprised if my story is a bit incoherent. The basic facts are correct though.

TLDR; My balls hurt, then they swelled up. I went to the hospital and woke up missing my left nut."

popping,ff3vczn,t1_ff3s42z,1579549666.0,"> According to a paper by Canadian academics Serge Larivée, Geneviève Chénard and Carole Sénéchal, Teresa's clinics received millions of dollars in donations but lacked medical care, systematic diagnosis, necessary nutrition and sufficient analgesics for those in pain; in the opinion of the three academics, ""Mother Teresa believed the sick must suffer like Christ on the cross"". It was said that the additional money might have transformed the health of the city's poor by creating advanced palliative care facilities.

> One of Teresa's most outspoken critics was English journalist, literary critic and antitheist Christopher Hitchens, host of the documentary Hell's Angel (1994) and author of the essay The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice (1995) who wrote in a 2003 article: ""This returns us to the medieval corruption of the church, which sold indulgences to the rich while preaching hellfire and continence to the poor. [Mother Teresa] was not a friend of the poor. She was a friend of poverty. She said that suffering was a gift from God. She spent her life opposing the only known cure for poverty, which is the empowerment of women and the emancipation of them from a livestock version of compulsory reproduction."" He accused her of hypocrisy for choosing advanced treatment for her heart condition. Hitchens said that ""her intention was not to help people"", and that she lied to donors about how their contributions were used. ""It was by talking to her that I discovered, and she assured me, that she wasn't working to alleviate poverty"", he said, ""She was working to expand the number of Catholics. She said, 'I'm not a social worker. I don't do it for this reason. I do it for Christ. I do it for the church.'"" Although Hitchens thought he was the only witness called by the Vatican, Aroup Chatterjee (author of Mother Teresa: The Untold Story) was also called to present evidence opposing Teresa's beatification and canonisation; the Vatican had abolished the traditional ""devil's advocate"", which served a similar purpose.

> Abortion-rights groups have also criticised Teresa's stance against abortion and contraception.
