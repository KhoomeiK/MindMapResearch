AskReddit,ffe93rj,t3_esse9d,1579840086.0,"I was like 6 (ish) getting a plateful of pickles at a buffet when a man says, ""you know those aren't pickles, right?""  I'm just thinking bitch ass I know what a pickle is...so I stared him dead in the eye and shove them in my mouth to prove to the guy I know what a pickle is, CLEARLY they're pickles, aaaaaaaand they were jalapenos.

I always wonder if other strangers rememeber insignificant things about me."
Instagramreality,ffe3wkt,t1_ffdpr57,1579836034.0,Can you link a recent natural picture of her? I have no idea who she is and would like to see the current comparison.
HomeDecorating,ff6jkpl,t1_ff64u4p,1579628575.0,Haha yeah the whole stairs and basement are unfinished.  Working on it.
HomeDecorating,ff20cmj,t1_ff207v7,1579490436.0,"You could maybe turn it so it's in that little nook area?  Gosh I'm jealous of that space though, it's so cute!"
HomeDecorating,ff20418,t1_fezg4su,1579490262.0,"And this https://imgur.com/a/uBEXer7

Your other view.  But what a beautiful space you have!"
HomeDecorating,ff1zkg5,t1_fezg4su,1579489870.0,"Like this https://imgur.com/a/Q2NyRsV

Hahaha it looks awful but like this, the grey circles are a small coffee table and small side table"
HomeDecorating,ff1yxbw,t1_fezg4su,1579489403.0,"You could maybe put your TV in the (from the picture point of view)  back left corner between the 2 windows and have that awesome green sectional on the opposite wall (on the same wall as the knockout to the stairs but pushed all the way up against the wall with the window), then maybe place 2 small chairs and side table in front of the faux fireplace as a little conversation seating area?  Wow I hope that makes sense"
aww,fezfye6,t1_feyt9bj,1579456910.0,Omg this made me snort into my coffee
AskReddit,fewxi3z,t1_fewi3ny,1579420997.0,I love canned tuna so much that it probably wouldn't bother me.
HomeDecorating,fevysvf,t1_fevxkib,1579403243.0,"You're right, I just needed someone to tell me it wasn't going to look good!  I have been eyeing it for weeks, rolling it up and rolling it back out cause I got it on clearance and was so excited about it but the stripes just don't line up."
HomeDecorating,fevyd41,t1_fevxk8h,1579403110.0,Yeah you're totally right.  Luckily I got the runner on clearance and was thinking of just cutting it down and sewing it into smaller runners for couple hallways.
whitepeoplegifs,fesu7ja,t3_eqejz4,1579369028.0,Nothing wrong with a classic wardrobe staple like a black pant and a denim jacket!!  I'm loving the 80s and 90s vibes that are coming back.  The only thing I can't wrap my head around are the fucking glob awful giant sneaker trend.

millionairemakers,fesoet8,t3_eq81a8,1579367401.0,Wow this is great!  This would be amazing to help start up my business and get some bills paid off!
CozyPlaces,feigvk6,t1_feh7v4o,1579138239.0,No way.  It cant be THAT easy.
progresspics,fegwf9u,t1_fegcies,1579104044.0,Thanks a bunch!!  I know I'm on the right track then!
progresspics,fef7y33,t3_eomkdg,1579050310.0,"What is your daily maintenance caloric intake and usual daily activities, if you don't mind me asking?  At 5'1.5"" I  would like to get down 110, and you're a total inspiration!"
aww,fe5su8r,t1_fe4x5i9,1578874185.0,I am starting a small dog boarding business in my house and go to Home Goods or TJ Maxx to get most of my supplies.  I recently found 2 gorgeous looking freestanding wood gates for 40 and 50 bucks a piece.  Fleet Farm and Amazon were around 80-100 for ugly smaller gates.  Want this shit to look cute and be functional!
SkincareAddiction,fe5rdsp,t1_fe1jxky,1578873509.0,"I can actually see this if you consider the fuel use during shipping, but if you consider the fact that I would have to personally drive myself to the store to get my new product or even ordering one and having it shipped to my house, the fuel consumption is going to happen either way so why not have less waste in the long run."
Instagramreality,fe0c5wt,t3_ene83e,1578809404.0,Maybe this is before and after a buffet meal cause I can totally do this myself.
AskReddit,fe0axrz,t1_fe0anrr,1578808186.0,Honestly 100% even if it isnt sexy time related.
AskReddit,fe0abk1,t1_fe09h2m,1578807608.0,Maybe a mediumly filled trash can because anxious people like me don't feel comfortable putting the only piece of trash in the garbage.  I like to be able to hide whatever I am putting in there.
SkincareAddiction,fe06yoa,t1_fdzo97i,1578804669.0,"Seriously, this OP.  The first wax is not fun, but it is honestly worth it because you don't have to worry about it for a month.  The more and more you wax, the less you have to.  It is sooo worth it.  I got awful itchy, painful bumps when I shaved my downtown, and now I just get a brazillian and it only hurts during the wax, but afterwards I personally have no pain or itchiness whatsoever.  I don't even have itching with the little growth I get back because the hairs are softer with each wax."
SkincareAddiction,fe0652b,t3_enitkh,1578804023.0,"Funny, I was thinking about this today looking at my little TO glass bottles and wondering if somehow a skincare company could set it up that you could send your bottles back to get refilled instead of tossing them out."
interestingasfuck,fdx4gqo,t1_fdwzyad,1578765237.0,That's literally the exact definition of teaching.

personalfinance,fdr9ip3,t1_fdqhr2w,1578681361.0,Childcare and healthcare cost is the reason why I don't have any children yet.  I'm turning 30 and hubby 36 and have been preparing myself to the possibility that we just may not have kids.

videos,fdqqykr,t1_fdnrzcd,1578672988.0,"My husband and I were together for like 7 years before he got a ring, we had already talked about getting married and basically said yeah let's just do this, and the day he was going to ""officially propose"" I immediatly knew what was happening because he was acting so weird and awkward and took me out into the woods like a serial killer.  I still tease him to this day that he was either trying to get rid of me or keep me for the rest of his life."
1200isplenty,fdpkm7q,t1_fdpe06b,1578631226.0,Theres something about calling it a whipped cream squirt that is making me uncomfortable

ThriftStoreHauls,fdgl252,t3_elajlh,1578400918.0,I'm getting some PeeWee tequila vibes!
SkincareAddiction,fczl11z,t1_fczg10o,1578103550.0,Omg.  I read way too much.  It was so repulsive I couldn't stop scrolling.
aww,fcxgova,t3_eje4ww,1578062466.0,"I love dogs. Seriously, they are honestly one of my favorite things.  I don't want to be a Debbie Downer, but I can't help but get frustrated at how many people just let their dogs go up to strangers unleashed, and without permission.  I don't know if this golden knows the mail man personally, but I see it too often on Reddit people condoning this behavior.  Not everyone likes dogs and it worries me how a stranger may react to the situation, not to mention this person is trying to do their job and any little slip of the dog could cause him to land underneath a wheel while they are driving away."
trashy,fcu3k6z,t1_fctmuq9,1577971552.0,"Wow I forgot about this radio show, I used to listen to it all the time probably early 2000s but I was pretty young and naive and never fully understood the concept of that game.  It would be cool to listen again now that I'm an older, slightly less naive child."
LifeProTips,fcr1dkj,t3_eievvj,1577895340.0,"Wow, I was really into fitness back then!  Makes me wish I had stuck with it, I'd be super ripped by now! This has seriously motivated me to get back to it."
ThriftStoreHauls,fcpcd1k,t3_ei3vbp,1577858095.0,"All of these pieces are beautiful separately, but they really don't belong together all in this one outfit.  Not like my opinion matters, though!"
aww,fcl8uzk,t3_ehnrvo,1577742324.0,Aw man.  This brought back cringey memories of when someone told me their dog was having puppies and without thinking I said AWWW WWHAT IS SHE HAVING!?
AskReddit,fckacq4,t1_fcjs7ty,1577720784.0,"This is so true.  My mom and I don't spend much time together, but we went on a small road trip together and one night in the hotel we stayed at, I had a dream I was pregnant and going into labor and she was rushing me to the hospital.  The next day before I had even mentioned my dream she told me she had a dream I was going into labor and she was rushing me to the hospital. Not exactly the same as having the urge to contact someone, but I found it so interesting and strange that even though I wasn't pregnant nor had we talked about it on the trip whatsoever, she had the exact same dream, the same night I was dreaming it, in her own perspective.  Almost like we were starring in a movie together."
HomeDecorating,fcbio1o,t1_fcb8sl7,1577587329.0,"Your floors are beautiful and that ""Sea Salt"" color would look amazing!!   If you are looking to incorporate pinks, blues and mint colors as accent pieces, honestly I'm a huge fan of neutrals on the wall and Behr ""Greige"" with fresh white curtains would look amazing, or maybe a few shades lighter than ""Greige"" to get that more airy feel.  Maybe even an antique white color?!  That way you can decide any accent piece you want:  light an airy, deep and heavy, Christmas colors, fall colors...really anything!  Either way you go, post an update because I'd love to see your floors with the wall color you choose!"
AskReddit,fcb60dy,t3_egqchb,1577582815.0,I would like like a mf potato.
HomeDecorating,fcb53kp,t3_egwvqk,1577582461.0,What other colors are you thinking of incorporating in your accent pieces?
AnimalsBeingDerps,fc6pmi6,t1_fc6hzrx,1577486297.0,My dog did that on hardwood once and he ran to an island of carpet and wouldn't leave until we picked him up.
LadyBoners,fc4mzwm,t3_eg2r1x,1577421523.0,YESSSSS!
Zoomies,fbysh7z,t1_fbyryre,1577225124.0,It totally looks like that and he's using his tail as a kickstand.
