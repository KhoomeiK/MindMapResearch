mythbusters,feu5yru,t3_eqircl,1579383397.0,"When Doom 3 came out there was a *lot* of hype surrounding it because it was one of the most graphically impressive games released up to that point. The gameplay was very good but it wasn't exactly groundbreaking, and together with the amazing (for the time) graphics and the magic of the 'Doom' name all in all the game was very popular in its time. I think part of the problem is that it was released the same year as Halo 2 and Half Life 2, which are absolute classics, and the fact that they didn't have the benefit of hindsight, just remember that in its time it really was a big name game, and my guess is they wanted to use something kids of the time would have considered 'cool' so a decade old game (at the time) was out of the question. Plus as other people have mentioned, they might have gotten something out of advertising a new release."

todayilearned,fe517za,t1_fe4zpo0,1578864709.0,"I agree, there isn't a nice clean answer to this. I've never experienced the poverty that most of these people have lived in their entire lives, even if I can't completely condone what they're doing I can't honestly say whether or not I would do the same thing if I was in their position. That doesn't get the blood up though, that's not a nice clean position that explains the world as a place of good guys (us with an emphasis on me) and the bad guys (them with an emphasis on not me) so that's not the conversation that gets *the most* traction."

asoiaf,fc0qeqj,t3_efg5iv,1577297134.0,"I think Barristans quote about Rhaegar's martial prowess says it all, I can't find the exact quote to copy/paste here but in the scene Dany says something about Arthur Dayne being the only one who was as good as Rhaegar (which is what Viserys told her) and Barristan counters that by saying that while Rhaegar was a *fantastic* warrior, saying there was only one man who could beat him is totally unrealistic. He expands by saying that day to day happenings have a huge effect on what one is capable of at any given time (using Jorah's own Tourney history as an example). So yeah, on the right day The Hound, Gregor, Barristan, Oberyn Martell, or the Blackfish could have beaten him, and maybe Loras and Garlan Tyrell too."
asoiaf,fc0p7ao,t1_fc0mxyw,1577296371.0,"I think you could argue that the more well known Bronn became the less effective he'd be against elite fighters, since his strategy fighting them is basically to beat them using their own egos (very similar to Brienne in the books). A well renowned legendary knight vs some sellsword? Well shit the Knight's gonna make short work of the nameless sellsword and everyone knows it... including the knight. So let him show everybody how badass he is when he goes in and immediately gives it his all to kill this Pissant who's stupid enough to fight him (he has a reputation to uphold after all), but wait. The sellsword is *actually a really good swordsman*, he just countered everything the knight had and doesn't have a scratch on him, and now the knight is *exhausted*... RIP. Knowing he was a top tier swordsman would make his opponents cautious when fighting him, meaning he wouldn't be able to win that way any more."
