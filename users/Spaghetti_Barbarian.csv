According to him, it's a legal grey area for the tattooist. They're technically violating the law by essentially selling copyrighted images. However, you could also argue that tattooing is transformative (i think that's the right word) so it might be protected. 

I think it has fallen into the same vein as digital piracy. It might be technically illegal, but no single conpany wants to sue an individual so it's effectively legal. 

However, the tattooist said that we might be seeing some litigation on this front. Artists are testing limits, as they are wont to, and tattoos are becoming more commonplace. There's an increasing chance of some high profile criminal with a copyright/trademark on their face that could make a company decide to sue someone. Smart money is on Disney."

internetparents,fcmib54,t1_fclqpru,1577776397.0,"A swirly burner means it is a fairly conventional electric stove. Otherwise you're likely looking at a conduction or glass stovetop and you're outside my expertise. Luckily both of those are easy enough to clean (hot soapy water and a non-scratch pad).

You need a small bucket, dish soap, hot water, washcloth, a scratch pad and steel wool. If you have a lot of stuck-on gunk a small putty knife might help. 

Exterior: Don't use anything rougher than the scratch pad. It's tougher than just paint but it can chip or scratch. Most of the gunk you find on a stove is grease-based so a dish soap will help take it off. Wet it down and then go to town with the scratch pad. Most everything should come off. It's not easy to chemically bond stuff to the outside of a stove, but I've seen it done. If you run into anything like that you're looking at having to take a razor and many hours to scrape it off. 

Range (stovetop): Remove the swirly bits. They literally just socket into a plug and should pull out. There should be what looks like bowls underneath the burners. If these are especially dirty you can just throw them out and get new ones. The range top itself should lift up/off and you can clean underneath it. 

Interior (stove proper): the inside is harder but less complicated. There should be a ""clean"" option which just turns the heat up to a ridiculous level and cooks everything to charcoal. Before you turn this on scrape out what easily comes off. The less stuff that has to be cooked off the better. Don't mess with the elements as they likely don't come out, but you can scrape off anything that isn't supposed to be there. Set the oven to the cleaning temperature and come back in around 3 hours. There are various chemicals you can use to help with the scrubbing process, but some hot water, a little dishsoap and steel wool should suffice if you have enough elbow grease.

Broiler (bottom drawer): This is another ball of wax entirely. It's basically a drawer one would use to roast but even I wouldn't know how to use it properly and I'm no stranger to kitchens. If it is dirty you should be able to scrub it the same as you did the oven, but it's entirely fair to ignore the fuck out of it. I flip flop between that and using it to store extra baking pans."

internetparents,fcj6spu,t3_ehas03,1577678691.0,"You really don't need to use a lot of dishwashing liquid. Add a tablespoon to the basin and fill it with clean water. Temperature-wise it can be cold but the hotter it is the easier it is to clean. I really cannot emphasize enough that the water should be clean and warm/hot.

Just about anything made out of metal, glass, or ceramic can take a scratch pad. The traditional green scratch pad is good, but there is a ""non-scratch"" version that is better imo. A washcloth or sponge is a waste in my opinion as they just attract bacteria and can't scrub. If you scrub every surface with a scratch pad then it should be clean. 

After you're done scrubbing it rinsing is the final step. Especially using dirty water, if you haven't been rinsing then I'd be surprised if you were able to get anything clean. It's wasteful to use running water, but I prefer it. At this point if it isn't clean your scrubbing technique is garbage. You really need to just make an effort to scrub it properly. 

You can go in for hand drying, but it is a pain in the ass to do right. I like to keep my dishes put away so I have to hand dry. Never put dishes away wet. That's just asking for dirty nasty dishes.
