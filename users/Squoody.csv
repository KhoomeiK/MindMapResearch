When he told him to stop, a tall, threatening man with a low voice ""suggested"" to let the boy continue. So he was completely helpless as the boy snatched the wallet out of his jacket pocket. As he went on his way, he felt lucky that they only took the empty wallet he bought just an hour earlier, and then was pleasently entertained when the boy took it out to pay for a bus..."
