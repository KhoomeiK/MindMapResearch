I know I know, not the best parenting. She's gotten way better since she was smaller but likes to put a cable in her mouth here and there.

And just a general question, is anyone else surprised their bun hasn't been shocked yet seeing the damage they can do to cables?"

femalefashionadvice,ff6f1i8,t3_erwnki,1579625784.0,"Sorry but I just need to vent about something:

It was my first time ordering from boohoo last week and I've never been so disappointed with an online fashion company, not even the Chinese ones like Shein have been as bad.

Firstly, a bodysuit I ordered had a long hair in it as if it was returned and wasnt checked before being sold again. I know it's the not a huge issue but I would expect more ""quality control"" from a large fashion company.

Second, I had ordered these shoes that I haven't been able to find for YEARS so I was so excited when I saw them on the website. When it arrived I opened the box and... they were the wrong pair of shoes!! The label on the box was correct so I don't understand how these hideous pair of sandals got into the box. Anyways, fast forward a bit and I message them telling about the error. I send them proof of postage and get a reply saying they've sold out of the original pair of shoes I wanted. I must be one of the unluckiest people to have shopped on their website or something. 

So I was wondering, how have your experiences been with boohoo.com? It's a shame because they've got super cute stuff but after this, I really do not want to order from them again."
