holdmycosmo,fdtbsjy,t1_fdt5vgn,1578714530.0,"I was thinking this. If he really wanted to, he could’ve jumped up and fought back...with how he’s evading tho, I’m guessing he’s drunk and in no condition to defend himself.

Still, she’s a beast with that power."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fdlb6u6,t1_fdkk59x,1578520302.0,For real. Maybe the exception of children.
