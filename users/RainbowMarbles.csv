I did talk to my doctor, and she gave me the all clear to run a marathon. I don't have a heart condition (to anyone's knowledge), and I'm in the best health I've ever been. It's infuriating that these people say concern for their weight is just concern trolling, but turn around and concern troll athletes who push their bodies to be as fit as possible."

fatlogic,feh412r,t1_fegue7d,1579108692.0,"Disclaimer: I am but one person and speak only for myself, I am not super active in the ""trans community"", I am biased towards the voices I follow (mostly other trans masc people), please don't take my opinion as facts, etc.

A lot of trans people just want to be left alone: let us be the gender we are without questioning it, or attempting to murder us, or denying us work, or making backhanded comments about it. My life doesn't revolve around being trans, I honestly forget I am trans until someone misgenders me, or stumbles on pronouns, or makes the effort to say stuff like ""cis people suck lol"" around me.

From what I've seen, it's kinda annoying to be sucked into other people's fights like this. To me it feels a lot like people trying to get brownie points without ACTUALLY doing anything helpful for us, like make gender neutral bathrooms the norm, make gyms explicitely supportive of lgbtq+ people, support trans health care and force insurance to pay for it, etc. Put your money where your mouth is and promote trans fitness influencers over cis ones if you REALLY want to be helpful in this sphere, but the keyboard activists who say this kind of thing are probably thinking of ragen and tess over Jesse Diamond and Rain Dove.

So... yeah. Feels like they want the pat on the back without the effort. We deserve better than the scraps of acknowledgement cis people are willing to throw at us, but sometimes when scraps is what you're used to, it can be hard to demand better."

IWantOut,fda6xfv,t1_fda3b9g,1578242431.0,"Ahh yeah, I understand your dilemma! Well, since you didn't mention the city and are open to learning an new language, might I suggest Montreal? Weather is colder than Toronto and Vancouver but not as bad as Winnipeg, rent is a lot more affordable than most big cities, and you can get by with English only (there are 2 English language universities in Montreal: Concordia and McGill). Learning French is a requirement for permanent residence in Quebec but if that interests you, there are some pretty great language classes available for newcomers."
IWantOut,fd9jp1m,t3_ek9rti,1578234281.0,"Canada's education visa can be converted into a short term work visa equal to the length of your studies, upon completing your studies (it's called the post-graduation work permit). If you do a master's program, that's 2 years of studying followed by 2 years of work. After that, you already fulfill the time based requirements to apply for a permanent residence. I'm not sure of all the specifics for someone in finance, but I have a few friends who have immigrated through this path."
Shoestring,fc6mlfj,t3_eg8l8e,1577484149.0,"If your mom likes plants and botanical gardens, might I suggest le Jardin des Serres d'Auteuil in Paris? Free, picturesque Victorian era greenhouses, accessible by public transport, not a common suggestion so few tourists go and it's usually pretty empty... Still one of my favorite places in Paris. Le Jardin des Plantes is nice, but it's kinda expensive in my opinion and you can see zoos and huge botanical gardens elsewhere in the world."
studyAbroad,fbjz9zp,t1_fbjxnsb,1576942394.0,"Oh wow, ok maybe not then. Even the crudest vents I've seen weren't a raw hole in the drywall, they at least had a vent cover."
