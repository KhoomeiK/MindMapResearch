2meirl4meirl,fedkiei,t1_fedhk22,1579013802.0,">So do you think someone that internalizes rage over someone else's innocuous behavior is fine? 

I don't think it's fine, but that's better than being a condescending dick. Additionally the OP said they've gotten a lot better. Maybe you missed that. Maybe OP DID talk to a therapist and your comment was completely unnecessary. And why is it only on OP? OP's anxiety/rage isn't *external* like the leg-shaking. 

>Some people here genuinely need a hand

Then give a GENUINE hand and not some shitty, backhanded comment ""u should get help and stop being a baby."" You don't give a fuck about OP or you wouldn't have jumped at the chance to belittle them instead of reading that they *have* gained control of their emotions. People are allowed to be annoyed by something, but it doesn't mean they have to be a dick. And OP was talking about being a kid. Even if ""kid"" means 17, a child/young adult does not have emotional intelligence enough to control some things.

Finally, I also want to point out a part of your original comment:

>""MY anxiety"", ""drove me to **tears**"".

Nowhere did OP say ""MY anxiety"", especially not with that emphasis. You read it that way. You also omitted a word: ""nearly drove me to **tears**"". Again, no emphasis in OP's comment on ""tears"". You grabbed onto certain parts of OP's comment and ignored others because you saw what you wanted to see: something that confirms your suspicions that ""this sub is so defeatist."""

In July 2003, the Court of Appeals of Ohio vacated the conviction and allowed Dalton to retract his guilty plea, accepting his argument that he would not have pleaded guilty had he received effective assistance from his court-appointed lawyer. The court did not speak to the constitutional issues.

In November 2003, the Ohio Supreme Court declined, by a 5â€“2 vote, to take the case on further appeal.[1] The case was sent back to trial court, and in March 2004, was dismissed. The trial judge held that ""the charge did not meet the standard of the Ohio law that prosecutors used"".[2]"

Idk anyone who uses ""porn"" to describe writings (usually it's ""smut"" or ""erotica"") but today I learned. I just wanted to make a distinction that in the US this isn't punishable by law like real images but it's still gross.

Anal is illegal in some states in the US, but if I have written erotica regarding anal does that mean I'm breaking the law?
