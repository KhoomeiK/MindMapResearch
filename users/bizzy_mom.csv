Dachshund,fcx342j,t1_fcwblfl,1578049117.0,"Not all breeders. I have a problem with the puppy industry in general, but there are responsible breeders out there. But that's not what a puppy mill is. A mill is not in it for the dogs health but rather the money. Their dogs are often sick and under nurished, spending their lives within a cage"
