cats,fcbh6il,t1_fcb0cxp,1577586816.0,"Exactly! The more kitties you have the easier they are to raise because they really do a good job taking care of each other... the only downsides are higher vet bills, food costs, and more litter box cleaning, but it's so worth it to see the cats happy and playing together vs being alone and miserable!"
cats,fcbgkdw,t3_egwzvs,1577586597.0,"Kudos for taking them both in, they will be sooo much happier together than separate... more people should adopt multiple cats that play and lay together vs raise one trophy cat that's lonely"
