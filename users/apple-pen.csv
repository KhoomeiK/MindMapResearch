I tried to dig deeper and he told me he was thinking about a ""boy"" a lot (I hope by ""boy"" he was talking about an adult person) and I am not a guy so I knew for sure it was not me! He has been in relationships mostly with guys and few women but I am not sure of what he is. He said he feels like a guy, and when I asked if he is gay or bi it was like he could not explain or confirm. When i asked if it means he likes no women he said he has been with few women too so I am confused but did not want to invade privacy so tried not asking much. Now yes I realized or safely assumed he likes someone else and he probably does for sure since he spoke about the infatuation thing. And yes I backed off and now he is giving me a bit more effort than he used to. Like before he hardly initiated convo, now he did it 2 times in a month while I kept my distance. I responded to him but at this point it is confusing me."

GRE,fegbck2,t3_ep0g4u,1579086114.0,"Someone please correct me if I am wrong as I am also preparing for GRE but I think the answer here is **90**. 

Here's my solution to it.  Here's what we were told:

1st half: 6 months   X (number of games)  and  60%X (games won)

2nd half: 6 months 20 (number of games) and 3 (games won)

We are also told that 50% of the total games (let's call it T) were won in the full year.

From the above we come with the below equations

 A)  T = 20 + X => X = T-20

B) 50%T = 60%X+3  => we solve this substituting X to find T i.e. Total games. We end up getting T = 90!"

HaircareScience,fedgedm,t1_fed92a6,1579010818.0,"The split ends might be best to be cut off. Your hair can't feel better with split ends. Now, the fact that your hair is still dry is questionable. The thing is if your hair lacks protein it shouldn't be dry, dryness is not related to lack of protein. Lack of hair strength or elasticity has to do with protein. You also need to think about if aussie moist really works for you. I personally have tried aussie moist and while it is good for detangling I didn't necessarily feel my hair as moisturized as I'd like it to feel. I not only use conditioners, I use hair masks/treatments too since my hair is dry plus a leave in conditioner in addition. If your hair was overly elastic stretchy I can see why the hairdresser suggested the use of protein. However, once the elasticity is fixed you do not want to use protein as often especially if you have dry hair. So the constant use of protein products I believe have done protein overload on your hair and the issue isn't moisture. However, I have not seen nor touch your hair so I can't be 100% sure."

That's what I have observed."
HaircareScience,fe7e0o8,t1_fe6xoq9,1578913322.0,"The products you are using aren't bad but I will suggest some changes. Do not use kerastance Bain Satin 1 whenever you use protein conditioners, because it has protein too, and that can be too protein heavy for your hair.  Kerastase lair vital also has protein! It seems that it might be in moderate or high concentration, so you want to not consider it to be a primarily moisturizing conditioner anymore. Only Aussie moisture is a primarily moisturizing conditioner, and KMS is a deep cleansing shampoo with no obvious indication of the presence of protein. You might want to consider it i.e. lait vital as being something that is in-between protein and moisture. To get protein/moisture balance you do not want to use two primarily protein products.  I think you probably have protein overload. So try to use more of the moisturizing products for the next 2 weeks and see if it feels any better before you introduce protein again.

In specific I suggest...

In your first wash:

Do a clarifying shampoo (might help remove some of the protein)

Follow it with a moisturizing conditioner like aussie moist

Apply argan oil

&#x200B;

In the other next 2-3 washes:

Purchase a primarily moisturizing shampoo (with 0 proteins) and use that.

Follow with moisturizing conditioner

&#x200B;

If your hair feels normal introduce protein conditioners/shampoos back in two ways:

Either use a protein based shampoo before the moisturizing conditioner

OR

Use a protein based conditioner after a moisturizing shampoo

Apply your argan oil as usual after each wash/conditioning.

If you decide to follow this, I'd love to hear how it worked for you.

Good luck!"

offmychest,fdvxrut,t3_en7684,1578752953.0,"I sympathized with you till I read:

>I’ve been debating the idea of  telling her husband about me & all the other people she’s slept with  behind her back but that means she could lose everything. I’m not gonna  lie guys, I don’t ever see her getting out of her position unless he  finds out.'  
>  
>It’s wrong that she’s  gonna keep doing this to people. I feel so much regret about this whole  thing. I know I’m not the one cheating, but i was actively participating  in being involved in a love affair for almost over a year.  
>  
>I’m  just so lost on what to do with myself. I feel like I’ve got nothing  anymore & she is away with him as we speak right now. It makes me  want to destroy her but I don’t know if I could ever have the strength  to do that. Maybe I should just let it be & she can continue being  stuck in the same position in her life.

First of all, if you really wanted to help her you'd have insisted she leaves before this whole thing happens. You telling her husband especially if he has the tendency to be emotionally abusive, might turn him into being physically abusive. If you truly care for her you wouldn't want to hurt her in this way.

Secondly, if she kept cheating with you and did not remove you off her life I doubt you will bother with feeling regret. All this year it seems as if you felt OK to be partaker of her cheating. You were cheating her husband too, because you knew she was married etc before being with her, she did not tell you she was single i.e. lied to you. She did not tell you she is looking to get a divorce in the future, she is in the relationship as you said with Chad because ""Lindsay is purely with her husband out of financial gain & to  support her child. They’ve been together for 12 years. She also had a  first husband too who was abusive."" she had married before, and was able to leave that man, why is she still with this man for 12 years? It is very hard to leave an abuser, but if you do it once it is easier to leave the other time. It looks like she is not ready to leave this man though, and maybe that is why she preferred this new guy because he is there with her physically and more financially stable. So if they got serious he might be able to provide to her what she and her kid needs to leave. 

She was wrong to show you the boots she got from the other guy etc. You were a placeholder for her to get love but once she found a guy who gave her love, but also seems to be able to provide to her, she disconnected emotionally with you so that she feels no guilt to play around with her new guy or give him much more attention.

The best thing to do is cut her off your life. She seems to be a toxic person, and the more you stay with her the more you will be pushed into this bad place you don't want to be. She is using this new guy to also provoke you. Maybe so that you can do more than him for her? Or just to hint you they are becoming something more? I don't know.

Overall you seem like a very nice guy, and I am sorry you were hurt this way. Do not think that because she treated you like this that all women are as bad (this might make you feel that way). But always focus on building a relationship on a good foundation. In this case, by avoiding to be with a married woman."

In addition, we can never know if the father is truly acting this way due to what that comment said, we can only know what OP feels, and even if tired there is no need to call someone stupid because they cannot find their seat belt. I didn't downvote the comment but that is what I believe is the reason why."
CulinaryPlating,fctxb83,t1_fct7bpk,1577964250.0,It looks really good! Do you have the recipe for it?
HaircareScience,fctut8t,t3_eiq7ij,1577960652.0,"So, here's my 2 cents.

We cannot really tell you what the hairdresser meant because for one since you did not fully understand what he told you, it could be that it was paraphrased wrong to begin with. Secondly you need to ask him to explain. It is important to build a relationship with your hairdresser/stylist, where you can feel comfortable to ask him questions about your hair or what he is teaching you. 

SLS is not necessarily bad, it is bad to people who have an allergy or irritation. It is one of the ingredients that can really cleanse the hair. Some SLS free products are not effective cleansers or may dry the hair more than an SLS shampoo does. The whole composition of the shampoo is important as there are ingredients that in low dosages can do tremendous work. So using SLS is not a no-no to maintain healthy hair, this is something some people came up with because a lot of SLS shampoos happen to be drying, or they are using the wrong one for their hair.

The shampoo you shared has nothing special to cost $70 though. Since this stylist seems to have this own routine or methods to grow hair, it could be the reason why he pushes this technique. After all, if you do not use what he suggests he might not be able to get the results he wants or expects for your hair. Know that whenever you go to a branded store, like Paul Mitchelle Salon, Wella Salon, Deva Curl salon etc...all these type of salons have their products and will most likely suggest you products in their product line. It is easier to not get that only if you go to a salon that isn't affiliated with a single hair care brand."
Bedbugs,fctu2ek,t3_eivb3x,1577959545.0,"Even if the roommates say they see nothing, ask they allow the exterminator to evaluate that. It could be they do not want to pay for exterminator so they are telling you they see nothing. 

Most exterminators provide some sort of agreement on if they have a money back or other sort of guarantees. If you did a chemical treatment, usually one spraying isn't enough. That is because most chemicals do not treat the bed bug eggs, so you'd need some days to pass so the existing eggs can hatch and respray.  

Also the effectiveness of the treatment depends on the type of chemical used. Some chemicals do not act immediately, the bed bug needs to craw on the chemical then after days or hours of getting into contact with it it dies. Other chemicals have faster effectiveness or kill on contact. It will be good to ask your exterminator about how it supposed to work and inform them you still see bed bugs before going to another one. See if the one you went to can offer a second treatment for free or at a lower price point."

MealPrepSunday,fcqscua,t3_ei97zc,1577891452.0,Can you share the recipe for the pasta thing you made? I'm looking for some low calorie recipe ideas and this looks simple.
socialskills,fcqkkj6,t3_eiemdd,1577887637.0,I began this exactly. No sending of happy new year to people who never initiate conversation with me. If they want to send me OK but I am not doing it. I need to change that habit of going out of my way for people who do not care about me.
offmychest,fcpxbb7,t1_fcpw31u,1577874158.0,"Wow, I didn't know that. This might be triggering to a lot of people to be asked about it especially if they are still in the abusive environment, and even if they aren't. 

You are a strong person. I have also experienced DV and I am working on getting myself in order to eventually leave peacefully. Unfortunately, when you are under DV the abuser creates an environment of dependency so you do not have what you need to leave. I do not really have much support. I haven't seen or heard many people do what your husband did as it can be a scary thing. You're blessed! 

Little by little I am working to get a good opportunity to enable me to leave and begin a new life elsewhere. I hope I get the right opportunity in 2020."
