witcher,ff72m62,t1_ff6zv06,1579639875.0,"We're being fed a big limited choice fallacy. 

Because the bourgeois press represents both a pseudo-radical pseudo-left (see: centrist) position and the right-wing position and aims at limiting the discussion at those positions. They're replacing left politics with cultural commentary painted in the colors of radicalism, which ultimately is an ideological weapon for both the Democrats and Republicans. The democrats as a positive position that signals they're making social progress while funneling their base back into politics that essentially boils down to the economic interests of the small capitalists, imperialist war and also a strong bureaucratic state aimed at maintaining an acceptable level of social stability. The republicans can point to the obvious hypocrisy and idiocy of these positions to appeal to sections of the working class who are targeted by the psuedo-liberatory politics (usually, white men) in order to garner support into their negative program of being anti-PC but really one that boils down into support of big capital, imperialist war and a gutted state with limited bureaucracy that leaves only the task of policing and militarism as its functions.

Both of these positions are against the interest of the working class, an international class whose interests don't stop at borders whether political, economic, gendered or racial. 

When it comes down to it, the people worried about Triss' appearance in the Witcher show are expressing an unconscious racism that speaks to whiteness being an important and vital trait of their (and Triss') being, which it isn't. Whiteness in the context of The Witcher has none of the social content of whiteness in a post-slavery, post-Reconstruction world like we live in. She could look however and still fulfill the function that her character was written to fulfill. The people who are mad about manga and anime characters not being cast as asian are also committing this fallacy, only in a way acceptable to the progressive narrative that doesn't negate but is the negative of the former group. They suggest that in these stories, the race of the character is important to understanding their personalities, decisions, wishes, or cultures. Often, this isn't true because the stories aren't set in the ""real world"". They also get to virtue signal to the other 'progressives' that they're woke enough to see that whiteness and maleness are the prime contradiction in our society that needs to be solved for a better world.

A working class divided on itself, whether through sex/gender, race or nationality is a working class that cannot organize itself in solidarity with one another without view of these rather benign (but culturally, politically and economically amplified) differences."

When I, as a private producer, wants to exchange something that is the product of labor, I look towards the market where I found many different equivalents for my product. When I exchange my commodity as an exchange value, I'm measuring its value in terms of the other. If I have 100 yds of Linen, I might say its worth 1000 yds of tarn or10 lbs of gold or 10 barrels of oil or 100 cigarettes. I'm measuring it in relation to its equivalent.

The relative form of value is the commodity which stands opposite of its equivalent, which is referred to as the equivalent form of value. Its value is expressed in terms of its equivalent. Marx explains that the simplest form of value is x commodity y = a commodity b, or that there are definite proportions which exist between commodities in which they can exchange as equals and that the labor time required to produce the commodity regulates that proportion. 

He expands the exchanges a few times, showing first how there are specific proportions between your commodity and each commodity on the market and then how eventually one commodity becomes the equivalent form for all commodities by reversing the equation. This universal equivalent eventually settles out of this developing value form as Money, showing how it is that money can exchange for all commodities."

LifeProTips,fck9s0l,t3_ehmgz4,1577720385.0,"It really comes down to their conception of self and how it relates to change. 

If a person has a very static understanding of themselves and often excuses their behaviors with phrases like ""its just the way I am,"" you can expect that they don't see themselves as capable of changing their negative behaviors and will use that to excuse them.

However, if they see themselves dynamically and want to improve, then you should trust them. If they recognize, for example, that they have an issue moderating their alcohol consumption and its become a problem for them, they seek counseling and solutions, put in the work towards their goals, you should support them if you care enough about them to be in a relationship. 

But, it all comes down to what they want. You can't force the latter out of anyone."
