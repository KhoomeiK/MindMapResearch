It’s one of the channels that it makes sense to have a sponsor because of the time it would take to research, voice, edit and all that stuff. 10/10 Good YouTuber would recommend.

ADHD,fe9ab8t,t3_d4n1u0,1578935808.0,"Adhd is kind of like r/TheMonkeysPaw where you get the ability to hyperfocus, but on only things, you're super interested in or are trying to not do something you aren't interested in. At the cost of not being able to focus on school/boring things."
ADHD,fe98agi,t3_crycw2,1578935274.0,"This was me until I first got into high school. It's currently the second semester and I've gone from a-b student to a flat C student. I didn't know I had ADHD until the counselor called me in to discuss it. My testing grade is one or two letter grades above my normal grade because I always forget homework. Typing this in class right now. Substitute gives us 30 mins for a 4-page packet that we don't even have the resources to complete. When I write things I always go on long rants so sorry about this. Thanks for taking the time to read, and if you're procrastinating like me right now make a quick attempt to get back to what you're working on. It's nice to have a community that understands that we can't snap our fingers and instantly become hyperfocused on the paper we're righting so try to get people in your life to double-check you too. (Random rant.)"
