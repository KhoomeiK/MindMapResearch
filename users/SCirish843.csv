OPS didn't exist in baseball before then, on base % and slugging were separate categories and the only stats that mattered to teams were average, home runs, and RBIs.

They used the new OPS (on base + slugging) to find low value players in the market that other teams looked over. 

They're most famous for signing catcher Scott Hatteberg and moving him to first base just so he could hit. He had pedestrian average, home run, and RBI numbers so they got him for dirt cheap. He ended up having a resurgent career at his new position. 

A more apt soccer comparison would be looking passed a high goal/assist total player and signing a much cheaper alternative with comparable xG, xA, and key pass stats.  Or a Bale situation where you buy a wingback for cheaper than you'd buy a forward but has good attacking metrics and move him up the pitch.
