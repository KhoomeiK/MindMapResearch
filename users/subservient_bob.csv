Yes, I'm a big fan of the genealogy stuff but I think in years to come things like facebook and stuff are going to link in with family history ( which is super weird). I think my ""hoarding"" of cards and letters probably started when my dad got cancer and i regretted having thrown out things he had given me. So definitely some mental component there. I'm not over burdened and i specifically request people not to give me more stuff cause I don't want more stuff, i agree it is a burden.

I've got a close friend who is very much the same but that's cause his mother is a baaaaaaf hoarder, like she'd be on a hoarding show no problems at all! Everything has some sentimental value, problem is if everything has value then nothing has value. He has a very nice and sterile home, but he's always throwing out their toys and stuff, there is a middle ground somewhere. My dad was a purger, mum a hoarder, i'm a mix, i keep things like cards and letters but purge shit that has no use or if i haven't used in a while.

I definitely agree about the quagmire, the problem you have when assigning sentimental value to things is the problem you have when it's lost or stolen.

I created email accounts for my kids which I have used to handle giving access to them and facebool accounts, they don't use them but I tag their accounts in things so when they start using it or if something happens they have access in the future.

I known personally I treasure anything I have of loved ones i've lost and it helps to remember them clearly as youe memory fades over time, and I don't want to forget them.

Also when having kids, you want to protect them and for them to know they are loved. Especially when you have something happen which gives you doubts if you'll be around in a year to guide them. For me my love for them made me wish I had left them things to remember me by to help sooth their pain.
