SuicideWatch,ff9ud7o,t3_esgc2q,1579721543.0,Happiness is such a fleeting feeling I understand heroin users now. I reached peak happiness once and been chasing it ever since.
SuicideWatch,ff9u6k4,t3_es7hf9,1579721400.0,This is so true. I really hope there isn't another level to my bottom. The chest pain is a Reoccurring issue now.
pathofexile,ff9eo69,t3_es38jt,1579711389.0,I love this league more than any other.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff849c6,t3_ervy95,1579665581.0,Damn cold af.
timberwolves,ff8008d,t1_ff7qm7e,1579662448.0,The drawback is neither Culver or Wiggins are good enough playmakers yet. At times they look the part but honestly I'd rather try and develop both of them to get there faster. I think player development is more important than the offensive system but that's just me.
AskReddit,ff7owly,t1_ff6urwt,1579654775.0,9 years. Fuck me up fam.
AskReddit,ff7osw9,t1_ff6uno5,1579654703.0,Wet hair in the winter sucks!
SuicideWatch,ff7n5wp,t1_ff7klv2,1579653546.0,"I understand. It's not easy trying to navigate after a breakup especially not after bonding like that. Unfortunately life doesn't care how hard it is for you. Your forced to move forward even when you don't want to. When I finally moved out and got an interview for an internship I thought my life was finally on track looking up.

Then my dad unexpectedly passed away and I'll admit I haven't recovered from that. I'm really numb to that loss still. But I also got really close with someone in that time and unfortunately they were my emotional rock. They grounded me during some bad days. I no longer have that relationship with them and it hurts. Hurts because at the end of the day I cared about them more than they did for me. I was a fool for diving in like that but it was the only thing that was helping me with my depression.

Self-reflection has helped but you need to find something to fill that void she left. Focus that hurt into something. Focus it into creation. I hope the pain subsides for you sooner rather than later."
timberwolves,ff7is7d,t3_erxsjj,1579650528.0,"Well playing a legit big next to Towns would free up Roco back to SF and Napier to the bench.

Culver, Wiggins, Roco, KAT, Dieng is likely our best lineup."
timberwolves,ff7i8xm,t3_es0ah0,1579650167.0,"This is some grade a bullshit. I knew this shit would happen after he retired.

People really don't want him in the same tier as Duncan but if you swap guys, Duncan wouldn't have won shit in Minnesota either.

Edit--I won't stand for the KG slander. Not ever."
SuicideWatch,ff7hkle,t3_ervh6z,1579649715.0,It's a terrible pain. I thought it was hard losing my dad but when you bond with someone for a long time and then that connection is just severed one day with no hope to ever getting it back. Just looking back at how happy and pleasant those days were it makes you forget what life is really like. Becoming co-dependant emotionally is a cruel fate. I'm sorry you're going through it.
SuicideWatch,ff7h30i,t3_eru3t3,1579649393.0,There is a Cliffside where I live and the exit ramp has a sizeable gap. I think about driving 100 mph off that gap every night.
SuicideWatch,ff7gt7s,t3_erhro1,1579649213.0,I've been hearing that since I was a teenager. It never gets better. Bad things consistently happen because that's how it is. The deck is stacked against you with no trump card. Why even bother playing when nothing you do can change that? At this point I'm just a drone in society and I know I'll just be another number added to the statistic.
timberwolves,ff6ejlc,t3_ersoqc,1579625475.0,I die a little inside when I see Kat sellout for a block then the opposing team gets the offensive rebound.
timberwolves,ff4zy8q,t3_erm6jl,1579576548.0,Lots of visible frustrations from quite a few players tonight.

nfl,ff1yxq0,t1_ff1xs5l,1579489410.0,Valid point! I'm on mobile so it shows up as text so I ignore it.
nfl,ff1vu9a,t1_ff1uwka,1579487329.0,I look at it more as a fan of the game as a whole. Like I love watching football more than just watching Miami play. I'm not looking at it like your rooting for the league.
freefolk,ff1srm0,t3_eqw4tz,1579485363.0,Let me tell you. I will never invest another second in this franchise. Winds will never get released. I don't give a shit about any prequels. D&D absolutely killed the series for me.

nba,fezj1er,t1_fezhz4m,1579457844.0,He's already a standout on defense. He's getting better at finishing around the rim. He is improving at a considerable rate. Also his work ethic is incredible.

timberwolves,fetpj8h,t3_eqlgrh,1579378033.0,My working theory is at a certain point refs create agendas against certain teams. There is no other explanation why we don't get whistles or why we get shafted.
MorbidReality,fetlr7v,t1_fem49i9,1579376698.0,Not an opinion my dude. You're just an asshole.
MorbidReality,fetlfsm,t1_fet8fs0,1579376575.0,Yeah iirc they used a desert eagle to test that or some other high caliber firearm.
timberwolves,feszkxo,t1_fesnwv1,1579370475.0,I was just using Morant as a recent example of the type of PG we need. I'm not expecting us to find a guy on his level but someone with some fire.
timberwolves,fesn5l5,t1_fer0dup,1579367006.0,"Ja Morant. We need a PG with Swagger, Fire, ENERGY. We need 1 guy that others can feed off of. Okogie at times sparks it but we need a star like Morant to do it and everyone would follow suit."
nba,fepuisp,t1_fepc44z,1579331793.0,Ja hasn't even begun to enter his final form. Dude just removed the weighted clothing.

timberwolves,fep5ngf,t1_fep4tk7,1579312677.0,I mean if you know the defense is going to let you shoot those where is the pressure? I really wish we would adjust to take away a team's strength.
timberwolves,fep5hak,t3_eq8180,1579312568.0,Did I hear that right? 3-18 when out rebounded?
