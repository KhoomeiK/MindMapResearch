Machinists,fewxi6z,t1_fewofjk,1579420998.0,"> Why not? You can grind carbide just the same as you can with HSS albeit with a diamond wheel.

yeah, you can cut it to shape the same way you would HSS, but it costs you more, takes longer, and the machine is too underpowered to take advantage.

if you were to use carbide, on the upside you get the ability to take heavier cuts, and you get longer tool life. that's great on a machine with enough power to take advantage of those properties, but a mini-lathe is rather power-limited. there just isn't enough oomph to go beyond the capabilities of HSS. you try to take a deeper cut and the machine just bogs down. and while carbide is stronger, its fairly brittle. mini-lathes are notoriously elastic, and when that carbide tool jams you're likely to break it once the tool post, carriage and bed flexes and puts the cutting edge in tension. HSS will dig in and jam the motor instead, but the tool usually survives. (at least in my experience on my crappy hf mini-lathe) 

you already mentioned that you need special grinding wheels, but even with them carbide takes longer to shape than HSS. and it costs more, even the brazed carbides are more than HSS blanks. indexable? i'm a huge fan of indexable carbides but they are not really in the budget of most mini-lathe owners - you could easily match the cost of a mini-lathe in indexable tooling, and you'd still need to have a backup plan for the occasional cut your standard shapes can't manage.

tl;dr: the upsides of carbide don't really apply at low power; you pay more for no benefit."

Machinists,fepxqw6,t3_eq7z75,1579334286.0,"honestly, it's worth your while to learn how to grind HSS tool bits, especially with a mini-lathe. carbide's advantages don't really apply at that scale. this site gives a high level overview of the process: https://metalartspress.com/howtos/sharpening-hss-lathe-tool-bits

if you can find a decent machining textbook that's oriented towards manual work, it'll go over the various edges and angles of a cutting tool & how to grind them yourself. it doesn't take long to get decent enough at it, and then you'll be able to make whatever cutting tool you need; why the various surfaces are arranged in the way they are.

> Along the same lines, I see a lot of pictures with tools being slightly angled into the work instead of being perpendicular to the side . Other than tapering, what is the reason for this?
 
there are a [couple different angles involved](https://metalartspress.com/sites/default/files/article-images/sharpening-HSS-lathe-tool-bits-image002.gif). the *back rake* and *side rake* set the angle that the tool contacts and cuts the work. the correct rake is a little different for different materials but it's typically somewhere between 5 and 20 degrees. the *side clearance* and *end clearance* (aka *relief*) remove metal that would otherwise contact & rub against the work after the edge passed by. those angles aren't critical, but you want to leave enough material to support the cutting edge so as to not weaken the tool. the last two angles, the *front cutting edge angle* and the *side cutting edge angle* are there to allow the tool clearance from the work where you don't want to cut. there's no right or wrong there; just whether the tool is suitable for the cut you want to make on the part.

that's the only real difference between your various tools: you use the one that lets you take the cut you need to make.


**tl;dr** the cutting surface needs to hit the work at the right angle; there needs to be relief behind the cutting point so that the tool doesn't hit the work. otherwise, you use the tool that gets to the cut you need to make."

the thing you're describing is *clearance* - the difference in size between the bearing and the journal. that measurement hasn't changed much in decades (usually somewhere between .0015 and .0025 depending on bearing size), they're just getting much better at not having to produce over- and under- size bearing journals for selective assembly. instead of sorting parts into matching tolerance bands to get the right clearance, the parts just come out dead on.

(realized you're probably not US - i'm not familiar with electrical practice outside the us. this may not be relevant to you)

i assumed he put another layer of drywall on top of an existing switch, sinking the switch below the new surface, something like [this](https://imgur.com/t3cBevq).

to fix it, you can install an [extension ring](https://imgur.com/ZKQIbmt) to bring the outlet flush to the new surface and put a [wider cover plate on](https://imgur.com/FHsPdCu)"

and honestly it's better that a *plasterer* leaves electricity alone... have you met the guys who work drywall? they're one quantum above roofers... they work hard and party harder, trust me, you do *not* want them touching the electric in your house."

oddlysatisfying,fc70j0r,t1_fc6hsrp,1577494289.0,"> The simple way to do this is to put some metal mesh between two layers so it can't be broken out. 

that's not what wire mesh glass is for at all. wire mesh glass is actually weaker than glass without the wire mesh, and the wire is weak enough that it can be broken by hand pretty easily.

wire glass was for fire code - so that even if the window broke from the heat of a fire, the wire would hold it in place and keep fire from passing through the window for a while longer. it isn't used that way any more.
