IsItBullshit,ff94805,t1_ff7pywm,1579704451.0,"Realists like you helped me wean off an SSRI. I felt like such a failure for not being able to quit after two weeks at half dose like was recommended to me by the Internet. The withdrawal was HORRIBLE. I went back on, started cutting pills into quarters and dosing down by 25% at a time for a month each and withdrawal was so much easier and lasted only about a week or two. And since insurance never covered my SSRI anyways, I wasn’t reliant on what they would provide."
shakespeare,ff93t7w,t1_ff7zatc,1579704165.0,"I would agree with everything except memorizing by rote. As a singer, memorizing hasn’t been a problem for me but muscle memory used to be the ONLY way I memorized for piano competitions.  If I choked and my muscle memory locked up, I had nothing in my head to call up to help.  Have “landmarks” in the speech where you can check in and restart. But everything else here is fire.  I especially love how WateryTart has phrased #5: “revel in the attempt”. The language is strange and you should enjoy that strangeness and unfamiliarity as much as possible. It’s like learning to roll your Rs for the first time (something we don’t use in English) and relishing that foreign feeling. Love it.  It’s such a blast."

I just finished The Mysterious Benedict Society and it was excellent. I think in two or three years, he’ll love it. The next book in my pile is Wildwood. I don’t know anything about it but it looked intriguing."
BabyBumps,feixgd6,t3_epcx9y,1579149901.0,"My husband won’t let me get an owlet or even a video monitor because our room is right next to the nursery and he KNOWS that my extreme postpartum anxiety and depression would have me up all night, every night staring at the monitor because I can’t stop myself. The first time either of my babies slept a slightly longer than normal stretch at night (think 3 and a half hours instead of 3), he found me sitting outside the nursery door trying to hear them breathe without going in to wake them up. So yeah, no owlet for me...."

BabyBumps,feiwcun,t3_epbdbm,1579149008.0,"You DO love your dogs. Love is doing what is right and necessary by another person even when you don’t feel any affection toward them. It is normal to have seasons of this with your dogs, your SO, and even your children. Pregnancy also temporarily rewires your brain to value different traits in people (women tend to like men who are more nurturing and less overtly masculine during their pregnancies) and you might be seeing that in how you feel about your dogs right now. Pregnancy is horrible and I don’t understand (I just envy) the women who looooooove it. But the baby is SO WORTH IT."

My “foodie” friends and family are actually the skinniest because they are in search of high quality, sometimes terrifyingly expensive food experiences that are really small. I have another circle of friends where every get together is like Super Bowl Sunday. Piles of good old American junk food that taste good but aren’t special, and enormous quantities. Both groups are super fun people though."

loseit,fczp4sd,t3_ejl0k5,1578106097.0,"Okay so this is going to sound weird but bear with me. I’m an opera singer and something I notice is that when a chorus of singers is hanging out, the fat singers and the skinny singers don’t end up at the same table. And it’s not because of any intended prejudice but because the lifestyles that lead to those different body types are so wildly different that, while we all sit around and talk about opera just fine, we don’t share similar hobbies and tastes. A lot of the skinny girls don’t bond over food because they just... don’t. It’s not intentional snubbing, it’s just not an instinct to them. And a lot of the fat singers do bond over food and drinking, as their main form of bonding. It’s hard to come together when your basic bonding techniques are so different. If anybody is wondering where I am, it’s in the corner with a book because I have no bonding techniques and am horrifically awkward with everybody. Each group probably develops prejudices against the other as a result of this divide but it honestly starts as different lifestyles leading to different forms of interaction. I hope you can find friends who are willing to bond in your way that is healthy and not feel undermined by your choices, but it is going to be worth the effort to make that new group of friends."
