Why do they even exist?? Not even pineapples look like they enjoy life, they have thorny skin and even the fucking leaves have thorns what's the fucking point in that

The juice is alright but to actually get that you need to cut it and that's a fucking hassle since you have to cut it just right to get the most out of it because it knows nobody wants it so it full of its shitty seeds.

Pineapples can go fucking die for all I care"

Just never give up because then anyone who's ever doubted you was right and fuck that noise"

The protagonist was an android who I think was called Prometheus or something similar and he could shapeshift into different people or objects
There was also an old scientist who repaired him. 

If someone knows PLEASE let me know the name of it, I've been looking for it for like 10 years"
