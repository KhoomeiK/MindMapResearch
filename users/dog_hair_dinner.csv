I had something similar happen to me as a child and I don't know if I'll ever get over the gut-response of sheer terror whenever a man raises his voice.  when you're a kid, you are so unsure of the world and your life is literally in the hands of whoever is caring for you.  to have nobody there to help you and just have to endure that....it's terrifying.  and these things happen behind closed doors, where nobody can see and stop what is happening.  on top of that, he can't even tell anyone.

I'm so happy this kid has his mom checking on him so this doesn't continue to happen.  He has her support and they're going to deal with that together.  Having a parent support you can really turn the tides in help you going from completely traumatized to actually being able to process it in a healthy manner.

Raising an autistic kid is so hard.  I hope the mother has lots of support and less ""friends"" like this guy.  Some people can be so nice and level-headed.  Then they experience something difficult and you find a really ugly person underneath that you never saw before.  

My little brother is autistic.  The amount of people that would condone treating a child like this and attempted to shame my mom into doing so is disgusting.  Everywhere we went, comments about smacking the child and other abuse were made.  Older women would often approach my mom and give her a ""talking to"" about her ""misbehaved child"".  It was hard to be in public.  

And my poor brother, being treated like a bad kid when he was doing stuff he literally could not control....it makes me so mad.  I give my brother all the support I can, but I can't take away the isolation and anger he feels because of people who mistreat him."

You can look into orthopedic dog mats or beds, but they can get pricey.  worse comes to worse, you can buy a sliver of the same carpet and put it on the floor outside lol.

Ultimately I wish we could figure out why he is whining and pacing.  I have a shepherd mix and she will whine and pace when:
- she is itchy (I need to give her a bath)
- her ears need cleaning
- her hips are hurting her (she has arthritis, now I give her Metacam and she's stopped pacing at night)
- has to go to the bathroom
- is hungry
- is having bowel issues (diarrhea)

If the dog hasn't been assessed for arthritis, push the rescue to get it done.  I'd be really surprised if a shepherd at that age doesn't have arthritis.  

If the rescue can't afford it, I'd be more than happy to donate to cover his vet visit and Metacam (with blood tests) if they prescribe it.  They'd just have to send me the estimate.  Then I'd pay the vet hospital directly, ideally.

Feel free to keep me posted about his progress if you need my help brainstorming."

ottawa,fempoi8,t1_felhg5i,1579265890.0,"> At 12 years old, I told one of my teachers over lunch recess. When the bell rang at the end of the day, I was called to the principal's office where a police officer was waiting for me. I stayed at the school until 7pm giving statements. My Dad picked me up, and my life was forever changed. Neither of them ever touched me again 

Man, this brought me to tears.  I still remember when my mom got my sister and I away from my father, who was abusing us.  My dad freaked out when we were taken away and stalked us.  My school was alerted that he was not to have any contact with us.  We moved out just east of Vanier and went to a school where there was a lot of problems with drugs, gangs, crime, inter-ethnicity violence, and poverty, but the housing was affordable for my mom, who had a job that was paying a little over minimum wage.

The school had this big, super-tall teacher / guidance councilor.  The school must have known what they were doing when they hired that guy.  He was a bodyguard for the students.  He looked like he'd seen some shit.  It wasn't just his size that was intimidating.   
 It was his posture and he had that look in his eye that he would do anything to protect the kids.  If you needed help with ANYTHING, you went to that guy.

I remember seeing him at the entrance to the school a few times, yelling at adults to leave the premises saying things like, ""No, you can't see him.  You're not supposed to be here.  Get out of here.""  Apparently I wasn't the only student who had a parent trying to pick them up that wasn't allowed to.

One day, I had forgotten my homework at home.  My mom had married another another man.  I asked him if he could come bring my homework to school for me.  God, I feel so bad, but it was kind of funny looking back at it now.  The big dude had my step-dad in the main office and wouldn't let him leave or come see me.  He calls me out of class and he's like, ""Now I have a man here saying he has homework for you.  He says he's your dad.  Now, you're OK.  You're safe.  There's a little bit of glass just over here where you can go take a look.  Just let me know if it's him.  He says you called him.""

I'm super-confused, because I know I called my step-dad, but I referred to him by his first name, never my dad. So I'm scared that maybe my dad attacked my step-dad in on his way to the school or something.  My dad was super-crazy and would park his car just outside of the school area and just walk around all day, so it was a possibility.

I peek through the glass and it's my step-dad.  I start laughing, because I'm thinking of my poor, innocent step-dad that's not like us.  He's never experienced abuse or anything scary in the world.  And here he is being treated like a criminal, not allowed to leave the office.  Apparently they threatened to call the cops, then he said he's my step-dad, so they wanted me to verify that.  For reference, my step dad looks kind of similar to my real dad.  They're the same height, skin colour, hair colour, and around the same age.

I tell the councilor everything's fine and he's my step-dad.  I called him to bring me my homework I forgot.  The councilor gets me to focus on him and make sure that I'm sure.  The councilor doesn't stop watching us until I accept my homework, say goodbye and thank you to my step-dad and go back to class.

For the first time in my life, I actually felt safe.  For so long, it felt like nobody understood what it was like at my home.  Nobody believed us or ever asked us what was going on at home.  I was treated like a liar just trying to get attention.  And here was this huge guy who actually gave a shit and knew the threat was real.  He actually treated me seriously and made me feel, for the first time, that the adult was going to handle things, and I could just relax and be a kid.

Unlike you, I can't say that my abuse ended there, but this is one of the memories I have that keeps me going.  That there are people out there that actually care about protecting children.

In my 20s, I started dealing with everything that had happened.  I got suicidal.  I called Ottawa's mental health crisis line.  The woman on the phone didn't really understand what I was going through, but she genuinely empathized with my pain.  Just being on the phone with someone who cared got me through that day.  She gave me the resources I needed to move forward.

I am so glad that things are changing now for kids.  That society isn't turning a blind eye so much to child abuse and mental health challenges.  We are so, so far from being where we should be, as a society, but I am still happy for kids today for the resources and awareness that are being brought to them."

The behaviourist will give you a full training / action plan for life on how to resolve your dog's issues and how to keep him and other dogs safe in different situations.

When it comes to the severity of the injuries on the smaller dog, I wouldn't mess around with going to see any trainers or doing any trial and error yourself.  Just go straight to the expert (the behaviourist) and get it all done right the first time.

Any local veterinarians can help you find available behaviourists.  There are people who claim to be behaviourists, but are not, so the local vets are a good resource to ask for references.

People often fail to realize that dogs are still animals.  Dogs killing each other is nothing new to dogs.  Dogs have emotions like us and they can snap.

It's kind of like wolves killing each other over territory and just labeling those two wolves in particular as dangerous.  They're all capable of the same thing.

So don't feel like there's something wrong with your dog and that he's a monster.  He's just a dog doing dog things.  To us, those things are horrific.  To the dog, he was solving a problem the only way he knew how.

you're dealing with the dog mind, which is still not fully understood

so it is unreasonable to expect that you would be able to quickly diagnose and resolve this complex mental/emotional behaviour.

have confidence that you are doing your personal best with the tools and resources that you have.  you should also be proud that you've been able to try pushing your own personal boundaries for the selfless reason of trying to do what is best for him too.

>  I don't know how long I should be trying with him

There are a few things to consider here.  The longer he stays with you, the harder it is for him to change environments.  As time passes, the foster home becomes more familiar and comfortable.  That causes some stress when he changes environments.  If the change is directly to a permanent home, that is ideal. But if he is with you long enough to really feel ""at home"", then he's got to go to another foster and maybe even another, that's the situation that can cause dogs to have more issues finally settling into their forever home.

Feeling like you are ""over your head"" can be a good indication that the foster is not a good fit.  You may be prepared for a case like this later down the road, but more foster experience with different, simpler cases may be what you need to get you to a place where you feel confident and capable to handle a more complex case.  

He's a good dog, capable of learning.  He'll do well adapting to another foster.  If you return him, you can always contact the organization and keep tabs.  If he gets REALLY stuck then maybe you want to consider being his 'last resort'.

I had a personal experience with an extreme foster case, but it was my first foster.  Long story short, I should have returned him to the rescue, fully documenting the issues I had.  I was in no position, with my limited experience, to try to handle that case.  In the end, I helped him out greatly, but it probably took more time than it should have and put me through a great deal of stress that was not necessary.  After I returned the dog, his behaviour changed dramatically for the better in a different home.

Dogs can sense resentment and start self-soothing behaviours.  Barking is a common self-soothing behaviour.

People like to think they are in control of their emotions, but we aren't always.  It takes work to learn about yourself and get better control, but it's never 100%.  Then add sleep deprivation to the mix and you've got chaos.  You can give it a shot with trying to only be positive and up-beat with him and see if you can resolve it.

Since the rescue has said that he hasn't had this issue before, that could be an indicator that it's your emotions he's reacting to.  They could be lying too, because some rescues do that.

You could have a chat with the rescue and see what his outlook is for a different foster home and make a choice from there."

Dogs being tempted to overtake a dog they see as vulnerable (restrained on leash while they are not) is a natural impulse.  However, there are A LOT of people who believe that they should just ""let dogs be dogs"", so therefore it's the responsibility of the leashed dog owner to make sure they don't bring their leashed dog to an off-leash area.  It's an easier answer for them than them actually putting in work to train impulse control and obedience in a high-stimulation environment like a dog park.  So they just yell/shame/intimidate everyone else into submission. Teaching impulse and emotional control to a dog takes a lot of patience, consistency, and focus, and time for the owner.

Keep doing what you're doing if it's working out for you.  If you and your dog are fine, keep on keepin on.  

Dogs tend to get stressed when they are on a leash and other dogs are not, then approach them.  The leashed dog feels that if they need to run, they cannot and can then be more defensive when interacting.

However, if you handle your dog well and supervise all interactions, including stopping interactions that you don't feel are healthy and preventing the un-leashed dog from getting access to yours, the dog will have confidence that you handle everything and he/she won't feel the need to run, reducing stress.  In an off-leash dog park, owners are expected to have their dogs under control at all times.  If they can't recall their dog off of yours, that's their problem, not yours. 

An option you may like to try is to keep your dog leashed, but have a tie-out leash attached or just have a long leash.  Then when doggie wants to play with another one, give him enough slack so there is no tension on his neck.

The only time that you can't have a dog leashed at a dog park is if the park rules specifically state (signage) that all dogs must be off leash.  I'm not sure if any of those exist in Ottawa.  Not that I've seen.

Some people tend to have issues with their dogs preying on other dogs that have leashes on.  Some dogs are tempted to take advantage of other dogs on leashes, because they seem them as weakened.  It's up to the dog owner with the off-leash dog to have enough control over his dog to stop their dog from doing this.  It's not your responsibility.

Everyone needs to share the dog park and be responsible for their own pets.  It would be cool if we'd all just not push our dog training beliefs on other owners or at least be polite about it.  Scowling and rude comments is passive aggressive and not productive.  It just makes the scowler or complainer feel better about themselves without doing anything that requires any actual effort and politeness."

dogs,fegi3fn,t1_fedzlfu,1579093460.0,"> Sleep deprivation is horror.

I know all too well. That was one of my biggest ""breakthroughs"" / tough lessons / major hurdles that I had to learn about when it came to anything professional, personal, or with my fostering.  I was setting myself back more than anything by sacrificing sleep.  Everything went so much better if I could think clearly after getting enough sleep.  Going sleep deprived caused more problems than it solved.  I've seen other fosters / new adopters suffer the same mistake, so I always try to convince them that even if they have to shut the door (not enough in your case) to ignore whining and pacing to get some sleep while they work on solving the issue, it will be worth it. 

Also, a dog can tell when your mood is off.  That stresses them out more and can cause more issues.  They are so sensitive to the way that we conduct ourselves.  It's a great way to open doors of communication, but also can be a hinderance if we're not doing well mentally.

Incoming advice novel:

As for diarrhea, you can put him on plain rice for 24 hours.  That should stop the diarrhea right away.  Feed him the same volume of rice that you would his kibble.  After 24 hours, start introducing small amounts of lean ground meat.  Chicken, turkey or beef are best. A lot of dogs can have issues with pork on a sensitive stomach.  Start with 1tbsp at the first meal, then work your way up per meal until he's eating a good mix of meat and rice.  Then slowly start replacing the meat part with bits of kibble.  Within 5-7 days, he should be tolerating his kibble again without diarrhea.  If not, you'd have to consult with his vet.

As for the poop accidents, you have a few options to avoid cleaning carpets.  There is crating (cleaning the crate), but if he's got anxiety about that, he'll make too much noise and keep you up.  
I had this one foster that just peed and pood everywhere and I was really tired of scrubbing all the crate crevices.  So I went to the hardware store and got a bendy plastic fence material.  I made a circular fence and placed down garbage bags (to prevent liquids from escaping) in the fenced area, then newspaper on top (to absorb liquids).  When I couldn't supervise the foster (in your case, this would be night time), instead of crating, I put the dog in his fenced area.  Then I could just pick up and toss out the garbage bag and newspaper.  Much easier than cleaning.  The trick is to have a big enough fenced area so that if the dog does mess himself, he has room to avoid it.

Another option is diapering, but for this you will have more dog cleanup to do, because the poop will be in contact with his fur.  There are some great sellers on etsy and ebay that make super cheap, great quality diapers.  You just buy like 3 or 4 and keep throwing them in the wash when they are soiled, then put a fresh one on the dog.

For cleaning pee and poo, get a good enzymatic cleaner.  I've been using Nature's Miracle for 10 years and it's never let me down.  You soak the mess in the cleaner for 10 minutes, then you scrub it out with a wet rag.  The cleaner breaks down pee and poo, so there is so much less scrubbing.  And I've found it gets the stain out completely.  For hard surfaces, water, vinegar and a little bit of soap works, but the smell is less pleasant, because of the vinegar.  But it's an affordable option.

With fostering, you'll get lucky and get easy dogs sometimes, but then sometimes you get the nightmares.  A 13 year old dog is normally going to be a lot of work.  Animals do not handle stress as well in their old age, which has repercussions for their body and mind.  

Some stuff to think about: fostering is hard, dirty work.  It's not for everyone and that is totally OK.  If fostering is burning you out and giving you troubles in your life, that's not good.  You're not the one who got the dogs in this mess and it's not your responsibility to fix it.  It's a good, responsible decision to take a good look at yourself and your life and make the right decision for both yourself and the animals, whether that's to stop fostering or not.

Also, there are plenty of dogs out there that could be easier to foster that you can help.  Or cats.  Or rabbits, etc.  I'm not sure what the organization is like that you volunteer for, but if the organization has other volunteers, you could ask to have this dog go to another foster and ask for a different dog.  If the organization is smart, they'll find the best fit for a foster and not give you a hard time.  Sometimes even a fostering situation is hard and a good organization will make sure they have the resources to handle that situation and not just dump dogs on you.  At 13 years of age, if you don't think you can make him happy, and someone else might have a shot, it might be a good idea to try that.  He doesn't have much time left, so living his best life for that time would be best for him. 

For the stress, I find it is significantly reduced if I can bond with the animal.  If I feel genuine love for the animal, I feel good about doing all the hard stuff, instead of feeling sadness/resentment/etc.  Find something that you and the foster can do together, even if it's just for 15 minutes a day.  Maybe teach him something. 

Two of my adopted dogs were neglect cases.  One was chained, like your foster.  The other was let to run free in a bush.  Neither knew what dog toys were or what to do with them.  I taught the forest dog fetch and tug of war.  She discovered on her own that she loves chewing on the fetch ball.  The previously chained one, the only thing I've been able to teach him is recall (he LOVES running to me for some reason).  I'm still working on desensitizing his mouth.  He's got a lot of anxiety about it, but we're making good progress.  For me, it is an indescribable feeling that I knew I could bring joy to their lives.  That I accomplished teaching them those things.  

Then some dogs are too stressed out for even that, so you can just sit next to them and read or talk quietly on the phone.  Just having that quiet, alone time can help too.

Let me know if you try some stuff and it doesn't work out or you have other questions.  I'll try to help."

> partly because I have nice carpets in my room

is he going to permanently damage them somehow?  I'm honestly asking to see if we can problem solve.  I was poor growing up, so I never had any property I cared about.  Now that I'm an adult with means, I still don't care about objects.  And I've given up having objects that I know the dogs are going to destroy.  So I don't know if there are things that can't be cleaned/repaired.  However, my mom is a professional cleaner, so if you need help with anything like that, I can ask her.

>partly because he farts a lot

I get that.  But once you're passed out, you won't smell it ;) 

> But mostly because I don't want to set a precedent. If I let him in there to sleep, what's the guarantee that I can lock him out later on when I need my privacy?

one problem at a time :)  Priority #1 should be getting proper sleep.  You're not going to be able to maintain good patience and problem solving with persistent sleep deprivation.  It's in both your best interest and the interest of your foster that you get some proper sleep, so that you are best prepared to work on his issues."
