""On the morning of 27 February 2002, the Sabarmati Express, returning from Ayodhya to Ahmedabad, stopped near the Godhra railway station. The passengers were Hindu pilgrims, returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.[37][38] An argument erupted between the train passengers and the vendors on the railway platform.[39] The argument became violent and under uncertain circumstances four coaches of the train caught fire with many people trapped inside. In the resulting conflagration, fifty-nine people (nine men, twenty-five women, and twenty-five children) burned to death.[40]""

 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Gujarat_riots

But that shouldn't mean we Hindus should have done what happened but police in India is weak and they also didn't do anything to stop those rioters so it's all bad at that time. But Thankfully no riots have happened in Gujarat since 2002"
