todayilearned,feyd9q0,t1_feyavxr,1579444047.0,"No complaints. Most people don't understand the bigger issue that drove blockbuster into the ground was how Hollywood totally fucked the company on the cost of VHS tapes. 

New releases cost Blockbuster $100 per VHS tape so they tried to make that money up somewhere. When DVDs came out, they only cost them $20 so they could have lessened late fees, but they didn't in their arrogance and it Cost them eventually.

The company was ran terribly and good riddance."

I was the assistant manager with the great purge in Oklahoma. They were finding a reason to fire all the store managers within one month. Our store was run really well so they found the most trivial thing to fire my manager over.

Myself and the other assistant manager had already put in our notices because we're we're both moving away. I have no idea what happened to that store after we moved on."
