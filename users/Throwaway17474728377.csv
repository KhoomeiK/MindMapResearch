witcher,ffdnv2o,t1_ffdnu82,1579824860.0,Enjoy!
Stronglifts5x5,ffdmxfh,t1_ffdexz3,1579824296.0,Possibly. He does trained Romanian deadlifts so there‚Äôs a good chance his standard deadlift weight is solid given his size and the fact he‚Äôs a juicy boy. Nothing on Geralt of course but still.
offmychest,ffdmsao,t3_et1ljc,1579824208.0,Minimise contact. Have a life. Surround yourself with other people. Basically just spend time doing your own thing. Abandon hope of being together. It won‚Äôt happen. In time you‚Äôll find someone who feels the same way and trust me it will be way better. This will become a memory.
offmychest,ffdmfrs,t3_et1w1p,1579823998.0,Might be an unpopular opinion but sounds like she got what she deserved. If you get warned and then decide to pull a knife on someone you deserve to get laid out. Man or woman. Sounds like a nutcase.
witcher,ffdgauk,t1_ffdfmil,1579820262.0,"And I‚Äôm pointing out it‚Äôs wrong. If you visit the emperor. Refuse the money. Win the war for Nilfgaard and have Ciri live she doesn‚Äôt become a Witcher. It said ‚Äúthen she‚Äôll become a Witcher if she comes back.‚Äù That statement is false. Nowhere did it say that it ‚Äúputs her on the path.‚Äù It says in black and white. ‚ÄúIf not taken, then she‚Äôll become a Witcher if she comes back.‚Äù She only becomes a Witcher if you refuse money and have her survive if you ensure Nilfgaard loses the war."
Stronglifts5x5,ffdet6l,t1_ffdek5h,1579819371.0,Yeah I get that. For me especially if I can imagine the scene that song plays in too. Shame Geralt never deadlifted in the Witcher. Season 2 maybe? Besides your deadlift is pretty solid. Most of the population can‚Äôt even deadlift 200 pounds. The bar is pretty low but still. Maybe if they picked the bar up once in a while it would be higher.
witcher,ffdecy9,t1_ffc6b9k,1579819102.0,"Lambert Lambert what a prick. 

Geralt has such a way with words."
offmychest,ffddyw2,t3_esr353,1579818869.0,Don‚Äôt want to be a downer but if she‚Äôs getting better please take her back to the Vet. It‚Äôs a good sign if she is better but there could be some complications that a vet may be able to assist with.
Stronglifts5x5,ffdcn1y,t3_epsdgp,1579818054.0,Don‚Äôt care about the lift. I love that you work out to Toss A Coin To Your Witcher. Did back and shoulders the other day listening to it on loop.
witcher,ffdc5nm,t1_ffcxxgm,1579817747.0,You didn‚Äôt miss it. It‚Äôs a side quest that will trigger when you finish both the main game and Blood and Wine. Go back and finish the game to the final ending. Then return to your villa.
witcher,ffdc0f2,t1_ffd1wly,1579817653.0,On the Ciri bit that‚Äôs not true. She can still become Empress if you refuse money.
nattyorjuice,ffdbrc4,t1_ffct4g3,1579817489.0,Nah bro. I dumped my girlfriend and after 2 days of no sex I was suddenly Ronnie Coleman. #AllNatural #StayHumble
nattyorjuice,ffan085,t1_ff9q948,1579739766.0,Fairly sure Baldur actually did damage though.
witcher,ff900nb,t3_es9n3i,1579701342.0,The White Orchard Nilfgaard outpost is so damn nice.

offmychest,ff8w5al,t1_ff8hq2m,1579698078.0,Uhhhh what? No. Doesn‚Äôt suddenly mean you own the person.
R6ProLeague,ff7cmfg,t3_eryjrz,1579646440.0,Poor Goga is only the second best Goga.
shittyrainbow6,ff3wp09,t3_ercsn0,1579550495.0,Hey... I get results alright. It‚Äôs honest work.
nattyorjuice,ff3wlt0,t1_ff3jer9,1579550439.0,My 14 year old brother has stretch marks on his arms from 2 months of casual lifting/puberty. They don‚Äôt mean anything my dude. Most people I know have them
Fitness,ff1bxt2,t1_ff1bcv5,1579477308.0,I don‚Äôt know how the fuck he did that. I tried to do one and I couldn‚Äôt even get it into position without help.
Fitness,ff1afgk,t1_ff1a76s,1579476847.0,Does being a farmer make a huge difference then? I always figured he was strong at what he did but it wouldn‚Äôt translate over to weight work. I guess that was pretty dumb of me.
nattyorjuice,ff0u71e,t1_ff0sgkn,1579472361.0,If we‚Äôre being technical he‚Äôs about 165. He actually had to put on weight to make weight rather than the norm of dropping.
nattyorjuice,femu1ye,t1_fekt5uu,1579269594.0,Fuckkkk. I wish I knew this years ago.
gaming,feh0dtr,t1_fegwa9b,1579106504.0,I think they‚Äôre referring to the Skellige shipwreck but that‚Äôs made me think. Damn Geralt just needs to stay off ships.
skulduggerypleasant,fegzsl1,t1_fegximx,1579106148.0,The first part is painfully true. I mind my own business and I get tiny dude trying to start stuff to look like hot shit in front of their girlfriends. It‚Äôs really annoying. Especially if I‚Äôm with people.
nattyorjuice,feg50f2,t3_eozmup,1579077201.0,Nahhhh he‚Äôs totally natural. I bet he doesn‚Äôt even work out.
witcher,fedyv62,t3_eomg2h,1579022790.0,I killed him on my latest playthrough. I just didn‚Äôt want to get the paint as I‚Äôm going for another plat trophy run and I‚Äôm lazy.
witcher,fedym2i,t1_fedlelx,1579022640.0,HIM... HIM!!! SEXIST!!!! She is a her! I have never been so offended. Excuse me while I go off and cry in my safe space in front of a photo of Obama.
nattyorjuice,fedyg7w,t1_fedfsam,1579022541.0,He probably doesn‚Äôt even lift. Just good genetics. Obviously.
unpopularopinion,fedoyx5,t1_fedonjm,1579016739.0,Fair enough. I don‚Äôt agree but I see where you‚Äôre coming from. Definitely agree with you about TFA. Honestly Star Wars Peaked with the Clone Wars and then fell off when they first cancelled it. This new trilogy is so mehh and the last one was only good in the last parts of the third film. Can‚Äôt wait for the next trilogy where it turns out Darth Vader just needed a recharge and he‚Äôs happily living out his days with his Toydarian wife and Wookie mistress until one day the evil Disney come along with their original ideas and come up with a... Another super weapon spacestation... never mind.
unpopularopinion,fedobci,t1_fedo5vz,1579016324.0,Wasn‚Äôt as good as the Dark Knight true. Weird cuts and lack of co ordination made it weird to follow at times. Wouldn‚Äôt say it was garbage though it‚Äôs still a decent movie if films like that are your kinda thing.
unpopularopinion,fedo89c,t1_fedo3g7,1579016269.0,That scene was great. Still not sure how Bane killed him. Looked like he face hugged/tickled him to death.
gameswap,fedo26p,t3_eogynt,1579016162.0,I have a spare PS account with a digital copy of fallout 4. It‚Äôs never used so you could have it for free honestly
unpopularopinion,fednelp,t1_fednbo8,1579015743.0,This is r/unpopularopinion. Not expecting people to agree. Course instead I get downvotedüòÇ
nattyorjuice,fedmyli,t1_fedirfy,1579015453.0,Try six hours. I tried this miracle ab workout from www.scam4abs.com and I became the Rock in just 10 minutes. Doctors everywhere are shocked by my transformation! Click here to see my dramatic change!
unpopularopinion,fedmthb,t1_fedmori,1579015360.0,For you...
unpopularopinion,fedmn3d,t1_fedmira,1579015241.0,"I was born with this opinion. Moulded by it. I didn‚Äôt see the Dark Knight until I was already a man and by then it was nothing to me but... Blinding!!!


Oh wait my TV brightness was just too high. My bad."
nattyorjuice,feczcpj,t3_eoim0n,1578990983.0,He‚Äôs not that big and just has decently defined abs when flexing. If this is juicy then I don‚Äôt know anymore.
Rainbow6,fecvlfk,t1_feb5fps,1578986366.0,4 month seasons maybe? God I hope not.
witcher,fecvhkt,t1_febtbf8,1578986249.0,You don‚Äôt need to fight the Bandits you can choose to leave them. Also you can just ride off instead of fighting the giant.
witcher,fe8mf77,t3_enxn0z,1578927909.0,Get those numbers up. Thems are rookie numbers.
nattyorjuice,fe8ldvx,t1_fe4hu66,1578927501.0,I bet ‚Äúyou‚Äôre‚Äù fun at spelling bees.
offmychest,fe1bxz6,t3_enknog,1578824782.0,You can wear what you like. Him following you around isn‚Äôt your fault. He‚Äôs a creep.
gaming,fdvbsho,t1_fdus773,1578745795.0,If I can‚Äôt insert an entire orchestra into my PS5 I‚Äôm not buying it.
nattyorjuice,fdofvl2,t1_fdo030y,1578604312.0,That‚Äôs the kinda cut I want.
GodofWar,fdg0fnw,t1_fdg0ccj,1578375546.0,Gud git.
GodofWar,fdg0eo0,t1_fdg0bfq,1578375521.0,Nah. I called this account throwaway but I ended up using it as my main account. Not bait. Also not scared of ‚Äúbacklash‚Äù Oh no I might lose a few numbers on a screen that mean nothing. Go ahead and downvote me.
GodofWar,fdg0a2a,t1_fdg07kt,1578375403.0,I killed her first time. My issue is the awful design behind the fight. It honestly lowered my opinion of the game a lot. She spends 90% of her time in the air and every attack I threw I got tackled.
nattyorjuice,fdg0004,t1_fdfpvl1,1578375141.0,That‚Äôs him. He‚Äôs admitted to taking gear. I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs trying to pull by posting himself claiming to be natty and not him. Pretty sad.
nattyorjuice,fdfztj1,t3_el4s3g,1578374977.0,"First off. Quit pretending this isn‚Äôt you. Your last post shows the same guy and you say it‚Äôs you. Secondly you‚Äôre 5,5. You aren‚Äôt the biggest thing in anything. You also said you take gear so quit lying. Did you stand on a stool to take that  photo? It honestly looks like you did."
nattyorjuice,fdfzk8a,t1_fdft2rd,1578374742.0,Disgusting... How could he.
MonsterHunterWorld,fdfz2ff,t1_fdfij44,1578374296.0,You‚Äôre talking to a bot.
nattyorjuice,fdd4xgq,t1_fdd4d34,1578294962.0,Naturally... Oh wait.
nattyorjuice,fcveur8,t1_fcvd3ji,1578000626.0,You said (little over half that) when talking about 300 pounds. Last I checked 30 pounds of lean mass is not little. So sorry I hurt your little feelings buddy. It‚Äôs okay I‚Äôm sure you can bench press my house while doing my mom or something I‚Äôm very intimated. You are truly the alpha male of alpha males while I just am a sad little breathing mouth hoping for food.
nattyorjuice,fcuwwv5,t3_eio8y6,1577990173.0,Pretty clearly natural. He just grew up. Unless he started lifting like 6 months ago.
nattyorjuice,fcuwi17,t1_fcuuyeh,1577989948.0,Congrats. You sent a link saying Cavill took roids. Something that we knew. He‚Äôs clearly not fat probably around 12-15% body fat and the guy is built which takes way more work than only being 150LB after a cutüòÇBut congrats. You weigh as much as my 14 year old brother.
witcher,fcp8qmx,t3_ei5dfo,1577854274.0,I tried it. Was one second early. Fuck...

offmychest,fcldavv,t3_ehs32p,1577745153.0,Whatever they say they are you have a right to be attracted or not attracted to them. You were raped. The fact the you said you couldn‚Äôt say no proves that. Saying no should always be an option. I‚Äôm so sorry you went through this. You‚Äôre absolutely not transphobic you‚Äôre a lesbian and attracted to women. Not people with male bodies. That‚Äôs fine and anyone who tries to guilt you into thinking otherwise is absolutely wrong.
GodofWar,fcl083a,t1_fckk7oy,1577736980.0,I play plenty of RPGs. I just don‚Äôt enjoy staring at uninspired puzzles again and again. It‚Äôs my main issue with the game. I like the game. It‚Äôs for me I just don‚Äôt like that one part of it.
GodofWar,fckyha7,t1_fckxri1,1577735904.0,Kratos took Captain America‚Äôs quote seriously. He quite literally walks off Death whenever he dies in the original games. He‚Äôll be fine.
GodofWar,fci2jxy,t1_fci2hvo,1577656982.0,Oh God... Of War
GodofWar,fci0wio,t1_fchydb9,1577656435.0,You were right. Thanks for talking me into continuing. It got a lot better :)
GodofWar,fchtdaj,t1_fchspie,1577653896.0,3-5 later depending on pace I think. I‚Äôd say stick with it. The puzzles are easy but tedious so I just use google to skip them. I really wasn‚Äôt enjoying it but I‚Äôve finally started getting some of the cool perks and skills and it makes it so much cooler.
witcher,fc1dj90,t1_fc1dfni,1577315531.0,Clearly you are missing the point. I didn‚Äôt mention the books nor did I act like the only fan. You claim to have got both the book and the game as a Christmas present. Then you say you had the game already and got the DLC for Christmas. That‚Äôs not possible. The DLC is included with the switch version of the game.
witcher,fc1d56m,t1_fc1d0x5,1577315199.0,The DLC comes with the Witcher for the switch. It‚Äôs not an optional extra. Quit lying.
witcher,fc1bxjp,t1_fc15pft,1577314174.0,It sucks.... That they didn‚Äôt make a third expansion pack.
witcher,fc1boo9,t1_fc1bl0e,1577313962.0,He said he got them both for Christmas. Even if he‚Äôs an experienced player he couldn‚Äôt have gotten to the final DLC mission in a few hours. I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre defending the guy he‚Äôs clearly just made this post for upvotes without putting much thought into it.
witcher,fc1bgqq,t1_fc1avr1,1577313777.0,I do. However there‚Äôs no way he got to the second to last mission in the main DLC in a few hours. Also why would a new player who just got the game skip the main game and go straight to the DLC.
witcher,fc13p1s,t1_fc0li7b,1577307362.0,Patience.
witcher,fc13oc3,t3_efgzry,1577307348.0,You got it for Christmas yet you‚Äôre on one of the last missions for the final DLC? Mmmmm. Totally not fishing for upvotes.
Rainbow6,fc13dim,t1_fbzsdb3,1577307098.0,Warden is the best fragger in the game. You just need to channel your inner copper and you‚Äôll destroy everyone. I have a 3.0 kd with him and 800 odd kills. I just play like a fucking moron and probably 7-8 times outta 10 it pays off. It‚Äôs a warden thing I guess.
GodofWar,fc00mgb,t1_fbzvh10,1577272210.0,Spider-Man PS4 is absolutely repetitive. My guess is either GOW isn‚Äôt my kinda game or I need to stick it out more. I appreciate the response. Merry Christmas!
