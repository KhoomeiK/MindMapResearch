Does anyone know how to correct this? Is there a specific jean brand with better options? Am I just going to have to suck it up and go to a tailor?"

I personally think it's good for a man's confidence and self esteem to dress up every once and awhile and put an effort into his appearance.

My bun is about 10 months old now.
