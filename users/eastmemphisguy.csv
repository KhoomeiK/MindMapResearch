On any line, you're going to get more party people headed to the Caribbean, as opposed to going to Canada, for example, both of which you can do from New York. It's probably true that Carnival, on average, has more of a party atmosphere than Norwegian, but, with the exception of Norwegian's super fancy and expensive Haven suites, the differences are not as big as people like to suggest. Both lines' ships are likely to have lots of kids during the summer when school is out. Also, be mindful of what ships you are considering. The newer bigger ships have a lot more activities than the smaller ones."

I've been to all the big hub airports in the US, most many times, and my least favorite, by a lot, is Charlotte. It wasn't all that long ago that Charlotte wasn't a big city. The physical size of their airport reflects that.  However, Metro Charlotte's population is booming in the 21st century. Airline consolidation and growth in aviation passengers means that more and more people are going through fewer and fewer hubs. Thus, Charlotte airport is outrageously overcrowded. On top of that, it is always under construction because they are trying to catch up. Active terminals have no ceiling tiles, dry wall, or flooring. There are loose wires hanging absolutely everywhere. There are random holes patched with cardboard and duct tape. And always dense swarms of people trying to navigate it all.
