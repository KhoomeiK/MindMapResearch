You can hire an estate sales company to handle everything and they just take a portion of the sale. You can pick out what you want them to do, they can pick everything up and sort it, let you know the contents, you choose what to keep, then they have an appraiser set values and auction it off. If there is guns they will have it taken care of through an FFL dealer and out of respect for you and the deceased they will make sure a fair value is given. 

Buy backs are a set price and don't inform you that you are about to get 50 bucks for a 20k dollar gun."

The guns that end up bought back are usually either broken or historical. The one that happened in my town a few years ago I saw on TV some lever action rifles and revolvers that looked very old, not sure if they were truly antiques or just not cared for and a drop block rifle which I know was old as hell, but I am sure there are a lot of people who inherit historical guns and don't know what they have so they just take grandpa's old revolver to the buy back so they can help inflate numbers to make a point and then Paul Revere's musket gets melted into a brick. Hell I bought a beautiful Marlin 1893 for 50 dollars once because the person was living in a retirement home and the gun was kept in their cars trunk and just wanted to get rid of it. If I hadn't been chatting with them they would have just taken it to the next buy back and a 120 year old rifle would have been destroyed. 

Even if someone at the buy back knows what they have in their hands they can't save it. Once it's been bought it has to be destroyed. I wish they had appraisal personnel on hand to make sure people don't sell something actually worth keeping."

And then on top of that they have hundreds of ""private"" sewers that to this day probably still just dump in the closest stream, those private sewers can be servicing dozens of homes. 

The main reason they are even in existence is because the city grew too fast and early for them to have separate sewers. A hundred years ago they didn't have waste treatment and just sent everything into the wild as is, in the case of Chicago they kept making the waste discharge further out into the lake as the city waste grew then they built a plant to treat everything. They do a damn good job at treating as much as they can until the flow overwhelms the facility and they just have to open the gates and try again tomorrow.

It's all great that you only know rich people but middle class people aren't as financially set as all that. And that is who benifits from a tax break, super poor people don't pay taxes so why would they give 2 shits about a tax break? 

And again. If you want to die in a ditch then a population crash is fine. But unless those smelly poor people breed there's not going to be anyone to take care of you when you grow old. If those middle class people don't breed then there isn't going to be a stable economy to retire in. 

And the people who actually look around and decide if a child is financially feasible and can be swayed by a tax break is exactly who you want to have more kids. You know, the emotionally stable, financially intelligent ones.

The main reason most are against this in my opinion is using the money for another issue. In AZ the smoking rate dropped a huge amount at 2 more dollars a pack that their promised program didn't get funded and they just chucked the extra money into the general fund. If that happens in CO then suddenly we have a underfunded new program that will need a new tax to make up for it. And the cycle continues while politicians get paid more and big businesses get more tax breaks. 

If we tax something because we don't like it then use those taxes to get rid of the issue, not some feel good program that's completely unrelated."
Colorado,fee51q4,t1_fedz01a,1579026543.0,"Yes. The only other option is to cut retirement benefits and force people to retire later in life. Up to possibly making it impossible to retire. This would be by making the social security retirement age higher, eliminate the tax breaks on 401k and eliminate Medicare. 

If nobody is paying for those programs then they need to be cut. 

And you are forgetting the other part. If nobody is applying for jobs that keep the lights on and medical jobs then people who could afford to retire without the government assistance will have to pay a lot more for basic services to attract workers. Causing huge inflation issues making it even harder to retire plus increased work output from the workers that are around, probably by increasing basic work week from 40 to 50 or something before overtime kicks in. 

So  we need to breed em or import them, but we will need workers for people to retire. Or people will have to be forced to work more longer.

Already we are looking at birth rates not sustaining our population and the only increases are due to immigration. As the baby boomer generation dies off there's going to be a a decline. Further decline will cause an upset in tax revenues and employment. 

The baby boomers have the social security payments from gen x and y to keep them going and enough workers to keep the system working but if the population falls too rapidly gen X and later will not have social security nor infrastructure to keep them going through retirement (though with the government cutting future benifits to buy votes from the baby boomers it's likely there won't be much anyway).

I am not aware of you can buy these 2 pivot hinges, I was taught how to make one once, was told it was called a Norwegian gate but I am pretty sure that was just bullshit  to make it sound fancy, the post side is a piece of angle iron that you weld 2 bolt to then file the sides flat and at a angle, then copy the holes to the gate plate and use a compass to make the slots just wide enough to pass the flats down on the pins. Bit of file work to adjust and the hinge is made.

This is more of a fancy design, for smaller gates. It takes skill, precision, and time to make since you have to make the brackets perfectly and file the pins and slots to match up. But a large gate will wear out the rocker plate and then the slots aren't arching correctly and it stops working. With a j-bolt/eye bolt hinge off set like me and the other guy mentioned the bigger the gate the less you have to offset and lasts as long as the posts do. 

If you have money and want it to look good use the 2 pin rocker, if your broke and couldn't care less about it use the j-bolt."

The top pivot is 1"" from the gate and 2"" from the post, the bottom pivot is 2"" from the gate and 1"" from the post. At closed both top and bottom of the gate is 3 inches away from the post. But when you turn the gate 90 degrees the top pivot is 1 inch from the axis of rotation and the bottom is 2"" away, making the end of the gate go up.

If you don't have a monster sized air compressor running 36 CFM of air you can't use a pneumatic tamper, if you don't have a 15k kw generator you can't use an electric tamper, this thing just needs a can of gas and someone to hold it.

I am just explaining that everyone that even spoke with the guy didn't absolutely know what was going on. 

You think when he had 100 people in his penthouse they were all doing trains on teenaged girls? That people signed waivers saying they knew a 15 year old girl was being held captive in the master bedroom? It doesn't work like that. He would have only told close people he thought he could trust about the shady stuff. 

Murderers don't walk around with their victims corpses nor hide from society. Drug dealers at parties don't wear neon signs. Pedophile ring leaders sure as hell don't tell customs that he landed in Paris to find underaged girls to kidnap. They need a cover, what better cover than a bunch of millionaires and celebrities on a world wide party trip? Not everyone would be privy to it, you just need them to dazzle the authorities. Anything more and he would risk losing his cover story when people refused to come along anymore at the least.

Trump did spend a lot of time with Epstein, probably did know at least he was commiting statutory rape, but he was in his 50s, that statement could have meant women in their 30s even, that would be 20 years younger. No way people can say that was obvious proof and the police should have swept in right then. Sure in hindsight we know what it meant but honestly if a 50 year old guy said that to me I would first picture a 20something, not a 15 year old. And that's why people were still going around him. If it was really open that Epstein was human trafficking all of those celebrities (especially all the women, I hope) would have stayed far away to protect their reputation."

And with parties that went on for days there's going to be hyperbole about how crazy the parties get (or so you think) then wham, you find out while you were enjoying a real party it was actually a cover for a pedo ring.

Prius is up to 58mpg in 2019 I think which is pretty good and frankly, I could see a diesel hybrid doing 100mpg but there's none yet in the wild, the biggest issue is diesel is a very dirty startup and trying to start/stop them is going to make it a very short lived engine. Even with gas the hybrids need a special catalytic converter that needs less warm up so it isn't damaged by the hybrid system. A diesel without a particulate filter would foul itself out pretty fast  and have black spot coming out of the tailpipe all the time, with EGR and a particulate filter would be going through Regen cycle constantly, wasting fuel."

UpliftingNews,fbys68j,t1_fbydsnv,1577224893.0,"Yes. As you have seen in Reddit at the least everyone has a social contract almost to inform each other of ""never carry your social security card"" ""memorize the number"". Guidance counselors in school, teachers, bankers, employers, any time SSN is brought up people jump in. If someone asks for the last 4 of your social and you say "" let me look"" they will say you should memorize it, if you pull out your card to apply at a job inevitable that someone will say you shouldn't carry it. We get advertising material about safety deposit boxes saying we need something to keep valuable paperwork and shows a card. 

You can't go a week without some mention of a SSN here. 

Seriously, do you have trouble remembering your phone number? Yet you do not call yourself ever, and you probably haven't had your current number for all that long. Imagine having the same phone number for your entire life. That's how a SSN is for Americans. We use it anywhere from weekly (last 4 for security verification) to at the very worse once a year ( for taxes) after the age of 16. It's impossible to forget the damn thing even if you wanted to. 

If you ask any American over 18 and probably half of 13-18 if they know their SSN by heart they will say of course. 

It's bad enough that when you choose a PIN they say no birthday and no SSN because it's so common that people who have trouble remembering PINs will choose it because it's that engrained into memory that it's right up there with remembering the day you were born."
