GamerPals,fetfe08,t1_fet0xce,1579374899.0,No one has paladins :( well I’m not complaining I don’t play it so much and I already have ppl to play with so it’s not a problem but goddammit it’s so difficult to find ppl for that game
GamerPals,fetexh4,t1_fesksbq,1579374741.0,The thing that gets me mad about this is that there are subreddits for that!!
GamerPals,fetei5a,t1_fetbdgg,1579374600.0,"I tought the same, It’s still
Difficult to find ppl having few games  but at least I can do something for the community"
depression,feg0wqx,t3_eoxun3,1579072202.0,"I really hope you can get better and keep the memories not as the worst period of your life, but an experience you had, I even fear to get better just because I fear I’ll lose my current self, but if there is a way to keep all the lessons I’m learning while being in this state of mind and keep them for my future self I would definitely work more to get better

So think about it, while you get better look at your past trying to find what you’ve learned, this way even if you change your old self will always be with you"
Needafriend,feeyko8,t3_eosnuh,1579044055.0,"I got isolated too, for another reason, being scared of saddening ppl, however everyone near me never understood that, and I tought it was because I was too good at hiding it... just recently I realised that indeed I may not be as bad as I think, I was able to make ppl happy and never really saddened them, but I have nowhere to start back on my life, it’s hard, and I have other issues and maybe I hope I can work in starting back and getting better with some online ppl since its  a little bit more easier here chat and know new ones"
depression,fed4ojm,t1_fed3vvs,1578998692.0,"There was a game, where everyone with the same score was labelled as the same position as the first one, and the one with lower ones had another label, so you are in the group of the 5 favourite person, you’re not the 5th, but the one under you probability it’s not the second but the 6th"
depression,fed4kub,t3_eofgoa,1578998541.0,"When I was... it didn’t change anything, I was just tiring and saddening the one who was praising me by not being able to accept those kind words, I mean I was not that bad, but definitely it’s not something that will change us, now that I don’t have someone that worries about me at least I know I’m not getting anyone sad, and this relieves me more than thinking “why the hell you are still trying to cheer this sad lad of myself” to “good morning”"
Needafriend,fe6u9x5,t3_eo1faq,1578905267.0,"I’m just the classic type of IT guy, that knows a little bit of very much but nothing in detail ahahah if you’re up to talk about some computers thing or so maybe I can help, I’m also quite random so like random topics/discussions or question challenges whatever I’m fine with it! If you ever feel like send a pm! Open to discord too as a better chat app but my spoken English is not so good"
MonsterGirl,fdjo8tp,t1_fdjo685,1578480554.0,Thank saviour!
ForeverAloneDating,fdgvfpw,t3_el3teu,1578409308.0,"Ok I’m honestly curious how’s possible you never got a serious date, if you ever want to talk about it I’ll be here,  I know this “dating” subreddit but I’m more just curious about your story and if I can be a friend good enough to help you figure this issue, maybe I hope to learn something  too because I’ve always been the type “if I was born a good looking girl instead of a standard looking guy I’m sure my life would’ve been better” 

Anyways  I don’t like to dm ppl if you’ll ever find this reply and want to chat just dm :)"
Needafriend,fd5j5ra,t3_ek2sqs,1578178168.0,Sending you a pm to try this out! 22/m here!
Needafriend,fd4xtkv,t3_ejyfsk,1578172165.0,"Peeing standing up is overrated, also needing at least a hand while peeing... this means no complex phone gaming!! And aside from that, every human need to take a shit, and there is no stand up shitting I know about... at least for now...

Anyway cheer up and shit in the face of those ppl, internet it’s sure full of weird one but they have no power, we are all only names written somewhere so you are free to ignore them and don’t mind what they think"
Needafriend,fc2dop0,t3_efp237,1577354150.0,"You got a lot of replies, I really hope you find the one you were searching for, but if you find yourself again in this situation, well I would love to read a text from you and chat with you, it’s in my username xD

Merry Christmas!!"
Needafriend,fbgkll2,t3_ed7n4k,1576852052.0,"22M from Italy, if you ever feel the need to talk to other boring ppl! But I’m sure we’ll find a way to keep the conversation up, I’m sure neither of us lack in imagination"
