TroyAlabama,fef7gkb,t3_eor338,1579049981.0,"I would assume the paddle rental is an actual paddle, I can't remember ever seeing any paddleboats there. I can't remember if the ""boating"" is fishing boats or canoes. They probably have both though honestly. There is also a VERY short walking trail you can take along the water's edge and the picnic tables. I think they also recently opened up archery."

Honestly though I like to play on the floor, and we used to do it quite often in our college dorm. Now not so much because we have an actual table plus I have two friendly and very clumsy dogs :)"
