pics,fd5b0vt,t1_fd4wm5w,1578175887.0,"You’re correct that media will always push a narrative; however, in the case of the Iraqi invasion, there were documented atrocities far beyond what would be ‘expected’ in war.  

If you consider Newsweek to be a propaganda outlet, perhaps this would satisfy you?

From the Human Rights Watch official report:

> Gross human rights abuses against Kuwaiti citizens and other residents of Kuwait commenced in the immediate aftermath of the August 2 invasion. Hundreds were killed or wounded, and thousands detained, in the takeover.

> Iraqi soldiers and militia committed countless acts of theft, rape and assault on civilians. Others participated in criminal activity as law and order broke down.

> Scores of people were summarily executed in September and October, including physicians, hospital volunteers and food-distribution personnel, some of them in front of their families. Scores more were killed in confrontations with Iraqi forces, or in detention. Iraq has yet to give an accounting of people killed in its custody 

> Detainees reported being housed in crowded and unsanitary makeshift detention centers. There, they were systematically tortured to extract information, gain cooperation, mute opposition or set an example to discourage others. Interviews with former detainees showed widespread, and apparently officially sanctioned, ill-treatment of those in custody, such as sleep deprivation, beatings with sticks and metal pipes, mock executions, and threats of execution or harm to family members.

> Collective punishment was meted out in response to individual acts of resistance. Houses were methodically burned, or deliberately destroyed by tank fire or explosives. Relatives of suspects and wanted public figures were detained and tortured to extract information on their relatives' whereabouts.

That is the hill I was referring to.

pics,fd4stpg,t1_fd3rrq3,1578170810.0,"> The bodies regularly unloaded at Kuwait City's four major medical centers included victims with ax wounds, holes drilled through their kneecaps or intestines inflated with air. At Mubarak Hospital, the country's largest, doctors received victims burned by acid, with ears cut off and eyes gouged out. Torturers beat one woman, shot her three times in the chest and neatly sawed off her skull, exposing her brain. A gynecologist at the hospital, accused of poisoning Iraqi soldiers, had his fingernails torn out and his body burned with cigarettes before death.

> Blotting out the word ""Kuwait"" on road signs was one tactic; ripping off the fingernails of people displaying the emir's picture was another. At one point the Iraqis brought a new mother before captured Kuwaiti resistance fighters and stripped her naked. ""Here is the milk of Kuwait,"" they taunted. ""Drink it."" Eventually the Iraqis dumped the woman back home, alive. It was enough to humiliate the essence of the Kuwaiti spirit.
