Edit: I don't know why I have to say this but, evolution does NOT just happen in a few years, NO, an extinct animal can't just ""re-evolve"". Another animal evolving (wich takes a lot of time) to fill in the specific niche is not the extinct animal ""re-evolving"", it's another animal that evolved to fill the niche, that's just not the same. 

""Re-evolving"" is simply not a thing, that's just not how evolution works."

Edit: Just to make it clear, I really really hope we get Clone Wars, it‘s my favorite era. It‘s just that I fear they will cancel it because FFG seems to be cutting down a lot of potential lately. The end of IA really demotivated me and at least for me came out of nowhere. I guess I am projecting this feeling onto Armada now. IA had Legion as a competitor, Armada has X-Wing."
