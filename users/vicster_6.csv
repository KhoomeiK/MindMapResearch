thenetherlands,fen26ku,t1_femmht2,1579275312.0,Wie is de direct verantwoordelijke dan volgens jou en wat zou die hier dan tegen kunnen doen?
thenetherlands,fen1uw9,t1_femuk2t,1579275104.0,"Dat zeg ik niet, en ik denk ook niet dat dit realistisch is. Maar ik denk zoiezo dat minder vlees eten en bewuster vlees eten in ieder geval  al een goede stap vooruit is."
thenetherlands,femlm2q,t1_feml9lb,1579261553.0,"De consument draagt hier ook indirect aan bij, als je echt iets wilt doen met je stoppen met vlees eten."
xxfitness,feg9ec2,t3_eozw31,1579083383.0,"Yes I do, but I think it’s also because I’m around more food for longer which makes me crave it more. On my non  lifting days I come straight home after work and will get more tempted to eat, whereas on my lifting days I’m not home until 7:30pm and then it’s dinner time already."
xxfitness,feg8w7q,t3_eoyndb,1579082667.0,"You can incorporate some cardio into your weightlifting routine by adding volume and decreasing rest. For example supersetting two lifts with lower weights and high reps, or doing a EMOM with relatively heavy weights. Or just alternating weightlifting sets with  some body weight exercises like burpees, push ups, etc without any rest."

crossfit,fecvgwt,t3_eo5pk4,1578986226.0,"Have fun, know your limits and just do everything according to your own level.

Make sure you focus on sleeping and eating enough - I grossly underestimated this and was constantly super tired and barely had enough energy for the workouts when I first started. Crossfit is a whole different kind of intensity then I knew before. 

Don’t be intimidated by other women or men - yes there’ll  probable be some extremely fit people in your box but they’ve often been doing crossfit for 4+ years."
relationships,fe2e0ef,t3_enmvmo,1578837294.0,"Are you truly allowing yourself to love? I think that beyond initial (sexual) attraction, love is something that has to grow but that you also have to allow. Loving someone means you’re vulnerable because you have to be open to receiving and giving love."
changemyview,fdrovh0,t3_emru4i,1578687566.0,I mean I agree with a lot of your points but why punish these people when it’s already too  late and they’ve already “cost” society a lot? Wouldn’t it be easier to implement programs in schools etc to educate kids about health and to prevent  obesity in the first place?
AskReddit,fdmm5c7,t1_fdmm0wr,1578555211.0,Yeah I see now that it was for the best but I hated it as a kid. All my friends didn’t have restrictions on their screen time and I always wanted that too. But now that I’m at an age where I’m thinking about having kids in the near future I totally see why my mom did that and will probably limit my future kids’ screen time as well (maybe less strict though).
AskReddit,fdmjmu6,t3_em2vfz,1578552328.0,Very limited screen time -30 mins in elementary school and slowly increasing up to and hour in high school
fatlogic,fdky70a,t1_fdkg1uz,1578513595.0,"Most agriculture concerns growing food for animals and not for humans directly. If these plants would be used only for human food, we’d need significantly  less space and resources to grown them."
fatlogic,fdkxs47,t1_fdkgi8v,1578513352.0,"It is pretty difficult to  track where food is coming from, companies are often explicitly unclear about this and will blatantly lie in their advertising about this. Dairy product commercials for example always show happy cows at small farms prancing around whereas in reality the milk is produced in massive factory farms. Terms like “family owned since x” and “natural product” are thrown around but they’re not actually based on facts. The reality is that the meat industry is horribly to animals wellbeing and significantly contribute to global warming. I think at this Point were too far past just buying meat from local farms, we need to stop eating meat period.  Eating meat from local farms is still going to contribute significantly more to global warming than stopping eating meat all together."
fatlogic,fdkx4ld,t1_fdkcl2h,1578512969.0,Yup! Personally I’m vegan but I know  is this isn’t going to be realistic for everyone hence the ‘significantly less meat’
fatlogic,fdk8ftc,t1_fdi4n1j,1578498446.0,"Yes but 99% of meat simply does not come from small sustainable farms. Whenever this argument is brought up everyone always all of a sudden ""only buys their meat from their uncle's organic farm where the animals are treated perfectly etc."" In order to have a real impact on climate change we need to significantly less meat."
relationships,fdk7q8y,t1_fdjyyfc,1578497992.0,"I agree with this, honestly I think its completely normal to still think about your ex and it doesn't have to mean that romantic feelings are still involved especially if your ex has been a part of your life for a long time."
socialskills,fdjh81e,t3_elg2iu,1578470687.0,I an very similar. Currently trying to understand why I’m this way in therapy - I’d highly recommend it if you aren’t already.

crossfit,fc81ei7,t3_eglvhj,1577524313.0,"For me doing a lot of clean lift offs helped a lot! So basically practicing the first part of the clean from floor to just above knee. In my weightlifting  class we always do 5x3 5-second lifts offs first,  and then 5x3 3-second lift offs into cleans. It teaches you to have a proper starting position and to accelerate and extend at the right  moment (above knee)."

relationships,fc03wom,t3_ef8bn1,1577277357.0,"Are you sure he doesn’t know though? I once saw my boyfriends dead kissing another woman on the train (he didn’t see me) and told my boyfriend. My boyfriend was very upset and after  deliberating for a long time he finally decided to tell his mom, who burst out laughing because she knew and told him that they both had other partners but didn’t tell the kids."
Psychonaut,fbg5sae,t3_ecw3fp,1576835880.0,congratulations
