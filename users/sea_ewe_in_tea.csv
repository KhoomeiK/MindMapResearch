Austin,fczfwjd,t3_ejgb4s,1578100360.0,"The press release: https://mailchi.mp/austintexas/apd-news-release-homicide-1 


On Friday, January 3, 2020, at approximately 7:49 a.m., APD officers responded to a suspicious persons call at the Bennu Coffee shop located at 515 S. Congress Ave, Suite #108. Upon arrival, two patrons of the coffee shop were actively trying to detain the suspect, a White male in his mid 20s, that had assaulted another patron for no apparent reason. During the struggle to arrest the suspect, the suspect was able to break free and ran from the business.  

At approximately 8:11 a.m., another call came into 911 advising that the suspect that ran from the coffee shop had fled towards the Freebirds World Burrito restaurant located in Suite #101. Another call came in from an employee of Freebirds advising that he and a coworker had been stabbed by the suspect. The suspect was seen by another witness leaving the business and climbing onto the roof. The suspect was then seen running and jumping off the roof where he sustained life-threatening injuries. Austin-Travis County EMS arrived on scene and transported one of the Freebirds employees and the suspect to Dell Seton Medical Center at the University of Texas. The employee is currently in stable but serious condition and the suspect remains in critical condition. Despite life saving measures by EMS, the second Freebirds employee succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced deceased at 8:30 a.m.  

Homicide investigators arrived and began processing the scene. This incident appears to be completely random and there is no ongoing threat to the community.  

The identities of the victims and suspect are being withheld at this time.  

Detectives are asking anyone with video or information about this incident to call Crime Stoppers at 512-472-TIPS or use the new Crime Stoppers App or email APD Homicide at homicide.apd@austintexas.gov. You may remain anonymous. You can also submit tips by downloading APD‚Äôs mobile app, Austin PD, free on iPhone and Android."

Austin,fcxili9,t1_fcxhqwo,1578063839.0,"AUSTIN (KXAN) ‚Äî At least one person died after four people were injured in a stabbing attack in downtown Austin Friday morning.

Austin-Travis County EMS says this happened on the 500 block of South Congress Avenue near Fifth Street around 8:12 a.m. (**note from copy+paster: a simple google search shows the 500 block of s Congress is the intersection at Riverside)

 ATCEMS said one person, a man in his 20s, was pronounced dead at the scene. A man in his 50s was taken to a hospital with potentially life-threatening injuries, and two other people are being treated for injuries at the scene.

As of 8:28 a.m., medics were performing CPR on two patients.

This is a developing story and we have a crew on the way to the scene. We will provide more information as it becomes available."
