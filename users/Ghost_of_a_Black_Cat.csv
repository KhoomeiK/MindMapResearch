MedicalGore,ffddypt,t1_ffbzk0y,1579818866.0,"I posted this up above, but I'll leave this here for you, as well. With a little more info added for clarity. 

Maggots like these are laid by the blowfly, which is not the common house fly (so don't worry about those bugs, they're just pests). They are attracted to the smell of rot and decay, and they can find a dead body within minutes because of the gasses given off by the corpse. The blowfly will lay eggs in moist places, such as the eyes, nose, mouth, genital area, and open wounds.  The fly will lay approximately 250 eggs, and once the eggs hatch, the maggots will start to feed, and start to burrow.  Maggots don't like bright light, so they burrow.  This type of maggot goes through three larval stages, eating more and more, getting bigger and bigger before pupating into a fly. 

The odor from this poor man's mouth had to be horrific to attract a blowfly in the first place. He had an awful infection in his gums and the rotten tissue was a perfect spot for the fly to lay its eggs.  I'm surprised he wasn't septic from the infection - maybe he was, but we just don't know. 

If this guy is having sinus issues, too, then it's guaranteed that he has maggots up there, as well. There are actually four sets of sinuses: the maxillary (cheeks), the frontal (forehead area), and the ethmoid and sphenoid (kind of behind the nose). It really doesn't matter if this guy's upper molars protrude into his sinuses at this point - those maggots have probably eaten through the top of his mouth already, and entered the maxillary sinus spaces. Which means that he was probably sneezing those things out. :/

A maxilliofacial surgeon can reconstruct the mouth, teeth, face, and jaws using plates, pins, wires, screws, and bone material (harvested from either the patient or a cadaver); a plastic surgeon can reconstruct the soft tissues of the face itself, including the nose and ears.  Of course, other specialists such as ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat), Ophthalmology (eyes), Neurology, etc. will be needed as well.

medizzy,fepl15t,t1_femqvwt,1579323284.0,"Removal of cysts this large can cause hypotension (low blood pressure) if, say, the inferior vena cava was compressed by the cyst and suddenly re-expands when the mass is removed, or if a compressed lung suddenly expands for the same reason. 

The surgeons try to remove these cysts intact, usually preforming a *TAH* (Total Abdominal Hysterectomy, which is removal of the uterus through the abdomen rather than by laparoscope) and a *BSO* (Bilateral Salping-Oophorectomy, which is removal of the ovaries and the fallopian tubes on both sides of the body).  They do this because many times the fallopian tubes, ovaries, etc. have adhered to the cyst and cannot be saved. They also try to remove the cyst intact because it could be full of fluid, or it could have some cancer cells, and they don't want it to rupture and spill anything into the abdominal cavity. 

Most cysts are small enough to extract using a laparoscope, but huge cysts like this one cannot be removed via the vagina, so they open up the abdomen to remove them.  Again, the Anesthesiologist must carefully monitor the blood pressure during surgery, and the patient must be monitored post-op as well.

The mom claims that she went outside to smoke and listen to music.  For only ten minutes.  This sounds hinkey to me.  I'm going to guess that she sat down, took her time smoking, looked at her phone, listened to a few songs, and was gone for at least a half hour.  Of course she told the police that she was only gone ten minutes; she couldn't really tell them otherwise without looking horribly negligent.  To me, thirty minutes seems like a more realistic ""alone time""; ten minutes does not.  

(Just FYI, I have two children, now adults, who were born 18 months apart, so I know what it's like to have two young children running around.) 

Also, can a toddler turn the bathtub spigot on full-bore, or would it just be kind of a trickle?  Some spigots are pretty tight. And, why was the baby floating ""face up"" in the water?  He should have been face down, typically, because the lungs will still have air in them, which causes buoyancy which, in turn, causes the face-down effect in drowning victims. One last thing:  why did the sister not scream or react to her floating brother?  Why did she not scream for mommy? 

It doesn't add up for me.

Oh, gosh, lots of reasons.  Fear.  Denial.  Misinformation (found online, for example).  

I remember one woman who actually flew down to Mexico to get coffee enemas.  **Coffee enemas**, as though that was going to save her.   She bought a ""medical device"" that looked like an old-fashioned [dynamite detonator](https://www.propnspoon.com/vintage-red-detonator-dynamite.html), that was supposed to send an electric current through her body and ""zap"" the cancer cells.  She took all sorts of crazy ""cures"", all the while refusing to have the surgery and treatment afterwards that could have saved her life, since her cancer had been detected at an early stage.  Yes, she died.  And after she died, her surgeon brought me her chart (this was back in the days of hand-written charts), dropped it in front of me and said:  ""Read this.  This is what you *do not* do if you have breast cancer.""  And I read that bastard cover to cover - there were three volumes actually, as she had been seeing the surgeon for years.

Some look to their faith, thinking their god will heal them.  I am Southern Baptist, and I believe that God gave us modern medicine for a reason.  It's OK to pray, and be spiritual, but also know that prayer can go hand in hand with expert medical treatment.

Some think that meditation, herbs, yoga, diet, or juicing will cure them.  It won't.  That stuff might make you *feel better* in body, spirit, and mind, but it will not heal you.

Others don't want to ""be a burden"" on their families, so they don't tell anyone, and it's a massive, shocking, unpleasant surprise to their loved ones.  Like this poor lady.  She looks relatively young.  Did she live alone?  If she had family, you can't tell me that no one smelled all of that rot and decay.  Did she simply, adamantly refuse to go to an oncologist (cancer doctor)?  We don't know what her story is, but it seems like a sad one."
MedicalGore,fditkz2,t1_fdhvaiq,1578450737.0,"This is what is known as an *ulcerated* or *fungating* wound.  That is, when cancer breaks through the skin.  I can tell you that the smell here would be horrendous.  

When breast cancer is first detected, if it is still *in situ* (or contained) within the tumor, then the tumor is removed and other therapy is begun.  If the cancer has broken out of the tumor, the surgeon may remove both the tumor and some of the patient's underarm lymph nodes (armpit area) to see if there are any cancer cells detected there (these lymph nodes are examined in the lab under microscope).  If none are detected, this is a good thing, but the surgeon may still remove more of the lymph nodes on the affected side to stop the potential spread of cancer in the future.  If the lymph nodes *do* contain cancer cells, then therapy is done to try to detect potential mets and to eradicate rogue cells.

When the breast cancer has ulcerated, as this poor woman's has (and to the massive degree that it has), then it is guaranteed that there is absolutely no viable treatment at this point, save placing the patient on ""comfort measures"" until she passes away.  This poor lady is absolutely full of cancer now, and is probably in so much pain!  It makes me sad.

*This is a very simplified explanation, of course."
MedicalGore,fdirp4q,t1_fdikf9s,1578449538.0,"I worked in a breast cancer clinic for years, on the surgical side.  I've seen patients just like this, way too many times.  Breast cancer can move around the body via the lymphatic system (your lymph nodes), so it's possible for it to settle in the liver, spine, brain, etc..

So, if your breast cancer metastasizes, and spreads to your spine, liver, brain, etc., you can have breast cancer develop in those places, as well, because the rogue cells are originally from a breast cancer tumor."

Being tall, it happened to me all through junior high and high school, and those comments were a bit of a trigger.  But now I know they were harmless, and I feel much better knowing so.  Again, thank you for the kind words.  Happy New Year to you!"
medizzy,fdfrtjs,t1_fddsoyn,1578368643.0,"Yes, it's pretty painful.  It also causes fatigue, abnormal bleeding, and heart failure.  It doesn't sound like a lot of fun."
hmmm,fdfq2x5,t1_fdfpq78,1578367490.0,Ah. OK.  Sorry for the rant then!
hmmm,fdfpdl9,t1_fdfg9o4,1578367019.0,"OMG, grow up!  A tall woman is a thing of beauty, and your remarks show just how ignorant you are.  I happen to be a 6'2"" woman, and it's comments like yours that made me so insecure and embarrassed to be so tall in high school.  Thank God I graduated and discovered people who were kind and respectful and who showed me that my height was something in which to rejoice, not condemn.  We are not freaks. Please think about what you say."

MurderedByWords,fdcdylz,t1_fdc9xcx,1578272556.0,"Boy, are you right about that!  I just got my first pump this week, a Tandem t:slim x2.  I also just got a Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor.  

I was told by my Dietician that the pump costs $10K by itself, and that doesn't include infusion sets, transmitters, cartridges, insulin vials, etc.  

But it is essentially my new pancreas, and I am grateful that there is the technology out there to help me to finally control my blood sugars and live a better life."
