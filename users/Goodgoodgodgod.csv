ShutTheFuckUpBoomer,fearxjf,t1_feapdnq,1578951698.0,"At one point a 5th grade education was considered reasonable and over time it progressed to a high school diploma. There’s little reason, especially when looking at many sections of the job market, to not see a college degree being the continued evolution of that reasonableness. Granted that’s not across board as I am an exception but nonetheless it is there. And it will be there when you or someone in your direct family will almost certainly utilize some sort of tax payer funded assistance to some degree. 

My remark about the military was of course hyperbole. But if we want to talk “reasonable” we certainly could cut down on a huge amount of tax dollars spent on it. If we strive and apparently enjoy preventing an increase in quality of life then we aren’t a civilization that deserves to flourish. 

I’m not against personal accountability but by golly we don’t need to go nuclear on anyone who’s made a bad choice."
ShutTheFuckUpBoomer,feaov3b,t1_feani03,1578950897.0,"Ok, I’ll push for your tax dollars not to be used on education, especially elementary schools, and you can help me push for my tax dollars to not be used in any way shape or form towards military costs. Because morals."
ShutTheFuckUpBoomer,feao0vt,t1_fealxpx,1578950734.0,"Which is my point exactly. I have very little to personally gain from free college, student loan forgiveness or hell even free healthcare at the moment. It doesn’t mean that I should be pressing for my fellow countrymen to struggle. I want us to be able to do these things better than just about every other devolved country that is currently doing this. That way instead of spending large amounts of our populations lives focused on trivial struggles we could focus on actual innovation and real upward mobility."
ShutTheFuckUpBoomer,feaml6m,t1_feak55w,1578950322.0,"If it’s forgiven, as it is being discussed, then yeah. Even then, sometimes there are extenuating circumstances which make it ok as well or at the very least debatable towards leniency. After all how much debt does the U.S. Government have? By your logic if it can’t be paid back it should be burned to the ground. That would mean disbanding our military and all the military families drowning in debt because they are prime targets for predatory lenders."
ShutTheFuckUpBoomer,feai5t3,t1_fea80bh,1578949040.0,"If you were the victim of predatory actions on behalf of the bank that provided that loan which hoped you’d default I see no reason to not “chip in” via my tax dollars to help you out. 

If you can put your emotions aside maybe you’d be able to grasp that eliminating certain debts isn’t something that is unheard of. It’s just somehow seen as top tier evil by your type when it isn’t dished out to people who very well have means and assets beyond those debts. 

Also, I don’t have a degree. My journey in life led me on another path which has thankfully proved quite lucrative compared to many. I have a home, good health and almost non existent debt. I just don’t find it necessary to give myself reassurances by hoping others in my community have it worse than me."
ShutTheFuckUpBoomer,fe9zrcv,t1_fe9wjdn,1578942914.0,"Well for starters Trump has not settled all his debts. Ask the city of El Paso about the hundreds of thousands of dollars he owes them. That wasn’t a business venture it was so he could jack himself off to his fanatics. Even then why should businesses get a benefit of a doubt and more leeway on skipping out on there debts than humans? Remember those too big to fail con artists who took billions from us and then used it to give themselves raises? 

You talk about money that isn’t ones being used for other people because of force yet you defend those that take the most. That abuse it the most. That feel entitled to it the most. Student loan forgiveness isn’t saying that no one should pay any of their debts. It’s just saying “let’s move on here.” And there’s nothing wrong with moving on when it benefits society as a whole. 

Well, I guess it’s akin to eating babies unless the forgiveness goes to silver spoon narcissists and corporations for temporarily embarrassed billionaires like you."
ShutTheFuckUpBoomer,fe9gg87,t1_fe9asd7,1578937306.0,Yes. You are so wrong and know it. Otherwise you wouldn’t be a regular on The Donald which worships a man who is renowned for skipping out on his debts.

I accepted on the ground that I receive an absolute minimum of X hours a week. I laid out how that was the only I could afford rent and gas money. This didn’t even cover maintenance for my car. They assured me that it was doable. Of course that’s not what happened and they also cut my raise short a nickel from what was promised. (I know it’s just a nickel but it’s the principle) 
Around the same time a friend of a friend offered me a job with a schedule that absolutely did not conflict with the hours I had been working at the other job FOR YEARS. So of course once the first job finds out about the other all of a sudden I’m scheduled for shifts that overlap the other or that literally have me driving from one side of town to the other during rush hour traffic within a half hour time frame."
