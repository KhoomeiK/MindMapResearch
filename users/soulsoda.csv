I clearly have empathy and am always willing to listen to others when they are cordial, something you never were. Not mention I was a safety engineer... Sociopaths by definition do not care about others safety let alone
If you can't tell the difference between my sarcasm or the fact i have 0 respect for an idiot like you, thats sad. 

Sociopath (ASPD) would be perfect word to describe yourself however. You simply need 3 of the following traits to be on some spectrum of DSM-5, which i'll be kind enough to list for you since you're clearly ignorant on the subject.

1.Doesn’t respect social norms or laws. 

2. Lies, deceives others, uses false identities or nicknames, and uses others

3. Doesn’t make any long-term plans.

4. Shows aggressive or aggravated behavior.

5. Doesn’t consider their own/others safety 

6. Lack of regard of others feelings and rights

7. Doesn’t feel guilt or remorse 

8. Doesn't follow up on personal or professional responsibilities.

9. Attempting to control or manipulate others

So lets play doctor right?

You never understood or respected my feelings/rights, clearly #6. Your initial unprovoked aggressive behavior, #4.  Attempting to control my opinions and manipulate me #9. You're lack of remorse over your initial aggressive and insulting behavior #7. So thats 4? Simply the surface, easily could be more. 

Anyways thats 4, definitely on the spectrum, probably would want to see a doctor about some therapy to help treat APSD, but anyways sociopath and lunatic aren't that far apart. I don't feel like i mislabeled you in the beginning. Guess i just have a knack for guessing these kind of things :)"

You're legitimately a lunatic, a troll or a moron.

todayilearned,fdiyv4k,t1_fdirpf5,1578454208.0,"No. There are provisions. You can setup a prenup. She didn't get half his fortune. It was divided based on the estate maturity. 

Even if the other spouse just provides home support, they still take value from the working spouses job. Its considered a joint effort. There is no reason to change this. Overseering Household affairs allows the other spouse a different lifestyle than if they were living alone. You talk to your spouse about work. They will ask questions and give you advice, or help you talk through whats going on. You doing your job is not just 100% you when you are married.  The is already provisions for pre marital assets. The bezos divorce worked as intended. Both sides make sacrifices to ensure that your transforming your household lives to a certain lifestyle. The expectation in splitting an estate is that both sides exit a marriage while retaining a similar lifestyle provided the marriage reached maturity. 

The divorce rate for any given marriage is 50% in the US. The divorce rate for someones first marriage is closer to 40%. It's the people who clearly aren't fit for marriage that bring that average up... second and third marriages are 60-80% more likely to end in divorce.

Grats on helping bezos stack more boxes. No one cares. She didn't get half the physical estate. She got half the worth of the transformation of their estate based on premarital assets... as it should be. She could have easily taken more if she wanted to. She chose not to.

For the last fucking time. there is no feasible way to significantly improve upon divorce divisions of assets without screwing 95% of the people. It's already modernized. Marriage makes everything you do a joint effort. There is no way feasible change to this that would ever result in a more fair divorces. It would become a battle of who can hire the best lawyers as their puny estate dwindles into nothing. If you want to talk about custody battles being barbaric and archaic mess have away. But division assets is already as fair as it will ever be as its incredibly straight forward. Prenups or 50/50 + transformative. Its about what is equitable and what is fair and that parties can retain a relative minimal disruption to their lifestyle in the short term."
todayilearned,fdipihg,t1_fdh5wcv,1578448135.0,"It is modernized... Stop being a shitheel. What your asking for is backwards. Divorce rates are not even close to 100%

Amazon was founded AFTER they got married. Who knows how much advice and help she gave bezos during their marriage as he was building amazon. That's why she's gets part of the estate. That's only reason she didn't get more is because of his networth prior to them getting married and the amount he financially invested with premarriage assests. If they both came from nothing it would have been split 50/50. If you don't have these laws, everything will go to who has a better lawyer. If anything they are perfect example on what I'm talking about in maturity of a marriage....

Just don't get married if your so worried about this."
todayilearned,fdh10lm,t1_fdgypoq,1578413034.0,"I'm not arguing anything. The man deserves diddly. He STOLE. Hiding assets in a divorce in just about any country that isn't a backwards shithole = forfeited. Divorce law for division of assets is pretty straight forward for every country. 

Any work/items bought/ done while married = Matrimonial estate. The VALUE is split 50/50. So that both parties retain their current living standards. The only time parties literally split everything 50/50 is when they are being spiteful. Man keeps his car/tools worth 40,000$ lady keeps jewels worth 15000$ but gets an extra 35000$ out of the house to make it even etc.

The only cases in which items would not be considered part of an estate is inheritances or if the Matrimonial estate was not given time to mature. Like if the marriage was only 4 months. You don't get diddly from your wife if she was a mega rich ceo just like she can't anything of value out of your shitty Pokemon card collection

This is not USA law this is basically everywhere. There is no reason to reform these laws because their working as intended for assets. The only way to improve upon them would be to allow for revisitation of settlements in the case of assets changing value. 

Marriage is a partnership. You support each other. If you don't like how assests are split in a failing marriage. Move to an Arabic country."

Company shares, house equity, salary distribution etc. You'd get half her Jewelry collection and so forth. She'd get half the power tools. Usually both sides work with lawyers who respect whom would primarily want what.

Shes owed half the paintings or something of equivalent value because he BOUGHT them with their estates money. She'd also be entitled to half of the fakes if they are worth something since they were made prior to the divorce. However in this case since he hid assests they should be all forfieted to her."

She probably would not have gotten them all but a few unless the set was more valuable whole, then one of them would have gotten them.

What he did was theft, and doing something like this in an actual divorce and getting caught would cause you to lose  any assests you hid before they split it as evenly as possible.

He painted the fakes because he didn't want them to be sold for cash and he probably didn't trust her to not sell them."

Even the church (the moral compass of the times) didn't come around until maybe the late 17th century where it and the pope started to oppose slavery as ""hey guys maybe this isn't right"". The abolitionist movement in the states comes heavily from french influences. However to say that it was all over was wrong. It was in the north that was calling to end slavery was closer to 1740s, it was not a social norm in the south. Even then it wasn't until the revolutionary war that abolitionist movement made significant traction."
history,fdcfloc,t1_fdaqfwh,1578273692.0,"I believe on her account it was described as relief. That she was married and wouldn't be forced take care of herself after being marred as women had very few means of income back then outside of prostitution. 

We have several accounts of slavery not working as an institution. Even from ""gentle"" slaver owner accounts. There was plenty of telltale signs that they didn't conform or consent to slavery because there was always acts of resistance on all estates that are well documented. Theft - slaves would steal clothing scraps or food commonly to supplement their rags.  Feigning illness to not have to work. Performing slowly or poorly on purpose. or the must simple resistance of all... running away. 

I'm not saying it was slavery was benign. Its a black mar on history that goes waaaaaaaaay back, and still festers to today as we still have human traffickers/slaves. Its an evil, and violates what should be a basic human right, and should have always been a basic human right.

My point is that people would be better judged by the accounts of their peers and their social norms, and their lasting impact on society, than vs our social norms vs solely their actions. I'm not saying we need to revere a rapist. I still wouldn't look on him as having done a good thing or fixing it. but i can understand the view point people had back then and why they'd have considered him to have done right by her. I'd be outraged if that happened today (and it does). Like I'd think a bit less of George Washington as he was a slave owner. He thought slavery was wrong, but continued to profit off it and practice slavery. He believed it was wrong, and continued to do it. Even if he was the opinion that change should happen gradually, he still willingly participated without being forced into it. He did the bare minimum. Its definitely different than someone of biblical times where slaver ownership was a standard thing  and didn't free their slaves on death."

If it was not for the revolutionary war, George washington would have just remained a gentle slave owner who was skeptical to the econmic viablity of slave ownership, which is about as much good as you could expect out of a typical white slave owner in virgina in those times. 

If anything I'd look on george washington in a more negative light than other gentle white slave owners, because we know he knew it was wrong, thought the practice should end over time, and he continued to practice it anyways, despite believing it was wrong. In fact, he wasn't going to free his slaves on his death, he was going to transfer them to another for greater net profit provided they experienced similar conditions to what they did under his estate despite the fact that it would have been hugely disrupting to his slaves lives.

2007scape,fbxyq44,t1_fbwnnfp,1577203915.0,"Skilling is dead content because they just don't earn as much as they used to due to slayer drops and botting. Rcing used to be like 1.8mil an hour. Rune bars was 2mil an hour etc. Now most Skilling methods earn less than 450k/hr and what's the point when you can afk a slayer monster like wyverns or gargoyles for an ez 500k/hr. 

Zulrah, zulcano, and vorkath killed alot of prices of staple items in Skilling. Makes it very hard to earn monies in Skilling. Like woodcutting is a joke. The top method is a dangerous wilderness method for 400k/hr and shit xp next best is like 150k/hr."

It's not like people report what their estate is worth year to year, and if they offshore money or finds way to create a sink so they have less wealth than it appears or have so much money that paying exit tax is cheaper you'll get a bunch of nothing or rich flight."
