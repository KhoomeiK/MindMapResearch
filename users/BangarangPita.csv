AmItheAsshole,fergaud,t1_fequ1zg,1579353544.0,"My mom was letting me stay home sick by myself when I was 7.  I was a smart, responsible kid who knew enough not to answer the (locked) door, to only answer the phone after screening to make sure it was mom calling, not to use the stove, etc., and would spend the day watching The Price Is Right and coloring. Plus, she couldn't afford to take sick days all the time, and we had a scary-looking Great Dane and an actually scary German shepherd (fiercely protective, ya know?).  

However, my brother and I required a babysitter until I was nearly 13, because he was an obnoxious pain in the ass who barged in my room and bothered me incessantly, and we spent most of our time together trying to tear each other's throats out.  

I was babysitting toddlers when I was 13-14.  I had read The Babysitter's Club series when I was 8-9, so I had been prepared to watch other people's kids for years.

Edit:  And agreed on the shuffling.  My cool aunt who taught me how to roll cigarettes with her rolling machine (the '80s were a wild time, lol) also taught me how to shuffle properly (doing ""the bridge"") by the time I was 7."

Can I make the playlist?""  I'm not pushy about it, but I always make good, interesting mixes with enough stuff that everyone likes and has a fun time listening to.  Listening to music I don't like, i.e. literally Drake, is intolerable.  

I'm an Uber driver, and I haaate when people ask for the aux.  Like, no.  It's 10 minutes.  You can tolerate my Bon Jovi and K. Flay and Lady GaGa and Ludacris.  Do NOT make me listen to you skipping through 12 seconds of 23 different Cardi B and Xtension Cord songs in my own car.  

If I had (little) kids, they would probably not be watching YouTube or listening to Baby Shark and shit.  I was born in '83, and do you know what I was listening to at 4?  Billy Idol.  ""Mony Mony"" was my first favorite song.  Headbangers Ball was one of my favorite shows (after Punky Brewster).  Appetite for Destruction was the first tape my mom ever bought me (she had no idea there was a cartoon of a passed out naked lady inside, but was fine with the swearing).  

NSFW story time to conclude this rant:  in first or second grade, one of my classmates was wearing an oversized NKOTB t-shirt as a dress with a belt around the middle the day after their concert.  She was going on about how great they were, so I told her that I had heard one of the guys in the group passed out on stage once because he had swallowed too much semen.  I have no idea where I heard that, or if I explained what that meant, but I know it upset her.  I'm so lucky I didn't get in trouble, lol."

I saw NIN at Fox Theatre in Detroit (the first of his two shows there) last year, and he nearly blew the roof off.  Best fucking concert I have ever been to.  We knew he was going to play about 20 out of a possible 50 songs (I always check setlist.fm before seeing shows so I won't be disappointed if my favorite songs aren't played), and we hoped to hear some of our favorites.  He played them ALL.  He even played The Perfect Drug - my favorite NIN song - which he's only done live about three times.  It was beautiful.  I was so ecstatic I cried."

I missed out on GNR when they came around, and I'm still not sure if I regret it.  Axl has always sounded like a cat in heat, but Appetite for Destruction was the first tape I ever had as a kid, so I had always hoped to see them.  But then when he was supposed to tour with AC/DC when Brian Johnson was no longer able to perform, I saw some videos of his recent performances and opted to get a refund on my tickets.  

I feel like I'd regret not seeing Motley Crue, but after reading the comments about them here and Vince sounding awful, well... shit.  I only like a couple Poison songs - and definitely not Every Rose Has Its Thorn (thanks for killing that for me, Rock of Love) - but I think I can avoid being too disappointed in the show overall if I know that my satisfaction of it will peak with Poison."

But I went, hoping to hear some of the older stuff, and paid $100 extra to do the meet-and-greet (something I've never paid to do before or since - that's a lot of money for me).

If everything had gone wrong at my wedding, it would have sucked in the moment, but I know I would have laughed later.  

I once visited a friend for during Columbus Day weekend while she was going to college about an hour outside of Chicago, and it was like a comedy of errors.  We went to see the Bloodhound Gang, and some asshole purposely dumped his entire beer on my head (and I hate the smell of beer to begin with).  We nearly got kidnapped on the south side because we STUPIDLY accepted the offer of a ride to our train platform by two guys we met at the concert, but were able to jump out as they slowed down at a red light.  We got lost trying to get to the right train platform to get us to the main train station that would get us back to the suburbs (it's confusing when you're from an area with minimal public transportation and one train that only runs up and down Main Street).  She didn't realize the trains stopped running to the suburbs at midnight, so we got stranded overnight with about $4.  Neither of us had credit cards or any way to check into a hotel.  

We had to hoof it about a mile to get to a 24-hour greasy spoon restaurant, having to make our way past about a dozen VERY aggressive panhandlers.  (I had gone to high school downtown and was used to panhandlers, but my friend wasn't and would stop for every single person and apologize and tell them that we didn't have any money to spare, etc.  I had to tell her to just look forward, don't make eye contact, and keep moving.  It's not that I don't feel for people or want to help them, but they legitimately had more money than we did and we were in a vulnerable position, especially after having nearly been abducted.)  

While there, we saw an armed postal worker collect mail outside of this place at 4 am (maybe they wouldn't need the gun if they did this earlier in the day?).  We saw a man in a wheelchair have a seizure or go into cardiac arrest or something and get taken away by an ambulance.  Once morning came and we went back to the station, as we waited for our train we were pretty much accused of trying to kidnap a woman's baby because we said it was cute (chill out, lady - we're 19 - we wouldn't have wanted our own babies at that age)!  

The next day as my Amtrak train was about to depart for home, we were all swiftly deboarded so police and K9s could search it.  I had weed and a bowl in my bag on there and nearly panicked myself to death that I was going to be busted for the federal crime of transporting drugs across state lines.  Fortunately, they were bomb-sniffing dogs and didn't find any bombs or my weed.  The train was packed with people and a lady sat next to me and kept going to the bathroom to sneak a few drags of a cigarette, so she reeked of a short.  To make things worse, she was listening to The Pussycat Dolls song ""Don't Cha"" on repeat for about an hour.  She had headphones on, but it was still loud enough to hear, and she was singing and obnoxiously dancing along.  (There were no open seats for me to move to.)  Lastly, a train ahead of us derailed, so we had to spend nine hours stuck at a station in Toledo, Ohio.  

It was an annoying, maddening, and terrifying trip, but one that we still laugh about all these years later."

AmItheAsshole,fdyfmqw,t3_en9ejl,1578779265.0,"NTA.  I'm so sorry that a birthday you had likely looked forward to for many years was ruined that way.  

It's unnatural for a parent to lose a child, so of course it's natural for them to grieve.  They will never just ""get over it.""  But your dad has managed to cope.  Not get over it, but *cope,* which means appreciating the daughter he still has and not selfishly ruining big moments in her life.  And hell, you lost your twin!  Not just another sibling, but your *TWIN.*  Twins share a bond like no other.  Losing her at such a young age had to be traumatic.  Your grief matters, too.  And so does your life.

Therapy might never help your mother, especially if she doesn't really want to be helped.  I don't know what you've talked about with your mom, but if you haven't already, it's time to sit down with her and have a serious conversation.  Tell her that you have something to say, that you'd like to do it without being interrupted, and that when you're finished, you'd like to hear her feedback.  I took a human interactions class in college, and one of the things they taught us is not to have an argument/discussion using a lot of ""you"" statements.  If you say things like, ""you always..."" or ""you never..."" it sounds accusatory and they will become defensive and shut down. So try to focus on using ""I"" statements.  

Here is an example of a conversation you might try having:

""I felt hurt when you brought up Claire so frequently at my birthday party.  I understand how much you still hurt for her, and that's ok.  But I'm still here, and I need to know that I matter to you, too.  I don't think it's selfish to feel that my 18th birthday party should have been about me, and when you - not once, but repeatedly - talked about Claire, it became about you and Claire.  We could have had a private celebration to honor her at a different time and place, but it was inappropriate to do as a toast.  It made me feel uncomfortable and as if I was not the guest of honor at my own party.  That night should have been a celebration of my life and of my becoming an adult, and instead it became a memorial service.  If we are to have any kind of meaningful relationship moving forward, then I need to be shown that I am important to you, too, and that how I feel matters to you.""

I can't say if this will work without knowing your mom, but it's worth a shot.  If she can't respect your feelings and boundaries for appropriate occasions to talk about your sister, then you'll have to be strong and communicate that you'll have to minimize your time together until she can learn to better value the daughter she still has.  I wish you the best of luck."
AmItheAsshole,fdy75hb,t1_fdxvb59,1578776806.0," Just because someone is family, that doesn't mean they get a pass to be an ignorant, hateful bigot.  The line has to be drawn somewhere, and being tolerant does not mean that one tolerates intolerance."
AmItheAsshole,fdy6ots,t1_fdxdrx4,1578776637.0,"Yes, of course we would have a different answer.  OP wants to revoke tuition because their niece is becoming an indoctrinated bigot.  This is a BAD thing and should absolutely not be condoned."
AmItheAsshole,fdy5jp7,t1_fdwg3hs,1578776330.0,"No.  What you're basically saying is that OP should tolerate intolerance, and that is NOT acceptable."
AmItheAsshole,fdy3rb5,t1_fdxy99y,1578775775.0,"Scholarships come with strings, so why shouldn't this tuition?  If OP feels that their money is contributing towards homophobia, bigotry, and persecution - EXACTLY what led to their sibling's drug use and death - then they are right in nipping this shit in the bud.  Otherwise, they're continuing to reward the niece's horrendous mentality.  

Edit:  And yeah, the niece might be ""finding herself,"" but we're not talking about dyeing her hair purple or getting her lip pierced - we're talking brainwashing at a vulnerable age that will likely last the rest of her life and will go on to hurt others."
AmItheAsshole,fdy2olh,t1_fdxlnm1,1578775372.0,"She's 19, not 4.  She needs to be told, and SIL doesn't appear to ever be planning to do it.  If she was, this crucial point in time when her daughter is becoming a brainwashed bigot is it."
AmItheAsshole,fdy1v16,t3_en90gx,1578775145.0,"NTA.  Tell your SIL that hiding her husband's true past is a dishonor to him and is contributing to her daughter's new backwards, brainwashed views, and that you're cutting the tuition unless she finally tells the truth.  While you could disagree with but respect her decision not to say anything while your niece was growing up, she's technically an adult now, and 19 years of this lie is more than long enough - it's time to pull the bandaid off.  She needs to know that perspectives like hers are exactly why she doesn't have a dad, and she needs to knock it off before becoming the reason why someone else kills themselves."
pettyrevenge,fdxzkfm,t3_emzq3l,1578774527.0,"I have no idea if this would work, but try putting a mezuzah up on your door frame.  It would tell visitors that you're Jewish, and maybe then they'd leave you alone.  A symbol from the Church of Satan might be more convincing, though.  Or just a ""666."""

I know this comment will be buried, but on the off-chance it isn't, print out the top/most guilded comments and give a copy to both your daughter and your ex.  They need a wake-up call and a different perspective on their foolishness."
AmItheAsshole,fdtx6zn,t3_emw6xl,1578723667.0,"NTA.  Boo-hoo, wifey - you agreed to ""for better or for worse.""  Well, this is a little bit of ""worse.""  She's acting like a spoiled child getting her first taste of the real world where mommy and daddy won't be wiping her ass anymore.  The days in la la land are over - she needs to suck it up, put on her big girl panties and fucking contribute as a PARTNER and PARENT.  It's supposed to be equal, and you pulled your weight for 25 years - now it's her turn.

Incidentally, I'm very sorry for what you and your daughter are dealing with.  I'm sure the palpable tension is miserable for both of you.  Do what you can to make sure she feels loved and knows that none of this is in any way her fault.  

You might want to talk to a divorce lawyer, too.  Even if you don't actually want or plan to ever split up, your wife might, and you don't want to be caught off guard.  Perhaps giving her the paperwork could even be the shock of cold water she needs to snap her out of her selfishness."

HPHogwartsMystery,fdqcq3s,t1_fdqbfvn,1578663143.0,Deaf ears.  Mute refers to not speaking.  :)
HPHogwartsMystery,fdqcnr0,t1_fdq7e52,1578663089.0,Exactly.  I found it weird and creepy as hell that 16-year-olds were gushing over how cool an 11-year-old was.  That would NEVER happen.  MC does not give a flying frog about Cedric Diggory or the twins.  She already has enough banal friends that she gets to have the same boring conversations with forever.
AmItheAsshole,fdqbfzx,t3_emimf3,1578662039.0,"Wtf?  NTA, at all!  I would be thrilled if my husband went to the grocery store and bought stuff we actually needed without me having to tell him.  I can say, ""hey, I'm going to the store tomorrow to get stuff for dinner,"" and he'll go in the morning to get himself gouda for his casein fix without getting anything else.  

However, he has no problem picking up my products when I feel too shitty to go out, and without being asked, he ALWAYS brings home the chocolate I'll be craving.  He grew up around women and is very empathetic to female agony. He's not the least bit embarrassed to buy my stuff, either, as it just shows the world he has a woman, which his 13-year-old inner self is still always proud as heck about."

I do have just one small critique, which I hope you won't mind terribly:  if I recall correctly, in a few instances when you said ""myself,"" in those contexts it should have said ""me"" (and once when speaking about Tasha, it should have been ""she"" instead of ""herself"").  I was an editor for several years, and old habits die hard.  But really, for the most part - bravo.  I'm glad Tasha got her comeuppance and that things worked out pretty well for the rest of you.  :)"
HPHogwartsMystery,fdpl10y,t1_fdoqb3o,1578631566.0,"Omg, I would LOVE that!  I so wish we had more actual say over how the story went, and that we could choose interactions with characters.  They should have made it more like Sims, which has been done on mobile, so it *is* possible (though Sims mobile isn't nearly as fun as on pc).  It would be too much fun to screw with Andre by doing hangouts while wearing the ugliest outfits imaginable.... like that hideous summer tourist outfit with a Christmas hat."
HPHogwartsMystery,fdpizkc,t3_eml138,1578629908.0,"Save your coins and gems!  Grind away at classes you don't need so you can earn coins and level up your attributes.  Don't play quidditch, do hangouts, or duel for a few weeks.  You need coins to duel actual opponents for the story, and you don't want to be caught without them.  And you'll need gems for energy and boosts if there's an event with an item you really want to win."
