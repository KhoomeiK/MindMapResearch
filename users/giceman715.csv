InsanePeopleQuora,ffg6b84,t3_erns6p,1579899387.0,"I have been with my girlfriend for 2.5 years, her daughter is 17 now and I‚Äôm struggling with the same thoughts to make her move out at 18. I have 2 kids daughter (24 ) son ( 22 ). My daughter moved out at 17 to go to college and my son moved out to live with his grandparents ( for better education purposes only ) and after he graduated he , he went to college but dropped out due to not doing well at school. He said ‚Äú sorry dad college isn‚Äôt for everyone and I‚Äôm not going in debt for something I‚Äôm not going to do ‚Äú so instead got a job as an electrician and moved in with some roommates. I never pushed work on my kids because both was full time athletes as well as students. They both are doing great now , daughter is in pharmacy school 3 year and son is still doing electrical work while going to school to get licensed. As for my girlfriends daughter she has no activities ( sports , music , art , ect. ) and all she wants to do is stay on tictoc and take selfies. She don‚Äôt want to help out around the house and the only chores I gave her was to clean the litter box and vacuum the carpet due to pets. She doesn‚Äôt do either until I say something and then she acts like I‚Äôm bothering her. She is a really good kid and I want to help her succeed but I believe she don‚Äôt respect me enough to listen to anything I say. I have tried to encourage her to get a job but she won‚Äôt. I also forgot to mention her dad lives in New Jersey with his sister and my girlfriend is still going through a divorce ( he has drugged it through the courts for over 3 years now ) he is military active and left my girlfriend ( who has lupus ) and his daughter in Tennessee while fleeing back up north. Since then ( through my support ) my girlfriend has gotten her drivers license back , she got her high school diploma and is currently in college to get a degree at 44. I have went way beyond to try and help her and her daughter and in return I get love and determination from my girlfriend but I get nothing in return from her daughter. I know she is still upset about her mom and dad not being together and I‚Äôm sure she is still going through some things. But she is also using the divorce to gain monetarily out of spite. Example if she wants something and I say no because you are not making any effort to your chores then she tells me ‚Äú well I‚Äôll just ask my dad and he will do it ‚Äú and she is right he does. Mainly because he lives with his sister , gets a check from the military and he has a job so I look at it as he‚Äôs showing her he loves her through money and not through parenting. I‚Äôm struggling really hard right now because work is slow and I have acquired allot of debt and not ONCE have I asked for nothing outside of take care of the house. I REALLY want to see her do well but I‚Äôm afraid if she keeps sitting around and waiting on handouts she will he lost in the world of life when reality sets in. Because she will not live here forever, my kids have worked there way through this and so shall she sooner than later. So I literally told my girlfriend yesterday that she has 3 choices she can get a job and help with the chores around the house , she can move back in with her grandparents and they can babysit or she can move up north and live with her dad and aunt. I‚Äôm out of options and patience so please tell me if you think I‚Äôm wrong or not because in my eyes I want to make her dependable on herself and make sure that life won‚Äôt chew her up. 


* sorry for the long post but after reading this post I had to get some things off my chest. 

P. S. If you think I‚Äôm wrong please feel free to enlighten me but don‚Äôt be assholish about it, I have enough on my plate as is."

I could have easily went and posted the same shit in my twitter account and use my profile pic and shared it here and still would have been in line with the rules."
insanepeoplefacebook,fet03of,t1_fesnbt2,1579370571.0,"God will be done regardless ‚Äú Romans 13:1 - ‚ÄúEveryone must obey the authority of the government. It is God who gives the authority to rule. The people who rule have received their authority from God.‚Äù So technically trump was right on this one but he appoints all rulers apparently to the word. Good and bad. It‚Äôs a divine plan that we question but can‚Äôt fully comprehend why mainly because of good coming from bad. Free will is your choice to do what‚Äôs right in your heart but will not affect the outcome of the plan. Example if your going on a trip ( we will say life ) and you put the destination ( we will say heaven ) in your GPS ( will say Gods plan ) it will give you the fastest route to take. It‚Äôs your choice to follow the path The GPS ( Gods plan ) has laid out for your or you have a choice ( free will ) to take a different route. If you use a different route the GPS ( Gods plan ) will recalculate your route. Again you have the free will you stay on the path or go another direction, but in the end of your choices you will still end up where you wanted to go. The tricky part here is to understand that in the end your choices will be judged accordingly to the word. I‚Äôm definitely not a trump fan but never really been a fan of any politician."
