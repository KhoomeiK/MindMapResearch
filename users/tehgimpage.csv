not saying this isn't fucked up.  just that they might be ok to drink.  i really hope soylent doesnt go under........"

Seaofthieves,ffczo69,t1_ffcvcv2,1579810549.0,"forts are just events that you kill waves of skellies at and get lots of loot.

alliances are when you fly an alliance flag, and other crews fly the same, and then you can ""team up"" and see eachother's position on the map.  you get half the treasure of the team turning in, and the turn-in team loses nothing.  its a sweet deal.  however, there's nothing stopping players from breaking the alliance and stealing your stuff. its just an act of trust, which can go very wrong.  (you can still attack and do damage to eachother and all that)"
Seaofthieves,ffczd0u,t1_ffcyt3y,1579810377.0,i solo in a gally.  ive noticed ppl fuck with gallys less.  but then you have to drive a big fat gally all by yourself.....
Seaofthieves,ffcz4d9,t3_esv6em,1579810243.0,"i will roll up solo on fort of the damns with my alli flag up and keep lookout for them til they notice me.   if they alli with me, ill stay on lookout and fish, if they attack me, i spend the next few hours tormenting them.  but usually they alli and i get half the loot for fishing. i love the alliance system. i hope it never changes."

TheDarkCrystal,fdq1peb,t3_emjm22,1578650510.0,"i don't wanna be a jerk, but i would highly recommend you never go back to that artist again.  find someone better who has experience in cover ups. this has a lot of potential, and you're obviously pretty excited about it, but it needs a LOT of work.    


the good news is its totally salvageable.  there's not a lot of really dark spots, and plenty of light colors and negative space to work off of. it could be strongly improved upon and made into an amazing tattoo. you just gotta drop the cash to get it done right.    


sry to be that guy. i love the concept, especially going with the landstrider. but the execution... not so much."

DetroitBecomeHuman,fck2do6,t1_fcjymbf,1577714505.0,"So there's some fine details that give it a little more weight, but I get where you're coming from.  In the magazine where you read about the Alice model robot, they are described as not knowing they're not a human.  They're supposed to be replacement children, so everything has to treat them as such.  I think this is why when Kara picks up and looks at the magazine the first time (when she's cleaning Todd's room, before she is woke) she just automatically dismisses the information.  Because all other robots would be programmed to assume she is human too.    
    
I think the frustration for me boils down to not knowing WHEN the Alice-bot became woke.  Was she woke the whole time?  Did it happen somewhere along the way?  There's a few events that could trigger it.  I just wish they had given a more solid hint there."
ChoosingBeggars,fck1obp,t1_fcjetul,1577713867.0,"if it helps at all, proximity probably wouldn't have helped much.  my aunt was an addict and was literally living in our backyard and we couldn't keep her off the stuff.  if they don't want to do it, they aren't gonna do it."
horror,fck0xgl,t1_fcjseyp,1577713159.0,"agreed.  absolutely no point in that one.  im all for horror and gore, but that one was just gross.  really just felt like they were glorifying the rape instead of making any kind of sociological point.  i regret watching the whole thing."

horror,fck07kl,t3_ehjc4t,1577712435.0,Dead Girl.  some douche bags find a girl chained up that can't die and proceed to rape her repeatedly.  that's the movie.  it was stupid and pointless and i regret spending the time watching it.  i love horror movies and gore and stuff but that one was just gross.
