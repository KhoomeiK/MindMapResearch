ibs,feo9np4,t3_epw9xv,1579297041.0,Yup definitely relate to this and it’s hard to get drs to understand and support you on this one. Same happens for my son (18) who has Crohn’s- much worse than my IBS but still similar issues- he does best from time to time on bleached white flour items & rice. Luckily he tolerates Ensure & can get nutrients this way.

Folding the laundry is the part that my kids weren’t good at until about 11 but I didn’t invest much time in teaching so there is that to consider.
Good luck, kids see it as fun to pitch in and help when they are little"
depression,fejlzbq,t3_epixdq,1579179396.0,"A wise colleague told me that school & grades can wait- they will always be there. Focus on yourself as you have been, it is the right thing to do.

rant,fe9mvcf,t3_eo7rup,1578939535.0,"I have a feeling this is mostly circumstantial at best. It takes a lot of effort to hate a student. Yes you are going to be treated with some irritation or dismissal if you are often late and don’t get good grades bc it the perception is that you don’t care about the class based on your actions. Teachers are human & being one I know I’ve accidentally skipped kids when checking work, but they mentioned it to  me & I give them the credit. No biggie. Might just wanna let them know  they missed you in a polite way. I wish you luck! Talk to the teachers in question, I’m sure they will reassure you that they don’t hate you."

I imagine given the dosage of the old medicine is the reasoning behind the 20 mg start on the Prozac- along with the taper.  Just my logical reasoning here.
I was on celexa for quite a few yrs til it didn’t do it for me anymore and I was told just to stop & started right onto the new med- sertralene which gave me horrible headaches so I switched right over to Prozac...I think it didn’t make the adjustment easy by just switching."

It can still get better than how you describe feeling right now. You owe it to yourself to let your dr know that your are still blue. 💙"
Outlander,fdexvg4,t1_fdcplj6,1578348913.0,"Yes I too am uber impressed at the actors playing the characters and the crazy passion they have on screen. Definitely like the book chemistry you imagine while reading. Yes most of it is 1st hand accounts from Claire, but there are times when the others take over the narration. The books are super detailed so there is definitely a lot to draw upon for character development! The time travel just made the story that much more intriguing to me. There’s so much in the books, you might want to hold off on reading them. It will allow you to reconnect with the story & characters once you are finished the series. It was a book series that I waited for each novel to be published & once I read them couldn’t find anything comparable. I just find Claire really cool, she is smart, skilled and feisty, not to mention beautiful."

teaching,fdam81z,t3_ekg1ga,1578247617.0,"First tip- especially if you are new to teaching- take this caution & “mute” it for now. Don’t let this judgement bias how you may interact with students. 
Survey the kids & see if you can find their “leader” & get that kid on your side. Keep “disruptive children”  busy with responsibilities like collecting  papers for you. Be firm and consistent in your tone and affect. Keep a warm and calm presence. 
Introduce yourself at the start of the day & be sure to convey your expectations of good behavior. Model and reinforce what you expect- such as hands up before contributing. Use positive reinforcement when you see good behaviors. Point out explicitly what you saw & state it was a good choice.
Lunch and playground duty- no clue how to advise you here. Takes cues from the other teachers.

Good luck- I’m sure it will be fine. Just establish yourself and remember kids make silly choices, but that doesn’t diminish their value and right to be treated humanely. Have fun!"

AskHSteacher,fd3sgjs,t3_ei7rsd,1578161300.0,"Just know if they “hate” you it’s more about them than you. Meaning they have their own shiz they are dealing with or repressing and that isn’t a reflection on you as a human. 

Most teachers don’t have the energy to hate a student and wouldn’t do so simply because the students are children! children make mistakes and these “slacking off” behaviors are pretty common. Behaviors are not how I would define my like or dislike of a student. the value of a person isn’t solely defined by their behaviors.

My point I suppose is that if they hate you they are stupid. If you screwed up, try to make amends or admit your wrong doing and move on with life taking whatever consequence is dealt. Yes you did crappy things but you aren’t a crappy human."

Teachers,fc1zaqt,t3_efq7ep,1577334478.0,"Definitely need to explicitly reteach your most important rules/norms upon returning. You can focus on one a day if you want, rewarding & reinforcing these behaviors (praise, other incentives). Modeling what you expect is important. Try to make your lessons engaging and include breaks where appropriate to help the kiddos get back into good habits. I like to get the students involved in the process such that they are reminding each other and praising good behaviors, find those couple of influencers in your classes & recruit them to help you. Typically that will help spread your objective like wildfire."

Happens when you relax due to the tension and strain and stress that was put on your body while working. maybe you have poor posture or you clench your jaw- it varies with the person. Sometimes it’s just the intensity of the mental activity, sometimes hormones play a role. It’s been studied and shown to be a predictor of migraines- stress from work or a heightened emotional state and then relaxing followed by migraine.
