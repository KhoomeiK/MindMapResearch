IAmA,fey36ti,t1_fewljqd,1579440172.0,"The factory to dealer incentives aren‚Äôt very large.   It‚Äôs a few hundred per car sold during the period.  

Factory to consumer rebates are the real factors to someone buying well below invoice.  

Example.   Buy a brand new Ford F-150 and get $2500 rebate.   This is how people buy for substantially less than invoice.

Rebates are what consumers should focus on."

IAmA,fey1fyt,t1_fewnrjl,1579439544.0,Most new car dealers pay a flat commission per car sold.  Usually in the $150-$250 range.    Bonuses tied to unit goals for the month.
IAmA,fev8ztx,t1_feuorjy,1579394539.0,"No smoke and mirrors.   It‚Äôs actually really simple.  

We pay invoice upfront.    

When we sell the car we get 2-3% returned.   This is to offset the cost of borrowing money for the inventory. 

Dealers have goals set by the manufacturer.  Usually 20% above the same months performance the year before.   

IF and ONLY IF the dealer hits the 20 up goals will they get the factory bonus for that period.   Those bonuses are typically in the range of $200-$300 per car sold during the period."

IAmA,feunkqn,t1_feuluui,1579388276.0,"I sell cars.   Have since 1998.    This is how it works.  

We buy the car for invoice.   Let‚Äôs say that is $20,000 for a car with an MSRP of $22,000.  

When I get that car I pay $20,000.     Service will likely get paid $500 or so to get the car ready for sale.  That‚Äôs paid by the factory to service.  

When the car is sold we get $400-$600 back to offset the interest we paid the bank.  

If we meet store goals.  Usually 20% up over last year we might get another $200-400 per car sold.   Have to hit the goal or we get jack shit."
IAmA,feulx9i,t1_feul0sv,1579387789.0,It is exactly what they pay.    They don‚Äôt get hold back money until the car is sold.   That money is to offset bank interest for stocking inventory.
