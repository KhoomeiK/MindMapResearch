I think stating that it's more present in the US is important though. In the US someone would probably think someone is a weab if they are learning Japanese without heritage or legitimate plans to visit or migrate there.

Then there's the people with older iPhones that make have some scratches but hey it's an iPhone so like, yeah you have your fancy brand or whatever despite it being from 4 years ago (although I applaud anyone for taking care of their electronics and not needlessly buying new ones). I mean in the US you can get older iPhones for a few hundred. Yes it's a few hundred USD so it may be an entire month's salary for them, but remember that a lot of times those people don't own laptops/computers, so it's their most expensive electronic device. Saving up for it makes sense. Like if I see a grab driver with a iPhone 11 Pro I'm going to be suspicious, but it's not like you have kids going to local-district public schools with them.
