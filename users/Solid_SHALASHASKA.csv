airsoft,fdxr1fx,t3_en6j9v,1578772059.0,"It feels wrong seeing someone, who isn't a Swedish soldier wearing an m90 uniform. I know It's completely unwarranted. When i joined the Swedish Armed Forces, i had to earn the right of wearing mine. I didn't buy it online.

I think my feelings are explained by the fact that everyone above me were really fucking adamant about this uniform being a symbol. It's a privilege to represent your country by wearing it. Always make sure everything looks proper. Make sure pockets are closed, because you will not look bad representing our country. Thus i get a sensation of contempt mixed with confusion when seeing this. 

I know this is probably stupid and I'm way out of line but whatever. I mean it's fine really you wear it if it makes you feel better... And also if you're in the Swedish Armed Forces then i guess that's fine, but not really because when you're playing airsoft you're a civilian and not on duty so you shouldn't be wearing it."
