Gotta love the people who would just downvote this without acknowledging it."
news,fe4xw8h,t1_fe0f01n,1578863862.0,Do you open every conversation by patting yourself on the back for not smoking weed or cigarettes?

politics,fdusmwo,t1_fdtjhkz,1578738182.0,Man I would love to believe that.  I was just reading about them having actual traction in Nevada and SC.
entertainment,fduscp4,t1_fdrd6gp,1578738046.0,You can tell it was the best picture because of the way it is.
AbandonedPorn,fdpmaqo,t1_fdpltud,1578632653.0,I mean...do they make smaller morgue refrigerators?  Is there a mini fridge equivalent?
politics,fdo4feg,t1_fdnd1p1,1578598706.0,The whole reason he’s getting a huge backing in the first place is specifically to unseat Lindsey Graham.  Otherwise people wouldn’t know or probably care who he is.  This just comes off as totally unnecessarily picky.
politics,fdncgte,t1_fdn28al,1578582817.0,Does this headline seriously read as having a pro-Lindsey Graham bias to you?

todayilearned,fdg1sfc,t1_fdfz9d1,1578376870.0,Are you thinking of the guy who did that with a bulldozer in CO?
Music,fdg063s,t1_fdfoz20,1578375299.0,I wasn’t going to upvote the post until I saw how much of a boner you were about it.  And then I did.
Music,fdg00b8,t1_fdfqlsl,1578375149.0,There’s even good country out there.  It just takes a bit more effort to sift through (at least for me).
worldnews,fd4yitw,t1_fd4pkr9,1578172404.0,"So basically the party in charge will probably replace him but remain in power until the next election cycle?  And would the Labor party taking over fix anything were they to gain a majority?  

Is it somewhat similar to the US bipartisan system where one party consists of a bunch of corrupt shitheads and the other is usually morally in the right place but doesn’t have its shit together?"
worldnews,fd4nmab,t1_fd3vvqk,1578169197.0,There have been a bunch of videos of the PM behaving like a total jackass the last week or two.  Do you think this along with how he’s handling it will lead to any real change?  Also is there any way to oust those in charge before the next election?

WTF,fcmi4xu,t1_fcm4ysw,1577776197.0,"The follow up video in which he’s getting his ass kicked doesn’t really depict him as that incoherent and unaware of his actions.  Kicking his ass wasn’t the right thing to do, but I don’t see why you’re excusing his actions as something that wasn’t his fault."
WTF,fcm2mxj,t1_fcltet9,1577762631.0,He just tried to kidnap somebody.  Who gives a fuck about his feelings?

technews,fc5ztut,t1_fc5vte2,1577469214.0,You do when you’re trying to allocate that money somewhere else and one of your primary new investments has a potential conflict of interest with your previous one.  You’re spewing a lot of crap about stuff you know nothing about.
technews,fc5uo60,t1_fc5ol43,1577466287.0,This is absurd reasoning.  Autonomous vehicles aren’t suddenly going to become ubiquitous.  That’s not why he’s dumping his stock.

sports,fbzn9ee,t1_fbzmq9y,1577252612.0,"Yeah sorry, it was missing a won’t.  You’ve been non-stop hurling a bunch of shit about me being a Russell Wilson fanboy when I don’t like the guy at all and telling me that I said passing is better when I never said that.  

I said there wasn’t a clear favorite and that the likelihood of success either way is probably within a few percentage points of each other.  That and the game theory aspect kind of make it a wash.  You haven’t really said anything to disprove that.  I’d kind of like you to go the fuck away."
