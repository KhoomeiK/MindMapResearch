'The Bind and Grind'"
unpopularopinion,ff3x66l,t1_ff3si8o,1579550799.0,"You can't make a comment on what that means if you didn't read the rest to understand why I said that. You expect me to listen to your argument but you wont even listen to mine, what a hypocrite."
unpopularopinion,ff3oosq,t1_ff3llid,1579545566.0,"That statement is worthless though because every dog has potential to be dangerous it's about situation, environment, and treatment that cause incidents to happen that idiots call 'random'.

Pitbulls have a history of purposeful mistreatment and abuse, bred to fit a certain aggressive niche, HUMANS did that. For example it's been bred to have sharper teeth to mutilate and tear vs hunting dogs bred to have soft teeth for game so if something happens it's more likely to result in a serious injury.

I have a pit mix and she's never attacked me or my family or other animals before and my cousins have one as an emotional support animal for their daughter with autism which shows you that just because they have a history doesn't mean they don't deserve a chance and a positive environment."

wholesomememes,ff3nb2t,t1_ff3gkvc,1579544716.0,"Oh I feel that, you're fine though I was honestly curious what you meant. You are right though there is truth to taking a hint for sure. I guess I just think people should work on empathy and thinking what the other person's reason for 'talking too much' or whatever is, they probably just don't have an outlet."
unpopularopinion,ff3exhp,t1_ff381js,1579539677.0,Please bring facts not your opinion based on nothing but your own cantaloupe of a cranium.
wholesomememes,ff2bbu9,t1_ff28gmf,1579499506.0,"That conversation sounded painful, but I see what you mean. I guess something that pops in my head is what if that person literally has no one else to relate to in that interest of theirs and just needs to find the correct outlet or group for that but is unloading on you in the meantime.

 Though I will say I don't think it's the listeners obligation to literally guide them or anything like that but personally I'd ask them if they ever thought about joining a facebook group, or whatever is applicable to that friend, to find people they can really engage with instead of having a conversation with someone who only has limited knowledge."
wholesomememes,ff239o3,t1_ff22bjc,1579492617.0,"I'm sorry, hopefully there are some immediate listeners present in your life too so you can kinda relax haha. Dark rooms are for 7 minutes in heaven, bring the other listener in there with you!"
wholesomememes,ff1yz1w,t1_ff1l3p8,1579489436.0,"Thank you! Communication is something interesting to work on too because it's always changing and shifting through generations.  What baffles me is just that there are redditers out there who literally think the world is filled with people who ""talk too much"" instead of people with differing interests and social awareness that deserve as much dignity and compassion as the next person."
wholesomememes,ff1x888,t1_ff1uk5h,1579488249.0,"When I said I've always had a knack for navigating conversations it's because people nowadays tell me I'm easy to talk to and have affirmed that opinion to me. Im not trying to walk around with a big ego, my employer, professors and advisors agree on that as well or I wouldn't be going into a public relations major.

I also didn't apologize EVERY time I had a conversation, that'd be exhausting Haha. When talking I used to, and still sometimes, would apologize for saying something to my boyfriend, or coworkers, or professors like just subconsciously add 'sorry' and they would literally ask me why I'm sorry and where confused. That's when I started realizing that my opinion wasn't stupid, or wrong, or unwanted it was me carrying early high school drama into my adult life. 

Like I said in that comment, theres truth to negative impacts in your life being learning moments and I did say I learned from that experience as something to help push me to learn how to be charismatic and gain that knack for talking to others."
wholesomememes,ff1v97o,t1_ff1pt94,1579486946.0,"Your logic is one person bullying is a bully, but multiple people bullying are a support group?

The point that the comic is making is that you should treat people with respect and dignity because people will carry that shit with them for the rest of their lives and sometimes don't even notice the ramifications on their self esteem, like me. This is especially important regarding kids because their social constructs ARE their entire life and what shape them. You can think someone talks to much, that's your opinion, but it's your CHOICE to be an asshole about it or not."

wholesomememes,ff13kn2,t1_ff10119,1579474847.0,"That's very true, life is full of lessons, but I wasn't ranting or breaking social norms (I would say I was and am an average guy) I was just responding and that was what I would get slapped with. Im currently finishing a degree related to communications because those experiences helped me cultivate good speech and speaking habits for sure but also because I've always had a knack for navigating conversations and enjoy it. I totally vibe with what you're saying though, you never stop growing and that's how you learn but not just how to talk to people but the kinda people you want to talk to.

What's interesting to me is you refer to people being polite to others as 'people not caring about social norms' when the social norm should be politeness and kindness not shame."
wholesomememes,ff10vkr,t1_ff0wxba,1579474124.0,"I understand that it can be annoying for people but it's on the person who is annoyed to do something about it, and hopefully be polite about it as well. I'd rather assume someone doesn't understand that they're talking ""too much"" than assume that they're being purposefully annoying but I guess that's kinda glass half full mentality."
wholesomememes,ff0x3ct,t1_ff0p3za,1579473126.0,I feel like if anyone could accurately represent the epitome of being unable to move on or change with the times it's a ghost.

wholesomememes,ff0wf1a,t3_er27i7,1579472912.0,"This hit me right in the feels man. In highschool I would be circled up with my group of friends and chime in on whatever was being discussed  and about half way through whatever i was saying someone would always cut me off and say ""Wow, you're still talking?"" I didn't realize how fucked up that was or how much it fucked me up until an ex of mine once said that I didn't need to apologize literally every time I added my opinion to something or talked to someone and I realized how that really affected me. 

Thanks OP for the reminder that your opinion is valuble so never suppress what makes you unique especially for ""friends""."
worldnews,ff0tvmt,t3_eqymf7,1579472256.0,"To be fair, I'm not a trump fan, but the idea of political figures or other prominent members needing to look good on television started with Nixon and Kennedy right? I feel like picking them solely because their television potential isn't the best way to decide but by no means a dumb reason to pick someone in this day and age."

TikTokCringe,fewmqjl,t1_fewh4sx,1579414947.0,"The point that mortified the students presumably wasn't the fact that she had a bowel movement, but that it wasn't confined to the toilet bowl. Like I don't support the bullying either but clean up after yourself goddammit."
millionairemakers,fesbwa1,t3_eq81a8,1579363656.0,Good luck to everyone and hopefully someone can get the new year started a bit better than expected!
science,fdqjxjl,t1_fdqhxkm,1578668480.0,"I think it's considered more catastrophic because of humanity's role in climate change. Theres a debate in the scientific community around whether or not humans are obligated to be shepards to the rest of life and protect it on earth vs. Allowing the cycles to continue (kinda as you're stating) because that is the natural order right? Well the main pushback on that is, once again, because many issues in our environment have been caused, exaggerated, or facilitated by human involvement, interaction, and emigration."
news,fdlc5iq,t1_fdl98gu,1578520878.0,"Yes the way that america views and handles immigrants is top notch and thank goodness we openly denounced Iran's and other countries actions of killing gay people. I don't think we should get praise for being the landing place for asylum seekers. Its asinine to ask someone to solve a geopolitical issue between two powers but I assume you understand that as well, my best answer personally would be that the world should be acknowledging what's happening and working to deescalate by placing sanctions and making deals to fix the current issues and work to further a peaceful future. We shouldn't be working toward hegemony or dominance we should be working toward understanding through things like anthropology and sociology so we can better educate others while still showing that we can respect their people and culture. It all is a lot to ask and seems fantastical but it's possible if countries would work together as a unit of leadership instead of fractal into weaker voices. I feel like I understand your position on this and sympathise with parts but I just don't think that violence will ever be able to destroy ideas."
news,fdl7b0z,t1_fdl4t85,1578518261.0,"Its presumptuous to assume that killing him will do anything major to stop terrorism or hinder it considering there are more scared, angry, and upset people willing to join their cause in retaliation. I'm not trying to say that killing a terrorist wont lower the amount of terrorists or set them back a step but do you think that the best plan to combat terrorism is to bomb every suspected or known terrorist? That seems short sighted to me, as does just accepting that countries all over the world have weapons of mass destruction with the sole purpose of cataclysm and we shouldn't be doing anything to continue to denuclearize. The shortsighted issues are important, yeah we killed a terrorist but once again the president undermined his own government, proved once again America can't do anything without violence and brash actions. Dude I'm gay, it pissed me off when they started killing gays to purge their country as it should piss everyone off, but the solution  isn't bomb everyone who killed someone for being gay it should be to assist and work to evacuate gay men and educate the community but America has done neither of those things. People aren't going to just change their beliefs overnight but if you bomb them you can assure that theyll only grow to resent and fear vs. Understand and listen."
news,fdl3qbw,t1_fdkb4mv,1578516536.0,"I'm not saying I know what the future would be but I am saying that even if that is the case randomly bombing that general did what to solve  anything? We already live in a world of nukes thanks to the US and it should then be our responsibility to pave the way for denuclearization. Deals and nations coming together to create peace and share progressive ideas should be our goal as a country, not to create chaos and sew discord in the global community like randomly bombing a general to a foreign nation, knowing they'll be unable to let that stand, and not even alerting your own government know let alone our (dwindling) allies."
news,fdjb288,t1_fdimj4c,1578463827.0,"I mean he started it either way, you can agree with the justification for the killing but you HAVE to admit that randomly bombing a senior advisor in the Iranian government in this political climate is idiotic and honestly putting American lives in jeopardy of another war they have no stake in.

We were working toward peace with Iran and now here we are waiting for possible war, all for what reason? We literally had a road to peace paved and ready."

unpopularopinion,fdf3pbb,t3_ekz026,1578352597.0,"I don't think people are rallying behind Iranian generals or Iran in a nationalist sense, if anything people are standing up for the global community and due process. If the president of the US can just start bombing whoever he wants without communication with our allies or even his own government officials then he is stepping out of bounds. Terrorists and dictators do that kind of shit and an act of aggression obviously can't just go unchecked by Iran and the rest of the globe.

 If our embassy was being attacked we should move to protect our people and evac them, not escalate the conflict at this point because we get ZERO benefit from it. Now there is global and political unrest and we've pushed ourselves further from our allies by showing them we are unpredictable and brash."
