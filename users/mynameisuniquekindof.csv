AmItheAsshole,ffb4kp8,t1_ff9m8zq,1579751627.0,The alternative is dumping him when she realized she didn't want to be with him. Instead she waited till she had a replacement. So thats not an asshole move?

TrueOffMyChest,ffauf07,t3_eshpm5,1579744729.0,"Not the same but when I was in 5th grade my crush asked me out, I panicked and said I'd tell her my answer tomorrow. On my way out of school another kid told me ""she doesn't like you its just a joke"". It hurt so much. Like ridiculously (I was an emotiinal little kid lol). I took it as fact, and wasn't sure to trust the girl. 

In the end I believed the guy over my crush. He was lying in the end but by the time I realized it was too late.

Its funny that that one thing has stayed with me all my life. I'm nearly 30 and honestly every girl whos ever been interested in me, I still secretly question if its a joke. Which I know is crazy, but I just can never shake it."

Honestly I can see how your bf might be a bit annoying but I don't think he sounds bad at all. He sounds like a nice guy and telling him to act more reserved is probably going to make him feel pretty shitty. I'd leave it alone, its Jake's issue."

This request is weird. I feel like its kinda pure objectification, like he wants some eye candy for him and the boys lol. If you don't like being a pretty object, you should do and wear the things you want. Its so very simple...

offmychest,ff4flcz,t3_erhisj,1579562431.0,"I think online dating and social media has made it easier to cheat. Which in turn tempts more people, which means more people will inevitably cheat which causes them to rationalize their own behaviour by downplaying the severity of cheating. 

Also related is how online dating is set up in such a way to encourage people to always be chasing ""better"". Adding further to temptation.

As someone whos been cheated on in the past I think the behaviour is fucking appalling."

relationship_advice,ff1xazi,t3_eqyzb6,1579488299.0,"It probably feels this way because its what you are to him. I've had this happen in relationships and its usually when one I realize the girls personality sucks, but we still are sexually compatible. So we naturally default to sex being the main factor until the relationship implodes due to lack of *real* connection.
