We loop a bit here. I was speculating that the school created the news by deciding to charge money for the video.

I don't think the mother asked for the video with the intent of releasing it, but did so once she realised that the school would charge money for the video, which the school did, because the school thought that the mother would go to the media with the video.

Ah shit man, it's not that important. I just hope the school reviews it's handling of such cases and stops bullying proactively from now on."

There is the answer to your question.

How? You might ask yourself, to which I may answer that if you pray silently as you'd do in any other public space then from the outside no one can know what the fuck you're doing.

You could think about how you fapped to furry porn an hour ago, or you could pray to good for a good day, or you could solve a riddle, or you could invent a new product, you could try to think how to talk to your crush, you could try to find excuses for not having five your homework, ....
