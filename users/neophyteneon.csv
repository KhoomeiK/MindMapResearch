ftm,ffai57i,t3_eqzr0c,1579736287.0,"ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. My local consent clinic provides free bloodwork, appointments, and does shots for you, and if you're healthy will give you a prescription the day of your first appointment. Before you see the doctor you talk to a representative who goes over: your transition so far, your surgery plans, your name and gender marker change/plans, your mental health, suicide and self harm, what changes you're looking for EXACTLY (not just masculinization, what specific traits you want), telling you what changes are to be expected, going over all possible complications and how they will be resolved in the future (talking about estrogen cream, hystos, etc), ask about binding habits and your general knowledge of trans specific health... everything under the sun to determine what you know, what you need to know, and giving you that information. 

This is how literally all day of clinics I've ever seen work to prevent liability issues. Seems fine to me.

Compared to my doctor when I was 17 who made me cry and refused to give me a prescription until I was taking my RITALIN daily for two months to prove I wasnt a crazy ADHD-induced tranny (???????) even after having a legal name change and being in gender therapy for several years.... almost nothing on T is irreversible. Theres no reason to gatekeep life saving medication with the right doctors providing education."

mypartneristrans,fehj2g7,t3_ep5zss,1579117560.0,"I'm not a woman! But I've heard from many trans women, including my ex girlfriend, that something they struggle with is the ""script"" assigned to PIV sex. Theres something very masculinizing about playing the role of ""person who penetrates"", even for women, and especially trans women who are sensitive to it.

My ex's favorite position when she was 'topping' were things where I had control of the situation and was the one doing most of the active movements. You're being very considerate and kind here about making sex fun for both of you- sex doesnt have to just be penetration though! Girls love vibrators...  all girls, and there's plenty of those you could share. Mutual masturbation is a thing too, and it's really fun with the right partner- you know yourself and your body best, and so does she. 

Watch some lesbian porn ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è good tips and tricks for more subtle things like what kind of compliments to give, where to touch her that isnt just genital focused, etc... Porn featuring trans women is often performative and fetishistic and therefore recreating the stuff in it isnt always what most women want. I dont know if this is something you do already, but honestly just using female language for her genitals can be so much more relaxing. You all know what she has, but using words that dont ping in her brain with a different association can really change things. 

Just focus on what makes you both feel good, dont let yourself be limited by traditional PIV sex, make sure BOTH of you can communicate what words, feelings, or ideas you love or dont like so much, and encourage her to get to know her body better in her own time so she can share with you. Also amateur porn. It really can be helpful lmao.
