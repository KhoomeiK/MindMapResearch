I always like to fancy myself as an unbiased source, etc. etc., but I wonder if I’m also just a liberal cuck who’s leaning way too far into left bullshit when I should be thinking independently."
funny,fezmbgn,t1_fezk2vk,1579458949.0,Came here to say this and someone already did. I feel this way about the Kardashians and I’d rather not know they even existed. At least I’m wishing these two the very best.

tumblr,fdhsjni,t1_fdhoz46,1578429351.0,"This bums me out a lot because I’m scared I was that girl to someone. It’s not like I was super popular. I actually was part of the “nerd herd” at my school. But of them, I guess some of the boys liked me. Anyway in 8th grade a boy “asked me out” and I think I was just tickled that someone liked me and said yes. But people started being really mean to me at lunch and stuff, and after a day or so I didn’t want to put up with it anymore. It wasn’t like we were in love or anything, I just liked that a boy liked me. Anyway, I wound up “breaking up” with him less than a week into the whole thing and I still feel mean about the entire experience. He seems successful and happy now (I follow him on twitter lol) but I always wonder if he thinks of me as that bitch from 8th grade."
bulletjournal,fdh5b0s,t1_fdgwtf4,1578415696.0,"That’s a good suggestion, I’ll definitely give that a shot. Thanks!!"
bulletjournal,fdgv94y,t1_fdgu9b8,1578409177.0,"Yeah and to be honest that doesn’t even count the fact that I think it makes me crazy. I feel less in control of my emotions and mood swings when I’m on it. I originally had a man who was my gynecologist and I thought switching to a woman would help a lot of my problems, but I feel like I’m always trying to prove that I actually have issues. It might be time to find another practice altogether. I’m glad that you have such a caring doctor, if you’re lucky they’ll be an age that your daughter could use them as well when she needs so you know she’s getting good care!"
bulletjournal,fdgtcc4,t1_fdgsu9u,1578407807.0,"Yeah, thank you, that’s good advice and I am looking for a new one. I’m just not confident my next one will necessarily be great either so I want to be backed with data! But you’re definitely right about not staying with one who doesn’t seem to respect my concerns."
bulletjournal,fdgrurj,t1_fdgpncm,1578406708.0,"Oh wow I’m sorry that’s your experience. I actually want to start a tracker like this because when I take the pill I just bleed almost every day, but my doctor doesn’t seem to care and keeps telling me it will eventually regulate. I want to gather proof that another method might be better for me. Best of luck with whatever contraceptive you’re using lol"
bulletjournal,fdgpfo2,t1_fdgp88g,1578404814.0,"Is that pill meaning like Plan B? I’m confused because I take my pill much more than you seem to indicate. The tracker seems great by the way, I plan to rip this off in my bullet journal ☺️"
mildlyinteresting,fdgosl4,t1_fdg3emk,1578404285.0,"Him and his best friend are mad at Trey right now cause they think his recent stuff sucks. The only show I’ve been to was in Camden this summer and I thought it was awesome. But I can’t imagine going to 30 of them, like he has haha"
mildlyinteresting,fdgopvv,t1_fdfkq3k,1578404221.0,He would have been 9. So probably too young to be there but honestly I’m not sure when he started listening

Volumeeating,fdeol1i,t3_ekxnze,1578343376.0,"Do you have any substitution suggestions for the olives? I just don’t like them, but you mentioned they were one of the more calorie heavy items, so I wouldn’t just want to leave them out completely."
mildlyinteresting,fdejrua,t1_fdejpb6,1578340513.0,Thanks I was really happy with how they turned out!

cats,fd3c1dy,t1_fd3b8k5,1578156815.0,Thank you! I worry I sound a bit like a “crazy cat lady” but I just wanted to make sure I wasn’t being mean to them or anything 😅
cats,fd3bvk9,t1_fd3b17z,1578156768.0,"That seems awesome! Do you have problems with your cats attacking the actual piece? I used to have a swan water bowl, my cats LOVE running water, but they don’t get to have it anymore because they wouldn’t stop disassembling they actual bowl when I wasn’t around to stop them."
cats,fd3bmve,t1_fd3a7v6,1578156684.0,Thank you! I heard on a podcast once (I don’t remember which one) a cat owner mentioning it was important that they’re able to catch something at the end of that kind of play and I’ve been irrationally worried about it being a “mean” thing to do with them ever since. Especially because my girl gets hyper focused on finding it for a while after it’s disappeared. I really appreciate the reassurance!!
cats,fd3b482,t3_ejyrjl,1578156490.0,"I have the exact same situation! Two rescue kittens from last July, so it sounds like they’re a bit older than yours. After I got Oscar (the bigger boy) fixed, it remedied a lot of those situations. Sometimes however they still get too rough for Tucker (the smaller girl’s) liking. I have noticed that Tucker seems to be much more of the “alpha” cat, in that she is very much in charge despite her much smaller size. When I’m home I break it up if they get too rough, but I’m not too concerned that it’s happening a lot when I’m not around. It’s definitely a behavior that they’ve been growing out of. I try to think that it’s the same as me and my siblings — play could sometimes turn mean by accident and would need to be broken up, but we got older and grew out of it. I would say you should intervene (I use a pillow) for the fights you’re around for to make it known it’s not an okay behavior. But they should be able to kind of teach each other what’s appropriate, and what’s too rough for play. If it gets worse, it might be out of the scope of what I can speak to. (Just in case it’s not clear, I’m on my first ever set of cats so I’m no expert. I just wanted to share the experience I’ve had, and it doesn’t seem to be a problem you need to worry about too much!)"
bulletjournal,fczqm83,t1_fcyy3c7,1578106906.0,Came here to say this! I hope this time next year I have something similar.

pics,fcu6xug,t1_fcoe4no,1577974025.0,"I am near a wildlife preserve, but with the culling that was mentioned, that could also mean I’m near hunters. So really what you’re suggesting is very possible"
pics,fco90p4,t1_fco259s,1577826486.0,"Oh wow. I don’t hunt at all, so I guess there’s a lot I don’t know about it. Thanks, that would make sense."

bulletjournal,fcn79vl,t1_fcmzqin,1577805116.0,You have a good attitude about it. I should just stop expecting perfection in a day to day journal. I just get caught up in some of the near-perfect spreads posted on here!
