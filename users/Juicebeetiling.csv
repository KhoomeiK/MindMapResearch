People don't like the image he puts out relating to Ireland it doesn't represent Irish people well and yet we'll get associated the more popular he is. Then there's the fact that he pretty much is a giant prick when he is back home and has been in and out of court for various stupid things. I don't like him personally, on the other hand I can sort of understand that he needs to be outrageous on top of a good fighter to get where he got in the UFC. Easiest way of dealing with it is to ignore it alltogether. The way we put people down here for trying to stand out is like crabs in a bucket and it can be pretty as fuck."

Mordhau,fejq7yt,t1_fejoil2,1579183061.0,"Regular axe, you have to stay on your toes when you see someone like this because they usually have bloodlust, staying out of range to make them miss their swing when they turn to you is a good start but you can still be caught off guard by how fast they can move with light armour and perks like rush. If you manage to stay out of range you can probably stab them in the back as they try and spin around to your next teammate.

 The thing this player is doing is called target switching, as they hit the person infront of them they're paying attention to what's going on around them so when a greedy player rushes in to try get a free hit they use the riposte from the first guy to suddenly attack the person off to their side. 

Tl;Dr keep your guard up and be ready to party, keep your distance, maybe you can bait them into missing by running at them as if you're about to swing then back off."

Mordhau,febh47g,t1_feb8x0k,1578958715.0,"That's assuming you don't meet an Archer that's a good shot. You actually give archers time to get more shots off when you try to dodge and weave side to side. Its probably better for you to just run straight at them if you're confident enough to parry their arrows, when that happens to me I've maybe hit them once, they start charging me and if I try wait out their party I'm giving them free ground in exchange for that extra 34 dmg. Then it's cleaver time. 

Or they try zig zag like they're a mime in a pinball machine and they barely gain any ground while I plug them with arrows.
