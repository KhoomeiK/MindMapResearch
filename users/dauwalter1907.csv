No matter who our eventual candidate is, we will have much bigger battles to fight if we’re going to overcome the broken electoral system that has twice granted the office to a truly harmful candidate over the winner of the popular vote. Bush and Trump were and are bad for the people and bad for the environment. It was the DNC who did as much to get them elected as the RNC by their undermining of progressive candidates generally in favor of weak centrists."

TooAfraidToAsk,fe5nnli,t1_fe4xqe2,1578871886.0,"Thanks for the interesting response. Jill Lepore also writes about the complexities of this part of American history in her book In These Truths. What’s confusing is that Christianity per se was neither pro- nor anti- slavery. It was a cultural practice that pre-dates Christianity, flows through it and transcends it. There have been Christians throughout history that took slavery for granted as part of God’s ordained order of things, and others at least as far back as the 15th century who thought it an abomination. It’s a perfect example of the frailty of belief."

ElizabethWarren,fe5knuy,t1_fe5evmd,1578870655.0,"Right. I’m continually amazed that we’re in a campaign in which there are TWO candidates that I can feel good about supporting. It’s in the nature of political campaigns for this sort of petty sideline squabbling to happen. We have to take the long view and support progressive candidates overall. You may have to sacrifice on the finer points because in the end it’s about progressive policies, and Biden does not have them. Wouldn’t even know them if they hit him in the face."

If either of them wins the nomination it’s going to be very important for progressive voters not to deny their vote to the other candidate out of spite. Happily, both Warren and Sanders seem to recognize this. There may be no better time to not only remove the pustule in the White House but to also elect a democratic leader who isn’t just a pale imitation of a republican, i.e., Biden, Bloomberg, Streyer."

We all swallow our deepest feelings sometimes to maintain relationships with friends and loved ones and to simply function in civil society. And thank your chosen deity we do.
