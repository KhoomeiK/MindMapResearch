jobs,fdxn4np,t3_emmzrk,1578770852.0,As you didnâ€™t sign any contract I think you can still fix it when talking with  the recruiter or manager. I made the same mistake and signed the damn contract and now I get paid minimum wage. I felt very dumb but I was desperate for money and job. However you seem early in the application process so you can definitely still fix it.

jobs,fd1nflf,t3_ejuc7s,1578133801.0,"If you feel being an English teacher in Japan will be manageable and pay your rent etc in long term then do it. 
Meanwhile try and build your own freelance work from home (building pcs etc) and sell them online or something along those lines. So then you have a stable job and a freelance job that may or may not work out but at least you have tried. 

I know it is hard after you tried so hard and hope seems minimal. But if I were you I would do the above. Stick to an ok job at teaching for now then outside working hours work on your passions. 

All the best and goodluck"

Last year we went distance relationship because I moved countries for work but then came back to live with him after a year. We still strong and in love. It will be 5 years in February that we have been together."
askgaybros,fc566u9,t3_efhzlo,1577445260.0,Donâ€™t listen to the  bad comments about your mum here. Your parents must have had some personal issues hence your mum has reacted that way. Perhaps she feels your dad doesnâ€™t really know her for some reason and she blew up that day. It must have been a deep relationship issue between them that has being going on for some time. I know itâ€™s hard for you but try not to judge your mum and blame her. Keep away from their issues and hope for the best.

Unemployed,fbgfd08,t1_fafiqqx,1576847697.0,"Thank you for your honest advice. I had my cv redone by someone and I started to get calls. I guess my old cv wasnâ€™t selling myself to my true potential. Iâ€™m on interview stages, have 2 interviews and another one which Iâ€™m waiting for feedback.  just hope to get a job by next month. 
May I ask you how did you end up in USA ?"
