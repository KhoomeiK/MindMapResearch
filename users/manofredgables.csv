Metalfoundry,ff73xk1,t3_ervasx,1579640628.0,"Have you fired it up yet? I'm thinking no and I'm also thinking you're in for a disappointment. Mineral wool isn't gonna last even one burn. It loses its structural integrity at like 400°C and promptly melts at 900°. Even if you only do aluminum at <700° your furnace will definitely hit >1000°, not least anywhere close to the flame. You'll just end up with a soggy mess of glass with that insulation.

As to your question, a ceramic/clay brick might work passably as a floor in the furnace. They are usually yellow or terracotta colored, and with no visible pebbles or sand in them. What you're talking about sounds like concrete bricks. Concrete turns to dust at >400-500 ish degrees. Since it's the floor, that might actually not matter too much, as you'll eventually have a layer of dust thick enough to insulate the cured concrete below. I can't guess how thick this layer will end up being though, so decide for yourself if it sounds okay.

With either kind of brick you'll need to ensure it is 100% free of moisture before you heat them to furnace temps. If you dont, they'll either spall themselves to shards, crack or explode from the internal steam buildup.

Your performance will also suffer from using a massive brick. Its mass will swallow and steal a lot of heat, and its lack of insulative properties will conduct a lot of heat away. This can get pretty annoying.

Decide for yourself based on the above facts, but I think it'd be easy for you to do better. Being on the floor means there are very small structural requirements. My furnace floor is made up of accumulated slag, sand, oxides and kitty litter. Works just fine. Plaster+sand would probably work pretty well here.

Probably lucky, yeah. There's a very strong genetic component in addiction. Some people just get addicted to anything and everything and can't help themselves, some don't need to make an effort even to quit fucking heroin.

I'm in your camp here. I have no problems smoking a bit at a party occasionally and then forgetting about it. Sure, I'll feel a slight addictive pull, but I can easily ignore it. I've done prescription benzos, tobacco, and long stretches of alcohol consumption, arguably some of the most addictive substances, and none have been hard to quit.

AskReddit,feymj9c,t1_feygzie,1579447603.0,">But to just tell people that the only reason you like them is that the nicotine has you hooked and making you BELIEVE that its other things is a little ridiculous.

Ah but I didn't. Of course it's not *only* that. There's all kinds of complex psychological stuff happening too. 

But see, what cigarettes do to your mind is that the sudden rush of nicotine activates all kinds of reward systems in your brain. It's hotwiring itself straight into ""this is good""-areas. Everyone's entire existence is dedicated to doing things to generate that response in the brain. Food, sex, socializing, it all boils down to that.

After getting all that feel-good, your subconscious will do its best to try and figure out what you did and find patterns to it. Anything out of the ordinary that you do when smoking, your subconscious will to some degree define as good. Smoking puts you in all sorts of out-of-the-ordinary situations, since you usually can't do it indoors for example. That's a pretty big reason smokers really appreciate getting away from a party or whatever and standing outdoors and just contemplating stuff. I get that, and I'm certainly not trying devalidate that those things really are nice, because I totally agree. It can just be hard to realize that your subconscious is making you feel that way to get more nicotine for it.

I smoke the occasional cigarette too(<3 cigarettes per year occasional), because it can really put a silver lining on anything. Never gotten hooked, but I've always felt its pull after those times."
AskReddit,feykm50,t1_feycxnt,1579446836.0,"Euch yeah that one is horrible. I've smoked several cigarettes over the years without picking up the habit, but I did feel and recognize the addiction and craving starting after even just one cig. 

Last year I chose to start doing Snus. I say chose specifically because it was a conscious decision to start. Having ADHD, I thankfully accept anything which can make my brain more behaved. 

As it turns out, nicotine is a pretty great chemical! It's a stimulant, antidepressant and has long term protective benefits for the brain among many other things. In the form of cigarettes it's horrible for your health as everyone knows, but snus has about as much hazards as coffee has. It hasn't been linked to any serious conditions at all. The worst thing it'll do is *maybe* cause gum disease, but even that is far from a certainty. 

So far I'm only seeings benefits. It's addictive, yeah, but my stance on addiction differs from most others. Addiction can be a good thing, if the substance isn't harmful. Like, I could do without coffee in my life, it doesn't really contribute to anything, and it's certainly addictive as fuck. I tried quitting once due to stomach issues, and god damn my brain pulled all sorts of shit to get me to drink some coffee. But having a cup of coffee when you're really craving it is so *nice*.

* Use peck drilling. Just drill a small distance, then go up to clear all the chips. This reduces the chip issue.

* Lock your z axis as tight as possible and lower it slowly and controlled. Don't let the drill bit drag the z axis down and dig in.

If you do want to grind them or shape, just get diamond tools. Then you can cut literally anything in existence. Dremel diamond bits aren't expensive at all, or use diamond files and saws for tile work. Just remember that diamond does not tolerate heat.

Regardless of how you choose to deal with this, I highly recommend that you learn to sharpen drill bits. Once you've got the hang of it takes literally 10 seconds or less with any bench grinder. I buy cheap crap drills and for every hole in anyhing harder than aluminum, or if I need a hole with some precision, I sharpen the bit before. A freshly sharpened cheap drill bit usually cuts just as nice as an expensive one, it just lasts shorter.

Plus, once you understand drill cutting geometry, you can easily customize the bit for the material and hole you're cutting. Most obviously this applies to brass and bronze, but there are other tricks in that bag which can change how the drill bites, self centers etc."

I have an 1800 W drill. It does not stop for anything. Your entire body will be flying around its axis before it stops. I have sprained my shoulders, elbows, back and wrist simultaneously once when a spade bit caught on a knot.

I also frequently use a milling machine which is 400 w. It starts struggling a little when milling aluminum with more than 14 mm bits. As for drilling, any material is zero problems with drill bits <13 mm. Drilling thick aluminum with a stepdrill starts bogging it down a little at around 20 mm.

No shit? Huh. Really? It's DC? Well I stand corrected. So how does that work? Torch is positive and work piece is negative then? Because I can't imagine you could weld aluminum without the ""cleaning"" action. I guess you don't do DC on TIG for alu because it'd annihilate the tungsten tip then?

>DC TIG is used for most metals that can be welded -- steels, titanium, copper, nickel-based alloys, etc. The exceptions are the ones that use AC (like aluminum and magnesium).

True, yeah. Only the super oxidizing metals need AC. I'm just stuck in my mind thinking aluminum and steel is all that exists sometimes.

>Not always true, actually. The Miller Diversion and Hobart EZ-TIG are TIG-only (no switchable polarity and non-standard torch/ground connections), so if you wanted to stick weld with them you'd have to figure out a way to jury-rig it a little.

metalworking,fde3c8z,t3_ekw7ma,1578330257.0,"**Stick:**

Pros: 

* The welder is cheap, the only operating cost is welding rods which are also dirt cheap.
* Learning to stick weld gives you a good understanding of the weld process, and learning other weld processes from there is easier.
* It's pretty forgiving and robust. Didn't clean up the part properly? Bunch of rust and grime left? It's gone now, the welder ate it and everything's fine.

Cons:

* It's hopeless to do fine/small work with it. Don't expect to be able to weld anything thinner than 2 mm.
* It's dirty and messy. Sparks and smokes a lot, and then you have to chip away slag pieces that go everywhere everywhere.
* Not a good choice for welding stainless, aluminum or other exotic metals. It *can* be done, but chances are it'll go all sorts of wrong and look like crap.

**MIG**

Pros:

* It's by far the easiest to operate for a newbie. If you just want to stick metal stuff together, you barely even need to know how to weld. Just point it in the general direction of the joint and push the trigger.

* Good for most applications, thin or thick. If you buy one with AC output it'll weld most metals. DC does mostly steel.

* Fast. Just pick it up and go nuts.

Cons:

* You may not ever learn how to properly weld. It's kinda *too* easy.

* Uses welding gas, which depending on how you source it is more or less expensive. Though I think you can cheap out on the gas if you use flux core wire. It looks like shit though.

**TIG**

Pros:

* The ultimate welder. If it can be welded, it can be welded with a TIG. If it's AC. DC is for steel only(exceptions exist)

* Clean as fuck. No sparks. No smoke. No mess.

* Pretty welds, once you get good at it.

* Can weld extremely fine/thin parts.

* Also functions as a stick welder if need be.

Cons:

* Some say it's difficult to learn. I disagree though. It just takes longer to get *really* good at it.

* Usually more expensive than the other types. Requires non-optional welding gas. The tungsten tips are also consumables and not super cheap.

* You may need some extra equipment such as a tungsten tip grinder.

* Is a little slow. A joint that takes 10 seconds with a stick or MIG might take a minute with a TIG.

* Can be a little picky with cleanliness. Oil residue and other crap is not tolerated, and will make things really difficult for you.

If I bought a welder today, I'd go for an AC/DC TIG with HF start."

>You need one with super low self-capacitance for that kind of voltage pulse though, and your HV pulse generator would need to have super low inductance to actually get it on the output line.

And to get super low capacitance and high enough inductance, I assume you make a really big one with some separation between turns?

>Your approach is correct, but it sounds like you haven't fully considered the parasitics in play, or how to get around them just yet.

I think so too. The trick is to find an approach where important specs don't need to be fulfilled by shitty home made things. A thrown together inductor may not have ideal parasitic attributes for example. :)

>I guess theoretically the method with the least parasitic capacitance would be to slip a bunch of powdered iron inductor cores onto a straight cable - but commercial units don't seem to require this approach, so perhaps you can do more investigation into this path without going to extremes ;) 

I could do that. Nothing wrong with extremes as long as it's not of the expensive kind lol. I have a golden rule for homemade stuff: if you can't make it efficient, just make it big. Making things impractically large has a way of making them work better and simpler. 

I have doubts that would be enough inductance. I've tried with IIRC 50 mH inductors and still the pulse was swallowed. It was a shitty test done on  the fly so I can't say for sure. Hmmm, but they were air core solenoids, which I suppose would be just about the worst thing when it comes to capacitance? Maybe that's the key to why that approach didn't work out.

Edit: The cores going onto the cable should be the lossy kind, right? Like, ferrite beads? I've understood that there are two main types of ferrite cores: those that are meant to conduct flux and ideally have 0 eddy currents, and those that are meant to suppress EMI and actively consume energy. 

How would for example a solid steel or iron tube work here? My gut feeling says poorly, but I can't quite put my finger on why powdered would be better. Don't we *want* it to short itself out? What am I not considering here...?"

>The choke (with bypass caps before it) is simpler but has the downside that the HV generator has to get all the way to final voltage, I remember one design that used an air cored choke about 9 inches in diameter with all the layers spaced with wooden dowels (1960s cinema lamphouse, old school but it worked just fine). 

I think that downside is okay. I've made a HV generator that I estimate puts out about 60 kV at up to 5 mA, so it's got quite a bit of oomph. I guess making a simple plate capacitor for that might work well. Just need to figure out how to control it. Maybe some sparkgap thing.

>The series injection transformer has voltage gain, so hitting it with only a kV or so is sufficient.
>
>In both cases the secondary will be FAT wire, but as all the action is up above 100kHz you don't need many turns.

Hmm. I guess this could work well for a more continuous action thing, as 1 kV could be pwmed by a fairly simple transistor arrangement.

>See if there is a company that deals with cinema projection in your area, and ask for a series injection ignition transformer for a Xenon lamp (Specify your desired current rating, these are an off the shelf part). 

Nah. While I do need one, the main reason I do these things is because I lack knowledge to do it and I crave to understand it. I won't be satisfied until I 100% understand why my previous attempts haven't worked, and I know all the outs and ins of it. Only once I've pulled off making one myself would I consider buying one, but then ideally I won't need one. :) Thanks for the suggestion though, I'll keep it in mind."
