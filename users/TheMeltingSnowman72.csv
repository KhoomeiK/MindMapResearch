A little native American boy goes up to the chief and asks now they all got their names. He responds by telling him that when his sister was born, they looked out the tee-pee and saw the wind blowing through the tall grass, that's why she's called Blowing Tall Grass, when his brother was born they looked out the Tee-Pee and saw a buffalo grazing in the meadow, so that's why he's called Grazing Buffalo.

""Do you have any more questions, Two Dogs Fucking?""

Edit: I've just remembered a similar one. A little disabled boy goes up to his father and asks now they got their names. Father says well your big sister is called Rose, because a rose petal floated down onto mummys tummy while she was pregnant.
