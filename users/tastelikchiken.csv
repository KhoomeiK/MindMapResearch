NetworkingJobs,fehfth4,t1_feh77vu,1579115657.0,"That's true I can watch the videos and all that on it I was wondering if there are like simulations or whatever I guess. Like I really want to learn Cisco's new DNA Center, but have no way of learning it hands on really."
NetworkingJobs,feh6fc9,t1_fanlaja,1579110118.0,"That's interesting, would you be willing to share that? Obv with information redacted, trying to see what other network engineers' resumes look like because some of these positions that I am applying for that are looking for network engineers have tons of shit I have never worked on before."
AskReddit,feeurpu,t1_feejh8j,1579041656.0,"You could do 2 every hour when you got home from work (assuming 5-6pm) sleep at midnight, wake at 630-7 and be just fine.

Your BAC when you went to bed would be around .12-15, over the limit with maybe a twinge of a hangover but nothing horrible."

worldnews,fdikuuj,t1_fdijkba,1578445154.0,"They've also donated to reform, I know Kanye donated around 1M last year but that's not really the point I'm trying to make. I just think it's weird when a celebrity does X people will criticize others for not donating or contributing to the same cause when they very well may be contributing to another organization that the first celebrity never contributed. Kind of convoluted but what I'm trying to boil it down to is this, if someone does something good for the world don't use it as a pedestal to attack those who haven't done good because they may have done good in another aspect of society.

With that said, yes Kanye West is fucking insane and all of his music is great except his newest album and I will go to my grave with this disclaimer."

worldnews,fdii00n,t1_fdhsjdq,1578443352.0,Yeah clearing wrongly convicted felons isn't important. Fuck out of here it doesn't matter how much any celebrity donates it will never be enough until they're no longer rich enough to be mentioned.

trashy,fdfcueq,t1_fdfbapp,1578358691.0,"Nah I really like Jesus Walks, the lyrics are straight and it's an actual good song. His newest album is shit dude. Like none of the songs are anywhere near as good as Jesus Walks or even Ultralight beam. He is for sure abusing this Christianity thing for money. Or he's delusional I'd give it 50/50."
gaming,fdf62xt,t1_fdepy55,1578354150.0,"I think Oblivion had the best quests and guilds in general. Combat was by far the worst, but the magic in Skyrim was just awful. Then the stealth Archer made every other class obsolete."
