The cop was fired and charged, therefore all the use of force boxes were not checked.

Is this not what you meant?"

The industry solved that minor annoyance ages ago.  If you can't patent the product, patent the process.  Colchicine wasn't patentable, either.

Ask them where they are getting their pharmaceutical grade shit, and what they had to sign away to get it.

To answer your question, I think concealed carry is recommended for anyone not in marked uniform because the dude doing the recommending is not an advocate of open carry.  I also think both sides of that debate is wrong because the answer depends on the circumstances.

Anyway, never mind my comment.  Conceal was a bad choice of words and it was too far out of context anyway.  Not as far out as a gangland shootout in the slums of rio, but still too far out."
