The length of Lake Michigan is 307 miles. 
We can see maybe the length of four on the drawing. If you were to look optimally at your triangle, maybe you could fit a fifth lake. 
1500 miles you can see. 
The slide is slightly tilted, so slightly off right. 89.99 degrees.  

A=1500 miles 
Right angle +two 45 degree angles from the most advantageous viewpoint. 

*Triangle calculator.com uses Pythagorean theorem *

Slide is approx 2121 miles tall

This is the medium earth orbit near communication satellites. 

At the rate of 1 rung every second while moving for 15 minute bursts at 12 Bursts per day before needing to take a long rest, is about 11k rungs straight up per day. 
At an average distance of 8 inches per rung, this is 134.4 million rungs. 
This would take Calvin 12000 days to complete or 33 years. 

In order to not starve, Calvin would have had to bringed canned foods and non perishable vitamins. 

At 1 vitamin pack a month and8 cans per day (that‚Äôs a lot of goddamn calories 11k steps) and 12 oz per can and 8oz per vitamin , he is carrying 1.2 Million oz or 76k pounds of canned food and vitamins on his first step, along with the neglibly weighted can openers. 98000 cans. 3000 bottles of vitamins. 


He can probably survive naked, but needs oxygen at higher levels. Say at 100 miles up, you‚Äôll need a tank a day. Ten pounds each. 
100 miles are traversed in Approx 72 days. So for about the whole
Time really, you need oxygen. 
12000 days times ten pounds equals 120k pounds of oxygen 
196k lbs total. 

Add a 20% contingency for other supplies when carrying a load that size and Calvin has carried 240,000 pounds off the ground before littering it all below. 

The oxygen is approx 100$ each.
$1.2M
3k vitamins*$70 is 
$200k
The food is about another $200k
Add another 20% contingency. 
The expedition is about 
$2M 
Years of his life wasted. 
Family fortune likely drained and house foreclosed. Where did a middle American family get that kind of  cash?

I hope his father drowns Calvin in the sewage he left strewn across the earth."

The word incantare means ""to sing"" 
Incantations exist today ""I'm about to start a fuckin riot"" for example. They're generally less powerful. 

I'll check out the stand still stuff. The poem recitation is really powerful.

I have this idea about what spells would be if they were cast with art. Like raindances, poems are really cool, scrolls are imbued better with penmanship, etc

I really like the poem idea. The longer the poem, the more powerful the cast. Would work well in an XR  game"

There‚Äôs an academic field of study in commercial music called ‚Äúlyric less story telling‚Äù 

Most consumers don‚Äôt really pay attention to the words. In fact, the more prominent the lyrics, the less prominent the general vibe of the music, which is why people by music. 

Music is easier to discern over long distances, bad speakers, and atmosphere interference. 

Most people only listen to the music because it‚Äôs physically easier

It‚Äôs the same reason why lyrics are repeated- generally they‚Äôre hard to understand so if you want ppl to connect- and they must connect to give you money- they need to remember some of the words. 

Interestingly, while ppl listen to lyrics last, the voice is the most listened to instrument, again due to a bio disposition to familiarize is the self to other ppl"

Also for the world to work, the environment must be protected. Not being educated means not understanding the science of climate change and voting in leaders who harm the environment more.
