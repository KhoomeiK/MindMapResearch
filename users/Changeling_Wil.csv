That's why you get paid via being employed to do a job.

Your arguement would only work if the state had hired you to dig the place up, then refused to pay you.

If you personally chose to dig a hole, you are not entitled to any compensation for that labour. You chose to do so. You are not being employed.

The second issue is that the item you happen to find while digging *does not belong to you*. 

The fact that you, while randomly deciding to dig, happened to find an item that does not belong to you, does not mean you are owed compensation.

To put it another way:

No they don't. They want people to use their gender once they correct them. It's not hard. If your name is William, but you ask to be called Bill, we call you Bill.

She posted transphobic comments. Nothing happened.

She posted more and started harrassing people. The charity decided that her mentality was not one they wanted to be associated with, so they did not renew her contract.

She then started bleating about how this is an evil trans conspiracy and how it's 1984.

Turns out that if you work for a charity that aims to fight inequality, you shouldn't go 'FUCK YOU, I'LL NEVER CALL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO BE CALLED' a lot on twitter."
