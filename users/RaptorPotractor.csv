CasualUK,ff4e0eu,t3_erb5eh,1579561372.0,"Ok, I am going to jump in here and with my plan. I decided in November last year that I really could do with losing some weight. I looked at a lot of diets etc and decided to try ""intermittent fasting"" as it looked a reasonable way of losing some weight. My starting weight was 102.4Kg (yep fat bastard), and I set my eating time as between 12noon and 6pm with only water or black coffee outside of that. I managed to get down to 98.2Kg just before Christmas and then I let myself go and am now trying to get back to my fasting proper.

Regarding exercise I generally walk 1-2 miles every other day and I am also a keen metal detectorist and beachcomber so I get a few miles in up hills and along the beach. My aim is to lose weight but not kill myself in the process. I am aiming for 80kg by the end of the year."
