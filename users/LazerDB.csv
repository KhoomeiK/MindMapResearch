teenagers,ff2afkp,t1_ff26l7k,1579498646.0,"You could start with being more confident and _thinking_ you have conversation skills until you actually do, so basically just talk (with confidence, even if it's fake) to people often and you'll naturally develop them. It's the same concept as exercising if you think about it, as in, humans will adapt to most things, whether it be developing muscle to be able to more easily lift, or developing conversational skills to be able to speak easier with other people.
What I did was just set a goal for myself to talk to one new person every day, at school, the supermarket, library, anywhere basically.
If you can't quite do that then you could start off by joining discord servers that are active and talk to people whilst making an attempt to have everyone you talk to stay in vc for more than a minute.

So basically just make an attempt and you'll gradually get better at talking"
