legaladvice,ff65fkq,t3_eri6dq,1579619571.0,"There is no fee to break a lease early in Chicago. Your option is to find someone to sublease the apartment or pay the last 3 months.

It’s not a guarantee; the only right the Chicago Residential Landlord & Tenant Ordinance grants you is the ability to sublease your apartment without paying any additional fees to do so.

The “landlord must make an effort to re-rent the apartment” can be satisfied with them throwing a for rent sign out front or an ad on Craigslist. Ultimately, it’s on you to find a new renter. Also, the new renter must be qualified (meet the same credit and income requirements you had to meet when applying); you can’t just bring them anyone and they are forced to accept them, so make sure you are also qualifying people’s income and credit to make sure they’ll get accepted."
