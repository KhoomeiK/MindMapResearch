SuicideWatch,fel43yv,t1_fekxcw1,1579213638.0,So yeah my grand plan aint working I cant get the cuts deep enough and I'm thinking of giving up but I already took 15 ibuprofen
SuicideWatch,fekvfj3,t1_fei90qb,1579208411.0,Hey thanks for giving me someone to talk to. It has been really stressful the past couple of days. Wish you the best of luck in life :)
SuicideWatch,fejhykw,t1_fej0bnn,1579175071.0,Bruh I feel this on a personal level right now
SuicideWatch,fei78vt,t1_fehthaz,1579131844.0,Ok but for real since I cant brag to anyone I know about how smart I am lemme tell you my plan. So what's the number one issue with suicide? 1 it hurts and 2 it doesnt always work. So i thought if I tried multiple suicides at the same time the chance for success goes up significantly. Using pain pills not only allows me to OD but will reduce the pain of cutting my wrists top that off with some alchohol( liquid courage ) and yes it will still hurt but a lot less. now chilling in the tub waiting to die is boring but thanks to drinking an entire bottle of cough syrup I will be hallucinating and having a crazy trip and if I lie face down in the tub when I lose consciousness I will then drown. Boom! Oh yeah and I got some Dramamine lying around so figute throw that in see what happens. Whatcha think?
SuicideWatch,fegd8ro,t1_fegd4hf,1579088523.0,Sorry if I seem upset just taking my anger out on everything and I don't need a helpline cuz I'm not depressed just feel horrible about what I've done but I appreciate the effort
SuicideWatch,fegd04a,t1_fegcm38,1579088231.0,"Yes, a simple apology why didnt I think of that?!? Hi yes I'm sorry I broke your trust but if you consider the benefits of trauma you now have it will totally even out with my simple words.
Words dont mean shit.
Honestly what girl in her right mind would accept a petty ass apology for that?!?
Also alcohol should never be an excuse. Dont care how drunk anyone gets they are still responsible for any actions they make.
Honestly I have just been living for shits and giggles but I refuse to be anything like my dad and im sorry to anyone who cares about me but I draw the line there"
SuicideWatch,fegchjs,t1_fegc9e5,1579087604.0,"I mean I would live to believe that if given time things could go back to normal but the way she looks at me makes my stomach sick with guilt. So what if I dont think I did it, she does. I have had a lot of female friends who have dealt with being taken advantage of and the guy just gets away with it and its unfair. They should fucking die for doing those things and I'm no exception. I'm not depressed I'm just straight up disgusted at myself."
