Moscow,fcvqmch,t1_fcvp5is,1578007892.0,"No I got placed in the orphanage when I was five because a neighbor called Russian social services (or some equivalent office) because I was being neglected. I gave some memories from the time but they are more like snapshots than full memories. From what I understand no one knows who my dad is but my ancestry shows West Asian and Balkan (although he could still be Russian, just not ethnic Slavic). My russian patronymic is apparently my grandpas name not my fathers. Oddly enough my first name is western and not at all Russian but maybe it’s connected to the Orthodox Church since it’s originally Greek/Latin.  My birth mom was an alcoholic (hence the neglect. I’m not sure if other relatives tried to get me because I know I had an aunt and cousin, but I was never visited by anyone from what I could remember. My parents almost couldn’t adopt me because my dad got a DUI around the time the adoption had to be finalized. One of the reasons I want to get my original records is to figure out the actual spelling of my Russian name so I can track down any relatives through my grandfathers name"
Moscow,fcvoqr9,t1_fcvo5ob,1578006694.0,Thank you. That actually makes a lot of sense now. That might also mean that I was born in the inner city

Moscow,fcvgv19,t1_fcmj2iy,1578001818.0,"I have to disagree. A lot of my friends consider themselves American and Indian or American and Belgium or American and Mexican or American and Japanese, so it’s not really unusual to have more than one cultural identity. Especially in my city which has a ton of immigrants"
Moscow,fcvgghr,t1_fctnonz,1578001578.0,"Thank you so much and please thank your colleague for me as well. I can’t believe too strangers across the world are taking the time to do this for me. It’s amazing and makes me feel a lot less lonely. 
I checked out the website and I’ll ask some people to help me translate when I go back to school. The Russian adoption system is so much different from the US, I can’t believe there are two different types of orphanages and orphanage zone. Do you know of the reason why? I’m not sure if I was lucky or not to be placed in the one I was in, considering how my parents turned out, but there are definitely a lot more benefits to having an American passport. Thank you so much, this has been such a great start to the year and really will give me a great start into my own research"
Moscow,fcqcv50,t1_fcqco74,1577883486.0,"Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

Moscow,fcq9m86,t1_fcq8sx9,1577881635.0,"Also for the summer/winter holiday break we would go to some camp with lots of buildings next to a lake. And in the winter when the lake froze we would cross it and sled on the mountain/hill on the other side of it. The cafeteria building had a huge mural on it of like random kids or something. I’m not sure how far outside of Moscow this place was though or why we went there.
Near the orphanage (or in Moscow) there was a little hill we would go play on during the winter that had a slide and steps dug into so that during the winter to you could slide on the iced over hill slide and then climb the steps. I miss the snow where I’m at"
Moscow,fcq967e,t1_fcq8sx9,1577881374.0,"No, I was very young. But I remember that it was large (large enough to contain grades 1-12) and that my grade slept on a separate floor or wing. It was also gated or something and had a lot of trees. It’s not very helpful but I’m probably gonna have to go to Moscow myself one day and check the different places out (and hope that it’s still there) 
Also the place had like a theater stage or auditorium, a dance room (we had a ballet or some type of dance teacher), and we had music class there. I had one teacher for all my main subjects (like in the US) and for some reason she always wore like a nurses coat on top of regular clothes"
Moscow,fcq6cle,t1_fcq5jpm,1577879708.0,"Not yet. I’ve called the consulate but they told me to email them first to inquire over my citizenship status. I haven’t made the fbi inquiry yet. I definitely need to put in more of an effort but that’s difficult to do because I’m in my junior year and busy with work, volunteering, and fellowships during any breaks I get.
