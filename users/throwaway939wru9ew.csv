HecklerKoch,feymks4,t3_eqwbxy,1579447620.0,"Edit to add at the beginning - If you don't already own a USC...and simply want a UMP...go buy a TommyBuilt UMP....or the omega one.  Save yourself all the work and hassle.  

There is a process for modifying the UMP lower to work on a original USC.  It is not a simple swap. 

The front hooks of the USC lower were made to be bigger than the UMP's lower.  So the hooks on the UMP need to be drilled/milled/whatever out to make them bigger. 

In addition to that, you swap out the original USC fire control system into the UMP lower.  There are internal safety's present on the USC that were not present in the UMP...well the Auto Sear took up those functions I guess.  

An optional but recommended step is to fill in the front pocket of the UMP lower (where some FA internals went) with JB weld.  This ensures a FA fire control group can't go back into the lower.  I did this on mine.

On the USC, you will need to mill out your magazine well to accept the wider UMP mags.  

Finally, you can either get a stock block adaptor to mate the USC upper, UMP lower, and UMP folding stock....or you can send it off to Tommy Bostic or maybe Ed at HDPS to do a full on plastic welding of a UMP rear end...  I just went with the stock block and I'm quite happy with it.  

Also - depending on what UMP lower you get, you might need to remark your safety lever, as the pictograms are in a different spot."
