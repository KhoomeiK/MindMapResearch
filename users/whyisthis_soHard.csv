About 80 percent of the population contracts HPV at some point in their life, and even though you came in contact with it, doesn’t mean you have acquired the virus. Also, somebody already addressed the way you’re addressing this problem, this isn’t the place for it. 

HPV is essentially as normal as the common cold. Also, most people’s bodies clear up over a few years. Therefore, just remain healthy and take care of yourself. It’s all good."

worldnews,feed29x,t1_fee94tx,1579031254.0,"Because it’s a vacuous stab at somebody’s intelligence rather than a direct statement about the subject. 

Think about if this was perhaps a discourse class, a meeting, or even maybe a discussion amongst friends, throwing in a comment about reading comprehension attacks a person by belittling versus sticking to the content. I would suspect that in face to face encounters you wouldn’t throw that at a stranger because in person, I hope people are better humans; that you are a better human. It is so easy to judge from afar and without compassion. 

Furthermore, a whole generation? What basis do you have to draw a conclusion like that from one human, to then project that onto an entire generation? And what generation? 

See how one comment that doesn’t fit the topic throws the whole focus off?"

2. When my best friend of 21 years wouldn’t let me take her kid for a slumber party with another kid friend (I  am the auntie taking the kids to the grands) because “I haven’t ever been away from her”. I’m over her anxiety and unrealistic control over her children and fear mindset, helicopter parenting, and abusive baby dad, I can’t support her anymore. I just instantly became exhausted with her. For context, I don’t live in the country with her anymore, I was home for the holidays, she doesn’t have any other friends, her children are willed to me in the event of death. I have legit talked to them every day until that day. 

3. When my grandfather started yelling at me for eating food, calling me dumb for being so educated, and telling me I’m too skinny when I’ve been the same size for 14 years. I packed my stuff and left immediately."
