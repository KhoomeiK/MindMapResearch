Probably start crying at the fact that the girl of his dreams and best friend is getting married in a year.

I'm constantly shifting how to see the world and my take on the origins of my faith based on new information that comes out. I hear of something new, I make a new hypothesis.  I have no way of testing these ideas it so its all just a guess or a mental exercise to play with.

> Now it's half-baked, fuck-it-I-have-a-degree, pseudoscience-theory time!

>  I'm putting my money...

I used those words for a reason. It's just a guess at a possible explanation that I might be proven wrong with. Either way, its not too much of a big deal because this isn't at the core of my faith.

>""Sin"" itself is a silly concept.

Sure, in the abstract. I'll give you that. But, to a Christian, it's a pretty solidified concept. Sin is basically any behavior that is in direct violation of the old covenant known as Jewish law. You break that law, you sin. The thing that Christians believe is that basically Jesus came to be the fulfillment of the law and gave us a new command to abide by ""love one another as I have loved you"" (John 13:34). That's the part that truly matters to me.

It's this concept that allows me to fly by the seat of my pants when it comes to God's possible imprints on the origins of this universe. Genesis doesn't affect my work or my beliefs because it ain't at the core of my faith. It's just some spiritual context."

unpopularopinion,fe0hdem,t1_fdzcbei,1578813460.0,"Christian Biochemist/Chemist here. Definitely not a creationist or young earther or something crazy.

In Ephesians, Paul considers the devil to essentially be the ruler of this world by referring to him as ""prince of the air"". The main idea is that there is only one place where bad things don't happen, heaven. 

When sin entered the world (the whole Adam, Eve, apple, snake thing), that opened the world up to every possible bad thing being able to happen because now the world is now cut off from the one true source of good.

Why is an all-powerful God cut off from the world? John 1:1 explains that God is actually a manifestation of what He  Himself says. (Yep, you read that right.) 

An example of this is Jesus. God **said** he'd send a savior. So he sent **Himself**. This is why Jesus is referred to as the ""word of god"". 

This is important because God also speaks his creation into existence (see the 1st chapter of genesis). So if God speaks life into the word, that means that he is life in and of itself. Well, there is no hybrid between life and death so when sin entered the world that brought the opposite of life with it, death. So this is the cutoff where disease and all other bad things come from. God gave the world free will and the world chose to cut itself off from life. Since life and death cannot occur simultaneously, the world has a put up a barrier between itself and God.

(Sidenote: this is why that whole John 3:16 thing is important, its God's workaround)

Now it's half-baked, fuck-it-I-have-a-degree, pseudoscience-theory time!

If I am to believe that most of the old testament is mostly metaphors, then when does sin enter the world? I'm putting my money on the theorized period being when procaryotic cells were developed. Biting into a fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil sounds a lot like a Bacterium using endosymbiosis to pick up all kinds of knowledge via extra bits now added to the genome. (yeah...I completely pulled that out of my ass).

Hope that helps."

b) none of those wars were in a ""vacuum"" (basically, not one 1v1)

Chemistry is hard enough. Why complicate it more with hard names? Just call it like you see it. Take the IUPAC system for example. Its a way of naming chemicals so that way you can break the name down by parts and know the exact structure.

Here's an oversimplified example:

Meth= 1 carbon

Eth= 2 carbons

Prop= 3 carbons

Iso= middle

-ol = alcohol (that means there is an oxygen and a hydrogen attached to a carbon)

Methyl alcohol or Methanol = 1 carbon alcohol

Ethyl alcohol or Ethanol = 2 carbon alcohol

Isopropyl alcohol or Isopropanol = 3 carbon alcohol but the oxygen is attached to the middle carbon.

The respective common names for these chemicals are wood alcohol, alcohol (...like for drinking), and rubbing alcohol.

Now if there were only 3 alcohols in the world, then common names would be easier. But there are WAY more than that so its better to keep it simple."
