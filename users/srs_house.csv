But there are also higher barriers to ownership in general - such as being able to afford a gun. Take machine guns - they run upwards of $5,000 for a legal one, plus a full federal background check and local law enforcement signoff. Afaik, there have been no legally owned machine guns used to commit a violent crime since at least 1986 when the most recent limitation went into effect.

Plus he either can't or isn't willing to force Harden to rest, and when he rests Westbrook there's no one else who can consistently help carry the team, so Harden winds up playing 35 to 40 minutes almost every game.
