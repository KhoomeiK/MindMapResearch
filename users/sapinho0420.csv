steroidsxx,ff3xc7n,t1_ff3v7od,1579550903.0,Are you microdosing? Can you tell me how much youâ€™re taking? What about side effects so far?

Trying to weigh in pros and cons of Anavar and Test Prop for body recomposition (granted all variables are in check: diet, sleep, etc...)

So far my conclusions were:

Pros
- test prop doesnâ€™t affect your liver
- helps with overall mood, sexual drive, etc
- cruising on low dose could keep mood benefits, etc.

Cons:
- it has to be injected (itâ€™s a con for me!)
- greater risk of side effects (virilization)
- needs a PCT

TIA for your help!"

Iâ€™ll look into test."

steroidsxx,fdhir2d,t3_elepnj,1578423509.0,Iâ€™d love to do a cycle. Recently moved to a new state/city so I donâ€™t know anyone around from whom I could get some ðŸ˜©
steroidsxx,fdhi1zv,t3_elfgky,1578423087.0,"Im currently on my first Clen cycle too but Iâ€™m doing it a bit differently.

Week 1-3: 20mcg
Week 4-6: 30mcg
Week 7-8: 40mcg
Week 9-10: 50mcg
Week 11-12: 60mcg

When I was doing 6 meals a day my hunger was almost unbearable what made me turn to what was the best option FOR ME: 18:6 IF with only 2 meals a day.

I did ECA stack for a couple of months and didnâ€™t notice any changes on hunger (I was doing 6 meals a day, so constantly hungry!)

Hope this helps."
intermittentfasting,fd6bjmb,t3_ejwr0w,1578188458.0,Make sure you drink a lot of water. Not only helps with shifting your mind off of food but also helps your body get rid of excess water/toxins.
intermittentfasting,fd64f3u,t1_fd5c9dg,1578185383.0,Drinking more water helps!
steroids,fc3by72,t3_efv5wh,1577386414.0,"Going to start a Clen 2 weeks on / 2 weeks off cycle starting at 20mcg and doing pyramid (no more than 120mcg then down to 20 mcg)

Is there a limit on how many cycles I can do? (Considering Iâ€™m doing the 2 weeks off every time)"
steroids,fbxmxb5,t3_ef125d,1577194361.0,"I feel so much better doing IF with two meals a day but stopped when a trainer told me it was bad. Isnâ€™t the main objective to hit your cals for the day instead of timing? 

So much info out there nowadays we get confused! TIA"
