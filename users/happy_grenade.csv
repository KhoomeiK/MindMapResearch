It‚Äôs enough to bother the person behind you,  but not enough to make any noticeable difference in your own comfort, so why do it? Or is it that other people actually are more comfortable reclined and I‚Äôm just weird?"

fatlogic,fea3nmi,t1_fe6ni0l,1578944020.0,"Same. And the funny thing is, I started doing so because I was working on, of all things, trying to be more body positive. I remember hearing, ‚Äúfocus less on how your body looks and more on what it can do,‚Äù and I realized that my fat ass couldn‚Äôt do a lot of the things I used to, and I‚Äôd be a lot happier with my body if I fixed that."

exchristian,fe48wzx,t3_enromh,1578856909.0,"I realize this isn‚Äôt the point, but their idea of ‚Äúproof‚Äù made me laugh so hard. I can‚Äôt think of any form of ID that lists your marital status, and plenty of married couples don‚Äôt have the same last name. Rings don‚Äôt prove anything either, especially since two people having an affair could certainly have wedding rings despite not being married to each other.

If they really wanted to be sure, they‚Äôd require you to show your marriage license at the front desk. Which they won‚Äôt, because people generally don‚Äôt carry that with them and would probably just go somewhere less inconvenient even if they were good married Christians. So you know, the owners are committed to their Christian values, so long as that commitment isn‚Äôt too inconvenient or anything."
exchristian,fe3hj94,t3_enpsv5,1578849332.0,"I went through something very similar when I left Christianity - the fear of hell can be really strong. One thing that helped me was learning about other religions and their versions of hell/punishment, because I realized I wasn‚Äôt afraid of any of those. I didn‚Äôt think they were real, so I had no reason to be afraid. Seeing the Christian version as just one of many fictional punishments helped me to stop worrying about it anymore.

Time also helps, though. That may not be comforting now, but I think a lot less about things than I did about 10 years ago when I first stopped believing in Christianity. The anxiousness about hell didn‚Äôt go away overnight, but now I can‚Äôt remember the last time I worried about it. Hang in there."

fatlogic,fdn8o22,t3_em9saj,1578580242.0,"For all this talk about ‚Äúthin privilege‚Äù, it seems to me you have to be fairly privileged to think ‚ÄúNo worries if none of my clothes fit - I‚Äôll just buy more!‚Äù

As a matter of fact, part of the reason I finally got serious about losing weight was that I was starting to outgrow my professional wardrobe, and that shit‚Äôs expensive. Eating less was much easier to afford than a shopping spree. It wasn‚Äôt the sole reason, or even the primary reason, but still.

Of course, now I need smaller clothes, but at least I can use some of the money I‚Äôm saving on food for those. Plus, it‚Äôs a lot easier to get some of my larger clothes tailored to fit than to try and let out things that are too small."
