DestinyLore,fctyqdj,t1_fcp4pc5,1577966147.0,"Isnt the whole point of reckoning for the nine to test us? They want to be independant from us as currently, their own existence and sentience is tied to our own. The light may be able to do that for them. Its makes sense that thats why they gave the drifter the hall. To study guardians and light so as to become seperate from it?"

DestinyLore,fchhko2,t3_eh6zs2,1577650552.0,"A throne world is a pocket of the ascendant plane. The hive mainly posses them although in the forsaken campaign a hive obsessed baron named the Mindbender has his own throne world. When we fight him it is explained that killing powerful beings increases the size of your throne world and that his was so large because of his involvement in the death of Cayde-6. Other notable enemies that had throne worlds are crota and oryx. 

Basically a throne world is a pocket dimension, but only a pocket of a larger dimension if that makes sense. I might be wrong so dont treat this as solid fact."

destiny2,fbw8i8t,t3_ees78t,1577143367.0,"A bow does around the same damage as a hand cannon. You do lose out on rpm using a bow evevn if you have a bunch of draw time perks like archers tempo and bow loader. Honestly in pve i dont matter too much until you get to higher level activities where you need the extra dps. 

In my opinion you should just use whatever you want. But if you attempt to complete higher level activities like 920+ nighfalls or exotic quest strikes i would seriously recommend a hand cannon. You would need the extra dps as the enemies are much tougher and might be able to withstand a fully charged precision shot from a bow."

""NO"" Replied shaggy as he furiously beat his meat over freds dead body.
""But i thought you had to wait till night for the monsters to come out!"" Squealed scoob as shaggy grabbed him with his veiny arm.
""I'm not a monster"" said Shaggy as he munched on scoob. ""I'm shaggy""
