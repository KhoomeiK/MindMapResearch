""In 1930, when Pavlova was 50 years old, her 30-year dance career had come to physically wear on her. She decided to take a Christmas vacation after wrapping up a particularly arduous tour in England. At the end of her vacation, she boarded a train back to The Hague, where she planned to resume dancing. On its way from Cannes to Paris, the train was in an accident. Although Pavlova was unharmed in the accident, she was forced to wait out the delay outside on the train platform for 12 hours.

It was a snowy evening, and Pavlova was only wearing only a thin jacket and flimsy silk pajamas. Once in Holland, within days of the accident, she developed double pneumonia and her illness quickly worsened. On her deathbed, Pavlova, passionate about dance until her final breath, asked to see her swan costume one last time. She died in The Hague, Netherlands, in the wee hours of the morning, on January 23, 1931."""

The management company monthly fees take care of every day maintenance and they are suppose to save a % of the money for the bigger renovations, like the roof, and plan them so the building stays in good shape.   If they are not enough money in the building fund they will ask for more money from each owner or raise the monthly fees for a couple of years.     

BTW a lot of newer building have really low monthly fees to attract buyers.   Put some money aside for future issues because they won't have enough if something big breaks.  Also ask if they are pending lawsuits.   It cost 80K in lawyers fees to a building in my town just to solve drainage issues.   

The 20K was for the reparation of the concrete outside walls and indoor pool that hasn't been planned.   (An expensive mistake)  They still had to do the roof and all the windows with zero money left in their bank account :(

I was once interested in a condo because of a low price only to find out they had a special fee of 20K that had to be pay that year.   (And more $ years to come)

You need to know how much money is in the building fund, how much are the renovations and when they are planning them.
