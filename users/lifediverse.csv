Eyebleach,ff9kxoe,t3_esb1er,1579715179.0,Thiss title made me realize I’m way more corrupted by the political climate than I thought.
gaming,ff9ks8g,t3_esb5p2,1579715090.0,Never going to happen. It’s just too lucrative to give up — greed can be dangerous that way.
gadgets,fegx285,t3_eoz18d,1579104453.0,That’s so awesome

aww,fed31ud,t1_fecpnx7,1578996295.0,"You’re anthropomorphizing. A dog doesn’t wait at home wishing it could do all the things we do. A dog does not think like an adult human. They’re doing exactly what a dog does, because that is all they can do.

If they were capable of understanding and could benefit from the things a human does and we deprived them of that, by say, forcing them to stay at home just waiting around for us to come back, then you could argue that we don’t deserve it. 

I get your point, but you’re fabricating a moral illusion and I don’t appreciate that."

worldnews,fd922r5,t1_fd8z7cc,1578227154.0,"Nice, I'm glad you calmed down. However, we still disagree. I'm not so sure it would've worked out differently in the end. But that's okay - we don't have to agree on everything.

worldnews,fd7wd7i,t1_fd6grdv,1578211147.0,I don’t think Iran would’ve held up their end of that deal anyway. The amount of pages matters not.
quityourbullshit,fcxke5s,t3_eja9jb,1578065076.0,I don’t understand what you get out of doing things like this. I mean you are fully aware that you’re deceiving others. I don’t get it...
UpliftingNews,fcvljnj,t1_fcugogc,1578004691.0,Whenever I hear ”driving defensively” I picture someone not letting other cars pass and/or denying merging.
mildlyinfuriating,fcu2jxz,t3_eivat6,1577970533.0,Why would you ever want let people in public know what type of music you listen to?
AskReddit,fcjnv0j,t1_fcjicox,1577695757.0,"Honestly, you were just a kid with a gut feeling. I get that in retrospect there’s guilt associated with your decision to not stay over, but you should go easy on yourself. Looking back it might seem as if you could’ve done otherwise but that’s a mirage that can end up causing you unecessary suffering. Take care of yourself!"
