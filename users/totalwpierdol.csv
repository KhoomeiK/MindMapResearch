Intelligentcels,ffbt0cu,t3_eskb5u,1579781652.0,"The last sentence is just a subjective opinion, not a matter of it being true or not.  

Incels are passive aggressive. They don't commit violence, because they are usually physically and/or mentally weak and are afraid of society. Meanwhile they sit at home, hating the world and think passionately about violence a lot. 

But it's true, they don't really *act* violent. It's been also statistically proven that sex havers are the main perpetrators of rape and violence. We have to admit it. We can't call incels ""peaceful"" though."
