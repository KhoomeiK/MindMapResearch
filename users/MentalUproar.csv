NewsOfTheStupid,fecw94c,t1_fe9jzd9,1578987117.0,"You think too highly of the American people.  We are capable of occasionally doing the right thing, but in large groups, we are fucking morons.  Do I think my vote counts? No.  That being said, I'm not going to make it that much easier for assholes to drive us into the ground by not showing up.

Politics in the US (and I suspect elsewhere) swings back and forth like a pendulum. It swings just a little less extreme each time, except for this last cycle.  That one changed a hell of a lot.  Everything went further into the extremes.  Behaving as an adult became taboo.  The Democrats learned nothing and are going to push Biden on the American people, who will say fuck it and not show up.  The republicans are delusional, thinking their party still exists, completely ignoring the radicalization their dumb-down and short term hackery got them. Since the dominant political discussion is governed by red vs blue voting, voting how their parents voted, and people are too dumb and overworked to improve themselves, it will never change.

America the idea is incredible.  America the reality is a disappointment.
