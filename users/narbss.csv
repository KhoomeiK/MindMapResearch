HomeNetworking,fecbie3,t3_eoeyee,1578970166.0,The signal from your primary router/AP will be exactly the same with another AP involved. You seem to be having wireless device roaming issues where your devices are taking a long time to connect to the stronger signal. To remedy this you’ll have to change the broadcast power of your primary AP and lower it accordingly in order to get better roaming. It’s a bit of trial and error but will give you a much better WiFi experience.
