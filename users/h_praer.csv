college,fcycfwd,t1_fcx861q,1578078003.0,"Right, if anything, the dining services should aid students in education rather than profiting from it."
college,fcwqpms,t1_fcw9cc8,1578033876.0,Yup I think the first step would be to spread awareness. Thank you for your advice
college,fcwqntv,t1_fcwgh9y,1578033821.0,Yeah honestly even just living in apartment especially in the midwest saves you thousands
college,fcwqjk4,t1_fcwjvf5,1578033701.0,Did the value change depending on which meal plan you got? Thanks!
college,fcwqc3z,t1_fcwk4o3,1578033489.0,Oh that's the first time I heard or this! Interesting
college,fcwqa9a,t1_fcwmnyj,1578033436.0,Haha yup wassup
college,fcw09lr,t1_fcw02qb,1578014163.0,Is that the same for housing? I know friends who get cash to pay for off campus and can save a lot that way
college,fcw03ri,t1_fcvy11k,1578014054.0,"Yeah I tried to write a paper about it but didnt have good arguments because in the end, these are private companies with little transparency."
college,fcw00rf,t1_fcvy022,1578013999.0,Interesting that commuters were required only their first 2 years. Probably to encourage campus life?
college,fcvxwjs,t1_fcvxlo9,1578012606.0,"Ah there's no exemption from the meal plan regardless of whether you live on campus or not. If you live off-campus, you have access to ""cheaper"" meal plans"
college,fcvxr44,t1_fcvv0o2,1578012505.0,"Yup, given my exchange rate for meal points, I'm paying $10+ for just the entree with no drinks or sides."
college,fcvxot8,t1_fcvt2jy,1578012462.0,Oh wow you've done your research. Would you think that these third-party companies are mostly responsible (or have the power) for these decisions?
college,fcvxj8y,t1_fcvrtr9,1578012361.0,Wow you got it rougher than I do. Must be a pretty small school
college,fcvuld2,t1_fcvtw0w,1578010451.0,"Checked the website and don't think there's any mention of a waiver. When starting the new semester, our school portal will prompt what our address is, and then ask which meal plan we would like to sign up for. There was no option to opt out from what I remember!"
college,fcvpayh,t1_fcvp1a2,1578007048.0,haha I think we do...
college,fcvotpr,t1_fcvo8vv,1578006744.0,Oh so even freshmen were allowed to opt out depending on their dorm situation?
college,fcvoqg7,t1_fcvoadt,1578006688.0,An $80 meal plans really cheap. Does it translate to $80 in points?
college,fcvon74,t1_fcvl70v,1578006631.0,Pretty unjust to up-charge students
college,fcvoiip,t1_fcvlt46,1578006552.0,Makes sense :)
college,fcvohjb,t1_fcvm1ju,1578006535.0,Yeah i'm surprised you had to pay more than i did
college,fcvny79,t1_fcvmgze,1578006194.0,awesome! thanks for the information :)
college,fcvnxbi,t1_fcvm89w,1578006178.0,Got out one semester early :/
college,fcvlauk,t1_fcvkp78,1578004539.0,Your input is valuable! I would say it's definitely manipulative. Thank you!
college,fcvl653,t1_fcvjzc1,1578004456.0,"Yeah,  I would definitely go through $350 too given we have a Subway and I get coffee time to time on campus. It's a lot less than the $1200 we pay for deflated meal points."
college,fcvkrhn,t1_fcvjzra,1578004202.0,Oh I see. So you were required to buy one if you lived in a dorm.
college,fcvkpc1,t1_fcvkbid,1578004166.0,"Yeah, a reality you realize after your first years at college"
college,fcvk0kd,t1_fcvjurh,1578003738.0,Thanks for your input! I ask whether it's a state university because I  attend a private school and I'm trying to see how that affects the schools decision.
college,fcvjxdl,t1_fcvjehs,1578003682.0,Seems like that's most common. Thanks for your input
college,fcvjwma,t1_fcvj3qh,1578003668.0,Dang... at least it's not the $1200 my school requires....
college,fcvjvcw,t1_fcvj144,1578003646.0,Really appreciate another viewpoint! Yeah I think this is something I want to address and spread awareness! Again thanks for your input.
college,fcvjto5,t1_fcvi6k0,1578003618.0,"Yeah, our school doesn't even have all that many options to require it"
college,fcvjr2h,t1_fcvhy1w,1578003573.0,Interesting. I would have thought that they would require out of state students to buy a plan
college,fcvjou0,t1_fcvh8ir,1578003535.0,"Yeah, I have no idea about the financial aspect of running such an institution but this method of profit seems wrong."
college,fcvh2jd,t1_fcve4pi,1578001941.0,"Yeah for sure. Even with the need for the meal plan, I'm not quite sure why it would have to be a requirement though."
college,fcvdh0o,t1_fcv99rn,1577999805.0,Thanks for your input :) appreciate it!
college,fcvdgb7,t1_fcvcqwa,1577999793.0,Thanks a bunch for your input. Starting to seem as if the requirement is pretty uncommon.
college,fcvddu3,t1_fcvd3mh,1577999751.0,"Thanks! If you don't mind me asking, is it a public or private university?"
college,fcv8ty6,t1_fcv8f80,1577997044.0,Thanks for your response! Love Brockhampton
college,fcv8g4h,t1_fcv898d,1577996815.0,Right? Thanks for your response!
college,fcv8dtn,t1_fcv7sm3,1577996777.0,"Yeah, advising is no problem at all. Just enforcing it with a higher rate is odd."
college,fcv8b0r,t1_fcv7nn7,1577996731.0,Do you still have the ability to pay with card or cash?
college,fcv86yv,t1_fcv7nki,1577996664.0,"Right, I haven't looked into appealing. I actually graduated this winter and was just reflecting on what I thought was unfair about my school. It's something I want to bring up because most people seem to be unaware that we're being ripped off on something like food..."
college,fcv7rp0,t1_fcv76xs,1577996411.0,That's really good on the school. It wasn't ideal for me given all my classes were between lunch and dinner so that I could eat at home. Thanks for your response!
college,fcv6ufl,t1_fcv6dvv,1577995858.0,"The website states that the Off-campus plan (the cheapest plan) ""is the minimum required for those students residing off-campus.""  It's also $1200...."
vinyl,fbwax4t,t3_eerm61,1577145143.0,"Hello everyone. I just bought my first turntable (Denon 300f) and been trying to set it up. It comes with a builtin preamp which I made sure to turn on. I connected it to an active speaker I had lying around and the music that is outputted is really bassy with no highs. After the song is done, the speaker makes heartbeat noises. Any idea what I'm missing?"
