Psychosis,ff56bju,t1_ff4wqeh,1579581470.0,"My dad wouldn't know how to help. I still haven't even come out to him as bi.

My mom will probably be the one to read news articles about recovery going wrong (but also of it going right) because she'll most likely be doing research on the medicines they give and see what's in them, what do they do, what are the side effects, etc. This is what she did with vaccines, and when she saw all the terrible side effects and the fact that there are aborted fetal cells, she became anti-vax.

I accepted my bisexuality pretty quickly actually. I had already been an ally for about a year or two before realizing I was more than an ally, so I didn't feel shame or disgust of myself. I felt pride and acceptance of myself. But that's just my personality, I guess.

Thanks, and goodnight to you too."

Psychosis,ff4veit,t1_ff4u19y,1579573364.0,"She said she always knew I wasn't straight. She's kinda half pro-LGBT, and half against it for religious reasons. Like, she believes gay marriage being legal is great because she doesn't believe the government should have a say in marriage, however, she believes men shouldn't be interested in each other romantically or sexually because ""god has his reasons for homosexuality being wrong that are beyond our understanding"". We haven't discussed it since I came out, and she hasn't treated me any differently or viewed me differently. I'd say it went pretty well. However, I'm not sure what she'll do the day I bring home a boyfriend."

Psychosis,ff4sea6,t1_ff4rb0q,1579571307.0,"What you said about Batman reminded me of a possible third episode I had last year. I don't remember how it started, but I remember watching this video on YouTube on how Spiderman most likely made his suit, and for some reason I thought the video was from the future, the guy who made is me in the future, and that me in the future put this video in the past for me to see, make a Spiderman suit, and go out and stop criminals and that essentially all the Spiderman stories are based off real Spiderman, me, based loosely from what actually happens in the future. I remember laughing at the comments discussing how did Spiderman make his suit, because I believed they just saw the real Spiderman, me in the future, making the actual Spiderman suit. **Fortunately** that ended before I actually made a Spiderman suit and went out to ""stop criminals"", but had it worsened, I totally would have done that.

I guess I really do need help."
Psychosis,ff4qch1,t1_ff4pce9,1579569900.0,"That's a good idea, but the problem is she won't believe it. I have never had anxiety, in fact I have the exact opposite of anxiety. And she definitely won't believe I have depression. Also, my sister has severe anxiety, but my mom never set an appointment for a psychiatrist, and my sister has never asked for one, that I know of. And I believe she has depression, but my mom doesn't believe so, despite the fact that she's literally said she wants to die."
Psychosis,ff4pxhl,t1_ff4p8oc,1579569611.0,"I've had two episodes so far, but neither of them harmed myself or others. The first was when I was 12 or 13 and I had a paranoid delusional episode where I was having these nightmares of being stalked and then murdered, so I believed it was going to happen in real life. I lived in terror for months during that episode. The second episode was a manic delusional episode where I believed I was Oz from Oz the Great and Powerful & The Wizard of Oz. I had so much energy, I was so productive, and I was super happy. But nothing really felt real. It all felt like I was in a dream kinda. That episode lasted for about a month or two I think.

I'm not sure how to tell my mom I'm _psychotic_ tho. I don't want to tell her irl, I was thinkin maybe with a meme or sending her a YT video."
