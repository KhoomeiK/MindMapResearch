Being 20 and never having kissed someone is normal. Don’t call yourself creepy. Or if you are, stop doing that! Try meeting people in new ways. 

We are all jealous of our friends. Hell, I sure am. On paper I look great! I’m 23 and I have a house and a full time job but I am so jealous of so many people I know... but I blame social media for making me unappreciative of the good parts of my life. I have to constantly remind myself that I do have accomplishments even though I often talk down on myself. Reflect on that for a moment. 

I never knew how to cook anything until I got a meal delivery service. I still barely know how to cook but I am happy to say I’m learning. 

I also feel lazy 99% of the time. When people ask me what my hobbies are, I can’t come up with anything. Literally. I’m too lazy to even watch videos or play any sort of game lol. 

You are worth it. If you are realizing all of these things, take the time to work on them. Pick a recipe and try it. Pick a topic and learn something about it. Watch a video! You don’t even have to read. Sooner or later you’ll realize that all these people who talk like they know something are just talking out of their asses lmao. I used to feel so intimidated by other people’s knowledge when I realized its confidence over actual intelligence. People who talk and fill air confidently really do come across as knowing more. 

Don’t ever doubt your self worth because of your relationship history. Never seek out another human being to feel while. You need to find that in yourself first. 

Much love."
RATS,fe6m8bm,t1_fe63yf4,1578895677.0,Bless. This is the most direct answer I’ve gotten. Even going to the vet. Thank you lol
RATS,fe47ziw,t1_fe47qzo,1578856613.0,"Yes, just not sure why there’s a squishy lump of blood where the mass used to be :/ it’s the second time she’s gotten one removed from that area but last time recovery was super quick. It was also a lot smaller before"
RATS,fe477jc,t3_enrspy,1578856433.0,"Vet thought maybe an abscess, drained it and only found pooled blood. Drained what he could. Hematoma? He put her in a compression vest and said to ice but it’s back to how it was. Said to take her back in if it gets bigger but wouldn’t the body reabsorb it eventually (hopefully)? Should I be bringing her in again? 

Leave for a work trip tomorrow. Boyfriend is watching her. I just don’t want blood to get in places it’s not supposed to! Not sure if anyone else has seen bruising/pooled blood after rat mammary mass removal."
aww,fe0xs99,t3_enlchl,1578819998.0,Story: she had a mammary tumor removed and would not stop scratching at the incision. She was very unhappy... but it’s ok. She’s known for being a bit of a drama queen. Rats get too much negative press ❤️
