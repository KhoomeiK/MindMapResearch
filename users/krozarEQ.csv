The Right runs a cult and it's huge. They've been indoctrinating people for years and playing on their fears on a daily basis.

It's critical for their social circles. 

On the left, we have to be moderate. The elected officials in the most right-leaning districts will have to be protected in order to have any shot at a majority.

linuxmasterrace,ffbb9sq,t1_ff9z4rj,1579758309.0,"I've never needed to ask questions on the Arch forums. There's plenty of documentation.

Most answers can be found there. Many can also be found on stack exchange. 

A keystone of the Arch design philosophy is direct control. There's very few distro-specific tools to learn and the locations of files tend to follow closely with FHS 2.3.

It's not like an OTR driver just goes home for the night to see the family. It's made it take longer to be able to financially take home time. A lot of big carriers out there not paying jack shit. Plus they're pushing drivers into shit lease contracts. A few days without income can default a lease. It's just a way for mega carriers to put all the costs on the driver and still drive a damn company truck (can't take it to another carrier? YOU'RE NOT AN OWNER-OPERATOR). At the end of the 4-year lease, end up with a huge balloon or lease another truck. Some of those guys couldn't even go eat something good. I had to pay for their meals to have someone to grab a bit to eat with. To make it work, they have to team or... TRAIN for the company. 

For many in the industry, pay hasn't risen much in 20 years. 

Some find a niche, especially with a smaller company and do alright. But a driver will likely have to do 3 years free and clear with a large carrier before that happens. 

Just isn't the same either. Drivers in a fucking hurry because of e-logging and rules that can't bend at all that one worried about getting run over at the truck stop. Can't pull over a bit if weather is bad or you're sick. It's down to the wire these days. Broke states and town see your truck with dollar signs in their eyes. Fucking chicken coops too.

To get it out of the way, the best quality is to save back money during good months. It's feast or famine and there will be a lot of really bad months where it would've been better working the grill at McDonalds. 

Excluding being able to stave off financial ruin and boredom that the job often entails (and being in a building with a bunch of bored co-workers is drama city), the best method of selling is not even trying to sell. If the customer is on your lot it's because they like what they see. There's nothing to sell. In the majority of cases the financials work out or they don't. Build a rapport. Talk about family and other things you have in common. That goes much farther than than the stereotypical 80s used car salesman stereotype that most buyers are going to see right through."
PoliticalHumor,fepu1ta,t1_fep470z,1579331286.0,"This is true. Very little headroom in new car sales. Where the big money is at is in the trade-ins that new car dealerships bring in. Many new car dealerships support 2 used car dealerships plus they do a lot of wholesale business too. Auction cars are mostly junk. So if the tote-the-note lots want a few decent gems in their inventory they get them from wholesalers connected to the larger dealerships. Some cars more valuable in other markets and moving those wholesale cars around is big business. There's many small lots in your city that primarily only exist to maintain a dealer's license so they can move wholesale vehicles around. 

There's some money in that business but very little is from new car markup. Extended warranties and shop warranty work is far bigger for a new car lot. But *yeah, trade-ins are king.

You can `readlink -f /sys/class/drm/card0/device` for the true directory because udev could change it. From root: `echo ""high"" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_dpm_force_performance_level` to change the dynamic power management state.

I'm not aware of a separate package. The AUR `linux-amd-git` package will install those. Boot into that kernel, run pacman -Syu, and then you can uninstall that kernel if you want. The firmware will remain. [Here's the kernel compilation options they used for 5.4.0 rc4](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/config?h=linux-amd-git) Otherwise you'll need to patch directly from the `git://people.freedesktop.org/~agd5f/linux#branch=drm-next-5.6` branch. But I wanted to try that build.

DRI 3 is set in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-amdgpu.conf but still only using 2 for some reason and I haven't spent any time with that yet. 

For Lutris, I have been using the 5.0rc3 x86 wine runner for non-proton games. Esync off. DXVK on. The Witcher 3 was my main test game during all of this,. I've been working on it off and on since Dec 23rd when I got the 5700 XT. 

I currently have freesync off. I had flicker issues with it on Linux and Win10 19.12.1 and 19.12.3 drivers (x.x.3 is useless) 

But I will be doing some tests soon with it re-enabled. I'm also going to try the linux-ck (MuQSS process scheduler) soon to see how it's running. But with Witcher 3, Subnautica, and Kerbal Space Program, everything is running beautifully. Before I had stability issues with intermittent crashes. 

No stuttering at all in all the games I've tried and no crashes. 

I hope that's useful for anyone else with a Navi on Linux"

Although rarely using Windows anymore anyways. Vulkan /w DXVK and a stable ACO shader compiler on the horizon (which has been amazing in anything I ran it in) and Valve's fsync kernel patches with a choice of CPU schedulers... windows gaming isn't the only game in town anymore."

linuxmasterrace,fdcjra7,t1_fdcapbf,1578276628.0,"A single `&` ampersand is to run a command asynchronously (in the background). The `&&` Bash control operator is a shorthand conditional that runs the subsequent command when the prior command finished with a 0 exit code (success). 

For example, `sl && ls` is the same as:

    sl
    if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
        ls
    else
        return
    fi

The `;` control operator will run a subsequent command regardless of the exit code of the prior command. *You can also demonstrate `sl && ls` with a `;` operator: `sl; [[ $? -eq 0 ]] && ls` Everything inside the `[[` `]]` brackets is an expression for the bash `test` command. When `test` exits with code 0 (success), it then runs `ls`. `&&` does this but in a more condensed and convenient form. 

`||` is the inverse of `&&` and will run a following command when the previous command exited with an error (exit code 1 - 255). This is useful for creating compact conditionals.

Example:

`systemctl --version &> /dev/null && echo ""Your distribution uses systemd"" || echo ""Your distribution does not use systemd.""`

""3.2 Shell Commands"" is a great read for using the CLI or doing scripting whenever you have some time. https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Commands"
