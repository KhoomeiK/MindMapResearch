So instead I would play sports video games, which you could do at any time and didn't need other people to play.

I guess my point is that I only watched sports instead of playing because I can't always play. With video games, I can play whenever I want, so why watch instead of playing?"

He seems really angry that his neighbors didn't have to pay as much for their house as him... how is that their fault? They just bought a house at the price that they were selling for, and want to live in the house they bought... isn't that what OP wants to do? Will OP volunteer to move out if housing prices keep going up and he is the one who paid way less for his house than his neighbors?

I am literally in the exact same situation as OP... live in LA, in a ridiculously expensive house we bought a couple of years ago, neighbors have all been here forever and paid way less money, we have young kids, neighbors all have grown children... but I don't begrudge that my neighbors and I are at different stages of our lives.

I do my best to accommodate them, and hope they do the same for me... and hope to repeat that process with new neighbors when I am in their spot 30 years from now."

So, for example, they might have data that says ""down 24 in the first quarter, the trailing team scores an average of 14.7 more points with a std deviation of 5 points, and the leading team scores 20 more points with a std deviation of 7""... this can help you figure out the probability of an event that hasn't ever happened happening, by doing the math.

You can calculate the odds of flipping a coin and getting 10000 heads in a row, even if it has never happened in real life.

The probability is 1 in 2^10000, by the way which means if you flip 10,000 coins, you should expect to get all heads once every 19950631168807583848837421626835850838234968318861924548520089498529438830221946631919961684036194597899331129423209124271556491349413781117593785932096323957855730046793794526765246551266059895520550086918193311542508608460618104685509074866089624888090489894838009253941633257850621568309473902556912388065225096643874441046759871626985453222868538161694315775629640762836880760732228535091641476183956381458969463899410840960536267821064621427333394036525565649530603142680234969400335934316651459297773279665775606172582031407994198179607378245683762280037302885487251900834464581454650557929601414833921615734588139257095379769119277800826957735674444123062018757836325502728323789270710373802866393031428133241401624195671690574061419654342324638801248856147305207431992259611796250130992860241708340807605932320161268492288496255841312844061536738951487114256315111089745514203313820202931640957596464756010405845841566072044962867016515061920631004186422275908670900574606417856951911456055068251250406007519842261898059237118054444788072906395242548339221982707404473162376760846613033778706039803413197133493654622700563169937455508241780972810983291314403571877524768509857276937926433221599399876886660808368837838027643282775172273657572744784112294389733810861607423253291974813120197604178281965697475898164531258434135959862784130128185406283476649088690521047580882615823961985770122407044330583075869039319604603404973156583208672105913300903752823415539745394397715257455290510212310947321610753474825740775273986348298498340756937955646638621874569499279016572103701364433135817214311791398222983845847334440270964182851005072927748364550578634501100852987812389473928699540834346158807043959118985815145779177143619698728131459483783202081474982171858011389071228250905826817436220577475921417653715687725614904582904992461028630081535583308130101987675856234343538955409175623400844887526162643568648833519463720377293240094456246923254350400678027273837755376406726898636241037491410966718557050759098100246789880178271925953381282421954028302759408448955014676668389697996886241636313376393903373455801407636741877711055384225739499110186468219696581651485130494222369947714763069155468217682876200362777257723781365331611196811280792669481887201298643660768551639860534602297871557517947385246369446923087894265948217008051120322365496288169035739121368338393591756418733850510970271613915439590991598154654417336311656936031122249937969999226781732358023111862644575299135758175008199839236284615249881088960232244362173771618086357015468484058622329792853875623486556440536962622018963571028812361567512543338303270029097668650568557157505516727518899194129711337690149916181315171544007728650573189557450920330185304847113818315407324053319038462084036421763703911550639789000742853672196280903477974533320468368795868580237952218629120080742819551317948157624448298518461509704888027274721574688131594750409732115080498190455803416826949787141316063210686391511681774304792596709376 times."

insaneparents,fdpesql,t1_fdpc9so,1578626778.0,"I am not arguing that they don't deserve to be charged with a crime, I am arguing that charging them with a crime won't reduce the number of parents who are anti-vax and won't get more parents to vaccinate their kids.

These parents are dumb, and think not vaccinating is the safer choice. If you tell them they will be charged with a crime if their kid gets another kid sick, they will think, ""well I REALLY shouldn't get my kid vaccinated, because I read on this blog that vaccines can give you the disease, so if I vaccinate my kid, it will be MORE likely that they get some other kid sick and I would have to go to jail! I am certainly not vaccinating my kid!""

Like I said, these parents are dumb; they believe they are making the healthy choice not vaccinating.

I feel like some people think anti-vax people are lying about thinking vaccines are bad and are secretly not vaccinating their kids because they want their kid to die. If that were true, then sure, adding punishment for someone getting hurt from their decision might help.

They aren't lying about their beliefs, they just are dumb. Adding consequences to something they honestly believe won't happen isn't going to change their behavior.

Imagine if someone told you their was a dragon in your house, and you better burn it down, or you will go to jail for the damage the dragon does. You aren't going to burn down your house, because you know there isn't a dragon in your house. Adding more penalties to the damage this 'dragon' does is not going to convince you the dragon is real, and you aren't going to change your behavior.

Anti-vax people are just like this, but they are wrong about them facts.
Mandate vaccines, that is how you increase vaccination numbers."
insaneparents,fdpc562,t1_fdpbu0s,1578624931.0,"That I can get behind.

I like the laws that say you can't go to school if you don't vaccinate. Maybe do other things, like an expensive tax you have to pay to fund the extra health care costs caused by your negligence."
insaneparents,fdpbe3q,t1_fdofvu6,1578624411.0,"I get the sentiment, but punishing parents whose kids die isn't going to make more parents vaccinate their kids.

It isn't like these parents WANT their kids to die; they think they are making the choice that will keep their kids alive. If you tell them they will go to jail if their kids die, they will still not vaccinate their kids.

These aren't parents that don't love their kids, they are just idiots. Ask ANY parent (including anti vax parents), and they would rather go to jail than have their kid die. The punishment for fucking this up is your kid dying, and they STILL think the best choice is to not vaccinate.

Increasing the penalty won't do anything."
