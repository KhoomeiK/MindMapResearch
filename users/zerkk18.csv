theXeffect,ff7hp94,t3_erwcof,1579649802.0,Love the quote highlighted in green!
arkhamhorrorlcg,ff55wxs,t1_ff4wibp,1579581137.0,"You're right, it's not on this shelf. They did have other AH products elsewhere in the store (a new arrivals section and some endcaps). They might have been in another location. I would never buy it there as it's full MSRP and Amazon has had it for $22.99 for some time now."
arkhamhorrorlcg,ff55rok,t1_ff21bim,1579581017.0,That's awesome! Funny you should say that because I was just looking to order the Silas book online as well.
arkhamhorrorlcg,ff21f51,t1_ff21bim,1579491213.0,It's always fun to look at least! I ended up with The Dirge of Reason novella. The first one I've ever bought so I'm excited to read it.
arkhamhorrorlcg,ff21b5l,t3_er79nh,1579491131.0,Not sure if this will be interesting to anyone else but I always love seeing so much product and being to buy almost any expansion needed. Interestingly they didn't have the Countless Terrors playmat in stock although it is in stock on their website.
Journaling,feltzhz,t1_felq4m5,1579230887.0,Yes! Just follow the link OP posted. It's available for shipping to the US.
Journaling,fek95xd,t1_fek4c2o,1579195206.0,"Amazon's website said they will have some of the SEQES journals in stock on 01/20/20! I've never used that one before, I'll have to look into it. :)"
playingcards,feivvpr,t3_epaha6,1579148633.0,Nice! What's the name of the deck on the left?
Journaling,feivrqm,t3_ep3vcb,1579148550.0,Thanks for posting this!!! I've been looking for a nice notebook with heavier paper. Can't wait for mine to arrive!!
Journaling,feivojm,t1_fehol0y,1579148482.0,You can order it through the UK site! Shipping wasn't free but everything ended up being about $21. I think that's super reasonable as the Leuchtturms are 19.99 plus tax.
arkhamhorrorlcg,fe416g8,t3_eneqel,1578854779.0,This sounds awesome! I hope the event goes swimmingly and really wish I was local.
brandonsanderson,fe40tbr,t1_fe00m7z,1578854656.0,"Cool, thanks for the response! That's a neat way to fix the problem."
brandonsanderson,fdzw29t,t3_end26g,1578797171.0,"Wait, does he sign them and then they are binded into the books?!"
taekwondo,fdzvqoj,t3_enacez,1578796943.0,Where did he actually hit the other guy? (Hard to tell in the video)
arkhamhorrorlcg,fdi6ror,t3_ekl9tk,1578436742.0,"Thanks for posting this OP! I was trying to find one of these for a couple of months but was coming up empty handed. (and didn't feel compelled to pay marked up prices due to them not being ""in print"") 

Does anyone have a recommendation for what to store the mat in? Guess I haven't received mine yet but would like some type of plasticy tube."
arkhamhorrorlcg,fdi4vpz,t3_elfaam,1578435777.0,I've never purchased one of these before but I'm very intrigued. Are they generally considered to be worth the money?
todayilearned,fd77i5j,t1_fd52kx7,1578200439.0,Rapping in Dolphin... Freaking hilarious!!!

MealPrepSunday,fchibwo,t1_fc9mc60,1577650699.0,Does this make around 8 meals? (Just counted the ones in your photo but wanted to double check)
MealPrepSunday,fchhdhb,t1_fccc9oj,1577650490.0,My friend gifted me his old rice cooker and have to say it is an absolute must. I'm excited to try this! Thank you for the info! (Never realized I could be so excited to cook rice ðŸ˜‚)
MealPrepSunday,fccb8t6,t1_fccalr1,1577596432.0,"I've never thought that the coating may impact the flavor. Thank you so much for the detailed response, it is awesome!!! Rice on, friend! Bonus question, favorite type of rice for fried rice?"
MealPrepSunday,fcc8zao,t1_fcak8bx,1577595721.0,Stupid question..Do you still rinse if you used a rice cooker?
Journaling,fcb686m,t1_fcb1lrc,1577582895.0,Slick page? Which page is slick?
Journaling,fc5ufl5,t1_fc5t8ur,1577466132.0,Oh! That sounds really neat! I never knew what those doors were called but I like the idea for bujo-ing!
Journaling,fc5kfgw,t3_eg67xm,1577459992.0,Dutch door thing?

CoolCollections,fblwiib,t1_far8c2v,1576972123.0,"Yes, just blank! A bunch are graph paper inside. I think some have lines or dots."
