researchchemicals,fegp8kr,t1_fegk4rb,1579099275.0,"Cannabis is one of the most unique substances out there with all of the different variations as well as what is activated at certain temperatures from combustion to vaping. For example almost all of the THC-X compounds are inactive over 375 to 500 some odd degrees. So if you are using flower, it’s almost impossible to gauge that. If you are dabbing concentrates and utilizing temperature control with the real American quartz At the proper range… You can definitely see the difference.

With tryptamine‘s in certain things such as MDMA… They have incredibly different effects and I have never partake in in many of the other subcategories of the DMT range except for 15 years ago with straight DMT and even then that definitely would affect the experience. Things such as MDMA, even after 6 to 10 hours, smoking a blunt would bring you back into that roller coaster up-and-down feeling of getting right back into rolling… The first time that happened it was something I never expected and actually scared me LOL"

I personally really enjoy the 40 and find that the rotating barrel really takes some getting used to. Once I got the feel for it, it really feels greats for a .40 s&w. It has a double and single action and has a 14-round firing capability. It has a locked breech with, a slide-mounted decocker and a manual safety. Interchangeable back straps and magazine release which is really comfortable."

thesopranos,fdgdcvd,t3_el98x5,1578391368.0,"It’s very much a combination of what we started with at the very beginning with Tony and the flock of mallards that were in his pool. He sees them grow up and eventually leave and this definitely has a trigger on both his past as well as current relationship with his family.

Interestingly enough, this is one of the first times that we see Tony begin to really get into gambling, I believe that they say they took out a $200,000 insurance policy just weeks before and then this happened… The way that it happened was very similar to the lightbulb incident in season one with the restaurant also. 

We could see the almost half dozen actions that Tony had to deal with and at his lowest point, we can see that Ralph is dealing with his kid in the hospital… And we can see Tony have his first real connection with A specific animal once again which meant quite a lot to him especially with the interest he took in pie o my - for that to be immediately taken away and in such a horrific manner we can see that Tony really lost his grip and the sour cream didn’t really make a difference in the eggs at the end of the day. 

For him, this was the end of the rope and even though Ralph was his highest earner and in the scene just before hand in the Bing, with his kid in the hospital, he was still viewed just as rude well as he could’ve been by bringing in an envelope. We hear several times throughout the series that you’re only as good as your last envelope. 

At this point, even though we feel the sincerity that Ralph says he didn’t do it… Tony doesn’t seem to believe him; probably because of his lack of interest growing and growing after the fact of Tony stepping in and giving advice, dealing with the vet bills previously, the insurance that was taken out before this race, and all of the other multitude of problems he had with Ralph. 

We also see the confrontation between Tony and Chris as he is shooting up and immediately needs to help take care of the situation. I think this aspect plays into Tony’s mind later along in the following two seasons with the ultimate end of that story line and the car crash; but that might be pulling the strings a little bit too far. 

Just several episodes before, Tony is looking to distance himself and allow Christopher to take over the main responsibilities and this just goes to show that he is still on the same path and cannot be trusted, potentially, because of his drug problem. 

When you take everything together, along with the sense that it was purposefully done… We are left with the lone shot of the goat by itself - and that beautiful animal of being dragged away as it was burned alive and had to be put down. Pie o my meant a lot to Tony, so much so that he even brought Carmela to the stables just before hand, so I think when you put everything together… We can see that this is just one of the points and where Tony is at a standstill and must make a point regardless if Ralph was his biggest earner and A made a man versus his own personal selfishness and feelings along with his impulsiveness."
CasualConversation,fdgb1tu,t3_el82v0,1578387982.0,Maybe try going to see the health center and get a referral for a psychiatrist… They could possibly prescribe you a short term dose of a benzodiazepines such as Valium or alprazolam to help with sleeping and stress. Be incredibly careful and keep the dose super low and only when needed so you don’t develop a tolerance because those withdrawls can be horrible but it could definitely help potentially.
TrueFilm,fdga6xs,t3_el79w5,1578386776.0,"The score was absolutely incredible along with the cinematography, acting as well as the back-and-forth juxtaposition between the two main actors. Anthony Hopkins did an outstanding job with his nuanced dialogue which really added a lot of depth and cohesiveness to the entire film. I’m not sure about most of the religious details and I know that from the few reviews I looked at that most people were quite upset within The catholic reddit Community from the few reviews I read, but I thought this was an absolutely spectacular film.

Especially - spoiler - how at the end of the series, she is basically alone and taking care of the children. She was born into such a difficult situation and it fucked her (and of course, her brother Billy) to a serious point. 

I still hate seeing how she hurt Nate with the college boys and the massage stuff, but she plays the role with such authenticity and vulnerability..... 

Damn it, time for a rewatch! (I have my gf on S03E01 now - but it’s been a while since we could sit down and really watch). She’s not toooo into long, drawn out, hour long shows. Between Six Feet Under and (one day) The Sopranos, which I am constantly rewatching in the background, I love introducing and rewatching these types of shows. 

It’s hard to find the level of depth, writing, acting and overall style that shows like these two, or the wire - for example - had). Man, HBO was killing it in the late 1999-early 2000’s period with those three alone.

Here is a quote from some BS article about it being inappropriate lol - but I believe that the info originally came from an AMA, ironically! 


In an interview Cranston told a ""funny story.""

We all have a lot of fun. You pull some practical jokes from time to time. For the episode where one of Jesse's guys gets ripped off, I go to his house and I pull out a gun and put it on the counter and say, ""I want you to handle it."" Well, props had a dildo, and I'm all serious and Aaron didn't know so I'm looking at him and I pull out the dildo and say, ""I want you to handle it."" He looks down and sees that and it's all over. [Laughs]
