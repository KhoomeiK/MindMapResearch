college,fcvnaum,t3_cwufdh,1578005786.0,"Hello! 

My mom recently died and I have a shit dad who only tries to be in my life when there's something in it for him. I have contacted the people in charge of fasfa and the department of education and they have told me to contact my school's financial aid department. My school wants my useless dad to sign my fasfa. I do not talk to this man other than things about my moms remaining debt. My parent plus loan was cancelled and I had to guilt him into cosigning a private loan (this took a week and a half). I had no one else besides my mother. I have her fsa id account information and since there is no option on fasfa for people who come from single parent households can I just go ahead and sign it? Or should i just give up on my fasfa?"
college,fcvn253,t3_ej4dia,1578005635.0,Some of my professors are like this. My school recently put in dead lines for final grades( not just for seniors anymore) for everyone.
relationship_advice,fcvm9jq,t1_fctvx27,1578005138.0,Same to me too! If he expects her to go down on him but he wont do the same there is a huge issue.
relationship_advice,fcvlyjz,t1_fcq4cz5,1578004949.0,This sounds like an excuse tbh. If it wasnt having a career then it wouldve been something else. 6 years is alot to throw away just because your parents pressured you. She has no spine. Find a woman with a backbone to support you through thick and thin. My family has been pressuring me to break up with my bf. I just let them say what they have to say and move on.

menstruation,faq5lb9,t3_ea5r0x,1576298214.0,This is me too! I got checked out for everything including endometriosis and nothing. Just bad luck! It also took me a while to find the right birthcontrol because after a while my symptoms came back. Good luck to you!
