Let her go, she will come back when she's bored type thing. Maybe he was a bit nervous and saw you with your mates bf being all close and wanted to retaliate? I wasn't there, I can't say, but IMO I'd say nothing there was dramatically concerning, the opposite. Different things have different meanings to people, maybe he knows he cares a lot about you (I love you thing) but doesn't yet see the future as he's enjoying the now. Id say you was the priority, not like he invited her to sleep with the two of you, he invited you to show you off to his friends at his birthday party only 2 months into a relationship. All the feedbacks been positive... You sure you're not the priority? If you were secure and happy and loved up, wouldn't you be happy to just be yourself with your SO? Mia might well just fizzle off anyway over time as you two spend more time together, some of these hanging on friends do. 
Relax, let him be who he is, be who you are, don't play any games to test a theory, be honest and take it gentle, just like you want."

Would you hug this guy friend or have you had any moments with him in the same way? I'd personally say that I wouldn't give an SO a toothbrush until 4 months in at least, a mate if I had a spare one then bosh, there it is. But the relationship with my mate is likely older than 2 months.
Hes not your ex. Maybe give him a chance to fuck up on his own! Reddit is too full of cynical loners whose only idea is to break it off. You're literally in something new, it's hard to separate the depth of your old relationship and the expectation of the same with the new."
relationship_advice,ff71xt6,t1_ff709v1,1579639498.0,"I think if you've reached an empasse with the friend and she's so stubborn she's right, there's not a lot of choices left. I also don't think that any abuse should be played down. I wonder what the advice would be if it was the other way around.
Also, just to be clear, IF it's unresolvable with the friend. I understand entirely where Ben is. It's embarrassing to admit to friends about a shit partner. It's worse to have to deal with it with people you don't know, in public. What I'd have given for that very same conversation. 

I think the better person would try and resolve it. If OP has no luck with the convo, or it's getting to the point of not wanting to be around this girl, the best thing she can do is have a conversation with Ben, in one of these public environments. It's the most adult thing to do."
relationship_advice,ff6xzyb,t1_ff6x9xp,1579637208.0,"I think you're entirely wrong, how is preventing abuse not the right thing to do? The OP has literally said that her friend is being an asshole to him and all the friend group sees it, so we aren't talking small minor things. I think this girl has lost a lot of respect from her friends and if she has no shame about how she behaves toward him in public, is that someone you really want to be associated with anyway?
What I have said is that if this friend is so adamant that treating someone like that is OK then she won't listen to reason. So you talk to the one being abused. Maybe he doesn't see it. Maybe, just maybe, all that shite behaviour is crushing him inside and as a bloke, you're not allowed to feel like this or have this weakness.

I think any advice that doesn't address the abuse is bad advice, plus I think my self respect wouldn't want to leave him being abused. I think it's fucked up to take the weak option and walk away. Period."

And you being happy is important to me. Do you want to talk about it? I'm happy to share how I feel, too"".
Equally, it's really hard to hear that they don't want to share. It's nowt to do with you on the opposite side of it and you don't know how they will feel. I'd prepare for some initial push back, but you might be surprised with both how much respect you'll generate for how adult you're tackling it and how much sometimes a parent needs someone to open up to that can understand. It's really embarrassing for some to be in a failing marriage (personal experience, I can only be vocal about it here) and to share it with friends before anythings happened is tough."

That sounds like where your dad's parking his car right now.
When there's so much hardship, it's hard to see any positives. He's weary of telling her how bad her spending habits wreak havoc on the family. Him. She's fed up of him having a go at her and she's trying, what more does he want.
All pants to be on the sidelines for. But tell them how you feel. Yes you have younger siblings but that doesn't mean it wouldn't be better for everyone if they either sort it out or divorce.
Be honest with them from the outside. Remember good times you've witnessed, if you want you can tell them you're happy to support them whichever way they go and you're happy with how amicable they're being right now. IMO"

I bet her parents were just like it and I have a feeling she's one of these self entitled individuals from all the snapping and belittling of Ben, it's a control mechanism. The dragging you into it is for validation, you get the version that makes her most right and as she wouldn't win the argument with Ben for whatever reason of her behaviour or actions, she comes to you to slag him off and be told she is right after all. Its an awful place to be as a friend and it just shouldn't happen.
I can't get divorced for 5 more months. I am that Ben. Help Ben out and tell him what you think. My wife's best friend did the same on our wedding day, she said I really can't get over even today how she speaks to you. It flipping hurt, but I appreciated it. Wished it had been sooner and I'd have gotten over my embarrassment of having to admit to family and friends she just hadn't grown up enough to be in a marriage and cancelled the whole thing. I didn't have any strength to do it until I heard those words from someone who can give me a fair assessment. Its ruined my life. All for a few simple words from someone who has the best perspective on her.

You can try talk to her about it, but I don't know where you'd start. Especially if she's been coming to you for validation for so long. Maybe try a coaching type method next time she does that validation thing, like ""what happened for him to say/do that"" or ""what do you think his perspective is on it?"" coz maybe she has a little decency and it'll trigger that part of her brain to realise somethings up.
Or ask for her advice about 'another friend' who is behaving like it, wrap it up with Why's that you and Ben?"

Sometimes it's coz there are problems at home. Maybe the person being cheated on was too wrapped up in themselves to actually listen to the other. Some are just so selfish that they don't care about anyone else's feelings and cheat coz it's available. Maybe, just maybe there's no other way out than to give the ultimatum, sort out your neglect in this relationship or I'll find someone to replace what you don't make effort for.

changemyview,feqg8qp,t1_fenxzn1,1579341486.0,"You've entirely assumed that the goal for both entities is for the original entity to which is being forced upon by the other entity to have to assimilate, or that there are benefits to having done that. Now consider in your car that sexiness isn't in fact a necessary or required trait. Now youve got a good car that worked very well that's had to change to accommodate an otherwise useless function. No one said that the first culture wanted the second culture in the first place. Many reasons for migration are for a better life, which in itself entirely lends itself to the fact that sexy really isn't that sexy or the boring car people would be moving the other way. Net migration around the world is largely one way, from one culture to another. The imposition of this new, migrant culture isn't therefore the best thing for the original, else they wouldn't have a more attractive proposition in the first place.

For my opinion, the reason the view should be changed here is that national identity shouldn't be labelled as racist, that's the wrong part.

Texts are awful for context anyway and you're the shiny new one to him, too. When you're single you have more friends of the opposite sex. Try putting banter into context when you're not part of the conversation.
Stop snooping. Get to know him, let it be something if its going to be. If it doesn't feel right, let it go, but just know IMO it is wrong to lie to someone by going through their things without consent & it's no way to start a relationship!!

After reading your post, it's not that you don't want children as such, maybe more that you're terrified of having them. What about it makes you afraid? Some from a loving family unit have the pressure of living up to it, some from a hard upbringing fear making the same mistakes they were subject to. Maybe, just maybe, you're afraid of your own ability to raise a kid. Have you spoken to a therapist or someone good with coaching it out of you?
A good family unit takes love and it sounds like you have bundles of that between you. Maybe you need to get over a stigma and if you haven't considered that before you do it, you've lost all that time invested. IMO you'd be better off sure that you don't want children because that's not what you want before you leave him!

Speaking as a person, I think the first place to start is to ask yourself why you're so afraid of marriage? Then, why afraid to do that with her? Can you see her being the mother of your children, taking care of you if you're sick, you doing the same for her?
Maybe here the answer lay in why you don't see it. Even when you're engaged you have no obligation to marry her.
IMO I think it's a bad place to start if you're proposing coz of a hissy fit. If you take nothing from this then take DO NOT GET MARRIED IF ITS NOT RIGHT FOR YOU. So many women out there have children later as well as men. I wouldn't be steered with gender stereotypes of her clock is ticking and you should man up.

If serious, then I think her putting an image of both how fantastic her anatomy is and how rarely it's used, coupled with introducing the competitive come on of 'I don't usually screw guys like you so try your hardest' really kind of sums it up. Sounds like she was fishing for your interest, hasn't had it, nothing ventured nothing gained hence why it's gone back to status quo. I'm not big on lies but DONT tell your wife. Not to create lies etc between you, but IMO all you will do is put unnecessary and undue stress into your own relationship.

The fact his hand touched her bum in any way is maybe taking advantage of the situation he was in at the moment, especially if you don't have these things at home and or your sex life is an issue, or that he just touched it as he put his arm out. If anyone sat on my leg I'd make sure they're properly supported, the fact she was maybe not wearing so much at the time could well be by the by.
The issue here IMO is that no one set boundaries or expectations of the visit before you went, he maybe felt he didn't act inappropriately as there were positive responses from you from the advancement requests he made.

changemyview,fd9c4f4,t3_ek5tap,1578231378.0,"What about promiscuity eroding the value of a relationship? Strictly speaking, nature operates both models & in a survival situation either works as you have much bigger things to worry about such as eating and not being killed to bits. The other issue is with promiscuous animals they are programmed to kill others' young, remove competitors and go for the best specimens. Now introduce the freedom of sex and the lack of societal boundaries and there you have a new system of society wherein which there are far less consequences as a result of everything being OK and values placed in aspects of attractiveness far higher than nurturing one another. Why hang about and be a dad when I can go sleep with more women who are willing and available? Or vice versa of course. Then you create a bigger problem in that there are aspects of society that rely on symbiotic type relationships such as those that do not promote promiscuity and instead retain focus on the well being and security of those within a non promiscuous situation, like the disabled, the young, elderly etc. They may well be valued far less as they can be perceived to offer less to a society that is more about cumming than caring. If you look at how society has moved as promiscuity has become more acceptable, these issues are showing more prevalently than ever and are being picked up by the state. Level of single parents.

The real statement should read, IMO 'I'm too entitled to feel I have to do anything to maintain the lifestyle and quality I have been afforded by those willing to die to protect it before me'. 
War begins because two ideologies don't match. Decisions get made, rightly or wrongly, by elected leaders (whatever your opinion of them) that leave little option. Maybe one feels they should have more resources, but they're scarce so you gotta take them. Like it or not, there's many people in less developed countries who have routinely sold their people out for generations, for slavery and the rest, to further their own situation. Now you have actively aware populations of what they're missing out on they have the motivation to get behind the idea that you having what you have. Whatever level you look at it, War is the only way that a whole country can protect its resources and way of life from another, unless everyone had equal resources and quality of life. Unfortunately that's not possible as resources are different around the world. Then, to dodging out. Where exactly do you feel will be safe in the world if there's a large scale war that gets to the point at which it's army, whose employees are far better than you at doing war, needs you to rock up to protect your way of life, then you and your family are already in danger and that's anywhere in the world. 
Also, don't think that war isn't happening all around you all the time by other governments in different ways. China's dollar war in Asia taking over places like Laos with their money (dollar imperialism) or Russia with just rocking up & taking territory. If you haven't seen the Hong Kong situation and realised that sometimes it's worth risking your life for your family then maybe wonder what you would do if your neighbours rocked up and took your garden fence down to take your garden. What would you do? If you disagreed with their way of life and it was causing you a serious nuisance, are you going to just leave your house to try find refuge elsewhere, damaging someone else's way of life and expectantly waiting for them to take care of you? If more people around the world stood up for what they believed in, maybe there wouldn't be such displacement and there'd be a lot more harmony. 
So if it comes to it and I don't fancy losing my quality of life to someone else's forcible takeover for their own benefit be it ideological or otherwise, then I'd better defend my country and family by joining in.

Just to add, I'd rather stay home and eat pringles than go to war. I really hope the escalating world tension doesn't result in it!!"

There is a way to have a conversation like this which you can prep for before to help you manage your anxiety about the conversation. I will agree with many people, 'happy wife, happy life' doesn't cut it in this day & age and regardless of motive that's a very dangerous mindset & for you to be painted like that, no matter how well people know you, anyone can't help question behind closed doors. Once you've heard it once, it's there the second time.
So you need to brave this out and talk it through. IMO. But if not, this could quickly escalate.
Have you thought about some open questions to challenge where it came from? Like what about me do you consider violent? When have you seen me react so readily to something in that manner before? What made you decide to bring that up with our friends? Etc etc etc. But maybe looking for some clarity around it, her thoughts towards you with some helpful open questions will get this out of her. There's a model called parent/adult/child for managing these things, Google it if you like to give you a bit of technique but it sounds like you have the mannerisms to make that work for you.
IMO I'd like to leave that conversation having bottomed out both why she said it/what her memory is of the incident and what her opinion of you is along the lines of how you react and personality items like this.

Your mum is reaching out to you for a bond she didn't have or develop through you being with your grandparents growing up. Imitation is the best form of flattery & it sounds to me like she is reaching out to know you. Maybe even through living like you & surrounded by things that make up you. Have you asked her (or even yourself) how she, or you, feel about your relationship? I think it would go away if she knew more about you & maybe got a bit of face time. You've moved away, left her life and she is probably feeling it.
Maybe try some empathy, show you miss her too & it's hard for you to find things to remember her by as she's doing things that are just you so you're not getting enough of her. Or not, give her a bit of space but I feel that would just provoke the conversation anyway"
relationship_advice,fc5tkwt,t1_fc57ix3,1577465579.0,"This is brilliant advice and sends a clear message IMO. However, what I'd do differently is give the daughter time to ask questions to gain clarity and understand. There's a huge heap of stuff she's gone through to get to sending her message to you & for the sake of her sanity, let her get it out. Be factual not opinionated with your responses, it's likely she doesn't want to hear about how bad her mum is just now as she comes to terms with a new reality.

Or ignore them both. You don't owe either anything, it's just my opinion that you'd do the not your daughter a world of good and the world needs more friends"
offmychest,fc3vgzx,t3_efxe7a,1577399666.0,"You know what? I cook, I clean, generally look after myself and others oh so proficiently. And what do I get? ""Oh well done for managing to wipe your arse"", like men can't keep a house, themselves or owt else. It's a complete double standard that works both ways so I COMPLETELY understand where you're coming from. You know what I do when someone says something silly like that? Smirk to myself at how silly that person is for their opinion. It's so annoying to hear men put down like this all the time, this comment included for women too. Unfortunately, until the culture is a man can wash up and a woman now the lawn before someone from any party makes a comment disappears, it won't change. IMO all the empowerment movements cause the same thing... Surely everyone's just equal, without one side pointing out how more equal they are than others!! This whole thing really carves my turkey. Its all basic life skills. Men should be able to wash their clothes. Women should be able to fix things. Stupid comments about how wow it is either can do whatever is just pathetic."
funny,fbzxxki,t3_ef4cot,1577267717.0,Why are there no comments dedicated to that glorious haircut?!
changemyview,fbwa5wl,t1_fbw9zmm,1577144579.0,Think you've locked the bike to the right gate there! It's not OK for discrimination in an acceptance type ideology.
