AskReddit,ff4mfjj,t3_ergjyj,1579567151.0,"Okay not retail but restaurant but I need to tell this story. tl;dr at the bottom 

So at our restaurant we serve salade with every meal. It comes in bowls. We've started to notice that most people don't eat their salads. It tastes fine its just that most people prefer to eat their main dishes. We thought that this was a waste of food. 
So we decided that with 4 people we give them 1 bowl of salad. If they want more they can ask for more for free. With 5+ it's 2 bowls 8+ is 3 bowls and so on. 


Okay so there was this table of 4. They where around there 40s/50s. 2 woman, 2 man.

I was putting all their food down and when everything was on their table I said enjoy your food. One of the ladies asked me if this was all the salad they where getting. I explained what I explained here. We don't wanna waste food, but if you want more you can order more.


She looked at me for a second and asked me but why are we getting such little salad. Where with 4 people. This is not enough.


I explained again calmly that we don't wanna waste food so we give this amount but if she wants more she can always, without extra charge, ask for more.


She asked THE EXACT SAME THING TWICE MORE. This was the moment I lost my shit. I said. ""m'am, would you like an extra bowl of salad"" - this came out quite arrogant and rude. She, kinda insulted said yes.


A few minutes later I gave them the salad. Said enjoy, and left.


Guess what? THEY DIDN'T EAT THE SECOND SALAD. I had to throw it out. I saw them leave and asked if she liked the salad. She said yes, but it was a bit to much.


I could not fucking believe this people. And yes. I am getting angry over a salad but wasting food sucks.


Tl;dr.
I explain to a lady we serve one salad per 4 people to avoid food waste and she can order more if she wants. She asks me 4 times why she can't have more. I rudely ask her if she want an extra. I give her one and she doesn't eat it cause it was to much. Food still wasted."

 I'm just saying that getting friendzoned isn't or shouldn't be a thing. Saying a girl friendzoned you is just a guy being salty over the fact she didn't like him back after trying to be more then friends.

If a guy does something for a girl that's nice. She'll try and give something back for it but is not obligated to do so. (and sure, there are girls but also boys who will only take and not give back.) not everyone is bad like you describe, nor is everyone all good.


You say friends don't pay for each other as in one person doesn't (and shouldn't) always have to pay. And that is something you should be able to talk about as friends. You can tell each other you want to share a bill.


And I will not attack you personally as you have already done to me by calling me stupid and bitter. I'm just having an opinion. I'm sorry you experienced ""getting friendzoned""."

This just means that one person is interested romantically and the other is not. No one is obligated to be in a relationship with someone just because they did something nice.

She is not obligated to be in a relationship with him just because he's spending money on her.

AmItheAsshole,feevl6x,t3_eoo84b,1579042158.0,"Hey OP. I understand that these kind of things are difficult to understand considering your mental health.


I'll try to explain the best I can.


A mother should not record conversations you're having with her. This is not okay behavior especially because she shares it with her friends with the intention of making fun of you. 


It's okay for a mom to want to know where her child is. But actually tracking is also not okay behavior. There should be some sort of trust between you two so that you can tell by yourself where you are.


Your mother is not being a good mother. I'd try to talk about this with your mother one more time. Tell her that this makes you feel insecure, not respected, and not wanna talk with her anymore. If this does not work or records you again, leave. 


See if there's someone you can talk with. Is there anyone around you that you can talk with about this? Family you can trust or maybe even parents from friends. Maybe they can help you.


Good luck and stay safe. <3"
