introvert,ff6l05n,t3_eru6l5,1579629447.0,Yes. Set some standards and don’t be so fearful of being alone that you get desperate. Remember who you are...you were born choosy ✊🌞
fasting,ff69ip8,t3_eruy4f,1579622287.0,Wow. Don’t stop now!👌🏻

pharmacy,ff60q79,t3_erq2xm,1579616144.0,"Start some long term planning to get out of the biz. Use that science know how to morph into something else. Keep documenting your current experience and use it as a foundation for something else. 
I’m pulling for you.  All respect ✊

Frugal,ff5zxd6,t3_eruzjs,1579615514.0,"Lunch when I was 6 years old. The chips didn’t have ridges in 1955. This was it though, with a tiny bottle of milk. 
Thanks for the memory. 💕"
zerocarb,fezsvse,t3_eqyldm,1579461223.0,If your gynecologist also does obstetrics inform him or her of your plan. Get all the info on pregnancy for the older mother then use your own good sense to make your decision. Do the  best you can for your family and don’t look back except in joy.
introvert,fev1qby,t1_feqjgtu,1579392149.0,"I worked nights for 15 years (Rn) to avoid the whirling nuttiness. Too many people, phones ringing, machines alarming. Upset family members...it helped but night work is stressful too. It’s living upside down. Especially if you have a family.
Try to avoid night work if you can. I know warehouse workers and security guards work nightshifts frequently—just be careful of your health.   Vitamin C!!"
simpleliving,fetlejv,t3_eqkhyv,1579376562.0,"Twice a year I go for a facial and some eyebrow waxing — maybe a pedicure. I go to a really nice spa (foot-soak, robe, tea). That’s it. It’s so worth it."
solotravel,feszncf,t1_fehsibf,1579370484.0,This is why I travel alone. I’m much better by myself and have much better memories. Traveling alone IS ‘the time of my life’.
solotravel,fesyv0i,t1_fen15ot,1579370277.0,I’ve traveled a lot too. No bedbugs so far.
worldnews,fesu9cc,t3_eqgy8h,1579369045.0,"Does our President know there’s an International Criminal Court?  Another shock for the Donald. He’ll be crony-stacking it soon. 
What’s the mechanism for that?"
introvert,fep3h1a,t3_eq0d60,1579311289.0,"Something with people involved. You’ll have pleasant superficial relationships (or occasionally unpleasant— but that’s life) then you can go home and do what you like. 
Sometimes you’ll meet someone who’s your type and understands. 
Job suggestions:
Lab tech: draw a little blood and wave goodbye
Librarian: Archive something, find someone a rare reference and wave...
Supermarket customer service: direct folks to the pet food section then to soy sauce...have a brief chat about vindaloo & smile & wave. 
Lots of jobs around like this. You’ll need some finesse at times & some expertise depending...
What’s your interest as far as a work life goes?"
introvert,fep1kzo,t3_eq50jh,1579310090.0,"After college I got my friends thru my work. Working let me hide behind the role I filled but some folks crept thru my wall and became very nice acquaintances. Some of them were introverts too.  I am a person who prefers quiet and I like to study and think. When pressed to do more I smile and make my apologies. Sometimes I need to be a little cold or rude. 
Very rarely I’m lonely but I go for a walk or eat lunch out, pass the time with neighbors and I’m cured.  Being alive in the world isn’t all bliss. We are what we are and live with it. Make the most of who you are.  I’m very old now; I like the life I’ve lived.  Best to all!"

gardening,femsnrz,t3_eprrcz,1579268477.0,"From what I can see of it it looks like a jasmine which grows as a vine and has the most lovely small, white scented flowers. I don’t know if it can be trained as a tree but it certainly could be trained along a trellis. (If it is what I think it may be). Don’t be disappointed— it will be beautiful.

explainlikeimfive,felfo71,t3_eps9ze,1579221066.0,You’re asking good questions.  You’re on the right track. See a medical pro that you trust and read the literature. Don’t be mislead.

expats,feevuam,t3_ekakma,1579042312.0,"I stopped feeling the necessity for personal borders. Countries need them it seems but individuals like me (or us) are mystified by them. I don’t want to be limited or identified by borders — I want to meet people everywhere and live and suffer and die among them. All of them. 
It is a puzzle. Too bad we can only be in one place at a time."

Delaware too."
simpleliving,fcyt1i8,t3_ejfhs9,1578086457.0,"I grew up in a family like this. Even if I went to a doctors appointment everybody wanted to come. 
And everyone hung one everyone else’s opinion. 
Critiques came hard and fast if an event of any kind wasn’t sanctioned by the ‘hive’. Yikes!!
Their way or the highway so now I live 3500 miles away in a small, perfect place ‘with loved ones far away’. 
It was hard to make the decision but I’ve never regretted it.   
I’ve heard this called an ‘enmeshed family’ but I’ve never looked it up. 
Best of luck, I’ll be thinking about you."
toastme,fcq1n6r,t3_eieqj6,1577876793.0,Grad school?!!  Hot dang. Keeping stepping I’m mighty proud of you. If 600 miles isn’t far enough just keep on going.
toastme,fcq0jfh,t3_eidcz9,1577876138.0,Many hugs and kisses. Now and always.
toastme,fcpynqu,t3_eia84q,1577874990.0,"I felt like that, sometimes I still do. My kids are in their 40’s now, I get my strength from them. The beauties of life and love and keeping on are worth it. Life is rich in ways that are impossible to explain or understand. I’m 71, I’m tired but I’m glad. Every good thing to you and yours."
dogs,fcluw6r,t3_eho07v,1577757049.0,"I love dogs but when I was down they were a little too much work for me, they needed love and energy and I had very little to give. I got a cat—perfect!  I’m working up to adding an apartment sized dog. 
Feeling good. ❤️To you all"

I’m a low will power, retired medical professional with some outlaw colleagues if I need them. My regular doc is lovely and intelligent but is owned by a LARGE HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION and has to watch the algorithm for acceptable instruction. 
I’ll be careful and thanks to all for your helpful, prudent advice. I won’t stray too far outside the boundaries. Hugs all around!!
