Now you can sit there and last hit while your mid walks back to lane and flames you for taking Cs and soaking xp and then doesn’t yell at the tower or minions for doing the same.

worldnews,fctx878,t1_fctrwdt,1577964136.0,"Leave to go where?  I dunno...somewhere that isn’t on fire?  The same thing happens in all big disasters.  Even when people get warned about hurricanes, they stay home and say “I’m not going anywhere.”  Then the hurricane comes and kills half their neighborhood and they say “we weren’t warned.”  

There’s fire for miles. They can see the smoke in the sky miles away.  There is no amount of man-effort that can stop something so big. THERE ARE NO MORE FUCKING KOALAS. And somehow people still stay in their homes thinking it could be safe?

On top of this, volunteer firefighters are driving into the flames they have no chance of controlling, thinking they can save something with a kiddie pool in their truck.   But your right. I am the idiot here.  

They’re fucked. They need to get the fuck out and figure out how and where they can cut their losses.  But fuck me for stating that.  

Raging hell fires of Armageddon in the sky and I’m the asshole for saying “Hey maybe you should take initiative and go the fuck away from that while you have what you might think is an overkill time buffer for survival.”"

AskMen,fcg3m7d,t3_egz7x9,1577636214.0,"I left college early and followed my interests through my twenties. I felt like I was better for it until my thirties.  Many of my friends had immense college debt but they all have it paid off or managed and live in their dream homes with their wives and children. 

I never had any long term payouts, and never made enough to write home about.   Now I am 33, and I am a solid year into working toward retirement. It sucks. I’m looking at doing hard labor until I am at least 60yrs old.  I probably won’t make it that far.  I might make it half way.  I drive way too far for work and spend too much time in my car away from my family. 

I guess what I want to get to is this.  Make sure you have long term payment included in your wages.  You deserve something for giving up years of your life.  Don’t be loyal to a company. They’ll pay the least amount possible to secure you as an asset.  After a year or two some other company will pay you more with no actual evidence that you’re worth your asking price, while your current company isn’t going out of their way to pay you your worth.  They never do and never will without a fight.   Don’t be loyal. 

Do whatever you love. Do what interests you.  Follow your passion, but make sure there is some long term goal you’re working for, or you’ll be in your mid thirties scrounging together some way to live with nothing to show for your decades of hard work."
