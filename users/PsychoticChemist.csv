politics,fei1co2,t1_fegua6d,1579128143.0,"Sure, people will use more healthcare if we shift to a M4A system that includes zero copays and deductibles. That’s a good thing. It’s a tragedy that people are currently foregoing needed medical treatment as a result of high deductibles or being underinsured overall. If you’re arguing that M4A will cost more simply because more people will be seek medical treatment under that system, that’s an oversimplification of the issue. 

If Sanders had his way, we would be paying significantly less for prescription drugs and life saving medical treatments overall, which is very doable when you compare those costs in the US versus abroad (we pay way more). And if we’re able to shift a large amount of that cost burden directly onto the federal government, it’s even more likely that Sanders would be able to reduce those drug/treatment costs. When the cost burden is mostly on the individual consumer as a result of high deductibles, there’s not as much motivation at the federal level to address the issue of overpriced drugs and medical treatments. 

Even if you were correct in your assertion that we’ll spend more with M4A as a result of increased doctor visits, I’d prefer to spend more federally to ensure that everyone in the US can afford to go to the doctor any time they need to, even if that cost differential comes out of Americans’ pockets in the form of increased taxes (particularly on the top earners)."

politics,fd01eev,t1_fcshmd9,1578112191.0,"Yeah I recognize the complications associated with such a setup, which is why I haven’t expressed any opinions here or advocated for any particular economic system up until now. There are major downsides to most proposed systems, and while there are foreseeable solutions, few of them are achievable without significant destabilization along the way before things equalize. Ideally, what I’d love to see is a system in which as few people as possible (optimally zero) experience poverty. My ideal scenario probably involves a large universal basic income and a tax level that makes it impossible to become a billionaire as long as there are still people who are unable to pursue what they want in life due to financial limitations, even if what they want in life doesn’t involve generating much revenue."

SandersForPresident,fca9onu,t1_fc2i88h,1577565246.0,"Of course, but my point was that there are alternative explanations and thus it’s irrational to assume it’s aliens, just like it would be irrational to assume it’s anything else that’s equally specific and unsubstantiated. I’m not saying it can’t be aliens, I’m saying that that’s just one of many possible explanations and we would need more information to reasonably say anything more than that."

todayilearned,fc2xe6x,t1_fc2nw5a,1577376569.0,"Benzaldehyde is generally considered to be the primary cause of the typical scent of domesticated sweet almonds (the kinds you’re describing). The cyanide concentration is too low to be the main factor contributing to the smell of almonds. But it is often said that benzaldehyde and HCN emit a similar odor. Interestingly, they’re also both byproducts of the enzymatic catalysis of amygdalin.

[Here is the structure of amygdalin](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Amygdalin_structure.svg). For any layman who’s curious - you can see the cyano group (-CN) on the bottom right end of the molecule which can be cleaved and protonated to produce HCN, aka hydrogen cyanide, and the remaining benzaldehyde-like fragment, attached to the benzylic position the cyano group was previously attached to, can be cleaved and oxidized (basically) to produce the benzaldehyde. This leaves us with the rest of the disaccharide that we don’t care about in this case."
SandersForPresident,fc2fh5w,t1_fc2f2dw,1577357210.0,"You’ve misread my comment. When did I imply that you claimed you had the answer? I was just responding to the inevitable claim that aliens are responsible for those UFOs, whether it’s you or anyone else who makes that claim.  This is literally a thread about aliens. I can’t help but notice the irony in your comment about “reading comprehension”...

Secondly, I didn’t act like “it doesn’t exist”. I’m just poking at the argument that the observation of unexplained flying objects is direct evidence of alien life. And did you really just say I don’t try to explain it? I listed off multiple possibilities for explaining the footage, which are at least equally likely as the alien theory. Observing flying objects in the sky that behave strangely is not evidence for alien life — it’s literally just evidence of flying objects that behave oddly. Lol. Where is the empirical connection between weird flying objects and alien life? You would need to find that connection before you could classify this as extraordinary evidence.

Additionally, you’ve misunderstood me again. I’m not proclaiming that I’m capable of understanding the motivations of some hypothetical hyper-intelligent life form — I’m just proposing alternative ideas to demonstrate that the claim that these flying objects are alien space ships is unsubstantiated, because there’s a huge number of potential alternative explanations, and other ways to think about the scenario. Just because I don’t understand these hypothetical aliens doesn’t mean I can’t extrapolate or speculate about their intent. It just means I can’t make bold and overly confident claims about them without additional evidence.

Lastly, you’ve said my comment contains “denier type tropes” which is obviously absurd; I’ve made it abundantly clear that the burden of proof is on the person claiming that these objects are aliens. Until there is a substantial amount of evidence to support that claim, there is no reason to assume they’re aliens. That doesn’t make me a “denier”, that just makes me somebody who understands the scientific method and doesn’t make unsubstantiated shit up. I’m totally open to the idea that alien life exists, and I’m not even saying they haven’t visited earth, I’m just saying that I’d need to see more reliable evidence of that before I start making claims about them with any degree of real confidence."
SandersForPresident,fc2es7w,t1_fc2eet3,1577356033.0,"You can’t explain it either. When it comes to extraordinary claims such as the presence of alien life on or near earth, extraordinary evidence is required to draw any meaningful conclusions.

The flying objects could have been some top secret government aircraft being tested, or lighting anomalies, or the footage could have been edited (maybe even by the pilots themselves), etc. If there are intelligent life forms out there that are so advanced that they’ve mastered space travel and can travel across solar systems, across many light years, then they probably have little to no interest in humans. And even if they do have some interest in Earth or humanity, why would they just fly around at random in our atmosphere? That would be an unnecessary risk considering that we could view them as a threat and shoot them out of the sky, or interfere some other way. If they’re smart enough to easily traverse huge distances between solar systems or across galaxies, then obviously they’re smart enough to do so undetected."
