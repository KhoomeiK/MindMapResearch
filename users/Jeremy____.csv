Get the new one if you have the money to spare. The original will still be highly relevant in today's world, though."
self,fe5d50d,t1_fe5bu2m,1578867911.0,"Ah. I got you. 

Like I said, I don't know you or your life. But I've been through my own shit, and had/have many of the thoughts you mentioned in this post. I'd rather not share details here, as this account is known to people, but feel free to PM me. And if you'd ever like to talk to someone who might understand, even just a little, add me on Discord: Jeremy (Raolin) #0001."
self,fe5akyb,t3_enot36,1578867064.0,"I usually don't comment on /r/self posts, but yours really spoke to me. I echo a lot of your sentiments. I never set out to succeed for the sake of succeeding. I did it to escape my past life. 
> I didn’t run for first place at some race, I was running away for my fucking life.

This line really got me. I know *exactly* what you mean. My achievements in life are the result of the knowledge that if I fail, my old life will catch up to me. I never had the *option* of failing. 

That being said, I've been doing a lot of thinking in the last few years. I've spoken with friends and mentors I've had. The achievements I've made, *I've made!* I didn't get handed them on a silver platter, I had to earn them. And yeah, the stakes were higher than for a lot of other people, but I still made those achievements. Motivations do not invalidate accomplishments. Mine don't, and neither do yours.

> The feeling you get when get that isn’t a feeling of accomplishment of fulfillment. It’s a feeling you get after running as fast you can as far as you can and realizing you are far enough that you can afford to bend over to gasp and catch your breath. But you don’t let yourself collapse and fully recover, because you know you’ll still have to be running and life doesn’t give you a chance to do that.

I know exactly what you mean. This really sums up the feeling in a way that I've never been able to. But here's the thing; life eventually *does* give you a chance to do exactly that! When it happens, you won't even realize it for a while. You'll tell yourself it's just a short downhill run before you start climbing again. And maybe it is, but eventually, you'll cross that finish line. Everything you do until then should be a way to propel you forward. But it's important to remember that a life exists on the other side of the finish line, and that you need to save a piece of yourself for when that happens. Take time to make friends, try your hand at a new hobby, learn a new professional skill, start online classes, ask that guy/girl out that you've been crushing on.

> Now I have to spend the rest of my life picking up after the damage that was done by my abusers rather than just living my life.

Unless you're saving a sibling from the parent you mentioned, this isn't worth it. I spent years trying to repair damage and resolve differences. It was years wasted. If I had spent that time on myself instead, my life would be infinitely better. I don't know you or your life, but think long and hard about taking on a responsibility like this.

You're clearly driven, strong, capable, and independent. Use those qualities to improve your life; your success will be a sledgehammer in the face of your abusers. 

Keep being you, keep moving forward. You got this!"
selfimprovement,fe4xuuv,t1_fe4t9po,1578863856.0,"Sort of. It's more of a guide on how to be the kind of person that people want to be friends with. It doesn't provide a magic solution on how to pretend to be an extrovert or anything like that.

It has a focus on changing the way that you view and interact with others. In fact, as I was reading it, I didn't really learn anything ""new"". I found myself saying, ""well duh!"", quite a bit. But seeing all these things together forced me to look at them in aggregate. And when viewed as an aggregate, you see how everything impacts your ability to win friends and influence people.

There are many things you can take away from reading it, and I only took 2 things; genuinely care about the people around you. Don't just pretend, actually care. MAKE them important to you. And always offer encouragement. I offer encouragement and praise every opportunity I get; not flattery, I offer genuine praise when they deserve it. I never let an interaction go by without a compliment or a question that shows I care about their life. Those 2 things have changed how people interact with me. People enjoy seeing me walk in their direction because they know they'll have an enjoyable conversation. Those conversations lead to friendships all the time.

If you're interested in reading it, I'd suggest buying the updated version, how to win friends and influence people in the digital age. Same book, updated terminologies and stuff.

EDIT: Re-commented since I added the amazon link to the book in my other comment and it got removed for being in violation of rule #2 :/"
