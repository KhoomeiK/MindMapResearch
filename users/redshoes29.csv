However, I didn't have to pay, and it was pretty valuable to me, especially since I don't eat meat, so she was able to advise about some of the meat replacement food I eat and we were able to go through my favorite dishes and how I could prepare them to suit the gd diet. Example: switching white rice in risotto  with full grain rice or other full grain grains, or how to fat things up, how to sneak in fibers into the pasta I often have...

But, it's nothing I couldn't google, but with the dietitian I was able to go through it all in a few hours."

We had two separate GSDs when I was younger and they both howled occasionally. First one actually did it every time he saw the full moon, like the wolves in movies, so we had to not let him out to the balcony when we noticed a full moon. The second gsd we had did it if he heard the train horn or a siren."

I would block the doggy door and not let the dog unsupervised outside, ever. Dogs normally sleep a lot (15 hours or so), and while you're gone or napping is the perfect time for the dog to get his sleep in as well. Give a kong or another chew inside so he calms down if needed."

The ventilation system with heat recuperation (I hope I translated this to something that means the same thing in english) that we're getting is supposed to deal with this very well, and at the same time it makes airconditioning more effective. It was recommended to us by a few people who also renovated old houses."

Call the plumber. My husband and I also both work and each usually do half of housework, and will do equal shares of childcare when baby comes. My husband is a software developer for work, but does work on the house a bit, did a pretty good job setting tiles in the basement, but we both count his tinkering as a hobby. And we call the plumber, electrician, and all other experienced people who can do work fast and good. If my husband would rather spend 3x time doing the same housefixing project that's his choice, so it's a hobby, I (and him, tbh) still expect him to vacuum and clean the bathroom. That's like gardening is my hobby, as buying vegetables is much quicker and efficient, so if I decide to dig in the dirt for half a day, I really can't say I won't do the dishes because of it."
relationship_advice,ff5wft9,t1_ff5sbxy,1579612533.0,"For me too..I'm expecting our baby in late June, and apparently it's hard for first time moms to breasfeed while gaming, and I'll probably want naps more than games. My husband will be happy to get the controller back, and get some time alone with the baby at the same time. I'm trying to finish up at least Witcher before baby comes, while my husband is leaving games for himself for when he can game with our baby on him :)


I just figured I only gave you a technical gaming with baby advice (which I know works, since my dad did it with me and a lot of my guy friends do it currently). For the relationship advice part...I don't think games are even related to any of your problems, it's just a symptom and a tangible thing your wife can latch on. Even if you didn't game, and would watch Netflix with her, your wife would probably still feel uncherished, unloved, undercuddled, and all else she's feeling. I can assure you that if you fill up her love bucket and do your part at home she won't mind gaming in the least. 4+ hours per day probably won't be achievable with a family and kids (when they start running around) for some time because your work, household, parenting, AND MARRIAGE load will be too big to allow that...but a couple of hours every few days will be. However, if you do everything else, even with flying colors, but ignore working on your marriage, your wife will resent every hobby you have, not realizing that you would equally ignore her and her needs (your marriage needs tbh) even without the hobby.

Seriously, if you take 10 minutes every day to touch her belly and talk to your future baby, she won't fear you'll ignore the baby for gaming. And if you take an hour or so every day for your marriage (that hour is in addition to time spent on sex), *she* won't feel ignored. 

The way you explained how you ignored her requests for cuddling and gamed all the time is really sad, and you have to be aware that emotional and physical rejection like this can leave some wounds and resentment (maybe targeted at vg instead of you, because she loves you). So fixing that will take some TLC and reassurance."
Dogtraining,ff5sxl2,t3_erpbfh,1579609034.0,"Hm, my dog was never a chewer of random objects so my process was just to increase the time I'm gone. He did get into recycling a couple of times (there were empty sardine cans in there so he had to lick them clean), so now when I leave him I just remove that. He also walked the counter and licked some dirty pots and pans from our pasta dinner earlier. So now I make sure there's no dishes to lick and if he doesn't smell anything yummy he doesn't go up the counter. I have a feeling he's happy to be home alone because he can do this kind of stuff, because when I came home once and saw him on the counter through the window, he didn't get excited to see me but froze on spot with one paw in the air...like I won't see him if he stays very still - yea buddy. The recycling might have been in part getting the anxiety out since he also shredded some non fishy smelling plastic bottles that time. However, if I remove recycling he doesn't go after anything else. I still put away my expensive rubber boots, since the rubber might just look, smell and feel to similar to my dog's kong toy...he never tried them, and I *think* he knows they aren't a toy and that if he chews them he won't be seeing the fields until the summer since I won't be able to walk there, but I'm rather safe than sorry.

Does your dog also try to chew things when you're home? If yes, I would first work on that. And then doggy proof one room where he doesn't have anything to chew (or the items he might chew aren't dangerous and dear to you) and start leaving him there."
relationship_advice,ff5s50h,t3_err7bq,1579608155.0,"If you play online games where you yell and can't get out of the game without screwing other people, then that can be a big problem with the baby. If you play solo games that you can pause anytime, that's perfect, since you can take over a lot of baby holding while playing games. Babies like to nap on someone and for mothers that's a big strain, since you can't take a shower or go to the toilet or even take a nap. But if the baby bonds with the dad as well, it's happy to nap on your chest while you game. To make sure the baby bonds with you asap sing songs to her stomach and talk to it so the baby gets used to your voice. And start holding it as much as possible. Then when the baby comes you can hold it for 4+ hours per day while exploring skyrim. That's my husband's plan at least :)"
reactivedogs,ff5i56o,t1_ff4r0eu,1579593946.0,"Yep, but even with the seatbelt my dog can still push on the window button. He might not be able to jump out, but he maybe could get his head stuck or something."
HomeImprovement,ff5hwqj,t1_ff563be,1579593638.0,"We replaced wood windows on our 60 years old farmhouse we're renovating with very high quality PVC windows, and the windows are awesome. However the house didn't take all that well to them, since the wooden windows allowed some draft I guess, and now we have to add ventilation with humidity control, so mold won't start growing.

Our new windows have a middle setting between open and closed (they look completely closed, but aren't air tight) that should allow some air to pass, but we started using it and it's not enough. My kitchen salt got moist, lol.

That's why I would say that new modern vinyl or pvc windows are great for new buildings, but replacing wooden windows on an old house needs a lot of thought."
HomeImprovement,ff5helg,t1_ff55syr,1579592978.0,"I never knew this was a thing until I moved into a really old building in Memphis (I'm from europe otherwise). I wanted to open the window, and it wasn't happening. Called my husband, he's stronger, surely he'll open it. Not happening. I look at what might be blocking the mechanism and I notice the paint ""honey, I think they...painted over closed windows?"". My husband didn't believe me. But yes, yes they did. We took a knife and cut the paint (who knew you can put ""knife"", ""cut"" and ""paint"" in a sentence) all around, and voila! But surpriseeee, we think they also painted the windows from the outside, but that paint kind of broke apart when we opened them."
Dogtraining,fey6k8t,t1_fexqhmq,1579441374.0,"Agree. And some if these folks are actually crating their dogs SO MUCH, and justify it and brag with it by ""if I don't have time to deal with my dog, he is in a crate"". Granted, for this specific person I know, it's a job, and they spend a majority of time outside working and training, but while at home, does the dog *really* have to be in the crate if not eating. What harm does it do if a dog chills on the rug, or heaven forbid, cuddles with its human, while people watch tv instead of in a crate...

ETA: I just realised this is the complete opposite of what OP is about, sorry I brought it up, it was just on my mind a lot lately since a recent conversation I had. I just think in a trusty relationship there shouldn't be much need to ask for consent all the time from either side, and signs where someone is busy/not wanting should be equally recognizable by both parties. My dog doesn't bring me his toys to play with while I'm cooking, I don't try to pet him while he's eating kind of a deal, and we don't annoy eachother if one says/shows ""not right now""."
Dogtraining,fex7v3m,t3_eqrxtd,1579426449.0,"I read about this in a few groups, but I think the concept (or people who write about it) takes it a bit far. Imo, it depends mostly on the trust level between a person and dog, same as in interpersonal relationships  between people. I don't expect my husband to ask for consent or wait until I ask for a hug to hug me. And I trust him to stop if I imply or say I'm not up to it. Same with my dog, he's good with random pets, and be usually gets into it and gets closer or rolls over for a belly rub, if not he can trust me to not follow him if he moves away. And I'm the loudest advocate for never annoying the dog, ever. If it's not into it, sleeping, eating, or whatever, leave it alone. I'm also against the bribing behavior you mentioned the store employee do (give a treat to steal a cuddle). And against strangers petting a dog who doesn't ask for it. 

Saying that, things are a lot different with reactive dogs. The trust needed for random petting is often not there, since in my experience the reactivity starts when the dog doesn't think it can trust the owner to handle situations and protect it, so it handles the situations on its own (by barking, growling, etc). That kind of dog is on edge and on guard almost constantly, expecting things to go wrong, so of course it might react negatively to a surprising pet, or even a pet when it would rather focus on a potential danger situation (a potential danger in the eyes of a reactive dog can be a lot of things...). My dog was reactive, isn't really anymore (in 95÷, I actually haven't seen him really react in months), and now looks to me for directions on how to react to a perceived threat - if I'm relaxed with a dog passing by, he goes by. If another dog annoys him or looks threatening, he moves behind me. And he's also relaxed most of the time, so he's not busy listening to all the sounds or constantly eyeing the surroundings. But that trust took us almost a year. I think when the dog trusts its owner in all kind of situations, he also trusts the owner's affection. 

On the other hand, I've heard people go in the exact opposite direction too. And most people I heard saying this were dog owners who have working dogs. They say that a dog should never ask for a pet, or bring a toy to the owner, or beg for anything. Like, the owner decides if it's play time, or affection time, or eating time, or whatever. I'm just not that kind of person, and I wouldn't have that kind of relationship with my dog."

relationship_advice,fen6n9j,t3_epzone,1579278135.0,"I shared this with my husband who also gets a lot of spur of the moment passions. His advice is that you two have two options; one like everyone else says is to limit to 1 aquarium, and compromise to pay someone to take care of fish while vacationing. 

The other is to make it into a business. Your fiance is probably already pretty knowledgeable in this field, so he should find a way monetize it. Either breed expensive fish, sell setups, etc. This is what my husband has done with a few of his hobbies and some made a lot of money. We bought a boat and a car with money he made growing mushrooms. He also made a bit of money with homemade vape juices (he made stickers and branding for this too and had fun with design as well). And a few businesses with a smart heating system that people were able to turn on and off with their mobile phones (this was way before smartphones and the smarthouse systems we know today). He works his regular work and does passion hustles like these in his free time and every few years he gets into something new. Some are fails, but usually he's not losing money, and even if he does it's not a lot, so I don't mind."

multigrain mostly oats cereal (the healthy kind) without chocolate/raisins/dried fruit/sugar, add fresh or frozen blueberries or a not too ripe banana, full fat yogurt  


or  


1 fried egg, 1 piece of rye bread, half of a bell pepper or cucumber, piece of cheese  


\+Always coffee with milk  


Snack (one after breakfast, one after lunch):

Apple/pear, some aged gauda or some other good cheese, walnuts

or

Yogurt with some berries added

or

1 piece of rye bread, cream cheese/fish spread/mayo+cheese, some vegetable (like today I had a few radishes)

or

a bowl of green salad (no iceberg) with mozzarella, tomatoes, tuna, avocado, whatever I have, with lots of pumpkin oil and balsamic vinegar

or

red beets salad (they're supposed to be good for blood sugar levels, so I got a whole bunch)  


\---

Lunch is very varied, so I'll list the things I remember having in the past weeks:  
1 half of plate of baked veggies (these can be a mix of whatever I have - zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, gourd, asparagus, bell peppers, yams...), a quarter plate of carbs (full grain rice, full grain pasta, potatoes with skin...). these two are sometimes mixed into a risotto of some sorts. I also make this really fatty, so I add butter on my veggies, or cream sauce or a lot of olive oil. 1 or 2 pieces of baked/fried fish (usually hake,sea bass, trout, or salmon), or a bunch of fried sardines or other smaller fish.   


Since it's winter, which is sauerkraut season here - sauerkraut, cooked potatoes, veggie sausage. Or sauerkraut soup. Or sour turnip is also popular now.   


A risotto with very little black full grain rice, zucchini, and cuttlefish or octopus or squid, a lot of parmesan, a bowl of green salad. 

&#x200B;

Full grain pasta with smoked salmon and cream sauce, a lot of parmesan (this can't be more than half a plate, otherwise my sugar is too high after meal), a huge bowl of green salad.   


Full grain pasta with cream sauce, broccoli (honestly, it was mostly broccoli), mushrooms, and shrimps, and parmesan.

&#x200B;

Veggie soup with whatever veggies I have + some sweet or regular potatoes. 

&#x200B;

\+ I sometimes add a glass of red wine (this is not an american glass of wine, but a deciliter).

&#x200B;

\---

Another snack like before lunch, usually I add a fruit or two.

\---

Dinner:

1 or 2 pieces of rye bread + either home made sardine spread, or avocado spread, or cream cheese, or peanut butter. Or a sandvich with mayonnaise and some vegan peperoni or similar.  I started experimenting with other breads, and spelt bread works for me as well. I try to add some raw veggies, like a bit of sliced cucumber, or bell pepper. 

\---

Before bed:

yogurt, nuts for snacking in front of tv (pistachios, peanuts, walnuts, trail mix...)

  
\---

After lunch and dinner I usually walk my dog. If they are carbier, we go for a bit of a hike on a local hill, or I do some training with him that involves running. I found that this greatly improves my after meal sugar."

hamster,fdgfm91,t3_el9gqk,1578394570.0,"That's a common misconception! The size of the hamster actually doesn't play much role in how big the cage needs to be. And sadly, pet stores continue to sell these kind of cages :( don't feel to bad, when I had my first hamster long long ago, I had a very similar cage. I let my hamster freeroam and she went to her cage on her own, usually just to eat, sleep, and pee, otherwise she was roaming around the room. 

The cheapest solution is to DIY an enclosure out of a big plastic bin. Here is what I made:
http://imgur.com/a/funHCcN

Notice I used the top of the old cage as the uppermost level :) I driled a hole in the lid of the bin through which a hamster could get to the top, where the food was. And this is also where it came to ask for cuddles. If you're handy (or have anyone who is and can help) there are tons of possibilities with bin cages that allow you to make something a hamster will love. And it's very cheap. And allows you to start easy with just the bin and the one floor level and then add to that when you have time.


Edit: to find this photo searched my google photos for ""cage"" and I just noticed that on the photo there are two gerbils in the cage and not a hamster, haha. I fostered these two elderly gerbils when I was in between hamsters, but the cage was made specifically for a hamster and their needs. On the floor layer there was a lot more bedding than seen here, the middle layer has a built in sandbath (leveled with the level floor), and the top layer has edible straw. I'm not sure how appropriate the cage was for the gerbils, but the hamsters I had loved it."
reactivedogs,fdgeyz8,t3_el67yn,1578393671.0,"I skimmed through your post history - is this the rottie/lab mix or the smaller whitish dog? Since one can do much more damage than the other, my recommendation would be greatly different. 

When I was a child I had a few friends with dogs that behaved exactly how you described. I never got snapped at because I had experience with our own dogs, but I remember birthday parties at these kids' houses and other kids getting bitten. The kids that got bitten or snapped at were usually the ones who didn't know how to behave around dogs and would wave their hands around them, jump over them, etc. All while the dog was giving ample warning signs, but didn't move away from the kids because he wanted to be close to the owner kid. However, all the cases I know these were smaller dogs. They could break skin, sure, but a chihuahua or a maltese aren't capable of mauling anyone. So after an incident, kids usually got a lecture on how to behave around dogs, and the situation was manageable. I think with your kid being 7, any dog up to 15kg can be managed without panic, since 7 year olds are already sensible small people.

However, if this is about the bigger dog, then the situation could quickly get out of hand. With your own son, I think it's very possible to teach him to check the dog before picking stuff up, to explain warning signs, etc. And they would be able to live together and stay friends, but it really depends on your son, and his relationship with the dog, and if he wants it. Because to be fair, if this is about the bigger dog, then it really didn't want to hurt your kid, just give a warning, since it could easily bite his hand off if he wanted to do so. And I know bruises sound bad, but even a super friendly dog is going to bruise a child (or me, since I bruise easily) if they play together - I understand this case wasn't play at all, just saying it's not that the dog was super rough to leave one. 
BUT - if you're often visited by other kids, this dog could cause something tragic. 

So my advice is to try to manage the environment until you manage to rehome him. So, no visits, no letting the dog run with kids, etc.

Besides the shelter - since I can feel the sadness in your post - would the dog do good with any family members or friends who might want to take him? This way you would still be able to visit and see him."

I really don't like dog parks since even if my dog is now pretty fine with other dogs, there are still people who bring their aggresive dogs there. If you can find one where not a lot of people go, and go at a weird time, so that you're alone, that might be an option. 

Another option is to just go a few times to get a hang of the basics, then apply these principles on your regular walks. You can even choose gradually increasing stress situations. Like start walking wherr there's no people, then go somewhere where you'll see some other dogs but have an opportunity to keep distance (a big park or a nature reserve), then go to a busier park, etc. This might be cultural, but around here I've met and made friends on walks with plenty of people who were also walking their dog. You might meet someone with equally frightened dog :)

Or maybe post on your local facebook group (depending on the size of your city, there might be one for dog lovers) to see if anyone would walk with you but not to close. Don't be ashamed, plenty of people have frightened and reactive dogs."

reactivedogs,fddmptc,t1_fddjgkn,1578317988.0,"Doing this regularly sounds perfect for getting over fear, since the leader will assure none of the dogs approach. And since you're in a group with other walkers, random people with their dogs won't come pester you two and possibly send your dog over threshold. It's like very gentle exposure therapy, and your dog will become less fearful the more you'll walk him around dogs in a safe environment. Since he already stopped lunging and barking, it sounds like you two are doing great work.

I suggest bringing two or three levels of treats with you. Like 1. regular food, when he stops being interested in that switch to 2. training treats, when he stops being interested in that as well, switch to 3. lunch meat/cheese/hotdogs/whatever is super valuable to your pup.

Keep in mind that in time, when your dog gets over fear, he might replace the fear with frustration and will start pulling/lunging towards dogs to get a better sniff or to play. When that happens it's super important you have the super high value treats to keep his focus on you. Because maybe right now his fear is keeping him from jumping on every dog and playing with it (or trying to dominate it). When fear is over you'll have to teach him to keep by your side and not play until released to play because it's the ""good"" thing to do (and not just because he's afraid). Doing structured walks like this is good for this too.  


edit: Obviously, this depends on your location, but I also think $15 to walk your dog on your own in a group is a lot. So maybe, do a few of these, asking as much questions to the trainer/leader as possible, then try to get friends who have dogs and would be willing to walk them like this together. Just a thought. But, if you can afford the $15, then go for it for sure, it sounds awesome, and I wish they offered something like this where I am."

If you keep doing this - going to walks where dogs don't interact and he's under threshold, your dog will eventually figure out that it is fine, and nothing bad happens when he's near a dog, and will relax. After that happens, then you maybe slowly allow him to quickly sniff another dog, and move away, and continue the walk the same way. Repeat as many times as needed (not on the same day), until he's completely relaxed when greeting another dog. Then just keep repeating and maybe allowing more interaction. 

If you have a reactive dog, it's utopic and possibly dangerous to expect socialization in way that all dogs will play with eachother on the first walk. 

&#x200B;

The people who muzzled their dog sound like responsible owners. If you don't know how your dog will react to a dog that approaches, and you're not 100% that you can keep dogs from approaching, muzzling your dog as well might be a great option. Especially if it's a big dog that has shown potential to bite with little or no provocation and you're visiting an area where people let their zero recall dogs off leash. Of course some dogs approach in a completely friendly manner, but if your dog is severely reactive to all dogs, it's always smart to muzzle.  


One suggestion I have is to not feed your dog before the walk, if it's in the morning, and your dog is an adult, you can also skip the meal on the evening before, so that your dog is hungry. Then bring a mix of his regular food and higher value treats so that your dog is focused on you during the walk."

HomeImprovement,fd85fqu,t1_fd766ft,1578214077.0,The other option might be calling the manufacturer of the pump (the inside unit) to see if they offer help with setting up. Ours has a 24h support number.
HomeImprovement,fd5xpvv,t3_ejymtv,1578182824.0,"Is this on a heat pump? If yes, I can share our experience, since living with it for the last year woth nothing but good things to say. We have a heat pump with radiant floor (water pipes under the floor), and it truly doesn't need much electricity if it's constantly running. If it's turning on and off it can get pretty expensive (we had that experience when we were doing some electrical work and we needed to turn it off for a day, then it worked for a day, then the electrician came again and it got turned off again the third day and back on the fourth). 
We have an option of using an outside temperature curve, which means the colder it is outside the harder the pump works (and the warmer it is in the house), and this also dictates at what temperature it turns on/off. We had to tweak it a bit when we had a few unusually warm days during the winter, so it didn't turn off (because we knew the warm days will be followed by freezing temperatures). The other option is having a thermostat in the house and having the pump regulate by that - according to our technicians this is usually less energy efficient, so we didn't go that route.
Do you know which setting you're using and have you tried tweaking it?

We were told to only mess with the pipe valves for rooms if we want to turn a room completely off. This might be different in your case, but it was the advice we got.

Carpet is not great. Concrete is super, then ceramic/clay tile, then vinyl, then laminate, then 2 layer (thin) hardwood. Regular hardwood, cork, carpet won't get the room warm enough, so they aren't advised. The fluffier the carpet the worse the heating. Large fluffy area rugs were also advised against, though we have one in our living room and it's still hot there.

The barking is the only thing needing work, but I would start by just advocating and not having strangers approach.

He did use to bark sometimes if someone was persistently looming over him, but I just give him enough room to move away and he always chooses that first.

So, my suggestion is try to be as rational as possible, be confident in your strengths and aware of your weaknesses, and trust your partner. Also, think about who else you're able to lean on. Any parents, in laws, relatives, who would be willing to take the kid for a couple of days and give you some time to recuperate?

I suggest having at least some of your days off for yourself and have your husband take the kids. Does your husband ever take children to the park and lets you sleep? Why doesn't he ever cook? Who does everything else?"

While her husband jacks off and does jack shit for the family and marriage. Her insecurities are the least of this marriage's problems."

It really messes with you. BUT, it will pass. Now at week 14 I get nauseous for maybe 5 minutes every 3 days, it's heaven. 

What helped me a bit (I think, I could be imagining) was switching my prenatals from ones containing iron and zinc to ones with just folic acid and vitamins B."

Dogtraining,fcf2r2f,t3_eh3qd9,1577626077.0,"I don't usually allow dogs to play inside, so when they start, I clap twice and say ""that's enough"" and they calm down or like lay on the floor and gently paw at eachother. Outside I allow them to go full speed ahead and only stop them if they start being too rough (there's a size difference and the small one used to scratch the big one when he still had the sharky baby teeth).  Then I let them play again. This way they know that getting rough and tumbling around too much will get them stopped and chasing eachother and easy wrestling will allow them to play. But to do that you first have to teach ""stop play"" command at home, where you can ideally separate if needed."

I am not sure if I ever tried using it on my dog (I think I used lavander cream on his paws once), but since I use it a lot for scratches and pimples and other potentially inflamed skin stuff, I'll be much more careful to not ever use it on a dog or around it."
