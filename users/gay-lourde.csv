TrueChristian,fei0ahv,t3_eotnu3,1579127503.0,"yall should seek couples therapy; one for the relationship (emotional) as well as a sex therapist if the two of you truly want to make things better. 

and if you dont want to keep moving forward, keep separation open as an option, if you‚Äôve truly given up (either you or your husband if not both of you). your happiness is first and foremost. you deserve love and peace of mind.

best of luck moving forward. üå∏"

offmychest,fcw9kue,t3_ef9n6r,1578020288.0,"idk man. i think maybe shes just having a real hard time right now. when you have a mental illness, being in a relationship doesnt cure it, even when you love the person. if this is too much for your mental health, youre not obligated to stay. if you want to tough this out you have to know it will be really hard sometimes. i think the best thing you can do is be there for her, and to just allow her to be imperfect, because im sure shes trying real hard. if she says she loves you it means a lot because it is hard to care about anything when youre in a dark place like that.

all the best dude\~"
