And I think I have to disagree a bit here. Balance is important, but we should not be tipping the scale with good vs bad perse, we should be aiming for a good direction and balancing by different options to get there. 

As Lincoln said, a house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe we should not be divided on the fundamentals, but rather the implementation.

Did I say fish? I meant fiat. 

Euros? Yuan? Yen? Francs?

You keep saying it's going to happen. How is it going to happen? To replace the dollar, the alternative currency has to be backed by a massive economy, universally used, and has a reliable history. 

The euro is beholden to the European banks and subsidizing government bailouts. The yuan is constantly manipulated to keep China's exports afloat, and similar to the yen both economies aren't open to the outside world. The rest of the rich and stable countries' currency out together don't even make a dent in current need."

WritingPrompts,fduo9x4,t3_emx8se,1578736185.0,"Patty was lying on the bed, eyes open, wide awake. It must have come true, the ""Deal"" with the mysterious voice. She thought it was a peculiar dream, but there she was, back in the old bed room of her house, with its faded green algae wallpaper. After all, Patty had been living here for years when she bought it in 1980 with her husband Robert. 

They have been in love on and off since 8th grade. Robert ran away when Patty entered high school. Her strict family kept her on the road to become a lawyer when they met again while she was in college and he was working odd jobs, including gardening outside her dorm. He convinced her to live her life to the fullest, and Patty dropped out and became a dancer. They married in 1976, with nothing to their name but disgraceful gossip on the lips of neighbors and relatives alike. Patty was fixing clothes and teaching dance lessons at the community rec center while Robert worked days and studied nights until he became a civil engineer. The streets he once cleaned and the flowers he once planted, were now his to design. Their life was perfect and 34 years of marriage passed, as calm and blissful as the gentle waves of the Pacific as they caressed the morning shores in Santa Barbara where Patty and Robert lived.

Until that fateful day. Yes, the Deal was real. It is all coming back to her now. Abba's Happy New Year was on the radio. It really was a timeless masterpiece, a terrific personal favorite of Patty. She was brewing some tea. It was raining outside, and Robert was coming home soon. He found her lying on the kitchen floor, pieces of the tea pot and dried leaves everywhere. 2 weeks later, the doctors at Huerta Memorial diagnosed her with early onset Alzheimer's and vascular dementia; all from just a stroke. Patty was 56. Robert was 58. 

Everything really was coming back to Patty. Not just her memories, but her senses. It immediately came to light that everyone took the Deal on New Years 2020. Financial markets, diplomats, politicians, reporters and even the doctors and nurses were in heated discussion about it. Lying in her sick bed, Patty could hear them clearly. Then the noise got louder and suddenly blissful silence was returned after the gentle sound of the door closing. Robert slowly lifted the curtains, and smiled at Patty. 

""Good morning petunia"" he said. As sweet as the thousands of times Patty has heard it before. 

Apparently Patty's dementia was rapid for only the first 3 years, then slowed down for the last 7. And obviously, the Deal did not fix her. But magically, as if a mysterious voice that grants universal time-travel was not magic enough, Patty's bits and pieces of memories were stitched together against the back drop of severe mental deterioration. 

Patty remembered the crushing news. The doctors telling her not to worry. The panels of doctors baffled by her fast worsening, and again when she slowed. The silent, lonely tears every night, and Robert's greyed head resting at her side. The harder and weaker walks, and Robert's skinny, almost shriveled up hand firmly holding hers, his other hand at her back. Patty would imagine the bright and splendid hall where they danced, hand in hand, on their wedding day, and Robert would assure her of a certain, imminent return trip. Eventually, she grew too frail to walk. Her sharp wit softly dulled, until one day it was no longer with her. Then Patty forgot that day too. 

Patty remembered the funny man who would always bring her fresh flowers in the morning. He'd stop by to tell her funny jokes while she ate lunch, and then at night the man would hold her hand and tell her about his day, the friends he met and the things he did, as she slowly drifted to sleep. 

Patty can remember the funny man's face now. It was Robert. And then slowly, the man became stranger. Maybe it was her cousin. Maybe it was Jeffrey from 3rd grade. Until finally, the funny man became just a daily stranger. But now, in 2010, Patty can see it clearly. 

The Deal did not fix her, and could not fix her now. All it did was giving her precious time to change what should not have been. 

Her morning flowers should have never been wilted. The lunch stories should have never been told. And the bedside dreams. And the dances. The walks. The reassuring smiles, the forever promise.

Patty remembered it as plainly as day. 

The funny man stopped dropping by around a year before the Deal. 

Patty is sure Robert had the same Deal too. He must have known by now.

AdviceAnimals,fd4kl19,t1_fd4f2db,1578168403.0,"You as an employer pay waiters a minimum wage, because you need the waiters but you value their work the least and thus you pay them the lowest amount possible, as required by law.

What I mean by good service is when waiters are better than just taking your orders, bringing you, the customer, food and the receipt. When you actually enjoyed their service and feel like they deserve a little something more, beyond the minimum that is required of them. So you tip."
AdviceAnimals,fd4j7y6,t1_fd49si1,1578167973.0,"That's exactly what I was saying. Pay a living wage, and let tips be tips, a reward again. 

A living wage is solely the responsibility of the employer to the employee. Customer tips shouldn't be taken into account at all. Any amount of tipping is kept the same, entirely up to the customer, w/o the BS concern on whether you're ""ripping off"" your waiter. Do people really have to be forced to tip or else your waiter starves?

I don't see how this is a slippery slope at all. The restaurant employers are playing both sides, their waiters and their customers. They're setting the basic wage very low and publicizing this to customers, so that any one who eats has to deal with the social responsibility and possible stigma of tipping/i.e. paying their waiter. Waiters who don't get tips are mad at the customers, instead of the pre-stolen low wage. 

Even in places where restaurants pay their waiters to a minimum wage amount if the tips don't cover it: why? 

Let's say minimum wage is $10/hr. Your basic wage is at $4/hr. That means if you earned only $5, they'll chip in $5 and you'll always earn $10, true. But the way I see it, you're getting money stolen from you. You have to work hard, in fact $7 harder than your basic wage, in order to just start earning that next extra dollar. You have to work hard enough that's worth a 150% higher rate than your base wage, in order to start making a 25% raise, all on your own effort. Why? Why can restaurants take your tips to pat their own bottom line (your wage)? 

The way I see it, that's theft. That's no different from the DoorDash scandal. In fact it's more egregious and outrageous. Imagine if DD lashed out at both customers and drivers and said ""if you guys wanted more pay, the customers should have tipped your drivers more and the drivers should have driven more. Because we only promised our driver that minimum amount by law, the laws don't mention tips so we can and will take their tips.""

P/s: IMHO if you implemented the split service style, for fancy restaurants with tons of utensils and multi course dishes, this simply can't work. But I think for many good but sit down places with plenty of space where the food isn't fancy, it can work pretty well. A lot of people just want the food, and if there's an option similar to take out but you can still sit there and enjoy the atmosphere, that'd be great!"

Plus, the Prius is at its heart, a convenient econobox. Tesla doesn't make econonoxes. The environmental-conscious but richer crowd will pick up a Tesla and trading in their Prius no problem, but the poor ones won't.

The same reason Tesla has had success where others haven't, is their battery production capacity. If Toyota sorts that out, then they have no shortage of ways and talent to market a new EV make.

I don't see how Tesla can dominate the market with an EV econobox faster than Toyota can."

That said, the Surface is the superior productivity device of all 3. The S6 is a polished but limited productivity experience. The Slate is IMHO the poorest, unless all of your productivity lies inside Chrome browser.

If you're getting similar prices for a Surface Pro, go for that, not the Pixel Slate. If you need to do good note taking and doodling, and the Tab S6 is the same price, get the Tab S6.

Pen support for the Slate is very weak. I like the feel of the pen but the software just isn't there. After all these years, you're really still only getting a glorified web browser and half an Android tablet. 

If all you want is movies and web browsing, maybe play some [Android] games, then you'd want the Slate. Bigger screen than the S6, and cheaper and sleeker than the Surface. I personally wouldn't recommend anything higher than an m3, because for the premium you might as well get a Surface."
