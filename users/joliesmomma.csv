So when people say they are legally blind, I imagine someone like him more than someone who is blind with no visual sight at all. And I imagine someone who used to be able to see and has lost their vision at some point in their life. 

So I ask, did you grow into your legal blindness? I'm just wondering how you know what the colors neon orange and purple look like? So I'm assuming you weren't born fully blind."

AskReddit,fdnejt5,t1_fdn7568,1578584122.0,"Yes. I am reasonable and relaxed. I grew up in a house where it was my dad's way or the highway.  I'm 32 now with a 13 year old and own my own house and everything and my dad STILL tried to tell me how I'm doing things wrong as a parent by not being strict with my daughter. I was grateful for my parents for feeding us and clothing us and for my dad working a thousand jobs because my mom didn't want to get a job. But, I didn't go out and do anything with friends which meant I didn't really have friends. I wasn't allowed to get in trouble and learn from mistakes. It led to me sneaking out all the time and then eventually getting pregnant at 17. Even after telling my mom that I had been having sex when I was 16, she didn't try to make sure I was being safe or put me on birth control or anything. Sex was not a topic we discussed. So when my daughter started getting older, I talked to her about everything. About boys and what happens when you aren't safe with sex. She kept telling me I don't have anything to worry about. My husband and I used to joke with her and ask if she has a boyfriend, she'd always say no. Then, one day I jokingly asked if she had a girlfriend. She didn't answer right away because she thought I'd be mad. That's how I found out my daughter is gay. And I told her that was okay, as long as when she's older, she loves the person who she's with and the person she is when she's with someone. I tried explaining that to my dad and he told me I was teaching her that it's okay to be gay and I need to teach her the right way to be. That passed me off even more."

I can be clumsy at times and cut myself often but I never really think about the fact that I might need a tetanus shot. 

On another note, if you took what I said to someone else as rude about you being lucky to be paraplegic, I just meant in this instance so you didn't feel the pain of it. I was just trying to look on the bright side of things since it's not like you can change your paraplegia. If I'm just digging the hole deeper and you're actually really mad at me, sorry about that too."

So I said I was doing a mermaid theme thing and so we're doing turquoise and purple. My baby shower was today and EVERYTHING I got from my husband's side of the family was pink....... Everything. I am not one to complain because that means o don't have to buy those things, so I will keep them. But I know that is they knew me, they would've gotten other colors. So, just so you don't find out in 15 years that your sister in law hates the colour pink (if she does) maybe ask her what colors she was thinking of doing in the baby's room."

Joke's on me though, I got pregnant the following year and now have a 13 year old. Ended up having a c section though. Then I realized that wasn't the only reason I didn't want children.
