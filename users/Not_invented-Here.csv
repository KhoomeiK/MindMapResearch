Java fern is hard to kill.

Myriophyllum grows pretty well but likes light, if planted the lower stems may go brown because of this, if left floating it grows well. I always have it die off planted but floating it does fine.

Monte carlo is supposed to be an easy carpeting plant, but have never tried it.

Pelia seems to grow alright in fact it seems tough to kill.

solotravel,ffepk0p,t3_et21so,1579859027.0,"I have had Thai's tell me not to tip too much as that can be almost a loss of face for the person getting the tip, as in I am being flashy and showing off how much I can tip.
In Vietnam some places don't expect tips and will get really confused and even chase you down the street trying to hand it back.

In general I try and tip a reasonable percentage or keep the change in some places, but lean way towards the more generous side. I live in Vietnam but I earn western wages and  so in comparison I earn way more than many here, it feels a bit bad to tip the equivalent of nothing back home, so something like a food delivery they will just get the change, sometimes it works out well sometimes not it all balances out in the long run most likely to their favour.

I have tipped a fair bit extra if I feel the service has gone above and beyond though. I once was in a hotel in Vietnam and had really bad food poisoning, the amount of care and concern I got and the cleaners being totally lovely after seeing the disaster of a bathroom, I did give the about a weeks wages each for the cleaners apparently (and they deserved it)."

I have friends from all over the world here, but there is a lot unpacked content wise when you are talking to people from your culture it's a far more relaxing chat. I have to be careful speaking to people from different countries, slow my words, mind my accent, not assume that something I thought was obvious isn't (because we English can be very roundabout in how we say something). It's harder work at times. 

My other half is native and speaks excellent English, but she gets tired if she is in a room of English people because the nuance is a lot harder to read when we are all naturally talking as if we were back in the UK, your having that fight probably using non native language.

There is nothing wrong every now and again getting yourself a slice of home culture while abroad if you need it. It's like as good as Japanese food is, I bet you occasionally eat something more closer to home and don't feel you are betraying your efforts to assimilate.

I like where I live, and the area I live in has many expats along with the locals and English being the lingua franca it's easy to speak English my native tongue here, but sometimes it's still better for me to talk to people from England because we have a shared culture and cultural mindset the difference can be subtle but make all the difference when speaking, I couldn't for example do the usual English dry insult/comment with a lot of people not from the UK I have to moderate my language to not accidentaly offend."

It shows a difference that is quite shocking I was telling people I was off for a month and my employer had given me some extra money to spend on my hols, these guys were working themselves to death in fear of losing their livelihood.


We do do long shifts over here I have done shifts like that (in fact doing something like it now for next 3 or so weeks), but day to day unless there is a crunch on its IMO bad use of people burning out staff doesn't make them more productive (generally no one is much use at the end of a 60hr week and at the end of multiple ones even worse). I have had a few employers now come in on a Friday and say why the hell is your computer running at past 5pm please we aren't that busy today go to the pub. In fact quite a lot of employers I have worked for would be questioning why you are not using your holiday time as not to get a break from work is unhealthy.

There is quite a focus on wellness and mental health in UK employment laws.

For working a lot before you leave that happens here, but we always have handovers as well a doc that says hey this is where this is at, its your responsibility till I come back. I have never had a big holiday mid project its too much stuff to handover. Catching up when you are back happens here as well, it's just part of it first few days are a nightmare between that and getting back in the swing of things (i.e getting up in the morning and going to work), but it's doable, I haven't often been expected to be fully on the ball first day back, I don't think anyone expects that.

In all honesty the economic difference gives me spending power and that’s not a bad thing, I can live well, eat well and also save, back in the UK it was work to stay afloat. I actually quite like SEA in general TBH, lots of wildlife and diving that is far more accessible than back home, people generally are great real strong communities and when out and about out of the neighbourhood people generally aren’t trying to rip me off they are more likely to try and help etc (tourist areas excepted), and there is something about living in another country just a sort of exoticism to it if that makes sense (especially with such a different culture from Western European) – even if living a lot of time in the expat bubble. It’s interesting and keeps my attention.
 
My plans are to stay in SEA as this is where work and opportunities are for me. Plan B I will move to another country here.

Do I want to stay in Vietnam? That’s a tricky one there is a lot going for living here and I love the country but you have some downsides, corrupt government (well I believe most politicians are to some degree), but its really endemic here at all levels and if people at clerk and police levels are out touting for bribes that's not a good thing, it just makes stuff so hard to do business wise, and speaking of government things a lack of opacity in what is needed (and often changing rules) just makes some things a slog that shouldn’t be.  There’s also a somewhat half assed / make do attitude in a lot of things done here in general that just is a bit annoying, food safety sucks I am more wary of street food here than in Thailand. 

Probably the biggest issue though is pollution, I want to have kids and there is very strong evidence that bringing up kids in a area as polluted as Hanoi would be detrimental, hell I don’t like it I come from a area with very clean air and living here I have so many just minor nose and throat infections it sucks, likewise waterways and so on being so polluted. The other thing is education probably, not a teacher but from things I have heard discussed and also from talking to Vietnamese  in business who have been educated abroad it seems there is a certain lack /difference in education here with it focused way more on rote learning, I think I would rather have my kids go to a university somewhere that teaches in a more western style for their degree vs Vietnam."
