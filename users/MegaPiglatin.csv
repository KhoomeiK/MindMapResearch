AskReddit,ff8sdtr,t1_ff8javf,1579694238.0,"I read that as ""testicles in my eyes"" which still fits the description."
AskReddit,ff8sah6,t1_ff8ltfr,1579694129.0,Were you attempting to go insane?
AskReddit,ff8s7kr,t3_es8mab,1579694034.0,Someone rubbing their feet on carpet. Or really just feet being near me at all. Eww.
AskReddit,ff8rtn4,t3_ery2k3,1579693572.0,"A very specific acacia tree in the front yard!

Both my brother and I practically lived in that tree, and both of us were suuuper allergic to its pollen in spring. But the other tree was too difficult and painful to climb.

Also the roof of house when I was about 12/13. Except one time my sister and I got stuck up there because the ladder fell over or like my brother moved it on accident or something. We weren't supposed to be up there but....that didn't really stop our antics."

AskReddit,ff8r8s4,t1_ff8empw,1579692838.0,"Holy shit or just posting selfies of you doing average, everyday things to a Snapchat friends group every fucking day without anyone asking for it or wanting it.

Though that creates a great opportunity to troll the selfie-taker, so that can be enjoyable sometimes in a semi-mean way."
AskReddit,ff8r27b,t1_ff7zscg,1579692608.0,Eyyy and this is why the one friend I have known the longest and I never became super close.
AskReddit,ff8qthz,t1_ff8bwti,1579692290.0,Oh my goodness I think this may have some truth in regards to someone I know. I've been trying to put my finger on it for a while now but maybe that's a clue....hmm....
AskReddit,ff8qldt,t1_ff8kjoy,1579691987.0,Then you would automatically no longer be boring!
AskReddit,ff8qhve,t3_es53p0,1579691851.0,"When they only want to talk about the same 5 things every time you see them and they are only into a very narrow window of BDSM.

This isn't from personal experience or anything............../s  -_-"

AskReddit,fegfmaw,t1_fef9att,1579091129.0,"Oh man I remember trying to invent this when I was a kid!

That and solar powered cars. I also lived in AZ though so solar powered anything made the most sense to me.   :p"
pics,fegf4oi,t1_fegd57g,1579090633.0,"After reading through his recent post history, I'm starting to think it's more of the wanting to connect side of it. He is young and apparently this all happened in the span of about 3 months....plus photos were mentioned in a previous post (not this exact one but....photos nonetheless). I'm thinking this might be his way of connecting to a community in the modern day."
tifu,fe5nbei,t1_fe4jzt5,1578871699.0,Haha yeah sometimes I just willingly sleep on the couch because it's more comfortable or I'm feeling too crowded by my boyfriend in the bed.
TwoXChromosomes,fdv5pqx,t3_emzkfo,1578743531.0,"Yeah, responses to me not wanting to have children really grind my gears. I don't want children because I get no joy from spending time with children--well-behaved or not (the stress level is just to the moon if they are not particularly well-behaved)--ever. My maternal instinct for children goes as far as wanting them to have the best future and training to be a productive adult. My compassion is almost entirely centered around caring for animals instead. In some respects I think I could nail parenting, but I would be a terrible parent. No use in making everyone suffer, right?"
TwoXChromosomes,fdv30v9,t1_fdtrn5m,1578742625.0,Shoot I don't have the time/energy/interest in that on a good day!
TwoXChromosomes,fdv1h83,t1_fduiztx,1578742039.0,Right? As if the worst thing in the world is someone regretting their decision?

AskReddit,fdmw0ou,t1_fdmf3p2,1578568420.0,"See, this is one of those rules where I'm not sure if I just think it's gross/dirty on my own or if it was a rule enforced growing up, but I do that to this day. It's not a super strict rule to the point that there are consequences for wearing shoes, but it is a well-established habit with myself and my partner. Shoes have their place and you don't walk around the house in your shoes!

However, ""no shoes on the furniture"" was definitely a rule in my house growing up and I still agree with it. Who wants dirty ass shoes on the furniture!?"
AskReddit,fdmvkdp,t1_fdm83t5,1578567831.0,"Yup, same. And definitely no yelling ""help"" while playing for the same reason."
TwoXChromosomes,fdm7n6q,t1_fdkyqlm,1578541802.0,I second this! I highly recommend PP to anyone unsure of options or uncomfortable with their existing doctor. I have gone to PP over several years and various states and in that time I only came across 1 gynecologist that I didn't like and that's only because she had terrible bedside manner. But even within that office the other staff were great!
aww,fdlskl0,t1_fdlhxek,1578531494.0,They do!
nottheonion,fddebzx,t1_fdd7uvv,1578308326.0,"This reminds me of when my boyfriend and I moved into our current house....and the mere presence of my cat started the multi-month battle against the fleas. We didn't actually end up moving everything into the house until probably 4 or 6 months after we moved in and we slept in the middle of the tile floor in the living room because our carpeted bedroom was ground zero.

They have since been controlled and the poor cat has monthly flea treatments!"
aww,fd5jeh2,t1_fd2txuz,1578178246.0,Hahahaha I can toootally see my cat doing this same thing!

funny,fcu5bas,t1_fcti6ur,1577972913.0,Now I wonder if my childhood ferret had adrenal issues....
LifeProTips,fcshb2f,t3_eilqnx,1577916547.0,"I know for me personally, having someone just honestly listen to me AND engage in conversation around the topic (with me leading) was the most helpful when I was grieving.

The least helpful? Staying silent or complaining about little daily nuisances in their own life. The people who said I could call showed they cared but....I don't think I ever called any of them. It seemed too bothersome or like too much awkward effort."
