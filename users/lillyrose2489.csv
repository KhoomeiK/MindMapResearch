SkincareAddiction,ff7lmm7,t1_ff7ast8,1579652486.0,I tried it ages ago and did like it. I remember it absorbed fast and felt very light! Perhaps I will give it another go if I find myself needed a bit more moisture! Thanks for the reminder.
SkincareAddiction,ff7ag0a,t3_erxdy6,1579644606.0,"I'm working on the same thing! I just cut back to a very similar routine, which I'm going to stick to for minimum one month so I can re-assess if I need more, such as either another product to control breakouts/blackheads or a stronger moisturizer. My skin is quite dry right now because I cut back to just an oil free moisturizer, not a heavier cream, as I wait and see if perhaps the heavier cream is what was giving me some of those breakouts to begin with... it might not be the case but since I'm acne-prone I figured I should experiment for a bit and make sure I'm not overdoing it! 

I'm happy you have gotten yourself down to such a simple routine and am hoping I'll be there with you soon!"
AskReddit,ff72cvx,t1_ff68c9p,1579639728.0,Good idea! I have an automatic feeder that is fairly loud. They both wake up immediately and run towards it when it goes off now. Pretty sure i could put it outside now and they'd come running towards it if needed.
AskReddit,ff729s5,t1_ff6a7hp,1579639680.0,"It makes sense. Nudity is only startling when you aren't used to seeing it / aren't expecting it. First responders have seen some shit. I assume anyone in a medical field gets to be the same way? I might feel weird showing my doctor a weird spot in an awkward area on my body, but my doctor does NOT give a shit."
news,ff4jlcb,t1_ff374yb,1579565187.0,Why is it relevant that Sanders is a multimillionaire?
AskWomen,ff3x5e8,t1_ff3f7li,1579550785.0,I love how they droop when thirsty. Mine only died because my office gets too much direct sunlight so it got burnt and struggled after that. Best for shady / indirect light I think. I miss that plant!
AskWomen,ff3x31h,t1_ff3qmqq,1579550745.0,"All lilies are, I think. Pretty sure it's the leaves as well! I kept mine at work for years (since my cats would definitely try to eat it at home), it eventually died from getting too much sun (and I waited too long to re-pot) but it was otherwise an awesome office plant."
AskWomen,ff3wwvl,t1_ff3aonh,1579550634.0,"I think it's better to under-water a succulent I think. I have a jade plant that has been with me for years. Sometimes the leaves get a little wrinkled up because I have neglected it a bit too long, but they plump up again when I give it attention (as long as I don't forget it for too long, it'll survive). If you water too much, I think the roots start to rot, which is a harder problem to come back from. I killed an aloe vera plant with too much water so always try to go the other direction now!"
cats,ff22o40,t3_eqzs3x,1579492156.0,"Hey I have the same rug! It's a great rug, and you're a great pet owner."
AskWomen,fez6j3d,t1_few8y4u,1579454305.0,"Music venues have the most, followed by busy dive bars I'd say. Otherwise yeah it's not super common."
Fantasy,fesyxf4,t1_fermcdh,1579370300.0,I honestly am surprised how many people still care about the next Kingkiller book. I can't even remember what happened in book 2 because it wasn't that interesting to me. Book 1 was solid but it ended there imo.
Fantasy,fesygvr,t1_fer8g7j,1579370148.0,"I agree that overall Sanderson can have cheesy dialogue particularly when the characters are romantically involved. He also fails hard at times when a character is supposed to be funny, it is sometimes just really cringey. I otherwise loved that series and a lot of his other stuff but totally get why that would be a turnoff!"
Fantasy,fesxjj5,t1_fesloff,1579369946.0,Stormlight and the first 3 Mistborn are my favorites for sure. Skyward was surprisingly good as well!
Fantasy,feswhaa,t1_ferk1nf,1579369690.0,This is so true and my advice to others now as well. I went on for too long and it was not worth it.
Fantasy,fesw7u2,t1_fer862c,1579369651.0,"Also for me, the first book of Kingkiller was solid but the second was just okay. I'm over it, can't say I care that much how it ends anymore since I found the second book not very memorable anyway."
Fantasy,fesw1j3,t1_feq6ejq,1579369604.0,The good moments are SO GOOD but it was way too long and involved as a series. Needed a better editor. Sadly his wife was his editor and I think she was just too close to the story to help him cut stuff out when he needed to.
Fantasy,fesvuof,t1_fermcr3,1579369549.0,"I do not think I can recommend the series to anyone since almost half of it was so slow. I finished but it took ages, and I'm a fast reader! I ultimately was satisfied but just can't make any of my friends dedicate so much time to this series. I'm hoping the show is awesome so people can get to know the story in a lot less time."
Fantasy,fesvmgo,t1_fesn8v5,1579369476.0,"This is a funny post to me because I love Sanderson except hated the Reckoners. Clearly we just have different taste so no disrespect! I may not have finished WOT if Jordan had done the whole series because I found his writing really frustrating at times, even if I liked the overall story a lot."
Fantasy,fesvdbq,t1_fernsll,1579369390.0,Honestly it sounds like season one covers multiple books which I'm pumped about. Should greatly improve the pace!
news,fest3ke,t3_eqet1x,1579368758.0,I feel like it should not be on the teachers to sue here. Shouldn't the government go after Delta? Was this not illegal?
brandonsanderson,fei6hec,t1_fei4jer,1579131352.0,Tbh I might just wait until the sequel is out then go back and read both in a row like I did with Skyward!
ChoosingBeggars,fehx5a1,t1_feh9pnj,1579125621.0,Like it's fine if you aren't someone who wants to spend your money on art. That's valid. We all have different things we like to save up for. But if that's how you feel.. don't ask someone for art then tell them art isn't worth anything! So unbelievably rude.
ChoosingBeggars,fehx0y3,t1_feh2x1a,1579125553.0,"I'm sorry this happened, and honestly, if you think it would be stressful to take them to small claims court then don't. You have every right but don't add stress to your life when it's not necessary. If you'd rather just move on and heal, do that. 

It sucks when a friend either change or suddenly reveals the asshole they always were deep down. I can't say which thing this was, but it happens. I'm sorry it happened to you but just know that this person is not worthy of your time or effort anyway. She can have her terrible husband, that's clearly the choice she is making here."
SkincareAddiction,fehtlif,t1_fefv41d,1579123611.0,"I got the most success by cutting back to something super basic for a while then slowly adding things in one at a time to see if they helped with my remaining issues. Being very patient is hard but ultimately will help you! If you use too many things at once, it's hard to know what is helping vs. hurting!"
AmItheAsshole,fehszzo,t3_ep1uwm,1579123274.0,"NAH. It's always optional to say yes, but especially when it's a destination wedding. She does not have to pay for anything her bridesmaids buy BUT also should not be mad at you if you back out (if she does then I change my answer to NTA because it's absurd to expect everyone to come when you do a destination wedding)."
Damnthatsinteresting,fefnjib,t3_eoqzep,1579060218.0,"Shut up and take my money! 

But really I will happily buy one of these babies when you're ready to sell em. Love it."
AskWomen,feekamf,t3_eoo2m8,1579035471.0,"Working from home on occasion. Not often, but in my department, we can get away with it if we don't abuse it. Like if you need to be there for some delivery or the plumber is coming over, my boss is flexible about it even though the company policy doesn't allow it. I do it a few times per year, max."
AmItheAsshole,feaubcn,t1_fe96lx1,1578952216.0,"My thought exactly. If this was Target or something I would probably hold firm, but a local boutique? Messing up a sale could really hurt some small stores."
AmItheAsshole,fdrulet,t1_fdqn4cn,1578690001.0,"I mean, of course he ""had every right"" to ask for one, but didn't she also have every right to find that offensive and not want to be with someone who would think they needed one? If anything this sounds more like NAH should be the argument."
television,fdhxpzg,t1_fdhbq25,1578432062.0,"IMO if this show doesn't hook you after a few episodes, it's just not your jam. It does get better but remains the same kind of show throughout. It gets a little deeper but the humor is similar the whole time."
television,fdhxi51,t1_fdhb0kh,1578431951.0,Something had to fill the void left by Trailer Park Boys.
worldnews,fdhokk0,t1_fdh2y2t,1578427025.0,"In my mind, the people who don't care/don't vote are nearly as bad as the ones who vote for assholes. ""Oh it doesn't matter who wins, they're all the same!"" Cool, tell that to Iran? Tell that to the people who are having their benefits/insurance cut? Ugh."
AskReddit,fdho37b,t1_fdh0rkp,1578426739.0,"Right? Also live in Ohio and it always makes me roll my eyes. Like hello, do you guys not realize that the exact weather we are getting is also pretty common in the entire midwest AND even northeast basically? Yes, the weather can change quickly here, but not ONLY here."
AskReddit,fdhntfo,t1_fdgu4zc,1578426575.0,"Exactly this. To me, it means that you need to be able to see your loved ones at their worst and still love them. Nobody is perfect, nor should you expect them to be. But if their ""worst"" is unacceptably bad, then yeah, get out. Their ""best"" isn't worth your time if their ""worst"" is straight up psycho/horrible to everyone... you just also might not want to dump someone just because they have a shitty day or have bad moods!"
WoT,fdhnifr,t1_fdhhd1y,1578426395.0,"Agreed, she became 100% Aes Sedai practically overnight. In general I think Jordan's characters often seemed to let power go to their heads... at least all of the women were like that, which was a bummer."
worldnews,fdhe4ui,t1_fdgpm35,1578420740.0,"Yet annoyingly only HALF of those people at the most will actually vote to try to change things. Doesn't matter if people don't approve, they are essentially approving of him with their inaction. It's so frustrating."
WoT,fdfq3k9,t1_fdezx5u,1578367502.0,"Okay, good points all. Just finished the series for the first time like a week ago so hadn't really reflected on him that way, think I was distracted by my eye rolling haha. 

Thanks for the reply, I now want to keep him around."
WoT,fdfpbts,t1_fdf4911,1578366986.0,"I liked Egwene at times (such as when she's a captive on the tower, what a badass) but agree that there are tweaks they should make so she's not so irrationally difficult at times! She has an interesting story but was such a brat sometimes."
WoT,fdfmcum,t1_fdf23jr,1578365033.0,"I debated that too. We could lose either of them easily. Do we even need to keep the Faile kidnapping in at all? I guess Perrin learned a lot about himself from the experience but that was part of their story that I didn't find as engaging, at a minimum it could be shortened a lot."
WoT,fdfm7tl,t1_fdf1u1n,1578364943.0,"I think I just found the White Tower more interesting in general than the overall politics of Andor or any of the other countries, which is why I also found the politics Rand dealt with to be pretty meh. It just didn't feel as exciting for whatever reason!"
WoT,fdfm2ta,t1_fdf1r0b,1578364851.0,"I weirdly enjoyed his story but know I'm in the minority and that it's def not needed in the show. I liked the double bond mind reading and that he had a unique ability with the power - but again, not needed."
WoT,fdf1d4a,t1_fdextza,1578351094.0,"Fair. Only a few of them are really critical, and frankly even then they could be combined easily. I was even considering that with Slayer... not that I would want him cut, but to avoid confusion, they may combine him with one of the Forsaken and just get on with it."
WoT,fdf191f,t1_fdexr5x,1578351024.0,"True, but I swear, if HBO were doing this show, they'd find a way to show them all the time. Renly in GoT is what made me realize that. You knew in the books that he loved Loras, but the show had to actually show them naked in bed together - because it's HBO, and they can! Not that I cared, I just found it funny."
WoT,fdf0u74,t1_fdex04s,1578350761.0,"I kept notes and it was still so confusing! My notebook had a lot of things like ""dead? but maybe back as this name now??"" 

I desperately hope that any fantasy series will learn from GoT. What a mess that last season was."
WoT,fdf0qj8,t1_fdewxfa,1578350697.0,"Good point, I actually liked the White Tower politics a lot but didn't like the politics outside of that - like the huge chunks of it you'd get at times from Rand or Elayne."
WoT,fdexdvz,t1_fddnpv9,1578348609.0,"The clothing would still be pretty heavy and difficult to run in - even if the skirts are divided, it's just a lot of extra fabric and would be pretty awkward. I think the wise ones usually would wear much more lighweight fabric in cuts that made it easy to move that way. But yes probably also a bit of her just starting to act like the people around her, too!"
WoT,fdex4l1,t1_fdevm2a,1578348448.0,"Yep, I've just been reading through ""The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time,"" and that's in the part I read yesterday about the Age of Legends. People lived a long time because Aes Sedai were able to travel around quickly and cure people of most illnesses."
WoT,fdewgu3,t1_fdeqj6j,1578348036.0,"Help convince me here, what do you think he adds to the story? All I can think of is that he's a love interest for Egwene, and I guess everyone deserves one of those. I'm probably just struggling to see his value because I was so irritated by him all the time but having only read the series once, I may be missing his larger value."
WoT,fdewb4j,t1_fdeos6g,1578347940.0,"Yeah, I think all of the politics/nobles will be cut by a good amount. They'll keep a few for some drama but we do not need to spend so much time on the politics of the continent, let alone the squabbles of each city."
WoT,fdew7dx,t1_fdespk0,1578347879.0,"Morgase is a good suggestion for sure. We don't really need to spend much time actually with her, it could easily just be a story where she reappears later. Or honestly, she could actually die and I'm not sure the story would suffer much? I enjoyed her at times but it doesn't really do anything for the overall story to have her around, outside of maybe helping us learn more about the Whitecloaks (which could also be done without her there)."
WoT,fdew15b,t1_fdeptcd,1578347775.0,"I was thinking about the Forsaken as well. It was hard to track in the books (especially since some of them got new names later), but they could either reduce the number or just kill some of them off even sooner (13 is a good number for them, after all)."
WoT,fdevu8g,t1_fdep3xf,1578347662.0,"The only part that we really need them for is the Bowl of the Winds but TBH we could probably lose that whole thing without any real loss to the story. 

If it was HBO, they'd keep them around for the chance to have gratuitous boobs, but I think Amazon could go without."
WoT,fdevpa3,t1_fdemlc2,1578347580.0,Great point about the spanking and physical violence in general. I actually forgot about the spanking punishments because they were so awkward to me that I sort of pushed past them quickly and tried to forget they happened.
AmItheAsshole,fdem7bp,t1_fde9e60,1578341974.0,"I'd be a-okay with that last rumor, tbh. Also don't freak out, I'm sure people will move on soon when there is new gossip to focus on!"
AmItheAsshole,fdem4yp,t3_ekxf9z,1578341936.0,"No way! NTA and neither was your dad here. I know it might feel over the top, but your gym teacher probably also embarrassed the hell out of your, right? He had no right to do that. Bra straps slip, and people go without a bra, and those things are both fine. I'm not surprised he blew up at the administration over this."
television,fdekugh,t1_fddljzs,1578341163.0,"I didn't mind that since the battle scenes were never really my jam. They're very well done in that show, but the characters are what drew me in more than the action."
television,fdekpwz,t1_fdctgsv,1578341089.0,"I was sure he'd win, though admittedly haven't seen a lot of the other parts he was up against. He's always been great but really got to shine in that show."
AskReddit,fdejulx,t1_fddhquy,1578340560.0,"Yeah, I think this is the answer for a lot of office jobs, at least ones where you work fairly independently and have a good boss. My first job at my company had much more micro-managing going on but in my current job? My boss wouldn't even notice if I was 2 hours late because he'd assume I just had a meeting or something came up. I would just be a little behind when I got here, no big deal. Unless I was supposed to be in some meeting with more senior management, in which case my cell would be blowing up most likely."
SkincareAddiction,fdcapz6,t1_fda9hm0,1578270497.0,Same! Though I will say I've never put it on under my clothing and didn't know that was a thing. I just try to find shade whenever I can and own some SPF clothing for the beach. It's hard to be perfect but it's good to try.
AmItheAsshole,fdb23oh,t3_ekekiq,1578252859.0,NTA she may well have insecurity because of her disability which makes her act out but that's not an excuse to be a bully. What you said was not very bad at all.
SkincareAddiction,fdawnlg,t1_fdad6d3,1578251233.0,I like the Tosowoong brand ones you can get on Amazon! I also like Benton ones that I buy on Soko Glam (website with a lot of Korean skincare stuff).
AskWomen,fdaigfu,t1_fd7s2vp,1578246483.0,That is awesome. My friend at work has a super similar story. I can see how open adoptions are complex but she's also so happy with her decision and loves seeing her bio daughter thrive with her adoptive family.
SkincareAddiction,fd73fj2,t1_fd611l1,1578198945.0,"Cosrx snail 96 works great for me. I am also in the Midwest, fairly similar routine and seem to need a lot of layered stuff to keep my skin happy, especially in the winter. Sheet masks might also be good for your skin!"
cats,fd6ft5a,t1_fd3bccy,1578190333.0,My cats will allow guests to pet them but will also give them the stink eye half the time. Cracks me up. They're great to the humans they live with but essentially act like they know enough humans now and all the others are a real chore.

vegetarian,fd43dr1,t1_fd2hwju,1578164023.0,"So true. I know very few judgemental vegans in real life (the ones I did know were teenagers anyway so of course they were obnoxious). But I've had a number of vegans be rude to me online. Not at all a fair representation of the community, just what you get online unfortunately."
vegetarian,fd43276,t1_fd2b889,1578163924.0,"Some vegans are annoyed with vegetarians for not taking it far enough. Not all, obviously (such as the ones I know in real life who are chill and lovely), but many of the vocal ones of Reddit can be judgemental. This subreddit is usually a little more laid-back and supportive though."

AmItheAsshole,fcwbtvg,t3_ej5jdk,1578021782.0,NTA and I'm genuinely confused that anyone would say otherwise. Everyone knows not to do this! There is no excuse for how rude it was for him to even try!
AskWomen,fcvhr2u,t1_fcvg9e8,1578002345.0,"I'm from Cleveland and it is quite similar. The difference from area to area is stark, and I only know of a few places downtown even where you're likely to be surrounded by a diverse crowd."
redrising,fcv9nlk,t1_fcukj4u,1577997540.0,"I agree. Perhaps some really unique, cutting edge animation style could work? I definitely am not against animation since I've seen some recently that still allowed me to connect to the characters (BoJack Horseman comes to mind), and some stuff that was surprisingly realistic (Love, Death & Robots)... but I think live action is still my preference as long as the budget is there!"
interestingasfuck,fcv97p6,t1_fcv31c9,1577997272.0,Both are definitely rare still! Our politicians are mostly older but also still mostly men here in the US.

AmItheAsshole,fcuzcjb,t3_eizcvf,1577991523.0,"NTA and your cousin sounds like she belongs on r/choosingbeggars. Why did she push you to name your price if she clearly had a much lower one in mind? Why not just offer you what they could and see if you're on board? Because they're full of shit, that's probably a very reasonable rate and they just wanted you to charge next to nothing because you're related to them. It's not selfish to want money for your time especially when you could be working."
AmItheAsshole,fcuz6qq,t1_fcudkti,1577991435.0,"OP said they were in a pretty rural area but still... this is borderline r/choosingbeggars over here. If they could find someone at less than $35/hour, more power to them!"
Frugal,fcnaibi,t1_fcn9orr,1577807403.0,For sure but eating it here and there is of course reasonable if it's something you enjoy. You can indulge sometimes but still be frugal most of the time.

Does lard sometimes contain pork? Perhaps your mom just finds it hard to remember what all to avoid so a list COULD help keep it straight and kind of eliminates the excuses. Your GF probably knows it all off the top of her head but many people might just forget how many things involve pork!"
