gamernews,ffc171s,t1_ffbnk7t,1579788927.0,"The key is to find task that you want to complete and then program that. Then once its working you can go back and refactor it until its pretty maybe after your second project or your third.  Just make sure to put in more comments than you think are really necessary. If you don't you probably won't understand why you did what you did. 

&#x200B;

The thing you keep in mind is that the more experience you get the cleaner your programs can be, because you understand the language better, or you understand algorithms better.  You will learn better ways to solve the problems you solved in the past. 

Literally everyone is embarrassed by past code.  I haven't met a programmer that doesn't have code that they would prefer to not show anyone because its so bad. Or so hacky, or they stopped following their own style guide because they got lazy. People are human. They aren't born with innate understanding of programming.  Some of the most elegant software I've ever looked at the code for was written by people with 10-20 years of experience. 

Think about it this way, when you were in gradeschool learning how to write letters using the paper with the dotted lines, did you keep any of those work books? Do you look back on them thinking they were beautiful? Did you get angry with yourself that it didn't look look like it was written by a medieval master scribe?

Were the first sentences you composed equivalent to award winning prose? No of course not. But now you are able to construct sentences and convey meaning quite easily and sometimes you can be inspired enough to write something that you are actually proud of.  Most things that you write, is probably simple discussion online, and most software you write is going to be just like that. Simple purpose driven code, that accomplishes what you want. Every once in a while, you will write something so elegant you will surprise yourself.

 If you code often enough, it will be less of a surprise and happen more often. To get to that point, you need to write a lot of shitty code."
atheism,ffabul1,t3_esdko8,1579731867.0,"I truly hope that this will be handled professionally by the school. However, when I was your daughter's age I had an issue with bullies as well. Those excuses that were given to you were given to my parents and I 20 years ago. Initially The principal acted as though he was treating it seriously. But my bullies beat me up 4-5 times a week and repeatedly destroyed my property for 2 years. It was partially because I was the ""new kid"" and partially because I was an easy target based on size.

&#x200B;

 For the first few months I reported it to authority each time it happened. This took me out of class for 30-60 min each time it happened, it meant that I missed most of my social studies classes for those months.(Read as History class) Eventually My principal simply started to give me detentions to keep me inside during recess. My teachers treated these detentions as actual detentions so I had to write lines for my breaks. 

&#x200B;

Eventually I wanted my recess back more than I cared about the pain. My parents couldn't agree on a course of action. My father told me to fight back. My mother only wanted me to speak to the principal or a teacher so that they could handle it. Given that I kept getting punished when I went to the authorities.

&#x200B;

I tried to fight back, but because the bully had about 30lbs and 5 inches on me (he had been held back and I had been put forward a year) I got my ass kicked worse. I asked to be put in a martial art, any martial art So that I could at least learn how to limit the amount of pain I was in, but my mother Vetoed the idea, because she felt that I was already ""fighting"" too much.

&#x200B;

Needless to say the problem continued until I was no longer at that school and the impact of living in fear of my bullies, and the way the authorities treated it had an impact on me into my 20's. 

&#x200B;

I eventually came to terms with enough of it to be a functional adult. I still have a hard time believing that anyone likes me. I always feel like eventually they will show their true colors and betray me to an unknown enemy. I will never trust anyone in a position of power to help solve my issues, and unless I feel my life is certainly threatened I won't contact them willingly.

(like 3 city blocks away) In my polling area, I had to visit some people 3 or 4 times before they would actually get out and vote.

What I do know is that of the people who said that they would support my candidate, eventually 80% of them ended up voting on election day. I can't say for certain whether my harassment led to some voting against the candidate but she was elected. It was a very busy day of knocking on doors and talking to people after weeks and weeks of visiting everyone in the area.

&#x200B;

Yes C-Levels have their purpose, and it is important. They choose direction, and decide which risks are worth pursuing, they have final say on decisions that effect everyone in a company.  but they are not nearly as necessary on a day to day basis.  Most of the C-Levels I've ever dealt with generally just pick  the winners among their VPs when trying to find a solution.  Those kinds of decisions are not easy and can be very stressful and ultimately most C-Levels expect the odd call at 2am to deal with something urgent. Do I think that most C-Levels need to spend more time in the office? No. I think their job has much different time requirements and scheduling.  

Do I think that they are more important to company sucess than the bottom workers? Maybe individually depending on the size of the company. 

Could the ""Team"" of C-Levels disappear for a week and the company continue without them? Probably. 

Could the same be said for the warehouse team? or the team in charge of manufacturing? or whatever else is the main revenue generator?

worldnews,ff1b7xk,t1_ff0aoiu,1579477056.0,"I hope I don't get down voted for this because I sound like I am in favour of PIMPs.

 I am ambivalent , but I would love to hear more about this if you would like to talk about it. My first Elementary school was in a bad part of town and I had a few friends who's mothers were prostitutes. 

None of them had a PIMP. As far as I could tell it caused some problems. Their mothers had to bring some of their regular johns home, which meant that these friends ended up at my parents place on certain days, once my mother found out. (previously, they would either be told to stay in their room for hours at a time, or set loose on the neighbourhood (which was not a very nice neighbourhood, we needed  to check for broken needles in the yard anytime we played outside)  if the weather was decent.)

Some times I would see their mothers with visible bruises, but they never felt comfortable talking about those things with me. (Probably because they could see how different my life was.) 

These friends didn't really have a male role model besides a dad in jail if they knew who their dad was at all. My dad  would have probably stepped up more  but he was busy trying to make a small business successful at the time and didn't get home until basically my bedtime most nights at the time. I don't even know if he knew about the situation some of my friends were in. 

Eventually my mother with the help of a few local charities and some grant money, started a charity that created cheap (or free if money was a problem that would stop a kid from being able to attend) after school programs for kids at that school.  It usually included a small snack, to build on the school lunch program that was already running at that school. 

&#x200B;

In an alternate reality where we never moved to that neighbourhood do you think a PIMP would have added stability to their lives? I've never known a PIMP. I would imagine that some might be motivated by protecting a sibling in  sex work, that then becomes protecting her friends too. I imagine many others are simply motivated by the Money and the lifestyle. But if you say you were partially raised by one, you probably understand it  much better than I could and I want to know what you think about them."

AskReddit,ff0d679,t1_fez305i,1579467775.0,"My fiance and I live like that now. Yes we could make more money by her working, but given her educational level most of the jobs available to her are minimum wage jobs that treat people poorly. Added to this her anxiety makes it difficult for her to search for new work if her workplace is abusive. ( Her last boss was extremely abusive) Ultimately, she is able to save us more money by keeping house during the day than if she was working anyway. 

We eat extremely well, because she has the time to cook amazing food. She fixes my clothes if I tear them in a way that you can't tell. She handles the mental load of the household. I have a few chores that are my responsibility but otherwise I don't normally have to think about so many things that make our life work. 

I've had to handle the mental load of a household before while still maintaining employment. It wasn't easy. She is also simply better at multitasking than I am. It makes her much better at handling things like complex meals while waiting on the laundry and cleaning the home. 

Running the household full time does give her a bit more time to explore her creativity, through her various Artistic hobbies. Which means that our walls are covered with art, that I paid artist cost on. 

It does mean we need to stick to the budget pretty hard, but the tax benefits are pretty awesome. Plus when we need  to organize things like my brother's baby shower last year, she had the time to get things prepared. 

If she wants to get a job, she can. We have talked about it many times. I would definitely take on more of the household work, and some mental load tasks would become my responsibility.  

If she worked I don't think it would be reasonable to expect her to cook (almost) every night. I think we would probably eat out more, given that she wouldn't have  the time to cook every day and she practically has a fit when she watches me try to cook anything. 

I think we would probably spend much more on things like vacations, because she wouldn't have the time to plan them out as thoroughly and we would need to get away more often because of the increased stress of both of us working and managing the household together.

 She wouldn't have the time to search for good deals online for the things we need so we would probably spend more for those things. 

Her handling the house duties completely changed my life. Its changed my opinion on whether I should date someone without a job.  Its definitely not for everyone but for us, its pretty damn perfect."

Not apologizing is taking the stance that you are completely faultless in the situation and are too Self-absorbed to acknowledge that you are imperfect or that you did everything possible to prevent the issue. 

&#x200B;

If for instance you weren't paying attention when leaving a building and the door closed in the previous person's face, if you notice that it happened, it is expected that you apologize. If you think that apology is a  sign of weakness, you do not understand our culture. That apology is a sign of strength. Its in a way a humble brag. It says ""Hey I noticed that this thing happened to you. I could have done something to prevent it, I just didn't notice that you needed the help."" Not apologizing shows that either, you didn't notice their distress, (because you are unobservant, or because you are completely self absorbed at the moment.) or that you did it intentionally. (because you have a personal vendetta with that person) 

&#x200B;

Its a platitude that shows that you recognize that the other person is human, and what they experienced is probably at least slightly distressing. Choosing to not apologize is choosing to view the other person as less than you.

At the begining of the year the science teacher stated that she didn't normally mark homework because she felt that it help people learn the material and so people will do most of it. I had no problem getting 80%+ on the tests without doing the homework so I didn't. She didn't like this. One of the regular homework assignments was a title page for each new topic. 

I don't like to draw so I didn't do them. About half way through the year suddenly she wants to mark these title pages. suddenly they are worth 10% of your final grade.  All I had for my title pages was the topic name written on a blank sheet in my binder, so she tried to give me 10 0% marks for my title pages. I argued to the priciple that because she hadn't given us any rubric or given us  any particular expectations I should get full marks, because without some sort of instruction on how it would be marked I should get full marks on it.   Then she starts adding a bunch of requirements to the title pages. Things like poems, grading based on color usage and rhyme scheme.  Then she increases the final grade percentage value  to 30% for the title pages going forward saying that the effort required to make a great title page like that will ensure that the student understands the topic. 

So I pull up my socks and create a title page masterpiece with A poem in iambic pentameter and an aa bb cc ...etc rhyme scheme. It has contrasting colors to draw the eye to the various ""features""  of the page. I got 3/10 on that title page. I know that one of the others in my class received a 90% for a title page that didn't have a poem and simply had the topic name written in pencil crayon.  When I showed that person my page with my mark they felt that they were being patronized because they were a girl and based on previous things that the teacher had said. 

She was angrier than I was. (I knew that I wasn't going to do well on it because of the previous hsitory, but I needed to make something that would prove my point to my principal.) We went to the principal together. He asked if he could keep the title pages. We gave them to him.  Class continued as usual for a while. I did the bare minimum on those title pages going forward to ensure that I had each part of it completed even if not great. 

at the end of the year my mark was around 60% and I wasn't going to be able to make it into the school that I wanted because of it. My prinicpal called me into the office after I wrote my science final and told me that he was going to be retroactively giving me 100% on each of those title pages because ""this was a science class and not an art class"".

Do you trust that every one of your friends on facebook is good enough with computers that you trust every device they use? Because if the answer is no, your security settings don't matter.

If you post something on a service on the internet, you do not know who has access to it. You do not know how good the companies security policy is. You do not know how the users of the system treat security. 

 (I bet you even at Facebook, there are passwords on sticky notes. I've never seen a company that doesn't have at least a couple of those because the average person has no real understanding of the computer that they are using.) 

Sure your photos aren't stored in the accounting system, but I bet there is a Developer with Test database API access who has his credentials stored insecurely. Test databases are normally old clones of Prod, because it is very hard to create good test data otherwise.

The internet is a place where you can get pretty much any information that you want because copying data is very inexpensive. there is a reason why rule 34 exists. there is a reason why you can still download from the pirate bay after most of the western world governments spent millions trying to shut them down."

If they mention that you're quiet. Just respond with ""Wait, was I not talking out loud a minute ago... or was it in my head? Damn, What are we talking about again? This is good shit...""

Anyone you're smoking with will laugh after that and you'll get brought back into the conversation.

I don't care what my tolerance is, I smoke all night, every night but, for the first 5-15 minutes after smoking I cannot hold a coherent thought in my head and speak it.  Most stoners will understand. The worst that you'll get is teased that you don't have high tolerance.

AskReddit,fdn6wcu,t1_fdmsalc,1578578936.0,"Oh my parents tried to escalate. my mom was abused as a child and as such would never resort to violence but otherwise was very strict.

If I received a mark lower than 80% on anything I would be grounded for 2 weeks. They used this punishment any time I disobeyed them in any other way as well. Normally the groundings would be from one activity. like no video games for two weeks.

In grade 7 I had a hard time understanding my math teacher. So did the rest of the class.  In one unit test the class average was 30%.( I got a 60% on that test) Because the teacher realized that the class didn't understand the topic, he re-administered that unit test ( with different questions)  6 times in 2 weeks.  As such I got multiple marks below 80% for the same thing.

 So it escalated. No video games, then no computer access, then No TV, then no reading novels, then no phone calls with  friends, then no reading the encyclopedias. Each time increasing the length of grounding by 2 weeks. So eventually I ran out of things to do. 

(My siblings and I already did most of the chores that my parents would trust us to do. For instance, my dad wouldn't have let me change the oil on his truck, but I was already mowing the lawn twice a week and doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen every night and vacuuming and dusting the house when I got home from school. ) 

I was so bored, that I started trying to meditate. which is when it occurred to me that they don't have anything to take away from me. So I stopped doing any of my homework. I would come home do my chores  and then sit quietly on the floor of the ""guest living room"" (because it was quiet and there was no tv in that room) and would meditate until supper, do the dishes and then meditate until bed. When those home work assignments came home as 0% marks later that week, they got very angry, but didn't know what to do to me. 

They tried to yell at me to do my home work, I kept my cool (meditating helps with emotional control) and said, ""I don't really feel like it right now, maybe later when I get bored of this."" (which was the most flippant I had ever been at this point)

My parents got angry, started yelling, my mother slapped me. I didn't respond to any of it. Just kept my thousand yard stare and stayed in my head. Over the next minute or so the imprint of her hand turned red on my face. She looked at my neutral  expression, with her hand print glowing on my cheek and started crying. My father was mad about the flippancy but had never been invested in punishing me for my grades (he didn't excel in school).

They went to their bedroom to talk, twenty minutes later, they asked me if I wanted to watch TV with them. still angry with them I said "" I'm grounded remember, maybe one day in 5 years or so I'll be out of school and won't be grounded, we can do it then.""

That's when they broke, they realized that I was prepared for the long haul, and that they couldn't actually force me to do anything. They asked, ""If we were to stop the grounding today, (I was up to something like 3 months at that point) would you watch an hour of tv with us?""  

And thats when I knew I won. So I watched x-files with them, and then read the novel that my teacher had assigned for novel study, (which I hadn't read yet because I was grounded from novels.)

Never again did my parents ground me. Instead they would simply ask me why I did poorly, and leave it at that."

I thought you were saying that you prefer size order simply so that you could shop more quickly without looking at tags so that you could pick clothing and check out as fast as possible. I have some friends that shop like that, Literally just grabbing clothes that Have an L on them in a pattern that they like and checking out.  The fit of their clothes leaves much to be desired that way. Many people (especially men) seem to think that if they have something to hide, that they should just look for baggy clothing not realizing that baggy clothing makes them look both bigger and sloppy. Where as clothes that fit generally are designed to break up the lines on problem areas anyway.  In many cases these are people with less weight to lose than me, who end up feeling self-conscious about their size because their clothing makes them look bigger than they are.

If you want to look good in your clothes, you should be trying them on at the very least. (Tailoring is ultimately not that expensive either and a good tailor can make clothes fit so well.) 

Clothes that properly fit will never be able to be reduced to some thing as simple as Small, Medium, Large, extra large. Most of my work shirts don't even have those designations, just measurements. So why would I want them to organize the store entirely by size?  Normally at the thrift shop that I go to they organize which rack is which by color, but the clothing on the rack itself is organized by size.

It provides a point on which to begin conversation. Once you have a conversation with a geeky girl, you are pretty much in. Ask her who her favorite character is, tease her about her ""crush"" and then Tell her you'll buy her a drink if she buys one first. 

If she buys your drink, you are in. Heck there have been a few times where I didn't even need to buy that second round because they just wanted to get back to my place where its quiet and we could talk more comfortably. (Naked and wrapped in my blanket)

Its not about it being too bright to sleep, because once you actually make it to bed you can always put a blindfold on.

 It seems that conservative media has brainwashed a significant number of people in a way that makes them get triggered by news that mentions normal sources of truth (university studies, Committees, Court trials, Scientists, technical experts, etc.) it makes them stop listening the moment that one of these sources are cited.
