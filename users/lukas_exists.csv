There was a this kid (we can call Geoffrey) I saw on my first day of secondary school who was acting like a bit of a dick to the people around by shouting irritating phrases at them and just being overall a knob. He would disrespect the teachers, throw things around in class etc. 

There is another kid who had recently broken his arm (let’s just call him hunter) who at the time was being bullied by the kids a year above him.

One time, during our lunch break, Hunter was having insults and slurs yelled at him by the bullies I previously mentioned.  Geoffrey decided to step in and stand up for Hunter, which felt out of character, and when the bullies decided to lash  out he went crazy on them and full on kicked one of the bullies in the balls (Ouch, I know) and put the other one in a headlock while the one he had kicked was just rolling around in agony. A teacher soon intervened in the chaos and separated Geoffrey from the bully. The two bullies got sent to the medical room while Geoffrey had to go to the headteachers office. Apparently Geoffrey got suspended but most people in my school, including me respect him.

Hunter hasn’t been bullied ever since.

TL;DR annoying kid stands up for bullies kid by beating up bullies
