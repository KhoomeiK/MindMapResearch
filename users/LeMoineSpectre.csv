headphones,fdwlptr,t3_elyvxd,1578759964.0," So, here's what happened: I got a Roku for Christmas and I just wanted to hook it up to see how it worked. I don't have cable on my TV, just a BluRay player. I should mention that, since there was no way to directly hook the Sennheisers up to my TV, I bought an HDMI converter box, which I plugged the red and black audio jacks into, as well as an HDMI cable connected to my TV. Anyway, I unplugged all that to see how to set up my Roku, but I'm not quite ready to stop using the BluRay player completely. So I hook everything back up... and I can't use the headphones to hear audio anymore.

It's really strange, sometimes they won't even charge, sometimes they will. The audio is coming out of the TV speakers now, instead of the headphones. Try as I might, I can't get audio out of them. At least, audio from my BluRay player. Recently, I think I've been picking up TV audio, but it's audio from a program that isn't even currently being viewed on any of the TVs in the house.

I've moved cords around, switched plugs, unplugged everything and plugged it back in. I've looked for menu options on my remotes (I know on some TVs, you have to mute the speaker audio to get audio out of the headphones). Nothing works, and I don't even know what I did wrong.

Can anyone please help me or provide any clue as to what I need to do or fix? If you need any more information to answer my question, just ask

Thanks for the help"
