You get 1-3 seeds from each fruit in the seed maker so it’ll take a few months but within 2 seasons of fruiting you should have a decent amount.

It’s the harder road but the most rewarding one. Teach them to think about what is and isn’t right and to stand up for the oppressed and for themselves. School is the perfect time to learn those lessons because it doesn’t have a huge effect on their future. Having them practice standing up to authorities abusing power sets them up to be more than oppressed.

(29 years according to [this source from the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/polio.html)). It’s probably one of the safer ones to skip unless you’re travelling outside of the developed world. Obviously everyone should still get vaccinated for it because it’s a terrible disease but the chances of getting it in the UK is currently next to zero.

One that hasn’t just sat on its collective ass and done nothing while the world literally burned. I’d much, much rather be a millennial than someone who has no principles, no foresight, and no compassion for their fellow man. People are fucking burning alive because of the policies you generation championed and now will die before you see the effect of. Millennial is not an insult because millennials have not been silent in this. 

Or, more concisely put: okay boomer."

MorbidReality,fe6t7nd,t1_fe6rqpx,1578904309.0,"Well golly gee you sure you got me this time. 

Or, just as a wild speculation, you still didn’t read the damn paper. If you did, I’m not suggesting that you haven’t, I’m sure that you’d have realised that this paper looks at 2 studies and that the second one had a bigger sample size and focused specifically on residents (remember: these are currently actual doctors) and medical students: these smart cookies will become doctors very soon and spend a lot of time in hospitals and classrooms learning). 

Oh and just in case you accidentally skimmed over this bit from study 1: Consistent with previous work, results revealed a main effect of target race, such that participants reported lower pain ratings for the black vs. white target. This effect was qualified by the predicted interaction between target race and false beliefs. 

Or if you’re still pondering study 2: Study 2 demonstrates that, similar to white laypersons in study 1, many white medical students and residents hold beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites, many of which are false and fantastical in nature, and that these false beliefs are related to racial bias in pain perception. Furthermore, study 2 also reveals that white medical students and residents who endorsed false beliefs showed racial bias in the accuracy of their pain treatment recommendations. Specifically, participants who endorsed more of these beliefs reported that a black (vs. white) target patient would feel less pain and they were less accurate in their treatment recommendations for the black (vs. white) patient. Although the effect sizes for these findings were not large ( = 0.03 and 0.04), the practical importance is significant: those endorsing more false beliefs rated the pain of a black (vs. white) patient half a scale point lower and were less accurate in their treatment recommendations 15% of the time. 

But what do I know? I’m just so stupid. After all, [there definitely](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/19944378/) isn’t [any evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17187552/) backing up [my point. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/10613935/)"
MorbidReality,fe6rccw,t1_fe6ng2d,1578901744.0,"Literally in the first paragraph it says that the study included and specifically found racial biases in medical students and residents. Medical students become doctors. Residents are doctors. So how exactly does this not relate to doctors? 

You didn’t even read the first three sentences of the damn study you said was proving your point. You proved yourself not only wrong, but idiotic."

As for Apollo’s yellow eyes, let’s not forget that we see them when he uses his power to fix Persephone’s hand. It’s absolutely linked to him using his power and he may have the power to influence people in LO."

It’s not fair to make Hades the bad guy when you remember that he tried so damn hard to be there for her. Minthe is an adult and adults are expected to control themselves and not hit people. 

Hades should absolutely not be flirting with Persephone while I’m a relationship. But that does not invite violence onto him. Minthe may be unhappy but that is no excuse to make Hades unhappy too."

It’s a tough issue with no good answer that will make everyone happy. I did Brazilian jiu-jitsu and a lot of the women weren’t happy about having to fight a woman early in her transition. Not because they hate trans people but because they weren’t part of the conversation and they didn’t see it as fair. And they have a point! Going through puberty as a biological male gives trans women a huge advantage when it comes to sports. They have more muscle mass, greater bone density, and tend to be taller. That gives them an advantage

There’s nothing wrong with wanting to be part of the conversation when the consequences affect you."
