As a tangent, could you cast my ashes into a skull-shaped orb and encase that in a clear sphere, akin to a bowling ball? My kids and I are huge fans of the movie Mystery Men. And I would love to pass along to the coming generations as a haunted, supernatural bowling ball, watching my family from the fireplace mantle.
EDIT- But I wouldn’t be super thrilled to sit in a moldy bowling bag in the back of the closet. So don’t even think of leaving me there!"
