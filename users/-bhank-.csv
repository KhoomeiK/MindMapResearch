army,ff93rji,t1_ff89oqk,1579704133.0,Nice. I think 5 years is sufficient enough time.
army,ff88ub1,t1_ff7q5rg,1579669380.0,"So, a while back the Army put in that after a 3 year break in service all prior service would have to attend BCT regardless if they were active, reserve or guard. Then it was changed where prior service would go to a prior service BCT refresher course. But due to budget constraints now only active duty prior service attend regular BCT. 

Finding this information is tough. It's buried somewhere. I had almost a 3 year break in service and went back into the Reserves but was told even if I had waited I wouldn't have gone back to BCT. So really the best source of information is a recruiter or contact goarmy.com directly. (That's who I asked)."
army,ff7q13m,t3_es4fyr,1579655566.0,Yep. Go NG or Reserves.

army,fehh5o9,t1_feh20md,1579116437.0,I was told there is a point cutoff too that you must meet. It's put out each year and remains for a full year. I  cant find it online and I think you have to log into AKO or some site to access it. (At work so don't have access)
army,feher4q,t1_fegyk4j,1579115033.0,"True, but you need a 4187 to attend anyhow. 

Either way, its all here:  [AR 350-1, page 59, paragraphs 3-15f](https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/ARN18487_R350_1_Admin_FINAL.pdf)"
army,fegntr9,t1_feet5w2,1579098261.0,This is the correct answer. I think you have to wait 6 months before attending again.
army,fefvk8v,t3_eoy4da,1579066594.0,Why the Air Force? What are you fearing with the Army?

Your credit card is protected from unauthorized transactions and if ever there is unauthorized purchases you will be refunded the amount back to the card quickly.

I now work as a web developer (like the majority or people on Reddit it seems) and love it. Not all companies are the same for this career but I can nearly go all day without having to talk to anyone. 

Now, I just have to find a way to get a small refrigerator and microwave for my desk and a way to hide the gallon of piss. That way I don't have to fake smile during lunch or while walking to and from the bathroom."
army,fdl95ef,t1_fdky1y1,1578519155.0,"Yep, I understand that. Same reason I initially joined. I had a decent career, made decent money, had promotion potential but something seemed to be missing. I was lucky and after BCT/AIT, my first duty assignment was Germany. Overall, I say go for it. It might turn into a fun mid-life crisis but if you're lucky you'll get an overseas assignment to Germany or Italy and really enjoy it (if you choose to go active). I'd advise getting the shortest contract possible initially so you can try to re-up for an overseas tour. Depending on your MOS you could even get very lucky and spend time in places like England on an Air Force base."
army,fdkvqc1,t1_fdku1cs,1578512146.0,Np! Thanks for posting it!
army,fdkuacg,t3_elvq9s,1578511292.0,"So, I went in a bit older than most recruits and one of my oldest friends was 42 when he went to basic training. He was fine. He just kept to himself and found older adults to hang out with (while in AIT) and he was National Guard. 

You didn't really state what your motivation was for going back in and not doing 20. As a GM you should have brought home a decent salary and as you stated the less of a paycheck isn't a deal breaker for you. Are you looking for the retirement money? A plaque on the wall? Travel time with battle buddies? For shit stories at the VFW bar? 

You're also going to have to bite your tongue a lot until you are an NCO (probably until around E6 at least). Because there will be a 23 year old issuing orders that wont make a bit of sense to you or to them. Once you make E6/E7 then your GM experience will shine and you'll probably be able make a bigger difference. While on active duty I got a bit more respect from the Sr. NCO's based on my age but also because they knew I wasn't going to be a problem for them. Each interaction I had with NCO's that were a lot younger than me, I treated it as a training session. Although, they were telling me what to do, writing my quarterly counselings, etc. , I would tactically advise and give suggestions on things that I saw could be done better. Whether or not they realized it, it was helping them be a better leader and helping us maintain mission."
army,fdks896,t3_elwtg0,1578510071.0,"Well, this is actually credit monitoring which is better. Considering you can check your credit score for free regardless. Credit monitoring for free service members is quite nice.

Here is the eligibility:

...I certify I am on active duty status, as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(d); or I am a reservist performing duty under a call or order to active duty under a provision of law referred to in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13); or I am a member of the National Guard, as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(c). I agree that I may be asked to recertify my status under one of these provisions every two years."

army,fdioyhp,t3_elldwf,1578447782.0,"It really comes down to what your DD214 / Discharge Separation has for a RE Code. Your recruiter can look it up or you can try Google. Sometimes you have to just wait for a period of time and sometimes you can't get in at all. 

You can also try your states National Guard. They have lower requirements when it comes to prior service. They often have active duty contracts with the National Guard also. My first contract was under a program called 'Active First'."
Frontend,fdi8nj7,t3_elg701,1578437716.0,"If you can view a persons recent work then that alone should qualify and no further testing should be needed. If they are working on their own projects, open source, etc. If something is weird with their code, then maybe give them a quick algorithm problem to do and have them explain the various other ways the solution could be solved and the pros and cons of each - this can be done over the phone. 

&#x200B;

If you're looking to hire junior developers or someone without any code then I agree that a small weekend project would be fine. Depending on how strict the current work culture is would define the level of leeway in creativity they have. Be careful with this though, because any good developer may question various requirements you're asking and ultimately may walk away if they feel you don't have your ducks in a row. I've actually done this myself and refused a coding test because the interviewer seemed like it was a waste of time and part of a game. They offered me a job afterwards, I declined it."

army,fd46ip8,t1_fd1ne36,1578164872.0,"In my experience, typically one alcohol related incident won't disqualify you from a clearance. Additional charges, and especially other similar related charges may result in longer delays of being granted or disqualified."
army,fd15bt8,t3_ejtwyt,1578127662.0,"An investigation interview doesn't guarantee you a clearance. Depending on which MOS you chose you either need the clearance by the end of BCT or by then end of AIT. If you need one by the end of BCT and you fail to obtain one, you will get pulled out of BCT to then pick a different MOS which is usually just a couple needs of the Army MOS options. Or the option to go home, which will normally take them forever to out process you.

army,fctqkl2,t1_fctnaet,1577954386.0,"I agree. I went home 2  out of 3 times. I was bored as hell. Sure, the first couple hours with family is alright but after I found myself sitting in a bar by myself. The third time I took a vacation to Florida. It was so much better."
