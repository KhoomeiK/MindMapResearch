Makeup,femyh09,t3_epzi89,1579272846.0,"The best thing imo is regular eyeshadow.  
Cheap contour palettes from elf or nyx (the $5 ones that just have 2 or 4 colors) have light, very warm brown low-pigment colors that look really good brushed over brows. It helps fill in without being too opaque, so it's never bold enough to look unnatural, and it won't make your brows look super shaped since it's not a gel.  
I use a damp spool brush, but one of my friends just taps it over her brows with a regular small makeup brush, so i think you can apply however's easiest to you.  
(I personally don't use eyebrow kits, the colors tend to be a bit too bold for lighter hair colors, for a no-makeup look)  


The eyelashes part is easy! Most makeup brands have a ""clear"" mascara where it's an uncolored, slightly tacky, gel that dries matte. It lifts your lashes up & deepens their natural color without adding any pigment, so it ends up looking just like your normal lashes but a bit more intense! If that doesn't add enough, there are brown mascaras you can use."

Other commenters trying to pin a red flag on it may be trying to protect you from some bad experiences they've had, but it's really not that deep and I'm sure she's really not as immature/manipulative as they're trying to make her out to be, if an issue as small as this is significant enough in the scope of your relationship for you to post about."
relationship_advice,fegpshs,t3_eovxx2,1579099658.0,"OP it 100% sounds like she was just embarrassed. If she thought stripping & changing the bedding would've taken care of the mess, and then you asked for a towel, then that's how she came to realize there was more than she expected and her haste to clean it left a mess on the mattress itself.

You'd feel silly for not having been able to prevent, expect, or handle that sort of mess from your own dog in your own home, and then your options are to let your s/o, whose approval you care about, sleep with a towel between them and a puddle of dog piss, or let them go home and get some real sleep in their own clean bed and, hopefully, forget about what happened on their last trip to see you.   
It's easy to feel stupid when you find a mess that shouldn't be there & worse when you fail to fix it- but her new s/o was there to witness it all, and possibly judge her or her home pretty heavily if that's the only visit there for the rest of the week. I'm pretty sure most people would feel a bit defensive, esp those of us who are self conscious or socially anxious like young women in a fresh 18 month relationship tend to be. She probably is worried about you judging her for it.  
I know I, when I had a dog, would've 100% not let a significant other sleep in that bed prior to my next chance to actually clean and disinfect the mattress, esp if they asked for a towel and I realized it was worse than expected, and my ego would be pretty bruised for a bit.  
A good way to reassure her, without making her feel like you're still thinking about what happened, is making/confirming plans for your next visit with her to show that you still wanna see her & visit again."

smallboobproblems,fdjs70c,t3_elpx5y,1578485563.0,"Hey OP, his response is extremely shallow, dismissive, and inconsiderate. The other person who said it's a matter of actively getting off to or getting off with those women is just a dramatic piece of shit who probably uses things like porn habits to excuse cheating and vice-versa when things like that really should depend on the couples' agreed upon boundaries.  
 I know you'll hate me for saying this, but do you see long-term viability in this guy? You don't deserve to be made to feel like that, and you don't know if it'll ever end or what those particular porn habits say about his long-term honesty and satisfaction with you. I just know that the anxiety, for me, is too much to handle a lot of the time. That's all-  
Just a reminder that your body type is also plenty of peoples' preference, and there are people out there who will dedicate themselves to different degrees of monogamy with their spouse based on their and their spouse's needs, and people who set their spouse As their standard or really do only have eyes for their spouse. + and that if he has an entire twitter account where he even rts those posts, he may have a much more problematic/frequent relationship with porn than you initially expected.  
You are beautiful and awesome and you deserve all the love and respect in the world- I respect if you feel like you get that enough from him, and you're happy with him, and you're justified no matter how you handle this. Communication is key, tho"

relationship_advice,fdaoequ,t3_ek5xnk,1578248399.0,"Speaking as someone happily married with a very reciprocative sex life, I didn't start out even knowing how to give one, I didn't super enjoy it, and it took me a good bit of time to get good and feel good with it.  
I think she started seeing sex as solely about each person getting to finish. If there's a precedent of you guys prioritizing making each of you finish, she may think that \_how\_ it happens isn't nearly as important as ensuring that it happens at all.  


Being more comfortable will help her move past her bad experiences. Most women can finish without oral- the partner can stimulate areas that feel good while having PIV, or initiate enough good foreplay, or find the right position to make it feel better. (women just straight-up have most of their nerve endings on the outside, feeling with penetration comes from angle, speed, & girth)  
You can try PIV after you've eaten her out and she already feels good, you can suggest 69ing so that she gets satisfied while pleasing you, or suggest that she doesn't have to swallow or that she can do it as just foreplay. You can even, I promise, tell her you're not comfortable giving head if she isn't and start fingering her instead to show her the emotional part of caring about your partner doing the most to make you feel good.  
Another thing that's extremely important is just getting used to it. PIV gets less comfortable for her the less she does it, and will start feeling better as she starts doing it more. (You'll also get better at multitasking to help her if you guys do it more, and you can start out by just practicing as foreplay or just to finish inside her) She'll get used to giving head, get better at it, and make it easier for herself, once she starts doing it.  


I'm sure eating her out wasn't easy or fun for you at first, either.  
Going down on her to make her cum wouldn't feel good for you if you didn't care so much about her.  


Point being, her reasoning for seeing it as unnecessary is probably ""We both finish either way"" when your reasoning is more in the lane of being mutually caring partners. If sex for you is about more than nutting, (bc asking someone who thinks they're satisfying you to do something to satisfy you more could easily make them feel used), then communicate that part to her. That's the important part that reminds her sex is about caring about the other person as much as it is about making them cum, and is the part that'll to show her she's being selfish.  
If she realizes it's relevant to your *relationship* as much as it is to your sex life, and still doesn't care enough to be more receptive to compromise, and there isn't serious trauma behind it, then it's not going to work out. If she cares about you little enough to completely disregard a small step that will make you feel more cared about, she's likely to disregard ways to be caring towards you in other aspects of life as well."

explainlikeimfive,fciyiwd,t3_ehbpmk,1577672890.0,"The menstruation blood loss thing people have mentioned is v minuscule and shaky as a relevant fact because of that bc it's usually shedding uterine tissue and lubricant that comes out during menstruation but!  


Uteri and fallopian tubes are what's called hollow organs- like stomachs, intestines, or bladders, which just refers to organs that aren't solid masses of organ tissue or contain/produce something other than blood.  
Meaning that, in addition to regularly taking up more space than any rough equivalent you could think of for men (such as ureters, testes, prostate glands, etc.) they're also not filled with or filtering blood! Even prior to menstruation, it's actually building up uterine tissue instead of blood, and the blood that's lost is so little your body remakes it as its lost.  
 So your uterus/fallopian tubes do reduce your overall carrying capacity for blood volume.  
And, while your first thought may be that boob mass makes up for that taken space, that's actually filled with breast tissue, which is a combination of glands and hollow organ tissue, and fat, which needs no blood; compared to muscle, which is live tissue that needs blood for perfusion, and also what men usually have in that area. (Obvi it very slightly increases veins/capillaries that need to perfuse the surface area but mens bodies have external genitalia and on average tend to have better circulation so I assume that part kinda evens out)  


So the menstruation fact wasn't quite right, but your reproductive organs do factor in on their own to having slightly less blood volume than a male of your size!"
relationship_advice,fbdgw5t,t1_fbd65ud,1576761785.0,"I wouldn't go so far as contempt towards her for being married at her age, but I 100% agree that this boils almost entirely down to a maturity and communication issue.   


 He can't know if he's being wildly inconsiderate without being brought to understand it, and you, OP, can't know what counts as reasonable expectations for him based on his maturity or lack thereof if you don't try to set some.   
 A headset is a good idea for a sound compromise, but him wanting you to sacrifice opportunities for sleep to be there while also paying no mind to your presence bc he wants to play his games (on top of being verbally aggressive while doing so next to someone with anxiety, being on tik tok while/after you make him food, and gaming up until he literally can't anymore) sounds like he's struggling to prioritize and being generally absent from the relationship as a result, despite showing that he can function in the rest of life and does want to be with you in some capacity.   


 You're doing a lot for someone who seems to be prioritizing their own sense of indulgence over their relationship and their spouse's well-being, and all you can really do is communicate to try to understand where he's coming from (if he wants you present, but doesn't want to pat attention to your presence, there has to be some sort of compromise/explanation based on why he's like that) and open his eyes to understanding where you're coming from, the unequal standards of how considerate and attentive each one of you is expected to and can get away with being."
