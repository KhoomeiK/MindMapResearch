I’d say, however, that the statistical likelihood of you being “not attractive” is high.  Given that we’re on reddit, you’re being defensive, and most people are genuinely unattractive.  

I’m sure you have some follow up with ad hominem attacks, screaming “incel”, or where you parse through my comment history to find something that, without context, supports your snap-judgements. You know what I say?  Kick all that to the wayside and just accept that you’re unremarkable, I’m unremarkable, the OP is unremarkable, and it’s downright ludicrous to get so offended from such a silly post on a redundant and insidiously divisive subreddit."
