AskAnAmerican,feh6y9g,t3_ep2otd,1579110432.0,"Basically we got a jump start on the second Industrial revolution, and have pushed on from there. as to why we got a jumpstart, here's part of an essay I wrote for APUSH  ""America had already undergone one industrial revolution during the first half of the 19th century, a revolution which likely would not have stopped but for the Civil War. This had been enabled by the American system, a series of laws which supported American industry and transport, and by the Embargo Acts around the War of 1812. This first industrial revolution already provided America with a lot of capital and technology which enabled further technological advancements. The US had also received a large influx of capital from British investors, who now saw the profitability of investing in American industry. However, as aforementioned, the Civil War interrupted this revolution. However, it paved the way for the Second Industrial Revolution. Due to secession, the Republican North passed many pro-industry laws as well as railroad legislation. These railroads enabled goods to be transported all over the country, making further innovation easier, as now inventors and production did not need to be near the consumer market or resources, and enabling regional specialization. Furthermore, the patent system, as set up within the US constitution, very much supported American invention and innovation, as it incentivized inventors to create since they could profit from their inventions. By ensuring that they could profit off their inventions, inventors would be more compelled to produce since they could make money solely out of inventing. The final thing that enabled the second industrial revolution was the new influx of a large labor force. Millions of immigrants, pouring in from Ireland, Eastern Europe, and Southern Europe, which in conjunction with a huge population boom, left employers with millions of workers willing to work long hours for cheap. This enabled them to have more money with which to progress, thus driving the industrial revolution."" a lot of this legislation is still around today, and that incentivizes growth and innovation. furthermore, we haven't been wracked by war and communism, allowing us to develop. and since we have reached a very advanced point technologically, we now profit more from ideas than from labor, enabling rapid growth. If you look at similar countries like Israel and Japan, once you reach the point where you are growing from ideas and innovation and not physical labor, your economy booms. also, just like how US aid helped those countries grow, French and British investors (and a lack of workers rights) enabled us to grow in the way we did"

facepalm,feff2i3,t1_fef7aw4,1579054965.0,"It would be impossible to cover this up. You’d need to keep millions of people quiet. The scale of conspiracy this would take is impossible. Additionally, the preservatives in vaccines are the same that are used in nearly any medication. Vaccines are totally safe. Please stop with your “genetic arguments” relying on logical fallacies"
facepalm,fefevl4,t1_fefbci3,1579054847.0,"I’d like to see a study or scholarly report, or even a researched statistic that shows this is true"
facepalm,fefes1e,t1_fefatvb,1579054786.0,I’m a Republican. I supported Trump. I still do. I’m also a scientific person. I believe scientific fact. I plan on becoming a doctor. Scroll through my post history you’ll find all the stuff I’ve written in support of science. Antivaxx behavior is bipartisan. People on both sides of the political spectrum do it. Please stop politicizing a nonpolitical issue and insulting many people who did nothing wrong
facepalm,fefejic,t1_fef8rd8,1579054637.0,Yes. Just google “vaccination schedule studies”. You’ll find dozens on the first page
facepalm,fefegvx,t1_fef8dzw,1579054592.0,"Nobody messed with the antivaxxers data. They have no data. And the people who say you should vaxx aren’t government. It’s the people. It’s the kid in your daughters kindergarten class who has cancer. It’s your grandma who’s old. It’s your friend who needed a kidney transplant. It’s that little boy down the road who has immune system problems. We vaxx because these people can’t. We vaccinate to ensure they live. Because one day you will grow old and your immune system will start failing. And then you will thank god that so many people around you are vaccinated that these incredibly deadly diseases are hard to catch now and some have even died out. Also your argument that government says it and gov=bad therefore vaccine bad is a logical fallacy called a genetic argument. The problem is, it proves nothing. What should you do? You should vaxx, like every properly conducted research paper and all the evidence shows."
