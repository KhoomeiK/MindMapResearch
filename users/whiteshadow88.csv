holdmyfeedingtube,fek2c67,t1_fejyf3m,1579191117.0,"I agree in this situation (he fucked her up ina baaaad way she didn’t deserve), but just because a man is stronger doesnt mean there is never a case of self defense. Again, not here, this is horrible, but a blanket statement of “it’s not fair for men to fight women” sends the wrong message. It says, “hey ladies, we can be aggressive as we want and men can’t hit us back because we’re weaker and it’s not fair.” That’s wrong, if you engage in violence, don’t get sad when violence is engaged on you. Why can’t the message just be, no one hit anyone.

But again, let me be clear, that is NOT this sithation. I’m thinking of domestic abuse situations and actual threat. I don’t think this woman needed to get in the first hit for him to be justified in clocking her (there is no “must get punched first” rule for self defense), but my man had a ton of options here and he chose to give up self control."

 if they call 911 the police should come help them without cost. 24/7 RCMP protection is expensive and it is to the benefit ONLY 3 people. They can have regular old police for free, or they can pay for their own 24/7 365 security detail."

Validating feelings is a first step to understanding feelings. We validate the feelings we feel and then move on to deciding on to act on those feelings. That’s when we can learn how to control how we react and treat others when we feel those feelings in a healthy way.

Cropping floppy ears because you feel inconvenienced by regular cleaning is one of the laziest things I’ve heard someone say.

Don’t say some breeds HAVE to get it done. I have one of the breeds most prone to ear infections (Basset Hound) and cropping his ears was never suggested... regular cleaning was.

Basset Hounds have giant, gloriously floppy ears that are always getting dirty because they are low and shove their face into everything to sniff it. Their ears are notorious for infections so I clean them every Sunday. During particularly humid months I’ll do a Sunday and Thursday cleaning.  Ear infections aren’t a problem for my large seared dog because I clean them. Regular cleaning works for all breeds. It may be beneficial for working dogs, but for the convenience of ear cleaning... get out of here.

Uncle can do as he pleases, but I understand why one group of kids would struggle to be quiet while another wouldn’t. “My kid wouldn’t do that,” is a meaningless comparison."
AmItheAsshole,fcal1pr,t1_fcajdxv,1577571316.0,"I appreciate that. I agree, experiential learning is kind of how kids learn and grow best... I just also use the word dumb to describe the  child in the act.

I see how my “endearing” use of dumb is bothersome... but I don’t mean it in a bad way. Maybe it is inappropriate (and nasty) even in a well meaning way... I’ll have to really think on that. 

I will say, when a kid pops me in the face because he’s mad and doesn’t have the skills to cope with that anger, I don’t see a dumb and deficient person. I use those words, but I don’t see my kids negatively in the way they suggest... so maybe I shouldn’t use ‘em. 

Appreciate our back and forth. Heated, but you ended up making me think about the words I use... something I ask my kids to do. Also, good pun."
AmItheAsshole,fcaj2d8,t1_fcai7lu,1577570120.0,"Okay. If someone doesn’t know how to read, it is a deficiency. At any age. A 28 year old can be deficient at reading. A 2 year old can be deficient.

deficiency mean “a shortage,” not “an I learned skill.” I’m deficient in shit I haven’t learned... totally fine.

Having a deficiencies isn’t why they’re  dumb. having a brain that is still developing does. I’m not using dumb as an insult, and I certainly don’t call my kids dumb, but it’s an accurate descriptor of someone who looks at a hot coil, gets told not to touch it, and touches it anyways. The thing about kids is they develop out of that dumb and it’s lovely. Sometimes they become adult dumb, but sometimes they become good ol adults."
AmItheAsshole,fcai0wy,t1_fcah6j4,1577569586.0,"... what?! I recognize their intellectual deficiencies as kids... doesn’t mean they can’t also be brilliant. I literally called them brilliant and dumb. Children contain multitudes.

AmItheAsshole,fcagyed,t1_fcafi68,1577569059.0,"You clearly don’t know much about abused or emotionally troubled kids if you think they “*likely*” act dumb. They *likely* act quiet... but their brilliance is often still on display. 

How dare you say my kids aren’t “normal.” My kids are brilliant and 100% normal. But, as kids, they are still dumb and need help and guidance like every other child out there.

I bust my ass to learn about my kids. I talk to the psychologists on staff to understand their brain development and the related better ways to engage them. I educate myself so I am doing the best I can for them. Just because I recognize their intellectual abilities as children doesn’t mean I think they’re incapable of brilliance... it mean I recognize they still have limitations.

Don’t tell me I don’t know children when you’re talking about “normal” kids. Get your scare quotes the fuck out of here."

Kids are NOT smart. Jesus Christ, every weekend I look after my niece (just turned 4) I am astonished at how bright she is AND simultaneously how absolutely dumb she is. It’s not her fault, she’s 4. There is a reason you toddler proof shit... kids are dumb and don’t have the tools we have as adults. A 10 year old should not care for a 3 year old.

Edit: parents don’t need to hover and should accept their kid will get hurt... but it’s silly to say a 10 year old can handle a 3 year old."

triangle,fc75wxm,t3_egk3yh,1577498399.0,"Not a big religious person myself, but I have a bud who is a pastor at a church called Kindred based in the chapel hill/Durham area. It’s under the United Methodist’s, but they actively go against the United Methodists backwards stance on gay marriage. It’s relaxed and laid back. No dress code. Lots of young families. 

It is a newish church, so they share space with the United Methodist church in Chapel Hill... but if you don’t mind a smallish but growing group they are wonderful people.

I have only been to a few bible studies and services and I liked the community and vibe... the religious stuff just never stuck. The folks were totally cool with me being skeptical and no judgement when I stepped away. Still meet the preacher for a beer every once and a while.

KindredNC.church is the website. Again, not a regular or terribly religious... but they are good people."

It’s not a failure to use words, it’s taking some time to put words together. ESPECIALLY when you recognize your emotions are weirdly severe compared to the stimulus. When my mood goes wacky, I’m not going to explain it to you until I understand why the overreaction.

I’m not moving goal posts here. It’s relevant to the discussion  because that’s what the mother is doing. She is harming her kids  by making them feel they Only have shelter because the parents allow it. They aren’t a real part of the home because they don’t pay. It’s a shitty thing to do, and it’s fair to bring it up in a convo like this where we talk about the harm the mother is doing to get kids with her behavior.

She is making them feel unsafe by making them feel like they aren’t a part of the household. Her actions, described by her are horrible. That is why the mother is an ass, and deserves criticism."
