I thought I‚Äôd never want to adopt ever again! But then I saw a post about the little one - she was a 5 week lost kitten, hiding under a car and they were looking for a home for her. My husband and I just wanted to go see her and we fell in love! Right before we left, I saw Sunny, the orange one and he was the same age as my Spencer and looked exactly like him! I didn‚Äôt have the heart to leave without him too so I took them both home that day!"

cats,fdbqmz2,t1_fdbpysw,1578260394.0,"I‚Äôd understand him peeing and pooping on the floor if he is locked and has no access to his litter box, but him doing it in other rooms when he can use his toilet is an issue. Definitely see the vet, even if it‚Äôs tomorrow. Could be a kidney/bladder (UTI) issue? Could be anxiety? Only the vet will tell. Is there blood in his urine? If he refuses to eat and drink water, use a syringe because him not eating might weaken his immune system. Is he grooming himself too?"

IWantOut,fd759uh,t1_fd733iw,1578199606.0,"Oh, that makes sense! They do sound similar. Bulgarian is indeed very difficult. If you do visit, the majority of older people speak and understand Russian, while the younger generations know English. I believe you can easily get by with just English and no knowledge of Bulgarian!"
IWantOut,fd70vmx,t1_fd6zost,1578198089.0,"You mean in any school? Because that‚Äôs absolutely false. All of our classes are in Bulgarian, except for the language classes, like English, German etc. Unless he went to a Russian school where they all spoke Russian, I don‚Äôt know why he told you this. I do have a friend that went to a Russian high school, but it mainly focused on learning the language and I don‚Äôt believe all the subjects were taught in Russian."

IWantOut,fd39koi,t1_fd30zru,1578156044.0,"Sofia is very beautiful! I‚Äôve been there many times on different occasions, mostly concerts and soccer games. The city has 2 metro lines that can get you to any point of the city - you can go from the airport, to the central station, to downtown, so it‚Äôs very easy, and also cheap. Sofia is not too crowded. It‚Äôs surrounded by mountains so sometimes it‚Äôs a bit chilly, especially at night. I took my husband there a few years ago, he‚Äôs American, we visited some museums and many restaurants that serve traditional Bulgarian food (I personally think it‚Äôs the best food in the world but then again, I was raised there). People were very nice and polite to us. There are lots of stores, shopping centers and places you can have fun at. Hotels, restaurants and transportation are very affordable. I just love Sofia! And I really regret not going to college and settling there."
bulgaria,fd0bys2,t3_ejmygw,1578116659.0,"Hi! I think some of the best resorts, from what I‚Äôve heard, would be Pamporovo, Bansko and Borovets, and maybe Vitosha in Sofia. I know people who have been to all these places and they all loved it. Most ski seasons end in the beginning of April, so the dates you have should be good!"
IWantOut,fczxi4r,t1_fcztwnk,1578110314.0,"That‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs cheap and most foreigners can easily afford living there. Do you have any preferences? If you like the sea and beaches, I would recommend Varna or Burgas, but if you like the mountains and the fresh air, I‚Äôd totally recommend Smolyan! I think it‚Äôs the most beautiful city in Bulgaria and it close to Greece. Veliko Tarnovo is also beautiful and affordable. I‚Äôm mostly recommending bigger and more popular cities, because there would be more job opportunities for you. It‚Äôd be hard to find an English speaking job in smaller cities, unless you‚Äôre down to teaching English in high schools. I come from a small town and went to a high school for learning foreign languages, where most of my teachers were foreigners. I know it might be a bit more expensive to live in a bigger city but it wouldn‚Äôt be that bad. 

Honestly, if I ever go back to Bulgaria, I‚Äôd pick Sofia. So many job opportunities, so many things to do. I know my people are leaving and choosing to work abroad, but the country is getting better and better."
