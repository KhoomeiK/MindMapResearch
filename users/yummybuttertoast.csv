They never anticipated or prepared for the possibility in that we would elect scores of them. They never prepared for the uniquely gifted piece of shit that is Mitch McConnell.  They never anticipated the creation of this hyper-partisan two-party system where one party's leadership can crack a whip over the others and control the entire government with absolutely no respect for the constitution, its laws, its principles, or the American people. 

It's time for a new constitution."
worldnews,fd6d25m,t1_fd6a8l3,1578189115.0,I'm certain that killing Solameini was discussed on Trump's call with Putin on December 25. The call that we only know about because the Kremlin disclosed it. The US would not flirt with war in Iran unless we had assurances that Russia would stay out of it

worldnews,fcx7h65,t1_fcwtdhx,1578054331.0,"Honestly, it was a ruthless, dangerous, but brilliant political move. The Democrats have no choice but to back off of impeachment. If they keep beating that bush while potential war looms voters will see it as partisan political games, and they’ll rally behind the president. This was his trump card (heh) and if he plays it right he may have a shot at reelection, terrifying as that may be.

It’s almost a win win situation. If it escalates to war, then that’s likely to benefit him. And if they don’t continue to escalate, then trump will be perceived as the president that punished Iran and brought them to heel. It’ll be interesting to see if he cuts back on the Twitter shitposting, or if he blunders the advantage he’s given himself."

politics,fcwpkvy,t3_ej95ak,1578032726.0,"There's no way to dress it up - this is an act of war against a sovereign nation, and without any congressional approval or even notification. I have no idea what Iran's next move will be, and even if not a full blown war I believe they will seek retribution.

But I have to say that as a political move, this was damn cunning. Ruthless... but brilliant. Trump saw inevitable loss in 2020 and he played his biggest hand

The Democrats have no choice but to back off of impeachment. If they continue beating the drum and burning the fire, they're in trouble in 2020. The American people believe in uniting and rallying as one nation, behind the President, when potential war is looming on the horizon, regardless of the circumstances that got us there. Pelosi and Schumer haven't issued a statement yet because they have to be very careful of criticizing Trump right now, lest they risk alienating voters and appearing hellbent on partisan political games.

He flipped the tables on them, and as long as he refrains from his constant shitposting on Twitter and lets his people do the work for him, he'll stay in charge of this narrative. The Democrats have no choice but to give up on hoping for a fair trial from the Senate, because McConnell's response will just be ""How dare you, when there is something so much more important at large.""

This also makes Trump's recent, undisclosed phone call with Putin that much more interesting. Would the US really attack Iran without assurances that Russia, their biggest ally, would stay out of it? I'm sure 4 more years of Trump would be at the top of Putin's wish list for next Christmas, and this stands a chance of tipping that balance heavily. We already know that it's not beneath our President to invite foreign leaders to lend him a hand if it means reelection."

If anything the PD is a bit of an ass. He put him on the spot, and then when the kid turned an awkward moment into one where he got to show off his passion he was cold about it. If I was that guy I wouldn't want to be part of a program where the PD has an attitude like magic is lame and it's cool to make fun of nerdy hobbies."

todayilearned,fbx5y00,t1_fbx4fqg,1577170765.0,"I’m a Med student, this is not true. 

The basic explanation is you have red blood cells that have TONS of markers on them called antigens - and different people have different antigens. For example, some people might have just A, or just B, or both (AB), or neither (O). 

Your body uses the ones you have to recognize that they’re yours and does not attack them. But for the ones you don’t have, your immune system sees them as foreign and makes antibodies against them to destroy them. 

This is why AB people, who have both A and B antigens, are the “universal recipient” - they never made antibodies. Conversely, O people have neither A nor B antigens, making their red blood cells safe for anyone. 

But the ABO system is just the broadest classification of these markers - there are many many many more markers that all work exactly like this. To be technical, some are very rare and some are more immunogenic than others. 

The biggest group of these other antigens are called Rh antigens, and the major immunogenic and important antigen is called Rh-d. If you have the Rh-d antigen, this is what “positive” means. Hence, O negative is the universal donor and AB positive the universal recipient. 

But like I said, there are many more antigens on red cells. Even O- people who lack A, B, and Rh-d still have many other antigens on their surface. These aren’t usually mentioned because they’re so common or they’re not highly immunogenic. 

In order to be safe in the hospital blood products are always tested using “type and cross.” Type = determine the major antigen composition. 
Cross = cross match - mix a sample of the patients blood with the donors blood in a vial and watch for “agglutination,” or clotting. If there’s no clotting then it’s safe.

So in the very interesting case discussed in the article, the immune system in somebody with no antigens at all will find every antigen on a donated cell foreign, making it difficult to find safe donor blood."
