AmItheAsshole,ffcev7m,t1_ffc9tdm,1579797957.0,That’s actually funny you say that because he’s mentioned that before! He hadn’t taken into account that I like to play games almost as much as he does lol.
AmItheAsshole,ffceqn7,t1_ffc0s0d,1579797881.0,"This has been the only pain point we have. In discussing it with another commenter we figured it was his entitlement to my time coming out, he said it’s always been an issue with his exes so he makes it a point to not be like that with me but these seem to be the instances where he can’t hold himself back."
AmItheAsshole,ffceleh,t1_ffbvstu,1579797789.0,"Yeah I thought that phrasing was over and I kept asking him what moment. 

In this instance no, he didn’t want to have sex. We’re pretty open about that he will just straight up ask “can we do it?” If he wants to. I also know that isn’t the case because he had picked up his sister so she was downstairs while all this was going on."
AmItheAsshole,ffceaqn,t1_ffbu8xe,1579797605.0,"That’s a good way to explain it, yeah a tiff :)"
AmItheAsshole,ffce4q0,t1_ffbuifm,1579797502.0,I’m responding and having a discussion. If I filled in all the details the post would be way too long. It was his phrasing for eating together. Had we had a plan or he said prior to coming home he wanted me to eat with him downstairs I would be downstairs.
AmItheAsshole,ffcdyb1,t1_ffbw8vo,1579797392.0,"I stated above sometimes he doesn’t care, sometimes he tells me to keep playing, and sometimes he joins me. It’s very random when he gets mad about it."
AmItheAsshole,ffbclw2,t1_ffbbrgd,1579759737.0,Well that is how about 98% of our nights are. It’s super rare for me to be home before him to even come home to me playing games. So this isn’t our norm. I think I’m going to implement a kind of checklist where we both make sure to ask the other before they get home if they want the other to spend time/be off the game when we get home. That way even though I don’t care we both can be held to the same standard and not feel bad if we ask the other to get off.
me_irl,ffbcge2,t1_ffbbjjy,1579759567.0,"But what you’re eating is an unfertilized egg, so it isn’t technically a baby either."
AmItheAsshole,ffbalyk,t1_ffbahcq,1579757590.0,"Yeah I will talk with him when he’s done hanging out with his sister and see if we can try to have a phone checklist where we ask the other if we want them to be off the game when we get home, that way we’re both accountable and both have the option. Because even though I don’t care I can’t always expect that from him so maybe that could help to stop the spontaneous combustion lol"
AmItheAsshole,ffbagxw,t1_ffbac5v,1579757417.0,Lol right?! THATS WHY IM SO CONFUSED BY IT haha
AmItheAsshole,ffbae2a,t1_ffba3q3,1579757306.0,Thanks for the input. :) I appreciate it.
AmItheAsshole,ffba6fd,t1_ffb9rhn,1579757041.0,Lol yes it isn’t cute but it is manageable! Trust definitely has a play in it and just reassurance from your partner that they’re there for you. I think in the moment he doesn’t feel that which is why he lashes out.
AmItheAsshole,ffba4qb,t1_ffb9rhn,1579756977.0,"Honestly we talk TOO much all day every day, unless of course we’re super busy at work which is understandable. But we will text and just say “call when you have a chance” or “can you step out and call me” if something pressing happens. But if we don’t get to it during the work day we usually talk about it on the phone while I’m driving home or we’ll explicitly say we wanna talk about it in person."
AmItheAsshole,ffba1f4,t1_ffb9qv1,1579756851.0,"We have had heated discussions where I’ve been very aggressive about the fact that I will not be walking on eggshells as that’s the easiest way to hate your partner, we both had to be like that with our exes and don’t want that for us. This is why we never hold on to previous arguments and we don’t fight for long. If we’re angry and the other person even makes a slight effort to be nice we both have to drop it."
AmItheAsshole,ffb9v19,t1_ffb9jhz,1579756613.0,"We actually talk emotionally almost daily. That’s why this situation is so confusing to me. We’ve made a lot of progress emotionally since being together and both have become much better versions of ourselves. With hearing responses I think I’m going to make it a point to try and ask him before he gets home in these situations if he’d like me to be off my game or if he wanted to do something. It will take me time to get in that habit but I’d think he would be receptive to it.

Edit to add: I have no idea if we’d ever post our songs, they’re just fun little lyrics we write to beats we find. His buddy came up and we recorded a few fun ones we just wrote that day so maybe if any of them turn out decent I’ll post one up :)"
AmItheAsshole,ffb9phb,t1_ffb9i33,1579756433.0,I always offer to/just get off when he gets home. We talk both on our way to and from work. We talk every night and have very real conversations with each other and we do other activities. We’re great at communicating but this one thing is just never communicated right. Sometimes he will give me a heads up to be off my game if I’m playing (sometimes he’ll ask me to be even when I’m not playing something) but sometimes he doesn’t. Another comment I asked if I should make it a point in my conversations with him to always ask if I’m playing if I should be off and that I wouldn’t be upset with his answer. I’d hope he would be receptive to that it would just be a matter of remembering.
AmItheAsshole,ffb9ht7,t1_ffb9b0v,1579756161.0,"It’s SUPER random. Where it won’t happen for months even if the situation (me playing games when he gets home from wherever) happens multiple times. He just seems to be more mad about it quicker than he used to be. He has admitted he has always had a weird kind of entitlement to my time that he’s had to work on so I feel maybe these moments are when that entitlement slips through?

Edit: clarification"
AmItheAsshole,ffb9day,t1_ffb9ag3,1579755996.0,"Yeah and he says that after his 5 minute cool down but I just don’t know how to try to be proactive about it. Maybe I should make a habit of calling him when I know he’s on his way and just straight up asking, let him know that I won’t be mad at his response? I’m sure he’d be receptive I’d just have to work on remembering to ask."
AmItheAsshole,ffb9a59,t1_ffb91rg,1579755883.0,"We’re very much home bodies. We never leave and don’t like leaving. We do a lot of other house things together like baking, yard work, or well write songs together or practice our instruments. Gaming is both of our main hobbies though. 

We also always talk to each other on the phone and the way to and from work. Our relationship is honestly INCREDIBLE he’s just unpredictable with this and my attention."
AmItheAsshole,ffb969k,t1_ffb8s8m,1579755760.0,"I had touched on the fact that usually if it’s important he will give me a heads up that he wants to do something when he gets home, or he’ll ask me to get off before he gets home so we can do something. 

He doesn’t stay angry for more than 5 minutes but I do stay sad, because in the moment I’m happy and then suddenly unhappy for something unexpected. I’m not a mind reader and it’s hard with the inconsistency since sometimes he will be fine, sometimes he’ll tell me to get off prior, sometimes he gets mad and doesn’t tell me to so it’s really up in the air for me and I just can’t predict where it’s gonna land. Unless I know he had a bad day in that case I’ll usually make sure I’m just watching something calm downstairs for when he comes home."
AmItheAsshole,ffb8wyb,t1_ffb8i7b,1579755494.0,"I do love the sims for the pausing reason, I’m pretty Simmed out ATM lol. 

This instance he was actually really excited about his work because he loves it (his last company was legit a nightmare) and I made sure to always be there and listen, I’d just shut my whole console off if he got home and I was in something. But he’s also been unemployed for the last 3 weeks, and playing games for 6+ hours a day and this was the first day I’d been off work early."
AmItheAsshole,ffb8q70,t1_ffb8ig0,1579755278.0,"So during the week ,as we work full time, we don’t play daily, if we do we usually will play for at least an hour so we can have dinner and wind down and just watch something together. 

On weekends we will sometimes spend the entire weekend playing games either together or different games but we’ll be in a party together if we’re not in the same room. 

So I would say during the week, max 5 hours. 
Weekends will be high but only if we’re both gaming."
AmItheAsshole,ffb8m24,t1_ffb8ffw,1579755137.0,"I guess I shouldn’t say that we heavily game. We don’t play every day it’s more like when we do play we like to dedicate at least an hour during the week or some weekend we’ll waste the whole day playing games. My fault for not clarifying the habits a bit better. 

If we want to play together we usually just wait for the other to finish the match their in."
AmItheAsshole,ffb8he3,t1_ffb8bhd,1579754980.0,"I guess what I fail to explain is it is different every time. Had this been the default every time I was playing games I’d pay better attention and wouldn’t be when he comes home. Sometimes it’s fine, sometimes he joins, sometimes he gets angry. 

And he was not picking us up a pizza, I had eaten pizza before leaving work which made him want pizza and I was not hungry."
AmItheAsshole,ffb892g,t1_ffb846g,1579754723.0,"He says these whenever I talk to him while I play because he knows he can’t play and concentrate while I talk to him. 

What information do you need, I’d be happy to explain more from either side. Keep in mind this was not a fight or causes any fights. He gets mad in the moment, makes me sad, then apologizes 5 minutes later generally."
AmItheAsshole,ffb84ie,t1_ffb7u9y,1579754603.0,"No fights. He just gets mad, I get sad, he leaves the room, 5 minutes later he apologizes and we never hold on to it."
AmItheAsshole,ffb7s3y,t1_ffb7lw2,1579754257.0,"We don’t argue about anything. This isn’t even an argument, it was him getting mad and me not expecting it. He was over it after about 5 minutes but I’m more wondering if it’s normal for that to be expected of your SO."
AmItheAsshole,ffb7p2k,t1_ffb7eig,1579754170.0,"When I do what? I don’t get mad at him for playing games. And I always get off when he gets home, whether it’s conveniently after my match ends with perfect timing or I finish it after he gets in. Unless he tells me not to or he joins me, as I said."
AmItheAsshole,ffb7lau,t1_ffb76k0,1579754052.0,"No, he still games more than me. He is a higher level than me on everything we play together. I will admit he plays more games than me, like he plays a lot of time investment games like Ark or Red Dead."

Depending on the device there might MIGHT be a backup if you have that sort of thing. My old android used to constantly bring back deleted convos (idk about individual texts as I just deleted junk and group texts).

I don’t think you need to start talking about child support yet, girl fucked up FOR SURE. I don’t know if you’d want to like call her bluff and tell her you can retrieve what was deleted and tell her to come clean so you don’t have to see it. If you stay together moving forward she would have to greatly rebuild your trust, my ex used to do dumb shit and got caught and each time he’d try to find a sneakier way to do it. 

I also don’t think it’s fair for her to bring up you watching porn or checking out cleavage because yeah like you said, those are people you’ll have any further contact with. But maybe try a couples counselor, she likely doesn’t see that she’s as wrong as she is for it and an unbiased opinion could help to ensure it doesn’t happen again."

My heart goes out to her because now you give her the purse and instead of happiness and appreciation she will be met with sadness and guilt. And that’s all she will think of while using it. You are so dense and need to seriously reevaluate your priorities. I’m glad you included your frivolous hobby spending because that whole time before I was thinking she was in the wrong if you were tight on money. 

I’ve been her in similar situations and the heartbreak you feel, not because you don’t get something you wanted, but from being shot down for what was likely stressful for her to ask and that she probably saw as reasonable. Better buy her some nice flowers and make her dinner too, you big jerk."
