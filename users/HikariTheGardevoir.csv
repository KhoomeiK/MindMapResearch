On the complete opposite side of the scale, I never made any of these mistakes but I couldn't parse to save my life in school.

>It is also striking that he says correctly that in Dutch pronouns do make a distinction in case, but mentions the one case where the normative grammar makes a completely artificial distinction between accusative and dative that no one, really no one adheres to in spoken language, and many people not even in written language.

Except for this. I still have trouble telling these two apart and I still occasionally have to look them up while writing a formal letter."
