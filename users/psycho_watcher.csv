notmycat,ff5xzen,t1_ff5ah86,1579613914.0,"On freezing nights buy a pack or two of Hot Hands or Hot Feet warmers. Most stores carry them to put into gloves or boots. Or take socks, fill with rice and nuke for a few minutes. Put them into a foam cooler with the opening faced as away from the wind as possible. If it is under the house that should help block some  wind. You can put a (or a few) old towel, old shirt, old pants or whatever inside as well to add to comfort and warmth as well as help for the insulation. 

Also, tell a local rescue you have a few porch kitties and they might be able to help with getting you some supplies like coolers or even food."

She saw it on a shelf and have a lot of succulents, lucky bamboos, and pothos that I grow outside on my balcony. I have brought them all in due to a few close to freezing nights and storms that knock them over. I have nothing that flowers really, I kill them or the aphids in the area do. (I have tried ladybugs and other bugs as well as sprays.) I even destroyed Sunflowers, well a bunch of birds did. 

I just don't have luck with flowering plants. LOL

A friend was at the store saw this, had no clue what it was and brought it to me so my balcony would have color. Like I said, it took a week and you see what I did to the poor thing. LO

Yeah, put it out once the sun comes back and let it pass.

Thank you for the help and for a little less guilt with this one."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_prisons#Canada

Some prisons have computers in the library but they are not connected to the internet. 

There is a push to change that 

""The article from the former prisoner makes five practical recommendations for improvement: more support for teachers and teaching; more options in what and how students learn; stronger incentives for students to work hard and make progress; build on the skills prisoners already have; and provide some degree of internet access.""

http://johnhoward.ca/blog/problems-education-canadian-prisons/

People do sneak in smartphones and prisoners can access the internet that way but usually, they are sneaking in little bits, not really able to post or surf for any real amount of time. That is why twitter is popular with people in prison.

Most prisoners use people outside to post for them. Joseph Duncan is a great example of that with his blogs.
