Im not sure if the ""off"" feeling is just me being a ""newbie"" or if it's my injury making my hamstring tight? Does my butt go down too far or am I crazy?"

I can totally see someone stumbling across this sub and getting all weird and turned around by such a /gahstly/ post. Either that or a really angry bisexual hyperfeminist that really felt that men's opinions matter on a lesbian sub.

Yeah, I'm not squatting wide enough, man. I'm going to deload and try squatting way wider (to me) than I have and see if I can't get my dang hips at parallel."
xxfitness,feyn7qt,t1_fewrqda,1579447870.0,Thank you! I really appreciate this. I'm going to look into the people you suggested :) I've saved this post for when I feel icky about it again.
xxfitness,feymvq6,t1_fex6m3d,1579447722.0,"I had a lot of trauma to my lower back and hips two years ago. Ever since, I've had a hard time with bending down without my back curving.

Front squats are better, but I still have the same issue with ""butt wink""."
xxfitness,fewk00k,t1_fewhyyq,1579412258.0,"That's fair. I'm not very good at explaining myself because I don't have a lot of the vocabulary. My bad.

Even with an empty bar, box squats really threw off my balance and I felt like I was being pulled backwards. Instead, I'm going to start with a band wrapped around the squat rack and spend some good quality time in an ATG Position to get some mobility back. After that do a few more progressions before getting into box squats. Like I said, you're not wrong at all and I'm sorry if I made it seem like I didn't appreciate your suggestion."
xxfitness,fewh7en,t1_fewcmjw,1579410528.0,"I'd rather lose strength and gain form, to be honest. I tried squatting over a box and can literally not reach it even without weight. Better for me to do body weight squats for eight weeks to get my mobility back than topple over a box with extra weight dragging me down.

However, if you have the mobility, this is great advice! Def the first step I took when troubleshooting."

aww,fe40v9l,t1_fe0iq8a,1578854674.0,"I got a large bird cage, wrapped it with chicken wire so they couldn't squeeze through the bars, and made my own platforms and ""sleeping bags"" out of sealed wood planks and fleece fabric. I filled the bottom with that paper bedding because it was cheap and easy to clean up. They like to have levels to jump around on and places to burrow and sleep together.

I had at least one rat out almost all the time while I was home. They would just sit on me and run around my desk and stuff for hours. They can be very loving. They can keep each other company, though. That's why you get at least two.

Also, I do not reccomend those balls people put rodents in. I just don't like them. Rat proof a room so they can't get out of reach from you and just keep them in there."
aww,fe06u87,t1_fe057nr,1578804569.0,"Would rats are nearly impossible to tame. They're trained from birth by the colony to behave a certain way. Domesticated rats are inbred as all hell, too. They're are drawbacks to both types. However, you would be hard pressed to find a happy and content wild rat as opposed to a domesticated rat. If you're having any heaistance to rats, look into domesticated mice. They're nicer but smaller and have slightly different dietary needa"
aww,fe031ko,t1_fdzqcj2,1578801823.0,"Hi, I'm drunk and love rats.

So yeah, you want a rat. First things first, learn about their diet and behavior. Secondly, buy a large bird cage. Thridly, spend like. . .$900? On platforms, sleeping ""holes"" and sacks. Fourthly, cry, because they only live around 2-4 years. Fifthly, find some rats that can't breed because they're prolific at breeding."
aww,fe02k4d,t3_enfkv1,1578801473.0,"Hi I'm too drunk for this video, but I wanted to let anyone who reads this know that rats are great pets. They're so smart and silly, also very particular. They're cute little hands touching your face as they give ""kisses"" is the most heartwarming thing I've ever felt in my life. They're clean, sweet, smart, and genuinely the greatest 2 ish years you will ever have. All it takes is a decent enclosure and some basic knowledge of dietary needs and you've got a best friend you will love forever.

RIP Buttler and Frankie. You were my two good boys"

xxfitness,fdl3kbj,t1_fdl1j6m,1578516460.0,"I've never done the roll of shame. Is it more complicated than it looks? I have bailed out of squats and deadlifts, but never bench."
xxfitness,fdl2t9s,t1_fdl1wiu,1578516094.0,"I do my feet a little more than shoulder width apart because if they're close together my knees track outward. I have the bar kinda in between low and high. I do bend forward a bit but the bar is over my mid foot the entire time. It really just feels like I can't go that extra inch or two down for parallel. I'm a little shaky in the bar but I've never lost balance. 90lbs is 90lbs, ya know?

When I do ATG squats without weight, I kinda fall backward. Idk if that adds some context to my balance/strength."
xxfitness,fdkwczw,t3_eloqh8,1578512519.0,"I have a few questions.

1) What could be the cause of me not being able to go to parallel when squatting? Is it something like poor hip mobility? I can squat below parallel with just body weight, but as soon as I have a bar on me it just feels. . .awkward? 

2) DAE use the Smith machine to bench? I never have a spotter and I don't want to get a bar to the throat. I've noticed it kinda strains my pec/shoulder more when benching. Is there a grip placement I can do to adapt to the Smith machine better?"

fuckeatingdisorders,fdf0vk0,t3_el0vtm,1578350785.0,I buy frozen vegetables and binge on those. I don't eat as much of them as I would something like pizza or sandwiches. A big bowl of steamed vegetables is always a good thing. Just remember to only eat 2 cups at a time to prevent purging and/or expanding your stomach too much
WeListenToYou,fdeyy19,t3_ekll3r,1578349578.0,"You are completely valid in this struggle. In fact, it's very common.

My experience with this was that I was just like you in having different standards. I felt trapped because nothing was getting done the way I needed it to be done, but at the same time I couldn't do everything all the time.

My solution was A) realizing that things are allowed to be 99% or even 75% done. No one is going to come to your house, knowing your ill, and judge you because there's dust in some random corner, or your clothes aren't sorted properly. It literally does not matter right now. And B) understanding that I had infanalized my spouse had not taken the time to teach them how to do things. How were they supposed to know everything that needed to be done without me telling them? Responding with patience and empathy always worked out better for the both of us.

Now, if *he* complains to you about things not getting done while your sick? Oh hell no."

mildlyinfuriating,fd2x50o,t1_fd2tz11,1578152511.0,"Bruh, it's reccomended that you clean them *in* the shower, provided you don't have a medical condition that doesn't allow them to drain (restricted ear canals, meniers disease etc)

The water pressure of *most* showers is gentle enough to swoop in there and get the majority of the wax out. Then you use some tissue on your pinkie once your out of the shower to get out the remaining wax.

But either way, stop using cotton swabs in your ears."
