I'll stop you right there by reminding us all of the dramatically higher rates of male suicide then female. Male mental health is currently in a terrible state in America.

>Who do female incels (and there are female incels) have?

I'm not trying to discount their struggle, I see no reason their struggle cannot be coexistent with the male struggle. But they are helped by positive messaging about body positivity and female independence, social messages that tell them it's okay.

No one is telling young men it's okay. All they get is a stiff pat on the back and told to have some balls."

Also, let's not forget that there is support for women in this MeToo era, but there is little to no support for men, especially those that are not attractive, or strong, or successful.
