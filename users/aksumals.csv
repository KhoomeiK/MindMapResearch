Before I get started, let me be clear that while I breed Berger Blanc Suisse (White Swiss Shepherd) dogs, my first dog was a White German Shepherd whom I loved greatly.  I think all of these breeds can make great dogs. You might want to check out my blog article: Is Berger Blanc Suisse (White Swiss Shepherd) Right for Me?

Berger Blanc Suisse is recognized by FCI in Europe, the White German Shepherd is recognized by the AKC (although the color is disqualified for show) and the White Shepherd is recognized by UKC.  Having said that, there is a lot of overlap in the history and characteristics of the dogs.

Moose are creatures of solitude* so there is no herd name for them. It’s simply moose. 

I wouldn’t say moose are aggressive... but they aren’t not aggressive... if that makes sense. 

They are kind of like strong idiots. They get scared easily and stomp things, so majority of the time you don’t want to be anywhere near them. 

[Some cute moose facts:](http://www.cutemoose.net/moose_facts.htm) In one leap most can clear over 3m/10ft. Males are* 840lbs-1500lbs (381-680kg) and females are 440lb-790lb (199-353kg) so they crush things easily. 

There *are* two guaranteed aggressive types of moose: a mother with her baby and a teenage / bull moose in mating season (sept/oct). 

The video posted looks like a curious bull but I wouldn’t want to risk anything and would probably attempt to hide as well.

Though I think it’s worth noting: if that moose wanted in the trash area I’m fairly confident it could easily crush that door/room.

Secondly regarding smoking: there is a legal ban in a lot of states of any smoke of any kind indoors (obviously if you burn your dinner it’s different :p).   
So there could be legal fines from the police but also “property damage” fees from the property owner. The first step of taking someone to small claims court is establishing that you’ve requested payment before taking them to court.

[Here](https://health.usnews.com/health-care/for-better/articles/the-hpv-vaccine-for-men?context=amp) is more information but you really should consult your doctor or registered nurse and it should be covered by all insurance companies. If you don’t have insurance there are STD prevention centers that offer for free or discounted based on your income."
quityourbullshit,fcwycc4,t1_fcwxt93,1578042903.0,"First, I only agreed to discuss. Negotiations are a back and forth and while I said “I was down for that” that simply means “I am interesting in talking further”. 

English is so challenging because one word can mean many many things and syntax is critical (hence your attempt at GOTEM) but to be clear I did not say mill as in grain but mill as in the Old French, milion, or from the earlier Old Italian: milione, an intensification of the Latin word, mille, a thousand. 

That is, a million is a big thousand, much as a great gross is a dozen gross or 12 × 144 = 1728.

Nice try satan"

I think in this situation my small town knew the bad man would “get away with it” (his mental disability was almost a pass in a sense.

Regarding the other children: my mom has escaped my step-dad by the time we heard about the additional victims so I’m not sure what happened there."

trashy,fcolivh,t1_fcok5x5,1577835255.0,"Good grief. You come off as Napoleon-type-aggression. It's completely unnecessary in a forum, much less this entire thread. 

Since this seems to matter to you: I am an Alaskan woman also. both points are irrelevant to this conversation. 

Just like laws, culture, etc are so different in Nome, vs Fairbank, vs Anchorage, vs Kodiak ... It's same in the states. 

Alaska is simply a conservative (ie low/minimal government) nomadic and independent state; therefore certain guardrails are placed on the government to ensure residents' freedoms... 

FYI: the same laws apply for majority rural areas in the lower 48 as well. Alaska is essentially considered just one giant rural area... AKA the last frontier.

AdviceAnimals,fcob7l9,t1_fcnsgml,1577827987.0,"I don’t have children but my observation is it’s similar to how wealth amplifies existing characteristics.   

Both the negative and the positive.   
So if you’re an asshole generally but a fiercely loyal friend... wealth can exaggerate both aspects.

So it seems with children and relationships: that the love you have for each other amplifies, but also grievances and reactions."

While the man was awaiting the trial in jail... my alcoholic step-dad purposely got himself arrested and beat the shit out of him.

Unfortunately it seemed to help the defense claim the man “couldn’t go to prison or he’d be killed” and while I agree he shouldn’t be killed for what he did to me... he went on to do it to four more children and I absolutely think castration should be a punishment for certain sex crimes."
