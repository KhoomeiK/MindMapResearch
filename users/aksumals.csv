Berger Blanc Suisse is recognized by FCI in Europe, the White German Shepherd is recognized by the AKC (although the color is disqualified for show) and the White Shepherd is recognized by UKC.  Having said that, there is a lot of overlap in the history and characteristics of the dogs.

Moose are creatures of solitude* so there is no herd name for them. It‚Äôs simply moose. 

I wouldn‚Äôt say moose are aggressive... but they aren‚Äôt not aggressive... if that makes sense. 

They are kind of like strong idiots. They get scared easily and stomp things, so majority of the time you don‚Äôt want to be anywhere near them. 

[Some cute moose facts:](http://www.cutemoose.net/moose_facts.htm) In one leap most can clear over 3m/10ft. Males are* 840lbs-1500lbs (381-680kg) and females are 440lb-790lb (199-353kg) so they crush things easily. 

There *are* two guaranteed aggressive types of moose: a mother with her baby and a teenage / bull moose in mating season (sept/oct). 

The video posted looks like a curious bull but I wouldn‚Äôt want to risk anything and would probably attempt to hide as well.

Though I think it‚Äôs worth noting: if that moose wanted in the trash area I‚Äôm fairly confident it could easily crush that door/room.

English is so challenging because one word can mean many many things and syntax is critical (hence your attempt at GOTEM) but to be clear I did not say mill as in grain but mill as in the Old French, milion, or from the earlier Old Italian: milione, an intensification of the Latin word, mille, a thousand. 

That is, a million is a big thousand, much as a great gross is a dozen gross or 12 √ó 144 = 1728.

trashy,fcolivh,t1_fcok5x5,1577835255.0,"Good grief. You come off as Napoleon-type-aggression. It's completely unnecessary in a forum, much less this entire thread. 

Since this seems to matter to you: I am an Alaskan woman also. both points are irrelevant to this conversation. 

Just like laws, culture, etc are so different in Nome, vs Fairbank, vs Anchorage, vs Kodiak ... It's same in the states. 

Alaska is simply a conservative (ie low/minimal government) nomadic and independent state; therefore certain guardrails are placed on the government to ensure residents' freedoms... 

FYI: the same laws apply for majority rural areas in the lower 48 as well. Alaska is essentially considered just one giant rural area... AKA the last frontier.

Unfortunately it seemed to help the defense claim the man ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt go to prison or he‚Äôd be killed‚Äù and while I agree he shouldn‚Äôt be killed for what he did to me... he went on to do it to four more children and I absolutely think castration should be a punishment for certain sex crimes."
