TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fezxv3s,t3_er0o77,1579463111.0,"As a guy, I’d like tell you that if a guy is about to have sex with you, he already has a pretty good idea about what’s underneath. If you’re a little on the plus side, he knows there will likely be a little extra of you here and there. If you’re really thin, he knows there may be some ribs and hip bones. He’s likely already seen you with clothes on, talked to you, and spent time with you and has become pretty set in his decision to go further; if you guys have made it all the way to having sex, then being able to see and touch those beautiful curves will be like making his dreams come true. 

Also, if a guy is turned on, there is a nearly zero percent chance he’s going to walk away from sex.

A tip for looking good during sexy time: have the lights dimmed, not totally dark, just dimmed really low. Total dark is fun sometimes and you can start that way for the first few times until your comfortable. Everyone can look sexy in low lighting!

I hope a little perspective from the other side of things helps.

Adoption,fesfw1q,t1_fesagln,1579364750.0,"I hate that Im not alone, but I’m glad I’m not alone. I feel like my mother (adoptive) doesn’t even think of me that much anymore now that I have kids and she keeps trying to live out these weird scenarios with them, like she can’t wait to take our son to McDonalds so he can have chicken nuggets even though she knows we don’t eat fast food. “But yall loved it when you were kids!” or “I mean they’re going to have it eventually”. I sense that she is incredibly insecure about her age (65) and ability to “still be mom” (much like so many women from that generation for whatever reason) which is such a big reason why talking with her about my biological mother seems like such a bad idea. I agree with your logic about keeping the good parts in your life, but she lets so much toxicity from her insecurities and constant habit of being manipulative that being around her is tolerable only for a certain period of time. I just don’t know whats up with that generation, I don’t feel like many of them age well.

TL;DR: I hate this is such a common issue with that generation of moms being insecure and manipulative."
