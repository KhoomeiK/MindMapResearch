NYGiants,ff94e6g,t1_ff91tzx,1579704569.0,"Only reasons I wouldn’t take Golden are that he’s possibly too expensive after a solid year on a shit defense.

And also the fact that the shit defense in question was our defense which will be under a new scheme next year which probably won’t suit him.

musicproduction,ff5gnkx,t1_ff5ghmp,1579592031.0,"I struggle writing melodies and making my chord structure more complex (i.e. more than just basic transitions - cadences, harmonies, suspensions, resolutions and modulations) to fit the approach I want to take. Nothing wrong with trying to use theory rules in writing is there? The problem I have is that I take it further than necessary by accident and overcomplicate it for myself because the way I learned to play music and the way I learned theory were disconnected, not entirely parallel."
musicproduction,ff5flx5,t3_erm37p,1579590741.0,"The problem I have is that whenever I try to make music using theory, I trip over myself time and time again working out if something is actually following the rules abd standards I set. I love music theory but it’s not a productive aid in my writing. The most I will settle on is a key, scale and chord structure. 

I won’t delve deep into harmonisation because I never played piano to a degree where I could just see complex chords on a piano roll or virtual keyboard. This is where I trip over myself and I overcomplicate the boundaries of classical ‘rules’ and spend more time working out if what I have written follows them, rather than if it purely sounds correct and pleasing to the ear. I’m considering shifting my application more to analysis, working out what I’ve done afterwards harmonically rather than building up my harmony directly using theory.

I definitely don’t consider myself above theory, absolutely not. It’s a complex beast that I will likely never have a true enough grasp on to use as a tool effectively in my writing."

I think if you buy online and it feels off you should take it to a tech to be checked over if it wasn’t checked at the dealer you bought from. Like I say mine came from Andertons with excellent playability, spot on intonation and good action.

It goes to be said, if you buy online, make sure it’s checked over by a tech (much like they do at Andertons) otherwise the setup could be off purely from transit and things like humidity and pressure changes."

NYGiants,fep1z9r,t1_feoz4zg,1579310340.0,"No. It’s a sensible hire and makes sense when you lay out the facts.

Garrett is successful at OC. He is good at developing younger talent and has consistently led strong offenses.

He gets a bad rep because he’s not a good enough leader to take the Cowboys any further than the divisional round, but honestly, I can’t see McCarthy doing any better either whilst Jerry still has the final say over anything that goes in Arlington."
NYGiants,fep1o9b,t1_feoyxt6,1579310148.0,"Twitter is the worst for it right now. Everyone’s thinking he’ll be Garrett the mediocre HC whereas he’s not in a HC role, he’s in the OC role from which he helped make that Cowboys offense top 5 and consistently top 10 thereafter."

NYGiants,fek63d5,t1_fek5nf7,1579193384.0,"Is it not often the case that the HC calls offensive plays anyway? Especially an ex QB and OC like Garrett. Besides, Garrett has been on the Giants’ roster before (‘00-‘03) and Callahan has spent more time coaching elsewhere than with the Cowboys.

You could argue we were rebuilding the Pats staff too. Just because two of our coaching targets are formerly of the Cowboys doesn’t mean we’re rebuilding their staff."
NYGiants,fek55im,t1_fejzdfb,1579192824.0,Please. Anyone is better than -that- (HH) guy currently at OL Coach. Callahan would be an awesome signing. Pair that with Garrett at OC and we’ve got a nice little group of coaches forming up.

NYGiants,fed7wpy,t1_fecfk3l,1579002965.0,"If he's occupying multiple guys that's still a good thing because it creates a disparity in numbers. Aaron Donald sometimes has to deal with 3 blockers which takes up two more of the other team's guys.  


He sounds like the kind of player that can be moved around the field though (unlike AD who can still beat his blockers in that case). If they start blocking him up with multiple guys you just have him show the blitz, then drop into coverage instead and send others on the blitz instead."

soccer,fe13cvb,t1_fdzqni3,1578822055.0,"Dennis is good right now. We’re pairing him or Wes with Kyle Wootton who we just picked up permanently from Scunny, and it’s paid off really nicely. Think all 3 are on double figure score tallies in all comps. Enzio is still kind of doing his thing where he drops in and out of games, but he’s adapting steadily and will have moments where he’ll just absolutely rip up the other team on a counter. Fortunately, if Wes pulls that, Dennis will be ready to step in, they both seem to have similar styles of play with how we line up so it’s a case of dropping in the best choice next to Wootton.

With our forward line the key element is Kyle Wootton though. He’s fairly quick and great in the air at this level. Good touch and chips in with goals too. If he’s on his game it’s very difficult to stop us right now."

soccer,fdzpn61,t1_fdzp563,1578792958.0,"On paper, you’re right. But we were poorly prepared (imo our preseason left players injured/unfit) and the regular changes in management left us so disorganised when defending.

However this season we had 2 full weeks of preseason to build a squad and they look miles fitter than they did at any point last year, and managing to keep a few key players (Dennis, Doyle, Rose, Enzio etc) as well as the manager has helped us out so much. The attitude and workrate is what it should be."
soccer,fdzk02t,t1_fdxks2m,1578790904.0,Quality of touch and eye for a pass. There’s not another player in this league who can play a diagonal 40 yards on the ground going around 3 players to set up a goal.

Guitar,fdyyp37,t1_fdyy5bx,1578784881.0,Honestly I don’t think there’s too much difference here. You might be able to get lower action out of the Ibanez constructions which would make quick changes in chords easy to do. The Ibanez I have doesn’t have their thinnest example of a neck though so I’m probably not seeing enough difference compared to others.
Guitar,fdyollb,t3_ence53,1578782008.0,"Flatter radius, thinner neck makes things easier. I have a Squier Strat and an SA series Ibanez. The difference isn’t as big as many suggest but it’s definitely noticeable. The squier is a bit more comfortable for playing big chords but the Ibanez is definitely quicker for single note scale runs.

Also, the fret sizes are different. The Ibanez has jumbo frets which makes tapping/legato easier in my ooinion."

Most DAWs should also have an I/O control section that let you select which outputs go to which channel(s) for more complicated setups (such as a control room with multiple monitor types, surround sound, mono monitor etc) which may show you the problem."

I’m suggesting that you would think nothing of it if it were part of legends or original/prequel canon, but you can’t stand it because Disney appeared to hint it, even though it’s denied later on.

Your wording in your original comment shows that much - the fact that you went on to state it as “Disney canon” rather than just “canon” shows it."
