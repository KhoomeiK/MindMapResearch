Like you guys know how to drive for the most part but there's definitely a lack of knowledge of the actual rules of the road lmao. I actually enjoy it though, no one gives a fuck so it's kinda fun, at least in small doses."

soccer,fez9f1e,t1_fez8tww,1579455050.0,Yeah honestly surprised to see his form there. Bringing the knee up is something that was drilled in to me since I was 8 playing keeper

reddevils,fehdb72,t3_ep6cfj,1579114199.0,This is awesome
reddevils,feeebp1,t1_fee65z4,1579031996.0,"I don't think so. Look at that replay. I don't see any top spin. It sure as shit looks like a deflection, but the ball says otherwise

Edit. Looking again, I still can't tell. Maybe he hit it with back spin and the deflection negated it? The ball is definitely knuckled as it goes into the net"
instantkarma,fecguhu,t1_fecdjxr,1578973597.0,Yeah my thoughts too. It's like kinda part of the job to be fit enough to apprehend criminals. Dude should be put assigned to a desk or taken out till he gets fit.

YouShouldKnow,fdsbkz1,t1_fds851z,1578698847.0,"I don't really care, I don't know you lol. But after rereading a few times, I just don't see where your anecdote fit into discussion. We're discussing basically how people react/respond to those with social anxiety.  All your anecdote did was describe your own manifestation of social anxiety. Everyone discussing already understands what social anxiety is and what it's manifestations look like. That is why I didn't think your comment was relevant. I may be coming off as rude, that's not my intention, just stating my thought process"
YouShouldKnow,fds4llv,t1_fdrptwn,1578694227.0,Yeah I probably wouldn't wanna deal with that either if I were in your shoes. Don't know how any of that was relevant to the discussion but I hope things get better for you
YouShouldKnow,fdqo4wn,t1_fdql8eo,1578671224.0,"I never said I would, or people in general would treat people poorly because someone is off-putting and anxious. But they probably won't talk to you the same way they do to others in the office (or wherever) simply bc someone with severe social anxiety is uncomfortable to talk to."
insaneparents,fdqdzwq,t1_fdqc2xg,1578664180.0,I feel like that word is being thrown around far too liberally recently
YouShouldKnow,fdqbqpi,t1_fdqavvb,1578662302.0,"Dude I'm not trying to minimize social anxiety, I struggled with it a lot and still do (obviously not to the extreme degrees of some people tho). I'm only saying that if all your social actions point towards being a ""jerk"", as this post describes, people are just going to assume that you are, unless you make an active effort to show that you're not in other ways."
YouShouldKnow,fdq81rz,t1_fdq6ps3,1578658735.0,"Yeah, because it's not their job sift through your personality to find what you're really ""like"". Either show it or don't."

Conservative,fdjp0wq,t1_fdjoke5,1578481632.0,"Lmao bc they probably read that the ""liberal"" party is in power, not realizing that it doesn't mean the same as it does in the US. The article is trash"

soccer,fdh3y35,t1_fdf4b9j,1578414859.0,"That's not true tho, de Gea has always been regarded as a great positional keeper. It's true that he's relied on his reflexes a ton and isn't the most active in the box, but to say he's not a top positional keeper is ridiculous imo"

RocketLeagueEsports,fbyp7cv,t3_ef6bwq,1577222697.0,Could anyone tell me why leth seems to really only go for that direct side-flip flick? I feel like the other flicks I see used (like rotating to the left/right and side flipping) are faster and can be placed better. Was he just trying to force flakes to jump for a boost steal?
