No. You can't.

Q&A does not have conservative politicians on ""all the time"" and on the occasion when they do, the panel and/or audience are inevitably stacked with Green/Left putting them on the back foot. Again, a symptom of the ABC's unchecked bias and total lack of balance.

Moreover I asked specifically about hosts (and I think we can at least agree now that you won't be able to name any) because they set the tone for all such programs. You will find more Left/ALP hosts on the eeevil Murdoch Sky Channel and Newspapers, completely privately funded than you'll find centre-right or right hosts anywhere on the fully taxpayer funded ABC.
