MaliciousCompliance,feljmiq,t1_fee8lig,1579223759.0,Had to share a schoolroom with a navy officer and a senior enlisted. They would come through our break room to get to some office in the back. Only time they ever did so was when we were on break. Of course the nco liked to bark attention on deck. I was one of the few that knew to translate that to Room Attention. Tables turned when the navy noncom was getting a cup of coffee and one of our AF officers walked in. Somebody barked out Room Attention. Navy just turns around with this wtf look on his face and realized it wasn’t his officer but ours.

You know the one I’m referring to. Without somebody having been willing to sit and let him vent without taking it personally. Without having somebody sit there and talk to him and encourage him to get the help he needed. Without having somebody, we may not have Victor. What you did Is what more veterans need to do.

service_dogs,fd33wms,t1_fd0ur5u,1578154508.0,I know the laws of my area. They didn’t. The point of me telling them to call the cops was that when they showed up the police would have tile the employee that they were in the wrong and had to SD to accompanying me. But that’s OK. I don’t need to deal with the BS of the power tripping moderators in this group so go ahead and permenately ban me. I could care less.

yesyesyesyesno,fcxjfp5,t3_ej9iz0,1578064422.0,I worked civilian EMS for 2 years. We had train tracks that crossed two towns in our area. It was not uncommon for us to get an emergency call and get held up because of a slow moving train on the tracks. We were trained to look BOTH ways. TWICE. And told “You get into a wreck became you didn’t pay attention and you pay for all the damages.”  Cop was not using due care. Glad the toddler was ok but this cop is an idiot.
dogswithjobs,fcvuvfb,t1_fcvu8ab,1578010631.0,Great hope they win first prize but don’t call the dancing dog a SD no matter how much comfort it gives you.
dogswithjobs,fcvuryd,t1_fcvu1ed,1578010569.0,"Places, at least in the US are NOT allowed by law to require documentation in order to allow a service dog to accompany their handler. If they do they are breaking federal law and are subject to consequences for it. Many states also have laws defining penalties at the state level for doing this. 
I don’t have a problem with somebody trying to train a dog to become a service dog. But a SD in training is Different than a fully trained one. 
The original headline was not clear about it and the first couple of responses were very vague as to the status of the dog which is generally how people with ESA or poets act when asked about the dog."
dogswithjobs,fcvu99r,t1_fcvriz2,1578010237.0,"I don’t harass anybody. Of I see a dog with it’s handler and it’s behaving appropriately then I can usually tell that they are working together as a team. You usually don’t have to say this way Fido when you turn a corner with a trained SD because they are concentrating on their handler and follow right along. It’s hard to explain but find one sometime and watch them discretely from a distance for a minute and you can understand it. 
On the other hand when I see a dog with a person and they are letting the dog roam around on a 15 foot flexi lead or having to constantly correct the dog then I have no qualms approaching the person and asking them of it is a service dog a long with what work out performs. I don’t ask about the disability nor did I do so here. I simply ask what task the dog does. A legit SD handler doesn’t get upset about that because they know it’s the two questions that are allowed to be asked and they get it on a regular basis. People trying to pass off their ESA our pet get really defensive really fast because they know that they are in the wrong or they think that the louder they get or meaner they are about it the more other people will back off on it. 
The reason I approach the latter class of people is because they are in the wrong and it’s usually not hard to tell and I have a low threshold of BS. 
Same as people that are obviously young wearing a uniform shirt of an individual from the military with rank insignia on it that takes years to obtain. Sorry there Mr. 15 year old but you ain’t even close to having alive long enough to enlist let alone make Chief Master Sargent yet. Yes, I will call you out on that and yes I will call people out on having a dog in a place where it has no business of being. Yes I also do report them to the management of I can but no I am not going to leave the area in order to protect myself or my legit Service Dog. I have other ways to take care of that."
dogswithjobs,fcvsqk9,t1_fcvrk38,1578009257.0,"The dogs must by the ADA law perform work or task that is not done by a pet.  Any dog can stand on your feet while you shuffle along. A service dog performs work by alerting you to an oncoming anxiety attack (which is different than getting nervous in lines) and then performing a task that a pet would not. In this case the OP has since stated that the dog leads her away from the situation. That is a task or work that a normal pet does not do. Or if the dog were to alert to the attack and then perform deep pressure therapy that is also something that a regular pet does not do. 
If you are going to quote ADA law know the entire law. You would have seen that simply standing on somebody’s feet really isn’t a task.
I care because as a SD handler I got grief from employees when I walked into a store with my SD because previous people had been in there either passing off their pet as a SD or just straight up thinking they were allowed to bring their pet dog in with them."
dogswithjobs,fcvr2tx,t1_fcvk9wc,1578008185.0,"Because way too many people see things like this than say oh I want to train my dog to do that so I can take it everywhere with me when the dog is Not a service dog.  And has no right to accompany the handler.

dogswithjobs,fcv857s,t3_ej2rcr,1577996635.0,"My first question is, is this a service dog. Second question in what task or work does it do directly for your disability?
Getting nervous in lines is not a disability. Having panic attacks that are debilitating from PTSD is. 
Standing between your legs so you can feel him isn’t really a task per say. It’s more of a stretch so that he can accompany you. Pick him up? For what reason? Granted some small SD are carried in chest harnesses to do blood sugar detection. 
Are there any additional task he performs?"

dogswithjobs,fcuo7zm,t1_fctajvc,1577985177.0,And it’s inconsiderate for people to assume their allergies are more important. The laws for allowing service dogs to accompany their handlers exist for a reason. They are called reasonable accommodations. All you have to do is inform the flight crew and they will take reasonable actions so that your death allergy is accommodated.

It is hard enough for legitimate service dog teams to fly the way it is. This very well may be a legit team too but by allowing the dog in the seat where it is not supposed to be and then posting it online to are giving every body the idea that it’s ok to do this when it is not."
