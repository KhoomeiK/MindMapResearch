So biologically people are animals, and society tends to place greater value on human life than that of other animals.

Not going to say the sentiment expressed here isn't true, or that people who torture or indiscriminately kill an animal aren't a net negative on society, or highly deserve punishment, I completely agree on that account.  To use that logic to justify killing a human, though, would seem to only convert a non-psychopath into a psychopath.

I find it baffling that reasonable people reasonably believe that stereotyping and prejudice are wrong, and yet still paint large swaths of people with the same brush. I guess it's easier if you can consider them enemy.

I'm politically just about as far from Trump as I can be, and can't really justify people's decisions to support him.  Despite that, I can interact with them civilly and see eye-to-eye with them on topics other than politics.  Often-times their opinions and stances are quite different than that of Trump himself or the stereotypical conservative. 

I figure if I can interact with them on a friendly basis, they'll be less likely to see me as the enemy, and more willing to consider my opinions should they ever come up.  Believe it or not, that works a good portion of the time in my experience.  I can't change a person's mind on everything, and there are almost certainly people that are entirely closed-minded and wouldn't even chose to interact civilly with me, but I'm not going to decide that for them before at least making an attempt.

If you start a relationship or interaction pre-defining yourselves as enemies, you'll only further cement their opinions and give them reason to reject yours.  If you can find any small degree of common ground, you open up the possibility that they'll examine your opinions more candidly and be willing to bend their own.

 * Corporate raiders that engage in hostile take-overs and either merge, or dismantle companies simply for short-term profits

japanese,fcxvsxb,t1_fcxtoku,1578071258.0,"> The Japanese fitted a language with no writing system to a foreign writing system. That’s why there are many exceptions and odd kanjis, such as 茶化す where the characters are merely used phonetically as a relic of pre-Kana days.

You see this sort of thing too in *ateji* for early words borrowed from western languages such as [倶楽部](/fg ""くらぶ"") for ""club"".

 An attempt was made to match meaning to character, but really it was done to match the pronuncation to the foreign borrowing with Chinese characters as best as possible."

japanese,fcxrjvk,t3_ejfxg8,1578069461.0,"Not specific to this particular case, but in general you somewhat frequently find multiple kanji for related nuances of the same concept and pronunciation in Japanese.   It's called [同訓異字](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%90%8C%E9%9F%B3%E7%95%B0%E5%AD%97) ""*doukun iji*"" or ""same *kun* reading, different character"".  The Wikipedia page linked there includes tons of examples.

&nbsp;

Here's one example (あう) that has a bunch of different writings:

Written | Meaning | Pronunciation
---|---|---
会う|""to meet"" (general, generic nuance)|あう
逢う|""to meet [a friend or family] (with a nuance of emotion)|あう
遭う|""to meet in a bad way"" (negative nuance)|あう
合う|""to unite or combine"" (similar, but shifted meaning)|あう

[Here's a more detailed write-up](https://business-textbooks.com/au-difference/) for these usages and nuances of あう and more in Japanese for those interested.

&nbsp;

This happens because of the *on-yomi* / *kun-yomi* aspect of Kanji in Japanese.  *On-yomi* is derived from the original Chinese readings and meanings and came directly when Japanese speakers adopted the Chinese writing system (it's closeish to the original usage in China). *Kun-yomi* are pre-existing, original Japanese words and pronunciations that get applied to the Chinese characters based on their meaning as they match up. Once Japanese  speakers had a bunch of Kanji with similar but slightly different meanings, they could use these in writing to assign nuance to the older existing Japanese words that were closer to the characters' original meanings.

&nbsp;

Before Chinese characters were adopted, Japanese had no writing system, so this would naturally happen as they started translating Chinese text into spoken Japanese as they borrowed and translated literature from China. It would also naturally happen when converting Japanese back into Chinese text as they started writing their own.

&nbsp;

In modern Chinese:

Written | Related Meaning | Pronunciation
---|---|---
会|""to meet"", ""to gather""|huì / kuài
逢|""to meet by chance""|féng
遭|""to meet by chance (usually with misfortune)""|zāo
合|""to join""|hé

You can see from the pronunciation that in Chinese, these are all completely separate words, but they all have meanings close to the original Japanese あう.

&nbsp;

The closest analogy to English are probably homonyms that have similar, related meanings. For example:

* ""bright"" meaning ""smart"" comes from ""bright"" meaning ""light and shiny""  
 The first adjective (metaphorically a bright mind) comes from the second
* a ""tie"" is an object that you ""tie"" around your neck  
 The noun comes from the verb.

&nbsp;

As to your specific example, 花 in Chinese is currently pronounced ""huā"" and has a meaning of ""flower or blossom"". For  華, its closest descendant character in Chinese is pronounced ""huá"" and has a meaning of ""magnificent / splendid / flowery"".

It seems they are almost homophones in Chinese as well, but you can see how the slight meaning differences also translate to the Japanese usages when they assigned both characters to the *kun-yomi* original Japanese word ""はな""/""flower"".

&nbsp;

Sorry for the essay here, but I find this stuff really fascinating.

**TL;DR:**  The different writings were different words with similar meanings but different nuances in Chinese. when the Chinese writing system was borrowed into Japanese, the same multiple writings got applied to individual original Japanese words with matching meanings, but in writing they retain the different nuances from the Chinese.
