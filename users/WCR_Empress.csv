I stopped watching stuff involving her because it got too much, it's true you can tell she isn't sure what to say during legitimate questions. Her heart is pure but unfortunately is being controlled by nasty figures it seems.

Hogg on the other hand is only similar because of wanting to change the world, but with him he has his own agenda and he doesn't need someone to tell him what to say, he is his own manager in a sense and is put on a ivory tower on outlets like CNN to scream his message loud and clear.

One is pure with intent while the other wants a f'ed up revolution, his followers area fed lies and it's unfortunate to see people still follow him."
Firearms,ff7jgsh,t1_ff7iqla,1579650994.0,"Fair but something is wrong with that kid, in an interview he was dropping F bombs at the adults in the room calling them retards and being all around disgusting.

I have nothing against Greta but her anger is sorely misplaced. Mr. Beast is planting millions of trees, there are many challenges around the world of people cleaning up the earth and there are inventions coming out every day and being implemented into the world to clean up oil from the oceans, pick garbage from it and we are fighting to keep our world clean.

The only one not playing the game here with the environment is China, they make up 1/3 the pollution in our world and yet everyone seems silent when we talk about what we can do to fix it. If anything she should be vocal about their undoings

I have no issue with Greta she just needs to realize that the people she has deemed toxic do want to talk with her, but she needs to realize there is a huge effort being played out, just one team doesnt wanna play."
