This is what I responded on a r/sociopath thread.

>The act itself is not what love is. You do something for another out of love, not because you need to first act to prove to another that you love her/him. All normal people act out of love, it’s the sociopath that needs to act first to prove the love that’s not really there.

You’ve peddled in spritituality, spirit guides and having multiple partners. These are big sins. Especially consulting spirit guides, which are demons. You’ve been led by them. They might very well have led you on this way.

The best you can do is go to a bible believing church, find a pastor, and talk to him about your problems. Ask about Jesus (if you not believe in Him already), and ask what is required of you to receive life.

Also go to a mental institute to ask for professional help, there might be something going on psychologically as well.

TrueChristian,ff60vz9,t1_ff5y8be,1579616269.0,"What about Judas. Destined for hell, like the devil. He betrayed Christ.

I didn’t do anything different. I severed myself from Christ, because I wanted to earn righteousness on my own account, instead of receiving it through faith (relationship/love), thereby I’ve cut myself from grace. As scripture says: “You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.”
(‭‭Gal.‬ ‭5:4‬ ‭NKJV‬‬)

I believed I could always repent, and thus, do anything I pleased, even bringing sorrow to God. Because, I can always repent. Well... That didn’t work out, as you could imagine. Not neccesarily because I did some things wrong, but because I placed myself above Christ, as the “God” of my life. Now the deal is sealed, God gave me over. What I’ve heard immediately after the Spirit left was. ‘My love can’t reach you here, my grace can’t reach you, you wanted to live life for yourself, I can’t stop you. Go ahead then.’

TrueChristian,ff605h5,t1_ff5vhid,1579615696.0,"I’m not entirely convinced you actually understand the kind of situation the damned find themselves in.

They don’t repent because they’ve hurt God or love God. They repent because they’re damned. But that’s the entire point. The damned can’t repent, hence damned. They’re alive sure. But they bring forth nothing but lies, pain, destruction and death, just as their father the devil does. (Read /r/sociopath to get a feel.) If anyone could repent when they’d desire to, anyone could live however their great lusts and flesh desired and would repent on their deathbed and be transferred to heaven still.

I desire to repent. But as Hebrews 12:16-17 says, He could not find a place of repentance in his heart though he sought it diligently and with tears (Esau). God must grant me repentance. When he took His Spirit He took the ability for me to be granted repentance. I have tried everything. I still pray for God to change my heart so I can repent. (Because I can’t stand the idea of going to eternal punishment, however just.) I pray for genuine repentance. I pray for hope.

I can say sorry, but that’s not repentance.  It’s the heart that must say sorry, not the lips. My heart doesn’t turn. I can’t change my heart. As is said in scripture ‘He hardened His heart’.

I want to so bad. I hate myself, the situation I’m in and I wish I was never born (as Jesus says about the man that would betray Him). I’m just clueless about what to do now. Can’t stop thinking about it either (torment). Days and nights are exactly the same. I can’t find a way out. Nothing holds water, except the condemnation that is without Christ.

Just read up on sociopathy, and you might discover that there’s no hope for people such as these. They’re really just diabolical demons restricted by human bodies. However well they portray themselves. (At least that’s my estimation, however good they now wish to do, they’re given over to reprobate minds.) ‘No marvel even satan himself masquarades as an angel of light.’ (2 Cor. 11:14)

I think denying Christ, ending your relationship with Him, or sinning until there’s no love left in your heart for Jesus, is the very same eternal sin as the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit, and results in the same hopeless unending torment. First mental torment, this life, later physical torment as well.

You’re not the first one that says there’s still hope. My heart just can’t believe it. Not because I don’t want to. Why does one want to believe in deserving and receiving hellfire? No one wants to believe they actually achieved going there, yet I can’t deceive myself being saved still. I just can’t. How will I ever get away with terminating my relationship with Christ, with betraying Him, presuming grace is always there for the taking. No just can’t believe it.

It’s the kind of sin, and persistancy of it that makes you care more about yourself and the petty sin than about Christ. That’s the surefire way to make the Holy Spirit leave. Because once your love for Christ is gone, there’s no connection. And the Spirit left.

The act itself is not what love is. You do something for another out of love, not because you need to first act to prove to another that you love her/him. All normal people act out of love, it’s the sociopath that needs to act first to prove the love that’s not really there.

You can do all in your power to make another person feel good, without loving them at all. That’s exactly what sociopaths do. They do “good” but it’s not from the heart, it’s not motivated by love.

But your quote might be, for a sociopath the best, regarding morality, there is to offer."
sociopath,ff2uu53,t1_ff2tqhs,1579525044.0,"It’s in the heart I believe. A sociopath says in his heart: I don’t believe in righteousness and don’t care about it. Or: Right and wrong does not exist, Or: to hell with my conscience, Or: I don’t believe in God, period. Or: the world can go to shit and I will help it. Or anything along those lines.

If you believe you’re a sinful human being and need Jesus Christ to save you from the consequences of your sins: hell. Save you from your evil heart, you might be saved (since I don’t know if you specifically have crossed the line).

You need to repent. And it must be genuine. Most sociopaths can’t genuinely repent because they have no remorse or sorrow for what they’ve done.

God wants the best for his creation. The best for you and me, and everyone else. He loves us. We need to be saved from our sins in order to have a relationship with Him. With belief in Jesus as your savior you will be saved from sin, by the power of the Holy Spirit. You will have the power to do good, and choose to be righteous. From that moment on your heart will change, and sanctification begins. You’ll also receive life everlasting with Christ, and all who believe in Him."
sociopath,ff2u10p,t1_ff2tf9b,1579524138.0,"I just want to say that even if you don’t go full out hurting people (or animals) for no reason, you’ll still hurt people by deceiving them you’re something you’re not. You might do well in earning others trust, and others thinking you truly love them, but it’s all a facade. And you know it. On a subconscious level you can never give what they require in a relationship. A sociopath can never truly love their spouses or kids. And on a subconscious level the lack of care or love will be translated to their hearts, without it ever coming to the conscious level. 

I had/have a mother whose a sociopath (I believe) she will say she loves me, and do somethings for me, even some big things, but deep down, she won’t care if she hurts me by doing something selfish. Before I became the monster I became, I got hurt by her in this way (and others), I began to be very insecure about myself. One of the reasons is her humor is laughing people off, that’s the only way to make her laugh. (I’m the same now.) Us sociopaths do this too. This results in people doing stupid and crazy things to just get attention. Then they get laughed at, will think they’re doing something good. Because yay mom laughs, all the while experiencing an ever increasing decrease in confidence. 

These are just a few examples. We really won’t add anything to the human race. Believe me. And I hate it. I want to change. And some of you want to as well. But I don’t know how."
sociopath,ff2tjke,t1_ff2tbk4,1579523558.0,"Well every sociopath is an abuser, but not the other way around. 

A normal person can abuse others, and does abuse others also, without them ever becoming a sociopath. I think people are always evil, but can be saved from their evil. A sociopath is someone who can’t be saved, who can’t stop the evil he brings to life. A sociopath has crossed the line of the saveable, the redeemable, those who are able to receive God’s grace and change.

Many Christians have a testimony full of sin (evil), but Jesus saving them, and they now living a purposeful, caring, mostly sinfree and loving life."

We live a facade to please people, but we don’t love them at all, it’s all charade. Sociopaths are the most selfish people alive. Even more so than narcissists. Because narcissists however selfish, have some sort of empathy left. A sociopath hasn’t.

This whole post is a real joke. Of course were the fucking abusers, and it’s our fault. We shouldn’t portray ourselves to be any better than we are. Let’s at least not lie to ourselves."

TrueChristian,fen582f,t1_fen40ow,1579277241.0,"No I did it myself. 

Well, at a certain point I couldn’t trust my mom any longer. That was a big issue. Because I started to think she couldn’t care less about me, but just pretended she did. Just as sociopaths do. The Spirit told me to love her still, and forgive her for any wrong done. But I didn’t listen and hardened my heart saying: ‘No, what she does is wrong, and I won’t trust her, period.’

I simply cut emotional ties with anyone and presented my sales-persona as the real me: full of cognitive empathy, so they would still bond, but without any real love for the other person. I did it first with family, later friends, still later parents, and eventually Jesus. (Of course Jesus wouldn’t fall for deception.)

I figured I shouldn’t be motivated by love to do right, but only because of internal conviction. Because if it’s love that compells you, it isn’t really you doing the good autonomously. I wanted to be right/good on my own account, without doing it out of motivation of love for Jesus.  

“You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.” (Gal.5:4)

Deep in my heart I knew it would be wrong, but I took my salvation and Gods love for granted thinking, I can always ask forgiveness so why wouldn’t I try it. (Eternal sin of presumption, known by Catholics, I learned this later. By these actions/decisions I believe I’ve blasphemed the Spirit.)"
TrueChristian,fen2jiq,t1_fekbr6r,1579275542.0,"Maybe I don’t exactly feel damned, but I know I am. I don’t have empathy, only cognitive empathy.

I hope God will still redeem me, yes. I don’t know how to persuade Him to do so though.

I pray (to Him), but the whole experience is like talking to the wall. 

I go to church, but I can’t worship, because it’s not from the heart. It’s not meant. Scripture I stopped reading, because all it seems to accomplish is condemnation and hellfire. I associate with Judas, only I did not decide to take my life.

I will try fasting soon. And I’ll keep praying even if it doesn’t come from my heart.
