boardgames,ff91png,t3_esa1ug,1579702653.0,"I have both with all their respective expansions. Coup gets more play. I've gifted Coup to people. It's a great gateway game, opener for game night, and it's quick. 

G54 makes it to the table when my family is over because they will play Coup for literal hours. It starts to need some variety at that point, which is where reformation and G54 shine. Another poster made a valid point, since the roles change and there are so many, it's more difficult to bluff, however, it is not uncommon to review the roles to see who can defend against what and what other people are claiming to be. This general confusion is great cover for studying to bluff. Once you play enough of it, it becomes easier and easier, and you begin to see which roles go good together in games.

I would not buy G54 unless you play Coup to the point where you want more and have already bought reformation."

MansionsOfMadness2E,ff8u3h3,t3_esafbd,1579696125.0,"literally all of the expansions except the figure and tile packs are still available from multiple online retailers.

the only reason the 2 packs aren't, is the molds used to make the minis degraded in quality from so many reprints and it was not financially feasible to recast the molds. you can still grab these packs in other languages and use them with a little effort. See my [italian to english conversion post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MansionsOfMadness2E/comments/diwsw7/i_recently_posted_asking_for_an_italian_to/).

if first edition is any reference, that was active for 7 years before 2nd edition was launched, and those games were still available for some time. you can even find many of them NIB on the secondary market. furthermore, since 2nd edition introduced the app to replace the gamemaster, there really isn't a purpose to moving to a third edition unless there are plans for a drastic overhaul of the game engine.. which I imagine would be announced by FFG.

in short, no one will know for sure, but based on the information we have, the figure and tile collections are bit of an anomaly, and the game is currently in the top 30 on BGG. They keep slashing the price of the base game so people will get invested and buy expansions. It's safe to say they will be around for a while."
YouShouldKnow,ff8ta2j,t3_es59s7,1579695265.0,"YSK reddit in general has jumped the shark in terms of being a niche place where you can ask very specific questions and get detailed answers from knowledgeable folks.

All you need to do is comment early, sound reasonable/logical, and it will be upvoted like it is the best answer. Often times, it is wrong. Misinformation is also parroted often because people read it once, believed it, and repost it as if they are informed.

Bad advice is given all the time. Be objective, research outside of reddit. Ask friends and family, and if it is concerning anything important, consult a lawyer, doctor, relationship counselor, etc. Do not rely on random people on the internet for important life decisions. The largest demographic on reddit are teenage to early 20s, not saying they don't know shit, but as a former 20 year old who thought they knew everything and could passionately convince people of it..  they don't know shit.
