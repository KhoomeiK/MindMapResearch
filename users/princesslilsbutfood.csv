TellMeAFact,ffcn4gz,t1_ffclq01,1579802980.0,Interesting! I’ve read about this- I think that a lot of hearing people will be quick to say “but why don’t you just get your kid hearing aids/implants?” so they can hear “normally” but what they fail to recognize is that deaf children usually have difficulty accessing sign language education (in the UK anyway) so that’s a Central part of their culture they miss out on. It’s a whole language they have a right to. Which is one of the reasons why it’s hugely important for deaf children to be involved with deaf culture. Is that about right?

Thank you both! I will definitely check the videos out and take your advice into consideration for next time. I was just under the impression that there are clear rights and wrongs regarding crumb size etc, which I’m more concerned about, but I’m glad you said that not all loaves have to be the same."
TellMeAFact,ff5lhb5,t3_erft51,1579598694.0,"Mayonnaise is made of egg yolk, oil and vinegar - all of which are beneficial to hair health. So theoretically you could slather your hair in mayonnaise if you run out of conditioner or something. 

You could also use mayonnaise as an ingredient in cake making. It seems weird but again, it is mainly just egg and oil, both of which are ingredients that tend to go into cakes anyways.

Edit: spelling"

Breadit,ff38o7h,t1_ff388p0,1579536308.0,"Ah okay I see. I will work on the texture but I think the shaping was at least partly because I baked it in my slow cooker dish (as I don’t have a Dutch oven). When it was proving it appeared to grow pretty well and was shaped much nicer but my slow cooker dish kind of made it smaller and changed the shape from the round ball I had it in originally. But for next time I am thinking of just baking it on a tray and also putting a dish of water in the oven so it will still benefit from the steam to form a crust.

Edit: also my kitchen was quite chilly and I’m not quite sure yet how temperature affects proving but I read somewhere that I might have needed to let it prove for slightly longer than the recipe stated"

Ingredients
- 500g sliced beef
- 1 tbsp ground coriander 
- 3 cloves garlic
- A pinch of salt 

For the sambal 
- 4 red chilies, cut into large chunks
- 2 tomatoes, quartered 
- 3 small shallots, quartered 
- 10-15 birds eye chilies, kept whole 
- 3 cloves garlic, kept whole 
- 2 kaffir lime leaves 
- Sugar to taste 
- Salt to taste 

1. Cook the beef: Using a food processor, combine the ground coriander, garlic and salt into a paste, using a little bit of water if necessary. Next, place your beef in a pot of water and mix in the coriander paste. Bring to a steady simmer and let the beef cook through for 15-20 minutes then drain the liquid. 

2. Smash the beef: Once your beef is ready, lay each piece on a chopping board and use something like a rolling pin to smash it just until the beef is flattened (not broken up). You can use a pestle and mortar if you have one.

3. Fry the beef: In a pan, add a generous amount of oil for shallow frying the beef. Once it is hot, add the beef pieces and let them fry on both sides until they have crisped up, then remove from the oil and set aside.

4. Make the sambal: In the same oil, add all the ingredients for the sambal except for the salt, sugar and lime leaves. Let the ingredients fry for around 7-8 minutes until they have softened and the chilies have slightly changed colour. Remember to keep the ingredients moving so they don’t burn. Once ready, scoop them out and into a food processor and blitz into a coarse sambal. It doesn’t need to be perfectly smooth. 

5. Bring it together: Once your sambal paste and beef are ready, you can bring them together into one dish. Remove some of the oil used for frying earlier, leaving only a little bit in the pan and add the sambal  (remember that this is already oily). Add the lime leaves, sugar, and salt to taste. Let the flavours incorporate for a few minutes before stirring through the beef and serving."
