Where you can select roles. 
My god, if you think I’m falling for your trolling you are wrong. I take pleasure in seeing how far pathecit people can go.
I understand you are frustrated in life and this is some kind of outlet for you.

But on the other side, where you think you have succeeded, you are seen as a malicious person and will just be one of the thousand things a person forgets every day.

launchbox,feqxpn1,t3_eq99uj,1579347294.0,IF you use your unit for media too (movies/music) I would recommend that you use Kodi as a front end. From there you can launch either big box or big picture. This is how I separate my retro gaming and current gaming.

Thrash talking and being a bad human being are 2 vastly different things.

Trash talking like “you couldn’t hit the side of a barn door” is around the level of what trash talk should be. Edgy but not over the edge.

I’m 34 and played online since quake. I’ve seen and heard it all so the skin is thick enough but still think people lose their way in a competitive environment far too much. That and the fact that it’s a utter waste of time and focus to get hung up in fury.
