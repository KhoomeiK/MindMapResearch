President or not, Yang’s ideas will continue to penetrate both parties. I’ve already seen a few Trump-siders in my family turned on to Yang, so that’s encouraging."

It doesn’t fluctuate visibly when there are thousands of reviews already on the pile. Now the fact that the average reached 86, despite seemingly everyone being disappointed with it...that seems odd."

facepalm,fckz9je,t1_fckixa9,1577736388.0,"Pranks are designed to trick people. People got tricked into thinking their drinking water was contaminated. It’s not like the radio hosts thought, “well certainly nobody is stupid enough to react to this.”  The whole point of the prank is that your target *will* believe what you say...temporarily at least. The D.J.’s are the ignorant party here.  If you’re going to pull a prank, you need to consider the consequences of the prank “working”.  A significant number of people will believe this is a serious situation; will they have questions? Will they believe an evacuation is in order? Will they wonder what the hell is going on? Is this being broadcast to the entire city?!"
facepalm,fckynyk,t1_fckuksn,1577736017.0,"I’d have to hear the broadcast, but if they sold it, I’d get freaked out too. Dihydrogen Monoxide isn’t a term you hear every day and most of us don’t make a habit of screening emergency announcements for pranks."

MurderedByWords,fckh1id,t1_fckg6tp,1577725152.0,"Murderous ideology develops with or without diety worship.  I see the religious doctrine primarily as serving existing behaviors, rather than the other way around. You’ll find that the desperate and disordered cultures will more willingly adhere to the barbaric suggestions of their text. That’s not a coincidence. Religion revolves around the culture; rarely does it work the other way around.

There are historical and sociological studies that support this, but it’s not to say that religion can’t result in some serious nonsense...on the “micro-level”.

I have a difficult time viewing religion as distinct from modern law and order. Except under religious law, when you ask “but why?” long enough, you’ll get an answer...a bullshit one, but a clean and concise one:”it’s the way”."
MurderedByWords,fckdn8o,t1_fck88pk,1577722977.0,"So what controls *you*? I’m not exactly religious (despite 12 years of catholic school), but I doubt you can conjure up anything more meaningful or truthful, as ultimately...none of us really knows what the fuck the point of life is."
