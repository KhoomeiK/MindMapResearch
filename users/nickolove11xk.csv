Just checked and the stall speed of a “737” is 147mph. Not going to rip your arm off but Sure wouldn’t be easy. A captain got sucked halfway out this window on the side at altitude and survived with some frostbite and other injuries. Someone used the wrong bolds on the window."

Guy came and took a quick look and ordered a new control board and fan. Only one part came and eventually we got a refund. Before throwing it out I checked it out myself. Found the wires from board to fan was good but getting nothing out of the old or new board. So I checked the continuity between solder on the back of the board and the plug for the fan. Ended up finding foam insulation inside the connector to the board. Shits made so cheep, companies don’t care about the waste it’s just better to throw it away and make another one."

Most likely the sink is broken so hopefully jts a standard size.
funny,fd0tgn5,t1_fd0gbs6,1578123528.0,There’s still a dozen other reasons. How about parking at home. In many cases we’re talking about a third vehicle for the family if the spouse has one. Sure they take that on long trips but regardless no one is going to drive their truck home to pick up a beater to then leave for groceries or dinner after working all day. They’re taking their work truck to eat first.
