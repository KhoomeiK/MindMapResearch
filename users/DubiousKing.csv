It's why the anti-vax movement has been using these methods for so long. I'm all for using their own weapons against them to sway those who can't be bothered to think critically. And if the anti-vax movement starts to point it out, they're essentially admitting to fooling their own base in the same way and risk alienating at least some of their supporters. Sounds like a win-win to me."

3d6,fef6rsl,t1_feexxxq,1579049517.0,Every other feature I've seen that gives a natural weapon says you can use it to make unarmed strikes. It's almost definitely intended for this feature to work the same way.
3d6,fdd0iae,t3_ekeroo,1578289993.0,"I have two artificers that I've thrown together, one I've actually played and the other I just got wrapped up in the concept but haven't brought him to the table yet.

The one that I've played was a Battlemaster in a high level campaign. My previous character retired from the party near the end so he got to jump in at level 18. Based the concept very roughly on a more affable Indiana Jones. He played a lot like a sort of ranged paladin, to be quite honest. A lot of my turns consisted of casting smite spells through my pistol and enhancing them with Arcane Jolt, but I got a lot of great use from casting *enlarge* on my steel defender to really draw enemy attention. When support was needed it was pretty easy to fall into that role with the healing from Arcane Jolt and the Flash of Genius ability. Honestly, though, I think my favorite thing from playing him was giving our party face a spell-storing item with *enhance ability* in it so she had advantage on her Charisma checks basically whenever she wanted.

The other one that I really wanna pull out sometime soon is an Alchemist, but everything is flavored around him being an expert painter and his spells being delivered through enchanted pigments. I feel like the support aspects of the subclass are sorely underrated by a lot of people, especially the ability to cast *lesser restoration* so many times per day without using spell slots. I'd like the subclass a lot more if the experimental elixirs were a little more powerful, but I actually like the randomness of the free ones each long rest. At least you know what they do before consuming them so you can work out strategies in which they'll be useful ahead of time. The only one that really falls off in combat terms at late levels is the one that casts *alter self*, but it's great for getting around social and exploration situations. I need both hands to count the number of times I've wished someone prepared *water breathing* to get to some loot or scout out a location. And if you use the Change Appearance mode you can change it as many times as you want for the duration, which can make for some great shenanigans when trying to get past guards or break someone out of confinement."

drumcorps,fclmus6,t3_ehsoe9,1577751508.0,"Sounds like a great opportunity, if you were planning on marching World Class this summer it's hard to go wrong with Troopers. And if the assurances of a random redditor make you feel any better, I've previously been taught by Tim Leonelli and Timothy Nemzin (another member of their brass staff) at Boston and they were both great instructors, not only in the knowledge they imparted but also in how they treated us as performers. I also marched with their Visual Caption Head, Anthony Clark, for two years and I'm confident you'll be in good hands while there."
magicTCG,fc19uxy,t1_fc0wjqo,1577312425.0,"IANAJ, but I'm fairly certain if one was called over you would shuffle the card in question back into the deck. If it's unclear which card in your hand is the extra you drew you would most likely be instructed to shuffle one random card from your hand back into the deck (usually blindly picked by your opponent) and maybe given a warning."
