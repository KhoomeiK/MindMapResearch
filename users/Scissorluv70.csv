creepyPMs,ff1hso8,t1_ff1hja5,1579479443.0,I mean there’s lots of situations where a man who has a GF can be on a gay dating app lol there’s lots of them on Grindr for a lot of different reasons
creepyPMs,fduhwuy,t1_fdst16w,1578733263.0,"There’s not really a dating app for trans people, so most default to grindr. There is actually a tribe just for trans people and plenty of men on the app that are attracted to trans women, so while the app is marketed towards gay men, trans people find use for it too."
creepyPMs,fds102n,t1_fds0wvy,1578692603.0,Doesn’t excuse transphobia
creepyPMs,fdrzj83,t1_fdrykfk,1578692059.0,Suicidal because of the discrimination we experience from the rest of the world around us. Not because we are trans. Take your ignorance and conspiracy theories elsewhere. My existence is not a conspiracy theory.
creepyPMs,fdrjvt4,t1_fdrjgvi,1578685584.0,Yikes! Even more transphobia!
creepyPMs,fdrh37w,t1_fdrgrms,1578684490.0,I’d rather do their makeup and charge them money 😂😂😍
creepyPMs,fdrc0bs,t1_fdrbx3x,1578682355.0,Yikes transphobia isn’t cute
MaliciousCompliance,fdmpu8q,t1_fdmc8gl,1578559871.0,Ok I thought I did fix it? I explained what my abbreviations mean. Is that not fixing it? Don’t make an assumption that I could t be bothered. What is with you reddit people jumping the gun and assuming everything damn
entitledparents,fdmpqs8,t1_fdmar7v,1578559739.0,Lol it’s crazy to me that people will believe a cloud man in the sky created them rather than believe in scientific fact. You sound insane.
entitledparents,fdm7dnh,t1_fdm6nk7,1578541613.0,Religion is created by said shit people... i-
MaliciousCompliance,fdkmbkf,t1_fdkm849,1578506519.0,"Thanks, I didn’t downvote you, but thanks lol"
MaliciousCompliance,fdkkeas,t1_fdkk8k8,1578505442.0,I’ve had the app for like 2 days forgive me for not reading it all
EntitledBitch,fdkgur1,t1_fdkgqxm,1578503595.0,Nobody was doing illegal transactions? Where did you even pull that out of your ass from everything I just said? Go bother somebody else I’m not wasting anymore brain cells on you.
EntitledBitch,fdkgauw,t1_fdkfoq7,1578503258.0,"I like how you keep quoting what I’m saying like you’re making a point lol yes, he was Capitalizing words, and screaming. That is what a capitalized word is for. 

He was rude to me in the first line of his comment, where insinuated I was stupid or couldn’t comprehend my training. That is where he lost my respect and when he continued to be an asshat, I retaliated. This is the Internet. It’s never that serious. 

The only form I ever had to fill out was when they came back after saying it was a scam. And that’s why I tried to talk my manager into letting us deny transactions because I got tired of writing them. 

This person tried making it out like I was “doing illegal transactions” on purpose when in fact my store manger would yell at me for denying customers anything. But yet after I point out I was just doing my job he continued to come at me like it’s a fucking court case. This was suppose to be a fun sharing of my experience and laugh at somebody but somehow y’all manage to make everything into a legal debate or make insulting comments. Grow the fuck up and enjoy the damn story and stop trying to cross examine everything like your life depends on it."
EntitledBitch,fdkezbu,t1_fdke80l,1578502457.0,"I also did money transfers daily for 2 years for two different companies, seems like by your logic I would be an expert too right? 

When you’re an asshole to me you forfeit any respect I have for you. He was rude first, therefore my relation was justified. He was screaming and coming at me first, don’t try and make him out to be a victim."
entitledparents,fdkc9jl,t3_elsh7l,1578500832.0,Hopefully that kid doesn’t end up like his dad. Some people shouldn’t be allowed to have kids cause they’ll grow up to be assholes like them.
entitledparents,fdkc0l4,t3_elsb3u,1578500679.0,Glad she showed her ass before you moved in! Imagine not knowing until after... that would suck
entitledparents,fdkbvvd,t3_elle3d,1578500600.0,Damn.. you gotta be one cold hearted birch if you only had a kid to make him fake choke to get free shit. Yikes.
entitledparents,fdkbmma,t3_els1cc,1578500444.0,This is why I refuse to take the bus.. I did one time and the guy next to me looked like a meth addict and talked to himself the entire ride. I couldn’t sleep for the 8 hour drive out of fear he would try something crazy.
entitledparents,fdkbd4k,t3_elou4l,1578500283.0,"I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again, nothing good ever comes out of religion."
EntitledBitch,fdk8tyt,t1_fdk8h6e,1578498695.0,"And I’m sure you’re an expert on federal money transfer laws. Go stroke your ego knowledge boner somewhere else pal you sound like an asshat. I’m not gonna repeat myself. I said what I said, and it’s not my fault you don’t have an IQ higher than your dick size to understand basic English sentences. Stop writing me paragraphs thinking you’re winning in a fight you made up in your head 🙄🖕🏻"
EntitledBitch,fdk7num,t1_fdk7cgj,1578497948.0,"I don’t know what your issue is, but you don’t need to scream at somebody online. This was my experience. This is what I was told by management and my training. We were NOT allowed to deny a money transfer on the simple grounds that we thought it was suspicious or potentially a scam. Trust me I went back and forth with my managers about it because I got tired of filling out the forms when people would come back. And if they didn’t do it at our store they went across the street and did it over there, nobody stopped them. Stop yelling at me for something I had no control over. I was doing what I was told to by management. Go have a run if you’re that worked up about me sharing my experience online man."
ProRevenge,fdk70et,t1_fdk3x7d,1578497522.0,"I posted it there too, I’ve only had this app for 11 days, trying to still figure out all this stuff. I guess without context if the actual job i did it does seem like I was “complying” to what he wanted, but had I not taken the actions I did he would have gotten away with it. We were very limited in what we could do, so my “revenge” was doing what I could to make sure he actually fucked himself if he tried to get his money back. That was the whole point of the note I left on his account."
EntitledBitch,fdk6qle,t1_fdk6g49,1578497344.0,"Not sure what state you live in but I would have been happy if I was allowed to tell people no. My store had a policy were we could not deny a money transfer, we could only warn them of suspicious behavior, as long as it was in the legal limit of sending we couldn’t deny it. This was also almost 3-4 years ago. Glad you guys have better rules now, but don’t try and tell me my “training didn’t take” that’s fucking rude. they made us take extra courses and training just for CS and I followed all the rules."
ProRevenge,fdjquos,t1_fdjqs6v,1578484002.0,Ok ok I’ll post it there happy 😂

legaladvice,fc85jpm,t3_egfj3z,1577527343.0,"Update: thank you to everybody who commented in my time of crisis, I called my insurance and throughout the whole day I’ve been getting pieces of the story. Turns out they tried to settle a amount of money for her but she refused to take the money from my insurance for what I can only assume “not being enough” and now she’s attempting to sue me. I called the number on the form and it ended up being her attorney who was trying to advise me to handle it myself, thank god I didn’t because I would have been in the shithole if I didn’t call my insurance. 

The letter I received is a summons, and they’re waiting for me or my insurance to contact them before they make a court date.  My insurance is suppose to get ahold of their “legal department” and they’re suppose to call me with more info. 

I talked to close friends and somebody had a similar experience in which the person drove home before calling the police, they only ended up only paying court fees. They said the lady tried to pull a bunch of nonsense like saying they were “texting and driving” when they weren’t and lying about them not wearing a seatbelt when there was proof they were. I just hope this crazy bitch doesn’t try to pull anything or set me up, like it’s scary to think she’s content enough on trying to ruin my life, what else is she going to pull. I vividly remember her walking around the entire time and then yelling at the cops that she wanted to go home, and she ended up signing a form saying she was ok to drive herself home, and the cops were completely over her acting, one female cop even came up to me (I’m a female as well) and we had a girl moment where I could clearly see her frustration, and she assured me that she signed a form saying she was fine. I don’t know if that matters or changes anything, but hopefully the Judge can see this is a money grab."
