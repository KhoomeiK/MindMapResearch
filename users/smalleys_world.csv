I feel for instance depression and anxiety medications eventually make someone angry instead of sad, or numb instead of responsive, and after a while I think it does more harm than good.

Nobody sees anything special or different in white people besides maybe the “wage gap” that they pretend we have so much more than the rest of the people in the world - which might be true 55% of the time, but if the other 45% is viewed as white trash wastes of space that don’t deserve basic rights especially in our own country that immigrants get by social services, or don’t even deserve to be given a chance at the same jobs immigrants get here magically, I don’t get how people could get so mad at townies who just happen to be white, getting mad at the establishment for giving everything else to newcomers for free, when they are slaving away just to eat. That’s what I don’t get. White people immigrated here for hundreds of years, and now all the sudden poor white townies “had their fair chance” and don’t matter anymore and if we say or do something about us displaying how poor Broken and messed up our lives all are we are the racists and need to stop complaining. I am all for immigration and allowing people here from everywhere else, but if I am just white trash that deserves nothing even though I do everything I can it gives me no hope to ever have a family one day. But that’s the thing, I wouldn’t have a kid and expect the world to take care of them, but when it comes down to the basic science and math it’s completely unsustainable to have a child in this country, and yet to foreigners moving here they can find a way to do it and not suffer, it just makes you wonder where and who really controls America. Last year I worked every day 7-4 at a preschool of children from all over the world, for minimum wage, where if I did anything out of line I could go to jail, and it still for the whole year, a third of what I was paid was my family’s taxes for the year. When the only jobs more than minimum wage are saved for people in debt from degrees or with children, it makes me really wonder and be afraid of what America will be like in another 10 years. Plus with all the people moving here from New York City (I live in ct) we have a serious wage gap of the stock exchange people and the people who can barely pay their bills even with 3 jobs, and then the people collecting from the government, I just don’t feel this is a world I would ever want to have a child in."

They say it was for mono atomic gold which was used for space travel. Very likely could have been the port and many of where they picked stuff up from.
