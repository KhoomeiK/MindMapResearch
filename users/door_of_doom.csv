Where they able to attend and mount a defense during their grand jury indictment? has any criminal indictment ever in the history of criminal law ever had the accused present to mount a defense? Up untill now this is the only part of the process that has happened, and Trump has had MORE access to the grand jury process than eveyr single other grand jury process in the history of criminal law.

So in what way again has trump had a *less* fair legal proceeding, given that he has had MORE access to the process than anyone involved in 9/11 had?"

Just because something isn't bad doesn't mean it is automatically the best play available to you, and if you do have a better play available to you you should okay those, but what other hunter 5 drop would be better than this? Explosive shot I guess? Unless the treants have been buffed to 3/3, in which case this is *still* a better 5 drop against token druid.

If a 5 drop's worst matchup is still better than every other 5 drop on that same situation, that is pretty freaking good."

And it isn't like this is doing *nothing*, it *is* still removing a thing, which makes it a better matchup than *most* cards which *don't* kill something.

Yes, if token druid has set up their win condition for next turn, the only thing you can do is to play something that disrupts that win condition, and this isn't that.  But it's not like a card is only good if it can disrupt *every* win condition equally.  What's more, removing a single minion *could* be the difference between lethal and not, so again, it is *still* better than *most* cards at disrupting that win condition."

hearthstone,ff72y9h,t1_ff6jkkv,1579640069.0,">Compare it to Acolyte of Pain for a second

Okay.

>You get 1 more attack

Which is a really, really big difference.  doubling something's attack so that it can accomplish in 1 attack what another minion requires 2 to do is a big deal. 3/2 is an extremely common stateline, and acolyte of pain trades *terribly* into it.

>and you get a boombot rather than getting a card

Which, again, is a *huge* difference.  Tempo is the name of the game in standard warrior at the moment, NOT card advantage. Card advantage is nice, no question, but card advantage is a means to an end: controlling the board.  

What would you rather have: a card when when it takes damage allows you to draw a card that, when played, might help you take the board?  Or a card that when it takes damage allows you to help take the board?

One of these cards requires you do play additional cards before you can actually take board control.  the other one just helps take control of the board.

Let's put it another way: Acolyte of pain is only good because the other cards in your deck are good, and Acolyte of pain is allowing you to draw those good cards.  Well, this card right here is one of those good cards that you are going to be hoping that your acolyte of pain draws for you.

You know what you *aren't* hoping your acolyte of pain draws for you?  another acolyte of pain. Because acolyte of pain doesn't actually acocmplish anything, it only allows you to draw that cars that *do* accomplish things.

Lets put it another way: who do you think would win, a deck of 30 Acolyte of Pain or a deck of 30 Bomb Wranglers.

the 30 bomb wranglers would literally win every singe game in a massive, humongous landslide."

If this card sees play, using it on your hero power will be the absolute worst way to use this card ever and would only be done out of pure desperation for any semblance of tempo."

comics,fezapje,t1_feyxzok,1579455425.0,"What an absolutely riveting read.  I'll post a section here for anyone who can't be bothered to click a link, because it is worth it:

>In line with their planned diversion to Winnipeg, the pilots were already descending through 35,000 feet (11,000 m) when the second engine shut down. They immediately searched their emergency checklist for the section on flying the aircraft with both engines out, only to find that no such section existed. Captain Pearson was an experienced glider pilot, so he was familiar with flying techniques almost never used in commercial flight. To have the maximum range and therefore the largest choice of possible landing sites, he needed to fly the 767 at the optimum glide speed. Making his best guess as to this speed for the 767, he flew the aircraft at 220 knots (410 km/h; 250 mph). First Officer Maurice Quintal began to calculate whether they could reach Winnipeg. He used the altitude from one of the mechanical backup instruments, while the distance traveled was supplied by the air traffic controllers in Winnipeg, measured by the aircraft's radar echo observed at Winnipeg. In 10 nautical miles (19 km; 12 mi) the aircraft lost 5,000 feet (1,500 m), giving a glide ratio of approximately 12:1 (dedicated glider planes reach ratios of 50:1 to 70:1).

>At this point, Quintal proposed landing at the former RCAF Station Gimli, a closed air force base where he had once served as a pilot for the Royal Canadian Air Force. Unbeknownst to Quintal or to the air traffic controller, a part of the facility had been converted to a race track complex, now known as Gimli Motorsports Park. It included a road race course, a go-kart track, and a dragstrip. A Canadian Automobile Sport Clubs-sanctioned sports car race hosted by the Winnipeg Sports Car Club was underway at the time of the incident and the area around the decommissioned runway was full of cars and campers. Part of the decommissioned runway was being used to stage the race.

>Without main power, the pilots used a gravity drop, which causes gravity to lower the landing gear and lock it into place. The main gear locked into position, but the nose wheel did not; this later turned out to be advantageous. As the aircraft slowed on approach to landing, the reduced power generated by the ram air turbine rendered the aircraft increasingly difficult to control.

>As the plane drew near the runway, it became apparent that the aircraft was coming in too high and fast, raising the danger of the 767 running off the runway before it could be stopped. The lack of hydraulic pressure prevented flap/slat extension that would have, under normal landing conditions, reduced the stall speed of the aircraft and increased the lift coefficient of the wings to allow the airliner to be slowed for a safe landing. The pilots briefly considered a 360-degree turn to reduce speed and altitude, but they decided that they did not have enough altitude for the manoeuvre. Pearson decided to execute a forward slip to increase drag and lose altitude. This manoeuvre is commonly used in gliders and light aircraft to descend more quickly without increasing forward speed, but it is practically never executed in large jet airliners outside of rare circumstances like those of this flight.

>Complicating matters yet further was the fact that with both of its engines out, the plane made virtually no noise during its approach. People on the ground thus had no advanced warning of the impromptu landing and little time to flee. As the gliding plane closed in on the decommissioned runway, the pilots noticed that there were two boys riding bicycles within 1,000 feet (300 m) of the projected point of impact. Captain Pearson would later remark that the boys were so close that he could see the looks of sheer terror on their faces as they realized that a commercial airliner was bearing down on them.

>Two factors helped avert disaster: the failure of the front landing gear to lock into position during the gravity drop, and the presence of a guardrail that had been installed along the centre of the repurposed runway to facilitate its use as a drag race track. As soon as the wheels touched down on the runway, Pearson braked hard, skidding and promptly blowing out two of the aircraft's tires. The unlocked nose wheel collapsed and was forced back into its well, causing the aircraft's nose to slam into, bounce off, and then scrape along the ground. This additional friction helped to slow the airplane and kept it from careening into the crowds surrounding the runway. After the airliner had touched down, the nose began to scrape along the guardrail in the centre of the race track, creating additional frictional drag that helped to decelerate the plane; Pearson applied extra right brake, which caused the main landing gear to straddle the guardrail. Air Canada Flight 143 came to a final stop on the ground 17 minutes after running out of fuel.

>There were no serious injuries among the 61 passengers or the people on the ground. As the aircraft's nose had collapsed onto the ground, its tail was elevated and there were some minor injuries when passengers exited the aircraft via the rear slides, which were not long enough to sufficiently accommodate the increased height. A minor fire in the nose area was extinguished by racers and course workers equipped with portable fire extinguishers."

It's a very unique feeling that I experienced in WoW unlike anything else. And it's entirely because of that consequence of failure looming over you.

So, I have indeed felt the same way, and I am inclined to agree.

However, I have a *really* hard time accepting a system that is still quite punishing (even if nowhere near as punishing as the community makes it out to be) when circumstances completely beyond your control screw you over: You DC, a glitch happens in the game, etc.

MMO's are notoriously buggy, and not propperly taking that into account when designing your systems seems like a bad move.  

I would very much like them to keep the current design, but, like, double the number of Horrific Visions that can be run in a week (maybe double is exxessive but you get the point).  Keep all the same caps, all the same gates, but give give people more attempts than they already have, just to *really* make sure that some bug or connection issue isn't just *really* royally screwing over some people out there.

wow,feio08r,t1_feie1f8,1579142999.0,You think that Horrific Visions don't offer any kind of challenge?  I just wanted to make sure I understand what you are saying.
wow,feinwaw,t1_feif75a,1579142927.0,"You are misunderstanding the person you replied to, so let's clear something up:

First of all, to set something straight that you are probably already aware of, there is a hard limit to how high your cloak can be on any given week.  This week, the Cloak simply cannot be leveled up higher than Rank 6. This has nothing to do with not being able to run enough Horrific Visions , this is simply a hard cap in the game: the quest to level your cloak past 6 is not available, regardless  of how mnay keys you have access to.

Next week, that cap is raised only to 7.  If you got capped this week, you would *still* get access to 3 keys, but only be able to upgrade your cloak once.  The same follows for next week.

So there very much is a hard limit on how far ahead a grinder can get on their cloak, set by the game.  You may know this already, but for the sake of being on the same page, I wanted to make it clear.

That being said, what the person you are replying to is advocating for ISN'T to change any aspect of this.  It is simply to be able to do a ""practice run"" that costs nothing but also rewards nothing.  This would let you practice and train and plan for when you want to actually spend currency and make an attempt at a ""real"" run for a chance at actual rewards.  Given how wide the disparity is between how many keys you get per week vs how many upgrades you can get per week (3 keys to get 1 upgrade), this doesn't seem like it is all that warranted, but I can still understand the value in it and see the desire to feel like you know what you are doing before committing quite a bit of currency top a run.

So the objections that you have aren't exactly relevant to what he was advocating for, even though your concerns are meritorious in their own regard."

The people working in the tunnels aren't the ones making the tech investments (i.e safety purchases), their bosses are.

This is one of those things that is put in contracts because why not, but in reality isn't *really* enforceable as such.  They do *actually* have to have some kind of logical and reasonable reason to revoke a licence. ""Because we wanted to"" is not a valid reason.

Imagine if You paid Sony $60 for a licence for one of their games, and they gave it to you, and for no reason whatsoever revoked that licence 4 seconds later.  Such a purchase contract would not hold up in *any* count *anywhere.*

It also just doesn't make any sense when you stop and think about it.  Music only has ~5 ways to actually make anybody any money:

1) Advertisement subsidizes the ability for the radio station to pay the requisite fees to play music in order to entice people to listen to said advertising.

2) Subscriptions subsidize the ability for the radio station to pay the requisite fees to play music in order to entice people to pay the subscription fee

3) Direct music sales, where people directly pay for the rights to listen to specific songs whenever they want

4) Live concerts, where people pay money to see the artist perform live

5) Merchandise, where people who like an artist pay for merchandise that allows them to express their love of that artist.

The thing that all of these things have in common is that *they only work if people actually like the music* Nobody can force any consumer to participate in *any* of the above markets, and people only ever *will* participate int he above markets if they actually like the music that is pulling them into that market.

If people don't like the music your station plays, they wont listed to the station and you station won't be able to sell any adds.  It doesn't matter if your station is part of the iHeartMedia conglomerate, iHeartMedia makes it's money from selling adds, which it can only do if people like the music they play.  They are even less likely to pay for a subscription to your station/music service.

If they don't like the music, nobody is going to buy your album.  Nobody is going to your concerts.  Nobody is buying your merch.

The *only* thing that makes a song/artist a ""hit"" is that song/artists ability to get people to listen to adds, pay subscription, buy albums, go to concerts, and buy merch.  If it can't do any of that, it bombs.  if it does, it hits.  Nobody can force it."

Meanwhile, bosses very regularly do mechanics where it is very clear what you need to accomplish, but HOW you accomplish it is going to very based on that resources your raid has available. As a very simple example, Azshara spawns adds that you have to prevent from reaching the middle of the room. It's clear WHAT to do, but HOW you do it depends on your guild's particular strategy.

If two players were to hit refresh at the exact same time and there were only 1 copy of a minion left in the pool, that minion would not be offered to both players.  It is not hard to design the back end servers to handle refresh requests quickly yet at the same time sequentially.

>nor was he forced to be so thin and skinny by the government

An interesting stance to take.  He was being held illegally and ""sentanced"" through a mockery of a trial.  In order to get his rightfully owed freedom back, he staged a hunger strike as a way to hold the government accountable for his well being.  What's more is that it worked:  The Government knew that if he died in their custody, it would draw attention to their illegal actions, and so they consequently sent him home. So you could say that he wasn't ""forced"", but when it is the only viable way of getting your freedom back, it kind of is.

When you are put in a situation where you are going to be imprisoned indefinitely unless you stage a hunger strike... you are kind of forced to go on a hunger strike.
