HongKong,fe8ufam,t3_eo1qlx,1578931065.0,"From what I’m reading he was in a police building. So he could have been trying to escape. That would explain why he threw his bag out first. He could have tried a controlled descent from beam to beam all the way down. Like if it’s a risky escape or jail time the risky escape could be attempted. The odd way he jumped out though might be attributed to the small size of the window, or maybe a struggle as police tried to pull him back in. I get that police in Hong Kong are pretty shitty atm, but It’s always been high stress level situations where people are killed. This would have to be pre-planned murder. I’m open to any other reasoning though."

news,fdehgib,t1_fddt1j7,1578339106.0,Ultra-Orthodox Jews and the brooklyn black community have a lot of tension since forever. The orthodox own a lot of the land and there’s a history of violence. In the 80s(?) an orthodox accidentally ran over black children and that I believe caused most of the damage. Also both community cultures are so not meant for each other. Orthodox Jews who have the curls by the ears are known to be literally the worse people.

If anything the status quo of terrorist funding and proxy conflict will continue. Quaseem Suliemani is responsible for the deaths of many, and Iranian moves in the middle east have been poking the bear for months now (Saudi Oil Bombing, Attacks in Iraq, Embassy Storming).

StarWars,fcjq0uv,t3_ehfbhg,1577698835.0,"I totally get where your coming from, I too noticed that people were fine with baby yoda's force healing but not Reys. There are a couple reasons why baby yoda works as a powerful force user.

* He is 50 so he had time to learn, and the show really reminds you that the baby is old.
* He is a yoda type, so he has precedent to be powerful.
* His powers are seldom used to affect plot, we've only seem him save a couple people.
* He is still vulnerable, and the plot centers around people who want to exploit him.
* He isn't the main protagonist, so he doesn't need to earn more power as the story goes along the same way mando did when he got new armor or a jetpack etc.

With the sequels, there was a failure to show growth in the protagonist, or give precedent to her power. For example..

* Rey is a good fighter and it makes sense for her, but they barely show her using her staff to fight. 
* Rey is a natural pilot, which is fine, but even she is surprised that she out-maneuvered first order pilots.
* Rey doesn't learn her powers, she just constantly realizes her power, and for the first two movies she is a nobody. The lightning hands was fine, because it made sense in context of what her arc was going through, but she constantly is mastering new powers in the moment she needs them, which can be annoying. 

Ultimately the sequels had horrible character arcs, presumably because they didn't plan one. Meanwhile The Mandalorian has star wars nerd Dave Filoni and seasoned sci-fi director/Chef John Fav on board."
