Well, one week ago my backpack was on the couch and it fell (my laptop was inside). I will check it.

Thanks."

In high school I was friend with some women and every time they asked me for my honest opinion they got mad. 

> If you joke with a woman the same way she jokes with you, you're ""bullying"" her 

I understand that too. This girl used to make some jokes about me and when I returned them she used to stop talking to me. I mean, if you can't handle the heat stay out of the kitchen.

Overall, I agree with everything you said. And I don't really care if my behavior irl comes as a  misogynist. I treat women and men equally, and if women don't like it they can fuck off."

introvert,fdf985z,t3_el0wfk,1578356261.0,"I don't crave human connection that much either. I have been single 8 years and I have never felt lonely (In fact, I don't think I ever felt it in my whole life). Also, I just have 3 friends to which I don't see very often. I don't text them or call them. I don't feel the need. Since I have memory I have always been like this.

For example, the last time I spoke to two of them was 2 months ago.

If you were not by nature like this, then I would say you must be very introspective about it. There are people who try to convince themself they are happy alone when it is not true, but if you truly are, then I don't think there is any problem. 

But again, if you were not by nature like this, be introspective about it."

We even have ""witches"". People visit them to ask them favors (mostly money and love, and sometimes a cure for an illness).

When I was a teenager I was subject to a ritual without realizing it. This girl sent me love letters with marks of blood. Days later I found that it was a ritual to make me fall in love with her.

Even if you explain to them no to do that, sooner or later they will do it. ""Dark magic"" abounds a lot here."

Yes, you are right. That is not an excuse. 

It seems that he is desperate to find love and that makes him fall on girls very quickly. Which is bad, because that kind of persons tends to be very clingy.

He needs to know how to handle those feelings and not be too pushy. He needs therapy. And given his history with other girls, he is not ready to start a serious relationship. He is far from it.

And again, even if he is unaware of his behavior, it is not right."

Red flag.

You said he is not a bad person, but if he is trying to push a relationship on you then he is. Maybe he is unaware of it, but still, that's a red flag.
