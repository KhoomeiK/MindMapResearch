nottheonion,ff5ft7o,t1_ff54jyu,1579590992.0,"Denmark has high household debt levels but more than makes up for it with Danish households having more assets and robust finances to their name. According to the Danish central bank:


>**Does high debt make Danish households vulnerable?**



>The larger the debt is, the higher the expenses will be for interest and principal payments. Consequently, a large debt can put a strain on household finances, especially if the household is hit by unpredicted events such as unemployment or illness. The combination of higher debt and increased use of adjustable-rate loans also means that household finances have become more sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates than previously. Analyses by Danmarks Nationalbank and others show that the vast majority of Danish households have robust finances and are resilient to an interest-rate hike or a prolonged period of unemployment. Most families have sufficient scope in their budgets to be able to handle e.g. rising interest expenses at their current income levels. Others have savings that they can eat into if their incomes are not quite sufficient, even for longer periods. The share of households with robust finances is particularly high among those with mortgage debt. It is relevant to focus on this group, as mortgage debt accounts for the lion's share of household debt. The ability and willingness of households to service their mortgage loans are very robust, and even among families with squeezed finances only very few fall into arrears. At the macroeconomic level, this indicates that even a severe setback in the Danish economy would lead to only a very limited increase in the number of households that do not service their mortgage debt. One of the reasons is that mortgage debt is typically the last debt item on which a family chooses to default. For other loans, including bank loans, the number of households in arrears will presumably rise much more if the Danish economy is hit by a severe setback


#


>**No serious threat to financial stability**

>Danmarks Nationalbank's analyses show that household debt is not a serious threat to financial stability. This is particularly true in relation to mortgage banks. The vast majority of households with high debt levels are financially robust, and as far as mortgage debt is concerned, the repayment ability of households has proved to be robust. But (non-mortgage) banks are likely to see a stronger increase in losses if the Danish economy is hit by a severe setback. A special issue relates to the use of mortgage bonds with short maturities for financing the households' adjustable-rate loans. Mortgage loans of this type have become very popular with households and therefore the volume of mortgage bonds to be sold every year has surged. Consequently, the mortgage banks' refinancing risk has increased.

>Indeed, average annual costs per person hit $10,345 in 2016. In 1960, the average cost per person was only [$146](http://www.justfacts.com/healthcare.asp) — and, adjusting for inflation, that means costs are nine times higher now than they were then.


#


>That means that, last year, the average family paid $9,996 for coverage alone, and, if they met their deductible, a total of just under $18,000. Meanwhile, an average individual spent $3,852 on coverage and, if she spent another $4,358 to meet her deductible, a total of $8,210.


>These figures do not take into account any additional [co-insurance](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/co-insurance/) responsibility she might have.

If what the above poster said is true, then the most expensive German public plan (including children, which I assume is a family plan) is below average in cost when compared to equivalent American plans which I assume also cover less with all sorts of unnecessary caveats and expenses (out-of-network, co-insurances, co-pays, deductibles, etc.)"

>In 2004, a study by the Institut de l'enterprise investigated why several European countries were eliminating wealth taxes and made the following observations: 1. Wealth taxes contributed to capital drain, promoting the flight of capital as well as discouraging investors from coming in. 2. Wealth taxes had high management cost and relatively low returns. 3. Wealth taxes distorted resource allocation, particularly involving certain exemptions and unequal valuation of assets. In its summary, the institute found that the ""wealth taxes were not as equitable as they appeared"".[[38]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax#cite_note-hluthafar.is-38)

>In a 2011 study, the London School of Economics examined wealth taxes that were being considered by the Labour party in the United Kingdom between 1974 and 1976 but were ultimately abandoned. The findings of the study revealed that the British evaluated similar programs in other countries and determined that the Spanish wealth tax may have contributed to a banking crisis and the French wealth tax had been undergoing review by its government for being unpopular and overly complex. As efforts progressed, concerns were developing over the practicality and implementation of wealth taxes as well as worry that they would undermine confidence in the British economy. Eventually plans were dropped. Former British Chancellor [Denis Healey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Healey) concluded that attempting to implement wealth taxes was a mistake, ""We had committed ourselves to a Wealth Tax: but in five years I found it impossible to draft one which would yield enough revenue to be worth the administrative cost and political hassle."" The conclusion of the study stated that there were lingering questions, such as the impacts on personal saving and small business investment, consequences of capital flight, complexity of implementation, and ability to raise predicted revenues that must be adequately addressed before further consideration of wealth taxes.[[39]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax#cite_note-eprints.lse.ac.uk-39)
