relationships,ff7hqwn,t1_ff7h3h2,1579649833.0,Exactly. Respect and support are obviously so important in a relationship but become imperative when complex decisions and compromises need to be made.
antidiet,ff7hes1,t3_es31g9,1579649610.0,"Is it possible to have it altered? You could get it taken out a bit or, if there isn't enough seam allowance, add in new panels on the side or back to make it a size that fits and flatters your body just as it is now? You could even modify it with a new belt or patches of new fabric. A way of rebranding it as a great dress that is meant for your body just as it is right now and help you see it as a different garment than the one that you attach with your diet phase.

If you decide it's best to get rid of it (I don't have tips on helping with that decision - sorry), please consider selling it instead of donating it. Only a fraction of donated garments are sold and reused. By selling it you are giving it a better chance to be bought and worn by someone who might love the dress as much as you did. And that might help with finding gratitude in its new purpose."
relationships,ff7gj9r,t1_ff79tvt,1579649031.0,"Excellent points. Just wanted to add an anecdote about compromise with partners. 

My husband and I got married right out of college at 22 (which looking back is insane and young but the right choice for us). We were planning our futures around each other as we both looked for grad schools (in different fields). We worked very hard to consider locations that would be good for both careers. We ended up going to a place that I probably wouldn't have even looked into had my husband not been interested in a grad program there. I ended up turning down an offer at a prestigious school because I felt that the place we settled on would be better for his career in the long run and wasn't a bad option for me. I was initially really worried about that decision.

The thing is, the program I went into was the best possible place for me and my career. My advisor is my idol and I feel so privileged to get to work with and learn from her and it has set me up for success moving forward. And my husband has thrived here too. It worked out better than we could have hoped and I'm really glad I considered compromise.

We are now looking to move for the next step in my career and looking at places where we can both thrive. It's that same process. While we are primarily focused on my next job we are only considering locations in which my husband will be able to find good work. 

Our goal in the end is to make sure we reach a solution in which everyone is happy and thriving. And we are each willing to make some compromises to ensure that. 

So I guess my rambly story is just to say when you have a good match the two body problem becomes way less difficult to navigate. Because you are both working for the success of your team. But it all depends on your priorities and how much compromise fits within those priorities."
books,ff6weam,t1_ff6e8y0,1579636263.0,I was thinking about this recently. I have always been a little embarrassed by how slowly I read. But recently I had an epiphany. I read so much technical literature for my work and if I'm not reading I'm critically thinking. It's exhausting. Books I read in my spare time are for pleasure. And you know what pleases me? Reading slowly and savoring the story in a work of fiction or mulling over the concepts in non fiction. I'm not reading to impress anyone and I'm not reading to be productive. So I'm going to read and slowly as I want (and have my Kindle text as big as I damn well please - something that bothers my husband lol)
movies,ff5btkw,t3_erpb3h,1579586547.0,"For those that liked this movie I highly recommend the book ""Station Eleven"". It's about before, during, and after a flu epidemic that collapsed society (before, during, and after timelines told concurrently to unravel a mystery).

It's one of my favorite books. It is pretty realistic in terms of a disease epidemic resulting in societal collapse and has great story telling."
Marriage,ff3oc8m,t3_ergqyf,1579545352.0,"We are lucky to live in a time when married couples get to choose from a variety of name options that suit them and their priorities. Here are some examples I have from heterosexual couples.

1. Wife legally takes husband's name: kids have husband's name

2. Wife legally (and professionally) keeps her name but around friends and family goes by husband's name: kids have husband's name

3. Wife hyphenates her name and husband's name. husband doesn't change name: kids take hyphenated name or husband's name

4. Wife and husband both change to hyphenated name: kids take hyphenated name

5. No one changes names: kids take husband or wife's name

6. Husband takes wife's name: kids take wife's name.

7. Husband legally (and professionally) keeps his name but around friends and family goes by wife's name: kids have wife's name

8. You both change your names to a new family name that you chose together.

All of these are are equally valid and appropriate. You can mix and match to fit whatever your priorities are. Just because something is a tradition doesn't mean it's right for you. That is you, as the woman, don't have to change your name. And asking you husband to change his name doesn't make him less of man. What's important is that you both come to a decision that you both feel comfortable with and fits your priorities. 

If your name is really important to you, don't feel pressured to change it. If your husband doesn't feel particularly attached to his name what is stopping you from making your family name your maiden name?"
science,fep2nvt,t1_feoodnh,1579310774.0,"So, first, there are two main types of primary scientific literature. Research articles and literature reviews. 

The research articles are novel research. Usually the results are giving us that incremental change I was talking about. These can be dense and difficult to understand if you aren't trained in the field.

Literature reviews are a synthesis of many research articles. Scientists will write a review/commentary about the research in a specific field or on a specific topic (e.g. fat consumption and disease risk). These are a nice overview because they explain a topic given the current research. They are able to overview studies that seemed sensational on their own but are much more measured when discussed alongside other studies.

While literature reviews are written by and for scientists I think it's still worth non-scientists to try and read them. If you've been working through a literature review and even with supplemental research find yourself struggling to grasp something - contact the authors. Ask if they or someone in their lab could answer some questions about their work. The worst that could happen is that they don't respond. Most likely they will be really flattered or excited that people are interested in their work (something that they are really passionate about).

Second, where do you find these? Unfortunately many are behind paywall. However open access (freely available to anyone) is becoming more common. To search any field google scholar is great (scholar.google.com) for specifically medical papers pubmed central is the best place to search."
science,feolcuf,t1_feo7hxb,1579301777.0,Not really. There are studies like this that come out and we view as game changers or at least highly informative for our body of work. The big difference is that scientists recognize that most science is incremental (by design) and we understand how these increments fit within the broader context. Most are also trained to critically evaluate the quality of studies and weigh the limitations of the study design with the strength of the fundings giving a much more measured response.

TwoXChromosomes,felhjyj,t1_feku4pt,1579222330.0,Lol I would say I should read more books that will help with my spelling but I read so much and nothing helps. I rely on well spelling _losers_ like you to help correct me. ;)
TwoXChromosomes,fek8p9o,t1_fek6g3l,1579194934.0,"Totally agree with your points, but I just wanted to chime in that I'm that loser that reads cookbooks like a novel.

vegan,fefjge0,t1_fef110q,1579057604.0,I didn't know that about Kuwait but it makes so much sense. I was there recently and it wasn't too difficult to find vegan food but it wasn't easy.

academia,feetrpy,t1_fedqbvk,1579041036.0,"If your mental health is not managed you are setting yourself up for failure. Why start now when you are unprepared and not wait a year or two when you have a better attitude and are more prepared? 

For context. I started my PhD in fine mental health. I was suicidal by my 2nd year. It wasn't because of a toxic program or lab (my advisor is amazing and supportive) but it was so mentally taxing that when some personal issues came up they spiraled out of control.

Same supportive lab, one of my labmates went missing for weeks. When I found him he was in bad shape. His depression became unmanageable.

Another person who started the same year as me (coming in with tenuous mental health - not well controlled depression) quit before reaching candidacy.

These are just three anecdotes but they are representative of the actual peer reviewed statistics on this issue. 

If your therapy isn't working for you it's time to try a different approach (new therapist, meds, more frequent treatment). Your depression is controllable and it should be controlled before starting a PhD to set yourself up for success."
academia,fedhcja,t1_fedg564,1579011539.0,"You need to get in that ASAP. Seriously. I don't want to discourage you from doing a PhD. Depression does not preclude you from successfully completing one.

Having a good handle on your mental health, strategies, and warning signs before you start is imperative for success."
Futurology,fe95x00,t1_fe8uqdz,1578934611.0,">meat is actually one of the best things for your body at a cheap price

That is literally not true - that is not what the scientific literature says. That is propaganda given to us by the meat industry (because of course they want is to think it's the epitome of healthy food)."
femalefashionadvice,fe4n404,t3_enqu5y,1578861005.0,"I didn't have any teaching requirements for my PhD so I can't speak to teaching outfits. But I have been working, throughout the course of my degree, to a more professional wardrobe. It's not a requirement (everyone dresses so casually in my university and city in general) but I like the style better and I enjoyed feeling like a grown up professional even though I'm in the 21st grade. So I limit the number of days per week I'll wear jeans and if I do I choose a dark wash. Part of the benefit is that I prefer to dress up for presentations and if I'm used to dressing a little bit more professionally a suit doesn't feel foreign or uncomfortable. I see my boss (tenure track professor) do the same thing - her style is very professional casual: lots of skirts and slacks with cotton tops/blouses and sweaters."
todayilearned,fe4iecu,t1_fdx5x5h,1578859613.0,"You should shoot for about 30+ gram per day (if you have gut problems though talk to your doctor - with certain conditions high fiber consumption is not recommended). I recommend using a diet tracking app to see what you are currently consuming and work your way up to 30 to avoid discomfort.

You make a good start for what sounds like breakfast but that won't nearly be enough to hit a healthy fiber threshold (it's really hard on a western diet to get enough).

You should incorporate lots of whole grains. They have lots of combo of fiber (complex carbs) and protein that are very good for you and for your microbiome.  

Another great and healthful choice is beans and legumes. They are packed with a healthful combo of fiber (complex carbs) and protein.

[Having a variety of vegetables](http://www.thegoodgut.org/eating-for-gut-health-variety-not-quantity-of-vegetables-is-key/) is also very good for your microbiome but not necessarily for the fiber (there's less fiber in veggies than you'd think). So eat your veggies because they are good for you and your gut but focus on grains and legumes for your fiber and protein.

Just an added soap box on carbs: don't let the low carb propaganda get to you. Yes, simple carbs as bad for you. White flour and sugar is not healthful. However, complex carbs are actually really good for you and come along with lots of other good-for-you nutrients so don't shy away from carbs necessarily (fiber is a complex carb and it's really good for us)."
todayilearned,fdwprvu,t1_fdvua1d,1578761206.0,"You don't necessarily want/need them as an adult. As babies grow their microbiome changes. At about 3 is stabilizes to roughly what it will be for the rest of your life (there will be small changes with natural lifestyle changes and medical interventions) but unless you drastically change your diet you microbiome is roughly locked in.

So HMOs are good for the type of microbiome that babies have, but its going to be less important or effective in an adult microbiome (certain health contexts exempt).

What you'd be better off doing is eating a diet that is good for a healthy adult microbiome. That includes low fat and high fiber - emphasis on the fiber and plant based sources of protein."
todayilearned,fdwnrws,t1_fdvn1e8,1578760613.0,Fiber! Take a fiber supplement(s) with a variety of fibers and eat plenty of fruits and veggies and cool it on the fats and protein.

namenerds,fdnyktl,t3_emcalr,1578595473.0,"My friend has a 4 year old named Hildegard. They usually call her Hildy. Friend is an ethnomusicologist so the name was inspired by Hildegard von Bingen. Knowing little Hildy's parents I'm confident that she too will grow up to be a strong, likely outspoken, and probably artistic woman who can carry a name like that well. 

It's a nice name (it's on my short list for girls names) but seriously consider who you and your partner are (your personalities and home that you raise your kids in have an impact). Do you think your future child will be someone who can gracefully carry a name that will come with constant comments about it? Are you setting you child up for success as an adult or are you picking a name that you think sounds cute for a baby?"
highereducation,fdnn4cd,t1_fdnh8ak,1578589244.0,Your age doesn't raise a red flag. It actually makes you more likely to be looked at in any program worth their salt. In advanced programs admissions are very important. My program takes a max of 5 people each year. Some years we only take 2. It's important that who we accept can handle the rigors of an advanced degree. Just because someone isn't a good candidate at that point doesn't mean they never will be. But it's not worth their time to struggle when a few years of experience is usually a fix and they have a much easier time. Being older usually indicates more maturity and fortitude and self drive which is appealing to programs.
books,fdngz7s,t3_em5s00,1578585596.0,"One of my favorite books. It was quite literally life changing. It struck something deep in me that made me realize I wanted to work for NASA. I have an interview at JPL next month. Books have such power.

vegan,fdgwsq6,t1_fdgqmiw,1578410261.0,"My most recent rescue (one that had been roaming freely on the streets and was in very bad shape when found) is a very human attached breed. He desires to sleep, eat, and mostly to be with us. We take him for several long walks a day but he looses enthusiasm about it if he's outside for too long - he's a homebody.

I saw a sick and scared animal in need of love and medical care and I wanted to extend a home he needed. He does not desire to spend time roaming outside and if he did it would be dangerous for him (raptors, cars, snakes, malicious people, coyotes, his own lack of a survival instinct)."
vegan,fdey43m,t3_ekwclb,1578349062.0,"At dinner with my in laws this weekend, my husband mentioned that our fav vegan place has great ""chicken"" and waffles. My FIL could not wrap his head around that statement. He thought my husband had started eating meat again because the vegan restaurant probably had a meat option for the non-vegans who might want to eat there.

Afterwards my husband was joking that as a middle-aged, upper middle class, white man his dad was used to being the ""default"" person and that as someone who eats animal products with every meal and snack could not fathom not having something he wanted to eat available at a restaurant."
Marriage,fdeuecl,t1_fdeqa23,1578346808.0,"In addition to the discussion questions you brought up I also suggest talking about your expectations for vacation. It seems insignificant but it was a big factor in a friend's divorce. One wanted to make travel a top priority and the other, while they still loved travel, wanted to prioritize building savings. That precipitated lots of fighting and a breakdown spiral.

Another topic to expand on your living situation suggestions - talk about home ownership. Is is something you want? When? What are you willing to sacrifice for it? (I have seen a marriage fall apart with home ownership as the precipitating factor)."
Marriage,fdedy8e,t3_ekxs5q,1578336928.0,"I got married at 22 and had no idea what that commitment really meant despite feeling like I did. It wasn't a bad decision by any means. We are happier, stronger, and more in love 5 years later. 

Even though we made the right decision we made it for naive and uninformed reasons. Looking back I wish I had done more reading and prep together before we made the decision. I'm not sure why I feel that way - I've never regretting getting married young. I just dove in blissfully unaware of how big and important and awesome what we were doing was.

I will also say that I had 4 friends get married at 22 as well. 2 of the couples divorced after 1 year and the other 2 are still together. It's my evaluation that the two couples did not have a bad relationship before marriage (they had been together for a long time) but they weren't good partners for what is required in a marriage. Their long term goals were incompatible and thankfully for them that manifested quickly and they imploded because of it.

So my advice would be to talk about your expectations and views of what a marriage is (bonus points for reading a book about it together). Also talk about long term goals, values, and timelines. Marriage is a really big deal. You are legally binding yourself to the other person and committing to staying with, supporting, and working with them to the best of your abilities for the rest of your life. It's so special."

Additionally I am very wary of anything meant for the gut that might be killed or inactivated by stomach acid (such as bacteria and proteins - e.g. enzymes) that isn't in an enteric coated capsule (a capsule that isn't dissolved until it hits a high enough pH - pH increases from stomach to colon).

You were of course well intentioned in recommending the supplement - it made you feel better for any number of reasons. But anecdotes and pseudoscience claims (sold to us by supplement manufacturers) aren't helpful medical information.
