Your back hurts when you do that cause you use it for core stabilization. If “activating” a muscle was enough to grow it, then you’d grow your legs by doing leg drive on a bench press.

Muscle growth also doesn’t happen from very long periods of time of use. If it did, why don’t long distance runners or sprinters  have big legs? Bike sprinters do cause they do short distances (and weight train a lot to be able to)

You need actual resistance in order to grow muscles. Simply activating a muscle won’t grow it"

Nootropics,fdpuqc0,t1_fdpu9ds,1578641279.0,"Upregulation does not mean more receptors for dopamine. It means the receptors are more sensitive. The term for creating new cells is neurogenesis. I know of no ways to increase dopamine receptor quantity really.

>If dopamine is involved in memories wouldn't that be a good thing

I'm not sure how you think dopamine is involved in memories but this is horribly simplistic view of neuroscience. Psychosis happens due to excess dopamine, thats what meth / amphetamine psychosis is often. Antipsychotics are therefore dopamine antagonists. Also just cause apoptosis of cells that use dopamine can impair brain areas that cause new memories does *not* mean that ""dopamine = memories"". Or that more ""cells which use dopamine"" (very vague) existing will cause better memories

Also that article talks about ONE specific area of the brain and cell apoptosis in that one very specific place, the ventral tegmental area

You're taking an extremely reductionist view to one of the most complicated things we still don't understand. Pretty much no receptors can be linked to 1 specific thing. No serotonin doesn't make you happy, and dopamine which is much simpler than serotonin is still extraordinarily complex and we don't understand all its roles.

in addition, even if your assumption was somehow true that more dopamine = more memories. There's a lot more to ""good or bad"" than ""can store new memories better"""
