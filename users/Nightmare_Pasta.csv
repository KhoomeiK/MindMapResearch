pureasoiaf,ff2p5ve,t3_er0ory,1579517432.0,"I'll just post the whole thing, I find the old Kingsguard full of badass quotes, especially Ser Arthur Dayne and Ser Gerold Hightower



“I looked for you on the Trident,” Ned said to them.

“We were not there,” Ser Gerold answered.

“Woe to the Usurper if we had been,” said Ser Oswell.

“When King's Landing fell, Ser Jaime slew your king with a golden sword, and I wondered where you were.”

“Far away,” Ser Gerold said, “or Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne, and our false brother would burn in seven hells.”

“I came down on Storm's End to lift the siege,” Ned told them, and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dipped their banners, and all their knights bent the knee to pledge us fealty. I was certain you would be among them.”

“Our knees do not bend easily,” said Ser Arthur Dayne.

“Ser Willem Darry is fled to Dragonstone, with your queen and Prince Viserys. I thought you might have sailed with him.”

“Ser Willem is a good man and true,” said Ser Oswell.

“But not of the Kingsguard,” Ser Gerold pointed out. “The Kingsguard does not flee.”

“Then or now,” said Ser Arthur. He donned his helm.

“We swore a vow,” explained old Ser Gerold.

Ned’s wraiths moved up beside him, with shadow swords in hand. They were seven against three.

“And now it begins,” said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light.

“No,” Ned said with sadness in his voice. “Now it ends.”"

I felt sorry for Nicole and Charlie, it always did feel like they could just they were one fix away from getting their marriage back on track but their differences about how the marriage was supposed to go, assumptions and selfishness (not just Charlie, as much as that lawyer kept parroting about his selfishness) was just too great of a divide. Very great writing, compelling and poignant. 

This film only reaffirms that lawyers are snakes that must be destroyed. They are an evil barely above the minimum of being necessary. Only slightly joking about that last part, hehe

But jeez, ScarJo and Driver were so fucking good. We are really spoiled for great acting performances for the past year"
