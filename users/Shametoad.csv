AskReddit,fdmrey1,t3_elzbiv,1578562062.0,"It's very very cold, you have to wrap up warm in a jacket, scarf and gloves if you're going to be outside in the snow. Snow is soft but if you compress it in your hands it becomes firm, that's how you make a snow ball. Gathering snow together and making things out of it it's really fun too, for example snow people or castles, igloos, that kind of thing. Some snow can turn into ice so always be aware. Don't ever throw a snowball with ice in it, that's mean. Walking around can be a bit difficult, you have to take your time otherwise you'll slip and fall, if you fall into snow it's fine but falling on ice is a big ouch! Also you can use snow shovels or salt grit to get rid of snow/ice away unwanted areas like pathways and roads."
