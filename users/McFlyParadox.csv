It's also McKinsey. Their reports tend to anticipate the political climates when they make predictions - they don't just say 'we wish this will happen'. If they're anticipating a growth in high-wage, low-automation jobs in the US, it's because they believe that the US government will help facilitate that change. Our politicians may be self-serving, but that exactly why they'll act - because the alternative is (as you point out) millions of people out of work and pissed off about it.

Otherwise known as 'what I have been saying'

>Our scenarios across 46 countries suggest that between almost zero and onethird of work activities could be displaced by 2030, with a **midpoint of 15  percent**

So, 30% is the absolute max, 'edge-of-bell-curve' outcome.

>Even with automation, the demand for work and workers could increase as economies grow, partly fueled by productivity growth enabled by  technological  progress

So, not a shrinking job market, not necessarily.

>Our  scenarios  suggest that by 2030, 75  million to 375  million workers (3 to 14  percent of the global workforce) will need to switch occupational categories

So 15% is actually the maximum by 2030, globally. I'd be willing to bet that this is a similar deal as before, and the typical value is probably 8.5%

>Income polarization could continue in the United States and other advanced economies, where demand for high-wage occupations may grow the most while  middle-wage  occupations  decline— assuming  current  wage  structures  persist.

Wage structures that are reinforced by monopolies like P&G, Nestlé, etc. They don't just control the prices of products, the control the wages paid to make and handle those products as well. We'd do well to break those up ASAP. 

>Increased investment and productivity growth from automation could spur enough growth to ensure full employment, but only if most displaced workers find new work within one year

So, if we're smart about it, it's a non-issue.

>pg 6, top left, US, 23 worker hours

So, 17hr work week? Shit, that's probably all I actually work right now, the rest of the time I'm sitting at my desk, waiting for work to show up, because we decided nearly 100 years ago that 40hrs/wk was optimal. We no longer have the same companies from 100 year ago, never mind the same economy. Probably time to re-think how we pay people. A per-hour basis make perfect sense for manual labor, but not really anywhere else. Probably time to switch to getting paid a percentage of the revenue you generate (and make sure that thing like 'cost centers' get re-evaluated so that they're actually generating value), or something along those lines

>pg 12, technical automation potential 
>6 out of 10 current  occupations  have more than  30% of activities  that  are  technically  automatable

'30% of activities in 60% of jobs' does not equal '30% of jobs'. It equals 18%, at most. And this assumes that you can cleanly eliminate positions as you eliminate hours - which you can't. 

>pg12, impact of adoption 
>Work  potentially  displaced by  adoption of  automation, by  adoption scenario: 15% midpoint 
>Workforce that  could  need  to change  occupational  category, by  adoption scenario: 3% midpoint 

So, again, you seem to be equating similar terms with one another. ""Work"" does not equal ""workforce"". You'll see a reduction in hour by approximately 15%, resulting in 3% of those in affected sectors needing to leave said sector all together. 

>While technical feasibility of automation is important, it is not the only factor that will influence the pace and extent of automation adoption. Other factors include the cost of developing and deploying automation solutions for specific uses in the workplace, the labor market dynamics (including quality and quantity of labor and associated wages), the benefits of automation beyond labor substitution, and regulatory and social acceptance. **Taking into account these factors, our new research estimates that between almost zero and 30  percent of the hours worked globally could be automated by 2030**, depending on the speed of adoption. In this report we mainly use the midpoint of our scenario range, which is 15  percent of current activities automated.

The part I bolded means that they looking at hours worked today globally, and are anticipating that 30% of them will be automated. To say ""that means 30% of worker out of the job"" is ridiculous, because 

1. That assumes literally 0 growth for 10 years
2. That 30% of all workers will have all their hours reduced, which just isn't possible for reasons also laid out in the quote immediately above. 

Simultaneously, if you go back to pg6, notice that they're talking about hours worked today. 16% of hours for China. Keep in mind that China has 1 billion and change for a population, and they work longer weeks. At the same time, most of their workers are in easy-to-automate industries and are already on state welfare. You'll see them soak up a ton of that '30% of hours worked globally', and they'll happily do it to. 

>Indeed, while this report is titled  Jobs lost, jobs gained, it could have been,  Jobs lost, jobs changed, jobs gained; in many ways **a big part of this story is about how more occupations will change than will be lost as machines affect portions of occupations and people increasingly work alongside them.** Societal choices will determine whether all three of these coming workforce transitions are smooth, or whether unemployment and income inequality rise. History shows numerous examples of countries that have successfully ridden the wave of technological change by investing in their workforce and adapting  policies,  institutions,  and  business  models  to  the new era. It is our hope that this report prompts leaders in that direction once again. 

And, again, we're seeing them compare it to past transitions, that if a society wants to make it through in one piece, they need to be proactive. The problem isn't innovation, it's how you react to it. 

>Aging populations.  By 2030, there will be at least 300  million more people aged 65  years and above than there were in 2014. As people age, their spending patterns shift, with a pronounced increase in spending on health care and other personal services. This will create significant demand for a range of occupations, including doctors, nurses, and health technicians, but also home health aides, personal care aides and nursing assistants in many countries, even as it reduces demand for pediatricians and primary-school teachers. Globally, we estimate heath care and related jobs from aging and rising incomes could grow by 80  million to 130  million by 2030

Sounds like a prime example for an opportunity to change industries - and this isn't the only one the provide. Not everyone can retire to Boca Raton, some (most) are going to stay right where they are, creating opportunities all over the place. And this is just the obvious example. If you can predict a unique emerging market, driven by automation, before anyone else, you'll be obscenely rich.

>We’re talking about an estimated 30% of the US workforce being automated out of a job in the coming decades.

I want to see a source on this. We're decades away from lv5 automated driving, despite what some news sources try to make it sound like. We're currently around lv2 to lv3, and will likely be sitting at lv4 for a while.

To get from your earlier '4%' to now '30%', I'm going to assume you're talking about 'pick and place' type jobs (stocking shelves, warehouses, etc). We're even further behind there. Robotic grippers are either too generic to grab onto unusual surfaces, or too specialized to grab onto general surfaces. Claws suck at anything that isn't uniformly shaped; suction only works on clean, smooth, flat objects; 'sand bags' can't hold a lot of weight and can only grab objects significantly smaller than themselves; flexible pneumatics have very limited weight ranges and are prone to tearing; and fully or under-actuated 'hands' are very expensive (even by robotics standards) and very difficult to control. All are slow as fuck - two minutes to perform a task that would take a person less than a second is considered 'state of the art' when it comes to pick & place. And that's just the mechanics, never mind the software to be able to consistently, accurately, precisely, and quickly: identify a target, plan a trajectory to said target, figure out how to securely pick it up, locate the objective, plan a trajectory to said objective, and then safely place that object - all while avoiding unexpected obstacles.

Robotics is coming, but it's nowhere near as close as the click-bait makes it seem, and it won't be coming all at once."

>Although that makes the whole Marijuina thing seem odd. Is it not illegal under federal law?

It's not legal under federal law, which means it's 100% not legal if you get caught by federal law enforcement agents (FBI, ICE, CBP, etc). It's a what is called a ""schedule 1 drug"", which means the US govt classifies it as a drug with zero practical use, making research of it (even by drug companies) pretty much impossible. For context, Heroin is schedule 1, and meth and cocaine are schedule 2 (which has accepted uses - you can get a prescription for them and get it as most drug stores). Schedule 3 is stuff like Tylenol PM. 

What this also means is if you are in an accredited college, taking student loans or scholarships, you can also lose those and be expelled if you are found in possession of or test positive for marijuana. If you work for a company on a federal contract, or are a federal employee, similar deal: lose your job.

All the dispenseries also can't use any federally insured banks or banks that interact with the Federal Reserve (so, they can't use any banks), so they pretty much are sticking to cash and hoarding it (a niche 'marijuana bank' market is now starting to show up). They also have to collect taxes, but can't actually pay them, so they are holding their taxes assuming that they are going to owe back taxes the second it is legalized. 

Imo, the next president - be it 2020 or 2024 - will finally legalize marijuana, but until then, it sits in a legal grey area.


>Wait you can only have 1 name on the incorporation paperwork?  We can have dozens.

I don't believe that there is an upper limit on the number of names, but generally it's just one. If one person screws up or messes around with the business financially, then everyone on that piece of paper could get dragged in. Instead, they put themselves down as 'owners' in other ways - charters that name them as holding a position, for example. This helps to insulate them financially if the company completely tanks. Ideally though, you set up an LLC (limited liability company) that owns the start up, and *then* everyone shares the LLC. LLCs, like their name implies, are pretty well insulated from personal finances, in case of lawsuit, etc - but these are harder to set up and these types of arrangements get looked at very closely if your taxes get audited. LLCs are really meant for things like construction contractors and small businesses, but there isn't a limit on using them like a holding company for other companies (so-called ""shell corporations"")."

* The silicon computer

* The mechanical computer (which was just a very advanced loom that you could program complicated patterns into)
* The mechanical loom (the ones the literal Luddites loved to smash) 

And someone probably even complained about the invention of the windmill putting them out of the business of making flour at some point too, I'd be willing to bet.

We've been inventing new tools for pretty much as long as we've had thumbs, and it's yet to destroy society - or even cause a permanent loss of jobs. In fact, every one of Innovations I listed above is credited for creating a net growth in jobs and economic activity.

I can't predict how the markets will shift once there is automated trucking (no 'if' about it), no one can, but I ***can*** predict that it *will* shift. Short term, the truckers out of work might also be out of luck, unless their existing skills have value in other ways that has yet to be recognized, the go through retraining of some kind, or there is a government program designed to help them. Long term, goods will be transported for cheaper, and with less waste, decreasing costs, allowing for companies to undercut each other, driving prices down, and no one will lose their jobs to trucking automation because no one will trying to be a trucker - they'll spend their lives working different jobs that have demand for labor (skilled or otherwise). 

But here lies the real problem: Monopolies. If we continue to allow companies to consolidate, or carve out regional fiefdoms, it doesn't matter if they're automated or not. The free market only works when companies compete with one another.

Automation isn't a threat to society - we've been automating shit ever since we could hold a stick - it's a few people at the top with 'I have mine, fuck you' attitudes."

Of course, this also ignores monopropellants that already have the oxygen incorporated as part of their molecule to allow for self-oxidation in the event of burning.

>I do not understand the interplay of state and federal laws enough.

Federal laws supercede state laws 100% of the time. If a state law is in conflict with a federal law, the state needs to sue and win against the federal government, or their congress persons need to write, sponsor, and pass legislation at the national level that changes the law. Or the state can change their law to be compliant with the federal law. 

When it comes to taxes however, they are completely separate. The federal government has their own taxes, and the states have theirs. The internal revenue service is the federal taxation agency. California's tax collection agency is called the CDTFA. The code you cited seems to be for the IRS, not CDTFA. The code you cited makes it legal to do at a federal level. I can't find, one way or another, what California thinks of the practice - but I'm in MA, and was when I worked for this startup, and it's 100% legal here - though, revoking the stock when I left before I hit 1 year may not have been, but that's based off a single non-binding judgement and has never faced a legal test (meaning it's not ""precedent"" and so a future ruling on a similar case does not need to consider themselves bound by it)


>I even pointed out that most of US startups are Delaware companies anyway.

Because Delaware is super corporate-friendly tax-wise, and the federal government doesn't care where you file your federal taxes as long as you do file them. This means you can have all your employees (literally all of them) in states other than Delaware, but still be ""headquartered"" in Delaware on paper, and there isn't a thing anyone can do about it. Not every company or startup does this, but it is legal for the most part. 

If you wanted to change this, you would need to change it at the federal level most likely. Something to force you to file your federal taxes in the state where you 'do most of your business' - but is that 'where most of my employees reside' or 'where most of my revenue from the US originates from'? If most of my products are bought by consumers in other states, why should I have to file my corporate taxes in that state - I can't control who buys what and where they're located. If the talent to produce a product is located in state A but the demand for that product is located in state B, what am I to do tax-wise? 


>Is there a legal definition of founder as opposed to employee in US law?

Yes. It's the guy who's name is on the legal paperwork that establishes the business; charters, licenses, Tax ID, etc. 'Cofounder', if there is one, is established internal to the company, usually on a charter or bylaws, but doesn't really have a legal presence outside of the company unless shit really hits the Fan (tax audit, fraud, malpractice, etc).

Your wording in your previous comment could be interpreted as suggested that there would be 'other' ways one might chose to detonate a nuclear device, ways that could result in increased fallout levels, when we knew from the beginning that detonating at altitude was ideal both in terms maximizing the effects of the detonation and minimizing secondary effects (that would pose a risk to ground troops that may follow up after a nuclear detonation).

No nuclear armed country would deliberately design a nuclear weapon to be set off at the surface, because that would just make the bomb less effective, while potentially endangering their own nearby troops (if there ever were any). So, any city that ever sees a nuclear detonation (hopefully never again) will also see the fallout dissipate to relatively safe levels with days to weeks.

That might be why you see so few tech startups coming out of the UK then, when compared to the US.

So they paid me literally $1 in cash when I signed up, and then a wet number of shares per hour worked.

>If the weapons had been detonated on the ground, the area would still be measurably radioactive today without extensive clean-up. 

This has more to do with the how the blasts interact with the ground than anything else.

If you detonate an atomic weapon at a higher altitude (say, 10,000 feet), the force from the blast is actually amplified because the shockwaves end up overlapping each other, creating a more deviating explosion. At the same time, the excess nuclear material (unsplit uranium, by-products of splitting uranium) gets spread out over such a wide area that it isn't that much of a hazard - its concentration in any one area is extremely low - especially over time and after weathering. We've actually known about the advantages of air-burst explosives for a while now. If you look up the Halifax explosion in 1917, part of the reason it was so destructive was because the blast bounced off the seafloor, and this revelation got weapons designers to begin thinking about air-burst artillery, instead of impact detonations - but this (scientists learning about air burst explosions via the Halifax explosion) is me going by memory, and I'm on mobile, someone else may be able to provide a source.

Additionally, if you detonate an atomic weapon on the ground, the blast itself (instead of just the shockwaves) directly interacts with the ground, mixing soil and debris with the radioactive fallout, resulting in more and longer-lasting fallout - while also resulting in a less destructive explosion. 

So, while you're correct, the half-life of uranium is not the reason for fallout not lingering, the (intentional or unintentional) implication that it was an 'accident' that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were spared from long-term nuclear fallout is not correct.

We knew in advance that detonating a nuclear weapon at higher altitude would increase its destructive capacity, and we knew in advance (via the Trinity test) that detonating the nuclear devices on the surface would result in high levels of radiation on the ground. So they were, and continue to be, designed to be detonated high above the intended target."

>This has got me thinking that a lot of “toxic masculinity” is reinforced on men by a women’s sexuality,

While this may be part of it, it is almost certainly not the whole story.

For one, while women can and do enjoy sex, it could also be a 'simple' case of discovering that they don't believe that they are emotionally compatible.

To put it another way:

If the relationship was founded on sex, the very act of emotionally opening up might be cause to end the relationship because they aren't looking to renegotiate the 'contract' - it's easier, quicker, and closer to what they want for them to go find a different fuck buddy. In this case, the guy read the relationship wrong.

If the relationship was emotionally intimate as well, and the act of opening up caused her to end the relationship, then it was never going to work out anyway. Either she does not want to be with an man who has emotions beyond what she allows (red flag), she has emotional issues of her own, and/or whatever he opened up about was a deal breaker for her (whether it's a 'fair' deal breaker is neither here nor there). In this case, the relationship was never likely to work out in the long term.

Tl;dr - women have emotional preferences too, and it's not all about sex or sexuality. Whether those emotional preferences are 'fair' is neither here nor there, it just 'is'."
