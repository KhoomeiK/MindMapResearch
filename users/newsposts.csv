Antinatalism is a very rational and well thought out process done with clear mind AFTER having suffered and seeing suffering around and understanding the world we live in. 

And the movement wants to stop suffering in the simplest least harmful way possible, at the absolute root cause. Don’t have kids. Thats it.

As for major problems we need to tackle them as any aware and decent human, help avoid the unnecessary suffering of those living. So no I don’t welcome climate change, its not something that can instinct humans and quickly anyway. It mist be fought at all cost."
