First, when someone wishes to go no contact, we need to respect it.

Second, your desire to contact her seems purely drama and anger driven. You say you want to simply say goodbye, but in your post you focus on the following:

>I’m actively angry at several of her close friends from church and she doesn’t want to be “on the business end of my chainsaw”

>I’m also mad at Christianity and lashing out at it, and she’s not really wanting to deal with that right now.>

>Carrie, who cannot engage with me because she has no time for friends, posted a picture of her at church playing board games with several friends, including Alan.


>but I can’t watch this. I can’t watch her have love for friends who shattered my heart while I wait for her to decide when I’m worth a slice of her time.


And most importantly, this:

>All I’m saying is her actions and words don’t match up, and I don’t want to sit around and watch. 

I hear nothing in your post but anger, as well as disdain for you friend (which is understandable.)

So it doesn't seem like you have any desire to simply ""say goodbye."" You want to take your anger out on her and have the last word.

I get it. I'm gay, and I hate that certain ex-friends and family condone hateful actions and people. But your letter would do nothing but break a request for no contact and stir up drama that you don't need.

You need to grieve these friendships and move on, not go looking for a fight."

In my youth, I was the emotionally abusive asshole in the relationship. Do I wish I could call her sometimes, especially when something awful happens? Absolutely. I don’t have the right to, though. And that reality is entirely the result of MY actions, not hers. 

You are not at fault for him being alone in his grief. (If he’s actually “alone” at all. The whole “you’re the only one who can give me support right now” is the oldest guilt trip trick in the book.)

The fact that he’s still reaching out even though it’s emotionally taxing for you shows that he has not changed. It shows that he still has abusive tendencies. He should have dropped it at the first sign that you didn’t want to hear from him (and honestly, he shouldn’t have reached out at all.)
