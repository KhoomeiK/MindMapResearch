bulletjournal,fdezwcg,t1_fd4lvth,1578350172.0,"Thanks for sharing yours! I would love to cook just one thing from memory, I'm still trying to develop my cooking skills haha."
bulletjournal,fdezr1n,t1_fd4y62g,1578350080.0,"Good advice! I had this feeling of wanting everything ready to go for the year but you're right, it's nice to leave room for new things that I want to do as I'm going through the year. Especially because I already have more established goals and this is just for smaller, more fun things. I hate putting up curtains but it's always so nice once they're up :)"
bulletjournal,fcywhqo,t1_fcyu6sm,1578088608.0,"Thanks, you too!"
bulletjournal,fcyweec,t1_fcyu2vl,1578088549.0,Nice! Yeah I love how much room you have. I usually jam a whole week into two pages. It would be nice to occasionally do daily spreads like this :)
bulletjournal,fcyf0mf,t3_ejik53,1578079070.0,I love how you've set up this spread! Do you do two pages for every day?
bulletjournal,fcy6jn7,t3_ejg0r9,1578075506.0,This is great! I have a health condition that means I have to walk for at least 30 mins everyday. I couldn't do it for myself but when I got a dog I did it for him :) Such a beautiful way to keep track and I like the idea of different spots to encourage a variety.

bulletjournal,eescl9t,t3_aiw6t8,1548271464.0,This is so cute! I haven't seen a mushroom theme before either :)
