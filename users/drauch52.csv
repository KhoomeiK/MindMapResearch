SuicideWatch,fdx4zc3,t3_en84y4,1578765413.0,I feel you on the internal rage. The truth is none of those groups of people are interesting. You notice the things they don’t want to know and if you bring it up expect them to pretend not to get defensive. Objectivity and creativity isn’t of interest to people. Only telling themselves some sort of story because they feel their thoughts are the “most” rational. I put my hate for existence into academia at this point. It’s really the only place where I can go into some philosophy and not feel people think I’m being a judgmental asshole. It’s all the same corny bullshit from 99% of people no doubt. I can’t ever talk to people because they externalize everything. People think that are “environment” shapes who we are and blah blah blah don’t get me started as well.

depression,fcgncw9,t3_eh79a2,1577641992.0,"I’ve done this before where I bitched out my best friend over nothing other then my trust issues and insecurities. I was being an ass, I knew it was on me. Your friend still loves you, just apologize to them, remind them how much they mean to you and in less then a week everything will be back to normal. The hardest part will be obsessing on if they hate you but it will go back really quickly. Of course context applies, I’m just speaking of my experience with my best friend. Everyone’s situation is different. If it makes you feel any better I can tell your smart"
depression,fc9k4fw,t1_fc8icmk,1577553851.0,Memory loss is the worst symptom by far. I feel like I have the cognitive capabilities of a 12 year old. It’s pretty miserable but all I can do is hope one day something works out. I feel like every morning is the morning after a hang over
depression,fc9jnbb,t3_egptaw,1577553647.0,Yea I feel absolutely brain dead. Chronic brain dead. So much so I’ve adjusted my life goals from academic subjects to more realistic things like finding a good sales job. It’s a pretty shit settlement. Hating yourself gets exhausting
