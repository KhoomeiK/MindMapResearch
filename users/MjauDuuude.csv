(Sorry I cant be bothered to check the exact SEK to USD) In the north of Sweden they cost like 700-800$ and in the south they're like 1400$

Another one was; I was in a really bare desert landscape next to a simple white box house, like a small gas station. I think I'm there with my parents and our car had broken down or something,
