expats,fe6lxuf,t3_enssu8,1578895367.0,"you seem to know what you missed. what would you get if you stay tho? that said, if you can't live without your partner there, you don't really live there. are you sure you were not just a transplant frighten to be assimilated? do it all yourself is pretty much what people in the western society do.

you might have done it wrong. redo it again like you just landed. move to a new apartment. get a roommate. make friends. talk to store owners. go out with co-workers. train martial arts. find a hobby. do volunteer works. and you must MUST learn the language. M U S T

and you actually want to consider, why do you want to live there. because everyone back home thinks it was a good place to be? but you got there and already found out what it is like... you still want to live there?

i was an expat myself when i was 31. i knew the life i want. i knew that i was never going to get it from where i used to live. i made my move and get what i want. i did not realize how much i had to loose...pretty much the same as you described. 20 years has gone by and i don't regret it.

so you go make the decision that you won't regret."

gaysian,fdjov1r,t1_fdj57iu,1578481410.0,"when you are in the closet, there is always a wall between you and people around you. if they care enough, they would feel it. it was your choice to keep the distant. the pain of being rejected may seem less painful. so, rejecting them first may be a safe choice but this is the outcome. being alone. by yourself. because you already rejected everyone.

give them a chance, some of them might reject you but some of them may surprise you. opening up, you'd know who is your true friend and who is not. be gentle tho, it takes a while for you to accept yourself, it might take them about the same time to accept the real you."

Since the signal can transform into frequency domain (S domain, Fourier/Laplace) fast and easily manipulated, in real time. 

Signal->Oversampling->S domain->digital low pass->T domain/wave

If oversampling at 170khz, digital artifacts will not show lower than 15khz. 

Much easier this way."
