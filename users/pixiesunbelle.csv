So, my MIL gets confronted by him and she reiterates that the spot next to her is closer to his apartment and that these handicapped spots are for anyone with a handicapped plate or tag. 

Sure enough, as soon as my in-laws left, he came out and moved his car. Later, that sign disappeared because the city came and took it as my grandfather wasn’t paying for it anymore. Guess who called the city and complained? Handicapped Sign Stealing Neighbor had the gall to complain about the sign he wasn’t paying for! Later, my next door neighbor informed me that the sign was paid for by grandfather. I knew he had a handicapped plate but I didn’t know that he had to pay for it to stay.

Pathfinder_RPG,ffbx8p9,t1_ffbb34g,1579785726.0,"So far I have this: 


Involuntary Woge

Involuntary Woging happens when a Wesen is afraid or aggravated. 

New Skill: Control Woge. Control Woge is how Wesen are able to suppress their instinct to Woge in situations that would aggravate them or cause them fear. This skill is tied to Wisdom and is a class skill for all Wesen. Not all Wesen are able to do this and it takes effort and practice.
This can be used against a Grimm, though the check will be very high

I made it a skill for several reasons. I don’t want to revoke all control since they Woge on their own as well. I will give extra campaign skill points that can be used for this skill- or not. I want to make it beneficial to Woge involuntarily versus doing it on your own such as making it a swift action and a bonus to initiative. But I don’t hate it using intimidate though. I could make that a class skill for everyone (except certain ones like the sheep and beavers that jump at car doors slamming). 

Should I impose penalties for the Wesen who are racial enemies such as the pig Wesen against the wolf Wesen? Like a pig Wesen would get a -2 to will saves to not shift when being intimidated by a wolf Wesen. A Wolf Wesen would gain a +2 to intimidate checks against a Pig Wesen. Though, pig Wesen don’t seem to have any Wesen they would get a bonus to."
Pathfinder_RPG,ffay5mz,t1_ff81t5g,1579747208.0,It honestly sounds like he might not know what to do because the class may not mesh with his playstyle. I’d talk to the GM about seeing how happy he’s actually with his character.
Pathfinder_RPG,ffaw89c,t1_ff8ngf5,1579745930.0,"That one wouldn’t work as they would have shifted well before taking any damage. In the show, some creatures automatically shift just by seeing other creatures because they are threatened by them. Such as wolve Wesen would cause the pig Wesen to shift because for many wolf Wesen, hunting pig Wesen is just something to do on a Saturday night. Pig Wesen often don’t even consider them people but monsters. 

I shouldn’t just say seeing, but encountering. Many wolf Wesen do assimilate into society, though they are still racist against pig Wesen. One main character in the show is known as a Wieder Blutbad (a Blutbad is a wolf Wesen). It means reformed. He’s learned to control his Blutbad instinct. I definitely wanted both of those aspects there."

Pathfinder_RPG,ff7v7mt,t1_ff7u5iw,1579659143.0,"They’re a good starting point but there’s some stuff in there that doesn’t mesh with Wesen lore. For, example the involuntary shift that Wesen are subject to and they only have two forms- human (I will allow most races though) and hybrid. So, it will need tweaking for my story. The involuntary shift is the biggest issue I’m having that I don’t know what to do with. 

The involuntary shift happens when a Wesen would feel threatened. Maybe not every time but including it would have it feel more like the show. I don’t know how to translate it without having some classes great at avoiding what could be beneficial. So far, I have the voluntary shift a standard action as it’s not a really slow process. I want to make the involuntary shift a non-action as it’s something typically done out of turn. 

I know I don’t want to use any of the shifting to be related to CON. All classes will be allowed so I don’t want to make this useless since every player will be a Wesen."

A coworker and friend told me that she just didn’t think school was a priority."
catsarefuckingstupid,fee57ox,t1_fedzcpi,1579026641.0,"Well, Tazzy gets cabin fever in the winter when she can’t go out. She surpassed age 5 and is quite skittish towards strangers. I don’t really worry about her. While I lived there, I did try to convince them to keep her indoors so I could play with her more often. It’s took her about 8 years for her to go in the neighbor’s house... just in time for him to move, lol. 

I never had trouble keeping my first cat, Josie, inside though. We suspect that she was a drop off. She always gave the front door the most evil look ever as if it were the portal to hell. If she were near it, she’d run as soon as it opened."
pokemon,fedzc23,t1_fedgce6,1579023067.0,Yeah! I really like the idea of DLCs and Pokémon is the type of game that would benefit from doing that. It’s not necessary to release all the Pokémon at once. I’m looking forward to the DLC! My husband already beat the game and still raids with me.
clothpads,fedr5wm,t3_eolwky,1579018116.0,"I prefer using them for daily liners rather than actual pads. For bed, on my heaviest days, I use the overnight one with the cup."
MaliciousCompliance,fedh4xe,t1_fecheck,1579011379.0,"I’d have bought flowers and cut it anyway. Put flowers around the stump, lol. There’s your green."
aww,fedgi69,t1_febcnbn,1579010900.0,Sure they are. A black panther is simply the common term for an all black jaguar or leopard. It’s a specific name to include it’s coat.
aww,fedgctk,t1_febs512,1579010785.0,That’s because they’re classified based upon their facial structure and shape.
cats,fedf3yg,t1_febw1c9,1579009795.0,"They just do that. Mine wants whatever I have regardless of her full food dish. This includes drinks. Actually, especially drinks."
cats,feder1h,t1_fed0h7a,1579009503.0,"My husband begrudgingly agreed that we could have a kitten. He didn’t want to have to worry about an animal if we went away on a trip, etc. Luna now snuggles with him but not me! Haha"
cats,fede2t6,t1_fea7lys,1579008943.0,My cousin is both a dog and cat person!
catsarefuckingstupid,feddw8v,t1_fecmwyj,1579008789.0,"A lot of once strays don’t do well being kept inside. I know my in-laws cat wouldn’t. She was born outside and while now she spends more time inside; outside is very much a part of her. Their other outside cat made it to age 25! 

That said, I’d never let my kitty outside in the neighborhood I’m in. Someone would take her."
ChoosingBeggars,feddckz,t1_fed15k6,1579008325.0,"My mom hasn’t lost hers but I’m not sure they know. So many things from my childhood make more sense, like the shopping. When she has manic episodes, she cleans or shops. As a kid, we would spend time at the mall from 9-9 at times. She’s now lowering her doses and using CBD....

My sister’s mania presents as constant working. Many days of doing doubles. It drives me and my husband nuts because she doesn’t drive."
DMAcademy,fedbl6r,t1_fe9n3bp,1579006738.0,"It would be recoverable if the diviner has a list of other diviners around like a friend, teacher or apprentice they must now find. It might feel less of a punishment if there’s a story reason for the death or disappearance. Why was he killed? Are the PCs wanted? Or is he involved with bad people? I’d make him involved with bad people, need rescued then once he’s rescued he gives the answers and whatever as a reward."
DMAcademy,fedb797,t1_fec301e,1579006375.0,I would go with the scroll. Maybe have other contacts written down in the room and her name or the diviner’s in blood.
tookyoulongenough,fe4wsga,t3_enffzw,1578863491.0,"When my family was cleaning out the apartment we inherited from my grandfather, he had old rent receipts that he and my grandma kept from when they first moved in. I wish I kept a couple of them. They looked exactly like that and now when I pay it, it still looks the same."
