We're super cozy with Sauidi Arabia so much so they can kill american journalists and suffer no consequences, they hold so much sway in the US that the powers that be were willing to send the troops you worship into Iraq, their number one threat in the region and destabilize an entire government, not to mention the human cost (a million dead iraqis and many of whom are children,) which gave us ISIS.
