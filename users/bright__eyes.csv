Even when I said the milk made me sick I would sit there for hours until I had finished every drop. Turns out I'm lactose intolerant. Haven't drank a glass of milk since.

It's such a great age, he's not that excited puppy anymore but still loves his walks and then he's good to just sleep and chill with you as long as he has his one good walk a day. I'm not sure if thats considered senior but I love my old man so much."

personalfinance,fdqxvbs,t3_emqyx6,1578676404.0,Cats and dogs are pretty similar in price after vet bills. If anything cats can be more costly because they live longer. The only monthly cost I have with my dog and cats are food. Id say your comparison relates more to how much time you have to spend on each animal.

All jokes aside, as a woman, I appreciate the safety factor of legal cannabis. Most times I don't even have to leave the comfort of my own house to place an order. But if I do choose to go to a store, it's in a well lit area of the city, I can take my time to look and smell the products before purchasing, and I've never felt like I was in a sketchy setting. 

I also like buying from trusted MOM's for that reason too, but I find in order to get the best deals you usually have to be buying an ounce at a time or buying a large amount of product to get free shipping. The OCS's shipping is only $5 and I like that I can grab 1g or 3.5g to try at a time but also grab larger quantities of the stuff I do like. Sure the quality can be hit or miss but if you stick to pages like this and read others reviews you can usually get a feel for what products are worth the money."

BUT most people have access to google anyways so I'm sure they can look it up for themselves. Sucks cause I really wanted to work at a potshop and the Barrhaven one is close to me but I absolutely will not be supporting this shop in anyway.

Drugs,fd6cjjr,t1_fd1cewl,1578188890.0,your local pharmacy should have a sharps container. if you dont have any sharps containers available dispose of it like you would broken glass -put it in a hard plastic or metal container and then bring it to the pharmacy/hospital.
