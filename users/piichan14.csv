MrLove,ff5rlda,t3_ertiui,1579607513.0,"I've wanted this card since the moment I started this game (and realized my love for Gavin). Was kind of disheartened when I learned that they hardly rerun events.

Then they rereleased this but I only had 3k gems (damn you Xmas event and the 0 SSR you gave me) and 16 galaxy coupons to my name. I lowered my excitement since I really can't afford topping up atm, and was rethinking of skipping this and just waiting for the Wedding ones. (I really wanted this Gavin tho so it was hard making a decision.)

Decided to roll this morning using my galaxy coupons just for the sake of rolling. Then this. It's the early morning so I can't squeel like a fangirl for the risk of waking everyone up. I just closed my eyes, breathed deeply and said to myself that I can die happy since this is the luckiest I will get in this game.

tl;dr: Rolled once with coupons, got the karma I wanted the most. Can't get any more luckier than this."

gaming,ff1giws,t3_eqy0re,1579478871.0,"Lol, as an ex born again christian, instead of a sexual predator, I thought the sign was more of bait to get people to attend services.
They love doing that where I am. Usually youths (so that's teens) would invite their non believer (so that's anyone who's not christian ex: catholics, jews,muslims,atheists) friends or classmates to go with them at a gathering with more young people. It's like a party and would definitely have pizza. They're going to be very insistent.
Once you attend, they're going to ease you in with some hip stuff, then motivational stuff, then suddenly some gospel singing then the service kicks in. By then it's too late to leave and the pizza is served after that.
It's not harmful but it is very shady. And expect your friend not to trust you if you ever invite them to another party."

Now I'm in the Summer chapter and Misumi just bugs me the hell out. I cannot get over his obsession with triangles because WHO DOES THAT? And he drops everything, even in the middle of things, when he even sees anything remotely triangle. WTF?!"
