bipolar,ffasm0k,t1_ffa3126,1579743538.0,"No need to apologize. You’re being authentic and that’s all the matters. Those moments of disappointment are really hard to deal with. I hope it turns out better than expected, but if not try to be forgiving. We’re all humans with an extra layer or three of stuff impacting us, and it’s okay to acknowledge that."
bipolar,ffas258,t1_ff90x3v,1579743164.0,¡Felicidades!
bipolar,ffarwkv,t1_ff92ars,1579743060.0,"You’re doing an amazing job! Way to show up for your daughter AND yourself by recognizing what you both needed (her to feel celebrated on her birthday, and you to feel like you were doing right by her). I hope you have a lovely little vacation, she sounds like a dynamic kiddo."
bipolar,ffarooo,t3_esbb33,1579742913.0,"I went to my psychiatrist early last week and finally owned up to being in a really bad place! I promise this is good! 

When I’m in the middle of a bad depressive episode, I’m still able to show up for work; in the past I lost jobs but the stakes were lower. I might be late, exhausted, and out of it, but I show up. However, the rest of my time (literally all of it) I spend in bed physically unable to move. I haven’t had a horrible depressive episode for probably a year or two but this one started in early December and after a couple of weeks it was massively affecting my performance AND I was fucking miserable (obviously).

A lot of my identity has become tied to being a MH advocate and someone who has been stable for some time, so I think I subconsciously didn’t want to admit I was “sick” again. But even in the midst of it all, I recognized that this was something I couldn’t not face anymore and I owned up to it! I told her how bad I’ve been and we agreed to adding a new medication on top of the lamotrigine. She was the first doctor to tell me that she believes one day I might be able to manage without medication, so I was able to trust her when she told me I wasn’t stable enough to not make an adjustment. 

AND because I was in a space to do so, we talked about making a reasonable accommodation request for a more flexible schedule so I can better manage a healthy sleep schedule since sleep, as we know, can make all the difference in the world. I have horrible insomnia but once I fall asleep I’m good. If I have to be up early for work, which with this job I do, the consistent lack of sleep triggers hypomania. Eventually I crash and burn. Enough of this repetitive cycle brought me to December when I really, really crashed and burned.  My job doesn’t actually need me there at a specific time, I just work for the state and it’s all very bureaucratic, so the request wouldn’t be unreasonable for my role.  

It was nice to feel empowered again, and I’m excited to see how this second medication helps and how changing things at work will improve things!"
bipolar,ffaq5e2,t3_erntwt,1579741885.0,"Welcome! I like this sub, too. It feels action-oriented, supportive, and largely positive (or at least geared towards the hope/possibility of recovery). Mental health issues can be super isolating, especially when partners can only empathize to the extent that they’ve experienced which, as you know, can be limited. Glad to hear you have some good things going for you, regardless!"
AskReddit,ff8i07i,t3_ero8mj,1579679375.0,"I thought I’d be dead by 21, so pretty shocked I even had a future after all."
Baking,fepyrij,t1_feo1lro,1579334856.0,"My friend’s partner’s journey with the engineering exam has spanned their relationship. As a boyfriend, he failed the professional engineering exam and it put him into a serious funk. As a fiancé, he dove head first into studying, tried again. Failed by a few points. Seriously wanted to give up on his career, thought about changing jobs. Gave it a wide berth, took another sweet year thinking about it again. As a husband, took it for a third time and finally passed. That exams sounds like no joke. I think failure is totally normal and who knows, you may get a wife or husband out of it, too."
AskReddit,feja5d0,t1_fegudff,1579163684.0,Yeah. And the reason I’m so good at “passing” is I’ve spent a good majority of my life learning how to get through and live life as normally as possible.
AskReddit,feja3fq,t1_fegvpva,1579163609.0,"And, relatedly, not having to console or reassure them when I share. The best thing a friend has done for me is acknowledge what I said, ask if I needed anything, and then moved on. I just need to share, and it felt so good to do so without a reaction."
AskReddit,fej9mee,t1_feibwc0,1579162955.0,"Yeah, this is the one. When I was younger and videos like that were more available on sites like Ogrish and Best Gore stuff didn’t really bother me. As I’ve gotten older, my tolerance is way lower and I 100% chanced it with that one. The absolute worst part was her screaming for her mom as she rolled over in an effort to escape; all the rolling did was help them cut even further by dragging it across the back of her neck. 

A few months after it happened, I spoke with a man who runs an inn in the village (Imlil) at the foot of Mt. Toubkal where I stayed and he said he encountered the girls, even offering them a place to stay for free. They were insistent on continuing and slept somewhere outside of the safer camping spots. Horrible situation. When I visited, the impact was obvious - it’s a small tourist destination for hiking in the summer and skiing in the winter, so they’re reliant on visitors. There were many guard stations and checkpoints where your passport was checked and logged, and you had to be accompanied by an official guide. Hated that I saw where they lived their last moments, and walked past where they were killed, knowing exactly what they went through."
AskReddit,feg5olt,t3_eoyn3a,1579078110.0,"Okay, hear me out. A few years ago I lived overseas for several months and upon returning home the first thing I did was lay on my bed. Oh my god. Orgasmic. No feeling like it before, no feeling like it since. Like falling into a very warm, very familiar, custom for you hug. Sooo good."
IdiotsInCars,fe62bkj,t1_fe61qub,1578880203.0,"Actually, it’s illegal to put your car tabs on willy-nilly. In WA it must go in the top right corner.  They’ve also covered the month sticker which is where the 2019 one is. So, yes, it does matter."
IdiotsInCars,fe602ko,t1_fe5zxsf,1578878771.0,"Yeah that is random. Especially those two states, which are quite dissimilar. I did grow up in California so I don’t know why tag doesn’t sound familiar to me."
IdiotsInCars,fe5zrmp,t1_fe5z85a,1578878574.0,"Is that what they’re called where you live? I’ve only heard them referred to as tabs. Unless this is a went over my head moment, which is possible for sure.

Eta, since everyone thinks I’m a loon: The WA state [DOL website](https://www.dol.wa.gov/vehicleregistration/renewyourtabs.html) refers to them as tabs."
IdiotsInCars,fe5zqml,t3_enwukk,1578878557.0,"I should add, in Washington the month sticker goes next to the year sticker on the back plate. So in this picture, the month is covered by the 2019 tab."
bipolar,fdurzr4,t1_fdsk5j8,1578737931.0,"This has been my life for the last, gosh, two months. I hold it together at work - mostly - and then I get home on Friday, crawl into bed, and don’t leave again except for food and the bathroom until Monday morning. Then I walk into work and I respond with yeah my weekend was fine, low key when I’m asked how it was. I’m acutely aware that this makes all of it worse but depression is as depression does. I try to take small steps that I know help me and also not feel too guilty about taking sick days or leaving early or laying in bed for two full days. Thanks for sharing. I feel less alone."
AskReddit,fduqmnc,t1_fdtkw5r,1578737457.0,My mom is a geologist and this is the most geologist thing I’ve seen on Reddit to date. Y’all are an interesting bunch.
chiari,fdt4y5s,t1_fdszvfz,1578711977.0,Snap is also a good word to describe it! Sometimes it feels more “wet” which is why I used popping. But when it feels more like a snap it’s almost painful.
FondantHate,fdsljzt,t1_fdsbtbh,1578704754.0,"No worries, was just curious. I appreciate your responses!"
FondantHate,fdsl9jn,t1_fdsd815,1578704635.0,Much appreciated! That definitely makes sense.

FondantHate,fdsbim7,t1_fdsap1p,1578698803.0,I’ve used a few and they’re definitely very helpful. I hadn’t seen that technique before until I bought new tips. Are there any channels you liked in particular?
FondantHate,fds7n8q,t1_fds2c5q,1578696197.0,Ohhhh! That makes sense! I’m new to all of this but I’m determined to figure it out. Thank you!
chiari,fdrwqgq,t1_fdqebzf,1578690801.0,"Mine is unpredictable too; the more I thought about it the more I realized it happens with other movements for no reason. Sometimes it’s been more painful that uncomfortable, but that sounds awful. So glad to hear it’s resolved since decompression for you."
chiari,fdrwbfd,t1_fdq72pe,1578690732.0,Exactly! Definitely feels like a spreading sensation.
chiari,fdrw7h6,t1_fdqanz5,1578690701.0,"I’m so glad to know I’m not alone! I’ve asked so many of my friends and they’re just like “..yeah, like your neck?” Nope. I’m glad it’s less frequent for you now."
chiari,fdrw4lw,t1_fdrjyan,1578690655.0,"Yes, exactly that! It also happens if I move my neck the wrong way. It’s such a difficult sensation to describe but it just plain grosses me out."
DuggarsSnark,fdmqpjp,t1_fdmqewf,1578561079.0,"She definitely seemed genuinely concerned/horrified about the possibility of Josie dying. I mean, that clip made it seem like Josie was taking breaths every ten seconds or so. Jana has also been way more of a mother to Josie than the one who has exploited her for “fame”."
DuggarsSnark,fdmnryh,t1_fdmidqo,1578557164.0,It’s the right clip. I hadn’t seen it before; I’m definitely crying and I have seen a LOT of seizures.

MorbidReality,fd1t2je,t1_fd1qyu9,1578136375.0,Oh wow! I missed that. Poor kids. I figured they weren’t alive but it makes me wonder what they went through if the mom and stepdad are that callous.

IdiotsInCars,fcitz2e,t1_fcihf8m,1577669758.0,"I have a question for dash cam users: my car is a high energy consumption car so the battery likes to die real quick if things are left running. Do they make any dash cams that only rely on energy from the car when it’s on? Can you recommend the one you use if that’s the case? 

Seems like something google might help with but it’s nice to get first hand knowledge sometimes."

AskReddit,fbtr5vz,t1_fbtqhiu,1577091426.0,If you sleep on your back you need something to support your knees in order to maintain a neutral spine. A bolster or lumbar pillow is good
