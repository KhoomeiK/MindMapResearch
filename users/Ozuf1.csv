explainlikeimfive,ffc24ti,t1_ffc1eli,1579789630.0,"Like what apes are i expect. Fruits for sure, certain kinds of veggies, and maybe the odd grain or vine. All mostly raw. These foods are harder to chew and require good teeth/bite. So they would select for that. 

Our diets are basically mush, meat, and all mostly cooked these days which has much less pressure on the teeth so you can ""get away"" with worse teeth even without bring dentists into the equation. 

Ive read articles that even say this affects our face shape and people that eat tougher foods more often have larger jaws, and the opposite is true for people who eat softer foods. 

(I'm not a researcher so most of that is just from my own readings here and there throughout the years)"

Both have varying levels of effectiveness and can have side effects so for sure do some homework and talk to a doctor or two.

Plus like someone higher up,said you wanna get tested to make,sure its male pattern baldness, neither of those are effective for other shedding disorders, a dermatologist can do some bloodwork or testing of the scalp skin."
