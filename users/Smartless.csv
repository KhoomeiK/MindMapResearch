I started attending community college at 21 because, like you, I just wanted to grow as a person. I had no intention of getting a degree, I just wanted to learn.

When I started out, I was put in the lowest math class that my college offered.

I took things slow. I've had a few hiccups in life along the way which required me to take time off from school every now and then. But I eventually finished with my bachelors in math, and then moved onto a masters in statistics.

Right now, I'm working on my PhD in pure math (which just means theoretical math).

You can absolutely get better at math. Just don't be in a hurry. Start in a class that's too low for you. Even though I started in the lowest math class my community college offered, I tested into the second lowest class. But I went to the first lecture and I knew that it was going to be a real struggle to keep up, so I went down to a class I knew I could handle.

The general theory, which sorta makes sense even if I disagree with it, is that it's not realistic to expect a single person to meet a large number of your needs. And those needs can be both emotional and sexual.

So, for example, someone in a poly relationship might really love their husband and have a life built with him. And maybe he fulfills a lot of really important needs like intimacy and just being very emotionally stable. But maybe he's just a terrible listener, and maybe he's a little too intimate in bed and you're looking for something rough. Then being in a poly relationship would give you the freedom the stay with the person you've built a life with and that has a ton of really great qualities that you really cherish, while still getting those other needs fulfilled.

Or so goes the story.

Again, it's not something I agree with. And i think part of a strong committed relationship is each person bringing up their own deficiencies for their partner, while also navigating their partner's deficiencies. But there's at least more to the story than fucking other people."

That said, they're divorced now (albeit, it seems like it was fairly amicable?). And, iirc, the husband not wanting to do the poly thing played some role in that, though I don't think it was the full story at all. 

Before they were divorced, he and I were talking about their relationship, and he told me that he hated the idea of going poly when they first started it, but that he eventually got over it and then started thinking it was cute when his (ex) wife was excited about a new relationship. 

I honestly am not sure if he ever was truly happy with it. He said he was, but that distaste for polyamory was there in both the beginning and the end, and his enthusiasm for polyamory only ever felt 85% convincing. Though I could have just been reading into things too much."

I'll preface my response by saying that I appreciate the consistency of making room for concepts like ""toxic femininity"". Personally, I tend to be weary of using broad brush strokes that these concepts seems to use (which partially motivates my comments coming up), but others might might find that there's utility in doing so that I haven't considered.


I disagree that the patterns of behavior described are intrinsic to masculinity, just like I disagree that the behaviors which would characterize ""toxic femininity"" are in any way intrinsic to femininity itself.

More often than not, it seems like the things that people would use to describe ""toxic ___inity"" are only toxic when exhibited in the extreme. Yes, the extreme versions of those behaviors do tend to predominately fall on one gender over another, but the extreme cases only come from a handful of pathological individuals and thus I don't think it paints the right picture to really tie them to a whole gender in that way. Moreover, when those behaviors are exhibited in their less extreme forms, you begin to see considerable overlap in which gender is exhibiting them, which muddies the water even further.

I'd also disagree that masculinity is an empowered force. At least, I'd disagree with it being stated so straightforwardly. The more I look at differences in gender stats, the more it seems to me like men and women both enjoy a lot of privileges, and suffer a lot of disadvantages. However, the disadvantages that men suffer aren't talked about very much in the media, nor in public discourse, so it sorta skews our sense of where support and disenfranchisement exists. Moreover the different privileges and disadvantages men and women have are in very different domains. This makes comparisons difficult, and thus makes it difficult to say who's empowered or what that even starts to mean. (e.g., women are more likely to be discriminated against in the workplace, but men are more likely to go homeless. One problem is less intense, but more widespread, and another problem is more intense, but less widespread; So whose empowered? Hard for me to say)

To find a group action that's not transitive, we need a group action where (to put it intuitively) ""it's not always possible to get from one element to any other element under the group action"".

In this case, try something really stupid, like sending every element to the identity."
Stoicism,fdguey6,t1_fdg6bt0,1578408584.0,"I tried looking for an isolated clip, but couldn't find it, and I don't remember the time stamp in that episode.

The basic summary was that Sam was mentioning how he'd had zero interaction with Taleb until one day Taleb ""forgot to take his meds"" and lambasted him unprompted.
Eric Weinstein is a friend of Taleb, so he tried defending him, but Sam's overall argument was that whatever point Taleb is making (right or wrong) is made unnecessarily difficult to engage with because of how much persona Taleb puts between you and his argument."

YangForPresidentHQ,fdelf1n,t3_ekvmme,1578341507.0,"Okay, I hate playing this card. But maybe it's time we fight a little dirty with MSNBC and CNBC;

They keep leaving out and mistreating the candidates of color. Now, we all know the real reason for this; Tulsi and Yang have some of the most threatening ideas to the establishment. It's probably got nothing to do with race. That said, these outlets seem to have drunk a whole gallon of the identity politics koolaid, and I can imagine they would respond pretty well to a \#RacistCNBC \#RacistMSNBC hashtag."

GradSchool,fdekn39,t3_ekuojd,1578341041.0,"> how do I talk with my PI about switching from thesis to course based but still wanting to do research? I'm worried about how that conversation will go.

If they're a reasonable and understanding person, then they'll sympathize with your desire to not pay the university thousands of dollars to produce research for them.

If they're not a reasonable or understanding person, then it's going to be an uncomfortable situation, and theirs no two ways about it. But it doesn't matter. If you're doing course work, then your PI is going to have a fairly minor role in the rest of your studies, which means they can't make your life a living hell. So all you have to do is endure an uncomfortable conversation and be firm. Is that worth it to you? To put it another way; are you willing to put up with something awkward and uncomfortable to avoid wasting thousands of dollars?"
