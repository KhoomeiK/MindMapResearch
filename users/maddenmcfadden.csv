CallOfDutyMobile,ffa0vwk,t1_ffa0rgt,1579725635.0,That‚Äôs what I mean. I guess it helps players play faster or whatever. I look like an arthritic old man when I try the claw.

I think it would be hilarious if one time he flipped out on one of these innocent villagers, and said the fucking food is raw! You fucking muppet! 
Ah, that would be so satisfying.
