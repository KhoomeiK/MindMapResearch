OCPoetry,ff8uz2r,t3_erwqpy,1579696989.0,"I get how this is poetry but I see it more like a Jazz form. Or a story. The way the lines flow kinda showcase how this person has made you feel: its continuos but rivetting. You have been taken on a journey with this person and you took me along. 

it's consuming, deep and very personal. 

I would suggest trying to tighten it WRT punctuation and make the sentences a little crisper. Your readers will appreciate it :)"

Also, writing has been my outlet for a while now. I like to write about fiction too though. Thank you for thinking that my poetry is wonderful <3
I like your idea about the motif! Preceding order is more my style. Will definitely incorporate it. Thanks you :)"

OCPoetry,ff5u5hq,t3_ern92o,1579610342.0,"I see where you're going with the title, it is workable if you leave out the fact that you assumed people would judge you. I think the poem flows better if the reader realizes the mistake of assuming. Maybe go on to talk a little bit about how planting a tree changes your school and outlook. Maybe 'terrorizing' people into peace. See what I mean?"
