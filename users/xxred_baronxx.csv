You know yourself better than anyone.  Can you burn the candle at both ends and still be able to stay sane? Then I would say yes, that’s a solid plan to get a chunk of money to pay down debt. Especially if you know it’s for a specific time frame.  If you know that you need a work life balance to keep your mental and physical health then I would say 6 months of misery isn’t worth the debt reduction.

technology,fc6b08k,t1_fc690nd,1577476376.0,"Academic is for knowledge and private is for profit. If you are picking up a hobby is it because you want to learn something new or is it because you think you can make money doing it? How would that impact the quality of how you go about that hobby?

Say you want to learn how to play a guitar. You go out and buy one, along with accessories and lessons. As you spend weeks learning and failing and trying again. What keeps you going? Do you think “wow! I’m really being challenged by this, but it’s an enriching experience that I will forever keep with me in my life as I spend my days playing for myself and my family and friends” or do you think “wow! I’m never going to recoup my costs playing gigs at local bars and clubs at this rate, I better improve soon or this is a waste of time.”

While research is not a hobby, the spirit of the analogy rings true. Private sector is profit driven, while academic is about advancing knowledge"
