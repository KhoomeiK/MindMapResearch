PublicFreakout,ff1q17u,t1_ff02t0q,1579483638.0,"> Fun fact: On the average, farmers in Germany are part of the upper middle class (17% of the population) or even upper class (3,5% of the population). You'll never see a poor (non-organic) farmer in Germany.

If it's anything like the US, then I'm assuming these ""rich"" farmers are only rich because of the value of their land and equipment. They are asset rich, but cash poor. Your farm could be worth $3,000,000, with $300,000 revenue, but you only make $30,000 this year because you had to buy new equipment or pay off debts on loans related to the farm or whatever."
