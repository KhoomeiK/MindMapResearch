I also ate spinach out of the bag and abstained from heavy dressings, soda and eating out.

not all kids are the same; your child could totally rebel. but it's not the only possibility. I recommend you show them documentaries about the food industry and ask them what their opinions are on what they saw. education is the best way to fight ignorance."

I was one of those poor kids before graduating high school in 2017, and the quality of education in non-Advanced Placement classes was astoundingly bad. Like, never have to use any critical thinking skills or study bad. And it’s clearly because of underfunding for those classes. A teacher can’t do much when they have CollegeBoard useless workbooks thrown at them as the only resource available.

To make it worse, the people taking these terrible classes were the poorest members of the community. Everyone with college educated parents were enrolled in AP classes because their parents were able to afford tutoring and/or give their kids help themselves. Also, they had nice homes and computers to study with. So all these kids that were less well off had few chances to get a decent education. 

Idk man, it just makes me really sad that the only reason I got into college amongst peers in my family’s income bracket is that I hated the boring classwork in Honors and Regular classes. 😔 Sorry for the rant"
