Thing is, decades ago when she did it all you had to do was fill out a form and have a home visit. Now, to start a daycare in the same state, it's a full year's worth of special classes, ranging from CPR to childhood education & nutrition, plus a ton of paperwork and special insurance and the home visit. And that only qualifies you for older kids! For infants you need even more (hence the high price for daycare <6mos!).

I actually still own a late 90s Civic, because I've done out all the math and it's the cheapest point A to point B car (until I hit a repair over $X, then I'd scrap it). I count the (minimal) repairs & maintenance I have to do as a cheap hobby. I've been terribly impressed with its reliability-- I think you're right to be looking at Civics & Corollas. I have co-workers with new BWS & Mercedes that are less reliable than my car.

The average in repairs for me has been $1k/yr the last two years (I had the timing belt done preventatively, that was a big chunk), and prior to that it was <$500/yr.

RealEstate,fdpf111,t1_fdpd1i5,1578626941.0,"We found out it was grandfathered in because we called the town inspector. If you're rural enough, there might not even be an inspector, so it could be ""legal"" by default just because no one exists to check. Legal/illegal is sort of a weird way to put this, it's really just up to code, not up to code, or fine because it was up to code when it was built. It's not like you could go to jail over this or anything.

The trouble you could get in is an inspector insisting that you fix it properly (they'd come over in the context of you calling them to permit & inspect a project). This is 100% down to your individual inspector-- usually, they only look at work related to the new project, they don't just wander your house looking for now-out-of-code stuff. IF they see something horribly dangerous (think live loose wires), that's when your average inspector would insist on a fix even if it's outside the scope of the current project. Otherwise they generally leave you alone, especially if it's not obvious new work and seems likely to have been put in ages ago. But code in reality is whatever the inspector says it is, so if yours is anal retentive and happened to see it maybe they would make a big deal out of this. The nextdoor site, neighbors, or local contractors might be able to give you a general idea of your plumbing inspector's attitude & temperament if you ask around. 

We left ours for maybe five years after moving in? And it'd already been draining like that for six decades. The only downside was that the dry well causes a slight dip in the lawn.
