fatlogic,ff3z13b,t1_ff36jez,1579551960.0,"Same. When I was a senior in high school almost 20 years ago I wore a size 9 in jeans, now I’m a size 6 or sometimes even a 4 or 3 even though I haven’t lost weight. I’m not stick skinny, there’s no way in hell I should ever be able to fit a size 3."
fatlogic,ff3y73a,t3_ergneb,1579551437.0,"“Thin people get all the same health issues as fat people but they get interventions that have been shown to effectively address their health problems. Fat people are given an intervention intended to change our body size, which not only hasn’t been proven to effectively address health issues, but hasn’t been shown to effectively change our body size.”

This logic is infuriating. I know this example I’m about to give is purely anecdotal, but it’s all-too-common: I have a close relative who is morbidly obese. She drinks nothing but sugary drinks, and tons of them. Her diet is purely cheese, meat, sugar, and refined carbs. She has sleep apnea, fatty liver, gallstones, kidney stones, high blood pressure, Acanthosis nigricans all over the back of her neck, skin tags all on her neck and chest, pre-diabetes (but given her symptoms I wouldn’t be surprised if she’s diabetic and hasn’t figured it out quite), and has had a minor stroke (at age 46).  She lives in constant pain, and has to wear orthopedic shoes and often a brace on her right foot.

ALL of these things are because of her poor diet and obesity. Can Ragen look her doctor straight in the eye and honestly say she knows healthy weight people who are afflicted with these health issues? Sure, she might know someone at a healthy weight with Type 2 diabetes or high cholesterol, but can she truly say she knows a person at a healthy weight with a combination of these types of health issues AT ONCE? No, she can’t. 

And no, I’m not fat shaming this relative. I love her dearly and it scares me that her weight and diet are quite literally killing her. Losing weight and controlling her diet are exactly what she needs to do to get healthier. 

Screw your logic, Ragen."

fatlogic,fdmi9or,t1_fdmc9bi,1578550872.0,"My sister is morbidly obese and has gallstones, which cause her to vomit every morning and whenever she eats fattening foods. Sometimes I can tell she is in excruciating pain. She also has fatty liver, which she said her doctor told her is worsening because of the gallstones. 

And yet “dieting” (i.e., eating somewhat healthier foods not completely laden with fat and sugar) is absolute misery. 🤷🏼‍♀️

I cannot fathom living in so much pain and discomfort all the time."

fatlogic,fcntq53,t1_fclev8o,1577818231.0,"Seriously! I have a co-worker who regularly makes comments to me about her going on a diet or about what I’m freaking eating (“you’re so good,” “you’re so healthy,” “no wonder you’re skinny,” etc.). It’s makes me uncomfortable and I usually don’t say anything back or else try to change the subject.

Then I go home from work and my morbidly obese sister complains to me about not being able to lose weight. 

Really the only people around me whoever feel the need to talk about diet and weight and feel they have the right to comment on my own weight and dietary choices are overweight and obese."
