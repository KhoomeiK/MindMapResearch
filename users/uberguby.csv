We can define true-midnight... sort of... as the time the sun is opposite our longitude. I'm sure some physicist can point out problems with that, and I welcome them to, cause I get off on this, but it gives us a good, non-arbitrary starting point for defining the boundaries of these curses.  


hand waving over a bunch of stuff after that, then, yeah. Mogwai wouldn't really be good pets once you're in the arctic zones because they'd have to go longer and longer stretches where they can't eat for one part of the year, and longer and longer stretches where the sun poses a threat for the other part. I don't think you'd find a lot of wild mogwai in the arctic.  


So I guess I also wanna know, *are* there wild mogwai? That is, do mogwai occur in nature, were they bred, or were they crafted from some malevolent spirit? Something else?"

Cause you defiled it by shitting in it. You can... debuff the holy status by defiling the water. Or that's what I heard, I'm not a priest, I don't *know.*  


So if you were to bless the ocean, it's full of fish fucking, killing, eating and shitting, so it just isn't that holy. It's immediately defiled. Not sure what happens if you bless the dead sea. Hmm..."

WhiteWolfRPG,fcvgmi2,t1_fcv3ppc,1578001678.0,"I think Max\_Damage is referring to how the mage cosmos allows room for the actual rules of the universe to be different across the span of time, because of it's dependence on people observing and having opinions about it. This is an easy explanation for why dark ages splats and modern nights splats have such different rules. Personally I think it's a really neat extension of the idea of ""If you met someone from 400 years ago it would be like meeting an alien"" as well as the increasing uncertainty of history as you move backwards in time. That is, the rules to dark ages are so different because the way people perceived reality was extremely different. Mage's ""consensus reality"" just kind of formalizes that.   


TL/DR: I don't think Max\_Damage is saying it's necessary to bring Mages in, merely that their cosmological model presented in mage allows for basically making a drastically modified game to run first and second city campaigns."
educationalgifs,fcgce8p,t1_fcfl4vh,1577638579.0,"Whaaaat? But *how*? We might have to start at ""what is a lagrange point"". 

I had thought lagrange points were points where objects could just rest relative to two bodies when one body orbits another. I assumed it had to do with forces ""balancing out"", relative to the bodies of course, but I've never known for certain."
educationalgifs,fcc4yi1,t1_fcb5ag5,1577594466.0,">Edit. Unless I'm wrong.

I ono. Like I said I ain't no science man. I agree that the initial velocity would keep it in orbit on the first cycle, but at the end of that animation that thing seems to slingshot hard into the direction of the sun, and a little behind us. Seems like we should be rid of it, then it suddenly starts arching back into the direction of the earth.  


My first guess is it has something to do with the fact that the line through the earth is a circle and not a straight line, but my instincts as an arm-chair know it all tell me to pay attention to the fact that the arc happens near what I assume is a lagrange point, though I don't really know why a lagrange point would have that effect? Again, anybody who has these answers, please chime in."

If you're like me and find it distasteful when redditors answer questions with wikipedia articles:  
The object was already somewhat on a similar orbital path as the earth merely by virtue of coming from there.  Consider the hands on a clock moving around the same circle. Moving around the clock face at different speeds, and occasionally those speeds result in them coinciding at the same location every like... I dunno 65ish minutes.  


It's similar with our space debris. It's moving around the sun on the same path as the earth, but at a different speed. Every forty-ish years these objects get close enough to each other that the debris gets caught in the earth's gravity and starts orbiting the earth instead of orbiting the sun. It hits this really bizarre orbit, occasionally getting caught in the moon's gravity as well, which causes the slingshot effect that allows the object to escape our orbit and return to an orbit around the sun. As to what keeps it on the earth's orbital path, I couldn't tell you, but my understanding is it's actually much harder to slingshot stuff off into space WITHOUT causing it to orbit another body.  


Related to this idea, there's a region in our orbital path where there's just a bunch of space rocks chilling out, and once a year the earth just slams a big ol' hole in that sumbitch. It's apparently a very predictable clock for a meteor shower, I suppose."
