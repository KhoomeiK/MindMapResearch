Firstly, develope a repetoir of 'voices' that you can easily remember and copy frequently, and just start talking in them. Give them a personality outside of your own, or perhaps an extreme of your personality, and try having regular conversations with friends who know what you are doing.

Practice makes perfect, and when you can easily voice on ""character"" you can move on to another. A good goal would be to make two different sounding characters, and try to have a conversation between them. Think for each individually."

DestinyTheGame,ff9smis,t1_ff9m0ny,1579720355.0,"Not to come off as rude, but all of that is pretty standard ""Duh"" stuff that many of us have been asking for since D2 started, that's been ignored up to this part. we wanted strike scoring (like it was at the end of D1) we didn't that, we wanted arms day back, we didn't get that, we wanted faction venders back, we didn't get that, we wanted fresh rolls to look at each week my the vanguard/crucible/gambit vendors, we didn't get that.

HEll, you guys even took random rolls away from Saladin, and now he's just some dude we turn tokens into.

Here's a fun thought, i don't want to see another token for as long as i play destiny. I hate tokens. Because bungie doesn't know what tokens are for in an MMO style game. A token (and Luke smith should know this being a WoW player back in the day.) Is used to purchase specific pieces of gear with specific rolls to help curb RNG. ALL TOKENS ARE IN DESTINY 2 IS RNG! we can't even choose weapon or armor packages like we could in D1.

Basically, we want every single thing we had at the end of destiny year 1, which should have been everything we had at the start of D2, and if it wasn't, it's what yall should have been working towards. 

You guys did a wonderful job on the saint missions, and i'm actually  one of the people who thought others over-reacted about the weapon being bastion, but at the same time, it's hard to defend you guys when we're still waiting on features to return from the previous game, and all you're drip-feeding us is FOMO content that won't matter in several months. It's why i stopped playing warframe, and it's why i'll stop eventually playing destiny. It's not the gameplay, it's not the community, it's the fact that we need to complete things in a time limit or never ever get them. 

Like the Corridors of Time being removed at the end of the week, why? why not just make it available all season? Why not hide the lore in a different place afterwords, I'm sure future players wouldn't mind hopping around mercury or the infinite forest looking for scattered lore.

But the more we seem to say we don't want content removed, the more and more you guys try to convince that we should be. I get it, destiny is a big game, you don't want it building up so high that the file-size is a problem, but at the same time, why are you guys developing things without a plan along side them to help preserve SOME of those things.

HEll all you need to do at the end of a season is have a vendor stay that offered all the basic rewards for a mix of vanguard or crucible tokens, or just legendary shards. That's it, that's all. Ikora should be selling vex offensive weapons for legendary shards, at the end of this season, Osiris or another vendor needs to be made to sell the saint 14 weapons and the righteous armor for shards."
DestinyTheGame,ff8rvnu,t1_ff8rof2,1579693639.0,"But it's only artificial usefulness. Literally they are only useful because of the mod, and it's making the primary give up a mod slot that could make it better to use on other enemies. a bad system should be underminded in that case."
DestinyTheGame,ff8r0yu,t1_ff8n6x9,1579692561.0,"I have no problem using a variety. Personally, i want to double fusion for the first time ever in destiny's history thanks to Bastion. Can't, bastion has no champion mods, fusions have no champion mods, and if i'm using Bastion, i can't equip leviathan's breath in my heavy slot. I have to make do with either a solar grenade or a void melee. It kinda sucks, even though it's fun in other content."
DestinyTheGame,ff8q7r4,t1_ff8nte0,1579691457.0,"I think the major problem is everyone is trying to make a streamlined system, because, as a few in this thread have pointed out, the champions feel less like a champion and more like a to be deleted nuisance that forces you to wear IB and something that gives you bonus damage. in 920's and lower, champions don't even require modding or coordination to kill. in 980's, any well coordinated team will know when and where they'll spawn, and delete them before they're a problem. People are avoiding the mods in these high levels outside of maybe overload cause they're a bit more of a nuisance. 

The champions themselves requiring each a mod to fight is a pretty unclean and unnatural system that leaves you constantly switching mods and weapons just to play a pve mode that has no changes or deviation. When i think champions, i think of a big unit that is going to immediately need undevided attention, or it's going to get bad quick. As it stands, simply having the mod on a weapon tends to make the champion less of a problem than a single wandering thrall. 

All and all, if they wanted the champions to be a unique experience, they have to start focusing less on forcing the player to wear certain items or mods, and start using more mechanics based champions, like the fallen berserkers from SotP, or black armory drone shields which require breaking and keeping constant damage. 

Bungie needs to give me enemies that demand my attention and create mechanics that aren't simply ""Bring X weapon with X mod to receive kill""."

DestinyTheGame,ff8iwg7,t1_ff8gga9,1579680555.0,"To be honest, the champions don't offer up much difficulty at all to a communicating group. I've not run to many 980's, but all of them were smooth sailing because we had an IB triple aimed at someone's head, or someone using divinity, or hammerstrike/flawless execution, or other + damage effects.

Once you know where they are, they just become a chore to do when you know where they are and exactly what they're going to do. 

Personally, I'd make them more mechanics based. Something that requires performing a certain function, rather than having a certain type of weapon to use."
DestinyTheGame,ff8ibmv,t1_ff8gw0j,1579679794.0,"The reason i didn't mention older exotics is because it may actually be difficult to add more effects to some of them. And unless we get word from bungie that it's not the case, I'd rather them focus on making general loadouts feel more open."
DestinyTheGame,ff8hyjy,t1_ff8gwn2,1579679313.0,"I've talked about that kinda switch in other comments, and i think that would be a great compromise. 

Personally, if we go that route for the last bit, it would make more sense to switch from a weapon type and make the champions more active mechanics based. 

Things like a combination of black armory drone style shields with the recovery aspect of barrier champions regeneration would make for a way more fun and active style of barrier that doesn't require a mod. Overload champions would make for good tanky sponges that recover quickly if you don't keep hitting them, and could possibly create an energy zone when struck so many times that deals continuous damage. Unstoppables could require multiple team mates hitting at once to stun and take advantage of that moment to lay into them."
DestinyTheGame,ff7tjnn,t1_ff7spbl,1579658013.0,"What i'm saying is, Izanagi's kind of already bypasses barrier champions because it destroys them before they can get a barrier up usually. Ideally, there would be a mod slot that that your izanagi's could use to just have shield piercing. though the second thing i posted there would solve your problem. you could have izanagi's and an energy primary. 

I've argued before that the champions should be mechanic based and not mod-based. Barrier champions could have easily used a black armory drone style system, or they could have made them like the berserkers from scourge of the past, for example."
DestinyTheGame,ff7sadp,t1_ff7rvn2,1579657136.0,"why would you need anti-barrier if you're running IB? 920's it basically one shots barrier champions, and if you're using it in a 980, usually you're coordinating with two other people to who can pop the head of the barrier champion with you. 

Alternatively, i discussed making anti-barrier into primary weapons, and overload into special weapons."
DestinyTheGame,ff7reqc,t1_ff7qb1e,1579656531.0,"Under this system, anything in the energy slot, from fusions to shotguns to scouts or snipers would overload."

DestinyTheGame,ff7m7wr,t1_ff7jvu1,1579652898.0,"Well again, there are the grenade and melee overload/unstoppable perks, which should, just like the weapons, not be class or element specific. in that way you wouldn't need to devote your unstoppable/overload mods to your weapons, and free up those slots for whatever you want to use. 

promoting different playstyles has already shown to be a bust, people are bored of running ordeals with the same loadouts all season, with weapons they don't want to use. This has been voiced multiple times over the last two seasons, so arguing for it is a moot point."
DestinyTheGame,ff7ltwr,t1_ff7k5a8,1579652626.0,"Right now i'm not arguing about exotics because as it stands i'm not a developer, i don't know how adding those functions to older exotics would work or if it'd be easy. what i do know is they can introduce these as regular mods, so that is what the post is focused on. exotics for the sake of this post don't enter the conversation, outside of already existing options."
DestinyTheGame,ff7ihyi,t1_ff7iady,1579650336.0,"Well, like i said, here, there are three options, heavies, unstoppable melee's, or devil's ruin, that's a good bit of options for handling unstoppables."

DestinyTheGame,ff7f1cj,t1_ff7aos2,1579648047.0,"How? the exotics all wouldn't change, and the only thing this does is open up a variety, if you're going into a 980, you have to take those weapons anyways, so what's the difference?"
DestinyTheGame,ff7eyph,t1_ff7a0az,1579647999.0,"But the system as it stands is already like that. you have to run the weapons that have the mods anyways, more variety just lets you do it how you want to. Players can already have all the mods active, so i can't even fathom the point of your post except for disliking having a variety of weapons to use versus a couple?"
DestinyTheGame,ff7etpl,t1_ff79hx3,1579647905.0,"you have to use one of each weapon type anyways. you don't have to use your heavy on the unstoppable fully, just enough to elicit the effect, and they you could swap to special and take them out. as it stands right now, you either use devil's ruin, leviathons breath, or the three weapon types for the season. under my system presented here, any heavy, (which you have to use anyways) would be able to stagger an unstoppable, and once they were, you could use any weapon to kill them, just like normal now."
DestinyTheGame,ff7ekg5,t1_ff74f3y,1579647735.0,"How does it make them useless? Under my system, it would be an energy weapon that has shield piercing, actually making it a unique contender since the rest with be kinetic. Since you have to be carrying a kinetic/energy/heavy at all times anyway, your second point is moot because the only thing you're forced to use in the mod, not another weapon type."
DestinyTheGame,ff7e0qx,t1_ff71v25,1579647379.0,"How would this be a nerf? It's literally the same as it is now, with more weapon variety. You're still giving up a mod slot to use the mod.

DestinyTheGame,ff7dviy,t1_ff77m0f,1579647284.0,"The champions in and of themselves aren't the problem, nor are the mods, it's more the limited weapon types and that we have an entire slot (heavy) which is unused for dealing with champions outside of a single exotic bow."

DestinyTheGame,ff7167z,t1_ff70ckr,1579639066.0,"I understand where you're coming from, And i don't expect these changes to come quickly, but at the same time, we do still have to provide feedback. Even if no one at Bungie see's this post, other people should make their voices heard on the subject, as it increases the chances of stuff like this being seen and listened too. 

We can't expect them to ignore their whole vision as much as they can't expect us to fully agree with it, but we've gotten plenty of compromises in the past, and i'm sure we'll have more in the future."
DestinyTheGame,ff70pdm,t1_ff6yyf8,1579638788.0,"And it really makes sense with the mods themselves. I like the idea of the barrier/overload/unstoppable champions, but limiting the mods to a few gun types a season just doesn't feel good. 

This way, we always know what to use against what, and have a wider variety of weapons to bring as tools, and this will help alleviate some of the pressure for every exotic to have these mods as apart of them."

raidsecrets,ff3v93e,t1_ff3h7oo,1579549599.0,"The gun can easily multikill in PVP, shotguns can't easily kill two full health guardians in one shot at distance. 

It also depends on the situation, It shots down supers as well, so People need to wait a bit before they give there final word on the gun. As it stands, It's our only kinetic fusion, which means you can use it + any other energy weapon, which is something we've not had before, so all sorts of new loadouts can be had from this. Knowing it's a sorter range, I'd probably pair this with something like Right side of wrong or a black scorpion. 

What bastion needs is something that rewards it's get up close and multikill personality, perhaps Army of one from D1 as a catalyst perk, or even something like backup-plan."

I'm not clicking your profile and reading through all your comments, I'm pointing out the particular one relevant to this thread line and am under no obligation to know everything you posted.   

Based on Bungie's track record, it is deceptive that this questline leads to an early unlock rather than a secret weapon, because every other time this has happened in destiny's history, it has. It's not malicious, But they can't claim that they wouldn't know there would be many players disappointed. 

Bungie has set our expectations high for these styles of quests, so it is only natural the community had high expectations, and to be disappointed when those expectations weren't met. personally, i'm also disappointed that for a Hidden exotic level of quest that this was, that Bastion doesn't have an already earn-able catalyst, like the other two similar exotics did (whisper and outbreak) which i expect and will continue to expect every hidden exotic has, because it's the minimum level of effort i think should be put into these types of exotics."
DestinyTheGame,ff3p1f3,t1_ff2tqjd,1579545779.0,"As someone who was apart of gathering codes and working all week on bruteforcing and trying to get this, my 2 cents:

I love the gun, I wanted it since i've seen it on the road map. however, typically, in destiny history, this would have lead to something we don't know the name of. I'm not disappointed in the reward, i'm disappointed that we worked hard on a puzzle that would have normally lead to something we had no idea about, only to get a reward we were well aware was coming shortly anyways. if the gun was slated to come out months from now, there would be alot more hype, but the puzzle itself was long, tedious, and confusing, and to get something we were going to get anyways, no matter what, for such hard work, does sting a bit. 

I think people are making a bit to much of a big deal over it, but at the same time, it is totally understandable given that destiny's track record before this told every player who is familiar with these types of quests that it was something we wouldn't know about.

Also, your attitude that no one should be upset by this is pretty lame bro. People are allowed to have different expectations. While i'm not personally upset, i can set aside my own feelings on the matter to empathize with others who are, because i can think above myself and my own expectations and lack thereof.  Comments like ""There was nothing deceptive. People let their expectations grow to something that was not justified. This sub is ridiculous. I hope bungie stops paying attention to you all."" is pretty inflammatory."

It's a core part of an MMO experience to have some players be gateways for others. I for one enjoy the puzzle and watching this all unfold, it's a large effort from alot of players trying to solve a puzzle, which destiny is known for. 

Luke Smith himself was one of those kinds of players, way back in World of Warcraft, a player who worked with others to unlock an in game event which required many players worth of effort to achieve, and would not release til they achieved it. He himself got a very rare title for being one of those people, so he understands the value that holds for some kinds of players. 

I for one, am hardly interested in the titles destiny offers. I unlocked 2 of them, and could easily go for the others, but, they don't really feel like a great reward for me. But other players enjoy them, so, I enjoy them in that way, through the prestige of other players who want to get them and show them of, and in that way, i also help them enjoy them. 

Like it or not, you're playing an online multiplayer game, and while there are some things that can be solo'd, and some challenges even meant for solo players. There are going to be things in this game that require you to work with a multitude of players, and this is one of those moments.

DestinyTheGame,fdlc135,t1_fdkpqmn,1578520804.0,"It's my opinion that if people want to pug, let them pug, so long as you offer the ability to privately run the activity, what is really the difference?

This comes back to something i don't understand about the development of destiny itself, is that everything always has to be ""either or"" instead of ""Either and or"".

Look at the fire-walled versions of the infinite forest activities, Those are literally the solution to this problem. If people want to attempt a master/legend activity in a pug, let them, but always give a private option for those who only want to bring friends or attempt a solo. the solution is already in the game, it just needs to be implemented for each activity. 

With all the positive feedback i saw constantly for firewalled modes, i don't know why bungie refuses to make them the norm when it's clear it's what players want.

Bungie should not be making the decision for us whether we want to go through the headache of a pug or not, let US decide that, and again, for the umpteenth time as promised, let us ""Play how we want"" instead of how they decide the game should be played.  

Reckoning was legit harder than legendary sundial, yet it was seen fit to give it matchmaking, There should be no reason why matchmaking shouldn't be the default for all non-raid activities (or dungeons, I'm okay with them being non-matchmade as they are raid-lights.)

It is time for bungie to let go of preconceived notions of matchmaking, and let us matchmake all activities.

Look at Monster hunter world, even the HARDEST of ALL missions, still has active matchmaking."

I've already run these strikes for TWO YEARS, the last thing i wanted was an update that made the most lucrative strikes the ones that are the exact same, over and over. 

That's a fault of the design of the champions and strikes. The champions should have never been tied to a mod, they should have been mechanic based. Instead we have limited loadouts that must always be the same for every respective ordeal, and most groups won't take you along unless you're rocking the best of the best loadouts, which again, is boring, i play this game, to use what i want, when i want, and how i want to, and ordeals go literally against that ideal in every single way. 

IMHO, Ordeals have the essence of a good idea, but the execution of them is terribly boring, and the champions and mods needed to beat them compound on an already limited weapon set up to complete them with."
DestinyTheGame,fdeycsz,t1_fdev38o,1578349209.0,"Well sundial (at least this base version, legendary will probably be different) hardly requires the mods because 6 people will blow away champions if they focus on them.

The major issue is in ordeals when People refuse to switch to those mods (and i can't blame them, The champions themselves are interesting, but defeating them should have been tied to mechanics, not a mod requirement.) and then you feel you have to run both mods or the respective exotic that handles that champion."
DestinyTheGame,fde86ba,t1_fde6gah,1578333296.0,"On the flip side, i don't find that ordeals are different enough from strikes and nightfalls to be satisfying in their own right. The biggest potential difference is the champions, and the current ""wear the proper nodded weapons or choice exotics"" has warn thin, especially as there has been no update to previous exotics to allow them to better handle ordeal content.

Another problem is that ordeals remove randomness from the strike. Every ordeal pyrimidian run is just vex, never a chance at taken, just for an example.

The random rewards also feels bad. I can understand for exotics, but i want prisms and shards everytime i do the respective difficulty nightfall, not a chance, a guarantee that my time will not be wasted (which it is everytime i do a 920 but get no cores/prisms)."

At point blank there are times when simply charging the gun as a hail Mary will just lock onto a head you weren't aiming for and kill them, happened like 20 times to me farming Komodo where i was guaranteed not on the head, yet yellow numbers appear where the shoulder charging titan just was.

Not only that, but for the heavy handed of us, it lets us use the charge time to line up a strafe shot. with a sniper, you've got got to be on your mark on the trigger pull, with linear, you line up the cross-air to the timing of the shot. For those with a little lower reaction time, it allows us to use a different sense of time to line up a shot. case in point, i'm great with linears, but terrible with snipers."

Your argument holds no barring, you wanna know why? Spare rations, a gun MANY TIMES harder to farm, that was NERFED and has half the effective range of an erentil, and no direct farming method, and needs specific rolls to work, still has a far higher kill percentage and usage statistic than the Erentil, a gun that's been around longer, has a direct farming method that even lets you control it's masterwork and can give you multiple chances at the gun a run. 

It is not hard to farm the god roll, you go to the menagerie and you do it. All those competitive players who took the time to farm a spare rations would have farmed god roll erentils if they were as good as people say they are, but they aren't, they're a solid weapon, but far from overpowered. 

Imagine, complaining that backup plan is doing it's job, that's like someone complaining that full choke makes a shot-gun too accurate."

Maybe you'll understand this: Your opinion isn't fact, all of us arguing the opposite, have the numbers and data to back it up, you all just whine because you refuse to understand how to combat a weapon that has a near full second charge time,a  half second cool-down time, and a firing animation time. each missed shot leaves you WAY more open than any other weapon in the game.

What if i told you, Erentil was meant to kill at 40-50, because, in the past of destiny's history, we've actually had fusion rifles that reached the 60-75 meter range?

If you guys were right, Coolguy, Mtashed, Cammy, Drewsky, Frostbolt, would have posted something about it.  and i'm not just pointiing to destiny streamers and blindly going ""Hyuck hyuck, the popular people don't think so"" I'm pointing to them cause each of those guys are highly competitive, some more than others, and if Erentil was such a big deal, and actually as good as people make it out to be, then they'd be religiously using it, and so would every other sweaty team.

But they don't, because the weapon has proper drawbacks that allow intelligent opponents to out-maneuver it. Why aren't the most competitive players running what you declare to be the most competitive, better than mindbenders weapon?

Cause you and everyone else complaining are wrong."

Just because something is the only guaranteed way of getting an exotic doesn't mean it is fun or exciting, especially when the rolls are so rng and especially when i can't chose which exotic it is and even more so when it's one exotic for only one of my three characters a week.

Xur will only even have a chance at being exciting for older players only if and when he brings random rolls on all three armor pieces he brings each week and gives you a way to focus your fated engram to a specific exotic you want a roll of.

The last thing destiny needs is more rng, and bungie just seems intent on adding more instead of listening to players. 

Maybe you guys should tell the team that IS responsible for rewards to contact us, because they are apparently not listening as much as you guys when you say you'll let the teams know.

DestinyTheGame,fcvqctf,t1_fcvfnve,1578007722.0,"I suppose i should contextualize enemy amount, because what i mean is how enemies spawn. Currently, a map will have several spawn points, and if you are within a certain distance of those spawn points, enemies won't spawn. The easiest place to see this is in the dreaming city right outside the area you would go into blind well from. 

Kill the enemies and stand there, and nothing will spawn there if you stay in the area, until an enemy moving against each other event happens. What this means is on unpopulated maps, you can roam around, continuously finding enemies to fight, but as more guardians show up, more areas stay blank as guardians cross control paths. I've seen players literally abuse this spawn mechanic to try and get other players to leave an area.

This mechanic was in d1 too, and with many bounties and quests being final blows based, patrol can feel like more competition than it is worth. And when i have to position my character just right in an area to abuse spawn zones, it takes the patrol out of patrol."

A public event update might be good. The vex invasion felt kinda fun, but my favorite thing in d1 was where a taken event and public event happened at the same time. Patrols also need a bit more enemies on the map, especially because player presence actively causes enemies not to spawn. I've legitimate had players abuse this to get me to leave the zone. That's a bigger problem with ""final blows"" style bounties and objectives though (btw, final blows quest steps actively suck and cause way to many problems in this game) and less about other problems."
DestinyTheGame,fcv4l1q,t1_fcuwtld,1577994523.0,"I think my biggest problem in all this is losing access to the weapons/armor. 

Something that should have been thought up before the decision to remove content at the end of the season, was where the rewards of that content would go for future grinding. I think a good idea would be to give Rahool 'engrams' to purchase stuff specifically froma  season, so on top of his basic legendary he could have a ""Season of the undying"" engram that gives the vex offensive weapons and season armor randomly.

But if i had to say anything, it's that I don't know why solutuons like this aren't thought up before the content is finished, it can't be a secret that people get upset when content they paid for becomes unavailable. it's one of the main reasons i will never spend money on silver for this game, and that's because I, as a player, literally cannot trust that the content i purchased will be available later, or that the rewards will be. How can i be comfortable spending extra money on a game when the money i've already paid can't guarantee to bring me value?

If i bought the season of the undying, and say, couldn't play the whole season, what exactly would i have to show for it? that's what you need to ask yourselves. what are you selling if the content is removed and no way to get the rewards was worked out before that?"
