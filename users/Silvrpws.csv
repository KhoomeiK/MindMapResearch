aww,fdxzspl,t1_fdwhc7n,1578774605.0,"Now that is fascinating! Thanks for the info, I did not know that."
aww,fdxzhc0,t1_fdxk6wz,1578774499.0,"Thank you,  it is a wonder what a little love will do. I was hoping to know that way we could have an idea on what kind of illnesses to look out for in his breed. Paco suffers terribly from a skin condition that even the vet has not been able to complete cure or figure out, he has meds but they are not much help to him..In the meantime I’m trying to gather as much information as possible, Paco is on a special diet."
aww,fdwan21,t1_fdwa6ty,1578756756.0,🤣 I always thought he looked like Sid from Ice age. Thanks for the laugh.
aww,fdw8zg5,t1_fdw77pu,1578756293.0,I just googled them...I shouldn’t have! They are adorable 😍
aww,fdw8mfi,t1_fdw4wii,1578756211.0,Your dog sounds beautiful! Really? I thought chihuahua had short legs? All the chihuahua I’ve gotten have come with short legs. I’m new to the dog world. I’ve had dogs for a couple of years almost 3. I’m a former cat lady.♥️
aww,fdw88ij,t1_fdw5jrc,1578756069.0,"How did it not drive you crazy obsessing over doggos?! I used to be a cat lady and got my first dog a couple of years ago...since most of them have been rescues we don’t know what breed they are...not that it should matter but you know the saying...curiosity killed the cat.

Thank you for the suggestion , I am going to ask my vet on Pacos next appointment. I have another dog also I would like to find out more about. Or I’m gonna go nuts.♥️"
aww,fdw70t8,t1_fdw4wii,1578755740.0,Thank you. I am thinking that will be on the to do list on Paco’s next vet visit. I will ask and see if they could do it there. ♥️
aww,fdw3hog,t1_fdw2a7v,1578754714.0,"Yes, he looks mostly chihuahua but has super long pogo sticks for legs. He runs super fast too, hard to catch especially when he’s done a no no. 🤣"
aww,fdw37qa,t1_fdw2jb8,1578754613.0,Oh wow! Really?! I didn’t know that particular breed existed! 😱I’m amazed. They are beautiful dogs. Thank you!
aww,fdw302v,t1_fdw24wt,1578754542.0,"Oh! Thank you. It never crossed my mind.  And yes, he is a cutie pie thanks ♥️"
aww,fdw2u4a,t1_fdw0pyz,1578754483.0,"Thank you, he has the attitude of a Chi ♥️"
aww,fdw2obx,t1_fdw0pyz,1578754423.0,"Yes, I agree I see the chihuahua part, I just wish I knew what other breed he was mixed with and if someone has a dog similar to him. We got Paco as a rescue. He weighed less than a pound when he got here. Now he’s a big boy."
aww,fdw2eoc,t1_fdw0p2r,1578754313.0,"Yes, he looks mostly chihuahua but he also looks mixed, I was shocked when the vet told us he weighs 12lbs and how long he is."
aww,fdw25ok,t1_fdw0hr5,1578754215.0,"Thank you, I never seen a chi weenie, I will look them up ♥️"
aww,fdw1vx5,t1_fdw02wt,1578754174.0,"Thank you, I do see the chihuahua in him but he looks mixed to me for some reason. I have other chihuahuas and he just stands out."
aww,fdw1god,t1_fdw0jat,1578754111.0,"Thank you, I  thought he was chihuahua but he outgrew my other chihuahuas and his neck and legs are freakishly long."
aww,fdqn2a0,t1_fdqhqe1,1578670548.0,"Unfortunately the only fabrics I have left are the  really fancy sequined fabrics, beaded laced fabrics...more like bridal fabrics. I doubt the animals from Australia are going to be dressing up for a soirée anytime soon 😖 I am going to look again through my fabrics and see if I get lucky and find some useful items. Thank you for the idea! ♥️"

aww,fdpnn56,t1_fdplu8v,1578633868.0,If I wasn’t in excruciating pain daily I would have loved to sew many things to ship out but my body has failed me. I thank everyone from the bottom of my heart who takes the time to craft these delicate items for these poor animals. My family and I are making a donation on pay day since they know how much I wanted to help but can’t.

AmItheAsshole,fdpb61v,t3_emjfbh,1578624258.0,"NTA- I know they don’t have to give you anything for your birthday but it sucks that someone you consider a close friend  would acknowledge and show they care about you just like you did on their special day even if their gift is handmade or of a lesser value.

The same thing happened to my sister on our birthday back in high school. My sister got her best friend an expensive perfume , sweater and  a card and we took her out to dinner to celebrate her birthday with a bunch of friends. Well when my sisters and Is birthday came, we didn’t even get a happy birthday from her, the material things don’t matter but to have your best friend completely forget about you hurt my sister...

The next year  my sisters friend was making a big fuss that her birthday was coming around again. So I got her a card and told her I was giving her 50 bucks for her birthday. She got excited tore open the birthday card, saw that it was a chicken on the front and on the inside there was 50 BUCKS, BUCKS,  just for her."

AmItheAsshole,fdfipts,t3_el44v4,1578362635.0,"YTA, you sound entitled. Just because you go to school and have a 4.0 does not mean you don’t have to contribute to chores around the house. You do live, eat, sleep, use things in the house and make a mess right? Your mom might be a stay at home mom but that does not mean she has to cater to you guys 24/7.  My mother was a stay at home mom and we always helped her with the chores and kept up with our good grades.  If you really wanted to you could set aside time to help her out, she would much appreciate it...remember her job at home too is hard."
aww,fd3dnbl,t3_ejyhxm,1578157270.0,I’m so happy Palmer hasn’t had an episode in 4 years thanks to his meds. Here’s hoping 🤞 he doesn’t have any in the future. Sweet boy! ♥️
