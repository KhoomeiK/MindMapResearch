IllegalLifeProTips,ff70beb,t1_ff6w8ja,1579638564.0,I don’t understand why you say so little is known though. There’s been so many different types of studies on all forms of cannabis
IllegalLifeProTips,ff6uyrz,t1_ff6nw58,1579635422.0,"I’m sorry man it really doesn’t though. Long time (and if you have kept with it over years chances are it’s a heavy amount) you don’t have these problems. Also, if it did happen to you even on occasion you shouldn’t smoke at all, the subconscious stress of knowing it COULD happen, can in itself trigger it, I can understand that, but at that point you shouldn’t be a marijuana smoker."

IllegalLifeProTips,ff6m2h0,t1_ff6iiua,1579630095.0,Random panic attack after smoking? Iv had that happen twice and that was when I was a kid and didn’t smoke regularly. If you smoke regularly it has the complete opposite effect.
