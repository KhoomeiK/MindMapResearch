conspiracy,ferq4s8,t1_feq969j,1579357063.0,"One time, when my husband and I were still dating, we were just driving around after midnight (scandalous, I know). A cop started following me and of course I get tense and as I'm going around a curve, my tire touched the center line and he pulled me over. He interrogated the shit out of me to the point I started crying, asking me if I had dryer sheets in my car (I don't do drugs or drink but I found out later apparently dryer sheets can be used to cover the scent of marijuana?). He got even more intense BECAUSE I was crying, telling me I was acting guilty. He made me get out of the car (I was young and didn't realize I could've told him no) so he could search my car. My husband was soooooo pissed because of his treatment of me and the cop picked up on that and acted like this was also a sign of guilt. Dude was obviously a newer cop (he and I had actually gone to HS together but we didn't know each other, I just recognized him) and did a full search of my car while his backup (a woman) tried to distract me by having a totally random discussion about family and everyday life. It ended with him finding absolutely nothing in my car and saying, ""see, there was nothing to cry about"". He badgered and acted like I was a criminal the whole 30 minutes or so and he was surprised that I, a female, would get emotional. That was over ten years ago and I'm getting pissed just typing it."

I can't pinpoint how soon after but I ended up blown up in cystic acne, all over my face. It was gross looking and painful and there was absolutely nothing else that it could have been. Thankfully it's all under control now but I was a pizza face for about 4 years.

Edited to add that I meant I was curious what reactions your kids had. Was it a skin reaction or more internal? I hope that's not too personal a question."
