Some ways I regress in secret are by watching cartoons or children's movies, playing kids game online or on another system, wearing cute (but fairly normal) clothes that make me feel smaller, and preparing lots of cute little snacks for myself, like some fruit, cookies and crackers! If you can get yourself a plushie, hugging and playing with it can help a lot too, and a lot of teens have plushies anyways, so your parents wouldn't really worry, I don't think. Giving yourself a set of rules can help too. Like going to sleep at a specific time, making sure to do little self care things, eat a certain amount of meals a day, stuff like that!"

asktransgender,fex8y7n,t3_eqpopj,1579427028.0,"Hey. Trans guy here. I don't understand the mass majority of FTMs with this fetish, but for quite a few of them it comes out of trauma. Some cis guys like being humiliated and feminized beyond where they're comfortable. With trans guys it's a lot more complicated but it still happens. 

Regarding what you said about trenders, unfortunately they do exist. But not all trans guys who have a forced feminization fantasy don't experience dysphoria or are trenders. Some are, yes, but not all of them. Trauma is a big thing when it comes to kinks at times, and can change a lot. Being misgendered constantly really humiliates me and makes me feel worthless. Feeling like that in a sexual atmosphere turns on some people. Kind of related to rape/humiliation fantasies.

Try to realize that the people who are like this are very small. There's not a lot of them, and please try not to change your views on the whole community because of this. In every community, there are some bad apples that make everyone else look crazy or like a joke. Just have to try to draw the line between who is who. Good luck, OP."

People should stop whining about smaller chested folks complaining about chest dysphoria. We still experience it and it's pretty bad at times. I have a small chest, but still get hella dysphoric about it and it's caused me a lot of problems.

Your boyfriend might get used to your body with time and find a lot of beauty in it again, or he might not. It's impossible to say. No matter what, stay confident as you can about your body and know that you don't have to change it for anyone except yourself.
