aww,fetyts6,t1_ferwjys,1579381429.0,"They are all fluff! They weight so little and have the softest fur ever, that when you hold one, you can hardly feel it!"
aww,fetyled,t1_fet4y97,1579381355.0,It is all fluff! They are really little!
trees,fejranb,t1_fef6egy,1579183883.0,Exactly! She probably worked her whole life and is now enjoying retirement! Or am I projecting! That is my idea of a good retirement plan!
trees,fejqvsl,t1_fee17fe,1579183582.0,I also liked when she said to go out and drop those pebbles of positivity!
gifs,fec82mc,t1_fec1ffu,1578968275.0,Why?
vegastrees,fe6aa9y,t1_fdru15a,1578885321.0,"I disagree. The thc and terpene levels are excellent and 2-pack of .6gms (for a total of 1.2 for $11+tx is excellent price. Before you believe these comments, try googling it on sites you respect."
MadeMeSmile,fdrio1q,t3_emtkrx,1578685110.0,Nice!
aww,fdrhx7b,t3_emo1aa,1578684706.0,That is completely adorable!

BeAmazed,fdrfl6m,t3_empxlk,1578683826.0,I am so sorry about the horrible fires and suffering of so many animals! It is so sad.
vegastrees,fdrd91g,t3_emuucb,1578682868.0,"I disagree with the guy's advice not to get prerolls! Dispensaries in Vegas sell all types of prerolls, including top shelf and infused. They range from $6 to $16 and some super ones infused with hash and oils for more. But even the inexpensive ones, like Flora Vega gives you two .6gm pre-rolls (1.2 grams total) for $11 plus tax, with high levels of thc and lots of terpenes.  Check it out! Just google Flora Vega prerolls.  Don't believe the guy who says prerolls are ""ass""--some are fantastic and a very good deal."

UpliftingNews,fdcd8wp,t1_fdcbzd1,1578272076.0,"It is the biggest rip off, like a twist on Russian Roulette--you know you are going die before 120 years, likely 80, but could be anytime-- you don't know when or how. Surprise! Ugh. But life doesn't suck--death does. So all we can do is enjoy life all we can, while we've got it!"
funny,fafybui,t1_faenux2,1576035003.0,"Very cool of you to explain this. I totally get it! They are all good reasons, both the physical and mental."
