politics,ff6lenu,t1_ff6k0is,1579629690.0,"Elsewhere in scripture, the phrase, ""they did what was right in their own eyes"" is intended to express wickedness. One of the central ideas in Christianity is that the path of least resistance, the easy path that we can follow, is the one that leads to the most immoral behavior. The heart of man is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked, who can know it?

This differs greatly from most common secular morality, where you are not doing wrong if you are not hurting anybody.

The point of the ten commandments isn't a set of rules to follow, but that it is a diagnostic tool that shows how incapable we are of controlling ourselves. Paul the apostle talks about how before he had read that ""you shall not covet,"" he hadn't ever even thought about it, but that now that he knows it is wrong, he can't help it.

The point is that human nature is flawed and we are not capable of true moral behavior over a lifetime, and thus we need to have some way of not being held accountable. Thus, Jesus dying for the sins of the world.

It is human to sin, which means to miss the mark. Like a bullseye of right thought and conduct, but we lack the dexterity to hit. We need someone else to take the shot, and let it count for our score.

Humanity is fundamentally flawed, but worth saving. But we shouldn't be left to our own devices."

politics,ff6f2cb,t1_ff6c37q,1579625798.0,"Creationism should result in a population earnest in being good stewards of the planet. It isn't the cause of the problem. It isn't necessary to believe in evolution to be interested in taking care of the world. Climate change I don't get. The Bible talks about the tower of Babel, saying that if the people are not divided by confusing their languages, they would be capable of anything. Well, in aggregate we are capable of influencing the climate of the planet. Again, it isn't the Christianity of the republican party that should be leading to the problems we see. It's an ideology that really doesn't arise from belief in the Bible. It's not about Christianity. It's about corporate greed and refusal of the elite to surrender control in order to prevent catastrophe."

TrueChristian,feiwp1u,t3_epb9vs,1579149281.0,"God's realness is not contingent upon His answering of your prayers how you wish. Sorry if that sounds harsh. I don't intend it to.

God has a plan for you. A plan for His will to be carried out. You and I can accept that His plan is better than our plans, even if we don't profit from His will for us.

God is good, and all good things come from Him. But it is spiritual maturity to accept that God does not always mean for us to have what we want. If it brings about what God wants, who am I to say God can't have my life to use as He sees fit?

Jesus, Peter, Paul, and many others suffered for God. You are looking at the surface things of your life. Ask God to help you see the world from His perspective. He wants for you what is best, but it may not at all be what you expect.

I pray that God blesses you with wisdom and will guide you through this present trouble and on to the path He has for you, and that your faith will grow.

It isn't until we are seeking His will that He can give us the desires of our hearts, because it is only when we desire what He desires that He can grant it.

Be ready to accept what the Father has chosen for you. And don't blame God when you are not getting what you want. What God wants is far more important, and better for you, too.

Edit: I've been praying and thinking, and first of all I really don't want to give you the impression that God is angry with you in any way or that He is refusing to bless you. It seems to me that this is far from true. I really think God is blessing you. He has heard your prayer. He may be giving you a blessing in a way that you can't see right now. This is a pivotal moment in the path of your life? Maybe God is steering you.

Have you pursued success by studying in addition to your prayers? Is there another path that you have been wondering about? Can you take some time and really examine where you are in life and what you think God wants for you?

I hope you know I do not speak for God and that God is not angry with you. I pray that God will bless you and keep you.

Would you do me a favor and consider reading a book called the Practice of the Presence of God by brother Lawrence? If you have an android phone you can install the AndBible app and download it under books. It's a great Bible app as well. But it is available for free online here.

https://churchleaders.com/pastors/free-resources-pastors/145403-brother-lawrence-free-ebook-the-practice-of-the-presence-of-god.html

It's also free on Amazon.

It's a simple and short book that I think will give you a great insight into what it looks like to live for God.

Again, I'm so sorry if I sounded harsh earlier. God told Moses the first time to strike the rock, and it gave water. But the second time God told him to speak to the rock. He struck the rock again, breaking what was meant to be prophetic of Christ, and wrongly expressing to the israelites that they had angered God. I don't want to do that here.

Be patient if you can. I know it's hard. God will see you through. It may not be prosperity for you, but if it comes from God, it's going to be good."
