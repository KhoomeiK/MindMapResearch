For example I've seen people complaining about me meleeing them when their using a shotgun, imo if you get killed by a melee while using a shotgun....you deserve it"

Ireland was bombed in ww2 and there was a Nazi plan to invade Ireland known as Operation Emerald that never went into fruition even then Ireland as a country while favourjng the allied side, never officially joined the war along with the allied, it didnt send the IRA(or equivalent national army at the time) though it  did facilitate Irish men enlisting in British forces(since tens of thousand of them are by law subjects of the crown).
Beyond this the most vital thing Ireland provided was the use of the Shannon airport for transportation from North America"

titanfall,fckzdbf,t1_fckyheg,1577736453.0,I admit I don't see much dmr in action but still I only see spitfires once every 6 or 7 games and even more if we are talking about threat scope cloak spitfire. The spitfire can really only consistently kill you of your moving in a predictable pattern cz that spitfire user MUST kill you within the first 3 shot or his recoil Gona be all over the place. I'm your mind you seem to see the spitfire as some sort of a CIWS when in fact your not Gona hit shit by holding down the left mouse button on a spitfire and trying to hit a pilot who know your approximate location and how to use cover to get close enough to kill you. Since the spitfire can only retain decent accuracy within 3 shot it basically a bigger hemlok in some respects (at least it should be treated as such)

titanfall,fckdaqh,t1_fckcrci,1577722757.0,"As someone who averages around 25-30 kill per game I don't recall having any issues dealing with spitfire users, sure they can be annoying at time but saying that a low shot to kill count at long ranges can also be applied to snipers,leavers are a 1 shot kill dmr are 2 shot yet I don't see people complaining about them, there have been many times where I could outgun a spitfire at medium-long range by simply hip firing my r97"
