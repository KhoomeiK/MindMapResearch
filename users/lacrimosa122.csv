AmItheAsshole,ffe600o,t1_ffe3uft,1579837609.0,"The point is that in one of the cases, the animal dies instantaneously vs. in the other, the animal slowly bleeds out."
UTAustin,ff6m6vv,t3_ernkm1,1579630169.0,Would also like to know this. I'm taking it with Guler this semester and I've heard it was pretty hard.
UTAustin,ff6m0nl,t1_ff4sex0,1579630065.0,"I'm a journalism major! The classes are pretty easy honestly. I didn't have any background in journalism like some of the other people in the major (working for high school newspaper, broadcasting team, etc.) but the professors and classes are great and teach you lots of skills that can transfer to other careers. There's actually a huge tech focus in the journalism field right now so there are tons of classes that are coding or programming or app development based just for journalists."

UTAustin,ff3hlkx,t3_erg6gp,1579541204.0,"One of the best things about UT being so big is that you can easily avoid people you don't want to see and find new people to be friends with! I suggest finding smaller, niche orgs to join as the members are usually close friends because it's not as structured as bigger orgs are. There's probably an org for anything on campus and you'll definitely be able to find a place that aligns with your interests. Also, I suggest volunteering at various events around Austin if you're able. I volunteer at marathons/book fairs all the time and it's not only fun, but you can also find people to talk to."
UTAustin,fezbbet,t1_fez5624,1579455637.0,"I got mine out last February. Definitely should've gotten them out over the break. I kept falling asleep in class because of the painkillers. Luckily, some of my professors understood. But it was around the same time one of my professors brought Tiff's to class and I couldn't eat it. I couldn't eat without being in pain for about a solid month. But overall, it's not that bad."
UTAustin,feppbni,t1_fepmy9m,1579326838.0,"Hmm, probably children's lit. I took it in person and ended up with a 102. Also social media journalism if you love tweeting and creating Instagram stories! You don't have to think about the assignments until the day they're due and there were only 4 classes throughout the semester which were 10-15 minutes long and you could watch them whenever you wanted as long as you watched them and submitted the code word in them before the deadline. I've just taken a ton of classes overall so it's hard to find a class that a) fits into my schedule b) is interesting and easy c) i haven't taken before and d) could help my upper-division GPA."
Professors,feolkl2,t1_feohniy,1579301890.0,"When I was in high school, I used to give my favorite teachers gifts at the end of the year. But it was like chocolates and school supplies and stuff, not hundred dollar bills. That's just outright bribery."
AmItheAsshole,feof1n8,t1_fenpuzl,1579299212.0,"That is why I said unless poor service is a pattern. Otherwise there's minimal punishment for being, say, aloof or unfriendly or even not offering good service. You're already paying the cost of the food AND the service in this case. There's a delivery charge tacked on to the order of your food. It's not like you get free delivery. The tip is optional and should be so people don't take advantage of the tipping culture like you're saying."
AmItheAsshole,fenmbze,t1_fenggle,1579287753.0,"You're diverting the topic of the conversation entirely to servers at restaurants when the topic of the conversation is delivery drivers. They don't tip out to anybody. Not only that, but they're paid better than servers at restaurants. Maybe not way better, but better at least. 

I am refusing to pay peoples' wages if they don't do their job properly. At any other work environment, if you only do the bare minimum you're required (in this case, the bare minimum would include door delivery so not even that) then you will be out of a job and your wage will be $0 anyways. Restaurants and delivery services are more lax on that already since they don't have the onus to pay the server/delivery driver as much as the customers do since you're right, their wages do come from tips. Because poor service ideally means the customer won't tip and that means the server will get punished anyways, so the restaurant/delivery service doesn't have to punish the staff for every transgression they way a regular job would unless poor service is a pattern. 

Imagine working at an auto shop and the company policy is a complimentary car wash after every service request and the employee doesn't do that. Customer gets angry -> complains -> if the staff member has done it often enough, they get fired because poor service means the company looks bad.

In a previous thread, a lot of servers commented that without tips, they wouldn't want to give exceptional service. I say that's wrong. If you're employed and don't want to perform the duties of your job, then you shouldn't be working there. Let someone else do it. There are lots of people looking for jobs anyways. It's pure entitlement in my opinion. If it's a requirement of the job, you gotta do it or else you either a) don't get paid or b) get fired. If you don't like it, you can look for another job. That's usually how the world works I think."
AmItheAsshole,fend58a,t1_fenbhuc,1579282138.0,"Exactly. And I would even say sometimes laziness is okay. Maybe you're sick and don't want to go outside in the hot/humid/cold weather and exacerbate your illness or maybe you just came home from a 12 hour shift and want to sit down on your couch and not get up again. The drivers don't know other people's circumstances and if the expectation of door delivery is created by the company, they should be following that expectation accordingly."
AmItheAsshole,fencyb3,t1_fenbgrz,1579282023.0,"That's not the customer's fault. The definition of a tip is ""a sum of money given to someone as a reward for their services."" If the service is poor or incomplete, there should be no tip. What you're saying is basically a pity wage. Does anyone want that and should they expect it? Should people expect to be paid just because they're not earning enough? If they do need to earn more, they can easily offer better service and earn it fairly. What about other poorly paid people in the world in other industries? If you feel they should be paid by people who are not their employers for sub par work, then maybe you should pay them all."
AmItheAsshole,fen8zv6,t1_felmz5r,1579279588.0,"As a business major, I went through that phase myself many times in the last 4 years. From wanting to go into software design to acting to aerospace engineering, but once you actually get into the groove of your major, it becomes easier to love it."
UTAustin,femz4au,t1_fem7tu4,1579273286.0,"That seems kinda difficult. I'm not very math or science inclined. I'd definitely take it if I wasn't taking 18 other hours this semester, but since my course load is already so full, it'd be awesome to have a class that's a bit on the easier side."
UTAustin,femyyr2,t1_fem9e6u,1579273181.0,"I'm currently in that one this semester! I'm just asking this question cause I've taken most of the popular easy A classes: young adult lit, children's lit, edp, human sexuality, social media journalism... It's hard to find classes I haven't taken!"
AmItheAsshole,femypug,t1_femq68s,1579273013.0,"Those wages are not tips. Your money comes from your employer and if they are not satisfied with your work, they can choose to let you go. Same with customers. If your money comes from customers and they are not satisfied with your work, they can choose not to pay you the extra that is expected for satisfactory work because they don't have control over your work status."
AmItheAsshole,fem6qan,t1_felrsoh,1579241719.0,I would say the same thing applies to the delivery drivers as well. Do they know if someone is disabled and may have a hard time leaving their home without assistance? Or someone who may be super busy and ordered something because it would be quick and easy? Delivery drivers often do have the obligation to go to the door to deliver the food and they should provide that full service if they can.
AmItheAsshole,fem6f30,t1_felsqgm,1579241396.0,"Providing service is part of their job. If they don't do their job, they don't get paid. Can you give me an example of a job where you can get paid even when you're only putting in the bare minimum? I'm sure everyone here would love to know. Also, you only earn what you work for. People don't have to give away their money if they didn't receive a good or service in exchange for it. That's just giving a donation."
AmItheAsshole,fem6629,t1_felplm8,1579241143.0,They're only away from their cars/bikes for a couple minutes max. It's not likely they'll have to pay for parking or get a ticket in those 2-3 minutes that they're gone.
UTAustin,feirjih,t3_ep7sfs,1579145401.0,"I did it and it wasn't really helpful. I couldn't understand the codes and stuff they put on my file, so it wasn't really useful in a sense where I could pinpoint how likely I was to be admitted or how I squared up to other applicants/students."
UTAustin,feire4p,t3_ep8lr8,1579145297.0,"I was top 19% from a really competitive high school in the Houston area and had a 2190 SAT and got accepted to McCombs. The top 10% went to Ivy League schools and there are a ton of people from my high school at UT so it seems like the name coming up from various student apps also helped my admission. I took about 17 AP classes so in terms of course difficulty, it was also a bonus. I think it'll be alright if your high school is really competitive because they understand that your rank was probably deflated due to that and that it's really not a negative indicator of college performance."
AmItheAsshole,feicwik,t1_feicgdn,1579135563.0,"That's very interesting. I've had the opposite experience with that. People always order appetizers personally because some people want them, some people don't and the portions are smaller. And then the main course is done shared if it's an Asian cuisine or pizza or something and individually if it's a western dish like burgers or pasta."
AmItheAsshole,feic6e3,t1_fei8yx8,1579135077.0,Yea I think that's because portions here tend to be larger also.
AmItheAsshole,feibpii,t1_fei42q0,1579134765.0,"Just curious, how do y'all do appetizers? Individually or family style? It seems kinda crazy to me to eat like 6 spring rolls in a sitting as an appetizer and then a main course as well or something. Idk if it's just because I'm Indian and our cuisine also has a family style concept that I don't get not eating it family style."
AmItheAsshole,feib6s5,t1_fehwpnu,1579134415.0,I'm in the South as well and all the places I've been to have been family style. They have gigantic servings and often put huge serving spoons/forks on each plate anyways. It'd be hard not to figure out that each dish is meant to be shared. Plus they often give you individual plates for a reason.
UTAustin,fehxqvx,t1_fehxaxk,1579125976.0,"That's definitely crazy. My roommate and I had a private bathroom for about $11,500 and that was only 3 years ago. Plus, tuition was closer to $5k and now it's almost over $6k."
UTAustin,fehxh44,t1_fehivtx,1579125814.0,"I don't think it would be a good idea for you to take all these classes at the same time. BA 324 will be very, very intensive and depending on your professor, you're probably going to get a B or B-. The highest grade in my class was a B+ and only 4 people got it. And that's if you spend a lot of time working on the assignments and project. If you're taking this many hours, you're definitely not going to have the time. I would also make sure they're not going to drop you from BA 324 as soon as classes start if you don't meet the prereqs. It's weird that you're able to sign up for it with 101 and 311."
UTAustin,fehx7ny,t1_fehlism,1579125659.0,"They changed the meal plan/housing system after I moved out of the dorms in 2017, so I don't really know much about it, sorry! I'd still count on it being about $11-12k, including food. Maybe if the meal card is optional or something, it could be a couple grand less..."
UTAustin,fehf765,t1_feheln6,1579115295.0,"Of course it depends on departments, but there are some (Management comes to mind) where the department heads have the flexibility to address those themselves. But I would ask the professor first. And if they can't help you or don't recommend you to the department head, try the advising office. But the advising office is a lot more strict with issues like this. I had to bring in proof that I was working on Mondays and Fridays so I could take all my classes T/TH. Professors generally just add you to the class."
UTAustin,fehewwr,t3_ep65yk,1579115127.0,"I took an English class this winter break online through DCCCD. I had assignments due every day so it got kinda tiring but in terms of difficulty, it wasn't very bad. Probably spent about 2-3 hours on assignments per day, mostly less."
UTAustin,fehep8b,t3_ep6hvh,1579115002.0,"The number's probably around $25k/yr for tuition, housing and books. Tuition is approximately $6k/semester, housing (dorms) about $11-12k/yr, books about $500/semester. There probably is a more specific breakdown somewhere but tuition is rising a lot per year so I'd estimate about a $300-$500 increase coming up soon."
UTAustin,fehedgx,t1_feh9hx9,1579114812.0,It depends. Some departments have that kind of flexibility and they can add you to the class manually. I did that for Human Sexuality and was able to bypass the waitlist entirely.
UTAustin,fehe6pd,t1_fehck0x,1579114705.0,"I've had good experiences with smaller departments where I emailed the professor and they recommended emailing the department head. They were able to manually add me to the class, no questions asked."
UTAustin,feh8g6g,t3_eoyhio,1579111306.0,"Can you even take BA 324 without having BA 101 and ACC 311/312 completed? Are you registered for all these classes right now? You could always do the quant track in the finance major if you want that experience. CS may be difficult to double major in, so I'd go for Math instead."
UTAustin,feh840o,t3_ep5f6h,1579111108.0,They can only help you get into required classes if you need them. They won't be able to do anything about switching time slots. You can email the professor for the 8-9 class or department head and they may be able to do something.
UTAustin,fefv2vd,t3_eovm0w,1579066142.0,"It's first come, first serve as far as I know. You don't need to buy tickets, it's free. A lot of people buy invitations through the Co-op though."
UTAustin,fefuui5,t1_fefh7od,1579065927.0,"Yea, it's going to be a tough semester. I'm also going to be taking intermediate next semester and I've heard it's really hard no matter who your professor is. FIN 367 wasn't so bad for me but I took it over the summer as a study abroad class. I'm sure it'll be a bit harder as a semester class. Valuation was extremely tough for a couple of my friends. I didn't take it, but it seems like it could be a very difficult class and despite taking it with Sury, a lot of people still got B's and C's. Management is pretty easy, but I totally underestimated the amount of time this class takes. It's very project intensive and you'll definitely spend a lot of time outside of class reading cases, preparing for exams and working on the semester-long project. However, the content is pretty easy and interesting."
UTAustin,fefuicp,t3_eo97qe,1579065616.0,"It's gonna be a hell of a last semester. If anyone has taken these classes, how are they?

todayilearned,fefdlp8,t1_feek9ox,1579054047.0,"That's how some Indian addresses are. The name of your neighborhood, the area it's closest to. My grandparents' address literally says ""across \_\_\_\_\_\_ hospital"". It's more like directions to an area rather than an address."
UTAustin,fefcsz3,t1_feepgu0,1579053532.0,"I'm taking 326 this upcoming semester, so unfortunately, I can't speak on that too well. However, while 312 doesn't directly correlate to topics in other finance classes, you will learn terminology that will be extremely beneficial to you in your future career and will occasionally be referenced in upper division finance classes. Plus, you learn more about how to record transactions as well as additional things that go in the balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, etc. 

I know in my 311 class, my professor totally skipped the cash flow statement section and told us not to worry about it for that class, but it will be taught in 312 and is so incredibly important for finance. It's probably the most relevant financial statement for finance majors. 311 and 312 are very different topic-wise, so look at 312 as a fresh start. Definitely brush up on credits/debits, how income statements and balance sheets are structured, different aspects of what goes in what financial statement and where (accounts receivable, accounts payable, etc.) and you'll probably be fine! 

We always tend to worry about GPA and stuff (which is definitely important) but learning topics that will be relevant for future jobs is equally important. You probably won't get the same level of education online at a CC as you will actually going to class and seeing a professor explain how the topics work."
UTAustin,feelycv,t3_eoq4hf,1579036437.0,"I don't think you should take 312 at CC or any business class for that matter. Each class you take at McCombs will undoubtedly help you get the basics down if you're planning on pursuing a finance-related career path. (Take advantage of the fact that this is one of the best business schools in the country!) Especially accounting since accounting and finance often tend to overlap. Plus, you'll definitely need to take intermediate accounting at some point and you have to take that at UT, so definitely keep that in mind. I also didn't like 311 as much, but I really enjoyed 312. I've heard that's often the case. 312 tends to be more theoretical than 311, so sometimes if you don't like one, you may love the other.

I also should include that FIN 357 is an incredibly important class for finance majors. If you're taking it during a Maymester, definitely see if you can at least sit in on some of the classes during the semester to supplement that. Summer classes go by incredibly fast and professors may not get the chance to fully cover topics like they could in a regular semester. I took 367 during a summer study abroad session and I had to catch up a lot when I took my finance electives since the knowledge builds and professors tend not to cover basics again."
UTAustin,feelnqb,t3_eoqsw9,1579036267.0,"I think if you didn't get this notice through a SAN and if this isn't a UT-affiliated honor society, it's not worth it to join.

The most unbiased judgments can come from those who don't relate to either person on either side of the issue. Unless they're saying something factually incorrect, which I don't believe they are.

I did the same when I was younger. I promised my parents I'd study an extra hour each day for the rest of the week if they took me to the movies. It was easy not to follow through. 

I think this is a good punishment and should not be reconsidered. Bullying can ruin people's lives and drive them to the brink of horrible things. Teenagers can be stupid and not understand the consequences of their actions before they experience it firsthand. It's better to impose a punishment and give the daughter a learning opportunity to change before she harms someone else. Plus, how horrible would it feel for the other girl to find out that her bully walked scot-free? She should be thankful the school didn't expel or suspend her. My high school had a zero tolerance policy when it came to bullying. Instant expulsion. She got off easy in my opinion."

If you take away the punishment or not follow through on it, then she won't learn that lesson. I personally think there should be a combination of punishment and learning opportunities. For example, take away prom and parties, but also have her work a part-time job or volunteer or whatever so she can grow. She clearly doesn't have much empathy or kindness towards other people and what's done is done. No one can go back and un-bully that girl.

college,fdsejtt,t3_emxnbq,1578700892.0,"I think you should go up on the second/third day of class and talk to your professor about it. Last semester, my mom had some health issues which required me to go back to my hometown every weekend and drive back the morning of my first class of the week. As it was a three hour drive, I knew there was a possibility I'd be late sometimes so I told my professor who said it was okay if I was able to come in late and sneak to the back of the class quietly without getting points off attendance. But definitely don't misuse that leniency if you get it and make sure to still submit your work on time and stuff."

coolguides,fdromg6,t1_fdrng8y,1578687428.0,"I saw other comments asking why foreign aid is going to India because people assumed it wasn't struggling as much as other countries and my reply was written with the assumption that you were asking the same. I'd say it's really what other countries are saying that Japan and Germany are forming political partnerships through this. That's a good question though, don't know if those political partnerships are for social reasons or military reasons.

However, personally what surprised me the most is that India and the U.S. don't have this kind of relationship, whereas Afghanistan is the top country receiving foreign aid from America. Seems like America is supplying the Afghani government with aid so they can fight back against Taliban control, but why not aid India for the same reason because of the India-Pakistan tensions where Trump condemned Pakistan for supporting the Taliban a couple years back?"
AmItheAsshole,fdrnfui,t1_fdrjoc6,1578686961.0,"There was a Reddit post a while back about a guy who said his ex-girlfriend told him she was pregnant with his baby and they got back together. A couple months later, he got suspicious she wasn't showing or having any symptoms and she stated she had a miscarriage. This girl faked a whole miscarriage because she wanted to get back together with him! It happens."
coolguides,fdr8gad,t1_fdqg9a0,1578680954.0,"A lot of villages in India don't have access to some of the things we in the West take for granted such as access to public toilets, clean water, hygiene products, etc. The government is doing what it can, but processes to get each resource approved are so slow and have to pass through and be approved by many people so you could get years before a single proposal is even accepted. This aid can be really helpful to speed up governmental processes and increase the budget for spending in these cases."

AmItheAsshole,fdpezyo,t1_fdpeaje,1578626920.0,"Why should you expect that the person you hurt's family or friends will still want to support you after you hurt them? In many (if not most) splits where people just fall out of love or something where no one is at fault, they live amicably. Have you not seen any of the stories people have posted on here?

I don't know why so many of you are hell-bent on being ""technically correct"" and let her drown herself in doubts. Are you encouraging her not to get close to her husband's family for fear of them ditching her down the road? Her point is what exactly? Let me say it again for you real quick: GOOD PEOPLE DO NOT DITCH THEIR LOVED ONES FOR NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG. Yes, she is a loved one. She's their son's wife (meaning family). If they choose to have kids down the road, she'll technically even be related by blood.

She knows his family better than we do. If she trusts they're good people, why not let them in? Living in fear like that her whole life - it's just going to suck for her. Who cares that she's technically right? Why not encourage her to let people in without fear of getting hurt? I'm able to empathize with her situation, that's why I'm giving her good advice.

Edit: If that's your point, I'd say why even bother letting anyone in if they're not related by blood to you? Obviously they can only be family if there's genetic material linking both parties together. Everyone else should live in fear that they're going to get cut off and hold everyone at a distance, you're totally right. /s"
AskReddit,fdpefcy,t1_fdpdqdg,1578626514.0,"Yea, I'm not taking any sides publicly here. I just find it interesting that so many people can be misinformed or uninformed about different parties/candidates/elections/policies and still vote. I'd be happy if people just went out and voted AFTER educating themselves. It's okay to have different opinions, but at least know what opinions you're supporting."
AskReddit,fdpdlig,t1_fdpdj3p,1578625933.0,It's alright! It's an interesting thread :)
AskReddit,fdpdfjf,t1_fdpdcx3,1578625818.0,"I thought we were talking about the presidential election... Sure, for everything else popular vote counts."
AskReddit,fdpd665,t1_fdpc880,1578625637.0,"I don't think the popular vote counts for anything if a candidate is strategic with what states they target during campaigning. Trump's election was shocking; I don't think too many people anticipated he would win. I saw a lot of people calling his nomination/campaign a joke in 2015-2016. After he was elected, Trump supporters became more vocal about why they voted for him. The moral of this is basically you can never really have such high expectations when it comes to elections.

Warren and Sanders both have stuff going against them as well (gender and age, respectively) and so does Biden, but Biden's got the support of moderate Democrats whereas Warren and Sanders have the support of those to the far left. In my experience, people who swing to an extreme left or right of an issue or party are usually the most vocal since they tend to be the most passionate and less conflicted, kind of like a vocal minority. We might see more moderates come out of the woodwork if Biden wins the nomination. Those could easily be swing voters if Warren or Sanders do.

ETA: Since Warren and Sanders have the support of those to the far left, I'd wager they'd vote for Biden as well if he were nominated. Those supporters are generally loyal to the party of their favorite candidate or just to the party itself. If the situation was reversed and it was up to the moderate Democrats and Warren/Sanders was nominated, some may flip parties or not vote at all. I agree with the parent comment. Trump may be elected another term unless Biden secures the nomination."
AmItheAsshole,fdp54e9,t1_fdozsx0,1578620213.0,And I feel like you're either refusing to acknowledge my point or just ignoring it. Why does she have to worry about that if she's not going to cheat or do anything to purposely hurt her partner?
AskReddit,fdp4pv2,t1_fdp3jan,1578619944.0,"As we saw in the last election, polls are not very accurate, especially when the nominees are going head to head. Seems to me like the Democratic party has multiple strong (but very different) nominees this cycle, however, I predict they're going to be split apart regardless of who wins the nominations. The parent comment for this thread is perfect. There are many who don't like Biden who may not even go to vote if he's nominated just like there are many who don't like Warren and Sanders who will vote Trump if they are nominated."
FinancialCareers,fdo1h5s,t3_emdlp5,1578597144.0,"Yea I interned in AMG last summer. I don't know much about the C&IB interview process, but it's fairly straightforward. You'll probably only have a couple technical questions. Mine was, ""how do banks make money?"" And some more similarly easy questions like that. Just be friendly, exude sociability, and it'll all work out. Many of the people I had a Super Day with got an offer, so it's not impossible. As for the role, we worked closely with the C&IB department and everyone was really friendly and nice, especially those in the Relationship Management and Credit Products department.

OP's son is kinda sorta blaming her for not bending to her ex's wishes, because her ex won't even call his son outside of major holidays?!  It's time to put some accountability and blame on the dad gently instead of just taking it herself."
AmItheAsshole,fdlsgix,t1_fdls8vl,1578531416.0,"Well of course not, but you can't really expect that of anyone. There definitely are families out there who would think that's unacceptable behavior and not want to associate with someone who cheated on their partner, especially if their partner was amazing and really close to the family. 

In this case, that wouldn't really apply if OP isn't planning on cheating. That's probably why the husband was upset."
AmItheAsshole,fdlrjiz,t1_fdlqvm4,1578530792.0,"Yes, they might not cut him out even if he committed a mistake, but they probably wouldn't cut her out all the same. It would still be a family, with people looking out for her. If I cheated on an amazing partner and we were no longer together, my family would still maybe keep ties with me, but they would prioritize my partner over me especially if we were dating or married for a long period of time. They've been together 7 years! They're not just good friends."

Imo, those male coworkers should've brought the issue to attention as a way to correct the professional environment rather than heaping on OP to be quiet about it."

If the situation was reversed, I have a hard time believing any good family, blood-related or not, would cut OP off if she hadn't done anything shitty. If she wasn't close with his family, sure, but it looks like she's distancing herself here, not them, at least mentally. I'd do the same. Cut or limit ties with the person who did the shitty thing, not the person who was hurt."

AmItheAsshole,fdkx27g,t1_fdihmgf,1578512931.0,"Again, where does it say anything about how the son was raised? Parents can only do their best. They can't erase their kids' doubts or fears or insecurities even if they want to really badly. His insecurity is his own to vanquish. Teens who commit crimes often also claim they were bullied or insecure about themselves or whatever, does that mean their parents were to blame for how they turned out? Psychology names two ways in which children are raised: nature and nurture. Nurture isn't just on the parents, but rather the external environment as well such as peers, partners, colleagues, etc. Maybe the son was easily influenced by what he saw other people doing?"
college,fdkvo3o,t1_fdkpodq,1578512110.0,"I think that's usually an exception rather than the rule. In my district at one of the top schools in the state, teachers still only earn about $40-$50k. It also depends on what subject they teach. Our school specialized in foreign language classes so FL teachers were paid on the higher end of the scale along with other teachers for the required classes like math, science, english, etc. But if you're going to be a music or gym or art teacher, you're paid peanuts compared to what other teachers are paid, which is already super low."
AmItheAsshole,fdihgss,t1_fdifnb4,1578443011.0,"Where does he imply he treated his son with disdain before his son started veering down the wrong path? It sounds like he was more than fair by accepting that his son wanted to do something else in life by giving him a year to figure things out. It's a little telling that all the people in his son's life have given up on him. They probably know more about the situation than we do. Where are you getting anything about OP's parenting styles? His other kids turned out great apparently. He seems to just be stating the facts. Obviously you'd call someone who isn't working or going to school, living with their parents/grandparents and wants to start a family, just not contributing to society in general even though he is able a bum as well."

todayilearned,fdiafdx,t1_fdi9cyx,1578438643.0,"Well, you can't expect him to not help his kids get ahead in life. Most good parents would do everything in their means to help their children succeed. Gordon Ramsay just happens to have more means than the average parent. Good for them.

They won't automatically be millionaires; they're expected to work hard and build their own name, separate from his, to make money. Opportunities are not the same as just getting handed free money. Many people squander opportunities, many others use them to the fullest potential. How many celebrity, political, or business kids have we seen that haven't really done anything in life except coast?"
FinancialCareers,fdi9doe,t1_fdi7umb,1578438085.0,It's okay if your first bout of experience in finance is during your internship. Internships generally don't have experience requirements since most assume you'd just be in college or something.

Now, before someone calls me a boomer, I'm also 20 going on 21 and this kind of laziness is fully unacceptable. In the real world, people don't get handed shit on a silver platter. You have to work for it and OP's son clearly doesn't want to despite being given many chances."
