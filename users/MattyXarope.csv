However, the flyers and the photographs were all just a prank executed by Alan Wagner, an artist and comedian who, along with creative partner Sydney Marquez, “has turned absurdist, real-life memes into an art form. And an actual business.”

Wagner told the New York Post that he staged the disturbing milk-bath pictures inside his Los Angeles garage:

“I really like the image I came up with. This old woman bathing men, and it’s ambiguous what anyone is getting out of it. Nobody seems to be enjoying it, [and] yet they are partaking in it.”

Wagner came up with the bizarre idea when a beverage company asked him to create a meme that would make their drink go viral. He offered up a version of this, but it was rejected because it was too quirky.

So he decided to do it himself.

‘I can’t tell if people are expecting milk or they are reflecting my deadpan humor.’

Surprisingly, fabricating an entire bathroom and hiring actors only cost Wagner about $300. He and Marquez bought the tub from Home Depot, cleaned it after the shoot and returned it when they were done. Friends volunteered to star in the milky nightmare; a few extra models were recruited online and paid $20 each. (One thespian arrived in a sleek suit, unaware he had signed up to sit in a dirty tub of diluted leche. “You could tell how uncomfortable he was in the photo.”)"

The Y740 is per key rgb backlit, theoretically you should be able to access the Actions tab and do the things it allows you to do, but for some reason it is not present on the iCue software on the Y740. 

I've been trying to figure out how to restore it. I've asked different subreddits for someone (with the Actions tab visible) willing to zip their installation folder and upload it, but no one has responded.

todayilearned,fexn9a0,t1_fexmpzs,1579433603.0,"> Science is clarity. Science is specific.

I agree. And that's why human selection is, scientifically speaking, considered a form of genetic engineering (engineering in this sense meaning manipulation) by humans, making many foods such as modern bananas GMOs - regardless of whether they've had their DNA changed in a laboratory setting. 

Within science, human intervention is considered unnatural intervention. It's the same reason why when speaking about global warming science don't consider humans' effect on it to be a natural cause. 

I'm not trying to claim anything else - the definition is quite clear. I'm not sure what you mean by dodgy obfuscation. Science is pro GMO, it's at the forefront of not only selective breeding but amazing new gene manipulation techniques that save millions of lives by giving us healthier, more resistant crops.

[Dr. Norman E. Borlaug](https://www.worldfoodprize.org/en/dr_norman_e_borlaug/about_norman_borlaug/) alone is often cited as having saved countless lives by developing generations of wheat varieties with broad and stable disease resistance, broad adaptation to growing conditions across many degrees of latitude, and with exceedingly high yield potential.

* The food there isn't *good* per se, it's pretty middle of the road. Basically Applebees' quality. They make most of their money on wings on game day. Drinks are a little overpriced too. 

* The wages are good when they're good (Saturday nights and game days), but some days she'd come home making like $20 in tips. Not everyone wants to go to Hooters every night, believe it or not. They still get paid a server's wage which isn't a lot. 

* A lot of the staff was nice, but a lot also had weirdly dark pasts (at least at her restaurant). I remember one of her coworker's dad burned down her house with her and her mom in it, and she was really scarred on her face but with makeup on you would never know it. She was cool too. 

* Almost all servers get regulars who come in just to see them. Some people take it WAY too far too. I remember one of her friends worked with her there and she went to her car one night after her shift was over and she found a sticky note pad FULL of writing under her windshield wiper - stuff like ""I'm gonna make you cum, fuck your little ass, etc..."" We kept that pad after for years and would laugh and read it but it scared her friend at the time and she had to get a cook to walk her out to her car after that. 

* Weirdly enough not as many people actually try to grab the girls as you'd think and my gf's boss - also a former server - would IMMEDIATELY shut those people down and kick them out.
