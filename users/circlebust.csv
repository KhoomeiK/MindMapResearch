There are details here and there to be fixed, but I am more of a big picture person.

By contrast, I care about world events because I like to be well-informed, and have a big interest in geopolitics because of the more realist/analytical take on affairs. 

I am also a proponent of Greater European federalism, which is probably my strongest political conviction (outside human/animal rights), but ironically doesn't apply to where I live barring some genie magic."
space,fdji5m0,t1_fdhliga,1578471889.0,"This assumes a sufficiently thin atmosphere. As Venus shows, that thermal gradient can be completely eliminated in tidally locked (or otherwise slow rotating) planets. We don't exactly know the limits of pressure the human body can withstand -- cursory research suggests 200-300m as minimum (but this assumes the special case of breathing apparatuses rather than a breathable ambient atmosphere), which corresponds to a third the pressure of Venus' atmosphere. This much is almost certainly not too little to produce a largely temperate planet with one hot and one cold thermal pole."

LifeProTips,fdiotjq,t1_fdf4jrz,1578447693.0,"Streamlined and unified (e.g. not a mix of XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 10 panels), more feature-rich (e.g. folders plus thumbnailed content inside openable as tree view), more modern UX than Windows 10 (in KDE. E.g. Kubuntu, Manjaro). Want to split an active window vertically? Just hit F3. Want to switch workspaces on the fly (a new desktop ""environment"", e.g. one for work, one for document editing, and one for video editing)? Just hit Meta(Win)+Tab. 
The command line gets stuff done. You don't have to be a hacker or programmer. Just hit F4, the window gets split horizontally with the CLI, and save yourself dozens of mouse clicks.

Default integration with package managers. Never again hunt down an .exe installer from the web. Just install the app you want from a store, like you do on mobile.

And so on. It's more feature rich than Windows nowadays.

The Libre suite is equal to Office nowadays and free as in beer. FOSS alternatives like Krita or (presumably GIMP also) are downright better than Photoshop nowadays as well."

Thirdly, if something is going down in their life, why not address it? We aren't mind-readers. Not narrate your life story, just say ""I kinda still not over that break up, yknow"".

Mars,fdikjts,t1_fde7v04,1578444963.0,"Mars will be financially dependent on Earth for centuries, barring some Silicon Valley-like tech hub scenario (e.g. with fusion, space propustion,...) emerges which could shorten that to merely a century. Mars has **zero** economic viability minus human brains. I am trying to make a point that hoping Mars will not be a huge money drain, or attract people in search for a ""better"" life (rather than a life as a pioneer that is most likely not better) is a losing proposition.

Luckily there are ideas, ideals and projects grander than human economics, human subsistence or human lifespans, that only a few dare to tread and even fewer have to means to realise. I don't have to preach to the choir here, but **making life multiplanetary** and making human civilisation robust against existential threats are absolutely invaluable investments."

AskProgramming,fdg8t9k,t1_fdfcqn7,1578384916.0,"You have to evaluate every fragment in context. For example, upon encountering the quotes of a kind applicable to your language (otherwise only assign a very low value. e.g. `「` and `」` would score very low in a non-Japanese text), you await a second occurrence of the same kind of quote character within a distance of *n* chars. If one is found, save this finished quote *a*  in memory and evaluate the next fragment as a quote. The increment rate will diminish progressively, as well as the score of this fragment,  if a quote character is not found within *k* characters. Non-occurrence of line breaks, white-space or period marks also greatly decrease its evaluation (as seen in your example with `', I say ""`). If *b* has a low score as a quote but *c* again scores high as a quote, you can assign this slice of context a preliminary evaluation whether the results suggest a case where e.g. *a* is a the first part of a quote, *b* the ""author interjection"", and *c* the rest of the quote. You can do this until your confidence target is met when you can remove the elements of the sub-job from memory -- ideally of course would be over several lines."
