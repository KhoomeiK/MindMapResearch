Commonly referred to as ag-gag laws. 

Secretly-recorded footage regularly shows animals on farms, transport trucks, and in slaughterhouses suffering from horrific and sadistic abuse and neglect. Instead of passing laws to protected farmed animals, the government is attempting to conceal the cruelty, targeting whistleblowers who expose appalling animal suffering.
