LifeProTips,fej3bhx,t1_fei91dz,1579155317.0,"This is the Socratic method for gossip 
> Socrates, the great Greek philosopher, was once stopped by an acquaintance as he passed through the markets.

>“I’ve something important to tell you,” he said. “It’s about your friend.”

>“That’s very kind of you,” Socrates said. “But, don’t tell me just yet. I run all information through the Three Filters Test to ascertain if I want to know it.”

>The man looked somewhat puzzled as Socrates continued, “First is the filter of truth. Whatever you want to tell me, have you seen or witnessed it first-hand?”

>“Umm…I actually heard it from someone,” the man said, “and, it is from a trusted source.”

>“Alright. But that does not pass my first test,” Socrates added, “since you don’t know whether it’s true.”

>“Second is the filter of goodness. Is that a good statement you want to make about my friend?”

>“Not really. That’s the reason I wanted—”

>Socrates interjected, “So, you want to tell me something bad about someone but don’t know if it’s true.”

>“The last is the filter of utility.” He continued, “Your statement about my friend, is that gonna be useful to me?”

>“Not really as such. I just wanted to share”

>“Well, if the information is not necessarily true, it is not good, and, it is of no use,” Socrates concluded, “please, I don’t want to know about it.”

LifeProTips,fej2x8k,t1_fehrkj4,1579154901.0,"As an extrovert who enjoys his me-time, I’ve come to the conclusion that loneliness is a mentality. What do you feel missing from your life? Do you think once you make friends or have a girlfriend you’re gonna stop feeling lonely? Don’t you think people don’t want to be friends with someone with a lonely mentality? If you think this you got the cause and consequence turned around my dude. If you want fun people in your life, you gotta be fun yourself. Replace “fun” for whatever is that you’re looking for.
