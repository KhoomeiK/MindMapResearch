> Socrates, the great Greek philosopher, was once stopped by an acquaintance as he passed through the markets.

>‚ÄúI‚Äôve something important to tell you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about your friend.‚Äù

>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very kind of you,‚Äù Socrates said. ‚ÄúBut, don‚Äôt tell me just yet. I run all information through the Three Filters Test to ascertain if I want to know it.‚Äù

>The man looked somewhat puzzled as Socrates continued, ‚ÄúFirst is the filter of truth. Whatever you want to tell me, have you seen or witnessed it first-hand?‚Äù

>‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶I actually heard it from someone,‚Äù the man said, ‚Äúand, it is from a trusted source.‚Äù

>‚ÄúAlright. But that does not pass my first test,‚Äù Socrates added, ‚Äúsince you don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs true.‚Äù

>‚ÄúSecond is the filter of goodness. Is that a good statement you want to make about my friend?‚Äù

>‚ÄúNot really. That‚Äôs the reason I wanted‚Äî‚Äù

>Socrates interjected, ‚ÄúSo, you want to tell me something bad about someone but don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true.‚Äù

>‚ÄúThe last is the filter of utility.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúYour statement about my friend, is that gonna be useful to me?‚Äù

>‚ÄúNot really as such. I just wanted to share‚Äù

>‚ÄúWell, if the information is not necessarily true, it is not good, and, it is of no use,‚Äù Socrates concluded, ‚Äúplease, I don‚Äôt want to know about it.‚Äù
