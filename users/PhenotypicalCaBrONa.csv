BipolarReddit,fckbhs8,t1_fcjfl10,1577721571.0,It also doesn’t help when you start a bunch of hobbies and leave them all half finished because you’re no longer manic
bipolar,fcjd2cz,t1_fcivx0t,1577683471.0,"That sounds interesting, do let me know when you find it!"
bipolar,fcjcyfj,t1_fchs22i,1577683377.0,Hahaha I like that last suggestion except that she never goes to the doctor or takes meds much so I don’t think it’d work
bipolar,fcihbjp,t1_fci9bge,1577662544.0, I’ve tried to set boundaries but even when they break them they make me apologize for my behavior after I get upset. Even knowing that it’s manipulative I don’t really have a choice. It doesn’t work anymore when they try to make me feel bad for things but in the end there’s nothing I can do.
bipolar,fch2tau,t1_fch1o6v,1577646770.0,"Same!! My mom seems to think her very severe anxiety is actually good for her most of the time, while my dad refuses to admit he’s depressed. They were both diagnosed with PTSD after some stuff happened but they disagree and say it’s ridiculous. They think I should be fine because I have food, housing, and people who love me and that’s all I need to be happy.
God will just fix it all if you pray!"

BipolarReddit,fc6upsr,t1_fc6u7q0,1577489986.0,Exactly! I just start to feel like I’m slowly imploding and I just don’t want to do anything anymore.
BipolarReddit,fc6si3t,t3_egetff,1577488359.0,"This happens to me a lot. My mom constantly tells me “you need to learn how to get over things faster” and that I’m just dramatic for “sulking.” They don’t understand that I can’t really just get over it. My brain just doesn’t let me, it just feels like when one thing makes me really upset I just spiral downwards."
NBASpurs,fc6cpzl,t1_fc5yput,1577477492.0,"My theory is that since a trade with DeMar is coming soon, Pop might not want to show off Lonnie so he doesn’t get dragged into the trade. I have no idea though, my knowledge of this kind of thing is limited."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fbz3ayz,t1_fbz2ruz,1577233794.0,"> If the losses of the Antarctic Peninsula and parts of West Antarctica continue to increase at the same rate they’ve been increasing for the last two decades, the losses will catch up with the long-term gain in East Antarctica in 20 or 30 years -- I don’t think there will be enough snowfall increase to offset these losses.

While yes Antarctica is growing, if things continue the way they are it’s going to get worse. Also, this doesn’t account for the ice caps melting in the arctic which have been the ones that most people refer to since these are geographically closer to the more developed countries. The Arctic isn’t replenishing it’s losses so just because Antarctica is doesn’t mean it’s not still a problem."
