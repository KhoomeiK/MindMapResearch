depression,fey96r2,t3_eqvfig,1579442380.0,"The thing that stop me from killing myself is what if my death cause a bad image to my family and dat makes me depress.

But at the same time i want them to know that because of them  (family and friends) im also like this.

so im hoping that maybe i got into an accident or just die from sleep.

This is visual cycle that i have on a daily basis"

So i kinda hate when my therapy said exercise can help"
depression,fen86kx,t3_epzjky,1579279088.0,"I feel the same way, i work out on a daily basis, i eat healthy, i got a job, its still feel the same way. I move out to a different city expecting that it would help, and yet it doesnt. This is my 3rd job after my master degree not because i got fired, but just because i feel i dont deserve working at my previous place, even with current workplace i feel the same.

I even went to see a psychiatric and psychiatrist weekly for half a year before i move to a different city with a new job. The thing that push me was because it hurt so much. I get panic attack 2-3 times per day while im working and ill just start crying in the office toilet, and put on a mask as if im okay.

Now after i moved i stop going to theraphy, because i dont have the time and i cant go during working hour, because i dont want my colleague to get suspicious. I also stop taking my meds because its making me lethargic.

So here i am confused and constanly questioning on stupid shit, wishing that my time will come soon, the only way i can think of to switch it off."
