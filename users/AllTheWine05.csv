Charlotte,fe714w1,t1_fe69rtw,1578908614.0,I can 3rd for the smoke pit. I work out that way and it's easily some of the best I've had in Charlotte. Midwood smokehouse used to be orgasmic but they haven't been since they started expanding.
Homebrewing,fe2t42l,t3_enmbci,1578842556.0,"I've only made a couple meads, so take this with a grain of salt. I believe the degassing during fermentation rule probably has more to do with oxygenating or stirring the yeast. When I was making my last one gallon batch, I removed the airlock from the drilled cork and used one of those handheld vacuum fresh food bag vacuums to suck out CO2. The CO2 coming out of solution will naturally stir up the yeast back into solution.

Also, as I understand with non-wood-aged wines and meads, aging is for removing CO2 and settling the lees. Settling leaves can happen pretty quickly, especially at low temps but the CO2 bed can take a very long time. If you degass, it can happen much much quicker. I was extremely happy with the product after a month or two and after degassing."

There's a reason why people wear welding masks and it's not because ""they're just pussies"""

woodworking,fdpbw25,t3_eme30m,1578624756.0,"I also hate epoxy rivers, but it's a context problem. Most are coffee tables or dinner tables, and the epoxy river is far too modern and sterile to be homey. This context makes this table look awesome. It's in the right spot with the right furniture (more blue around the table), its super well done, and I really like it. I would love to play some Settlers with you on that."

craftsman113,fdheyby,t1_fdhcaeo,1578421222.0,"Yeah, I greased mine and it's getting worse because of the obvious dirt buildup problem but it does free things up in a hurry.

Iirc the piece (collar, for now) that holds the screw shafts in position at the side of the cabinets is also a hanger/ball joint. If they're not allowed to twist a little with the increasing angle of the screw shaft, I could imagine they may cause what you're seeing. Worth a look.

Otherwise, yeah, taking everything apart will free things up a bit."
IdiotsInCars,fdgseog,t1_fdg8a15,1578407121.0,"That's what I see too. I've met people that have bumped or damaged other cars who clearly have no idea how much money or damage they've caused. I don't get if they don't know the dollar amount or if they just assume that cars are supposed to wear like training shoes and are disposable items that people don't care if there are dings.

craftsman113,fdgbub2,t3_el1ff6,1578389122.0,"As others have states, it's either excessive cakes buildup in the trunion rod or a nut that goes on that rod to do exactly what it's doing now. Take a look under the machine, there should be a ~7/8"" diameter screw rod going from the adjuster wheel on the side to the blade mount assembly. That rod should be cleaned and dry lubricated. There are also collars (one just past the zero on the far side of the rod and I'm guessing one right at the 30 degree mark) that are designed to be positioned to make it quick and easy to hit specific angles. I'm guessing the previous owner used a lot of 30 degree miters for some reason. Anyway, that collar can screw in position and has a hex (Allen key) locking screw to hold it in place.

Once you find all of this, adjustment should be easy."
Homebrewing,fd32n79,t3_ejxhwd,1578154206.0,"Diatomacious Earth might work but would be a consumable for brewing purposes since you won't have a backwashing capability (most likely). There may still be a small amount of silt created, though id imagine that would just settle out.

If you're willing to build or buy filter vessels, why not just use specifically made beer or wine filters? Or, why not just use fining agents? I know everyone has different views on fining and filtering but you can get a crystal clear beer without filtering and filtering can remove hop aromatic."

Homebrewing,fcfacvf,t3_eh3xxx,1577628007.0,"Congrats on your current status.

But no. What makes a Flemmish beer isn't the ingredients but what the bacteria and yeast do. Kettle sours use lactobacillus to produce lactic acid, one specific portion of the vastly more complex sour flavor found in aged sours like Flanders style beers. Much of the rest of the flavors come from pediococcus and brettanomyces and a lot of time.

That's not to say you couldn't make a maltier, more cherry infused version of a Berlinner weisse. It might even be tasty. But it won't be a Flanders. As a pessimist I'd advise against it because those very simple, tangy sour notes don't tend to go well with maltier, toffee, darker flavors and need to be more well rounded to go together. But fuck it, you've got some cherry in there that might help. Just make sure that you use yeast that will attenuate as much sugar as possible. Flemmish styles (and most ""proper"" aged sours) finish out extremely dry since the bacterias can eat sugars that sacc yeast can't. Like, 0.095-1.002 FG. You can't really get that dry with sacc but the closer you get, the better.

Let us know how it turns out if you try it."

Malls are fun for young people.

Malls don't run security like an airport.

Young people are bad because they should spend more time commenting on the ills of society on Reddit instead of being in public socializing.

Night clubs are basically the same as malls but more fun."

IdiotsInCars,fbyc99p,t3_ef1ah6,1577213293.0,"I find it hard to believe that the driver wouldn't notice that the other car was already sliding totally sideways, but I've been a racing and drifting fan for a long time. Also, the perspective makes it hard to see how fast the other car was going backwards into the camera car.

That said, the other driver wasn't going too fast around the corner. If they were, they would go off the road on the outside. My guess is that they have tire problems since virtually all cars, especially old SUV's are designed not to slide like that."
