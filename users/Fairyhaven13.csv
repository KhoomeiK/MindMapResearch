AskReddit,fevzh6s,t3_eqies2,1579403433.0,"I frequently lucid dream, and this was back when I first started. I keep a dream journal, because doing that right after you wake up helps you remember longer and exercising that part of the brain helps you gain more control over your dreams. 

Anyway, I started the dream already lucid. This doesn't happen often. Usually it starts as a bad dream or boring dream, then I become lucid and change it to something better. This time, I was already aware.

I was in a dirty, dark room, dim with reddish light. I thought the light must be coming from some closed blinds behind me, but I didn't turn to see if there was a window. I was alone, but I didn't feel alone. There was a dark, dark, dark hallway branching off the room. I could see nothing in it, but I knew something was coming.

First, I tried to change the dream. Tried to sprout wings, call for a scene change, shout at the dream; all the usual things didn't work. Then, I tried to summon a flashlight, shaking my hand over and over and getting more and more scared as nothing appeared. I knew, I *knew* that if I wasn't allowed to have a flashlight, whatever was coming down that hallway was going to be really bad. This was going to be one of those nightmares where I was too scared to move and unable to fight back as something horrible slowly crept closer.

I desperately tried to wake up. It didn't work. I could feel myself in bed, could feel the layer between the dream and the real world, but couldn't leave the room. Finally, I grabbed my eyelids and forced them open so painfully that they snapped open in real life. I was awake and breathing so hard that I almost passed right back out. That dream hasn't happened again, and I still don't know what I escaped."

She never acts like a leader until her very last line in the game, when suddenly she is Wise and Solemn. She acts exactly the same the rest of the time: angry, sad, overconfident, and begging for attention like her unpleasant background is anything unusual or shocking in this universe. The things your saying are subtle seemed to me like lines shoved in our face to excuse Ava and hide that she never actually changed. I don't remember a single point she ever ""chills out"" and becomes nicer. 

Again, it's only her very last line that implies she isn't a loner anymore. Before that, she is just hyped up for Vault adventures like before, which frankly, I didn't think she should have been a part of. If they really want a good kid-hero story, they should acknowledge her trauma needing to be addressed instead of going, ""kids will be kids"" and bringing her along.

I would like to see a DLC with growth, but preferably not centered on her. It would bore me if it was just about her and her stereotypical coming-of-age story that everyone else already had. I want to not dislike her, but with how she's presented, it's very hard."
borderlands3,fe6gq4g,t1_fe6ea9s,1578890383.0,"Yes, exactly! There's a quote from a movie somewhere--I have been trying to remember the movie for years and haven't figured it out--where someone is yelling that at the big angsty person in their team.

""Aw, you had a hard life? Well, so did the rest of us! We all had a hard life, you're not special! At least we tried to learn from it and make something of ourselves!""

I think that's why I was bored and annoying with Ava. She acts like she should get special treatment for her shenanigans when no one else did, just because she's had a sucky life. Everyone has, and everyone else learned how to work as a team and fight in a war instead of begging for attention and getting other people killed because you refused to listen. 

The blaming others for your problems thing is also annoying, but unfortunately that's also a common thing with the other characters, so I can't blame her as much for that. Even if I did try to smack her upside the head multiple times in-game."

The place I appeared in was a horror game maze. I was terrified, and I knew that one of the dream world mechanics would allow me to pull in someone else to help. However, that would mean they would be trapped with me, continuously ending up in this world when they sleep. I felt horribly guilty for essentially dooming him, but this place was scary and he was the first person I thought of. 

I was running from something, grabbed a door on the side, and it led to a version of Dream-Greed's room--let's call him DG for short. I grabbed his hand and pulled him out of his sleeping body, so that he stood beside himself sleeping in the bed, and explained the situation. As I did, his bedroom faded back into the maze. He wasn't super bothered by the idea of going adventuring in his dreams, and grabbed me by the arm and started dragging me out of the maze. I am short, and he is like two feet taller than me, so he was practically carrying me out by my elbow. 

We made it out eventually to a canyon kind of area, with grassy planes. We properly introduced ourselves and went out separate ways, apparently still set to come back to the dream world in our dreams later.

I later had a dream where me and a team of others, with a leader like the Doctor, were traveling to different places in the dream world and saving people like DND video game heroes. We were the Doctor guy's apprentices, set to make our own guilds eventually. 

Later again, I was on my own, no longer an apprentice. I was looking for a team to work with as I earned money and resources to make a guild. Two guys showed up to the questing spot on horses, saw I was a girl, and demanded to go without me. They said I would hold them back. Then along comes DG, and we're all, ""hey, long time no see!"" And he convinced the other two that I could come if I could keep up. He then proceeded to keep his horse a whole horse-length behind the others, leaving room for my horse so I wouldn't fall behind.

We had a great time. I used an axe as my main and a backhanded hook as my secondary, as I always did when fighting in my dreams, and DG used his claw gauntlets, and we fought back to back. When the other two got caught up on a side objective, we went to sell our junk and walk around a garden of fountains, catching up on lost time. He was funny and and snarky, but didn't act like a cartoon character. He acted like a real guy, with awkward pauses and human quirks. I was so happy.

I had a couple more dreams with him after that. One had us storming a living fortress, which was tired of its current masters, and rescuing a 50 year old elf tween. We turned the fortress into our guild base and adopted the elf. In another, we were conducting a raid to rescue a town from bad guys, and using portals to sneak in our forces. I haven't had one with him in a while. He's practically my imaginary friend at this point. I wonder how he's doing."

HazbinHotel,fdcks9s,t1_fdasb5f,1578277362.0,"Hey, ace buddies! High five! 

I remember doing some research on the asexual and aromantic spectrum when I was researching my own stuff, and aromantics can have some modicum of attraction. Usually only with one person in their life, or not quite romantic and so called a ""squish"" because it's more of a buddy than a crush. I think Alastor would be asexual by nature, but aromantic by lack of thought about it--it simply doesn't occur to him. Perhaps if he became very good friends with someone, they would be a candidate for a ""squish"" or something more on the romantic scale. Maybe that will only ever develop in fanfiction, though."

The law was meant to illustrate how far we are from being perfect, and Jesus said that he would be the perfect sacrifice instead.

Adele is snappy and constantly calculating how to get inside the next tomb, how this old technology was utilized, what booby traps might be next, etc etc. They sometimes annoy the snot out of each other, but won't work with anyone else."

He doesn't understand a world where he isn't as great as he thinks he is, how can he exist in one where he is defeated? And that starts the journey into his redemption arc, because of course Charlie will still be willing to show him what he could be."
