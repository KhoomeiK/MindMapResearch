thewalkingdead,ffas1vd,t1_ffadh5e,1579743159.0,Also it makes the zombies less resistant to rot which is why they are able to wander for years instead of disintegrating in a few months
thewalkingdead,ffarwwt,t3_esjant,1579743066.0,"I’ve often wondered about how they started - because given what we know at some point the dead started rising but something had to happen to trigger that. 11:30am in LA someone dies of a heart attack and stays dead. 11;45am in LA someone is shot, dies and then comes back a few minutes later. So what happened in that 15 minutes?"
wow,ff5ul0r,t1_ff5rft6,1579610778.0,yeah i was surprised as well....
wow,ff5ptsi,t1_ff5nt9w,1579605223.0,Nah not a dragon but not a goblin either. Wowpedia has her as a “shapeshifting astral entity”
insaneparents,ff21sjr,t1_ff1zcfg,1579491492.0,yeah the suit was filed 24 hours after the kid's death yeah? so I bet a lawyer got a hold of them and really pushed hard for them to sue.
insaneparents,felltxh,t1_fel4xvw,1579225255.0,Thanks. Looks a bit retro
insaneparents,fekes6u,t3_epjhbe,1579198534.0,What is it? I have never seen something like that
insaneparents,fekept2,t1_fejzrhb,1579198494.0,That’s an Xbox?
insanepeoplefacebook,fe1xjgs,t3_engmjc,1578832031.0,I don't know what it is but I don't like it!
insaneparents,fdpwzlz,t3_emfza1,1578644027.0,"Wait, was there a reason she didn’t get her baby vaccinated? Like a legitimate reason? Or is she anti-vax?"
insanepeoplefacebook,fde6fmu,t3_ekx245,1578332207.0,Ironically rain might not help that much as it can hinder back burning. Unless it’s torrential rain which lasts for a solid hour then yeah won’t help
insanepeoplefacebook,fde67vq,t3_ekxabw,1578332072.0,Memes are not facts 101
aww,fde5bq1,t1_fdd9hvb,1578331513.0,Definitely a better movie than Prometheus
Idiotswithguns,fcwtzbz,t3_eisvtz,1578037532.0,"Picture aside, it’s a stupid quote as well. One would assume that if ones ass was filled with lead that would have zero impact on their ability to speak. Unless it’s one of those people who constantly talk out of their ass"
aww,fcvocwh,t3_eiyvyy,1578006454.0,His ears sprung up like a bat out of hell!
aww,fctwyhh,t3_eirarc,1577963760.0,That sequence is legitimately better than the entire 3rd movie
aww,fcl3jy6,t3_ehni6t,1577739034.0,Don’t leave it unsupervised..... last thing you want is it robin the place.....

Sovereigncitizen,fcjnkt6,t1_f5ua1mn,1577695361.0,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCjw0ceETpE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCjw0ceETpE) you should watch that - they cop it even worse, especially right at the end"
Sovereigncitizen,fcjn6dw,t1_f4gmysa,1577694809.0,not for the arrest but I have this  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp4YI0ZpOmQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp4YI0ZpOmQ) \- I don't think his name is Craig Value Nova though. I believe it is Matthew A Mellow according to [https://youtu.be/iWfe3iHuOjE?t=376](https://youtu.be/iWfe3iHuOjE?t=376)
IDontWorkHereLady,fcjj9eb,t3_ehep27,1577689758.0,I approve of you dumping the client who gave Karen your address but also feel a bit sorry for them; cause she probably hounded them for days on end til they gave her what she wanted
aww,fch2oth,t3_eh5vu2,1577646737.0,Awwwwww it’s shiny and cute
amibeingdetained,fcgwkd1,t1_fcgvzy3,1577644730.0,Did he ever reply? I’ve seen a few Aussie Sov Cits pop up in video compilations but no idea how widespread it is
amibeingdetained,fcgua8o,t3_eh4dq2,1577644027.0,Wait so is he from Australia or Canada?
amibeingdetained,fcgeqh5,t1_fcg9xdt,1577639238.0,Yep
gameofthrones,fcg83dp,t1_fcg5k2p,1577637431.0,Yeah but she would’ve had to have treated him like that otherwise it would have been suspicious.
amibeingdetained,fcg1dlg,t1_fcfuqvz,1577635589.0,"He either won’t, completely ignore it or cherry pick bits and pieces out of court cases"
amibeingdetained,fcg1662,t1_fcfkblj,1577635524.0,Yep. One idiotic person actually tried to buy a car with said secret bank account after watching a YouTube video and is now in jail
gameofthrones,fcg003i,t1_fcbls9p,1577635240.0,How do we know that he didn’t actually tell her the truth? He could’ve and nothing would’ve changed at all really.
aww,fcbdyi0,t1_fcajklq,1577585689.0,That was my first thought too. That’s just gonna make for a fucked time cleaning that up
jordynjones_18,fc2dd8c,t3_efiaqs,1577353599.0,Santa saw her and came early that year
thewalkingdead,fbzwbxp,t3_ef70e0,1577265121.0,Maybe he does that thing when you wake up and read something completely different to what’s there: Carlalorian
