Nuclear is responsible for 11% of that today. It was probably higher in the past since power use has been going up and most reactors are old, so let's say 12%, so 60,000 TWh., or 60 trillion KWh.

Fukushima killed 2200 -- from the evacuation, by the way.

So I breathed out, and breathed in a full lung-full of nitrous, and held my breath. Unfortunately I didn't think to time it, but sure enough, no need to breathe. I got numb head to toe, giddy, and eventually my vision was going black and I lazily thought, ""Wow, still no need to breathe. But losing consciousness would be bad. I should breathe. Yeah. Definitely should breathe. What? Oh, yeah, breathe, like, now."" And finally I breathed. Never felt bad.

I did the corresponding negative experiment some time later: block of dry ice in a big sink, breathed out, lowered my face into the vapor and breathed in. At least, I tried. My entire body was immediately filled with electric fire, and I didn't manage half a breath before coughing it out uncontrollably. About the sharpest pain I've ever felt.
