It's so upsetting how women's health conditions are written off by doctor's as either ""over exaggeration"" or ""just period pain"" etc, etc. You are definitely not crazy! Be very proud of all you have endured thus far- you are strong! Sorry you had to deal with all of that. I would be fuming too. Wishing you all the best with your recovery! :)"
