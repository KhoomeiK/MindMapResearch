blackfishing,fepqv7p,t1_fep6cto,1579328232.0,"i know i’m gonna get downvoted but honestly, i don’t think you can necessarily claim the ‘hardships’ of being latinax because you are white passing, but i also think that you have the right to explore your own culture and roots without being scared that you’re appropriating someone’s culture (it’s literally your culture as well)

whenever you explain that you are also part of it, i’d probably point out that you are aware that you don’t have the same experience that they have (or didn’t have the same experiences growing up) - as in being discriminated (ONLY if you weren’t, don’t claim shit to make them feel better if it’s not true)- but that doesn’t make you less latinax or ‘disqualifies’ you from your own culture. 

i think people don’t want you to claim it only because, as i said, you tend to be treated differently based on how you look and a lot of people, naturally, tend to get close to those who have similar life experiences and know what it’s like to go through x, y, z. it doesn’t make you less of what you are. live your life, if they don’t understand is because they don’t want to understand"
depression,fenrtvd,t3_epym4o,1579289855.0,"happy birthday! as someone who is also born in january (on the 18th, so we're very close in bdays) i can attest that people tend to be more forgetful, at least imo, mostly because they like to live through christmas and the holidays but then january hits them with a harsh reality, so i wouldn't take it personally

i wish you a great birthday and may you never feel hurt by other people's actions, as they don't represent you, but them!"

LifeAdvice,fd8gwan,t3_ekaitd,1578218230.0,"first of all, i am so sorry you've gone through this. even if the events with your brother didn't happen, the way your parents reacted is way out of line, which kinda inclines me to believe that they know and were aware of what happened to you but choose to deny it, either to save your brother or themselves. 

is there any possibility of you talking to a professional? they should be able to determine whether or not these are false memories. if they are not, the professional should be able to attest that you're not a compulsive liar or a sociopath so your parents can't just force the psych ward onto you.

if you solve that part out, unfortunately i can't say what to do regarding your brother. you should contact the police non emergency line and seek some advice regarding what legal route you can take. i wish you the best"

relationship_advice,fcn0te2,t1_fckey8u,1577799957.0,"i kinda have a similar story. i got bullied for being half middle eastern in a white country by, wait for it... other minorities (just different ones). 

i’ve always been the more aggressive type, especially in middle school so i promised to myself that i’d be calmer and not aggressive in hs, which ended up overlapping with me getting the most bullied i’ve ever been in my life. it was both mentally and physically and i never did anything just because i didn’t want to break the promise i did to myself and fall down the aggressive route again. 

i kinda regret it honestly, i am paranoid (which was meant to be, as my father had paranoia) it just got worse and now i can’t be touched or surprised or i’ll get scared and flinch. one of my ex bfs randomly touched my back and i flinched and almost broke down. i don’t think those who never got bullied truly understand how bad it can be and how much it can affect you later on.

as a former bullied person, i think you did great op, both for encouraging him to stick up for himself and not punishing him for it"

relationship_advice,fcjwgev,t1_fcjifz5,1577708039.0,"is there a reason why you can’t get a job for yourself and offer yourself financial stability? 


there are jobs in most places. yes, they’re probably shit and you’ll probably struggle and you won’t like it  but that’s what most adults have to go through until they find something stable and something they like and i really think you deserve better. who cares if he’s from a rich and educated family and you aren’t? i’m also not from a well off family (or an educated one) but i still managed to get a pretty well paid job (enough to help me get around), it’s a struggle, but having your own money feels great. i hope you’ll really consider getting a job, saving up and then moving on with your life

depression,fc99pnv,t1_fc8zghs,1577549314.0,"someone telling her that she has things to live for and she responding to ‘fuck off’ shows that she’s a cunt

let’s all stop enabling toxic people just because they have a mental/health issue. most of us here and in a darker place than the ‘rest’ but imagine if we all came here and started insulting one another because why not? we’re all depressed, aren’t we? i’m sorry but it’s bs and even if you have a mental health issue you still have to work on yourself and be a good person


having depression/anxiety/etc doesn’t mean you can be a cunt, trust me as someone who had to work hard to stop being mean and aggressive. you can have problems and still improve as a person. toxic behaviour is toxic and should be called out, whatever they do after they get called out is on them. the same thing goes for the consequences they have to face after they respond to the said call out"
depression,fc971xh,t1_fc90npj,1577548059.0,"hate to be that person, but why don’t you try and retake them? i’ve been dealing with depression since i was in the 7th grade, so i know how it’s like to have to take two different set of exams while being depressed but it’s still doable, especially if you’re from a poor family and don’t have a choice
i’m still not where i want to be, but when you’re depressed you have to help yourself a lot, not even therapy alone or the help of your family can help if you’re not helping yourself
sorry if this was too harsh"
depression,fc2zktt,t1_fc2xug1,1577378069.0,"just because someone else is better than you that doesn’t mean you don’t matter. suicide doesn’t only affect you, but those around you as well, because newsflash, people tend to care more about you than they realise/show. friends drift apart, maybe you haven’t talked to your family in a while, but your death would still affect them

as a quote said ‘suicide doesn’t end the sadness, it just passes it to someone else’. i tend to be selfish and self-centred at times but i still manage to see how much death can affect those around you and i’m kinda sick of people pulling the ‘but i’m not important because i’m not einstein or bill gates’ like get a fucking grip, most of us aren’t special, out of the ordinary or don’t have great genetics, so? that’s life. it’s unfair, it’s cruel and it’s harsh but you just have to move on and keep going, why? because it’s not only about ourselves here, the fucking guy who serves your coffee can be affected by your death. we have so much power that we are not using. you can literally adopt a stray cat/dog/whatever and change his whole life for the better. just because it’s not a huge achievement that doesn’t mean it’s not an achievement or that it doesn’t matter

i’m not trying to make it seems like those who commit suicide are selfish, because i’ve been there and i know how much it can fucking hurt, as well as being in a bad situation from a young age, but we really need to stop saying that we don’t matter just because we’re ordinary people. this is coming from someone who doesn’t have great genetics, a lot of friends and is average at best.

it was clear to me that you should have never gotten the second birds in the first place, as birds and pets are loud in general and you knew how your wife is. she is stepping over you but you’re also not helping the situation at all. 

i’m sorry for being such a bitch but pets are not for a year or two. i wouldn’t get a pet, she said that your kid will hate you if you don’t allow pets, but the kid will resent you both more if you got them a pet then got rid of them within a couple of years just because they became too annoying or too loud. good luck with your kid"
