""The nutrient rich waters of the Gulf are fed primarily by the cold, deep Labrador Current that enters the along the Scotian Shelf and Northeast Channel to the south of Nova Scotia (figure 2). This current helps drive the primarily counterclockwise circulation of the Gulf, feeding the Eastern Maine Coastal Current (EMCC) off Maineâ€™s east coast and the Western Maine Coastal Current (WMCC) off the coasts of western Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts (figure 3). These currents are influenced by fluctuations in river outflow, often enhanced during spring runoff. Water exits the Gulf primarily through the Great South Channel, between Cape Cod and Georges Bank, approximately three months after entering."""
