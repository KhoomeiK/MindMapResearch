This is cartridge stuff is just as stupid as reram thing would sony divert money for useless stuff or use it for better cooling, apu, memory or even storage. Edit: One more thing, companies make money from storage, ram, cpus etc. at enterprise sector not consumers, so selling ssd for people just to use like cartridge for low margins is stupid."

I just checked some benchmarks and 1060 get same fps at 1080p what RTX 2080 Super outputs at 4k. This generation will give smallest jump in graphics compared to previous gens just because they are blowing all that performance just to render 4 times more pixels. If Sony and Microsoft targeted 1080p we would get 5 to 9 times jump in performance even ignoring benefits from better architecture, that's why they are focusing on CPU performance and SSD and that's fine I won't need to buy 600 euros GPU just so I could match consoles games running at 4k, 1080p is good enough for me."

I have argued with him relentlessly and arguments don't work, he will just ask another question after question, which I have no answer because I don't have medical, physics or chemistry knowledge to that level or he just lacks understanding of basic principles. For example never ending argument with him, why you can't see stars in pictures taken on the moon surface, because sun is too bright compared to faint stars and exposure needs to be adjusted otherwise picture would end up overexposed and completely white, same reason why we can't see stars (sans the Sun) at midday. But he will just ask another question or say some stupid argument, it will continue without end. Sadly you can't teach people like that, I think , there is documentary on netflix about flat earthers where they were trying to prove that earth is flat performing experiments, those experiments showed the opposite result and that was not enough.
