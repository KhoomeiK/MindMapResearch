AskReddit,fefd3ya,t3_eovelt,1579053731.0,Lots of self reflection. Allowing yourself to grieve and stay present in the pain. Numbing it with another person before you are ready or with mind altering substances only holds the pain at bay for so long. Eventually it will come back to you with interest.

AskReddit,fdl5gn4,t1_fdl0m1f,1578517371.0,"its not always horrible. I found a great therapist who guided me through a lot of it. I learned that there really wasn't much wrong with me, not to the extent that my ex and her boyfriend portrayed me as being. Cheating says nothing about the betrayed but everything about the cheater themselves. 

rebuilding your life after such a devastating blow to finances, ego, happiness, etc, takes a very long time. essentially you are starting with a crater in the ground. 

its a delicate dance sometimes to avoid things that will potentially drop kick you into the dark void that is depression and dark thoughts. so you do what you can. it may seem silly to some, outright madness to others, but at the end of the day if it keeps you on your feet and out of the depression pit its worth it.

10+ years is a long time, and the fact i am still grieving in a way is proof it meant something to me. Society expects people to ""just get over it"" and ""move on"". We do not allow ourselves or others to grieve properly."
