Fun fact, female tarantulas can live some 30+ years. Males are very lucky to make it to 6.

I mean, check out this photo of *Trichonephila clavipes*, the golden silk orb weaver. That tiny dude is the male (and those big ""boxing gloves"" in front of his face are his sexual organs!). The sexual dimorphism is incredible. https://bugguide.net/node/view/1698943/bgimage

Another fun fact. In *Tidarren sisyphoides*, the males are practically microscopic at 1% of the size of the female. It's thought that when it comes to mating, he's barely large enough to even be noticed by the female. He also dies after mating with her, but not for the reason you think (she doesn't eat him. Instead, he cuts off his own ""dick"", dies, and stays attached to her for 2+ hours. Who says romance is dead?).

Even the notoriously conservative NRA [acknowledges this](https://www.nrafamily.org/articles/2019/1/15/are-women-better-shooters-than-men/).

I keep all this stuff in my backpack so when I do travel, it's all there. Doesn't take up too much space.

For anyone interested in doing exactly this, search for ""discovery flights"" in your area. They're generally about $100 and super fun. A pilot will give you some basic instructions, take you up in the air, and you can fly a whole ass plane around in the sky for a bit before they land the plane for you. Typically takes about an hour.

AskReddit,fejoxrq,t3_epduqa,1579182029.0,"Making a basic music track in a digital audio workstation (note I said basic, not good!).

DAWs generally look crazy intimidating but sit down for an hour, lay down some chords and drums, and bam, you have a song brewing. 

Making it sound GOOD takes a lot of time and effort, but making something that sounds okay and passable as music is actually pretty damn easy, especially with modern software these days. Having a music theory background certainly helps, but honestly, if you listen to music with any regularity, you'll already have some sort of ear for what sounds good and what doesn't. 

You don't even need an external MIDI controller; most if not all modern DAWs allow for a virtual controller that just uses your keyboard. It's not the most elegant, but it gets the job done.

So what's stopping you? Get those musical doodles finally out of your head! YouTube has tons of info on how to use the software, free plugins, samples, etc. Free DAWs exist, you literally can start with just a basic computer, or even your phone. If you have a Mac or an iPhone, GarageBand is free and quite capable. The iOS GarageBand is actually pretty impressive and super fun to mess with. 

(Disclaimer/reminder that I'm not saying making GOOD music is easy - it's not! But simply making music, even if it's wonky, isn't too difficult with modern software. Starting may be the hardest part psychologically, but it's truly mostly psychological. Just do it!)"
