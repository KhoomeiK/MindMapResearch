Yes, you do it for strangers,  you do it for frens, 

you do it for our pets, who we love to no end.

You do make us happy and we do enjoy,

and through you we give extra squeezes,

to our good girls and boys.

We know it's not karma nor is it the gold,

that that drives you to share the joy you unfold. 

It's for the love of our pets that you share your kind words, 

for our puppers and kitties and even our birbs.

So thank you dear Schnoodle, for your special verse, 

that allows us to revel in love and not dwell in the worse.

You heart is so big and you're so willing to share,

you should know, about you, we do very much care."
