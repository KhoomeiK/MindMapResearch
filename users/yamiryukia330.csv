Queer_Amateur_Radio,fectd14,t3_ejc0zx,1578983845.0,Yes there are many of us. Some will even be at Quartzfest this coming week if we aren't in the area to get the set up done. Some of us aren't the most active online.
AmateurFoodPorn,fe0jyk6,t1_fdrelxz,1578814687.0,Your welcome.
cats,fdtxvml,t3_en1653,1578724019.0,Aww congratulations and that's super sweet
DuggarsSnark,fdq517u,t3_ello1t,1578655150.0,Would not suprise me at all if they are related. Peterson brings disgrace to my state. Fucker is just as shitty as the so called sheriff arpaio in the same section of the state.
assholetax,fdq1yi9,t3_emi2nc,1578650878.0,That makes total sense. May we have a picture of the getup for driving away prospective buyer's?
AmateurFoodPorn,fdpzqmb,t3_emghns,1578647716.0,this looks absolutely delicious and i would happily munch it all down. gorgeous presentation and wonderful fresh ingredients
shittyfoodporn,fdpyunq,t1_fdpq5cj,1578646497.0,indeed it does. even better when you add pepperoni or other crispy salty protein for addtional flavor punch. can't say i'm fond of ham on it.
BlueCollarWomen,fdpyda5,t3_emmim6,1578645848.0,no shame in washing off the week and having some relaxing  time. enjoy it

shittyfoodporn,fdp061d,t1_fdowj44,1578616874.0,That's a reasonable question. Cilantro certainly tastes really disgusting to me.
shittyfoodporn,fdoswes,t1_fdn5gci,1578612139.0,Yes sounds awesome. I'd make smaller pieces of chicken to spread it further though
shittyfoodporn,fdostx2,t1_fdo3cxy,1578612096.0,Pineapple is the best pizza topping making it an awesome pizza
curlyhair,fdokruc,t3_em9suo,1578607135.0,Gorgeous overall hair skin and make up. Your dragon is super cute too.
antiMLM,fdojwnp,t1_fdnvk1l,1578606637.0,Agreed. They could have used a better term for the antivax but the meaning is clear
insanepeoplefacebook,fdmfl1x,t3_elv4sz,1578548252.0,Unlucky to have had it before the vaccine was widespread
SkincareAddiction,fdjlucr,t1_fdihmut,1578477091.0,Yes it's why I've gotten more vigilant about it these days. Don't need skin cancer
FridgeDetective,fdhwaep,t3_el9ots,1578431308.0,someone with an eating disorder or they fast a whole lot. you enjoy face masks and tea as well as apples too.
shittyfoodporn,fdhn52b,t3_el36pf,1578426173.0,Delicious nostalgia. No shame In making a version of something you enjoy. Though you can easily use naan or such and make your own ones for cheaper
childfree,fdhj5uc,t3_el9t41,1578423759.0,Yay not being restricted for what you do. Congratulations and enjoy

FridgeDetective,fdeyzrm,t3_ekv62v,1578349608.0,you love your alcohol and some flavored water and soda. you don't cook terribly much. you love condiments so probably lots of takeout and sandwiches often. possibly have roommates and no one enjoys cooking in the household but all enjoy alcohol a lot.

FundieSnark,fd87vu3,t3_ek7f9i,1578214955.0,Plastic cactus with Carolina reaper infused oil for his ass. Make him feel the hate he inflicts on others. Disgusted by his shit. Gives my state a worse reputation
FundieSnark,fd87cly,t3_ek555b,1578214737.0,Utter bullcrap. I detest that this waste of oxygen lives in the same state as me. I can't wait to see how many more places ban his b.s..
FundieSnark,fd816bl,t1_fd5xoyg,1578212763.0,Shittier still is his hateful shit has been to my city. Cringey as hell and I hope they never come back

ABraThatFits,fd46u6n,t1_fd1szpt,1578164931.0,One day it would be awesome. It was a reason I'm kinda glad I put muscle on in the rib area because 30bands are slightly easier to find then 28 bands. Even if the rest of it's just as big a pain as ever. Just bad timing since i know I've jumped cups and so I'm just glad I have a couple super stretchy 28s that I'm wearing till they die and then later this year I'll watch and jump if any boutiques have something that fits even if I have to sister a bit so long as the price is right. Really hoping I get an email from my closest one in April since that'd be perfect timing.
DuggarsSnark,fd1m8k5,t3_ejs3kl,1578133263.0,The ratios are way off but that is the correct set of ingredients. Though it's closer to 1 to 1 ratio for garlic to butter  along with typically about 1 to 2 cups  of cream but she needs to at least double the amount of cheese for it to be the right consistency.  Needs to double the quantity of pepper too at a minimum.
FundieSnark,fd17e2k,t1_fd06ki3,1578128290.0,The Anderson's with zsu and the kids are scary at because they are only a 2 to 3ish hour drive away depending on traffic. Flipping right in the state governments backyard sadly.

fuckeatingdisorders,fd07pv8,t3_ejhxep,1578114879.0,It sounds like she may have an eating disorder or something severely off herself. Tell her how hurtful it is and if she tries it again cut her the fuck off
CharcuterieBoard,fd07ds4,t3_ejq4kb,1578114738.0,Looks delicious
amateurradio,fd07aln,t3_ejklo4,1578114703.0,Happy to hear they are getting passed along.
ABraThatFits,fd06vq3,t3_ejfqmk,1578114527.0,Oh where are the smaller bands and bigger cups hiding. 28 bands are even worse to locate. I hope to see 30 bands at a minimum become easier to find in larger cups
MealPrepSunday,fd00ipd,t1_fczeuhy,1578111792.0,Smaller person/less activity/ can be snacks instead of a full meal depending on how much is packed.
cats,fczq1u2,t3_ejgjhw,1578106602.0,Such cute cattiude. Glad your dad thought to call your attention to it.
twoway_radioporn,fczij6d,t1_fcwxmgm,1578102002.0,The thumbs up is appreciated. I have yet to upload pictures of the mobile setups for the vehicles. She loves her radios and we use them often. Just glad we managed to solve the RF interference we had by moving the antenna. Much rather move then have to buy a new monitor.

entitledparents,fctfbis,t3_eiltzq,1577941441.0,Our vehicles have disabled plates due to my wife's disability. Unless she is with me I always search a further away spot because I can walk and have no need for the space. If there is a non handicapped spot close to the door i will take it though. Thank you for not giving into the Karen.

DuggarsSnark,fcmk4td,t1_fcirogp,1577778569.0,Thanks. I remember being scared shitless and guarding my birth control of any method prior to getting my implant. Though I keep it cus there are hateful people who feel violence is acceptable and I'd rather not risk if abortion is outlawed. Plus it keeps the shitty gyno issues I inherited from the egg donor at a more manageable level of no bleeding for a couple years so long as I can manage my stress from getting too terrible
dietsoda,fcm93l1,t3_ehn1x5,1577767546.0,that shit is the best for tastiness and caffination
amateurradio,fcm7tuh,t3_ehnefq,1577766519.0,i do the same thing. worked at all call center and it happened all the time but i figure it's just our brains gotta hear it before it makes sense. tis why i keep the call sign written down and a scratch pad to write whomever talking with's on too.
1200isplenty,fcm7i8w,t1_fckkyih,1577766264.0,yes gotta do the Penzey's spices. nothing better
FundieSnark,fcj65os,t1_fc6xs47,1577678230.0,i love jack monroe's recipes. she's awesome and her books are gorgeous and very good. she's also pretty good at giving notes for if you need to adapt for dietary restrictions too.
FundieSnark,fcj5u2n,t3_egi2rq,1577677998.0,if the tooth brush is all she got then it's fucked up as all get out. if it was along with some candy and a book or coloring book and crayons then it's not terrible. i remember as a younger one we used to have tooth brush as a traditional part of the stocking.  though as i've gotten older i'm just happy as all get out if i find a pack of my brush heads or my preferred tooth paste under the tree due to being fairly young and inheriting shitty teeth because the hundred dollar tooth brush is cheaper then having to go for dental work all the time.
DuggarsSnark,fchuwgd,t3_eh1lxt,1577654432.0,at a minimum covert incest. i don't necessarily dare to speculate otherwise but it's definitely a strong possibility.
DuggarsSnark,fchulk4,t1_fc9si7g,1577654323.0,agreed. i'm happy for birth control because otherwise i'd have kids that were entirely unwanted. i'm happy to live where i can access it. team no kids by choice cus i raised my baby sister already. fuck anyone who uses their daughters as mothers  because their too lazy to raise their own children.
childfree,fchneu8,t3_egqa87,1577652022.0,this is unacceptable. if you have the money i'd consider changing the  lock and seeing if there's a system to just have a code not a physical key so if something happens you could swap the code if she has to be over. she's fucked up for doing this.
childfree,fchl970,t3_eh1t7a,1577651531.0,agreed. never wanted to have them though it took time to research and realize i wasn't alone in not wanting kids. i always had been telling ex's wanted to wait till stable and then we'd see about it. things were never stable and now thankfully i have a partner who doesn't want them. though we may have grandkids come out of the woodwork if they reject their mother's stupid religion.
childfree,fchjwba,t1_fcbn7dt,1577651182.0,agreed eagerly awaiting the cat tax
childfree,fchjt4t,t3_egzdpx,1577651155.0,"i much approve onesies on small animals instead of babies. though when i know of babies arriving they tend to be my default gift to when anyone i know is expecting because basic onesies are relatively inexpensive, easy to clean, easy to use and can be passed along or reused if they intend to have more children."
childfree,fchj368,t3_eh1bnu,1577650924.0,i've got a number of hereditary conditions and some just fucked up genetics so i refuse to pass them on to others and risk them having the same pain i deal with. it would be extremely cruel for me to knowingly risk someone else dealing with it. on the extremely off chance i changed my mind that is what adoption is for because that way i know the genetic bullshit i have ends with me. i wouldn't wish this onto another person if i had a choice and finding all the hidden health stuff within family is not changing my mind on it at all.

specialaww,fc64b6u,t3_eg0fkq,1577471957.0,So sweet. I bet he's going nuts happily on the crinkley paper
DuggarsSnark,fc5763h,t3_eg0r5a,1577446694.0,Girl is depressed. But that's when you throw it up in a bun or use dry shampoo. She's probably hormonal mess with the still birth and them throwing the imagery everywhere plus seeing all the babies is probably causing brutal depression. She needs a secular counselor or therapist stat to help. Maybe this sends her into spilling tea sometime?
raisedbynarcissists,fc54fk3,t3_eg8f7i,1577442620.0,Yes picked for as long as I have memory. Probably further back. Stress response and makes things worse.
raisedbynarcissists,fc5417u,t3_eg4c11,1577442024.0,Rough time lines of what I hear. See pictures can jog some. A lot of it isn't there or is patchy. The longer I spend away bits start to appear and I realize how fucked up things really were.
EntitledBitch,fc4q53d,t3_efzhkz,1577424410.0,I'd be happy to have gotten anything. I enjoy receiving but just happy for anything. Enjoy planning and hunting things for others with their interests for gifts for them. Still legitimately happy with socks though underwear is a little iffy unless they have me help choose it to ensure the right sizing for it.

childfree,fc280n1,t3_ef9cjr,1577344756.0,My condolences on your loss and I hope you can help the rest of the family out. This is exactly part of my reasoning for not having children.
childfree,fc27fdd,t3_efqbhh,1577343894.0,There is no shame in kawaii culture. I have a known adoration for Hello Kitty and other things. I much enjoy not having to hide the things from children and I'm not ashamed of it. Who cares if the characters are a little childish looking so long as you enjoy it.

childfree,fbyl9vw,t3_ef1yi2,1577219784.0,My father knows he has a grand dog and she gets a stocking filled every Christmas too. When we had cats they got their stockings too even as a kid.  Just glad my dad understands that I ain't gonna risk passing my crappy genetics on and I'm content to play auntie. Mom and extended relatives are very disappointed but the cycle of abuse stops with me.

amateurradio,fbxbrs5,t3_eeqen3,1577178931.0,I'm a younger person in the local clubs. Yes it can skew older but the important part is the shared interest in amateur radio. You can help bring others your age or younger in too.
SkincareAddiction,fbvityb,t1_fbqijob,1577131424.0,Oh I need to check the tube I have and hope it's pure Zinc then. Baby not necessary for diaper cream to be useful.
