todayilearned,ferx0uv,t1_fervp77,1579359209.0,"Lol the people definitely DO talk to strangers. As a group the Finns are less into small talk and whatnot than Western Europeans, but like just about anybody else, if you show that you‚Äôre respectful and aren‚Äôt just blabbering on to blabber on, they‚Äôre friendly people."
todayilearned,ferw1v6,t1_ferrukc,1579358970.0,Estonian is weirder than Finnish if you ask me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
todayilearned,fervvtp,t1_ferszel,1579358910.0,"For clarification, I use ‚Äúmost‚Äù and ‚Äúsouthern‚Äù a bit too loosely here; I was thinking of folks up in the Lapland that are more likely to not have learned English. A fellow one of my traveling buddies in Finland encountered mentioned that you‚Äôre hardly considered a real Finn if you don‚Äôt speak English (take that as you will)."
todayilearned,feruwbz,t1_ferpjb7,1579358587.0,"You‚Äôre correct on that- I did some study of linguistics in college. I tend to think more of orthography, pronunciation, and syllable emphasis, all of which are right on par with something like German. In my opinion, learning Finnish for an English speaker would be closer to learning something like Mandarin or Arabic (which as you know are not remotely related to Romance or Germanic languages and boast different alphabets or tonal patterns). Can some words in Finnish get ridiculously long? Yeah, but it‚Äôs the same way in languages like German or Icelandic as well. And Finnish afaik doesn‚Äôt involve some of the voiceless or creaky-voices phonemes that some languages like Hindi have."
todayilearned,ferpyg3,t1_ferodnl,1579357017.0,"This is true. However, just based on how I tend to understand languages, Finnish has a one-to-one orthography (each written letter has one pronounced sound, unlike English), and outside of borrowed words has a very predictable pattern of accented syllables (first syllable, then secondary emphasis on every other syllable after that), making it easier to parse words apart. So yes, while the lack of clues to language structure thanks to its lack of linguistic ‚Äúsiblings‚Äù makes things difficult, it‚Äôs (to me) still about the same level of gibberish as other difficult-to-learn languages, if that makes any sense."

todayilearned,feritta,t1_ferh17j,1579354441.0,"Plus most Finns in the southern regions will also speak English, sometimes Russian (which is obviously also not exactly appreciated). But chances are you‚Äôll be able to communicate with no problem."
todayilearned,ferijw6,t1_feracvn,1579354323.0,"Suicide rate is around that of the US, the people are actually quite friendly if you‚Äôre not being an ass, the language is no more gibberish than German, alcoholism isn‚Äôt an exclusive problem, and it‚Äôs cheaper in restaurants than tap water. Where the heck did YOU visit?? Because it sure wasn‚Äôt the same spots where I was."

antiMLM,fe2lima,t1_fe2eci4,1578839985.0,"Right, so, I‚Äôm allergic to mosquito bites. They‚Äôre not small slightly-itchy bumps on me. They swell up and spend a few days feeling like they‚Äôre on fire if I‚Äôm not bathing in baking soda paste or rolling deodorant on the bites to calm the reaction. It‚Äôs a thing."
antiMLM,fe2ladh,t3_ennkcv,1578839850.0,"The correct answer is smoke or DEET. Anything else is lacking. 

On the bites, deodorant (not antiperspirant) or a paste made with baking soda and water.

AskReddit,fdjxldv,t1_fdj74k9,1578490696.0,"Same here. My folks acknowledged where boundaries were while I was homeschooled, and I still had a job and was doing outside activities almost every evening of the week. I also grew up at a megachurch, so between it, my job, and my taekwondo classes, I had plenty of friends and diversity of experiences. I was able to go on trips with my friends and stay out late, so long as I texted my folks where I was. Come to think of it, they were awfully trusting."

Eyebleach,fcqg4v8,t1_fcpytu3,1577885373.0,"Sometimes. You get the flat-faced dogs that swallow a lot of air anyway (bulldogs, Boston terriers, pugs, sometimes ones like Brussels griffons), but they can swallow even more when they eat fast, so they‚Äôre pretty susceptible to bloat. My parents have a Boston that used to eat so fast she‚Äôd promptly barf it all up ten minutes later; they stuck a tennis ball into her bowl to force her to slow down and the stomach problems eased up. 

So yeah, occasional smaller breeds can have bloat issues, but the biggest issues are far and away are dogs with narrow skinny waists like Dobermans and Great Danes, especially if they only eat one large meal a day."
