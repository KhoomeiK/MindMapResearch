TooAfraidToAsk,ff41t1s,t3_erc31s,1579553689.0,"Have a gay friend on the discord. Talked about thinking about wearing gay pride colors to church one day. 

I'm like, why do want other people to know so badly that you are gay. Just live your life without needing acceptance from other random people. But the whole pride thing tells them they should be blatant about being gay from what they wear to lisping so that everyone can tell. It becomes their identity."

-Edit- Just to be clear here im not saying what was said was ok, im explaining why and how its not really surprising to see toxic gamers say that. Dont shoot the messenger."

Not only did you see a sephiroth in every game but typing out there name if it was like above was a hassle if you needed to PM them. 

Also I wouldnt call simply saying ""pwnd"" as having fun. And if you think I'm wrong 1v1 me rust. My username is xXx420SephirothCloud69xXx and I will PwNz0R u with my sK177s n00b."
