So what?  He knows his shit.  I'm sure there are lots of other people that know their shit when it comes to coffee, too.  

You disagree with some of his methods and still do your own thing.  That's cool.  You do you.

Are people telling you that you're wrong for not doing it his way or something?"

intermittentfasting,fcz72e9,t1_fcxm2ak,1578094983.0,">  Let me tell you, that alone was difficult. I’m not one for coffee, but I got through it.

Try this with coffee:  Turn it into a hobby.  You'll find out that black coffee can taste amazing and nothing like you're used to...when you do it right.

It's an important component of IF if you're used to sugary drinks or sugary coffee to get you going in the mornings.  So...learn to do pour-overs!!  Get yourself a [Chemex](https://smile.amazon.com/Chemex-Classic-Pour-over-Glass-Coffeemaker/dp/B0000YWF5E/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=chemex&qid=1578094492&sr=8-4) or a [Bodum](https://smile.amazon.com/Bodum-Coffee-Maker-Permanent-Filter/dp/B01JLY1HSE/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=chemex&qid=1578094579&sr=8-6) pourover maker and make your own.  Grab a [small kitchen scale](https://smile.amazon.com/Ozeri-Digital-Multifunction-Kitchen-Elegant/dp/B004101GQC/ref=sxin_5_osp17-0c18f98b_cov?ascsubtag=0c18f98b-ee0e-4260-86be-43e4ec033951&creativeASIN=B004101GQC&cv_ct_cx=small+kitchen+scale&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osp.0c18f98b-ee0e-4260-86be-43e4ec033951&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_wn=osp-search&keywords=small+kitchen+scale&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B004101GQC&pd_rd_r=30f3633d-4c7a-4226-b6b0-7bd06aca7838&pd_rd_w=69YPK&pd_rd_wg=av0Nc&pf_rd_p=e1262d27-368d-44f1-a337-220e1af8b014&pf_rd_r=T3PQSDNQKFA0PFX46JZ8&qid=1578094640&tag=digitaltren0b-20) and weigh your grounds, then make your pourovers in the morning.  It's not time-consuming and the results are far and away better than cheap Folgers or Keurig.   Plus it's a cool hobby, learning to experiment with different ratios and water temperatures.  The result is some really good coffee which can really help you with IF.

PM me if you decide to go this route and I'll give you some advice on ratios, water temperature, equipment, etc."
intermittentfasting,fcz5zj2,t1_fcy0ds3,1578094358.0,"> I’m doing okay with 23:1 right now

I'm glad you're doing well with it, but don't be afraid to dial it back to 20:4 or even 16:8 if you feel yourself starting to slip or it becomes too difficult.  That was the best advice I got when I started...don't go too hard too fast.  Launching right into OMAD isn't usually advised and can be *extremely* difficult to maintain.
