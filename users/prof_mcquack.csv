Sorry for the misleading headline in the link, but basically there were a few nazis who wanted to go but their moms wouldn’t let them (by which I mean the FBI arrested them before they could go). 

I guess I just assumed a few others attended, but it looks like that’s not the case."

Edit: the shape of the jaws (pointy, curved, no apparent serrations) makes me think crabronid."

whatsthisbug,fe9324h,t1_fe85l6e,1578933697.0,The stingers are retractable so you can’t really see them when the wasps are just hanging around. All you can really do is keep your windows sealed and if you have a garage or basement try to keep it spider-free. Simply taking any adults you find outside will probably do the trick. They’re not attracted to anything in your home unless you run a spider farm or something.

If you find another one, could you take a picture? If you’re having trouble getting it to stay still but you can catch it in a jar or something, pop it in the fridge/freezer for 5-10 min to make it stay still for a photo shoot. A shot of it from the side would be especially helpful.

whatsthisbug,fe83doc,t3_ent1lv,1578922046.0,"Definitely ants. Based on color and their ridiculous choice for a nest location I want to say Tawny Crazy Ant, but they’ve only invaded Texas and Florida so far. However, all it takes is a single mated female to start a new colony, so one could have hitched a ride to your house on a piece of fruit or potted plant.

whatsthisbug,fe827l9,t3_eo3hw1,1578921617.0,"It’s a spider wasp (family Pompilidae). There are lots of all-black species so it’s hard to say for sure, but my best guess is Aporus niger. That species might not be native to Texas though."
