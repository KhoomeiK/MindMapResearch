Kids can also pack on a bit of weight right before a growth spurt. So long as she's physically active and has no underlying health issues it's nothing to be concerned about."

cats,fdfwa7l,t3_ekym3c,1578371930.0,"That baby is small enough you can train her into to curling up on you instead. One of mine, Amigo, used to try to lay on my phone or knock it out of my hands because he wanted attention. Wear a scarf, pat your chest when you lay, and put the baby there. Eventually the sound of you patting your chest will signify hands free cuddle time. Now any time I sit with my knees up and reclined against my headboard he comes over and starts purring like a little motor."

cats,fcylrth,t1_fciwsce,1578082359.0,"As a kid I always wanted a big fat dark cat named Meatball, when Mama gave birth and one of them was a big long hair I was like ""That's him, that's my Meatball."" My sister jokingly calls him Meatloaf because he's gotten so big. He's under a year old and the same size as Disney, the male leader of the neighborhood clowder."
AskReddit,fcj5uth,t3_eh8gs2,1577678013.0,"I smoke on occasion for chronic pain. Sometimes I'll use it ome bad days, but I need it on the horrible days. On those days all the regular stuff doesn't work and I physically cannot walk because of the pain, even smoking doesn't really get rid of the pain on those days it just helps me sleep. I am so nauseous and tired the next day without fail. I could sleep until 4pm the next day if someone doesn't shake me awake. On top of that my GI doc says it could be contributing to my chronic nausea."
cats,fcisb5u,t3_ehetcs,1577668635.0,"His mom is a former street cat who is on the smaller side (or she was before she got fat) whereas he has been a big boy since kittenhood, hence the name.  His mom has some abyssinian in her for sure, and is a short hair ticked tabby.  He is a long hair who hates water with a passion.  He's chatty, cuddly, has a heart murmur and wheezes sometimes.  He has a large head and paws compared to his siblings, even taking floof into account. His paws have large tufts between the pads. The black and tan coat seems to come from somewhere in his mom's genes as 5 of the 8 kittens of hers I've cared for have that coat pattern, including a distinctive mark right below the scruff."

They were used for a good 20-27 years each and they've been patched within an inch of their lives. I think I'm going to make sturdy interiors and make the exteriors out of felt. It'd feel viscerally wrong to pick out my grandmother's tiny hand stitches in a way I can't express."
