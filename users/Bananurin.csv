YouShouldKnow,ff53yy9,t3_ere17n,1579579581.0,"I hate those ads. I usually fill my car after work, around 11:15pm and I don't like an ad blasting that late while I'm alone. I'm tiny and I'm paranoid someone is waiting or creeping somewhere and will use the obnoxiously loud ad as a chance to come up to rob me or something. I need to hear what's going on around me. I'll try this method next time!"

gifs,femml5w,t3_epu27x,1579262711.0,Getting hit with a dodge all hurts like hell. I can't imagine what it would feel like to be slapped with a ball falling from that height... Hopefully not on anyone's head or on a toddler... Could cause some damage..
memes,fdp1mhh,t1_fdo3xy1,1578617847.0,"Old lady in my neighborhood tries to help too, but they wander around and hiss and do the screaming sex thing under your windows at 3am. They also piss on your tires, and are terrible for local bird populations. 

If she's going to feed them and treat them as a pet, then she should take them in, neuter and spay them, and then keep them inside so they aren't a nuisance to others. Otherwise she's just half assing the responsibility."

That lady is so annoying. Rule number 1 when someone is mad is don't tell them to calm down. I bet she was making passive aggressive comments about some shit and it finally broke him. She seems the type."

pics,fbzo7v1,t1_fbzmhm9,1577253687.0,"Not funny or interesting, but maybe beautiful and elicits adoration. There are comments further below congratulating them and offering advice. Others are posting about their pregnancies and due dates, relating to the image. And they are currently being terribly downvoted for this. Both are quality images that stamp a period in time, the only difference is the positive emotions they elicit."
pics,fbzl55j,t3_ef7e61,1577250394.0,"Six months ago this subreddit upvoted an image (one of the top upvoted images this year) of a father relaxing while he watches his son mow the lawn. [https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/c3sjf3/been\_looking\_forward\_to\_this\_day\_for\_8\_years/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/c3sjf3/been_looking_forward_to_this_day_for_8_years/)

The same subreddit throws a hissy fit over a father's happiness over his beautiful wife as she's about to bring new life into the world.

""We don't know her so we don't care,"" ""leave this on Facebook,"" ""this picture provides no value to the sub."" I find both images charming. Pregnancy is beautiful, as is watching your son do your chores. Not everything needs to be Tiananmen Square here."
