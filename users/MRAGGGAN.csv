I‚Äôm going to politely ask you to amend this, please. 

It‚Äôs better than formula for premature infants, and, typically, NICU infants. 

Formula has come a very long way since the 70s, and is on par with breastmilk. Both milks have their shortcomings, both have their golden stars. 

For full term, medically okay infants, in developed countries, formula and breastmilk are equals, not rivals. 

Just something I like to share. There are tons of women reading these comments, and I‚Äôve already seen a few express sadness about how they weren‚Äôt able to breastfeed their children. 

Clearing up the misconceptions around breastmilk and formula is one of those things I like to do, because I don‚Äôt like when moms feel sad/ashamed/or embarrassed by their feeding choices.

3 pit/staffies in my lifetime, and not a damn one of them could howl, mouth open. 

My current girl loves to AROOO for her dinner, and it cracks me up when she does."

Yes. Because that‚Äôs not illegal."

I was specifically talking about teenage girls vs teenage boys. Not ‚Äúchildren‚Äù vs ‚Äúteenagers‚Äù vs ‚Äúadults‚Äù

Toddlers are the best and worst to work with/be around."
rareinsults,fclzkfy,t1_fclzf3c,1577760364.0,"I didn‚Äôt negate that. I wa directly responding to the comment that said ‚Äúragging on teenage girls‚Äù

Teenage girls suck. I was one, I have a teenage stepsister, and two sisters gearing up to be teenagers. 

Teenagers suck, but in my experience, and literally everyone I‚Äôve ever spoken to, teenage girls are worse.

Edit because you people are crying:


It‚Äôs almost as if everyone‚Äôs life experiences are different. 

Holy shit. 

What a novel concept. 

Get over it. Teenagers suck. In *my* experience teenage girls are the worst. 

Maybe in your experience, blue handed monkeys are the worst. 

Get over yourselves."

Teenage girls kinda suck. Teenagers in general suck, but the girl version just kinda goes extra."

‚ÄúPart time parent‚Äù you do recall that it‚Äôs a fictional tv show, yes? Regardless, when Emily asked him to come to England, he fought her (because of Rachel we know) but also because of Ben. 

It‚Äôs amazing how serious people are taking this, when looking at surface value things that point otherwise. 

1. He fought Emily because of Ben. He even begged Carol to move to England *with* Ben, to be with Emily. 

2. He didn‚Äôt leave with Rachel because of Ben and other things in his life. 

3. He and Rachel made a plan for Emma."

Ross couldn‚Äôt leave NY because of Ben, IIRC.
