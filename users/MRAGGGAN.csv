I’m going to politely ask you to amend this, please. 

It’s better than formula for premature infants, and, typically, NICU infants. 

Formula has come a very long way since the 70s, and is on par with breastmilk. Both milks have their shortcomings, both have their golden stars. 

For full term, medically okay infants, in developed countries, formula and breastmilk are equals, not rivals. 

Just something I like to share. There are tons of women reading these comments, and I’ve already seen a few express sadness about how they weren’t able to breastfeed their children. 

Clearing up the misconceptions around breastmilk and formula is one of those things I like to do, because I don’t like when moms feel sad/ashamed/or embarrassed by their feeding choices.

NAH. 

Mom needs sleep. Baby needs fed. Mom AND baby need the “breastfeed on demand” schedule in the early days. 

*But mom needs sleep*. 

Your concerns for her “yelling or something worse” are fucking **valid**. Slide over to r/beyondthebump and see how fucking many of us are/were dying from sleep deprivation in those early days. 

See how many of us were so terrified of our dark and scary thoughts *because* we literally were never sleeping. 

Further, see how many woman *don’t* have partners *willing* to figure out a way to let mom get more sleep. 

Her concerns for mastitis and screwing up breastfeeding are so so so valid. 

But she could screw it up still if she doesn’t sleep. We *need* sleep to help us produce milk, just as we need demand from babe, and food and water. 

I’d advise you guys looking further into formula maybe 1 time a night. It can HELP.

I was specifically talking about teenage girls vs teenage boys. Not “children” vs “teenagers” vs “adults”

Toddlers are the best and worst to work with/be around."
rareinsults,fclzkfy,t1_fclzf3c,1577760364.0,"I didn’t negate that. I wa directly responding to the comment that said “ragging on teenage girls”

Teenage girls suck. I was one, I have a teenage stepsister, and two sisters gearing up to be teenagers. 

Teenagers suck, but in my experience, and literally everyone I’ve ever spoken to, teenage girls are worse.

Edit because you people are crying:


It’s almost as if everyone’s life experiences are different. 

Holy shit. 

What a novel concept. 

Get over it. Teenagers suck. In *my* experience teenage girls are the worst. 

Maybe in your experience, blue handed monkeys are the worst. 

Get over yourselves."
rareinsults,fclyg5y,t1_fclxang,1577759551.0,"To be fair, having once been a teenage girl...

Teenage girls kinda suck. Teenagers in general suck, but the girl version just kinda goes extra."
TrollXChromosomes,fcjiiid,t1_fcjia9g,1577688902.0,"I seem to recall him being upset about her taking Emma with her. And them discussing visitation. I could be wrong. 

“Part time parent” you do recall that it’s a fictional tv show, yes? Regardless, when Emily asked him to come to England, he fought her (because of Rachel we know) but also because of Ben. 

It’s amazing how serious people are taking this, when looking at surface value things that point otherwise. 

1. He fought Emily because of Ben. He even begged Carol to move to England *with* Ben, to be with Emily. 

2. He didn’t leave with Rachel because of Ben and other things in his life. 

3. He and Rachel made a plan for Emma."

TrollXChromosomes,fcj5hx4,t1_fcj0soj,1577677766.0,I would like to clarify that there’s nothing wrong with being a house spouse as long as it’s truly what you want. :)
TrollXChromosomes,fcj59iw,t1_fciu2pg,1577677602.0,"Ross and Rachel’s scenario isn’t quite the same, though. 

Ross couldn’t leave NY because of Ben, IIRC. 

It sucks yes that she gave up a career to be with him, but it’s not like he conceivably *could* come with her."

Nobody in this thread here is objecting to it, just wondering about risks."

Unfortunately, washing every day isn’t an option for me, it ruins my hair and skin sooo much. 

I’m wondering though, now.... could it have been the coconut oil in my sham/cond? I feel like a dummy for not considering that, but I just took a shower and looked at the bottles again."

Going to have to figure something out though, because we got a jogging stroller, and I’d love to take the dogs with me to go for a run"

Be *extremely* proud!

I’m about 8 years free, I think?

It begins with that very first time of putting the instrument down. 

I’m super super proud of you! 💕"
