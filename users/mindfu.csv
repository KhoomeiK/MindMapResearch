Even besides policies, which I like Bernie much better on, Biden is just not acting right. I don't know what he is thinking. He keeps taking terrible positions on things.

I wonder if he's just surrounded by yes-men, or alternately is just too prideful to take advice.

Maybe he just thinks it's still the 90s so you can win by grabbing the center. But any of the people who can be swung by logical arguments aren't voting for Trump this time anyway."
todayilearned,ff4qr2s,t1_ff4jkts,1579570180.0,"Not actually true. Humans are pack primates. Having a few out of a pack every so often not be competing for breeding, while still being of help to defend, feed and care for the overall pack they're in, provides a definite evolutionary advantage for that entire pack's survival. And thus also an advantage to the genes they share as a group.

There are likely other evolutionary reasons too, including how human sexuality is a spectrum and humans with gay preferences can still have and enjoy having kids.

But even on a strictly binary gay/straight basis we can see the pack benefits there.

Pretty sad, he had a pretty distinguished professional career. Then a woman left him, and it appears that before she left he read her diaries and found out she had an affair with Letterman 6 years earlier. So he tried to blackmail Letterman, and Letterman who is already smart hired a smart lawyer, and this guy got busted

So he served his time. Now he's doing something maybe even sadder, apparently working with James O'Keefe's Project Veritas.
