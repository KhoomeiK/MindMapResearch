On a deeper level we could include other things (education, present value of future earnings, safety nets such as your parents, spouse, or sugar daddy, ability to go back to school, less age discrimination) as constituents to a more general ""portfolio"" that needs to get you through the rest of your life. When you are younger your financial assets are likely a very small percentage of this more general portfolio. Compare this to the other extreme when you are very old and they are almost the entirety of your more general portfolio.

A young person can significantly increase the risk of their small financial portfolio while only negligibly increasing the risk of their overall more general ""portfolio"" (so you could argue that they aren't really being that much more risky). Older people who have a higher % in their financial portfolio cannot do this or take advantage of if to the same extent."

There were definitely better times to buy in recent history, but i don't think it would be a horrible time to buy now if it is within your risk tolerance.

The key price level for another bubble / adoption wave is of course the old record high of $20k. In my opinion, if bitcoin manages to rise above $12k and is able to consolidate there, the likelihood of seeing $20k again rises substantially.

Concerning the halving: if too many people buy beforehand in anticipation of a price increase, a lot of people will be ""selling the news/event"" - see litecoin last year. But with a volume weighted average price probably near $8k over the last two years and \~1.2 million bitcoin worth about $10 billion having been mined within this timeframe, the current price does not seem to be too high."

It would also be good to see how the weights change when certain subsets are removed. IE if three tickers that are ultimately given a negligible or 0 weight are thrown out and the analysis is re-run for the remaining tickers and the weightings are drastically different, that would be a bad sign. My wild guess says that some neat math in the matrix makes throwing out stuff with a final weight of 0 fine (no change in other weights), but that throwing out stuff with small but non-zero weights could mess stuff up quite severely. Also, how about removing the thing with the largest weighting?

Personally I would also be extremely hesitant to weight a portfolio mechanically like this because I imagine that actual changes in correlation between assets over time are larger than the ""small amount of random noise"" added in. But again i'm just speculating."
