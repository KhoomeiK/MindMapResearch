GH5,ff47lpg,t3_er8nmw,1579557291.0,"Never heard of Trekpak before.  Because of this post, I just bought a new Pelican case and some Trekpak to contain all my scattered audio equipment (mics, mixer, cables, voice recorders, etc.) in one place.  Thanks!"

[This](https://www.amazon.com/Cayer-BV30L-Professional-Mid-Level-Camcorder/dp/B0784CWMP4/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Cayer+BV30L&qid=1578758087&s=electronics&sr=1-3) looks like a clean link, but what do I know? ðŸ˜ƒ. Should I repost with it?"

GH5,fclk7xe,t3_ehdmyb,1577749722.0,"I just got one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/b0784cwmp4?&tag=admarketus-20&ref=pd_sl_aB0C2819148407BB8353A0B117) tripods and there are several things to like about it (though I haven't actually had time to use it yet beyond just testing that everything works):

1. Cheap (less expensive than just the Manfrotto 502 head previously mentioned).
2. The head is on a bowl mount making it super easy to level without adjusting the legs.  Even has a level built in.
3. The head has fluid bearings for pan and tilt.
4. Manfrotto mounting plate (comes with two, actually).
5. Very beefy.
6. Legs are very easy to adjust.

Cons

1. Beefiness.  It's neither small nor lightweight, but it does come with a carrying case and shoulder strap.
2. The mounting screws can't be made tight with just your fingers; you need a screwdriver.  I replaced the 1/4-20 with one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KI3J7G2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  Still can't get it as tight as I'd like, but tight enough."
GH5,fbc1l7d,t3_ecjcx9,1576713427.0,"For my taste (so this is purely subjective; feel free to discount to zero), it could have been a little more saturated, and there should have been half the segments, with each segment twice as long; felt like it was jumping around too much.  Otherwise, very well done."
