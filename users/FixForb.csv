Obviously this isn't a quick fix but the LW said this is a skill they want to get better at and I feel like spending some time practicing presenting in front of a mirror/joining Toastmasters/what-have-you is a more sustainable solution that taking a couple of shots before your 9am meeting."
running,ff9tqp8,t3_esdygc,1579721077.0,"One thing that I found was helpful for me when I was super nervous about racing was to think through the (realistic) worst case scenarios. Generally it was something like ""I try my best and have an absolutely awful race in front of a bunch of people"". And the nature of track is that this worst-case scenario had happened to me multiple times and...I had survived it! Yeah, it sucked and was embarrassing in the moment but my friends were still my friends, my coaches still liked me and my parents didn't immediately disown me. And I still enjoyed track practice when I showed up the next time after the race. So it sucked but I knew from experience it was survivable. Thinking through the actual consequences of a bad outcome helped me make it less scary and thus gave it less control over me.

And as a general life practice, I had to make sure I had a life outside of running. Make sure you have other interests besides running and other friends besides those on the team. If your entire life becomes about running it can become very easy to base your self-worth off of race outcomes which means one bad race has you questioning your entire life. It's good to care about running but make sure you value yourself as a human being outside of the time you see on the clock."
running,ff9svj4,t3_esedua,1579720521.0,I've been told before (and noticed it myself) that when we run on the treadmill we tend to run too close to the front panel thing (probably because we're subconsciously afraid of falling off the back of the treadmill) and thus tend to overstride (land more on the heel) to keep our legs under us. This can put a lot of pressure on our ankles/shins. I've noticed that when I make a conscious effort to move backwards towards the middle of the treadmill (which feels weird at first) my stride flows more naturally and feels better.

I figured the only way to race well was to have perfect training leading up to it. Then the day before a big race I had one of the worst runs I'd ever had. I barely made it to 20 minutes, kept having to take walking breaks, my shins were on fire etc. And then the next day I went out and dropped 15 seconds on my 1500m PR.

running,feaflm4,t1_fe9j1wf,1578948126.0,"I'm assuming you're running on an indoor 200m track. If you have a goal time I'd break that down into 5 200m lap increments. So, if you want to run a 3:30 1k, you'd want to run about 42 second laps, with a negative split (your first half of the race is faster than your last). If you know that your heat is based on times (aka everyone is shooting for about the same finishing time) then you can focus a lot more on the pure racing aspect than any pacing part. u/PrairieFirePhoenix has good advice for that. If your heat is unseeded or you have no clue what anyone is running, it would be good to figure out about what times you want to come in for each of the laps (maybe something like 44/44/42/41/39 or whatever makes sense for your goal time) and then have a coach or a friend standing on the sidelines calling out your splits.

changemyview,fe0uf3o,t1_fe0tnup,1578818736.0,Why should being on average stronger/faster mean we encourage only men to play sports?

changemyview,fe0teg1,t1_fe0qfqk,1578818444.0,"No one in this thread is saying that men aren’t ~on average~ stronger/faster than women. We’re questioning why that means we should only encourage one group of people to play sports. And women being allowed to play these -games- is, in America and around the world, a recent phenomenon. Sex discrimination in public sports funding was only outlawed in America in 1972. 

Maybe you should take a bigger picture view of these STEM issues. Why aren’t women applying? Could things beside natural aptitude affect women deciding to major in STEM fields? Why aren’t women interested? Perhaps they underrate their abilities (https://tinyurl.com/m9fjlpw)? Could there be a cultural component to those feelings? 

Expand your mind dude. There’s probably thousands of possibilities and yours might not be the right answer."
changemyview,fe0pfh7,t1_fe0iwb2,1578817145.0,"Yeah, I don't think the ""biologically on average men are stronger than women"" argument works for pushing sports more on men than on women. If you look at it in terms of absolute superiority, maybe, but that's a dumb reason to encourage physical fitness. Participating in physical fitness has many other benefits such as enjoyment, personal growth and health. Why wouldn't we want everyone to experience those? It's also an arbitrary standard. Should we only encourage people to participate in activities we think they're biologically predisposed to? 

And I do think it's healthy for individuals to be proud of being part of sub-communities that are inherently assigned (I'm taking this to mean biologically) if it's done in a healthy way. By all means people should celebrate their Irish culture or Hawaiian traditions as long as they aren't using it to justify hierarchy. But the problem with celebrating ""traditionally"" masculine activities is (1) they're pretty arbitrary and are often culturally assigned rather than biologically. For example, fixing things and being the primary breadwinner for your family are seen as masculine things but there's nothing in our DNA that says that men are inherently better than women at this. And (2) the celebration of certain activities as masculine has often directly harmed women. It was so ingrained in American culture that sports were only for men that women often had no opportunity to compete in sports until 1972 when Title IX passed. The first women who ran the Boston Marathon as an official entrant, in 1967, had to register under a gender-neutral name because women were not allowed to compete. When the race director saw her her tried to physically remove her from the course. The idea that men should control money was so pervasive that my mother (and many other women) couldn't get a credit card without a male co-signer until 1975, after the Equal Credit Opportunity Act was passed. Law was such a traditionally masculine field that it took until 1971 to outlaw barring women from being lawyers. 

Sure, nowadays maybe it's possible to celebrate men being on average stronger/faster without all the ugliness but what about the other stuff? How to we celebrate a cultural idea of men being good with money without also enforcing the idea that women shouldn't be trusted with it? How do we celebrate men for their stoicism and ability to not be ""emotionally broken"" without implying that women are...emotionally broken? I don't think these ingrained idea have served society well. I think we can get along just fine without them.

It seems to me that you think we *need* to celebrate inherently/biologically defined categories and you've chosen masculinity/femininity and all the baggage that comes with that as the one to celebrate. I'd ask why we *need* to celebrate them. When someone celebrates their Dutch heritage they're celebrating the unique culture they descended from, not being from a tall country. Men don't have a unique, definable culture to celebrate. Neither do women. Neither does any grouping that contains 50% of the world's population. I think it makes more sense to celebrate the groupings we're a part of because of our skills. We can celebrate being on a state championship-winning soccer team or as a person whose quilt won first prize. I think it makes more sense and comes with many fewer downsides.

It'll be cloudy and rainy on the east side and sunny and hot on the west side. Weather forecasts don't really work the same way they do on the mainland in which they forecast a rainstorm and you get a rainstorm, our microclimates make island-wide forecasting basically impossible.

trackandfield,fdf8bm7,t3_el2h88,1578355647.0,"I'd say trying to break 2 minutes is a good time to shoot for in your first 600m based on your 400m time. Once you've run it once and know how the race feels you can shoot for more aggressive times. Since it's a 200m track, I'd break the race into 200m and focus on each lap separately. 

If you've been placed into heats based on similar times, then for the first 200m focus on getting a strong position in the field (doesn't need to be leading, just not boxed in, and a good position to be able to pass people later in the race). If you have no clue what the other runners are going to run, then I'd focus on trying to a run a smooth and controlled first lap that feels a little slower than your first 200 of a 400-maybe trying to shoot for a 38 if you can see the clock.

On your second 200m, I'd focus on upping your pace and working to get around people if you can. It might be helpful to think of this 200m as a long lead into your final kick. You shouldn't start outright sprinting but you should be gradually moving faster and faster to prepare for your final kick.

Last 200m: final kick! Easiest part and hardest part. Easy because there's no thinking involved, just go for it; hard because it'll hurt like the dickens.

Good luck!"
