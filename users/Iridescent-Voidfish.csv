suggestmeabook,ff51ihh,t3_erlx7v,1579577702.0,"Robb Hobb’s Fitz/Fool/Elderlings books are amazing and will take you on a freaking journey. Start with Assassin’s Apprentice. 

Jacqueline Carey’s Kushiel books are also very very good..They start off fairly fantasy-lite, more like historical fiction with an alternate timeline, and then they go crazy epic.  Be forewarned that there’s a fair bit of kinky sex scenes, especially in the first trilogy. That one starts with Kushiel’s Dart."

You should not worry about her feeling embarrassed when you talk with her - she *should* be embarrassed. If it makes you truly anxious to call out that you are still awake in the midst of it or to try to talk about it - write a short, to-the-point note and put it on her pillow — “I can hear you at night and it makes me incredibly uncomfortable. Please stop doing that when I’m in the room.”"
