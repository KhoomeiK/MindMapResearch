atheism,fcaryuh,t1_fc9fov0,1577575454.0,"I think all charities get to keep a profit as cash without spending it on a charitable activity, and there are good reasons for doing so.

We tend not to talk about ""non profit organisations"" any more, the better term is ""not for profit"" ie the organisation doesnt exist to make a profit for it's owners, it exists to serve it's community (Or whatever it's purpose is). It can still make a profit, so long as that money is only used to reach its end goals when it is spent."
AustralianPolitics,fc594v3,t1_fbzej6c,1577449414.0,"[the Queensland Uniting Church synod ](https://ucaqld.com.au/solarinvestmentscheme/) actively supports UC investment in solar where practical.

[The national Uniting Church office pooled its resources to manage a bank, of sorts](http://www.unitingfinancial.com.au/managed-fund/ethical-diversified-fund/) to support ethical investments.
 [Victoria](https://victas.uca.org.au/community-learning/u-ethical/) and [South Australia](https://sa.uca.org.au/resources-board/resources-board/ethical-investment-current-exclusion-list) state offices do something similar.

I get the impression this is how their ministers and some members bank their super and savings, looks like a bunch of people putting their money where their mouths are.

(All examples taxed as if they were not church affiliated, btw)"

agnostic,fc474tv,t1_fc3gh32,1577408419.0,"I strongly disagree. I'd even say that an organisation that gives 90% away is the least likely to be viable. Organisations without an asset base are always vulnerable to whatever the funding source wants; if you're relying on government funds, you wouldn't dare challenge the government, if you're relying on corporate sponsors, you won't challenge them. The charities that have some safety and an asset base are able to challenge the status quo and look at the root causes of their issues (poverty, environment,  whatever).

To use the church example: should they really be selling off their properties (ie giving away 90% of their assets), then renting them back?"

Isn't that exactly what you were suggesting though? Like, ""I don't understand why there are gay Christians, why sign on for that"" is saying ""why would you choose to believe in something that is inconvenient?"""
AustralianPolitics,fc02ucd,t1_fbzo0bc,1577275785.0,The Uniting Church? They have most of their money tied up in social justice issues. Many of them preach on it constantly. They constantly put their hands into their pockets and give give give.
