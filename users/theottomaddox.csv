> Alerting Dr. Andrew Jones that Delany was to be arrested on a warrant after being medically cleared, Buckle said he stayed out of sight so as not to cause alarm.
> 
> But almost immediately after Jones left Delany, the patient took off, zipping up his jacket collar and pulling it around his face, Buckle told the court.
> 
> “He’s certainly walking with a purpose . . . he seems to know exactly where he’s going,” the officer said. “Based on his behaviour . . . I believed that Mr. Delany was trying to flee the emergency room to avoid any officers that are there.”
> 
> Two other officers, including the one who called Buckle to arrest Delany, were in the emergency room guarding a prisoner awaiting treatment, court was told.
> 
> Buckle said he approached Delany, touched his left arm and told him he was under arrest.
> 
> “Mr. Delany simply continues walking forward as if I hadn’t said anything to him,” Buckle said.
> 
> Buckle said he pulled Delany’s arm behind his back and handcuffed one hand, telling the patient to give him his other arm. “Mr. Delany is actively resisting me,” he said.
> 
> Gesturing with his hands and arms to reenact the struggle for the court, Buckle said Delany pulled his arm away and tried to face him, prompting the officer to take Delany to the ground.
> 
> “There had to be an escalation of force because we can’t continue spinning in a circle,” Buckle said, noting he feared Delany would use the handcuff on his wrist as a weapon.
> 
> Buckle said he ruled out using pepper spray, punches or pushing Delany into into a wall, opting to take him to the ground.
> 
> “Mr. Delany hit the ground with a significant amount of force. I immediately recognized that he was unconscious based on the arm that I had my grip on had now gone limp,” Buckle said, adding he quickly removed the handcuffs.
> 
> During a heated cross-examination that left Buckle in tears at one point, Crown counsel Jason Nicol asked whether Buckle considers the surface he’s on before grounding someone.
> 
> No, Buckle replied.
> 
> “So, you don’t think that grounding someone into a bed is the same thing as grounding someone into asphalt?” Nicol asked.
> 
> “If (grounding) is my last option, it doesn’t matter what surface we’re standing on,” Buckle said.
> 
> Nicol also asked why Buckle didn’t tell Delany he was being arrested on an outstanding warrant – as required by law – and suggested the officer never put on a handcuff.
> 
> Buckle, who maintained he had handcuffed one hand, said he was going to tell Delany the reason for his arrest, but didn’t get a chance before the two tangled.
> 
> “It was very fast and fluid,” he said.
