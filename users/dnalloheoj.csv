I've got two Klymits (The Static V and the insulated one) and I kind of have to agree. It's not ideal for side sleeping, but it works OK.

What I found that helped was one year we did a winter camping trip so I bought one of [these](https://www.rei.com/product/810386/therm-a-rest-ridgerest-solite-sleeping-pad) Thermarests and put it underneath my Klymit. Did it just because I wanted to be sure I'd stay warm (Was basically 0 degrees both nights) but realized pretty quick that it solved all of my issues with side sleeping on the Klymit. 

That trip was a car camping trip, but ever since then I take it with me backpacking too (Granted, our walk-in to our sites aren't too far) as well as in the summer. I even brought a heavy wool blanket as yet another ""pad"" one year because the hike in was <1mi and that was honestly some of the best sleep I've gotten *ever*, not just camping.

I live in a house that we rent for 1195/mo with a 245k value and a zestimate of 1600$/mo, but it's entirely managed by the owner (Well.. and me.. frankly, I do most of the repairs and such, but deduct parts cost on rent), so this isn't entirely TOO far off the same ""deal"" we're getting (Roughly double the rent and double the value). It's always been a mutual understanding between the landlord and I that if I help around with the house and aren't too much of a pain in the ass, he'll keep us here (as he's presumably still making money off us). 

Hell, there was even a period where we couldn't pay rent for about 6 months but he was totally fine with it as long as we evened up eventually and continued to be ""good tenants."""
