I touch base with friends regularly, colleagues/former managers a few times a year, with indeed weekly and with recruiters very sparingly. So I have a pretty good handle on what kind of roles are available.

I used to go to interviews regularly to see what kind of offers I'd get even when I wasn't particularly interested in leaving my current role.

I used to update my resume on a monthly basis and now I do it semi annually. I tweak it with projects I've done, other duties I've taken on, technical abilities I've learned, etc. so that when I am ready to apply, I can just forward my current one onto whoever I need to.

As for the your second question, I haven't had to do any of that in ages since I've used my direct connections to get the introduction and I just forward them a resume and usually get a quick response to set up an interview.

I check out the hiring manager/interviewer's LinkedIn just to get a gauge for how long they've been at the company, what kind of projects they've worked, what technical abilities they possess, and other basic information. I don't generally message them as that can be annoying."

You might think the work is low skilled, but there's a reason why many of the guys I worked with pulled north of 80k/yr working part time.

Some kid at 18 years with no previous work experience will not be able to work as fast or as efficiently as someone that's been doing it for years. They won't know how to handle customer complaints. They won't know what things matter when things go sideways. What tasks should they prioritize when you have 7 4 tops each in a different stage of dining? What minimizes customer dissatisfaction, and maximizes value for the restaurant when you're in the weeds? 

If someone wants an entry level job at the restaurant, here are the available roles:

* Dish washer
* Host/hostess
* Busser
* Bar back

All of the above roles can be tailored specifically for entry level employees. They'll learn the operations and the various systems. They'll get on the job training for those roles and eventually get mentored to move up if they show promise and some hustle.

We regularly allow stages. A prospective employee may come in for half a regular shift and we'll show them around the bar and the restaurant. They can make a couple drinks or shadow one of the servers or bartenders during their short shift. We'll pay for food afterwards and talk about their past work experience. We use this to determine whether someone is a good fit for a job as a server or bartender. 

The role is an important one since there is a lot of customer contact. I wouldn't let some kid who's never washed a single dish in a restaurant attempt their hand at managing customer relationships. 

The job is easy when nothing goes wrong. It's one of the hardest roles to perform well when you're under pressure. I work a 9 to 5 in multi-million dollar IT projects and I still serve/bartend when my regular workload is low.

Do you ride it on the sidewalks illegally?"
