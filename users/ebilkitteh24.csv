They also adore their older, yet much smaller, cat brother and their huge dog brother. Holy crap.... just realized I'm surrounded by boys... my only girls are my chickens and one of my snakes."

One of mine crop dusts me every now and again, usually after he gets into the dog food or eats something he's not allowed to. Love him but he's a black hole for food"

BackYardChickens,f9l93p2,t3_e4huyz,1575417373.0,"Found on of my girls dead a few days ago, the other night I had the window open.  Heard a commotion at the coop and went to investigate. Saw the glowing eyes under the lean to.  Got mad.  Punted the little bugger to the corner of the pen and retrieved the one girl that had been scared out of the coop and put her back in.  Grabbed a stick and literally beat the tar out of it. Was a young one, I am hoping I won't have to kill another possum.  I like them around to keep the ticks down, but I don't tolerate anything near my coop."
