todayilearned,fcuge1c,t1_fcu65fh,1577980326.0,That's great! Thanks for telling me about this.
todayilearned,fcug9cb,t1_fct8e5g,1577980236.0,"Those directly involved probably did not. The word ""vampire"" entered the English language at about the time when these practices started to take place in the US. It probably didn't become widely used until it began appearing in popular fiction, beginning with John Polidori's ""The Vampyre"" (1819) and later stories, culminating with Bram Stokers's iconic ""Dracula"" in 1897. So, the word wouldn't have been part of the lexicon of a typical 18th or 19th century rural New Englander, although the beliefs and practices were quite similar to vampire mythology."

PublicFreakout,fc5bens,t3_eg1ev1,1577452098.0,"She was only charged with attempted assault. Some critics have said NYC Mayor DeBlasio has pressured the police dept. to downgrade the severity of crimes so statistics show his ""get nice"" approach to crime is succeeding. The evidence suggesting this is only anecdotal at this time, however.

AskReddit,fc09m9d,t1_fbzqmdf,1577284108.0,"This originally had to do with local zoning laws preventing car dealerships from having enormous signs to advertise. Zoning laws don't limit the size of flags, so dealerships began using the enormous flags we've come to associate with them."

HumansBeingBros,fbxti01,t1_fbuiyer,1577200088.0,"It's misleading to characterize people criticizing Common Core as ""anti-intellectual talk radio yakkers"" when you have highly regarded scholar/educators like Diane Ravich, Carol Burris and Nancy Atwell pointing out it's flaws (to name just a few).
I'm certified in multiple subject areas, have a master's degree, have been published in professional journals, and have taught from middle school through college level over a thirty-year career in education. I've never listened to a ""radio yakker."" My colleagues and I have mastered the pre and post Common Core standards and curriculums. No one I've spoken to has felt common core was a positive change. Most feel it has had a negative impact. The billions it cost would have been much better spent elsewhere.The curriculum itself was developed with little input from teachers, is developmentally inappropriate (notably in early math instruction like what's shown in the video) and ignored the needs of special ed students, to mention just a few of its problems. The implementation was rushed, botched, and simultaneously tied to high stake exams. It hasn't brought any meaningful improvement in student outcomes, and has hurt students and demoralized teachers. It's been a boondoggle for corporations like Pearsons, but has done nothing good for students or teachers."
