You're not only putting yourself in danger by running back into the fire, but also the firefighters that will probably go in after you if you don't make it out. If you get out and tell the firefighters where your pets are, there's a good chance that they'll try to save them for you (unless the house is too far gone.) If the house is fucked then that's probably their best bet as regular people don't have the training or equipment to navigate a burning building safely.

While you look around for somewhere to take the rabbit, try to minimize stress. Avoid loud noises or bright lights, don't crowd him and especially don't come at him from above or loom over him like a predator might.

Rabbits can die from stress/shock, so just give him some space. They tend to be very individualistic in what they do/don't like so it's best to just play it safe and let him adjust while you find him some help.

(Just in case it needs to be said: Don't try to make him eat or drink anything he doesn't want to. You don't know how long he's gone without food so he could very well have gone into gut stasis, which is why it's such an emergency)"

I feel for people struggling with addiction and mental health, and I can feel for people who make a mistake and then genuinely try to make it right, but LAOP is being incredibly precious and trying to avoid taking any responsibility at all.

Drunk drivers kill innocent people. A drunk driver almost killed my mom, aunt and their mutual friend. They all suffered pretty gnarly injuries but I think the most traumatic thing was how my mom lost her unborn baby boy after the umbilical cord broke on impact.

A painful fact is that he was very well developed and would have been born soon if not for the crash. We have pictures of him done up all nice and cozy, he might as well have been sitting on my mom's lap for how far along he was.

The drunk driver left unscathed and got a very light sentence, too. All over a drink. I believe he went on to reoffend.

LAOP is fortunate in that nobody was hurt, he could very well learn from this and improve himself if he wasn't pitching a fit and refusing to take responsibility. He's trying so hard to worm his way out of what is probably the best outcome he could have had.

FUN FACT: No glitters are truly ""eye safe."" There are glitters that can be safely used on the body, or even accidentally ingested. And cosmetic grade glitters are obviously made to be way safer than craft glitters. But it's still just glitter at the end of the day, which is always going to pose a risk to our eyes.

Your best bet is buying from well known, reputable brands. It's probably not a good idea to wear ""eye safe"" makeup from a knock off brand that you found on Amazon, for instance. Avoid ""FDA approved"" cosmetic glitter as the FDA has yet to approve any glitters for cosmetic use."

circlebroke2,fduxnqp,t3_emx6la,1578740637.0,"Wow, those comments fucking suck.

Whether or not a woman goes through with a pregnancy is completely up to her. Even if she made a stupid mistake which lead to the pregnancy, even if she could give it up for adoption, even if the father wants to keep it... there are no situations where a pregnancy should be forced. The mental and physical toll it takes on the woman just completely trumps anything else. To me, it doesn't even come down to gender. If we lived on an alien world where pregnancies were done the other way around, I'd be saying the same thing.

That's not to say that the mother never needs to take responsibility, or that the father can't add his own two cents. There's no restriction on who might (or might not) want an abortion, or what kind of relationship they're in (if any.) I can imagine a few situations where I would feel for the father.

Pregnancy (or abortion) shouldn't be punishment, though. The traumatic nature of forced pregnancies/abortions is just, so beyond everything else. I know it's a weird comparison to make but I can't help but think of war crimes/law. It's like, even during conflict, there's a basic understanding of each other's humanity and what is/isn't acceptable. There are things that you just can't do (or at least, aren't supposed to.) Similarly, in the midst of interpersonal problems and disagreements, personal autonomy (in general but also) in a reproductive sense (pregnancy/abortions/castrations/etc) should be respected. You don't need to drop whatever the circumstances around it are or whatever, just leave that aspect up to the individual (as a human.)"

The ones that scream don't make it and nor do their children. Humans haven't lived that life for a long time, so the loud ones stopped dying off. It's just a byproduct of how we've evolved.

Who would have thought that different species have different behaviors? Some animals share parental duties, while others will kill unrelated children. Some animals rely on their family for help, while others are left to fend for themselves early on. There are many unique behaviors in the animal world that they could arbitrarily link to human behaviors that they don't like, or they could get the fuck over themselves. They could also just say, outright, what they're actually thinking, and not hide behind barely even nonscientific nonsense.

It shows how much they know when they say that it can't be painful because it's an ""intended"" natural process. Nothing in nature is intentional, it's just chance whether or not something will kill off a species over time. We're chock-full of vestigial, evolutionary left-overs. A lot of things are.

Both catfish and koi will bully/predate on smaller fish, so it's possible that the fish could have injured or even killed each other.

When introducing a new fish, they need to be acclimated to prevent shock, and quarantined to prevent sickness. That process takes weeks and doing it wrong can ruin even fully established tanks/ponds.

I doubt that they used the correct water. Fish need to be in dechlorinated water, with the proper dh and pH levels, stuff like that. It was probably really stressful and painful for the catfish, and I wouldn't be surprised if the pond suffered for the new water.

Ponds are expensive, and so are koi. Getting the pond back to how it was, was probably expensive, and stressful. 10k in damages sounds about right, not including the fountain or whatever that they broke.

I think the two friends tried to remove themselves from this because the parents were harassing them. I mean, it must really fuck with you if you're one of the last people to see your friend alive, and are just as clueless as everybody else. That + the stress of emotional, grieving parents going after you, must be a lot.

I understand why they're doing this but I think relentlessly asking questions can do more harm than good. Any reasonable chance of those boys being able to help was probably ruined by the parents' flailing."

EDIT: Not Twitch itself*, stuff like Streamlabs. I think Streamlabs (for example) has it's own auto CC that uses Twitch's in built CC interface for when they have live CC for events"
BeautyGuruChatter,fc96qbv,t1_fc8npdp,1577547906.0,">WHY would they let the drama channel to disclose the sponsorships?

US law requires it. Here's the FTC's guide for that stuff https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking

I think it only changed a few years ago, which is why some people still aren't aware. Creators are though, since it's heavily enforced I'm pretty sure"
