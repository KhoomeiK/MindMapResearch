classicminis,ff53oua,t3_erkqkv,1579579361.0,"I've got a reconditioned 998 (with stage one tuning/HS4 carby) in an Aussie made 1977 Leyland and to be honest it is pretty reliable compared to other classic cars of that vintage. I was driving it to work about 4 days per week for a couple of years and had no problems as long as you do a basic service/oil change every 6 months or so. Parts are very accessible too.   


Mileage and reliability is pretty decent depending on how 'spirited' you drive. But the enjoyment factor and maintenance ease makes it a worthwhile and practical investment.   


Rust is probably the biggest threat as u/dangerousbrian mentioned. I never drive in the rain and it is garaged. Never had any headaches in the 5 or so years I've had my mini."
