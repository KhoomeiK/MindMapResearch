I was able to do this because I was a math student who was taking Number Theory concurrently, so I knew all of the background math. Python had everything I needed to write the program, and the things it hid from me like typing between int and long and overflow problems made it possible.

classicwow,feuo1b9,t3_eqke0d,1579388387.0,"Great write up, that's basically PVP in a nutshell.

I would argue though that it would be very easy for Blizzard to fix. The suggestion to hide instance numbers would be one thing. The other would be to add some logic to how players are assigned to games so that added some randomness to how people are assigned to games.

For example, let's say you have 160 people in a premade queueing at the same time. They could be add a random delay, say 10-1000ms, for each person who queues. If, at the same time, there are 1,000 other players queueing, those 160 will be more or less evenly dispersed between them, meaning hardly any of them will get in the same game.

This wouldn't work as well if they were the only people or the majority of the people queueing that time. So if that's the case, maybe you could make it so queue's only pop once every minute. So everyone queue's up, and then when it's time to pop the order is randomly shuffled.

All you really need to do is set it up so that it's very hard for one premade to make up the majority of the people queueing and then add randomness"

worldnews,fekp0pi,t1_feknv8x,1579204628.0,"You basically are trying to boil down the entire middle east into Iran causing everything bad. It's a massive over-simplification of a complex web of alliances and grievances, a large portion of which are caused by blow back against US and European operations in the region.

Just taking your first one, the Yemeni Civil War. It was not instigated by Iran. The Houthi's have existed as a movement for decades and are a response to the Yemeni government being a proxy to the Saudi's and the US and a repressive government of minority rule. The Iranian's funneled military support to the Houthi's in order to strengthen an ally and to try to weaken Saudi positions. In response, Saudi war planes have indiscriminately killed civilians. How exactly does this make Iran the lone bad guy in this situation?"
worldnews,fekniwj,t1_fekmr4s,1579203742.0,"No, that has nothing to do with the situation. Your example is stupid. A country is not a person, foreign policy is not an argument, and deaths caused by collateral damage is not punching a wall.

Do you think those responsible for escalating tensions between two countries are also responsible for any collateral damage. That's the simplest form of the question."
worldnews,fekmp4k,t1_feklju9,1579203247.0,"Those were not the reasons why Trump left the deal. He left the deal because it was politically unpopular with his domestic base. It was a unilateral decision that no foreign policy experts or foreign leaders agreed with except for Israel, whose leadership would like the US to go to war with Iran."
worldnews,fekmd9u,t1_fekgkzg,1579203051.0,"It has nothing to do with my political opinions. Erratic foreign policy by the US will lead to innocent people dying. This is not an opinion, it is a fact. There are very few foreign policy experts who believe Trump's handling of Iran has been well thought out or prudent. The US public does not believe he has been handling the situation with Iran well if you look at polling numbers. Across the board, world leaders are condemning how Trump is handling Iran.

Your example is trivial to the point of stupidity. A better example would be US soldiers dying in Iraq. Do you think Bush was absolved of their deaths simply because he was not the one ordering attacks on the US soldiers? Or do you think that his starting of the war was a primary cause of those soldiers deaths? If you believe the former, that makes you an idiot. If you believe the latter, that puts you in line with just about everyone. I don't see how this situation is any different."
worldnews,fekf1vh,t1_fek8xcl,1579198691.0,"It's pretty rational to see the connection between Trump tearing up the nuclear deal and imposing sanctions and the current state of affairs between Iran and the US.

Part of the president's job is to realize that there is always the risk of innocent bystanders being killed when you escalate conflicts. There was a cycle of escalations between the US and Iran, which led to this mistake. There was no accounting for the risk involved in these escalations, by all accounts Trump is just playing to a conservative base that hated the Iran nuclear deal because it was Obama's.

Obviously Iran is culpable for gross negligence in this situation, but to say that there's no rational way to see how Trump is partly responsible shows that you have very little ability to read cause and effect. Nearly every time you have an escalation, including military force, innocent people die. Trump mostly doesn't care, and most of the time the people who die are not Canadian's, so the Western media and people doesn't care a whole lot either"
Python,feiccbt,t1_fei7cn3,1579135190.0,There's almost no situation where pip install md-to-html would not be enough. It's hardly a realistic question. One situation where you would write your own parser would be if the file was very large and/or you needed to process it very fast. If you consider using Java or C/C++ as a negative in this situation then I wouldn't want to work for you anyways

Python,fehxce8,t3_ep79il,1579125737.0,"It sounds like you pretty much got it, maybe they just didn't like the way you approached the problem? Maybe you didn't ask enough questions? Maybe your code was super buggy?

Depends on a lot of things, but if the size of the file is large I would probably read it one line at a time and then have a parsing function that outputs HTML to a file based on the incoming line, with flags to denote whether it was inside of unordered list or not. This might perform very poorly in Python because the more you stray from libraries, the slower it gets.

I mostly just use python to stitch together modules to quickly develop programs and move on, so I don't think this is a particularly good question. If I had to parse a large file I would probably use Java, and if it had to be fast I would use C or C++, and basically follow the same format"

Second, the world is not facing an existential crisis from having too many toy cars on the sides of the road. It absolutely is when it comes to too much CO2 in the atmosphere, the primary cause of which is the explosion of coal power in developing countries.

If you just turned off coal production in a couple countries, that would be a huge step in the right direction"
