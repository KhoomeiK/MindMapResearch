Instead, they should deliberate among themselves and *compromise*, ultimately dividing projects so that every state gets to be part of *some* projects, but not all. That way, each state can still get its 'fair share', but each project still has a good chance to succeed within its original parameters.

While a senator's job is to fight for their constituents, they shouldn't forget that they, *as a whole*, also have to fight for the US as a whole. And it's mighty difficult to run a country when each of its states are fighting one another over resources and prestige."

gaymers,fexpv4u,t1_fewz1d4,1579434602.0,"Well, no. I think it's important that (prominent) NPCs lives don't stop happening when the player character is adventuring or otherwise not talking to them.

So an NPCs sexuality should be important because it influences their personal development. To reference Dragon Age Inquisition, Dorian and Bull will have relations if neither is romanced by the player. That couldn't happen if NPCs were 'playersexual'.

And, as much as I understand the annoyance of being rebuffed by the NPC that you really want to sex up, I think each NPC having their own preferences makes them feel more real and in turn, it makes the relationships feel more real.

I see the 'suspension of disbelief' argument but I disagree with it. Just because a world has magic in it doesn't suddenly make *people* behave like soulless automatons until prompted by the player to move a certain direction. Because magic and dragons do change the way a world works, but you can still find the 'relative realism' within that world to make it consistent and as real as possible, given the fantasy elements."

As a physical store (that isn't part of a major chain or website), you have to concede that your prices will be higher. You have to find the areas in which you can provide additional service to make up the difference. Which could be as little as being an inviting place where people can browse and can consult your expertise on the merchandise in question.

We, as consumers, must be willing to pay more for the convenience of having a local store (that can/does host regular events and provides a good meeting place to play the game). If we are unwilling to pay for that type of benefit/service, then we must accept that the LGS will disappear.

If there is a serious desire for kids in the long term, it may be wise to disclose that you could not have children 'naturally', as that seems a rather important detail in such conversations. But the reasons why seem irrelevant to me.

I think we need to step away from seeing 'trans women' (as an example) as somehow different from 'women' (I understand there are biological differences, but those are important to your doctor, not to whomever you are dating).

A trans woman *is* a woman. There is no immediately important distinction between the two in a relationship. If there is an important distinction due to whatever circumstances, then it seems logical to bring up the distinction itself, not necessarily the cause."

If every other monster in the region is terrifying, they wouldn't title them all as 'Terror of Qal Sisma'.

The fact that there is a specific reason for calling the bear Goreclaw and Terror of Qal Sisma seems a given. After all, someone made up that name and title and gave it to Goreclaw. So there is a reason. Just being terrifying wouldn't be a good enough reason, given the kinds of monsters they've got wandering around Tarkir.

I doubt Dr Burnham is dead in the traditional sense. Though her continued existence is now in question. Ideally, she's now in the 'fixed' future. She seemed knowledgeable of temporal mechanics, and she 'knew' she hadn't fixed things because the future remained a wasteland. So she, as an expert on the matter, seems to believe the changes she makes will propagate into the future she was pulled into.

At the same time, that desolate future had to have existed for events to play out like they did. And from Dr Burnham's own perspective, it did. But now that variation of the timeline no longer exists. So when she jumped forward in time, she wouldn't have encountered. I like to view 'the future' in Trek to be in a constant state of flux, where nothing is certain and nothing is 'set' until the crisis of the week/month/season has been dealt with.

If it made them happy, then it *is* good. Because the goal was to make them happy. If something does what it's supposed to do, then it's good. Doesn't mean it can't be better. But it certainly wasn't bad."
Games,fd27zjr,t1_fczlv9b,1578143128.0,"I think the issue there is just a lack of overall representation. When your options are already limited, every new (major) release that also doesn't include you (so to speak) compounds the issue.

If there were plenty of options at every tier of gaming, then a game being released without representation wouldn't feel as bad, you'd still have plenty of options."
Games,fd26h0j,t1_fczjtez,1578142438.0,I can hardly blame people for not having an intrinsic understanding of the concept of representation when being represented is perfectly normal for them.

Games,fd25vmf,t1_fd03ydx,1578142184.0,"Judging by the fact that we have an anecdote of girls 'cheering/screaming' for that scene, maybe we ought to consider that what *we* think of the scene is irrelevant because we are not the target audience for it.

This discussion seems like a lot of 'this scene isn't right *to me*, so they should do it differently so it feels more natural *to me*'. Which, fair enough,  we'd all like the best experience for us. But sometimes it's not about us.

(That said, I'm sure there are plenty of women who also think that scene is a tad contrived. But then the entire franchise is contrived. Comic book plots and scenes in general can be very contrived. So in that regard, it fits right in)"

(as found on https://wpn.wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents )

1) If you check the IPG, paragraph 3.7 (Communication Policy Violations), it refers only to direct violations as determined by section 4 of the TR.

2) Section 4 (specifically, section 4.1) of the TR specifies the four different types of information (status, free, derived, hidden) and what you can or can't say for each. Each definition is highly specific. You will note that specific cards in hand fall under 'hidden' information, and that none of the other types specify a requirement to keep track of previous game actions, unless those actions still affect the game state (in which case its free information)."

2) I literally looked up my answer in the current Tournament Rules. So no, I am not wrong. Specifically the 'golden rule' is not present in the Tournament Rules, and that's the only part that would invalidate my earlier statement.

To quote the article:

"" This is the bottom line: Both players are responsible for maintaining a legal game state. Until the game state becomes illegal, they are not responsible for maintaining matching perspectives on the game state. Awareness is a skill-tester.

It's impossible for players to know what their opponents are aware and not aware of, so any expectation that they need to maintain the same view places a communication burden on the players that they can't possibly live up to. ""

And 

""You can even bluff about ""hidden"" information the opponent knows about. They may have used Peek to look at your hand, or the morph in play may have flipped face-down at some point. It's Schrödinger's morph - lie about it to your heart's content."""
magicTCG,fcob0te,t1_fcnwsa9,1577827857.0,"You can lie however you like when it concerns private information. Which cards are in your hand is (often) private information. Even if such a card was previously in another zone, you no longer have any obligations concerning it. You do not have to tell the truth and you are allowed to lie.

Lies are explicitly prohibited only if the requested information is status information, free information or derived information. (This type of information is *not* derived. Derived information has a very specific definition, which this does not fit)"
magicTCG,fcoapab,t1_fcnf6y8,1577827639.0,"To quote the most recent tournament rules (emphasis mine)


  Private information is information to which players have access only if they are able to determine it from the
current visual game state **or their own record of previous game actions**.

   • Any information that is not status, free or derived is automatically private information.

-------

As such, you absolutely can lie. The moment that card returns to your hand it becomes private information and is no longer free information, as you will only have access to that information if they determine it from their own record of previous game actions (as they can't determine it from the current visual game state)."

magicTCG,fc1ozoe,t1_fc0dtvv,1577325158.0,"Ultimately the judge decides. But you're in trouble either way. You either let the player put a card of their choice on top and believe that they aren't choosing a different card that they need more (which would negatively affect the other player), or you make them shuffle the library (which would negatively affect the player themselves).

Either way you risk something for one of the players."
magicTCG,fc1ouhz,t1_fc0jrf1,1577325036.0,"Considering the stories and novels are (nowadays) released or completed long after the set is released, I doubt the stories would have been finished so early. They could have just called it off halfway through and decided they'd need to consider the direction they want to take the story (and production thereof) before moving forward.

Things can and do get cancelled based on new information, even if they have already been worked on. Obviously I don't work for WotC so I couldn't tell if that really happened, but I do think it had some level of impact.

It has been a while since Magic hasn't had anything at all for story when a set/block releases. So this does seem unusual."

But I think one of the main reasons LoL is more popular is because it's designed to be more appealing for casual play (as in, people who aren't interested in trying to reach platinum/diamond/etc), which doesn't necessarily mean it's easier.

But also because LoL is doing a hell of a lot more in terms of marketing and branding. And you really shouldn't underestimate the effect that can have."

Supplemental products are made and priced with the expectation of smaller print runs and fewer sales. Which time spiral proved would be the case for this type of set.

That said, while I personally do find the supplemental sets appealing, I rarely buy anything because the price point is too high compared to what I expect to get from it. Which is a shame."
