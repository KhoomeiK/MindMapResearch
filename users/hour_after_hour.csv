You glance around you in a panic to find something to protect yourself. Your family photos are replaced with pics of Corrin’s feet. Etika laughs. You turn to run and stumble on the smooth and greasy skin. You lock yourself in the bathroom, seemingly untouched by His presence. It’s a normal bathroom. It’s your bathroom. You feel safe. You laugh to yourself that it was all just a weird dream or something, and stand up, looking at Etika in the mirror as you do so. You have become Etika.

[Transphobia’s literal definition on Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia)

The majority of straight men, lesbian women, etc.  would rather date someone who presents female and has sexual characteristics that match their gender. And the opposite is true for gay men, straight women, etc. who would rather date someone who presents male and has sexual characteristics that match their gender. That is not transphobic. 

Making the blanket statement of not dating trans people is, however. I was never arguing against that. The simplification of such an honestly complicated line of reasoning down to assuming what other people should and should not like is what I had an issue with."

Most sentiments I honestly agree with, but I can’t help but be put off by the [poor execution and odd juxtaposition](https://m.facebook.com/assignedmale/photos/a.305470909635180/978609825654615/?type=3).

Some, however, are either controversial or simply [wrong](https://m.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=976471485868449&id=300503316798606&set=a.305470909635180&refid=13&__tn__=%2B%3E). It’s somewhat comparable to PebbleYeet making relatively normal and undeniably funny comics then slapping you in the face with alt-right bullshit, racism, transphobia, and anything that a bigoted piece of shit would agree with. It’s hiding terrible ideas within a sea of otherwise good ones, banking off of the idea that you don’t notice and blindly agree to slowly align with the artist’s views. 

Is Sophie doing this on purpose? Fuck no. She doesn’t understand that not everyone is comfortable with being attracted to someone with genitalia that doesn’t align with how they present. I wish that wasn’t an important factor in liking someone, but most non-LGBT people don’t want to date someone like me, and you just have to accept that instead of making rules that you expect cis people to follow. 

She doesn’t have any bad intentions, and I know she is just blinded by expecting the absolute best out of people (guilty of it myself), but that doesn’t excuse the fact that her comics give off the wrong message.
