science,ff71345,t3_ert356,1579639015.0,"Phages are not a magic bullet. While some infections might respond to a broad spectrum phage, the majority of serious infections do not. They require a very targeted phage. And that needs to be found or cultured very quickly to enable a response to the infection in good time. What works in one patient for one bacterial infection might not work in another patient with the same infection.

Phages work, to a point. But there is a massive amount of research to do yet. Claims it will put the antibiotic makers out of business are rubbish. Those same makers will be the ones licencing and producing the specific phages. The real issue is that they are just not very effective unless they are very specifically targeted. And that is extremely expensive.
