AskReddit,fekp18y,t1_fekhqzi,1579204637.0,"That's a good point for *most* games that are early access. But like I said in my post, they continually do *massive* updates to the game. They just released a huge update into the beta branch that completely changes the overall look and feel of the game. It's absolutely one of the best updates I've ever seen them drop. I've been following them for this long because they actually continue to change, update, and impress with the game.

This is coming from someone with nearly 1k games on my steam account and with a lot of those being cash grab EA games that looked fascinating and ended up being a cash grab.

I have had this game since before the steam release, back on Desura. It's an amazing game. My favorite. And even if they never get out of early access, the game is completely playable right now. And not like an ea build, it feels like a full game. Lots of time and dedication has went into this and the Dev team has weekly blog posts every Thursday outlining what they are working on and what they may be having issues with."
AskReddit,fekhgp6,t3_epj100,1579200127.0,"Project Zomboid. One of the best indie teams ever, they work closely with the players to continue to improve the game. Their updates take a loong time to come out, but they are always worthwhile, never half assed, and they always introduce new things that open up the game for more possibilities.

My favorite game since 2011 and it's done nothing but get much, much better since then. 15 dollars on steam, don't let the Early Access fool you, it's a full game and the best damn zombie simulation out there. They just dropped animations into the beta branch a few months ago which completely changes the game. They don't have online mp working for that *yet* but it's still on and going for the released build right now.

I can't recommend it enough, I must have picked up 6 or 7 copies for friends over the years. And it's never changed price. I paid 15 then and it's the same now. I am guessing it'll jump up a bit after it's finally fully released, but that's probably still a few years down the road. They still have quite a bit that they want to add."

Ostrich gets off work. He's tired, hungry, just ready to go get that bottle of bourbon he was waiting on for a rainy day. Grabs his suitcase and bowler hat, walks out the door. Gets on the bus (lost his driver's license almost a year ago to a drunk driving incident, which is why the bourbon is still sitting there)and heads home. Walks through the door to some indecernable loud bird sounds. He walks in the bedroom to find his wife in bed with another bird. Enraged he starts throwing shit and kicks them both out. Sits down, turns on the TV, pops open the bottle. Just as he's about to poor it, Peter crashes through the wall and slams through his coffee table. The bottle teeters on the edge that's left unbroken before falling, in slow motion, towards the floor. It swaps to the ostrich face as his eyes widen, rage filling. Swaps back to the bottle smashing on the floor, liquid gold staining the carpet.

Swaps to Peter's face. ""ahehehehhehee"""

Twitch,fdpkwdh,t1_fdp2euc,1578631457.0,"My cousins live with me and they are 5 and 9. The 5yr walks around with a broken headset exclaiming how he's going to stream minecraft story mode on the Xbox.

His brother got into playing fortnite after years of watching YouTube and streaming Lego games and such with me occasionally when he was younger. He keeps telling me he ""wants to be a streamer like me"" and I'm just like boy....

I've tried to reinforce good habits to them. If they want a game or something they have to work for it. They come from a broken family, which is why we keep them most of the time, so I think they see YouTube or twitch as an escape from the issues they're going through.

It makes me sad, but I hope the small things I can do to help them build a realistic understanding of how YouTube/twitch streaming really is when they get older. That way they aren't hit by it all at once one day, realizing it's not the dream they're picturing.

Then again, they are children and at least they are enjoying themselves here much more than they would of they lived elsewhere. Sometimes kids will be kids, and it's honestly pretty entertaining to watch the older sibling play occasionally and see his antics. Who knows, maybe he is destined for it. Lol"
Twitch,fdpk5dm,t1_fdpa83l,1578630841.0,"Isn't that the most lifting? When I started streaming I had just lost my job and my car broke down. I was stuck in a lease at my apt for another year so I said fuck it, let's game.

Back then it was a lot easier to get more views. It was super fun, but I was doing it *all* the time. Alienated myself from the outside world and focused solely on building up my stream.

I made lots of friends and I made a nice amount of money for awhile. People sympathized with my issues in life and helped me keep afloat. I wasn't just looking for money though, I really wanted to do this and entertain. I really wanted it to become something.

I got so focused on it, it's all I ever thought about. Wake up, eat, walk the dog, go live. 12 hours a day most days. I was young, I had the energy, let's go!

Then I hit a wall at 100mph. Streaming turned to stress. Worries about money, racking up debt, hanging on to the last thread to keep me going. Some days I couldn't even work up the will to go live because it was internally killing me.

It was then that I realized I wasn't doing it to entertain anymore, I was doing it to try to survive. Suddenly it was a regular job, but as with all self employment opportunities, I was spreading myself thin.

When it came time I sucked it up and moved back home. A few years later I have a car, a good paying job, and that debt is wiped. I feel accomplished and happy that I was able to do that. As for streaming? It became my hobby again. Streams happened when I wanted not because I *needed*. They became focused on getting to know the people that were there, not putting up with a majority of childish viewers just to get the extra view. It was *fun* again.

Now I play whatever the fuck I want and I love it. My viewership is incredibly small most of the time these days, but you know what? I'm okay with that. Now it's more as if friends are stopping by to say hi and hang out, not a proverbial cow for me to milk the teet.

Fuck that stress, I'm too old for that. I want to relax when I game. I respect my health and understanding that this isn't a golden ticket, no matter how fun it is or seems at first, moreso now. I just want to make friends and have laughs."

Much like how I wish there were other companies making games like The Sims for more competition, I wish there were more alternative wrestling games.

Not to say that they didn't provide everything they could for me, we had a decent amount of money at that time for people living like that and they raised me the best they could, but I have many quarks as well. I hate clutter, I have to pick it up or I just feel like crap. I hate expired food, even if it doesn't smell bad, if it's about a week past the expiration I'll throw it away because I get triggered memories of food poisoning. I have very specific tendencies of where I want things and how they have to be. If there's dust on stuff it causes anxiety a lot like clutter does.

I also gained a bad habit of throwing things away that I didn't think I'd need just to find out that I needed them later on, whether it be next week or a year later. Just because I wanted to live as minimalistic as possible."
