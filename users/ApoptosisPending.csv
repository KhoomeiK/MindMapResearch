Biology or psychology are great starters, depending on the school, biology programs are a little more valuable cause its more considered STEM training because of labs and such. Anyway if you're keen with numbers, doing a stats major and later transitioning into neuroscience is a terrific idea. One of the two PhD programs at my school is focused on just stats. The ability to read data and infer probabilities is insanely valuable in any field as we are in the transition of designing software and AI to do it for us."
