conspiracy,fe59jtq,t3_entjz6,1578866841.0,"Quick comparison for fun here:

A basic infrastructural need for society is drive-able roads/ bridges, no? Kind of like a basic need to live is healthcare. 

Now with all of the taxes we pay (income, sales, state/federal) you’d expect the country to have the money to fix these roads without further pay from its citizens seeing as we pay anywhere from 22%-30% just in income tax every pay period. What if anytime a road needed repaired, we were all sent a bill to supplement? Would you be upset? 

That’s how I currently feel about healthcare. I mean shit, I pay for Medicare every paycheck but can’t use it. I got the only insurance plan I could afford ($150/Mo) but have a $5,000 deductible before any test or procedure is paid for. And if I decided to just pay out of pocket when it was needed, I’d be fined a shitload this tax season bc I am required to have an insurance plan or pay a fine. These fucks at the insurance companies get million dollar salaries and million dollar bonuses when there are people who are paying they’re million dollar salaries and are sick— and decide not to go to the dr. Bc they’re afraid they can’t afford it. So they just sit and be miserable. While these fucks eat lobsters inside they’re 3 story mansions. 

I pay $150 a month for insurance and pay 22% in taxes every paycheck but still have to pay out my ass for any kind of medical care. I’m fucking sick of my government not putting my tax dollars where it’s really needed. Honestly, I’d be fine with there being a few more potholes on my roads rather than have to worry about paying rent when I get sick bc of the cost of medical care."

Showerthoughts,fc6y2yu,t3_egf7x9,1577492463.0,"Minimum wage should apply to entry level jobs, only, and should rise with inflation. End of story. You create a problem when demanding a job that doesn’t deserve any higher than minimum wage be paid higher than minimum wage. 

If the employer can’t afford to pay you any higher, it will close and everyone at that company will then be unemployed. Want a higher paying job? Learn a skill that demands higher pay.

I currently work at a business that employs less than 25 people. If they could pay every single person higher than minimum wage, I believe they would. There’s very few jobs here that get payed minimum because they pay, in percentage, what they believe the job of the employee should be paid. That’s the way every business should be.

Why don’t line cooks at McDonald’s get paid higher than minimum? Because their job consists, mostly, of things that people who are being paid higher have thought out. That burger being cooked for “x” amount of time? That was figured out by a chef. That closing/cleaning checklist? Thought out and completed by a manager who gets payed more."
