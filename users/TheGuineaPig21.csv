My very basic understanding is that for it to be slander it has to fulfill three things:

- the statement not only has to be false, but was made with bad faith
- the statement has to have incurred damages on the aggrieved party
- the issuer does not have ""privilege"" which protects them from a lawsuit (AFAIK this covers a wide range of things, from making the statement in an official capacity as a judge/doctor/etc., or believing yourself morally obligated to make the statement)

Basically it's pretty hard to get someone for libel/slander in North America. Like recently Elon Musk got away with calling one of the Thailand cave divers a ""pedo""

He perhaps would have fared better had he chosen a defensive, almost guerrilla campaign. Forcing the allies to come to France and make them face what he himself had faced in Spain. At this point though Napoleon was no longer the man he once was. It's often noted that something changed with Napoleon with time, perhaps with so many victories came a detrimental arrogance. This likely contributed to his choice to fight an offensive campaign they were doomed to lose, as well as other mistakes within Waterloo itself.

There was no political will to fight a defensive campaign, let alone go all-out guerilla. His marshalls resigned rather than fight to the end around Paris in 1814. The entire government abandoned him after Waterloo. The purpose of the Waterloo campaign was as much about morale than it was about strategic concerns.

Actions like this not only undermine trust and support from allies, they also make enemies less willing to come to the table. Who possibly benefits from this situation, outside of Saudi Arabia and Israel? Unless there are major details still to come to light that would very radically reshape the understanding of the situation, I fail to see how the US is ahead in any of this."
TheMotte,fdbti47,t1_fdbqml5,1578261816.0,"This is truly awful. I honestly can't believe this. This is an explicit violation of international law, and if true will have terrible repercussions. 

Trump has seemed very open-minded about committing war crimes (""you've got to kill the families"", all the chumming about with convicted criminals) but I can't believe that military higher-ups would have OKed this. Perfidy against a foreign general/diplomat! There's got to be something more than this I hope. The long-term problems this could cause...."
neoconNWO,fdbrku0,t1_fdai2f0,1578260920.0,How would the Nazis have perpetrated the Holocaust without invading other countries? Almost all (~5.7 of the 5.9 million) murdered Jews were from outside Germany/Austria. In fact if you were to sort the victims by nationality Germany/Austria combined wouldn't even make the top 5

CanadaPolitics,fd401ec,t1_fd3lgzv,1578163138.0,"Well the problem is more that the project - like the Hurontario project that the Ford government dropped funding too - was horrifically, horrifically expensive. $11 billion for ~200 km of greenfield HSR (at 250km/h, which is slow for greenfield HSR) is *atrocious*. Even if we were to assume that it would be completed on budget (which you'd be a sucker to do so) it would still be multiple times the per-km cost of European HSR, across the easiest terrain possible.

There's something seriously wrong about Canadian transit construction costs. Toronto-London would be a no-brainer in any major European country."

stupidpol,fcxjfnb,t1_fcx6z4l,1578064421.0,"I subscribe to a bunch of political subreddits whose ideologies I don't agree with, just to see what they're thinking. I think it's important to at least understand where other people are coming from. And I think the most incomprehensible one is /r/neoconnwo. Not because what they post is so morally disgusting or Trump-supporting or whatever, it just feels most at odds with reality. Like I just don't understand how one could look at the past 20 years and say ""Invading Iraq was absolutely the right thing to do, and we should 100% invade Iran next"""
patientgamers,fcw1r7w,t1_fcvnji1,1578015142.0,"It was a really great gameplay experience **spoilers** when I shot Navarre instead of executing Lebedev and realized that the game would actually let you do that. So many recent games, especially RPGs, railroad you with respect to choices. Often they will very explicitly tell you ""press x for choice a, y for choice b"". Having these organic gameplay elements were really great and I replayed it immediately after finishing it the first time"
