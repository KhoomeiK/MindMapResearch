I’ve found that finding a woman mainly has to do with making others around you feel comfortable and safe with you. I’m sure you understand the things that don’t make people feel comfortable/safe.

It’s the essential trait feminine women look for. They want a man who will be their rock. The man who lets them feel free, who makes them feel understood, the man who makes them feel feminine.

I found that finding a pastime which provides me with many social encounters is crucial to encountering your future woman.

I want to go more in-depth into is but a man named Corey Wayne on youtube is 100x more knowledgeable on this than I am. He is what has helped me improve myself by great lengths.

My basic story is having been a part of the outcast group in life due to familial issues from birth up to highschool which crippled me from being able to socialize with others. I'm sure you understand, the people who were totally ignored in school, cringed at when looked at, blatantly and purposefully ignored when attempting to socialize with even slightly more popular people than you.

When I left high school, I slowly descended into the depths of hell, relying in video games to forget my problems, familial and social. I did the typical round of working, gaming, being depressed, going to sleep; every day.

My mother saw this and thankfully tried forcing me into going to family gatherings where a handful of people my age were present. This is where I give 100% credit to a friend—Aaron—in being such a good soul and recommending self-help YouTube channels to me. I was so extremely desperate for a change in my loop of depression and suicidal thoughts that I immediately jumped onto them. This is where my life changed.

Fast forward to now, I hope to inspire others as my friend Aaron did into helping themselves into making a full 180 in life and for once in their life, being remotely happy."

What I realized in life is that it's almost always dependent on how much proper parenting you received. People who grew up with properly (not overly or deficiently) loving parents who correctly discipline their children will have much easier lives due to all the pieces having been properly put into place for them.

All people like you and I can do is give ourselves the help we didn't get as children. I am happy to have been able to dedicate myself into changing. I do not exaggerate when I say that I spent my entire life being a part of the outcast group—the invisible people in society.
