embedded,feu99ya,t3_eql3iw,1579384366.0,"Have you looked into how much flash is actually affected?  And are we talking about single event effects, total dose, or both?

My hunch is that SRAM is still going to be more vulnerable to SEUs since it has multiple transistors per bit, and flash I think is one, with a trapped gate charge.  I don't know how vulnerable that charge is to radiation or how big a target it is, though.  But SRAM is definitely vulnerable and I would focus a lot of my attention there.

ECC seems like the way to go.  I've got a piece of space station hardware here that I'm told mistakenly had its EEPROM ECC feature disabled and the on-orbit units have to have their firmware refreshed every few years to prevent bit rot.  I don't know how much margin that gives, or the expected failure rate in that span.

An external watchdog is probably a good idea.  Single-event latch-ups can lock up a system until it gets a hard reset.

I haven't done any reading on the topic in years, but I did get seated across from a guy who specialized in that stuff (specifically in RAM-based FPGAs for space applications) at dinner at a conference once, and coincidentally I'd read a paper of his and we had an interesting talk.  Apparently smaller transistors are more vulnerable to upsets when they're hit, but they're less likely to be hit since they're a smaller target.  And lower core voltages can reduce or eliminate the SCR effect that causes latch-ups.  Can't remember a lot of details beyond that, but it's something to look into.  Older parts with larger features aren't *necessarily* better.

Be careful about how you employ shielding, too.  I know a guy who slapped some lead sheets over the SRAMs on a microsat once at the last minute, and it may have actually made things worse.  A high-energy particle zipping through the die might have a small chance of interacting with the circuit, but the same particle would be much more likely to hit the lead shielding and produce a shower of lower-energy spallation products that are more likely to cause trouble.

I'm no expert on the topic so don't take any of this as gospel - it's just stuff to research."
smallbusiness,fet1fyg,t3_eqh950,1579370908.0,"I picked up a used 2 ton 36 volt electric forklift for $2k about 10 years ago and it's served me well.  I only use it a few minutes each month so the old worn-out battery isn't really an issue.

About half of what we get in comes on pallets about that long.  Fork extensions would be a good investment, but I've gotten by without them, except for once I had to borrow some to move my milling machine.  The big pallets are usually loaded with light stuff, mostly packing materials, and I can pick them up without extensions.

Other handy accessories are a pallet puller (big metal jaws with a chain) in case you need to pull stuff from a truck without a pallet jack, and I've got a hitch ball adapter so I can move trailers around.

If you're not using it constantly or over long distances, I'd strongly recommend an electric.  They're low maintenance, quiet, easy to operate, and you can get very fine control.  A 40-amp single-phase charger takes about 24 hours to fully recharge the battery on mine (or would, if the battery wasn't mostly worn out) but if you're not using it every day, who cares?

embedded,feppydq,t3_eqbbm3,1579327402.0,"I resisted for a long time - I was comfortable with my 8-bit tools and saw 32-bit MCUs as unneeded complexity, but it's been worth it.  Far greater capabilities, and the development tools are better.

I have to agree with the others; showing a working prototype would probably go a long way toward easing some fears.  But be mindful of the non-technical reasons your colleagues might resist.  I started out on the 6502 (technically the 8502 for my first assembly code) and used the 6800 and HC11 in school.  For my own projects I mostly used the HC08 - all from the same lineage, more or less.  I had decades of experience with those architectures and had learned all sorts of tricks to squeeze performance out of them and knew the instruction sets inside and out.

Switching to Cortex parts was tough psychologically.  I went from feeling like I had complete mastery of my chosen platform to being a noob.  I was in my mid-30s, and if your coworkers are older it might be even worse for them.  The complexity of the documentation has increased, and the quality and organization (in my experience) has decreased - in large part because of the split between ARM making the cores and vendors like NXP making the actual parts seems to have led to a ""somebody else's problem"" effect where every piece of documentation has vague references to someone else's documents without specifics.  Compared to the days of getting one bound tome from Motorola describing every last detail of the MCU, it's frustrating.  And that's just one of many ways a change might be hard for old-timers.

I don't know what to tell you to get past that.  I made it through the worst of the learning curve probably partly because that's when my doctor switched me to Adderall for my ADD and that first few weeks of being totally wired was when I really buckled down and started to learn the new tools.

If you work with people who actually *enjoy* embedded programming, maybe you can rekindle some excitement by showing off some personal projects and talking about what the architecture can do, *without* actively trying to force a change.

If they're more apathetic, then probably the best thing is to just get through some of the hard parts yourself and bring up a prototype board with the basics covered so they could  just jump in and start using it."

embedded,fel2egl,t3_epnvdw,1579212580.0,">sometimes making things technically less efficient is better for the clarity of your software 

And this has to be evaluated on a sliding scale based on your resource constraints - including development time.

As a simple example, I wrote an NMEA 0183 (GPS data) parser about 18 years ago and the first version would take a pointer to a structure and fill it out with the parsed data.  It was running on an 8-bit MCU with 192 bytes of RAM and 8 KB of flash.  Dereferencing the pointer took up code space and time, and it was always pointing to the same struct.  So I made the struct global and removed the pointer, and it's been fine for many years.

Now I've ported it to a Cortex M4 with 128 KB of RAM and 1 MB of flash.  Making the code clean and reusable (it now has to parse more than one source) is more important than absolute efficiency, and there are many other places in the application with low-hanging fruit for optimization.  The new version is much less compact, but its impact on the system as a whole is minimal.

Since I own the company, I have a direct personal interest in keeping costs down.  Saving $3 per unit on a design that sells 1000 units per year is enough to pay for a decent vacation.  The question becomes how much pain I want to endure squeezing something into the cheapest MCU possible, especially when you take into account the need for room for growth if the firmware is going to keep evolving with future releases.

Be aware of what your compiler is doing, but don't optimize where it's not needed - it'll just hurt your readability and portability and waste time.  Use profiling if necessary to figure out where your trouble spots are, and focus there.

Preprocessor macros can be very useful for keeping your code clean while maintaining some efficiency.  They let you use awkward idioms while still being readable.  You can really shoot yourself in the foot if you're not careful, though - double evaluation in macros being a classic example.

My rule is that macros can be as nasty and convoluted as they need to be, but they get written in their .h file as clearly as I can manage, with clear explanations of what they're doing."

LEDHooping,fe084dp,t3_emv4u7,1578805626.0,"I'm the creator of the Hyperion hoop, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you have!

All of our hoops (Hyperion, Hyperion Phoenix, and Hyperion Lite) have the same high-density LEDs and are about as bright as a smart hoop gets.  If brightness is important above all else, the Hyperion and Hyperion Lite have an advantage in that they have removable batteries.  Running any hoop at high brightness drains the battery fast, and hoops with non-removable batteries (Phoenix, Flux, Astral, Psi, some Future Hoop models, etc) have to stop to recharge.  Also, the clear polypro option will give you sharper, brighter pixels than the colored polypro or HDPE options.  Of all of the hoops I see here every day, it's the polypros that always catch my eye.

Something to watch for in a smart hoop is where the LEDs are positioned and how consistent their distance from the tubing is.  It's something we're really careful about in the Hyperions and it makes a visible difference.  For sharp pixels the LEDs should ideally all be right against the tubing on the outside edge.  Hoop makers tend to cheat to make it easier to put the hoops together.  An extreme example is the Hula Labs Acrobat.  They have no padding, just elastic cord, and the LEDs are *mostly* all against the back wall, but a few are against the other wall where they run over the batteries - makes them cheap and easy to put together, I'm sure, but it looks more blurry.

I see the Flux has already been mentioned here.  Obviously it's a competitor but it was designed by someone I consider a friend and I think it's a good hoop, and the only one I consider any real technical competition for the Hyperion.  The Flux has a different design philosophy and which hoop is right for you depends a lot on your preferences.

The Flux keeps its controls on the tiny on-hoop screen.  That can make it easier to navigate complicated functions without a remote or a phone, but personally I don't like fussing with on-hoop controls and of course you can't use the controls while the hoop is moving.  The screen, joystick, and connector are all in one injection molded piece that's kind of a weak point, but I couldn't tell you how often they break, just that I've seen several break there.

The Hyperion has no on-hoop controls, aside from the power button on the Phoenix version.  You access most features with the 7-key keychain remote or the larger 44-key remote.  The separate remote makes the hoop construction simpler and more rugged (no joystick or screen to break), you can use the remote while the hoop is in use - or someone else can play with the remote while you're hooping - and it's easy to jump straight to preset patterns, change pattern folders, and so on.

For more complicated functions you can use the browser-based controls from your phone, tablet, or desktop.  The Hyperion Lite is the 5/8"" version (which is a whole lot smaller and lighter than the Flux or other Hyperion models) and doesn't include the WiFi features, but does still have both IR remotes.  The Lite is the lowest cost option, normally $299 (about $100 cheaper than the Flux) and it's $50 off through Sunday (coupon code FLASH)."

A logic analyzer is a must.  Saleae isn't as cheap as they were, but still worth the price.  For limited voltage ranges, some models work as oscilloscopes too, but in a very limited way.  It's good for mixed signal work when you need to see the relationship between analog and digital signals, and for a quick check of what's going on in the analog world, but it's no substitute for a real scope.  You can look at logic signals on a scope, of course, but the logic analyzer has protocol decoders that will save you a lot of tedious analysis.

Cheap DVMs are fine.  I've got a \~$400 Fluke, but only because I got it in trade.  A $20 DVM will do just fine for most purposes.

A bench supply with current limiting is also a must.  [Circuit Specialists](https://www.circuitspecialists.com/csi-power-supplies) carries many cheap options.  The current limiting will help prevent blowing things up when you make a mistake, the current display gives you valuable information about what's going on, and constant current mode is useful for stuff like charging oddball batteries manually.

I've got one primary workbench PC (with dual monitors) that I use for all of my development and design work.  There's also a Linux laptop on a swing out arm on one end of the workbench for testing purposes, and an old XP machine for running things like the pick and place machine and old EPROM programmers.  One PC is just fine for starters, though.

The 10-pin SWD connectors are standard for Cortex parts.  For production boards I use the TagConnect TC-2030-NL, which is a 6-pin pogo adapter that doesn't require any parts to be installed on the board and takes up very little space.  If you grind down the alignment pins a bit you can stick the programming pads on the back side of the board under the MCU for many package types.

Looking around the room, other stuff I use frequently includes:

Programmable DC load.  I don't use it often, but it's super handy at times.

Function generator

Hot air rework station.  I'd consider this a necessity for any modern electronics work.

Stereo boom microscope.  You can get by with a USB scope, but if you can afford it, a boom microscope is well worth it.  I use mine with 10x WF eyepieces and a 0.5x reducer for 5x magnification with good depth of field and working distance.  Unlike the USB scope, you get depth perception and basically unlimited resolution.  Mine's a trinocular scope so I can still hook a camera up if I want to take photos or put it on the screen.

Thermal camera.  You can get one for around $200, and they're really useful.  Find one with adjustable focus - mine doesn't do well close up.

Tweezers.  Good ones, but not super expensive ones.  I think these are mostly in the $6 range.  Straight needle point, curved needle point, and wider straight tweezers at least.  Combine a good soldering station with good tweezers and a stereo microscope (and don't forget the flux!) and you'll find your soldering capabilities are massively improved."

Well if you want to go there, I feel like the film fails in 123 minutes to be half as poignant as Harry Chapin manages in 4 minutes.

Part of the reason I'm upset about the crappy science is that it feels like the film was just using it (and a serious-sounding Latin title) to lend gravitas to a dull, plodding story that didn't really say much.  It didn't even feel like Tommy Lee Jones was occupying the same space as Pitt - for the amount of connection they had, they could have been shot on green screen separately and never met on set.  The same information could have been conveyed (and more realistically) through log entries."
movies,fdbkb39,t1_fdaj7cl,1578258186.0,"Expecting Interstellar?  Interstellar was another failed attempt at high-concept science fiction that threw in some pretty window dressing with slow pacing and giant plot holes.  I was *hoping* for something that was at least a fun ride like Gravity.

What is the purpose of [this](https://i.imgur.com/FyBmUJF.png) scene?  It's like they wanted to show off a very realistic moon scene (I thought the traverse around the crater was stunning) and then threw in magic anti-gravity dust for... what?  A sense of wonder?  It's a little like watching a non-fantasy period piece in the age of sail and the ship just passes through a fog bank of pebbles with no explanation and no comment, and the magic of flying rocks doesn't actually play into the movie at all.

Neil Armstrong once said the thing that surprised him the most was the behavior of the dust when they landed.  It streamed straight out in perfect parabolas and then when the descent engine shut off the dust shut off instantly too, with the trailing edge disappearing over the horizon in seconds and leaving everything perfectly clear around them.  This scene feels like someone heard his description and thought ""yeah, let's show how alien this place is by doing the exact *opposite* and having dust just hang around in the 'air'"".

Yeah, having dust fall in parabolic arcs without leaving the tiniest floating speck looks weird to audiences, but they went the opposite way and just made it levitate in a way that was so unusual that even a trained astronaut had to stick his hand out to investigate."

They could have done that with the father on a remote island or Antarctica or something.  Running into baboons and pirates along the way would have at least made a little more sense there.

Instead, the visual language of the film tells us we're supposed to believe this is the real world and that the rules of the real world apply - it's not presented as fantasy and doesn't make a clear break with our world like, say, Star Wars or even Battlestar Galactica.

We've got Brad Pitt on an inexplicable space tower that has something to do with SETI, despite his dad already having led the expedition that was the last word in SETI.  The tower has no point except to look pretty, establish that Pitt's character has nerves of steel, and to connect his work to his father's.

There's no need for him to go to Mars in person when the message could be sent encrypted by whatever means they have - even with today's tech sending voice comms to Mars is not a huge challenge.  They could have couriered it on a thumb drive.  They could have at least recorded it there on Mars so they could keep him from going off script.

Speaking of the script, having him read a stilted, awkward message totally defeated the purpose of bringing him out there to make a personal connection with his father.  They told him ""come to Mars to do this thing only you can do"" and then when he got there they tried to do it for him.

The pirates were just thrown in as a statement about humans fighting for resources.  Driving hundreds of miles overland in moon buggies made no sense.  How do they supply a major base that way?  How was he attracting less attention on commercial transport?

At one point he reaches up overhead and runs his hand through lunar dust just hanging in vacuum, defying gravity.  I don't know what that was trying to show, other than ""look at our CGI budget and our total lack of understanding of space.""

Then there's the storm drains on Mars (ok, presumably an acoustic suppression system channel I guess) that he can swim up and then access the spacecraft *from the engines*.  And then the crew panics and gets killed *by a fire extinguisher* that's inexplicably filled with instantly-fatal gas, just hanging on the wall.

It took the father's antimatter-powered ship 16 years to get out to where it is now, but somehow this conventionally-powered ship can do it in 80 days.  And all of the planets in between are in a straight line so we can see them going by out the window.

When he gets there, he's somehow parked on the wrong side of Neptune's tiny ring system and his interplanetary spaceship just isn't up for the journey so he has to go right *through* the rings in an EVA pod.  And of course his father is still alive and well after 16 years in space, and hasn't bothered to transmit any of the priceless data he's collected - data that's so complete that it can DISPROVE the existence of life anywhere in the countless trillions of worlds in the universe.

There was nothing in his interaction with his father that couldn't have been accomplished with some recovered log files, with his father being more realistically long dead.

The whole reason for being out there, that this ship was generating pulses that were *increasing* in amplitude as they spread out, ignores conservation of energy.  Somehow no one ever saw this ship as being a possible planet-destroying weapon, yet it managed to happen by accident.

Then we get one final hurrah in the form of Brad Pitt surfing a nuke's shockwave back to earth.  If there was tension about not having enough fuel to get home, we didn't hear about it - they never said it was a one-way trip.  And it ignores the fact that there's no *air* out there, so there's no blast wave, just a giant wash of X-rays, gamma rays, and the mass of the vaporized ship itself expanding at many kilometers per second.

It tries to make a lame story seem smart through a sophisticated setting, but shows a total lack of understanding (or caring) about the setting.

I think the only other one on the market now with a joystick is the Flux, which is also a much more capable hoop than the Evoke.  The Flux is the only one I consider to be any sort of technical competition for the Hyperion.  The original developer (Proton Labs) sold the design to a new company, though, so I don't know what the future of that hoop is going to be.

I've always avoided on-hoop controls.  The Hyperion is mostly controlled using the IR remote controls (a big one and a little keychain one with just the basics), and the big remote has 16 buttons to jump straight to 16 folders of patterns.  Doing more complicated stuff like setting up WiFi can require navigating some menus, but for regular tasks it's all just one button press."
Hooping,fcwnijn,t3_ejaqcv,1578030724.0,"I'm the designer of the Hyperion, so I'm not really unbiased but I'm happy to answer any questions you might have!

I haven't seen the Atomic AF in person yet so I can't say how that one compares.  The older Evokes are proven and popular, but several years behind on technology.  They don't have any motion sensors or wireless connectivity, and their pattern customization is very limited.

I'd still take an old Evoke over a new Pandora.  I've only seen the 5/8"" Pandora in person, but it was clearly designed by someone who has never hooped at a festival before.  As far as I know it's a one-man company, with his daughter helping sometimes with social media promotion.  I still haven't gotten the hang of simply changing patterns on the hoop.

Of the Hyperion models, I'm most proud of the regular removable battery 3/4"" Gen 3 model.  Its one downside versus the Phoenix version (they share exactly the same electronics and code) is that it's not gapless.  But it's lighter, rugged, and easy to repair.  There's less complexity inside and the controller board and connector can be easily replaced by the end user.

The 5/8"" Hyperion Lite has simpler electronics and less sophisticated code, with no wireless option (aside from IR), but it looks as sharp as the 3/4"" hoops, it's super light, and it still has a removable battery.  The battery life is short - about 20 minutes on one battery.  You can stretch that a lot by turning down the brightness and limiting your pattern choices, but where's the fun in that?  I need a break way before 20 minutes of hooping.

Is your broken Pandora the current generation?  3/4"", right?  What's wrong with it?  If it's current and it's just an LED break or something, I might be able to make a trade-in deal toward a Hyperion if you're interested.  I like collecting competing smart hoops to compare and gather detailed specs, and I haven't seen a 3/4"" Pandora yet.

Edit: Forgot to mention the brightness comparison.  The brightness on the 5/8"" Pandora at the highest setting comes out to about 61% of max brightness on the Hyperion, which defaults to 75%.  So medium-bright on the Hyperion is significantly brighter than the brightest setting on the Pandora.  Which is also where the battery difference comes from.  The Pandora is either limited to lower brightness to keep people from complaining about short battery life, by mistake, or possibly because some of the circuitry can't handle the power.  That was the case on the old SpinFx Phoenix - if you bypassed the software brightness limits and put it on 100% bright, you'd probably burn up the board.  Parts will just melt their own solder and fall off."

You'd probably have to limit designs to thousands of transistors instead of hundreds of millions, but you could still beat the old Apollo guidance computers that were good enough to land on the moon.  You can 3D print snap-action switches and stuff, too.

I don't think printable circuits are that far along yet, but there are low-complexity open source soft cores for FPGAs already that'd probably be a good starting point."

Though I've got to say scavenging parts to build computers from embedded hardware is not a simple task - you're either going to have to use MCUs in place, on possibly undocumented and very complicated boards, or you'll have to fabricate circuit boards to use them.  That means finding enough of the same type and package of a part to make it worth doing.

Old PCs are not going to be in short supply any time soon.  Here in my own shop, I'm sure I could find at least a dozen retired desktops and laptops, maybe two dozen computers if you're counting Raspberry Pis and the old XO-1 laptop.  Probably another dozen old tablets and smart phones.  And if you dig around in the loft, half a dozen 8-bit PCs, several old Unix and OpenVMS workstations, and a couple of VAX micros.  Probably 80% of that stuff could already run NetBSD."
