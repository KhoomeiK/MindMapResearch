It performs the same data linkage as EDMC, for things like inara and eddb, and also displays live data from the game. It can, to some capacity, function like the ingame holomonitors without actually needing to pull those menus up. Live cargo and material tracking while mining, jump plotting, system data. Stuff like that. 

I always recommend everybody who plays runs either EDMC or EDDiscovery. Whichever fits their needs."

Get the ball, do your work and pass it on to the next person down stream. Keep the ball out of your court, preferably with no errors because errors upstream cause further errors downstream.

Do what you can, hound people for review, try to anticipate the questions you will need answers to, and just grin and bear the rest. You can ask your boss or client for 10 items of clarification in a bullet pointed list and it would surprise me if you got a useful answer to even half of them.

BokuNoHeroAcademia,fecmh8n,t1_fecksbn,1578977571.0,"I agree with this. Hori is my favorite artist running the weekly game, and I'm sure I'm not alone. He's got an exceptional grasp of all the aspects you need in the comic medium, and he's only gotten better over time. His panels would be keyframes in a sakuga reel. It's almost not fair to compare the animators trying to adapt his work to the source material. 

I don't think it's an excuse. I'd like to see much more quality in this department. Especially because I know the source material is perfect for animated adaptation. But I also can't say I didn't expect this. The anime has its audience, who are going to show up every week. The studio is being pulled in multiple directions, and has multiple priorities. It's no surprise the animation quality has suffered. 

I was mostly happy with the last episode, and the improved quality vs the beginning of the season. It could have been much better, but it wasn't bad."

tippytaps,fdhwyhd,t1_fdhqrjg,1578431657.0,"I suspect I know more about cattle than you do. For starters, cows aren't artificially inseminated unless they are in estrous because that would be a waste of time and resources. While in estrous a cow will stand still to be bred by a bull, and they exhibit the same behavior during artificial insemination. And AI carries the benefit of avoiding the dangers inherent to an animal that weighs a literal ton mounting another animal that weighs slightly less. Safer for both animals.

Let's not pretend that the word rape here isn't being used specifically because it evokes a uniquely human evil with a uniquely human perception of sex. Artificial insemination of a cow isn't rape any more than artificial insemination of a human is rape. It's a clinical process used to mitigate certain dangers and increase certain probabilities."

BokuNoHeroAcademia,fdcmb3a,t3_ekm43t,1578278452.0,"I don't think the percentages are literal.

For one, a literal interpretation of the percentages  just doesn't work. If 100% is enough to level a city block or cause atmospheric changes significant enough to instigate a rainstorm, then 8 or 20% of that is still enough to break every bone in deku's body. Or consider that 5% of the power that can punch a whole through several floors of a concrete building just with air pressure would be like a large caliber bullet to stain's head when applied over the relatively small surface area of a kid's fist.

For another, it's kind of ridiculous when you think about it. There aren't any pressure gauges or sight glasses or fill-level indicators attached to deku anywhere. How on Earth do you quantify a percentage of deku's strength and speed, determine a fraction of that, and stay at that percentage for extended periods of time? Like, just try walking at a fixed and predetermined percentage of your normal walking speed. How would you even do that?

And finally, even Deku himself clearly uses the percentages as a metaphor, at least occasionally. 1 million percent, infinite 100 percent, etc. I think if you treat the OfA percentages as literal you'll bump into problems like you've found and miss the fact that it's mostly shorthand to get to the drama."
