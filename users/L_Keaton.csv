I won't be complicit in ""redistributing"" it to myself out of envy.

On top of that, I'll tell you a fun little story:

American states have the right to decide their own legal drinking ages. The Federal government has the right to determine which states gets how much funding for highways. The federal government reduces highway funding for states that exercise their right to decide their own legal drinking ages. All 50 states set their legal drinking age to the one decided by the federal government. This is the magic of government dependency.

So, regarding your scenario:

Everyone suddenly has more money and as a result everything costs more. Now comes the magic of reductions. If I do something the government doesn't like then the ""free"" money I'm given is reduced accordingly.

Do I smoke? Clearly they shouldn't support such a habit with money.

Do I buy a lot of video games? Clearly I don't need the money.

Am I not a vaguely defined ""productive member of society""? Clearly I don't deserve the money.

The State (praise be upon it) would *own* me. The State (praise be upon it) would *own* you. The State (praise be upon it) would *own* anyone who doesn't have enough of their own money to escape their glorious ability to force dissenters into poverty.

But sure enough they did return. Princess to teach, hero to learn.

The princess though had hid her face, her name, her sex and even race.

Standing before him this young man now told the hero of his plan.

But it required seven sages, six of whom were gone for ages.

\-----

So listen as I tell you how, forest boy who would not bow.

The sages six that you must find all share a fate that is not kind.

Enter the temples, wake them up, take to their lips their fated cup.

In doing this they will awake, their old lives they will then forsake.

Now hurry up, for you must go, the first sage is a girl you know.

\-----

The boy returned, five sages woke and so the hidden princess spoke.

The final sage that you must find stands atop as the sage of time.

You need not look for I am she. I'll now reveal my destiny.

I am the one who brought this age, I am the princess and time's sage.

This tragedy was all my fault, I am not one you should exalt.

The power that I sought to gain has caused this kingdom so much pain.

I was so young and couldn't comprehend that the consequences could be our end.

But take my word, this isn't over, the golden power's like a clover.

That desert man has still not won, of pieces three he has but one.

For when he laid upon his hand the golden power did disband.

Its power he had sought to reap so only Power did he keep.

Wisdom sought out I who knew and Courage now rests in you.

So let us hurry before--crap. I knew I should have stayed a trap.

\-----

You foolish girl and foolish boy, my ignorance was but a ploy.

I knew that you two would unite, now I will claim my divine right.

Too long, princess, for you I've sought and sure enough you've now been caught.

So boy who dares oppose my power, I challenge you to climb my tower.

\-----

With six of seven sages free, he went to meet his destiny.

And with their help he climbed the tower in what could be the final hour.

An organ played a drawn out piece but soon enough the tune would cease.

In a moment the two would meet and one of them would taste defeat.

And so began an epic battle, specifics of I will not prattle.

But in the end with princess free and Evil King on his bent knee

The hero knew he stood no chance, evil fell not to sword nor lance.

But this did not mean that they would lose for the hero's fight was but a ruse.

With the demon left unguarded, their deception they discarded.

Though indeed he was immortal they had sealed him through a portal.

\-----

And so they won or so they say, we don't know what came past that day.

The princess revealed other plans as she went on to rule her lands.

To undo what she felt her crime she gave the hero back his time.

Back to the past the boy was sent and so the binding path was rent.

But that would prove a great mistake, she didn't know what he would take.

Just as he owned it in the tower he still possessed the golden power.

And since he held that sacred token the rest of it was quickly broken.

\-----

In his time, when he returned, in his hand the power burned.

So too was it in the princess, proof enough that would convince us.

And so the man who had sought to crush us was exposed, subdued, and brought to justice.

\-----

But when at last that man was chained, no matter what his life remained.

In what was not his final hour he realized that he held the power.

A divine prank we thought while frozen. Of everyone was he the chosen?

But this is not where it would end, we would not let that man ascend.

Before he unleashed divine might we sealed him in the realm twilight.

\-----

And so we reach this poem's conclusion, I hope that this clears up confusion.

This is not a tale of glory, just the prologue of the story.

The three seals wrought by sages wise will one day break and bring demise.

Across three times this war will wage and that's the legend of the sage."

\-----

This isn't it, it cannot be, for in her hands lies destiny.

The Sage of Time, the only hope, a girl who simply cannot cope.

Not this life and where it went, so to the past a message sent.

To all of those whose dreams reveal it, don't let the desert man unseal it.

\-----

Father please you must believe me! 'twas not a dream but prophecy!

Detest him! Suggest him! Contest him! Arrest him! I beg of you do not bequest him!

I know his eyes, I've seen our fate! So act before it is too late!

\-----

The war we fought has reached its end. The races now all stand as friend.

The desert king has bent his knee. Your dream was not a prophecy.

Depart from here into the yard. I'll not have peace between us marred.

\-----

I'll send him to act in my stead and see that desert man fall dead.

Before that man can steal the throne I'll take the power for my own.

Golden sky and power under will strike him down with divine wonder.

\-----

A boy approached the princess now, a forest kid who did not bow.

Just as she had already known, he had with him a sacred stone.

This was the one of whom she dreamed. Hyrule was saved or so it seemed.

She sent him on an errant quest, the stones are keys so claim the rest.

\-----

The boy returned but was too late, the princess was rushed out the gate.

The desert man on horse of black had dared to make his prompt attack.

The king was dead, the princess hidden, his obstacles had all been ridden.

But 'fore she fled, into the moat she threw the final key and note.

Play the song, open the door, now before Hyrule's no more!

\-----

He entered with the sacred tune but claimed his destiny too soon.

The boy was sealed within the shrine before the Golden Power's shine.

The desert man who followed after entered with a roar of laughter.
