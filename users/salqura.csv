AskReddit,ff7nj3m,t1_ff7nehr,1579653804.0,"I have been doing small things like showering more and better hygiene. But other than that, I can’t. I used to have friends that would force me to go out when I felt down but they all moved away and we lost touch"
AskReddit,ff7n2kv,t3_es401n,1579653481.0,Not so well. I don’t have anyone to give me a reason to leave the house. All I do is lay on the couch and watch tv and I can’t bring myself to do anything else. So not so well

socialanxiety,ff6g09e,t1_ff6fj1n,1579626386.0,It might just be I’m not around as many people anymore. I went to my college therapist and I didn’t like it. But I was feeling super down after I left and after a few years I went to therapy and it was really helpful. I’m still struggling a lot but at least I have someone who isn’t biased  to help me through it
socialanxiety,ff6bpol,t1_ff6ajcb,1579623697.0,"Not at the time, I started Zoloft when I was in high school when my social anxiety was really bad and it really helped. I started going to therapy about a year ago and it went down even more so I switched to a different med to help with my depression rather than anxiety because I learned some skills and the meds still kinda help"

Anxiety,ff2aobi,t3_er8tso,1579498879.0,I steer away from stuff like that because I have really bad anxiety about anything “scary.” I am very interested in criminal mysteries and other stuff like that but I realized I can’t handle it
depression,ff29p4s,t3_er8g22,1579497967.0,My therapist tells me to write a journal entry everyday at some point. I haven’t been doing it because I feel the same way but I’m gonna try tonight.

stopdrinking,fewxtp1,t1_fewnzms,1579421150.0,"Yeah I know how unhealthy it is, ofc. I lost my job and I just started at it bad and I’m finally thinking I don’t want my life to be like this. I mean I knew I didn’t want it but the fact that I’ll be shaky if I go a day without it is not okay, especially for how young I am."
stopdrinking,fewnujy,t1_fewmaoj,1579416190.0,"I called my brother, he doesn’t drink anymore but he was bad. He said shakiness and sweating was normal and said Valium helped. It’s definitely a bit of a wake up call so I’m going to talk to my doctor"
5sos,feir98r,t1_feiqypo,1579145202.0,"Yeah we got seated but we looked online to see what seats were open and moved down. It was mpls, Minnesota. God I forget what tour it was but it was the one before sounds good feels good cause jet black heart came out right before our concert"

5sos,feiqn67,t1_feiqha5,1579144773.0,From where I was there was no camping just people that were waiting outside the door early AM. I don’t think ppl usually camp for a sound check but I’m not sure. But you’ll have fun either way
5sos,feiq4me,t1_feiq3fr,1579144423.0,"Either way it’ll be super great but get there early, and it was barely a meet and greet like I said two seconds so sad face"
5sos,feiq11f,t1_feipxye,1579144354.0,I guess it was a meet and greet but the same thing happens in a sound check from what I’ve read the only difference is you get a two second picture and interaction with them. I don’t know exactly what it was cause my friend won it on the radio
5sos,feehsq4,t3_eop27w,1579034025.0,When I went they collected our phones. We got there around 7am and there was a long line for it. They played some songs and people asked questions and then we took a brief picture with them and left.
