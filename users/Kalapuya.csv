news,fel6c11,t1_fejqngl,1579215001.0,"There are several things going on. With a warmer atmosphere the temperature differential between the sea surface and the atmosphere is smaller, so the heat exchange between the two is slower, resulting in an accumulation of heat in the upper ocean. On top of that, surface ocean circulation is wind-driven, and winds are generated by atmospheric temperature and pressure gradients which are similarly diminishing under a high CO2, atmospheric warming regime. This reduces the amount of wind specifically in the major ocean gyres because of the Coriolis effect, including in the North Pacific gyre where the blob is located, and thus also contributes to a reduction in atmospheric heat exchange. 

In addition, there may be other confounding factors such as reductions in sea ice volumes which means there is more water in the North Pacific. More water means more heat, and thus again slows the rate of atmospheric heat exchange. 

There are also possible interactions with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which may be exacerbating this problem by entering into a warm phase, but the role of this mechanism is still unclear. There are likely similar interactions going on with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation as well, but difficult to say at the moment. This is a very active area of research."

EverythingScience,fdaktzw,t3_ekf1av,1578247191.0,"This makes me wonder at what point is it more cost effective to just make a high quality product with fewer issues, and/or to just repair and replace products without question, versus having a massively bloated customer service infrastructure to deal with all the problems your shitty product creates? Speaking as a former high level manager at an inbound customer service call center for one of the largest corporations on the planet, they were always very concerned with nickel and diming every customer assistance decision, even if it was just replacing a $0.50 part. 

At what point would it just be less costly to make a better part rather than paying the salaries and benefits of the literally *thousands* of customer service reps sitting on the phones 24/7? Surely making a better part that didn’t fail would only cost them maybe a few million per part tops, and 80% of our work was addressing problems with just a handful of consistently (ie poorly-designed or manufactured) parts. But reducing their customer service contact hours significantly could mean reducing their customer service workforce by some percentage - let’s say 10% of the ~4000 they had at the time. The average cost to the company of salary + benefits was somewhere around $85,000, so 400 x $85k = $34 million in savings *per year*. Obviously this is some fast and loose math, but I seriously wonder if anyone of their executives (having met quite a few) are ever really making this connection between the savings of making a subpar product versus the cost of constantly making up for it and losing customer loyalty."
