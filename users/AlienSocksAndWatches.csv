Marriage,ff6i02h,t3_erva1o,1579627618.0,"He should respect your body, your boundaries, and your feelings. He doesn't care about you or your health by the sounds of it. I'd leave him. Him putting it in you while you're unconscious when he knows you don't want that for MANY solid reasons, IS rape."

Marriage,fe4hq7s,t3_eno95w,1578859456.0,(F) I confide in my mom regarding relationship issues but she still treats my husband as a part of the family as a family member should. Both your husband and his family are absolutely out of line.
StoppedWorking,fe44r3q,t1_fe43v96,1578855751.0,"Hey if I identified as a male no problemo, I'd be proud to brag. However I don't, and I doubt my husband would stay if I had a weiner."

bulletjournal,fcxjurf,t1_fcw9a3u,1578064711.0,It is a font! I used the app Canva and traced it. The name of the font is Adele. You have to buy the free trial in order to use some of the fonts including that one.
TrueChristian,fchc3rs,t3_eh9f4i,1577649164.0,"I had always been anti Jesus/anti religion. I was once asked if I would pray to Jesus and I gave it a genuine attempt. I felt the love and warmth of his presence as I continued to pray and I have been building my relationship with him ever since. Whenever I follow his advice I get guidance, answers to my prayers, and lots of love and blessings. I find that when I act out of pride, anger, etc. I distance myself from him and things are darker and messier in my life. I don't like who I am without God."
