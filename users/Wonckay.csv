That isn’t how things work in a free society, and all your comments on the importance of Stalin don’t do anything to justify violating that freedom. If the film was as offensive as you claim, people can choose not to see the movie when it runs, or leave cinemas to exclude it because it’s not profitable. What we have instead is an offended group trying to control what *others* have access to.

Nor is “he was asking for it” an acceptable argument in relation to censoring the game either.

All the obligations of perpetual union, and all the guaranties of republican government in the Union, attached at once to the State. The act which consummated her admission into the Union was something more than a compact; it was the incorporation of a new member into the political body. And it was final. The union between Texas and the other States was as complete, as perpetual, and as indissoluble as the union between the original States. There was no place for reconsideration or revocation, except through revolution or through consent of the States.*


>*Considered therefore as transactions under the Constitution, the ordinance of secession, adopted by the convention and ratified by a majority of the citizens of Texas, and all the acts of her legislature intended to give effect to that ordinance, were absolutely null.

Star Trek has consistently maintained that sometimes you might just have to be the responsible party. *You* need to protect the peace as well as you can, regardless of what others do. To recall Picard, “*What the Cardassians have or have not done is irrelevant.*”

T’Kuvma is a warmonger, but we’re talking about Burnham and her own actions, as well as what the *show* tells us is important. She violated her explicit orders by boarding a ship, which led to the murder of the *torchbearer* on the *Beacon of Kahless*. The episode dwells on this and shows us how important it is to T’Kuvma’s cause.

In the same vein, the need to avoid killing T’Kuvma at this point in the fighting is so explicit it’s a *plot point*, and we know Burnham understands the importance of this fact because she voices it. But in her anger at Georgiou’s death she chooses to kill T’Kuvma, which again the episode focuses on with the attention it pays to her switching the phaser setting. *Then* we see how big a deal T’Kuvma’s death is as well, and it comes at the end of the episode - sealing the fate of a long bloody war as inevitable.

So while the show continually downplays it atmospherically afterwards, it originally shows us in relatively strong contrast how Burnham’s conscious mistakes were part of starting the war. At the end of the fighting Starfleet doesn’t *exonerate* her, they *pardon* her."

The Federation or even Picard being a paragon of virtue is not the issue, but rather what *Star Trek* presents as right or wrong. In *Journey’s End*, Picard desperately tries to find a way to accommodate the natives, and *in the end he does*. They remain on their planet, thank Picard for not forcing them off, and the episode presents the alternative “easy” option of force (that Picard almost chose, yes) as wrong. By the way, the solution isn’t a perfect one either; just one that respects everyone and which they can all live with. And the issue was over peace, not technological advancement.


The way forward from the disaster the *Discovery* crew created should be facing the consequences of their actions. You can’t triumph your way out of your crimes. The show doesn’t even present their mistakes as particularly serious, it barely even condemns their actions on Qu’noS at the end. And none of that is speculative in the least, I saw the celebration on-screen myself. I saw them patting themselves on the back about their ideals because they managed to “not commit genocide”.

By the way, I’m glad they didn’t commit genocide. And I wanted a happy ending. But I don’t want it enough that I’ll pretend it’s merited after the things they did throughout the series. And that’s on the writers and the decisions they made from the beginning, all the way from when they made the Klingons a people who could only understand force and whose grievances against the Federation are brushed off because ""they were going to attack anyway""."
startrek,fdonozt,t1_fdom0at,1578608875.0,"That the Federation ""didn't commit genocide"" is not a bar at all. They entrusted the lives of everyone on the Klingon homeworld to a butcher who *had* already previously committed genocide on them. That everyone involved wasn't court-martialed and discharged makes it clear they didn't regret it, and the fact that you see that as the ""high road"" is telling of what the show has become.

Six months is not proportional to a mutiny and starting a galactic war that killed countless people. But as much as she was portrayed as regretful at first, the show eventually decides she was actually the victim. By your own comments;

>*there was no right answer*  
>  
>*The Klingons were looking for a crusade, and Burnham ended up taking the fall.*

At the end of the day, *Discovery* is a show - and do you know what that means? That there is *always* another way. The writes *chose* to portray overwhelming force as the only option. They *chose* to make handing the lives of everyone on Qo'noS to their butcher as the only option. They *chose* to vindicate these kinds of tactics, and they used Star Trek as their mouthpiece. Here's the rest of Burnham's speech;

>*No, we will NOT take shortcuts on the path to righteousness. No, we will NOT break the rules that protect us from our basest instincts. No, we will NOT allow desperation to destroy moral authority. I am guilty of all these things.*

Except this is all a total farce in the face of the entire first season. She admits to all her wrongdoings but faces no consequences and comes home the savior of the Federation. You come out telling me that the war was inevitable and Burnham's actions were necessary. Starfleet is redeemed because they apologized once the war was over and ""didn't commit genocide"".

startrek,fdohsni,t1_fdo697z,1578605418.0,"I thought DS9 represented a degeneration of Star Trek's ideological integrity, for a variety of reasons. I'll try to give a good explanation as to why.

I noticed three general layers of ideological complexity in the 90's Star Trek. There is simple and pure moralist idealism, then there is the pragmatic critique of that idealism as naive, and then there is the philosophical critique of that conception of idealism as naive, as itself naive. One of the best examples of this I remember actually comes from DS9, [when Bashir confronts Admiral Ross about his cooperation with Section 31 and removing Senator Cretak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhkfuyBLDlY&feature=youtu.be), he asks him;

>*Bashir: You don't see anything wrong with what happened, do you?*

This is stage one. Bashir the idealist is morally outraged that Ross has violated his Federation principles, because violating your principles is wrong.

>*Adm. Ross: I don't like it. But I've spent the last year and a half of my life ordering young men and young women to die. I like that even less!*

This is stage two. Ross the pragmatist understands that he is responsible for actual human lives and that ideals don't bring people back home to their families. This is a very real point, and in many shows it would be the argument-ending answer that is cruel reality. Can Bashir really ask the admiral to risk real lives, people, loved ones for his abstract concepts? But then we get to stage three;

>*Bashir: That's a glib answer - And a cheap way to avoid the fact that you've trampled on the very thing that those young men and women are out there dying to protect!*

And this final stage is what TNG was largely built on - when Picard realized Maxwell was right about the Cardassians but stopped him anyways, or refused to use Hugh as a weapon against the Borg, or stopped Ambassador Alkar from using Troi - but which DS9 began to lose faith in. The idea that the fight is not only to defend ourselves, but the ideas which we believe are worth fighting for, too. That we are inseparable from our principles. To its credit the show still had these moments, but the fanbase seemed to take it as confirmation that TNG was just simple idealism and DS9 was a more ""realistic"" take. The comments section on that video are full of as much.

But the belief that cynicism is more ""realistic"" can also be naive. It can become a delusion used to justify options that were chosen because they were easier, dressed up as being necessary. I'm from Argentina, a country with an unfortunate history of CIA involvement. Maybe because of it, I always respected an American show like TNG in particular for not only being relatively loyal to the non-interventionist analogy of the Prime Directive (usually more so than the fans - I liked *Symbiosis*), but for challenging the convenient fantasy that sacrificing other peoples' freedoms during the Cold War was ""necessary"" instead of just being *easy*. Meanwhile, DS9 and episodes like *In the Pale Moonlight, Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges,* and *The Maquis* begin to slip back into suggesting that soothing lullaby that maybe these things are necessary, that they're excusable. Sometimes even that the willingness to do them and feel bad about it might be a little *noble*. At the end of *The Maquis*, Jadzia Dax says ""***You know, sometimes I like it when the bad guy wins.****""*

What does that tell you? That sometimes it’s not important whether the good guy or bad guy wins. What’s important is that the *Federation* wins, in either its capacity as good *or* bad guy.

Again, DS9 was a degeneration to me but it brought plenty to the table - I was more disappointed by the fanbase's interpretation of it than the show itself. I can accept Sisko as a grittier depiction of a seriously flawed commander, but hearing people defend the false-flag of *In The Pale Moonlight* can be disappointing. Then again, Americans are not as familiar with the *other side* of having a foreign country violate your government and chastise you about how it was ""for the greater good"".

*Discovery* with its glorification of military force and Sector 31 is little more than frustrating to me. The resolution of the Klingon War by holding a gun to the Klingons' heads made me abandon it soon after. Eventually I'll probably finish it."

I also asked why she wasn’t tried for war crimes immediately after entering Federation custody. After she was recruited I only lasted a few more episodes before I called it quits. I don’t watch Star Trek to learn about why Kissinger was right."

worldpolitics,fdmukik,t1_fdmsdr6,1578566500.0,"I'm not sure where you got the impression that I'm not American, but I am.

And you continue to avoid answering my question about what threats the military is protecting us from. Why is it so difficult for you to identify a legitimate danger to American domestic security?

I understand politicians have plenty of blame, obviously - but this isn't about the politicians. This is about your narrative on how civilian ""schmucks"" need to appreciate the military because you claim it protects us from nebulous existential enemies. I am not looking to ""indict"" soldiers, nor was my comparison with the Wehrmacht anything but an extreme example of a general principle. But the fact is that if the military isn't actually protecting us, then they shouldn't be described as such. I wholly believe that service members wish it were, but that doesn't change reality.

Smedley himself (unsurprisingly) said he would not have continued fighting, so are you upset at him as well for criticizing the decision to enlist? Was he making ""an ass of himself"", was he despicable?

>*""I wouldn't go to war again as I have done to protect some lousy investment of the bankers. There are only two things we should fight for. One is the defense of our homes and the other is the Bill of Rights. War for any other reason is simply a racket.""* \- Smedley Butler (*War Is a Racket*)

Smedley also said that the average service member doesn't realize what he's really fighting for, and I'm not disputing that. But I think the willingness to kill without a clear certainty of what you're killing for is worth some criticism."
worldpolitics,fdmozf9,t1_fdmm3s6,1578558719.0,"Why won’t you answer my question? What threat is the military protecting us from?

I am not “questioning their existence”. I have no particular problem with US service members, and to whatever extent they signed up to “protect their countrymen” (as opposed to other reasons like getting paid) I respect them. But that respect isn’t a free pass from any criticisms. I can respect the bloody Wehrmacht for its commitment to defending Germany but that doesn’t absolve them of their actions and methodology in doing so, either.

What I am questioning is their participation in the racket. Yes, they are 10,000 miles away from home. And they are killing people there. Saying “they are brave, don’t question them” is not going to cut it."

AskReddit,fdd2rwe,t1_fdcyb97,1578292457.0,"American involvement has not “limited each nation’s individual power and directed their aggression away from their neighbors”. It has *raised* plenty of nations’ powers (to act as American proxies) and often *directed* them at neighboring nations. There *have* been major wars in the region, and your assumption that the alternative to current never-ending wars would be worse comes with no evidence and is a little hard to even imagine.

Anyways, I come from South America, and your perception of these events seems borderline incoherent. What the US did to Latin America is terrible but it is largely not *worse* than the Middle East. You cannot have an informed perception of what goes on there and credibly make that claim. Some 400,000 people have died in the Iraq War alone, far more than any US-created problem in any South America country. By a long shot. It is baffling how you can see the seriousness of US mistakes in South America but apparently downplay death-tolls in the hundreds of thousands.

Destabilizing has nothing to do with America specifically and is both a hegemonic power mechanism and war-profiteering strategy. But what it certainly isn’t is a “solution”. Suffering in the Middle East is not an American foreign policy “problem”, and none of America’s actions involve intentionally “solving” it. The only thing it has been effective at is writing checks for the war industries, aiding fear mongering at home, wasting taxpayer money and of course, *killing hundreds of thousands of people.*"

I agree that feminism and socialism go hand in hand, but I don’t see how radical feminism and its denial of socialism’s fundamentally classist analysis of group interests would. In fact, it’s a textbook case of what socialists refers to as “false consciousness” - the working class being convinced to attribute their problems to non-economic factors like social strife.

To say that Soviet socialism failed because of patriarchal elements is an extraordinary claim that needs to be accompanied by extraordinary evidence. I do find it absurd to suggest that observing the current state of the Russian Federation a hundred years later is useful in explaining the degeneration of the USSR. You have access to the contemporary historial records, use those. 

*How* does socialism under the patriarchy lead to the USSR, exactly?"
