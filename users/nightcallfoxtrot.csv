To illustrate my point, imagine a war between two countries. Country A has a huge modernized military and infrastructure to support this military. Country B is far behind in both technology, manpower, and infrastructure, but in the meeting of Country B's generals, one pipes up out of nowhere and says ""Don't worry, in 1000 years WE might be the way more powerful country!""

Do the other generals jump for joy? Or do they sit there blankly and say ""..... Johnson, what the fuck does that have to do with anything?"""

atheism,fcz80lt,t1_fcz6ja6,1578095527.0,"You never really have to adhere to science either. While there is any overwhelming level of support for things like the law of gravity, there is always an alternate but unlikely explanation. Even those people who do adhere to the law of gravity should only do so while the evidence continues to support it.

When people do science, they are never proving something, they're only disproving the null hypothesis for that instance. You can only disprove things in science, you can never fully prove something. Ever.

That ***lack of belief*** is what separates science from religion.

That's not to say that nothing is certain. There are several logical proofs and syllogisms that are always true while both the premises are true. But that's because they themselves are conditional. Saying ""all bachelors are unmarried"" is an example of this. It's something that definitionally must be true because of the meanings we have assigned to the words due to practicality. There was a need for a word to fit the concept of an unmarried man, so we made the word bachelor. That's not even an assertion, that's just plain practicality."
