I know others have offered help on your specific questions, but I'm copy and pasting something I wrote a few weeks ago that helps address some new-to-geocaching questions that people tend to have.  


>There's been a lot of recent ""new-to-caching"" threads around here that you might find useful. Some of it repeats itself (I certainly do), but there's still some good stuff in there. [Where do I start](https://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/el4xtc/where_do_i_start/), where to start [when you don't know what you're doing](https://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/ej857k/how_to_get_started_when_you_dont_know_what_youre/), and [answers to a newbie](https://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/eipuq8/newbie/) all have good info and advice in there.  
>  
>There was also a conversation a few days ago [regarding proper etiquette](https://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/el5fax/what_are_some_important_pieces_of_geocaching/) that you might also find helpful.  
>  
>As for helpful links:  
>  
>I recommend reading the [geocaching 101](https://www.geocaching.com/guide/) webpage as well as the [help page](https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php) that actually has helpful information about types of caches, rules, etc...  
>  
>When the time comes, you'll find [geocaching toolbox](https://www.geocachingtoolbox.com/index.php?lang=en) an invaluable resource for solving puzzles/mysteries. Lots of ciphers, codes, etc... It won't have everything you'll need, but it's a really good start. Google is also your friend when it comes to mysteries.

>Love it or hate it, initialisms are very prevalent in geocaching. In addition to the links provided by others, I recommend [this link](https://geocaching.fandom.com/wiki/Acronyms) and [this link](https://gagb.co.uk/acronyms.php)."
geocaching,ff9r5gx,t1_ff7c6kx,1579719248.0,"Same here. There were lots of kids caching where I was living before and it was so sad to see the odd 1 pence or marble in there. I started leaving fun metal key chains, paracord bracelets, and other such things for them. 

Bless the people who leave polished rocks though. I love finding those!"
geocaching,ff9qxm6,t1_ff84o5s,1579719071.0,"I use my computer for solving and logging, and I don't use the app for anything other than field finding, so I don't mind that the checker isn't in the app, but I recognize that others use the app as their primary source of caching and that would be nice if they included it in there. 

&#x200B;

>Then again their app needs a lot of stuff

Yes... yes it does! It needs someone who plays the game to design it because it feels like the designers haven't a clue. There's a lot of small, mild inconvenience level issues that really frustrate me to no end."
geocaching,ff9qnm8,t1_ff76vzc,1579718855.0,"After I read and commented on something on this sub, I decided that any cache that would make me say ""meh... tftc"" will now get a piece of fiction writing from me. I've done logs from the perspective of the dog, I often write little poems loosely related to caching, sometimes I make up ninja attacks or spy missions etc... something that is fun to write (and maybe read). I'm waiting for the day when a CO finally says ""WTH is with your log?"" but it hasn't happened yet!"
geocaching,ff70btk,t3_erz66d,1579638571.0,"15 would be a pleasure if more COs made use of the built-in (or other) checkers! There are a lot around me that don't have checkers. 

I am always working on #16 (write better logs) because I enjoy writing and love getting fun logs on my caches. 

Caching more in the ""off season"" is easy to suggest from places of relatively stable weather, it is hard with the kinds of weather common here. I try to get out in decent winter weather, but there is very little enticing me to cache in freezing rain, storms/blizzards, or when there is less than 4hrs of daylight. The wife and I are planning a x-country ski and cache trip soon though. 😊

Edit: wth with the formatting?!😂 apparently I wanted to scream the first part. Fixed now."

geocaching,fexc3uv,t1_few1g3z,1579428421.0,"Field puzzles are my favourite caches! I always seek them out when caching. They are anything that makes logging the cache a bit tougher than just finding it and signing it and usually requires the finder ti solve some sort of puzzle in the field instead of at home. In this instance, the finder needs to figure out the 3 digit combo. I have seen puzzle boxes / trick boxes that require a specific way of opening the cache, or a log hidden on the back of a measuring tape that just looks like weird swag in the box, a fishibg line high in the trees that you need to follow to find the cache, or a large ballpit where one of the balls was the cache, etc..., but there was no way to tell until you dove in and played around. Some field puzzles are part of a stage before you find the cache. I have one that is a beacon cache broadcasting a coded message that cachers need to decipher to find the coords to the final."
geocaching,fexallf,t3_eqtbtk,1579427756.0,Are there many (active) cachers where you live? You could try holding an event designed to encourage people to make and hide caches (a maker's event type thing).

Our brain works kind of like a file folder when it comes to names. People you love -- like your children -- get filed into one mental file folder. When you try to recall a person's name, you're not just pulling out that person's name, but the whole box of names. My MIL calls her two daughters (who are 10 years apart and look nothing alike) by each other's names.

geocaching,felblgh,t1_fel4972,1579218355.0,"I don't disagree with you, but I think the fundamental difference is that when it's not archived it can be found by users (and they have reason to go look for it); but if it is archived, cachers can't find it."

As for what you and your mates can do. Go caching! Hold an event to meet other cachers. See if you can get a local geologist to attend an event and give a bit of an information about local geology that could help create local earth caches? Organize a hike and cache trip."
geocaching,fek3abd,t1_fek2ksw,1579191699.0,"Sorry, I was unclear. For the trial period, yeah, those organizations might work for NC, but I was thinking more if this got rolled out globally.

geocaching,fek0kls,t1_fejsdr1,1579190027.0,I thought offering an incentive to people who go out to retrieve the cache once archived. A photo with GPS + cache container to the cache page and maybe you get a souvenir or something. The urban caches will probably get cleaned up pretty quickly since COs will probably try to fill in these areas. But the further ones away might need more encouragement.
geocaching,fek0506,t1_fejt1mz,1579189758.0,"Thanks for the further explanation. I can understand that sentiment. For my area (and other areas I've cached in), I think the urban caches are the most likely to be affected by this. Most of the out in the woods caches are owned by very active COs around here.

Perhaps after this trial period HQ can take the feedback and work with it. It would be okay if there was an option for interested parties to have their say before a cache is automatically archived. Maybe a grace period where someone can jump in and say: ""save this cache. We maintain it because the CO passed away"" or ""I'd be interested in adopting this cache"" (and having a better adoption system available)."
geocaching,fejfwuw,t1_feipwur,1579172305.0,">what happens to caches that are in out of the way places?

I've seen this mentioned twice now, but I don't get why out of the way place caches are being singled out as a cache worth saving? Is it because the location is nice? Because another CO could place a cache there if the old/inactive one is archived. Is it because leaving caches is ""littering?"" Because I'm sure GCHQ could set up some sort of incentive for active cachers to go find and CITO these. I'm not being contentious, I just feel like I'm missing a salient point."
geocaching,fejfakd,t1_fej6xza,1579171388.0,"There is a caveat for just that situation. As per the note OP posted, caches placed before 1 Jan 2004 are exempt from this. As are caches with TBs and ""other special circumstances"" -- what those are I don't know. But it looks like even with inactive COs, GCHQ is committed to keeping older caches."
geocaching,fejen2c,t1_feir7w8,1579170394.0,Me too. I think some communities could really benefit from this type of action.
geocaching,fejecdd,t1_feio8fv,1579169948.0,"I would say yes, this is the point of NM, but in my community there are several (at least 3) COs who are not only inactive (not logged on or found a cache since 2013-2017), but some who have ""locked"" accounts meaning even if they wanted to maintain, they are not able to. These COs caches are still active because something that once resembles a cache is in place or because they are infrequently found anyway (hard mysteries). It takes a very long time to get any sort of action on these caches even with DNF and NM. If GCHQ wants to sort out inactive members to help the reviewers, and keep the game fresh by removing the crap, I think that's great."

This sounds like a cache designed to be kid-friendly, hints are likely welcomed. Also, you don't have to read/use the hints either. 

But I agree with folks here: go find the cache and balance the negative with the positive. If you have other caching friends, encourage them to do the same. There's nothing shittier than being stoked about your new cache only to have joyless sourpusses be all crotchety on your cache page."

Alternatively, you can perform a geocaching search (just do a region location) and then add filters: 20000km (max allowed), ""found"" and it should return all of your caches. From there you can add an additional filter ""geocache name contains"" and add the word you're looking for. 

If you are looking for dates, you can perform the search as above (without the cache name filter) and in the results page you can filter by date placed then just go through it manually.

geocaching,fdvlfdd,t3_en2uct,1578748638.0,"I've not had many problems with geocaching with my phone, but sometimes the signal will bounce depending on where I am. Lots of tree cover -- you can bet it's going to be a little less accurate. Lots of tall buildings -- that arrow is going to bounce like a rubber ball. If you are having trouble in wide-open areas with no major obstacles and clear skies, your phone may need to [be calibrated](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/2839911?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en) or restarted.

Keep in mind, as others have said here, no GPS will get you to 0m -- on average I'm between 2 and 10m. Sometimes (see above circumstances), I may be up to 25m. You can see what the accuracy of the GPS is when you're targeting to the cache by clicking on the compass icon on the app. There you'll see +/- and a number. That tells you the margin for error."
geocaching,fdvj213,t3_en5ecl,1578747961.0,"There's been a lot of recent ""new-to-caching"" threads around here that you might find useful. Some of it repeats itself (I certainly do), but there's still some good stuff in there.  [Where do I start](https://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/el4xtc/where_do_i_start/),  where to start [when you don't know what you're doing](https://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/ej857k/how_to_get_started_when_you_dont_know_what_youre/), and [answers to a newbie](https://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/eipuq8/newbie/) all have good info and advice in there. 

There was also a conversation a few days ago [regarding proper etiquette](https://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/el5fax/what_are_some_important_pieces_of_geocaching/) that you might also find helpful. 

As for helpful links:

I recommend reading the [geocaching 101](https://www.geocaching.com/guide/) webpage as well as the [help page](https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php) that actually has helpful information about types of caches, rules, etc...

When the time comes, you'll find [geocaching toolbox](https://www.geocachingtoolbox.com/index.php?lang=en) an invaluable resource for solving puzzles/mysteries. Lots of ciphers, codes, etc... It won't have everything you'll need, but it's a really good start. Google is also your friend when it comes to mysteries.

Love it or hate it, initialisms are very prevalent in geocaching. In addition to the links provided by others, I recommend [this link](https://geocaching.fandom.com/wiki/Acronyms) and [this link](https://gagb.co.uk/acronyms.php)."

It was an Earth Cache, too, so a whole world of different rules. It was nearly 900 before I put out my first physical cache. I know not everyone needs to wait that long, but I'm glad I did."
AskReddit,fdrl27g,t1_fdqjqam,1578686046.0,"I have a similar experience with a [tire shop](https://www.rjstrang.co.uk/) that was right by where I lived. I don't live there anymore otherwise I'd buy all my tires from there forever.

One weekend, my wife and I were planning a road trip and after picking up some groceries, we went to fill the tires and the valve popped. Wife runs over to the tire place to see if they'd help us out. 2 minutes later they're there, joking around with us while they help us put the spare on the car, and then the guy tells us to meet over at the shop. We go over and they fix the original tire, swap out the tires again (spare was a summer tire, the others were winter) and after a chat with us for a few minutes send us on our way free of charge. We were surprised it was free. I'm sure it wasn't that expensive or difficult for them to do, but they were fast, friendly, and free, and the whole experience turned what could've been a rough start to an otherwise fun weekend into just a mild bump in the road.

Edit for a link. Just in case anyone in Scotland is looking for tires."

geocaching,fdljmrk,t1_fdliobb,1578525483.0,"I don't know your situation, but if you have a smart phone that will do just fine. Most around here don't cache with a hand-held GPSr device.

If you only have that old cell phone (or don't want to use your main phone), I think the old phone would work. I don't think you need network access for the GPS to work, but I could be wrong. Download the goecaching app and see if it works!

You will, initially, need wifi access for your network-less phone, however, as you'll need a way to load the caches on the map. Premium membership will help with that by allowing you to download maps offline.

Before I got premium, I use to use my home wifi, look at each individual cache I wanted to go to that day via the app and make sure the map was fully loaded. Then when I went out and lost my wifi access (I don't cache with data on), I could (usually) still see the caches I was aiming for. But I don't recommend this route as it can and has faltered in the past. (I really hope that's clear. It's late) 😂

geocaching,fdlii4h,t1_fdlhj8o,1578524758.0,">Are DNFs really common?

I think they're far more common than people actually report. A lot of people, for whatever reason, are reluctant to log a DNF. But a DNF does not automatically mean the cache isn't there. It's a good indicator, but there's been plenty of times I've gone to a cache that's been found recently, but I couldn't find it or I've gone to a cache that's been DNF'd a lot and I found it no problem."

geocaching,fdk3h3j,t1_fdjyoda,1578495141.0,"My WIG will be part of a series of spy-themed caches I've put out. The player will start outside of a ""bank"" where they need to steal spy documents stashed by an agent in trouble. Once you distract the bank guard and steal the documents, you'll need to navigate your way to a different zone to ""hand off"" the documents. Along the way there's chances to be caught by counter-intelligence muggles, cameras, or police officers. If you trigger these zones one of two things will happen: you'll be spotted by the Muggles and discovered which will reset the game and you'll have to start again. Or you'll be spotted, but will have a short period of time to maintain your cover. There are some other obstacles that you'll face before you're  able to drop off the documents for GeoSpy HQ.

It should take about an hour, maybe faster depending on how lucky you are with the capture zones. It's designed to be slightly kinder on tourists than locals.

Designing it was a bitch at times. There's a lot of contingencies that needed to be accounted for. For example, what happens if someone enters the bank vault zone, but then leaves before they distract the guard? Before I fixed the problem that happens with that action, it made the bank guard impossible to distract which would mean that someone couldn't succeed at the wig without reloading it. There was one issue that happened between two zones that caused a critical error (syntax loop or something?). But I think I've got it to a point where it's working right. I'm going to have my wife test it out when the weather gets a little nicer."
