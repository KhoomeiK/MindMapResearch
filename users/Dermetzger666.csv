I wake up full wood anyway, so why not put that to use, stair directly into the intruders eyes and say, ""It's been a while since we had some fresh meat,"" and start running at him as fast as I could whilst swinging my massive boner wildly. Either hes going to shoot me right there, or run in terror. Either way, nobody is getting out of this unscarred."
