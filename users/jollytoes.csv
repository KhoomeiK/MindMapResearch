philosophy,ff9z8jw,t3_esgt0u,1579724670.0,"I think it's because people have been taught that what they do, say, think, or act can never be wrong. Somehow we got this whole, 'don't pay attention to what other people think' attitude. Paying attention to how others react to us is what tells us when we should be ashamed. We pay attention to no one but ourselves now."

The news they read and hear, along with the people they interact with probably have a much greater chance of being Christian than another religion. It makes sense that Christianity would get bashed on more."

AskReddit,few52o9,t3_eqies2,1579405500.0,I was playing basketball years ago and as I jumped up for a rebound time stopped when I heat my peak height. It stopped long enough that I was able to look around and see the other people on the court in mid-pose. Time suddenly started again. My body had relaxed and forgotten I was in the middle of a jump. I came down all uncoordinated and sprawled to the ground spraining my ankle. I remember that when time stopped it was so peaceful for some reason.

Some things I may only do 2 or 3 times a year, but it’s a learned job skill. My list ended up being longer than I realized. I asked for a 20% raise because I thought we would haggle and meet somewhere around 10%. When their comeback offer was 18% I was done haggling."

AskReddit,fc1ra0d,t3_efipjr,1577327209.0,I did this with my current wife. We were married for 3 years and had a child one year into it. My job at the time involved a lot of travel. I was immature and cheated which led to our divorce. We tried a marriage counselor and stuff but nothing could get us back to where we were before. We were divorced for 2 years. We shared custody of our kid and I made a little business while she excelled in her profession. I guess I matured some during this time and she saw a change in me and my priorities. We dated a bit and when my son found out he was super happy his mom and dad were back together. One thing led to another and I asked her to marry me again. She accepted and we had a low key wedding the second time around. I think we had both talked so much shit about each other and immediately after the divorce to our friends that we were kinda sheepish to be back in love.
