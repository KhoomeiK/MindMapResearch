Mixed race people have the lowest inbreed quotient as far as I know. Breeding with your own parent or your own offspring begets the highest inbreed quotient. And yes I think there’s some causal relationship with physical and mental disabilities from inbreeding."

Edit: I don’t think LSD is a painkiller per se but I do think you categorize pain in a different way. I sliced my foot open running down a filthy beach on acid once, I felt it all but dealt with it much more gracefully than I would have in a different context lmao"
