**Calling this semi-literate mess a novel is false marketing. I expect he'll come for me with a wine bottle.**

October 23, 2014

Format: Kindle Edition

Awful, pompous book written by a pretentious nutbar stalker with delusions of literacy and not a clue in his head. Not many coherent sentences in the book, for that matter; this author loves using big words but hates using them correctly.  


Don't quit your day job, Mr. Brittain. (Of course, if your resume was written as well as this book, that's probably not a consideration anyhow. Did the welfare office overlook all the misspellings on your benefits application?)  


Oh: I live in the Bay Area, just north of Palo Alto. The supermarket across from my place has a good wine selection; my favorite for drinking is pinot grigio, so presumably it'll also work best for beaning me over the head.
