ftm,ffdzhy8,t3_esyugk,1579832813.0,First person I came out to at work happened to also be a trans dude! It’s a small world
Cringetopia,ffdyl7o,t1_ffcegv5,1579832153.0,But it very likely will only partially fade (if this is even real). I’ve seen a lot of people with palm tattoos and while it *does* fade a lot it doesn’t completely disappear you just get bits and pieces that stuck around and other pieces that fade heavily. This is under the assumption that your finger pads are similar to your palm so I could be wrong
transartspace,ffcq3on,t3_estvmn,1579804850.0,This is gorgeous! I love your art style!
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,ffc96pq,t3_eslg93,1579794402.0,Same here! My eyebrows are very sparse and kinda thin so I usually color them in with eyeshadow when I go out

fuckeatingdisorders,ff4sm7w,t3_ermrmg,1579571462.0,"My boss mentioned he tried intermittent fasting once while I was at work that means nobody is eating regular meals and I should be fasting like everyone else

An old one for me was “you cannot drink any calories at all UNLESS it’s vodka vodka calories don’t count”"

FTMfemininity,ff4fdfy,t3_er5ikm,1579562283.0,Yes yes yes I love it! Half the reason I want to get top is so I can wear lingerie and not look so feminine!
transartspace,feztd5o,t3_er0qgl,1579461402.0,So I ordered a 3-in-1 packer and decided to use tindr in hopes of getting to test it out...except I’m scared of hot women
creepyPMs,few0mkm,t3_eqierk,1579403779.0,Dude if he has a “history of in**l behavior” that makes it even MORE dangerous not easier to write off. Incels have committed *multiple* mass shooting and murders and assaults the last few years. It’s not some small personality flaw theyre a legit cult
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fepo87n,t1_fepa2lo,1579325876.0,Yea I’m drunk rn and reading this and the ensuing mod messages quotes really put a damper on my night
insanepeoplefacebook,fepcihc,t3_eq4sic,1579317161.0,I can’t believe everyone in the comments doesn’t realize this is a joke
ftm,femqtt7,t1_felzzk3,1579266929.0,Thanks so much for the long reply! I’ll definitely check out the link
Cringetopia,felt3dp,t1_fek26nd,1579230256.0,I hate that I recognized this
ftm,felozcc,t1_felopzh,1579227420.0,Thanks! I should probably specify I have the shorter needles (I think it’s called sub q? I mix up the names) and he did the injection on the back of my arm. I’m just a little paranoid cuz I didn’t think to ask the nurse any questions on what to do if you mess up a shot
transartspace,fek767l,t1_fejis02,1579194021.0,Bingo!
transartspace,fek7515,t1_fejjemz,1579194002.0,"Thank you! And I’m not 100% sure, I was drawing from pics I find on trans porn subs and it was kinda hard to see the OP’s tattoo"
ftm,fej2xsy,t1_fcphmbc,1579154917.0,Is this still available?
ftm,feizf48,t1_feiz03b,1579151585.0,"Thank you! This is helpful, but also a bummer to find out that it seems like scams are a big thing in the industry"
transartspace,feithnu,t1_feilpdh,1579146791.0,Thank you! I try to just draw real life trans people to make it more authentic and realistic. I see a lot of people complaining that a lot of lewd trans art is like a caricature of reality or romanticizing things so I took it upon myself to draw from irl images
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fefowi2,t3_eolowu,1579061156.0,"(Re)started T about a week ago. I cried over a company telling me I had to wait till the next release for a packer, I haven’t cried in like 6 months. Hormones are wack"
FTMfemininity,fefkg2c,t3_eoqlh5,1579058220.0,Same here! I love crop tops and pretty lingerie but I don’t want to look like a chick wearing them
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,feev9us,t3_eopdty,1579041965.0,Also keep in mind it might not always be safe for the other person to make a comment that outs them
traaNSFW,feeflw0,t3_eoif7a,1579032756.0,I’m having a harder time flirting while I’m in the middle of transitioning cuz at least when I was presenting femme I was a hot femme. Now I’m just a fat boy that has a baby face and I’m too feminine for the gay guys and most of the bi/pan guys I encounter are chasers
bipolar_irl,feee9kn,t1_fed486i,1579031962.0,"I’m not op but I’m a atheist/nihilist/whatever you wanna call me and once when I was manic I was convinced I was a blessing to those around me put here by a god. Not 100% sure *what* god, I think I was leaning towards the Christian/catholic version. I’ve also had psychotic episodes where I was convinced miscellaneous demons were trying to kill me and I don’t believe in demons or spirits or whatever"

traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fe5oblh,t3_ennkc2,1578872086.0,My birth name is kind of uncommon (the spelling is very uncommon) but I’ve learned that it’s actually one of the popular trans femme names now so I’ve seen a lot of trans women with my birth name. I think it’s kinda cute
traaNSFW,fdwbq7n,t3_en3bk6,1578757088.0,Every time I see these posts it refules my love for drawing realistic lewd trans art. Check out my art insta @samishii.ama for some! I’ll definitely draw more today!
FTMFitness,fdwarwv,t3_en4j3b,1578756811.0,Dude I always love your posts! Definitely transition goals every time
creepyPMs,fdw4r9l,t1_fdtznry,1578755043.0,I’ve mostly found cis gay men on hookup/dating apps to be less interested in me than cis bi/pan men or queer men. They rarely reply to me if I message first and if I get a message first they’re usually a chaser
trashy,fdtcpbp,t3_emtgve,1578714887.0,"People park in my parking spot (that I pay for) all the time right next to my house that has a “private parking, tow away zone” sign. I started putting notes on their cars telling them to stop parking there and I’ve seen people get mad at the note"

vegancirclejerk,fdh7cve,t1_fdh709i,1578416964.0,"They’ve had numerous people claim that many animals in perfectly good health get euthanized too, including other shelter workers that sent animals their way and workers at the PETA shelters. And I just looked it up and it was 97.5% dogs in their shelter that got euthanized in 2011. Are you saying almost 98% of the dogs they get are so far gone they need to be euthanized?"
vegancirclejerk,fdh3i90,t1_fdh2clb,1578414588.0,"They’re 100% extremists. To name a few examples, they’ve stolen a dogs out of people’s yards to euthanize them, their shelters have something like a 90% euthanasia rate (don’t quote me on that, it’s some ridiculously high number), they’re viciously anti Pokémon because it supposedly promotes dog fighting, they essentially think a dead animal is better than an animal being a pet, they’re basically huge psychotic hypocrites

Edit: guys I am vegan you can stop telling me about the animal agriculture industry, I’m fully aware and haven’t supported it in five years"
IncelTears,fdewa6f,t1_fdeexsd,1578347925.0,"Yup, women with cats are just “crazy cat ladies”. Women with dogs are “dog fuckers”. There is no winning"
FTMFitness,fdc9syv,t3_ekjply,1578269932.0,"In my experience at Planet Fitness the glass of the showers is blurred (idk how else to put it, they’re foggy?) and you can’t actually see clearly into the shower unless the door is open. Someone would have to be looking pretty hard to realize you’re trans if you’ve already had top and are generally passing already"

Cringetopia,fclqu6x,t3_ehoztx,1577754241.0,"Trans guy here. Unless I’m missing some information, this just feels like the chick is exploiting trans people so she can “get away with” not wearing a hijab. And it’s pretty rude to use being “trans” as an excuse while simultaneously implying that you’re not trans at all with the “do you see this rack” comment"
ftm,fclhnc5,t1_fckbn95,1577748013.0,I was close to doing it myself since it’s so small but I want to be a tattoo artist as a career and self done tattoos are hella frowned upon in the industry so I didn’t wanna get all the supplies only to ruin my chances of an apprenticeship

ftm,fcir9ur,t3_ehen6f,1577667932.0,I neglected to think about the fact that random people I may not want to out myself to might ask me what it means so now I’m a little nervous but I love it anyways! The male symbol on my ring finger because I have a scar from when I used to self harm on that finger in the shape of an X that was supposed to represent me being “unloveable”. Obviously I hate the scar now so I decided to slap on the male symbol on it both as a trans symbol and because I am big gay and I felt like the male symbol on your ring finger would be fitting
FTMfemininity,fc9znpw,t1_fc9rl5d,1577560610.0,I got it custom made by ShapeShifters! They’ve got a ton of really cool binders but they get pretty pricey. And thank you!
