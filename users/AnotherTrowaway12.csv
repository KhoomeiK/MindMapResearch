depression,fel7l5m,t3_epr2ou,1579215779.0,"I'm really sorry you're going through this x. It sounds like all of those illness's together really crushed you, I feel so sorry for you no one should have had to go through that shit at such a young age, you were so young and then all of that shit happened. 

For me my anxiety and depression and low self esteem truly crushed me. I feel like I'm lesser worth than other human beings, my anxiety makes me scared to look at people and my depression makes life a living hell to be honest. Sometimes it feels real good and safe to indulge myself in self pity and daydreaming even though I know it's not healthy for me. 

I really hope you find someone who you can pour out to, someone who you can cry to and get all of those bottled up feelings out to. You should definetely try writing fictional stories inspired by those dark thoughts just to get it all out. 

Many hugs"
