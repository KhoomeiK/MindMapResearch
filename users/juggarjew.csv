Then you do a scan of available LTE bands and choose the one that best works for your needs (usually fastest) and lock to it. Or you can leave it on auto if you want but if you are in a fringe area, oftentimes LTE radios hop around bands which can greatly effect bandwidth. I can get 50 mbps on a certain band but often the LTE radio prefers a much stronger but much more congested band which has a much lower speed. 

Its a great backup for my local cable ISP 500mbps connection."

Netgear nighthawk M1 will theoretically do 1 gbps and I always get very high download speed with it. 

afterall it supports:

It was popular because of the obvious fact that it was unlimited 4G LTE and you could swap the SIM card into any hotspot of your choosing.

I personally have used over 100GB a month with NO SLOWDOWN. Talking 50 mbps+ bandwidth at all times. Also no one uses those stupid Mobley devices, everyone bought a cheap proper Velocity hotspot at least, with many opting for the Nighthawk M1 or Mofi units for home use.

Dont tell me what I do and dont have. I also own two SIM cards/two lines so if I ever did run into throttling I could simply pop the other SIM card in. To date this has never happened to me."

So people took the SIMs out and used them for unlimited data elsewhere. I have two of these plans. Unlimited 4g LTE for $20 a month is stellar.

In my 2018 Volt I only pay $15 a month for the unlimited hotspot. Good for road trips with people, especially where I live where Verizon coverage isnt the greatest."
