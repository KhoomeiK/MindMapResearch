If it was just a couple of thumps (like you said being startled by a toilet flush) I wouldn't worry, but going to one spot and then thumping at you, he's sending a clear message that something is wrong (at least to him). My rabbit didn't thump but when we got a mouse in the pantry, he'd hop over by the pantry door and then just sit there and look at me. I had to pen him up for a bit while I had the traps out."

exchristian,ff9b9m6,t3_esdrfo,1579709031.0,"I miss the music so much. I was in the church choir, the bell choir, and the band. We didn't do the modern ""praise and worship"" songs. We sang the old fashioned choral hymns on Sunday, and on Sunday nights and weekdays (yes, I was in church almost every day) we sang a different set, the old gospel type music out of some ancient tattered brown 19th-century hymnals, songs that I have never heard anywhere else - even in the age of the internet.

Some of that music was so beautiful to me I would cry right there in church and I wasn't the only one either; I guess one could say my congregation was ""blessed"" with a lot of really musical and talented people. (I'm a very musical person)

I still sing and hum the old hymns and gospel songs that no one else seems to know, while I'm cleaning or gardening. It's a habit I got from my grandmother. I don't believe in god or heaven or any of that anymore. I'm a staunch atheist. But hell, I miss singing with my church. Voices raised together in song have a powerful effect on me.

One of the songs that always gave me chills is ""At the Cross"". We did an a capella version in my youth group and I learned all the harmonies (there are like 7 or 8 at least haha). We would randomly sing it together anywhere and I'd get chills every time! It was so fun."

Since I went WFPB I have strived to make food that is NOT swimming in lots of oil and I've mostly succeeded, and made quite a few oil-free perfectly good entrees. So I'm not using oil unless I physically need it in order to keep food from sticking, OR tiny amounts of seasoned oil (like hot chili oil) as part of the flavorings - and as a result I use a lot less salt on the food. I think it's win-win

GI stasis kills within hours. It's important that he sees a vet right away, the ""wait and see"" approach doesn't work with rabbits.
