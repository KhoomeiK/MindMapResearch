Or you just get to be less sad when she eventually drinks herself slowly to death because the relationship died years ago."
JUSTNOMIL,ff6jgz9,t1_ff5zwop,1579628513.0,"Also, I can't help but feel MIL is pretty dense.  Maybe OP didn't see it coming because she has dinner with her parents and has dinner with his parents...combining the two is just more of the same event and efficient.  You get invited to dinner with your child's partner's parents?  That's an announcement dinner."

It has been months since my mother took her first non complimentary thing from me and decided it meant NC.  It isn't every night, but it is a lot of them that I dream about my shitty broken family filled with narcissists who refuse to even try to be better.  


If she haunts you at night, from my experience it is normal.  The universe isn't trying to tell you anything.  Stay strong."

todayilearned,feikjiz,t1_feiip9h,1579140673.0,"There are, but they mostly have rich friends.  For most of us a sudden influx of cash among our non rich friends changes things.  Suddenly there are people who were never more than a Facebook acquaintance all up in your face trying to be super nice to get things. Dinners with the same group of people where you laugh about how frustrated John gets about how much you all suck at math in splitting a check become an expectation that you will pick it up with your lottery money.  And it isn't the money, it is the loss of your friends as peers as you once were."

funny,feffias,t3_eos4u6,1579055236.0,I assume it is a similar scaling that in my 30s I forget by age by a year or so off the cuff.  I'm curious if there is a mental condition here or if birthdays become such a nothing combined with your perception of time (5 minutes of timeout used to be hell as a toddler) that you don't really recognize that 10 years have gone by.

JUSTNOMIL,fde8w1f,t3_ekuy2x,1578333746.0,You can really piss the old bat off by telling her you are raising your child consciously so as to not force any gender or national identities onto them.
JUSTNOMIL,fdal1ry,t3_ekdn99,1578247267.0,Sometimes we say unkind things in the hopes of shocking people into doing something hard but necessary.  Why did she call you?  Was it because she has run out of people in her life who still give her the desired reaction after so many overdoses?  Clearly what is happening now is not working.

JUSTNOMIL,fd66sli,t3_ek3h5b,1578186353.0,Just think.  You can be the start of a thrift store painting someone buys because they are profoundly curious why anyone would bother to put brush to canvas for it.  You can also write a letter and put it in the frame with clues to the mystery.  So much intrigue you get to introduce to this world!

If he wants to string his mother along rather than having an open and honest relationship as an adult for some weird self preservation based on mommy's reaction, that is his problem.  You will not be staying at her home.
