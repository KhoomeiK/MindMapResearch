AskMen,ff66gmz,t3_erv2yu,1579620279.0,"I think that most people who advocate for men's rights are just people stuck in an cruel world who want some help. There are definitely issues that men face that are culturally downplayed which deserve more attention. However, there are also many bigots who misuse the movement to start bad-faith arguments as a way to prevent other groups (women, LGBTQ+ folk, racial minorities, etc.) from making progress and to stir up other discord. 

Unfortunately, the latter group has turned public sentiment against the former group, preventing them from getting help that they need. Double unfortunately, it is up to the good folk to remedy the issue, to emphasis they want help *as well* rather than *instead of*. We need to approach these issues with empathy and kindness and patience rather than with blindness and anger and haste."
