depression,fe8oh0d,t3_eo1usb,1578928609.0,"dude I completely feel u on that, I've always found it mindboggling and unfair that we have to do all this stuff just to fit in, be a part of society and have a life. Not a single person CHOSE to be born but somehow we are forced to do stuff like work and study to eventually get a good job to live life, which sure some people might enjoy when they find their dreamjob or have a passion for it but for alot of people that isn't the case.
The fact that we aren't allowed to just live is so dumb"
