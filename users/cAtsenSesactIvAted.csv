You can substitute mock meats with homemade hummus and burgers, I use soy flour to make veggie patties,a simple recipe is eggplant and red/yellow bell pepper, chop them up and toss them in a frying pan along with oil garlic onion black pepper salt and spices of your choice, saute till soft then add soy flour, shape them and put them in the oven or fry in a pan till golden brown. Easy tasty and protein rich."

vegan,fe6maef,t3_enpd0e,1578895735.0,"I stumbled upon freelee videos where she said she was vegan, she ate bananas and dates and sweet fruit so I thought why not. I didn't even question it, I just switched. After I while I started eating cheese and eggs (rarely but still) again, had a terrible diet caused by stressful events but felt horrible and got a skin rash all over my body so I said to myself I couldn't do that anymore. I watched earthlings and I felt so sick, to these days I still hate myself I gave up Veganism, stupidest choice ever. Animals don't deserve this kind of treatment, when I walk through the meat section in supermarkets I feel nauseated and see carcasses everywhere, see their eyes, the suffering those animals have been through just so that we fucking monsters humans can eat them. Now I still have health problems nothing serious luckily but I don't give a shit, I know for sure that eating death won't help me in any way. Sorry for my bad English"
vegan,fdz1ghb,t3_endpl0,1578785739.0,"From what I know for kids white pasta/rice/bread is better than whole, since too much fiber  can clog them up. Grains are good just make sure to extra cook them till very soft/mushy. Remove the skin from legumes and put them in a food processor till very smooth, fruit is excellent avoid oil(flaxseed oil is good but MUST be refrigerated, the one on the shelf is already rancid, and give her fats for brain development. Tahini/cashew butter or any nut butter are very good sources of Omega-3. Supplement B12 and D."

VeganFoodPorn,fdhqps1,t1_fdh6wn2,1578428298.0,"I think he means that 240 grams of cooked chickpeas don't have much protein, to have more protein they should have nuts or soy. If I eat let's say 10 of these I'll have 7 grams of protein which is not much."
VeganActivism,fd7s01b,t3_ejzj2l,1578209182.0,Disgusting. Revolting. People need to stop with these protein deficiencies/we top of the food chain/the animals are food bullshit!! I am so sick of it!
vegan,fd4pzi2,t3_ejv5wc,1578169941.0,"Woohoo!! Thank you! Just make sure you eat a lot, don't eat too much fiber initially but increase step by step. If u intend to stay vegan take a B12 supplement and if you live in a place with cold climate vitD too. When you go grocery shopping make sure to buy all the things you need and like, this way you can cook many many different things without it getting boring. I really really hope you enjoy your vegan fast journey, good luck!!"
cats,fd33qjk,t1_fd2esfi,1578154443.0,"Cat food(from what I know)is very high in fat which is heavy on the dog liver, that's why vets recommend to not let dogs eat cat food. Also every animal is different, for example dogs can eat a type of mushroom that is toxic to us, and we can eat chocolate but dogs can't. Each species has it's own food and pet food is formulated keeping this in mind. ahh poor cat, maybe he had pica :( 
I know the struggle it can be quite difficult to keep an eye on them especially when you have more than one pet...you could try an lock for 5-15 minutes your dogs with their food till they eat all of it and if they leave some remove the bowls and put them back later, this way maybe they will finish it and not leave it around on the floor. Don't blame yourself it's a challenging job :)"
cats,fd2dsbc,t1_fd262o6,1578145767.0,"Cats tend to eat the stupidest stuff they found around in the house, mine ate a needle but we caught her on time did surgery and now she is a grumpy 15yo. Dog food can be poisonous to cats so you should be really careful of what they eat. Also household cleaning products, toilet paper(can obstruct their gut cause of cellulose) pencils, strings..."
cats,fd25mza,t3_ejv728,1578142061.0,Looks like poisoning from what you describe. Cats usually show signs of discomfort so his death circumstances are pretty strange. Are you sure the cat didn't eat something it shouldn't have eaten? I am really sorry for you loss
