fatlogic,fd8qd5n,t1_fd8mbfg,1578221811.0,"Some people go to the ICU for conditions entirely outside of their control. Some go for conditions within their control. Too many people go. The beds are prioritized by need. Sometimes that means that people die for conditions outside their control because they were deemed to need the bed less than someone with a condition in their control.  We cannot change someone’s behavior to prevent them from needing the icu for a condition outside their control. We can and should change the behavior of people who are likely to need an icu unless their behavior changes to save not only their lives, but potentially other lives. What about this is fat phobic? What about this is too convoluted to grasp?"
fatlogic,fd8o4us,t1_fd8mbfg,1578220791.0,"You are either not listening or you’re an idiot. I’m not saying that they shouldn’t get medical care. I’m saying that they could have prevented their burden on the medical system. Yes her condition was more stable than it was before, but the decision to transfer her wasn’t made in a vacuum. Other people needed the bed MORE, it wasn’t that she didn’t need the bed at all.
It is extremely immoral for people to not care about how their choices affect society. It’s unfortunate it affected my brother? A fucking child died to make room for people who could’ve avoided the ICU by making healthier choices.
Yeah, you clearly are done thinking."
fatlogic,fd8gt7k,t1_fd8b1uq,1578218194.0,"Almost 2/3rds of americans are overweight or obese. The following is a 100% true story. My twin brother used to work in an ICU that was flooded with obese people and often didn’t have enough beds.  People so obese that one petite female surgeon couldn’t operate on many of them because her arms were too short. The condition of a little girl who was in the ICU for months stabilized and they moved her out of the ICU. She almost immediately died because she didn’t have the monitoring she would have had in the ICU. This event helped drive my twin brother to have a drinking problem to cope with the trauma of his job.
I don’t care if “we don’t consider it a problem.” It’s a real problem. And it’s a bigger problem than the ones you listed. Obesity causes cancer. People should be less selfish and recognize how their bad choices affect society. We’ve done this before. People talk about the costs of smoking. Smoking was banned from most public places. People talk about the healthcare costs of obesity. We SHOULD talk about how obesity kills not just the obese, but other people competing for our overtaxed healthcare services. Fuck this widespread western mindset that individual choices aren’t the business of the society they affect. We talk about how people’s pollution affects the climate. We talk about how people’s consumption taxes the environment as well as our waste disposal systems. We NEED to talk about how people’s choices lead to preventable overuse of our medical system. Perhaps in Sweden your medical system isn’t so bad. But in many parts of the U.S. it’s a shit show."

fatlogic,fd80i2e,t3_ek7wt9,1578212460.0,"I loathe the phrase “eat intuitively.” If you’re obese, clearly your “intuition” has led you astray.

fatlogic,fd7xzmw,t1_fd7xcbt,1578211699.0,"It’s literally just the stupidity of masses. In the United States about 1 in 3 people are overweight and 1 in 3 are obese. So they’re a super majority, it’s no surprise that they then post hoc rationalize that obesity is great and push fat acceptance and even encourage obese lifestyles. It’s frustrating to see. I was obese just a couple years ago, but I’ve lost 65 pounds and am no on the high end of the normal weight range. Being obese sucked. How do these people deluded themselves? At 235 pounds, 5’ 10” and male, I had sleep apnea, pre high blood pressure, and plantar fasciitis."

But so much is so unhealthy (donuts, 600 calorie coffee, fruit punch) and there’s just so much food. And most of the comments are supporting her choices. It’s not kindness to over feed your pets anymore than it’s kindness to encourage people to eat themselves to death"
fatlogic,fd7si4o,t1_fd7qagy,1578209411.0,"Why isn’t that productive? Maybe you wouldn’t say that face to face to most people, because they can’t handle it, but in something like a commercial for obesity awareness? Many articles discuss how many billions a year obesity costs the U.S. Why not also talk about how it puts a strain on a clearly strained healthcare system, and that definitely harms other people. 
You’re talking about using motivations that people already have. How is that productive? People don’t know what they don’t know. Telling them proactively could make a difference."

fatlogic,fd7gbby,t1_fd7fsbp,1578204041.0,"It might motivate people. I think that people should consider how it affects other people when they make a choice to be obese. People who are uninformed or trying but failing aren’t immoral, but educating people about how obesity affects others should be part of reducing ignorance. Studies show that showing people how obesity harms them motivates them to lose weight. Why wouldn’t the same be true for showing people how it harms others? People are told it’s wrong to smoke while pregnant, or in the house with kids. The same is true with obesity."
fatlogic,fd71vhc,t3_ej6554,1578198415.0,"Yeah, just give me back sleep apnea, plantar fasciitis, and pre high blood pressure, and take away my fitness so I’m not rewarded for my weight loss."
fatlogic,fd6lb8m,t3_ejxofg,1578192688.0,"This might be off topic, but I have a question. Isn’t saying that obesity isn’t a moral issue fatlogic? 
At least to the extent that someone is at best apathetic about their weight, in many situations? Think of all the harms to *others* obesity causes. Obesity strains medical resources, making getting a doctor’s appointment more difficult for others. Obesity leads to early death, potentially leaving tour children without a parent. You have a moral responsibility to take care of your children. Obesity is a social disease, meaning obesity encourages obesity in others, which is why obesity hot pockets exist. So obesity inherently is a bad influence. Obesity during pregnancy can cause problems in the fetus. People like to think their choices exist in a vacuum, but they don’t.
Again, I don’t think obesity is immoral when it’s entirely unintentional, but for many people it is intentional."
fatlogic,fd6hggp,t1_fcqxisb,1578191077.0,"Yeah, I think choosing obesity can be immoral."
fatlogic,fd6hdgd,t3_eigs8m,1578191041.0,"I mean, there’s a good argument that choosing obesity is selfishly immoral. It strains our healthcare resources. If you die or are crippled and you have children, you may fail your responsibilities to your children. If your obesity results in disability it may strain resources for other disabled people. That’s an immoral choice. Also, obesity is a social disease, which spreads socially, resulting in hot pockets of obesity. So being obese helps normalize and encourage obesity, which harms other people. That’s arguably immoral. Obesity while pregnant can harm your child. That’s immoral, like smoking while pregnant."
fatlogic,fd6fhko,t3_ejj6oh,1578190186.0,"When I lost 65 pounds I appreciated genuine congratulatory remarks, which were rare. Most people say nothing. Some people mock my dedication to eating healthy foods.

Edit: people are talking about “what if it’s an eating disorder.” And what if, as it was in my case, it’s not a secret that I was trying to lose weight?"
fatlogic,fd6dopm,t3_ek3xg6,1578189391.0,Why do these people insist on making obesity - a legitimate health problem - an entirely aesthetic problem?

fatlogic,fd5vsjw,t1_fd5ociw,1578182113.0,"There’s an old video of a very fat woman showing what she eats in a day, an amount she asserts is less than the average person. It included a 600 calorie Starbucks coffee, the largest lunch I’ve ever seen, and two burritos and a glass of fruit punch for dinner. Just insane. People calculated it to about 2500-3000 calories, but she wouldn’t hear it."
fatlogic,fd4pbwq,t3_ejyo7h,1578169714.0,"This isn’t even useful. The problem is people don’t know what eating “adequately” looks like. And she doesn’t explain it at all. If you’re overweight you probably aren’t eating the right foods. And if you don’t then change what foods you eat, you will continue to be an unhealthy weight. How does someone lose weight without changing their diet? Exercise ain’t gonna do it."
fatlogic,fd4mw78,t1_fd3f8lu,1578169037.0,"And that kind of stuff is misinformation based on a single trial in the article 1950s. Just in my own family, my cousin was obese as a kid, and lost the weight and coached cross country. My older brother was obese as a kid and young adult and hasn’t been overweight in years. I was obese a few years ago, and now I’m borderline no longer overweight. I’ve been around 170 pounds for a year now, and working on losing more weight. Weight loss diets can easily work long term with enough dedication and smart choices, but they won’t work if you keep telling people it’s futile."
fatlogic,fd4mh8k,t1_fd2nhsb,1578168893.0,"Exactly! Meanness tends not to be very persuasive. But people need to be informed and encouraged to make better choices, and they need support. Telling people being fat is fine is misinformation. It’s at least as bad as yelling at someone for being fat."

fatlogic,fd4lfbq,t1_fd3gnxh,1578168625.0,"The thing is, it is real. But it’s a common tactic to use something that is a real, but uncommon or rare cause, and use it to justify every instance of occurrence. That’s what people do here. Obesity and high blood pressure run in my family, and there may be genetics at play. But also my family just makes incredibly poor health choices."
fatlogic,fcz8jt6,t3_ejgni9,1578095839.0,"I just discovered this sub and have stuff to rant about. A few years ago I weighed 235 pounds. I’m 5’ 10” and male. I developed sleep apnea, my feet hurt all the time, my blood pressure was just shy of being high (upper 130s over upper 80s) and being fat just sucked. So I dieted and lost over 65 pounds. For all the talk of people fat shaming, which I experienced all of one time ever, people really really don’t want you to diet. It’s clearly the bigger problem. For example, I went out to dinner with my wife and in-laws for my mother in law’s birthday. I got a hamburger and a side of broccoli with water. My mother in law is usually a nice person, but she pressured me to have an appetizer, and to have a dessert, and told me it was okay to eat more because it was a special occasion. I refused. I wasn’t going to have 1000 calories of ice cream and cake at a restaurant just because it was her birthday. My wife is considerate of my ongoing attempts to improve my fitness and weight (I’m 169 on a good morning now, but depending on clothing, time of day, or day of the week I’m still just barely overweight). But since it’s the holidays people are flooding me with cookies and chocolate and candy. What on earth do I need 20 sugar cookies for?! Trashed. A few months ago my in-laws came over and ordered Chinese food. I asked for food from their healthy menu. Steamed chicken and veggies. They spent the whole time making fun of my food and asserting it must taste awful - it didn’t. And if you have guests over and are trying to order food that everyone wants, people who only eat junk will demand something like pizza. You can’t get baked chicken for everyone. It’s easy to see how someone less determined to lose weight would fail to lose it or keep it off with all these obese people asking them to eat poorly. How has it become so okay to encourage poor choices? End rant."
fatlogic,fcz7bem,t3_ejfiw4,1578095128.0,"This stat isn’t even true. It’s based on a 1950’s study of people who were put on diets by doctors. There isn’t any real data on the success rate of people who impose diets on themselves. The thing is, everyone I know who has taken dieting seriously has lost weight and kept it off. My older brother used to weigh around 250 pounds as a teenager and young adult and hasn’t been overweight in years now. My cousin was obese as a kid and ended up coaching cross country. I was 235 pounds a few years ago, and I stopped to 170ish last year and am now working on losing more weight. You just have to believe it will work, and figure out what works for you. But they’re undermining people’s beliefs in the system so that they won’t put in the effort."
