lotrmemes,few1h7m,t1_fev93ne,1579404127.0,"I don't mean to imply that anyone can be perfectly objective but a good reviewer should acknowledge their biases. And a review where one is attempting to be objective in describing a movie's faults and virtues doesn't become a product description, it still requires a personal touch inspired by experience and preference.

I also don't know where you got the idea that I think that everyone who enjoys fantasy must enjoy the Lord of the Rings. But if you're going to go out as a reviewer and say that the Fellowship of the Ring is a bad movie (which apparently 9% of reviewers did), I'm skeptical of their ability to determine what a well-made movie looks like. I think an important skill for reviewers is realizing a movie is good regardless of whether or not you are the target audience."

lotrmemes,fetfv65,t1_fetcfxe,1579375064.0,What I was trying to get at was that any problem people could have about the films would be issues that they have with the genre of fantasy as a whole
lotrmemes,fesz0r2,t1_fesvi6f,1579370329.0,"Exactly, if any critic has a valid criticism of the movies it would be symptomatic of the fantasy genre as a whole. Critics should be able to review a movie based on what they are trying to do and how successful they are at it while excluding their personal preferences."

indieheads,fdl7n4y,t1_fdgy8py,1578518431.0,I saw Alvvays at Desert Daze in October and they played a new song. Maybe they'll put it out as a single or maybe an album is coming?
listentothis,fdktugc,t3_elsr6w,1578511036.0,"Have you listened to Gece by Altin Gün? If you're a fan of world music I'm sure you'll enjoy it. I consider it a big step up from their first album and that's saying something since that one was still fantastic, they do a great blend of Turkish Folk, funk, and psychedelia"

todayilearned,fcxjgg4,t1_fcxj1am,1578064435.0,I thought you were talking about being dropped off by someone else's car. If you own the car I'm sure you could decide when you want it to go around picking people up to give you some leeway. Also it wouldn't be a requirement to put your car in that mode. You could still choose to park it.

It's a shame if Gladwell sucks since I love listening to him talk. He's a very insightful and eloquent guy."

For context I'm by no means a cinephile but I'd rate it about a 7. I really enjoyed the experience of seeing it even if it hasn't really stuck with me."

INEEEEDIT,fb9ci4f,t1_fb8v3kb,1576635034.0,Downtown at the bottom of the stairs with all the memorials there's a list of everyone from the town that was killed during World War 1. At the bottom of the list it says 'Colored' and lists two names under it.
