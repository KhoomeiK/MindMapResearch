AskReddit,ffczgti,t1_ffby2ti,1579810436.0,"That’s a nice story, considering I experienced the same thing. I was with my boyfriend for about six months and then he started telling me he loved me. I was 23 when we first got together and no one had really been affectionate to me so I didn’t know how to react. Plus, the words scared me. But I did everything for him, because my signs of affection are based on actions, rather than words. I had dinner made when he was done with classes. I did his laundry when he was busy. I drew him little pictures. Stuff like that.

One night, we were laying together and he got extremely emotional. He asked me if I was happy with him and that he feared I didn’t like him. We talked about it and I told him that words had always been meaningless to me. I saw people lie to each other every day, so what was meaningful to me was what someone did. I later found out about the different love languages and learned that we could both meet each other halfway. But it’s always a learning experience."

AskReddit,ffcfdxy,t1_ffc7xm4,1579798274.0,"Similarly, I let my brother stay with me for 6 months after he got into a fight with our parents that resulted in them kicking him out. (Long story short: He threatened to harm my parents and they didn’t feel safe.) My brother is bipolar and schizophrenic. I tried to be patient and help him. I took him to as many appointments as we could. I helped him find a job. But, at point, he refuses to help himself and it was no longer worth helping him.

He would insult me. He would steal from me. He couldn’t keep a job. He began freeloading and feeling entitled to the things I bought for myself. I did everything I could to help his mental health, but after you’re 18, if you choose that you don’t want to seek help, that’s that. A friend offered to let him stay with him and I drove him two hours away to get him out of my house.

It’s heartbreaking how many people are homeless due to mental illness, but after that experience, I had a better understanding why. I have my life to live, and I wasn’t going to house someone who refused to help themselves. Not only did it strain me financially, but it put a strain on my employment and on my own mental health.

I’m not saying this is the other person’s situation, but I feel like what I went through was similar to yours."
cscareerquestions,ffcb0ue,t3_est9wj,1579795558.0,"Your story and everyone else’s reminds me of one of my friend’s. He was amazingly smart and kind. I couldn’t have been luckier to work alongside a guy like him during my first job out of college.

He was more of a manager to me than my actual manager was. He was self sufficient and incredibly productive. After he had his first child, me and another coworker noticed how much he was working and how he really shouldn’t have been giving them all of those hours when we knew he wanted to be home with his wife and child more often. Over the course of a year, we spoke with him and often told him how much he deserved more money and more vacation. He would modestly nod and laugh.

When he was about to have his second child, he was upfront with me and our other coworker/friend. He was going to spend his paternity leave applying for new jobs. We were so happy. Less than a month that he came back from paternity leave, I was let go due to downsizing. He and I had lunch together a week later and he began telling me how he was frantically interviewing with the places he was talking about. He told me that he was an idiot for thinking that loyalty meant anything, especially when they were willing to let me go so easily and throw the rest of the team under the bus with the work I needed to finish. He told me that they didn’t respect me and they didn’t respect the rest of the team and he hated that he spent so much time waiting to apply for a new job. After he gave his two weeks, he told me how they desperately offered him more money and then began to threaten his “reputation” by job hopping. (He had been at the company for 8 years, I had been there for 5)

After he left, our other coworker/friend told us about how the managers blamed him leaving for how over allocated they were, because they had my friend doing at least two other men’s jobs. 

This whole experience was learning how meaningless loyalty is in a business setting. Of course, many people learn the hard way, but it’s easy to want to tell yourself to wait until a better time as a way to disguise the loyalty excuse. It’s not fun."
dogs,ffc6v94,t3_esp4ip,1579792909.0,"The reason your lab may be doing this with your daughter instead of your gf is because your lab has probably observed that the child plays more rough/dangerously than your gf, because kids generally do, and connecting the dots, the dog may be trying to protect the puppy from her.

Like the others said, be sure to train with positive reinforcement. Separate the lab if she shows any sort of nipping or showing of her teeth. Remove her from the situation and do something along the lines of isolating her from the ""problem"" for 30-60 seconds. When you reintroduce her to the situation, reward her with praise, pets and treats for remaining calm and friendly. 

I don't know the age of your daughter, but if she is old enough to sort of reason with, try and place the importance of being gentle with dogs. Remind her that pulling and rough pets aren't enjoyable to the dog, and the dogs will be her best friends if she makes them happy with kind, gentle play. Obviously, I don't know the full history between your lab and your daughter, but I do know that some children can make animals aggressive due to their roughness and it could possibly be a cause of this issue."
cscareerquestions,ff9u6kt,t3_esgnql,1579721400.0,"Overall, my advice to you is to do freelancing work while working at your internship.

So, the answer is that your idea is a bad one. Think of it this way: Would you trust someone to build a shed in your backyard if they said they had minimal work experience and if they had nothing to show you that they had built sheds before? Why would you hire that person when you can hire someone else who has been building sheds for a decade and has it down to an art? Sure, the inexperienced person is cheaper, but what do you expect out of the quality of a project?

The main concern with your idea is that there is very little reason that anyone else would hire you over someone else. Freelancing is often built by first, showing off things you made on your own and then getting hired by small businesses or doing projects for charity organizations or open-source. Once you have a nicer portfolio, it's then that you can start supporting yourself financially through freelancing.

Until you can guarantee that you can support yourself through freelancing, I wouldn't recommend quitting your job. Not having steady income is stressful and I would say that it's not safe to quit your job until you are certain you can support yourself with other work."

AskReddit,ff9dnp7,t1_ff9d614,1579710733.0,"Same to you. It's not easy to go through and I can't imagine the frustration it's causing you. I know she had to find a remote job because it was getting to the point where she couldn't go into her office. Her job genuinely wants her to come back when she is doing better but she had to quit because she couldn't go into work. It's just a terrible thing. She even ended up being admitted to the psychiatric area in the hospital of an ER she visited because she passively mentioned how much being in pain made her want to just die. The therapists there encouraged her to keep seeing doctors and prioritize that over work, but she can't afford healthcare because she doesn't have a steady stream of income.

I hope you're doing okay, since I understand the struggle. We know that marijuana can help but she certainly doesn't see it as a solution. Plus, at the moment, it's also too expensive for her to seek as treatment."

I knew a body builder friend in college. He was absolutely gorgeous when I got the chance to just talk with him and hang out while we were in classes and stuff. Friended him on Facebook and he posted pictures of him at competitions.

todayilearned,ff6ue6k,t1_ff6d3sp,1579635081.0,"When Iron Man 1 first came out, I saw it and loved it. I tried to get my dad to come see it with me and, at first, he refused because he hated RDJ. He constantly talked about how he was a horrible, embarrassing addict and he didn't want to support any of his works. I eventually got him to come with me and my dad was pleasantly surprised by how much he liked RDJ in the movie, but I've always remembered his reaction as a statement to how people thought of RDJ before Iron Man. (I was graduating high school at the time so I didn't know of RDJ's history.)

I can't imagine anyone likes their mistakes being brought up over and over again. When you recover from an addiction, you want to leave it behind you. Can you imagine how much non-smokers like being reminded of all of the years they smoked? What RDJ did was clearly far worse and I'm sure he's happy to have recovered. Interviewers who keep bringing it up are idiotic. It's like asking someone how they are dealing with their mother who died ten years ago.

We all compare ourselves to the perfect versions we want to be, and we all wish we could be better, but everyone close to me would never be complimented by ""Your boobs look big and perky in that dress"" and ""Your ass looks huge in those jeans!""

Complimenting the full package, and the full person, is what helps their confidence, even for a few moments. ""Girl, you look gorgeous tonight!"" or ""You're smoking hot in that dress"" are ways that I could compliment my friends in similar ways without focusing on just their boobs and ass.

Everyone has different personalities and interests, but no one that I have been close to has ever wanted their boobs complimented.

cscareerquestions,ff3xqjj,t1_ff3w0xj,1579551152.0,"I only went to conferences after I graduated college. My college is a state school, so I would consider it normal/mediocre but maybe the one thing it did that other schools don't do as often is have a job fair. Not only did they have the job fair, but they made it required in one of the job prep courses (where you write resumes and practice interviewing skills) to attend at least one job fair.

And, the funny thing about all of this is that, if schools closer to the NYC and Bay area don't have job fairs, those schools are setting their students behind in terms of technical knowledge but in terms of soft skills. 

Perhaps another thing that puts me and my buddies ahead of others is the fact that I had to work my way through college. I know for a fact that having part time work looks much better on your resume and I'm always impressed to see how many people have never worked before graduating college. Or maybe envious is a better word, since I didn't have the option of not working through college. I am happy it put me at an advantage on my resume though.

It's really not all that difficult to get a job as an entry level person if you just make the goal of getting a job and not getting your dream job. Perhaps I am speaking in general terms, since the CS field is in a ton of demand and I know people with other degrees who haven't gotten the opportunity to even work in their field after five years of graduating. So I'm assuming it's all relative to that perspective, and that's where I am coming from. 6 months compared to five years is far better, clearly."

So both of us speaking personally have had various experiences. It's far from impossible to find a job in NYC as a recent grad. One of my good friends wanted to live and work in NYC and he now lives and works in NYC. His first job out of college was a consulting company.

dogs,ff3ujjq,t3_erhsqu,1579549157.0,"Everyone wants their pet to pass peacefully in their sleep but I have never been so lucky. Both of my childhood labs had to be taken to the vet and it was determined that it would be their last day because, one day, both of them just laid down and couldn’t get back up. Similarly, I had a pet cockatiel (bird) and during his last five years of life, he had seizures once or twice a week. One day, he had a seizure and it didn’t stop. After over an hour, I made the call because it was late at night and there were no signs of it slowing.

It’s not an easy call and there’s no right answer. Quality of life is generally determined by whether the dog walks, eats and goes potty easily. And there’s a huge difference between bad days and bad weeks.

The only people who can make those decisions are you and your spouse. You know your dog best. You know what his happiest and his worst looks like. And if you aren’t seeing any more happiness, not even once a week, I don’t think you are making a bad decision by saying it’s time. You know you love him and that he loves you. Take some time to think about it with your spouse after you get the doctor’s results back, but no matter what, you aren’t making a wrong decision.

We just went to Shenandoah back in September 2019. There were only the following restrictions: 1) Some campsites do not allow pets. 2) Some trails/hikes do not allow dogs. Overall, there are no limits on the amount of dogs or the breeds. You just need to keep control of your dog(s) and don't go where you aren't allowed.

We had a great time and I don't think we experienced any issues with our dogs while we were there. The biggest tourist attractions in the park do not allow dogs (Dark Hollow, Old Rag) but there's a ton of other trails and peaks to go to. 

There is plenty of information about whether or not a dog is allowed on a trail or area. I would suggest going to the National Park's site and download all of the trail PDFs onto your phone that they have available. They all have a ton of information. The information is available at all of the trail heads but it's nice to have it with you when you are out and about."

But complimenting the appearance of your dick and complimenting the appearance of one's breasts is the same as complimenting the way someone's kneecap looks.

If you want to feel complimented, that's a concern you want to communicate with your wife more. And the idea of her complimenting you on your manhood, both when it's soft and hard, might sound appealing, but I think you'll find that you want her to tell you how it makes her feel, and not how she likes how it looks."

Overall, most people don't feel complimented if you compliment something that they can't control. Eyes tend to be one of the few exceptions but I think it's because eyes show so much personality and emotions that they say so much about us.

Either way, unless you two are messing around, 9 times out of 10, a compliment to your SO's private parts will get you an unamused roll of the eyes. So the answer is, don't."

Just wanted to say, as a lady, stuff like this makes me laugh. If you look at finding a job the same way you say you find women, off the street, yeah, it's a numbers game.

Quickly, to answer your question, no, it's not difficult getting a junior position in the US unless you are in the extremely heavily populated areas. But, I would argue, even if you are in the Bay area or NYC, you can still find a job but that job may not be with Google or Twitter. I believe it's still easy to find a job but that job might be for some random paint company that only sells in 50 Lowes on the East Coast. But, guess what? That's a job. That's experience. That's income.

I graduated college 5 years ago. I am no where near the smartest person around. I found a job fairly easily. Almost everyone I know found a job before graduating or within a few months of graduating.

It's not a bad idea to look at job hunting sort of like dating. If you approach people with nothing to show for yourself except a bachelor's degree, no one is going to be interested. Cool, a college degree? That's the bare minimum of what people desire. That's what everyone has. It's like going up to a lady and being like, ""You're a girl. I'm a guy. Let's be together!"" 

So you make yourself more attractive by doing one of two things: 1) You get to know them/Socializing and social networking. Meetups. Organizations that work on what you care about. You talk to experienced folk through friends. And once you have that exposure, it's easier to talk to people. 2) You make yourself more attractive/Build your resume. Work on personal projects. Get experience in less luxurious jobs for the sake of income and real work experience so you can work your way to that dream job. With that stuff on your resume, you look far more desirable than the guy next to you.

It's partially a numbers game because of competition, but just like there is no ""one special person"" for everyone, there are plenty of opportunities for new grads. They might just have to look for more than what they believe is their dream job or dream gal.

As for experienced folk, if you can prove you know what you're talking about and you can communicate well, mid and senior level positions are arguably easier to find."

It's not that people are against you, it's just that people really only care about themselves. It's nothing malicious against you, but people really just care about making themselves happy. Of course, once we are with someone, we want to make the people we love happy. But sometimes, people are in a place in their life where they are just worried about themselves. 

And with how you reach out to people: I'm gonna mention my own story. I have only had one relationship in my life, and it started when I was 23. I spent my entire life prior being very social and having a good amount of friends. I've always felt like I could talk to nearly everyone. I'm not the prettiest girl but I'm average. And no one asked me out. Ever. Throughout my college career, I asked out four different guys and they all were kind, telling me they just didn't see me like that. Which is fine, I wouldn't want to force anyone to like me because that isn't liking me. I hit a point in my life where I had no friends, since they all graduated college and I was a semester behind. I tried online dating and I met my boyfriend. I could go into my entire background but this is long enough, so I'll just summarize it by saying that he has been the most patient and accepting person I've ever met. I know I'll spend the rest of my life with him.

I get that online dating leads to many failures, but so does trying in person. It's better to try and have a chance of success than not try at all. My friend's parents divorced and both remarried in their early 50s to someone they met online. Sometimes, it really is the only way that your personality type can reach out to others of your compatible personality type.

I can encourage you to ""go out there and meet new people"", but at the end of the day, having friendly dates with people you talk to online and have common interests with leads to more chemistry and better chances than just going to bars or church groups. I get it, everyone has what works for them, but based on what you said, I think that this kind of thing would really help you. I also get that it sucks that you have to sell yourself on a profile as if it is a resume, but again, it helps you find people you would otherwise never meet. My boyfriend and I lived 40 minutes away from each other and I honestly can't imagine myself meeting another man who would tolerate me so I feel lucky that I found him."

Labs are very food-motivated dogs so they will always act hungry. That's just the facts of life. 

Locking him up for his own safety is the only thing you can do when you are not present. I have a lab and a border collie mix. My lab mellowed out around 1 year old and I could leave him out without issues. I adopted my mix and I found she would chew on plastic cases when I wasn't present. She showed no other signs of separation anxiety except for chewing on plastic, and I found the plastic chewed up with blood on it. I've had the second dog for three years now and the dogs get locked up when I'm not home. I'd rather have a bored dog than an injured or hospitalized dog.

What is your daily activity with your lab? If he's an American/Field line lab, those labs were bred to be more active hunting dogs than their English/Show line counterparts. You should be walking him and playing with him. On days where you can't dedicate an hour or so to time with him, still dedicate physical activity time with him but also have him mentally stimulated with treat dispensing toys. My dogs enjoy [this one](https://www.chewy.com/kong-wobbler-dog-toy-large/dp/44195) and you can fit over a cup of food in it.

To keep him busy while you are relaxing, try giving him treats like 12 inch bully sticks or antlers. I have found that treats like these keep my dogs engaged because, unlike Nylabones, they can be worn away and consumed. (Antlers don't cause issues when consumed if he's just grinding away at it, but watch out for chunks he can swallow whole. At that point, they need to be thrown away.)

Hopefully those ideas help you out. Your only solutions are training, activity and crating. Until you can make progress with training, which takes time like learning anything will, you just have to deal with feeling bad so he can live a long, healthy life."

For years, I've seen discussions on this sub about how uneducated people can be and how trends can be dangerous. You're absolutely correct, the media reinforces these bad trends, and social media only makes those bad messages louder. 

A great example is the doodle trend. Everything people want in a doodle is achievable from simply getting a standard poodle, but people are turned away from poodles because the media taught them that poodles are stuffy-attitude dogs that only look like poodles they see with the show cut. And now I keep seeing Great Pry/Poodle mixes, Bernese Mountain Dog/Poodle Mixes and all of these other breeds that just produce offspring with no desirable traits outside of curly ""hypoallergenic"" coat.

I know there are dozens of more examples. /r/aww is hard to read through because the general public tends to not be incredibly educated. I've seen so many people fawn over double merles and it breaks my heart.

So, I imagine you think men with black hair all look the same, which is why Sylas, Aphelios and Kayn look the same. But they don't. Sure, maybe in the art, Kayn and Silas, being shirtless white males with long black hair, look kind of similar. But then there's the fact that Kayn walks around with a scythe while Silas has no weapon carried in his hands, so their appearances are totally different while actually playing the game.

I don't think you are wrong in saying that there needs to be more diversity in hair style, perhaps. But saying that Sett, Sylas and Kayn all look the same because they are athletically built white males tells me you think that every white, busty female such as MF, Ashe, Kai Sa, Lux and Syndra looks the same.

Kayn was released over two years ago. Sylas was released one year ago. Look at the releases between them. There's a good amount of diversity in champs. Hell, they are probably sticking with the black haired theme because there weren't black haired males in the game prior to Kayn because all of the males looked like Draven, J4, Garen and Graves."

Pretty much this, yes. A problem I see with blog/portfolio sites is that, while they are great, they don't serve a need. Employment is serving a need. Customer interaction is serving a need. 

It is the reason some people graduate college with great grades and cannot find a job. Unless you can start your own startup and succeed, you will always be serving someone else's need. That means putting others first. It means interacting with others. It means not only focusing on yourself. For example, I see some college students here ask what to put on their resume if they have no hourly job experience and the only thing I can tell them is volunteering or student organizations. People want to see that you are a part of something.

Having that extra work makes you way more appealing. If a company were to see that you had an internship AND personal projects/open-source work, your resume would help you be among the first called.

It might not be important that it's paid but it's important that it's publicly available or done for someone else. Having things on your resume like, ""Launched new site for local humane society"" or ""Released fitness app on app store with 300 downloads"" speak much more highly of you than something like ""Created portfolio site to share love of cars""

I think, in your case, a Masters would probably help. I'm in the web development world, so Masters don't matter here but when it comes to numbers and math, I think it matters a lot more. I can't offer a ton of input on that but I think you are on the right track there.

I think the one exception to this is if the projects you work on are huge, recognizable names.

If you are unable to obtain an internship, my recommendation would be to gain real world experience elsewhere by freelancing remotely or for local businesses. At that point, if you are making income from your projects, you have real world experience. You reported your changes to a stakeholder who approved of your work or requested rework until they were happy with the finished product. That’s what would speak just as loudly as an internship.

cscareerquestions,fegpdcv,t3_eozrgw,1579099368.0,"Because I am not familiar with your colleges, you are going to have to do your research. But I would suggest staying in community college for as long as possible because tuition is so much cheaper. The hard part for you is making sure those credits transfer to an equivalent class and credit at the college you are aiming for. I know people who took Calc II at a community college and got sat next to my uneducated ass in Precalc after they transferred because Calc II at their community college didn't equate to the Calc II at my college. (The good news about that is that it makes their semester a breeze since they are retaking a class they've already taken.)

If you are concerned about money, here is what I recommend. Apply for as many scholarships as you can. Just apply for any that you qualify even slightly for. And with FAFSA time coming up, search for whatever financial aid you can. Unfortunately, a large portion of what you get depends on your parents.

If you can, do not live in the dorms. They cost SO MUCH MONEY. I know that missing out on the dorm experience is a little bit of a bummer, but nearly everyone I know who commuted to college has their loans paid off after 5 years. (I am 5 years out of college, btw.) If you cannot commute while living with your parents, search for an affordable apartment near campus. There are many, many people looking for roommates. As long as you communicate like a normal human being, you can tolerate living with 99% of people until a year lease is up.

Also, work part time if you can. It vastly improves your resume while you can support yourself/have extra change in your pocket.

As for what you need to study, it's entirely up to you. What field are you aiming for related to Computer Science? If you want to do web work, HTML, CSS and JS are what you need to start with. If you want to do game development, start with Unity. If you want to develop mobile apps, I think Unity is the easiest starting place as well."

Which, after my current buddy passes, I've told myself I should get a yellow because my childhood dogs were black labs and my current lab is my entire world.

As for the popularity of ""gray and silver"" labs, they are seen as unique and desirable to people who get dogs to show off what they've got. There's plenty of evidence that show that any ""silver"" lab (which includes any sort of coat name such as charcoal, grey and champagne labs) are Weimaraners dog mixes. Those coats are not natural to the labrador retriever breed, and thanks due to the fact that both labs and Weimaraners are both hunting breeds, some people can't tell the differences in breed. (Plus, shelters in the US like to label any dog that's 50+ lbs with floppy ears a ""lab mix"" so many people don't question it.)

The silver lab trend is similar to the doodle trend. I am seeing Saint Bernard/Poodle mixes, Great Pyr/Poodle mixes and Bernese Mountain Dog/Poodle mixes. The doodle trend is ridiculous because a standard poodle offers everything that people want from a doodle. So why would anyone want to mix a giant dog breed with a poodle? The name. Same with the silver labs.

Anyway, to wrap up my rambling, owners who purely seek a dog based on the color of a coat aren't making good judgements. To add to these trends, there's the double merle trend, which often produces offspring that is blind and deaf because the traits are recessive. Anyone who supports this kind of dog breeding isn't educated.

HOWEVER, I will say that I still enjoy the movie, but I enjoy it for three reasons:

2) The ending of the movie genuinely made me cry. I think they portrayed grief and loss in a way that very little movies do. Similarly to the Seymour episode of Futurama, Peter waiting in front of her gravestone for seasons was both beautiful and soul crushing.

Thank goodness I was working from home when I got this because I had a breakdown and started crying at my desk from fear. I had been so worn down at my other job from working day in and day out to appease an awful manager. He never cared about what I did. He cared about what I hadn't done yet. I had my lunch with my director and, guess what? Things are fine. But I definitely have a little bit of PTSD from my old job.

My parents refused to give me any financial support. This helped me A TON because, although my grades weren't the greatest, they saw that I had been working part time through college, which spoke to my work ethic.

So, your thing about not wanting a job you don't hate and liking people you work with? Sometimes you don't get that option. Sometimes, you have to work somewhere you fucking hate just so you can afford to pay bills. 

And if you don't need to support yourself financially, there are other things you can do to look like work experience that aren't quite work. Number 1 thing you can do is volunteer somewhere. Nursing home, homeless shelter, pet shelter, student tutor. Along these lines, become a part of something at your university. Something related to CS is ideal. Being part of the student administration for your student CS org is great, but you can do other things that you're passionate about. Movie club. Skiing club. Gaming club.

Work experience shows that you do something else other than sit at your desk in your down on your computer. Technical skills matter but soft skills matter too. Working for a business means working with and for other people. Employers want to see that you will treat others around you kindly and communicate well, because you'll be doing that just as often as you will be coding.

Quick edit: ALSO, a thing that some people don't understand is that sometimes, if you can't find a job out of college, you can still get a tech related job and work that until you can find a development related job.

As for your comment about the US bringing tech people over, that is related to two things: Lowest bid and more experience. Offshore developers are often hired because they're cheaper than people in the US. Plus, those developers have more exposure to whatever they are working with than grads out of college.

It's great that you've considered seeking help, but from my experience, therapists and psychiatrists just give you what you feel you need (a listening ear and prescriptions, respectively) but they fully expect you to tackle your own problems once you are an adult. They help, but they are purely assistance, not the solution. 

Overall, it sounds like you've found something that works for you and if it works, it works! It's funny because I find everyone distracting in an office environment but I also find it motivating. I can't get distracted and play an hour of games or something like that. I also like being away from home because, frankly, I don't have many friends. I'm ""work friends"" with people at my work and that contact alone gives me the satisfaction that I'm not isolated.

But this is purely how I think. Some people don't think like me and they do better at home! By your logic, it kind of makes me feel like a lot of people would find it concerning that I need a night or two away from my SO to just be me in my hobby room and paint or sew, but it's just my own solution to wanting that kind of isolation. I don't think I REALLY need professional help with that because no one is going to change how I feel and my coping with those feelings is healthy. So is yours."

You seem confused on what a game is. A game is participating in something where the goal is to win. Competency is ""Having the necessary ability, knowledge, or skill to do something successfully"". Thus, a skill floor is what it takes to play a game competently. For you, ""at a basic level"" should mean to play competently. What do you define playing a game at a basic level? What do you believe the goal of learning a game is?

A skill ceiling is how GOOD you can be at the game, which is why pro players are literally and metaphorically at the top. A skill floor isn't just how little a person needs to do to turn the game on.

Quick edit about the above statement: It's common but look at how many of your coworkers have big guts. Again, not healthy.

I found that moving to a new company in a new area allowed myself to be refreshed. A couple of arguments in favor of this:

1)	You have 8 years of experience. The entry level market is oversaturated but I don’t have a doubt in my mind you could find somewhere new.

2)	Can’t move out of the area? That’s fine, just look for a job a little bit further than where your current one is. If you have a short commute, I know moving to a commute that’s 40 minutes sucks, but it will take you to a job that you don’t hate.

3)	A healthy company will give you flexibility and vacation time. You’ve said it already, you’re okay with moving down positions or just leaving the industry. You don’t have to leave the industry to have a better quality of life, just leave the places that expect you to live, breathe and eat code. Both companies I work at are not recognizable names. I make the average amount for a developer in my area. I can work from home when I want. I have flexible hours and a good amount of vacation. My work expects me to get my work done and be present for conversations when an important meeting is happening. Otherwise, I can do what I want. The guys around me have wives and children. You think they give a shit about working more than 40 hours a week? Of course they don’t. They work the bare minimum so they can be with their family. 

Once I realized this, I started having the mentality of acting like I had a big family to return to in the evening, but though I was just going home to my boyfriend, working out, taking care of my dogs or partaking in my hobbies.

4)	You already have some non-computer related hobbies, which is great. Keep doing them. Use it as motivation to find somewhere with more flexible hours.

5)	The company has no loyalty to you. You work for them. You may feel guilty leaving it all behind, but it’s time to take care of yourself.


Tl;dr – If you don’t want to leave the industry, seek out a company that isn’t a big name in the tech world. These companies still pay well and often offer better lifestyles because they’re not obsessed with the rat race of tech success. They’re just running their business.

PLUS, if you really want a break, when you find a new job, give yourself a couple of weeks in between leaving your current job and your new job. Unpaid vacation, yeah, but I’m sure you’ll get the same/more money by going to a new company.

Or switch industries if you’d like. But, having been in your shoes, a new job where I wasn’t expected to carry the weight of the world on my shoulders was great. Unfortunately, it seems to be what companies do to people who stay more than 3 years. It’s up to you to decide when enough is enough. Good luck with whatever you choose!"
