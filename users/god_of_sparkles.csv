I also highly doubt Thor grabbed Mjolnir for Cap. He did quite literally say ""I'm still worthy"" when it came to him, but since you're not much one for the lines in the movie I would also point out that he never offered it up in any way.

He was fat, full of self hatred and doubt, and wasted no time suggesting they walk straight into whatever trap was waiting and kill him properly. Then calls in 2 weapons and goes to work. 

Sometimes you aren’t your best. And you don’t want to work. Maybe because of loss. Maybe something else. But people who have a good heart will always do what they can when it matters. He couldn’t have snapped everyone back, but he wanted to. And when someone else did that the right way, he was more than willing to die fighting to protect it.

nfl,fe3r3cv,t1_fe3n20s,1578852058.0,"Well, since Henry played one less game this year than he did last year and still put up 500 more yards, 4 more TDs and was first team All-Pro for the first time ever I don’t think even Derrick himself would claim that he’s the single reason for the success of the team. Are you forgetting that Henry has been in the league for 4 years or are you just ignoring that fact because it goes against your argument? 

It’s almost like he has an improved QB that has helped him face better fronts and provided more opportunities late in the game for him to do his best work. Henry had about 27 yards yesterday at the time of the Titans going up 14-0."
nfl,fe3mmm6,t1_fe34x6x,1578850677.0,"No flair and throwing out the same stat that was beat to death on the broadcast yesterday? Surely this isn’t someone just trying to sound smart without any real knowledge. 

Perhaps we should bring up that Tannehill finished 10th in total QBR for the regular season, above Cousins, Jimmy G, Brady, Rodgers, and well above the QB he was meant to backup all year. He took the Titans from being on no-one’s radar to taking down the two most feared teams on the AFC side of the playoffs (Pats at home simply don’t lose, but I’m sure the KC fans will start arguing with me here anyways). 

He also put up 22 TDs and 6 picks. He had the 3rd highest completion percentage in the league, .1% behind Carr and with Brees at the top. Those 22 TD would have him ranked at 16, and all but 1 of the 15 above him played more games. He has 3 game winning drives, which is 25% of the games he played in. 

But sure, he’s just mooching off of the Titans powerhouse roster that doesn’t need him at all."

politics,fe3hms9,t1_fe2ty8f,1578849356.0,I would say more ego than poor judgement from the judge. It’s not like anyone was questioning if 10 days in jail was over the top - there’s no way to argue it isn’t. This was a “statement” to remind everyone how much power judges have.
sports,fe3h5kd,t1_fe2qfzn,1578849219.0,"That circumstances have lead her to drop the country she dedicated her life to representing through athletics? With the worlds biggest stage just around the corner? 

I get that you support her reasoning, but just calling this incredibly difficult decision “good” isn’t something I agree with. I find it incredibly sad that she got to that point."
