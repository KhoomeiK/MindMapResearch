I had a table 2 days ago with 32 sides of ranch between 7 people. I'm pretty sure I have diabetes-by-contact now.

Then again these are the same folks that want their non-breaded wings extra crispy and tossed in sauce. Even after explaining to them the only way we can do that is no sauce and they'd need to dip it themselves as needed, they'll send the wings back because they aren't crispy because they're covered in a viscous liquid."
