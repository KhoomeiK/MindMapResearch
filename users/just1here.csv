The science is that iron leaches from the cookware into the food, dramatically increasing any food‚Äôs iron content. My first test, I was borderline anemic & doc said we‚Äôll test again next time & put you on pills if needed. Meanwhile, I researched what I could do. Yea, yea, the list of iron rich foods, that‚Äôs a start. I found a study ‚Äî and I‚Äôm making up the numbers but the point was it was THIS dramatic an increase:  spaghetti sauce in regular cookware was 3 mg/whatever measurement but prepped in cast iron the same amount skyrocketed to 87 mg/whatever. As I said, 16 years ago so I can‚Äôt link to an article or remember precisely. We already had one cast iron pan, so I choose to cook a hamburger 2 times a week. That was enough iron for my body & avoid pills. Remember I was measuring borderline to start with. If you‚Äôre quite low, you could cook everything you can in it.   Hope this helps!  Good luck.
