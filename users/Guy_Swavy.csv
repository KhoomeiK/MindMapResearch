lonely,ffaapqy,t1_ff9k7vq,1579731201.0,"In American Politics, some guy running for President named Andrew Yang periodically mentions how men and women cope with idleness differently. Men, as you said, tend to further isolate themselves thru activities such as video games or drug use, whereas women are more prone to actually being more productive. This was particularly in reference to how they deal with losing their job/unemployment: Unfortunately, I don’t have any sources but if you look up Andrew Yang and his appeal to certain groups of men you may find it."

depression,fen8yzq,t3_epydpj,1579279573.0,"Well, this probably doesn’t help. I felt the complete opposite when I came across Andrew Yang mid-2019. I even claim sometimes that Yang’s candidacy uprooted me from any suicidal/depressing thought’s I’ve had or at the very least postponed them for the time being. I’ve been actively following ever since and although I’ve inly engaged online, Yang supporters are as inclusive as they are a wholesome group to be a part of. The campaign has had it’s ups and downs but it also gives me something to look forward to and a message I’ll always stand behind, win or lose (though I’m completely confident he’ll win despite what it may seem like now). If you don’t mind me asking, who is you’re preferred candidate?"

Why is it that there’s so much nit-picking when it comes to what a measly 10% VAT to apply to (that imo has been given more than enough of an idea of what it’s applied to) but not the same attention to detail when Bernie says there will be jobs. What jobs exactly? Jobs for who? How will it be financed? I find these issues much more pressing than listing every item exempt and non-exempt of a 10% tax, especially when the payout is $1k/mo.

However, you’re making it seem as if we already have a single-payer system in place, when we do not. Any version of M4A, whether Public or single, is adding value to our current system to varying degrees. Only one of these options though is likely to succeed in a way that doesn’t largely disrupt the economy or leave people rightfully indignant. I’ll let you take a guess as to which one that is."
PresidentialRaceMemes,fd7gy9a,t1_fd7gfdn,1578204342.0,Damn. I was hoping you could at least appreciate the message he offers but its completely fine.

PresidentialRaceMemes,fd7gaf3,t1_fd7dwai,1578204029.0,"I hope you’re wrong but only time will tell. In reference to what I initially said regarding Yang’s policies, I worded that weirdly but I didn’t mean it like that, just replace other candidates with voters if that helps at all. It’s eye-opening when you hear about a lot of what Yang talks about, at least for me it was. If you haven’t already or if you have the time, I suggest you take a look into one of Yang’s long-form videos just to get an idea as to why he’s running. Just as good a reason as any other candidate.

PresidentialRaceMemes,fd7dbnd,t1_fd7cbev,1578202695.0,"Hmm? I never claimed any candidate copied any policies of his, although they should. However, Pete Buti. and Biden have actually copied talking points from Yang, and its pretty funny. I could send you a link if you’d like. Also, point me to any policy promise of his and I’m sure you could make it sound like a bill."
PresidentialRaceMemes,fd7cil3,t1_fd79ivf,1578202363.0,"The thing is, that’s not how the other half if Americans see it. You can try to coax them however you may want but they feel just as strongly about their position and could care less about anyone who disagree. Yang’s approach squeezes the oxygen out of the private insurers at a rate that, they either attempt to quickly adapt, (realign their incentives as Yang intends to do) or submit defeat letting out their dying breath, as those originally under the failing plan already jumped ship to the public-option because of its relatively increasing appeal. 

People who endanger the planet for a profit are a special kind of stupid and is an entirely different conversation.

Your claim that a public-option is essentially inferior to single-payer is false as there are more countries that have it and has been proven to be just as successful and effective, if not more. Yang isn’t selling an “inferior” product but one he’s knows will work and those aren’t even remotely related. Just because Yang isn’t a “revolutionary” doesn’t mean he isn’t a fighter."

For me, it’s more than clear of what he proposes to do and I’ve never seen any complaint about any vagueness when it comes to his policies. With the exception of his stance on M4A, which arguably only occurred because of an ill-fated label. Again, you’ll just have to define what policy looks like to you."

However, I do understand there are some, actually much more than some, stubborn Americans who not only are satisfied with their current insurance but would be adamantly against suddenly banning it, despite any long-term benefits. If it wasn’t a mainstream conversation decades ago, I doubt it’ll change be an easy sell now or in the near future, unless “incremental” steps are taken for those of us who enjoy the illusion of choice. The reason some Americans refuse to give up their guns, is the same one as to why some will refuse to give up a plan that is essentially their lifeline."
PresidentialRaceMemes,fd758g3,t1_fd711m8,1578199591.0,"I can honestly respect, however I still feel this is a more practical and ideal approach.

PresidentialRaceMemes,fd749gp,t1_fd6xubn,1578199233.0,"Well, he means medicare for ALL, otherwise known as Universal Healthcare, to anyone new to US politics, he just isn’t for the one iteration of the bill Medicare for All, which mostly only the Bernie camp has any knowledge of."
PresidentialRaceMemes,fd73j1e,t1_fd6xglp,1578198978.0,"I guess we’re going to have to define policy then lol. Each link you shared, the enactable plan, was clearly stated at towards the bottom of that policy page, under  ‘As President, I will...’.  For example, the 10x10 Student Loan Emancipation Act is a very clear policy. As for everything that follows or before that is a plan of action as with every other policy. The format starts with introducing the issues littered with data, the next is a summarization of the issues, followed by an excerpt from a reading, and lastly what it is he will do to accomplish the respective policy. For me, it seems clear but I can see if some may not see it that way if it isn’t a specific bill of any kind but Yang is barely a politician and creating bills isn’t his expertise."
PresidentialRaceMemes,fd70fed,t1_fd6tkn8,1578197945.0,"Unlike you, I never had developed an opinion on the matter of healthcare because I neither directly had a use for it as well as being politically disengaged. I, of course, heard of Bernie Sanders but my political interest peaked when I happened to come across a video about Andrew Yang. I know you didn’t ask for an anecdote but I say all this because I think what Yang’s appeal came from his authenticity, sincerity, and rational stance that seems to be less and less commonplace as our country seems to become more polarized/radicalized.  The $1k/mo was just a bonus. Because of that, my initial reactions to policies of his I didn’t initially agree with, like lowering the voting age, I took the time to do my research and understand where he’s coming from, granted I tend to think along the same lines he does, of what works and what doesn’t. Not to say he’s always right but his stances can be hard to refute especially as it pertains to the consequences of our current economy. As unclear as Yang’s plan may seem, he’s been fairly consistent in what he wants to achieve, and I have no reason to not believe that. The key difference btw. Yang’s plan and Bernie’s is that, Yang wants to give people a choice to prove the public option rather than pull the rug under them. Although, Bernie has a transition period, he ultimately calls for eliminating private insurers which doesn’t seem to be much of a choice but a forced transition instead of letting people decide for themselves."
PresidentialRaceMemes,fd6s4y7,t1_fd6n6lc,1578195040.0,I never knew that but this isn’t the only policy he’s evolved from. I trust his intention remain the same however bad he may have tried to relay that message to the public.

As far as Single-Payer being the gold standard, there are other countries with a public-option that have been just as successful and effective, if not more. Also, Yang does’t want to displace the millions if employee that work in that sector so suddenly but instead provide a transition that’s not so disruptive."

PresidentialRaceMemes,fd6qzyn,t1_fd6mfwe,1578194650.0,"Ah, this is new to me, but this isn’t the only policy Yang has since evolved on. Bernie’s approach to achieving Universal Healthcare isn’t the gold standard, there are other options to pursue. Other candidates could benefit from being able to adopt a mindset that can overtime while simultaneously being consistent in their message. Contrary to popular belief, it’s possible. As far as watering-down his policy, I’ll go further and say he doesn’t even address coverage. Why? Because it that plan wasn’t intended to address coverage but laying the groundwork for eventually achieving Universal Healthcare, (i.e reducing inflated costs, and other core details). Although I wasn’t aware of his previous support of Single-payer, those tweets were in 2018. Since the beginning of 2019 he’s adopted the public-option model and has always said he has whenever asked about it, from his most recent interview to as far back as his appearance on the JRE podcast early 2019. If you’d like some links I’ll gladly share them, ones that aren’t over a year old."

What I hope for myself is what others seem to take for granted, which is understandable given that its universal and is as instinctual as the need for food. For most people, we don’t seem to understand what we have until its gone. If anything, I am a relatively optimistic person, even naively so, but even that isn’t enough when I know I deserve better.  Not to say I’m entitled to anything but again, like I said, I have a good idea of what I’m worth but to others, that value doesn’t go beyond my appearance. What good is confidence if that confidence does nothing but make you realize that you can do everything right but still fail. What good is anything if I am the only one to share that joy with, if that makes sense. Unfortunately, I don’t have any redeeming qualities (intelligent, athletic, etc) and I find that my would-be satisfaction comes from the values others see in me. I do find value in some of what you mentioned and more, some of which I wish I could share with others besides myself, but those values for me don’t come before basic human connections. I wish they did but they don’t, trying to change that would be trying to change who I am inherently, which I don’t find possible to do for anyone, unless they suffered brain damage. Knowing that, I’m the last person to sacrifice the little dignity I have left to appease someone who doesn’t appreciate what I might offer (although recently I definitely would love the idea of someone pitying me, because then, at least, I am acknowledged) and I have done so before. The first person, a girl, that I got passed the initial stages of acquaintanceship with, was something new for me and that I enjoyed. Not even several months later and suddenly I got ghosted. Literally with no explanation. I would have completely fine if she stopped talking to me but at least had told me as to why, but not even that was done. That left me, once again, wondering why is it that people can’t just appreciate me for who I am. Afterwards, the few times we did encounter each other she acted as if nothing happened and I didn’t bother trying to explain something she didn’t seem to care for herself. Something as basic as a platonic relationship I failed to manage, and though I don’t think I’m really to blame for what she did, I can’t help but feel its an intrinsic trait of mine because she isn’t the only one. I do appreciate your positivity and good will, but that can only go so far when faced with reality. Sorry if that comes of as a little bitter, not meant to be."
ugly,fcgd23f,t1_fcg77ae,1577638784.0,"Oh, I wasn’t accusing you of that just a conclusion of mine from my own years of experience, which has showed me that its not merely a projection but a reality. For one thing, I know my worth and the one thing that keeps me from the social bonds I yearn for is primarily my looks. Not to say your message is cliché or wrong but that is a common sentiment that I know well. I don’t expend any energy on people who I know aren’t really willing to reciprocate any desire to get to know me, as I do them, so I usually don’t try. However when I do, the results are the same. They couldn’t care any less for me then they did before. I’m led by their engagement or lack thereof towards me, which is a part of how and what they think, a perception I can’t help to change especially one that’s been so consistent in my life. And claiming that I don’t have the social connections with people who don’t deserve it is an naive outlook for someone my age. I’m guessing the next suggestion would be to be patient for someone who treats me as they do anybody else, but if after 20+ years of never experiencing that, how would the next 20 be any different. To be fair that is a lot of time and anything could happen but the point is that the past, is not a reflection of the future but an indication of what it can look like. No matter hoe much I’ve gotten to know someone or they know me, it’s essentially been the same, a friendly acquaintance, if I can manage that, between two people who happen to share the same space from time to time.
