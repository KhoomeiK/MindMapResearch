BeginnerWoodWorking,feaiuu5,t3_eo9wgz,1578949390.0,"Once you have tools to make cutting boards, they are a fairly simple project.  Cutting boards needs small pieces of boards to be jointed so there is no gap between them to prevent moisture bacteria from setting in between the pieces. This may come as a challenge with just a hand saw and sander. 

I don't know what kind of space you are working with or your budget but I would start with a table saw if you can. You can make a ton of jigs for it making it extremely versatile. I made my first cutting board with a table saw and router with multiple jigs for jointing and flattening. Even with those 2 items, it was a chore. 

If you do end up making boards, use TiteBond II glue as it's water resistant. I also went to home depot and bought multiple length 1/2 steel piping and bought pipe clamps on amazon for them. Not perfect but they get the job done and relatively cheap."
