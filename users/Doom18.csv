Showerthoughts,fd8ybrp,t1_fd8ub92,1578225307.0,"I had just an idea.(About the zombie) 
We can't predict what evolutions are going to take place.(they can be like those from other species, or a brand new evolution) 
And by intelligent species i meant a species which is more capable of adapting than humans.Also intelligence does affect biology(example: an animal tries a lot to climb a tree, then mates, its offspring might have got an instinct and/or body structure of climbing a tree etc.).As the one that survives passes on its characteristics. (example:instinct)
Also you just presumed that a zombie outbreak is a spontaneous process, even if it is doesn't a tadpole 
go through metamorphosis?
Also i didn't say that brain is superior to a nervous system spread across the body .(it can be)
{But what if zombies had more cluster of nerve cells(like brain or spinal cord), More than two ofc, spread out through the whole body.}= My vision
Also, will you explain how using CO2 to respire breaks the laws of physics."
Showerthoughts,fd8nmuz,t1_fd8k76o,1578220608.0,"Maybe zombies could be an intelligent species which could respire using CO2 (breaking CO2 and converting it into complex energy units with the help of remaining O2 from CO2 and H2O, given that they drink water too),we don't know for sure.
Also any realistic zombie(as you said) would be dead after getting shot in the head(unless it has a whole body nervous system like an ant, which could be a possibility according to ""my"" vision of a new intelligent species).
Also i didn't say about a non beating heart in a zombie,so your third point is correct.
Also i am not seeking a fight with you or anyone.
Also i too don't believe in the classic zombie,so we are even there."
