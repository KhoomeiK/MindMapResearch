So in all you will have 4 of the same photos taken at the same time, but from different perspectives. After you develop them and scan the photos you have to bring it into photoshop. There, you will go to the frame gif thing (look up how to edit Nishika n8000) photos and you basically just have to make 6 frames, 4 frames of the different perspectives going consecutively and the last 2 frames of the gif have to make it loop like so. If you need clarification let me know I love helping people w photos n shit."
