depression,ff74scw,t1_ff5phjb,1579641119.0,"You are welcome! And thanks a lot! Its a good thing to keep in mind but its also very difficult I feel. The spiraling thoughts and anxiety are exactly why its hard to be productive. So far I have not really found anything to help with that but maybe I will. Thank you for sharing as well, I think its great that you have a friend like that. Sounds like we can learn a lot from him!"
depression,ff2nl8n,t3_eratx2,1579515010.0,"Epicurus said that our consciousness is the result of the inner workings of our body and that it only exists as long as our body is alive. 

He also said that there is no reason to fear death. Because when we exist, death is only ever approaching but never actually reaches us (otherwise we would be dead). And when death arrives, we are gone, so worrying or fear doesn‘t matter since its all over. So in either case death is nothing to be afraid of. 

If you liked that I highly recommend reading more about Epicurus. He built a whole principle on how to life a happy life, maybe you find something in there that helps you. 
Even more than that I would highly recommend therapy if you have not tried, it can really change your life when you find the right therapist.  
I don‘t know your situation, but I know life sucks and I also think about suicide pretty often. But if we keep trying then there is a chance for it to get better. But it never will if we just give up."
depression,ff2n7gf,t3_eravhk,1579514411.0,"I understand why you feel that way but its not your fault that you are depressed or suicidal. So you should not feel guilty about it. Instead, you spoke the truth and you can be proud of that. You might have started something good here. Maybe their support on your journey will make the difference for you to finally feel better. 

Your parents reaction is also pretty normal I guess, they feel guilty for not seeing the signs and think about what they have done that made you feel that way. What their part is in all of that. 

Give them some time to process what you told them. They might come to you when they did so or after a while you walk up to them. 

Not talking about problems has never fixed anything, at least in my experience. Your parents can now understand you better and start supporting you with this. This has the potential to be a great!"
depression,ff2mydg,t3_eraxnf,1579514019.0,"Only ever experienced that when I self-harmed once while drunk/high. So I guess my answer is yes and no. Also, thats probably the danger with self-harm that we don‘t really know what we are doing there, like accidentally cutting deeper or stuff like that. 

If I may: I would suggest never doing it with the lights out again to prevent this, more so I would suggest less risky methods of self-harm (like a rubber band etc) and most of all therapy so you can fight the problem at its source."
depression,ff2mrms,t3_erb0tc,1579513730.0,"There definitely is high functioning depression. What it comes down to, in my opinion, is performing on a certain level while feeling depressed. Might be  that this is only possible when you are not in a very bad phase and only when its an average+ one, though. 

Not saying I qualify for that term but I had times where I felt so bad my life just came to a full stop. I did nothing at all for years except therapy. But now I actually get stuff done, maybe not all of it and not without struggling but for example got my degree and work out, stuff like that. But I am still depressed, think about suicide more often than I should and wake up to terrible days (like today). 

Hope that helped you somehow"
depression,ff2mi39,t3_erb1wh,1579513315.0,"Its not only that you forget tragedies that your mind blocks out. Depression in general, since its a mental illness, has effect on ones cognitive abilities. 

So you can‘t focus as good as you used to anymore and your memory suffers from it as well, plus a couple other things like that. What you experience is pretty normal for someone with depression. 

I know how much this sucks, it already feels like depression is stealing so much of you, sucking out your energy and joy. But now it also takes away your past. What I found helpful was starting a notebook where I wrote down all my good memories that I want to remember. Can even be small things, whatever you prefer. Other than that I don‘t think there is anything we can do besides getting better."
depression,fes2e9j,t3_eqha7l,1579360690.0,"Not an expert but maybe you should give /r/Relationship_Advice or /r/Dating_Advice a shot. I feel like there might be a better way to say how you feel about her. Also with their help in mind you can probably walk into the situation a little more secure and confident. 

I hope that everything works out the way you want it to and just know, what you are about to do takes bravery. So be proud of yourself no matter what. Good luck!"
depression,fee71ak,t3_eooqaq,1579027719.0,"I think thats perfectly normal, even in a storm once in a while the lightning brightens the night. Emotions are complex. Thats just part of being human. Be glad there are times like that! Also:

That is a good and bad side of depression in my book. Bad in the sense that people won‘t notice how you feel until you tell them or until it is too late since you laugh a lot and stuff like that. But on the other hand its also a big relief. That there is sometimes some calm in this storm. Where our true self shines through, just for a second. Remember who you see in those moments. Let them remind you that you are still there and that you can go back to your former self, to being happy. That the only thing in your way is depression and that you will fight it with all you have got to finally get your life back and more of those beautiful moments where you can be truly yourself. :)"

depression,fed619z,t1_fed5pty,1579000616.0,"It is. But so far you have done that every single time. And it does not sound to me like you are beaten. Maybe out of breath, so you take a breath. Everyone does. After a while you will feel like you can try once more. As long as we don‘t quit there is no way the story ends in a bad way. We just have to keep going until we like where we are. :)"
depression,fed53yi,t3_eoitop,1578999312.0,"Its great that you practice healthy habits like that. It makes fighting depression easier for your body. Sadly thats not everything needed to feel better but a great basis. 

Maybe its your brain chemistry, do vitamin D and B12 (?) could help with that. Maybe its too much time in front of a screen. Maybe its too much chillin and not enough time being mentally active. Maybe you need more fresh air. 

Its impossible to tell for us really, best way to find out is probably to consult a doctor and additionally maybe a therapist. Since feeling drained of energy can have physical or mental reasons. Maybe its just stress."
depression,fed4t0g,t3_eoivdl,1578998875.0,"While my reasons for being depressed and running behind at school were different, it was still similar. Back then I found that telling the principal / teacher that you are having a hard time right now, feeling depressed, can help a great deal. No need to go into any detail with that though. In my case they were very supportive and that helped me a great deal. 

Definitely recommend trying therapy though, you should talk with someone about what happened. You deserve to be happy and to have those wounds healed. Therapy is the best and maybe only way for that in my opinion. Depending on the relationship with your parents, maybe talk to them about how you feel, again no need for details if you don‘t want to. 

I can‘t really imagine what you are going through, gonna be honest. But I think you have proven tremendous strength already. By reaching out here and still continuing school. That is everything you need to get through this and I have no doubt you will. I know it might not seem like it right now, but life will get better again. I promise you that. As long as we keep moving forward, keep trying, there will be salvation. Best of luck to you!"
depression,fed4bxz,t3_eoiwjb,1578998184.0,"Definitely sounds like something you have to properly deal with. If you feel like therapy does not help I would try another therapist. It might take a while and its exhausting but finding the right one is worth it. 

Also don‘t think its healthy that this topic is taboo with your friends. Why would they not listen to your side of the story? Why would they not believe you? If they are true friends I think it should be ok for you to say „I need to talk about it, I need to know that you all hear my side of the story and that you don‘t believe those lies about me“. But this is something you should talk about with your therapist beforehand."
depression,fed41t9,t3_eoixn6,1578997766.0,"Since I don‘t know what it is you are dealing with personally I would just recommend therapy even though you are afraid. Took me like 7 years to find the right one, had terrible experiences and wrong diagnoses. But when you finally find the right one its worth all of that. Its ok to be afraid, its ok if you need some time so this idea really grows on you. But I honestly believe its the best step. You don‘t have to tell them everything from the start, you can see if you have a good feeling about them and slowly reveal more and more in a comfortable tempo for you. 

If you need your parents agreement then tell them how you feel depressed and that you want to feel better again. That you want to try therapy and don‘t accept no as an answer. I don‘t have experience with that part to be honest but I think thats the best way. 

Reaching out here was a great first step. It proves strength and that you are willing to take action to get better. Thats all you need to succeed. When you feel ready walk the next step. The important thing is to never stop. Life will get better as long as we keep trying. I promise you. Good luck!"
depression,fed3m90,t3_eoiy4j,1578997137.0,"Its probably impossible for a stranger to answer that question for you. I think that is something you should meditate about, no phone, no distractions, just you sitting in quiet searching for the reason. Give it time and don‘t stop before 30-60min if needed. Eventually the answer will come to you. 

Not caring about things anymore and suicidal thoughts are often signs of depression. Best way to find out is to go to a therapist. Don‘t trust any of those useless online tests though. 

Suicidal thoughts often come to us not because we actually want to die, but because we wan‘t to stop living like we currently do. Sounds simple but by understanding that you can focus on the things in your life that you want to change. After finding them you can start being proactive, to get the change you seek. That is the only way it gets better. 

If you ask me, definitely go see a therapist as soon as possible. The longer you wait the deeper the hole you are in and the longer and harder is the way back to feeling ok again. Don‘t put yourself through that. You deserve to be happy and you are strong enough to walk this way. Good luck!"
depression,fed38fg,t3_eoj3n4,1578996570.0,"Very sorry to hear that. Are there any clubs / activities / extra curriculars  that your school offers? These often are a great way to get to know people. Other than that you could also try to join a sports team or similar in that area where chances are high people from your school go there as well. Are you sitting next to anyone? Maybe you can ask them if you can come with them for lunch break or you talk a little before and after class. Maybe also look out for people showing things you also like, e.g someone wears a Milano soccer shirt, you like them too, so that is something to break the ice with.

I know how your situation feels like and I wish there was a magic solution, but so far I don‘t think there isn‘t. You can try the stuff above if you think you can do it, but it probably won‘t be easy. Other than that, have patience, be kind to the people around you and with a little luck somebody will want to hang with you. Best of luck to you! It will get better!"
depression,fed2ekq,t3_eoj4ll,1578995330.0,"Sometimes, even often, things don‘t work out like we wanted them to. But someday you might be grateful that they didn‘t. I know that this does not help right now but try to see it that way. Stay hopeful and positive. Make sure you learned your lessons. Try again after a while. It will get better."
depression,fed274d,t3_eoj5mt,1578995019.0,You could switch to games for now that are not all competitive or about fighting stuff or something like that. For example Stardew Valley. Other than that meditation and some research on the web. Most effective is probably therapy though
PostMalone,fe6xzky,t1_fe349v4,1578907589.0,"No offense man but even if you come up with the money unexpectedly, you still shouldn‘t go. Doesn‘t really sound like you can afford it. Because just because you might have money for something doesn‘t mean you can. Be grateful that you already saw him and know that you will see him again one day, but don‘t make unhealthy decisions like that"
depression,fe5d7ro,t1_fe59grk,1578867949.0,"If you feel like you can‘t tell them, write it down. Maybe just show them these comments. I‘m sure you will feel a lot better after that.

depression,fe5aujb,t1_fe58b58,1578867159.0,"I‘m glad that I could help. If you got any further questions or something like that, feel free to ask. I was on the other side of this once, and I am happy to help."
depression,fe5aetk,t3_ents6d,1578867008.0,"I think thats more of a philosophical question without any meaning to right or wrong. I can definitely understand where you are coming from with this and can relate to it but heres my side:

First of all, life isn‘t fair. Thats just how it is, you probably know that. But thats also simply the reason we struggle and suffer. Its part of life, but its also part of its beauty. It sounds cheesy but without that, positive feelings would mean a little less as well. Of course it would be better if the world was perfect, only happy and good people without anything negative. But thats not how it is and never will be. 

So why not just give up? Because I for myself want more out of life. I will die eventually, so why not try to make my dreams come true? If I am never trying then nothing will happen. So I try even though my chances are slim. I still hold hope to succeed. There is nothing lost and everything to be gained when doing so. 

Its hard, you need breaks, depression, your environment, situation in life. Many things can make you stop, but that doesn‘t matter. What matters is that we keep trying. That we keep standing up. As long as we do that we won‘t fail. As long as we keep moving forward, there will be salvation."
depression,fe57580,t1_fe53evv,1578866239.0,Sure thing!
depression,fe56lus,t3_ents7t,1578866060.0,"There are many different things that can help in situations like that and it highly changes for everyone. But by reaching out here, you show that you truly care about him. This means a great deal and says a lot about you as a person. Don‘t underestimate the hope, strength and comfort you bring to him like this. You might be the deciding factor one day. 

I highly recommend therapy, maybe in this state even something called Day Clinic where I am from. You go there like work for example, have therapy sessions there but still sleep at home. They help with finding the right therapy as well as medication. With that it won‘t be possible for him to abuse any substances, since it does not work well with anti-depressants. 

I don‘t know the situation but I think its something where you need professional help. I went through this myself, I am still depressed but much better now. There is always a way back as long as we keep moving forward. Just so you know that this can definitely work. 

Having someone like you by ones side when fighting depression means a great deal. It probably won‘t be easy to be honest. Be the ray of hope if he has none left. Let him know you will stay at his side, no matter what, and that there is no giving up until he feels better. Make the necessary calls and appointments for him if needed, but with his knowledge and improvement. Might be that he wants to but lacks the energy. 

The person that did this for me changed my life. I owe everything I am, as well as still being here to this person. There are no words for how much that person means to me. There are no words for how tremendous your support for him is in this situation. Thank you for making the world a better place, for being kind and caring.

depression,fe35opz,t3_enpbid,1578846144.0,"Reddit can be as unhealthy as all the other social media sites. If you feel like it has a negative impact on you then it is probably time for a break. Helping others is good but at what cost. Also there are many more ways to do so than reddit. You could volunteer or just help people close to you. 

I also think that its wrong that you were not meant to be. There is either a system behind everything like destiny, or there is none at all. So you either were meant to be or you are just there for no reason other than chance, and so are we. No matter which one is right, you were not „not meant to be“.

Also, if you think about helping others so much and also practice that. Then the world is already a better place with you in it. :)"

But this person definitely showed you, by ghosting you, that its not someone you should keep talking to. To do something like that you got to have no decency, no care for others at all. So I would think of it as you dodged a bullet there and learned a valuable lesson. 

I would stay a away from getting in touch with others like that for a while. And if you do try again, only look for friendship until you met the person or really know who they are."
depression,fe2ylo4,t3_enosxw,1578844285.0,"Congratulations on doing this step! Therapy can have a tremendous effect on ones well being so definitely a good choice! 

What to expect..Finding the right therapist might take a while and thats perfectly normal. So if you feel after the first (few) session(s) that it does not quite fit, perfectly ok! At first your therapist will probably ask some basic questions like why you are seeking therapy, how your life looks like and stuff like that, to get to know you and understand the situation and yourself. 

You can say whatever you want to say, thats what therapy is there for, though your therapist should talk to you about that since there are certain exceptions from their professional secrecy, for example if you would say you plan on robbing a bank. Just ask them „so how does this work, do you have professional secrecy“ for example. 

Crying is perfectly fine as well. Therapy can be very emotional and exhausting but thats necessary to work through certain things. Most therapists even have tissues in their office for that.

Can‘t really comment on the work thing, might also be something to ask your therapist. But I don‘t really see a reason to mention it at work other than to get needed time off or some kind of insurance thing maybe? But your therapist will probably know more on that as well.

Being nervous about this kind of stuff is perfectly fine. Its a very personal and emotional thing, so of course we react to that. But you already went this far, set up an appointment and reaching out. You have proven great strength doing so. I have no doubt you will get through this. You are on the right path :) good luck!"

Talking about insomnia, I used to have that too until I got my medication. Might be worth looking for something like that for you. You always take these before you sleep since they make you sleep so its easy to remember. At latest when you can‘t sleep you will know you forgot."

depression,fdymoz2,t3_ene8ye,1578781416.0,"Since you ask depressed people on reddit you will mostly get answers of people who spend a lot of time in front of a screen.

There is probably research on this but its probably unhealthy. I do it too and wouldn‘t judge but still. 

I had phases like that as well and still have them from time to time when I am really down. Which proves to me its some kind of coping mechanism. Which is not necessarily bad but for me it also meant that I stopped moving. My life stopped while I hid in my room, depressed and lonely. 

Don‘t go down road (again), its not worth it. Maybe try therapy or think about how you can fight your problems. Let gaming be your reward, not your way out. 

Thats just my opinion, definitely biased since thats what happened to me. But in general, too much of anything is unhealthy. Good luck!"

depression,fduwhv3,t3_en60z5,1578740023.0,"Thats a very difficult question especially without any context. But being depressed doesn‘t necessarily mean that you understand the reasons  behind yours. Its a learning process that for me, mostly came from therapy. You might just have a very sad day without knowing why, either because thats just it or because you don‘t know your „triggers“. 

So I definitely think you can be confused or clueless about stuff like that even though you experience them. 

Also maybe interesting, depression often comes with memory loss. For example I have been depressed for 10 years now and most of the time, even last year is just in a fog and I don‘t remember. You also can‘t perform at your best when depressed so your memory and cognitive skills in general are at a worse state. Hope this helps!"
depression,fdqprn7,t1_fdqpbzk,1578672247.0,"In my case, its the reason I am still here today, not exaggerating. I had given up all hope and the pain was too much for me to bear. It can truly change a life. But I hope that for the two of you, it never gets this bad. Glad I could help!"
depression,fdqn4nz,t3_emqml7,1578670590.0,"There is not a single person walking on this earth that would not benefit from therapy. 

I would highly recommend giving it a try. Though to be honest it will only work with the right therapist. This search can take a while but its worth it.

Like others said, you still get through the stuff on your own but you also have a neutral opinion coming into your thinking and learn new skills and techniques to do so. You will also understand yourself and others a lot better. 

Go for it (if you feel like it)!"
depression,fdqkm7z,t3_emqv0o,1578668942.0,"I practiced self harm most of my life and have been suicidal too for probably 6 years. 

It definitely is something that comes and goes like you said. I thought I was completely over it because I felt a lot better but in recent months its back again. 

But to me it just shows me that I am in pain and that I wan‘t change. Also I have beat it in the past so why not again?

Honestly I would love to give you a more positive answer but I am still on the same journey at 24 years. But I know that life also gets better, if we just don‘t stop walking. You might not believe it right now and I get that, I‘ve been there, but one day you will look back and know that it was true all along. Just don‘t give up just yet. I promise you it gets better."
depression,fdqjxe2,t3_emqvxf,1578668477.0,"It shows much kindness that you seek out here to help your friend and it means a great deal. To be honest I don‘t know what you or your friend are going through but I know what its like to be depressed. What helped me was having someone in my life that showed me that they care. That they are there for me no matter what. 

Your friends problem sounds like a thorn that was not removed yet? If so I think you can‘t help her heal the wound just yet. Just be there for her, listen and maybe spend some extra time with her. Even texting her more can mean a lot if thats not possible. 

Like I said, I‘ve never been in either situation but being there for others always helps so I hope reading this wasn‘t a complete waste of time for you.

Again, it says a lot about you that you truly do your best to help her. That is everything you two need to get through this together. Good luck!"
depression,fdqilpj,t3_emri1t,1578667572.0,"Very sorry to hear that. I‘m no expert nor have I experienced this but it might be one of the things in life one has to practice. If the relationship with you dad allows it I would be honest about it and tell him how you feel. That you would like to work on it together with him. And that you would ask him to be patient with you. 

Other than that, talking to a therapist is always good as well. They will know much more about this and how to help you.

You did a great job by reaching out ob here and by thinking about what happened. Thats the first step needed for change. Now on to the next, good luck on your journey!"
depression,fdqi5fj,t3_emrpqy,1578667260.0,Happy Birthday to you! We are in a similar boat so I know how that feels but I think its important that we keep going. Maybe next year already or sometime in the future you will celebrate your birthday again and will look at the year that is behind you and you will see that it brought the change that you desired so much. :)
depression,fc5kren,t1_fc3v9sx,1577460241.0,Honestly New Years Eve is the worst day of the year. Its then I realize that just another year went by where I hoped for change and tried my best and still nothing ever changes. I would love to do something that day rather than being home alone with those thoughts and crying myself to sleep. But so far nothing. Who would want to change a tradition anyways /s
depression,fc3untn,t1_fc3t3ad,1577399077.0,I‘m on pc. You?
depression,fc3rd7z,t3_efv2fo,1577396693.0,"I have the same wish as you. Just to be loved by someone, being the closest person in the world to each other. For years people told me to just keep walking, that eventually it will happen. But so far it did not. Kind of losing hope. 

What I want to say is that I know how this feels and how it sounds when people keep telling you „there will be someone“. I might not believe in this for myself anymore but nonetheless I honestly believe its true for you. 

You sound like a great person to me and I am sure destiny will bring what you desire the most. Maybe even this coming year. Just hold on a little longer, be as strong as you have been so far. Your special someone is just waiting for the perfect time to arrive."
lonely,fbq61rd,t1_fbpz3zm,1577028648.0,No worries. Its nice to know there are people out there who understand. Even though it would be better if not
