Even though no one has actually insulted me about my weight, and I am a healthy weight for my height/age, I would still like to lose weight. This would make me happy, yet I doubt anyone would notice that I had lost it. For some people, I'm sure this would ring true, but other people want to lose weight for their own benefit at happiness."
fatlogic,fcwjryn,t1_fc4p59h,1578027532.0,"Although that is true that most guys can't do it, I don't think it's about how they carry weight, but more about their foot size in comparison to the rest of their body"

I was about 11 at the time, in my bedroom, trying to go to sleep, when I heard this weird almost like breathy cackling noise coming from right next to my bed. I got absolutely terrified and called for my parents. They came in and my dad told me it was a Possum outside. So in itself it wasn't scary, seeing as there are heaps of possums around my house, but that was the first time I had heard one and it sounded like it was coming from beside my bed."

AskReddit,fcjroc8,t1_fcjbb7c,1577701243.0,"Once I was walking home in the evening (still light ish) and I was crossing a road, had the green man thing, and looked before crossing the road (because I don't trust cars) and it was all fine, then as I was just past the middle of the road (not a massive road) a car literally screeched to a halt about 1 metre away from me. It was turning into the road I was walking across, definitely going faster than what he should have been, and I definitely had right of way. To top it off, I looked through the windscreen and he was fucking death staring me like I was in the wrong. So no gut feeling saved me, but if the car did end up hitting me I absolutely would have gone to hospital and possibly died"
