offmychest,fedxloy,t3_eog7oh,1579022033.0,The issue is using your hard life as an excuse to abuse and hurt others. I can't and won't accept that.
offmychest,fe4vt2p,t3_eno95k,1578863246.0,"Really, really proud of you and I know how good that feels."
Customer_Disservice,fck5kk7,t1_fck3grx,1577717225.0,Really good to know that you're ok. Won't be using airbnb after this for sure.
Customer_Disservice,fcirnwm,t3_eh9gia,1577668203.0,Oh my gosh I hope you're ok!
offmychest,fcbnq5p,t3_egx238,1577588954.0,"That numb feeling is very normal in my experience. It's your mind's way of protecting you in the beginning when the pain is the most acute. Just let yourself hurt when you're alone, If nothing else. Not allowing yourself to do that is so damaging.  I'm proud of you for what it's worth. Truly. Once you've processed the hardest parts of this loss, I promise that you will have the ability to reach into the darkness of others where only you can go because you know their pain where no one else does."
offmychest,fcbksuj,t3_egz3oa,1577588021.0,That letter was more than enough. We don't realize how our regular day to day actions impact others so deeply in really meaningful ways. I can tell you with certainty that she held on to the words you gave her in that letter until it was time for her to go. Letters are so so so important. You did well. You did more than well. You have a beautiful heart.
offmychest,fcbivv3,t1_fcad7ri,1577587398.0,Agree 5000. Well said.
offmychest,fc1iq33,t1_fc1eq4h,1577319972.0,"Thank you for your reply,  really. Thank you with all of my heart. My doctor has given me a referral to see a counselor I just need to find one and I think that you're right.  Your compassion for a total stranger means everything to me. I hope your Christmas is a good one. Thank you again."
