pics,ff6t7qf,t3_erwyri,1579634390.0,"So while that might look really insane for a little pet dog to cause that much destruction, terriers were bred for ratting on farms (or in rat pits for gambling purposes, but it started for farms). That's why terriers tend to be bold, tenacious, high-energy, and will chase prey animals and fixate on them. They're little so they can maneuver and get in where the rats are. They were meant to do exactly what's being shown in the picture. I bet you anything those four dogs are super tired but really happy. 

This is also why terrier breeds, when left alone, under-exercised, and bored, will BARK. It's because they have enough energy to kill hundreds of rats every day, but that energy isn't being used."

internetparents,ff6ppj1,t3_erubj0,1579632292.0,"Here are some tips:

1. Turn on music or put on a youtube video on your laptop and have that going while you do whatever tasks you need to do. I like to fold laundry and put it away with the tv on. 

2. Live by the philosophy of ""If it needs doing and can be done within five minutes, do it now."" That will help keep your kitchen and bathroom quite clean. 

3. Develop a schedule or at least a rhythm to your cleaning. I usually do two to three loads of laundry back to back, then I dump all the clean clothes on the bed and sort them all and put them away. Don't let laundry linger! Key point of this one is - only start doing laundry if you have the time and energy to completely do it (which includes putting it away). 

4. Develop your own habits. Yeah, your mom was super busy and you didn't get a lot of guidance. You're an adult +now+, so try different things and see what works for +You+. There's no right or wrong way to do chores, just so long as they get done to your satisfaction. 

5. Make sure there's actually a place for each item of clean laundry. Are there enough hangers for shirts? Enough drawers for pants and under garments? Is there a place to put socks? If a certain kind of item is always in a pile when clean, it means there isn't a good enough place for it. Make one. 

6. Cleaning will never be fun or pleasant. Don't wait for it to become fun. But do learn how to do it efficiently! 

* Cleaning up spills in the kitchen that are greasy or sugary will benefit a lot from a paper towel soaked in hot water (it will melt the sugar and thin out the grease enough for you to wipe away). 

* Soak casserole dishes in hot soapy water for about 2ish hours at least, and it will help soften up all that crap stuck on there. 

* To clean a bathtub, I turn on the shower for a moment and get the porcelain all wet, then I turn off the shower and I get some powdered AJAX and dust that all over the inside, then I use a mop (the sort that's very squashy, made of ropes) and use that to scrub the inside of the tub - it's way faster and won't hurt your back AND keeps your hands away from chemicals. 

* Get a scrubby brush and a plunger for the toilet. The scrubby brushing takes like a minute and your toilet will look much better, and having a plunger is just common sense (better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it). 

* Get a scrubby sponge for the kitchen sink. Make sure to occassionally clean the kitchen sink directly, because gunk can build up.

* When cleaning the floors, make sure to sweep and then mop in that order. 

* To mop the floor, get a bucket of hot water (again, the hot water helps break up sugars and fats) and add in only a little pine sol or whatever you use. 

* Wash your bedsheets! When I've got a cold they get washed at minimum once a week. When I'm well, eh, maybe twice a month. 

* A paper towel and a spritz bottle of 409 do wonders to clean up almost all surfaces. 

* If you're waiting on a call or on the microwave or oven or whatever, wander around and pick up stuff to throw away, and then throw it away. I usually aim to try and fill up one hand only. 

* Make sure you always have enough of the following - trash bags, paper towels, dish soap. That shit lasts forever, and finding yourself without one of them when you need it is a misery. 

* Remember that you don't need to do ALL of this in one day. It's way better to spread it out, so it's only a small job once in a while - that makes it way easier to do."

NonBinary,fegk637,t3_eoxaxj,1579095227.0,"A question to OP and a few of the commentors - Could it be that the discomfort with being called a ""man"" or a ""woman"" is because those words are so incredibly loaded with baggage? Pronouns and diminuitives (he/she, girl/boy) are less loaded, especially diminuitives - children are expected to be malleable and to change. But once you're an adult you had better conform, you know? 

""Man"" and ""Woman"" are like the molds into which none of us fit, and to a lot of us those words are synonymous with feeling pain and rejection and self loathing. Like being born AFAB (like myself), I'd be uncomfortable being refered to as a MAN because there are so many expectations placed on men, and I don't meet a lot of them. It's equally inaccurate to describe who I am, and also presents me with YET ANOTHER cultural ideal that I'll never reach (and if I fail at it, I'll suffer just as much, and perhaps more). It's stressful."
NonBinary,fegjnmm,t3_eoxaxj,1579094802.0,"Try not to worry too much about labels - sometimes they can cause more stress than they alleviate. 

Just be you. 
What pronouns work best for you? Use those.
What manner of clothing works best for you? Wear that. 
What name feels right for people to call you by? Use it.

We human beings are extremely complicated creatures, and living in a culture that places such intense emphasis on gender differences doesn't help at all when you don't fit neatly into one side or the other.  Also keep in mind that even though there are a huge assortment of terms to help describe being non-binary, not everyone understands them to mean the same thing. Rarely is there a rock-solid codeified definition for any of them.

My Kryptonite, as it happens, is a workplace that is mismanaged.

I do a great job with my chosen field when everything is clear. When it isn't and I'm the lowest rung on the process ladder, that's when things go wrong.
