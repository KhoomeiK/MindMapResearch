I don’t mean to compare serial killers with people with aspergers, but someone with aspergers can be very high functioning, yet can’t understand certain aspects of human interaction.

Now, this guy here may just be playing stupid with his daughter, not wanting to come out and say he understands she loathes him because he’s a disgusting freak, or he could actually not understand her discontent because he didn’t do anything to her. Now on some level he absolutely has to know that even if you don’t murder someone, they can still not like you because you murdered someone else. However this is what I meant when things just don’t click, the knowledge is there but just the way he thinks doesn’t allow him to really get it.

He may even love his family and would think it awful if they were murdered, yet he clearly has no regard for any other people and thinks they are nothing. So there’s already a distinction there, he is likely applying that to his daughters mentality, but of course, she doesn’t share his way of thinking"
