bipolar,ffaigqn,t3_esik2z,1579736507.0,I'm personally governed by cycles of hypomanic or full on manic down to depression suicidal thoughts and I hate to say 3 attempted suicides. With the correct medication and therapy I aim to be somewhere in between the two. I'm bipolar and borderline personality disorder with other mental health issues which resulted in me being hospitalized many times. The best advice I can give you is get the right meds get plenty of sleep and keep a good support network around you for when times become that much harder. I hope everything works out for you my friend stay safe

I'm currently on antipsychotics medication and without boring you its saved my life but it did take a while to work. We are governed by cycles of highs and lows you just have to believe that what your feeling will change. Is it possible you can talk to friends or family and explain what's going on for some support you need people around you to help if you do this on your own. I hope things change quickly for you my friend good luck and stay safe

bipolar,feao4p5,t3_eo9du8,1578950760.0,I was hospitalized 4 months I was in hospital for about 3 weeks and it was voluntary. About 10 months ago I was arrested and held on a section 2 for 28 days I'm from the uk. It is much better to go in voluntary as you have more rights like being outside without nurses with you aloud out on your own unsupervised. I've been hospitalized loads of times and never had a bad experience a holiday for mind I call it saved my life a number of times. You will be ok my friend you can do this just believe in yourself good luck

bipolar,fea6grq,t3_eo8vtq,1578944898.0,My wife cheated on me when I was hospitalized 4 months ago. I dont blame putting up with me for 15 years wasn't easy. It complicated because she has stage 3 cancer and is refusing treatment as she has had cancer twice before. She also has mental health issues but she never sought out help like I did alcohol and cocaine is her medication. I told one of nurses in hospital that our marriage was bipolar when it was good it was great and when it was bad it was really bad. It sounds that you will be the 10% that will make it work your partner loves you your lucky. I've never tried est but two of the patients in hospital I was at did it and they say it works. I'm on 500mg seroquel and it really helps me cope I hope everything works out for you my friend dont beat yourself up over this you've got this you will be ok

BipolarReddit,fe84zhu,t3_eo2ipg,1578922642.0,4 months ago I was hospitalized because I came off my meds. The psychiatrist told me my psychosis was due to self medicating with cocaine. The fact is that I hadn't had cocaine for about 6 months prior to been hospitalized. After about 3 days in hospital the staff went to see my psychiatrist and told him my psychosis had nothing to do with cocaine so he said it must be to do with my bipolar and borderline personality disorder. This resulted with him putting me on quiterpine an antipsychotic drug. What I'm trying to say is that you can challenge his diagnosis seek second opinion if your not happy it wont be held against you I hope this helps my friend
BipolarReddit,fe2dt0i,t3_enn7tz,1578837242.0,I'm on 500mg seroquel have been for about 4 months and I've put on about 15 kg I'm starting to manage my diet and hopefully loose some weight

BipolarReddit,fdl3nbc,t3_elxtup,1578516498.0,I'm bipolar and I have borderline personality disorder combined I have become psychotic on a number of occasions and hospitalized many times over the years. I'm not a doctor so I would advise you to get your brother help from doctors or psychiatrists. The life your brother had with gangs and drugs does make you worse due to paranoia etc. I was involved with drugs many years ago I've been stabbed twice and I had my throat slashed I was very lucky to be alive it does effect your mental health. The only thing that helps me now are antipsychotic medication to cope with paranoia and mood disorders. I live in the uk we cant believe how you have to pay in the USA compared to the uk. I know its difficult but your brother needs professional help I hope he gets it for him and your family I hope things workout for your brother by friend good luck

BipolarReddit,fd56lik,t3_ek2n6e,1578174702.0,Please think about this my friend you might not think this but there are people in your life that will be deverstated by your actions. I know the last time I tried to kill myself with an overdose woke from a coma 3 days later with my family around my hospital bed crying there eyes out. Over 30 years I've being going through this shit I'm going through a divorce now I'm bipolar I'm bpd and other fucked up disorders but seeing my family crying that day stopped me from killing myself to this day. I promise you my friend our lives re governed by cycles of highs and lows you just have to ride it out it  does get better. If you need to talk il be around for a few hours PM me if you want.  Ask for help tell your family change your meds see your doctor do anything except neck them pills not fucking worth it my friend good luck

BipolarReddit,fd3neon,t3_ejxv3n,1578159967.0,I've been hospitalized twice in the last 12 months it's a holiday for the mind. I've always found that being truthful to my doctors and psychiatrists is best in the long run the whole idea is to get better if you leave out information you wont get the help you deserve
