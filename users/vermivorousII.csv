This episode does show a good example of checking with patients' for ""A&O,"" alert and oriented. If someone is not alert and oriented to themself (person,) where they are (place,) time (month/date/day,) and event (what happened to land them in the hospital) then they cannot make medical decisions for themselves. After asking those questions and getting a grasp that this patient WAS A&O Christina explained to him that he would die if they turned off the vent and if he wanted to live he would not only be dependent on the vent for the rest of his life as well as not be able to move on his own ever again.

Lots of medical professionals would not want this life for themselves and would choose end of life. If I had to make this decision for myself I would not want to live trapped in a bed with someone trapped to care for me bathing me, changing diapers, possible tube feedings, frequent other medical issues that come from not having my body working properly, bed sores, changing vent equipment that allows me to breathe, the list goes on and on. This man's wife is a nurse and knows what happens with a C1-C3 fracture that doesn't allow the body to breathe for itself naturally and was convinced her husband wouldn't want to live like that, but was willing to stand by him if he did want to live since his brain and thought processes still worked and he could make his own decision.

I would also like to throw in that decisions like these are made and fought over frequently. Look at the case of Terry Schiavo, she was not A&O X4 and the case to ""unplug"" her was bitterly fought in court."

At the very beginning Callie talks about the brain and you see Callie bloody on the car starting at herself standing and start singing, and throughout the entire episode Callie is in a catatonic state and when she is aware everyone (to her) is singing.

Obviously in the scenes where Callie is not around (all the attendings in one room singing/fighting about where to start) they kept singing because it would have made the sudden drop in music even more awkward.

Musicals in general can be awkward to watch in my opinion, and I thought this was a really well done episode for Grey's musical wise"
