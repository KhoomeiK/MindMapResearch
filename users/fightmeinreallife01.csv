veganfitness,fd6616o,t3_ejxcip,1578186017.0,"I am also susceptible to sodium and used to have hbp.  My experience was and is that high sodium is essentially unavoidable if you eat out.  I prepare all of my meals from scratch (a decent burden), but it really is the only way.  In  a pinch, you can counteract the effects of sodium by consuming foods high in potassium during the same meal."

PlantBasedDiet,fcwjpum,t1_fcwj1sg,1578027485.0,I can't grasp what you're trying to argue or why you're being so hostile.  Nobody disagrees with the fact that human beings are adaptable and ate whatever was plentiful at any given time.

Some corporations are dishonestly labelling their animal-product-containing foods ""plant-based"" because they are too lazy to work out a formula without animal products and know many consumers aren't real plant-based eaters and won't check."
