I cant remember what the exact numbers were but rims were one of the faster things to melt and usually if the melter was at about 1250Â° F and they were the only thing in the melter it would take about 20-30 minutes for a close to 15000 lb load to melt out almost completely into a bath of molten aluminum, fast enough that they were usually used in about 2000 lb portions mixed in with other things to keep the melter from overheating but slower then some of the other alloys we dealt with. Truck rims for like big rigs and stuff were a different alloy and kept seperate and used in even smaller amounts."

ak47,fctvr3r,t1_fctmgk7,1577962031.0,"I'm gonna guess it's for the 5.7 part, I for one would like another option in 5.7 but it would probably take more work then what's already been put into this project to make it happen. The 22tcm round would probably be a more realistic option if even considered since there are already conversion options out there for other SMGs like the SA26 and it's closer in dimension to 9x19 then the 5.7. Your other closest option would be 7.62x25 since the Bizon was made in the round as well but that's if OP plans on making that version but it doesnt use the iconic helical magazine that this design is probably most recognizable for. With Ruger making a 5.7 pistol hopefully they'll push out a carbine eventually as well if the pistol does well enough."

Accidentally get handed a pocket of high brass shells and fire one shot and instantly regret it but decide to tough it out realizing the mixup (I keep the high brass for a semi auto I own) and after the second shot the gun double feeds. Fix the issue and fire another shot but this time dumps 3 shells out, whatever reload the tube and try again. Fire again and double feeds when I go to cycle so toss the extra shell aside and try again only to have it double feed 2 more times. Swap back to the low recoil rounds and have no issues with those for 50 or so rounds so try the high brass again out of curiosity and double feeds on the 3rd and 4th shot again. All were Winchester brand 2 3/4"" but only had issues with the high brass, and while I liked the gun it killed my shoulder pretty bad and now I don't have a KS7 anymore."

Universal shells did not feel great, I mean it was doable but felt worse then out of my PW87 or my Tristar O/U and got through 200 before I called it quits on the second trip. I also accidentally fired some high brass shells one of my buddies accidentally grabbed me from my ammo box and they hurt pretty damn bad. With those I only made it through about 10 shots but that was also because the gun started double feeding and it also kept dumping all the shells out of the magazine tube which only happened with the high brass shells and stopped once I swapped back to the universal and reduced recoil shells. Having also fired the KSG12 I would go for that instead, not as lightweight but it's a lot easier on the shoulder."

Only reason that even happened was because I was walking around at a gun show and a guy stopped me and asked about it and decided to buy mine instead of the one he was looking at because he had already been waiting in line for 45 min to do the background check and sold it to him for a slight loss and this fucker wants $2015."

I like mine better then the gen 4 G17 I had and for the price it comes with a lot of add-ons people who do competition shooting seem to add to guns already out of the box and includes the Vortex Viper on top, I'd say for the cost buy it just to see how you like doing competition shooting and then get something better once you figure out if you even wanna do it or not."

guns,fc4sjz9,t3_eg11mj,1577426810.0,"Indianapolis ordnance makes parts for the sten to convert to semi auto including the reciever tube, but it requires the finishing work done to it. I've mentioned it before but if you wanna build something out of the ordinary but have minimal skills you can build a VZ61 skorpion, finished reciever and parts kit will come in at around $6-750 depending on the kit and since most kits already have the barrel and everything installed on the ""upper"" you only have to modify the trigger group. For that you'll need a dremel, some cutting wheels, and a cheap vice to cut 3 pieces off, remove the sear I guess is what you'd call it, then install everything into the lower then assemble the gun. Took me maybe like an hour, hour and a half and I used tools I got from Harbor Freight.


Back to the sten and other parts kits guns, you need to basically redesign parts of the gun to fire semi auto only, make it so the gun can no longer accept full auto parts, then if it's a gun like a sten or an uzi figure out if you want to make it into a pistol without a stock or put a 16"" barrel on it till you can turn it into an SBR."
