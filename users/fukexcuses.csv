It's very Noble of you to trust your good friend and your husband.

As long as your best friend or your husband don't entertain the thought their mind won't open up to such temptations.

The world is a big place and just say that there doesn't exist another person that your significant other could hit it off with good chemistry will be a little far-fetched.

.... That's where commitment comes in. The ability to decide to stick it out with someone through the good the bad ....sickness.... health .... Because you love them you decide this. 

There's a lot of people you can have chemistry with but two people who form of Union and commit to that Union shall have everlasting love.

If it's something that bothers you let your husband know because he needs to set boundaries if that is the case.  

Definitely speak up because things will only happen if we let them and people will only treat you the way you let them.

Us humans are also weak and at times give into temptation. Bringing this topic up before such a moment arises, if it does, is all the more important so that it can be prevented.
