news,ffb8sqq,t3_esncx0,1579755364.0,"""Under the existing compacts, approved by Oklahoma voters in 2004, tribes pay the state “exclusivity fees” between 4% and 10% on gambling revenue in exchange for the exclusive right to operate casinos. Those fees generated nearly $139 million for the state in the 2018 fiscal year, most of it earmarked for education, on roughly $2.3 billion in revenue from games covered under the compacts.""

It looks like they pay the state so the state doesn't open casinos and compete?

Nevertheless, I think its poor form and greed for the governor  to request this. The state has been mismanaged by politicians and now they are running out money to fund basics like education?

I believe it would be respectful to publicly thank the tribes for funding education in the state and leave it at that.

Who would have thought  that in 1815 when they were getting kicked out of Georgia and Alabama  that the poor (white) government  would be relying on them for money."
