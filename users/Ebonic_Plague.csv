As far as saying it’s running away from the fight, that was more paraphrasing what the IDW would say about not having someone on your show that you don’t agree with or not having them come speak at your college.

unpopularopinion,feeh0sn,t3_ehe8uo,1579033581.0," (Primary) the left doesn't have a monopoly on integrity and the moderates don't have a monopoly on electability.

**Electability:** I hear tons of people parroting the idea that Biden (or Pete in some cases) is the only one who can appeal to the middle. That's not how presidential politics works. The position that is closest to the middle is not always the most politically viable. Also consider the people you know; how many people do you know that are truly in the middle (not bullshitters who like to say they are because it sounds enlightened, but are truly up for grabs between Trump and a Democrat at this point)? Now try to think of how many people you know who just wont vote. For most people the second group is orders of magnitude larger. People like Bernie Sanders get those non-voters to show up to the polls and people like Biden make them sleepy. Swing voters barely exist, and the ones that are out there are far outweighed by non voters. Democratic candidates, in order to overcome the electoral college, need to create a movement and the liberal ones are better at that.

Next point: historically the electable candidate sucks.

'00 - Gore: supposedly electable, though he was not an avowed moderate, just linked to a moderate presidency, so I wont push too hard on this one.

'04 - Kerry: supposedly electable while Dean was ""too far left"". Lost an incredibly important election and Dean would have smoked W because he was the best candidate in human history we just didn't know it at the time.

'08 - Clinton: Supposedly electable because the country wasn't ready for a black president who talks about sweeping change and actually dared to oppose the war in Iraq (gasp). McCain would have destroyed her so hard.

'16: Clinton: She won the popular vote but was still arguably the worst presidential candidate since Dukakis, maybe before. Also couldn't beat an obvious moron and liar (not just obvious to me! people actually said ""I'd rather vote for the lying moron over Hillary""). Note: If you dig through my comment history you will see that I was part of the problem here because I supported Hillary in that primary. My bad. I learned from it. Don't yell at me,

**Integrity:** The left is trying to paint the moderate candidates as ""corporate democrats"" and claim that they are bought and paid for by the rich. Recently, Mayor Pete was criticized for having fundraisers with rich people and this was seen as evidence that he is a puppet of corporations. You know who else has had private fundraisers with rich people? Literally everyone. That includes Bernie and Warren. Does that mean they were corrupt prior to making the political decision to not have private fundraisers? Does that mean Obama was a corporate shill? Howard Dean? Dennis Kucinich? Jimmy Carter?

The left can't imagine that some people actually believe in center-left policies without being bribed somehow. I personally do and nobody is giving me a damn thing. The average American genuinely believes in center left policies but as soon as they enter government their opinion had to have been bought. Look at all the assholes over at r neoliberal (of which I am one) they all truly believe in what candidates like Biden and Pete are proposing yet the minute any of them ran for president the left would say they must have taken so many corporate dollars that it made them moderate.

The only evidence the left apparently needs is that they are in the category of moderate to believe that someone like Mayor Pete is on the take. There really isn't any more evidence that he is corrupt, yet that is the main attack against him (that he is a bought and paid for corporatist). Are their corrupt moderates? yes, of course. There are corrupt politicians all across the spectrum. But you have to have actual backup to label them as such, not just say everyone to the right of you must be. There actually are people who sincerely believe in policies that happen to be popular among the rich and corporations but they believe them because they think they do the most good for Americans.

Also if your candidate loses don't blame it on the DNC. That's a conspiracy theory worthy of The Donald. Hillary got more votes than Bernie, that's why she won. Sometimes your guy loses and that's OK. You aren't a victim.

In conclusion the left is wrong about moderates, moderates are wrong about the left and Republicans are wrong about basically everything else. End of post. A few disclaimers to follow.

1. I know these arguments appear to just be a straw man of what you might feel and I'm sorry. It is a little difficult to make a complete argument that addresses even good faith opinions in a short post. Maybe there is some nuance to your specific brand of these opinions that makes you not a moron, and I'll grant you that. By and large, these are pretty pervasive opinions I hear among Democrats that make my skin crawl.
2. I know that you can never know who would have won an election. It's far too dynamic. We at least know that the moderates have some pretty glaring losses though.
3. Talk shit about Howard Dean and I will fight you. Worse yet he will fight you then you are really fucked. Otherwise I'm happy to hear why you think I'm wrong but please vote based on how unpopular this is overall."

Generally an S&P index fund is a good measure of average. In this case trump was given enough money that an average investor would have made more money than him. He is below average. Being below average means more people would have don’t better than not. Therefore, more people would do better than Trump did than not. Even people who did worse than him would still become  billionaires. Become a billionaire when you are given that much that long ago is not an amazing feat.

If they have the ability to act unpredictably in certain instances where needed but overall act based on what is most likely to have good outcomes they will be one of the best in the world.

To say someone acts unpredictably and is therefore doing a good job ignores the fact that the more predictable move is often predictable because it’s the best move.

samharris,fdqjg8y,t1_fdpxsce,1578668157.0,"But foreign policy actors still use processes (models) to think about and predict foreign policy. That process can be flawed or not.

You look way dumber in real life if you take a series of events that happened two days earlier and write a post mortem  about them, declaring that you know the results. That’s dumb and that’s what the guy in the OP did. 

Everything you said actually bolsters my point, by the way. In fantasy football you actually know results right away so you can at least get feedback more immediately. In foreign policy you sometimes don’t know the entirety of the results until 20 years down the road, yet here is this guy saying it was a success.

He wrote this PRIOR to Iran retaliating, which we knew there would some sort of response from them and now there will likely be some response from us. All of those things are way less known than the range of football outcomes, yet people are declaring victory.

What I’m saying is ALL we have to go on is process here. What was the thought process? You can judge the Reagan Doctrine, the Clinton Doctrine, the Bush Doctrine etc. and the reason we talk about those doctrines is because they mean the same as process. What is the Trump doctrine? What was his process here? That is what we can judge right now. Judging the results is the thing that makes you look dumb.

Edit: where did I say we should use any stats to make foreign policy decisions? I didn’t. I forgot to address that point because it was irrelevant to my post but I should because it’s 90% of the argument you were making. To be clear, I never said I think we should use statistical models to dictate foreign policy and nothing in my comment remotely suggests that."

This is not to mention that with that sort of disposable income and freedom to take risks and actually engage in investment activities not available to people who weren’t handed money most people in his position outperform him even if they don’t invest in the stock market.

I’m not downvoting you, by the way. That’s someone else.

I still highly doubt that’s Trump’s process though. I get that there is a justification that some smart people can make that represents good process, but trump has been asked to show his work on this and hasn’t made any coherent noises.

Often times trump will do some dubious shit then there are people who try to smarten it up. Trump literally wanted a religious test for immigrating here but other people smartened it up and started trying to find real justifications. We ended up the travel ban as is but the actual process initially amounted to “fuck Muslims. Don’t let them in.” That’s a bad process, even if you believe in the travel ban as is.

Just because a good process can get you to the same conclusion does not mean all process that arrive at the same conclusion are good processes.

If your friend Noah had done it, maybe it was a good process. I don’t think Trump had a good process and rarely does.

Edit: by the way I still disagree with most of what you said on its face but that’s not worth arguing about because that wasn’t Trumps process. That’s my main point here. Trump has a bad process even if the results turn out ok, which it’s way too early to judge right now."

I think we need to take a lesson from the fantasy football community. Basically in fantasy football you bet on specific outcomes that are probabilistic. It’s a common thing for r/fantasyfootball to say “sure I was Incorrect about the outcome, but my process was sound”. You will also hear “well the outcome was ok [because of some fluke play or unlikely scenario] but my process was bad”.

By process they mean what data you act on, and what data you view as noise. Bad process is listening to the noise, like starting Adrian Peterson because he’s Adrian fucking Peterson, but ignoring the fact that his team is awful.

Critics of the Iran action would probably say that we might accidentally get a good result out of this one thing, but this is bad process. Bad process in fantasy football is starting a Miami running back against the patriots on the road, for example. Bad process in foreign policy is acting unilaterally and aggressively in a region where that is often met with radicalization of the public which results in more terrorists. They aren’t saying that’s going to have a bad result with certainty. They are saying make decisions a similar way 100 times and you will get a bad result more than 75% of the time.

The author here doesn’t seem to be looking at this from the same standpoint. He seems to just be tallying up the aftermath in the short term and deciding if it broke one way or the other. That’s not how diplomacy ought to work and if you bring that bad process shit into my fantasy football league we will crush the shit out of you and make the trophy a picture of your mom’s tits."

Those deaths are far more numerous than any of the belligerence prior to 2003. 

I used quotations marks totally correctly. Beyond that being irrelevant and a distraction from the real issue, quotation marks are not exclusively used for direct quotes. In my case I used it to denote speech from a third person point of view. Totally valid.

The Kurds do not have a secure state, Saddam did not have any sort of WMD that warrant immediate action, and the geopolitical outcomes he predicted were laughably off the mark.

This of course depends on the rules though. If I still age while time is stopped this doesn’t work but it is ethical. You still have to put in the work there just isn’t the opportunity cost of taking on jobs because you always have enough time. You can do 20 years worth of high paid work and have only a couple of years real time pass. 

Of course once you are pretty rich from that you can start a firm and start making passive income for the rest of your natural life."
todayilearned,fd489p3,t1_fd44gll,1578165298.0,"It goes a whole lot further than sitting around whining about women. 

There are very manly people who have never lifted weights. My point though is that those guys have a view of masculinity that doesn’t involve things like turning the other cheek, being compassionate, or doing any career that women did in the 50s. If you believe in such a traditional view of manliness then physical strength should definitely be part of it.

I’m not using strength to quantify manliness but that’s not because it’s a bad measure. I don’t try to quantify manliness. Those who are that devoted to the project of quantifying manliness, on the other hand, really should be using physical strength though because it’s less arbitrary than all the other stupid ass metrics they use."

Fitness,fcyahp3,t1_fcwnubv,1578077143.0,"Somewhat related, is it ok to sort of drop dumbells after a set of dumb bell bench press? I sort os let them do a controlled fall to either side of me. I have a decent technque that makes it not too loud but I still have to drop them a little. I can't sit up with 90lb weights in each hand."
Fitness,fcya3s4,t1_fcwk41g,1578076941.0,I hurt my back trying to be quiet too because it seems douchey to be that loud. I'm finally back to normal after 1.5 months of not being able to dead lift. The fact that you are actually concerned about it means you are cool. Just fucking drop them though. I promise I will do the same from now on. You only get one back.

DynastyFF,fci8jfr,t3_eh7ivu,1577659040.0,"I’m considering trading up to 1.01. Similar position in that my team is built to win now (M. Thomas juju golladay mixon) I just need another running back and for a couple of those listed above to get it together. 

At 1.01 I can guarantee I get the very best RB. I’ve drafted best available for a couple years now. This season I just need that elite RB.

There’s something to be said for keeping your 1.01 to make sure you get the very best player at the position you need."
NoStupidQuestions,fcg0u7k,t1_fccoqct,1577635484.0,"Luckily most life (like 95%) lives in places where water doesn’t typically freeze. In fact most animals who live around cold water have specifically adapted to the fact that water floats (polar bears weight destributing paws, penguins sliding on ice etc.) I think those animals would have just not evolved. 

Life would be no different for bugs, big cats, sapiens, apes, snakes, fish. Most life on earth never comes in contact with ice, and the ones that do would not be adversely affected so much as they would have evolved differently.

Ice floating is really not necessary for life at all"
NoStupidQuestions,fcckt7r,t1_fcbpnc4,1577599549.0,I wish it didn’t. We wouldn’t have to blow out sprinklers and worry about other shit freezing. Way fewer pot holes and global warming wouldn’t cause sea level changes. That would be great if water didn’t get more voluminous when it froze.
