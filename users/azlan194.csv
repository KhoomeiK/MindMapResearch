Sometimes if I'm feeling casual, I would even just slide down the stairs with the bottom of my shoes instead of stepping down on each step."
tifu,fff9g7c,t1_fff8p6f,1579878988.0,Ikr. I thought at first OP was just trolling for karma or something.

funny,fedg17i,t1_fedfsy5,1579010531.0,"Huh, TIL. I guess it was made so that the handle bar and the seat balance out at the fulcrum. I guess it kinda makes sense since when you use the machine, you only want to lift your body weight."

worldnews,fdnxi6j,t1_fdnwc3d,1578594849.0,Same thing happened a few years ago when the Malaysian Airline was shot down over Ukraine. Nothing came out of that. People already forgot a few weeks afterward.

news,fcxhaos,t1_fcxfto1,1578062912.0,Yeah Baghdad is at the center. The nearest border is Iran. They could either drive all the way South to Saudi or West  past Jordan and into Israel. But it is definitely a very long drive.
