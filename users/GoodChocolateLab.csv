They used to call me pigeon toed, big lips, knock knees. etc. They thought it was funny but I was a very, very sensitive child. I always wanted to fix my nose, change my pigeon toes, etc. I was very self conscious most of my life. I stopped caring when I turned 50.

The condition is ectropion eyelids. This is where the lower eyelid pushes is outward. The bottom line is you can see the red part of his lower lid. It does not hurt to have her checked out.

I know it hurts but it will get better. When my mom passed away in November 2015, I thought I would never get over her death because I was missing the person that I talked to every day and and visited every weekend. It was so, so difficult but little by little I started to think about all the times we laughed together and when she held me when I had to suddenly put my dog down. My mom was 86 years old when she passed and I was 56. I carry her picture  and an angel she used to keep in her wallet in mine. I know she is always with me!üò¢"

dogs,feg3kzf,t3_eox1fx,1579075381.0,"You had a lot of years together and you spent a lot of time with her! You should always remember the happy times! I know it is hard to let them go when it is time. I have had three dogs that I had to put down and it is not ever easy. With my last dog, my chocolate lab Winston, was the hardest. The only way I could cope was to get another puppy right away. It is not something I took lightly. I did what was best for me and my current lab Winston is a handful. This happened in 2011 and Winston is now 8.5 years old. He is a very demanding dog because he talks back a lot. He has been a therapy dog since he was a year old. We used to visit hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. For me getting a puppy, was the best decision!"
dogs,feg0div,t3_egyfg8,1579071591.0,Please do not search Dr. Google too much because it just makes you think the worst. Do you live in So Cal?
dogs,feg06yd,t3_egyfg8,1579071383.0,BTW it stayed pink for a while and turned a little grayish after the root canal. Please take the time to think about what you want to do so you can make an informed decision about what is best. I also use Care Credit which is a credit card for human and pet health needs such as dentists. The company always has a promotion where the percentage rate is waived for 18 months or so as long as long as you do not miss a payment.
dogs,fefza1p,t1_fefyfi6,1579070357.0,"Figo pet insurance. They do not cover yearly teeth cleaning. Because my dog injured his tooth after getting the insurance, the root canal was covered because it is considered an injury. A general vet wanted to pull it, but I got a second opinion from a dental specialist and opted for the root canal. I read through many pet insurance policies until I decided on Figo."
