Bananas, mixed veggies, whole wheat pasta, marinara, vegan meatballs (a good source of protein), tofu (another good source of protein), etc.? Just because I have some processed stuff like chips and stuff doesn’t mean that my diet is “a bunch of junk grips” and it’s 100% healthier than when I was eating fast food multiple times a day. Every week I try to add more whole foods to my diet. So what if I eat sunbutter and jelly or some crackers? They’re not the main parts of my meal. Fasting definitely kickstarted my weight loss, but it’s only continued because I made healthier choices with food, so maybe don’t tell me how unhealthy my diet is lol."

I barely lost 2 pounds that month and I still don’t know why. I don’t think I was eating any more than the other months, but who knows. After I saw such a small change, I did actively try to eat healthier since then, and progress resumed. Don’t beat youreself up.

If you’re going to go to college, I encourage you to just enjoy your first two years or so of general Ed. You’ll get to take lots of different classes (math, English, history, science, psychology, sociology, electives) and that could be enough to help you decide a major, and, from there, a career. Don’t make yourself believe you have to have it figured out today; you don’t. You really do have time and you’ll find something you love to do."

rant,fdeze6e,t3_ekxh2v,1578349855.0,"I’m responding to this as a vegan, so feel free to take what I say with a grain of salt.

I understand your point, though I do think that most vegans (particularly those that choose veganism for ethical reasons) are better at empathizing and feeling compassion for other living creatures, particularly animals, because of what we know about the animal agriculture industry. I don’t think meat-eaters are more evil or mean or whatever, but I do think a lot of them are willfully ignorant because they enjoy the convenience of animal products.

This obviously isn’t applicable to everyone; like you said, there are some really awful vegans out there. I think vegans can come off as preachy or holier-than-thou because they’re genuinely excited to share the knowledge they’ve learned with people. It comes from a good place, usually. We care about people AND animals, and we want to help others learn what we’ve learned. Maybe vegans in general just aren’t very good at having these conversations, and that is something we could reflect on and try to improve.

I’m pretty new to veganism and I haven’t really dabbled in activism or even just discussing my reasons for it (the closest I got was defending myself from being mocked by meat-eating relatives at Christmas, though it was mostly in good fun), but your post makes me think about the best way to approach the topic in the future, if I decide to.
