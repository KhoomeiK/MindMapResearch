AmItheAsshole,ff9mo06,t3_esaf1h,1579716198.0,"NTA I used to do something similar to my sister. She had a habit of stealing snacks from me and also has a pretty bad peanut allergy. So I started to buy one packaged peanut snack (like peanut butter crackers or something) with all my regular snacks and keep them in the same bag with a big note that said ""I rubbed the peanuts on everything in this bag :) ""

she valued not having a reaction more than stealing my snacks very quickly and now we laugh about it together since this was when we were like 7 and 10"

AmItheAsshole,ff44scr,t3_er48ix,1579555533.0,NTA I wish I had people around who stepped in to help encourage healthy eating when I was a kid and overweight so it wouldn't have been such a struggle for me as an adult. I ended up learning to love cooking healthy foods and experiencing a wider variety of foods later on but I always wonder how different it would have been to grow up with that outlook and not being so heavy as a child. Easier to maintain a healthy lifestyle than trying to lose heaps of weight later on
entitledparents,ff3ims4,t1_ff2a574,1579541839.0,"Based on the story it sounds like they said something once or twice then resorted to touching the kid. Even in jobs where you're directly working with kids (after school care, nanny, teacher, etc) Its still encouraged to try and solve situations without physically touching the child. So in a retail job like OP it might have gone over better to try to call for another employee or the parent to come over rather than touch the kid. In jobs like this I feel like its always better to be safe than sorry especially if safety of the people or merchandise is involved. But thats just my opinion I could very easily be wrong"
entitledparents,ff1xjsv,t3_eqzqxc,1579488456.0,"Yeah that lady was awful but you still shouldn't be touching other people's children to correct them. You're in your workplace and need to be professional while you're there and its not professional or okay to touch other people's kids. It leaves way too much up for interpretation in situations like this where someone can say you were doing something inappropriate when you were just trying to nudge the child so they are safely out of the way. For your own sake going forward try to focus on verbal only, in this sort of job you really shouldn't be. physically touching customers or their children, just the candy.

regardless this all sounds like a horrific ordeal for any retail employee to imagine. and that woman seems straight up neglectful and abusive

edit: Just went back and read the rest of this and realized OP does mention they're not suppose to touch the customers unless something major is happening. Child in anaphylaxis sure thats major would warrant touching I guess sure. Child excited about candy in a candy store near a display, might not warrant touching"

raisedbynarcissists,featpj1,t3_eo3bin,1578952141.0,"THIS

I just put this rational thought together this week for the first time in 21 years. I always used this to justify my parents behavior when I still lived at home because sure, they kicked me out multiple times, called me names, degraded me, hit me, belittled me daily, and blamed me for the fact that my dad was an abusive addict . BUT ""they aren't actually bad parents because I always have food and clothes and a house"" like somehow it cancelled out all the negatives"
aww,feaq1wn,t1_fe9vpyf,1578951239.0,"That's cuz the dog is overwhelmed. his ears stay back even when the hands move away from them, he's nosing to get closer to his owner to check for reassurance, and he is flashing the whites of his eyes also known as ""whale eyes"" All of these are signs of stress or discomfort conveyed by body language meant to tell others ""please give me space! I'm nervous!"" Obviously its not life-threatening or a dire situation, just overwhelming and a bit uncomfortable most likely"
aww,feaogiv,t3_eo6njp,1578950841.0,"Those ""whale eyes"" are a classic sign of stress and anxiety in terms of dog body language. Being confined to the backpack also probably isn't helping. Whenever I see my dog give that look when strangers wanna pet him and they're hovering over him or leaning too close to his face I always ask them to give space. He's an incredibly sweet dog and would most likely not bite but just cuz he isn't going to bite them doesn't mean I'm going to let them keep stressing him out when he's given the sign he's had enough"
AmItheAsshole,fdymuhg,t1_fdvopdz,1578781470.0,"couldn't agree more with this 

>Some victims hate their bullies visiting them, specialy at home, which should be their relative safe space. 

I remember when I was 15 a girl I was friends with sent nudes to my then bf and when I asked her why she would do that if she was my friend she said I threatened her and went to the school saying I ""threatened her life"" when in actuality I was I tears the whole time I spoke to her as to me I was losing a bf and ""friend"" Ended with me being dragged to security office in freaking handcuffs in the middle of my next class and threatened with an arrest, court date, anger management, suspension, removal from sports and extracurriculars, and a no contact contract. All based off her word alone. I managed to prove my case when I showed the school the messages she sent both me, and my bf including the nudes and the messages of her telling me to off myself since ""no one would care anyway""

She had bullied me under the guise of being my friend for a year and a half then almost had me get a literal criminal record at 15 because she wanted to be a mean girl. 

She called me on my phone 2 months after the incident and I was so furious she had the nerve to try and speak to me after all she did that it gave me a major panic attack. I can't imagine how I would have reacted had she been right at my front door"

AmItheAsshole,fdis95i,t3_eld14g,1578449895.0,"ESH - it sounds like she knows her dogs are reactive and she tried to bring them where they can be exercised alone before other dogs show up. Theres other ways she could do this where there is no risk of running into other dogs so obviously dog park should not be her go to. She had no right to ask you to leave but she has every right to bring them if it was empty.

You should have just asked her to secure her dogs first, don't call your dog over to go into an enclosure that you were just told has two dogs that would be willing to attack your dog. Don't play chicken with your dogs well-being to prove a point."

AmItheAsshole,fcmc3ap,t1_fckrfp8,1577770107.0,"Hi, epileptic here. I used to have to have my parents do the same thing for me as a kid as I would get grand Mal (as well as petit Mal, absences, and myoclonic) seizures when triggered by a stressor/ trigger and my parents would put me in a cool bath then let me rest in my room with the fan on low and a light blanket. I understand how stressful it must be to be the parent of a child with epilepsy/ seizure disorders but please get your wife to understand how crucial it is she stay calm. She does NOT need to add stress or panic around the seizures as they can be stressful for the person having them and when the people around are panicking it can make it 2x as scary especially for a child. She needs to make it as calm as possible for your daughter following a seizure and if she is back to herself let her play and be a kid, not a bubble baby. My parents went a little overboard trying to keep me safe and while I appreciate that they kept me healthy as a kid it felt like I was being singled out from other kids as not normal
