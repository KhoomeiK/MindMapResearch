careerguidance,ff8jyfy,t3_es722t,1579682033.0,"Yep. I was hired by a dm and he thought my drive would help perk up this store and get it back to where it needed to be. I met with the SM for 20min and she barely spoke to me. But the dm loved me and hired me on the spot. 

A year later we had a new dm and a new sm and while the current sm liked my work ethic and the drive I had for the store, another asm and new dm hated me. I didn’t mince words and was very honest about why the store continued to under preform. A week later I was fired for breaking policy (didn’t break anything). I live in at will state so they didn’t need a reason to truly fire me anyways. 

When I left pretty much everyone else left after that. Because the morale was so low, none of the associates were treated with respect, hours were constantly getting cut and nothing was being managed correctly. 6months later they called me up and asked for me to be the SM and I said no because I was not going to be gaslight and wasn’t going to be their little bitch. Any associate that left and said it was because I let go, I made sure I got them placed with a new job as soon as I could because I was always networking with other SMs in the area just to see if we weren’t making numbers due to our store and policy or because traffic wasn’t there. So I had a ton of useful connections. 

I truly try my best to be the type of manager people want to work for, I’m not in the business of trying to make people’s work life any harder then it needs to be."

In regards to op, he definitely saw the dynamic of the motherly love Narcissa had for her son not only during this scene but also during the Malloy manner scene where she didn’t want her sister to call the dark lord in the off chance this wasn’t Harry and Snake-Man decided to pop off. At this point she truly began plotting her escape. But being dead center and trying to walk away from the man causing such chaos was a no go.

Other people do it because they have a certain story of dance skate that requires more ability to move the ankles. ie braking your ankles, jelly leg style that sometimes having a leather skate that broken in is not sufficient enough to do the skill.

1st savings cu- I keep about 3.5k in this account as an emergency fund. This is what I currently live off of being unemployed for the last 4 months 

2nd savings cu-My main savings account. This account gets paid out first with any incoming money. When I was working I put 30% of my full time pay into this account and 50% of my pay from my side hustles.  

Large bank checking-this account handles any liquid cash I may need when traveling as I currently live in a very small town surrounded by other small towns.

retailhell,fcvvumh,t3_ej6naj,1578011256.0,"When I was part time I made sure my manager knew I had Sundays and Monday’s off (this after 6months of working) this allowed me to have a little bit of free time to see friends and allowed me to schedule appointments, run huge errands, pay bills etc. 

When I was a store manager I never gave myself a set schedule in order to keep my team from burning out. So I planned as much as possible. From my two days I would use half of a day to decompress and be lazy and then I did everything that I needed to do. 

For me I grocery shop best late at night when no one is there and things are being restocked. So the night before my day off, I worked, planned out what I needed and after work I would complete that task. If I had appointments during the day, I would make them as early as possible so that I could come back home, take a quick nap, and then finish whatever it was I needed. 

For cleaning and paying bills, I always kept a 3day rule. Sunday, Tuesday, and Friday, I would clean a different area of my apartment. Sunday was laundry and bedroom/bathroom Tuesday was kitchen/dining and Friday was living room and cleaning up after my dog (cleaning toys, washing her linens, wiping down her crate etc)

retailhell,fcst3wl,t3_eiivob,1577924425.0,"First off, I just want to say thank you. I don’t think associates realize how difficult our jobs can be.

Dealing with inventory and vendors, dealing with paperwork to make sure everything is being handled correctly. And then the customers. My god I swear half of them are idiots and the other half must be born with silver spoons in their mouth. 

For me I always tell my associates to let me deal with those people. If they give you any flack for any reason, then call me because those people bring your morale down and it’s difficult to shake that feeling. There have been countless days where I’ve done my job and have driven home only to stay in my car and cry it out for 20mins before I can go home and be present with my family. 

Overall, retail/service work gets so much shit and not nearly enough pay or thanks for the jobs we do.

I used to bike from my apartment to hub tech ridge station, pray I made it to at least the 801 to at least cut the commute in half. If I didn’t I hit a bus with a route time of 45 min to hit the next bus to get to Lamar and then hopefully I didn’t miss the Lamar bus or it wasn’t running late/early or cap metro app was off schedule. 

I cried one time because they decided to stop running the bus at 11 and I ended having to walk home 3 hours at midnight with groceries in hand. Worst night ever. When I moved to Hyde park and cut my commute to a 30min walk or 15 min bike ride was the best day ever. The apartment was crap but I was in Hyde park for less than 850 with no roommates so I was happy."

Yes it’s a 1st world problem, but it’s something that every city needs to restructure. The us is the absolute worst when comes to something like this"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fbze7f4,t1_fbz9mok,1577243751.0,THIS! A good friend of mine works at the Harry ransom center at UT and they charge 300 for a spot that’s still a mile from campus and 500 for a potential spot on campus. Meaning you might not even get a damn spot after paying that fee each semester. I was pissed for her and let’s not even talk about Austin public transit system. Makes me want to pull my hair out.

What I used to do was buy seats at Walmart 2 or 3 sizes big and just pull them over my outfit to be able just go. Secondly, what your uncle said was inappropriate and if you were my child I would not only want you, but I would need you to tell me these things so that I conversation could be had with that man. Language like that to any child is a red flag and I would no longer put my child in that situation. Tell your dad ASAP."
dogs,fbwvu26,t3_ees14o,1577160802.0,Yes! I taught my pup to grab the remote. It helps on those super lazy days. Also helps with playing. Each toy has a name and she will easily listen if I say let’s play with Franklin. She runs upstairs and grabs her turtle and we play.

childfree,fbwrvy2,t1_fbwptuz,1577157805.0,Exactly this! Just because we don’t choose to push a kid out doesn’t mean we haven’t scarified time and energy into raising an animal. It’s a years long commitment. Bottle feeding and potty training pups is no joke and having multiple at one time....I hope to never do it again.
childfree,fbvv20x,t3_eeoglk,1577136486.0,"Those people can fuck off. I used to breakdown to those people by saying that I take my baby to daycare, she has play dates, we go to training school, I’m that person that takes their pet to restaurants if they allow it (thank god Austin is like obsessed with bring your dog everywhere). If a major milestone happens in my and my babies life I tell my friends about it. I feed her, I clothe her, I take her the the vet, I make sure she is healthy happy and well taken care of. Just as a parent does with their kid. Also Sloan Calliope has better manners than most freakin toddlers. She follows my lead and directions and looks adorable while doing it. Most people are surprised I have her because she is super quiet yet a toddler is running around screaming their head off while their mother just stands there in awe. 

*edit* I even help birth my child so don’t even come to me about you’ll never know what it’s like giving birth and having to raise them. Birth is absolutely disgusting on both parts (SO MANY FLUIDS) and raising is tedious."
