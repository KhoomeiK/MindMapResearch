I haven't noticed a recent trend on Reddit (here and in other threads) where people see a giant miss information wave arriving from various groups, and are seeking to protect the masses from it. Trump's ""Fake News"" is an example on the right. But, I've seen a number of leftists support similar ideas here on Reddit.

And, while the intentions maybe good (at least in the mind of the individual). The means outright suck. I think in vacuum, everyone on Reddit would agree that book banning and censorship of speech is a bad thing. But, that's effectively what people are calling for.

Information management is information management no matter if you agree with the information, or not. Reddit complains about censorship from Facebook on one hand, then requests their censorship to stop ""fake Russian news"" on the other. IMO, you can't have it both ways. If your core principle is freedom of information, you have to stick to that principle whether you agree with the info or not, and believe that your fellow man is smart enough to tell the two apart.

No matter how you feel. You can't fight anti vaxxers by Censoring them because they are ""wrong"". Darwin, and many other great thinkers were considered WRONG when they first published their books. Likewise, you can't take away the ability of your political opponent to speak their mind.

Therefore, I'm going to strongly disagree with this statement here.

The idea being that when your focus is on the clan, you have a whole support network in the clan, and don't need to rely on society at large.

For example, I don't think the current generation 4runner has anything innovative about it at all. All it's ""new"" features and tech were borrowed from the Land Cruiser, Highlander, or other Toyota models. Same stuff repackaged into a new look. Likewise, the upcoming Chevy Suburban, has some innovative features. But, I think those features are the innovation, not the new model. 

I do consider cars like the first generation Chevy Volt, Toyota Prius, and the Cyber Truck as innovative because they made radical changes of fundamental aspects of the car (for better or worse).

Likewise, in other spaces. I would consider iOS, the iPhone, and iTunes innovative, because there was nothing like them before. These things created a whole new paradigm for smart phone / smart devices. On the other hand, the Andriod phone has innovative aspects (if you dive into the tech details of the OS). But, I wouldn't call Android or the Play Store innovative because they were largely just copying something that was out there already. Same with the iPad, iPad air, iPad pro, etc... A blown up iPhone isn't innovation.  

Now, there's nothing wrong with Andriod (I prefer it to iOS) and nothing wrong with making a new 3 Series. But, repackaging existing technology into a new product isn't innovative IMO."

worldnews,ffadycl,t1_ffa8qgj,1579733330.0,"The fundamental way unions work is to group all employees together and leverage their combined bargaining power. And, as a group, employees do have more power than individuals. However, in doing so, companies and unions both usually put people into buckets, and treat anyone in a bucket as equivalent. A journeyman pipe fitter for example is different than an apprentices, but one journeyman is usually treated the same as another journeyman.

If you're talking about unskilled labor like assembly line workers and grocery store baggers, this is usually true. One bagger is just as good as another. It's somewhat true with semi skilled tradesmen, but not completely. But, true enough it usually works for anyone who's not a master, at which point many leave the Union either because they are management, or they go on their own.

However, for a job like programmer, it breakdown completely. IT skill sets are crazy complex, and often overlap. And, things like years of experience are next to meaningless. So, IT personal would be very hard to put people into buckets unless you want 1000 of them.

Many tech companies handle this by having no buckets, or by putting people into job families that have wide bands. A company with wide bands might have a job called Senior Programmer where the pay ranges from $100K a year to $200K a year depending on the individual in question.

This gives companies a lot of flexibility in setting pay. And, IMO, this is a very good thing. I have a coworker who's 26. He's by far the best person on his team which has a number of 40 and 50 year olds on it. It would be unfair IMO for him to be paid less than the 40 year olds when he's doing better work. So, he was given a substantial raise, to bring him in line with the others. Something that was difficult already, but would be much difficult in a Union world. Yes, there are ways around it. But, the more rules, the more BS, the harder it is, and the less likely it is to happen.

For me personally, I have a fairly unique arrangement with my employer that works out well for me. I don't make as much money as others (still very good money), but I have an arrangement that allows for a great work life balance. If I was treated as a number, I might make more, but many of my benefits of my arrangement would be gone.

Now, all that's great for me and the 26 year old in my example. We're both damn good at our jobs. You might argue, what about the other people? Well, I think they are doing just fine. IT workers in general have a lot of leverage with their employers. No one in my shop besides our interns are making under $100K a year. And those interns are making $30+ an hour.

What Germany is known for is taking existing technology and refining it into the best example of that technology it can be. The Porsche 911 is a great example, having an air cooled engine until 1998. It's a beautiful car, arguably a work of art, but that doesn't make it innovative. The Mazda RX and it's Wankel Rotary engine on the other hand would be, even if it's no where near as great of a car. 

Leica is another great example. You could make a strong argument that Leica's optics are the best in the world. But, no one is going to accuse Leica of being revolutionary. Nikon, Cannon, Sony (Japan), and Red  Digital (US), are doing innovative work and disrupting multiple industries in the process. I can't say teh same for Leica.

Japanese companies are innovating in the field of health aid Robotics and human replacement robots.

Now, that doesn't mean they aren't innovative. But, lot more telling to me is that despite that massive R&D investment, Germany isn't disrupting the auto industry in any way that I can see as an outsider. On the two primary automotive innovation fronts (EVs and self driving cars), the German automakers are playing catch up. They are currently behind the American, Chinese, and Japanese in terms of EV sales. GM, the number 4 EV seller behind Tesla, BYC, and BIAD, still sells more EVs than all the German auto makers combined.

On the self driving car front, Germany didn't even allow testing on their roadways until 2017, meaning the German companies had to have their testing operations in the US. German companies certainly do have a number of patents in the area, but the American companies Waymo and GM have a HUGE lead in the number of self driven miles, and miles per disengagement. It really appears their tech is still better.

So, I'll bring this back to my 1st point that not all R&D spending is the same. If you're R&D budget is going into making a more luxurious BMW 7 series, that's nice. But, it doesn't move the needle much in terms of useful innovation. And, if your R&D budget is all spent playing catch up. That's a good thing for the future. But, it doesn't mean your an innovator today.

So, I agree that Germany has more industries than just the automotive sector. But, I'm not seeing how they are changing things on the ground in the same way I see Samsung, Huawei, Apple, Microsoft, etc... Now, I'm in the tech industry professionally, and I'm a consumer. So, maybe Germany has a lot of innovation in the aerospace industry or the heavy machinery section that I just don't see. But, at the moment, I'm really not seeing it.

At least in the US, we manufacture 5x more now, than we did in 1950. The reason people think everything is made in China or the developing world is 2 fold.

1. Despite the fact that we make more, employment in manufacturing is WAY down. Employment peaked in 1980, and has fallen below 1950s levels. So, we make 5x more stuff with less people.
2. Cheap consumer goods, the type most Americans buy, are made the developing world. High end goods, industrial goods, and commercial goods are still made in the US. For example, the $250 table saw you or I would buy from home depot is made in China. The $500,000 fully automated saws that Ikea uses are made in the west (probably the US or Germany).

If you start buying Luxury goods, or high end hobby equipment, you'll find a lot of it is western made.

That's the short answer. The long answer is much more complicated. 

Because, it's rarely a one to one. For starters, as the article stated, you have to consider how full the vehicle is. The 41g/km/passenger probably assumes a full train. Outside of rush hour, I've rarely been on a full train in Europe. In fact, I've been on trains where my party is the only ones in the carriage. That train is getting 41g/km with just 20 seats filled. And, by the end the of line, even during rush hour, you're going to be low on passengers no matter where you're going. But, planes don't travel 100% full all the time either. So, you'd have to consider the cost of the system. 

Also, when looking at the carbon cost of a trip, you have to see how long the trip is, not just the distance between two points. Planes can usually fly in strait lines (actually a curved line that's the shortest distance). Going short distances on trains is usually direct, but if you're going long distance, it's usually indirect. Think about London to Copenhagen via train. Down to France, across to Hamburg, then back up to Copenhagen. The trip is a lot longer. In the US, this is a bigger problem than Europe because there are so few direct routes. A half full train going the long route probably isn't much better than a full plane going to right there. 

But, for short hops, trains usually win hands down. Since planes only go to major stations, you often have to take another form of transportation to get to your destination. Trains in Europe will drop you at whatever small town you want."

TwoXChromosomes,ff4gzl5,t1_ff4e0nr,1579563384.0,"We can do some rough back of the napkin math. The daycare facility near me needs to maintain a 1 to 6 teacher to child ratio for young kids due to state laws. They are open from 6 AM to 6 PM meaning that they need to provide that staffing level for 12 hours a day. If the center provides health care, vacation, sick time, etc... to the staff like the location near me, the wage they provide is less than 2/3 the cost of that employee.

So, let's say the employee makes $15 an hour but costs the facility $22.50 after benefits. The child care center will have overhead hours such as staff meetings, training, etc... If an employee spends 10% of their time on overhead, you're doing pretty well, So, add back in that 10% overhead so now you're looking at $24.75 an hour cost for staff.

(Your kid) 1/6 \* $24.75 \* 12 hours \* 5 days \* 4 weeks = $990

But, this assumes you have 6 kids to 1 teacher. This isn't always the case. The 1 to 6 ratio is a HARD limit (1 to 6). So, if you have 8 kids in a class, you need 2 teachers, in the class PERIOD. You can't say, we have 8 kids in here and 4 kids next door so we're borrowing from next door. That's a big fine. So, let's assume that you really have 2 staff watching 10 kids, meaning a 1/5 share, not a 1/6 share.

That bring the cost of this $15 an hour employee up to  $1188.

A Day Care center also has other costs.

1. Helpers (e.g., kitchen staff, cleaning staff)
2. A Director or assistant director
3. Owners salary (usually hands on running the place)
4. Debt (There's probably a mortgage on that $2M facility)
5. Supplies (Books, toys, furniture, etc..., let's throw in another $500K)
6. Food
7. Marketing (these are business after all)

> straight up removal of all money from politics 

I assume you still want a democratic system. And, I image that in such a system, the media will be required to provide air time for the candidates. But, how will that air time be rationed? If 1000 people want to run for president, how do you pick who gets the 100 TV commercial slots?

I only see two options.

1. Give the slots to people who lead in early polls. This favors people who already have a platform and name recognition. Be it existing politicians who are already in office, or maybe celebrities who have huge platform (e.g., 1M Instagram followers). Either way, it would be really hard for me or you to break into such a system.
2. Give the slots to the parties to allocate out. Which might make it fair between the established parties. But, then you cement which parties have a shot at victory because they hold all the slots. Furthermore, you've just turned the party bosses into king makers.

Do you have a 3rd option here?
