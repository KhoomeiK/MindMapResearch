razer,ff7pp75,t1_fcpv6jp,1579655331.0,"I purchased the Nari Ultimate for PC, which I love, until I found out it does not work with the 3.5mm jack on Xbox. So I purchased the Nari Ultimate for Xbox One, but the microphone does not work properly. It requires me to yell in to the microphone in order to have it activate, I can not speak normally. I requested a replacement through Amazon, and it has the same defect. Is there a way to fix this?

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9Pgi2PN-ho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9Pgi2PN-ho) here's an example of me speaking normally, and then having to speak so loudly that my girlfriends mic across the room picked up my voice."

ExpectationVsReality,fezvf7f,t1_fezrklb,1579462166.0,"In this case fifth means a metric fifth, which is a term that doesn't mean a fifth of a gallon, it means 750 ml. A fifth of a gallon (no longer used today) would be around 757 ml.

Half a fifth would be 375 ml, not 1/10 of a gallon."

JRPG,feixhy7,t3_ep6gkw,1579149936.0,(This is my opinion) No. The Chrono trigger sprites were fantastic as is. The character portraits felt off compared to the in game sprites. I don't think it would feel like the same game.
