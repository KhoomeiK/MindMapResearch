It's just lashing out because they're not getting what they want when they want it.  It's completely irrational and immature, but also so on-brand for the stereotypical old school nerd.  It's not as if a company the size of WotC has a single production pipeline.  And they have Hasbro's market analytics available as well.  If they had identified a sufficient demand for Dragonlance in the market, they'd have a product ready for it.  

But there's a reason why some people are on the consumer side of the market and not the production side."

They just never learned most of the rules in the first place.  Everything they did was essentially using the rules as a kind of vague prompt for a very on-rails story without engaging with DND as a game.  

I'm not going to say they ""should have done"" this or that.  They did what they did and got a great podcast out of it, which is what they were looking for.  In that respect, they did nothing wrong.

The intent of DND, though, is that it's a machine.  You dump in variables and see what comes out.  It's not a story-telling game and it's not designed to facilitate a narrative with a planned outcome.  However, it's perfectly fine to use a thing in ways it wasn't intended if you're happy with the result."

>2. The ""Matt Mercer Effect/Vox Machina Effect"" has been discussed by the D&D community a lot lately. Often this has a more negative context, and Mercer himself has responded to a few Reddit posts about it, but I wanted to know the CR community's take. Do any of you often find that your experience with the game doesn't quite live up to your expectations? If that's the case, what are some things you or others in your games have done to bridge the gap?  
>  
>3. On a personal level, when EGtW comes out, I'd assume that most will be looking for games in that particular setting. What are some ways that a DM who is inexperienced with it might help make an enjoyable experience for newer players?

If 2 is not a problem at your table, 3 should not be a problem either.  Making sure you don't have players looking for a rehash of CR should be something sorted out in session 0.  You're not a Critical Role tour guide, and if they can't deal with that, they need to find another table.

Wildemount/Exandria is a fairly typical fantasy DND world.  Mostly the setting is derived from published settings in terms of races and cosmology, with some minor tweaks.  The politics of the world aren't very complex.  The players travel around constantly, so no place is really developed at a granular level (from the viewer's POV).  The setting is mostly backdrop for the character drama.

The Tal'Dorei setting they did with Green Ronin had plenty of setting info for places Vox Machina never went, and I have to imagine that the Wildemount setting will expand on that feature even further.  If you want to give yourself wiggle room, get a synopsis of the show and don't set your campaign in the major cities that the Mighty Nein spend any significant amount of time in.  It'll give you the freedom to fill in the empty spaces."

Coffee,fdpr5hm,t3_emmk5r,1578637353.0,"Beans in a sealed valve bag will easily last that long.  They won't be at peak freshness, but they are perfectly safe to use.

Here's the thing about expiration dates on dry grocery.  They're kind of arbitrary.  Manufacturers are required to include them on labels, but dry grocery will typically last far beyond the date on the package, especially if the package is factory sealed and unopened.  The dates are chosen on the unnecessarily safe end of the spectrum to minimize consumer complaints and returns.  This is even more true of the terms like ""best by"" or ""freshest by.""  It protects the brand.  The flavor will diminish long before it becomes unsafe.   It also doesn't hurt that most consumers will throw away anything past the date on the label and buy a new package, even if the old package is still good. 

Also, many packages on perishables have the term ""sell by,"" which is not an expiry at all.  That date is the last date that retailers are supposed to sell the perishable product, while still providing the typical consumer time to use the product before it goes bad.

When a product actually does expire on a listed date, something like meat, you will generally see a label say something like ""consume or freeze by.""

mattcolville,fdkehqf,t3_elun42,1578502159.0,"While I personally don't like restricting checks based on proficiency, there actually *is* official precedent in 5e - it's just not in the ability check rules.  The basic padlock found in the adventuring gear table requires proficiency with thieves' tools to pick.  So if that's the way you wanna roll, that's your in.

Personally though, I favor the approach of gating the knowledge itself rather than the check.  Tag some of your notes as common knowledge and some as esoteric lore that could only be attained through study.  This gives everyone the chance to get at least a little something.

Vis-a-vis making a player contextualize their roll, it's worth noting that the rules technically grant the power to call for ability checks solely with the DM.  The players are expected - by the book -  to state what their character does and for the DM to determine whether and what type of ability check is necessary to accomplish the task, or whether its even possible, so there's also a built-in foundation for making players contextualize ability checks."
