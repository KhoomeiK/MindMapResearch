Oh, I would say _the vast majority of men_ aren't able to enjoy what _the vast majority of women_ enjoy in terms of sexual freedoms.

A bit of personal experience:

I am built like a linebacker. Well over six feet tall. 50-inch chest, 36-inch waist. My muscles have muscles. While I would never be Jason Momoa’s stunt double, I do come reasonably close. And I’m early into my sixth decade on this rock.

So what affects me? _My face._ I look like I was at the wrong end of a run-in with a diesel locomotive travelling at maximum speed. _My face frequently frightens the fuck out of children._

This has highlighted the disparity of male success by virtue of my job: I am a programmer. As such, most of my work is done remotely, and if I converse, it is over video conferencing. Most people don’t see my full physique, they only see my face.

So when it’s time to put in an appearance at headquarters, _the rest of me tends to turn a hell of a lot of heads_. Many of whom are absolutely gobsmacked at my physique, and - _especially_ among the females - suddenly pay _a lot more positive personal attention to me_.

So I have seen things from both sides of the fence: as a regular man would, in terms of my interactions through remote conferencing, and as a Chad when making an appearance in person, when my full physical stature is present to drench the panties. Hell, I have had _the 2iC of HR violate fraternization policy and slip me her phone number._ She is _married_ and has three kids. _I could have destroyed her career in an instant,_ and all she could think of was to chase the tingle.

Trust me when I say that I really, really feel for the vast majority of guys out there. I was blessed with the ability to easily sculpt my body into something that a lot of women can’t help but to throw themselves at (to say nothing of my net worth… which I keep well hidden to avoid an even _bigger_ headache), but I was also given the gift of being able to implement a filter (my face) to fully appreciate the fickle and hypocritical nature of women.

MGTOW2,ff2b9ag,t1_fey27fw,1579499437.0,"This, exactly.

Chasing pussy and ignoring yourself is what leads to a hollow life. I have been without a sexual partner since my wife died. For the first few years it really bugged me. I had a _very_ healthy sex life with my wife, and dropping to zero threw me for a loop. But I am the kind of person who only has sex with someone whom I truly love, so one-night stands and fuck-buddies are just not my thing. Then as I got back into dating and started understanding the state of women out there, my desire to deal with these kinds of people started to dwindle. I tried to satisfy myself with porn, but all it did was scratch the itch... it did nothing for the soul. I eventually even gave up porn as a bad idea... for me, _personally_. 

Turning inward and finding peace and solitude within myself is what did it for me. Do I still wish my wife was alive? _Of course_ I do. She was no NAWALT, but she was as close to one as I could have ever hoped for. We could have easily had one of those storybook marriages that survived the test of time. But as it is, I am about has happy as I could possibly expect to be without her.

And at my age (I just stuck my toe into my sixth decade on this rock), that’s fine with me. I have a reasonably satisfying life, good friends (even as a loner), a career that challenges me (even though I am set for life) and a plan for watching civilization collapse in relative comfort (relatively speaking, depending on how fast ecological collapse and economic instability does us in).

Specifically, yes. In general, it gets a lot more complicated than that.

Empty calories factor a lot into weight gain. Calories from simple raw foods generally do not.

Loading up on carbs is a great way to have an energy boost, but it’s like running an engine on pure methanol - eventually all your seals and rubber hoses will liquify.

Some of the best diets have been shown to be those that are classified as low carb, high fat. Especially those high in healthy fats from nuts, fish, meats (lard), dairy, olives, avocados and other sources. Those bad fats, such as vegetable oils (corn, canola, soybean, cottonseed, sunflower, etc.), margarine, palm oil and other such sources, should be avoided as thoroughly as possible because they tend to be so pervasive in all packaged foods… unless 100% of what you eat comes from your garden, you already get more than enough of these oils from the packaged foods you buy.

The importance of good fats cannot be overstated, as they let you feel full for longer and give you more energy over a longer time frame. They also properly prime the body’s fat reserves to help you control your blood sugar and food cravings, and help combat metabolic disorders better.

The most important and effective foods to eat are those which have been processed the least. Essentially, most everything you have to put together from scratch. Those foods which have been highly processed - typically in easy to use and easy to consume packages - should be cut completely out of your life because they usually have large amounts of sugar, have far less nutrition (or a badly skewed nutritional profile) and are likely to contain a lot of the bad fats.

The difficulty is that foods with a large degree of processing is often difficult to distinguish from more unprocessed foods. Take dairy. Non-homogenized is by far the best, because its fats have been least affected by processing, while UHT/HPP milk has been extensively processed for long shelf life and should be avoided for having much lower nutritional value. Yogurt with high fat contents are also ideal, but beware “low-fat” yogurt, which needs to be fortified with extra sugar just to avoid tasting like ass.

In the end, it is possible to consume fewer calories than someone else, yet still gain weight while they lose. The difference comes down to the contents and the “rawness” of the food (it’s degree of processing) and the fats that are in that food."

The rate at which women divorce men who make less than them is an entire order of magnitude higher than the average divorce rate. Which is already sitting at 50% for the first 10 years, assuming a first marriage. And women initiate 80+% of all divorces.

Why? Women instinctually look for providers, to the point where it is very difficult for a man who earns less to _avoid_ being sexually castrated in her mind as a non-male. It’s not even her, directly - it’s millions of years of evolution working at the subconscious scale. She doesn’t even realize it’s not her own conscious decision.

dataisbeautiful,fdhkhpc,t1_fdhe8so,1578424567.0,"Monogamy was also a way to get “buy-in” from men to contribute to the building and maintaining of civilization itself.

When men have no prospects for marriage and offspring, they are likely to fuck off and do their own thing, because why should they contribute to a system that gives nothing back in return? A strong and self-sufficient man can carve out a rather comfortable life for himself without needing the framework of civilization.

When they have those prospects of marriage and offspring, they are going to work hard in order to provide for them, and they contribute generously to the system because it is that system that keeps his wife and offspring safe, happy and healthy. A man with a wife and children _needs_ a healthy civilization to assist because he cannot be everywhere at once in order to provide and protect.

The latter is what drives economies and improves society. The former is what causes civilization to stagnate and crumble, as there are few who are incentivized to maintain and improve it.

Unfortunately, our civilization is going down the path of the former condition, as feminism has destroyed almost all incentives for men to marry and build families. The marriages that do still occur are more a result of cultural inertia than anything else - more and more men have done the math, and are just walking away from such entanglements and refusing to marry because of the massive negative-sum outcomes involved.

TL;DR: increasing numbers of men are realizing that the juice just isn’t worth the squeeze anymore. And it has dire consequences for modern civilization in the long term (50+ years)."

Over 80% of divorces are initiated explicitly by the woman. Again, _this is their decision_, and yet men are at fault for it and made responsible for it.

Yes, a small proportion of those divorces are women having been in bad relationships, but the vast majority of those divorces come as complete surprises to the men, who have no idea that anything is “wrong”. Because most men don’t consider falling out of love or being bored in the relationship as sufficient reason to initiate a divorce - it’s _in our nature_ as fixers and builders and problem-solvers to work on the relationship and correct the issue. So many of us are completely blindsided when women suddenly make up theirs minds and want out at all costs; to jump ship for reasons that almost all men would consider petty, juvenile, immature, and downright selfish.

As such, I wouldn’t touch a divorced woman with a 10m barge pole.

AskMen,fdg5zt3,t3_ekxy2r,1578381400.0,"It all comes down to fertility.

Men are fertile their entire adult life.

Women have _maximum_ fertility for only a decade and a bit, between the ages of 16 and 28. While women can still have children well into their 40s and beyond, their ability to _become_ pregnant at 40 is about 2% the probability than when they are 18. Or in other words, a woman has to make 50 times the effort to get pregnant at 40 than she would have had to at 18. And at 40, fertility is plummeting, _fast_.

Ergo, if a man is looking to start a family, he is best served by examining young women for potential mates. Since this is also an important evolutionary requirement, it also ends up being programmed into men, and as such most men are not directly aware that the women they tend to find most physically attractive lie within this 16-28 year old band. They may find older women attractive as well, but they unconsciously reach out most readily to women who are young, visibly healthy and presumably fertile. This happens to all men regardless of how old they are.

The flip side is most readily seen in women of your own age. Since women who are about to become mothers need resources for motherhood, they instinctively look for men who have resources. Who has resources? Not _young_ men… _older_ men! In general, it is older men who have accumulated the experience and resources to easily support people other than himself. This is why young women between the ages of 18 and 24 tend to ignore most men between the ages of 20 and 28… these men have not yet accumulated the resources needed to become effective providers, so they are “functionally useless” from an evolutionary perspective. Older men is where it’s at, which is why women generally date up in terms of both resources and age. It is rare for a woman to be attracted to a man who is noticeably less wealthy than she is, or noticeably younger than she is, especially when she is in her prime childbearing years."

""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind"" - Ghandi

Forcibly taking the land back at this late stage is to punish the child for the sins of the grandfather. It exists only in a framework of revenge, spite, anger, and malicious punishment.

An additional problem that existed was the speed of the handover. Not only were the current stewards not properly compensated for the time, effort and money that they put into the resource, but the land was handed over to the people least capable of leveraging the resources at the scale needed for the country as a whole to properly benefit.

You don’t build a breadbasket that can feed an entire continent by employing backyard farmers, you do so at scale using industrial-scale agriculture. Problem is, virtually none of the people given the “repatriated” land had the education or experience to do this, and none were given the resources - _large_ tracts of land, machinery, funding - to actually do so. As such, the entire plan took Zimbabwe from the shining jewel of Africa to being its starving beggar within the span of just a few short years.

Successful handovers of that scale take _decades_, if not _centuries_, to allow for the effective transfer of knowledge and skills through inter-farmer mentorship and guidance; to say nothing of the ability to patiently evaluate the process as it is implemented over many years, and to make subtle changes and improvements as time goes on."

No, toxic masculinity arises from the enforcement of specific behaviours and reactions on the man’s side through punishments and rewards imposed by women. In aggregate, women _highly value_ the traits defined by Toxic Masculinity, and _explicitly seek those kinds of men out_ for short-term sexual relationships. It’s why “dark-triad sociopaths” and unrepentant assholes are like catnip for the vast majority of women out there. Toxic masculinity only affects female outliers such as yourself in a second-hand, knock-down fashion; much like a blow-back. You experience this blow-back when the vast majority of men have been conditioned to accept only women who behave that certain way, and you do not.

Unfortunately, the conditioning being imposed on men is so thorough and absolute, that any man who deviates from the conditioning and tries to go their own way is often widely mocked, derided and shamed by society, to the point where few women want anything to do with him because he isn’t following _any_ approved script. Ergo, the punishments for deviation are harsh. Women have learned to keep men (in general) on a very short behavioural leash.

Plus, the term “toxic masculinity” is a weasel term that - especially when in the hands of the female supremacists - is subject to a lot of moving goalposts in order to serve as an appropriate kudgel for ideological wrong-think suppression and gender control. It _needs_ to be applicable to any situation where a man is either not following the script, or needs to be brought back under social or intellectual control via shaming and ostracization.

> Now that women can work, there is a decline I suspect in this shaming

Hardly. Go onto pretty well any dating venue, examine female profiles, and you will find copious examples of “666 demands” - 6+ feet tall, 6+ inch cock, 6+ figure salary - beneath which if a man finds himself, he need not bother applying regardless of what other virtues he brings to the table. The irony being that most of these profiles offer very little to nothing in return beyond youth and beauty - and often not even that. 

Plus, women are increasingly falling victim to the “apex fallacy” in various forms - from believing that all men are able to find sexual partners as easily as they can, to assuming that men at the bottom of the social strata are just as privileged as those at the top leading to a profound lack of empathy for men who are suffering, to having over 80% of the female population chase after and consider “marriageable” only the top 10-20% of men.

Women are enforcing this toxicity _everywhere_. Not _all_ women, but a large enough majority that it is becoming increasingly pointless to find the outlier who doesn’t fit this profile.

I ought to know -- after I was widowed a decade-plus ago, I also tried to find an outlier for a second time in my life. And failed miserably.

You might be different. You might be comfortable making more. You might be the outlier who has no problem with a stay-at-home dad as a husband.

Unfortunately, the _observed actions_ of the vast majority of women out there paint the diametrically opposite picture.

Evolution has crafted men to be innate problem-solvers. While we can be every bit as emotional as the next person, we are neurologically built to analyze and investigate at a much higher level than women, hence the innate strife that occurs when women have problems - they just want to talk it out, but any man they open up to tends to inordinately frustrate them with incessant problem-solving. That’s not what women want, but _that’s how men are built_.

What I am trying to say is that men also approach relationships - and their ability to successfully enter into one and hold onto one - as a problem to be logically and rationally solved. So they observe the actions of women in the world around them, in their own relationships as well as the relationships of others, and react accordingly.

When men display “toxic masculinity” by refusing to earn less or be a homemaker, they are reacting very logically and rationally to the incentives that women - in aggregate - place on those actions. Just look at every famous or well-employed man who ‘fell from grace’ in terms of wealth or power, and you will find that the vast majority of them were hit by a range of issues, from /r/DeadBedrooms and infidelity to full-on divorce, all initiated _by the woman_, at about or just after the fall. Former New York Mayor Rudi Giuliani’s election loss is one prominent example that comes to mind. A large number of professional sports players also experience this when they retire; more so if the retirement is an early forced one due to unrecoverable injury. Any man who has been employed in an industry that sees wild multi-year cyclical swings in career success will be stuffed to the gills with such examples; if not from personal experience, then from his co-workers.

Many to most men will absolutely refuse to earn less or be a homemaker because _they have seen with their own eyes_ the highly negative-sun consequences that women wield and punish men with under those circumstances.

TL;DR: the vast majority of “toxic masculinity” is structured and enforced by women and their reactions to men’s circumstances and behaviour. Don’t blame men - _blame your own gender_."

A tiny proportion of guys who say this may actually mean it. But for the most part, this is a cover; a misdirection.

In reality, they are afraid that their wife would see them as no longer being “masculine enough” to be attractive and sexually desirable. This statement that you have received, therefore, is a _plausible excuse_, a red herring designed to avoid upsetting the woman by hiding the truth from her - that marital instability is highest when [the man is not working and/or is shouldering the majority of the home duties](https://www.mic.com/articles/150146/money-problems-divorce-common-relationship-problems-men-breadwinners-stay-at-home-dads).

Women just cannot tolerate a man who does not exhibit traditionally masculine traits (family breadwinner, etc.), or employs traditionally feminine traits (homemaker, etc.) when they are capable of masculine ones."
AskMen,fcoxsju,t1_fcownxu,1577844529.0,"> What he didn't consider is that men can be falsely accused of rape, without it being proven false by external investigators. They can also be falsely accused of rape, but not to the police. Such accusations can and do still have incredibly damaging effects on a man's life, however.

_Exactly_. The vast majority of false accusations do their damage long before law enforcement ever gets involved, assuming the attention of law enforcement was even ever a part of the plan in the first place. As such, a large chunk of these false accusations are never recorded, but the men suffer the consequences anyhow.

The court of public opinion is particularly harsh in this regard - men are guilty until proven innocent, and _women never lie_."
AskMen,fcow5dr,t1_fcnhrux,1577843212.0,"It’s not a matter of standards, it’s a matter of millions of years of evolutionary psychology, and choosing the sperm donor that has the best chance of either providing resources (being a strong asshole), or genes that produce successful sons (more strong assholes).

That’s why so many women fall into this strategy, and why being a dark-triad sociopath and asshole ensures you always have women flocking to you.

Granted, this is just short-term strategy. Two years, tops, until the woman has recovered from childbirth and can start foraging on her own again. Which is why such relationships never last anyhow: they were never meant to last. And as such, this strategy breaks down in the face of modern expectations.

Long-term/life-long relationships are a shockingly modern invention that is designed to encourage non-alphas to “buy into” building and maintaining civilization. Without this framework that assures even low-value men a chance to contribute to the gene pool and have offspring, what prevents them from just farking off and doing their own thing? Nothing. Which is why our civilization is on the verge of another collapse."

Now you need to learn how to sleep in that bed.

The mark of an adult is taking personal responsibility for the consequences of your actions. I see none of that in your post; nothing whatsoever. You are solipsism personified, trying desperately to put the genie back in the bottle long after the bottle has shattered. News flash: it’s not gonna work."
collapse,fckzz5b,t3_ehmlgg,1577736826.0,">	Can we make up for lost time?

No. In general, not a fucking chance in hell.

Now, we _can_ make a difference between complete extinction of the human race (and the ultimate worst case, a Venus Scenario snuffing out _all_ planetary life) and _merely_ a massive crash in the human population of upwards of 80% and a reversion to the Iron Age.

Of the two, I know which one I would rather see."
