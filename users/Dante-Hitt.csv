Meditation,ff821td,t1_ff1yxhw,1579663935.0,"I see where you’re going with this and it’s a great question.

It’s not solely about not being reactive, it’s primarily about getting present to the moment and unplugging from thinking altogether.

Which is incredibly challenging because that’s our MAIN addiction.

Addiction being something we can’t stop doing.

People have extremely poor focus because, if you think about it, they’re almost like drug addicts.

Breaking that addiction to thought, ripping out the old neurological hardwiring and reconditioning a new way of thinking and feeling is how we create real transformation.

So a meditation with breathing and guiding you to be present is what I’d recommend and then read or consume empowering material.

But then the discussion shifts toward are we making real progress to our goals are just making “busy work” lol

Does that answer your question?"

I would add look into “Certified Health Nut” to learn about breath work which I’m learning more about now.

Wim Hof for breathwork and cold therapy is another amazing person.

Elliot Hulse is another great teacher for strength / mindset.

Changing my diet was another big help.

Cutting out meat and processed foods really gave me more energy and helped calm things.

“The Game Changers” documentary on Netflix is a good one or the “Transcendent” series on Gaia.

I would start saying “I choose” to do this either everything and see how that feels.

Instead of “I need to” or “I have to” which implies powerlessness and no control.

It’s subtle but it helps.

And baby step it.

There’s thousands of things I choose to do every day.

Beginning them is the most important part.

Finishing them, well.. I leave that to the Creator ;) 

I have journaled in the past but it never stuck.

I’ve heard people experience great success from journaling though and writing down their habitual negative thoughts which in part answers your last question.

If you can write down the negative thoughts (I’ll do this in the notes section of my phone when I’m especially irritated or anxious), you begin to see how repetitive and destructive they are.

Catch yourself and ask “Do I feel at ease?”

If the answer is no, we’re in survival / fight or flight mode.

The books really help here because they help you understand what’s happening under the surface vs. being whiplashed around emotionally this way and that.

Also, I’ve realized that when things seem to get worse... it’s because we’re attached to a particular outcome or desire.

The mind loves to try to control how something unfolds.

But the best epiphanies and realization come out of nowhere and surprise us.

Less control = more happiness.

It’s a weird paradox but one I’ve found to be true.

Whenever I start resisting the present moment, I remind myself that it’s always preceded by some breakthrough or moment of great clarity :)

Does this help?"

“The greatest gift we can give anyone is our own happiness.” 

Selfishness gets a bad wrap but it’s actually a great thing.

You have to put the mask on when the airplane is going down so you can help the person next to you with theirs.

If we don’t fill our own cup, we’re going to be running from person to person asking them:

“Can you fill my cup? Can you fill my cup? Can you fill my cup?”

But the only person who can do that is yourself.

We can derive pleasure in this world (pleasure = things outside of you that give you good emotions) but they’ll never truly make us happy. If it’s outside of us, it will eventually lead to suffering.

We have to rely on joy (joy = things inside you that give you good emotion).

We have to regulate our own emotions.
