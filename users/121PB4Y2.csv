farmingsimulator,fe6je1z,t3_enphoq,1578892809.0,"A few comments (played FS98 through 2004 and will likely buy the new game). 

Terrain: the terrain mesh isn’t really detailed. There are paid third party add-ons that use airplane or satellite imagery for specific regions, but generally speaking, it’s low quality. 

Buildings and cities aren’t detailed. With some exceptions (NYC, Chicago) that have quite a few buildings, and some have just famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Space Needle, etc.

Airports aren’t detailed either. They have the real layout but are typically just generic buildings, some have jetways and some don’t. That’s up to third party developers to develop (usually paid).

Now the fun part. The more stuff you add, the heavier the game gets and the requirements are. Granted, these days it’s hard to Max it out because FSX was developed around 2006-7, so even a GT330 is way newer than that. IIRC, FSX will run better using a high clock processor without regard for cores, as it was released when dual core processors were just coming out. 

In terms of gameplay, it’s a whole different story, and it’d be pretty exhausting to play LS in the same scale and time, as you could easily spend 8 hours plowing a single field. In FS you can spend 17 hours flying a single flight but it’s mainly monitoring systems and doing ATC handoffs (and taking screenshots), and autopilot does the actual flying. Meanwhile you can catch up on homework, swipe on tinder, etc. When flying a large plane the bulk of the work is takeoff and landing. If you buy the super realistic add-nos (as much as $60 for an airplane) you might even have to do the whole procedure to start as required by the real plane (fuel valves, AC packs, APU, electrical settings, etc) and that’s where part of the fun is."

I had to deal with that back in 2010-2012 in Mexico, best I could get was 2/0.2, and Telmex automatically upped the connection to 4/0.4 and all hell broke loose. Abnormal packet loss, dropped connections, latency all over the place. After many calls to the helpdesk I got one girl who must have been an engineer because she was the first one to ask me to check the SNR and some other values, and said she'd have to send a tech. Tech said I was too far away from their box thingy and the cable probably in bad shape, so dropping to 2/0.2 would solve it for now, as the company wasn't going to fix the copper lines since they were going to roll fiber out in the city during the next year or so.

Right now I go through a WISP (basically a reseller) and a P2P link because I'm a few miles after the last telephone pole, and there aren't enough people in my area for the ISPs to justify the cost of bringing fiber.  Roughly 20/20 most of the time, so I can't complain. If I need more, I just use my work internet (2x 200/200 on a load balancer)."
DataHoarder,fdeboft,t1_fde92kv,1578335509.0,"Yeah, the idea behind Deep Glacier is that you *won't retrieve* that stuff unless it's absolutely necessary, but if your main data set + the backup both died due to an abnormally high solar flare when Mercury was in gatorade, then it'll be cheaper to pay to retrieve the AWS info than to try to pay for data recovery."
DataHoarder,fde6x3h,t1_fddi3cq,1578332512.0,"Jesus, that's what I used to get on a bad day, using a 3G modem in rural Mexico. So instead of watching YT at home I'd go to Starbucks and download a few GB at a time and then went home to watch it.

Even CableOne offered 5/0.5 in rural Arizona, circa 2013 (Or 50/5 but it came with a data cap)."
DataHoarder,fde650q,t1_fdd7vd4,1578332022.0,"Somebody did the math, B2 works out up to 50 or 100 TB, not sure. At least that's when considering a new LTO7 or 8 drive, much less if you're getting a surplus LTO4 or 5 drive.

AWS Deep Glacier is cheaper, $1/TB/mo, supposedly that uses tape on their end, so the retrieval times are around 12h."

* Iron Mountain.
* The Colo.

While I don't know for sure, it seems like Iron Mountain does work with small volumes too, so theoretically it's possible to store a Bankers Box with a Pelican case full of LTO tapes or hard drives for not a lot of money."

thinkpad,fcznuqn,t1_fcy2jfc,1578105325.0,"14"" is the largest you can use when sitting in regular economy class. 15"" might be doable if you wear 30"" or smaller pants, but if the person in front of you reclines their seat, your screen and/or hinges will end up shattered.

There is a market for larger machines, but the Carbon/Yoga do not target that market. I assume a 16"" X1 Extreme is doable, but again, not exactly the same market."

The 2019 XPS13 went one step further and had a soldered SSD, which is stupid because that’s a wear part. They backtracked on that but not the RAM (to use LPDDR4)."

sysadmin,fcumhr8,t1_fctoord,1577984184.0,"I do that. I was never taught that shift+letter capitalizes so for years I toggled caps lock on and off and I just got used to it (took me maybe 8 years or so of daily computer use to discover it). At this point I have to make a conscious effort to not do that and use shift instead.

Starting to use shift more and more because on my daily laptop (9.5 yo) the caps lock key seems to be losing it's sensitivity so it takes more effort to recognize the key press."
