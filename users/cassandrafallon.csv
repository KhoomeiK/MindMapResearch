fatlogic,fezg428,t1_fez3hu9,1579456965.0,Almond milk! Cuts the cals way down and quite a few coffee chains now have it. I do cashew milk at home and buy the torani sugar free syrups on amazon. Giant iced salted caramel latte for like 30 cals.
fatlogic,few4md8,t1_fevlva7,1579405287.0,"Speaking as someone who spent the majority of their life with an eating disorder, that brand of mental illness turns a lot of weird shit into both positive and negative inspiration. I remember watching this fashion show in high school that also featured a kids line and spending DAYS specifically hating my legs because there was some model who looked about 10 years old who‚Äôs thigh gap I was jealous of. It‚Äôs not about hating fat people, it‚Äôs about being fucking mentally ill."

fatlogic,feowo61,t1_feovr0q,1579307015.0,"If you time a buffet right and make it work for all your daily cals it‚Äôs great. Sweet Tomatoes/Souplantation is my life when I‚Äôm on vacation since we don‚Äôt have them up in Canada. Coffee for breakfast, late-ish lunch buffet. All the carbs."
EtsySellers,fdz89z4,t3_enb2hx,1578787624.0,Lots of good notes here but one thing I also noticed is your lower priced items have free delivery but the higher priced ones don‚Äôt (I‚Äôm in Canada). I would just build shipping into all my prices so this is even across the board personally. It feels odd to be paying $14 shipping on a $200+ item when even non-Amazon internet shopping usually offers something like ‚Äúfree shipping over $99‚Äù.
fatlogic,fds40ku,t3_emszsq,1578693924.0,"And if thin people wore exclusively tight spandex clothing they would somehow manage to claim that was oppressing them as well. 



Am I also oppressing old men by purchasing vintage men‚Äôs sweaters from thrift stores because I enjoy large cozy things but am a 25 year old woman?"

WWOOF,fdr29um,t3_emsa4z,1578678495.0,"Unfortunately I got into it a few years after my Workaway adventure, but teaching English online can be a workable option depending on wifi available in your area. Palfish doesn‚Äôt require a degree and you can use a phone or tablet, but you do need to get TEFL certified (this certification took me a weekend of time and about $30 via groupon). There‚Äôs a ton of other companies but most want a bachelors degree in anything, several subs dedicated to it. The time change kicked my ass (peak hours worked out to me working like 3am-8am every day in Saskatchewan time, that‚Äôs evenings in Beijing). 




There‚Äôs a few subs dedicated to online ESL, and lots of people do it while they travel. I will say like any job that works with a lot of kids I found it very emotionally draining and it wasn‚Äôt for me. Also just heads up, basically every company offers their teachers a decent bonus for recruiting more teachers right now, so anyone claiming to be a ‚Äúrecruiter‚Äù is probably kind of full of shit. It‚Äôs not a pyramid scheme or anything, but a lot of people make a significant portion of their income from finding teachers instead of actually teaching (again, the hours suck for North America so I get that, I just get annoyed when people aren‚Äôt upfront about it)."
fatlogic,fdhy7fl,t3_elhicv,1578432318.0,"Once again, the advice given to under weight anorexics trying to recover is not applicable to everyone üôÑ"
fatlogic,fdaxjp5,t3_ekd3yk,1578251569.0,"I mean, I used to tell myself if I ever hit 200 lbs I would kill myself. Because I was a severely depressed teenage girl with an eating disorder who‚Äôs weight had never been over 165 lbs (and that was literally having weighed myself directly after a binge). That had everything to do with my own shit and an arbitrary number I would never actually hit. 




My mental illness is about me not you Karen."
FIREyFemmes,fcsyh25,t1_fcse4bf,1577928282.0,"Tbh the pay isn‚Äôt amazing but I used to teach chinese kids English online in the early hours of the morning for extra cash. You can get certified as a english as a second language teacher for under $30, some companies also require a degree in anything some don‚Äôt. Might be a temporary option just for an additional slush fund? Pay varies but is usually somewhere between $12-19 USD/hour."
ThriftStoreHauls,fckwtve,t3_ehejf7,1577734898.0,This whole vibe is amazing and I want to live in it.
fitbit,fckwk6k,t3_ehhbo8,1577734736.0,"I have an Alta HR I bought last year and am still very happy with, and I‚Äôve seen them lately on local buy and sell groups for like $40-50 since people updated for Xmas. Go with what‚Äôs in your price range to get started and upgrade later if you fall in love."

FrugalFemaleFashion,fch3lnx,t3_eh32qj,1577646928.0,"It‚Äôs more useful to spend $60 on something quality that lasts and actually works for your life, as opposed to buying $20 shoes that aren‚Äôt comfortable and need to be replaced much sooner. Admittedly not everyone is in the position to spend the larger amount of money upfront and that‚Äôs a whole other issue, but this still counts as frugal in my book!"
32dollars,fbriv4q,t1_fbpg92h,1577043241.0,"Honestly I just kind of eyeball and taste as I go but basically 



Approximately 3-4 cups prepared chickpeas (canned is faster but I try to make the effort to soak and cook dry ones because they‚Äôre so freakin cheap)



1/4 cup ish of tahini



Big ole squirt of lemon juice 



All the garlic. Amount will vary greatly if you use fresh vs powder, again, go by taste



Dash of salt & pepper 



Big ole sprinkle of smoked paprika. 


From there I blend in food processor, see how the texture is, usually have to add some water, blend again, taste, season as needed, maybe add a smidge of olive oil (I usually just put a bit of oil on with a sprinkle of paprika when I serve because aesthetic)"
