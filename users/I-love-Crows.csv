narcissism,ff7sp60,t3_eoetd0,1579657425.0,"im not really sure if therapy works but I do know there are therapists that can work around your schedule pretty smoothly. I used to meet with mine every thursday and Saturday but I've recently distanced myself from it- make sure to be careful about what you let them know you never know when they might try and throw you in a ward or something because they believe you're a danger to yourself or others  


That's why I left mine because I really couldn't even get to the root of my issues because a lot of the time I couldn't answer truthfully"
narcissism,ff55z5a,t3_eir9mb,1579581186.0,"Kinda by getting into competitive sports and activities and realizing that my behaviors, reactions, and feelings towards others were out of line with most of my peers.

Also by arguing a lot and telling people how I feel about them along with turning on people. A lot of people just called me a narcissist but I didn't really care I just felt I was right and actually began to love being called a narcissist because it was like them admitting they couldn't beat me without resorting to losing composure and doing some name calling

Then my therapist told me he actually suspected the same along with some other suspicions"
narcissism,ff55hbd,t3_ekql3l,1579580785.0,"Did before but I mostly turned those feelings into outward anger towards the people, space, and world around me

You learn to make due"
logodesign,ff553b4,t1_feyutzc,1579580474.0,Gonna have to suggest you stick it with that one- thanks for the feedback! :D

narcissism,fewlv7l,t3_el2tqv,1579414013.0,"At one point yeah? But now not really-

Besides as of recent I've sorta realized that I'd really be changing myself for everyone else's sake. That at the of the day the only reason my narcissism is an ""issue"" is because everyone else sees it as a problem 

So it's just sorta evolved into a fuck everyone mentality. Like why am I changing because boo hoo I'm making your life harder and  I'm such a meanie and I wanna be number 1 

So that ontop of anger and violent mood swaps and depression too much shit to fix, too many fucks to give, and not enough money to spend"
narcissism,fewldan,t3_eo7evw,1579413507.0,"Not most of the time 

I try and keep my ""people I fucking care about"" circle to a minimum-  even when I seem to care it usually fades and having them around still attached to me is a fucking burden 

So a very lucky few I do give a shit about but most others are just about camel spit or temporary charms"

SuicideWatch,few9psa,t3_eqp3yo,1579407250.0,"Yes! I love this post! We have dignified life's injustice, pain, and cruelty plenty of times before with our tears and mosery. You and I have experienced it once, twice, and I you will again again- the same agony brought upon us with different cruelties so why not laugh for these moments as we have already paid for our woes and paying for them once more will not make us any less doomed :D"
SuicideWatch,few5j3l,t3_eqp6ad,1579405709.0,"Well I feel like the monotonous drag of life just hits people different and for different reasons- a lot of people simply feel that another run in with it is inevitable and that's just way things are 

We simply weigh how much the potential of our lives are worth against the reoccurrence of the cycle and well when we figure it's no longer worth it despite the potential jackpot we vanish! 

I think it helps to think of life as ours to banish rather than a person to lose, because through this lens I find dying isn't really a bad thing and choosing to die is inturn even more acceptable as if simply throwing something you no longer have much need for in the garbage! This doesn't imply it's exactly a pleasant thing rather just neutral

In short living just doesn't appeal to many of us here- I'm no different I focus on maintaining at a certain level of emotional stability as I wait for my chance to turn in my ticket 

I hope this helps you understand! Or atleast understand how I feel from my perspective! Great question friend :)"
SuicideWatch,few40uk,t3_eqnkaj,1579405042.0,I hope for you to pass smoothly and painlessly- I send all my love and wish for  you find the relief you need when it's all over my friend ‚òπÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
SuicideWatch,few1atf,t3_eqmurw,1579404047.0,"Don't worry about it Chuck, it's all gravy. Listen we live in a world where people just spit out kids because well it felt like that's what they were supposed to do- 

it's no shocker that a good lot of us just aren't built for this life and that's alright, it's all in how you choose to accept it 

You can take the route of somehow believing life and struggles are supposed to be some big test for well who knows 

Or you can just look at yourself and decide well you're weak. There really is no wrong answer! Personally I'm a weakling but that's okay since my time is limited anyways! :D"
SuicideWatch,fevz43u,t3_eqgy8d,1579403290.0,Exactly this! Nothing has ever been so appealing but to think about just slipping away into a lifelong coma or something and just y'know literally live the dream lol

Cleveland,fdn267o,t1_fdn1nxo,1578575028.0,"Like I said plenty of exploration on my part

But I will say you're right- there are venues and clubs but I will have to say that the smaller scale definitely hurts things. I've seen all sorts of places around our country and it all just seems to speak more- idk could be size or rep or etc. Who knows  

I think the most fun I've had here is me and my friends launching fireworks at each other"
Cleveland,fdn1y0f,t1_fdn12om,1578574821.0,"Oh yeah, as mentioned me and a few other family members like to try and spin out some of our own nicknames for the place. It's fun 

On another note when it's not blisteringly cold I do nothing but go out and look for stuff to get into- it's just that nothing really seems alive or really my age group's idea of entertainment"
Cleveland,fdmznzi,t1_fdmza5k,1578572620.0,"Well I think skating was my big thing then. I had to be around 8-9ish and finding spots on cool pieces of archetecture to skate off was dope

But otherwise I think it was all the forests and nature in my backyard- making Lego villages, always being able to go out, and poking at snakes with sticks and stuff. Charlotte was great for getting into some childhood fuckshit"
Cleveland,fdmnlmk,t3_elzxla,1578556949.0,"Well we had LeBron but he left to be on a contender (im surprised he came back in the first place after that humiliating display Cle fans put on after he left for Miami)

Now? Nothing really besides being the butt of everyone's jokes when it comes to towns

Cleveland clinic is some of the best medical care in the country

Oh also the city has been known for a good amount of movies like avengers and a Christmas story most notably

And it's place Superman was made but no one really talks about anything beyond the sports since the rest is rather like fun trivia than defining city factors"
AskReddit,fbshsxo,t3_ee3b1i,1577055411.0,"I don't know how to properly empathize with others and have a generally bad understanding of people,I have no clue how articulate my feelings or thoughts leading to no one being able to understand or care leading me to a life of bitter half compromises and aggressive behavior as a way to bring out atleast one guaranteed reaction as opposed to everyone stomping over me and treating me as if I were invisible. Atleast in the moments where people hate me they listen to what I have to say instead of simply talking over me- even if it's just to yell back, I don't mind, infact I'm slowly learning to love arguing I believe 

I own being a dick because it is the only thing I can assure people can define me as besides plainly inconsequential. 

In short- i don't know what I want, why I act the way I do, and resent existing at this point"
