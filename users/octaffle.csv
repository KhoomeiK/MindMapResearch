This text explanation starts off sad but gives context for how much these little moments mean to me:

>The Corgi is Waffle. He's 10.5 years old. The kitty is Juniper. She's 4-5 months old and she's a wild beast.

>We lost our young dog last year and Waffle became very depressed. This summer, our little family (including Waffle) finally started to recover emotionally from our devastating loss. Just as things were looking up, Waffle suffered a series of strokes brought on by Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. He recovered unusually well but has been a markedly different dog--more easy-going, more dog-like, easier to please. Despite the mostly positive changes to his personality, he was still noticeably lacking in his old enthusiasm that went away with our young dog.

>We're not ready for another dog yet but Waffle was desperately in need of a friend. My best buddy fosters kittens and we adopted Juniper (foster name: ""Big Salad"" ala Seinfeld) and are raising her as a dog. Everything is working out better than we had hoped. Best of all, Waffle has his old enthusiasm back!

>Thanks to his strokes, he's much less afraid of getting up close to the pointy end of a kitty and that has opened a lot of doors for their relationship. She's been a hoot from the second we brought her home. They play together about an hour a day and have so many delightful, mischievous interactions. Each one makes my heart a little fuller and makes the ache of our loss a little less.

dogs,fco2xdj,t1_fcnsbj7,1577823068.0,"He was fairly accident prone and got knocked in the head more than once, including within a month of the onset of his acute behavior, but the neurologist confirmed that Banjo did NOT have a head/brain injury regardless of what his breeder is telling everyone. 

The injury that tipped him over the edge was from an encounter with a rat in our backyard. He found a rat and was messing with it and I thought he was going to kill it. I've seen Banjo go after stuff in a predatory manner and I was waiting for the prey drive to kick in but it never did. Apparently it only works when the thing is moving fast, and it couldn't move fast in our 10' x 10' backyard. I got him to disengage multiple times and almoooost got him inside but he was like ""OH! THE RAT!"" every time. I did not want to grab him by the collar because there was a high chance he would have redirected onto me, and then I just let him go for it. Got it on video and everything. What's the worst that could happen, right? LOL One less rat, right? I saw him get bit (and it's on video) but I couldn't find a bite anywhere. No blood. Nothin'.  He definitely got bit though.

After 2+ months of escalating behavior, multiple vet appointments, tests and tests, the MRI, research and research and research into aggression... I was convinced the problem was with his mouth. More research... more research... then I was out playing ball with him in the yard and the sun hit his mouth juuust right and I was like ""wtf is that"", took a pic, got some vet friends and a dentist to tell me what area of the mouth that was... somethin' was definitely wrong with his mouth. We went swimming in a salt water pool shortly after and I saw inside his mouth the next day and the swelling had gone down. 

There were two distinct, clean-ish vertical cuts in his mouth back there. Banjo, in his love of carrying long objects in the most incorrect way possible, tried to pick up the rat and had it in his mouth longways, so the head was back near the throat. That motherfuckin' rat bit him in the back of the mouth and I could see where the incisors cut him deep!

Vet didn't believe us but prescribed antibiotics anyway. His acute behavior disappeared within a few days, then we did some serious counter-conditioning to repair his relationship with Waffle. They were best buddies again.

He always had a fairly low threshold for aggression, his aggression was ALWAYS disproportionate to whatever triggered it, he always needed to be stopped because he WAS NOT going to stop on his own... he had some issues. He also always had a very narrow range in which he could comfortably exist. Not too little exercise, but not too much either... fed at just the right time... crated not too soon but not too late... everything had to follow his expectations or he couldn't handle it. Those issues became more severe after the injury. 

I was late home one night in October because I was visiting my *dying grandmother* in the hospital. He was hungry, it was late, he was tired, there was a weird sound outside and he exploded. Full-on murder-mode all over my partner's face. Got a call, left the hospital, brought my partner to the same hospital... We picked chunks of her face off the floor when we got back. Spent an hour scrubbing blood out of the carpet. Found more blood on the walls when we moved out this month. Fun stuff.

So yeah. We were gonna put him down but his breeder came and got him. We still see him sometimes. 

Anyway, when Waffle had his stroke, we saw the same neurologist that was working with Banjo. We told him what Banjo's problem was and that we thought we could see it on Banjo's MRI. He reviewed Banjo's MRI with us again and was like ""oh yeah, look at those ANGRY lymph nodes"" and pointed out some other stuff, haha. He was busy looking for a problem with the brain, not the mouth, so he missed it.

ETA: I typed this whole thing up and I didn't start to cry once. Yay for me! That's progress!"
dogs,fcnh32r,t1_fcndvmi,1577811565.0,"Idk if you've read anything about Banjo but he's not right in the head. We took him to get an MRI to rule out physical causes. No structural or brain abnormalities. The actual ""cause"" of his problem is The Way That He Be, but aggravated by complications from an injury (which, incidentally, is visible on the MRI) that cemented more highly aggressive behavior through learning and repetition and whatnot. Banjo has been with his breeder for over a year now.

This summer, Waffle began stumbling and developed a slight head tilt and generally showed signs of vertigo. We got some meds to treat an ear infection and his symptoms dramatically worsened within hours of seeing the vet. His brother died of similar but more severe neurological symptoms so I opted for an MRI. The vertigo symptoms were caused by strokes in his cerebellum and the thalamus, and the neurologist thought he had seen another minor stroke near the surface of the brain. The strokes were caused by Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. He also has high blood pressure. A month of doxy and permanent blood pressure meds and the neurologist thinks the strokes won't recur. He's recovered remarkably well. He's noticeably different but it might be a good thing, haha."

They quickly stop chirping because they get too wet from his spit/nose and then he stops caring. I've seen ads on facebook for a dog toy like that (ie probably more durable)... but arg, I can't think of the name! 

Maybe a Giggle Ball would pique his interest."

dogs,fbxx90g,t1_fbxx24m,1577202866.0,Thank you for being receptive!  Our sub has a lot of resources on choosing a breeder. [This used to get passed around a lot](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html) but now [there's an extremely detailed one](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/wiki/identifying_a_responsible_breeder) that can give more information and guide your search for a healthy puppy that fits your lifestyle.
dogs,fbxwy16,t1_fbxwhgq,1577202646.0,"Puppy mills aren't just dirty places shoveling out thousands of puppies. They can be one person with one pair of dogs breeding them once or twice a year to make some extra cash. The thing that makes a puppy mill a puppy mill is prioritizing profit over the health/temperament/well-being of the dogs that are produced. This is every breeder that sells certain colors/sexes for more money than others, breeds for ""rare"" colors, lets people choose a puppy based on color, accepts payment for the puppy without talking to you, etc."
dogs,fbxwal7,t1_fbxw6dj,1577202173.0,"If they're advertising mini aussies and not MAS, they're a backyard breeder/puppy mill making money off a trend."
dogs,fbxw1cs,t3_ef2amw,1577201985.0,"If you want a good breeder, you can't call them mini aussies and you can't seek out people selling mini aussies. Only look for Miniature American Shepherd (MAS) breeders. The breed club website is a good place to start: http://mascusa.org/breed/breeders.html"
AnimalsBeingDerps,fbxs1yo,t3_ef1snt,1577198946.0,"Information nobody asked for:

The Corgi is Waffle. He's 10.5 years old. The kitty is Juniper. She's 4-5 months old and she's a wild beast. 

We lost our young dog last year and Waffle became very depressed. This summer, our little family (including Waffle) finally started to recover emotionally from our devastating loss. Just as things were looking up, Waffle suffered a series of strokes brought on by Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. He recovered unusually well but has been a markedly different dog--more easy-going, more dog-like, easier to please. Despite the mostly positive changes to his personality, he was still noticeably lacking in his old enthusiasm that went away with our young dog. 

We're not ready for another dog yet but Waffle was desperately in need of a friend. My best buddy fosters kittens and we adopted Juniper (foster name: ""Big Salad"" ala Seinfeld) and are raising her as a dog. Everything is working out better than we had hoped. Best of all, Waffle has his old enthusiasm back! 

Thanks to his strokes, he's much less afraid of getting up close to the pointy end of a kitty and that has opened a lot of doors for their relationship. She's been a hoot from the second we brought her home. They play together about an hour a day and have so many delightful, mischievous interactions. Each one makes my heart a little fuller and makes the ache of our loss a little less. 

Thanks for sharing this moment with me and my pets, Internet strangers. I hope it brings you even just a fraction of the joy that it brings me."
