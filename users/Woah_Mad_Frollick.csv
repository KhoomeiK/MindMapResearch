1.) It is a good thing for the planet that the global population is beginning to stabilize. It is also, thankfully, inevitable. 

2.) If you could be born in any place, at any time in history, you would have struck the cosmic lottery to be born in 2020s Japan.

geopolitics,ff9xod8,t1_ff7t7k1,1579723751.0,"I personally buy into institutional theories of corruption, which holds up as well in Indonesia as in most other places. 

  
The political institutions of the Indonesian archipelago were incredibly diverse prior to Dutch colonization, with some more inclusive than others. But during the imperial period, all were swept up into an extractive regime, based upon a monopolization of the commodity trade. After the Dutch left, these institutions were wrangled over, but their fundamental characteristics didn't change. 

Suharto had made a bid to industrialize the country, but exporters' state support was never tied to their export success, or their ability to claw their way toward the technological frontier. In essence, the favored corporations became just another vehicle for elite self-enrichment. As Chinese manufacturing capacity kicked into overdrive, Indonesia didn't stand a chance. It has been prematurely deindustrialized. The modest role manufacturing played in the Indonesian economy was mostly replaced with the low-value-added informal sector, predominantly in the slums of the cities. This is a very, very common story for the emerging economies of the late 90s/early 00s. 

The country did profit tremendously from the upswing of the China-driven commodity supercycle of the 2000s, this is not a good basis for achieving widespread prosperity."
geopolitics,ff7704h,t1_fek7l6q,1579642365.0,"I agree the structural reasons for India's underperformance visa vie China is heavily related to education. But I think it's sort of the reverse.

In India, the strategy for human capital formation was to triple-down on higher education. Since Nehru, this was always framed as a component of post-colonial self-reliance (autarky, import-substitution, etc). Political battles are then directed toward University reservations for ST/SC/OBC, instead of the prioritization of secondary ed. itself, which ends up being highly regressive. The focus on secondary education, to the detriment of primary schooling, naturally created dramatic bottlenecks in skills formation. The political economy of the university is the bread and butter of the twice-born Indian middle classes, who defend it ferociously, as it's a large part of how they pass opportunity down to their kids. Obviously, that's not universal, and they don't frame it so abstractly.

Now - in orthodox modernization theory, what's supposed to happen is that vast pools of low-productivity, sub-agrarian peasant labor is plugged into high-value-added non-agrarian enterprise - traditionally industry. This is supposed to happen as societies experience the earlier phases of the demographic transition, giving them population pressures and migratory incentives. The result of all this is supposed to be delivering super-charged growth. And in recent decades, the growth in GDP generated by India's formal, non-agrarian production has indeed been enormous. But this hasn't been matched by growth in the formal non-agrarian workforce.

Many take this to suggest that early, dramatic, and prolonged skills shortages had lead to growth in the capital-intensive, formal, non-agrarian sector. I.e. stuff like tech jobs - which simply don't require a lot of hands on deck to make money. Again - it's the bottleneck. What you end up with is a tripartite economy; the high-skills, highly capitalized formal sector constituting only 7% of employment; the low-skills informal economy of family-run shops, shoemakers, servants, etc, which pulls in manpower from the agrarian sector like a magnet; and the impoverished countryside, where labor is scarce and mechanization needed for barely surviving farmers, who are otherwise employed as farm laborers in larger operations.

So what you end up with is an economy so lopsided that you have a basic consumption problem on your hands, with little ability to plug into industry or global value chains (i.e. an export-led development state). India may have missed the time for it's China-moment. I fear for what this means for it's long-term stability, and it depresses me to think about what alternatives are left.

Anyways - I think the current slump can be more than explained by terrible global liquidity conditions and a strong dollar."

In Gallup's [2009 Coexist Survey](http://www.euro-islam.info/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/gallup_coexist_2009_interfaith_relations_uk_france_germany.pdf), 65% of French Muslims reported viewing homosexuality as morally wrong. In the UK, that number hovered below 100%. Now, anecdotally, I've known plenty of liberal Muslims who do not share that view in the slightest.

Granted, that survey was a decade ago, but the point stands. I *do* think this may be a misleading point of emphasis, because in the early 1990s, 70% of Americans (for example) viewed homosexuality as morally unacceptable. Western societies have undergone truly profound transformations in social values over the last 30 odd years, and yet by making these comparisons we render it invisible. We are comparing centuries-old values to norms only established like 5 seconds ago. This is a simplification - Islamic societies are as culturally dynamic as any other, and the revered Hafez wrote poems about sleeping with dudes all the time, but late developments have lead to a global fundamentalist push. But the point is - one could argue it's *not* conservative Muslims who need explaining - it's the other way around.

I am disappointed by well-meaning, principled liberals who insist that culture doesn't matter when it comes to Islam. It's a reflex against bigotry and racism, and an understandable one. Yes - all people are the same at the core. But people value and believe different things. I won't lie on where I stand - Abrahamic religions, at their worst, are bad thought viruses - mass delusions, doubling as social glue. ""Western"" countries have the *privilege* of not having to deal with the more dire consequences of religion, because it has been so massaged and negotiated down in the course of secularism.

geopolitics,fe43u8v,t1_fe0dkf5,1578855555.0,"Okay... but trace it back a couple of extra steps. Why are so many African institutions extremely extractive and corrupt? 

The answer is twofold; the extremely brutal form of colonialism that took shape in much of Africa (e.g. Belgian Congo, Arab and Atlantic slave trades) and the long-term ""underdevelopment"" of African societies which enabled it. 

And what created that long-term underdevelopment? Primarily the fact that in large swathes of the African continent, there were no good agroecological conditions for stable state formation. Nothwithstanding some major exceptions (Ethiopia), if and when they came, they came late, relative to global standards.

That was mostly good news for African societies for thousands of years, because for most of human history, the state has been the single greatest macroparasite on the human condition (in the words of JC Scott). But as the bootstrap logic of modernity began to kick in, and living conditions, capitalist development, warmaking capacity, etc. took off, many of the continent's stateless societies were sucked into a world that was made by states, for states. 

My point is, such massive questions are going to have multiple overlapping answers. The reason why people don't like just saying ""they're corrupt"" and leaving it at that is that it is a radically incomplete answer. Pointing to colonialism is a justified elaboration, if not the complete story. Because simply stating the issue is corruption reeks of essentialism - and people are instinctively repelled by ideas that sound adjacent to  midcentury theories of ""racial development"". Rightfully so. Not that I think anybody in this thread was suggesting that. 

However, ironically, in my experience most African countries citizens' blame their own societies for corruption. Gesturing towards colonialism is taken to be an excuse for the plundering of the country by it's political elites."

energy,fdthror,t1_fdsdxfc,1578716945.0,"Here's probably the most important point of confusion between us; global emissions are currently *accelerating.* But America's emissions have been basically flat for a few decades. They are projected to remain flat in the near future. And these measures *include* outsourcing value chains, so that a Foxconn factory in a JV with Apple counts as American emissions.

At the same time, many nations of the developing world have achieved skyrocketing growth. Powering this growth is carbon - and particularly lignite coal. That's what's driving the *acceleration.* I don't say this as condemnation or moral judgement, but simply as fact.

So, if American emissions went to zero overnight - we're *still on an accelerating curve.* It just gets bent slightly to the right. This is the difficult thing for Western observers to appreciate - the story of world history no longer clearly begins and ends with them. That period is over. Maybe if we stumble into a tech miracle we share it - of course. But in all likelihood, the resolution to the climate crisis will ultimately be decided in far-off places. I think Western audiences resist that, because deep down in their hearts, they know that tribal voters in rural Chhatisgarh, or CCP bureaucrats in Henan, aren't supposed to *really matter*. Either the West is the superhero or supervillain, but we're not supposed to be *broadly irrelevant*.

What makes history so difficult is different dynamics operating at separate timescales are layered over one another, and interacting. The climate crisis is a once-in-30-millennia event. The revival of Chinese power is a once-in-300-year. And the breakdown of America's post-Cold War political order is a once-in-3-decade event.

The climate crisis is like cancer, or diabetes. It's something we are going to live with for all of our lifetimes. Profound technical challenges remain, and we can't expect them to be solved on the time scale of a war (5ish years).

The second problem is that these analogies are always parochial. Saying we need to be like the New Deal or the Roosevelt Administration fighting World War 2 misses the point. Because America is not going to be the site of any real solution, since we're just not posed to contribute that much to future emissions. At it's core, this is a story about the post-colonial, developing nations of the world, trying to find their way to bring prosperity to their people. America can either help or hurt in the quest to make that mission ecologically sustainable, but cutting all of it's emissions wouldn't make enough of a dent to prevent the really scary shit."

But the World War analogy is misguided. World War Two was a snap-decision crisis. Federal spending during the Second World War reached 40%. That could only be sustained for so long until it triggered the [largest strike wave in American history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_wave_of_1945%E2%80%9346) \- itself caused by the massive burst of inflation unleashed by huge US bond issuance. 

Why this is relevant is that the climate crisis *isn't* that kind of crisis. It's more like cancer than a heart-attack. The level of spending in World War Two was for a known goal, and an achievable end; defeat Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. 

There's no ""winning"" against climate change. It's something we simply have to live with and mitigate going forward. And while, yes, you can argue for one big opening move to get us on the right track, there is a track. What this translates to at a technical level is that we can't just spend unlimited sums of money on a climate program in as short a timeframe as possible and expect the issue to go away afterwards. There remains very deep technical and scientific problems; e.g. how to make solar power fully scalable and reliable. The nature of scientific discovery means that we have no idea how long this will take.  There needs to be medium-term thinking about how to pivot capitalist institutions towards investment in these sustainable technologies.

The cash is used for all sorts of things. The money is dynamic, just like any other short-term source of funding. Settlement, financing long positions, covering prior batches of repo, and helping an agent lever up their activities (i.e. how financial agents lever thin margins into fat profits is by utilizing a fucking tidal wave of borrowed money).

2.) Hard to say, but I think it was definitely the result of the big four stockpiling Treasury collateral. There were obviously the constraining factors imposed by QT, typical year-end squeezes, and the balance-sheet capacity of broker-dealers has been steadily shrinking since about 2015.

But the core of the story is the hoarding of collateral. The big four hoard it, but then they have to finance it, and in the process pile into a static market. With rates predictably soaring. I don't think this is a result of insufficient appetite - I think that's nonsense. For Christ's sake, there was a yield curve inversion not even 6 months ago. Recent influential voices have suggested the big four are trying to front-run the Fed. Others have pointed out this makes no sense either, since there is that demonstrably high demand for the Treasuries. They would just sell them off into a hungry market at much greater profit than they would make selling to the super-senior Fed. They have not done this.

So, banks hold safe asset sovereigns as self-insurance for the money markets. Safe asset sovereigns will have stable haircuts, and thus stable liquidity conditions.

I'll let you in on a secret; we really have no consensus idea over how inflation works. As it stands, the developed economies of the world seem to be sliding towards the deflationary precipice. This should be very alarming to everybody. Personally, for me the top three most convincing theses are (in order) some combination of;

* Globalization of value chains, plugging pools of low productivity peasant labor into the production of goods (thus globalizing the once-national correlation between slack and inflation)
* Demographic transitions (typically compounded by heightened income inequality) slowing consumption
* The growing post-08 dysfunction in the ""Eurodollar"" system - which acts as the bedrock for transnational finance.

In Japan's case, there's an additional factor, which is what Taiwanese economist Richard Koo referred to as a ""balance-sheet recession"". Basically, building off of the globalization point, Japan had built a cradle-to-grave welfare system as part of it's imperial state-building project. It was all intermediated by the corporations - which are famously long term employers in Japan. So, in order to maintain their competitiveness, the Japanese firms outsource their value chains to the Asian tigers. Now, this creates a deflationary pressure, but it also guts the welfare system. In such an environment, Japanese people sought to protect themselves by building assets, principally in urban real estate (similar to what happened in the US pre-08).

As that bubble pops, it triggers a financial crisis, and a protracted cycle of deleveraging (and I mean *protracted - it's still going on today)*, where households and corporations try to pay down their remaining debts. The government tries to print money to give to households, but the demographic transition comes into play; a 55-year old, facing joblessness, debt, and a torn-up safety net, is not going to go buy a flat screen TV. They're going to save it. So all monetary stimulus effectively achieves is pumping money into banks, who themselves see an economy with minimal new investment opportunities, and since ""cash-is-trash"", that creates a skyrocketing demand for government bonds. But as for consumption, monetary stimulus for the Japanese economy is like pushing on a string."

But it's not just the American family offices. Because the dollar (or more appropriately, Eurodollar) is the lingua franca of global finance, it's very appealing to convert earnings into dollars and park them in dollar-denominated investments. So this is just what family offices around the world do. As a result, the US attracts roughly [half of all venture capital funding, from across the world.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-long-dominated-startup-fundingnow-it-has-a-challenger-1523544804?mod=rsswn) That figure is down since 2008, largely due to China and Japan. But it's still extraordinary.

Finally, there are outright policy differences. Europe is still heavily under the sway of Ordoliberalism, whereas American anti-trust thinking has largely dominated by dominated by the Chicago School. Siemens is actually a good case demonstrating this; the 2017 Alstom merger was blocked by the EU Competition Commissioner, citing a concern over uncompetitive market dynamics. The Chicago School, on the other hand, has mainly been operating under the assumption that in high-profit sectors, new entries will bring everything back to equilibrium. But because of network effects and the hidden dynamics of intangible investment, this does not happen. So much the better for America's military-IP equipped, ultra-well-funded tech companies.

**Why This is Much More Complicated**

To finally undermine the entire narrative assumption of this post, however, is the fact that America's Silicon Valley oligopolists occupy a very ambiguous place in relation to the interests of the US state. You had the president of Microsoft calling for geopolitical neutrality, to establish themselves as [""Digital Switzerlands"".](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/02/14/need-digital-geneva-convention/) You have Zuckerberg claiming that Facebook is more like a government than a traditional company. Legal scholar Kristen Eichensehr ran with the analogy in an [influential paper](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=528094093074028097094000067089066027051081060000028091094067064023096073009065070087049101030035000120107087009004125075076067020058046015033072091001030091116065006000035124126002103072072001002103127022072004114100099109127024106082127085064074085&EXT=pdf), which I highly recommend. These corporations have an autonomy and power which provides them some parity with sovereign states. Think a little bit like the East India Company, but run by run-of-the-mill, idealistic, Starbucks-sipping liberal Democrats. In fact, Google was [dug deep](https://theintercept.com/2016/04/22/googles-remarkably-close-relationship-with-the-obama-white-house-in-two-charts/) into the Obama Administration. 

And, obviously, these huge corporations employ a small army of corporate tax transfer specialists (about [200,000 people](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=528094093074028097094000067089066027051081060000028091094067064023096073009065070087049101030035000120107087009004125075076067020058046015033072091001030091116065006000035124126002103072072001002103127022072004114100099109127024106082127085064074085&EXT=pdf)). They use this army to exploit designed holes in the US tax code - once they've ""base-shifted"" these profits away from the clutches of the IRS, they then borrow money in the US against the offshore profits as collateral. Circling back, they can then use these as their own ""enhanced cash pools"", which are utilized to buy out new entrants and further consolidate market power.

With the TCJA reform, this changed a little bit, but only by essentially strong-arming the US state into making the tax structure *so relaxed* that these legal convolutions were unnecessary. Why was the profit-shifting possible to begin with? Once you ask this, you begin to blow-up the assumptions of a unitary state with national interests. The pertinent question here is the age-old one posed by critical theories of imperialism and state development - in other words,

* *Who is the American state for, exactly?*
* *How does the answer to that question relate to the global flows of capital?*
* *Broadly - where is the line between geopolitics and class politics?*

But I think this is already more than enough for now hahaha"
geopolitics,fc3pdnp,t1_fc2mtbf,1577395300.0,"I'd say European capital's seeming-backwardness is mostly a combination of three or four things. It's mostly about their disadvantage in intangible investments (tech being key). Damn I wrote a wall again hahaha. Guess I'll do it in parts. Another pet interest of mine.

**The Military-Digital Complex**

The first is the underlying basis of America's IT saga - an enormous military-industrial complex born in the Cold War, which is willing to take big risks and is capable of taking a long view. In no other OECD country could you have an intelligence agency equipped with it's own [venture capital fund.](https://www.iqt.org/our-history/) Just take a look at the key technologies in an iPhone, for example. Touchscreen was developed in a CIA-University of Delaware joint-venture; TCPIP was developed under DARPA; GPS was developed by the Naval Research Lab; thin-film transistors were developed by Westinghouse under the funding of the US Army; SIRI was a spin-off of DARPAs CALO project, designed to help Staff Officers manage the vast supply chains of a two-front War on Terror. You can go on. The point is that the MIC is a formidable R&D engine, matched by little else. Once this IP is shared with the the US private sector, they obtain the immediate competitive edge of  incumbency and network effects, which so dominate the tech sector.

**The Investment Apparatus of the Global Rich**

The second, perverse as it may sound, is the combination of two things; America's enormous wealth inequality, combined with it's underlying economy being denominated in the world's reserve currency. Driving along project financing is something that key Shadow Banking researchers refer to as [""cash pools"".](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Institutional_Cash_Pools_and_the_Triffin/wBlmwuzkx7AC?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=inequality)  These are the un-recylable earnings of corporations, governments, and the large sums of inert cash owned by wealthy families. The more unequal a society is, the larger these cash pools become. Famously, America is very unequal. Which means the cash pools get very large indeed. For wealthy families, when the bulk of there cash pool is invested in traditional assets, the remainder goes into riskier hedge funds, which specialize in managing families' assets - these are ""family offices"".

But's not just American inequality. It's been [estimated](https://www.scmp.com/business/money/wealth/article/3019665/global-family-offices-grow-assets-under-management-nearly-us6) that there are 7,300 of these family offices worldwide. They are probably managing the wealth of a couple dozen thousand wealthy families. America commands the largest single share, at nearly half of all offices. Globally, these offices manage about $6 trillion in total cash. Now, a global scramble for safe assets (and large rounds of QE in the OECD) have suppressed rates of return in traditional fixed-income markets. The result is that these yield-hungry investors compete for space in the riskier world of private equity, constituting about [20%](https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/uhnw/global-family-office-report/global-family-office-report-2019.html) of all their investment activities."

AFRICOM is basically the Sahel and Horn Command. The Sahel is one of the most brutal regions on the planet. It's child mortality rates are [exceptionally bad](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-igme), even by Africa's standards. This is a broad trend. The Oxford Poverty Initiative released an [index](https://ophi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/G-MPI_2018_2ed_web.pdf) covering health, education, and material living standards (access to drinking water, cooking fuel, housing, clothing, etc). On the index map, you can see that the Sahel is the most challenged region of the planet. Climate change is going to *batter* this region - it is least capable of dealing with mass ecological disruption. The rhythm of the rains and pasture are what govern survival in this region, and the expansion of the Sahara desert is combining with the disruption of the West African monsoon to pretty dire effect.

The region is posed to contribute [most heavily](https://ideas4development.org/en/population-growth-sahel-challenge-generation/) to Africa's population boom - especially if you include Northern Nigeria as part of the Sahel (which you should). That's bad news, since the region can currently barely [feed itself](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/22/population-growth-outpaces-food-sahel-study). The post-colonial states of the region mainly function as [pillage machines](https://www.csis.org/analysis/politics-heart-crisis-sahel). Europe is beginning to panic. The political shocks dealt by the Migrant Crisis of 2015 has them eying the Sahel nervously, and gesturing towards AFRICOM. There is talk of the ""Afghanization of the Sahel"". You have MINUSMA planting 12,500 troops on the ground in Mali, with the French and DSGE doing counter-insurgency. There's an Italian battalion and the Bundeswehr in Niger. You can go on. Unfortunately, none of this is really working, and battle deaths have been [increasing](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/the-complex-and-growing-threat-of-militant-islamist-groups-in-the-sahel/). The US framing it's AFRICOM presence as being about the War on Terror isn't all that different from Europe's, it simply lacks an element of demographic anxiety. Both are under the false conception that Salafi jihadism is a problem that can be ""solved"" by pulling the right policy lever. The fact is that it's a competing, apocalyptic religious-political project, which is probably going to be more appealing the more the world looks like it's ending.

The Fiscal Compact has allowed for only a meager [European Emergency Trust](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/MEMO_18_6670), but it wouldn't matter anyways, as there exists close to no reliable institutional channels for the money to go through. Likewise for American investment initiatives. There's an emerging complex of surveillance, border patrolling and biometric scanning stations across the region - complete with cash-for-migration-control deals, as in Sudan, where large parts of EU money goes toward crackdowns in Khartoum. There's also emerged a cottage industry Africa Anxiety literature for Europe's besieged liberal intellectuals - providing large readerships for David Milliband, Paul Collier and most recently Stephen Smith.

Why all this ranting? Because the Sahel is at the frontline of what I think are the new geopolitics of the climate crisis. The AFRICOM mission creep was dangerous. Trying to throw Capitalist Modernization theory and COIN doctrine at this stuff is probably going to be the beginning of a failing pattern of response. Throwing troops and intelligence services into the balance won't stabilize things, it will simply add another dynamic of violence to it. There's a reason why the COIN bubble popped in Afghanistan. What's happening in the Sahel is a good case to use for why the developed nations (and especially America) need to re-frame their entire strategies around the climate crisis - it's pointless to do Great Power competition for a system that's collapsing under the weight of it's own development, and planetary counter-insurgency is like trying to blow out stove fires in a burning building."
geopolitics,fbyjefm,t1_fbxu7ng,1577218397.0,"Eh. I don't think this adds to a very convincing picture of global disengagement. Africa was always negligible region for DoD manpower, which was only slightly pumped up by the creation of AFRICOM. Furthermore, most regions with AFRICOM presence were either in the Sahel or the Horn of Africa. While the Horn is a genuine region of strategic interest, it's only half of China's African OFDI profile, which is overwhelmingly in the Southern half of the continent.

Presence in the Sahel was mainly justified with counter-terrorism and region stabilization. But it's very questionable whether troop deployment stabilizes these regions, and traditional troops are broadly unnecessary for counter-terrorism, which is probably just going to be handed off to JSOC and the CTC (should the need arise). This is really just a reversal of bureaucratic overreach and mission creep, which is pretty recent in it's origin."

geopolitics,fbtjtgs,t1_fbfeldu,1577081567.0,"Hey, sorry for the long delay. So there are several risks to selling dollar reserves, which depend upon the context. Central banks hold typically hold dollars for two purposes; self-insurance and exchange rate management.

**Two Reasons Why Central Banks Hold Dollars**

So let's clarify a bit - central banks hold dollar reserves, often in the guise of US Treasuries. They do this primarily because dollars are the lingua franca of global capitalism - they are what's used for invoicing trade, settling international contracts, and intermediating global banking. A country never wants to be in a position where it's financial corporations owe people lots of dollars, but are suddenly incapable of earning the USD they need to make those debts good. This is what happened in the [Asian Financial Crisis of 1998](https://www.piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/asian-financial-crisis), which then provoked crushing bank failures and currency adjustments from South Korea to Thailand. So dollar reserves are a kind of self-insurance, and getting rid of them is like being uncovered.

A secondary reason for holding lots of dollars (typically by way of Treasuries) is to manage the value of your currency (this is what China did). When you manage the value of your currency in this manner, your internal money supply (and it's growth) becomes tied to the amount of US Treasuries on the asset-side of the central banks' balance sheet. The PBOC gets it's dollars as follows; Chinese entities earn USD, they then sell this USD to a bank for RMB, the bank in turn sells the USD to the PBOC for RMB, and the PBOC passes a good amount on to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), which typically buys a bunch of Treasuries, which, finally, are given back to the PBOC as assets. Running this process backwards, you can see how dollar-denominated securities (Treasuries) lie at the base of the domestic Chinese money supply. The Chinese economy is, in effect, ""dollarized"".

**Two Consequences of Selling Them**

So what are the consequences of selling off your monetary base? Well, there are two obvious consequences. Firstly, you're imposing a contraction of the money supply (and credit) on your domestic economy. Secondly, unless you're trading those dollars back to your financial sector, you're losing your ability to help cover dollar claims on your domestic banks. This is the full story behind the BRIs dollar problem - by spending dollars on construction contracts abroad, China both shrinks it's money supply and further deprives itself of the resources it needs to plug it's banks' [foreign exchange exposures](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-banks-are-running-out-of-dollars-11556012442?mod=rsswn) (which are [enormous](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3015049/chinas-concern-over-possible-us-dollar-shortage-risk-forcing)). In normal times, these banks can simply ""roll over"" their dollar debts - by taking out new dollar loans, they pay off the old ones. The reason why they cannot do this as of the moment is that there is a [global shortage of dollars](https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp160608.pdf). This shortage is tied to global FX dealers current unwillingness to part with their USD or dollar-equivalents (Treasuries) - largely for fear of global financial instability. This self-fulfilling fear is, ironically, itself largely inspired by the tenuous financial position of China.

Leaving the banks' dollar exposures unplugged is self-evidently dangerous, but too rapidly winding down the money supply/credit is also very risky in China, as the CCP is trying to gently wind down several massive asset bubbles. There is a third scenario as well; what if you try to sell all your dollar assets all at once? This would create a fire-sale effect, whereby flooding the market tanks the value of these assets before you have the chance to sell them all, leading to disastrous booked losses.

**The Failure of the Global Yuan**

On the [failure](https://www.cfr.org/blog/rmb-globalization-once-unstoppable-heads-reverse) of RMB internationalization, something much simpler; the Chinese Communist Party doesn't want to lose control. You simply can't have a global currency backed by an economy with three layers of capital controls. There are several reasons why the CCP doesn't want to let go (the first and foremost being that they're control freaks). One prominent reason is that, as mentioned, the economy is skiddish on the heels of deflating bubbles, with downward pressure on the yuan driven by USD appreciation. This causes wealthy families (many CCP officials) to move RMB out of the country (much of it into foreign real estate, such as Vancouver) - creating a feedback loop of capital flight. The controls have been tightened to prevent this spiral from continuing - the consequences being that the ambitious RMB internationalization failed. China is burdened by the dollar at every turn - it is a very underestimated source of global instability."
