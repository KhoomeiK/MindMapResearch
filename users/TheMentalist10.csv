I’m just pointing out that the (unsourced, uncited) claims  this one scientist is making (which, of course, will be over-reported on due to the anti-vegan hypetrain and influence of special interest groups) directly contravenes all major studies, all major health organisations, and all major dietary bodies.

That was in brackets. Your claim was that most of the hatred is not due to the press at all. If you didn't intend to say that, you shouldn't have done so.

 

>Why not? It's partially responsible for this mess (at least the way Corbyn chose to handle it is), and you did say ""what part of the Brexit question...""

Because where either of us think it was a good position or not is immaterial to arguing against the idea that Labour should have won this election easily.

 

>Nonsense. I can quote you the motion from the conference if you like.

Labour's Brexit policy was negotiate a deal in 3 months and vote on it in 6. The conference position is distinct from the election policy.

&#x200B;

>Implying they were assuming a leave outcome from the referendum?

No?

&#x200B;

>Aside from ""media hostility"" and ""a decade of Tory austerity..."" everything listed was under Corbyn's control.

That's not strictly true: Corbyn doesn't personally oversee how the entirety of Labour's election campaign is run. Nor did he singlehandedly design the manifesto (Brexit and all).

&#x200B;

>**Austerity did not win people to the Tory cause**. I haven't checked the numbers, but I feel 100% confident making that assertion. If you believe otherwise, please do explain how/find something empirical to back your position up. 

I didn't claim that it did: my point is that after a decade of telling people that the country was maxing out its credit card, promising a better world doesn't mesh with ostensible reality despite the popularity of individual pledges.

Check my other comment in this thread for a response to that if you're interested. There're some extremely prominent books in the vegan movement which discuss this issue and the dominant thought is that supporting large companies who put out vegan options is a good form of economic activism which, so far, seems to be going pretty well.

>Health vegans shouldn't eat it because there is zero chance it has its own isolated area for prep.

>In addition, most of the hatred towards Corbyn (certainly on my part) is not due to the press at all, but rather to his words and deeds.

How do you know? What data are you basing that on? Was there a study of people locked in some kind of a media-vacuum that you're pulling that from, or are you just making more stuff up?

I can't prove that 100% of people who have a negative opinion of Corbyn hold it due to media influence, and I certainly don't believe it to be the case. But to totally ignore the influence of unprecedented media hostility which simultaneously failed to scrutinise the government during the election cycle (all of which is data-supported) on Corbyn's ratings goes against, like, every single thing we know about how the media works?

I'm not interested in debating Labour's Brexit position, but suffice it to say that you've misrepresented it significantly. I don't know if that's intentional or otherwise.

It reads like you think that backing Remain would have been electorally advantageous. Let me know how that turned out for the LibDems. Let me know how Labour did in Leave voting constituencies by not outright supporting Leave and why you think that supporting Remain would've convinced Brexiteers who voted Tory for the first time in these areas.

>Its ""costed"" manifesto dedicated only a single paragraph to Brexit and didn't mention any of the financial implications (for either outcome), so it was clearly utter bollocks.

There's no point putting 'costed' in scare quotes: it was costed. You've unfortunately misunderstood the role of the manifesto if you think that the full cost of Brexit to the country was going to appear in it. Labour based their costing on the no-Hard-Brexit outcome of their policy; anything outside of that would have been pure speculation and also materially different to costing a *policy* which is the entire purpose of the exercise.

&#x200B;

>What do you believe explains this historically awful defeat and yet -somehow- exonerates the fool who chose the strategy (non-strategy in the case of Brexit) and sat there talking about playing 4D chess while pissing away support on both sides?

I don't exonerate Corbyn whatsoever. His leadership (primarily in the sense of his foreign policy 'baggage' and propensity for long answers in a landscape which prioritises soundbites) was absolutely a factor in the defeat. But pretending that's all there is to it is profoundly myopic to the point of outright foolishness.

Brexit, failures of messaging, media hostility on a scale which we haven't previously seen in this country, more than a decade of Tory austerity conditioning people to believe that we can't have anything better than we currently do, the desire for stability in unstable times, and many, many more elements were key to this loss."

unitedkingdom,fd8z0c8,t3_ekaz6x,1578225632.0,"Lots of misinformation in this thread, OP. To clarify:

\- It is not a legal requirement to have a guarantor in any rental agreement. Both letting agents (estate agents) and private landlords can request them, but they can also not bother with it at their discretion.

\- A guarantor makes the process easier inasmuch as it means that there is a clear person to for the landlord or agent to go to if you fail to pay rent, if you disappear out of the country, or whatever. There are other ways of making the process 'easy' on their part.

\- Renting through an agent, you will often undergo referencing and an affordability check. If you can show that you've got a job which pays X a month (where X is sufficiently more than your rent), or if you can show that you're *going* to have some kind of income in future which does the same, you should be good without a guarantor in most cases.

\- Failing the above, if you are moving before you have a job lined-up, they may ask you to show that you have savings to cover enough rent for X months. Some landlords/agents will request that you give them a portion of those savings to cover extra months of rent in advance, but again this is not a legal requirement and can be negotiated.

Basically, it's a lot harder to find a place to rent when if you don't have a guarantor, are not already employed, don't have a job lined-up, *and* don't have savings. You should try to fix whichever of those problems is the easiest to address if you can. But it isn't impossible: if you genuinely can afford to rent somewhere and know that you'll be able to pay for it for the duration of the term (because, for example, you're confident you'll get a job quickly once you move to the new location), then you can convey that to a landlord or agent. Many won't give you the time of day, but it's within their discretion to do so. Make a good case, make as many concessions and assurances as you're willing to do and hopefully you'll find someone who agrees. It can literally just come down to them liking you on a personal level.

As a final note, look into sites like OpenRent where you can deal directly with private landlords who don't want to go through letting agents. Agents formalise the process meaning there're generally fewer concessions it's in their power to make and they'll take the path of least resistance where possible; landlords can do whatever they want."

It comes down to ethical pragmatism. Companies have finite resources (time, money, supply chains, etc.) at any given moment. If economic demand for plant-based alternatives requires that they increase their supply, then resources will be gradually allocated away from animal products towards vegan ones. Hence a net reduction in harm. It then becomes in the company’s interest to improve and expand their offering so as to compete with other businesses doing the same thing.

That’s pretty much the only way to slowly provoke widespread change, and it’s absolutely working. We wouldn’t have had the surge in vegan offerings from previously non-vegan-friendly companies if it weren’t for vegans financially supporting them every time they come out."

The only real ‘challenge’ for someone of ordinary health in going vegan is B12, which is made by bacteria (not by animals) and regularly supplemented in livestock through injection if their gut flora isn’t producing enough.

Fortunately, so many plant-based (and non-plant-based) foods are fortified with B12 that it’s largely a non-issue. For those who don’t eat cereals, plant milk, nutritional yeast, marmite, certain meat substitutes, or anything else with B12 fortification, it’s trivial to take a multivitamin which solves the problem. In fact, due to the terrible absorption rate of B12, some studies recommend that people of all diets supplement with it.
