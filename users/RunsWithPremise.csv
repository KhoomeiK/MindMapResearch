AskOldPeople,fez26x0,t3_eqylr0,1579453152.0,"Unless your job requires it or it's a hobby for you, you just aren't as immersed in it as you are when you're younger.  In school, we were always talking about the latest and greatest technology, games, devices, etc...either among peers or in class.  I don't know that life responsibilities take you away from it, but other things can become more important.  I'm fairly up to speed on technology, but I think I've fallen off a little bit on things like music.  Rappers and singers will appear in the news or on a red carpet or on SNL and I find myself saying, ""who the hell is this weirdo with 10 face tattoos?""  I was always into rock or metal, but growing up I knew who everyone was because we all watched MTV.  Now, because I have Sirius and I only listen to what I like, I don't know who anyone is.  That definitely makes me feel like how I pictured my parents back then--out of touch.  

There's nothing wrong with not knowing who the latest and greatest artist is or when the next Apple Watch is coming out, but I don't think you can get hurt by knowing stuff.  I tire very easily of people who contend that it's okay to not know this or that on the premise that it is stupid or it isn't intellectual.   I think it is good to know a little bit about everything, so even though knowing who Tekashi 6ix9ine is won't advance my career or win a round of Jeopardy against James Holzhauer, it's still knowledge.

AskOldPeople,ferx8qm,t3_eqffj9,1579359291.0,"My wife was raised by her aunt and lived with her until we were dating.  Her aunt passed away about 4 months ago, very unexpectedly.  Then my wife's actual mom died right before Thanksgiving.  This was less shocking due to a life of alcohol and drug abuse.   
 I've lost loved ones, close friends, grandparents, etc.  I also watched a good friend go through a losing battle of breast cancer with his wife.  It took about 2 years from start to finish and the last 6 months were not pretty.  That probably most closely relates to what you're facing today.

Knowing it's coming is okay in the respect that you can say the things you need to say and be a good and supporting friend and family member.  The challenge is that you sometimes can't express emotions the way you want.  Where you might normally lean on that person, you feel as though you can't and you bottle your problems up because they have enough problems.  If they step out of line or say something that hurts you, you feel like you can't address that because you don't want to have an argument or cross words when they might pass away before you can fix the rift.  It's a lot of pressure, that we mostly apply to ourselves.  With respect to this, I would say the best thing you can do is treat them as if everything is normal.  They don't want to be handled with kid gloves, they want to be treated like the same old person.  Sometimes they are going to have bad days.  They're going to be angry because they're dying, and they're on 100 different medications that all make them feel like shit, and because it isn't fair.  It's okay to say, ""I get it.  I know you're upset.  I'm here for you to vent to, but don't take it out on me.  Let's push pause for a minute and talk it through.""  Just because they're dying doesn't mean they get a pass on social etiquette.  And they will respect you and love you even more for your honesty and compassion.

When the end comes, we all handle things differently.  I am able to process these things pretty well and move forward.  I am sad that a person is gone, but I am grateful for the times that we shared.  For me, that person then basically fades away and I think about them less and less over time.  I know that sounds cold, but it just seems to be the way my mind works.  It's not something I do consciously.  For my wife, it is much more involved.  She goes through bouts of anger.  ""I can't believe most of my family is dead...my mom, my grandmother, my aunt, my grandfather...""  Just a couple of nights ago, she was in our bedroom, throwing socks against the wall.  We've been together for 7 years and I've never once seen her throw anything out of anger.  She was just pissed that her family was dead and the laundry was the recipient.  But I'm glad she was venting it out.  Some days she has to come home and cry for 10 minutes.  I guess the important thing here is to let yourself feel the feelings and vent your emotions if you need to.  Don't bottle it up.  You may feel regret for missed opportunities, anger because it isn't fair, sadness, loneliness, etc.  It's okay to feel those things, to express them, and to talk about them.  

Finally, and above all, you have to take care of yourself physically.  Exercise, eat right, and hydrate.  The stress of grieving takes a physical toll and the only way you're going to come through it, is to make sure you take care of yourself.  You may not feel like it, but go for a walk, drink a bottle of water, eat a healthy meal...you'd be surprised what those things will do for your attitude, outlook, and overall well being.  Trust me on that one."

My generation went through the transition to that, although we were pretty young.  We grew into it, starting out with Apple IIe computers in the classrooms in the early 80's with no Internet, to limited Internet, to playing Quake ""death match"" with our buddies, to cell phones and all of our papers being typed and so on.  I was over at a friend's house a while ago and something was on the TV in the background and his 10 year old daughter asked, ""What's that??""  Someone was using a VCR.  Ha ha.

My parents are very early boomers (dad is 1949 and my mom is 1954), so they lived a HUGE part of of their adult lives before the technology came into play.  I'm sure that makes it more challenging.  My dad emails and he is on his second iPhone, though he doesn't text and often tells me that the phone is ""too fucking complicated.""  And that's an iPhone!!!  Ha ha.  He struggles with the concept of how you touch the screen, how hard and how long, has an impact on how it reacts.  He just tries to drive his finger through the screen with each press.

AskOldPeople,fek3z79,t3_eplcdk,1579192115.0,"It seemed to grow organically over time.  I don't remember anyone laughing at it though.  Like anything, there were early adopters and late adopters, generally based upon age, hobbies, and careers.

I remember my first taste of anything like it was watching the movie War Games, where a kid is trying to find a video game company and accidentally dials into a back door access for a NORAD computer and almost triggers WW3.  I thought that was pretty dang cool.

In school we started to have some limited internet access in the mid-90's.  We had a couple of Gateway computers in the library with slow access to the internet.  At home, we had a PC and I was using Juno or something like that for free email.  My parents were sort of stereotypical in the sense that they were scared of the Internet and thought that just dialing out to Juno email would put them at risk for identity theft, exorbitant charges, viruses, stuff like that.  They just didn't understand the medium and, as a teenager, they weren't going to listen to me.  I don't know if I'd call it fear, but it was definitely strong trepidation.  They hadn't grown up with technology and were wary of things they didn't understand.

The thing that struck me the most were the people that didn't see or didn't want to see the power of the Internet.  I live in Maine and the paper industry was HUGE here.  Like the auto industry in MI.  In the late 90's, the largest mill in the state invested heavily in machines to make phone book and newsprint paper.  That mill is gone.  In the 00's, I was director of operations for a large food service distribution center.  Across the street was a printing press for the local newspaper.  They closed it down, cut circulation days, sold buildings, and downsized to a tiny office with 20% of the employees.  As a result, I ended up interviewing a lot of former employees.  Most said that circulation had been dropping every year for over a decade.  When I asked why they didn't adapt or change due to the internet, I always got the same answer:  upper management didn't take the Internet seriously...they just kept doing the same damn thing every year, even though they kept selling fewer papers every year.  By the time they started investing heavily in their web presence, it was too late.  Their content was shit and only people over 60 were still buying actual print media."

I work in the manufactured housing industry, specifically high-end modular homes and then more affordable single and double wide trailers.  My issue falls here into the modular housing end.  Modular homes are factory built stick-built homes.  We cater to the more high end ones, so our projects range from $250k up to $750k or more.  Because they are stick built homes, they are required to meet all of the uniform building and energy codes.  I'm cool with that.  I WANT to sell efficient homes because it makes my homes seem that much better and it makes my customers happy.  The issue I run into is that my competition will often sell homes that do NOT meet the code and they can undercut me price-wise.  They get away with this because a lot of small towns have lackadaisical code enforcement.  Also, towns with a population under 4000 are not required to uphold the energy codes--it is optional for them.  So the guy down the street from me can steal deals by being way less money.  

The customer ends up getting fucked in the end because they end up with a less efficient home that will cost much more to heat/cool.  But their hindsight doesn't do me much good if I lose business and it doesn't help to have a guy down the street who is discrediting the industry as a whole.  It makes modulars seem cheap and shitty.  Sure, some are, but that is the same for anything you buy...TVs, cars, food, whatever.  

I get plenty of deals and having other competitors nearby helps in the sense that it makes the area a destination for home shoppers, so it draws more people overall, but it is frustrating when you see people headed down a path to get bent over and fucked.  You can do your best to educate the customer (I'm going to have your whole foundation insulated, your sill box insulated, R49 in your attic, etc....they won't), but you need to walk the line of not trashing the other guy because that isn't how we like to do things.

During that time, I did learn a lot and I made some valuable business relationships, so I cannot say the whole thing was a waste, but I stayed in a job for too long.  I was looking for the ""perfect job"" to replace it and I wasn't going to find the exact thing I was doing, with the exception of better pay and not working for a dick.  I ended up in a totally different career path that I never would have expected and things couldn't be any better.  I make a little less money, but my life is so much better and I am way happier.  

I see people on Reddit all the time saying how being loyal to an employer is stupid and all companies are out to fuck you over and that bums me out.  I work for a great guy now and he treats me awesome.  He is totally deserving of my loyalty.  Those 10 years I wasted earlier on...well, not so much.  I should not have been as loyal as I was.  But now I have a great job where I am treated really well and those people do deserve my loyalty."
AskOldPeople,fea1udl,t3_eo5hll,1578943480.0,"I've always been pro choice.  I think if people aren't ready yet for kids and they have an accident, it is better to eliminate that pregnancy than to bring it into a situation where they cannot provide the stable household that a child needs.  I know that accidents can happen, even when people are being responsible.  Also, as a fiscally conservative person, I'd much rather see a woman get a $700 abortion than have the rest of us pay for welfare, healthcare, etc for that child for 18 years because she wasn't in a position to take that on in her life.  There are also medical reasons where abortion is necessary to save the life of the mom.  And if a woman is raped and gets impregnated, she should also be able to eliminate that pregnancy.

The only time I could see myself having an issue with abortion is if someone used it as birth control.  Meaning, if a woman has had 6 abortions or something, maybe it's time to get your tubes tied or explore multiple layers of birth control (pill + condoms).  I don't think this is a very common occurrence at all though."

Ha ha.  Would still be cool to have something with that appearance though.  I love that body style.  

It’s a conversation I have with my car buddies all the time.  I contend that nothing is as cool as we remember it.  I had a 99 2 door Tahoe.  Loved that truck.  150k trouble free miles.  But the class leading 255hp it had then is what my wife’s 2.0 Equinox has today.  My last gas half ton Chevy was a 2016 and had 420hp.  The 99 sound system wouldn’t cut it, the brakes weren’t great, no Bluetooth, no heated/cooled seats, cheap plastics inside, and so on.  

My buddy bought a mint 92 Fox body at Barrett Jackson. 48k miles.  Looks and drives like it came off the lot yesterday.  And it sucks. Ha ha.  It’s slow, doesn’t handle great, etc, etc.  Still a cool car, but only for nostalgia. And, yeah, you could put exhaust and subframe connectors and a small blower on it, like we used to do...and you’d maybe have 300hp.  A new V6 Mustang would leave it in its dust still.  Same guy with the Fox body owns a 2015 Z06 and he drives that.  Never the Mustang.  

Nostalgia is cool and owning stuff like that is fun, but it is never as good as you remember it."

AskOldPeople,fdn0tbt,t3_em60ib,1578573760.0,"My dad was born in 1949 and said that he knew kids that were spoiled when he was young.  In those days, it was the kids whose parents owned the local mill.  They would go skiing in Europe on a school break and my dad and his brothers were stoked to have two presents each for Christmas.

I grew up in the 80's and there were definitely spoiled kids when I was growing up.  Expensive clothes, all the gaming systems, fancy trips, expensive bikes, new cars, etc.

It's probably always been a thing for some kids to be spoiled.

In some ways it may be more accessible to spoil kids these days, just because we have so many consumer electronics that can be purchased for relatively small amounts of money.  It used to be that TV was an extravagance, but now you can buy some offbrand LCD TV at WalMart for $100, so almost all kids can have a TV in their room.  You can get the last generation cell phone for very little money, so most kids can have a cell phone with a decent screen and camera.  Ultimately though, it may not be seen as being spoiled to the current generation.  Those of us that grew up without those things may see it that way, but when every other kid has a phone, TV, and game system, it's the new normal.  Just like microwaves and dishwashers were uncommon at one time and now every home has one."

Frankly, used German cars scare the shit out of me.  I only know of one person in my group of friends that has bought one and not blundered into an expensive repair in less than 8 months.  He bought an SL55 AMG at Barrett Jackson for $15k and sold it for $20k a month later.  Generally, the cars are solid and well built as you would expect and the interiors wear very well.  But it doesn't seem to take long before you run into an expensive suspension/brake issue, electrical issue, or engine repair that requires the engine to come out of the car.

Any used German car is a gamble.  You can generally buy them inexpensively and you might get lucky and get one that has no issues.  If you do, you've scored a great driving, solid car for pennies on the dollar.  I just have yet to see anyone have it happen."
