This bit  in the comments seems important for large drives: 

> If the drive is >2TB and was one volume, it will be GPT formatted. Windows will put a small partition in front of the main one in this case. That was my problem, partition alignment wasnâ€™t the same. What I did was got an identical drive, partitioned it, then used partitionguru to back up the partitions (including the 128MB hidden MS reserved partition) and restore the partitions to the accidentally deleted drive, then ran repair-bde. Opened up the archive and THERE WAS MY DATA

I would think you could just create a 128mb partition first if the hidden reserved partition is a fixed sized. It's an idea anyway, if your encrypted drive is that large and you don't have another drive available."

The way electrons exist in a quantum state around an atom. Like that except filling ALL the quantum states at once so there's no room to change.

pottytraining,fd3v3pc,t1_fd236jf,1578161882.0,"Naked seems to work better for stage 1. Just getting them to notice and make it to the potty. To avoid HUGE messes really loose sweat pants give the best of both worlds. Loose enough to have the same effect as naked but still giving something to absorb the worst of an accident. Water proof undersheet for the bed also.

Then underwear once they get what it feels like and how to get to the potty quickly.

The 3 day oh crap boot camp is naked day 1, loose clothes day 2, underwear day 3 but I've only heard of it working in 3 days for like 2.5 year olds with extremely lucky parents lol.

I definitely understand having to deal with the defiance. The popular psychology says to avoid even acknowledging the negative behavior and focus on the positive...and we try that a LOT but that's just not always realistic for us so when se have to, we focus on his effect on others. How the disrespect and rude behavior makes us sad and how it's disrespectful to us and how it means we have less time to play with him because we have more chores to do because of whatever rude defiant thing he did. Same idea if we have to talk to him about something he gets in trouble for at daycare or out with friends. That and things like Daniel tiger seem to help. And of course ALWAYS making him participate in cleaning up his own messes even when it's more annoying or difficult to have them involved.

Goodluck!"

pottytraining,fcy789r,t3_ejdsqz,1578075819.0,"Get a kids seat for the adults potty and a stool.

Tell, don't ask. Every 15-30 min. ""Go to the potty"" not ""do you have to go?"". They don't know and they only learn by going correctly a lot (or a little if you're lucky).

Loose gym shorts or sweat pants, no underwear, commando until they figure it out. Or skirts and dresses for girls.

Always encouraging. Celebrate every time. Non-food based rewards can be fun (we do an hour of video games for self-led bowel movements.) Focus on positive reinforment and really make a thing out of it. Sticker charts work good for some kids too.

When they fail, definitely lead with ""You'll do better next time"" but also have them learn how to clean up their own mess and explain how unhygienic it is and reasons why we go in the potty instead of on the floor or on our pants. But don't over focus on what they did wrong, instead pivot to learning how to clean themselves up and change themselves.

Some do it in a night, some take years. Younger seems to be better and faster. Mines 4 and he does great sometimes but sometimes it's like he didn't even realize it happened (usually because he's distracted by playing).

Barring medical issues everyone figures it out eventually. If you're not pressured by day care and public school just let it happen."
