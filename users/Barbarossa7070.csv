Sellers had moved 2 time zones away already.  Some pieces were nice: dining room set, sleeper sofa, wine cabinet, patio furniture, sideboard.  Some were not: huge ugly desk, cheap bookcases.

The total value new would have been north of $10k (the sleeper sofa was especially nice - leather, king sized with a memory foam mattress + huge ottoman with storage).  We had some repair requests so we did an even swap.  We dropped the repair requests (maybe $5k tops) and kept all of the furniture.   

For the crappy furnishings we didn't want, we either sold them cheap on craigslist or gave them to college-aged family members who could use them and didn't care about the quality.  Stipulation was the buyer/donee had to come get the items and the only help we provided was to open the front door."

Maybe it was worth $40k.  We did some research before the meeting and uncovered a real shitshow.  

Grandma had died years before without a will.  She had several children, some of whom had predeceased her, most without wills and all with kids.  One child had started renting out the house and keeping the rent payments.  Ultimately, what we found was that there were dozens of parties who owned small portions of the house.

Then some dick behind me starts leaning on his horn and yelling shit like, “Hurry the fuck up!” out of his window. Girl at the window leans out and gives him the stink eye. She looks down at me and goes, “Guess he gonna have to wait!” Then she starts laughing and falls out.
