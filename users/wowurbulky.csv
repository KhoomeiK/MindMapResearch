depression,fe5g1yr,t3_enulbo,1578869017.0,"I guess nothing is so simple as that. Yes life is an inconvenience and terrible, but that doesn't mean the only conclusion to make is suicide. I 100% see the appeal, but (and I know it's hard to believe) but it's possible to feel differently about life. You would probably regret that choice if you were to survive. Seek help from anyone. Professional or otherwise, but if people spend days looking at product reviews, we can spend time to hear from loved ones and professionals on whether we should continue life. you are loved"
depression,fe5f2qi,t1_fe5em3g,1578868691.0,i don't pity but I can relate. you are loved and keep going. don't life win. you have the power to decide what you do or dont do
depression,fe5eux5,t3_enunjv,1578868586.0,"You get to decide if you want to be alone or not. If that's what you want then okay, but if not, you have the right to make that change. There are so many people not only here on reddit who would love to support you, but i'm sure just as many in real life around you. You are loved and you got this"
lgbt,fe5dif7,t1_fe5d9e1,1578868094.0,"I've started a taking medication and am feeling much better, and although I still doubt my sexuality, I really don't think I'm straight. That one will be a long journey."
depression,fe5c9s4,t3_enudv5,1578867620.0,Don't let this discourage you from opening up in general though! There are still people out there who are compassionate and actually considerate.
depression,fe5bupe,t3_enuf1f,1578867429.0,Is there anyone in your life who you can talk to?
depression,fe5aewp,t3_enib6u,1578867008.0,You are loved and appreciated. More than anything you have value! It takes a special person to accomplish what you have and it's okay to brag a little. If you have gotten this far imagine how much you could do in the future!
depression,fe59i0i,t3_eno5jo,1578866828.0,"Yes, you are not alone."
depression,fe57aoz,t3_enrr8r,1578866272.0,"I somewhat get that. What I think, is in our mind, we think that a gf or bf is the answer, but it's really something else. You don't want to add to your anxieties by getting into something like that. At least that's my opinion. It's your life and your choice, and I KNOW you're gonna hate to hear it, but your mental health should cone first before you start prioritizing others'"
lgbt,fe56p53,t3_enqv7v,1578866094.0,It's really good! Keep following your passions!
depression,fe54zel,t3_ens80f,1578865716.0,You loved and I hope you can find comfort in that
depression,fe54tfm,t3_ens82q,1578865666.0,"I'm no professional, but if this is making you unhappy and you aren't enjoying life, then you don't need mine or anyone else's opinions. That should be enough to convince you there is a problem. If so, reach out to loved ones or to a professional. Goodluck"
depression,fe545pq,t3_enjrpr,1578865475.0,You are amazing! You inspire me and others! Keep going
depression,fe519nw,t3_enn3hy,1578864727.0,"I love you. Your family loves you. Please, don't. Don't take an easy way out. Don't accept the way you feel. I know fighting al the time is hard. I know it's a battle within yourself, but there is family, therapy, medication. Anything. The world meeds to see what you will do in life. I want to see what your potential is. Let me know if you are okay because your life matters to me."
depression,fe4zoat,t3_enpgw8,1578864278.0,"I know. I promise I know. At least somewhat, that it's hard. Life is hard. And it's an inconvenience and it's pointless. But the world needs you. People want to see you go on, and see what you will do in life. I do too. I'm positive you are loved, so hug your family and let them anchor you to life."
Stutter,fe4yjws,t3_enkr13,1578864022.0,"Stuttering is hard, so is depression. It's all hard. But, I am 100% confident that you are worth praising. But you need to be confident too. Speaking seems like such a simple thing, but we know it's not, but that doesn't mean you don't get to communicate. You are loved and good luck"
depression,fe4vyfo,t3_enpbid,1578863302.0,"You are cut out for life! If anything, you are a gift to life. Your compassion may be difficult to wield, but you have the power to bring kindness and happiness into the world. You are struggling now, but that doesn't mean give up or change who you are. Reach out or find professional help. Whatever you think you need, but don't think you are below anyone else because you don't believe in contempt for others."
depression,fe4tg5k,t3_enrs4c,1578862648.0,"I do the same thing, and we both need to stop. Our feelings are valid. If that's how you feel, you have to be confident in it and not care how others will interpret them. If you are struggling, YOU ARE STRUGGLING."
Stutter,fe4t0kn,t3_ensoym,1578862506.0,"In the IT movies and I assume the books. Maybe, one if the main characters does stutter, but good luck on the search!"
depression,fe4qgss,t1_fe4p20s,1578861881.0,good luck to you as well
depression,fe4apjw,t3_enmeu5,1578857352.0,"hold out, find professional help or whatever you need. You are worth living"

depression,fdhqnlb,t1_fdhq3z5,1578428264.0,"I guess it's that I feel like i've lost someone, or at least an enjoyable part of my life. I also feel stupid for texting her while not knowing they've broken up. It makes me not feel good about myself at all..."
