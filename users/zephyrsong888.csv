I imagine for many of these situations it's a case of ""my nephew studied in Great Britain.  Hire him for your company, he needs a job.""  The nephew in question studied Biology and now finds his life revolves around translating documentation for some government arm with no chance of moving up the ladder without shmoozing with his relatives.  His quality of work has next to no bearing on his placement or his maintaining his job.

This happens very frequently in China, and it's a way of cutting corners rather than hiring natives to do translation work.  Localization is somewhat unimportant when your domestic market is 1.4 billion people."
