trashy,ff568gq,t1_ff4vn52,1579581399.0,...I think they own their own bodies.
fatlogic,fev624b,t1_fetuxvu,1579393472.0,"Women and men have different standards for being fit. From my size and sex, the upper limit for deadlifts for me is about 300 pounds. But compared to a 200 pound man who can deadlift 300, I would be much more in shape if I deadlifted the same amount. So a woman could definitely be just as fit as you and not be able to do a pull up."
fatlogic,fev43qf,t1_fes11bi,1579392917.0,"Yeah, I weigh 105 at 5’3” and have a little muscle mass. I would need 65 more pounds of pure muscle to be incorrectly classified as “obese”, which I think is physically impossible for me to achieve. These instances of BMI being inaccurate because of muscle mass are so blown out of proportion."
fatlogic,fev2ze8,t1_feshqb1,1579392574.0,"Many football players have a lot of muscle, but a lot of fat as well. They very well could be obese, and I think it’s pretty rare that someone has an obese BMI through only muscle mass. But you’re correct, for anyone with a significant amount of muscle, body fat is a better measurement - but if you can see your abs, you probably have nothing to worry about."

AskReddit,fepiach,t1_feolswu,1579321204.0,"Yeah, I can’t really understand why people’s ideas of vacations just seem to be limited to cities or beaches. Every national park I’ve been to in any country is amazing, and it’s incredible how different the scenery is in each location. The stars are amazing to look at at night, and everything is just so calm and serene and breathtaking. I could easily spend 3/4 days in a national park."
AmItheAsshole,felnlcx,t1_fekhgr5,1579226468.0,Hit the nail on the head.
science,felfye7,t1_feeo3w9,1579221259.0,"For real. I had to take Zofran daily because on top of not being able to eat, I would throw up uncontrollably every day, and it wouldn’t stop until I either smoked or took Zofran. This lasted for a month, and I lost 20 pounds during this time. And the anxiety and fear and panic and irritability was constant. Hard to sleep, hard to do anything without freaking out. I still smoke a lot, and I love weed, but the withdrawal symptoms were debilitating for me."

AskReddit,fef6ou7,t1_fef368u,1579049462.0,"I don’t think you understand how alcoholism works. Even if you’re drinking everyday and you feel fine, that much alcohol will absolutely wreck your body in the long term, even if you drank it over the course of the day."

AmItheAsshole,fdtja45,t1_fdhj8h4,1578717561.0,"I used to use a bunch of products in my hair to make it look good, but now I just use Cantu leave in and it’s so hydrating and makes my hair feel so soft. It has saved me so much money."

coolguides,fc8ks93,t1_fc8faf2,1577536980.0,I thought he meant the dark blues on this plot.
coolguides,fc70i9y,t1_fc6wm7s,1577494274.0,Yes! This is my strategy too. It’s cheap to buy so you can build mad hotels near the beginning and get rich quick.
AmItheAsshole,fc64jfq,t1_fc61u1r,1577472105.0,"Why don’t you look at the whole thread? Literally 99% of the comments say that the bride is an asshole (and about half say that OP is as well, which I agree with). I’m not talking about the few people who read this comment thread. Sample sizes, dumbass."
AmItheAsshole,fc64buo,t1_fc61ra2,1577471969.0,"Well you keep saying that you don’t believe OP, and you believe the bride is just trying to include OP. This is just drawing conclusions out of nothing. You’re making so many assumptions to justify the brides behavior, when you really don’t know the situation AT ALL. Your entire argument is based off your own projections on to the situation, while also assuming that OP is lying. Who is really trolling?"
AmItheAsshole,fc61h73,t1_fc5z0ak,1577470133.0,"You really seem to think the fact that you’ve been to weddings is somehow relevant. If you’ve seen other brides act like this, all that says is that you’ve met a lot of bridezillas. Other people acting the same way does not make it acceptable, and you continuing to repeat your job like it at all proves anything is laughable. You’re one of the few people on this thread who think the bride is not an asshole. I doubt that everyone else is just immature - more likely you’re missing the point."
AmItheAsshole,fc613gz,t1_fc5yr1z,1577469897.0,"It’s crazy how you think the bride is acting out of the goodness of her heart, just trying to include OP, when she’s setting rules like not letting her dance, and talking shit about her behind her back. I literally don’t know how you’re missing this. And I’m not under 20, but you seem to be a child, given that you think catty high school behavior is ok because it’s the bride’s “special day!” Sorry your reading comprehension is this bad :/"
AmItheAsshole,fc5xbww,t1_fc5vl7n,1577467861.0,"I can’t help you if you’re trying to make up meaning that isn’t there. Like I said, if there was so much drama, why would the bride ask OP to be a bridesmaid? And then go on to set these rules instead of just refusing for OP to be a bridesmaid and just let her be a regular guest instead? You are blind to see that the bride is not being spiteful. You are being willfully ignorant."
AmItheAsshole,fc5x2bo,t1_fc5v2f7,1577467702.0,"Uh, seriously? Did you even read the post? The bride went beyond not allowing OP in the group. That’s totally fine that she did that. What’s not fine is setting rules like not being able to dance at her wedding, and talking shit about OP with friends. You think that’s acceptable because “it’s the bride’s day”? Really? If there was bad blood, why even ask OP to be a bridesmaid in the first place? 

Literally, what are you on about. Being a bride absolutely does not entitle you to be a bitch."
AmItheAsshole,fc5ur4y,t1_fc5u72n,1577466341.0,"??? What the fuck? Some people aren’t comfortable showing their skin, the bride can’t just call the shots on refusing someone their bodily autonomy. If the bride wasn’t a bitch, she would let OP just be a regular guest, but she’s trying to get back at her for being uncomfortable wearing a certain outfit. 

I don’t know what the fuck you think maturity is, but clearly you’ve got it wrong."
AmItheAsshole,fc5uhx7,t1_fc5tan3,1577466173.0,"She is being vindictive. She’s getting back at OP for not being a bridesmaid by setting these rules for her. She’s trying to make OP have a bad time at the wedding, or make her not go. I have no clue how you think OP’s actions are worse, damn. OP was just going to go to the wedding and talk to people and dance, not cause a scene or anything."

food,fansefn,t1_fagf6cz,1576249474.0,The real willful ignorance is deeming something to be not a pizza on a picture without even knowing what a deep dish pizza is (I know you’re not OP). Also this is nowhere near a meat pie. You don’t even need meat?
