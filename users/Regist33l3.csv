You have to try all of them to finally possibly find a solution. Maybe there is just another box outside this one but maybe not.

You may find yourself locked in that box again at random points in time but after enough times maybe you start to remember which keys you needed and you can be freed for awhile.

Maybe you only have the energy to try 10 keys today. It's better than 0, can always try again tomorrow.

Sometimes the 50 keys may be 100, sometimes 20. In my experience depression can be fairly dynamic in duration and intensity.

The universe is so large it is incomprehensible, but one minor action or change can change the path of so much.

I believe in whatever I need to if it means the survival of our planet and species if only to fulfill my dream of the human race expanding out across galaxies and learning the true nature of everything.

You are arguing with me over my beliefs and distinctions, which affect nobody but myself. I don't really see the point in it. If you're curious to know my viewpoint or why I make this distinction I will always happily explain but it isn't something to argue about. What is inconsequential to you is not to others."

I never claimed science was a religion. I stated that my understanding of the workings of physics and how they expand beyond our little planet lead me to believe nothing special created people and we happened due to an extensive series of unlikely random events.

Take morality from religion, sure. The God part doesn't really matter unless you need some kind of punishment or reward to convince you to do good.
