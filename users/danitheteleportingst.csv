AskReddit,fejwxsr,t3_epfjje,1579187739.0,"I worked for a really small company in a garage of a house. No part of this place was up to any sort of code. I was the production manager but I really enjoyed helping the production team so when I could, I would. 

One day I'm putting some product on a shelf the the door to the backyard and I knock the fire extinguisher off the wall. It is roughly 4 ft off the floor. The floor is cement. There is nothing on top of that cement to make it softer. Why the extinguisher wasnt better attached to the wall I will never know.

It is also important for this part of the story to mention that I did not have shoes on (I know, super dumb on my part but we had no real equipment or anything in this place. It was literally like walking around your house in socks, we all did.) 

Anyways. Fire extinguisher falls directly on my foot crushing 3 of my toes. I thought they had exploded. It hurt so incredibly bad. The office manager called 911 and we hobbled me out to the driveway where I passed out. She came with me to the hospital...

Turns out dude didn't have workers comp insurance so he had to shut down after this happened.

My big toe escaped the blow but the middle three toes especially the second toe are still fucked to this day and that happened 5 years ago."

(They could only serve beer and wine and had a very strange menu). That was giving of some super deep ""hill people"" vibes (and we were in the hills). 

The woman who I suspect was the owner comes out of the kitchen and asks me and my partner if we are into trying new things. (Cue looks of concern, but there is no call service out here so it's best to just agree, right?) We said sure and she brought us the watermelon salsa and fritos scoops. So. Bomb. We ate a whole giant bowl of it while we listened to the woman next to us try to hit on a guy pretending she didnt know him when it was PAINFULLY clear they knew each other and it wasnt a secret dude didnt like her. 

For example. He gets up and walks over to the kitchen door to talk to the aforementioned owner woman (kitchen door is one of those halfstyle barn doors mr ed had with the top open) and is wearing a fire dept shirt for the local fire dept. The woman starts oooooing and aaaaahhing because she just *loooooooooves* fireman, she had *no idea* such handsome men could be firemen!

We were leaving as this was ending without realizing it which was tragic, I wish we had stayed cause as soon as we got in my partners truck, the woman comes running (well... quick walking) out to her car and the guy comes out after her and yells ""NEXT TIME TRY NOT TO HIT ON YOUR HUSBANDS FRIENDS, KRISSY!""

The thing about mental munching is the ""glam"" would have to come from getting hard to get meds I guess cause theres no phones allowed in most mental hospitals. It would be all suicide baiting and the switching cringe from DID munchies would be about voices and hallucinations.
