Console your girl and make it clear you will not tolerate that behavior again. Accountability then eventually consequences for the behavior. 

*i am curvy, flirtatious woman and I have been in that situation before too. It‚Äôs horrifying and you feel helpless.  Knowing my date or SO was on my side and protective made me feel better but not really. You feel helpless.

Your parents do not get to dictate your life. I was also raised strict catholic. I‚Äôm disgusted with the whole church and for that I‚Äôm not catholic anymore. I find the baby boomer Catholics are the worst. Come on people- like you never did things you weren‚Äôt allowed todo. 

Start setting boundaries with them. If you have a stable job then maybe it‚Äôs time to move out with some girl friends. Do not move in with the BF. You will save less but freedom is wonderful. 

I went to an extreme with my family and blocked/ muted them when the behavior started. I would give them very little notice that I was going away because If I gave them more they would drive me crazy and ruin it. When I returned they would try to punish me... punishing a 22yo. Get real. it took years of therapy to feel okay about handling it this way but it was the best for me. Eventually they learned to shut it."

Of course you can‚Äôt do this if you‚Äôre still finically dependent on them.  the Indian culture is very different then my white American, single parent household.

Eat half of what ever she wants you to then divert her attention to something else. Ignore her comments about you to her friends. She‚Äôs looking for attention in an unhealthy way.

TwoXChromosomes,fc7kgx6,t3_egm55s,1577510325.0,"Are you talking any medications that could be causing this? 

Try a daily probiotic , feminine PH wash, also stop all dairy. Dairy increases estrogen production. Estrogen is a beast. Do not use Luffas or wash cloths- not hygienic. Wear breathable cotton underwear and loose fitting pants and around the arm pits. Look into tea tree oil in a body wash it‚Äôs a Natural anti bacterial. 

Change in diet always helps- increase good bacteria (healthy yogurts and the probiotics!) 
Impeccable hygiene (you should be showering twice a day, carry PH wipes with you summer eve sells them) 
Hydration (drink extra) 
Fungal/yeast infections can also be caused by a grain allergy.. 

You should see different endocrinologist, this doesn‚Äôt sound normal. I‚Äôm thinking of multiple
Disease processes- *diabetes, poly cystic ovary disease, BV or an STI- maybe something weird with your adrenal glands.  Not a doctor but highly recommend you see one.  Maybe birth control? 

Maybe a teaching facility would be a good fit.. major university in your city?  It can be hard to find a good connection. 
 

I sweat a lot due to a side effect of an anxiety medicine and have struggled with yeast infections- I stoped all dairy and white sugar. Gluten free is hard but I‚Äôm trying. I also work in healthcare. 
It‚Äôs incredibly embarrassing when you start sweating in front of your patients and colleagues. ‚ÄúOh sure just ignore me. I‚Äôm fine, over here in the corner fanning myself so you can‚Äôt see the beads of sweat rolling down me.‚Äù"
