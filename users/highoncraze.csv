Cricket,ffdwq3j,t1_ffd9446,1579830820.0,"This.  

It'll be difficult to replace Big Vern, but Nortje is promising, and just needs to maybe work on his radar a bit.  His batting is stalwart, too.  Ngidi will get healthy, and I've liked what I've seen of him.  They can also always bring back Duanne Olivier.  I forgot why they ever dropped him.  Dude played out of his mind his second call up.  Even with Morkel, Steyn, and Philander recently retired or about to retire, SA have a plethora of bowling.

However, with Amla gone (and in poor form the last year of his career anyway), Faf in a long slump, Markram's slump and subsequent drop, they need batting more than anything.  de Kock and maybe Elgar are the only men in form.  Malan and especially Rassie show some promise at least."

Did those count towards 100% completion in RDR2?  I don't remember perfectly, but I don't recall them being on the list when you click on the completion button.  I think they were kept separate just as side challenges.  

In any case, I thought some were interesting.  Some introduced mechanics I didn't even bother thinking about, like lassoing someone from a horse and dragging them around.  But yea, if you tried to 100% the challenges, that would be a slog."
truegaming,ff4jxlt,t3_erlx59,1579565415.0,"I like how RDR2 determined ""completion"" at least as far as the completion percentage was shown on the progress tab.  They basically asked you to do a little bit of everything.  Rob one train, hold up one store, craft this or that, etc.., but it didn't ask you to really grind any one thing.  It wanted you to experience everything at least once, and that's what 100% completion should be.  

I also understand that the 100th side-McGuffin you find in another game might be in a slightly different area of the map as anything else, but the game still made it feel like a grind going there.  RDR2 made sure to at least reward you with some lore for finding a crime scene, or an interesting path leading to a spectacular vista for the next piece of a treasure map.  I forgot about the grind and for the most part, enjoyed each moment.  And again, you weren't required to do everything of something to count that part of completion.

Only ""real"" grind for me in RDR2 was collecting perfect skins for satchels, but man, having that Legend of the East satchel by chaper 3 really made life easier, so at least the reward matched the level of grind."

AskReddit,feop4jd,t1_feofc0b,1579303395.0,"I know someone who was in six figure debt that just never made any attempt to pay it.  After something like 7 years, it becomes ""zombie debt"" and no longer appears on your credit report.  His debt changed hands so many times.  Debt buyers will buy up debt for pennies on the dollar with little hope of getting the payment, but if they get even a little, they'll still profit.  They have legal channels they can go through to make your life miserable, but they can't *force* you to pay it.  I think making a payment towards that debt restarts the cycle but I may be wrong.  Anyway, this guy I knew was getting calls every few months or so from collection agencies.  I even got a call once asking if I knew where he was (I lived with him for a while like 5 years prior.  I called him and he told me that that agency had his debt currently.)  Anyway, his life was partially on hold for 7 years, because his credit went to shit, so he couldn't make any big purchases, and lived with someone else so he didn't really have anything significant in his name.

edit.  For anyone thinking that not paying off your debt is in any way a good idea, it isn't.  It also doesn't apply apparently to student loans, which is what the guy I knew had.  There is no statute of limitations on schooling debt.  I simply knew his life would be fucked for at least 7 years, but it's actually much worse."
