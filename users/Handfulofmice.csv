Eberron,ff9qgif,t1_ff97cah,1579718710.0,His google search shows multiple maps that seem suitable and are on grids?
Eberron,ff9ptc8,t3_esdpnw,1579718257.0,"The silver flame is binding an overlord within it- at least in some form I believe - Bel Shalor, the shadow within the flame. Perhaps this paladin is receiving whispers or dreams tainted by this entity."
facepalm,feyvw7i,t1_feypysg,1579451078.0,Ok man.
facepalm,feyjpc5,t1_fey9o38,1579446426.0,I think the lesson to be learned is to be respectful and not to jump to conclusions about people.
Eberron,feuedea,t3_ept85h,1579385720.0,"Maybe when they were created the creator used it as an opportunity to hide something within the Warforged- within it's memories, or subconscious, or perhaps imprinted somewhere in it's design- a certain memory or information that had to lay hidden or dormant, or perhaps a key or a clue to some advanced design- a portion of a schema...  


Someone who knew how important the Warforged was unwilling to have that information destroyed but wanted to ensure it never fell into the wrong hands and paid to have them hidden away..."

...probably fine."
hockey,fegudsh,t1_fefp85a,1579102745.0,"I mean, the only time in the past couple months he lost even two in a row was in the middle of December, I don't see how he lost you five games in a row, but maybe one of the other two guys in your league can use him."
facepalm,fefugip,t1_fefu5l9,1579065570.0,I feel the computer chair question is the more challenging one actually.

OldSchoolCool,fdsjsc9,t1_fdsbmaq,1578704041.0,It’s a basketball thing.
Eberron,fdnpvlv,t1_fdnp57z,1578590614.0,I think we sort of agreeing then. Apologies for misunderstanding you.
Eberron,fdnns4y,t1_fdnmts7,1578589614.0,"That’s fine, if you want to run your game that way. I detailed ways in which wish would still be fairly impactful without allowing you to undue the fabric of reality. I think the most important thing is that it provides a satisfying ending or platform for the story to build off.

But it’s worth mentioning that the prophecy is such an ancient and fundamental magical property of the world that if you allow this, almost everything should be fair game with a wish. Reading the description of wish, it’s far from that."
Eberron,fdmx76w,t3_em53rs,1578569873.0,"It’s difficult to comprehend this wish working completely- like wishing away a plane or the oceans or something, it’s a fundamental part of reality. But the wish is that it becomes impossible to comprehend? That could open up some interesting options. 

Perhaps the wish takes all existing traces of the prophecy and makes them illegible- but the prophecy has the capacity to regrow, like clear cutting a forest. So this sort of resets everything for a short period of time. Lords of Dust and the Chamber would see all their plans sort of unravel. Power would shift and it could have world shaking impact. Perhaps the dragon marks stop functioning for a time. A day of reckoning so to speak, a shake up of the world.

It would be sort of cool if some dragons/sages etc, had actually used the prophecy to predict its own destruction (recreation). Perhaps they felt it was necessary or there was a deeper reason..."
