dogs,fdhkavp,t3_ele34n,1578424453.0,"That clearly is animal abuse.  I would have smashed that cunts face in.  “Train your own dog”.  She’s lucky you’re nice.  Other people would simply smash her face in for treating animals like that.

Rest assured, that dog is not happy that she’s doing all that to him.  He may ‘look’ ok; only because dogs love unconditionally."

dogs,fc7375f,t3_egbn40,1577496318.0,"I stand by this phrase.  We’d go into debt with our dog.  We had to take him to the ER one day and paid over $3,000 to get him well without blinking an eye.

Wouldn’t you do the same to your own kids?  Would you give up on your own kids because of a sickness or disability?  You’d go to the ends of the world for them, no matter what, right?

Dogs are exactly like that for us."
