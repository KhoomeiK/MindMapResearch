AdviceAnimals,ff7j9bg,t1_ff6pjdf,1579650853.0,"Though some people abuse the welfare system, the cost of abuse is often less than the cost of preventing the abuse. Some preventative measures punish those who do not abuse the system or act as a deterrent to people using the system.

Any abuse of the system is bad, but I think that there are bigger fish to fry when it comes to abuse of taxes and tax supported supported systems. A single rich tax dodger can have the same societal cost as thousands of welfare cheats. I'm not so worried about welfare abusers unless the cost their abuses becomes significantly higher than the cost of prevention."
bonehurtingjuice,fej5dqw,t1_feirhja,1579157563.0,"Where I live, it is nearly as expensive to live an hour away as it is downtown. Considering that I don't need a car downtown and that my job subsidizes my rail pass, it's actually significantly cheaper for me to live downtown.

There are shortages of adequately priced housing in most major metropolitan area. Prices are high pretty much everywhere that has decent access to in-demand jobs.

This isn't a city vs suburb vs rural thing. The reality is that jobs tend to be highly concentrated and anywhere within driving distance is going to be expensive."
bonehurtingjuice,feip8kq,t1_feibnpf,1579143818.0,"ISPs are the first analogy that came to mind for me too. Real estate is limited and there are only so many affordable options in high demand areas like cities. Hell, I know someone in San Francisco who let someone camp in her yard and share the kitchen and bathroom for $800 a month.

I got lucky during college and found a caring landlord who owned a few small properties in Boston and took great care of them. Nearly every other option in my price range was building owned by larger companies the local media literally called ""slumlords""."
bonehurtingjuice,fei4abv,t1_fei3aa3,1579129963.0,"So do they move to the adjacent, equally shitty apartment building, or do they move 50 miles away from their job where prices are better, but they have a 1.5 hr commute each way?

Most people don't individually have the kind of agency you're talking about. Almost like they'd would have to form some sort of organization that can collectively bargain or lobby for fairer prices and better conditions."

Almost like he abandoned it and someone else was left to finish it off in their spare time with a smaller budget. Looks like he tried to collect some royalties a few years after publication but I don't think it went too well for him. Interesting content though, thanks for sharing."

Want to be clear that I'm not advocating drinking and driving or skirting the law. Just want to say that cops are people too and they can make errors just as easily as you can, possibly to your benefit."
