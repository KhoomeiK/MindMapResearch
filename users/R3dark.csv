That it's okay not to do anything sexual and you dont want to risk ruining the relationship over something like that. And just be aware when you are hanging out with her when you start to get into that mindset, think, is what I'm about to do or say driven by this mindset?

AskMen,fe72lyf,t3_enthrb,1578909096.0,"The amount that society impacts men is quite substantial,  not only are there outside pressures from friends, peers, coworkers etc. But even with ourselves, I constantly find myself beating myself up if I think in a way that doesn't conform to the societal standard for men, I refuse to think of myself as a victim in any situation,  even this one. At this point it's hard for me to even consider that society is the problem, versus the problem lying within my own conciousness and the fact that I'm either insecure about the fact I'm not as masculine as I want myself to be or that I need to just man up and deal with it. Its confusing and adds on to a lot of the daily stress."

AskMen,fdn6alc,t3_elwlva,1578578465.0,When I was 17 I was working at chipotle when a 24 year old coworker would constantly send me nudes and rub her ass on me while working. I'd try to walk by her and she'd just try to pin me or grind on me while I walked by. In front of coworkers and customers alike. No one really said anything but I assume it was pretty obvious what was happening. Was fairly uncomfortable at the time but kinda just forget it happened now.
