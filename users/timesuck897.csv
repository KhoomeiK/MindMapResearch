When the body does not have enough glucose for energy, it burns stored fats instead; this results in a build-up of acids called ketones within the body. At the time, no one knew why or how ketones helped reduce siezures. It does help with weight loss because you are only eating meat and vegetables, and it was used for children because parents control most of their diet. Eating healthier and less processed food is good for you, but long term starving your body of glucose is not healthy."
