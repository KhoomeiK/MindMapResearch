Gestation starts counting around 2 weeks before conception from the end of MC's last period) So if they are jumping some time each chapter, MC could be like 12-15 weeks gestation.

waiting_to_try,fengpzh,t3_eq0sr0,1579284320.0,"How I understand the IUD is similar to what you said.  I'm almost certain that I do ovulate still, as I get the mittelschmerz, egg white discharge, and my libido is always a lot higher about two weeks before my period.  But then I do still get a regular 12-day period(long, heavy periods were my normal previously) every month, albeit slightly lighter than it was before.  I have had the Skyla for over two years, so that's just all normal for me.

So I think the way the IUD works is slightly different for everyone.  Some may ovulate, and some may not.  The progesterone definitely keeps the uterine lining thin and the mucous around the egg thick, but whether or not you release an egg seems to depend on how your body individually reacts to the hormones.  

If you are trying to track in order to eventually have another baby, though, now would probably not be a great time to do so.  When the IUD comes out it is entirely possible that your cycle would change a bit anyway.  

All that said, to answer your question on temping, my temperature seems to go up when I'm ovulating, and usually drops very low the first day of my period.  I've never specifically temped, this is just what I have noticed over the years."

TwoXChromosomes,fcl5tfi,t3_ehlo0t,1577740439.0,"There were months where, because I bled so heavily before birth control, I would pay $40 for my feminine products.  So there was a time where I didn't posess that money and would skip work because I didn't have any feminine products.  Now I have an IUD and a menstrual cup and make a living wage, but it is rough out here for those of us who bleed."
AskReddit,fcl4io1,t3_ehn3ua,1577739638.0,"Keto diet, before you come at me about how successful it was for you, I understand.  It will make you lose weight, but if you do it too long you will die.  It's named after diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a serious, life-threatening condition.  I've heard people glorifying the fact that they put their body into ketoacidosis.  Don't do it.  Your body needs carbs for energy, and yes fat can be burned for energy, but your body prefers carbs and your brain needs them to continue their normal processes.  Obviously have everything in moderation, though.   

Also, human growth hormone.  If someone touts it as the fountain of youth, run the other way.  It will mess your body up in all kinds of ways.  Your body makes it on its own, yes, but your body knows how much it needs and supplementing that has bad consequences.  

Finally, to end my rant, trail mix and granola bars are just candy."

Probably all in my head, though, so I should probably fast for the next three weeks just in case."
AskReddit,fcjln2m,t3_ehg5ac,1577692746.0,"Intuitions are crazy.  When my (now husband) boyfriend and I were long distance, I once took the bus to visit him.  His parents were going to pick me up from the bus depot.  I was wandering around, trying to find them, and went to go through a door when a dude held the door open for me.  I thanked him and tried to go on my way, but felt weird about it.  Dude said, ""looking good, baby"" to me, and I tried to move past him but he grabbed me by the wrist, and I looked in his eyes and just knew he had bad things planned.  So dude starts pulling me back towards the door.  I had mace hooked on to my pants for this reason, but was so shocked I couldn't move to grab it.  I just prayed that my boyfriend's parents could find me, because there wasn't anyone else around in the area of the depot we were at.  Just as I started thinking that this guy was going to kidnap me, my now mother in law burst in to the room and kind of scooped me around into a hug, and dude ran off. My now mother in law said they were lost trying to find me, but she suddenly knew where I was and that I needed help.  

Then another time, I was out walking my then roommate's dog for her at night.  We lived in a neighborhood that wasn't terrible but definitely secluded and a little shady.  The end of the road was by a dead end and some train tracks, so I was just trying to loop the dog down to go to the bathroom and come back.  As we were heading down, though, there was a guy there dressed in dark clothing talking on his phone and just staring at me.  So I hooked around so I was closer to a friend's house that lived down the street from us, then started sprinting back to our house with the dog running beside me.  Got inside safely, but found out several days later that the guy had been arrested for raping and murdering a girl.(not a crime that happened on the dog-walking night, but still a creepy coincidence)."

I accidentally had nerdy twin wear her special dress to win her girlfriend back, and I didn't even notice because I was mindlessly tapping while watching Jane the Virgin.  I only noticed when she later was like ""Glad I wore this dress"".  Biggest diamond waste ever!"

thebachelor,fcidcz6,t3_eh35br,1577660867.0,"I imagine it would be strange to be in such a public-driven job after being on the bachelor/bachelorette, too.  This franchise comes with some fame, so if the physician were to go back to work after their season, they might get people making appointments with them just to say that they talked to someone famous.  That goes for females and males, I think.  Would just make the physician/patient relationship super weird, too, even if the patient was already established with them before the show.  I know I would feel weird about watching my doctor fall in love on TV."
