I've never met a guy who didn't laugh about those jokes, even if it is with cringing. So yeah, don't complain about getting your junk hit then. That's why you don't want women to complain about the pain of child birth. 3 times compared to how many dozens of times? Our pain creates life, your pain creates people snicking for like 30 second"

I was extremely upset about it at first. This isn't bad advice honestly. I struggled with anorexia when I was a teen and it's been very hard to accept that i will never be THAT skinny again, cuz my body did change some. I can be a perfectly healthy weight but my hips ARE wider, I DO have some loose skin on my stomach that only surgery can get rid of, and these stretch msrks aren't leaving any time soon.

I dated a guy for almost 2 years and lived with him for a year that was lactose intolerant. I never expected him to eat anything that would irritate him. I even made sure if I got ice cream for me and my kids, that I got him some good lactose free ice cream. It's just being considerate to someone you love. I am allergic to some of the spices in sausage and can't eat it. If my husband gets saudage for a meal of some kind or the kids, he always makes sure I have something else to eat.

So, I'm not gon a spend every second he's on there making sure he doesn't call when I could disable that feature and let him have fun. Downloads are password protected for now too because my ""genius"" father left his card info on there and my older son bought all the fnaf games and some other ones that totalled up to like $50 off my dads card. I was a single mom until 2 years ago so yeah, sometimes I would give my kids their ipads so I could make a meal in peace without worrying about kids running into the kitchen constantly. Hence why parental controls exist, to keep young kids safe and from just doing dumb kid things like that. I also set a curfew on it of like 11pm and 6am because I kept catching them sneaking into my room and trying to get them in the middle of the night on a school night. When they get a bit older, I will remove these settings but right now, they are kinda needed for them to use their iPad's. Also caught my older son talking to strangers on roblox and even told them his school! Scared the shit out me cuz we had already had a talk about what info was safe to share so disabled chat on roblox for him too. I don't like being overbearing but, well, they are kids. They aren't smart enough yet to be safe and not obnoxious without help. When they are like 13 or so (hopefully lol) they will be a lot more mature and can listen about online safety and realize it's serious. No days, one message can lead to someone knowing exactly where you live. If your kids have access to the internet, you gotta be careful."
