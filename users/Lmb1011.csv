AlmostFamily,ff7gyw5,t3_erxnz7,1579649317.0,"I think thats actually part of why this show has a problem finding its footing, when people hear the concept they expect Leon to be the villain of the show. What he did was reprehensible. However, the show wants the drama to be between the sisters and Surprise Siblings more than focusing on Leon and his actions since that was just the framework for the story they wanted to tell. So now we have a character painted in a redeeming way who has done nothing right? and in the current MeToo climate it definitely doesn't sit right with a lot of people. 

I think it probably would have done better if they had killed Leon off and discovered his secrets that way, just take him out of the equation entirely"

I read it less than a year ago and I don't remember much of what happened. It had a pretty interesting cliff hanger but it wasn't enough to keep me hyped on the series.

I will say at least part of my enjoyment of Perfume the movie came from Alan Rickman being in it so if you're a fan of his work, then perhaps if you watch is its own thing and not an adaptation it might be okay ;) the movie is a wild story that i'm just so curious how it got there.

That being said I know Marissa is definitely interested and onboard with adaptations based on AMAs she's done in the past but I don't know that we'll get so lucky.

Hazel's theory of evolution - Lisa Jenn bieglow 


Is a middle grade book that deals with a young girl coming to terms with a lot of changes in her life. One of her.moms is pregnant after suffering a miscarriage (and Hazel is scared what will happen to her mom/the baby) she is going to a new school (and scared she'll lose her best friend) and in general just growing up. It's really well written and at 30 it had me in tears by the end, because it was just so ... thoughtful and in the nose about growing up. It is a happy book overall and isn't Dark but it does deal with loss so it's up to you if it's what you're after. I know Lisa Jenn Bieglow has written other books and I haven't read them yet but I imagine they are just as well written. 



I also second a few books I saw listed:

Beauty queens - Libba Bray (she's a fantastic author and I recommend everything she's written. Diviners series being my favorite)


Lunar Chronicles - Marissa Meyer (and also renegades series)



Sisterhood of the traveling pants - Anne brashares 
Okay I forgot about a major plot point in tbe first book that deals with terminal illness and death so NOT super light 
are a bit dated and do cover some heavier topics but overall are pretty light reads. Definitely read them all in short sittings. Just avoid the 5th one if you don't want to deal with heavy content. That one gets darker than the rest"

AmItheAsshole,fcnebic,t1_fcncz6c,1577809936.0,"I used to be said I had a basic name, basic spelling, and it didn't lend itself to nicknames. I vowed if I had kids to give them more unique names.



Except why I viewed as unique were names I didn't hear often growing up. Lynette, Sophia, Juliet, Tobias


Which... Of course are all maybe not common but definitely more common than 80/90s names. What passes for unique know is occasionally alarming. 


Supposedly there is a KVIIIlynn (Katelyn but the ""8"" is Roman numerals) and my God. Just name your kid Katelyn or Caitlin. Why do you have to be so rediculous"

I'm just waiting for the hype around to dwindle and then I'm gonna sell it for like half price on letgo

as for recommendations, i'm going with mostly authors:  
Emily Giffin, Sophie Kinsella - adult contemporary/romance 

Rosamund Lupton, Gillian Flynn, Ruth Ware, Paula Hawkins - thriller 

Kate Quinn & Sara Gruen - historical fiction 

the Leftovers - Tom Perotta

Cormoran Strike Series - ""Robert Galbraith"" (which is actually J.K. Rowling)

I would assume one or two people are responsible for the over well caretaking of the animal, in this case feeding/water/litter and they'd be the ones to take them home if needed. 


If it was an office dog I assume there would be an Owner for it. Someone who basically just has a dog that comes to work with them every day"
