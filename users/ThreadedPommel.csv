modernwarfare,ffaufqe,t3_eshjdn,1579744743.0,"Why are they doing these updates in separate chunks like this? Fuck us mediocre internet people right? Normally I can just start large updates before I go to work so I domt have to wait, but I cant do that when they do shit like this."
modernwarfare,ffau6b7,t3_esjgpe,1579744572.0,I hope people dont bitch about this. Less head glitch spots is better. BF4 solved the head glitch problem by doing the exact thing on the right picture for their entire maps.
modernwarfare,ffatzsr,t1_ffapwj9,1579744450.0,"That's a bit of a liberal use of the word literal,  but okay my dude 🙃"
modernwarfare,ffatv5d,t1_ffa26mw,1579744365.0,Any luck?
modernwarfare,ffato5m,t1_ffa8g0j,1579744236.0,You just gave me a bit of nostalgia mentioning Noshahr canals
modernwarfare,ffao4b7,t1_ffan24u,1579740517.0,The ding is really easy to miss considering how poorly the audio is mixed in this game. I just find it an unnecessary inconvenience for little to no benefit because the hud is in no way obtrusive imo. Doesnt really seem all that cluttered to me.
modernwarfare,ffanug1,t1_ffanbf9,1579740332.0,"I find it to be the opposite. My friends that play hardcore are pretty decent but when they switch to core they suck absolute ass. They cant control weapon recoil, they don't aim for the head or chest. They're just so used to 2 tapping everything that they cant handle it 🤷‍♀️

Meanwhile whenever I switch to hardcore from core I tend to do pretty well but I just find it unnecessarily frustrating."
modernwarfare,ffamspv,t1_ffajmn6,1579739624.0,One of my other reasons for disliking core is the lack of hud honestly. CoD isnt cut out to be a mil sim and removing the hud just makes it frustrating imo. Why intentionally deprive yourself of quality of life elements?
modernwarfare,ffamnef,t1_ffam5dj,1579739521.0,Every weapon being practically OP isnt a healthy balance imo. What would be a better balance is bringing all the core guns up to the m4s level in terms of viability. Not make every gun a 1 shot kill. That's just boring imo.
modernwarfare,ffajvm7,t1_ffajj7q,1579737549.0,You dont show up on the radar when you shoot in this one though.
modernwarfare,ffajdp5,t1_ff9m4sg,1579737184.0,Canted iron sights would be cool
modernwarfare,ffaj9pl,t1_ffae425,1579737102.0,Hardcore just rewards pure reaction. You don't even have to learn to control weapon recoil because you only ever have to shoot people twice at most. I also personally dont find it fun to get one shot in the chest by pistols. It just throws weapon balance out the window.
modernwarfare,ff7sute,t1_ff60hfp,1579657532.0,"Yeah, modern warfare is nowhere near close to being a mil-sim"
modernwarfare,ff7skab,t1_ff6ukkv,1579657330.0,"Nah, they downvoted him because hes being elitist about a video game skin."
modernwarfare,ff7rjgq,t1_ff6qyx2,1579656622.0,"Its still artificial difficulty with endlessly spawning enemies that spawn wherever they please. Theres nothing tactical about it, its still very poorly designed."
modernwarfare,ff7r62r,t1_ff6mke2,1579656361.0,Combat knife would work fine
ABoringDystopia,ff64fkq,t1_ff5qyde,1579618871.0,I think it fits quite well. A lot of stuff from places like r/antiwork and r/LateStageCapitalism could definitely overlap here.
apexlegends,ff5ttlm,t3_erqrma,1579609997.0,Gold knockdown shields ruin the final circle of always be closing. This is a huge oversight.
apexlegends,ff5t0nr,t1_ff5sown,1579609131.0,Waiting minutes? Ok sure. If you dont quit and we're the only squad in the area and theres a respawn beacon in the POI I will respawn you so you can loot before more squads show up.
apexlegends,ff5sbji,t1_ff5rnd9,1579608362.0,"I can't count how many times my squad mates have gone down and I come to rescue them and I wipe the other squad, but it doesnt matter because my impatient teammate quit right before I did so. And there's always a respawn beacon right there every time it happens."
apexlegends,ff5r4y3,t1_ff5qsim,1579606959.0,Do you mean you want to quit faster when *you* go down or your *squad* goes down?
apexlegends,ff5qoou,t1_ff5q6ee,1579606378.0,So you're one of those. Cant even wait 5 seconds to see if your team wins the fight?
modernwarfare,ff5btb3,t1_ff4dlhi,1579586540.0,Why you so hostile for no reason?
beholdthemasterrace,ff519xc,t1_ff3r1p4,1579577523.0,"Putting all of your weapons on display kind of defeats the purpose imo. If you were worried about a tyrannical government, why would you put a target on yourself like that? Oh that's right, its because those gun nuts dont actually support the 2nd ammendment, they just want to look like tough guys to cover up their insecurities."

apexlegends,fewp8qa,t3_eqmfnc,1579417424.0,I hope they can add this to the normal game and have it be like the newer battlefront games where you can switch between 3rd and 1st person with a button push.

ATBGE,few485e,t1_feujlme,1579405135.0,"It's not an officially recognized phobia, so yes that's exactly what hes saying. You cant just self diagnose a phobia. It's like the OCD thing all over again. It's a crippling anxiety disorder not a quirk."
ATBGE,few3qj1,t1_few1fmq,1579404920.0,That's still not a phobia. Phobia is an intense and crippling anxiety disorder.
ATBGE,few3brg,t1_fet2xf4,1579404775.0,Because they're using a word that has weight in medical terms and it is not an officially recognized phobia. It's something the internet made up. That's why.

Allowing some small extra pieces and a little tape opens up the possibilities a lot more. Think of it more like a small model plane made of paper.
