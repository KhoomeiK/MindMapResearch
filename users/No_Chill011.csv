You bring up a valid point with ‚Äúwhat the point‚Äù syndrome. I‚Äôll even add on lack of confidence with our government. I don‚Äôt have to tell you what the senate approval rating is. 

Most non voters have one thing that republicans voters don‚Äôt. Non voters don‚Äôt subscribe to any bullshit ‚Äúteam‚Äù and they don‚Äôt worship politicians. Sure a lot of them don‚Äôt vote because they‚Äôre conspiracy theorists. But that just piles on to the distrust that Americans have of their own government.

If we were willing to go as far as taking out their top general, what would we do if they continued to attack us?

Iran's ruling class will no doubt see the Soleimani strike as an act of war. But then, in many ways, the Iranian regime has already declared war on us. They made that very clear when they attacked our embassy in Iraq which is American soil.
