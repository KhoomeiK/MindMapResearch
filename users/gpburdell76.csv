thisismylifenow,fes85wb,t1_fes7tst,1579362409.0,Yep sent you a DM; don’t think the rules allow links to purchases.
thisismylifenow,feozdyg,t1_feohpqe,1579308700.0,"Yeah, I just use a tiny drip mostly to congeal the oils and debris. The cleaner holds about two cups of water so a drop seems pretty small, plus I rinse the glasses off in the sink too for an extra rinse. No burning eyes for years."
thisismylifenow,feoz7nt,t1_feogo4p,1579308591.0,"I don’t know about links to products but if you DM me OL send you the link. Here’s a pic of it with my glasses.

thisismylifenow,feoz3dk,t1_feogw45,1579308519.0,"I read that same thing. I bought this one that has 1) a plastic basket that separates it and 2) the lenses never touch metal. It’s worked great for a few years with no scratches. Pic attached.

thisismylifenow,feo7gsp,t1_feo725o,1579296182.0,"The ultrasonic comes from the device shaking and vibrating rapidly, but it doesn’t wobble around and is more of a hum. As for it damaging glasses, I’ve used it with two pairs just fine. It just makes the water ripple a bit. I add a tiny drop of dishwater detergent to hot water and after about a minute everything is clean."
thisismylifenow,feo661a,t1_fenoee0,1579295644.0,One of the best things I bought is an ultrasonic cleaner off of Amazon. It’s staggering to watch the clouds of oil and dirt that shake off of your glasses in the seams.
