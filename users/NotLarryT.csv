LifeProTips,felv0ds,t1_felto6s,1579231617.0,"Probably because people say ""no"" or hangup the phone. Some people refuse to do it because they don't want sued or be responsible in any way. I (and probably OP) imagine that most people who aren't CPR certified are unaware of how crucial it is. The idea of waiting for EMTs is a sure way for the person to die. CPR maintains blood flow to the brain when your heart isn't doing it. Even if you aren't doing a great job and/or break bones, you kept the person's brain intact. You only have like 5 minutes before brain damage starts, EMTs will not be there by then. It should never be a question of ""should I do this?"" That's a human being that you know will die if you or someone doesn't do this. I agree that OPs delivery was lacking but, it is worth knowing how important CPR is, regardless of how good you are at it.
ETA: I forgot to address that, I also agree that it's not really a pro-tip. Probably why it was taken down. It's another example of posting ""Be a decent human being"" on LPT which is not the purpose of the sub."
