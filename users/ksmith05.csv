Enneagram,ffcitvg,t3_eso5ru,1579800385.0,"When I was like 6, our playground at school had a small hill cliff edge thing that was short enough to run down but steep enough to pretend to hang from. I would always lay down it and I would pretend and ‚Äúbeg‚Äù one of the girls to save me! So funny and tragic of me. No idea why I had such a fascination with this."

Half Filipino is always interesting because there is already (seemingly) a lot of mixture into the society as is, so the Asian look is less dominant usually in halfies like myself."

lolgrindr,ff6o3i9,t1_ff6c55r,1579631325.0,omg this is always so weird to me. my commute is < 15 minutes to work so I leave pretty last minute and often jerk before I head out. The quick mind flip/switch from insanely horny me to reserved office me is always something I find interesting.
askgaybros,ff6h4zr,t3_erugwc,1579627088.0,I love this! Have always wanted to go to Bali so bad. I‚Äôm glad you had a good time. I‚Äôm a believer they many areas hold strong cultural and spiritual ties that can hold you back. Traveling can help you break out of those and experience a new you! Enjoy.

Enneagram,fepe6c4,t1_fep4sxu,1579318289.0,"Hahaha I get you! I listened to a Sia album and then had a falling out with a friend. Now it‚Äôs unbearably hard to listen to that album without thinking of that friend and incurring those feels. It‚Äôs kind of a good practice to try and listen to those tunes and coax your emotions to move on, but you‚Äôve gotta be careful."

hapas,fen6a2p,t3_epz5tf,1579277907.0,I get you! I‚Äôm half white but I can pass off as full white. Living in the south I get asked a lot if I‚Äôm Latino. It‚Äôs annoying but thankfully not many people are rude. A lot depends on where you live and some of these comments make sense in the Midwest. Move out west and you‚Äôll fit it and get less questions.

Enneagram,fejotcr,t1_fejfn30,1579181927.0,It all depends on what a 9 sees as causing potential tension or conflict. You could see it in other ways! Love all the memes but they hugely narrow down the enneagram and take away from its depth at times.
hapas,feiy8p5,t3_epe0ro,1579150562.0,Is the question different when asked by a fellow Asian or hapa? Some times I‚Äôve asked because I want to relate or find some common ground (not judge or box someone in). I like trying to connect with people in that manner but realize they might be a generation or two in the state‚Äôs now.
