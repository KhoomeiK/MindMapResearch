One travel agency from my country has variety of childfree hotels to chooce from, a fantastic idea I like to say, but ofc there was buch of breeders who made fuzz about it. Even if there were lots of child-friendly options too."

depression,fegavon,t3_eoxun3,1579085470.0,"It feels like depression is your very best friend you only wanna hang out with. It is lurking in my bed and covering me up with smooth sadness like nothing else matters.  It is the only thing that understand and soothes you.Once you get there you dont’t want to come out.
 Sometimes, when I have better times in my life, I can’t even remember how I felt and what I did when I was depressed.  And vice versa, when I’m depressed I can’t belive that I was truly happy and active. Was that even me all along?"

AskFeminists,fdmz8zi,t3_elv95a,1578572196.0,"First, you need nobody’s acceptance for you to feel beautiful. It is no one else’s business than yours. Social media might give us pressure to look like certain way but it is not the reality. 

Honestly, I feel so much better after ditching instagram out of my life. I no longer compare myself to instagram models (at least so much less than before) and can look in a mirror without constantly hating myself.

There is something that wise Finnish feminist Saara Särmä  once said and it stuck with me; ”You are not aesthetically in debt for anyone.”"
