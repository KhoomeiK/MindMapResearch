I highly doubt anyone would have diagnosed that, even if she got to a hospital immediately, and not every hospital can treat every condition anyway. Cardiac tumours are VERY rare, and I don't think i've ever heard of a case like this tbh, let alone have any concrete idea on how to treat that, and even if it could be diagnosed, an anaesthetic (back in those days) would have likely killed her anyway.... There's no way Disney or those employees could be held liable, even today.

It's ALWAYS been that way, and I cannot abide anyone getting upset about it! Don't carry large quantities of cash across borders if you want to hold onto it, ignorance to the law is never a defence!

Edit. oops. Read this as cross international border, it was like 2am.... I stand corrected, and will take the downvotes. Anyone who was less than polite can go fuck themselves though :)"

If someone is in the shower and you REALLY have to go, you pick the bottle over pissing yourself. Every time! (It wasn't all that common, but when you gotta go, you gotta go. I can hold a shit though.)"

worldnews,fejv0zh,t3_epj4pv,1579186490.0,Haha. But did they announce it on CNN though.... That would have been some delicious Irony right there!

People who do that will live in a mansion. You claim they 'slum-it', because they are too lazy to move? That's bollocks. They could buy or built whatever they wanted, wherever they wanted. And it would be zero effort for them. The new house could be ready when they jetted back from the Maldives....

Nice story though."
LeopardsAteMyFace,fejeb7l,t1_feitgq6,1579169900.0,"I'm not American, have no vested interest here, but I certainly don't trust Elizabeth Warren. The lack of dirt on Bernie, after god knows how many years in office, tells me he's an honest man. If it came to a vote between Trump and Warren, why not pick the honest con man. In the words of ABBA, better the devil you know. (Warren's latest stunt with CNN tells me she can't be trusted, but is a more dangerous beast as she's smarter than Trump, though only just given the speed of her maths brain.... 2020-1990 Liz?? Fucking hell!)"
