1 Peter:5-9

>5 you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house[a] to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 6 For in Scripture it says:

>“See, I lay a stone in Zion,
    a chosen and precious cornerstone,
and the one who trusts in him
    will never be put to shame.”

>7 Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, “The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,” 8 and, “A stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.” They stumble because they disobey the message—which is also what they were destined for. 9 But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.

This seems to state that *all who believe* are members of the ""priesthood"".

Revelation 1:4-6

>4 John,

>To the seven churches in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits before his throne, 5 and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood, 6 and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father—to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.

Same as before. Unless only ordained priests are to be members of the Kingdom of God, that is.

Hebrews 4:14-16 (emphasis mine)

>14 Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. 15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin. 16 **Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence,** so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.

This one is downright laughable. How anyone can read the words ""Since we have Jesus as our high priest, let us approach God's throne with confidence"" and get the meaning ""Make sure you talk to priests instead of directly to God"" is simply bewildering.

1 Timothy 2:5

>5 For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus,

At this point the bible is literally telling you ***Jesus is the go-between from you to God,*** in big flashing letters, and you're not only completely ignoring it, but going so far as to use it to support your position?!"
news,fesedb1,t1_fes8cjq,1579364332.0,"That's Catholic dogma, and I've never heard any satisfactory explanation as to why a priest has to be involved in communion.

Luke 22 says this:
>17 And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he said, “Take this, and divide it among yourselves. 18 For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.” 19 And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”

Catholicism in general is a large M&M of pomp and ceremony with a thin candy coating of Jesus. I'm curious how the notion of Mass itself squares with the following:

>*Matthew 6:5-8* “And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him."
