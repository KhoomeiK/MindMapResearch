pittsburgh,fffe0do,t1_fffc2v2,1579881889.0,"I think she just doesn't really know anything about Pittsburgh so my hope is that she'll really like it. Portland is a beautiful city, but housing is much more expensive. The main reason I didn't like Portland was the people honestly. I met a lot of nice, great people. But I could never get anyone to commit to doing anything. People seemed put off when you asked them if they wanted to hang out without proper notice. In California I feel like people are the opposite, people just make plans on the fly and everyone is always looking to do something. Portlanders are more home body types."

tabletopgamedesign,ffeomhq,t1_ffeecx7,1579857612.0,"Why not in prototyping? It's not just for aesthetics. Lots of games have different borders or templates for different card types. I know a lot of people don't like to do any design that's not game design until their game design is finished, but there's a lot you can do in the early stages to improve your UI/UX and overall play testing."

You could play Quest for El Dorado with limited speaking quite easily I think."
boardgames,ff3neaw,t1_ff3laik,1579544772.0,"Well the game is all about pushing your luck, in both what you put into the bag and when to stop pulling from the bag. So you just got unlucky at the wrong times. This is frustrating no doubt, and is why I don't ever want to play Catan again. I've never won Catan and every game I have played I've had several turns in a row in which I got nothing and my opponents got something so it was really worse than skipping a turn. 

I don't think Quacks is quite as bad as Catan in this regard but certainly this could happen, which some people like because it can even the playing field with experienced players but also inexperienced players can get just as unlucky."

I always found that my favorite comedians on stage had pretty normal off-stage personas. They were funny, sure, but they knew their best moments were on stage and they were fine with that. Likewise, I have hilarious friends that I think would be bad comedians. 

So imo I wouldn't sweat it if you feel like you're not that funny around comedians because I don't think that necessarily transfers to how good you are on stage."

Most games in that price range are going to be pretty light strategy but a game like Villages of Valeria offers a lot of gameplay for a small box. It's similar to Race for the Galaxy but about 100x easier to teach. 

I also highly recommend checking out Craigslist or BGG's marketplace. You can often find really good deals on used games and most gamers take pretty good care of their games."

boardgames,fdy9vvt,t3_enar4m,1578777579.0,"Guardian Games in Portland, OR is a massive store that organizes their board games alphabetically and I think that works great for them because of the sheer inventory they have. It feels more like finding a book in a library.

I feel like smaller stores though may benefit by organizing by genre. Games of Berkeley in Berkeley, CA (not a small store but smaller than Guardian) does this and I really like their system. They have sections like: Party, Social Deduction, 2 player, Classics, Family, LCGs, Deckbuilding, Abstract, etc etc. I feel like because they get so specific with the genres it generally is pretty easy to find something and if not their staff is helpful. I also like this because for new gamers it introduces them to the way that gamers talk about games. So if you are new, you learn a lot just by browsing. 

There's a comic book shop near me called Dr. Comics and Mr. Games here that is primarily a comic book but has a lot of great games in stock, especially for having a rather small retail area for the games. The owner is a nice guy, he'd be a good person to ask for advice."

boardgames,fdpmjuz,t3_eme56w,1578632875.0,"This was my new year's resolution. But then I inherited a little bit of money and used like almost all of it to pay off debt and put away into savings, and some to charity. I felt like I should just spend some of it on games and let that be it for the year and ONLY IF I sell/donate the games I don't play anymore. 

So that's what I did. I bought 4 games I have been eyeing for awhile that will really enhance my collection to the level that I want it to be at and they are all games I know I will really enjoy (Brass: Lancashire, Pax Pamir 2e, 51st State Master Set and Watergate).

With that out of the way from here on through 2020, NO MORE GAMES. I'm going to play every one of them as well because I have about 60 and my partner will likely play maybe a dozen times this year so it's a bit of a challenge but I'll get it done!"

Boardgamedeals,fdg2o71,t1_fdff43o,1578377771.0,"Considering MSRP is $60 from the publisher's website, I think $54 is a totally fair price (also considering this game has stellar production value). I like a deal as much as the next guy, but I happily paid $60 for this from the publisher. It's not my favorite game, it's not a perfect game but definitely worth it's price."
boardgames,fdg1v7m,t1_fdfxam8,1578376948.0,"I second Quest for El Dorado, it's great. Only played it once but it's definitely on my radar to pick up.

I have played Wingspan maybe 10 times or so now. I really enjoy the game and I find it to be fun each time. I will say though that every time I play it I think I enjoy it a tiny bit less. The pros of the game to me are the production value, the huge number of different bird cards, the art, and much of the gameplay. The main con to me is that the game presents itself with having 3 main actions (food, eggs, draw bird cards) that are equal in importance when in every game I've played, players that focus more on the draw birds action lose and players that focus more on the other two do better. So the draw birds action just doesn't feel as exciting as the other two imo. ""Egg spamming"" is also something you'll see a lot of in the game. Everyone's last 1-2 turns is just laying whatever eggs they can for last minute points. 

Another thing I'm not a fan of is the main player interaction that Wingspan does have consists of you paying attention to which birds trigger on other players' turns. In a 2 player game (this game is good at 2), it's not a big deal but 3-5 players it can be really fiddly to keep track of when it's not your turn. 

It's a fantastic game no doubt, and I do enjoy playing it. But I feel as though the aesthetics of the game can sometimes distract from the game's (minor) shortcomings."

boardgames,fdf2y9n,t1_fdepxsy,1578352108.0,"Pax Pamir 2e was published by his own new company that he started with his brother. I don't imagine that company alone makes enough full time income for the both of them but with his other successful designs (Root, Vast, etc) he is probably a full time board game person. 

I do know that when they reprint Pax Pamir 2e they better print a lot of them because they will sell fast. I haven't played yet (waiting on the reprint) but that seems like a hell of a flagship game to start with."
boardgames,fd5liyw,t3_ejxz3y,1578178764.0,"I played this once with friends and you definitely need alliances! I also think alliances make the game more fun. It's almost a team game but you don't know who your team will be until it progresses along. Our game ended up being fairly short (or at least shorter than we expected). Some people had played before, I had not, so they taught it to me fairly quickly and I didn't think it was too difficult to pick up. 

I think in total for a 6 person game with teaching, it lasted just under 2 hours, which was perfect because two players were on a time limit and we ended at the perfect time. 

I REALLY enjoyed this game. I probably won't buy it only because I think the 5 other people who I could get to play the game were those 5 people I played with and one already owns it. Another one has Root and myself and another player own Scythe so we don't really need extra copies of those types of games. I can definitely see the clear influence of Dune's combat on Scythe though, and I really like that system a lot."
NintendoSwitch,fcxvg0y,t1_fcwz92e,1578071063.0,I'm not sure if you can.
boardgames,fcwvth7,t1_fcwq5sv,1578039727.0,I don't think so imo. You have to lose two turns basically for one resource. That's a small catch up mechanic. Maybe it should be 3 turns but not being able to get anything on your turn several turns in a row sucks and is bad design imo.
boardgames,fcwvpal,t1_fcwdlku,1578039585.0,"I think what people like most about Catan is the trading. It can be fun to decide the price of a resource your opponent needs, especially if that resource has been absent throughout the game. 

They might enjoy Isle of Skye. It's a tad more complex than Catan but I'd say less so than 7 Wonders. It's a tile placement game that relies on bidding to choose your tiles. The genius of the game is that whatever your opponents don't purchase from you at the price you set, YOU have to buy the tile. So it's a bit of a mind game setting the prices. It's a really neat game and it plays very quickly, like 30-45 min. Easy to teach as well. And it has that element of the players setting their own prices. 

QE is another bidding game that has a simple rule set but when it comes to how much money you can spend, there's no limit (because each player represents a national bank). The only kicker is whoever spends the most at the end automatically loses. So you wanna be the person who spend second to most, but most of the money spent is kept secret throughout the game. Also plays very quickly and is a simple game to teach."

boardgames,fcw42yi,t1_fcvrw3s,1578016680.0,"I see your point but I don't think it makes the game good because a bad player could just as easily roll bad rolls as often as good rolls. So it's doubly bad when they roll poorly while playing someone who also has experience and is rolling well. I see the analogy with Mario Kart but with Mario Kart there are some things you can do to make sure you aren't affected by the weapons, such as holding bananas or shells behind you to act as a shield. All experienced players will do this. Also, in Mario Kart, or at least in the newest version of Mario Kart, the boxes aren't random. What you get is more or less determined by your place. So if you are in last place, you have a much higher probability of getting items that will help you. If you are in first place, you're more likely to get things like bananas and green shells that don't do as much for you. So, in Mario Kart, the boxes system is actually more of a designated catch-up mechanism than a random one, however, it does allow less experienced players to have a chance at winning. 

But my main problem with Catan is how LONG the games are. When playing with 3 or 4 players, I might be way behind but I still have to sit there and wait for the game to end whereas MarioKart only lasts a couple minutes."
boardgames,fcvpoi8,t1_fcvkzlx,1578007288.0,"That's a good system. I'm actually quite surprised Catan has never been revised to fix this issue as nowadays something like that would be a glaring design problem in a modern game (I think Machi Koro also has this issue which is why I gave it away...to friends that love Catan ha). But any game that has the possibility of a player doing nothing on their turn, for multiple turns in a row...is just not fun to me."
boardgames,fcvezge,t1_fcvbevd,1578000702.0,"I'll play it if people really want to but I personally don't like it. I will say I have had fun playing the game, but mostly because I have fun with the people I was playing with, not because the game itself is fun. And maybe I've just had bad luck playing it. 

The thing that ruins the game for me is of the 4 times I've played, I was very unlucky with the dice. I'd have multiple turns in a row that did absolutely nothing for me and helped my opponents and once I started falling behind, it was up to the dice whether or not I'd have a chance to catch up. And the game can be LONG because when someone starts to get ahead, everyone tries to slow them down. It's like baseball, there's an average length of a game but that doesn't mean it couldn't last much much longer. 

I think it's a neat game for the time it was made, and I like the aspect of trading somewhat, but there's no dice mitigation at all and to me that totally ruins the experience. Like Castles of Burgundy has dice but if you don't roll what you want, you can ALWAYS use your dice to get workers, etc. So no turn is a total loss like they can be in Catan.

THIS 3D Catan though undoubtedly very cool and I'm surprised it only took OP 100 hours and not more."

My dad is a bargain hunter and I don't think he'd mind that the game is not new. Plus I personally couldn't justify spending 3x as much on a new copy when there was one that was basically new minus the shrink-wrap for $20 locally. I mean the game really looked like it had never been played. 

As for my brother, I gave him a game I had been meaning to play but for whatever reason hadn't got around to it. But this game in particular is a Japanese game that has both Japanese and English text on the cards. As my brother is a Japanese major in college and studied all through high school I thought he'd like this game. One reason I hadn't played the game is I thought the rulebook was a little poorly written. So I made sure that when I gave it to him I read through them thoroughly and solved any unanswered questions left by the rulebook by researching online. I then taught him and my other brother the game and we played it and had a great time. It's a good game and one that I regret not playing sooner.

I'm not saying it's a better game as I like both, but I think I agree it's more fun. Having played Wingspan with 4-5 players multiple times, I don't think I'd want to play it again with more than 3 unless everyone had played a few times before. With Parks, a 5p game with new players is not an issue because of the interaction. Players block actions from others, take goal cards that others might have been aiming for. I think the flow is just smoother. One thing I think it's clunky with Wingspan is that you need to constantly pay attention to everything everyone else is doing to see if it triggers your own cards and I always worry that I'll miss it. It's not a type of interaction I particularly like. But it's still a great game no doubt."

boardgames,fc748fb,t1_fc5wi4d,1577497106.0,Awesome! Thanks for the link. Are all the characters from the LN different?/would I need specific characters from the first game for these scenarios?
boardgames,fc4kt1s,t1_fc3dwr0,1577419594.0,"Thanks for the clarification! The rulebook is pretty good overall but yeah they don't really talk about the differences til the end, after I already went through setup. I'll know for next time though!"
boardgames,fc4kr5z,t1_fc2i7wi,1577419549.0,Yeah I think the rulebook explains that but not til the end so when you open it up and do the initial setup it doesn't mention that. I just left out the obviously Raxxon cards and bandit standees.
boardgames,fc4kp0n,t1_fc2o7p0,1577419497.0,Thanks for the tip!
boardgames,fc2fbxw,t3_efi20c,1577356961.0,"I don't know if Craigslist is used much in your area, but where I live there are a lot of board gamers so games do pop up there often. I recently got Memoir 44 and Roll for the Galaxy for $20/each from a nice guy who sold them both in like new condition."
boardgames,fc2f878,t3_efivbp,1577356780.0,"I generally don't get expansions because there aren't many games that I play so regularly that I feel I have explored all the strategies and nuances to the point that the game is stale and I need more. I also think a lot games are great in their original form, and the expansions just add more things you can do/think about without making the game any more fun. 

But I would like to eventually play a game so much that I want the expansion(s) (might be getting there with Castles of Burgundy or Clank!)."
Gameboy,fbyunxe,t3_ef0y8t,1577226800.0,The OG GBA with no backlight is pretty much unplayable in my opinion. I don't know how I used to put up with that ha.
