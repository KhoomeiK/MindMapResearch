Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ff6zqk4,t1_ff6jjvv,1579638227.0,"As a lifeguard, if there's nobody on pool or on deck we aren't guarding at all, just chilling in the guard/back/front office depending on the pool.

What's interesting to me is that there were TWO lifeguards--you only need two if there are more than say, 40 people, so maybe the glitch happened to them too or something? 

Also a possible explanation for why they were staring/said goodbye: if there is only one or two people in the pool, they are the only interesting thing to watch and if you just watch nothing you're more likely to zone out, which is frowned upon. Saying goodbye when there's only a few people makes more sense because you've just been waiting for them to leave so you can sit down and go be on your phone or talk with  coworkers or whatever. I usually only say goodbye to the last few people leaving."

It also should be said that I identify as athiest/agnostic now, and I took a confirmation class but didn't get confirmed and have faced no hostility for it. They are very accepting of everyone! I still have fond memories of growing up there."

I just wanted to say that I (cis? afab) am also confused and totally feel you- the idea of sleeping with a man scares me but I almost feel like i need to at least try it? I can't name my sexuality because I feel like i can't 'change my mind' about it, so I've just been telling people since I was 12 I was bi but now I think I might be a lesbian. I wish there was just a way to instantly know your sexuality (hence the endless ""am I gay"" quizzes I took in middle school) 

BUT I'm pretty sure that just wanting the feeling of a man to like you/wanting the attention but not anything to happen is a sign of being lesbian. There's a master doc (you might be able to find it if you Google ""am I a lesbian masterdoc"") and that's definitley listed as one of the signs. I'm not sure if it still carries the same weight in some sections if you didn't come out until you were older so societally you weren't treated in the same manner as other women (BC of performative heterosexuality) , but I think it definitley still could pertain! of course you might not be a lesbian, or even Sapphic, but from what you said in your post you definitley could be
