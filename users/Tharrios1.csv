Veterans,ff86hw1,t1_ff8663z,1579667358.0,"We literally almost went to war with Iran, who has a standing military. Army doctrine states that the Army has to be constantly ready to fight on 2 fronts at the same time. I honestly dont even believe you served and if you did you were no where close to combat. Having a strong military is insurance to protect ourselves in the event that something pops off. Of you think we dont need a strong military then you're either naive or you dont understand that the world has and will always be an ugly bloody place. I have nothing left to say on the matter."

Veterans,ff85bln,t1_ff84yq8,1579666404.0,I mean without the defense industry we wouldn't have some of the edges we have in comparison to other nations. I'm not a fan of unnecessary spending of military budget but companies like Lockheed Martin or General Dynamics provide us with our equipment because they're paid to do so. Not saying we have the best gear in the world but it'll get the job done.

Advice,fewg8gx,t3_eqrurb,1579410071.0,"On average the human body consumes approx 2000 calories a day to function. You should be consuming ATLEAST 1000 a day to stay operational and healthy. It's not that your body has gotten used to not eating, it's that your body knows it's not getting food so it's probably consuming muscle tissue (depending on fat level) for nutrients."

I will say that after a little going to the gym feels natural and you feel bad for not going. Just gotta push through at the start. For your diet make small adjustments, dont just cut everything because it will be more difficult to sustain. Make baby steps."

Grew up in an abusive environment with parents that hated eachother before, during and after their divorce. Growing up I kept to myself and no one was ever really interested in me. At 18 I joined the Army and it's where I've been ever since. Army keeps my busy and it's hard to meet anyone quality because alot of people chase the uniform for money. I dont really believe in casual stuff and at this point I guess it's better not to. I wouldn't really say something went wrong, it just hasn't aligned like everyone else."

politics,fdiptg9,t1_fdiom5p,1578448330.0,"So let me ask you this. Americans were killed by this man. He was plotting the attack on embassy. You would rather us let him get away with it and his plots to attack US diplomats overseas? Or would you rather wait for another 9/11? You can throw personal insults all you want at me and everyone else that wears a uniform. Iran has hated us from the beginning this is just years and years of tension coming to a boiling point. And like I said, theybwould slaughter you and your entire family just because of your beliefs. I understand why you're against the conflict, and I respect that. But any drop of American blood is too much. We are Americans. Were all a family and we all look out for each other (or should)."

politics,fdinw70,t1_fdiniju,1578447099.0,Attacking an Embassy is an act of war. You dont seem to understand that Solemani has killed Americans and has controlled major instability in Iraq and Afghanistan. If it was Bernie or Hillary that did this would you still be against it? There is no other reason needed to take him out. You dont understand that these people would slaughter you and your family simply for being an infidel and/or American. Wont expect someone who has never served their country in any fashion to understand. Every service member killed is a brother to every other service member.

This is probably the first time you've taken an interest in our involvement in the Middle East. The military has been at war for 30+ years, some Americans just forgot that.
