LGBDropTheT,feo9c36,t3_epxxa6,1579296845.0,"What the fuck, Woman doesn't mean ""of man"" it's a through back to when Germanic tribes used the suffix man or men to describe human beings. I believe it was Wherman and Whoman for male and female originally (likely the wrong spelling. I am sorry).
Who are these syphalitic parasites that insist on just making shit up to erase the existence of the very cultures that bore our own?"

itsafetish,feihi0t,t1_fegv2yk,1579138652.0,Well that's a fucking thing I read today. I can't think of a pronoun for that person that isn't a good old fashion pejorative.
TumblrInAction,feeplng,t1_fectbm8,1579038550.0,I've never actually seen idiocy on this particular level in public. In my Defense.

LGBDropTheT,fe4rfd8,t1_fe3qq9i,1578862085.0,If someone looks like a woman I'll probably call them such. If they look like a Darren in heels and a dress... Probably not.
itsafetish,fe4q1f6,t1_fe42p2r,1578861758.0,"In my role I've had to teach a Lady to shave her face with a straight razor to get it as close as possible due to her having higher than normal test and pcos which caused substantial facial hair growth (for a woman). Because the permenant treatment either isn't funded or has a five year wait.
The shit impacts her day to day life like nothing else but that's OK. These dudes can just cry bully society into submission."
GenderCriticalGuys,fe0bwbe,t1_fdz1e4i,1578809131.0,I enjoyed this post in its self to be honest. The way you wrote it is poetry in its self. Well the way a I read it makes it seem so at least.

GenderCriticalGuys,fdlv8sq,t1_fdjt1z8,1578533294.0,"I mean, it's not really. Many cultures around the world have rights of passage to adult hood. It's just that currently in the west the bar is set so low as to be essentially on the ground.
We don't ask anything of adults in order to be considered an adult and then we're surprised when they act like a child."
GenderCriticalGuys,fdjjftq,t1_fdhhcfs,1578473625.0,I work in a profession dealing with mental health and mens mental health specifically. This particular rhetoric in an online world has had quite a profound impact on the individuals I work with unfortunately.
GenderCriticalGuys,fdjj7xg,t3_eldrqh,1578473327.0,"From the perspective of a straight guy, who considers himself a Man. Most males of age aren't Men. Not even fucking close. They're grown ass boys with no idea about personal respect or respect for others. They dress themselves like they're 12yrs old and still manage that badly. They have no ability to consider the impacts their acts have on themselves or others and for the most part they don't care.

The ""men are trash"" rhetoric somewhat bothers me in that it even bestows that title upon these cretinous beings. They aren't Men, I really wish we could just call them what they are, Boys. They aren't mature, they won't mature and they simple don't  care about anything outside immediate self gratification. They're not men, they're boys at best. Big boys but boys.  


Edit; while I am at it. I don't believe that sexuality or gender expression has any real bearing on Manhood either. You can be the most effeminate gay dude around and still be a respectable, caring, emotionally intelligent, well mannered and dependable Man. 

/rant."

MurderedByWords,fdiej7c,t1_fdh9vqu,1578441107.0,At least we can quietly chuckle while the world burns.

LGBDropTheT,fd3735z,t1_fd30evh,1578155311.0,"Yes I know, but then there are things that are always better left unsaid. Understanding how different physiology reacts without having to ask is always a good thing. Don't get me wrong, I don't go to porn for an education, but  I would be lying if I didn't also look at it and think ""hrm, maybe that's something I could consider"" .Everyone is different obviously, and boy howdy did I get an education in my teens thanks to cocaine and very, very adventurous friends.

When these grubs try to coerce women into sex under the guise of female homosexuality... well... lets justs say that this sort of shit didn't fly in the past and it shouldn't now. They are neither men nor women. They are worms.
