worldnews,ffah4e8,t1_ffaedqa,1579735610.0,Love that you shut up once someone points out **just how dumb/small minded you are.**
worldnews,ff43kx4,t1_ff439k2,1579554783.0,"I literally said no one cares about whether you own the suit or not. You jumping to conclusions that everyone is against you because you’re a prepper makes you seem so much crazier than I imagine you actually are. 

OC made a joke, you took it 100% serious lol. You’re the definition of a snowflake."
worldnews,ff4356a,t1_ff3zt3o,1579554515.0,"No, I didn’t... my point is he was making a joke that I believe had no real insight into what he thinks about “preppers”.

Again, your condescending comments just make you come off as a dick. Hope you didn’t spend too much on that Hazmat suit, as it’ll probably never be useful for you. Hope it never is useful for you, either."
worldnews,ff3x4mj,t1_ff3vvd6,1579550772.0,"You mean his obvious joke? Cmon man, he said dying was better than sweating... obvious he was joking. 

But yeah, everyone is just attacking you because you’re a prepper. You’re not seeming crazy at all!"
worldnews,ff3urub,t1_ff3fkc5,1579549299.0,"Your arguments come off very condescending. And, frankly, you’re ignoring his valid point: owning a hazmat suit for personal use IS a bit excessive and odd. I doubt anyone really cares that you own one, but to say “this is why I own one” when there aren’t confirmed cases outside of Asia is odd, to say the least. Seems like you’re just trying to confirm your unwise/unnecessary purchase."

worldnews,fesqzp3,t1_fesc46w,1579368086.0,"Honestly, it doesnt seem like a minority. Especially when the Chinese government has said stuff to their citizens about it... They’re notorious at ALL tourist hot spots. Not sure how you can argue it’s a minority of Chinese travelers, honestly. Just seems like you don’t travel much."

You’re the worst, honestly. Someone who looks at what others do and says “well what I’m doing isn’t that bad, so I’m good!” No, you’re an idiot. And your attitude does suck, buddy."

worldnews,fdq2omd,t1_fdpspox,1578651910.0,"No, not at all. It’s more like if you thought someone was going to kill you, so you pointed your gun at the door and shot the first person to walk through... who happened to be your buddy, showing up for drinks but slightly later than you expected him. But now he’s dead because you’re an idiot."

LaptopDeals,fdg37sp,t1_fdg2nv8,1578378333.0,"Personally didn’t like the Y540. Ran very hot and my hardrive crashed after less than 3 weeks medium-use (light gaming 2 hours/day max). Returned it!

I read of other people’s’ hard drives crashing too, so I know I’m not the only one. YMMV

Edit: I did get the Y540 cheaper than this, though. I feel like there may be better deals at this price point, especially if you don’t need that hardware"
OldSchoolCool,fdg2q92,t1_fdfyzud,1578377829.0,"I, and most people reading this thread, disagree. Language isn’t always perfect anyway, and in a lot of ways can be understood differently person to person. So not like it actually matters a lot, right?

Plus, my comment was mostly pointing out that Gadfly is the douche here."
OldSchoolCool,fdfux1u,t1_fdfu1a9,1578370868.0,"Based on context clues, it’s clear what OP meant. Maybe if you’re a non-native English speaker you wouldn’t understand as easily, but I have a hard time believing people from England or Ireland or wales wouldn’t understand what OP meant. 

Your comment actually paints **you** as the douche, funny enough. The fact that you generalize about an entire nation of some 1B people really says a lot (is that how many people live in America? It’s around there)."

worldnews,fdepf1l,t1_fdcaiak,1578343858.0,Lol all of your points have been anecdotes and have no real weight in any argument.
worldnews,fdepbon,t1_fdcgw1g,1578343803.0,"This entire comment is anecdotal... in my experience it’s the exact opposite of what you stated: people only go to the armed services to escape lack of education or lack of a well paying job. Both of our arguments boil down to nothing because we’re only familiar with our own experiences and not the nation’s at large.

You need a better argument to speak so factually."

“Whatever goes” definitely doesn’t include mob justice in the sense of a lynching or anything similar. That’s outrageous you’d jump there and relate it to what I’ve said (he deserves what he’s gotten)."

Bumping into someone’s butt on accident is absolutely not even close to being the same as smacking someone’s butt. One is a conscious decision, one is an accident that is usually just ignored.

The run, deservedly, was roasted and charged with a crime. Nothing you’ve said really changes that he was in the wrong and deserved what happened to him. You just made very poor arguments, if that was your goal."
