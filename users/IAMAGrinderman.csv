qotsa,ff8bwt1,t1_ff7q718,1579672301.0,"I swear I remember an interview where Josh was asked about the possibility of them working together and he said that he doubts it'll happen cus both of their egos would get in the way. Maybe that's why people think they wouldn't be buds?

Seems like a weird reason for them to not work together. Trent Reznor is famous for being a control freak and perfectionist, tho he's collaborated with Josh a few times. It's a shame that Josh and Jack probably won't do anything tho. A project from them around the time of Icky Thump and Era Vulgaris would have probably been the coolest thing of my teen years."
AskReddit,fem1x1v,t1_fel8uax,1579237079.0,"This makes a lot of sense. Me and one of my brothers will occasionally binge on shows like My 600lb Life or Hoarders just so we can be like ""holy shit, I'm a mess of a person, but at least I'm not even close to being this bad"". It's quality reassuring entertainment."
worldnews,feiyu10,t1_fehnbjm,1579151073.0,"It's not gonna be listed as your cause of death, but decreased mobility is definitely related to mortality. Everyone agrees that sedentary lifestyles aren't healthy, but now we can add in that it's actually painful to get up from the couch. Never mind the impact on your mental health from being in constant pain as well as not being able to socialize since just walking is incredibly painful. It all adds up and leads to a much earlier death."
eu4,fe62pzi,t1_fe4ycdx,1578880454.0,"I dunno. That game would have been played in spring-summer of 2018, so it would have been on whatever patch was out at the time. I haven't really played much since late 2018 either, so I don't know much about what can be done on recent patches."
AskReddit,fe5r0dg,t1_fe4iitv,1578873308.0,"The strip was pretty cool when my family lived there. Mainly for the interesting stuff in the casinos (like I thought the recreations of various historical things was cool, the circus act at circus circus was fun). I was way too young for gambling at that time, so I wasn't able to fall into that trap. I'm not sure if I'd feel different now tho. 

Fremont Street was trash tho. My mom insisted on going several times while we were living there, and I fucking hated it. The show they were doing at the time wasn't interesting (some 70s music related thing) and all the people trying to hustle were irritating as hell. I almost got into a fight with one guy that was way too pushy trying to peddle whatever bullshit on me when I split off from my family for a bit."
AskReddit,fe08ib3,t1_fe00kmq,1578805961.0,"For what it's worth, I've asked loads of questions about what's being done while getting tattooed, and I've definitely called it a ""gun"" and I've never gotten that reaction from either artist that I've gone to. I got some stuff done yesterday, called the thing a gun, and everything carried on as normal with lots of jokes, banter, and chatting about all sorts of random shit."
eu4,fdssxz8,t1_fds8sj1,1578707534.0,"At least in older patches, alliances could be useful for putting down your rebels. Forevers ago I had to break my alliance to France in my revolutionary Catalonia game because we were super close allies and they kept coming into my territory to kill off my revolutionary rebels.

 If I wasn't trying to fall to rebels, I'd have appreciated it. I can just park my military in one of your provinces and have you kill my rebels for me? Hell yeah, I'll take that 90% of the time (except revolutionary rebels obviously). Tho I had been allied to France for most of the game by that point (basically from 1450ish up to like 1710 iirc), basically had open borders with them (we both had military access to each other) and had really high relations and trust. Might be hard to replicate it?"
todayilearned,fdpmifj,t1_fdpjjf8,1578632840.0,"Huh okay. From the basic explanations I've gotten from friends over the years, I had always thought it was one of those things where the only real difference was whether the food was blessed by a Rabbi or Imam. I didn't know the differences were deeper than that. 

That's interesting with the different levels of observance with American Jews vs Israeli Jews. Other than a few Israelis I've talked to online, I've only really known American Jews, and none of them cared about the dietary guidelines besides just knowing about them. 

I'm kinda curious what reasons there are for American Jews being more lenient/indifferent towards kosher than Israeli Jews. Is it a matter of just not having readily available kosher butchers (especially in the past) and having to make due, when most butchers in Israel would be Jewish and more likely to adhere to it?"
todayilearned,fdpen95,t1_fdpd7a5,1578626669.0,"I've known a few Jews that don't care about whether their food is kosher. Not all of them adhere to the dietary rules. 

Not only that, but I was under the impression that kosher and halal are pretty much the same rules. Am I mistaken on that?"
MorbidReality,fdm9d3m,t1_fdm8ogx,1578543068.0,"Somehow I never knew there was a video for this. Every video I've seen of them was in the time around California and Disco Volante. I never knew they were like this at any time. Kinda a psycho street preacher GWAR vibe going on in that video.

I really need to seek out some more early 90s Mr Bungle videos. Thanks dude."
stonerrock,fdfx5xj,t3_el2m2b,1578372643.0,"Looks like you're ready to follow the smoke toward the riff filled land. 

I'm impressed by how real that Photoshop looks. I wouldn't have realized it wasn't actually on your van if you didn't say so."
AskReddit,fddbwu0,t1_fdcu1xd,1578304720.0,"Didn't know there was a term for this. I've had this problem my whole life, and it's exactly what you said for me. My brain is going way faster than my mouth can, and it's like I'm jumping between seemingly unrelated thoughts (the connections make sense to me, but that's kinda meaningless when you're confusing the shit out of everyone) and it just ends up being a jumbled mess. 

I've gotten way better at controlling it, but if I'm tired or stressed, my speech is about as coherent as Trump on a three day Adderall binge."
ABoringDystopia,fddbnb2,t1_fdd3y8x,1578304320.0,"That's the only thing that held me back when I was really suicidal a few years ago. 

""Shit my family will have to clean my mess up""

""I'd really screw up these commuters day""

""It would probably be a bit of an eyesore for whoever finds me""

When you've limited yourself because of thoughts like that, you're only really left with trying to make your life shorter without actually killing yourself or attempting to get better."
bestoflegaladvice,fdd9dut,t1_fdb1z14,1578300927.0,"Yeah, it really gets to you. Ordinarily I'm mostly a sane, reasonable person. After a few months of bed bugs, being up for days on end, periodically feeling the urge to check every nook and cranny of the bed and getting spooked by anything that moves across your skin it starts to wear you down. I continued having psychological problems from it for like five years after dealing with them for maybe 3-4 months. Bed bugs will ruin your life."
bestoflegaladvice,fdd95jl,t1_fdd1kka,1578300590.0,"For about five years after my family had them I would get really worked up over blotches on my skin (I have really sensitive skin, so the bumpy, irritated skin is a normal-ish occurence for me) or having a breeze or loose thread in a piece of clothing hit me the wrong way. 

The first month or two of having them were the best thing ever too. Apparently they don't find all people to be appetizing, so me and my mom were waking up with bites all the time, but dad and brothers were totally unaffected. I thought I was going insane until we finally caught a couple and found out what they were."
AskReddit,fdczubi,t1_fdcsnuo,1578289341.0,"I wonder what that's about. I don't strongly dislike kids or anything, but I definitely don't want to deal with them. This couple I was friends with several years ago, they have four kids, they all loved me instantly. Even the two severely autistic one's that apparently didn't want much to do with anyone would want to be around me. My one friend's infant daughter ends up being passed to me regularly when she gets fussy cus she just stops crying when I hold her and talk shit to her (""silly baby, can't you use words yet?"" ""whoa, you don't see me crying! Why are you being such a crybaby?""). Same friends young sister in law is like five years old, and decided that we're best buds like the first time she met me. She always wants me to swing her around or throw her up in the air, and just won't ever leave me alone if I'm hanging out while my friend is babysitting. All the kids in the building I live in have latched onto me too for some reason. It's weird."
postpunk,fdcs1wl,t3_eke47k,1578282676.0,"Those shows they did together seemed like a lot of fun. Their cover of ""Nightclubbing"" was fantastic, and I always crack up when I listen to them doing ""Head Like A Hole"" together. I wish I could have seen the look on Trent Reznor's face when Peter Murphy said ""Trent Reznor, nine inches"" during that one lol. It had a total ""Kiera's got the ten 1/2!!!"" feeling to it, you know?

AskReddit,fd6vrjq,t1_fd6uhvv,1578196344.0,"I was only there for like a year when I was 15-16, so my memory is definitely lacking on that one. Like the only thing that's still super clear to me is how much I loved the library on Flamingo road, and being lectured by a hooker on how serious the cops are about jaywalking as she grabbed my hand and walked me to the crosswalk and made me promise to never jaywalk again."
AskReddit,fd6v1kg,t1_fd6uay8,1578196074.0,"More often than the ""let me squeeze past you..."" I'll beep at people I need to move past. Just a quick ""beep beep"" like Roadrunner I guess. I like your Lazer thing more tho. I'd feel pretty cool imagining myself shooting lazers at whoever is in my way, just to gently move them out if my path."
AskReddit,fd6rtzb,t1_fd5z44u,1578194939.0,"I think it's a Midwestern white person thing. I say that and do the ""ope"" thing, never heard any white people do it in Nashville, and even tho it's been like ten years, I don't remember hearing it in Vegas either when I was living there. 

I think it must be some sort of genetic thing for us Midwestern white people. I grew up in Hispanic and black areas, often being the only white person in my group of friends, and I still say both of those things. I didn't learn it from anyone, so wtf?"

AskReddit,fcn6izf,t1_fclx3q7,1577804566.0,"I really like both. I'm a big NIN fan, and I really like Cash, especially his American Recordings era stuff. I almost think of them as separate songs tho. Trent Reznor's ""Hurt"" is a broken 20 something who knows he's destroying himself and hurting everyone around him. He wants to do better, but just doesn't know how to. Cash's ""Hurt"" is an old man, nearing death, looking back with regret at a life of mistakes and thinking about things he'd have done differently if he could. 

Ones not better or worse than the other, they're just different perspectives on failure and regret that happen to be told using the same words."
AskReddit,fcn5t7k,t1_fcmlf8a,1577804036.0,Never mind that. I was buying beer and cigarettes when I was 16 without a middle man cus everyone who was making shitty choices knew what stores to shop at. This is only going to deter people who aren't dead set on doing stupid things.
AskReddit,fcn5i0k,t1_fcmgnfs,1577803804.0,"When I was 15-16 I knew which stores would sell me alcohol and cigarettes, I'm sure the same applies to teens, and people who recently were teens too. 

I'm 26, and look several years younger than I am, and I have stores I go to now just so I can avoid having to constantly explain ""yes, that's definitely me"", ""no, it's not fake"", ""my birthday definitely is xx-xx-1993"" and wait for someone to verify my ID is real at stores where carding is taken seriously."
AskReddit,fcj8xkq,t1_fci0r3c,1577680229.0,"Dude, I've known guys who are fat, greasy, stinky and have teeth literally rotting in their mouths that are in relationships and have kids. Objectively unattractive guys who really need to be sat down to have bathing and oral hygiene explained to them that have women that want to fuck their brains out. If they can get some, there's no way you can't. 

Work on your attitude and maybe change your expectations for what women you're trying to date, and you'll probably be able to find someone. Yeah, not everyone is good looking, but it's not the end of the world when it comes to finding a partner."

AskReddit,fbwtbww,t1_fbwr55n,1577158879.0,"That would actually make sense.

AskReddit,fbwsz52,t1_fbwd77k,1577158608.0,"It wouldn't be so bad if people went into shopping with the same mindset as me. I'm a man on a mission, I know what I want, where it is, the ideal route to make my shopping adventure as efficient as possible, and I've added up the price + tax before I get to the register. Why is it so goddamn hard for people to plan this shit out in advance? The world would be a much better place if people weren't cluttering up stores because they can't spend five minutes thinking about what they're gonna be doing."
AskReddit,fbwsom0,t1_fbw48gz,1577158393.0,"I think clothes are mostly just designed for actual thin or properly fat people, so if you don't fit into that body shape, you're gonna have a rough time. I'm pretty fit/athletic looking, and pants are a pain in the balls to buy. Even with the athletic fit stretchy jeans, I need to go up a couple inches in waist size normally to have something that fits my thighs and butt loosely enough to not be ripped within a few months from squatting or climbing something. Never mind the struggle of trying to get that AND have pants that work with your shape too. Luckily I think I'm good for right now after my last jeans purchase. 

T shirts are cool tho, I just have to have an idea of how the fabric feels to me before I buy them."
