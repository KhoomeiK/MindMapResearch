trashy,ff86ji4,t3_es06zv,1579667396.0,That's kinda crappy. I love my super old paid off car that's been all across the country with me. I watch my brother in law get new vehicles every year and wonder how on earth they afford that. I don't think a new car really shows you're responsible in any way unless it's your next vehicle to drive forever.
Showerthoughts,ff2e134,t3_er555d,1579502294.0,Tbf I forget too and I grew up having to clean those things. Optical nice ftw.
Etsy,feuplai,t1_feud676,1579388767.0,I think that's ridiculous. Imagine if everyone just bought all the colors lol.
Etsy,feplcko,t3_eq9slg,1579323527.0,Congrats! That's awesome. = )
investing,feivwy2,t1_fei16ej,1579148659.0,Online has what a warehouse cost while a store has a lot more costs. I don't think it's ridiculous personally.
EnamelPins,feh7w0l,t3_ep1j0n,1579110978.0,Oh my goodness it's so cute!
news,fefq3pi,t1_fef8aci,1579062014.0,"I already had a friend commit suicide this summer. Someone I never expected and someone who had his shit together making 6 figures, working from home etc. Like if that isn't the life idk what is. He had a wife and daughter too. I'm just still in disbelief. = (

It's hard to think about how screwed up things are for us because of the timing of the market crash, the rise in college costs etc all at the same time. It's just crazy to me. I always expected life to be different and I'm not sure what will happen to my daughter. 

Ugh. Lol."
worldnews,fedeu8x,t1_fedcm4j,1579009575.0,We definitely don't have a choice. We need more than two parties that people pay attention to but that'll never happen. Also seems like all politicians are rich so they can't relate to anyone anyways.
EnamelPins,febuinl,t3_eo9dy8,1578962862.0,I dig it!
EnamelPins,febuep4,t3_eo8kfz,1578962809.0,"I had to read to see the meaning people were getting from it. I have one with an attachment, but it's used to collect the backers when I'm popping them off and putting the pins I make onto their backing cards. Just so much faster than doing it myself and saves my thumbs sooo much pain."
ChoosingBeggars,fea64de,t3_eo48io,1578944801.0,Yikes this makes the rest of us look bad.
antiMLM,fe8sq7l,t3_eo3jeh,1578930260.0,I'm sorry... wtf
EnamelPins,fe3ojdu,t1_fe3odky,1578851355.0,My daughter collects dragon pins. I've been just buying those as they pop up and she likes them. I make pins myself but I collect magnets and plushes lol. I think plush is a worse habit though. Pins take up so much less space.
EnamelPins,fe3obvn,t3_enckqb,1578851271.0,I really like that one on the left haha. I made a yeti once and it made it on to xbox one as an avatar so I'm partial to yetis. :D
EnamelPins,fe3nu1u,t1_fe3npu4,1578851174.0,I've seen like super tiny kirby pins people are always looking for/obsessed with on FB. Kirby is great though. Does Nintendo have official pins for him?
EnamelPins,fe3n9d6,t3_enpnzs,1578850894.0,Oh wow that's so many boards. Do you have any favorite pins?
Etsy,fdo43s5,t1_fdo21go,1578598537.0,It's just the nice way to say f off.
EnamelPins,fdi2bwk,t3_elfze2,1578434480.0,I can't wait to get mine! Ahhhh!
AskReddit,fdg3smn,t3_el2az5,1578378932.0,"Okay well idk if Don't Fuck With Cats is a TV show or not since I really just stream things, but nope. I'd nope the fuck out. I'm pretty sure Luka Magnotta was the focus and then the casino lady."
heathersmusical,fdg2asp,t3_ekt6yr,1578377386.0,This is so good!
Patches,fdg1tfj,t3_e6vind,1578376898.0,This was actually really informative ty!

corgi,fdeglqj,t1_fdeccyi,1578338582.0,Pshh I think a dog would be super happy to bounce around on the moon or something. = )

oddlysatisfying,fdd4eie,t1_fdcow48,1578294317.0,I was thinking of that too!
pinprojects,fdd31dx,t3_ekq76n,1578292748.0,"I just completed the above project but also wanted to participate in Make 100 so I have a new one that has holo stickers, magnets and a special corgi pin specific to this new Kickstarter if we raise that much. = )

EnamelPins,fd78s1e,t3_ek8g8u,1578200918.0,The dragons are from Fonation on Etsy (she just launched a shop) and the corgis are something I made (they aren't for sale yet!).
pics,fcwqj87,t3_ej7ewe,1578033691.0,Aww congrats!!
EnamelPins,fcpe25t,t3_ehg67a,1577860016.0,"I love Gameboy and actually backed a Kickstarter for a gameboy pin recently! https://etsy.me/39E32Dg <--- the artists website but I assume until we get the pins, they won't be up. She mentioned they were in route so hopefully sooooon! They are super cute!

I love that blue one on the left. It's my favorite of the two you posted. ^_^ I may need to get it!"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcln401,t1_fcjnj5o,1577751684.0,"I think regardless of race or ethnicity, if you name your kid something stupid it's annoying to everyone. Some teacher had a video with all the dumb names people give their kids now and I was like wtf. Abcde and mnop  were two of the worst ones. There are some beautiful names that already exist and we don't need 20 ways to spell names that exist because someone is trying to be special. It makes it harder on the kids and adults don't care."
Etsy,fcj1dhm,t1_fchwgzr,1577674849.0,I think people realize it and play stupid. Copyright is about to get tougher though so you'll see a lot of it go away in the near future.
gaming,fcj030k,t1_fcio0gm,1577673948.0,"I mean, if you're just tracing the outlines of the Pokemon designs (which a lot do because it's recognized), it's not really original art at all. They had the silhouettes in the tv show, all the people did was take those outlines and do stuff with them."
gaming,fcinvno,t1_fcinhdz,1577665769.0,So the Pokemon people?
news,fci9w0c,t1_fcfjsbw,1577659538.0,I can't remember my LastPass password lol.
comics,fci9gx7,t3_eh29oa,1577659377.0,Oh no. This will be me soon lol. I told my friend I'd draw a unicorn and drew the dragon first. I hope my unicorn looks half as good as the end version of this comic haha.
