NatureIsFuckingLit,ffacd7a,t1_ffa1zkp,1579732211.0,"A guy I dated in college was from there and after college, I visit him a few times. However, even the town was beautiful during the time I visit there was not much happening. While walking around and visiting the only bar we found open  he started to tell me about this foam. I always thought he was trying too hard to impress me or he was too drunk that he did not make sense and I never believe him. I thought he was so good at lying and putting a show together that somehow he finds a way to involve the locals. Even the bar tenders will mention how sometimes people will have to stay inside the bar for hours sometimes even sleep there until they can get home. After all this time now I know he was not lying."
