I actually have a degree in art, and I meet a lot of people in this industry who have a STEM degree but either couldn't break into the job market or just cracked once they got in.

I wouldn't beat the girl in the article so hard. Finding a day job is harder for some people than others for X and Y and Z reasons they may have. At least she has a part time job and is actually taking in some money from DJing (which is more than a lot of 'DJ's can say). So as much as everyone is making fun of her for her job, I'm sure if she found an easier job that pays more, she'd be doing that job, but this is what she has right now and koodoos on her for doing SOMETHING.

What Cherry wants is actually possible, just hard. When I left school I immediately paid back my loans, got a job and went to live DT with 2 roomates. Her biggest problem is that debt, once that's eliminated, she can do a shitty day job and DJ and just live in an apartment with 3~5 people.

For some people getting a 'better job' isn't gonna happen. Especially if you have a criminal record. Personally I don't really care if someone is a felon with only a part time job, they deserve to have 4 walls and a roof.

todayilearned,fens4ca,t1_feneceq,1579290014.0,"That's something people say because we feel more comfortable thinking it's hard to commit crimes versus crimes are pretty easy to commit because we as a society never expect a crime to occur (hence the fact they're crimes). Afterall they actually never caught the guy who spawned the Bed Intruder meme and that is one of the most run of the mill simple crime there is.

When you think about how much places in the world you can find yourself in absolute isolation, places you can dump bodies and places with no security cameras, depending where you live it's not hard to grab a Native American teenager at a club and drive to the next abandoned mine shaft and toss them in. The reason why not everyone does this is because there's virtually no benefit to murdering people unless you're a related to them. It's always easier to catch someone when it's ""Jennifer's estrange son who for some reason is her insurance benefactor"" as opposed to ""Trunk driver who really like brunettes between the ages of 16 and 22."" People really overestimate the police's ability to work with vague information like that.

Also it's not weird the hey day of serial killing in American history is all before DNA testing and 24 hour security cameras that store weeks worth of footage in the cloud exist.

When you think about it, getting away with a simple murder back then was pretty easy if you're not in any kind of friend group with your victim. BTK was dumb as a brick and got away with it for a long time because he killed people he was not related to. Even if the police knew it was a random serial killer, what are they gonna do, spy on every brunette in America and wait for a murderer to appear? Arguably Son of Sam was way smarter because he faked insanity and the court bought it and he was caught in a year. Why? Cause he's a goddamn New Yorker and there's no such thing as privacy there."

I DO think the Unabomber was actually a legitimately smart person who I think was very thoughtful in the sense of knowing how he wanted to live and why. BUT being smart has nothing to do with why he became a mass murderer, that has everything to do with the incomprehensible irrational hatred he had for anyone who didn't wanna fuck off into the woods and give up warm showers."
todayilearned,femvzan,t3_epye6b,1579271057.0,"The Unabomber was probably one of the only actually genius serial killers. 

Most serial killers just get away with it because of the circumstances (killing hitchhikers, immigrants, homosexuals, and other people who either are afraid of police or people just assume ran away). The Unabomber was a smart guy and to be honest, he was kinda right about how technology has taken over our lives.  


Only reason he was ever caught was his brother, one of the only other people who has contact with was like ""Huh...this guy writes like Ted...oh no.""

Canada is founded not out of a desire for independence but because English and French Canadians believed it was easier to protect ourselves from American military and economic aggression if we called our own shots (considering the British were over an ocean).   


One of the first biggest groups of refugees to arrive in present day Canada, are British refugees from the American independence. Then there are the French Canadians who were the majority at one point and essentially wanted to make a country where a French majority would protect them from the wealthy English elites. And they've passed on their DO NOT JOIN attitude.

Joining the US is just an idea that kinda flies in the face of the ancestors of older white families. Plus a lot of immigrants came here because our social programs are great if you have young children. I can't imagine birthing a child in America, it would be too expensive."

Now our knowledge adds up to a bunch of vague carvings that don't really tell us a lot other than people liked music and drinking...which is probably how we'd be remembered.

It's not crazy to think we might one day have some kinda dictator who decides to just toss enough servers into a bonfire that we lose a significant amount of information. Especially obscure dangerous information like where we buried plague bodies. Up north there's a problem people buried during the Spanish Flu Epidemic might still have Spanish Flu living in their corpse.

It's funny you mentioned the Romans, because there was the time Europe collectively forgot how to make concrete which the Romans invented.
