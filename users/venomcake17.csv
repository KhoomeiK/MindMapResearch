harrypotter,feqilwu,t3_eq5ctk,1579342288.0,Couldnt agree more!! She is one of the strongest female roles in the books and a inspiration! But in the films she is just the person who kisses harry and ties his shoe laces (in awkward silence) i find it outrageous!
teenagers,feqho9e,t3_eq7ywj,1579342057.0,"Wow.  This is one of the best stories of internet discrimination i have ever seen, i legit almost cried reading this."

AskReddit,fdi1u42,t3_elbejj,1578434231.0,"Boys will be boys. Its like ‚Äúoh wait, but they are male. Which means they are allowed to do anything. But ooooh no, screw females and everyone else who are for some reason different, they are being punished for the thing that the males aren‚Äôt. Makes total sense to me.‚Äù I dont get it personally"
lgbt,fddq9pv,t3_ekrmaw,1578321086.0,I never get why some people are like ‚Äúawww pride do all lgbt and you are valid being who you are!‚Äù And then being like ‚Äúbi people are in denial are are really gay but cant make their mind up.‚Äù Pick a option and stick to it (preferably the one that treats everyone the way they are.) some people like more than one gender. DEAL WITH IT!

AskReddit,fcz0tj2,t3_ejdlbw,1578091386.0,"When i said one of my longest friends now hangs out with the wrong crowd over text and told him that i am confused about my gender (he was the first person i told.) He then proceeded to out me for being trans (what i never mentioned pacifically). When i then confronted him for people asking me a bunch of questions about it, he then told me that his entire friend group had seen the entire text thread  and then they started a rumour about me. The kicker was when he told me why. He said ‚ÄúWhEl YoU PiSSed Me oFf and as you apparently can now control my life, i will control yours!‚Äù Pretty safe to say we are no longer friends. Btw i am now sure of my gender and happy of who i am as my identity goes now!"

Hungergames,fcamgio,t3_egm053,1577572159.0,"For as long as i can remember, i have hated the idea of guns in the hunger games. But this could be an pretty good way to have guns in there. My question is would the tributes know about the presence of them (like they could practice with them in training) or would it be out of the blue?"
lgbt,fcalnc5,t3_egt4u9,1577571684.0,Sorry to hear about your family. I just dont get how someone can immediately discard someone for being who they are. I dont get it. But at least your brother is a good person
