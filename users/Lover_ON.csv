elsword,ff9cd6v,t1_ff99h8c,1579709781.0,"RNG shouldn’t be such a strong feature in a game that it dictates how much money, time, and resources you spent. 
It would be ok if there was ring if you didn’t have all the right materials, but once you have all the materials, the enhancement chance is 100% and free.

Also, who would like to spend  real money on resources that are *CRUCIAL* to the whole game? We already gamble $200 on these ice burners (loot boxes really...) and overpriced accessories (How tf some earrings cost the same amount of money as something you can actually see?).
Imagine paying to enhance your Void wep and Elrianode gear just to replace it in the near future and then pay to enhance again. One could argue the enhancement events are 100% free; enhancement events are not on a schedule and they are not ensured.

I really wonder what they do with all this money, Elstar, that ugly ass El Lady anime? They can’t be using it on the game all the time seeing how many reused assets come into play."

The only way it could be bait is if somebody searched “binary” or “non-binary” and that was somehow the top result; unfunny memes, motivation, and artwork are usually popular and will show up in your feed.

But these people are sorta right. It’s more likely if the user was popular, but they don’t have a pfp like most of the popular folk on Tumblr (this argument can be countered if it was nsfw in the past). And everybody knows the people on Tumblr can be overtly sensitive and can forgive you for making up some bs (experience in that hellhole and a there’s a video that covers a prank proving this).

There’s really no way to know if the post was malicious without context, but I don’t feel like going back to Tumblr for two reasons..."
