worldnews,ff7n3br,t1_ff6i54b,1579653495.0,Finally a political slogan I can behind!
rickandmorty,ff6m7t8,t1_ff6btfi,1579630186.0,Yep.
aww,ff5w1wu,t3_errovb,1579612179.0,Aww? Really? That snake is big enough to crush the girl.
Huskers,ff5vwu3,t1_ff4o1jd,1579612048.0,And that's a problem that Adrian transfers? He's a junior and if he isn't good enough to retain the position then I would expect and encourage him to transfer so he can finish his college years playing.
rickandmorty,ff5urpc,t1_ff5ilie,1579610962.0,Because this is a repost at least 6 months old and hasn't been updated to reflect the fact that people would rather see Sarah Chalke play Beth.
Huskers,ff4uu30,t1_ff4dhxy,1579572975.0,It's possible in a toxic relationship that both parties are in fact toxic and contribute to said toxic relationship.
Huskers,ff4uorl,t1_ff4fwuu,1579572875.0,"Yes, absolutely. He should never come back to UNL."
Huskers,ff4un0d,t3_erl8ri,1579572842.0,I mean just look at how well his defenses did at Nebraska down the stretch and how dominant his defenses were at Youngstown State...wait a minute...oops.
KansasCityChiefs,ff4qojy,t1_ff3say3,1579570132.0,And literally no one is saying he would get them there. Alex Smith allowed the chiefs to fill the other position holes they had and not worry about a QB until they were ready to take the next step. Can you imagine the Chiefs worrying about the defense while playing Matt Cassel or someone like Case Keenum?
Huskers,ff1iqrj,t1_ff17733,1579479860.0,GO CHIEFS!!!!!
aww,ff0lj3r,t1_ff0g2qa,1579470004.0,"It's not dumb at all. There is, again, no biological need for a cat to go outdoors. If your cat wants to go outside so bad then it's the fault of the owner not providing enough mental stimulation. For the record I've owned multiple cats."
todayilearned,fezmsmf,t1_fezafpn,1579459110.0,"It will be around. It's political suicide to actually let it go broke but the real issue is how useful it will be for people under 40 going forward. The solution is to either increase taxes, political suicide, or to raise the age again, close to political suicide."
aww,fezdeo8,t1_feyzxmz,1579456190.0,I agree with everything you said. I have zero problems with cats in enclosed catios or on leashes. Just letting your cat run outside is irresponsible both on a disease/reproductive standpoint but also an environmental standpoint.
aww,feyz9in,t1_feyq7t7,1579452342.0,Sometimes it's just too early in the morning for Reddit.
aww,feyoe6x,t1_feykhye,1579448241.0,Hmm Seems like the obvious solution is to just keep your cat inside. There is no biological need to let your cat outside.
kansas,fey7ksf,t3_eqi7nc,1579441810.0,"I'm all for the state being properly funded but I think the better way to do it is actually legalize sports gambling, weed, and then collect sales tax on goods purchased online. All of those tax proposals have solid precedence and more popular support than something like this."
funny,fesybp1,t3_eqg792,1579370120.0,"You guys think Trump is crazy for this but let's be honest here, at some point space will be a real place for war. I mean at any point a race of alien spider/other insects can launch an asteroid at the Earth. We must be prepared, do you want to learn more?"
kansascity,fenkzfw,t1_fen2n8t,1579286926.0,"It sounds like you understand how people act in winter weather. Used to work in retail and during a snow storm we had people come in literally just because they didn't want to be cooped up all day. It's silly, but people really get stir crazy during storms."
freefolk,fdyrsoy,t1_fdyau6u,1578782895.0,I'm not saying the payoff was good. All I'm saying is that was ultimately the payoff we got.
freefolk,fdv1b4p,t3_emu0ax,1578741950.0,Doesn't this introduce the fact that Bran can influence the past which then plays into what happens with Hodor?
CFB,fdr1j4c,t1_fdqvbxz,1578678264.0,Are you talking the lawsuit? The whole issue he had was with sovereign immunity.
KCRoyals,fdllb1n,t1_fdk83eb,1578526593.0,Mike Sweeney was on the ballot at one point.
nfl,fdgkvf2,t1_fdfpg0d,1578400734.0,"No, he's an alcoholic. Flemlo Raps did a YouTube video on him and it's really sad but he's definitely an alcoholic and kept getting DUI's."
kansas,fdfapqi,t1_fdf9080,1578357263.0,"Not really, I said restaurants meaning all restaurants. Wendy's isn't on the downtown strip and of course McDonald's stays open late, they have a franchise obligation to do so. Point being none of the quick service restaurants (except McDonalds) on the downtown strip believe enough in the renaissance to stay open, that's a problem. Since the ""renaissance"" three quick service restaurants on the strip have actually closed."
Huskers,fdf8sgk,t1_fdf2d2g,1578355964.0,There was also an injury to their QB or rb if I remember right.
kansas,fdf8mdr,t1_fdf4ujr,1578355849.0,"Those are the new constructions. Meanwhile Subway, Jersey Mike's, and all the other quick serves don't stay open late. Once those restaurants open up late then you'll downtown is actually back."
kansas,fdf0f6k,t1_fder7gc,1578350500.0,He's worse than that he's a carpet bagger. He isn't a real Kansan.
kansascity,fdeuz9z,t1_fd6jj7k,1578347153.0,"No, people will just park in the bike lanes when convient. I've seen it happen in other cities that went all in on bike lanes."
kansascity,fdeu17v,t1_fdeakqs,1578346592.0,Jersey Mike's is better than subway.
kansascity,fderyff,t1_fdenfkx,1578345358.0,"Revenue growth does not equal profit growth. Revenue, while important, is a terrible way to try and determine a company's well-being."
kansas,fdenqu1,t1_fdelxer,1578342883.0,Actually she did. She's on the council that voted on the measure to initiate the sales tax extension measure and on the the council that can set levy rates on property taxes. She was gone when the actual voting occurred but the one person who wanted to raise the levy to it's highest amount was her deputy mayor. De La Isla has also advocated for higher property taxes on the past.
kansas,fdelv8v,t1_fdehggj,1578341775.0,I believe she told the city that they either needed to pass the sales tax extension or they (city council) would just run it through property taxes. That seems kinda forced on the town. Granted I agree with the sales tax item but still the citizenry were going to pay for it one way or another.
kansas,fdeknwf,t1_fdehesp,1578341055.0,"I can't dispute your's either but outside of women focused groups or diversity focused groups or actions for those two areas I haven't heard much, if any, public chatter about her."
kansas,fdek5pa,t1_fdednjm,1578340746.0,"Not sure why you got downvoted because you aren't wrong either. Downtown won't officially be ""back"" until retail shows up and restaurants stay open past 3:00 P.M. and neither has occurred."
kansas,fdecsi2,t1_fdeaixy,1578336204.0,Alright fair enough about the first two I figured that was more the city manager and the council. But I wouldn't give her much credit for downtown. Most of the momentum downtown is due to two or three businessman and there is very little outside of them.
kansas,fdea98h,t1_fde7p7f,1578334614.0,Extremely popular? Are you talking about the same Topeka I know? No one in the town cares about the mayor since they have almost no power. She may be extremely popular with some people but definitely not the whole town. I was downtown plenty and I never heard anyone say a word about her except maybe a few times in her tenure.
kansas,fde9zjm,t3_ekw8x3,1578334443.0,I wouldn't vote for her. She has done very little for the city. In Topeka the mayor position is just a glorified position and it's the council and mostly the city manager who actually run the city.
Accounting,fdau7mq,t1_fdatczj,1578250225.0,Did you try mentioning the matching principle and the actual theory behind depreciation?
todayilearned,fd9u7jr,t1_fd9tivd,1578238078.0,"No, their gross margin is 30% or $1.5 gross margin dollars."
todayilearned,fd9rzbn,t1_fd9pjxl,1578237282.0,"Gross is only revenue less cost of goods sold. It does not include labor, rent, or utilities etc."
todayilearned,fd9rtv0,t1_fd9b530,1578237205.0,That's at best just operating profit hence why I brought up the other crucial and large expenses any franchised restaurant will pay.
todayilearned,fd89h5x,t1_fd7r6s6,1578215464.0,"The net profit margin is okay but it doesn't include insurance, royalty/advertising, and then non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization. I'd imagine the net profit to be lower than reported."
todayilearned,fd5u2zu,t3_ek0slo,1578181520.0,"He did it so that the employees would turn around and buy the cars they made. Henry Ford did not do this out of altruism, in fact no business truly would, he did it to increase the market acceptance of his cars."
kansas,fcxnkqh,t1_fcwl8p6,1578067191.0,"Because it's a capital city. Topeka also has multinational companies in the city like: Schmuckers, Security Benefit, Home Depot distribution, Target Distribution, Mars, and now Walmart Distribution. Not even mentioning a well respected firm in it's industry called Advisor's Excel. There's also BNSF that has a major office in Topeka. 

The quickest answer is that it simply isn't a good luck for Kansas to have a dying capital city."

furniture,fcvf51e,t3_ej4lb5,1578000793.0,"Hancock and Moore are definitely worth it as is Bradington Young (a little cheaper). You could also look at Smith Brothers of Bern. The quality is very good (not HM) but its also typically 1/3rd of the price. Solid wood framing (frames are put together by Amish), top notch cushion cores, and individual seat springs for every seat."

furniture,fcopf6t,t3_ei6pc9,1577838072.0,Casegoods are kinda a dime a dozen to be honest especially in your price range. Ashley isn't bad stuff depending on the stuff you get. You might try Winner's Only. They're probably the closest to the best bang for your buck that you're after.
investing,fcnmpml,t1_fcn6ksn,1577814426.0,Your last part is fair but amendments are very difficult to pass for a good reason. If the wealth tax is unconstitutional (which I've heard as well) then it's incredibly unlikely that it will ever become a law.
investing,fcn42z8,t1_fcn22uu,1577802706.0,This just sounds so impractical.

StarWars,fcl9ael,t1_fckqhag,1577742595.0,I mean I haven't seen the movie so I don't know. All I know is what JJ Abrams has put out in interviews.
StarWars,fckm4fg,t1_fch8mzx,1577728312.0,You don't need a large force to conquer an enemy if you have a big enough weapon. The USSR likely didn't have the forces to conquer America and her allies but they sure had the nuclear weapons to conquer them.
StarWars,fckkviw,t1_fcke3ky,1577727543.0,JJ said her absence was due to post-production issues on the CGI Leia than him writing her out of the story. Apparently she was supposed to share screen-time with CGI Leia.
worldnews,fckhizz,t1_fck866f,1577725461.0,Yeah socialize the news. I think Indiana under Pence tried to do something like that at one point and it quickly turned into propaganda or at least appeared to be propaganda. The answer is not always socialism.
nfl,fckh4m4,t1_fck7ak1,1577725208.0,For Weeden and Manziel that's why I said right system and coaches. I think Dallas could have figured something out with Manziel or maybe even Harbaugh. He really just needed someone to kick his ass in gear and get him off the pedestal that A&M put him on. I think Weeden could have been used well by someone like Andy Reid or Pete Carroll.
nfl,fck60ig,t1_fcjzyrv,1577717578.0,Eh not really. Weeden and Manziel were promising if they were in the right systems with the right coaches. They clearly weren't and thus became busts. Kizer also could have been something but he came out of college too early.
freefolk,fck3x2y,t1_fciq73y,1577715851.0,I honestly think the Dany baby plot was in the original draft of the plot but because of the leaks and fan theories they rewrote it to subvert expectations.

AdviceAnimals,fcfi9p3,t1_fcclj3l,1577630257.0,"No, it absolutely should increase what you get. After 128k what's the point in paying into S.S. when your monthly benefit is capped at 2,833 or so (before inflation). At that point people will start paying way more than they ever expect to get back and the natural tendency is to try and avoid paying that tax. When you're rich you can easily avoid that tax through investment income and S-Corp flow-through income. However, if you incentivize it you'll likely get less legal/ethical tax avoidance. I.e. you increase the tax base and increase the available funds. 

Also, to even do what you want or what I want you have to convince businesses it's somehow in their best interest to pay an unlimited amount in for their half of FICA taxes. I can assure you that won't be easy."
AdviceAnimals,fcffiqe,t1_fcd5f7b,1577629461.0,"What do you mean why? It's natural to assume that if you pay in you should get something in return. That give and get relationship is the entire basis of our voluntary tax system and helps reinforce the civic duty aspect of paying taxes. Whten you remove the incentive of paying taxes you also remove the acceptance of paying taxes. 

To put it simply people don't pay taxes because it's the right thing to do. People pay taxes because they like roads, police, schools, a military to protect them from international threats, a partial retirement fund in Social Security, and other benefits."
furniture,fccfacq,t3_eh09iy,1577597730.0,It could be Southern Motion
AdviceAnimals,fcb2i5t,t1_fcb0hpj,1577581446.0,So are the benefits though so it's logical to cap the tax paid in. If you want to do in the S.S. tax cap then you'll likely have to undo the benefits cap.
furniture,fc2w1uu,t3_efsyaz,1577375560.0,"No lie, a sales man told me he actually saw kids doing flips onto the beds in the showroom once."
freefolk,fc2q3e0,t1_fc2eihg,1577370660.0,This is correct for the most part. I had always heard the reason that Dany's eyes weren't purple was due to contact issues.

todayilearned,fbw5d1x,t1_fbvadeu,1577141341.0,"Wanna be a sole accountant that performs audits? Have fun getting your C.P.A. license, get CPE, extensive peer-review requirements, among more. Want to be a tax accountant or a compilation accountant?  You literally need none of those things listed above. So now, it's much harder for accountants interested in auditing to go out on their own compared to tax or other services."
