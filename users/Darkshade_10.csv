Advice,ferih3v,t3_eqgbo1,1579354290.0,"I would say get out and start meeting people go to where other people are to find out how they dress, talk, etc. I good place would be a mall(shopping) a lot of people go to them on the weekend. Go inside the store and look at the clothes that’s what’s on trend(it’s what’s popular right now) that will tell you have to dress same with shoe stores. You can also look for apps to download that are event apps. These apps tell you what’s going on in the area around(it’s only major cities mostly) you can find sporting events, concerts, nightclubs whatever you wanted and go there. Once our put yourself out there people will want to know you if you act calm, chill, cool."
BDSMAdvice,fejtkuv,t1_fejti1t,1579185525.0,"I didn’t say they did, I said I’m more attracted to them."
BDSMAdvice,fejslp0,t1_fejmape,1579184836.0,"I’m generally more attracted to white guys that’s not to say I would not date another race. I never fetish anyone. I just know what I’m generally more attracted to. However, I would be open to dating any race as long as we click."

Shoestring,fef2u4a,t3_eotrh2,1579046862.0,I don’t where the best place is for the price
college,feegcnq,t3_eoq59v,1579033191.0,I would wait. Sometimes you don’t even need the textbook they tell you that you do. Sometimes it’s free open textbooks or other online resources they cost less.
college,feeg6d9,t3_eoqndl,1579033089.0,"Definitely not it can add more stress to you. I’m in college and don’t work it does get tight money wise, but I get better grades because I can focus on school.!"
college,fedp3hl,t3_envzzl,1579016820.0,I think you should try to take the classes online(if you can) just make sure you don't overwhelm yourself and you should be fine. Good luck.
college,fedomau,t3_eolyw6,1579016519.0,"I haven't withdrawn from a semester but I did have to sit out for two semesters one time. Personally, it was not fun because I was just sitting at home doing nothing, and when I was finally able to go back to school I couldn't wait. I will say having that time out made me really focus on what I wanted to do with my life and grow personally. I lived on campus at a school and after the break applied to a school I could commute to. If you think that it will be more beneficial you should do that(save money, time, etc.). I think you should consider maybe dropping a class(depending on how many you're taking) that could help with not being so overwhelmed too. I believe you should consider all your options before making a decision. Good luck."
college,fednujf,t3_eo5gcl,1579016026.0,"I think everyone feels like that. I personally loved my first year of college. Now three years later not so much. Now I'm ready to graduate and move on to my career. It is important to remember college is different for everyone and sometimes it can be really exhausting, but you have to remember the reason why you're there in the first place which is to graduate and start your career. I believe if you remember that you'll be fine and if you want to get with other students there are ways to find clubs and groups through postings in the buildings, online, and the student center. Good luck!"
college,fedn4n8,t3_eolpoa,1579015563.0,I believe most schools have a career services office. This is where they may have posting for different jobs(may or may not be related to major) but would give you a idea of where to start. In my opinion because I’m in college academic advisors don’t really help(they are supposed to). Also you can look at job websites such as indeed and zip recruiter to look for entry level jobs or internships and apply. Good luck.
BDSMAdvice,fe5d526,t1_fe5a935,1578867912.0,How do you find these guys. I know it sounds lame but is there so secret app(besides fetlife) I tried it I don’t like it.

BDSMpersonals,fdxuq3a,t3_enbkvh,1578773076.0,"I have reflected a lot and can say yes I’m worth a real true relationship. One with love, and caring, honesty, trust. The question is are you worth me giving you those things. It’s easy to say the submissive has to give those things been open, willing to please but when she does are you going to be willing to deal with everything you will see. Most men aren’t and that’s where the problem is they are only willing to deal with something until they think it is too much then they back away. I would be willing to give the right man everything if he was worthy of it."
