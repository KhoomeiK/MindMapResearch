depression_help,fcjalge,t3_eherua,1577681446.0,All I can say is maybe talk to someone you trust. Preferably someone who's gone through depression too and understands (or is understanding of) what you're going through.
teenagers,fcja6a8,t3_ehfncf,1577681123.0,Bruh the repost is so obvious.....

teenagers,fcj9ntz,t3_ehe6ig,1577680740.0,Lmao depressed people often act happy or upbeat but inside arent actually happy even if they're laughing really hard at something they genuinely find funny. (From personal experiences anyways)
KeepWriting,fcj9aer,t3_ehgnvt,1577680468.0,"I think its pretty good.

If you want critique:
Maybe take a word or two to describe how she felts. Like maybe how annoyed or angry she was at the tap, if she was tired drinking coffee."
depression,fcj06w4,t3_eh9smi,1577674023.0,Bro happy birthday. Hope you have/had a good one.

depression,fcizqpd,t3_ehdxmn,1577673714.0,"Bro SAME. Nighttime sucks for me, and especially trying to sleep. I made a post about this just the other day."
depression,fciz30p,t3_ehamwn,1577673278.0,Time don't heal nothing. You just get used to the pain. Or you don't.
depression,fciywkw,t3_ehbh7p,1577673152.0,"Bro doesn't matter how well off you are, you can still be depressed. I have good friends, enough money to go through uni without help, personal freedom bc I don't live with any of my parents, and decent grades. Doesn't change depression."
depression_help,fcfrq4e,t3_eh5c9o,1577633120.0,Yo I relate so much
depression_help,fcbe82z,t3_egzj7c,1577585782.0,"I feel you man, but theres nothing you can really do about it. However, she might just feel like you don't want her to ask, or that you dont need it. My friend didnt realize it until I told her either. But i dont suggest telling her unless yr comfortable with it."
depression,fcaxoeb,t3_egykyj,1577578661.0,I wish my friends cared about me enough to wanna help clean my room.
depression,fcawu6b,t3_egw4bd,1577578184.0,"Anxiety sucks man I'm sorry for you. But if they really thought you were annoying they probably would've tossed you aside long ago.
I can relate so much man. Like any little thing can set off alarms in my head. Then if turns out they were taking a shower, or eating, or something mundane. Try not to worry about it too much."
depression,fcavnq7,t3_egxnvc,1577577514.0,"I wish I could help, but I can't
 I don't know what I should do either. My dm is open if you wanna just chill and/or chat tho."
depression_help,fc7qc8t,t1_fc7ot4y,1577515944.0,"I feel you. All the anxieties and insecurities screaming inside your mind like a never ending torrent. Sometimes if gets better or disappears for a bot but when its bad its so bad, and it always comes back"
ForeverAlone,fc7ga3z,t3_egesy2,1577506543.0,"I've banged my head against the wall or my desk repeatedly. After the throbbing stops, my head feels clearer, and I curl into the fetal position and listen to music."
depression_help,fc7g1iz,t3_eglail,1577506332.0,"Felt this way for a long time, very on/off. It is a very weird feeling man. You hate life but you're scared to die. Sometimes you feel like you want something to come and just kill you as painlessly as possible, but dying also feels like it would suck sometimes."
