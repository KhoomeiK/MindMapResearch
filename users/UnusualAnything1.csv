Not saying anyone obliged to play ball with someone like that, but it‚Äôs always an option to just *ask* them why they‚Äôve been so distant, when you feel you once enjoyed a more close friendship.

I think someone not responding isn‚Äôt a sign that they hate/dislike you, it‚Äôs a sign that they aren‚Äôt responding. People overthink things and think they know best, and come to their own conclusions, but in reality, a good communicator and a good person would just, shit I don‚Äôt know, talk to their friend about and trust them enough to mean what they say. If you can‚Äôt even trust your friends intentions, then it‚Äôs time to end the relationship.

I‚Äôve got friends who I deeply revere and care for, that have grown bitter and torched the relationship entirely unnecessarily because I don‚Äôt text them enough or whatever. It made me feel like I have to pour more effort in to them and start strategizing about how to make them not feel insecure so that way I don‚Äôt lose them as a friend. Honestly, there are people who I don‚Äôt wanna hang out with on the weekly or even monthly but I still want them to be my friend.

But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs about the parents, it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs entirely your own personal thing. But it could serve as way to further the relationship in the same way did with his friends.

Yeah, you should be very concerned about this. If your bank is actually telling you, with a straight face, that they can‚Äôt release the secure deposit because you don‚Äôt have credit card history, even though the card balance you want released and all it‚Äôs history was through them... you‚Äôre either being defrauded by a financial institution or dealing with someone who has no idea how to do their job. You probably need to get in touch with someone who knows what they‚Äôre talking about. 

There is no reason your secured credit card should not be included in your credit reports. If it hasn‚Äôt been reported because of some sort of huge mistake, they need to retroactively report all of your history. If they don‚Äôt, you need to talk to a lawyer.

Also, you don‚Äôt need credit history to be given back the money you already gave them. This just strikes me as really fucked up, that is if everything you‚Äôre saying is accurate"

Dealers and suppliers are ‚Äúcutting‚Äù their products with harmful and fatal substances that are much cheaper than the actual drug, simply because those substances resemble the drug. So Fentanyl powder is to heroin and Xanax what Vitamin E Acetate oil is to THC oil. It looks similar, can make the user think they‚Äôre getting more bang for their buck, but ultimately, it might kill the user. 

There isn‚Äôt much evidence at all that nicotine/tobacco vapes are being tampered with in similar ways, so the recent push to increase the tobacco sale age and regulate nicotine vapes can be connected to the pre-existing health concerns with tobacco and nicotine."
