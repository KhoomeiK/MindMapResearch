todayilearned,fdfhn2p,t1_fdemks2,1578361908.0,If memory serves me right it was one of the laws of power of gaining trust from someone. The conman knew He couldn‚Äôt get $50 grand from Capone because he wouldn‚Äôt trust him so he asked Capone for the money for an investment idea that was ‚Äúgoing to flourish‚Äù but instead he stashed the money in a safe for 6 months and returned the full amount explaining to him that it had fallen through and they only broke even. That‚Äôs when Capone trusted him with $5 grand to get by as long as he promised to return it later. The man then moved across the country to start a new life.

iamverybadass,fcu7cku,t1_fcge0xs,1577974294.0,That is why you‚Äôre the better person. I‚Äôve seen that most people who were deployed rarely talk about it. My cousin snapped at family (close minded small town people) once bc they said that they thought he drank too much. His reply was I‚Äôve seen more shit in a day overseas that you‚Äôve seen your whole life here. After that it made sense why the real ones never talk about it.
