forhonor,fdy6kvr,t1_fdugk97,1578776595.0,"I mained Ara at one point and took him to high diamond in ranked duels. The key is to know which moves are trash, which moves are viable, and which moves can be tech options, as well as knowing his inherent strengths and weaknesses outside of his moveset. He doesn't really have a single one-dimensional move to rely on, contrary to many other characters.

His primary strength is his heavy damage and short gb window when performing them.

His primary weakness is his lack of openers, and a secondary weakness lies in his heavies' very very early feint window. Some heroes like LB you can basically try to heavy at parry time almost every time without getting punished if you have a quick feint input. If you do that with Ara, you're gonna be launching a lot of heavies you don't mean to, which can be good or bad depending on the opponent, it beats gb but loses to parry, opposite of using blockade which wins against parry but loses to gb.

As for moves, his zone is very important, it is just about the only way to pressure a response out of an opponent, and the only way to pressure OOS opponents for a punish. You'll be feinting the unblockable most -emphasis on most - of the time, but it's good damage for letting it rip that one in seven times or so.   
The other big move, which is arguably what makes him at all viable as a whole, is the Deadly Feint. The problem with Deadly Feint is that it requires very quick inputs, so most Aras will go for muscle memory, doing the same pattern every time, so in that way, he's very mentally taxing to play well, because you have to work against your instincts constantly. The best way to circumvent this is to play him more and learn just three or four different patterns for Deadly Feint.   
One of the good ones is: OPENER -> RIGHT Heavy -> LEFT Light -> RIGHT Heavy - LEFT Light -> Repeat until you let a heavy fly or want to switch up the pattern.   
Another decent one is: OPENER -> RIGHT Heavy -> LEFT Light -> LEFT Heavy -> RIGHT Light -> RIGHT Heavy -> LEFT Light -> Repeat or go to top at 3rd/4th light or let a heavy rip.

Of course here I'm mostly ignoring the counterplays your opponents might do, but at a low - medium skill level, they probably won't do too much outside of feeling overwhelmed, unless you become predictable by doing the same pattern over and over. Ideally you want to switch pattern JUST before the opponent tries to parry you, where you just have to go by gut instinct.

Outside of zone and Deadly Feint mix-ups, all his other moves are situational or not viable.   
Like his out of lock double heavy, just don't do it if you want to win.  
Forward dash side heavy is basically useless, it has no i-frames, no superior block, doesn't move your character, doesn't have interruptible, easy to parry. Don't do it unless you want to show off.  
Blockade is basically a no-go if you want to be optimal. It makes you vulnerable to a gb, it guarantees at most 30 damage if you blockade a heavy, then answer with top heavy punish. Blockade lights only gives kick or Ring the Bell for 10 damage, versus parry for 40 damage. The advantage is that it is omni-directional and fast, so it does have some fringe application, but it is very risky. Also the blockade punishes have slightly strange input timings, so sometimes, especially when starting, you'll miss their inputs and look like an idiot.  
The final move (yeah he literally only has like 3/4 moves + Deadly Feint and zone) Rushing Wind is his most situationally useful option, because it is the only move where hyperarmour matters. The primary use for Rushing Wind is initiating a combo against an opponent who is turtling and/or trying to trade hits with you, OR baiting out a response by mixing up your attacks, some opponents won't know that you can feint Rushing Wind and will try to parry it. If you can bait out an attack, you can quickly perform Rushing Wind to eat their attack to start your chain. Be aware that it's only 20 damage, so you will never win a trade war against any character, it is strictly for starting chains when you have the health to spare. Also consider following with a fast side heavy/light to interrupt whatever they might try to follow up their own attack with if they had hyperarmour. In XvX you can also use Rushing Wind to pursue.

If you made it down here, I hope you learned something, and by god, how did you manage to read through that wall of text."
