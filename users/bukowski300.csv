hockeyplayers,fdnx65z,t1_fdne36c,1578594654.0,"If it feels good to you then use it.  If you’re not really leaning hard on the stick when you shoot, you’re not getting the full use of the flex anyway. I don’t actually mean leaning but if you shooting “correctly” you utilize the flex by applauding force downward with your bottom hand. 

It’s good that you are thinking about this stuff. It can make the game more fun.

Also, you might be using your left hand too much or gripping the stick too tightly with your left hand. The right handed shot, as I understand it, involves the left hand pulling back to your body. But I’m no authority."
hockeyplayers,fdndbza,t3_emasnj,1578583368.0,"Some places may have an area where you can try a stick for a bit.

Pay attention to what other players use and what their shots look like. It’s how my son chose the stick he’s been using the last two years in juniors. He’s on his fifth one. The pain is real watching some mutant slash through his stick. Ugh. 

In choosing sticks for myself and my son(who is way way better than I am), we always were concerned with lie, flex (65 sounds low to me, unless you cut the stick, so I’m not surprised if one feels whippy) and pattern. As for pattern, I think a basic simple pattern works for most players. Aside from shooting, you should be able to reliably pass and catch passes (forehand and backhand) and a basic non-sexy pattern serves those needs. You may not be picking corners but too much of a shooting curve on a low flex stick and you’ll be shooting all over the place. 

As much as we beer league guys can live for years off one sweet bar down shot, being a competent player is really cool."
hockeyplayers,fdmclc3,t3_em32fe,1578545622.0,"Play if you have the passion. Playing juniors has done more for my son’s confidence and maturity than going to college at 18 did. And he’s had experiences that he will hold onto forever. I’m fifty. If I had graduated from college at 21 or 22, it doesn’t make a difference now. Don’t be in a huge rush. Live life. Of course, if there is a sound financial reason that you really shouldn’t or you’re giving up a specific educational opportunity then you need to consider it. But follow your passion. If it’s one the ice, go play."

To the duster who challenged one of my son’s junior team’s top scorers to a fight in the second period of a 2-2 game, “close game, I’ll fight you in the third ... if you get a shift.”  3-2 win, duster never got a shift in the third. 

To the 4th liner talking shit to the opposing junior

As much as your stick handling and shooting, work on skating. Get in a gym and build your legs. Get faster. Skating ability and speed are super important, even if you’re really big. 

Good luck and keep us posted. 

Last thing, I’d suggest trying to catch some of the games in person or on YouTube to get a feel for the style of play."

hockeyplayers,fcju97o,t3_ehket3,1577705015.0,"In a rec league the possibility of hurting someone with a slap shot is much higher. People are not playing rec league to take unnecessary chances. 

Depending on age and skill level, most of the time, you’d never have time to take a slap shot anyway.

If you have enough time to take a slap shot in rec league, you can skate in a few few and shoot from closer. If you can’t skate well enough to do that and recover if the shot is blocked, then don’t. But remember that because everyone is a bit slower in Rex league, you don’t get to spray slap shots all over that hit guys in front and can hurt them or inexperienced goaltenders."
