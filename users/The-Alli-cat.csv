I'm simply going to choose 2 lip products and wear them twice each, with the other 3 days to be dedicated to my #20in2020 project lip products. Then l'll pop into the week 4 thread and start reviewing :)"

ProjectPan,fc1tjv7,t1_fbwpsxr,1577329266.0,"I kinda love their lip scrubs. This is my second after Santa Baby and l vastly prefer this one. Itâ€™s the perfect consistency, it does the job and the peppermint oil gives my lips a slight plumping effect.

Plus l can reuse the glass jars as travel jars."
EDAnonymous,fbz4s7e,t1_fbz43y1,1577235063.0,"Iâ€™ve actually had food poisoning since Friday, so thankfully still feeling ill is so far a good excuse for not eating too much. Mum joked about me being a pro about puking last night with regards to the food poisoning. If only she knew!

Gotta ask, what does turkey taste like? Itâ€™s not really a thing here in Australia."
