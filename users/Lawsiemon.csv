Which seems criminal given that he therefore earns the most of anyone staff member, and possibly 5-10 times what most of the average staff member gets. But I think most of us are more angry that that salary comes out of the $ that could be going into healthcare.
It's like parliament, it should be paid at the rate of average NZ wage, then the people doing it would do it for the right reasons"
newzealand,fetaj7u,t1_fep09i1,1579373349.0,"You're right about specialists getting to work privately and publically. Which is ironic given that at least allied health  contracts saying that any form of secondary employment won't affect our dhb work. But consultants are still paid and treated like gods compared to the rest of us. 
I think the health system might break if we tried to bring ACC back into it - they're so separate and have all their own systems and in my department at least we couldn't absorb that back in.  And you can guarantee that even if their funding came with it, it wouldn't come to our dept cause we're not a sexy dept like some others. 
Maybe charge a health levy the way we do and ACC levy and get health to have as much $ as acc does?"

newzealand,fet7qqx,t1_fepctk6,1579372502.0,I agree totally with points number 1 and 2 ... But I'm not sure I would ever want to put the health system in the hands of the public to decide it's fate! It's too complex a system and the public simply do not understand how it works (go to the comments section on fb of any article written about health!). We elect our governments to make these decisions on our behalf- just wish they'd step up and fund health properly! And every dollar they spend on sport or flags or anything else means that health won't get it.

newzealand,feomai0,t1_feojrhw,1579302052.0,"Honestly... I don't think any of that matters as much as the dhbs getting more money in the first place. We're all on the bones of our asses and if you've got nothing to work with, how are changes in boards going to help? And it's such a tricky balance when you've got to choose between patient welfare, and the endless deficit that the govt tells each dhb to sort out. As if we somehow misspent the money and that's why there is debt. Healthcare is expensive. Good healthcare is more expensive. But when it's not funded properly, eventually we all suffer. Even private healthcare insurance can only get you so far"
newzealand,feogj1o,t3_eq45kv,1579299858.0,"I work in health and honestly it's so hard. There is never any money for ANYTHING. Not for staffing, building, service provision, colour printing, anything. And that has been the case for the 15 years I've worked in health. With Labour coming into power the staff at least got the pay rises we hadn't had for the last 9 years or so, but that was pretty much all the health $$ used up. All of us are having to think of how to save money and resources  all the time, instead of just doing our jobs. Staff having to fight for patients to get the treatments and services they need, because there is never enough. It's so stressful and it never ever ends. Honestly i can only dream of a health system that is actually funded properly. I don't know how to fix it but like some other commenter I'd support legalizing weed just because of the tax dollars that would provide. It isn't just because of one thing, it's not as simple as it being just refugees, it's decades worth of not adequately funding our health system finally catching up."
