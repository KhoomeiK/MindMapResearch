feedthebeast,ffaibx4,t1_ffai8za,1579736414.0,I mean I can send u ss of my list but it's 219 strong so I figured no one would want to.
feedthebeast,ffagwy1,t1_ffa5uy8,1579735474.0,Is this a new addition then? Because temps were never displayed before.

feedthebeast,ffa3u37,t3_es8z12,1579727342.0,Install better foliage and dynamic trees for extra realism

facepalm,fekj46h,t1_feki8hr,1579201114.0,"The thing is, there couldn't be enough coders right now. We're moving into a future where everything will be automated. Most jobs will require coding."
facepalm,fekhymd,t1_fekh0bz,1579200424.0,Yeah but that wasn't the point she was making. She said that her brother in law went to college to become a teacher and suddenly it didn't pay a lot.  Teaching doesn't make a lot in the short term so you'll be stuck with debt for a while. Which could've been prevented had he not chosen to become a teacher. Don't go into a profession that doesn't pay well and complain about the school system.
facepalm,fekgp4y,t1_fekgb36,1579199676.0,"I'm sorry, but when was teaching ever in high demand and high paying?"
facepalm,fekf87v,t1_fekeus8,1579198797.0,Is he wrong though? If more people studied for jobs that are in high demand they wouldn't struggle with such high amounts of debt. Don't take art and expect to pay off your loans easily.

AskReddit,fdrpmg7,t1_fdr2n92,1578687790.0,"Phone died so sorry for the delayed response. I mesnt to add onto that remark i made but i had to wait 8min and then it died. But what i meant was that with today's technology we should be able to expect much more from nintendo, like what we saw with botw for example. I just don't see nintendo pushing themselves in order to produce inovative titles anymore like we saw from OOT or Super Mario 64. That's what i meant by primitive, that's just my opinion though."
