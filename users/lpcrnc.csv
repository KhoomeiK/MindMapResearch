unpopularopinion,fcag5oo,t1_fcaeupv,1577568655.0,There we go. We've gotten to a point where I actually agree with everything you're saying.
unpopularopinion,fcacefc,t1_fcaaoie,1577566693.0,"First, how many calories do you intake everyday? I've never heard any health experts say that eating one meal a day is healthy for you and there's a certain amount of calories people need to eat everyday. People that workout regularly often have to eat more because of the amount of energy theyre burning. Also, Korean people have smaller portions that most of the world because their ideal is stick skinny, it doesn't make it healthy, it's just ingrained their society.



Second, the not everyone is involved in the HAES movement. There are variations and the only ones I've seen is women being confident in their bodies, not denying that they're unhealthy.




Third, the source you gave me tells me how being overweight is risky but doesn't tell me how my statement is wrong. I never said overweight people arent unhealthy and I even say they are vulnerable to diseases in my post but it doesn't lessen my statement that unhealthy skinny people aren't at risk either.




And fourth, just because no eating makes you lose weight doesn't mean not eating isn't healthy for you. Not every fat person eats unhealthy and not every skinny person eats one meal a day (I've actually heard some eat 5-6 meals a day) so just because something worked for you doesn't mean it works for everyone else in a healthy way."
unpopularopinion,fca8y0z,t1_fca7eek,1577564898.0,"First off, the fat movement isn't about fat being healthy, it's about fat being beautiful.



Second, even if the body movement is towards women, we should criticize *all* overweight people, not just women.



Third, generally it's not true because lots of skinny people, especially in their teens, eat a bunch of junk food which gives them almost the same risks as someone overweight in general.



And fourth, you're oversimplifying how to lose weight. Not everyone loses weight the same way and not everyone is fat due to overeating. Idk who you are but if you were naturally skinny, I dont think you have to right to tell people to ""stop eating"" because that's not how losing weight works all the time."
