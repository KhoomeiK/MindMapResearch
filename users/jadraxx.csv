No matter where the fuck I was I was able to go to a bar afterwards grab a pint and just strike up a conversation with any ol' local. I'm an American so I would usually just bullshit about hockey with them til curling went on afterwards. Fucking love watching curling for some reason. I didn't know how much I enjoyed it til I took the time to watch it and had someone explain the sport to me. Now that I have a different job I don't travel to Canada anymore for work, but I have been back to visit Calgary to watch the Flames play... and lose twice lol. I can't wait to get up to Calgary again I had a fantastic time. I absolutely love it up in Canada and will take ANY excuse to go back up there for a visit."

This is like the 3rd or 4th case where cops have been arrested and made the news. Is there something going on in TX where they are cracking down on cops or am I just not seeing articles from other states? It seems like TX is taking a stand on police killings of some sort because I'm not noticing these type of articles from other states.

To teach myself a lesson I forced myself to choke down the entire batch. Took about 2 weeks of misery. No amount of sour cream or anything you added to it less than making 2 more batches of broccoli and cheddar and mixing it all would of fixed it. Never going to do that one again.
