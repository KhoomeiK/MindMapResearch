Most of the bosses are average at best with most of the series’s worst bosses being in there. Life gems are incredible broken and make the game feel way too easy, but then then every area is packed with some cheesy, ambushy bullshit that makes the game hard but not fair. Bad mechanics plus bad level design doesn’t balance it out, it’s just double bad. Most areas just felt like shitty rehashes of areas from DS1. Honestly there’s a reason what you said is heresy, there’s a LOT about DS3 that’s better than DS2

TheRightCantMeme,fegwvsb,t1_fefk4ah,1579104338.0,"A contract that you likely not only signed immediately after high school when you’re young, have little understanding of money and are constantly being pressured to go into college by peers, family, the school system itself and all of society, but one that you likely have to sign if you want to get a higher education at all because tuition is so ridiculously over inflated.

Frankly the fact that we have to pay for education at all is ridiculous. If we have free education up until we graduate high school (in fact not only free but required), why shouldn’t we be allowed to continue learning and choosing a career without drowning in debt and/or blowing all of our life savings on it? The ability to become educated and pursue one’s life goals should be a right available to everyone. If the government is able to pay for the core education system up through high school, there’s no reason they can’t extend that courtesy up through college.

Of course, that would mean we would have to take money out of our ridiculously excessive military budget and we all know the right would never allow us to prioritize education over a big military dick so we’ll probably never get free higher education.

Comics like this were made by boomers who grew up in a time where tuition was actually reasonably affordable without loans to the vast majority of people, and if someone did need to take out a loan they wouldn’t be fucked by debt their entire life. That was a time when it was reasonable to say “you took out a loan, so pay it back”. But the system has been completely broken to the point where that’s just not possible for most college grads unless they picked a particularly profitable career."

u_Fathom_Events,fdzr3sz,t1_faviymc,1578793871.0,"I didn’t know forceful, aggressive religious practice designed to suppress his interests was better for his sexual development than just watching anime. Maybe you could, I don’t know, guide him yourself as an older and more experienced brother, maybe help him in a way that doesn’t completely suppress his interests and desires while also allowing him to grow sexually in a healthy way without being reliant on anime?

You should be ashamed of yourself. You and your father probably ruined his entire childhood and teenage years. Having religion so forcefully pushed on him by his family will result in one of two things:
A) he’ll give in, become a religious extremist just like the rest of your family, and he’ll learn to constantly judge others who aren’t as religious as him. He’ll completely avoid girls in general who aren’t Christian and consequently his over-the-top religiousness will be a massive turn-off to girls in general. By the time he’s 19 he’ll be as isolated and awkward as you are now... except his isolation will be at the hands of something horrible and archaic like the Bible instead of at least being something fun like anime.

OR

B) he’ll grow to completely resent his father and his religion. He’ll become rebellious, he’ll start doing drugs, he’ll start having lots of promiscuous sex and he won’t learn how romantic feelings in an actual relationship works at all throughout his teen years.

Either way is a horribly unhealthy way for anybody to grow and develop sexually. He’s going to be damaged for a VERY long way into his adulthood by this, and it may affect him for his entire life. Chances of him growing and developing in a healthy manor at this point despite this religious bullshit are slim to none.

Frankly, being a guro addict probably would’ve been better for him. At least he would’ve been able to explore sexually and not feel ashamed for doing so. It’s not ideal but it’s certainly better than all-out religious repression."

TheRightCantMeme,fcvl1xn,t1_fcvf9rr,1578004383.0,"I’d 100% agree with your last point. There have been very great people who’ve done amazing things, who’ve made positive changes in the world, who were also Christians. But in all honesty it seems like people like that tend to cherrypick the parts of the Bible they agree with most. I feel like if someone were to interpret it literally (which again, most Christians do), and follow every single message and moral they got from the Bible while interpreting it literally, I don’t think it’d be possible to be a good, positive force in the world.

If all Christians interpreted it the same way you did that wouldn’t quite be the case but honestly you’re the first person I ever heard present that kind of interpretation, and I was a church-going Christian for quite a long time before I turned atheist. So again, I feel like either Christianity should just be forgotten (not from history; more like the country should become more secular and atheist over time), or the leaders of the religion should be convinced to reinterpret and change their core values and beliefs that they derive from the Bible. And to be honest, the former seems much more realistic to me, as the vast majority of religious leaders are far too stubborn about their values to re-examine what they believe in and become progressive, and atheism is already on the rise.

These are all just my personal thoughts of course and I understand that you probably disagree with them. which is totally fine by me, as you’re not a bigot and you don’t deny science with your religion."

TheRightCantMeme,fcvcd9g,t1_fcv8ckr,1577999141.0,"While I’m still not religious as I have my own problems with the very concept of an omnipotent deity in the first place, whether it’s benevolent or cruel, I totally respect your interpretation of the Bible and it’s an interesting way to look at things for sure. You’re clearly an intelligent and educated person, and the fact that you’re able to be Christian without being hateful and without having to deny science highly supported by sound evidence (like evolution), is wonderful.

However, it still bothers me that the route they went with to represent repenting from sin is the murder of otherwise innocent people. Even if it isn’t meant to be taken literally, the god that we see represented in the Old Testament doesn’t seem to be very compassionate or understanding. I don’t get why they couldn’t use some other metaphor for repenting of sin, especially when one of the Commandments that were supposed to govern the lives of the Israelites was simply not to kill. Even if it is meant to be taken metaphorically, as a piece of literature it still seems pretty self-contradictory and thematically confused to me.

Also, whether or not it’s meant to be taken literally... the Bible still says horrible things that most Christian people simply don’t interpret as metaphors. And this is a problem to me; I oppose the religion of Christianity because one way or another it does twist people’s’ moral codes in terrible directions. Again, to reiterate, even if you’re totally correct about how the Bible is meant to be read, *most Christians haven’t studied theology and don’t understand that*. They think when the Bible outright says “kill homosexuals because they’re sinners” and “kill the non-believers, those not chosen by God” and “women are below men, and must sit down and be quiet”, they see no reason that they should take that in any way BUT literally. The Bible still makes good people to bad things, it still causes hatred and bigotry, and it’s still something that I believe was written by people in largely patriarchal, homophobic, “traditional” societies thousands of years ago and I believe on some level, it still is meant to be taken literally.

But anyway, all that being said, I appreciate this conversation, I do feel more educated on the subject than I was before. It makes me dislike the Bible a little less, even if not by much lol. So thanks for the lesson :)"
TheRightCantMeme,fcv7oci,t1_fcv5cf3,1577996357.0,"Is that why God ordered Moses and the Israelites to seek out and kill neighboring villages that weren’t of “his people”?

Actions speak louder than words. In literature we say “show, don’t tell”. In the Bible, God’s actions show a cruel, wrathful, envious deity who breaks all the rules that he expects humans to follow. But then the Bible just says “God is love” and people believe it. The entire book is a self-contradiction.

I can appreciate that you’re a leftist Christian, I can appreciate that you don’t let the things your holy book says influence how you treat others and how you look at the world. But I truly urge you to really take a good long look at the Bible and the God presented in it, the things that god has said and done, and question if it’s really the kind of being you want to believe in and worship.
