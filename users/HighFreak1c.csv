""I'll trust someone more if they own their mistakes because I know they wont make the same mistake twice.  But someone who lies about it will lose my trust forever""

Well summed up, I couldn't have said it better myself.

In addition to that, I used to (technically) lead a team of several network engineers -- the best ones were those who:

1. Had Googled and checked KBs before asking something.
2. Had a clear and succinct explanation of the issue and what they'd tried thus far.
3. Expanding on the answer given themselves, where needed.
4. Never asked the same question twice.

The best part about that type of role is giving someone the breadcrumbs they need to help themselves versus giving them the answer outright."
fortinet,fei5xob,t1_fei1juo,1579131000.0,"I would say it's situationally dependent. The biggest benefits for us in this scenario was the lack of downtime. Initially I'd suggested we do it the good old fashioned way, but because it's a pretty critical environment we were having a hard time getting approvals to need the full hour or so to reboot over and over again. Not doing it in the lab first would have also been risky as we'd need to pause to resolve any configuration errors and we had no idea to what extent those would impact us.

Granted we didn't do full testing in the lab (e.g. pushing simulation traffic through the device) it was enough to give us a good idea of what needed to change. We were worried about things like IPSec VPN PSKs and OSPF/BGP passwords -- turns out only the latter were impacted.

The other challenge with this situation was that it's actually a geographically separate cluster spanned between data centres using a L2 link. Myself and another engineer had to physically attend both sites. The master was restored using the config, then the secondary was factory reset - configured with the bare minimum HA config and allowed to sync with the master. There were also underlying, managed FortiSwitches that needed to move from v3.4.0 to v6.0.6 which I thought may be difficult, but we just upgraded them after the firewalls and all turned out okay.

Honestly, I quite like this approach and will be using it in future assuming we have an identical unit we can use to do it on the bench before touching production. I will say, from what I've seen it's quite rare to have core firewalls that far behind in FortiOS versions."

There are lots of nice to haves on v6.2, especially if you have IoC licensing on FAZ but I wouldn't trust FortiOS v6.2 on firewalls yet in a strict production environment. That is to say unless you have a definitive business requirement for a feature that doesn't exist otherwise."

I guess that's good for a greenfield build, but for the majority of our projects we are replacing and not building fresh. We (and the clients we implement on behalf of) have felt the burn on this on multiple occasions.

The fact seems to be almost all INET links I see in the field come with a /30 linknet range (which the customer commonly uses extensively for inbound NAT and almost exclusively for outbound PAT) with any additional public IPv4 subnets ranges routed toward the CPE end of the tail by the ISP. I needn't explain to you as I'm sure you know, but for anyone else reading it makes any ability to change away from this whilst retaining existing addressing difficult. Suddenly you also need extensive involvement and changes from the ISP during a cutover window (interface addressing and routing changes) instead of literally just a cable swap to a pre-configured device that runs ""proper"" high-availability.

Preaching to the choir though as I know you and I tend to agree on these types of points. It's not the first time we've commented on the same posts saying similar things😅"

Another option is to use a bridging device to stand up the PPPoE circuit. In saying that however, I've had trouble finding devices that allowed for the requisite type of bridging that means you can end up having the public IPs on the WAN interface of the FortiGate. Your mileage may vary on this as it will depend on what brands are available to you locally and what physical media types you're needing to interface with from your LAN/WAN sides.

Failing that, your final option would be to just size the device so the CPU can take the load. This might be feasible if the PPPoE circuit is low-bandwidth, or a backup component of a larger solution but generally speaking I wouldn't recommend it otherwise as it makes scalability a challenge."

I don't have a FEX handy, but you should be able to manage it via the FortiGate itself or alternatively if you have a couple of sites and want to centralise management/visbility FEX-Cloud would be a good option. If you want to get to it directly, I think you can assign it an IP, create a firewall policy and manage it the same way you would a FortiSwitch."

technology,fdnuj8d,t1_fdnkgem,1578593115.0,"I know, but for the 99% not using a turnkey cloud solution is far too hard.

My point was all they need is an option to not allow their own support staff access to view your account unless you enable it. I'm sure someone would have god-mode access and be able to work around it, but Meraki are an example of this where their support team can't directly see your config unless enabled.

I'm well aware the data is probably stored somewhere within reach of the private key, assuming of course they even bother to encrypt it at-rest."

* Create a reachable IP on the FSW
* On your FortiGate switch-controller config
   * Enable SNMP itself
   * Enable SNMP access on the mgmt interface
   * Create your SNMP communities or users (if v3)
* Ensure you have a firewall policy permitting traffic from your NMS to the SVI/mgmt interface."

What you're saying is still accurate however, a firewall policy will need to exist to support the traffic."
fortinet,fdhnps2,t3_eld16n,1578426515.0,"Generally we don't use ""disk"" based units unless it's for a small customer who only has a single location. Limited bandwidth or trust issues can make log replication to the cloud impossible.

Another issues is that free FortiCloud only has 7-days worth of retention, there's a good chance the disk on the FGT will retain longer. You also can't customise reporting.

&#x200B;

It might be worth looking in to FortiAnalzyer-Cloud. Not sure how well it's priced but I'm suspecting it might be a happy medium between the cost of a dedicated/on-prem FAZ (VM or PHY) and FortiCloud."
