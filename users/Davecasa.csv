timberframe,ff24gca,t3_er5744,1579493539.0,"If you want to go larger and still avoid permitting, many jurisdictions have no size restriction for structures built on skids rather than a foundation. The lack of foundation subjects the building to additional loads, but small timber frame structures tend to be so over built that I doubt you'd have trouble making it strong enough."

teslamotors,fewat71,t3_eqp28q,1579407686.0,"You have expensive gas and cheap electricity! Correcting for the efficiency you missed, at my rates right now in Rhode Island ($0.2184/kWh electricity and $2.56 gas) that's...

Tesla: 10,000 miles x .278 kWh/mile / .75 charging efficiency x $0.2184 / kWh = $809

Honda Accord: 10,000 miles / 44 mpg x $2.55 / gallon = $580


**Edit**: I found [this website](https://www.chooseenergy.com/electricity-rates-by-state/) which seems to have realistic electricity costs, giving a national average of $0.1284 kWh. I assume this is weighted by population or something reasonable. The national average gas price is $2.554 / gallon according to AAA. Using the averages:

Tesla: 10,000 miles x .278 kWh/mile / .75 charging efficiency x $0.1284 / kWh = $476

Honda Accord: 10,000 miles / 44 mpg x $2.554 / gallon = $580

Buy a Tesla because it's cool or because you want an electric car. But not because it will save you money, because it certainly will not."
WTF,fenwd4j,t1_fenv9tf,1579291822.0,"8500 feet is not depressurized. These pilots know a lot more about their plane than you do. They followed proper procedures and landed safely. Airplanes can land without flaps too, but they'd *rather not*."

spacex,fdzt97x,t1_fdyflvx,1578795270.0,"They are different because the drag coefficient is not constant, and varies with speed and atmospheric pressure. Calling it a coefficient at all is probably misleading. You're correct that the two are closely related - all else being equal, when aerodynamic pressure increases, so does drag."

RhodeIsland,fdgnw0y,t3_elbexw,1578403516.0,"Seems like the same line of thinking that nearly built a giant Pawsox stadium. People go to local minor league sports because it's cheap, casual, there's not a huge crowd or much traffic, etc. If you want more than that, we have 4 very successful pro teams right over the border. Making minor leagues more expensive will not attract any more people."
tech,fdgmtuf,t1_fddupvt,1578402580.0,"If physics says it's possible but the technology isn't there yet, yes, you gotta start somewhere. If the physics isn't on your side, you probably shouldn't start.

In this case, airliners are about 50% fuel by weight on takeoff, which they burn throughout the flight. Fuel is 40x more energy dense than batteries. An equivalent electric airplane would therefore be 2000% fuel by weight, and have to drop those batteries along the route as they were used up.

So yes, you can do it for a 15 minute flight, and by improving technology probably get it up to 30 minutes. But unless we come up with a completely different way to store energy, starting somewhere will not get you there.

Now if we want to get into fuels that can be produced sustainably - maybe alcohol, methane, or hydrogen - I'm on board."

RhodeIsland,fd9g1si,t3_ekcynx,1578232878.0,"Is this URI? My understanding is if you start as an out of state student, moving to RI can't change that status. You can become an in state student by buying a house, starting a business, marrying a resident, etc. If you're from a nearby state which has a tuition exchange program, one option might be to pursue a major not offered at your local state university. In general, I'd call the bursar's office and start asking what they can do. 

And to anyone else considering moving to RI and going to our state university, it may be a better idea to move *first*."

RhodeIsland,fcqpzz7,t3_eiey06,1577890332.0,"Rhode Island is small enough that there's not really a good reason to be close to things unless you're actually *at* the thing - so if you're on the beach fine, but don't worry about the difference between a 10 minute drive and 20. I'd therefore shoot for somewhere like Exeter. Not too far from the beaches, or from Newport, or Galilee, or Providence, or the airport, but still a bit into the woods where you can probably rent a big house for much cheaper.

This is coming from someone who lives in the woods because I don't like being around all those people, so take with an appropriate amount of salt."
