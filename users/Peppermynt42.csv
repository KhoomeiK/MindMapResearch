DnD,fdzqc6t,t3_engu1w,1578793349.0,"Not D&D but pathfinder. Our level 5-6 group was being harassed by a level 16 rogue who was ordered not to kill us but make us rethink our current alliance with the revolutionaries in the city. He kept tossing poision daggers at the second person in line whenever we travelled, which just happened to be the witch. Finally after about the third or fourth time of getting a poisoned dagger in the shoulder or gut the witch got sight of him and cast sleep. DM rolled a nat one for his save and he was out.

Now, due to how hard he was hitting the witch knew that if we attacked him he would probably survive and end up kicking the crap out of us. However, feeding him a poison to sap his CON might do the trick. Tried a few poisons, but didn't seem to have the desired effect. 

So, in a fit of frustestion, the witch just looked at the DM and said ""Fine, I take the bottle of sovereign glue and pour it on his mouth and nose....and then I wake him up....""

Your take on it being time to make silly voices and be a half-baked story telling in real time isn't that far off. But it can differ from DM to DM. Some are more mechanically driven, some are very story driven and will allow certain things to happen because ""rule of cool""

Take some time to talk to your DM and ask them what their goal for the ""story"" is. Explain what your character's backstory is, what their goals are, what their dreams and fears are. The more robust your level of detail for your character, the more immersed you can be with your story.

Also, take time and read up as much of the rules as possible, there is a lot and it can get daunting, but they all serve a purpose. Then take time again and talk to your DM about ""rules as written""  vs ""rules as intended"". 

Basically, don't be afraid to just talk to your DM abour your concerns and see if they can help you in the direction you want to go.

While you're levelling play the spec that appeals to you and get to max level with a combination of questing and dungeons.

Since the anniversary event is still going, as soon as you can queue for Korriks revenge pvp. It might be boring for you but it's the best way to level period.

Once you're max level then worry about spec loadouts and rotations."
