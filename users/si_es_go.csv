I guess he was drunk because he was found dead in his car wrapped around a tree I think. We were supposed to go visit in less than 2 weeks. I had no clue what to do, I just stood there emotionless. We’re in Louisiana right now, it’s been a few years. About to go visit them soon. I remember when we came after the accident. There was nothing we could do. But time heals, everyone was devastated and now we’re okay. I never got to know him really, he was a bit older and we moved to CA when I was young. So cherish the moments you had with your cousin. Remember the good times. Give it time."
