Water is always holy provided it isn't contaminated with something else, and even that something else may be deemed good or bad depending on cilture. In fact the hydrogen bonding of water is what keeps your soul focused in your body and tethers the mechanics of the mind. 

Being of water and of fire we exist in duality. Water accepts whatever you add to it, and fire consumes whatever is offered to it. To purify and make the water sacred is quite simple. Sincere prayer and focus, with reasonably clean water; if you can drink it safely it is good enough. 

Hold the water in a bottle with your right hand and say aloud: Light of Wisdom, Eternal Flame, bless this water in your Name.  If you do it right, with sincere intent, it will get warm and might even glow briefly. It does not banish evil already present, only prayer does this, but it will repel evil, reveal truth, and expidite healing. Just have faith and good intentions."
