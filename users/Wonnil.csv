Iran, America, Turkey, and other countries are all equally disliked by most Syrians. About Soleimani I'm not sure as I haven't been in Syria since a year ago but the people do blame America for instigating it.

Yes, there is a draft in Syria. One of my uncles joined while another had immigrated to the Netherlands in 2015 because of it.

Yes! Hummus is amazing. I bring it regularly from the Emirates to Portugal because I can't find it here. We love hummus. All Arabs do! We also love our Shawarma, and our Salads like tabouleh.

Arabic coffee is extremely prevalent along with Turkish coffee, I can't tell myself as I don't drink coffee..

Oh boy the Israelis and Palestinians. Most arabs hate the israelis as they're seen as stealing the lands of the Palestinians, and most importantly taking the Quds Mosque which is very important in our religion. The people who hate the Israelis the most are: the Palestinians who still live in their lands because Israel has completely affected the lives of those living.

The Palestinians who also left Palestine are also continuously affected today. Most went to Jordan where today they're Jordanian and have a good country. Some went to Syria and Lebanon though, where, specifically in Syria, we were not given citizenship but rather a kind of... Travel document? That's what I currently have. Most countries don't even recognize it so I can't enter a majority of the countries in the world. I came to Europe in 2019 with a like, a paper visa for Schengen. We're literally stateless according to many countries.

For the religion in Syria, yes most people are very religious. Majority being Muslims, and some in the more eastern and northern areas being more Christian. The hijab is a guarantee all around the Arab world but some Muslims don't use it, but still pray and believe in God.

If 2020 election you mean in the US then I've always been leaning to Bernie Sanders. I've always seen him as a good figure and someone who's fair and takes care of the common people! But it's not my thing to decide as the US is the US and is not my country.

Me specifically? No not really, I've lived most of my life in the UAE so there's that, but Damascus in some areas have been pretty safe as they've been pretty much under government control so there's that...

Syrians hate the west, and more specifically America. They saw what they did in Iraq and saw what they did in Afghanistan. The US also sanctioned Syria a lot which did make a lot of Syrians' lives way harder as they had to spend more. Syrians also hate Russians a lot since they cooperate with the Gov and the Gov is very hated because they basically killed their own people with chemicals and guns.

Thanks, pronunciation is fine because we have a lot of your sounds in Arabic! Probably the hardest for me is the ão and ões sounds but I'm starting to get around them. Have a nice day."
HistoryMemes,fdscl34,t1_fdsbtl3,1578699531.0,"Eh I'm free anyway as I've got nothing to do. I'd love to answer more questions!

Well.. the Kurds don't exactly have a great reputation and are usually called terrorists and are frowned upon by most of the Syrians and Palestinians. Pretty sure Iraqis are the same too. 

For the western lifestyle in ME... It depends. Some people in the Syria-lebanon region are Christians so there's that.

Lebanese people (especially from Beirut) use a lot of French and English words mixed with their Arabic which to other Arabs is very strange.

Moving to the Gulf, Saudi Arabia is still extremely Muslim with very tight control over it's population so there isn't much western influence there.

The UAE, or most commonly known by it's 2nd largest Emirate, Dubai, is obviously a very international country! 88% of the population are people from other countries. So there is a lot of culture there! It's always hip and cool to have the latest iPhone and Apple Devices, and wear Supreme clothes and expensive shit like that. Most people also speak English because there's many languages so if you happen to come to the Emirates it's very easy to communicate with all people.

Now about Brazil, we don't really know a lot. Closest is the trade relationship between UAE and Brazil which is taught about briefly in 8th grade Social Studies.

Football is BY far the most popular sport, with the 3 most well known players being: 1. Cristiano Ronaldo 2. Lionel Messi 3. Neymar

I'm not sure if I wrote those names right as I have no interest in football to be honest.

Cricket is also popular thanks to the Pakistani and Indian population.

Also, boa noite senhor/a! Eu vivou em Portugal and slowly learning the language!"
HistoryMemes,fdsae1n,t1_fdsa9zd,1578698044.0,It all kind of feels... endless. But everybody knows the rebels just won't be able to continue with Russia supporting the gov. The Kurds too are totally fucked I'd say with Turkey going in and Syrian forces attacking too.
HistoryMemes,fds8wgp,t1_fds8e7k,1578697027.0,"Well.... In Damascus right now most areas are pretty ok. There's all these sanctions and stuff which has made the price of oil shoot up and has started affecting people but mostly it's a community that continues to hold, no matter what. You'll still unfortunately occasionally see the one homeless kid or the other 8 year old smoking with some other soldiers at checkpoints, but life for some people continues to be fine. Also, some of these families, including mine's are supported from abroad from their other family members."

HistoryMemes,fdrrwgp,t1_fdrrf9e,1578688853.0,No. I was talking about Muslims. In our religion there is an example of the (in Arabic لوطيين).
