AdviceAnimals,fc2ics3,t1_fc1ey80,1577361816.0,"I just read the articles and the first takes the second one into account. The overall take away message seems to be, DO share your goals but only with someone you admire and perceive to be successful in the goal you want to achieve. And with everyone else don‚Äôt share your goal, share your PLAN. Instead of telling people you are going to lose weight say something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the gym three times this week‚Äù and that way it doesn‚Äôt give you a false sense of accomplishment and also it‚Äôs easier for people to hold you accountable. You either did it or you didn‚Äôt. Much harder to make up excuses than if someone asks how your weight loss is going."
