>Need-based grants

>Grants for women

>Low income grants

>Returning grants

>Minority grants

>Disabilities grants


>Who Are They Available From?

>Those who specialize in trades such as HVAC, plumbing, carpentry, and auto mechanics, among the many career choices available to trade school students, may pursue their education at a community college, a technical school, or a university at an undergraduate or graduate level.

>Good sources for trade school grants, for students on the path of a particular trade career, are:

>Community and technical colleges—both local and regional

>Trade and professional organizations

>State and federal government

>Need-Based Grants

>Eligibility for need-based grants takes several factors into consideration such as:

>Number of dependents in the family

>Your student status

>Family’s expected financial contribution (EFC)

>How many dependent family members attend college or other post secondary education

>Other family assets besides income

>Income may or may not be the most important determinant in the assessment of eligibility for need-based grants. There are students who come from families with substantial income that qualify for aid due to other reasons.
