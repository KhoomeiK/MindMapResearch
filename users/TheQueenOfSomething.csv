It seems though as hearing is the worst part of danish. As a scandinavian, I can almost understand their writing. Talking? Not so much.

DarkCrystal,ff2v0ua,t1_ff0prkd,1579525248.0,"I feel like she wouldn' be leading the revolution. 

Early on in the show it is established that she doesn't like responsability. She avoids it. Her sisters and mother keeps badgering on how she keeps shirking her responsabilities and spends her time in the library. 

Leadership requires a lot of responsability, and I'm not sure if she is 100% the right person for that. She enjoys spending time alone reading and researching. She is kind and smart and accepting though, but she'd never want the responsability of something this big. 

Of course, this is just my take on things. And I'm not an expert. You do bring up some good points in this post."
DarkCrystal,feyuobw,t3_eqwvyc,1579450746.0,"In most stories focusing on 3 characters, they're usually: 

Character 1- The mind

Character 2- The heart

Character 3- The warrior, or sometimes just ""the leader""

Together they are the perfect character and fullfills what the other characters lack, thus they work great together. Brea would fall into ""the mind"" character. In the end they will all have to work together in this revolution or things will eventually fall apart."

2. Slavery. In the movie podlings have lost their minds or something to the crystal and are mindless slaves serving the skeksis. I want to see that whole process play out.

3. Deet figuring out how to get rid of the darkening and returning safely

4. The scientist self mutilating. In the movie he has a mechanic leg and arm, and according to the wiki he severed these limbs himself just so that he could replace them with mechanical parts.

5. Seladon actually facing the consequenses of her actions. And Brea finding out about her mothers ""funeral""

6. Raunip. Just something about Raunip!"

You need to know english to properly navigate the internet.
