Orange is small so it is fine for a single #14, big blue is what you need for a pair of #6 stranded, tan is pretty typical for working with 1 #14 through 3 #12s in a wide variety of applications, red takes care of most larger splices in residential and commercial boxes, and there are a few other sizes that have their uses.

Green is basically just a 1-gang device box, residential thing; you take a few grounds and cut all but 1 of them to length, then the long one sticks out through a hole in the top of the greenie to be landed on a box bonding screw or a device yoke bonding screw or such."

electricians,feqyel6,t1_fepqhac,1579347455.0,"Yep, DC power distribution is more efficient than AC without taking into consideration the equipment needed to step the voltage up to distribution levels and back down for use. In fact, the primary reason AC won out over DC during the development of the electrical grid was this technical hurdle rather than an inherent problem with DC. Edison was forced to generate and distribute electricity at the same voltage it was needed for use, because his DC system had no way to do otherwise, which meant the losses and inefficiencies were insurmountable. Westinghouse's AC system could use fairly easily made transformers and brushless AC generators and motors.

These days, some power distribution is moving to high voltage DC, because the high power electronics that can step the voltage up and down are getting more economical and practical."

electricians,fepb45y,t1_fep0oj5,1579316225.0,"Yes, and yes.

Honestly, the Wikipedia skin effect article is very good. I'm skimming through it to remind myself of the details, and I'm struggling to summarize more effectively than the wiki does.

As conductors get wider to carry more current, the skin effect becomes more prevalent even at low frequencies like 60 hertz. The effect is enough that overhead electrical power lines can get away with using thick but poorly conducting steel cores for strength, because the majority of the current wouldn't flow down the center even if it were highly conductive copper. Similarly, electrical substations typically use hollow tubes for conductors because the missing conductor in the middle is not worth the extra weight and the extra supports needed for that weight.

Ultra frequency AC is useful for induction heating as well as high power radio/microwave transmissions. Less extreme frequencies higher than normal for power distribution also have their uses, like 400 hertz for aircraft power. In that case the higher frequency means you can use transformers with smaller cores and fewer windings to save precious weight, because the higher frequency creates more electromagnetic flux at the same power. That's also why high frequencies are useful for induction heating."
electricians,feojqm0,t1_fenho7o,1579301086.0,"In short, no.

The voltage of these tesla coils is obviously very high, like a taser, but the frequency is also very high to induce a strong skin effect. The skin effect is the tendency for varying current (like AC power or a data signal) to flow more through the edges of a solid conductor than through the middle, and the proportion is determined by the frequency of the waveform. For US standard 60 hertz the skin effect is minimal enough that it only really matters for large conductors carrying large currents. At radio frequencies the effect is strong enough that you may as well carry the signal through hollow conductors because the middle is next to useless.

Between the high frequency skin effect and the highly conductive suits these guys are wearing, vanishingly little current is actually passing through their flesh. They probably only feel their suits physically vibrating from the effects of the arcs, rather than actually feeling the electricity coursing through their nerves. I bet it feels super dangerous at first, until you get used to it."

gifs,fcurgs8,t1_fcu7lf6,1577986998.0,"I believe the elevator thought experiment was an Einstein original, so let's roll with that:

Suppose you are in an elevator car at sea level. The doors have closed, but you haven't pressed any buttons yet. Earth's mass curves spacetime around it, so from within that curved spacetime you experience an apparent force of 9.8 newtons for every kilogram you weigh in the direction of the Earth's center. If there were no floor on the elevator car you would accelerate (""freefall"") under the effect of that force at 9.8 m/s^2. The floor of the elevator car resists your freefall entirely, so you feel a matching force from the floor of 9.8 newtons per kilogram, and you experience this equilibrium as weight. In orbit you would freefall without the matching resistance, which is why in orbit you'd say that you're ""weightless"".

Okay, so you press a button in your elevator, and now the car accelerates upward at 9.8 m/s^2. You are experiencing 1 G of acceleration, but the floor of the car resists that plus the acceleration of gravity, so you weigh twice as much as you did at rest.  As the car approaches your destination it stops accelerating and freefalls to let gravity bring its speed back to zero before it puts on the brakes to hold in position at your correct floor. Meanwhile, while the elevator car is in freefall, so are you. Your shoes and your muscles may spring back a tiny bit under the weightlessness and you end up drifting in the air above the floor of the car!

So now let's put you in the same elevator car in deep space. We've sealed it up so you don't have to worry about any of the dangers of being there, and we've strapped some very beefy but very smoothly firing rocket engines on the bottom. In fact, those rocket engines are firing hard enough to accelerate the elevator car 9.8 m/s^2 right now, so you experience your normal 1 G weight as if you were at rest on Earth like you were before.  We can crank the throttle up and get the car accelerating at 2 G's, so your weight doubles, then we can cut the engines off entirely to make you weightless, and turn them back on at 1 G again. You're going very vast through space, and at 1 G with the rockets going you just keep going faster.

Now the punchline:

This second ride in the elevator car, from your perspective with the doors closed, is EXACTLY the same as the first ride on Earth. No, really. No human has come up with a way to tell the difference from inside the elevator car without bringing in some sort of information from outside the car to establish a reference point. It seems like gravity must get through the elevator walls to pull on you, and that may happen by means of gravity particles called gravitons that pass back and forth between you and Earth, which would mean if you can build a detector for those gravitons you can figure out what's going on and essentially break relativity. That would be a huge breakthrough in physics, and the science behind your detector would get you a Nobel prize easily."
