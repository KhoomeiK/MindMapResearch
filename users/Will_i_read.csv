I think films work the best when the story was written with the medium in mind. My favourite films where written for cinema and my favourite series as series. Adapting is just low hanging fruit and you will always disappoint at least some parts of the audience..."

netflixwitcher,fbzvzne,t3_efealq,1577264582.0,"I story it's explained that the gene of the elder blood is actually two genes, the actual gene and an activator. The activator can only be inherited i  the female line, but the actual gene gets weaker. Duni had the gene to, so it was restored to its full potential in ciri or her child, that isn't clear. The elves believe that her child will be the saviour of the worlds. The games clarified it, but they aren't canon for the Series. Why Duni had the Gen will be a big plot point in the next few seasons. I won't spoiler it, but if they go with the books it should be revealed in Season 5 or 6. Not sure about that one. 

I think the Hair gene could be connected with that to genes, or maby the genes had some interdependence. Genes aren't that simple."
