One of them picked up the pink lipstick and applied it directly to her lips. I cringed. I cringed extremely hard and wanted to vomit because the lipstick was clearly extremely worn down and *you just put that on your face.*"

AskReddit,feudgl0,t3_epyrmi,1579385519.0,"A variety of reasons. None of which are active choices; school offered driver’s ed but the people who decided my classes/arrangements never even attempted to offer putting me in it (semi-long story). My mom apologized for never fighting them on it. When I was out of school, my parents were simply too busy to get me there and wait on me to take the test. When I had someone who could take me, I failed constantly to the point they decided I had to take the paper test rather than do it on the computer. Now I either don’t have the money to do it, the time, or both. I’d still have to rely on my parents to get over there and use my mom’s car to take the driving portion.

Lucky, lucky me."

piercing,fep9u4c,t3_eqa968,1579315373.0,"So with nicer seam rings, I’ve seen that they should be closed all the way. With cheapo ones (and I’m NOT saying anyone has cheap ones!), I found they didn’t close well. It’s *possible* you slightly altered the ring’s shape when twisting. Not a guarantee but a stab in the dark, from working with jump rings and having a handful of crappy seamless rings."

Daith is still fresh, done at the tail end of October last year by Lena at Virtue & Vice. 

If anyone has a suggestion for a plainish tribal-style ring a la BVLA’s Fasske clicker (because I will need to save so, *so* very long), let me know!"
piercing,feng05l,t3_eq3hgy,1579283880.0,"Yes. Yes it does. I matched with a guy on tinder who was VERY proud of his nose ring, more so because a higher up at his job was just like “You do good work. Also keep the nose ring, it’s cool.”"

DrMartens,fe022gv,t3_enf3g3,1578801135.0,"Nappa has more grain, Virginia is a smoother leather but not as smooth as the Smooth leather; it can have a subtle grain, or be smoothed out like a leather jacket. Sadly I’m not home to take pictures of my Kristy’s and 1B99s to show what I mean in the grain. My former Nappa 1914s had a lot of texture that I could see/feel when I touched the leather. They were stiff but not too stiff; in my opinion, Smooth is stiffest, Nappa was stiff and Virginia is somewhat stiff but a bit more pliable."

Makeup,fdwnxj6,t1_fdwe0k9,1578760671.0,"I know! I was so pleased with myself to have a foundation that matched, that looked pretty nice once it was on/still a little wet but would go downhill once I had let it settle and started on cream contour. Back to the face chart board I guess."

Makeup,fdwan1x,t3_en8eig,1578756756.0,"I, on the other hand, have combination skin; right now it’s leaning more dry, but as the weather warms up, I get more oily. I hate the OG Fenty and I *hate* that I hate it. I can’t get the coverage I want, for a foundation that claims full/“medium-to-full buildable” coverage, without it ending up cakey. I’ve tried using less foundation/more carefully applied to no avail too. No matter how intensely (or how little!) I exfoliate, moisturize, prime, it makes me look drier than fake dirt. It’s like nothing pleases this foundation. 

The color match is pretty spot on for me, but I just hate the foundation. I’ll finish out my bottle but I’ll be back to Sephora/Ulta to do swatching and color matching."

I really loved that they did rainbow stitching instead of the usual yellow and the rainbow loop, it’s a nice touch to what can seem to be patent black boots. Definitely a pair I’d pick up for myself in the future but haven’t had hands-on experience with any of the glitter/rainbow/holographic types."
DrMartens,fdnv4qe,t1_fdnt1nt,1578593468.0,"Jadons are more of an “ankle” boot (7 1/2 on the standard) and 1914s are a midcalf, just maybe 5” or so below my knees. I don’t have my 1B99s so I can’t get an accurate measure. I’d say the Jadon Hi is probably about 9-10” in shaft so almost a mid-calf. As to the sole, I do notice the difference in height since the 1914 is more like a standard 1” sole compared to Jason’s 1 3/4. It trips me up a little since I forget: it’s a thicker sole, with a slight height difference. It’s like going from sneakers to a heel unexpectedly."

DrMartens,fdnando,t3_em8gne,1578581640.0,"I think it comes down to what you want style-wise. They’ll have the same leather but 4 extra eyelets on the 1914s vs the Jadons. That said...

I’ve had 1914s and currently have 1B99s–‘women’s’ version of the unisex 1914. I absolutely adored both (I sold the 1914s for anyone curious). I got Jadons about a week ago-ish and this is the first time I’ve had a boot with Smooth leather. They’re different to what I usually go for with leather boots, since I like the “matte” look/grain of Virginia leather but typical in my general style of having a platform. I certainly like both leathers, both boots will get/continue to get a lot of love. My Jadons do seem to have slightly thicker/“harder” construction than my 1B99s but I think that’s due to the leather more than anything.

If it also helps, there’s a guy who works in the same mall I do who wears Jadons near constantly and looks great."

TalesFromRetail,fdlpn4q,t1_fdlaq19,1578529495.0,"Oof. I’ve had to do this twice; first time, no self checkout at that particular chain and a dad who was probably 10 years my senior (I was 22) walks down the aisle with his maybe ~4 year old son. I wanted to die inside because I know he looked at me and away quickly. Additionally, it was a very small town. Second time, it was about 1 in the afternoon and I was going to see my boyfriend. Hid the condoms under other stuff I was picking up and trying to just glide through self checkout. I am eternally grateful that my manager didn’t thoroughly check my bag when I came back to work to pick it up. Would have been a nightmare of questions from every single coworker."

No, because we don’t price match and online is a separate store; different stores do have different sales occasionally. But why not? Because it’s not OUR store. Where’s a manager? You’re talking to (a temp keyholder) but my SM/ASM is over there (and will say the exact same thing I just did.)"
