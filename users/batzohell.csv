None of which are active choices; school offered driver‚Äôs ed but the people who decided my classes/arrangements never even attempted to offer putting me in it (semi-long story). My mom apologized for never fighting them on it. When I was out of school, my parents were simply too busy to get me there and wait on me to take the test. When I had someone who could take me, I failed constantly to the point they decided I had to take the paper test rather than do it on the computer. Now I either don‚Äôt have the money to do it, the time, or both. I‚Äôd still have to rely on my parents to get over there and use my mom‚Äôs car to take the driving portion.

Lucky, lucky me."

Sadly I‚Äôm not home to take pictures of my Kristy‚Äôs and 1B99s to show what I mean in the grain. My former Nappa 1914s had a lot of texture that I could see/feel when I touched the leather.

I‚Äôve tried using less foundation/more carefully applied to no avail too. No matter how intensely (or how little!) I exfoliate, moisturize, prime, it makes me look drier than fake dirt.

The color match is pretty spot on for me, but I just hate the foundation. I‚Äôll finish out my bottle but I‚Äôll be back to Sephora/Ulta to do swatching and color matching."

DrMartens,fdnv4qe,t1_fdnt1nt,1578593468.0,"Jadons are more of an ‚Äúankle‚Äù boot (7 1/2 on the standard) and 1914s are a midcalf, just maybe 5‚Äù or so below my knees. I don‚Äôt have my 1B99s so I can‚Äôt get an accurate measure. I‚Äôd say the Jadon Hi is probably about 9-10‚Äù in shaft so almost a mid-calf. As to the sole, I do notice the difference in height since the 1914 is more like a standard 1‚Äù sole compared to Jason‚Äôs 1 3/4. It trips me up a little since I forget: it‚Äôs a thicker sole, with a slight height difference. It‚Äôs like going from sneakers to a heel unexpectedly."

DrMartens,fdnando,t3_em8gne,1578581640.0,"I think it comes down to what you want style-wise. They‚Äôll have the same leather but 4 extra eyelets on the 1914s vs the Jadons. That said...

I‚Äôve had 1914s and currently have 1B99s‚Äì‚Äòwomen‚Äôs‚Äô version of the unisex 1914. I absolutely adored both (I sold the 1914s for anyone curious). I got Jadons about a week ago-ish and this is the first time I‚Äôve had a boot with Smooth leather. They‚Äôre different to what I usually go for with leather boots, since I like the ‚Äúmatte‚Äù look/grain of Virginia leather but typical in my general style of having a platform. I certainly like both leathers, both boots will get/continue to get a lot of love. My Jadons do seem to have slightly thicker/‚Äúharder‚Äù construction than my 1B99s but I think that‚Äôs due to the leather more than anything.

If it also helps, there‚Äôs a guy who works in the same mall I do who wears Jadons near constantly and looks great."
