I don't know if I'd say that. When she's recording herself she's presenting the image that she wants others to see (having fun with her dog in the car). When she's being recorded by another person, she's no longer in control of that image and the context of the situation has suddenly changed (being made fun of)."

If that sounds shallow then you might be right. I think it's a legitimate question regardless.

Edit: Even IF the game was 2D (it's not) it wouldn't matter a single good goddamn because v-sync and g-sync should be working regardless.

First of all, the game is 3D.

Secondly, whether or not the game is 3D does not have any bearing on whether or not V-Sync or G-Sync should work.

Third, my game settings are most certainly NOT asking too much of my hardware to “display the scrolling action smoothly”. Why? Because I have an i9-9900K and an RTX 2080 Ti as well as 32 GB of ram, and also because my FPS stays well over 100 at all times. This issue is not caused because of low FPS, as you seem to be suggesting here.

Finally, yes, it is an issue. And no it is not “computer lag”. Did you even watch the videos I provided or read the more detailed explanation in the Steam post I linked? I demonstrate *clearly* how screen tearing and uneven frame pacing are occurring.

AskReddit,febjumc,t1_febcpmf,1578959592.0,"Very interesting stuff here. I have some cursory experience with programming having made some rather complicated (to me) AutoHotkey scripts over the years. I took a very basic visualbasic class in college and I have an overall familiarity with the concepts, though I’m sure I’d need a shit ton of learning of practice to become dangerous with it. Especially if we’re talking a language I’ve never worked with before. 

Programming has never been a part of my work life; only sparsely as a hobby and for very, very specific needs that I had at the time (for example, using AHK to launch multiple programs at once and close them when it detects another is exited, resizing windows automatically, and etc. - nothing to terribly complex by lost standards I’m sure).

I’m pretty ignorant when it comes to web design. I don’t know much of the terminology much less the related concepts. I can’t even say I know what a “Wordpress” site is (yikes). Perhaps I have a very general idea of how everything works but even then I’m unsure. I do think I have a very technical mind, and I’m extremely detailed oriented and am probably pretty damn computer savvy by most standards. I’m not so sure about the creative aspect of the whole process; I’ve never found myself to be terribly creative or artistic.

All that said, if building Wordpress sites could supplement or possibly replace the income from my W2 job and it’s something I could do remotely... I’m all ears (how long might you expect a $500 Wordpress job to take, btw)? In more direct terms - is making let’s say 4k or 5k per month viable with what you’re suggesting? Is it something I could feasibly work up to over the course of... a year? Or is this “pie in the sky” kind of thinking as it relates to this industry?

What might you recommend in terms of getting started? Building up my foundational knowledge and then the more technical things I would need to know to do these things? Do I need to go back to school or should I pursue other avenues?"

I've only been playing a classical guitar for a bit under a year now and I went back and forth on nails at the beginning. I experimented with growing them out a bit. Not super long, just enough to peek over the fingertips and affect the tone.

However, even at that length they were quite annoying for me. Not because they looked all that bad; I don't think it was really noticeable because they weren't *that* long. But, I was always afraid of tearing one or damaging them in some way, and I couldn't really do any thing too physical with them.

So for my lifestyle, no nails is the way to go. I can still get a great tone out of my guitar. I can play relatively fast arpeggios and artificial harmonics, which are two things I was worried about at first. One technique that I haven't tried learning yet is tremolo, and I know it can be done without nails but I'm unsure how readily I'll be able to accomplish that feat..."

I’m not trying to actually compare the two it was more to indicate that simply because someone is educated and has spent a lot of time studying a subject does not mean that they are right in their findings,

Your example falls flat because with climate change and flat earth, we can *objectively prove* these things. That’s the whole point. Yeah you have people who have done a lot of research on the flat Earth but anyone can point to NASA’s research and immediately invalidate it (maybe not in the flat Earther’s mind, but still). You cannot do that with this.

I don’t know much about the historicity of the exodus or Jews from Egypt so I can’t speak to that, but it’s beside the point anyways. I don’t think the Bible is entirely made up. I think there is history intermixed with myth and legend. Barker outlines a convincing argument as to why we might consider the Jesus story, specifically, myth. He doesn’t try to take on the entire Bible or suggest that the whole thing is completely fabricated or void of any kind of historical record.

However, what he *does* do is show how there are *many* examples of contradictions, errors, and variances throughout other parts of the Bible, which is one reason why we should be suspicious of anything the Bible says, in general, let alone his other arguments.

You are taking what I’m saying to the extreme. I never said that Barker said we should consider the entire Bible fabricated. Is there some reason you really want to believe in the historical Jesus? This strikes me as odd, coming from a self-proclaimed atheist.

Fucking funny you should mention Josephus and Tacitus. Barker specifically mentions these accounts (and many others) and explains in great detail why they should be considered highly suspect. I can’t remember the details off the top of my head but it’s in chapter 15 of Godless.

And it doesn’t mean they’re not lol. And I don’t think *you* understand the point I was making which exists independently from your own. That is to say that we can’t and shouldn’t so easily dismiss arguments for ancient events for which the only evidence we have is copies upon copies (many times over) of *hearsay*, not even first hand report.

You’re entitled to your opinion, but it’s pretty fucking I’ll-informed. It’s like an ant trying to understand the mind of a human. You haven’t even heard Barker’s argument and you’re calling him an “idiot” and “moronic”. Your argument that it’s “less elaborate” if there was a historical Jesus doesn’t really make sense, either.

Of course Ehrman isn’t the only voice but he is a strong *atheistic* voice (at least I think he’s atheist) that I know of, so he should be able to be considered fairly non-biased. I was using him as an example specifically because I thought he was a strong voice from another side of the argument lol. I can’t speak for the other guys because I have no experience with their work just yet.

If Jesus was actually a historical figure then we have to figure out naturalistic possibilities for each miracle story (were they actual events that were embellished in some way, completely fabricated, etc). If we assume for a second that he was a myth, then these explanations by default become much easier as well (fabricated in many cases, most likely). If Jesus was fabricated, all people had to do was borrow literary devices and archetypes from stories that they were already familiar with to create him. How exactly is that complex?

I find it strange why you’re going so hard against this idea, this *suggestion* that PERHAPS Jesus was myth. Barker isn’t claiming it as fact and yet you’re striking it down as if he did, and you’re also claiming that Barker said the entire Bible was fabricated and is devoid of any historical merit whatsoever (which I never said). Think what you want, but to take such a hard nosed stance in defiance of this view without even reading it is dumb. You are the only “dumb”, “moronic” “idiot” in this conversation, and I’m done wasting my time on such a person."

classicalguitar,fdprqf8,t1_fdpriaw,1578637956.0,It's hard to say for sure but I think that some chords I once struggled with are quite a bit easier now. It's still a work in progress but it *seems* to be improving over time. Stuff like this probably takes a long time to change.
classicalguitar,fdpreph,t1_fdpqzu3,1578637618.0,"Yeah, I would say that it's a bit better. As far as the ""cave in"", I think that's primarily a strength issue. And I seem to be able to keep my pinky in the stronger position (as seen [here](https://i.imgur.com/BajjLOC.jpg)) more easily than when I originally posted this thread.

As for finger independence, that's just practice. That has definitely improved with slow and deliberate practice. Are you playing guitar again or are you asking from the standpoint of being able to type better?"
todayilearned,fdpnpci,t1_fdngeln,1578633925.0,"After I read your comment I decided to do some more digging; I don't really have a dog in the fight (whether or not Jesus was a myth, or a real historical figure albeit a non-supernatural one), but I find this question interesting and there seems to be some differing views.

For one thing, I think that your comparison is not exactly relevant. That is because with climate change, we have *current objective data* we can reference to substantiate claims. We don't have that as it relates to Jesus. In fact, we don't even have any mentions of Jesus from the time that he was supposedly alive. The gospels were written *after* the time of Jesus. And we do have other ancient texts that were written during the time of Jesus, but many make absolutely no mention of him or the miraculous events of the time, and the ones that do are highly suspect for various reasons.

I don't think it's fair to call Barker an idiot when you lack even a superficial understanding of the issue; something which cannot be gleaned by some cursory google searches. People spend their entire professional lifetimes studying this stuff and developing their opinions based upon their vast understanding of ancient cultures, languages, and etc., and I think it's unfair to reduce your conclusion to something so simplistic. The issue being discussed is one that cannot be proven objectively, and I don't even think that consensus is necessarily an indicator of probability, because many of these scholars most likely have theological agendas, themselves (for example, we know that the people who translated the NIV did so under the guidance of their ""theology"", which led to some decisions being made which were not in the best interest of historicity and accuracy). When you compare this to climate change you're trying to compare a historical issue (for which we only have copies of copies of hearsay) to a current, modern, observable and objectively definable issue. The former is far more subjective and open to interpretation than the latter.

In Barker's book, he details many different views on the historicity of Jesus and explains the reasoning for all of them. However, he tends to lean towards mythicism for various reasons which he explains quite convincingly. Bart Ehrman is a textual critic who holds a different position on the matter. He believes that Jesus at least existed, but I don't think he believes in the supernatural nature of Jesus. Here's one example of something that Ehrman thinks points towards Jesus' existence:

>""Paul knew Jesus' brother, James, and he knew his closest disciple, Peter, and he tells us that he did,"" Ehrman says. ""If Jesus didn't exist, you would think his brother would know about it, so I think Paul is probably pretty good evidence that Jesus at least existed,"" he says.

That was said in an interview with NPR seen [here](https://www.npr.org/2012/04/01/149462376/did-jesus-exist-a-historian-makes-his-case). So Ehrman is using the Bible itself as a means of justifying the existence of Jesus. However, Baker puts more stock in extra-biblical sources because he sees a Bible which has been massively edited over time, so how can we really trust it? Interestingly, Ehrman draws the same conclusions in Misquoting Jesus (that the Bible is a very human book full of errors and contradictions); it surprises me that he does not also take a more mythicist point of view. Baker would seem to think that since it's not at all implausible to assume that the Bible has been edited in some ways, why might it not be edited in others (e.g., the story of Jesus)? Is it not at least reasonable to assume that this might be the case? How could we not, after everything that we know about the Bible otherwise?

That is Barker's argument, and it seems to resonate with me. He also draws parallels from the crucifixion and resurrection stories to other mythological tales which came before and are very similar in nature (suggesting that these literary devices were borrowed from other sources). However, Ehrman makes a good point when he says this:

>""The Messiah was supposed to overthrow the enemies – and so if you're going to make up a messiah, you'd make up a powerful messiah,"" he says. ""You wouldn't make up somebody who was humiliated, tortured and the killed by the enemies.""

I'm not sure how Barker might address that point, but it seems like a reasonable one.

Suffice it to say that coming to a conclusion on the matter does not in any way seem to be a simple proposition. As a lay person my understanding only goes so far, but it seems to me that both sides have merit. I'm interested to further my understanding of Jesus and to learn more about this, but for the time being I might tend to lean a bit more in Barker's direction. I actually sent Ehrman a message on Facebook about this; I'm interested to know how he might respond to Barker's argument."

And because Christians these days are more accommodating with the LGBT movement, it obfuscates the prejudice still found in the Bible, or something like that? And if this obfuscation wasn't there, then people would more readily exit Christianity?
