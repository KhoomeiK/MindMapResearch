corgi,fczzznh,t3_ejkvn1,1578111556.0,Thanks for your reply. Thank goodness she’s on the mend. Maybe she found something to eat? I’ve had to go on a mushroom hunt in our backyard.

corgi,fcmdaqb,t3_eg5gnf,1577771201.0,"I do not have such a dog, but it would be interesting to see how pups would turn out with orange and white parents. If you find any pix, I’d like to see them. Ignore all the nay-sayers because it seems they read a lot more into your question."
corgi,fcm4g2u,t3_ehqj02,1577763982.0,"I asked the trainer at my Corgi’s obedience class what to do, as my little girl was bullying my son’s chi mix dog  all week. She said get a spray bottle of water set on “stream” not mist. Squirt her whenever she gets bossy."
