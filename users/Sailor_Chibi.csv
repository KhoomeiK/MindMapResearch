It’s like that’s all they can think about, and they live their lives just waiting to pounce on anyone who might display even the slightest of symptoms that can be related to pregnancy. I’m cynical, so I can only think their lives are so damn boring they want to live vicariously (which is pathetic) or they want to be the ones to spread gossip (also kind of sad)."

For what it’s worth, I think you’re right. That does sound like resentment being covered up by a “joke”. It concerns me that he said he thought you might change your mind, and that he’s not comfortable with you being sterilized and the option permanently taken away. All of that strongly suggests he doesn’t completely believe kids are off the table and that he may harbor hope you’ll change your mind. 

You should move forward with sterilization before you get married IMO. You being sterilized and removing that option completely could tell you a lot."

A decade is a damn long time tbh. Plus I love how her assumption is that the investment will definitely pay off: that your kids will definitely be successful, intelligent, hardworking, good people."

It drives me nuts when people say they’re having kids because they want someone to look after them when they’re older. Your child could hate you! Your child may not make enough money to care for you! Your child could die before they get to be an adult! MAKE YOUR OWN RETIREMENT PLANS THAT ARE NOT KIDS. 

When I die, I want to be cremated (small fear of being buried alive over here) and my ashes spread over the local river, I think. As for my stuff, it can go to my parents or to my sister/brother, with maybe a donation to the local SPCA. It’s not like I have much to squabble over."

They “work from home” when their kids are sick/the baby-sitter or daycare is closed/there’s no school. Or they leave early because the school has closed. The list goes on. Kids are such an unfathomable drain on not just a parent, but everyone around that parent. 

To every parent who has ever bitched about not having a village to help raise their child, I say: shut up. There is a goddamn village helping you raise your kid.
