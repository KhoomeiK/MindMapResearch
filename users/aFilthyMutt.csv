ShittyCarMod,ff21r50,t3_er5ntc,1579491463.0,I don‚Äôt understand the Cruze drivers who think they drive something special. Most come standard with a 1.5L  turbo engine and because it‚Äôs got a turbo they think it‚Äôs some kind of racing machine. Smh

Whatcouldgowrong,feokwaq,t3_eq2pd0,1579301524.0,That didn‚Äôt look like 160kmph but I guess he would have been stomping on the breaks by the time the camera panned up.

Corvette,felvclt,t3_emkl14,1579231857.0,About +150hp and -1000lbs compared to your 392 so yeah I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a lot quicker! Haha. Very nice car!

airsoft,fedubp7,t1_fecj85c,1579020056.0,"That‚Äôs not the point. It wouldn‚Äôt be a fun game, maybe the history dudes would like it but it isn‚Äôt realistic to recommend trench warfare with airsoft guns regardless of the context."

FocusST,fdm27hv,t3_em2b67,1578538053.0,If you are on a budget then go for the FireHawk Indy 500. They are great for performance and have decent durability. Plus they are cheaper than most performance tires
FocusST,fdlcc8d,t3_ely18z,1578520991.0,if you don't keep up with it on these cars then you should get ready for flakey paint all over the damn car.
airsoft,fdkrunw,t1_fdkr1ve,1578509847.0,Oh I thought the white bits were hard plastic. Thought maybe they could crack
airsoft,fdknjqu,t1_fdkh3nm,1578507274.0,There are other options that aren‚Äôt mesh and you risk breaking that mask. I guess if you like restricting your air for the sake of training then fine.
airsoft,fdj1dkr,t3_ellg4b,1578455946.0,why is that dude wearing an altitude mask...
FocusST,fdf7aex,t3_ehxcng,1578354954.0,crazy how small the CRX is compared to the ST.
airsoft,fd5pv3c,t1_fd53x18,1578180117.0,500 limit for a DMR is still better than a 650 boltie
Justrolledintotheshop,fd524zs,t3_ek07us,1578173513.0,I drive a focus ST with the RS style headlights and it‚Äôs a similar story. I would cry if I ever damaged one
airsoft,fd51sb3,t1_fd4pwga,1578173391.0,How quickly can you aim with those crappy iron sights tho? You‚Äôd be better off no-scoping
airsoft,fd51hez,t3_ek01h8,1578173286.0,"Make sure you test the muzzle velocity on that beast before using it in a skirmish, odds are it is shooting extremely hot"
airsoft,fd50v6c,t1_fd4px61,1578173074.0,Those rules are unrealistic. Most areas allow 500fps for bolt action and 450fps for DMR.

aww,fbyqhgd,t3_ef2o9n,1577223645.0,"I‚Äôm a garbage man and around the holidays we get dozens of gift cards, chocolates and sometimes cash. We take a mental note of which houses gave us presents and we take extra good care of them throughout the year. Even something as small as sharing some baked goods can get you on your garbage man‚Äôs good side!"
pics,fbxfkmb,t1_fbx8rqy,1577184831.0,What you‚Äôre suggesting is what I have done for larger objects on different flags (like the leaf on the Canadian side) and it would add at the very least two hours of work. The traced lines onto the medium would need to be sanded off afterward.. that isn‚Äôt worth it.  I did in fact think of that as I‚Äôve made about 8 different flags by now.

Dashcam,fbvt1jf,t3_eenpnr,1577135658.0,There should be a reporting system for people who drive like this.
ShittyCarMod,fbvsk1w,t3_eep2e0,1577135456.0,"I‚Äôve seen this done before and when the lights are on you can actually see right through it and it looks cool.. if they used the right material. 

Personally I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it because if someone rear ends you they could claim your tail lights have been tampered with, even if it was their fault."
