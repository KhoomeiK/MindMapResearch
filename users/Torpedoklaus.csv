Cringetopia,fets0ah,t1_fesp8wx,1579379301.0,"I spoke to a slaughterhouse owner and he said that they could use helium for stunning the pigs instead of CO2 but customers are not willing to pay enough for their meat. Also, a government raising the meat prices in a society that does not support animal welfare will not be elected again. Politicians don't want to upset the average voter so they won't push laws that will impact the voters. We must show the politicians that we are willing to decrease our meat consumption in favor of a better treatment of the animals."
dankmemes,fejr4zp,t1_fejot3a,1579183767.0,"Just a couple of thoughts:

We don't need meat to survive or be healthy.

I don't know the source, so I don't know if it's true he killed the dog for fun. However, is killing for fun and killing for pleasure (taste) or convenience really that different? Because, since we don't need meat survive, the only excuses for eating meat can be in the likes of convenience or taste.

The dog being part of the man's family is a valid argument. However, the animals we kill also have families. Dairy cows for example mourn their calves taken away from them.

Regarding laws: I would argue that there are even less laws protecting dark animals than domestic animals."

meirl,fdoq7vd,t1_fdopdfe,1578610405.0,"I know you're joking, but I always find it strange how, when humans are compared to animals, people mostly assume you want humans to be treated more like animals, instead of the other way around."

You can value the interest of two individuals equally while also valuing one individual's life over the other's by considering the first individual's ability to prevent a species' extinction. And it is foolish not to acknowledge what extinction leads to."

math,fdo1w0k,t1_fdo1gni,1578597369.0,"Let's say you have an order preserving bijection from N to Q. Then, for any n in N, (f(n) + f(n+1))/2 is between f(n) and f(n+1), so the preimage of that value under f must be between n and n+1, a contradiction. Therefore, such an order preserving bijection can not exist."

However, if you think of them as number lines, you probably want to think of them as objects of the category of ordered sets or metric spaces. In that case, they are not isomorphic (at least with the usual ordering and metric)."

classic4chan,fcla2om,t1_fcl9mu2,1577743089.0,Why do you think that? Do you not believe in people with big dicks browsing Reddit or do you not think people with big dicks can be insecure about their size? Porn has distorted young men's perception of what an average sized dick is.

StopGaming,fcl1wuw,t3_ehpvsa,1577738021.0,"When initially stopping to play video games, it can be important to keep yourself busy. For me, simple things such as cleaning my room, just getting stuff done, trigger the same reward response video games do. If you were ""productive"" just 50% of the time you would spend gaming, imagine how much you could get done. In seven hours, you can exercise (which will improve your mental health, trust me), go for a walk, do laundry, cook and still have time to study. Getting all that stuff done can release so much pressure. I too have trouble with moderation so just try not to play games at all for the first few days/weeks even if it's hard. Try to associate a negative response with turning on your games. That way, when you think about just playing one match/quest/w.e., you will immediately think about why you quit gaming in the first place. It will be hard but there are other things in life that bring satisfaction, you just need to look for them. Just compare your mental health on days you have gone outside to those where you stayed inside."

learnmath,fbe6m7r,t3_ecwh3x,1576779362.0,"From the equation 4x-y=2, you can see that the line defined by that equation has slope 4. A line being parallel to another is equivalent to them having the same slope. Your new equation must look like y=4x+b. Now, to find out b, you plug in your point into the equation: The first coordinate (-1) into x and the second one (3) into y: So we get 3=4*(-1)+b. Now, we can rearrange this to get b=7. So our equation is y=4x+7."
