LifeProTips,ffa0rra,t3_esb41f,1579725567.0,"Had a house fire a few years ago where thankfully everyone got our safely before the fire department showed up.  While we lost a lot of stuff, it provided me a rare opportunity to watch the fire dept work in a real dangerous situation.  

* Before anyone went in, the supervisor did a quick assessment, and started sending his guys out in pairs with instructions of where to go.  
* When the did go into the house, they checked in with a dude who had a whiteboard, there was a routine before they entered:
   * Supervisor:  ""TEAM 1, Johnson and Smith, area A""
   * Johnson:  ""TEAM 1, Me -  Johnson and Smith, area A"" (tapping his and Smith's shoulders as he spoke)
   * Smith ""TEAM 1,  Johnson and me - Smith, area A"" (again with shoulder taps)
* Once they were paired up, they went into the house S L O W L Y.
* There were guys outside the house constantly checking on the fire from that vantage point, communicating back any new smoke or fire that they saw.
* When the guys started coming out of the house the entry procedure was reversed.

I fully expect those firefighters to know what they were getting into, and if things got too harry they would have turned back.  A dead firefighter can save no more lives.  

I suspect that if I ever witnessed a mass trauma with paramedics or a Green Beret mission it would have the same rythm.

So the LPT should be *First responders don't put their lives at risk, so why the hell would you?*"

I live in Toronto and have access to both car and transit close to home to get into the core.  We're I are usually going somewhere on the weekend with the brood, kids are still free, adults pay 3.10 per.    

50% of the time you're right on.  A 15 minute drive is a 45 minute ride / transfer / walk.  Without question transit's a big loser here.  

The other 50% is largely a financial decision.  When we look at the cost to park ($10-$15 on the weekend) it's on par with transit.  So there are a number of occasions where we take the car because we can't justify the cost.  If transit was free, we'd take it more often."

worldnews,feke9ml,t3_epjwv7,1579198226.0,"So for the international people in the room, let me give some context about this government (I live in Toronto, and politics is my football).  

&#x200B;

The last party that ran Ontario were the Liberals who were in power from 2003 - 2018.  Through a variety of scandals, lackluster charisma and voter fatigue the last election was looking unwinnable with the Conservatives set to benefit.  The Conservative party had their own scandal which forced their leader to step down 6 weeks ahead of the election.  Through a dodgy internal election, Doug Ford won and became the leader of the Conservative party.  He benefited from the anger people had towards the last government and got elected without a real plan or platform.  

&#x200B;

He is now running the province like a guy who has no platform, political experience or real world connection to the people of Ontario.  This is just the most recent in a long line of stunningly bad decisions that doesn't seem to have any chance of slowing.  

&#x200B;

Some other highlights:

&#x200B;

 \- Cancelling a windmill program that cost the province over $200M  

 \- Forcing out the CEO of Hydro one (a private utility) which again cost millions and collapsed a merger they were working on

 \- Promising to bring back $1 beers, after being told by brewers it wasn't financially viable - currently there aren't any.

 \- Cancelled safe injection sites and a basic income pilot

 \- Made significant changes to Toronto's city council and transit plans 

&#x200B;

Finally, for those who don't know Doug Ford is the older brother of Rob Ford, Toronto's crack smoking mayor."

Though if you're in a B4, I'd be surprised if they don't have something like this in their portfolio.

&#x200B;

Hello All, I was hoping to receive some guidance or insight on my current situation. I currently work at a big 4 doing Management Consulting as a Change Manager. I have done change management for 10 years. I have an Associates in Business, bachelor’s in liberal studies, Program Professional Certificate from KTH Royal Institutes of Technology is Digital Transformations Leadership, and a Practioners Certification in Human Centered Design Thinking. I have really started to dive deep into Design Thinking and just got certified as a Human Centered Deign Thinking Practioner. 

I found out a bit late in my career that I absolutely LOVE doing Design Thinking Workshops and want to either be exclusively in that or have that included more in my job. I know I can incorporate this into my normal job, but I want to do it on a large scale. I also know my company is big and has opportunity for it but more on a one-off type of situation since I cannot really change DTE. So, I discovered a few things

1. I love design thinking while still loving Change Management 
2. I love where I work but I do not see a future here for me since it is an up or out org. I want to be exclusively in a designated area and not have to deal with the dreaded bench and trying to get staffed. 
3. I am working with a client doing a Microsoft Office 365 implementation and I really enjoy it. I learned Microsoft has their own Change Management Team!! 
4.  This is not really a discovery, but I have always traveled for work and love it, but it has only been in a regional area and I want to be global.

So, my questions are: 

1. What ways or what can I start to do to map my path in my career for the future? 
2. Do you think there are other areas I should explore? 
3. Are there any companies that come to mind that are worth taking a look at? 
4. Has anyone made this type of move and what was your experience?  
5. What feedback/insight/guidance can you provide? I was going to apply for a position at Microsoft, but I know that is not likely to pan out anything since they have such an extraordinary pool of talent they can choose from. 

Thank you for helping me while I am at a cross road.

&#x200B;

TLDR- I am in Change Management and I want to leave a big 4 because it does not really suit me. I want to be focused in one area. I want to do exclusively Design thinking or have it be a larger part of my work. I want to travel globally to continue do my change management."
PersonalFinanceCanada,feh8ncq,t3_ep3jjb,1579111425.0,"I can give you my anecdotal story.  Through some bad luck and even worse decisions I didn't have much to contribute to my RRSPs when I was younger.  So I had a lot of room that was left.  

Now in my 40s I'm doing much better financially and have a good amount of money to contribute on a yearly basis.  I'm also in a much higher tax bracket so when I invest, I'm getting a significant return, which generally goes to TFSA.  

I'd give similar advice to what's been stated below:

1.  Invest in your RRSPs so you're not paying more tax in April
2. Make sure you have enough invested so you can max out the first time home buyers plan
3. Take any additional funds and max out your TFSAs until you've done all the above and have ""extra"" money.

They're largely egalitarian, conservative and have some odd traditions.  Their people wear lederhosen the way Texans wear Stetsons, it's not out of place to see professionals wearing them in the office. 

They also spawn a lot of the German stereotypes, with aforementioned lederhosen, ridiculous passion for punctuality and of course Oktoberfest being things they take pride in.

Ride pulls up, and the driver opens the back door, but Rogers is t having it and  sits up front with the driver.  He asks about his family, friends and life, really making a connection.

The most famous instance was (ironically) Jaws.  

Jaws was a mess, shooting in the ocean was tough on camera equipment, the crew kept getting soaked and with the vastness of the ocean, errant sailboats were causing problems with consistency. But bigger than all that was the shark.  Tonnes of cash were spent on mechanical sharks, but when the hit the water the fucking fish sank.  

With all the problems, Spielberg was forced to hint at the shark, instead of showing it.  But it *worked*.  It worked brilliantly, when people didn't see the shark, they made up a far scarier scene in their heads.  

The shark gets only 8 minutes of screen time, but it was enough to create a hit, and launch the summer blockbuster."
PersonalFinanceCanada,fc3gns0,t3_efvw7q,1577389387.0,"Generally speaking retail is seeing a split in popularity. 

High end is doing well, and in a lot of cases expanding.  Luxury brands, or those that can provide an experience (personal shopper / custom service) are doing well.   

Low end and fast fashion are also doing wel, they are either cheap, or have very high turnover / repurchase to make it. 

However for those in the middle, there is a serious decline.  Best Buy, Indigo and the like are struggling as more people shop online.  Your Coverdales and Lawrence Squares are getting hit hard - too big for multiple dollar stores, and not enough brand or location strength for luxury.

However, soon after the weather turned cold, the sparrow changed his mind and reluctantly started to fly south.  After a short time, ice began to form his on his wings and he fell to earth in a barnyard almost frozen. A cow passed by and crapped on this little bird and the sparrow thought it was the end, but the manure warmed him and defrosted his wings. Warm and happy the little sparrow began to sing. Just then, a large Tom cat came by and hearing the chirping investigated the sounds. As Old Tom cleared away the manure, he found the chirping bird and promptly ate him.

(2) Everyone who gets you out of shit is not necessarily your friend.
