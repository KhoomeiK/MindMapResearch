badwomensanatomy,ff298p7,t1_ff1kz50,1579497560.0,"In short? The person did a poor job drafting out proportions and positions of parts at an angle.

Froppy is probably the least offensive of the group because she's not at as low of an angle from the rest. which suggests the artist here probably just doesn't have much practice with drawing women at different angles. Urara and the other girl for the most part aren't terrible, (antigravity boobs aside) but their head positions are way too close to their shoulders, so it looks like they have no necks. Same problems with their arms. The shortened perspective was not done correctly so they look far too short.

Momo's drawing is the worst here though. The position of her hips, legs, head, and arms are all just off enough to look odd but when put together she look like she's got a birth defect of some kind."

The first king (not emperor) in recorded history was a man who was able to stop the floods by diverting the water off into smaller branches and this was considered a miracle act as he was able to subdue what people thought then was a divine creature.

In later dynasties, dragons were also considered the symbol of the emperor itself, often the body of the emperor being referred to as the dragon's body.

Dreams of being a dragon often is associated with ambitions for the throne, making it great if you're the emperor but terrible for anyone else since that can be construed as treasonous intent."
