The new bike lanes and mid-block crossings give residents more options for safe transportation.  Long-term, this will help expand downtown NKC east along Armour.  It also discourages commuters from speeding through downtown NKC, making it more of a destination.

It is unfortunate that MODOT stepped in and mis-aligned the through lanes under I-35, after the city redid their stretch of Armour.  This now forces drivers to merge left after going under I-35."
