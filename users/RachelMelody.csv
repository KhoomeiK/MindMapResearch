Its almost like they gave us the kiss we all were waiting for just to try and soften the blow. I was invested in that connection, that chemistry, the hope of Kylo's redemption. I think the entire story needs to have an extremely artistic style where you don't necessarily know what sort of outcome may be coming. A lot of chaos, confusion and surprises throughout in order to set the stage for the dramatic/sad outcome."

Tonight she told me a story about how when she had a medical condition in her hand she didn't want to do the exercises because they hurt, but she trusted her doctor and pushed through the pain and got better.
