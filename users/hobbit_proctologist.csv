monarchism,ffa6dk5,t3_esdmzn,1579728762.0,"I have to agree. Apparently they are launching a designer brand. Over a thousand years of heritage, tradition and above all else - Duty, reduced to a bloody brand.

I understand the argument about the media but, as much as I despise the media in this country, Harry and Meghan have had a much easier ride than Diana - or even William and Kate - did.

As much as I am proud of what Prince Harry has achieved over his life, I can't help feeling he has turned his back on his duty. And that hurts me the most."

facepalm,fekh5hc,t1_fekev0e,1579199944.0,"A gallon is always 8 pints. The US system isn't the imperial system... it's the US customary system so in reality there are 3 measurement systems. US customary, Imperial and metric. 

I think you're confusing imperial to mean it covers UK and US volumes"

facepalm,fejsufu,t1_fejsdey,1579185005.0,"fl oz are exactly the same. It is only the measurement of the pint that is different and due to that, every quantity based on a pint is different.

Measuring in litres is odd because it's a totally different measurement system... so why say 4.546 litres when you can just say 1 gallon?"
facepalm,fejsoj3,t1_fejsgkw,1579184890.0,"Sorry, 16 fl oz... still don't know why the Americans put up with a smaller pint when you could have 20 glorious fl oz!"
facepalm,fejsedv,t1_fejjzz4,1579184691.0,"Cooking in lbs and Oz is infinitely easier. A gram is far too small a weight to be useful whereas an ounce is about the weight of a packet of crisps. So a recipe asking for an ounce of something is easy, but if it said ""28 grams"", it's far more confusing"
facepalm,fejs8n4,t1_fejfqw4,1579184574.0,"Because most NATO countries use metric, so it helps with cohesion. Same with the UK military. Apart from the Navy and when it comes to flying, where it's nautical miles for distance and altitude in feet."

facepalm,fejrn2b,t1_fejdz9c,1579184134.0,"I don't really find it all that confusing. Feet and inches for height, weight in stone and lbs, long distance in miles, tiny distance in mm/cm, medium distance in metres (or feet depending on the distance), degrees C for weather (sometimes Fahrenheit to make it sound like a really hot day).

It might sound like a mind fuck but it's not that bad really"

HistoryMemes,fdn3x0n,t1_fdlzhcs,1578576555.0,"You clearly don't know how Britain's constitutional monarchy works.
You cannot have a political dictator whilst the monarchy is around; the Crown has the power to shut down parliament in the case of corruption or attempted dictators.
The Crown cannot become dictatorial either, or it will be overthrown. It is a balance based on respect.
This was the basis of the civil war and the balance between Crown and parliament has basically been in place since then.
Nationalism and colonialism are nothing to do with this, I think you're confusing your -isms. Parliament and elected government is a separate entity from the monarchy."
HistoryMemes,fdb4txr,t1_fdar0mc,1578253839.0,"Not in a constitutional monarchy you don't. The UK can thoroughly criticise the Prime Minister (elected head) without the PM wrapping himself in the flag and saying something along the lines of ""if you hate me, then you're unpatriotic""."
