gaming,ffe31vi,t3_et36jm,1579835403.0,"Serious question, if a game is in development that long, how do the economics even work out? I'm not sure how big their team would be but it would be safe to assume its several people's full time job to work on this game, presumably making a livable salary. Do big games like this make a substantial profit?
Again, I know nothing about the industry really, just curious"

It's hard to see a way out of it because the drinking is just so calming and relaxing, but it comes at a price and the price just keeps getting higher.  I miss a lot of things about drinking but it just takes away too much.  Quitting is tough at first but it does get much easier."
