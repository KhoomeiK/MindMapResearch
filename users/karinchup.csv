bulletjournal,ff3m6ri,t1_ff2buh9,1579544019.0,I should probably have used engage on the Sat Sun one but I was using other phrases he uses in the trailers. I find that one interesting as it is usually in association with spies......

aww,fc1hs69,t3_efny7d,1577319172.0,Just a little.
fountainpens,fbzl7dl,t1_fbz4erc,1577250456.0,That‚Äôs a shame. I have many and with the exception of one baby bottom they‚Äôve all written well. I don‚Äôt have any EF nibs though. I don‚Äôt like too fine. And they are often scratchy in many pens.
fountainpens,fbz2xxj,t1_fbyp91t,1577233487.0,It‚Äôs pretty broad. I‚Äôd say almost double a Medium. But not like stub bold or a calligraphy nib. I think it‚Äôs really just more ink delivered. I will say I think the fine is almost as wide as a medium. But much depends on the ink too. However this is a pretty wet ink so I dunno. It shows the shading off really well.
fountainpens,fbz2qoj,t1_fbyl4ej,1577233317.0,Me I just pick up a new one for 12$ because whenever I try to ‚Äúfix‚Äù a nib I botch it. Unless you are pretty experienced for me it‚Äôs not worth the aggravation. I‚Äôve only ever gotten one bad nib from Kaweco and they switched manufacturers in the last year so they are pretty nice.
fountainpens,fbz2lev,t1_fbyft8v,1577233191.0,Zephyr is right. It is labeled ‚ÄúBB‚Äù on the nib and so I used that.
fountainpens,fbz2iz7,t1_fbyatmw,1577233133.0,It‚Äôs not scratchy. This is a Kaweco.
fountainpens,fbz2hvk,t1_fby6fm2,1577233107.0,I love it. The Voyager I set is really nice. A couple of my pens came only in Fine and I‚Äôm a medium and up kinda gal so I just pick up the size I want when that happens. If I wasn‚Äôt using great shading or sheen inks I might not as the fine works well but I like to see these inks to their best advantage and for me that is B or BB. ETA: Just realized ‚ÄúString‚Äù is NOT part of the Voyager set (which is still a GREAT set) but a paired ink with Brane -a shimmering green. I lost my mind for a minute.
