The dome of a BWR containment is not visible from the outside, as it's in a reactor building (usually rectangular). PWR containment building tend to be much larger, and domed as it is a more efficient way of containing a pressure spike."

baseball,fddlyf0,t1_fdcudk0,1578317265.0,">Both should reduce drag, which means the ball carries more. 

I think the bigger effect of reducing drag is that breaking pitches aren't as effective and are therefore easier to hit."
videos,fdai6ag,t1_fdaetb1,1578246391.0,"Disclaimer: I don't actually know the answer, I'm just speculating here.

It's almost certainly easier to fly a repair team and parts to the plane than the other way around, especially in this case where replacing a wheel is probably a pretty straightforward repair. Still, the logistics are much easier if you can land the plane at an airport with a maintenance base.

I do know that Boeing has a team that travels to make complex repairs to grounded aircraft, and I suspect Airbus and other manufacturers would have something similar. The NatGeo documentary series called ""World's Toughest Fixes"" had an episode that followed Boeing's Aircraft On Ground team while they replaced the pressure bulkhead of a 767 that had been backed into a fence in Paris. It's been a while since I saw that episode, but I think the job lasted 2 weeks or so and required a special airlift of the replacement part from Boeing headquarters in the Seattle area. They had to take the whole tail off the plane. Wildly expensive."

It's not as stale as you think. Fresh air is continually provided from the engines, and the cabin air is completely replaced every few minutes. And as for those bacteria and viruses (viri?), you're far more likely to get sick from what you touch (seatbelts, tray tables, armrests, seat recline buttons) than what you breathe."
