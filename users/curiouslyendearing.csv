Edit. I looked it up, and it looks like the at-dp was manufactured at the same time as a lighter, cheaper alternative to the st. Used for garrison duty on less important stations.

Sill a little weird though that we never saw any STs in Rebels. Lothal may have started as a backwater, but at the end a Grand Admiral used it as his main industrial base. Would've thought that would deserve an at-st.

I suspect the multiple models explanation is a ret-con. But whatever, it's a pretty smooth one."

The books were written that way to try and play on the subversion of fairy tales, and they use the lack of a sense of time to do so. The show is attempting to do the same. (To greater or less success, I personally liked it, but I can still see where they dropped it a bit.)
