She doesn't have a schedule. That is her problem. That's why she's reactive to life events and likely stressed out a lot because she's trying to handle a load of tasks without a plan.

Her solution. Get her a planner. Or use the calendar on her phone if she prefers the electronic route (plus you can set notification reminders of events/to do tasks).

The idea is she needs to organize her life. A cluttered mind to a cluttered environment and ultimately a cluttered life, and that can be very stressful. Plan it out. Make a list of things to do and prioritize them in order of importance and how long each task will take. Make time for unforeseen circumstances. 

Also as important, see that she makes time to relax and rest, even in between tasks. It's a jog, not a sprint. Pace yourself."

LifeProTips,fcvo2hr,t1_fcrhfm4,1578006269.0,"I don't know. It's hard to gauge how into me she was/is. The good thing is that we cleared the air and she's expressed a desire to stay in contact. All that said, I'd rather not have gone through the emotional distress and the drama it created.

There won't be a third time.

A lot of women and people in general will flirt or get close to you simply because they're fishing for attention from the opposite sex. This is the primary reason I would advise against making the first move, because you don't really know the other person's intentions. If you're a straightforward person like myself who doesn't mince words when it comes to feelings, putting yourself out there only to be shut down because the other person was essentially ""playing the game"" can be emotionally devastating. It's humiliating, among other things.

Is it fair that people, whether or not they are aware of it, lead others on with their behavior? No, but unfortunately that's the world we live in. 

So no. A girl is just gonna have to make it plain as day that she's interested in me before I take that step. Especially in this day and age, it's better to be safe than sorry."

This happened to me twice and both times it blew up in my face. I'm still recovering from the emotional fallout of the second time."

getdisciplined,fckl4dw,t3_ehdx8i,1577727696.0,"Good post, but what I wouldn't say is that you can hit the pause button on life. The clock is always ticking, whether you choose to stay in bed longer or get up and do something else. Life goes on. There are consequences for everything that we do and don't do.

That is not to say that rest isn't important. It's one of the more underrated aspects of life. Nevertheless, it's just another conscious choice you're making, for better or for worse."
LifeProTips,fckilwz,t1_fcke4yv,1577726140.0,"""Growing up"" is changing. The difference between growing up and the kind of change the OP is referring to is that the latter is more deliberate. Growing up is referring to a psychophysiological process of development that everyone goes through. 

Truth of the matter is people change all the time. Sometimes intentionally, sometimes inadvertently. We can change simply by changing the company we keep because we're social creatures. However, the kind of change I'm alluding to here are changes in perspective and character. Even if those things become more rigid the older we get and the less often we challenge those things, they are nevertheless still subject to change for our entire lives.

What remains relatively constant throughout our lives is personality.

In a relationship, it's important to determine which characteristics of a partner are, for all intents and purposes, trivial, tolerable, deal breakers, and unlikely to change. For example, if you're dealing with a more introverted person, it's unrealistic to expect him/her to suddenly enjoy hosting parties or being around a lot of people as opposed to spending quality 1-on-1 time.

Keeping an open dialogue is important in establishing what those things are and finding solutions to potential conflicts of interest."

That said, Koetter ain't it bro. Offense by and large sucked that game and if it wasn't for a bunch of missed FG, the Bucs are probably running away with the score."

getdisciplined,fc13a1m,t3_efl0rx,1577307019.0,"Don't focus on how much you eat, but rather what you're eating. Fitness and health is probably 80% what you eat/ingest.

So you need to start incorporating more fruits/veggies, and foods high in fiber in your diet. Eat oats/granola and make smoothies if they're more palatable for you. Legumes are a good vegetable to start with since they are generally high in protein and fiber. 

Figure out what you like and go from there. Look for recipes. Experiment if you like to keep it interesting.

You don't necessarily have to make wholesale changes immediately. You can gradually make small, different choices, and just be consistent.

All the best in your journey."
LifeProTips,fbxzb15,t1_fbxtsff,1577204319.0,"How exactly is a ""failed relationship"" being defined here? There are different kinds of relationships. Two people may not work well together but otherwise get along just fine. 

Irreconcilable differences does not invariably mean that no relationship can be established or maintained. That's especially true within the context of family. It's a matter of perspective, setting boundaries, and determining what is or isn't tolerable for you, which has to be communicated."
soccer,fbxxmnx,t1_fbxl14b,1577203140.0,"I always knew the spelling, but I never actually knew the meaning of it, nor did it ever cross my mind that it's Latin. Based on how I had seen it used in context, I assumed it meant something to the effect of ""necessarily,"" that is to say, when someone is about to make a comparing or contrasting statement.

Thanks for pointing that out. r/todayilearned"
