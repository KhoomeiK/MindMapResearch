Dig hard, dig deep, go for shelter, and never look back."

science,fdorrcm,t1_fdobizk,1578611427.0,"Stay in school.  It'll give you a good foundation, and very importantly the networking connections for a solid start.  Focus on the fundamentals. Learn to learn, and adapt.  The technologies in this field change so fast that being able to learn on the fly is a must. Learn a little bit about the jobs of those you'll be working with.  I can't tell you how useful understanding a bit about marketing is.  It allows you to head them off before they make a clusterfuck if your site(s). It'll also help you promote your own work. Also, take a break every now and again. Super long coding sessions are nothing to brag about, and only lead to mistakes, and burnout in the long run. Hope this helps, and good luck."
