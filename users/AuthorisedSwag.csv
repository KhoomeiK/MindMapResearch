fatlogic,fdnpczh,t1_fdnozjl,1578590371.0,Thanks! It's just hard to visualise the sizes involved when sometimes people on this sub talk about three slices being enough. I'm guessing the slices might be larger then?
fatlogic,fdmutv8,t1_fdlkywp,1578566851.0,"Yeah, I have to remember this when people on this sub talk about eating ""A WHOLE PIZZA"" as if it's a huge amount of food. I'd love to see what the US pizzas look like.

In most places in the UK, a whole pizza is meant to serve one person and (pulling up what I usually have at Pizza Express) is 900 calories, so perfectly reasonable within a lot of TDEEs, particularly if it's a workout day."
fatlogic,f8dn42i,t3_dzyn4c,1574499489.0,"I used to do the ""5-2"" diet, where you eat 500 calories on 2 days each week (and sensibly on the remaining days). It basically works by giving you a calorie deficit over the course of the week. And the amount of careful planning and willpower those 500 calorie days took makes me suspect extreme BS whenever anyone claims to have eaten that sort of amount ON A DAILY BASIS for a considerable length of time. (For context, I'm a 5 ft woman who started at 60kg and I was STARVING)."
