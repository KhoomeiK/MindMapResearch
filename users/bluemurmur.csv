 I’ve stayed in my current job much too long waiting for a promised change that never materialized."
careerguidance,ffapbii,t3_esjqg9,1579741324.0,"Do not argue with your manager over it. it’s a done deal when she said that HR and MD are done with annual numbers/promotions.  Do not say you will seek other employment.  Some managers view that as a threat or simply don’t care.  

Do update your resume and start looking. Once you accept another job, give your notice.  If they ask why you’re leaving, let them know why."

If you want to pursue an MBA, try to get a job with a company that has tuition reimbursement towards a degree. Better yet, seek employment with a college or university and then pursue the MBA if they offer it."

careerguidance,ff0wnq9,t1_fezw03l,1579472997.0,Exactly! So many people think lawyers make lots of money because of what they see on tv legal shows. I was 14 points from passing the bar and just couldn’t go through it again since I didn’t want to practice. Went to law school cause of my parents.  Thanks!
careerguidance,fezuy84,t1_fey4y9e,1579461992.0,"Do your friends that have a law degree, but didn’t pass the bar and do not practice, include the law degree on their resumes? 

I’m asking because I’m in the same boat and sometimes get more questions about the law degree than my 15+ years of work experience!"

During the verbal review, direct manager came out and said boss said “if she doesn’t want to be on the team, then she can leave, we don’t need her”. This boss basically contradicted what the company leadership says.   Thank you for replying!

That being said, be prepared to buy a new furnace within 1-2 years of buying the house.

RealEstate,fctappo,t3_eiqf6l,1577937476.0,"A lender’s mortgage documents are generally boiler plate, especially in the states.  There is no negotiating at that point. You should’ve received the estimated lender fees at the application stage. You usually lock in the rate ahead of closing. Main things you want to look for: no prepayment penalty, the loan terms match what you were told, name is correct, address is correct, etc.   Now if you’re not familiar with mortgage docs, a lawyer can help you but don’t expect the lawyer to negotiate with the lender."
