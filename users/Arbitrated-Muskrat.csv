His whole deal is helping young men find a path in their life that bears meaning and responsibility.  He’s also a psychologist with many years as a practitioner so he has real experience with people similar to your case."

I am an honours economics undergraduate so im unsure of technical intensities of masters programs, but I’ve done econometrics at an honours level (which is barely differentiated from graduate level at my university) and if you are not educated in such a field already im unsure of your potential to teach yourself AND  keep up with work.

Power to you friend."

I heard a lecture by a psychologist talking about this (where i get the idea) and how he helps his patients overcome issues similar to this. First your learn how to shake hands, then how to introduce yourself, and a simple question you can go to every time. Practice with your girlfriend, from making sure your handshake doesn’t resemble a dead carp in firmness, to roleplaying different questions, and even making eye contact (the more the better!).

Being introverted is merely a measure of your ability to be in large group settings for long, so drop the mindset that it is affecting meeting new people and go for it!"
selfimprovement,fdl693r,t3_elwxbh,1578517753.0,"As for “confidence in your abilities” i’ll assume you mean in your school setting. I (20M) have found great place in reconciling my inner confidence and outer confidence by joining student groups that work to serve students. It helped me go from the Jockishrugby captain with many personal problems and insecurities in high school, to someone i see value in and can respect.

If you’re in a discipline that doesn’t have much of a community outside the classroom (at my uni there are only active Business Biology and Kinesiology groups) then try a skill-oriented group like toast-masters. Everyone in these groups are there to grow and watch others strive, and are ready to help."

Speaking agains’t superiors generally ends with a negative value judgment (not always the case). Informing the doctor that he is in fact not removing your left leg but your right, is a positive value judgement (always the case... lol)."

Make it seem they are successful, and that may be the case with your soon to be married peers, or ones getting fantastic jobs. Id guess they have no time in their lives to pursue what they want, and maybe might not have the right partner for them.

What I’m trying to get across is no one will own up to these failures to themselves, following paths that aren’t meaningful to them. What could help you is to take advantage of your self-awareness of not being everything you could be and to push through your current affairs. Try your hand with “planning your life” books. Watch a few ted talks and get inspired perhaps.

Power to you friend!"
