HeadphoneAdvice,ff61urr,t3_ertw56,1579616999.0,"Personally I feel Marshall headphones aren't built very well, but still, try to take care of anything you own. If you really need to put hardware through its paces, try sennheiser. Even though they use plastic, for some reason none of the ones I own have ever broken. My HD 580 from 2006 lasted me until 2017 when I gave them to my cousin and afaik, it's still intact. Precision German engineering."

Btw adapters on AliExpress are around 50 cents if you're interested"

But when you really shell out the money, the u12ts are something else. Never thought that level of sound could come from something that small in comparison to headphones or even speakers. 

But will it be worth spending THAT much money when you could buy an Andromeda and get 95% of the u12ts. That's up to you personal finances. Law of diminishing returns."
