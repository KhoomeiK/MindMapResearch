ask,fehprk5,t3_ep6rt1,1579121432.0,"last week when I was driving a song was playing on this radio station I listen to (I don't think my car has an aux, and if it does I never found it). I had to stop the song before it ended because I got home before it did. I had to go out like 2 days later and when I turned on the car the same radio station was on and the same song was playing around the time I cut it off. definitely weird."
offmychest,feds8np,t3_eof3bt,1579018784.0,"I want to go into teaching, but its things like this that are holding me back. I can't believe what things have become and that this is what teachers have to be trained to do and worry about. two of my brothers are still in middle/high school, and im scared for them everyday.

I know it may not be the same, but im a camp counselor over the summer for 5 year old children. during our orientation we had shooter drills and were told what to do and where to bring the kids. they had red hearts all over the camp as a place where we could hide the children. it was a scary realization knowing that there wasn't many buildings to keep them safe, and our option was mostly behind bushes or trees. we were told that if something were to happen, get all the children lined up and have them hold the back of each others shirts. my supervisor told us in the preschool division to never do that, bc the kids wouldn't understand and it would take less time to pick up as many as possible and just start running. It was the worst thing to know that between 4 counselors and 25 kids that we wouldn't be able to have saved all of them if that situation ever occurred."
