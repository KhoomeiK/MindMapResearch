Switch,ff11wjh,t1_ff10ude,1579474403.0,I‚Äôm definitely gonna go load my last save before the final battle and watch it. Thanks!
Switch,ff10mb8,t1_ff0yo5q,1579474049.0,I honestly didn‚Äôt even try and capture him lol. It‚Äôs funny because I was looking in my gallery and saw a boss ghost missing and was like what..I‚Äôm missing a boss? How is that possible? I followed him into the editing room after the battle but didn‚Äôt think anything of not capturing him since I already had the elevator button.

relationship_advice,fegv6y8,t3_ep3res,1579103264.0,"Trust is the foundation of a healthy relationship. If there‚Äôs none, it‚Äôs either not going to work out or be very, very toxic. You and your SO need to be on the same page with your opinions on things like cheating, especially if you‚Äôre a long term relationship guy."

relationship_advice,fbxs7xb,t1_fbxrzr0,1577199081.0,"That is entirely up to you and what you want to do with your business. If your friends are good with the relationship stuff and have given you helpful advice in the past, I‚Äôd say go for it. It‚Äôs never a bad thing to get some support from your friends and talk things out."
relationship_advice,fbxroth,t3_ef232i,1577198651.0,"Going through a breakup is really tough, especially when your SO wrongs you. You absolutely did the right thing by leaving her. 
I know at this moment you probably feel horrible, but trust me, in due time, everything will go back to normal and you‚Äôll look back on this and thank yourself for leaving this relationship.
Spend time with friends, enjoy their company, do what makes YOU happy. :)"
