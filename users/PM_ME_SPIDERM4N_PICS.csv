Well it’s a good thing we’re talking about Star Wars, innit?

I fail to see how just because a corporate entity declares something is no longer canon necessarily makes it so, but *they literally mention, in the film, that he flies these things* we didn’t need a comic for that. As in, it was already written into his character *in movie*"

StarWars,fdotci3,t1_fdoovgk,1578612421.0,"Which makes him a more believable character honestly. He doesn’t have a “I know kung fu” moment from receiving force waterboarding. His journey is about discovery and growth. He has to earn his strength and we as the viewers experience it. 

Literally everything Rey does is obnoxiously flawless and infallible before 9. For fucks sake she randomly janks a piece of the Falcon out and fixes it, not to mention flawlessly powers and handles it like she spent her whole life flying before that, and that’s just one example. Don’t disservice Daisy like this. She deserved to have a real character and a real arc. This could have been done so much better; imagine if she didn’t start off with a strong connection to the force but her skills as a street rat were emphasized, giving her a rogue like personality who was able to compensate and get out of dangerous situations by the skin of her teeth, because of her upbringing on a harsh desert world. Imagine if her abandonment gave her trust issues and she had to learn how to overcome them over the trilogy, with that also being the danger that could bring her to the dark side as she began to learn her force sensitivity. Her, Finn, and Poe *all* deserved better. Rey, the wary rogue with a good but scarred heart. Finn, the haunted shellshocked soldier overcoming a lifetime of brainwashing. Poe the—- pilot.. ^wecanworkonthatonemaybegivehimaneyepatch

Fully fleshed out you wouldn’t even need to bring the og characters. Those three ^welltwobutgiveabout10tripstoastarbucksandwecandosomethingaboutpoe by themselves would be an unlikely trio of heroes I’d love to have seen and grown with as they *became* formidable, balancing against the *raw power* we saw Kylo represent in the beginning of 7 ^whodidn’tevenneedtobeasolothiscouldhavehappenedacenturyafterrotj
