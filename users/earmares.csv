Go through The Brand New Vegan's website with him, maybe some of that will sound good. Lots of healthy, filling, comfort foods. 
 
If nothing else, just have him remember to fill up on lots of carbs (potatoes, whole wheat pasta) and some healthy fats (avocado, nuts) and avoid processed oils and add as many fruits and veggies as he wants. 

Good luck!"
