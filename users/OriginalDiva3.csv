We have a gate,  ordered from Wal-Mart, that has a kitty-sized opening in it to allow kitty to stroll in and out but keep out the dog.  It also is adjustable width & quick opening latch for ease in going in and out.

povertyfinance,fc35x9e,t3_efukjh,1577382236.0,"About the roommate? Ask for a deposit if they are interested, even a nominal amount like $50.  Tell them they have 3 days to change their mind and any later they will forfeit the money.  Have someone look at your resume (I know Reddit has some people that regularly offer to do so.)  Maybe they can show you something that is preventing people from asking for an interview.  It's always good to get a fresh eye and perspective on a situation.  And it could be something as simple as grammar or syntax error or a typo on your resume.  Speaking as a former proofreader, you cannot catch mistakes in your own work or if it's something you are already familiar with.

Good luck."

aww,fbxmx9b,t3_ef10aq,1577194360.0,"If she regularly goes outside of her litter box, when she used it before, think about reasons why she is doing this. Have you changed the brand of litter? Do you scoop it every day? Is there something physical going on with her that she wants you to notice? 

It's not normal for a litter-trained kitty to go elsewhere. Think about it and see if you can figure it out. If it's just a dirty litter box problem, try the one-scoop out, one-scoop in method every day (plastic lined box). Works very well for about a month in between changing out the litter.

Adelaide is very pretty."
