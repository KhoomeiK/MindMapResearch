This subreddit treats the CMs like dirt, as well as new players. I try offering my input as a new player and I get shit on for it. The community managers try to comment something here and they get abuse and pestered to death about stuff they have no control over.

Same goes for the BR subreddit. I don't blame them for wanting to distance themselves from Reddit specifically. This place is a dumpster fire."
RWBY,ffexluu,t1_ffehefk,1579869554.0,That's child grooming. Grooming as a general definition is the act of coercing someone into doing something by exploiting their weaknesses. Cinder for example groomed Emerald by offering her shelter and safety then turned abusive towards Emerald instead. That's a form of grooming.

FortNiteBR,ffc3z62,t1_ffc3u3l,1579790963.0,The staff were under crunch to get this season done. That's why there's been so many issues. Do some research.

RWBY,ffaplut,t1_ffaotfd,1579741517.0,"Bullshit is yours actual data. Yours is useless. Jaune could kill a huge horde of fodder while Qrow kills one Grimm and your criteria would put Jaune leagues ahead of Qrow.

RWBY,ffanz85,t1_ffam4oj,1579740421.0,"Look at what the people who can jump extreme heights are wearing. Lightweight clothing and no armour or metallic plates. Jaune's armour is gonna be heavy. Plate armour is incredibly restrictive in movement capabilities.

Kill count and mobility are hardly good criteria for determining skill level. By your criteria, Ruby is better than Qrow because she has a higher kill count during the train fight in V6. See why your criteria make no sense?

If we're going to determine skill level, it should be based on things like how much damage they took in the fight. Did they avoid injury or were they beaten up and had their aura break? Did they play to the weakness of who or what they're facing or did they just go for the kill and hope for the best? How did they use their equipment that is available? Did they utilise their semblance or not? Things like that are much better criteria for determining skill level."

Yes because getting more kills is a sign of skill level. Look who he fights alongside

>Slowest

What do you expect? You want him to be like Usain Bolt? He's wearing plate armour unlike everyone else. You try sprinting in that stuff and you're gonna be exhausted in seconds

>Can't leave the ground

Again, heavy armour unlike everyone else

Your criteria for skill are flimsy and definitely just come across as you taking a dig at Jaune as a character."

Disco Domination, Air Royale, Floor is Lava etc. are all gonna have to be rebuilt for the new map. They can't just drag and drop them into the new map. We'll no doubt see more LTMs in the future but for now, they're giving us the ones that required very little to port over to the new map.

Besides, the other LTMs likely went on the backburner so they could get Winterfest and the Star Wars event sorted out. Those no doubt took priority. Considering we're gonna be having a slow start to the new chapter, I'd imagine we'll start seeing more LTM variety in Season 2 of Chapter 2. And for the love of god EPIC, MAKE SOME OF THEM SOLOS! Sick of seeing the LTMs be duos or squads."
RWBY,ffajf49,t1_ffaixj1,1579737215.0,Not really because at this point they're all on fairly equal skill levels in my opinion so nobody is particularly worse than anyone else. Seems to me like you're just picking on Jaune when he's improved the most out of the two student teams.
FORTnITE,ffadb8w,t1_ffa7acz,1579732858.0,"As one of those players you mentioned (currently late Plankerton), yeah...

Getting Razor was not fun.

Like, these kind of comments always completely ignore new players and quite frankly, a lot of people ignore new players anyway on this subreddit.

Clover has been helping get Qrow on his feet and watching Qrow resist having a drink at the Schnee manor as well was brilliant.

Whether Qrow and Clover is just friends or they go for Bi Qrow with Clover as his partner or just a quick fling, Clover's character and his interactions with Qrow have been fantastic and really did give Qrow a reason to keep going.

It was basically figured out using the 'cut off' age for acquiring Maiden powers as well as considering Yang's age seeing as she's the older of Taiyang's kids. Yang is 19 at the moment and the cut-off is supposedly around 30 years old for gaining the Maiden powers naturally i.e. the death of the current maiden. Raven would've had Yang shortly after her time at Beacon came to an end so she'd have been early 20's. Add 19 years on to that gets Raven in her 40's along with Taiyang and Qrow.
