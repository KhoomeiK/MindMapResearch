ender3,feu8l7i,t3_eq7e8e,1579384217.0,"List of upgrades, with information:

Aluminum extruder. The stock plastic one is pretty garbage, as it snaps easily.

Capricorn tubing. Tighter tolerances, much more resistant to high temperatures than stock.

Motherboard fan cover. Printed upgrade. If you have the Pro version, ignore this. Helps prevent filament strands from going into your motherboard box.

SKR Mini E3. Quieter stepper motor drivers and lots more expansion. Get this if you hate the sound of your current drivers, and/or want to experiment with Marlin.

ABL. Is a pretty big deal, and saves a whole lot of time when leveling a bed. Will require a motherboard other than stock, and different firmware.

Better, custom fan duct. Allows for better cooling and use of 5015 blower fans. Get if your parts cooling fan is breaking/broken, or if you absolutely need better cooling. May require soldering.

Quieter fans. 4010 for the hotend/motherboard, and whatever parts cooling fan your duct supports. 4010s are just a simple solder and swap, but the 5015 will need a custom duct that supports it.

Enclosure. Only really practical for ABS. Not a necessity for other filaments.

Hotend swap. Only swap hotend a if you need to (ex. 300° nozzle temps). Requires a PID autotune, and whatever else the manufacturer recommends.

The first three should really be done off the bat, but the rest of them are a part of the *if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it* category."

2. That meat-tenderizer thing at the front does literally nothing.

3. The biggest issue is with that optic. See how it sits way back on the gun? With the way the Luger functions, that scope is going to get whipped up and down with every shot. [Luger action](https://youtu.be/aw9g-CcrGW0)."
