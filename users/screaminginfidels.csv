**1** The words of the Teacher,\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+1&version=NIV#fen-NIV-17317a)\] son of David, king in Jerusalem:

**2** “Meaningless! Meaningless!”  
 says the Teacher.  
“Utterly meaningless!  
 Everything is meaningless.”

**3** What do people gain from all their labors  
 at which they toil under the sun?  
**4** Generations come and generations go,  
 but the earth remains forever.  
**5** The sun rises and the sun sets,  
 and hurries back to where it rises.  
**6** The wind blows to the south  
 and turns to the north;  
round and round it goes,  
 ever returning on its course.  
**7** All streams flow into the sea,  
 yet the sea is never full.  
To the place the streams come from,  
 there they return again.  
**8** All things are wearisome,  
 more than one can say.  
The eye never has enough of seeing,  
 nor the ear its fill of hearing.  
**9** What has been will be again,  
 what has been done will be done again;  
 there is nothing new under the sun.  
**10** Is there anything of which one can say,  
 “Look! This is something new”?  
It was here already, long ago;  
 it was here before our time.  
**11** No one remembers the former generations,  
 and even those yet to come  
will not be remembered  
 by those who follow them."

relationships,fel0wc5,t3_epq636,1579211669.0,"I was assaulted by my first girlfriend many moons ago. We'd broken up, she found me drunk at a party and kept feeding me booze until I could no longer say no... anyways she then went around telling people that I had taken advantage of *her*. I blocked out the memory of that evening for years, and if I did get glimpses of it I would excuse it away or just blame myself. 
My close friends never believed her but there was a group that I'd run into at shows sometimes that she started hanging out with. Would get really nasty looks from them, etc... looking back I'm kind of surprised none of them jumped me or anything like that. She dated one of these guys for awhile after me. 
What happened in the end? Liars are liars, and I dont know the full story, but a year or so later I saw this dude at some party and he was incredibly warm to me and asked how I'd been, etc. We didnt discuss it but I understood from that interaction that he'd realized she'd lied about what happened between us.
That was a massive overshare on my part, but my point is just give it time. It sucks being bad mouthed, especially when you weren't in the wrong, but people will forget, move on, or realize the shit talker is just a shit talker eventually. 
Best you can do for now is block your ex and stop checking up on them. Focus on yourself and your hobbies. Find a way to spend energy creatively. Good luck! I wish you the best."
