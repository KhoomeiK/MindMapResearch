Thanks, that was helpful"
zen,ffce7ic,t1_ffcddcv,1579797549.0,"I could give you a rational explanation to each of them but I assume that was not the intention and I do not want to get into an argument.  
Thank you for trying to help, I will keep looking"
zen,ffcdfcc,t1_ffccbmq,1579797060.0,"Thank you for the explanation, I partially got it  
I will keep digging into it and hopefully they will start making sense"
zen,ffcd4zc,t1_ffccpf1,1579796883.0,"I read a lot of spiritual books and practice meditation daily, but these kind of stories are still a challenge. I am sure its me, but at this point they just seem written  by a child and interpreted by an adult trying to make sense of something that does not make sense in the first place."
zen,ffccpf1,t1_ffc7h1f,1579796614.0,"Thank you for the recommendation but I dont know if I can handle that.   


I finished the first story (A monk asked Jōshū in all earnestness, “Does a dog have Buddha nature or not?"" Jōshū said, “Mu!”).  
I cannot make any sense of it, even the explanation. I got no moral from it and nothing that I can really use.   
The author is just going around and ""weakly"" tries to to justify a point that is even opposite of what the guy said (That a dog has a buddha nature).   


Even if this was true, how does this help anyone to behave in the world, what should I take from it?"
zen,ffcbrpr,t1_ffc9wbw,1579796030.0,"Thank you for the explanation, I can see that being applicable to many zen stories  
However, in this case, the master is not pointing to the mind, he is pointing to himself "" ... your servant the monk has the answer "". So the emperor does not have the answer, only the master has.   
How can the answer be in another individual?   


Probably I am rationalizing this too much"
zen,ffc66pi,t3_esu096,1579792460.0,"Could someone explain me this one? All the stories in this sub seem to have some similarities but I cannot really get to the core of it

Probably  I still did not fully grasp the concept of Zen (Please miss me with the ""There is nothing to grasp blah blah..."")"

selfimprovement,fegu3jm,t3_ep3etk,1579102563.0,"The only way I found is through meditation. You get affected because of some internal struggle (probably related with self worth).   
Meditation will help you be in peace with yourself and not be affected by external triggers. It gives you the power to not react or be affected by things out of your control.  


If you struggle that much, it will be extremely hard to do it in the beginning, it requires a lot of power of will.   
P.S.: Reducing social media also helps. Without us noticing it puts a big performing  pressure on us, even if we think it does not. The constant unconscious comparison does not help  


Good luck ;) You can reach to me if you need some meditation tips"

psychology,feg68i1,t3_eorcr2,1579078885.0,"Extremely biased! Probably made by people who wanted to justify their behaviors/addictions

Here is the core theory for dopamine fasting:

You have 2 types of rewards, satiation rewards (Sex, food etc.) and incentive rewards (Pursuing a meaningful goal).

The theory is that satiation rewards (food, sex etc.) shut down the motivational system because they make you satisfied. In the short term, you will have no incentive to pursuit the long term goals (incentive rewards). However, the incentive rewards are what we live for and what gives meaning to our life.

The objective of a dopamine fast is to distance yourself from the satiation rewards and see the damage that they can cause (when in excess). Its a very powerful tool to bring meaning to someones life and break extreme consummatory behavior. It does not work for everyone but people should give it a try."
unpopularopinion,feczc51,t1_fe8u9dq,1578990961.0,"That is exactly the point. Such a rational and smart person believes in it, maybe there is a very good rational explanation for it?  


P.S.: Ideas are not invalid because you place someone in a specific sect"
unpopularopinion,fe8o85o,t1_fe8j8r2,1578928465.0,"I was thinking exactly like that, then I watched Jordan Peterson´s ""Maps of Meaning"" on youtube. We are very fast at discarding things from the past without trying to understand them. They are there for a reason, built by hundreds of generations"
