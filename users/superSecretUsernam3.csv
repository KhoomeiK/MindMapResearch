If I had gotten help I might have been able to be diagnosed as borderline as soon as I turned 18, since it was such an obvious case, and not have to wait until age 24 and 3 suicide attempts later to get proper medication."

We had a ""horses don't exist"" movement some years ago in Sweden, and they're kind of funny, and I've always thought of flat earthers the same way. Some people started trolling, a few took it too seriously, but it's not like with antivaxxers that they actually put people's lives in danger.."

The big problem occurs when I can't really enjoy my food and feel that I wish I could just go home, and then start crying uncontrollably because I feel so ridiculously sorry for myself and freak out everyone around! 

Never threw my food though!"

Then just try to ignore the whole situation and really enjoy yourselves, as you would at anyone's wedding. If you want revenge than bare in mind that the bridezilla will probs be pissed if you enjoy yourself!"
