I would 100% say the most important thing that helped me is building the  below in to a rock solid routine, while you might not think they are relevant to your learning goal directly they give you the clear head and presence of mind to learn efficiently and you will feel great!!

learn to meditate (essential! Check out headspace app to guide you in early days)

take up basic yoga (I personally do 15 mins nothing drastic, check out down dog app)

Some sort of fitness routine

Read a lot of books, this create its own rabbit hole of learning as one book leads to the next!
