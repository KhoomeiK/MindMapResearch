socialanxiety,fe5shai,t3_emst6p,1578873962.0,"When I was 10 years old, I began to play football with a local team for about a year. I went to countless training sessions and matches against other teams during this time. At the end of the year we had a ceremony in which all families of the team gathered and each player stood in a line on an elevated stage and our coach that had been training us for the entire year started handing out a medal one by one and then somehow (I still don’t understand how it was possible) he forgot or just didn’t give me a medal so I just stood there empty handed whilst everyone else in my team were holding their medals up in the air for their families to see and cheering. Then when we walked off the stage and back to our families I remember my friends dad asking me with this worried or almost shocked face “Didn’t you get one \[my name\]?” and I could instantly feel my emotions overwhelming me and I was just like “nope” and I don’t really remember more from that day, sort of suppressed it. (I just felt betrayed by my teacher which I very much liked and sort of looked up to, I've struggled with SA before that time tho but I think that really helped fuel it.)

TLDR: Was part of a football team (10 years old at the time), coach forgot to give me my medal at end of year when everyone was watching and it ruined me."
