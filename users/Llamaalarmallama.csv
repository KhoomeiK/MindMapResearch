They're then handy with shinobi w/conceal spotters to keep softening up each pod. Give them all the special abilities, pistol abilities and other weird ""pinch"" abilities are nice, I tend to give them a bigger gun too so their a useful ""basic grunt"" once the rockets are used. It's been a while since my last play but I remember them synergising well with the tech/war suits too. Extra shots/etc.

Snipers... In the right spot, late game can solo the softened up pack with a bit of luck, same the shinobi. I tend to go with a sniper w/conceal + shinobi w/reaper as a 2 man spec ops pairing for later tight timed missions. The sniper sits in conceal and is spotter for the shinobi to keep stomping packs, when it comes to pinch time they're also there to cover poorly judged final reaper attacks that don't finish it and to cover civvies on evac ops while the shinobi is working on thining out anything pursuing.

I typically have probably 1/4 of my squad as shinobi. Haven't yet played LWotC so... I'm talking X-com 2 LW2, maybe it'll change but... yeah, they're one of the hardest hitting classes imo. A little care with enemies with melee counters (they should be stocked with flashbangs) and they absolutely wreck.
