todayilearned,ff86swh,t1_ff86dm0,1579667618.0,There has been a lot of mounting evidence that human civilization was reset in a world wide cataclysm 12000ish years age. Something called the Younger/Dryas boundary if you wish to read into it further.
bald,ff7fj0v,t1_ff6wawn,1579648370.0,"I have always been built like a brick shit house, and over the last 7-8 months or so I have shed about 84lbs. No need to suck it in much any longer."

gaming,ff367db,t1_ff35mis,1579534645.0,"Yeah, I have lost faith in Bethesda. I won’t be buying on release anymore and will wait to see how they try to micro transaction the hell out of the game before I purchase."
politics,fez7s3t,t3_equnqk,1579454570.0,"I am actually not against the privatization of SS, as long as I get the money I have contributed back out with interest, and the government has to pay back what has been stolen from it since it’s inception. My primary reasoning is that the government wouldn’t be able to steal from it any longer."
bald,few7zir,t1_few7nw8,1579406674.0,"Nope, why do you ask?"
wow,fem31wp,t3_epp8zg,1579238111.0,"This whole patch is garbage. Both daily grind zones are very spread out and take much longer to navigate then Mechagon or Naz, but I guess you all have flying now, so Blizz says fuck off.

The daily grind zone's quests are poorly paced, some being fairly easy to find updates for, but then always leaving you with one you have to spend 5 times longer in the zone trying to complete. Horrific visions are bugged for many people and not dropping any loot at all.

On top of everything, they have confirmed that this is the last content for BFA, 8.3.5 has been cancled. So we will be riding this patch until Shadowlands. 8.3 was going to make or break the legacy of BFA, and it has made BFA the worst expansion Blizz has ever released IMHO."
Amd,fedxgbw,t3_eo5n0v,1579021944.0,"1. Fan controller software that works properly and supports zero fan at custom settings.

2. OC settings that don’t reset at random, or an option/checkbox to keep OC even after driver/game crash.

3. A frame rate cap competitive with RTSS and nVidia’s brand new FPS cap."
aww,fe0ck3h,t1_fe0aub5,1578809828.0,Well... you saw color he was....
WhitePeopleTwitter,fe0b19p,t1_fdztnu4,1578808279.0,"I feel you man. I am 35 and haven’t dated a woman for much more then a month in about 15 years, last one was about 2 years ago now. I have a decent career, am not bad looking, tall, well built, but I just can’t find the right woman. Fuck, I can barely even get a date in this online dating world. But I still think I will know the right one when I find her."

todayilearned,fds86tb,t1_fdrq3tz,1578696556.0,"Definitely true, most of the wifi networks around me were susceptible to reaver\\WPS exploits and typically took around an hour to crack and display their wifi password for me. Other ones that were not susceptible to reaver, which I think was only one, I had to use a rainbow tables\\brute force method to crack the ""handshake"", which can take longer depending on your computation resouces, but at the time I believe AMD gpus handled this really really well, and I was able to crack it in less then 24 hours."
todayilearned,fdqomq5,t3_emryby,1578671535.0,"I have actually done this before... I bought a house that the cable company said they would hook up to the cable at the road for free. Once I was moved in and the cable guy came out they wanted $2000 to hook me up, the house was 500ft from the road. So instead I picked up a WiFi parabolic dish and cracked all my neighbor’s wifi, then patched/updated all their routers, manually set their channels so they were not stepping on each other, set their channel width to 20mhz to also limit interference, and configured QoS if the router had the power to use it correctly. I eventually ran cable to the road myself and got my own connection.

One neighbor royally pissed me off once, so I printed out some weird porn on his network printer for him and his wife, he didn’t have kids.

Edit: For those questioning the validity of this, I used a combination of Reaver\WPS exploits and rainbow tables, depending on what attacks the routers were susceptible to. For both attacks I had to use a wifi adapter that could be placed in ""promiscuous"" mode to capture the traffic needed to preform them. Maybe someone could confirm that I have at least a slight idea on what I am talking about."
Amd,fdpg0xp,t1_fdoqnv4,1578627664.0,Same on the Vega 64 and I don't see any hope of that getting resolved. Its seems like it has been that way for years.
Amd,fdpfw6g,t1_fdp9f2n,1578627567.0,"I am still on a 19.X revision as well, everything I have heard about 2020 is a horror story. Hopefully we will hear good news soon. GamersNexus apparently had a chat with AMD about their video drivers as CES, and AMD admitted they are problematic right now and are a priority to fix."
pics,fd3moxz,t3_ejytsm,1578159806.0,"Interesting fact about forest fires, prevention makes them much worse when they do happen, since the undergrowth builds up the fires burn much worse and destroy the entire forest instead of just cleaning up the undergrowth."

buildapcsales,fav4rcp,t3_e9lbtr,1576355667.0,"I picked one of these up as my new games drive, replacing a 256gb NVME + 1TB Sata SSD in MiStore. From the reviews it is slightly behind, but close to a SX8200 in performance, lowest I have seen a SX8200 2tb on sale though is about $230."
