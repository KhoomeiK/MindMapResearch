Embroidery,fd4uu10,t3_ek2b4p,1578171266.0,Found this design on Etsy and loved it- modified it for hubby‚Äôs office- [Etsy link](https://etsy.me/2HZO7a9)

sewing,fciomij,t1_fccj37n,1577666208.0,"The white furry material was a pain, because both sides were furry and it shed quite a bit. But the blue fabric, while it shed a little also, had a flat side and a furry side, so it was a lot easier to work with. If I made stuffies again, I would definitely look for minky fabric with one flat side!"

omad,fc5nb0y,t1_fc5ltfq,1577461995.0,I think you‚Äôre right- reframing limiting beliefs is always the key! So much is mental!

TrueOffMyChest,fc202za,t3_efecwm,1577335261.0,"Remember that people only post their highlight reels on social media.  Their lives might look perfect in pictures, but everyone is struggling with something. Keep your chin up and focus on your munchkin! Everyone is on a different path and at their own pace‚ù§Ô∏è"
TrueOffMyChest,fc1xwn8,t3_eflfps,1577333148.0,"This will probably get downvoted, and I am not a therapist- but you sound depressed. I have chronic depression, and I have to work really hard to stay out of that head space, so I get it- at least a little. I know everyone‚Äôs situation is different. But these people telling you to isolate yourself more? That isn‚Äôt going to help. If you want to feel better, reach out. Talk to someone you trust. Find a therapist. Find an activity that brings you joy. Talk to your doctor. Sometimes it‚Äôs a chemical imbalance that is easily fixed! Anyway- I just wanted to say- you don‚Äôt have to do it alone. And you are worth feeling better. We all are. Merry Christmas‚ù§Ô∏è"
HumansBeingBros,fb42sxp,t3_eb0nsw,1576500094.0,"It did come across as a little condescending (and I was also a little cranky and hungover!), but I also appreciate the gesture. It‚Äôs good for humans to look out for other humans, even if they don‚Äôt know them. We need more of that in the world. Much love to you all!"
