That's not an assumption, that's me reading the news. What is an assumption is that that's what's happening now, but because we have all this evidence supporting the assumption, it is not just emotional or biased or whatever other stupid thing you're trying to claim.

Democratic politicians, OTOH, hold a huge range of nuanced positions on every conceivable issue. In essence, the only thing you know for sure about a candidate with a D next to their name is that they *aren't a Republican*. In any sane universe, a country's entire breadth of mainstream political discourse would be within the bounds of the current Democratic party. Joe Manchin on the right, AOC on the left, and every reasonable view you care to name somewhere between those two. Instead, we have racists, zealots, and oligarchs that have managed to convince everyone that they are a legitimate political party, and not a bunch of fringe lunatics."

Your one good point is my biggest complaint with Yang's proposed implementation - it should not be a this or that choice between social assistance programs and a government stipend. That blatantly favors people who don't need social assistance in the first place, and is dumb."
