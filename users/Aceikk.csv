Not a Swede (I'm from Slovakia), but the process was similar to what those nice Swedes said.

So to answer your question, yes there were a lot of them in my school. 

Which personally I found pretty sad that after 5 years of learning English in elementary they would not understand simple questions or    
assignments.

Hope I gave some insight :)"

Overall feedback on my Moira was good so I Think you just have to play it smart and know when you really have to heal your team, etc. other healer is dead.

Also only played Moira in combo with ""all in"" healers never with another supp-like undecisive hero.

Was a long time ago tho :D"
