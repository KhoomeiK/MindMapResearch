SyrianRebels,ff7pjf4,t1_ff7o68y,1579655218.0,Yeah or just maybe they held their position and other rebels sent reinforcements to get them. No use staying in that area with the threat gone and the regime close.

islam,ff3z80q,t1_ff3wnio,1579552082.0,"It is more complicated then that. Saudi Arabia is aiding the internationally recognized UN government against the Houthis. The Houthis are violent criminals the place land minds wherever they go and they are not shy to attack civilian infrastructure. The Saudis have killed far less then China or even Zionism and American Imperialism that is not to say what they are doing is acceptable. To say they are no longer following Islam would be takfiri. This is actually a huge sin in Islam. As for ""instigating war with Iran"" no it is actually the opposite Iranian backed Houthi forces are attacking Saudi Arabia with the blessing from Iran they literally have a military alliance. So it's the other way around. Saudis follow their own distinct version of Islam but it is still Islam unlike China which doesn't even have any religion."
