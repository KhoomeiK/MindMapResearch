ScottishPeopleTwitter,feov3bu,t1_feou6rw,1579306067.0,"My native language is not Scottish English, it's American English. Same way you would have trouble understanding someone from the deep south. I personally had no trouble understanding the tweet, but it is stupid to suggest that everyone who speaks American English should understand it completely properly. 'oan' and 'burd' and 'needsty' and 'wi' are not words here."

NoStupidQuestions,fecvnlk,t1_fecvlgu,1578986433.0,I didn't understand what you meant at first but now I get it. You mean the alcohol equivalent would be drinking like 30 O'douls beers to get drunk. A fairly apt comparison.
NoStupidQuestions,fecvcgb,t1_fecv9jv,1578986088.0,The idea is to make you high not drunk! And 22mg of thc is a fair amount with little tolerence
NoStupidQuestions,fecvb33,t1_fecv7p7,1578986045.0,That's interesting! I've actually heard the opposite. My brother says he takes some cbd products when he smokes because it gives him a better body high. I could not reproduce that and had my doubts. You're probably right though
