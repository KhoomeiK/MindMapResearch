dogs,fegnbh8,t1_fegmjtu,1579097883.0,That’s really sad. Just for whining?
dogs,fegn994,t1_fegktkx,1579097837.0,That’s a lot of dogs. I’m trying to work out the logistics of a 2 year old lab and a 12 week old lab. I think the 2 year old is going to have to go back to training.
dogs,fef7icw,t1_feew4y1,1579050015.0,That’s horrible
dogs,fef73n3,t1_fef2xmp,1579049739.0,He broke out in a rash and the doctor said that because of that and how young he was he was at risk to have breathing problems.
dogs,fef6zmi,t1_fef6hoo,1579049665.0,My lab is a lap dog. But the puppy stage is something else.
dogs,fef6wvk,t3_eomrod,1579049614.0,I agree. I wish other people did more research like you. And just used common sense in some cases.
dogs,feebtu6,t1_feebl7h,1579030533.0,Chill.
dogs,feebrne,t1_feebhzv,1579030498.0,I’m sometimes nervous to walk my dog because of how often I see people’s dogs out. People are always posting on our city’s community FB that their dogs are out or that they found a dog running loose. I mean I know accidents happen. But it happens so often I don’t get what people are doing.
dogs,feeb5i2,t1_feeamrn,1579030138.0,"No. Barks chaotically if someone she doesn’t know comes to the front door. But never towards another dog. From 6 weeks to 8 months she lived with an older beagle when I lived with my parents. From 4 ish months to 8 months we had my lab, the beagle and a golden doodle in the same house until I moved."
dogs,fee9tbh,t1_fee9jga,1579029355.0,It was. The stepson isn’t with them 100% of the time so she thought she could get away with it. I also don’t think she did enough research into the whole “hypoallergenic” thing.
dogs,fee6m35,t1_fee0e7z,1579027472.0,Ughhh.
dogs,fee6g60,t1_fee13a2,1579027376.0,Haha so true
dogs,fee61co,t1_fee3kmy,1579027133.0,No. But she was aware her stepson already had dog allergies. Her one year old having allergies added to it. But why try to get a dog if you know one of the kids is already allergic?
dogs,fee5we5,t1_fee43th,1579027049.0,She knew her stepson had allergies when she got the dog. Didn’t know her son did too. But already had one kid with dog allergies. Why TRY to get one?
dogs,fedy0ip,t1_fedxjwo,1579022280.0,"Well, given that the wife kept saying no to a puppy/dog  and gave in to only make her husband happy, I’d say she knew she wasn’t dog people."
dogs,fedwvye,t1_fedwhjc,1579021601.0,Labs are pretty social and they’re both labs so I’m hoping that matter a lot.
dogs,fedv5in,t1_feduw41,1579020562.0,"Yes. The lab puppy we took in can’t go back to the breeder. The breeder said they would take her back up to 3 months old. Well, they waited a few too many days to decide they weren’t puppy people and the breeder won’t take her since she surpassed that 3 month mark."
dogs,fedtqx8,t1_fedtoag,1579019707.0,Ugh. I hope it went to a good home.
dogs,fedrrhk,t1_fedrjdq,1579018488.0,Haha.  A sweater for a husky! They come with their own sweaters.
dogs,fedro0h,t1_fedrif5,1579018429.0,Ours plays with the puppy but they are so noisy it sounds like a vicious fight but it’s just a lot of grunting. Our two year old lab is the smaller dog of all the other dogs she’s been around other than my moms beagle.
dogs,fedrgjn,t1_fedqvbf,1579018300.0,I had one growing up. We were kids when we first got him and he used to retrieve my brother by his shoe and drag him to the house.
dogs,fedqojp,t1_fedqa1t,1579017811.0,Yep. Labs are super mouthy. They retrieve everything.
JUSTNOMIL,fddt6z8,t1_fddt1x4,1578323353.0,Thanks I didn’t know there was a sub for that.
funny,fd053m3,t1_fd03rrp,1578113755.0,Nope.
funny,fd01m2m,t1_fd00wdw,1578112289.0,Post a meme about it.

Parenting,fcovfda,t3_ei3tit,1577842645.0,I think co-sleeping is a horrible habit to start. Never did it and I’m so glad. I have friends who almost 7 year old still spends more time in their bed.
Parenting,fcou8yb,t3_ei81sc,1577841713.0,That’s life and you can’t avoid it. So no.
aww,fcogpgt,t3_ei5b6c,1577831808.0,Should have let her name her own dog

askscience,fcjvwsc,t3_ehgdqr,1577707319.0,My ex rolled his car once. His face pretty much slid against the payment at one point. It healed. But it almost looked like he had permanent bruising under his skin in some spots. I was apparently just dirt that wasn’t cleaned out. Not sure how he didn’t get an infection.
BadMUAs,fcg4joy,t3_eh388i,1577636402.0,She’s targeted her inner Kim Mathers.
JUSTNOMIL,fcflngz,t3_eh5xy3,1577631389.0,Delete and block them.
Parenting,fcbkz7k,t3_egxed6,1577588081.0,"I feel you. I can’t stand kids crap in every room of the house. We have a ranch style house with 3 bedrooms. 1 for the kid, our bedroom, and an office. We have to have an office because we both have jobs that require us to do work from home at times. So, we don’t have an additional room for a playroom. The people who owned the house before us turn the basement into a garage so we don’t have that as an option either. 

She can bring toys and whatever out of her room during the day. But they have to be put away at night. They do not get stored in common areas of the house. We have friends who let their kids shit take over their house and I don’t understand how they can handle it."
Botchedsurgeries,fc70ir8,t3_egiutq,1577494284.0,She’s also a heroin addict (supposedly sober). Makes me wonder if they died because she wasn’t paying attention to them while she was using.
self,fc1v336,t3_eflyxl,1577330634.0,"Good for you. I was told by my mother in law that it was a requirement to buy any new babies in the family a gift and give it during the big Christmas Eve party. The only new baby this year belong to my husband entitled cousin. She had a laundry list of wishes for her 8 month old including monetary contributions for swim classes for the baby. Yeah, I bought the noisiest toy I could find for $20 and gave it to her with no gift receipt.

EDIT: Wow, thanks for the gold award!"
self,fbxtghs,t3_ef2865,1577200057.0,Leave.
JUSTNOMIL,fbxsdw1,t3_eexnch,1577199214.0,I’d leave this relationship. Just leave it. Walk away. PRESENCE DENIED.
Youniqueamua,fbww4n1,t3_eeu1tv,1577161037.0,Did she rub tobacco on her face? ‘Cause that’s how dirty it looks.
Parenting,fbwuje3,t1_fbwuehh,1577159811.0,"With the cold months and flu season, I am worried that it’ll start to get that way after last year."
Parenting,fbwu8kw,t1_fbwtwli,1577159583.0,So far this year she’s only missed 2. One for an ear infection. Second time was a cold that actually started with me. She was coughing really hard from it and we were getting a foot of snow that day so I took her to urgent care and kept her home.
Parenting,fbwtq84,t1_fbwthn7,1577159183.0,Ours only does the truancy warning if they’re I excused absences. She did 2 years of half day preschool before kindergarten and we didn’t have anything like last year.
Parenting,fbwsi95,t1_fbwrvwv,1577158262.0,"No she’s not. She literally just caught everything last year. I had doctors notes every time so they were all excused. With pink eye she couldn’t go back until her eyes were clear (school policy). She had that twice so that was like 4 days total there. 

Strep was a couple of days due to waiting until she was fever free and she was vomiting with strep. She had a major upper respiratory infection before Christmas that caused her to miss the entire week of school (5 days) before Christmas break. Her fever wouldn’t break and school policy is 24 hours fever free before returning. Then it went to pneumonia. 

She had stomach bugs a few times which were a couple days each time because they have to be 24 hours without vomiting to go back.

I addressed the issue with the school and they said kindergartners get sick a lot. Her teacher wasn’t concerned because she was doing fine in school and they were legitimate illnesses with doctors notes so no truancy."
Youniqueamua,fbvsy8d,t3_eenbd2,1577135620.0,Wtf. The brows. The teeth. Her face and neck don’t even match.
Showerthoughts,fbuc6m7,t1_fbu71g5,1577111796.0,"Probably. I don’t take it everyday. I could go months without having to take it. It’s either take it or everything spins, you can’t stand up, forget about driving and you’ll end up throwing up without it."
Showerthoughts,fbubyn0,t1_fbts0uz,1577111676.0,It really sucks when everything is spinning and you’re just trying not to fall over.
Showerthoughts,fbtqhvx,t1_fbtq004,1577090422.0,"I use Dramamine if I don’t have anti-vert. It’s pretty much the same thing and helps with the spinning sensation. Otherwise, try to stare at an objection that’s not moving to try and get my eyes to stop moving back and forth. I’ve woken up out of a dead sleep with everything spinning multiple times. Lots of ringing in the ears.  Basically just try to survive."
