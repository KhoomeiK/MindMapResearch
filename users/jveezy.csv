kings,ffdv716,t1_ffcyzqc,1579829740.0,"Yeah, I'm in the same boat. I'm not concerned about the money as much as the 6 hour/game time commitment for me to go from Vallejo to Sac and back. It's time I get to hang with one of my Sac friends, so I want to keep this going, but it's rough, and not just because of the losing."

AskEngineers,ff2doy4,t3_er3pfo,1579501931.0,"I don't see what's wrong with ""We all are in some way"", but normally I'd just say ""Thanks"". Just take the compliment. They're trying to be nice. It doesn't have to be a platform for your clever remarks. Let a pleasant exchange be a pleasant exchange.

If your point is that every job is impressive in its own way, then follow up by asking about their job and express how impressive you think their job is too."
kings,ff24wot,t1_ff0swl0,1579493899.0,"Yeah the kind of person who is enough of an asshole to go out of their way to hate on a player directly on social media is not the kind of person who is going to be swayed by an appeal like this. I'm sorry Marvin has to deal with that, but most of us are just whining here or in other places where it shouldn't affect him unless he intentionally comes here to read it."
kings,ff24asu,t1_ff1iky4,1579493419.0,"I think you guys are both right. Neither side is helping. One guy was too much of an idiot to give the other guy the players he wanted. The other guy was too much of a dick to move on even months after the decision was made and there was no going back. The relationship was only salvageable if either Joerger shut the fuck up and moved on or Vlade swallowed his pride and let Joerger get the barbs out of his system.

Personally I wouldn't want to hire someone who was a dick, but if I already had one on staff and they were doing a fairly good job, I wouldn't fire them until they've shown they've reached their limits. The whole point is on court performance, so who cares if that comes at the cost of my own bruised ego every time they want to take shots at me for one of my own mistakes? But I think the collapse at the end of the season was their excuse to say that Joerger wasn't really doing that good of a job. That combined with the lame-duck season the next year seemed to seal the deal. In hindsight a lame duck year of Joerger probably wouldn't have been any worse than this season has gone."
kings,ff1ucsb,t1_feyzc1q,1579486381.0,"You really don't think the Kings have a say in who their lead play-by-play broadcaster is? You could argue about who technically employs him, but if the Kings want him gone, he's gone. It's been obvious ever since he was pro-Maloof during the Anaheim relocation drama when he would've kept his job and pro-city during the Seattle relocation drama when he would've been replaced if the team moved.

I'm not saying the team writes his talking points, but he knows who butters his bread...or if you want to nitpick, who can influence whether his bread continues to get buttered or not. He's not especially awful for doing that. Plenty of people are biased towards their employers. You just have to keep that in mind every time he says something. And if he ever does turn on someone he previously stumped for, you know they're not gonna last long."

BetterEveryLoop,fej5o20,t1_fej5hbb,1579157898.0,That was just a tournament rule. Each night they do two games and combine the scores for both games at the end to determine the match winner. This was just the reset to start the second game.
nba,fecoob5,t1_fecogve,1578979289.0,I blame you for this.
internetparents,fdpmacp,t3_emgyxg,1578632643.0,"I just want to address a few misconceptions to reassure you that you're probably going to be fine.

1. You have until April 15th. Your employer doesn't even have to send you info about how much you made this year until the end of the month. So no need to panic yet. It's good that you're getting ahead of this though.
2. You already paid taxes. There's a decent chance you overpaid. This whole convoluted process is supposed to calculate whether you overpaid or underpaid and by how much, so you can either pay the remainder of what you owe or get reimbursed for the extra you paid. 
3. You can punch in some of the numbers from your last paystub of 2019 to get a ballpark estimate into any simple tax calculator online. [Here's one.](https://www.nerdwallet.com/taxes/tax-calculator) Compare it to what you did pay in federal taxes over the whole year, and you'll get pretty close to whatever Freetaxusa or TurboTax or H&R Block will calculate for you. Maybe exactly the same if your taxes are really simple. You can probably find a similar tool for your California taxes. Also [California lets you file your state taxes directly with them for free](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/ways-to-file/online/index.html)
4. If you do screw up, the difference will likely be small at your income. If you screw up in a way that pays them more, that sucks a little for you since you paid more than you need to, but the IRS certainly isn't gonna hound you for that. If you screw up in a way that pays them less than you should have, they'll send you a bill. Just pay it. Like a traffic ticket. And again, you already paid an estimated amount directly from your paycheck, so it's not like they got nothing from you at all. Whatever difference you might owe is not gonna be worth chasing you down for. You're certainly not going to jail.
5. If you're still feeling confused and overwhelmed, check with your school's Business/Accounting/Finance department. My college advertised free tax prep as a service the accounting students would perform."

AskEngineers,fcyekzq,t1_fcxg8af,1578078975.0,Also it's just helpful in general to use different line and/or marker types instead of just colors on charts in case someone wants to print something out or photocopy the charts in grayscale.
nba,fcmk9ou,t1_fcmc02e,1577778736.0,"We'd have the worst record in the west without him.

Statistically that might actually hold up. He's contributing 4 wins over a replacement player (per bbref) so losing that would put us below the Warriors."

nba,fcmjnxz,t1_fcmggh4,1577778002.0,"He's not, but it's hard to justify letting him play his way out of this slump when his replacement is playing so well and he turns the ball over so much when he's on the floor. If it was just a matter of missing open threes, it wouldn't be so frustrating."
AskReddit,fcjcih3,t1_fcj5138,1577683002.0,"I was at that moment about 7-8 years ago. A couple things helped:

* Looking at the transaction list and seeing how much of a problem it was (not to chastise or confront myself but merely to see how severe it was so I could come up with an appropriate plan). I was spending like $600/month on food for myself. I wanted to get to somewhere around $400. Entirely doable with some small changes.
* Eating more frozen foods from the supermarket. Cooking fresh foods would've been the most ideal option, but I knew I wasn't going to get there right away, so I started by replacing 1 or 2 meals a week with something I could microwave quickly at home or at work instead. Nothing super cheap but stuff in the $3-5 meal range. There's a lot of frozen or boxed foods you can find at the supermarket that are surprisingly good, and finding and trying those things became kinda fun too. At some point you realize that just grabbing something out of the freezer is even more convenient than having to stop by at whatever fast food place to and from work. 
* I drank water or when eating out or no drink at all if getting food to go. If you're gonna eat out a lot, at least save a buck or two every meal. Plus you'll be avoiding all the empty calories from soda. Saving $5/week is $260/year
* Once I scaled back to only eating out for 4-5 meals a week instead of 10, I had one of those meals be a nice one at a nice place. Nothing super expensive, but more like something from the local steak restaurant. That way there was still some variety and I didn't feel like this cutting back was too boring."
nba,fcja79t,t3_ehgj7j,1577681144.0,Imagine if Buddy had held on to that steal underneath the basket. We probably could've seen the Kings fuck up a final offensive play in a completely new way.

csharp,fc72k36,t1_fc6mf04,1577495832.0,Thank you for this clarification. I think part of my confusion was not realizing that implicitly-typed doesn't necessarily mean weakly-typed.
nbadiscussion,fc711ok,t1_fc4bfyf,1577494683.0,"Yeah, plus by nature these ""divisional"" games are going to be normal rivalry matchups within the division, so there's even less incentive to not take these games seriously. Hell, if people are really going to treat this tournament like it's meaningless, the group stage games will be the ones that are taken the most seriously, because they'll actually count for something besides the meaningless tournament."

nba,fc4ua85,t3_eg78p8,1577428684.0,"I've been a season ticket holder for the entire Vivek era, and I have to say that was the single dumbest game of basketball I've ever attended. 

This roster is too talented to play as stupidly as it does and not talented enough to play as arrogantly as it does. The basketball embodiment of being just good enough at something to be a danger to themselves and others. Nobody passes. Nobody moves. Everyone with the ball dribbles into traffic and stalls or jacking up off balanced shots at the worst times. Buddy and Bogi have James Harden confidence with only half the skill and talent. Our coaches seem to be okay with this enough to not clue them in on how badly they're wreckin shit. Richaun Holmes is the only one with consistent effort and production and they're scaling him back to squeeze Bagley back in.

The Kings deserve three Ls tonight. One for the effort, one for the arrogance, and one for the idiocy. The dumbest people of all are people like me who continue to pay for this bullshit year in and year out."
nba,fbzyszd,t1_fbzqqes,1577269153.0,"I'm not saying any sport does, but I'm saying they all should. It doesn't have to even be relevant. Just short tidbits about general knowledge scattered over many broadcasts. You can demand people take initiative or you can help people take initiative. A little nudge every once in a while isn't as cumbersome as you make it sound."
nba,fbzqb5v,t1_fbzbrit,1577256221.0,"I get what you're saying, but I feel like when they go over stuff on those shows, it's more focused on why one team is outplaying another. It's not basic fundamentals. It's nuanced adjustments that outsmart existing strategies that new and inexperienced viewers don't understand in the first place.

New viewers need explainer segments on what the fuck is a zone defense or what is a pick and roll or what is a triangle offense. Nothing super long, just 30 sec to 1 minute or so. The length of a GI Joe PSA. They can throw it in when they come back from commercial or during a review or timeout that doesn't cut to commercial."
