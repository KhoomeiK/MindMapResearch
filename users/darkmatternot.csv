The 55 and over rule is pretty common in retirement communities, even those without HOA's.  You agree to it when you purchase or sign a lease.  In this situation it does suck, but I get why they are enforcing it.  Nobody wants kids living there. That's why they choose a retirement community.  If they allow it, then you have to allow it for everyone.  It is sad for this poor kid."
