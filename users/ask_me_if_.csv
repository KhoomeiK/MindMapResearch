AskReddit,fet58ps,t1_feo2zl1,1579371922.0,Oh noo lmao. That honestly sounds so frustrating
AskReddit,fel7mz7,t1_feijl3g,1579215810.0,"Awesome, I'm super happy! I get my terpenes from trueterpenes.com if you want some limonene on hand! It's one of the cheaper ones at like $15 for what feels like an unlimited supply (1 or 2 drops in a mL of cannabis oil)"
AskReddit,fei75io,t1_feetj4e,1579131784.0,"It should! Usually when an extract is full spectrum, it's the full spectrum of terpenes from a specific strain though. Depending on what you are medicating for, it could possibly not have what you need in it. I personally always need anti-anxiety / anti-depressant terpenes, so I never grab anything without limonene or linalool in it. I don't know how well any of it is labeled outside of dispensaries though, not that it's always labeled super well at dispensaries.

But yeah, ""full spectrum"" I believe refers to the fact there is no terpene loss during the extraction process, like there would be with most methods of extraction. So super good medicine in one way or another."
AskReddit,feesqbd,t1_fedkwnv,1579040402.0,"It's possible! An important thing that a lot of people don't know is that it needs to bind to terpenes to produce certain effects, so if you have pure CBD isolate, it's possible you need to mix in [terpene isolate](terpene.info) to gain the full effects.

Theoretically, some essential oils in a diffuser near you will work as well, if you've already done some CBD (or THC) isolate."
AskReddit,fedy6pc,t1_fcjor2b,1579022382.0,It does absorb everything into your bloodstream though. That's partly why it's porous.
AskReddit,fecpj9i,t1_fbm5e4w,1578980031.0,Not in grain alcohol you buy with other drinks
AskReddit,fec29l4,t1_fbptgu6,1578965602.0,You'd probably find that cbd counteracts that well and makes you feel calm/mellow.
AskReddit,febzn37,t1_fb8z0i1,1578964634.0,That is so freakin sweet of you to do that
mildlyinteresting,fe7wszh,t1_fe72osn,1578920003.0,"It's not dumb. I can totally see why someone would think that. Especially since it's inconsequential information that you don't really think about often, and you might've heard it somewhere."
mildlyinteresting,fe7vume,t1_fe70d90,1578919776.0,Aw that was harsh
mildlyinteresting,fe7vpue,t1_fe7qc7y,1578919724.0,"YES dude I thought the same thing! Literally until this thread, I had no idea they actually make your eyes physically water somehow."

nathanwpyle,fdr9qcu,t1_fc4im2g,1578681482.0,I was waiting for someone to mention this!
nathanwpyle,fdr9o5h,t1_fctnhlw,1578681446.0,"Huh that's an interesting thought. But also, ""twelve"" has the beginning of ""two"" in it, so I could believe looking at ""zwo"" (zwei) and ""zw√∂lf"", that maybe there is something we're missing there."
YouShouldKnow,fdqlre7,t1_fdpmwr7,1578669698.0,"Yeah for sure! I value empathy over all else now, but to a kid that doesn't care what the swastika means, the fact that it's such a huge deal to some people, makes the joke equally as huge.

For real, it bums me out that you can't just say, ""Hey this is bad and not funny."" Without getting, ""Lighten up. It's hilarious."""
YouShouldKnow,fdpkllh,t1_fdnkh9s,1578631212.0,"Well in my case, I had a somewhat traumatic childhood, so I might not have been empathetic enough to understand. There was no one around us that was effected by it, either. We were just always able to make each other laugh by being shocking and random. One particular friend was more into that humor, probably also had a traumatic childhood on some level, and also influenced me to behave more like that.

Can't say it's the same for everyone though. I know some kids just love edgy humor. It's easy to detach from it at that age."
YouShouldKnow,fdn9w9m,t1_fdm25sk,1578581121.0,Wow is that why they say to sniff them to get high? Alcohol poisoning!?
YouShouldKnow,fdn9b0i,t1_fdmy1bp,1578580705.0,"I think most high schoolers know about and have seen footage of Buchenwald and Auschwitz by that point.  The swastika is usually funny because it's so shocking and bad. Like knowing the history behind it ups the edginess of the joke of drawing a swastika.

I could be wrong though, but that's been my experience when I was a kid and used to think hate speech was hilarious."

mildlyinteresting,fcxmaje,t1_fcx7pce,1578066349.0,"Never have I seen one in the US with one. It makes sense they'd have them in Germany, from what I understand about their value of privacy and more cash-centric spending preferences"
mildlyinteresting,fcxacfa,t1_fcwngvk,1578057240.0,Huh I never knew that! Does that mean the cartoon Gargoyles was scientifically inaccurate??
mildlyinteresting,fcx5xhf,t1_fcvsawg,1578052583.0,LOL. Though it's funny you'd call that poorly made. That was like the best case scenario for me back in the day.
AskReddit,fcf3vww,t1_fcd8dz1,1577626346.0,That was very moving
mildlyinteresting,fc8izi3,t1_fc7n6xb,1577535936.0,That's beautiful. Sometimes coincidences are meant to happen. That was for you.
