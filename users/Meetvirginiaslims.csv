nova,fcyxsn4,t1_fcynosh,1578089435.0,"Holding the persons clearance is different from giving that person access. When you onboard someone into JPAS, you ‚Äúown‚Äù their clearance. Then, there is a separate section/step where you choose the level of access/clearance the individual is required to have. 

IE: if you have a top secret eligibility, but the contract you‚Äôre on is only secret, then we would only give you secret access. Same goes for uncleared contracts. We would own your clearance but just not give you access to anything. This way, your clearance status is maintained and the taxpayer isn‚Äôt paying for you to get your clearance AGAIN just because Sarah/Justin in HR didn‚Äôt read the NISPOM. 

It‚Äôs....idiotic to not hold a clearance for someone you employ even if they don‚Äôt require a clearance for their current contract, because you might need that person for a cleared contract in the future. It also helps with clearance numbers for proposals. It‚Äôs legal as long as you don‚Äôt give anyone access that they don‚Äôt require for their work."

Companies favor people who are already cleared because it takes about 8 months to a year to get a clearance. And that‚Äôs if nothing is wrong. No one wants to wait around for that."
