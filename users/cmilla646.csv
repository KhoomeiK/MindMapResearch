The day we can walk around with light head set and an all day battery is the day I’ll have to reevaluate my life."

I know both my nephews weren’t planned and neither the husband or wife really wanted kids bit here we are. Out of common decency people usually don’t ask these questions. But at least in west, I wouldn’t be shocked if anywhere from 10 to 25% of pregnancies were not planned out.

Personally I would judge a grown up who had 2 kids by accident more than I would a teenager who wanted to abort just one."

TwoXChromosomes,fduz3pt,t1_fdt6mkg,1578741198.0,"The only reason I have ever remotely wanted children was to give my life focus which is a selfish reason. But as far as I can tell everyone has children for more
or less selfish reasons. It seems to be that the goal of a parent should be for there child to be the best version of themselves, or to at least be better than they are. And it seems to me that most people don’t have kids for that reason. 

Also, I suppose the millions of parents out there who had children by mistake are more mature than people like myself?"

gadgets,fd9fi9s,t1_fd8yp7f,1578232606.0,"It's so stupid that we are going to essentially HAVE to pay for a feature most people don't need, and even fewer actually appreciate. I use to hang TVs at my old job and it almost felt like people were brainwashed by the marketing of slim bezels, 4k, hidden wires, etc. We'd program smart remotes with their systems, and the whole thing would end up becoming so expensive and difficult to use that if your remote fucked up on Friday night then you were shit out of luck until Monday. 

Even with people where money was not an issue, I was tempted to tell them that less is more and while my boss will make less money you and I will live happier if you just leave that TV on the stand. Instead we'd end up hanging a curved TV on a wall which looks stupid in 99% of applications and have to explain to them that YES you can see the wires on the back of TV because it curves away from the fucking. They'd get a $5-10k setup when all they really needed was a $1000 TV and a $500 sound bar and sub.

I'm pretty sure they have already proven that for most applications, can't even tell 1080p from 4k, never mind 4-8. Did 4k content even really ever take off? How long until 8k content that most people won't have good enough internet to stream anyway?"

funny,fcn8g70,t1_fcl5x04,1577805967.0,"I could see technology accommodating things like this once society is ready for it. I have heard of parties where a red bracelet means single/interested and green means taken/not interested or something like that. I could picture something like existing in day to day life one day with something like Google glass. A lot of the fun of interacting with people is the mystery of figuring them out, but not all of us want to do that dance or play that game. Some of us want or even need a big fucking sign hanging over our heads or someone else’s that say “Shy but I am easy to talk to and dtf if that’s all you’re looking for.” 

I am actually not much of a hugger but I know how much they can help and if someone walked up to me crying and asked for one I’d be more than happy to give them one."
funny,fcmwfbb,t3_ei11es,1577795350.0,"I think one of the new focuses on mathematics is teaching children multiple ways of answering this type of question, or rather that there is no wrong way of
getting there as long as it logical. I know 6x6 is 36 because it is drilled into my head at this point, but if I was drunk and tired and someone asked what 6x6 is I might actually think “Well 6x5 is 30. I’m sober enough to know that, so now I just add 6.” It required more steps, but I used logic to get there."
