Toastmasters,fekds48,t1_faqx85f,1579197934.0,And that's why I've decided to just fill other roles and to hell with giving speeches. That and Bill Gates couldn't navigate the Pathways website.  I just want to feel more comfortable with public speaking--I'm not the least bit interested in becoming a leader.
winstonsalem,fekanfc,t3_eo42dx,1579196081.0,"What are the housing costs in the WS area? My husband and I would like to move to this area from the DC area. Surely the overall cost of living is much cheaper. Hell, anything would be an improvement! It's just the two of us plus one dog and four cats. We don't need a huge house or yard and we sure as hell don't want an HOA. We're an old married couple--I'm in my mid-50s, my husband is in his mid-60s and disabled. And the possibility of moving scares the daylights out of me!"
cats,feha3gg,t3_ep4fnb,1579112301.0,I have two black cats myself.  There's no going back once you've gone black cat!
funny,feh9pm2,t1_feeob7k,1579112068.0,Hey! The DC area resembles that remark!!
funny,feh9dzz,t3_eoph1v,1579111872.0,"But **its** traffic signs....

It's=it is.

That sign needs to posted all over the DC area. Not that anybody would pay attention to though."
dogs,feh8nh5,t3_ep0gdj,1579111427.0,"A few years ago, the ASPCA created something called Meet Your Match. It's a questionnaire that helps you look for a compatible breed/size.  There are no right/wrong answers.  I will tell you this: working breeds need to have something to do and they have tons of energy; based on the information you provided, a working breed would not work for you.

subaruoutback,feh38nj,t3_em25le,1579108227.0,"Lesbian mom car. Whatever. I'm neither a lesbian nor a mother and I wouldn't have any other car. My '08 has about 170k miles on it (bought it used in '09) and still runs. It's taken my husband to Florida and back four times, me to work and has hauled just about everything from soup to nuts. Most importantly, it's paid for.  Extreme stuff? I'm too boring for that."
subaruoutback,feh2qbq,t3_eng1vx,1579107919.0,Good lucking car.

fuckthesepeople,feh0uzo,t1_feg2k1e,1579106792.0,"What I find amusing are the Boomers (not all of course) who slept in the dirt and eschewed materialism in their younger hippie days now have more than a passing acquaintance with soap and water, and want gaudy looking cracker boxes that somehow pass as houses . Talk about an attitude adjustment! Yes, people's attitudes change, but damn! One extreme to the other."

news,feh05cp,t3_eow82n,1579106361.0,"My husband and I are old enough to move into one of those gulags, but who wants to be around a bunch of get-off-my-lawn types? My attitude is that the day you start paying my property taxes, insurance, etc.  is the day  you can tell me what I can and cannot do on property that I bought and paid for. OK, I can't be running a whore house, but I'm going to damn well have a clothesline in my yard and if you don't like it, that's just too bad.

What I find amusing is the complaints from subdivision residents in this about the lack of snow crews in their areas after a storm. What, you're paying a monthly tax to a quasi-governmental agency whose services take the place of the county services and all of a sudden your want the county to do something? Cry me a river. If we ever move, the first thing we're going to tell a realtor is NO PLANNED COMMUNITIES/HOAs! Not that I have strong opinions on them or anything."
