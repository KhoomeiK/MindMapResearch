mentalhealth,fcjnt6p,t1_fcjnmpv,1577695686.0,"Yeah; that was me. It’s fine, I accept your apology.

You shouldn’t feel like that, no one’s ever fully incompatible with society. I’m autistic so I get a feeling of never fitting in properly. I don’t blame you for finding it frustrating though, but you should try and think about how others might feel when they don’t fit in rather than writing something mean.

A message sent to someone at a bad time could really hurt them. Even earlier... when I first saw your message I felt really awful and I nearly fell back into a panic spiral, but I was lucky enough to have calmed down to a point where I could cope with it.

You should try and find a better way of expressing your frustrations. I think maybe speak to a professional about not fitting in, since most of the behaviour I’ve seen from you makes me feel like you might be autistic too."
mentalhealth,fcjnfm3,t1_fcjnbtb,1577695157.0,"It’s fine. I know there’s something really bad bothering you at the moment and that’s why you’re having to release your negative thoughts with bullying.

I’m glad you're sorry for saying what you said though. You need to think about who you’re being mean too though as if you’d commented earlier when I was still in my panic attack I might’ve handled things much worse and you could’ve made me fall deeper into my anxiety. Something small can have a big impact on a vulnerable person, or anyone if they’re in a bad enough situation."
mentalhealth,fcjnays,t3_ehcgsm,1577694983.0,"I like lying down and listening to sad music. If I’m feeling too depressed to be happy, then sadness is generally easier to achieve, while also being preferable to the lowness and emptiness I tend to feel while depressed. But then I end up thinking about a lot of things I don’t want to have to worry about, so I haven’t been able to rely on it much.

Recently, I’ve found myself doing more stuff with my siblings, since they are close to me and friendly. Sometimes being with someone close can make me feel happy even during a deep depressive episode."

What kind of negative thoughts are making you so angry and aggressive? I’m sure there’s a way of better expressing them rather than being mean to others."
mentalhealth,fcjn330,t3_ehfpnq,1577694686.0,"That is honestly horrible. I feel so bad for you. What kind of monster would go and do that to you?

You’re really amazing for being strong enough to post everything, and I’m really sorry someone did that to you.

You can tell me in a reddit chat if you want, and I’ll believe you. I know exactly how spending hours crying and spiralling can feel as I suffer with that a lot, although probably not as badly as you. You sound like you’ve been through a lot."
mentalhealth,fcjmtk2,t3_ehj8qe,1577694318.0,"To be honest, I can see why you hate yourself so much. Looking through your post history, you’re a bully and really not a nice person. I have a similar issue, hating myself constantly, except for me it’s different since I have much less to hate and most of the things I dislike about myself other people do like.

Even if you really are a bully though, that doesn’t mean you should have to feel depressed. There will still be people who care about you. I’m just not one of them. But I know what depression feels like and I wish you luck getting through it."

I was just... it’s hard to explain until you’ve actually had a panic attack but you don’t really think normally. You get stuck with these ideas infinitely looping in your head and it’s hard to think of anything other than them. I was just trying to put my thoughts into words.

I’m sorry I offended you so much."

I’m really glad there’s nothing wrong with still caring about him... it felt weird at first because I still care about him a lot, but if it’s normal I don’t feel so unusual now. I’m too scared to talk to him yet... but I might look and see if he’s okay in a few days.

I’ll try and keep myself safer from now on. Thank you again for all the assistance you’re giving me, it’s really helping."

I still feel so bad for him now... even if he was being unreasonable... but I’m too scared to even look at me and his messages because I know I’ll have another panic attack if I do. Even if he was being abusive, I can’t help but hope he’s okay."

It’s fine, the anxiety is one of the few conditions I’ve had for years and I’m generally better at dealing with. But then again, it’s been seriously bad these last few months. I’ll try and take care now, thank you!"

We met online after he saw me posting about a depressive episode I was going through on another forum, and he helped me a lot back then. But then we became friends... and then he fell in love... and now I feel so anxious when I even think about how I don’t know what to do.

That’s why I had to break friends with him. It’s my fault. If I hadn’t told anyone about my problems he never would’ve met me. And I never would’ve become his friend. And then he wouldn’t have fallen in love. I caused this. I ruined everything because I couldn’t keep holding in all my thoughts and had to tell someone. If I was stronger and didn’t talk to him, I never would’ve hurt him like this.

I know there’s something wrong with me and I need to talk to a professional... but I can’t let my family find out how horrible my mental health is right now. If I got a therapist, they’d find out.

At 1000kcal you should be feeling ill and weak, that’s now bad it for you it is.)

I was always worried about people and what they thought of me, but no one ever has any interest in me and just ignores me. It’ll be the same for you, especially as you aren’t actually anywhere near as bad as you look.

I’m also going to try and eat generally more healthy food but I already have the most varied and balanced diet out of anyone in my family so I expect that’ll be fine.

And I agree my family situation sucks. I should be able to dictate my own food but I also live with my mum who treats me like a child. Even now I think she gets scared when I cross the road...

Getting them to do the same research isn’t really an option since if anyone of them knew what I’m doing to lose weight they wouldn’t support me and would probably just start making sure I eat all the meals they want me to eat. It’s only because they’re so lax that I’m able to get away with losing weight at all."
diet,fc6i3f0,t1_fc6dg6m,1577481100.0,"Her diet sounds pretty nice, but I can achieve lower calorie counts the way I’m doing things. I’ve been feeling less hungry as I’ve got better used to dieting again though, so that’s not so much of a problem.

I don’t blame you for thinking that, if I lived on my own I could just eat smaller meals. But it’s not really easy with current situation. Cutting out meals works for me though.

It’s not really much of a plan, I just eat as little as I can whenever I can. I’m not really happy with it, but only because my family keep feeding me and I can’t always find excuses to get out of the food they cook. I hope it works out to but to be honest I’m starting to wonder if I’ve developed an ED and just claim I’m doing a diet to avoid facing my problems... since several people have suggested that, and I can see their points."

You aren’t doing anything wrong, you are just doing what you need to survive. It’s not your fault that you can’t get enough money, it’s the governments.

Don’t be so hard on yourself."
EatingDisorders,fc5dswh,t3_eg9ljx,1577454559.0,"It could possibly be BED, but it seems more likely to me that you just need to work on controlling your diet more and learning about portions. You should probably just try and eat healthier and drink more, and definitely go to the doctors about the hypoglycaemia, but if you really are worried about your overeating you could see a professional about that."
EatingDisorders,fc5d5e8,t3_eg9lg0,1577453930.0,Definitely. Try and speak to a professional about these behaviours.

I tried to work through it though and it worked, but it doesn’t always work and some days I get really down because of it."

The only problem is even when focusing on the choices I’m making now it’s not easy to make good choices because of my family. I can sometimes avoid eating extra stuff, but they keep making me eat... and it’s not like I can just tell them I don’t want to either."

EatingDisorders,fc4gv52,t3_eg4tp7,1577416280.0,"It definitely sounds like you are dealing some form of EDNOS or AN+BED. Your anxiety is likely making it harder to deal with since you probably feel worried about whether you are doing the right thing by trying to stop.

You’ve got a lot of ED symptoms that you should probably talk to a therapist/professional about. Especially the fact that you enjoy losing weight at a high speed, are eating really dangerously little, and very importantly the fact that you feel really bad and see yourself as gross when you try and eat more.

(Offtopic: I find this really relatable for some reason, even down to losing and gaining weight at the same time. That’s so weird. I really shouldn’t relate this much. I don’t know why I felt like adding this but I did.)"
EatingDisorders,fc4gb1v,t3_efqc15,1577415819.0,"It definitely sounds like an ED to me. Not only do you have a lot of symptoms of an ED, but the way you say it feels like a switch has been flipped in your brain, that definitely indicates something is starting.

Luckily you’ve managed to catch it early and can try and stop it before it gets too serious. If you can, try and speak to a therapist or other professional."
diet,fc4g1kf,t1_fc4ft3l,1577415600.0,"Sorry, it’s just a weird saying I’ve developed since my friends used it all the time. I just meant it must like saying I could see why you’d want to do that.

Whatever you like’s probably fine, although healthier options are generally better, but if you aren’t worried about your weight there’s nothing wrong with a few sweets, especially considering it’s Christmas."
EatingDisorders,fc4fomr,t3_eg2g16,1577415305.0,"It certainly sounds like you are developing an eating disorder to me. Replacing meals with gum and water and ignoring all the negatives of starving are definitely ED symptoms. (hypocritical as it sounds, coming from me.)

Having to cut and hem size 11 jeans makes it seem like you’ve been doing this for a while and it’s probably already developed into one by now, you just haven’t realised yet.

I think your friend is really worried about you, hence her trying to make you stop by threatening to do something you don’t want.

You should definitely work on trying to stop your disordered behaviours. But I’d do research into ED charities near you, like BEAT in the UK, and professionals near you, since trying to beat it by yourself isn’t easy and might not work. Ask your friend for advice, as she’ll have experience in trying to beat an ED, but be careful not to trigger her disorder. I’d also look into a therapist since they can be very helpful."

Also, the exhaustion is awful. Trust me, I know from experience, as I’m doing a generally low-everything diet right now to lose a lot of weight fast, and it really does feel awful."

SuicideWatch,fc4dops,t1_fc4cdxy,1577413664.0,"That’s good! You’ve found some happy memories at least. I have a lot of bad ones too, especially from 2019 and 2016, but as long as there’s some good it’s okay to me.

I don’t know to be honest if anyone is truly happy. I used to be a really happy person, but the last 6 years have kind of taken that away from me. Maybe it’s just part of growing up, as it was as I got older that my life started to fall apart, the foundations of everything that made me happy and forget all the bad stuff got eroded and finally collapsed this year.

I’ve definitely met some generally happy people. Everyone has ups and downs, good periods and bad ones, but there are happy people still. Some people just manage to look at the good side of everything. I find children are generally the most happy, but part of that is just because they haven’t realised how bad life can be, they have a very different perception to use and tend to only see the happy stuff.

You should look forward to 2020. It’s a big year, the start of a new decade, and maybe this decade can finally be the one where things start going right. Maybe your new year’s resolution could be to try and be happy this year? I know you can do it."
SuicideWatch,fc4bu9p,t1_fc4a5n8,1577412161.0,"Yep, that could do with a bit of work. I’m sure you did something worth while in the 2010’s though, even if it doesn’t feel that way. It was a total disaster of a decade, the latter half at least, but to me it will always be important since a lot of big things happened to me in them, like getting my GCSE results."

SuicideWatch,fc47it0,t3_eg359h,1577408718.0,"Mine can be. Quite often it’s a minor thing that doesn’t matter at all in the grand scheme of things, but it triggers my mind to spiral into loads of horrible thoughts, which causes a panic attack, which then overwhelms me with everything and I end up really suicidal."
mentalhealth,fc47ea9,t1_fc3uy1i,1577408620.0,"That’s interesting, because I have the same problem as OP plus an anxiety disorder, but I lost my sister when I was really young, not even 4 years old. I went to the funeral, so one of my first memories from being a 4 year old was the funeral, which meant that I never quite forgot or moved on from losing them.

Maybe that’s where my death-related anxiety comes from."
mentalhealth,fc479i2,t3_efzv14,1577408518.0,"I have an anxiety disorder, and I can totally relate. To the point where I literally cannot think about death without it suddenly triggering my anxiety and causing panic attacks, which like with your problem often leave me crying myself to sleep. I don’t really know how to help though... but try to remember that life goes on even after losing someone and in most cases people who die have already lived full, happy lives. A death isn’t necessarily the end of the world.

What I usually end up doing to pull myself out of panic attacks related to this is just realising that just because people I love will die doesn’t mean I have to be crying myself to sleep now. I can be happy, and should make the most of whatever time I have left with them. It’s still hard to deal with, and I can rarely prevent panic attacks before they happen, and the sadness that comes from remember I could lose everyone can cause trouble with family events, but it’s more manageable when I think that way."
diet,fc3amqb,t3_efqmii,1577385513.0,"Drinking a lot of water can help. As can finding distractions. Or brushing your teeth with mint toothpaste to ruin the taste of food. I’ve also heard good things about gum since it can make you feel like you are eating something when you chew it, and also give you the same minty taste as toothpaste to make other stuff taste weird, but I’ve been unable to test that. I’ve also heard carbonated water is good since it can make you feel fuller. After enough time without eating (about 12 hours for me) nothing will work, and then you just have to endure the hunger.

It’s kinda hard to find a good method. Keep trying things, you might find something, although from my experience the best method is just to be super dedicated to losing weight and remember that losing weight is worth being hungry for."
