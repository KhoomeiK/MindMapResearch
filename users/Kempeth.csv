Well, as (presumably) a healthy adult (not elderly, not a child) you can probably afford to roll the dice with the flu. If you get it, it sucks but won't kill you.

The reason why you are still encouraged to get the flu shot is to offer herd immunity to those who ARE at risk of more siginificant complications.

Fish: Not all fish are equally risky. It'll depend on where they're from, how they lived and how stringent they are inspected. And as others have said, fish has usefuly nutritional elements.

Planes: Planes are vastly safer than cars in terms of fatalities / passenger miles. The most likely reason why your perspective is skewed is because airplane disasters are much more large scale (WHEN a plane crashes a LOT of people die) and rare enough to stand out (paraded through the news for days). Meanwhile car crashes are a daily occurence and generally only involve a handful of people. Also traveling by car is something many people do daily and predominantly without incident. Both of these aspects make it feel like traveling by car is safer for you, because the human brain is actually rather shit in assessing probabilities.

> The dark hole and ice are also good if you’re able to stack the +2 dps perk when enemies touch your ship. If you haven’t tried it, 4 dps to everything touching your ship is no sneeze if you can mitigate the damage you’re taking.

That's a massive combo: 2 particular officers + a specific weapon + regular repairs (which aren't that common). It does leave your squads free to pummel the enemy. With just one officer your trading 2 DPS vs whatever the enemy squads put out. There are very few ships that don't exceed or at least match 2 DPS.

Get a meat thermometer. No more guesswork whether something is done. Diced meats are easier to cook than big chunks. Minced meat is even easier (does not apply to stuff like burgers because those are essentially a big piece of meat again). So those are great beginner options.

Lego style meals with many simple separate components (steamed veggies + meat + sauce + carbs) are easier to salvage than a ""one pot"" recipe in case you fuck up. Though it's pretty hard to produce something that's genuinely inedible. They also allow you to train various techniques on their own.

A declining population in of itself is probably the least concern in this regard. But it has the potential to exacerbate other issues like urbanization. But beyond this there is nothing that inherently mandates a perpetually growing population. It's just what we've always had and so the economy has adapted to that way of thinking.

An aging population is a problem too but mostly because our societies, our governments and institutions haven't been build to accomodate such a scenario. We'd essentially be ""suffering"" an eternal case of the ""baby boomers"".
