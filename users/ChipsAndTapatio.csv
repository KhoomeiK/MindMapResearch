Like they could have just poured all of that chocolate on using a measuring cup or pot or something, but no, they had to first print and cut out a little paper crown, and cut up a water bottle, and glue it all together, and pour into it, and then remove it? WHY"

When they pull the slice away you can see melted cheese stretching, which looks like the stuff they layered in the sandwich, rather than the sauce, which is more soupy. So does that mean they baked it again after adding the sandwich components? What does that do to the lettuce? My brain hurts"

Parenting,fe5n0s9,t3_enlvnp,1578871522.0,"You sound like you are doing an amazing job. I’m so sorry you’re having to go through all of this on your own- parenting a first child can be very hard. I recommend the documentary called “Babies” - our own children loved watching it when they were babies, and it gave my partner and I a lot of confidence in our own parenting, because it shows how many different ways there are to parent a child and how resilient children are. Good luck to you, and know that you must be a wonderful parent to care so much about the job you are doing :-)

Like others here are saying, I do find that as time passes and I have more and more of these interactions that it gets easier.

Advice,fdo4vi8,t1_fdnrg3k,1578598942.0,"I'm a trans guy and having worn both sports bras and compression shirts, I can vouch that the latter results in a much better silhouette. Also, sports bras are more uncomfortable due to their lower end being just a narrow elastic band, whereas with a compression shirt, the elastic quality is more spread out and less likely to cause discomfort. It's important not to get one that's too tight though, and to spend time not wearing it. (A max of eight hours at a time is supposed to be safest.)"
ask_transgender,fdjkyok,t3_elg5ft,1578475810.0,"Another vote for Target here. I'm FTM and have always felt comfortable using the gender-neutral changing rooms there. They actually have an explicit policy supporting folks using whatever bathroom aligns with their gender identity, organize their toy section by type of toy rather than by ""girls' toys"" and ""boys' toys"", and have featured a gender-neutral kids' clothing line. At least at the one near me, I've noticed that many of the staff members appear to be queer and/or gender variant in some way. As a queer couple with gender-non-conforming kids, my partner and I find it to be a very accepting place to shop.

Sorry to go on and on about it, but I had this one experience there that really stands out for me - my son (who has long hair and sometimes wears ""girl's"" clothing, and is frequently misgendered) once needed sunglasses and a staff member offered to help us find them since they're kind of spread out in different sections. She showed us around to several areas with sunglasses aimed at all different genders, was really friendly, avoided gendered language, and was just basically awesome.

Have fun with your friend, hope it all goes well!"

Parenting,fcmkgdf,t1_fcmjti2,1577778973.0,"Aww! I hope he comes around. Another thing we did that I think worked well was reassuring our eldest that he was special to us and making sure to have some ""big kid time"" - time where he gets undivided attention, one-on-one, doing things he enjoys. So, special trips to the museum or library or a park or for ice cream, cuddles and reading his favorite books, including him in cooking and baking because he loves that and it highlights that he can do things the baby can't and that we value it, that kind of thing. Between that and getting him excited about his ""important new job,"" I think the arrival of baby sis became something he genuinely looked forward to.

Also, we actually included him in our birth plan! We told him what would be involved, arranged to have a friend present at the birth to look after him, packed a bag of his favorite toys and books and some snacks and special treats, and made sure there was a room in the birth center where he could retreat to if the birth was too intense for him to witness. But when his baby sister was on her way out into the world he chose to be right there in the room with me, cheering his mother on! It was really exciting for him and helped him feel like part of the team. Not to mention, it really helped him see his mother as strong and amazing!"
Parenting,fcmjq8g,t1_fcmin3w,1577778077.0,"My son has some temper issues; when he was three and we were getting ready to welcome his baby sister, we read ""What Baby Needs"" by William Sears, M.D. and Martha Sears, R.N. and it really helped. It specifically talks about gentleness and safety, and how to deal with anger when your parents are giving the baby all the attention you used to get. It also frames the whole thing in terms of the older kid having an important new job in being a big sibling, to help them get psyched up about the new baby and proud of their new role. We read a lot of ""big brother"" type books but this one stands out as the most helpful. Congrats on your expanding family, how exciting!"
