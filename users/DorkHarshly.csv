Soviets suffered the biggest sacrifice during the war. Both resource wise and casualties wise. This, BTW, was later used as an argument at Yalta when dividing the spoils. And by spoils I mean areas of influence (which is pretty much the only kind of spoils in the modern times).

Another ally, US, has actively entered the war only after it was effectively won. Had to be pulled by their ears into Eastern front. After they pulled a pretty similar stuff in WW1. Would you call that trustworthy?

Not to mention stuff like operation Unthinkable and operation Pike, which were known to Moscow.

The West had a big issue with Soviets as they were scared of the rise of the proletariat on their turf since 1917. Which was getting in the way of profits. There were a conflict of interests. Western Europe was already on the West side. Some of the Eastern Europe had to be ""converted"" to the Socialism, to put it lightly. Which had people unhappy hence the wall.

I am not protecting USSR, but saying that the world is not black and white, and the West was as guilty of the tensions if not more.

US retaliation power has lowered as they attacked  sovereign nation seemingly unprovoked, were attacked by that nation in responce and decided not to retaliate. They might be able to deescalate this but they lost this engagement. US are the aggressor and this will be leveraged.

The fact that A happened and B happened does not necessarily mean that A caused B. I hope you passed that 101 tho.

We know that Barca had a bad game. And we know EV was the manager at the time. You are failing to show that EV actions are the one that caused Barca to lose. 

I am claiming that at all time during the Roma game he took the path of minimal risk:

1. Play defencively at 0-0. Team that conseded 3 all season, would easily hold off team that has to score 3. Counters would suffice.

2. early goal. Changes nothing. 1-0 at half time, things are looking good, they are pressing but seem tired AF. We did it in like 20 games that year. So far no need to change anything.

3. 58' 2-0. Ok things are getting dangerous, maybe we should sub in? Should we go all in on attack and sub in Paco/Dembouz and sub out defender? Maybe Paulinho or Gomez or Denis? Seems like the best squad is already there. There could be a case for subbing in Dembouz at this point but he was (is) coming back from injury and unreliable in defence. This is the ONLY decision made by EV that could be even questioned, but actually during the game I remember thinking who can be subbed in and all options seemed worse than playing 11. 
4. 81' seems like were pulling through, subbing out gassed out Iniesta. 
5. 82' 3-0. Oh fuck, what do we do now? Most offensive options on. Paco / Dembouz in. 

TLDR: 3 fuck individual fuck ups by 3 different players. One team who shit their pants (not the first time - Bayern 7-0, PSG 4-0 etc which did not happen under EV) and other one who had a bigger heart and good luck. We will win 9/10 of this match up"

Similar (but opposite) to people praising Benitez for THAT final, conveniently forgetting that he was 0-3 down because of his shitty desicions and rescued by his players. Narrative is everything these days.
