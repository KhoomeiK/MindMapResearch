depression,fekxb46,t3_epiyby,1579209526.0,almost every second of every day.... i think i actually spend more time in my imaginary scenarios than in reality. it's just easier than facing the shitiness of the moment sometimes
depression,feiycoa,t3_epdmxt,1579150656.0,"the fact that you couldn't bring yourself to do it shows that you know deep down that you shouldn't die that way. nobody should die that way. for what it's worth, I don't even know you but I'm glad that you lived to see another day and whether you choose to believe it or not, the world ***is*** a better place with you in it. Having MDD an PD/DDD I know that suicidal thoughts can feel overwhelming and beyond control when they hit. But they pass eventually. Suicidal thoughts are temporary but suicide is permanent."
lexapro,feixwav,t3_epe543,1579150268.0,"An oral-route pill usually takes 30-45 minutes to enter the bloodstream after you take it, so if you're experiencing side effects right away, it's mostly placebo/anxiety. This happened go me to, I would take a pill and have a mini panic attack waiting for the side effects to kick in."
lexapro,feixqwx,t3_epeemc,1579150143.0,"In general since 3 days is too early for the Lexapro to acheive a steady blood concentration and 5 mg is below the threshold for a regular therapeutic dose, you should be able to discontinue immediately and not experience any withdrawal effects. At such a small dose so early in, there would be no use in tapering off  The side effects may continue for a few days after you stop because Lexapro takes a while to completely leave your bloodstream."
stopdrinking,feitkvm,t3_epcsln,1579146857.0,IWNDWYT :))
prozac,fei3obt,t3_ep9gdi,1579129575.0,"for the first week I felt a major difference within 30-45 minutes to each dose, I could definitely feel it kick in. It eventually wore off after a few weeks though as my body built a tolerance, and I'm in the process of switching to Lexapro to see if that works for me in the long-term :(("
prozac,fehwruz,t3_ep7kj5,1579125410.0,"NEVER take any cough syrups wihtout first checking to make sure they don't contain DXM/Dextromethorpan, a common decongestant, which can be **deadly** when mixed with Prozac."
prozac,feekwnz,t3_eoqoq9,1579035828.0,"I'm on week 16 and the side effects are still getting worse, they're switching me over to Lexapro because I'm so drowsy during the day I can't function and I sleep for 16 hours at a time and cant' get out of bed. Ironically the first few days I actually felt better lmao."
depression,fecat51,t3_eobaws,1578969771.0,"Same here. It's hard to explain to ppl because they think that being depressed makes you tired, and that it should be easier to fall asleep when you're depressed. I just lie awake at night with a searing pain in my mind. My thoughts feel so cold and dark it's like a shard of ice impaling my heart, keeping me up until sunrise."
stopdrinking,fecalq9,t3_eoay5u,1578969654.0,Withdrawals always do this to ya. Last time I tried to quit a substance I cursed out my friends for no reason all the time and picked fights with people I haven't talked to since high school.
prozac,fec7hl8,t3_eoeg4f,1578967981.0,"Not necessarily caused by medication!! Anxiety disorders are caused by cellular memory and reinforcement, so your brain has gotten used to associating 6 pm with panic attacks and so the cycle continues. Also happens because the brian's neurochemicals fluctuate in repeated patterns throughout the day, so I have often noticed that many of my mood swings including panic and depression happen roughly at the same time every day (which I noticed before I started Prozac), and some of my friends with anxiety/depressive disorders who don't take medication have noticed the same thing happening with them. It would probably be worthwile talking to your therapist about this to come up with some techniques/strategies to break this cycle."
lexapro,fec2acp,t3_eo11cg,1578965612.0,"Yes, there is absolutely no danger against mixing Lexapro and other SSRI antidepressants with cigarettes, as nicotine does not interfere with any of the neurotransmitters that these meds target! One thing you might notice is that you get a little bit more lightheaded than usual when you smoke, but this is pretty mild. I've even found that since I started meds, the full nicotine effect sets in a lot faster, and now I usually smoke half a cigarette or even a third of a cigarette at a time."
stopdrinking,fec1njr,t3_eobtyc,1578965345.0,"You might want to consider asking a medical professional for a prescription for a benzodiazepine (Valium, Klonopin, etc) as these meds can dramatically reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms when you're tapering off and reduce your chances of an early relapse! The only downside is these are C-IV narcotics so if you feel that you are very prone to substance addiction in general these meds might not be for you."
lexapro,fec16zm,t1_febuq9j,1578965144.0,"Yeah what my Dr. told me was that it's important to let a few ppl close to you know when you add/change a medication so that they can look out for any sudden changes in your behaviour, but most of the changes you have to look out for will be very noticeable to yourself anyways (in my experience)."
lexapro,febngje,t3_eo7nu1,1578960670.0,"Vyvanse contains the prodrug for dextroamphetamine, which can **sometimes** be dangerous when mixed with an SSRI like Lexapro. You will need to be monitored by your doctor very carefully while taking both and watch out for signs like hypertension, mania, strange thinking patterns, etc. The effects of mixing SSRIs with other medications can be unpredictable and are very different for everybody! Not everybody gets drowsy off of an SSRI either. My SSRI (Prozac) was extremely stimulating, and I would stay up until 7 am pacing the hallways of my building for the first few weeks on it."
lexapro,febahue,t3_eobo3g,1578956921.0,"This happens sometimes because the chemical change in your brain when you start an SSRI medication or increase the dose can be too sudden and can induce panic/nervousness/tension. This side effect is meant to subside within days to weeks, and if it doesn't, definitely bring it up with your doctor and discuss switching to another medication that's right for you. Everybody's reaction to a medication isdifferent, and it takes most people a while to find a medication that has tolerable side effects and is effective for them."
panicdisorder,feb869o,t3_eoautr,1578956279.0,"it sometimes comes and goes in waves, which can last for a few weeks/months at a time in my experience. If you wake up each day and assure yourself that that day will be better than the last in terms of panic, you will gradually get better every day (sometimes it's two steps forward, one step back). It never truly 'goes away', but it will eventually become less and you'll become more used to it so you notice it less, which prevents it from spiraling out of control. If you tell yourself it will never get better then it will definitely get worse!!! state of mind is everything, and patience is key (it's hard, i know)."
derealization,feb2xuv,t3_emikuo,1578954963.0,"YES!!! I get deja vu so intensely throughout the day I feel like I'm reliving some distant memory from 10 years ago. Almost 24 hours out of the day I have this feeling, it's starting to make me think I'm crazy because I'm never truly in the ""now"""
SSRIs,feb0mk2,t3_enwh9b,1578954242.0,"YES, all SSRIs have the potential to stunt your appetite because serotonin is an appetite suppressant, and many people experience weight gain on the medication despite not being able to eat, but everybody's metabolism reacts differently so you may lose weight. For me, I have stopped eating almost entirely since starting medication several months ago but my weight has not changed at all during this time. If the effects on your appetite continue after a few weeks of taking Paxil and prevents you from eating a healthy amount, SSRIs might not be the right type of medication for you so you should ask your doctor to try another type of antidepressant."
