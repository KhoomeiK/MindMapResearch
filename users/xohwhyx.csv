Professors,fevdcgb,t3_eqmu3y,1579396070.0,I don’t think I have ever had a truly helpful comment on a student evaluation. I don’t read them. It’s beyond horrible. I have to think that administration also knows how horrible evals are because if anyone took that load of BS seriously then we would have all been fired long ago.
college,fepng8m,t3_eq2zsb,1579325213.0,Professor here. I can honestly say I’ve never felt that way by a student who was just asking questions and trying to get their work done. The only time I’ve felt like a student was a pain in the arse is when they intentionally were. Try not to worry about it. It’s literally our job to help you.
