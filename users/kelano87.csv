AskReddit,ffd1n58,t1_ffc1hek,1579811645.0,"Omg I can’t explain how much I agree with this statement. I really want to get into a new career but it’s so hard to break into something new with so much CS experience on my resume... I’m trying to get into IT by going the customer support route and then training in a different specialty, but even that is proving to be difficult. I guess I need to get more certifications under my belt."
