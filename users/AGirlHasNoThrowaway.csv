I am very allergic to shellfish, as is most of my family. It might help to find out exactly what you are allergic to. Some people are allergic to all shellfish, some are allergic to only crustaceans or mollusks. Some people are even allergic to other types of fish. The best way to be able to order and eat fish if you want to, is to find out and show your parents exactly what you are and aren’t allergic to. Allergies are no joke, my shellfish allergy could kill me. So I do understand your parents erring on the side of caution."
ChoosingBeggars,ffe6f0x,t3_et48a8,1579837932.0,"NTA, and that’s NOT appropriate behavior. I’m a server as a side gig while I’m still in school, and let me tell you, as someone who has worked in this industry at several different restaurants for a long time, she was totally out of line. You NEVER comment on tips to the customer. It’s not okay, you don’t do it, you will get fired for it at many places. It’s not mandatory, which leaves people the right to not tip, to tip little, or to tip in coins. How are coins worse than no tip? She could have exchanged it for bills later. 

Honestly, I think this comes from the stereotype that teenagers are terrible tippers and sometimes, it’s true. Prom season is always a bit rough for us, because we get dozens of huge tables to take care of and they often don’t tip us or compensate us for the service. That being said, I have served MANY kids / teenagers who are respectful and tip well. They can be fun to have as customers, and I would never treat them differently or show any sort of annoyance, even if they didn’t tip me. It’s not right or fair to give teenagers different service than you would give anyone else. In the tipping industry you win some, and you loose some. It all evens out in the wash. You should have talked to a manager, because she behaved beyond inappropriately. I’m sorry that happened to you, and please don’t think that all servers are this way. You were a paying customer, and you (or teenagers of the age you were at the time) would be welcome to come eat at the restaurant I work in my section any time!"
AmItheAsshole,ffb72as,t1_ffb27ep,1579753539.0,"Absolutely! Narcan is a lifesaver. It is very highly effective, and is a wonderful resource for those who have a loved one, friend, or acquaintance suffering from opioid addiction. If you’re in the US, narcan is widely available at pharmacies by standing order, which means a pharmacist can prescribe it and dispense it over the counter. If you can’t afford it or don’t want to pay pharmacy prices, most needle exchanges and harm reduction programs give it out for free. I worked as an addiction counselor before going back to school for a higher certification, and I always carried it then, and I still carry it now, even though I don’t have anyone close to me who is addicted. With the opioid epidemic going on, you never know when it will be of use. This will blow over. Try to gently talk to them about harm reduction, it could save his life some day. You did the right thing."

I don’t know how you do or don’t feel, but from reading this post I would hypothesize that you may have some differences in how you view and feel about each other, and you may possibly still have some feelings for him.

AmItheAsshole,ffb5z9s,t1_ffb131v,1579752696.0,"Yeah, that’s if the police get involved. I myself have experience in the field. If someone calls in an overdose, it will first and foremost be a fire/emergency services issue. Furthermore, many states have Good Samaritan and other laws in place to protect people in this situation. Addicts should carry narcan, their loved ones should carry narcan, I carry narcan as an addiction counselor and just as a citizen. I have worked extensively with harm reduction organizations in my state, and narcan is the biggest asset when it comes to treating ODs. Whether it comes from another addict, a citizen, a cop, or an EMT. If it’s between someone dying and someone going to jail, I will choose saving their life. 

The problem with people with criminal records not being able to get a job goes beyond this. It’s a crappy part of our society, a part that I personally don’t agree with at all. I think that if people are going to have a chance at changing their lives, doing better for themselves, and not re-offending, we need to make it possible for them to find gainful employment. I totally hear you on that, and I couldn’t agree more. But in order for someone to even have the chance of getting better, they need to be alive.

Most likely, it was primarily EMTs or fire that would show up...the aim is to keep them alive. Not get them in trouble. Oftentimes in the case of an overdose nobody gets in trouble...they simply reverse the OD with narcan and take them to the hospital for observation due to the differences in half lives between opioids and naloxone."
AmItheAsshole,ffb04zz,t3_esmpb2,1579748532.0,"NTA. You did what you could and should do if you have reason to believe they are in grave danger. Nothing is more important than keeping someone alive. If you get the opportunity, or your boyfriend has the opportunity, you should talk to him and his girlfriend about keeping naloxone (narcan) in the house. It’s simply one of the best harm reduction measures that you can take if you are addicted to opioids or living with l/ in close proximity to someone who is. At the end of the day...you can’t get better if you’re not alive to do so. So whatever you have to do to keep someone alive, you’re NTA (never the ass) for doing it."

If she doesn’t want to meet any of his exes, she probably doesn’t want her kids to either. It just seems unnecessary. Why do you need to meet his kids? Don’t you think that may be weird for them? There’s really no reason you need to meet them. I think it’s reasonable. He’s not saying that he doesn’t want you to meet them because he thinks you would be a bad influence, or because he doesn’t think you’re a good person, he is simply operating within the boundaries he agreed to in his relationship.

AmItheAsshole,ff7y4f3,t3_es5k28,1579661125.0,"Servers have sections, and you were sitting in her section. It doesn’t really make sense for another server to leave their section in order to take care of someone in another servers section. It is difficult enough to keep up with your own section, let alone tables in someone else’s. And if you’re sitting in her section and she’s not serving you, you’re occupying a table in her section that she could be making money off of. It’s not ideal at all. It is rude to move a table after they have already sat down, especially for no good reason, but you may have to start either going on days that she isn’t working, or get used to sitting at a table in a different section.

TalesFromTheCustomer,ff7p2gu,t1_ff7n3c5,1579654888.0,"Usually we don’t get breaks as servers. We have a continuous flow of tables, all in different stages of their meal, which makes the job not conducive to taking regular breaks. And it’s not usually the case that the server is done with their shift either,  because we don’t have set end times for shifts. We get “cut” off of the floor, and then can leave once all of our tables have left and once we have completed our assigned sidework. So honestly, it sounds to me like you just got bad service. And there’s nothing wrong with not tipping 20% or in some cases even 15% if you receive bad service, and the mistakes are within the control of the server. 

Your experience at peanut place sounds...awful. That shouldn’t happen. That place does get super busy, but their servers usually have pretty small sections. I used to work there. There’s really no excuse for it, even if it’s busy you should still try to make sure your guests are being taken care of to the best of your ability.

TalesFromTheCustomer,ff7mkcx,t3_es3ljv,1579653136.0,"I was a server at a national chain (US) and I’m not sure exactly what is going on here. I worked at a place that is named after a pepper. If I was your server, I would take your drink order, bring the drinks, take your order, and then check on you multiple times before, during, and after your meal. The only thing I often didn’t do is deliver the food, because many restaurants have whoever is available run food to the table so that it comes out quick and hot. Perhaps the person taking the drink order is the host, and perhaps the person bringing the food is a food runner, but either way you should still expect to see your server once or twice during your meal at least. I wouldn’t have been offended if a table tipped me less than 20% if I had not gone over to check on them after seeing that their meal was delivered. Your server should be stopping by within a few minutes of taking your first bite. So in short? I’m not entirely sure. It could be bad service or it could be a place that does “team service”. Some restaurants require their employees to share tips, but more commonly your server will be the one keeping the tip minus a small “tip-out” paid to support staff."

My pregnancy was completely normal and healthy until the day my daughter was born and she suffered a stroke. Many infants do. Stroke is as common in infants as it is in the elderly, and it was completely random. She didn’t ask to be born that way. She didn’t ask for a lifelong disability. And neither did your SIL. The fact that you would exclude her so that you don’t have to worry about it? I mean that’s really gross to me. I hope nothing bad happens to you. I hope your baby is born perfectly healthy, and stays that way. But stuff happens, you have to accept that, and people don’t deserve to be excluded so that you can pretend it doesn’t. Being anxious about your pregnancy is completely normal. Everyone is. It’s what makes you a good mom. But excluding your autistic SIL because of it is just taking it a step too far. I promise you that in the very rare event that something does happen to your child at any point, you will love them and appreciate them just the same. Your life will not be any less full.

Do you mean behind as in you won’t graduate in the normal time frame, or behind as in not fulfilling requirements for your program of study on time? I would encourage you to just weigh the pros and cons of each. Look at your end goal, and see which path is more likely to get you there. Ask yourself if spending extra time in school with higher grades would be more conducive to your end goals, or would it be better to focus on getting it done in a certain timeframe with possibly lower grades? Are there any financial, medical, or other restraints that would make staying in school longer difficult? Maybe three classes would be a compromise between two and four? And if you feel like you need accommodations other than what you are currently receiving, don’t be afraid to schedule an appointment to talk to the school about it. It sounds to me like you’re putting a huge amount of pressure on yourself, which can be motivating, but it can also be a huge stressor. I hope that this upcoming semester goes smoothly for you!"

That being said, of course your disability is a legitimate and valid reason for struggling in school. I wouldn’t call it an excuse, you don’t need an excuse. You are doing what you can with what you have, and I can’t imagine any professor not taking your circumstances into consideration. My child has a disability (cerebral palsy/ spastic hemiplegia due to perinatal stroke), and it can often be far more difficult for her to keep up with her classmates. Sometimes the things that come naturally to other people her age are a challenge for her, and I recognize how hard she has to work. I just always encourage her to do things at her own pace, and at a level with which she is comfortable. I would encourage you to do the same. Don’t worry so much about being behind. You will get there when you get there. There is absolutely nothing wrong with going at your own pace. Have you considered maybe taking fewer classes at a time, so that you can spend some extra time working on each one? Is your school affording you all of the accommodations that you need? Is there another way in which your school or professors could accommodate your disability that you feel would be more helpful?"

The first thing I do when I get home if my daughter is being watched by a family member or sitter while I’m at work is walk down to her crib and check on her. First thing. Always. If I couldn’t do that for 30 minutes, If I couldn’t get someone to hear me in such a small space for that long, I would be completely terrified, and I would be angry at the person who was in charge for not being more responsible and aware.

AmItheAsshole,fdph6sv,t3_emlazz,1578628527.0,"This is more of a legal issue than an asshole issue. Are you an asshole for trying to keep your child away from an abuser? No. No you are not. However, there are several legal issues at play here. I’m going to assume that you are in the US. There are proper legal channels to go through for you. If you do anything that could be considered illegal, shady, underhanded, etc you could risk loosing custody yourself. 

I don’t know what state you live in, but most states have a law on the books that says that any child born of a marriage will automatically be assumed the child of the man you are married to. Therefore, since you are legally married and were legally married at the time of conception and/or birth, unless another person claims parentage of the child and in some cases paperwork is signed by your husband, your husband may automatically be presumed as the father on the birth certificate. If that happens, your husband will have parental rights, and this will become a custody/ allocation of parental responsibility issue. I highly, highly suggest that you contact an attorney. I highly, highly suggest that you separate before the birth of your child, even divorce if possible. You need to arm yourself with legal knowledge, because this could quickly devolve into a battle for parental rights. You NEED to get a lawyer. I can’t stress this enough. You NEED to operate within the laws of your state if you don’t want to give him ammunition to seek more custody than you are willing to give, more custody than would be in the best interest of your child. Lying about an abortion isn’t going to cut it. Divorce is a legal matter, it takes time, and the chances of your lie surfacing are very high. He will be afforded the opportunity to establish paternity one way or another, if he chooses to pursue it, even against your will...at which point your efforts to lie and hide the birth from him may backfire. In many circumstances, certain issues surrounding custody, child support, parenting time, etc are considered either the right of the child, for the benefit of the child, or are decided based upon what is perceived to be in the best interest of the child. Therefore, they can be done without your permission, against your will, or without your blessing. 

Proceed with extreme caution. Consult an attorney who is licensed to practice family and divorce law in your state. Document everything.  Be safe, but document the abuse if it occurs. Stockpile evidence. One thing that you can certainly do is seek sole custody of your child. Most states prefer a 50/50 custody arrangement, but if you can prove that there is abuse you have a good chance of being granted sole custody. I would consider an order of protection, in your case. I sincerely wish you and your child the best."

Which makes sense, considering the profession, but you need to remember that this is a job, a profession where the work takes place within a specific environment-usually a clinic or office. It is largely the patients responsibility to keep up with scheduling. OP has some issues surrounding abandonment which is compounding this issue, and which the therapist should also be considerate of, but OP needs to keep in mind that this is a patient/practitioner relationship. Either way, OP, you should not respond with “discharged”. Either voice your concerns appropriately, or respond letting her know that you will not be scheduling any further appointments. “Discharged” sounds immature and vengeful."

If you aren’t letting it interfere with your time with her, and you aren’t doing anything that could be perceived as unfaithful, you should continue to do what you enjoy.

If you tap a car while parking, going very slow, and there’s no visual damage I guarantee there’s no grievous hidden damage either. I do have a bad taste in my mouth about this due to do something that happened to me many years ago. I hit a parked car (doing 3mph max). Someone was sitting in the car. There was no visual damage, but we exchanged info anyway. Next thing you know this dude is trying to claim that I caused different damage that he had on the other side of the car, and that he was seriously injured, blah blah. My insurance company ended up having to pay for 2 ER visits for him...I gently tapped the car at most.

Sometimes I would get dozens of messages each time I logged on, which I’m sure lots of women do, and since I only glanced at each message and profile for a few seconds, something had to stand out. If you are getting first dates but no second dates or interest beyond that, maybe you’re coming across as not being very nice, or not having your shit together.

I would sooner give an ultimatum of “choose between this relationship or excessive drinking.” She’s an adult, her drinking is within her control. It doesn’t matter what her friend says, your GF has the autonomy to make smart decisions when it comes to alcohol. So instead of focusing on the friendship, focus on the drinking issues....it’s more easily fixable, within her control, and not asking her to ditch a friend. 

That being said, I would be more concerned about the things she is saying to you when she’s drunk. Drunk or not, sentiments like that don’t just come out of nowhere."

And on top of that, she helped you promptly and immediately when asked. You didn’t have to shout at her to get her attention. She didn’t ignore you. What’s it to you if it helps her work day go by a bit easier? Mind your own business. Back when I worked in retail and service whenever a customer like you said “I won’t be coming back” or “you just lost my business” I would think....thank god! Go somewhere else with that attitude."

AmItheAsshole,fco4ayn,t3_ei0a0b,1577823814.0,"Oh hell no. NTA. This happened to me two years ago when my daughter was a baby. She was four months old, and we went to visit her aunt (my daughters fathers sister) and her family. We drove six hours with a baby to go stay with them for four days. We noticed one of the kids was sick, which they didn’t tell us, so we quarantined our daughter to a different side of the house while the aunt brought her sick kid to the doctor. Surprise surprise, the kid had the FLU. The flu can kill a four month old. I immediately packed up and insisted on us leaving immediately to protect my kiddo. And apparently, that made me an asshole. Guess what? I don’t care. Because it kept my four month old from getting a deadly virus that she wasn’t and couldn’t be vaccinated against. Trust me, driving six hours just to turn around and drive another six wasn’t my idea of fun...but I didn’t care. You shouldn’t care either. They don’t get to expose your baby to illness because they’re selfish."

AmItheAsshole,fcmdj6r,t3_ehy24q,1577771420.0,"NTA, but we do have the same mom. Let me tell you...don’t lie to avoid the drama. I’ve done it. I do it. I always feel terrible about it, because it makes me feel like she stole another piece of me. It makes things worse, and at the end of the day you have to live with yourself. I live by a moral code by which it is immoral to lie, but especially for the purpose of robbing people of their autonomy. I just figure I’m going to be honest and not rob my mom of the autonomy to be a heinous bitch about whatever it is. You’re trying to make a situation easier on yourself, but in doing so, you are keeping her from understanding how her actions have directly impacted that decision. If she knows it, and she sees that her behavior is pushing you away, maybe eventually she will rein it in. But not telling her the truth solves nothing....because she will not know she did anything wrong, and she will continue to stomp boundaries and alienate people. If you want a behavior to be fixed, you have to confront it, set boundaries, enforce boundaries, and follow through with consequences. Lying to avoid conflict enables the behavior."

Trust me when I say, I am well versed in childhood seizures. My daughters neurologists instructions were always the same as your neurologist, seizures (in a child with a known seizure disorder) under 5 minutes are usually not a medical emergency. Time the seizure, properly follow instructions given by your neurologist during the seizure, help your child recover from the seizure, record the seizure if you feel like you need to in order to show the neurologist what is happening...but you do not need to call 911 and pay ridiculous ambulance bills every time."

But you certainly shouldn’t have to sit through him fingering her under blankets. Or him sucking on her in front of your dad. That level of uncalled for PDA, in that context, is something that I would consider to be disrespectful of the other parties present. There’s a time and place for that kind of activity, and that time is when you’re alone and the place is somewhere private. It sounds like he feels like he has something to prove, is insecure in his relationship, and she isn’t comfortable with it....and that part is most concerning to me. I’m all for intimacy and passion, but that is activity that should be kept between the parties involved. It shouldn’t be happening in front or other people who are uncomfortable with it. You should say something, and if he doesn’t stop, I wouldn’t blame you for not wanting to spend time with her when they are together."

AmItheAsshole,fcjj2ss,t1_fchx9tx,1577689542.0,"People who cannot see things from the other side lack emotional intelligence, and thus lack empathy. Until recently emotional intelligence wasn’t considered a “thing” like it is now. Now, there are tests for it, and even some employers screen for emotional intelligence. It is important to be able to perceive, understand, and respond appropriately to the emotions of others. I feel like I can always do that. I can always at the very least TRY to place myself in the other persons shoes and mind, and attempt to take inventory of the situation through their lens. I do this regularly. All the time. Any time I need to make a decision that involves another person. This is why emotional intelligence is important, because lacking it can lead to alienating people, and pushing them away. Ignoring how someone feels about a situation that is very impactful for them, like OPs mother dying, is extremely hurtful, disrespectful, and will cause him to want to shut her out permanently. She is overvaluing her emotions, motivations and desires, and undervaluing OPs. Where OP might have come around to accept her as a step-motherly figure, that cannot happen if she refuses to accept OPs position and feelings as valid, as something that should be embraced and respected. Losing a mother is traumatic no matter the age. My mom is in her 50s, recently lost her mother, and she was absolutely devastated and is still grieving months later. It is even more traumatic for a child, a teenager who still relies to heavily on their mother."

Then, she POINTED IT OUT, and said very clearly what would happen if the juice spilled. That was disregarded. And then, when it happens (due to disrespect and disregard), she’s the asshole? No way. Whether or not it was an accident (and it wasn’t, it was carelessness), in the real world. there are still consequences for actions. Consequences for breaking rules. Shit, there are consequences for accidents. You can’t bail your son out, even if it was an accident, because not only did he know he shouldn’t be doing it but he disrespected a warning. How will he learn, if you don’t teach? While it might be excessive to ask your son to pay the damages in full, I think that withholding allowance until at least half of the total is paid is totally reasonable. It will be a valuable lesson to him."

The child didn’t choose to be dragged to a party while sick so that the parent can have fun. The child may not even be old enough to have a true understanding, and is probably suffering due to the poor decisions their parent has made.

While I agree that lying about being on birth control is terrible, and it clearly robs the other partner of their autonomy to make informed decisions regarding reproduction, lying about birth control will not cause the other person to be unwittingly exposed to STDs. Condoms protect against several sexually transmitted infections, and therefore I would classify stealthing as worse. Having a child will not kill you. Contracting HIV due to exposure to semen that should have been inside of a condom has the potential to do just that. If we are measuring potential harm, stealthing is worse."
