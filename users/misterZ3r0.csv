computerscience,ff8g1pr,t1_ff88tgn,1579676878.0,"It definitely depends on the particular program but a good accredited program will give you a strong foundation in CS requirements that's far beyond high school. Computer Architecture (Assembly Language), OOP, Basic Design Patterns, Searching and Sorting Algorithms, Data Structures (including BSTs and Red-Black), etc.

An A.S. or A.A. is essentially the first two years of an undergraduate degree. At least that's how it is in California. And then people usually transfer to a 4-year university (to finish the rest of the 2 years). I have had friends that started out at community college earning their A.S. in Comp Sci and then transfer to UC Berkeley, UCLA, and even Cal Tech to go on and earn their bachelor's degree in CS. They all felt prepared.

I would strongly suggest you get your Associates in Comp Sci from an accredited non-profit like a community college. An AA from a for-profit school is most likely going to be worthless because the curriculum simply isn't going to be up to snuff in addition to not being accredited.

In terms of employment, unless an employer has a pre-existing relationship with the school you are earning your AA or AS, most employers want you to have a BS in Comp Sci. But you can overcome that with a strong portfolio of projects and business experience.

Also, one benefit of bootcamps is that some reputable ones work closely with partner companies that actually hire you at the successful completion of their program. In addition, some bootcamps offer a guarantee of reimbursement if you don't find a job within a period of time or simply charge you a percentage of your paycheck.  But the bootcamp scene is FULL of bullshit artists and cons, tread lightly."
