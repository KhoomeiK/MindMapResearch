depression,fe909kp,t3_eo1usb,1578932852.0,"Hey i work parttime too. I am 20 years old and i too get judged by some of my coworkers. They think i am lazy but that's really not the case. I try to not take their judging to hard because they simply have no idea what depression is like. I can imagine if your bf does it, it makes it more difficult. I often feel like a failure because i am the only one that works part time. I am an eletrician. But yeah youre not the only one ;)."
depression,fdd8kka,t1_fdcmvfa,1578299753.0,I imagine it sucks when this happens. I had this happen to me too. I just gave up after a few days of no reply. It wasnt my only friend so i could talk about it with someone else. It fucking hurts but sadly shit like this happens quite a lot.

depression,fdbrz5f,t3_eki2bw,1578261117.0,I honestly think that it shows she isnt really a friend? Ofcourse i dont know  the whole story but best friends shouldn't avoid one another. You talked about getting through this together? You mean like your mental health? I would like to hear. I hope you figure something out with her.

""Just cheer up"", ""don't be so negative about yourself"" i mean thanks dude if it was only this easy. When i am around normal 19 year olds i feel like a alien that missed out on life. Probably something youre familiar with xd"
