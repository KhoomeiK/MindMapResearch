Repeating wasn't necessary. It just brightens my life a little bit every time I say/type/think about/read that line."

DunderMifflin,fdniflv,t1_fdnd7e2,1578586473.0,"My favorite is when Jim visits her at her dorm in NYC (when he asks the cameraman to look at one of Pam's paintings and proceeds to close the door, and lock the cameraman outside of the room). The way she looks at Jim when she opens the door is one of the hottest things I've ever seen."
deftones,fdk9kiy,t1_fdjpah9,1578499158.0,The first 10-15 seconds have been my 5:30AM alarm sound for years now. I've pretty much listened to at least part of Xerces every day for over 10 years. Still one of my favorite Deftones songs.

depression,fcotrtn,t3_ei1phe,1577841336.0,"Some good, some bad. 1999 sticks out like a sore thumb because of depression, loneliness, heavy and unhealthy drug use; 2009 was all about feeling betrayed and abandoned, and getting divorced as a result."
depression,fcmycj2,t3_ei1phe,1577797515.0,"I had a shitty 1999, 2009, and 2019. 2000 and 2010 were nice bounce-back years, and the hope that 2020 will be one as well is the only thing keeping me together right now. I’m not superstitious, but I need something to look forward to and this is all I have right now.

Find something, anything, to look forward to in the new year. It may not be a solution, but it may be a start."

LateStageCapitalism,fcmsi4w,t3_ehupju,1577790093.0,"I won a BWW $50 gift card recently, and, over the last 2 weeks, I've bought lunch there a couple of times just to not let the card go to waste. After a 12-piece order of boneless chicken wings, and one of their most basic burgers (with fries), I'm down to $11 left. Food wasn't even that good. I think BWW is killing itself all on its own."
