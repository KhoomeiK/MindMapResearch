BipolarMemes,ffbw41b,t1_ffbw3k1,1579784721.0,I asked a question
BipolarMemes,ffbw223,t1_ffbw1lu,1579784670.0,I am
BipolarMemes,ffbw0ff,t1_ffbvyc1,1579784627.0,"Then why did YOU start the insults, boy?"
BipolarMemes,ffbvz0n,t1_ffbvwmq,1579784590.0,"I have no fault. Re-read everything. You are very sensitive to people telling your life is not that dramatic. Which makes you a drama queen, not bipolar"
BipolarMemes,ffbvvoi,t1_ffbvngm,1579784504.0,"Can you just not accept the simple fact that you â€˜life strugglesâ€™ are pretty cute? Is this a thing for you to fight over? To show how hard your life is? When you can only tell me you have to pay rent and your boss doesnâ€™t understand depression? Wow thatâ€™s such hard life. Youâ€™re mediocre, accept it"
BipolarMemes,ffbvqq6,t1_ffbvngm,1579784377.0,"I assumed you were an American. How should I know. You countered with calling me ignorant, thatâ€™s a personal insult that allows me to destroy a retarded peasant like you."
BipolarMemes,ffbvjf0,t1_ffbvfbo,1579784188.0,"Ehm, ok, good argument with 0 foundation, I guess?

Sadly not all among us actually have half a brain. Good luck on your journey in life and your hard struggles to pay rent! Because we donâ€™t"
BipolarMemes,ffbv0is,t1_ffbunbh,1579783690.0,"Thatâ€™s literally the problem everyone on the planet faces.

As an American you are probably horny when you hear the word capitalism, but let me tell you, itâ€™s probably our worst economical system when it comes down to human needs. 

But hey capitalism gives us technology and technology wins wars. HURRAY"
BipolarMemes,ffbs9pu,t1_ffazspi,1579780811.0,Dam bipolar must really ruin your life...
BipolarMemes,ffbrzkt,t3_eskank,1579780475.0,"Sounds more like adhd. Bipolar in mania is not just â€˜forgettingâ€™ stuff, bipolar in depression is not just â€˜overthinkingâ€™. These are literally â€”>ADHD<â€” symptoms.... repost this in r/adhd and youâ€™ll find way more relaters."
BipolarMemes,ff70ill,t3_erw0a5,1579638679.0,Haha awesome.  My manic periods I always try really hard to start healthy routines (mixed results tho)
bipolar,feqekxw,t1_feps2mp,1579340930.0,Every man has wanted to be in porn on at least one point in his life. Thatâ€™s like something me and all my non-bipolar friends share.
bipolar,feqe41m,t1_fepabr5,1579340735.0,Borderline?
bipolar,feqctiy,t3_eq9s5x,1579340195.0,"Dam Gal, your depression den looks more clean than my non-depression den :p

Life be life. Look forward! Much love and energy Iâ€™d send you right now. ðŸŒ»"
KULeuven,fenkzz9,t1_feni5uo,1579286935.0,"Sorry that you are dumb. :(

No srsly. Bsc difficulty is 10x msc CS difficulty without a doubt"
learnmachinelearning,fen9svu,t3_eq2ulb,1579280078.0,"Iâ€™d say mathematics. Unless your CS path is really focused on ML, AI. 

The reason is you will learn a lot of stuff in CS that you will never use in AI, while a good mathematical foundation is by definition necessary.

In the end both would do fine and it will depend more on your motivation outside of your education"
KULeuven,fen92iq,t1_femsbsl,1579279632.0,Uhhh?? CS is super chill...
bipolar,femf0av,t3_eptxyo,1579252061.0,Jelly of you having a morning routine
bipolar,femepl3,t3_epl4pe,1579251623.0,Lucky you that as a woman they seem to expect you to be crazy or at least â€˜acceptâ€™ it.
ProgrammerHumor,fedlkeg,t3_eok8c2,1579014521.0,Based on the image c++
BipolarMemes,fdnlu86,t3_em9kpu,1578588495.0,Kinda describes 90% of the world population but idd very relatable
Empaths,fdmo94w,t3_elzx6h,1578557770.0,"Stop watching the news. Itâ€™s what I do. Now I can hear all you â€˜mericans yell why the fck would you do that. Simple, why wouldnâ€™t I?"
ADHDmemes,fdgpjoi,t3_el6mgx,1578404904.0,Isnâ€™t this something every person on the planet forgets?
ADHDmemes,fcah93c,t1_fc9oqxk,1577569216.0,"What do you mean? We fit everywhere. As a matter of fact, we are even superior."
Empaths,fc2h2lw,t3_efttbh,1577359852.0,Thereâ€™s no â€˜oneâ€™ definition. Basically feeling emotions of others and it also affects you. Unless youâ€™re consciously blocking it off
BPDmemes,fbu5rag,t1_fbt4grz,1577108249.0,I wouldnâ€™t really call this art
