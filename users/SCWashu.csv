bipolar,ff3ol7p,t3_erdyh0,1579545505.0,I started looking up bipolar mood charts to see what I could add to mine and it has helped. I use mint so I can look in shame at my bad spending.
ChronicPain,ff1roax,t3_er3ju8,1579484675.0,My boy has more white but he does the same. He has gotten better about knowing when my mood turns to short because of the pain so he cuddles more. I have two tabby brothers.
batonrouge,feikjhd,t1_fehc3xu,1579140673.0,Same. I move my mom and I with them and they were great with scheduling and being on time. They helped move my mom from NOLA and I moved from a storage unit.
Art,fefeok8,t3_eou5dw,1579054724.0,You are a boss at embroidery. Hats off! I wish I had money for gold or silver cause you deserve
bipolar,fefeies,t3_eou9vz,1579054618.0,This is awesome and I really love the colors you use. If it makes you feel better I'm an art teacher and even I feel that way about some people's work. Especially when I'm in depression
blackladies,fdjr79n,t1_fdivthu,1578484417.0,"Same! I was moving out of the way for an elderly black woman on the way to the hospital and a white RN had cut on the left side of her so I couldn’t go that way and she stopped and said “baby you not in the way and don’t you move aside for anyone neither” 
I was trying to be respectful so it kinda was nice"
bipolar,fdb53oj,t3_ekdkm2,1578253931.0,"The fact that I accidentally zoomed in and it became this amazing adventure makes me want to ask for two things. 

Please share more if and when you are able. I can’t wait to see your progression no matter how long it takes

And have you thought about doing a photo log? It may be both a helpful memory and squished together could be a neat progression video."
learnart,fd5sdys,t3_ejz1rv,1578180961.0,"I really like this, to mimic similar comments using hatching or even stippling to enhance the texture and shadows to create more depth could be the only other thing I would enhance. I don't know if you are trying to keep a theme but working on different ways to shuffle the images to play with the composition in the future could help you improve. What I mean by this if you draw this then fine, take a photo and pop it into a digital program and try to shuffle some of the images around like the legend in the corner, see where it might look neat elsewhere. Learning to train your eye for the type of composition you like will help you grow."
printmaking,fcwi7yn,t3_ejaa9x,1578026306.0,Only done about 4 other linocuts so I am quite a novice. Any recommendations or advice or cc are welcome. I just don’t know how to best tackle the center of the flower. Thanks in advance.
learnart,fcfpkc5,t1_fcfly6x,1577632522.0,Using stills from the movie can help you measure size differences to help you in the future. This piece focuses on the setting and mood quite well. More research can help you bring life to the scene and help create an attractive setting
learnart,fcfkbsk,t3_eh4ufc,1577630820.0,"If you look back at his moments on the movie his torso is rather long and the last arm is almost near the hips. Also the items in his work area were far away and very tall or very long, the film cuts this wonderful but in a way he is a huge arachnid like human that’s probably 2/3 times taller than chise in the body and his forearm is longer than her body as well. It’s a good drawing but those tidbits might help. I don’t recal the art of spirited away book having a hight chart but I can share a photo of it if I find it."
bipolar,fc1wh92,t3_efi8q5,1577331844.0,I have used daylio and it felt really limited. I love eMoods and I bought it so I could add in customs. It helped me create a structured timeline that helped cement my diagnosis and why I was shitting blood for a few weeks.
bipolar,fbm0mif,t1_fbfjv5k,1576975158.0,Thanks. I did. He requested that I stop the meds and recognized that it’s causing mania symptoms.
