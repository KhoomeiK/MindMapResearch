AskReddit,fevncc4,t3_eqies2,1579399295.0,"I've had so many out of body experiences. 

The first time I saw myself laying on my bed. I reached for my face. In that moment I felt myself get cold and watched myself pull my blanket over my face. I woke up completely under the blanket. 
 Second time I was at my friends house. I slept in his brother's room. Once I was ""asleep"" I remember floating into the hallway. And hearing dozens of disembodied voices asking ""what?"" Like a rubber band I snapped back into my body.

There were a few others where I'd float upright into the kitchen because I'm so thirsty. I couldn't ever turn on the faucet though bc, well, I wasn't physically there. 

Of all the experiences there was one at Grandma's house. A century old farmhouse built Indiana. I used to have a hard time sleeping upstairs so I'd fall asleep with the TV on in the living room. Again, I'm thirsty, I float into the kitchen and cannot turn on the faucet. The futility was so exasperating I gave up and started to fall like a feather. BUT, then, a dozen hands seemed to catch me and lift me up to the ceiling. Whispering among themselves I remember hearing a voice say ""we can't take him yet"" 

At that point I woke. I've not had any experience like that in almost a decade. There are some lucid dreams I can physically feel myself moving between dimensional layers."

Everytime we would try to meet she had some bogus excuse why I couldn't come that weekend. One of my ex's was watching out for my dumbass. The quickly discovered where the pics came from. As soon as I called out the catfish she deleted everything. Months later she reached out and asked how I figured it. Id always been suspicious. 

One of the first convos we had she text me pics of a woman ""she met at the bar last night"" asked me if I thought she was cute. I said ""yeah she's cute but not as cute as you."" Thinking I was being sweet. As it turns out, these were her actual photos. 

Few years forward, moved to Washington, she got back in touch and started sending me actual nudes trying to come to Seattle for a weekend. Somewhat tempting to follow through but I'd seen enough bullshit."
