AskEurope,ff1mwhj,t3_er3ej2,1579481822.0,"Yes! Just once, while me and my friends were in London. We were at a coffee shop, the waiter started to take our order in english, we only spoke a few words or sentences until he asked in French if we were French as well though. We French people tend to have quite a thick accent."
AskWomen,fegkimq,t1_fegfk7h,1579095559.0,Just reading this makes me nauseous... Jesus wtf
TwoXChromosomes,fef86mo,t1_fef31t4,1579050471.0,"I find it really easy to simply put the blame on the women again, here the mother... I'm a woman, I don't have the best relationship with my father: he's a narcissist, he is unkind, not supportive, sexist, homophobic/transphobic, condescending to me and I really just... don't like him. But I still treat men with respect and I don't project my own  issues with my father into other men, because clearly it would be insane and that wouldn't be fair to all the other men who aren't my father."
thesims,fe5d2kb,t1_fe49qce,1578867877.0,I was wondering the exact same thing! Tell me if you're successful please haha!
insaneparents,fdn55g7,t1_fdn4hg3,1578577567.0,Glad to hear that and congrats on the baby! Wishing you all the best!
insaneparents,fdn20lc,t1_fdn0eei,1578574886.0,"I'm sorry, I hope you're doing better now. It's exactly what I was thinking while reading this post. Sometimes kids who don't feel loved at home will try to seek what looks like love outside, and sadly are at risk of being taking advantage of by abusive assholes..."
TrollXChromosomes,fdmx5r7,t1_fdmrgq9,1578569827.0,"Solid representation of growing up with my father and brother. My brother has since grown up and is actually really pleasant now! But my father... He constantly talk to me with condescension. I don't spend a lot of time with him now, surprisingly."
relationship_advice,fdkawa0,t1_fdk9aay,1578499994.0,"Nitpicking, come on... People say that all the time, it doesn't mean they think their spouse is an object."
TrollXChromosomes,fdie4f9,t1_fdhi9y7,1578440840.0,"That's pretty condescending as well, it's also your husband's house and he's an adult, wtf..."
thesims,fdhilxj,t1_fdhi90h,1578423423.0,"It's still a good feature, I like it, but sadly we can't decide the price of rent so..."
thesims,fdhgvw1,t1_fdhge63,1578422384.0,"Yes I know, I have Discover University and I built a few complex like that, but the rent is pretty low, so I don't find it very sustainable... You also have to lock the doors if you don't want the renters at your house, but then it's annoying for everyday life and parties..."
thesims,fdhcvsw,t3_el9x1z,1578420114.0,"I wish we had the ability to divide a lot. How cool would it be to put 3 little family on this lot, divide the price by 3, divide the lot with a grid (idk) and only make one family playable/active! The division grid could even include communal space."
Botchedsurgeries,fdgk4qo,t1_fdedmoh,1578399981.0,"Talk to your dermatologist about tretinoin, there are some studies out there with before/after pictures, it can do wonders for fine lines/wrinkles. If you do use it in the future, just use a good moisturizer and spf."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fdgh0ua,t1_fdfdzkr,1578396420.0,"First thing I thought when I saw this video is how is this video different from the ones on Facebook shaming/mocking their kids for likes? I don't mind videos where ""we were filming because of X and accidently caught our kids acting or saying something stupid"", but recording your kid having a tantrum isn't solving the issue that's frustrating them."
relationships,fdd61f7,t1_fdd45ai,1578296352.0,"Fuck, I've never thought of that. Yeah, there's a reason life expectancy of married women is smaller than the ones not married, while the life expectancy of married men increase! Imagine having a child with that type of ""partner""..."
ShitAmericansSay,fcz0gbn,t1_fcygrqf,1578091150.0,"I have green eyes and my mom's a redhead, am I Irish now? I'm pretty sure I'm a French citizen, pretty sure my whole family is French, but maybe I've been lied to?! Plus Guinness beer is my favorite beer! Should I claim citizenship yet? Lol."

ShitAmericansSay,fcieebj,t1_fch16yu,1577661295.0,"I don't think that was even the issue here though, I'm sure he probably realised he was wrong once the other person showed him the map. This dude was just too fucking proud to admit he was wrong! Infuriating."
