startrek,ffa48u0,t1_ff9y0kz,1579727572.0,"I really like this explanation. The Q, for all of their powers and omniscience, really do seem rather fallible. The idea that a race of people achieved those heights and decided to step back is powerful and opens up lots of storylines. Maybe the El Auriens created the Q out of a misguided attempt at playing god. They elevated the Q race before they were ready and there were disastrous consequences that made the El Auriens rethink their choices. Just one of many potential plot threads springing to mind."
