homeowners,ffapdp4,t1_ff7edaq,1579741365.0,"Yikes!  It looks like when they finished the basement they just added that return in the existing stuff. You probably need to get a pro to redo the design for the ductwork for downstairs, they could probably add a new run off the existing return trunk, just in a different spot. 

Do you heat your basement?  When they remodeled did they add any duct work, or upgrade the unit?"

They dulled a bit, but at some point, enough is enough.

Was it uncomfortable to have it removed?  The insertion was really rough for me."

Half of the sales pitch was scare tactics on why if I were to hire anyone else all of my windows would fail.  All vinyl windows offgas chlorine and you‚Äôre poisoning your family etc.  

The options I asked for were less expensive and he told me that the price difference between them was only a few dollars, so it didn‚Äôt matter, EVEN THOUGH he refused to give me an actual cut sheet or price breakdown on what I was being quoted for. Best believe I was incredibly honest when they called and asked for feedback on the sales call. 

I actually work in HVAC, so I‚Äôm not an idiot when it comes to this stuff, I just wanted a few quotes before I decided whether or not I would do it myself."

I was also never technically in the overweight BMI until I hit age 30, but I was a juniors 13, so I was on the cusp of having to shop at other stores, so when my clothes got tight I would just be a bit more mindful of what I was eating. I‚Äôm also 5‚Äô10‚Äù, so in order to keep shopping in the juniors section I had to stay a smaller size. The fear of not being able to wear those awful low rise jeans kept me mindful of my eating, but I never attempted a crash diet or Atkins or that kind of thing. 

My mom also would always tell me how jealous of my body shape she was. I am large busted with a natural hourglass figure. I‚Äôve always loved how I looked naked, even when I was overweight. We are very lucky, and I think it‚Äôs troubling how easy it is to pick up on our mothers and other women‚Äôs insecurities."

xxfitness,fegc8ej,t3_ep0nu9,1579087282.0,"I was always a person who would try to ‚Äúeat healthier‚Äù after I noticed my clothes getting tight but I had never even really made a serious attempt to lose weight until I was 33. I had gained probably 10lbs after my mom died when I was 30, and then I quit smoking and gained about 5 more. I downloaded MyFitnessPal on a whim, started tracking, and BAM within a year I lost 35 pounds.

It was actually kind of frustrating because I always wanted to be skinny when I was younger, and to have a had a tool like MFP when I was younger would have been a total game changer.

Edit: I love how I‚Äôm getting downvoted for just sharing my experience. Sorry I never tried to diet when I was 10, but I don‚Äôt think that makes my experience less valid."

I was 32 when I started classes and had zero issues getting a job. If you‚Äôre looking to make the switch, you could even call a place that‚Äôs hiring and ask about what certifications/schooling they‚Äôre looking for in a new hire. 

I will say, be wary of schools that only last for 3-8 weeks, there‚Äôs been a lot of for profit schools that set up shop specifically to take advantage of financial aid and the GI Bill."

EDIT: I wanted to add that it‚Äôs definitely possible to get before starting classes, but most of those jobs are in residential and I wanted to work commercial.

The pizzagate truther told me it wasn‚Äôt a big deal because he tasted it  and it tasted fine.  It‚Äôs a long story but I texted two people because I was furious about it and eventually word got around to the store manager, who called the manager in charge and cussed him out and made him throw it out. 

When I texted the actual kitchen manager, he said OK, but then didn‚Äôt do anything until the next day when he threw out all of the fresh stuff that was prepped because the other stuff was garbage and thrown out. 

So that‚Äôs the day I went to the local community college and signed up for trade school.  Because fuck all of that noise.

Oh, and the next day they made fun of me for being so ‚Äúemotional‚Äù about the pot roast being out.  I‚Äôm a woman, so it‚Äôs just lame coded bullshit."

I stayed long enough to watch them drop food on the floor and serve it to customers. They left a pot roast out overnight for 8+ hours after it was cooked and served it to customers the next day. 

After 10+ years in the industry I know that all restaurants aren‚Äôt that bad, but there‚Äôs no fucking way I was willing to roll the dice and try again. Got a job at Costco as a janitor while going back to school and I‚Äôve got a decent job in HVAC now.

If anything, they have more power than anybody because they can use that wealth and power to affect change in a way we can‚Äôt. The extremely wealthy already barely pay taxes, at percentages way lower than we could ever dream of. Is that fair to us?  They hoard money in a way where it never goes back into the system to pay for basic government services."
Michigan,fdad9jq,t1_fdaciyh,1578244762.0,"I mean unless you plan on leaving over 11.5 million to your estate when you die, I don‚Äôt understand how this even affects you, or why you feel the need to defend those who hoard their wealth. Rich people already barely pay any taxes, it‚Äôs just a drop in the bucket that affects less than 1% of Americans.

Edit: 11.5 million is the actual federal limit, not some arbitrary number I picked out that seemed justified to me."
Michigan,fdab3yu,t1_fda93k7,1578243965.0,"Yes, because they‚Äôre dead and therefore they don‚Äôt need the money anymore. Why are you so ride or die for rich people lmao"

2.  You would have to inherit 11.5 million dollars for the federal estate tax to kick in, so hell yeah tax them."
Michigan,fd8owf5,t1_fd6ltgg,1578221140.0,"I mean, not really. Cigarettes stink, and most people at bars will smoke directly outside the doors. Even when walking around downtown areas people are smoking as you walk past them."

homeowners,fd694xm,t1_fd667dm,1578187424.0,"I would still wait until the neighbors do it first. They‚Äôre going to have to do one anyways if they‚Äôre planning on building a house.  If the results aren‚Äôt in your favor, get a second opinion from your own surveyor and find the original survey from the purchase. The neighbors could just be bluffing and hoping the OP caves in."
fatlogic,fd67n4k,t1_fd6046v,1578186716.0,"It‚Äôs usually the manure runoff from farming that gets into the water supply, not necessarily the pesticides(which of course it does) but boiling will remove bacteria like E. coli."

Like wtf is that? You have the address right there, on the mail. Just walk your ass a block over and drop it off, no FB stalking necessary. 

But that‚Äôs not a good story, so let‚Äôs just pretend she was somehow victimized by this stranger who has no idea that she exists"
fatlogic,fd55gs4,t1_fd51a0e,1578174359.0,"I‚Äôve been struggling so hard with this. I want to go full plant based, but also *GAAIIINNNZZZ*. it‚Äôs tough to hit protein and calorie goals that way. 

I also have a gluten intolerance which limits a lot of my options if I choose to eat out. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been telling myself for the last few years. The struggle is real."

fatlogic,fd4ywhw,t3_ek06ip,1578172535.0,"This is what irritates me about the ‚Äúthere is no morality attached to food‚Äù talking point that FA‚Äôs toss around. 

The food you eat has so many different ethical ramifications. Slave labor has been used to catch seafood. Vegetarians chose that lifestyle usually for ethical reasons. Processed food is over packaged and creates a ton of waste with single use plastic. 

It‚Äôs just maddening that they would rather just make up these facts rather than take a look at the damage that overconsumption does to the planet."
Petioles,fd4v71h,t3_ek1eic,1578171390.0,"It‚Äôs ok to make mistakes, and try to be forgiving of yourself. It takes time to make big changes especially if you‚Äôre a heavy user. 

It doesn‚Äôt have to be an all or nothing thing. Find small victories for yourself during the day. Yeah maybe you woke up late and couldn‚Äôt make it to the gym, but you could take a walk and get som fresh air, even if you did get high. It‚Äôs ok to ease into it, and cut down before you cut it off. 

Every time I get high I get anxiety. Every time. I‚Äôm working towards quitting, but I also have a half ounce sitting at the house. I mostly don‚Äôt want to get high, but then I get bored, and I smoke and my heart races. And I regret it. But I have cut way back. I used to get high the second I got home from work, now I wait about 3 hours, or I just smoke before I go to bed."

So she opened up someone else‚Äôs mail, and rather than just drop it off at the correct address, she stalks them on FB, finds out they‚Äôre a fashion model, and is incredibly upset. 

So she anonymously sends her a porn calendar. 

If this story is even true, and not just a ploy to sell weird calendars, the recipient did literally NOTHING to her and doesn‚Äôt even know the OP exists. 

She claims she did return the package, but I‚Äôm on the fence if this is even real and not just one of those arguments you make up in your head while taking a shower."

You‚Äôve made a New Years resolution about eating healthier. Possibly vegetarian, but I see a container that looks like it might be lunch meat up top. I‚Äôm going to guess mid to late 30‚Äôs"
