depression,fdf8bn6,t3_ekwbox,1578355648.0,"What makes you say your depressed? I mean beyond what you said up there? 
Where did it really start and what makes you carry this label of depression, if you don’t mind me asking? 

I’m just wondering, because I felt the same way till I came into some knowledge of some others and pin pointed my own. Would love to help you gain that as well."
depression,fcz9qb7,t1_fcyfjl1,1578096524.0,Actually I don’t. I’m trying to learn. Don’t tell me what I feel. I’m not afraid of going after anything actually. I just don’t see the point.
depression,fcz9k5i,t1_fcyg2wu,1578096423.0,"Then it seems that you and I are on the same page. Pretty much how I feel, except the fact that I don’t ever classify myself as depressed. I may be sad, but depressed is a point of view. 

TV helps me as well. I’m a Movie and TV show buff. 
I have only 4 friends in my life that I actually trust and really only 2 of those with my life. 

But I agree. People don’t make me feel better, they just make my Anxiety run high. Not fun."
depression,fcyca20,t1_fcy765e,1578077927.0,Thank you so much for that insight. I will be researching that.
depression,fcy41cz,t1_fcy1jez,1578074440.0,"Amen. Content is the perfect word for this. That’s about as far as it goes with me.  

But you have to admit, there is lots of “Monkey see Monkey do” out there. 

It’s quite annoying of the amount of human beings that lie to themselves and just become followers."
depression,fcy3f5f,t3_ejihcy,1578074243.0,"I understand completely what your saying. I have no issues with that nor am I against love. I’m just plainly saying that I really don’t have it and I believe others force make themselves believe they have love for many and everything. 

I like things, not a lot but I don’t love them. I may like my relationship, but I don’t love it, I like chocolate, but Again I don’t love it. 
 
If I had it in me I would give it a chance, but to me... it doesn’t exist. Like does however. 

That’s what I meant about running deeply into emotions."
depression,fcy2rj4,t1_fcy1hd2,1578074025.0,"Based on who it is is very correct in my eyes. But I still don’t get that connected. 

I have a wild collection of 4 friends! I’m okay with this. 
But when I don’t go hang out at someone’s place with my GF and or don’t go out to eat with family and friends, I get scolded for it. I’m attacked. 

I’m told I’m depressed and I need help. 
I just don’t find connections with people or things. It’s not exciting to me. It sucks and I can’t wait to be away and back home.  Soooo to me there really is no validation. Just a bunch of people lying to themselves."
depression,fcy1ub6,t1_fcy0zse,1578073596.0,"Okay, let’s say this is the case. I have experienced many things, giving things a chance to not knock it before trying it, and not once have I found love for any of those things or anyone I have done or been around. 

Love is something we force ourselves to believe in. You can have love for someone or maybe something m, but to be head over heels for something or to have emotions of love running that deep for something just does not really exist. 
We train our minds to really believe it does. 
But the fact remains"
depression,fcy0wzp,t1_fcy0ibx,1578073227.0,"Suffer less like how? I really don’t suffer. I enjoy being alone. If I can’t make my own self happy then there is an issue. 

I suffer more when I’m forced to do social events. When I’m forced to act like the rest of society and pretend that I really give a shit. 

The fact is that I don’t. 
 The best part about social events, is the end of it! Can’t wait to get the hell out of here and away from everyone."
depression,fcy0f09,t1_fcxzhf6,1578072966.0,"I think it’s fake. I don’t associate myself with depression, I don’t believe in it. I have my own brain and think about things. Fake is all I come up with. I feel just as much alone around others as I actually do when I am alone. 

I don’t care so much for any of those things, but glad to those who do. No judgment. Just I don’t ever see the point. My logic anyways. 

But I’m glad you enjoy your BF and all but I do not feel anything in any relationship. I just see this world as Monkey see Monkey do. The Majority don’t think about it and jus does it anyways. Others see that and decide to follow along because it seems “normal”. 

I just sit back and wonder...."
depression,fcxzbjj,t1_fcxyrxg,1578072522.0,"Actually, no I don’t know the answer to them. That’s why I’m asking."
depression,fctida0,t1_fctibqj,1577944294.0,😂😂
depression,fcti75x,t1_fct7gx6,1577944125.0,"Well. I don’t mean enjoy enjoy. Not like brings me joy. I’m just saying I would rather see dark clouds and stormy weather. Gloomy look. 

Pretty much referring to weather only on the enjoyment part lol"
depression,fct61do,t1_fct5jut,1577933799.0,"Yes. I would love to say that may work for many people and I’m glad it helped/ helps you bye. 
But unfortunately not me. I don’t see the point in it. That’s one of my most hated activities. Nature is most people’s go to nowadays. 

Hiking, Camping, Fishing,Hunting, Biking, Trailing, Bird Watching, Garden Planting, Freedom Lake swimming, and much more. 

They all do absolutely nothing for me. But then again I have some Trauma related to those types of events. 
Also it still is not stimulating enough for me. 

I’m the type whom can’t stand the sunshine, blue skies, and clear days. I enjoy the exact opposite."
depression,fct5h46,t1_fct5dk0,1577933380.0,And I do agree with that all the way! It really can worsen over time.
depression,fct4uot,t1_fcst365,1577932921.0,"Actually it’s not. It’s a state of mind that we make ourselves believe. You can have depressing moments, and or focus on negativity everyday. Some enjoy that, but depression itself is just a classification. 

Most chemical imbalances lead to Anxiety which is a medical problem that can be identified. Much of the time we associate that with depression. It has just become the new norm to accept this train of thought. Put the two together. Anxiety can lead to being fixated on more depressing moments, and not want to get out of the same cycle we get stuck on. 

They might go hand and hand but not the exact same. We as humans can change things. But would we really be happy not being happy? Probably not..... because that means we fell into Society’s ways which is usually the reason behind the curtain of the cause of Trauma and Anxiety."
depression,fct3w4e,t1_fct38lo,1577932212.0,"They can just me and you like motivation and it gets depressing but that doesn’t mean you are depressed. We don’t have to label ourselves this way, I just don’t think our minds are stimulated enough. 

And you may enjoy things. That’s good, each to their own but other people don’t have to label others depressed just beverage they do not find anything basic or not enjoyable. 

But only you can break yourself out a loop. It sucks but that doesn’t classify you as “Depressed “"
depression,fcsgqc6,t1_fcsgft6,1577916283.0,Very much so! I agree completely. Maybe there needs to be a new standard of what’s evaluated and what’s not.
depression,fcs2zf3,t3_eikk9a,1577910710.0,My mind works like this as well. Nothing really ever makes sense. What’s the point in almost anything at all?
relationship_advice,eigkbal,t3_b0qt38,1552510975.0,Toxic... Yeah I would say they are.. didn't really think about it that way.
