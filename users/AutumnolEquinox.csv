ProgrammerHumor,ff36qr7,t1_ff2k6p0,1579535013.0,"You’d be surprised at how little most Indians live off of. Even the ones that have “good” stable jobs. For example, I have a good friend in the military in India, he makes about 35k rupees a month which translates to about $700 CAD. This is actually considered to be a pretty good salary, like this dude is slightly above middle class depending on where you live. The reason this works for a lot of Indians is the lack of things like property tax and mortgages, insurance policies, etc. All those things just drain your income here in the west even though they have their benefits, like obviously insurance is good. I visited recently and I was really surprised at how little most people live off of. Important thing to note is that it’s not like things are much cheaper there, even basic needs like food are actually only slightly cheaper than the West and things like clothes are similar in price, maybe slightly cheaper due to cheap labour."
