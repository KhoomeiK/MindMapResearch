Documentaries,fel5e04,t1_fel4gyf,1579214425.0,"In terms of repercussions, Japan got off very lightly; with the atomic bombings being judged as just punishment in terms of war. The Tokyo Trials were a show trial, and hardly any of those truly responsible were punished. Tbh, both parties, Japan and the US, had the best possible outcome they could have hoped for. The former was expecting annihilation upon occupation, and the latter was expecting guerrilla warfare from the mountains, due to the Japanese devotion to Emperor Hirohito. But no, The US troops were welcomed like heroes and General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, became leader of this new Japan.

Without going into too much detail, of course there was still huge fallout for the Japanese (see Grave Of The Fireflies), and their freedoms were greatly restricted, and any political or militaristic revolts quickly squashed.

But in the decades following, Japan absolutely flourished, becoming the technological and economical superpower we know today.

facepalm,fel43un,t1_fel2zof,1579213636.0,"Thank you for the insight. For clarity, I pay £9,250 a year for tuition (however, as previously stated this does not need to be repaid until earning around 28k I believe), and receive an extra £4000 p/y in maintenance payments, for living costs. This is also provided by the UK government, so same rules apply. Your level of maintenance depends on your family income. Personally, it covers my rent, but nothing else. for everything else, I rely on savings and parental help. 

All in all, I am grateful for the UK system; even if it doesn't hold a candle to most other European countries.

It's not a necessarily bad thing though, and to be honest I'd never think about such etiquette here on Reddit. It's great that you're thinking about it though.
