I did. You just don't seem to care about them, or are ignoring them.

Trump is detaining everyone that tries to cross the border, and then forcibly separating children from their families. That's nothing something Obama did, and it is something Trump does. The end-result (as I already cited for you and explained multiple times) is more kids in cages.

> You said kids in cages are Trump's issue and not obama's. Stop talking about the general migrant population.

Where else do you believe the kids in cages are coming from, if not from detained migrants at the border?

politics,fdrathl,t1_fdr90hl,1578681862.0,"I never claimed that more *children* were disproportionately detained by one or the other. I asked if *you* were claiming that, since you're absolutely terrible at formulating arguments, and it was unclear what you were trying to prove in the first place.

What I *was* claiming, was that:

1. More *people* (to *include* children) are being detained under Trump than were detained under Obama, and
1. That is due to Trump's zero tolerance policy of criminally detaining everyone that crosses, and
1. Forcibly separating all children from their families, regardless of their circumstance.

Your original claim (in case you've already forgotten) was that Obama somehow originated the present crises at the southwest border. I've spelled out the policy differences between the two administrations for you (you've ignored them). I've provided a visualization of CBP border-crossing detentions over the years (you've ignored them, and falsely conflated detentions with crossings). And this is the third time I've tried to help you (and you probably still don't get it).

To make this super easy for you:

**Obama**: ""I don't care how many people we get trying to cross the border, unless they're existing, known criminals, we're not criminally detaining them. Just send them back.""

**Trump**: ""I don't care how many people we get trying to cross the border, criminally detain them all, and make them defend themselves in court. And while they're detained, separate all of the children from their families, whether we actually need to or not.""

**You**: ""ThIs iS ObAmA's FaULt!!!1!"""

You seem to be really struggling with this. 

Read the same link again that you just told me to read, except this time, scroll down until you get to the chart entitled ""Apprehensions at the southwestern border, by month."" Then re-evaluate what you just said.

Numbers of people crossing =/= number of people being detained. Trump is choosing to detain everyone. That was explicitly *not* an Obama decision.

> As far as kids go, it is YOUR claim that Trump somehow made it worse. Its on you to source your claim.

Children are included in those numbers. If by ""proportion"" you mean that Trump is somehow detaining *less* children than Obama was, then you're free to source that claim, but that's not accurate either.

> Second of all you article says lots of people are crossing illegally, which naturally leads to more people being detained. Duh?

I could see where you would logically deduce that, but again: no. The long-standing border crossing policy up-to and including Obama's tenure was:

1. Check if there's any active warrants out for the individual (arrest them, if there were)

1. Document that they tried to cross the border illegally

1. Send them back over the border (no detention or criminal charges)

By contrast, Trump had a zero tolerance policy of criminally processing every single person that attempted to cross the border, period. Which means criminally detaining them and sending them through the already back-logged immigration court system.

So it's the zero tolerance policy that is leading to more detainments, not ""lots of people crossing illegally."""
