(someone else said neither of these signals is related to the reflex that makes you drop hot things)

talesfromtechsupport,ff2xeyj,t1_ff21jec,1579527678.0,"In school my friends and I would take advantage anytime someone committed a security fauxpa.

The worst was leaving my chromebook open in the library for maybe 90 seconds. I came back, didn't notice anything, kept working. Turns out buddy works in the library. 

Fast forward to that evening sitting in a lab with a group of people I don't know working on a major project for the class. I show my screen to the group over projector. Later once I'd shown my research I opened chrome and left it on since we were discussing and googling things.... Every time I finish searching something I go back and leave it on my homepage. 

About 40min go by and as the meeting comes to an end I start to notice what websites/searches are on my favorites and recently visited tabs.... Just the nastiest porn a sick mind could imagine. It wasn't super noticeable but it'd be visible for half an hour. 

And what am I gonna do? Trying to explain that would just make it worse. 

Despite getting high grades and a lot of personal praise from the group for my work not one of them accepted my LinkedIn invites or spoke to me again once the project was done."

Machinists,fdsiatr,t1_fdshg1m,1578703281.0,"No worries. I don't think it's a stupid question. I think it's a stupid situation. 

 In my experience, even with the 30+ year experienced guys helping me sharpen the cutters. I couldn't ever fix the issue. Every 10 min I'd be a microsecond too late in cutting a chip with scissors or swatting it away and I'd end up having to cut the massive mess off the part with a scalpel and scissors.

Edit: in my experience having a really sharp cutter actually made it harder. You want the cutter to wear in some when tackling a 1-300 part nylon job."

I'm an aspirant insurance agent now and actually using my degree. But I was a machinist in the most janky shop you could imagine for about 9 months.

Edit: we had a 10lb rig that you could fit two nylon parts onto and turn them down at once. It was hectic."

I have a degree in marketing so it hits double hard if this is actual promotional material, fingers crossed that it's not.

Edit. After a couple views this seems like a video game promotion or something. I'd love/hate to know where this video originally came from if anyone has a source."
Machinists,fdsaezp,t3_emuqeq,1578698062.0,Haha I spent so much of 2019 turning this crap to od swatting at it like Lucy in the chocolate factory to keep the chip from getting wrapped around the part.
assholedesign,fdqu38w,t1_fdqki95,1578674899.0,"That's why I said someone with more knowledge about Android should weigh in.

>Surely an app knows whether its in the foreground or not without special permissions?

From what I've read, not all apps remain stable when suddenly interrupted and put to sleep when a call comes in. The permissions are so that the app can know there's a call coming at the same time the phone does and put itself to sleep in an orderly fashion. Otherwise you are trusting that the app can handle the interruption without warning. 

I have a note 8 and there's a noticeable pause in functionality before my phone actually starts showing that I'm receiving a call. I would assume that pause is when everything gets pushed to the background.

>There are a lot of good reasons to need to read your phone state. A game is a great example. You might be doing your thing and playing a game when all the sudden your phone rings. The game needs to step back and let the incoming call notification have control of your screen. The call request can take control (and does) but the game needs to know that so it can stop the action in the background until you get back to it. It can do this when the phone status changes.

As just one example"

assholedesign,fdqi07e,t1_fdqe5dz,1578667156.0,"I'm not an expert. But I think the keyword is ""pause"" the game. Phone calls should interrupt whatever else you are doing, but the game doesn't know that it has been interrupted unless it can check the status of the phone which it needs permission to do.

The way Netflix etc. Uses the phone and the way the phone calls interrupt it don't cause problems so that permission isn't needed.

Perhaps someone else can weigh in on exactly why a game app is different than a video player app when being interrupted for a call."

It takes a few weeks to maybe two months of consistency for it to kick in. But I wake up at 6:30 without an alarm every day. You just have to be consistent on the weekends. Eventually once you get up without an alarm you can even stay up late and still be up at the same time."
