We've only received a handful of death threats. I mean less than one hand. We've had a whole lot of wishes for our death, but very few actual threats. These right wing randos on Twitter all claim they've had death threats from leftists or antifa and I'm sorry I'm just so skeptical. I'm just not buying it. It's not like they can ever produce screenshots. Getting a death threat is actually really freaky. It makes you think through all of your social media and if you can be tracked down. It's not just something you talk about all willy nilly. I'm really not buying it."

TheRightCantMeme,fdo9mq1,t1_fdo8irm,1578601275.0,"Literally not what we're talking about. Yes they should serve a purpose but the purpose doesn't have to be efficiency. Purpose can be tone, or character development, or a lot of things. My point was about necessity. Lots of things in stories aren't needed for the story but they build up other aspects. I hated that specific scene too, but for contrast the baby groot dancing scene at the beginning of Guardians 2 wasn't necessary for the story. It moved nothing along, and was even a distraction from the action that was moving the story forward. If it was cut the story would've made as much sense. Instead it set the tone of parenting and relationships. There can be non necessary kissing that still serves a purpose."
