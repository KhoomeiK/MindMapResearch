Emphasize your willingness to learn, and how you learn. Make them feel like you're so interested in their company that you're willing to learn their entire stack. That says way more than technical skill for an internship position. Document your projects. Projects, no matter how simple, need to be documented and this will show that you have a full understanding of the development lifecycle. This matters more than technical skill IMO. Being friendly and showing genuine interest in the company shows a lot as well.

As for React, you should try to learn it once you have a good understanding of no framework (vanilla) JS. Learn the basics of how it works before your interview to show that you've already done some research and want to learn more. Don't expect yourself to become an expert in anything overnight.

""At no point in his career has Biden proven willing to take the slightest political risk on behalf of workers. His appearances in union halls occur when he needs something from labor. On the other hand, when Biden went to vacation in the Hamptons during the 2011 Verizon strike, workers in the area sought him out “just to possibly get a show of support, a thumb’s-up, a head nod, anything” – to no avail. That same year in Wisconsin, labor leaders specifically asked Biden to come to rally their resistance to the brutal, ultimately successful attack by Scott Walker; Biden declined.""

""Nor does Biden have a public policy record favorable to the working class. In 1977-1978, during unions’ big push for labor law reform, he vacillated for months and sabotaged the proposal with public criticism. He voted for Nafta and supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He authored the punishing 2005 bankruptcy bill, a reward to creditors and punishment to debtors. Worse still, he has been one of the main legislative architects of mass incarceration, a regime that has devastated the heavily policed and punished American working class."""
politics,fdj53xg,t1_fdhvcmo,1578458694.0,"I don't hate Yang. I think he's bringing up conversations that we need to have, especially regarding UBI (Freedom dividend) and automation. That being said, I don't think he's cut out to be president. Most of his policies come back to the freedom dividend, which won't come with the fundamental changes needed to ensure that income won't just flow back up to the top 1%. 

He was also on CNN recently claiming he was for Medicare for All (the title of an actual bill written by Sanders, which removes private insurance in favor of socialized healthcare) but then claimed he didn't want to get rid of private insurance. His argument was that ""there is no bill titled Medicare for All"", when in fact there was, and he was using that title to gain public support while not believing in the spirit of the bill. 

His ideas about how to solve global warming are also concerning to me, as his solution is to essentially let capitalism take care of it. We've tried this solution and it led us nowhere. 

As a whole, I'm done with business owners with zero political experience trying to run government the same way their businesses. Not that I think only people with political experience should enter the race, but not knowing what Medicare for All is when you've been running says a lot about your political insight."
