ForeverAlone,fcb3e8n,t1_fcajxk6,1577581805.0,"Damn son, you need a girl to stalk you. I kid, but god this is so painfully relatable that I chuckled. I also used to literally hide from anyone interested in me. I mentioned it in another comment but what helped me is talking to people online, establishing that someone was definitely interested before meeting them, and being super upfront that I was spooked and shy. Looking into women that are more in their 30s or so will probably help you in this specific aspect as they tend to be more confident and many are turned on by the aspect of ""showing the ropes"". Once you get past the initial one it gets a lot easier to tell anxiety to fuck off."
ForeverAlone,fcb23og,t1_fca52zi,1577581241.0,"Ok I feel like you're trying to be helpful and not a complete asshole but please understand that saying someone is pathetic is shitty as fuck when you need medication to survive. This guy is not pathetic at all. No, medicine doesn't fix everything. Yes, there's still a shitload of work that has to be done outside of it. But there is absolutely nothing wrong with taking meds if they make that fight just a little more bearable, or in my case, even possible in the first place. You're 1000% right that the world doesn't owe anyone anything though, and focusing that it does wastes time and effort you could be using to better yourself or make yourself happy.

Also Joe Rogan is a cool dude but that's the weirdest flex on mental wellbeing I think I've ever heard. Also psychedelics are still medications in some sense so ehhh?"
ForeverAlone,fcb15uu,t1_fcam0o3,1577580667.0,"Bruh what? This is awful advice. First of all, that post was not like ""hey I have this great idea and I don't need uni to make it work"" or ""I value life experience more than school"" like the case is with a lot of successful dropouts, it's ""fucks sake I'm overwhelmed"". HUGE difference. It's not about ""what you desire"" it's about survival. And dropping out from depression is likely to just make someone more depressed. Many people are successful without college but that shit is not easy and the vast majority of people are less successful without it. That's not to even mention the fact that finding a companion is usually heavily affected by societal status, including education. Yea, finding a companion is important, but neglecting other things in life to do that can backfire tremendously."

ForeverAlone,fcazuar,t1_fcatfer,1577579878.0,"It's not impossible, it's difficult. And it's completely impossible if you don't bother trying. Mindfulness and self worth ain't magic, it's hard work. And that's when you don't struggle constantly with profound mental illnesses like I do. I have no idea what world you live in where girls are throwing themselves at men but I have seen that happen maybe once to an extremely conventionally attractive guy I know. The rest of the time it's guys asking, getting rejected, not taking it personally (kicker!), and moving on the next one until you encounter someone interested. Gambling effort on likely candidates helps. The magic of hookup apps means you can hundreds of such interactions in a short period of time.

Even in modern society, women are discouraged and shamed from being initiators. I'm much more aggressive than most girls and even still deal with a lot of embarrassment and potential rejection for being an initiator. A lot of men are even actively turned off by it. You would probably be shocked at how many women you encounter are actually secretly attracted to you but would never have the gall to say anything.

I meant the ""take care of yourself"" as a more general statement, I didnt assume you weren't. You should treat your mental health with the same kind of effort you put to your physical health. 

As for finding an actual partner, vs just a hookup, that shit is hard for everyone even if you're just a boring normal person wanting another boring normal person. I feel you on people only showing up once you're successful bc damn I've had issues with that. As for that part on its own I wish you the very best of luck because finding someone you click with that isn't just trying to take advantage of you is a huge pain in the ass and sure seems impossible sometimes. I still don't blame everyone else for this- I don't take good care of my physical health, for one thing- but it sure would be nice to have someone that loves me for more than what I can do for them."
ForeverAlone,fcarckk,t1_fcaq0pr,1577575098.0,"One, stop basing your self esteem on other people. Even if that had nothing to do with getting laid (which it 1000% does) other people fucking suck and your happiness should never be reliant on that. I don't care if you are the most beautiful man on this planet, you will always fail if you count on others like that. ALWAYS. 

Who tf said anything about ""you don't even have to think about it""? If that's what your doing, it makes perfect sense that you're failing. That's stupid. Idk what world you live in where people just exist and have girls falling over them, but come the fuck off of it. You have to have a decent personality (spoiler: you don't have one, you're a whiny shit who obsesses over sex and blames everyone else for your problems). You have to take care of yourself. And you have to put effort into it, not sit around and bitch about how genetics are everything. 

So yea, I guess you're right about dog shit, because nobody is going to fuck someone who spends their time whining about how unfair life is that they don't just snap their fingers and have women bending over for them."
ForeverAlone,fcap385,t1_fcamwas,1577573736.0,Also thanks for ignoring the rest of the advice I gave and just focusing on the part about getting laid. That attitude has a LOT to do with your situation.
ForeverAlone,fcaoriv,t1_fcamwas,1577573540.0,"Oh fuck off with that. I forgot that people actually legitimately believe that you should just snap your fingers and have some perfect pretty little piece of ass appear and swoon over you.

That's such a dumbass self defeating assertion. Some people will fuck a pile of dog shit if it's marketed properly. It takes effort though, and the decision to be a man and accept rejection without being like ""ugh women only want chads!!!1!2"" is a big part of that."
mildlyinfuriating,fcao28e,t1_fca61hg,1577573104.0,"What data do you base these assumption on? As I mentioned, that's only one example. There's a million other little things that can lead to similar results. I am a little floored, honestly, at the assertion that most homeless people have somewhere to go and instead choose not to shower."
mildlyinfuriating,fc9wcpl,t1_fc9tu58,1577559161.0,"So there's different brands of hoarding, mine is mostly failure to clean. My attachment to the stuff was important, but not devastating like it is for some people. I was bad about like ""oh but that's valuable!"". My issue was moreso that I have a really difficult time making myself do tasks I am anxious about doing. And by really difficult I mean OCD ritual type compulsive avoidance. So if I let cleaning get a little out of hand, then I feel anxious and have a hard time starting. The difficulty of starting the task is proportional to the anxiety I feel about it, so with the cleaning, that shit snowballs fast. All of a sudden I'm living in a horrifyingly filthy house, surrounded by trash and cat shit, and absolutely overwhelmed by the idea of trying to claw my way out.

""Quit"" is a strong word because I will always have to remain vigilant to not let it happen again. It's a real fight to clean most days. When I have the money, I will be hiring a cleaning service for every other week or so so that there is a time that I must have it somewhat cleaned up or will have to pay for more cleaning. Ideally, they would just come and do things I don't want to do, like dusting or cleaning the toilet/shower. 

The biggest reason though is that I'm now on meds which makes it possible to fight these feelings instead of just being helpless. But it's still always a fight. Medication also stops my compulsive shopping, and that helps a lot. As for other addictions, I've been able to elimate most of them except for sugar and binge eating. That one's been a real bitch to fight and is having severe negative consequences on my health. Even that is somewhat getting under control, but as with hoarding, the struggle is neverending."

mildlyinfuriating,fc9iyk1,t1_fc8wwf1,1577553349.0,"As a thought experiment, I encourage you to spend some time talking to a (willing participant) homeless person about how easy these actually are to access. I was shocked to find that despite the existance of these programs, the nightmarish difficulty of accessing then given even what would normally be a minor setback.

For example, imagine you are a homeless person. Say your wallet is stolen so you have no money and no ID. No vehicle, no job, no friends or family. Most shelters do not allow people with no ID. Besides, the men's shelters are full every night, so you can choose to either wait in line to get a spot or spend that time looking for a job or begging for food. It gets into the single digits at night, weather wise. You have a phone right now but it will be cut off in 3 days. Once that's up, you won't be able to get a job because they won't be able to call you. You are in a city that arrests people for sleeping in the street, and the only places where they don't are very crime infested. You don't qualify for EBT because you have to have proof of 30 days work first. Subsidized housing is also unavailable if you do not have proof of income. You have been spending all your days looking for work, but you smell weird, look scary, and have a hard time talking to people. Job placement can't help you if have no ID, and will take a significant commission off your income if they get you a job. You do get a job finally, a part time manufacturing job that will leave you in significant pain at the end of the day for about a month as your body adapts to standing on concrete and making repetitive movements 8 hours a day. Eventually it will break down your body completely, but that's down the road.

Now imagine the same situation, but say your situation is further complicated by a disability, mental illness, a child, a pet, or an addiction. 

It's just very overwhelming, really. Social services appear to very accessible from the outside but when it comes to actually stepping into their shoes, things are very very different."

ForeverAlone,fc9dqs8,t3_egph5f,1577551091.0,"Man, I really feel for you. My dx list currently is GAD/ADHD/bipolar/OCD. Side note, I had never heard of SCT but I just looked it up and wow cool there's more symptoms I deal with. I have times where I can't leave my house and times where I hoard because I can't find the right Ritual to let me clean. There's a million little examples like those all the time. I am incredibly close to completing my MS degree but have spent the last year racking up debt and distress bc I can't get over that last tiny little speed bump to finish. 

So it's pretty obvious to me at this point that a fully neurotypical person could never really understand the kind of shit I go through just to exist, and it's hard to imagine spending my life with someone who doesn't have any inkling what it's like when your brain fucking hates you. But at the same time I've spent so much time and effort working on my mental health that I have very little patience for people who haven't. Plus two wildly mentally ill people could either be great or a recipe for complete disaster. And all of that is just a layer on top of the normal shit people go through trying to find their person. 

So. I digress. As for advice.

1. Take care of yourself first. I get the fear that you feel like you gotta get a relationship now, but that shit is messy and stressful and can fuck with your mental state (and therefore classes) even more. When you get school breaks, that's the time to look for somebody. 

2. The real world sucks a lot less than college in a lot of ways. I am super averse to planning ahead and thought i would hate having a set schedule and routine but it has helped me so much. I feel better and take better care of myself. Not only does that help me, but I also feel more appealing to others. That confidence boost alone helps tremendously. So just keep that as the light at the end of the tunnel and do everything in your power to buckle down and finish. 

3. I'd say look for a hookup if you're not super averse to that kind of thing. It takes a lot less time, you don't have to care what they think about you, they can be someone you don't really want to be with (which is a hell of a lot harder to find). I lost my virginity to someone I really didn't care about and I'm glad because it kinda fucks with your head and makes you cling to that person hard. Because it was someone I didn't really like, I was able to get away from that and focus on other things. Then, with that experience behind me, I felt a lot more confident to pursue people that I was actually interested in later. And who knows, sometimes a hookup turns out to be cool and worth dating. But the pressure to make sure of that beforehand is eliminated, and for me, that also makes me feel more confident. As for obtaining such a thing, I do online dating/apps and pretty much outline beforehand that the express purpose is doing the dirty. That eliminates a lot of the anxiety of ""oh god are they actually wanting to do a thing or am I just crazy""

4. This one is a hard pill to swallow (ha) but an important one. For me though once i finally accepted it, it was kinda a relief. You will never, ever be cured. Medication will never make you feel like a totally normal person. Everything you do in life will continue to be colored by these monsters breathing down your neck, and it will always be a struggle. The only thing that medication will do is make it more possible to fight them on a level playing field. I don't say that to minimize the importance of the meds- I literally cannot function without mine (Effexor, Lamictal, and sometimes Vyvanse, if you're curious)- but even with them I still have to work so hard to do normal people shit. I found peace (and functionality) in accepting that, rather than trying a million new cocktails all the time and being constantly disappointed when I didn't wake up and just function. I found ways to trap myself into doing things I don't like, and reward myself after. I learned to accept myself as I am, and stop being so mean to myself (spoiler: that makes everything worse). It's kinda like training a dog except you are the dog and also the trainer. Stupid analogy but when your brain's neurotransmitter and reward pathways are fucked up, you have to kinda break things down to a really basic level and learn how to make it work for you. 

5. Be kind to yourself. This is so important for your own happiness, health, the way that you treat others, and the way others see you. It also has an enormous effect on your ability to get into and keep relationships. You are NOT a failure. Despite mental illness, you made it to college. Even a lot of neurotypical people don't do that. Despite dropping classes once, you still went back. That shit is HARD. You can do this. 

6. Don't think there aren't women in this same situation. This one is hard to believe, I know. But just because you don't see them doesn't mean they're not there. I know girls in their late 20s who have also never had a kiss. Statistically, this is actually a phenomenon that is increasing as more people decide to focus on education than on starting a family. 

Anyway this got super long, sorry. I just know what it's like to feel so isolated from people because your brain is so different. Btw, finding friends who have the same conditions helped me a lot. Just protect yourself from those who will try to drown you to stay afloat. Also, being a man has jack shit to do with getting your dick wet. 

So tl;dr stay in school, love yourself, fuck bitches, make money. Mental illness sucks but if I can do it I know you can too."

Or perhaps not the first, but the first one I listened to since it wasnt coming from someone biased toward the cattle industry. After all, that carbon (utilized by land animals) was already present in a balanced carbon cycle until we started pumping old bones out from their sleep. Additionally, ruminants allow us to cultivate land for food that is unsuitable for food crops, and allows for easier management of topsoil erosion. There is much to be done in terms of industrial greenhouse gas production that could have a much greater impact than focusing on cow farts."
