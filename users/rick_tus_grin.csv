These only give me pause when they‚Äôre experienced by more than a single person."

TwoXChromosomes,fes4flx,t3_eqfha7,1579361318.0,"Poor girl. That‚Äôs a garbage news site though. They have to point out that one of the two girls who got attacked on the night bus last year was not gay but in fact bisexual. Like that matters. She was targeted because she was showing affection to someone of the same sex, but pink news have to point out that sometimes she is attracted to men. 
Also they misspelled friends as fiends which is just great."
gaming,fer2isf,t1_feq2i6i,1579348892.0,Is it bad that we both recognise Tesco without any actual identifying signage? For me the shelf edge labels and colour of the produce bins are the giveaway.

I‚Äôm free most what evenings and I‚Äôm based smack bang in the middle of the UK. I like playing standard races in non standard classes (my gnome Druid was one of my all time favourites).
todayilearned,fdkqv8k,t1_fdkqjpd,1578509260.0,"Oh there is definitely a correlation between the rural-ness of where you live and the prevalence of drunk driving, and this would raise the levels in bigger countries. But I think that drunk driving is still more frowned upon in rural UK than it is in rural U.S. but perhaps I‚Äôm wrong."
todayilearned,fdklibb,t3_eltofe,1578506028.0,"I find it insane how acceptable drunk driving is in other countries (I‚Äôm from the UK). If you told people you were going to drive home after drinking here you‚Äôd get shit from others almost universally, is pet much never condoned and growing up it was just a given you‚Äôd never do it. 
I can‚Äôt say the same of the US, and especially South Africa."

AskReddit,fcq64ur,t1_fcq2wal,1577879577.0,"Not really. The fewer ingredients ones have a high proportion of expensive things.

blankies,fc3e88s,t1_fbn1p2d,1577387851.0,"I think there was something more interesting possible through Rey being a no one. Let‚Äôs just take her as a random force sensitive person, like others the Galaxy throws up form time to time. Then consider her as a more powerful Jedi than Kylo, who feels the universe should bow before his bloodline, but was frustrated at the weakness of his abilities. 
This was all possible after TFA, but was clearly never the plan. 
For me this story, with the actual nobody opposing the only other force user (the scion of a powerful dynasty who has failed to live up to his parents and therefore gone searching for forbidden shortcuts to greatness), is far more interesting than what we got."
