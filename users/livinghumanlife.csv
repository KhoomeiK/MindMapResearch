bipolar,ff275gx,t1_ff26t2v,1579495735.0,"Not saying the have to be buried in shame.. but to flaunt a mental illness as if it isn’t exactly that..is how u get people taking light of the illness.. it’s how people go about saying “ur bipolar” when it’s just a person in a legit bad mood for a real reason.. it’s not a joke it’s not cute it’s not funny it’s ugly it’s a bad mental illness that has no cure..

And I’m aware that people aren’t actually ever 100% stable I guess I shouldn’t of said it like that.. but it’s they are posting while stable.. I know how up and down this shit is first hand. I think u know the post I’m talking about.. and that’s what I’m aiming at."

I use him obviously for the 2SP.. but honestly he makes some amazing saves I can’t say it’s just him cuz even a silver goalie will do some wild shit sometimes but I’ll obviously never get rid of him.

NHLHUT,fdfoas8,t1_fdfmfsw,1578366306.0,It’s just they are taking advantage of easily addicted people and it’s gross.. not only does the game take up ur time.. but most people on this subreddit let it take their money.. lots of it..

NHLHUT,fdfm12q,t1_fdfljrb,1578364819.0,Why tho.. just play the rivals and u legit get enough for gold collectibles in trade in the 50.. and u can get some good pulls.. I haven’t spent shit and my team is decent AF.. all my good players are unreadable besides a Zetterberg I got from the 1 gold trade in.. can’t imagine ever spending money on this game again.. very happy they are moving away from that shit.
