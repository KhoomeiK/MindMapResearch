FoodAddiction,ff9mlbv,t1_ff9lykg,1579716155.0,"Your question was: How do YOU overcome food addiction when YOU have to eat.

Yes I used my personal experience because it was what helps me deal with the same thing you do.

You could take it or leave it. That was all. I wish you luck with your endeavors and hope you get help from someone here"
FoodAddiction,ff9l5qp,t1_ff9jttb,1579715312.0,"I absolutely did answer your question, and if what worked for me doesn't work for you that's fine.

I strongly recommend you get professional help to guide you physically and mentally."
FoodAddiction,ff9gr73,t3_esejwm,1579712671.0,"For me personally I had to completely overhaul my lifestyle. I made the word ""moderation"" my mantra. I still have slip ups, and then I pick myself back up and keep going. I'm working on walking the path instead of dealing with everything as extremes and seeing actions in life as only successes/failures.

This path started for me when I started to get health issues at a fairly young age and had to face the reality that my binge eating/food addiction is making me miserable and will probably kill me and I had to sink or swim. Having a healthy and happy life is more important to me than anything and I am the one in complete control of that."
loseweight,ff947kb,t3_escsur,1579704442.0,"How tall are you/how much do you weigh? 1200 is way too low for most people and it's hard to stick to, especially if you will be going to the gym. I used to eat that few calories, then upped them to 1400-1600 and I am losing weight and feel much more satiated."
WholeFoodsPlantBased,ff6znvl,t3_erzvl1,1579638184.0,I mean technically too much of anything is bad (if all you ate was carrots day in and out) but yeah people are so weird about others eating healthy. It's an insecurity and makes them feel better for eating processed foods.

witchcraft,fezm7vx,t1_fezh0xe,1579458915.0,"The continent is burning down because of our acts as the human race. The fires got put out which is great, but now the floods have started. Magic and manifestation comes through our physical mundane acts every day. Being aware, being less wasteful, choosing smart food, helping others every day, etc. That is where we act on a grand scale if we truly want to change things.

Being proactive, not reactive."
witchcraft,feze0uu,t1_fezbxvd,1579456384.0,The OP is not finger wagging. It's called being careful what you wish for. The whole reason this drought happened in the first place was because of climate change and what we humans have done to the earth so trying to put a panicked bandaid on it hastily without much forethought can add to the problem.

Most people there are there for themselves too so they are either concentrating on their workout or they are super supportive of others coming in and getting the work done just like they are (no matter their fitness level).

Find a gym that seems like a community and then don't think too much, just go out there and do it."

heathenry,fefsuxj,t3_eow5qt,1579064173.0,"YOU are the true altar. A physical one is nice, it's just a physical representation of your internal work. It is not necessary to have but if it helps you connect, then absolutely do what you can for it. A birthday candle and a shot glass could work if that's what you can swing right now. At the end of the day, it's the effort that counts and how you best connect."

He used to stand outside of class and wait for me, push me against a wall and grope me or say awful things to me. I couldn't do anything because he was popular and I was a quiet nobody. If I said anything, it would make it worse. I will never forget those awful moments before class.

After he died a lot of people from my hometown mourned him saying what a great guy he was. I am not happy he died but all I remember is how he treated me in 9th grade and it is still with me.

Thank you for sharing your story. It's unfortunate he got sick and died but kids know when they are being assholes, and I'm sure he knew and didn't care. I have no sympathy for bullies.

At the end of the day, being kind to eachother is important."

Witch,fcurihv,t3_eiz4om,1577987025.0,"That is awesome! Reiki is a good place to start. Check out udemy.com and look up Lisa Powers Reiki course.

Polarity therapy, chakras and meridians are others good places to study as well. There are so many avenues to explore :)

I am a massage therapist and I specialize in energy healing. A couple things I have learned:

•Intimately understanding death and pain as healing is essential. So many energy healers are all about love and light and ignore the ""darker"" side of things. Only concentrating on love and light is nice and fluffy, but incomplete for true healing.

•Never heal anyone who does not approve it or ask for it, even when we want to help them or send it out to them. They must actively be accepting of it. 

I am very excited for you and your new path!! Your gut will direct you exactly where you need to go and what to study."
awakened,fctk1qb,t3_eipon0,1577946059.0,"You need to sit in her shoes for a bit. She asked you for one thing to help her out and you got her something else because her original choice wasn't good enough in your eyes. That is where her ""selfish"" comment came from. I'm not saying you had to buy her the milk and sacrifice your morals but knowingly getting her something else that she didn't want is not the nicest. Your heart was in the right place but misguided.

Also from your post it comes off as you are completely looking down on her (even if that is not your intent). She isn't dumb. She is a lot older than you and isn't as naive or helpless as you think she is but she absolutely sees that judgment coming from you.

Go hug your mom, tell her you love her and leave it at that.

Her direction is not yours nor your responsibility."

One big thing I have learned is that you need to enjoy the now. It is so easy to get caught up with the future and what it's going to be like. Be in the now. Not only does it make life more enjoyable, it helps to keep you going to reach your goals."
