No loud voices or sounds, no stress, no judgment, just twenty-four hours of safety and quiet."

Makes me feel...  sophisticated and elegant.  You know, despite the fact I'm actually a gross gremlin."

TwoSentenceHorror,fd4z7ls,t1_fd4snnu,1578172636.0,"The first person in the story is dead.  The kitten has gone a few days without being fed, so he is hungry.  When cats starve after their human has died, they tend to eat the human, and they usually start with the lips.  The kitten in this story is hesitant about eating his human, but the human doesn't protest, so it must be fine.  He's hungry, after all.

The people who will find the body of the kitten's human will be horrified when they see that he's eaten his human's face, but the human hopes that they will forgive the kitten for doing what he could to not starve to death.

The first sentence is phrased as if someone is being kissed by someone trying to be a little more daring (nibbling in stead of kissing), tricking the reader into thinking that ""he"" is a human, only to be surprised to find that ""he"" is in fact a starving kitten eating his human's face.

I hope this clears things up."

If you marry Alex and you're a guy, you even get different or additional dialogue from grandpa George!"
