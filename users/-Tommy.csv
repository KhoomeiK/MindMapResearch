Sanders wants to say no to this then come up with a better counter deal. 

Warren's plan gets immediate aid then will be better later. 

Sanders plan gets no aid now but (hopefully) better sooner. 

They both agree this deal is not ideal and will result in things being marginally better. It's just two different views."

Curries would be great for you then! Something like masaman curry has no spice to it, it's a brown potato and peanut curry! 

When doing the sauteed vegis they also bring a good amount of liquid to the dish so them and the rice with tofu and some soy sauce is not a ""dry"" food!

Edit: sesame seeds, furikake, and dried seaweed also make wonderful toppings! Some furikake has egg powder so watch for that allergen."
shittyfoodporn,fdqdy70,t1_fdq9yc3,1578664143.0,"Throw some oil in a pan and saute some vegis (I just buy a frozen mix from Costco). Have it with some rice and Gochujang or LoaGonMa. Gochujang is a spicy chilli paste that should be available most supermarkets in the Asian food section. LGM is a chilli bean oil that's amazing and should be in some Asian food sections and every Asian market. 

Otherwise I also like to throw it in a soup or a curry! Curry can usually be bought in a starter kit where you basically just ass water to get a curry sauce. Throw it on rice with some steamed potatoes cubes and tofu. You've got yourself a really easy, filling, and hearty meal!"

The water inside prevents it from sucking up flavors but when you get the water out it absorbs flavors more. The soy sauce helps give it an umami flavor from the start!

DCcomics,fdayr5q,t3_ekh28x,1578251898.0,"So you'll never be able to get it all there's always going to be some references to something else that will throw you off. Honestly, you can usually just blow past it or accept it for what it is. The best way to be ""caught up"" in the universe would be something like:

Crisis on Infinite Earths: the ""pre crisis"" continuity was a multiverse of stories and then they got smushed into one. I'd read a summary of this because it's very dense and hard for a new reader. 

History of the DC Universe: it's included in the deluxe edition and maybe the normal? It's a rundown of the history of the DC Universe by the same team that did Crisis. 

The bulk of our popular stories occur here. 

Batman Year one, Knightfall, any 80s/90s bat book. 

Flash by Waid, Morrison, and John's. 

Wonder Woman by Perez

Death and Return of Superman

Green Lantern Green Arrow

JLA by Morrison

Then we get to Identity Crisis. This is a polarizing story that kicked off the darker edgier 90s comics, it's important though. 

Next we come to Infinite Crisis and 52. Infinite Crisis is a big thing so honestly, just grab the Omnibus. 52 is the aftermath. 

After this point we have classics such as John's Green Lantern (which has some pre-reading to it that I will happily share then read the 3 omnis) and Morrison's Batman. 

Before Morrison's Batman you might want to read 7 Soldiers of Victory as it ties into our next big event, Final Crisis (prepare to be confused).

After Final Crisis Morrison's Batman wraps up and Flash Rebirth by Geoff John's happen. At this same time Brightest Day and then Flashpoint happen. 

After Flashpoint we have the New 52. 

After New 52 we get Convergence, skip that and read a summary, it's trash. 

The only real important thing we get from Convergence is Superman:Lois and Clark. 

Finally we have Rebirth. The only ""important"" stories would be New 52 Action Comics by Morrison and all the New 52 Justice League. Fun stories include Snyder's Batman and the first 7 volumes of Wonder Woman.

After Rebirth comes Metal then No Justice then Snyder's Justice League (about to wrap up the 38 issue run and it clearly leading to the next event). 

You can then cap it with Doomsday Clock.


I may have things a little off here but this should give you a pretty good gist of the whole DC universe. Then when you read books you can kinda tell where they slot into the timeline."

Reddit won't hear that though.
TopMindsOfReddit,fcqqiso,t1_fcpjri1,1577890597.0,"A ton of his later songs are all remorseful and about how he knows he was an awful person and wants to be better. 

[Getting Better song,](https://youtu.be/EGlo9LzmOME) and [lyrics. ](https://genius.com/The-beatles-getting-better-lyrics) .

""But it was a Beatles song, it wasn't even fully written by him!""

Quote from on the lyrics page:

However, the song still dwelt on darker themes, such as domestic abuse. This is rooted in Lennon’s past, his own transition from a violent oulook on life to a peaceful on reflected in the lyrics of the song. In the last major interview before his death, Lennon explained:

“It is a diary form of writing. All that ‘I used to be cruel to my woman, I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved’ was me. I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn’t express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace, you see. It is the most violent people who go for love and peace. Everything’s the opposite. But I sincerely believe in love and peace. I am a violent man who has learned not to be violent and regrets his violence. I will have to be a lot older before I can face in public how I treated women as a youngster.”"

Lyrics:

I was feeling insecure

You might not love me anymore

I was shivering inside

I was shivering inside

Oh I didn't mean to hurt you

I'm sorry that I made you cry

Oh my I didn't want to hurt you

I'm just a jealous guy"
