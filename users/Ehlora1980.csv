Any reputable dispensary will know exactly what you are talking about."

I also take opiates for pain and find when I dont smoke, the breakthrough pain that the opiates dont deal with is cured by a quick puff. My stomach is ridiculously sensitive and a bong hit is enough to get rid of those symptoms for hours. I have also used it for migraine treatment and appetite stimulation."

Yes, the Switch is awesome. It's just so portable, and is a fantastic system over all. I totally recommend Zelda:breathe of the wild, or strait up Mario stuff. 


Dont listen to the haters, they just trying to be superior. Ignore that shit and do what you think is best for your child.

We didnt get labour started with the bumpy road, but had a super fun time and made memories. Can't believe it was a decade ago."

My second I smoked a bit more, as the morning sickness was worse, and he's a rambunctious, intelligent, tenacious, 10 y/o with a few social issues we are working on and a deep love of all things furry/feathery.
