mildlyinteresting,feki0je,t1_fekcucr,1579200456.0,"When I was at basic training, there was a day where I had an insanely sharp, stabbing pain in my abdomen right where my appendix is. Not wanting to freak out in case I was fine, I told my drill sergeant that I didn’t know what was wrong but I was in extreme pain and showed him where the pain was. He immediately thought I had appendicitis and took me to the hospital to get checked out. The X-ray and CT scan came back fine showing that I just had a strained muscle. 

Here’s where it gets fun: I knew my drill sergeant liked me. I wasn’t one to bitch and moan, just followed orders and didn’t question why we did some seemingly dumb shit. I decided to play a joke on him. 

He came into my curtained off room and said “So what’s the deal with you?” I replied “I... I’m not sure but it doesn’t sound good.” His tone getting somewhat worried, “What doesn’t sound good?” “I don’t remember what they called it but it doesn’t sound like I have long.” Now he’s freaking out, “WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DONT HAVE LONG?! WHAT THE FUCK?! WHERES A FUCKING DOCTOR AT?! SOMEBODY COME TELL ME WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH MY TRAINEE!” Nurse comes in, “Sergeant, what’s going on?” “What the FUCK is wrong with him? I brought him here because I thought his appendix was going to burst and now he’s saying a doctor told him he doesn’t have long?!” Nurse looks at my paperwork, “Uh, he’s fine. He can go back to training. He’s just got a strained muscle.” I start laughing my ass off, which was exceptionally painful because of the strained muscle, and he says “You son of a bitch. You got me. You got me good.” And then he starts laughing. 

The other trainee that was with me, because we couldn’t go anywhere alone, almost burst out laughing when our drill sergeant started freaking out. We had a good laugh about this and from that day on, my drill sergeant would ask me how my appendix was. 

Tl;dr drill sergeant thought I had appendicitis, I didn’t, played a joke on him, he freaked out, we laughed a lot."

AskReddit,fc4xlg7,t3_eg7ej0,1577432762.0,"I wouldn’t say this is weird but it was definitely an interaction I don’t ever care to have again. 

I had just come back from a 10 day suspension. Another student thought I wouldn’t do the same thing I was suspended for to him because I was supposed to be on my best behavior. He was wrong. I did the thing and my band teacher physically grabbed me by my collar, pulled me aside, and with the most angry tone I’ve ever heard, mind you I’ve been through basic training for the Army and he still takes the cake, he screams “what the fuck is the matter with you”. I was shocked because this man who had pulled me out of class numerous times to talk about my home life and tried everything he could to help me had been pushed to his limits and was now blowing up at me. 

To be fair, I understood. He cared about his students. Really, truly cared. He noticed I’d been behaving differently early on because I had two different band classes that he was the teacher for. Every three days, I had five band classes plus the time after school for marching band. He knew me. He spent hours, days, and weeks listening to me talk about how much I hated my home life. He sat there and consoled me when I cried in his office. He’d write notes for my teachers saying that he needed to talk to me and excuse me from class. He put in the effort to help me understand things about life. He’d sit with me during other teachers office hours because I wasn’t doing well in school and he’d translate “I don’t understand this shit. Why the fuck do I need to know this” to “can you explain this a different way instead of telling him the way he doesn’t understand over and over”. He was the best teacher ever."

AskReddit,fc4vdrr,t3_eg7gfb,1577429949.0,"I spent my whole life being raised to worship the Christian God. In fact, in the words of my dad, “All others are fakes. They don’t exist.” It’s shocking how he could say that with such confidence and be unable to prove the existence of his God, himself without saying “you have to have faith”.
In the Christian bible, Jesus talks about doing good things, being better than you were yesterday, being a good role model; all things that decent human beings do without needing to be told from a Pastor. 
Christianity says that humans have free will. I believe that because nobody can control what I do. Only I control what I do. The same is reciprocated by me to others. That’s just a known fact. 
Something that dawned on me a few years ago when my grandpa passed away: if God wants people to have a positive impact on others, why would he take my grandpa away from the world. He was the kindest, most loving, most encouraging, most generous, most influential, and most selfless man I’ve ever met. At the same time, another grandpa who was the most racist, vile, hateful, and most selfish man I’ve ever met was allowed to live. The former didn’t go to church, but, he was incredibly friendly and caring. The latter went to Sunday mass, Wednesday mass, all the other mandatory days, and prayed routinely. One helped. The other was helped. One loved. The other loathed. One was empathetic. The other needed others to feel empathy for him. One gave compliments every chance he saw. The other degraded every chance he saw. That doesn’t show me that religion is true to its word. 
This one is a bit more cynical but it furthers the point: if all bibles, Books of Mormon, Qurans, and all other religious texts were destroyed, in 1,000 years, there’d be no evidence to rewrite those texts. If all science textbooks, articles, and all other scientific documents were destroyed, in 1,000 years, they’d all be back because of the fact that science knows no timeframe. 
Often times, I see people, albeit from older generations, claiming that science is a lie because it doesn’t prove the existence of God. I don’t see scientists trying disprove the existence of God because they believe in science. 
When people want to talk to me about religion or politics, I expect the same thing: tell me why you believe you’re right. Don’t tell me why they’re wrong."
