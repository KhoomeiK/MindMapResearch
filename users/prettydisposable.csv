toronto,fepctos,t1_fep029c,1579317372.0,They say keyboards have more germs than toilets. At least I can see custodians cleaning the washrooms with disinfectant regularly. Can't say the same for poles and seats.

toronto,feb4quh,t3_eobrgq,1578955385.0,"Submission statement: This is a map of buildings with at least 5 stores or services that can be accessed by a covered path from a Toronto Transit Commission subway station. Icons are used to indicate common types of services and are found near the names of buildings that have them. Rate, hate, pontificate.

Release history:

* (1.0) Posted 2020 January 13.
* (1.1) Finished [2020 January 17](https://i.imgur.com/vz5zsV9.png). Added alteration and hairdressing services. Various corrections and additions.

&nbsp;

I’m particularly interested in feedback that points out stuff I’ve missed and service categories that I should consider. I hope leaving out station names because of clutter issues isn’t too problematic. Dining has been left out since pretty much every building here has places that serve food and drinks. A few buildings have been consolidated like the PATH’s connections and 777 Bay (connected to College Park, both accessible via College Station).  Aside from disqualified locations (e.g. 460 University Avenue: connected to St. Patrick but doesn’t have enough stores/services), there are locations missing due to construction such as Yonge-Eglinton Centre (due to the Crosstown) and Fairview Mall (renovation of the previous Sears location). This map is easier to update since there aren’t as many locations. For now, it’s time for other projects, including a big map that I hope to release in time for spring/summer.

It was nice to be able to do “field research” for a map again, gave me a chance to stretch the ol’ legs during the holidays. Not a fan of rain, so this is something I want to be a subject matter expert on. Really jealous of the people who live around Line 4, so many things they can do while protected from precipitation. Now go out there and put those 2 hour transfers to good use!"
