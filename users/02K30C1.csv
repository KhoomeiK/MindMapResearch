explainlikeimfive,fdwa5og,t3_en80q6,1578756631.0,"On a basic level, to sing well you have to sing the correct pitches at the correct times. A well trained singer can hear the pitch they are supposed to hit, and know if their voice is slightly high or low (sharp or flat) and adjust as they go. They also hit the notes at the correct times, not late or early, and hold them for the full duration they’re supposed to. A poor singer may not know they are slightly out of tune, they may be slightly early or late on notes, bend into pitches rather than stepping into them, or cut notes short. 

On a more advanced level, a good singer will adjust their volume to match the shape of the melody. They may add vibrato on long notes. They’ll definitely breathe in between phrases, not in the middle of them. Poor singers may try to add too much vibrato, or add runs/extra notes to cover the fact that they’re not comfortable."

Amber,fcuuvl8,t3_eiiaqa,1577989008.0,"I discovered the RPG at Gen Con in 1991. Eric Wujcik was conducting several seminars at the convention about the game he was designing, and I signed up for one. This was before the game was officially released, so we created characters using photocopied basic rules he provided, and played a short game with them. The attribute auction with 30+ players was pretty wild. I signed up for another couple sessions with him at the following years Gen Con too. He was incredibly passionate about the game, and about role playing in general. 

Some of the things he said that first session still stick with me. For example, describing how to play without dice. He gave an example of someone needing to contact the players via trump call to ask a favor. Many GMs might roll a die to see which player would get called. Eric said “get into the mind of the character. He’s not gonna roll a die to see who he calls. He’s going to pick whoever he thinks is the biggest chump” 

After that I had an Amber campaign running with friends for the next 8 years or so. We would play that in between WH40K and good old AD&D."
