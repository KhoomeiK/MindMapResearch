IsItBullshit,fctzi92,t1_fctthoz,1577967116.0,It seems to be rather genius OR rich...not sure about other ivy league institutions in the US but I doubt it would be very different. I work at an Australian uni that is in the global top 100 and it's all about the $$$ here too.

Foodforthought,fc51i45,t1_fc3opbh,1577438282.0,"I think you missed the main point that these guys are trying to make: if God cares about our daily lives (assumption), he or she by defitinition should care about our struggles. As the source of most of our struggles are social (not spiritual) and as such highly political, drawing a boundary between the church and politics, or in their words the 'pastoral' and the 'prophetic' is artificial (and also contrary to how Jesus lived his life). *Not* reading Marx (or Adam Smith for that matter) in a holy space therefore is what makes the church redundant in 2020."
