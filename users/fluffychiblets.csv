CollegeRant,ff3zn2i,t3_era4w1,1579552342.0,"Sorry your mom said that and it affected you that way. The truth of the matter is I think people make too much of a deal of the degrees and it never really seems to dictate that much what field you go into, so try to ignore that kind of talk and just study and take classes about what interests you."
GenZ,feexj8t,t3_eor5r6,1579043381.0,It felt like the whole class was trying to will this into going on for longer than it should and then teacher trying a bit too hard to prevent that lmao
teenagers,febmfs7,t3_eoajzg,1578960388.0,"“I love to too.”
Looks like you found yourself a keeper there bud"
sex,feaef5r,t3_eo93tk,1578947658.0,"If I knew more about y’alls relationship and past stuff she’s said to you, how it was said etc It would be easier to tell"
sex,fdmb9he,t3_em4fvy,1578544534.0,"Quick google search seems to say that smarter people have less sex. Didn’t really look into why but I’m taking a lot of uninformed leaps in thinking that maybe smarter people aren’t as impulsive and don’t need to do anything physical to assert themselves and be sure of themselves as people. Don’t really know though, could be a lot of things."
GenZ,fdh95ci,t3_elcrl6,1578418074.0,This is why we’ve all gotten progressively more depressed throughout time lol
wiiu,fddymbe,t3_ekjukl,1578327137.0,"I remember getting this for a Christmas and playing that with my brothers and friends as much as anything, this one will always conjure up tons of memories for me. I remember loving the little photo that was on the instruction booklet."
teenagers,fd4kd6h,t1_fd3y2wq,1578168290.0,Your standards don’t apply to everyone. No one is lesser because they have romantic experiences happen later in life. Everyone has their own progression and experiences and reasons for them.
earthbound,fd495vs,t3_ejxg3t,1578165491.0,I love that art so much. I wanna try to look for a poster of it.
beta,fd3vho7,t3_ejuvkv,1578161997.0,Yes please
teenagers,fd3sgmb,t1_fd3s182,1578161301.0,"No problem my friend, don’t be afraid to keep me/us updated. Hanging out/going out can be scary but how good the feeling is of hitting it off with someone you’ve liked is worth it."
teenagers,fd3rp6t,t3_ejynsu,1578161079.0,"I know it can be tough. And yeah, it does sound like she’s not interested, but I know how you’re feeling. Try to ask her to meet up or do something and it’ll be a lot easier to tell, some people just aren’t big into messaging, she might even be scared to make it clear she reciprocates your feelings too even. Who knows."
teenagers,fd3qtnq,t1_fd2r5ro,1578160918.0,According to who or what? Why do you gotta kiss someone at a certain point in life? There’s no such thing as late lol.
college,fd15o0e,t3_ejjmmx,1578127791.0,"No. I mean yes I guess, closer to being done"
college,fcycii1,t3_ejeuio,1578078019.0,"I eventually came to the opinion that the idea of a dream school is flawed, for me at least. I think with at least some flexibility that how much you enjoy college is based on your outlook and how proactive you are, I also think that if you have your expectations are super high going into your “dream school” it’s quite possible you’ll be disappointed if it doesn’t totally change and kick your life into gear. Take the opportunities and get what you want as you go and you’re bound to be in a gold position."
GenZ,fctg8fh,t3_ein46t,1577942269.0,"I was thinking about this, I’m prepared to take on the world like this how I want but I don’t want to pin everything on one decade, shit’s stressful, I trust that whenever it is, cause we’ll all still be relatively young by the end of the decade, even if it takes longer I can make what I need happen in my life, one way or another. I don’t wanna put a lot of pressure on a period of time, life can come about whenever, without you even realizing it too."
college,fckcy6p,t3_ehmapz,1577722533.0,The devil. That’s what
smashbros,fc3lzpx,t3_efynkr,1577392870.0,That Dedede has an easy life lmao
listentothis,fc1idw9,t3_eflv1l,1577319687.0,"Whoa I’ve been in love with this album for years and it’s crazy to see it here, thanks for getting the word out"
3DS,fc1c2vx,t3_eff4q5,1577314300.0,I agree. As much as the slowness of everything can be annoying the image of everyone all comfy with their families on their with their new gifts at home surrounded by family thats causing the traffic always makes me happy.
wiiu,fc0ap2t,t3_efbem6,1577285183.0,"Merry Christmas, enjoy! Here’s to hours of pure nintendo fun stemming from this magical, youthful Christmas :)"
college,fbuvh5k,t3_eemam0,1577121013.0,"It’s possible, my school is around the same distance from home and it didn’t totally happen for me, progressively a bit over the years but not how I would’ve wanted it. It all depends on how your parents are and how you play it. I kind of like having a mix of independent college life and still being able to like be a kid and be part of the family, I probably will lose that entirely soon so it’s nice I get to hold onto it a bit."
