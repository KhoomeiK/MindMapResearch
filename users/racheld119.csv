confessions,fdsr1ma,t1_fdsesew,1578706835.0,"I thought it was religious guilt for so long but it‚Äôs definitely not as even being married it still happened. Only if I orgasm though. I hate it. I think it‚Äôs some link to dopamine dropping super quickly. I‚Äôd get the same feeling while breastfeeding right before and during my milk letting down, extreme intense self hatred and weird thoughts- but it goes away pretty quickly thankfully. Hormones are weird dude."
Fleabag,fdsnhr5,t3_emtdq3,1578705517.0,I watched a movie called Anything on Showtime I believe (it has John Carroll Lynch and Matt Bomer in it). I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs on any other platforms but I thought it was amazing. One of those movies you want to discuss with others but no one else has even heard of it.
