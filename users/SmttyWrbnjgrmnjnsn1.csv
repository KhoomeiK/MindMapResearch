Secondly, it really depends on the kind of paint and it's intended use. Floors take a lot of abuse and wear down quickly. You also have to consider how you will clean it. Chemicals, floor steamers, and vacuum brushes could damage it easily. 

If you do it anyway, please remember to ventilate the room while you're in there and afterwards to off-gas for at least 24 hours."

I wish I would've been truer to myself and not worried so much about fitting in. I spent a lot of time trying to impress the popular kids... I tried to force myself to like the same things they were into, dress a certain way, stop hanging out with people that were considered dorky (this one is my biggest regret). I have a daughter now and I will absolutely tell her the same thing: do not ever compromise who you are to ""fit in"". It's never what it seems from the outside anyway and it's never worth it. When you go to college or get out into the adult world NONE of it matters. You will make the friends that are truly your friend just being yourself. Sometimes it takes longer to find people that march to the same beat, but it will happen. In the meantime, you can feel good about yourself knowing you aren't pretending to be someone else. Plus, those of us who have a hard time being ""popular"" tend to make more interesting adults. Hang in there and keep doing you. Someone will appreciate it and want to share in it with you.
