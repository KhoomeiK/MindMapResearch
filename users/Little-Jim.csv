No you weren't. You were just telling OP that he's not allowed to have an opinion about women and that doing so only means insecurity.

1.) You think it's more of a fault for men to not agree with a standard that suddenly became popular to set as a benchmark than it is for women to set that benchmark for men? You're fucking stupid.

2.) The attacks on you are absolutely your fault, because you're a dumbass. It's as simple as that. If you say dumb shit, people will call the shit you say dumb, and no one is coming to your defense because of how fucking stupid you are."
