insaneparents,fc6ohlq,t1_fc654et,1577485485.0,"I think PE should be graded solely on participation. If you're there, following instructions and putting forth your best effort, you should get an A. Why? Because there are kids (especially in high school year when your body is changing) who physically CAN'T do 30 pushups and sit ups. They physically CAN'T run a mile in under 6 minutes. So to base their entire grade upon whether they can and not take into account if they tried is ridiculous"
