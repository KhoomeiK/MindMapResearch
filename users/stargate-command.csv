I’m not usually one to suggest cutting and running, but this is one of those situations to me. Sure, maybe he doesn’t find it attractive.... but if he doesn’t have mental problems, he’d still find YOU attractive and deal with you wearing someone he doesn’t like.

Of course, the inherent problem with that is how do we ensure that task force isn’t itself corrupt?  

I think governmental corruption is the biggest problem society faces, creating or inflating all other societal ills. But how do you stop it?  The same flaws inherent in systems composed of people with power would be baked into another similar system. How can you confirm that someone isn’t corrupt or corruptable?  Os there a psych profile that can be done?  Functional MRI testing?  I don’t know, but if we want to continue existing as a species, we need to figure it out."

When someone is successful due to some inherent trait, or hard won skill, or perception of hard tireless work.... that’s totally different. We have a sort of coping mechanism in place for that. But when it’s dumb luck like the lottery, it’s a different thing. It becomes far more “why him?”  

If it’s a professional athlete, it isn’t the same. You see the hard work at practice. You see the honed skill. It doesn’t just fall in their lap. You can tell yourself “if I were willing to train that hard maybe it could be me.” Or “well, with physical dominance like that he should be successful”

Like if I knew a wonderful singer who became a super star, I’d be happy as hell for them. Or if they worked hard to build a business that took off.

It’s not even their fault. The dynamic just changes and you now live totally different lives. They have to work, as you once did, just to live.... you get all the free time in the world and to do whatever you want. You live in a better neighborhood that makes their place look like a pit of despair. Essentially, you are a constant reminder that their lives are difficult and tedious and boring. 

And it’s different when one person is successful and slowly becomes rich. Because usually, that person has some special skill, or worked really hard, or took crazy chances. So the friends can always say to themselves “sure, Steve is rich.... but at what cost?  He never had time to have fun.”  Or “well of course, that dude is a genius so he should do better than me, I’m just normal”.  But if it’s literally just dumb luck.... its not the same.

self,fdzv6nq,t1_fdz73xu,1578796563.0,"Ok, so I enjoy conversations with religious people.... but I would ask that you limit the references to scripture. I don’t think it’s helpful in any way because I sort of just tune it out. To me, the book your referencing is no more accurate than Harry Potter. To me, it is fictional. So referencing it is meaningless. Instead, I would ask that you use logic and basic rational thought to frame your argument.

Not to be a dick, but I think the argument sort of gets lost in the weeds when one person is saying “maybe God doesn’t exist, and maybe this book is just made up.” And the other says “well, but the book says it isn’t so....”. Do you see what I mean?  It doesn’t address the argument at all. I get that you believe in God and that book as divine.  I get that you think it has truth within it. What I don’t get is why. And anytime that question is asked, the answer is invariably a citation from the book in question. That’s not an answer. Let me put it into perspective. Imagine I believed the lord of the rings was truth. Then you ask me why I would beleive some book written a long time ago was accurate when there is so much elements of fantasy inside. When so much it describes is demonstrably not true. My response is some quite by Gandalf or Frodo. Do you see how that might be pointless?  I’m not likening the two books, just trying to help you see a non believers perspective. 

Going back to ethics. Here’s where I have a problem with belief in a deity, I guess. It allows people to see immoral acts as moral, based on the one performing the act or for whom the act is performed. If God asks someone to murder a baby, doing so becomes moral. If God wants you to fly a plane into a skyscraper, than you’re right to do it. Whereas someone who doesn’t have this view can determine the morality of a being by the actions. 

Imagine for a second that God and Satan exist, and that the Bible is mostly a true account of human history. You believe this already so it won’t be a stretch. Now imagine if Satan decided to inspire religious texts about himself, and he chose to pretend to be God. Let’s say Satan wants to be worshiped and decided to trick people. So he does terribly immoral acts, and encourages people to do the same, but he calls himself God, and so people do it. How would you know?  How would you determine that the one you were worshiping isn’t actually Satan, and not God?  A logical way would be to look at the acts being performed and to ask “is this moral?”  But of course you can’t do that if the answer is “everything the leader does is moral because he determines morality!”  If that circular logic is baked in the cake of belief, than you could be worshipping the devil and you’d argue for his morality. You’d have no barometer to determine the morality of he who is claiming to be God, so anyone could claim it. You don’t arrive at belief vie logic, so it is immune to logic. 

I’m sorry, but when I hear about a powerful being who slaughters children, delights in violence, commits genocide via drowning, forces his own child to suffer, allows for the suffering of his worshippers, demands to be worshipped.... it just sounds more like a villain than a god. If God and the Devil exist, that sounds more like the second guy to me. “Working mysteriously” is also what the other guy does, because mystery is just another way to indicate deception. Trickery. Lies."
self,fdynosb,t1_fdxiaht,1578781774.0,"Ok.... so it isn’t immoral when God does it, because God gets to decide what is immoral?  But if we act as God acts, we would be considered heinous monstrosities?

So God serves as a terrible example to his children. Which makes him, at minimum, a harmful parent. Also unethical. 

The reality is, you can say whatever you like but if you try to look at it logically.... well it paints a pretty shit picture. If you look at it purely from inside a circular bubble, than anything can be forced to make sense. What I find difficult to square is how people can operate with blinders on like that. Perfectly rational, intelligent people, through all walks of life.... have blinders on in this one area. And it’s so pervasive that two “believers” will tell you all about how they are right about their interpretation and everyone else bastardized it.... right next to the other guy saying the exact same thing... with an entirely different interpretation. And yet they don’t seem to recognize the exact same words when coming from their mouth as when coming out of someone else’s. It’s odd man."

It also saw the first black president which was thought impossible at the beginning of the decade. The rise of social media, as well as powerhouse corporations that changed our daily lives (amazon and google). 

The 10’s are still too new to really have their own identity. We just waved goodbye, so we are still in them.  Like 1989 seems different from 1991, but it didn’t in 1992. It only felt different way later when our brains took away the subtle transitions in favor of hard demarcations.  When we knew what parts of the 80’s had deep impact on the 90’s and past.... that’s when the defining factors are set in place. 

It’s all arbitrary really. Decades are only defined because we choose to define them this way or that. Reality sees subtle transitions year after year, but we like to put them into boxes because it’s fun. We will surely but the 2010’s in a box as well. The only thing that gives me pause, and makes me think that maybe we won’t.... we never really had a good name for the 00’s or the 10’s.  When we lived in 1998 we all knew we were in the 90’s. People would say “welcome to the 90’s” sarcastically. Nobody liked naming the decades in the 00’s and 10’s. And when you look back, we can define decades before our births.... each having a feel we’ve been told about (the roaring 20’s). But what did 1900-1919 feel like?  We don’t get told about those decades as having unique characteristics. So maybe we have a mental block because of naming issues."

If they actually believed in heaven, then murder wouldn’t be so bad now would it?  It would be bad for the murderer who goes to hell, but the victim gets a quick ride to paradise.

I guess they could be a little sad about not being able to see their friend, but more like a “my friend moved to Italy and is having a great adventure and I miss them but I’m jealous.... can’t wait to see them soon!”

self,fdrokwn,t1_fdrmegc,1578687402.0,"I’m not disagreeing with you, I just find the argument sort of odd. 

The argument always goes, we can’t know what happens to us after we die because we can’t ask a dead person..... which is true, I suppose. Except we can ask a dead person. They just won’t respond. Logically, this means either that they can’t respond or refuse to. And if they can’t respond, it could be for some unknown reason or because they literally aren’t in existence so of course they can’t. 

We accept that everything that dies just isn’t around anymore.  When your phone breaks, it can’t work anymore and becomes trash. When a building collapses, that building doesn’t exist anymore. When a mouse dies, it’s just gone forever. Nobody talks about mice heaven. Or ants. Or anything, except us. The only reason is that we just hate the idea of not existing some day. It’s scary. So we make all this shit up to ease our mind. But there isn’t any reason on earth that we do it. I mean we have not a shred of evidence to support the notion that our mind, which can’t ever exist outside our living body while we’re alive, can somehow do so when our body stops functioning. It’s weird man. And I do it too. I just know that the reason I do it is because I’m scared of not existing. I’m scared that life itself is pointless. So I like to think about all the possibilities. 

But really.... why would there be anything else?  How would that even work?  Why do we convince ourselves that we are more than just a program running on meat hardware, when everything indicates that’s the reality?  I don’t know, but I do know that people get really defensive when you bring this shit up. I suppose it’s just one more aspect of our programming, to desperately shy away from the likelihood that death is really the end to us. That our entire lives lead up to nothing. It sucks."
self,fdrhyg7,t1_fdrcqc5,1578684727.0,"No, it isn’t just as likely at all. 

It’s possible, but not as likely. We know that our minds are a product of our brains, and we know once we die our brains stop working. We also know that over time our brains decompose and become nothing.  We are computer programs running on meat hardware. We actually know how to change fundamental parts of your personality by tinkering with the brain. 

An afterlife could exist in the same way that magic might exist. Or vampires might exist. Or genies. Or a planet populated entirely by unicorns. It’s possible.... but the likelihood is very low given the entire breadth of our experiences through the ages as a species. 

Everything we know shows us definitively that our mind is a product of our brains function. It stands to reason that if the brain stops functioning entirely, or no longer exists at all, our mind stops existing.  Anything else is just magic."
self,fdrgp91,t1_fdrcufr,1578684264.0,"No.... circumcision was never required. It was a custom of the Jewish religion, not scientifically vetted medical procedure.  It should have never been done to begin with is the point. 

The flat earthers are no more twisting the Bible than you are. It’s a big book, and if it is a divinely inspired one then every word in it should be true. The problem is, lots of parts contradict other parts, and lots of parts are known to be untrue, and lots of parts advocate for wildly unethical (even monstrous) behavior.  For you to take the parts you like and disregard the rest is no less faulty than flat earthers doing it. 

Modern people distort ancient texts.... ok..... and ancient people wrote texts that lend themselves to distortion. Largely because they weren’t scientific thinkers. Fables don’t require internal consistency. Not a lot of reality was known, and so making wildly inaccurate statements was fine because they didn’t have the knowledge to refute them. 

You seem to be looking at the Bible as the source for its own legitimacy. You have to see how flawed that rationale is.  Also, I’m sure you’re aware that there are OTHER ancient texts that other people think are absolutely true and directly contracted yours. Which one is the right one?  Why yours?

If dying was more than nothing, then we’d have like 1 good account of that.... but we have no accounts, which would align with nothing to account. 

In the absence of credible evidence to the contrary, the most rational assumption is the best one. We can see what happens on earth when something dies... it decays until it is gone. We have billions of examples of this. So that’s the best explanation until some other one is proven. It’s sort of silly to think that when a rat dies, we see it decomposing, but really some extra dimension is scooping up its mind and it lives there forever..... that’s a preposterous thing and has no evidence for it.  But people say that about people as if the laws of nature are so drastically different for us because why?  We wear suits and dresses and drive cars?  So the laws of physics don’t apply to us?

Here’s my suggestion. Write down a list of the most important issues you value. Don’t just have 1 or 2, but try to really get a decent list. Then look up how the candidates align. And not just what they say, because some candidates say contradictory things to get more votes.... but what they do and have done. This can help you know which “side” is really working for the stuff you want the country to be. 

Then.... and this one is sort of big.... you have to look at the human angle. Would you support someone you think is a bad human being, if they align with your views?  Or is being a decent person, who disagrees with you, more important?  For me, that’s very important. I want to know that the person I’m voting for is, overall, a decent human being. I think usually, people are decent. Not perfect, but ok.  Sometimes someone seems like a very good person. And sometimes they seem like absolute trash. To me that matters and I do tend to think it should matter to others, but it isn’t up to me to make that choice for them. 

I totally agree that “fuck trump” isn’t a good argument, and it’s not a valuable discussion. There’s a time and a place to complain about leadership at any time, but it isn’t productive way to discuss who is a better choice. Better to openly break down what we all value, and be open to different perspectives. Liking guns doesn’t make someone a crazy right winger, and disliking guns doesn’t make them a crazy lefty. Both people probably have very good reasons for their views. We should actually hear them, and stop pretending we’re so different. Most people just want the country to be better.... they just disagree on how to get there. Maybe if we stopped demonizing each other we could hear the good ideas from both “sides” and come up with reasonable compromises that work for everyone."
