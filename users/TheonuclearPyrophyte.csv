If no, why not?

Just as anti-authoritarian as I've always been, if not more so, and able to articulate those values much better than when I was younger. Still don't like most grown-ups, although I am one. And now I know WHY I hate big business/big government, instead of being a rebel without a cause ""just because"" I was a rebellious teen. It's all about the numbers: hierarchy isn't inherently bad, but a good leader needs to know and respect their people as individuals.

I'd be happy I found a hygiene routine that works for me, instead of grudgingly following practices and using products that make me look and feel worse just because mommy said so. I'd be proud that I wear black when I want to wear black, regardless of being called ""goth"" or whatever other silly label, and I'd be equally proud that I wear pink when I want to wear pink, regardless of being told ""omg you're wearing that?"" because I'm a tomboy who isn't supposed to like girly things. I'd possibly be appalled that I occasionally wear ""preppy"" brands like American Eagle, but I simply don't care so much about brands or labels anymore. I care about look and feel.

I'd be horrified that I still have anger issues, because I've always been afraid of angry people. That's partially why I myself am so angry: I grew up in an environment that required out-raging the adults around me. I'd be disappointed and ashamed that I've become so much like them, like my mother, even toward the few people in my family who always treated me with genuine kindness and respect. I'd hate myself for ostracizing and bullying my uncle when he became mentally ill, even though he STILL accepts me with open arms despite my self-righteous rage. Actually, I snapped on him today and feel horrible about it.

I'd be so glad that I escaped the ""friend"" group that bullied and abused me, quit pursuing people I found unattractive simply for the attention, and found the man of my dreams with long hair, blue eyes, and the scent I always imagined. Younger me would probably be jealous of older me, physically assault both myself and my husband because I couldn't have him yet, and stalk younger him once I know where he lives. Although we probably wouldn't have liked each other back then.

All in all, I think I'd be satisfied with how I turned out. I have hope and ambition I utterly lacked when I was younger, yet that ambition is driven by many of the same beliefs that previously made me feel so hopeless. The key is knowing who my real friends are. And I don't have many of those, but I value quality over quantity."

Maybe $500,000 per friend, BUT they also actually have to be good friends who aren't just in it for the money. Shared hobbies, interests, values, etc. Preferably sexy, bisexual, and polyamorous/polygamous too. So they, my husband, and I could all share each other.

Step 3: Purchase a massive hoard of weapons and armor that rivals that of the military, all while insisting our pacifism and simple desire for personal protection because we're filthy rich.

Step 3: Purchase a goodly-sized unincorporated area with very lax zoning laws and building codes in the rural Midwest. Pay the inhabitants in whatever they desire to win their good favor - cash, guns, food, guns, ass, etc - as long as the total worth equals $500,000. Offer to fortify their homes and businesses, because now they too are filthy rich.

Step 4: Build an eclectic agrarian compound dotted with cabins and trailers for our loved ones, surrounded by a wall topped with razor wire and a moat stocked with carnivorous aquatic animals. Laser cannon and regular cannon both included. At this point, maybe it doesn't matter if the feds are on our ass. But they really shouldn't be, because we're actually quite friendly unless provoked.

Step 5: 10-hour timer goes DING. I take some alone time after all that god-awful socializing, and my husband and I spend the rest of our lives as the leaders of a free-range zoo, a badass harem of warrior sister-wives, and a peaceful but well-armed community.

No country should be big and powerful enough to decide world affairs, not China, Russia, or the US. Power corrupts. But empires also collapse. Populations rise and fall, like a tide. Which is not a bad thing. I would rather see communities remain small, stable, and tight-knit, even if somewhat authoritarian, for as long as possible, so leaders can actually know their people as individuals, than see either a blatant dictatorship or a so-called ""democracy"" have such a large reach. Because the most libertarian nation will still lose touch with the needs and wants of its citizens as the nation grows beyond the point of effective communication.

EDIT: That said, I almost agree with OP. Almost. There should be no ""world superpower"", ""world police"", or any empire that has such control over other nations, but this seems to be the way of nature. The age-old tension between order and chaos. We can't change that, only adapt, survive, and hopefully thrive. So, big government and big business aside, of course I side with the US. If only because this is my home.

AskReddit,fekza9p,t3_epj100,1579210711.0,"Two games for PS2: Malice and Dark Cloud.

Malice follows the bizarre adventures of a bitchy teenage goddess named Malice, primarily her quest to defeat who seems to be a Hitler-esque hellhound: Dog God. You fight crows that seem to be inspired by Nazis, aid a rebel army of birds, guided by the Metal Guardian of the Clockwork Universe. If you die, you simply go speak with Death, who does NOT want you in his afterlife. And you can nuke people with a giant tuning fork.

The graphics and story ain't the best, at least not by some (most) people's standards. But I absolutely love it.

Dark Cloud is a bit more known, but still not nearly as famous as Kingdom Hearts or GTA. You journey the world as a boy named Toan (or whatever you choose to name him) to rebuild what the Dark Genie destroyed. Several new allies join you along the way, and you can't fully traverse the dungeons without their help. Because you can't fucking jump unless you're a catgirl standing at just the right spot on the edge of an abyss.

The sequel (or prequel?) Dark Cloud 2 (Dark Chronicle outside the US) is also pretty good."

That said, stoner culture (especially modern stoner culture) makes me embarassed to admit I smoke.

We probably won't quit smoking though. But key words: DON'T OVERDO IT.

Like others have said, moderation is key. Anything that alters your body or mind risks damaging it. If I smoke too much for too long, my anxiety worsens when I stop, and if I smoke a lot when I haven't in awhile, same issue. It's a delicate balance, just like any other psychotropic medicine.

He doesn't even know these friends his mom shaves her head to support, so these comments are clearly just an excuse to jab at his long hair. I can't help but wonder if your coworkers are doing something similar.

Long hair is natural feature of both men and women, us being mammals and all. It is a sign of health; hair loss usually results from health issues, like chemotherapy or hormone imbalance, while cultures that expect men to have short hair have historically been militaristic and authoritarian in the worst ways. Shaving your head to mimic the side-effect of a hard drug used to treat runaway cell mutation is little more than a sad token of conformist back-patting.

Why not consume emetics in support of your assistant manager, or burn yourself in support of burn victims?

Please don't do that.

I know, hair isn't a vital organ in the same sense as your skin or stomach. But it DOES serve a biological purpose, and to shave it would violate your bodily integrity, removing a mane of fur we evolved to shield our head from the elements and signal our physiological fitness. I wouldn't risk sleeping around your coworkers if I were you. I'd like to think they wouldn't assault your scalp out of spite, but there IS that sexist double-standard regarding hair length to consider.

As an example:

I'm pansexual in theory, but bisexual in practice. I wouldn't necessarily have a problem with a fit, healthy, intact, natural intersex or non-binary person. No breast implants, mastectomies, penis amputations, or inside-out vaginas. Circumcision is okay because it's almost unavoidable in the US.

Different people, from all different numbers, keep calling and texting. When I ask who they are, my question is completely ignored.

One text is about appearing in court, another about group therapy, one call sounds like a social worker who doesn't believe me when I say they have the wrong number, etc. Could the police or whitecoats come after me if I dismiss these calls and texts?

Once or twice a week from 1st through 8th grade, I had to miss one class to attend another, which, while I might enjoy both classes, resulted in double the work to catch up on. I felt like Hermione Granger in 3rd year. And I couldn't do my work at home, because....things were too chaotic.

Partially due to extra classes and partially due to switching schools in the middle of 3rd grade, I went from an honor roll student to almost failing even the subjects I enjoyed. Despite all this, I was put on the ""college course"" at my school; between my guidance counselor, my neurotic mother, and my artsy-academic ""friend"" group, I really didn't have a choice. So I had more advanced classes, some I enjoyed, some I didn't enjoy. Even if I enjoyed a subject, the teachers and students fucked up the class for me. So I continued to fail.

Halfway through high school, the guidance counselor suggested the ""technical course"" because I clearly ain't college material. Of course, she had to inform my mom of the absolutely negligible change, which resulted in a fun night of being beaten and screamed at. And I still had to talk to the college representives who came to lecture my algebra-for-dummies class.

I barely graduated on time. I skipped several classes ""required"" to graduate, like senior dance and drivers safety, which they either didn't notice or didn't care about. Thank God. I refuse to dance with the classmates who regularly bullied me, and I don't have the reflexes or coordination to drive. But I still have nightmares about school, wondering why I'm still there even though I graduated, afraid they'll revoke my diploma if I leave. My mom and I got in another fight when I refused to attend my graduation ceremony. If I didn't graduate that year, I would've dropped out. Got near-perfect ACT scores though.

I really don't mean to either bitch or brag, but I'm very passionate about this topic. I'm passionate about education in general, as well as medicine, politics, and law. Needless to say, everyone and their brother always asks me why I won't go back to school to be a doctor, lawyer, or teacher. I refuse to participate in the medical industry or education system in their current state, at least not on their terms. I get heated about it.

You know what I've really always wanted to be? A priest.

AskReddit,fe5utld,t3_ennslu,1578875444.0,"My husband and I seem to have quite different values than others our age, so take my advice with a grain of salt. But here goes:

Avoid debt.

Avoid contracts and bundles, most will fuck you over. Get a prepaid phone.

Avoid automatic payments and direct deposit. Handle your money yourself.

Pay cash and get paid in cash whenever you can.

Save your money. However much you can set aside. Do little things to save, like turning off appliances not in use.

Don't rent or lease, don't pay for something unless you'll own it.

Get enough vitamins C and D. The supplement industry may indeed put out misinformation about nutrient deficiency so you buy more of their products, but I firmly believe scurvy and rickets are much more common than people realize. Along with an overly high-carb diet without the oral hygiene to mitigate it, I think many oral problems result from a lack of necessary vitamins.

Bad friends are worse than no friends. I would rather have one close friend who I can fully trust, who respects my personal liberty and bodily autonomy, than a paternalistic/maternalistic friend who violates my wishes for either my ""own good"" or their own gain. If my friends aren't good enough to consider my family, they aren't really my friends.

Don't lose sleep, unless sleeping is an actual safety risk. Sometimes, someone needs to stay awake on guard duty. It happens.

Have a smoke alarm. Peferably multiple kinds or a combination type, and I prefer old-fashioned alkaline batteries because both lithium-ion and hard-wired can be more of a fire risk. Not usually though. Also have a carbon monoxide alarm, possibly even a natural gas alarm, and of course, a fire extinguisher. Carbon dioxide seems to be the most versatile.

Learn to defend yourself insofar as you physically can. If you aren't a gun person, find another weapon you feel comfortable with. Even if you trust the intentions of the police and/or military in your area, they may simply be unable to protect you and your loved ones. You are your own first responder. 

Learn other basic survival skills, like first-aid, firestarting, water distillation, shelter-making, hand-sewing, and hunting/growing/foraging your own food. Even in a first world country, you may find yourself in a situation without medical treatment or modern utilities.

Don't be afraid to scrap and scavenge, within the limits of health, safety, and legality. Watch out for rads in the junkyard.

I won't say not to drink or do drugs, but I will recommend keeping your wits about you.

Remember what you learned in school. Not necessarily for college or a career, but because every scrap of information may help you in unexpected ways.

Pay it forward when you can, but you can't help others if you can't help yourself.

I know this is way more than a single ""important piece of advice"" as asked for in the title, but many of these things overlap. Everything in life overlaps. Life is a cross between a pie chart and a Venn diagram. Nothing is truly unrelated or disconnected, and that itself is my final piece of advice.

I've noticed a double-standard throughout my short life: when an older man, such as a friend of the parents, makes a sexual remark toward a young woman, this is frequently not tolerated. Apparently, a husband can't even say his own wife was attractive as a teenager. But when an older woman makes similar sexual remarks toward a young man, many people think this is a-okay. This happens a lot to my husband; his mother's middle-aged ""girlfriends"" will make lewd comments about him, even right in front of me, and we're ""overreacting"" if it bothers us. But I know damn well how much she'd freak out if an older man made similar comments about me, and I'm only her daughter-in-law."

Yes, 15 is young by modern Western standards, but throughout most of human history, a 15 year old has been considered a sexually mature adult. Of course, the brain isn't necessarily developed enough to make sexual decisions at that age, but the brains of many 30 year olds aren't really developed enough either. You aren't a damn pedophile, maybe an ephebophile or hebephile at most. ;)

If you were 16, most folks wouldn't bat an eyelid if you thought a 15 year old was hot. It is completely normal for teenagers to both give AND receive sexual remarks. Your wife is grossly overreacting. She wasn't in fucking kindergarten in the photo, mkay?

I've always had this fascination/obsession with anatomy and biochemistry since I was a very small child. I was reading college-level medical textbooks in 2nd grade, until my elders realized what information college-level textbooks usually contain. Some of my earliest sexual fantasies involved performing surgery on myself or attractive others. That said, I really do prefer my husband's internal organs remain safely internal.

If someone I love and find attractive were disemboweled, I would most certainly feel all the appropriate horror and concern. But I would probably also be lying if I said I wouldn't be at least SLIGHTLY turned on by the situation.
