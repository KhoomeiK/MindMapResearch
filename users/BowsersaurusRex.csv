cscareerquestions,ffekh5g,t1_ffe8nsx,1579851800.0,"Honestly, I think being good at your job but no longer giving a shit is the defining trait of a principal level developer.

Half joking."
cringe,ffek0uj,t1_ffeizo1,1579851222.0,"Dude, that's fucked up, why do you feel the need to shit on lizard people like that?"
startrek,ffd8mif,t1_ffcosw5,1579815559.0,"Wait, you haven't gotten to DS9 yet?

I'm so jealous. I hate you."
AndroidGaming,ffaaubp,t1_ff9wpxz,1579731276.0,"Well, look at Octopath, they added the banking (forgot what it was called), breaking, and weaknesses to certain weapons, on top of a very basic RPG battle system.

Some FF games have equipped summons, or jobs, or each character has a unique ability. Many RPGs also have passive abilities that can be combined to produce complex effects. Some have skill trees. It needs *something* that adds a second layer of strategy."
cscareerquestions,ffa66a7,t3_esfmn2,1579728649.0,"It's been said elsewhere, but ask for a title change while keeping your current duties.

After that, you can do two things. One, use the title to find a job you want. Two, it's amazing how often the title will organically change the work you're assigned over time."
cscareerquestions,ffa5xwa,t1_ffa50cu,1579728525.0,"Nah, a lot of people put a lot of personal value in their title."
cscareerquestions,ffa5uwm,t1_ff9v9bj,1579728477.0,"This is a good trick. Ask for a raise. When denied, ask for a title change without a raise. They often agree to appease you with zero cost. Use this new title to get a job elsewhere that pays more."
AndroidGaming,ff9vvp6,t1_ff9ghv3,1579722648.0,"I'd add *something*. Most RPGs, even old ones, have *something* that adds complexity to the battle system."
AndroidGaming,ff9vsmy,t1_ff8o36w,1579722593.0,"Also, fewer but harder random encounters is always better. To me, anyway."
AndroidGaming,ff9vp7d,t3_es7r51,1579722532.0,"I'll admit I was disappointed when I saw the EarthBound style battle. EarthBound is a great game, but its battle screen is the worst part of it to copy."
mildlysatisfying,ff7o8nr,t3_es0sgf,1579654305.0,"If you only watch the red one it becomes mildly infuriating. Unlike the other three, it's animation is messed up at the end of its swing."
AnimalsBeingJerks,ff7nxu0,t1_ff7kliu,1579654092.0,I have but I don't say anything.
startrek,fesdv40,t3_eqescp,1579364167.0,He was actually watching Star Trek: The Lotion Picture.
facepalm,fel49g4,t1_fekxw8j,1579213732.0,"I've just generally found that fresh graduates are really good at spitting out the solution to an algorithm (that's generally already been implemented by every major framework), but are terrible at thinking for themselves or finding solutions to real world problems or dealing with the millions of real world pitfalls that you're not going to learn in an algorithm textbook."
facepalm,fel3ocb,t1_fekxkjc,1579213372.0,I suppose it depends on the company. I know some self taught people at Blue Origin.
facepalm,fekwpig,t1_fekud71,1579209170.0,"I work in cloud computing for a big N. Consistently, on average, self taught people do far better in the interviews than people straight out of college."
facepalm,fekqcoq,t1_fek41ia,1579205424.0,"And in a lot of tech jobs, the self taught people are actually much more prepared for their first job, which isn't exactly a strong endorsement for the quality of education you're getting."
gaming,fekj9sc,t1_fekh4uq,1579201207.0,"Ganon (blue pig) is almost an entirely different character. Not only does he look completely different, he uses a trident, turns invisible, and summons fire bats. He'd look unique and play unique."
gaming,fekj250,t1_fekiiz3,1579201080.0,Ganon has been my #1 since Melee.
gaming,fekgttw,t1_fek8hok,1579199755.0,"We don't even have Ganon in the game yet (the blue pig, not Ganondorf). Who has appeared in more games than Ganondorf.

We also don't have Chibi Robo, even though he has multiple games and an Amiibo.

The main characters from several multi-game Nintendo franchises are also missing, Golden Sun, Advance Wars, etc."
dotnet,fek7tyr,t3_epbdgg,1579194419.0,Shouldn't Browser + Razor be Brazor not Blazor? Where did the L come from?
IndieDev,fehd5sa,t1_feh9vn6,1579114112.0,Or the pixels are all different sizes on different sprites... \*cringe\*
aww,feh7s34,t1_fegluzg,1579110915.0,"Come on dude, this is aww, why do you have to make it sexual?"
csharp,fe97x69,t1_fe8t9zn,1578935154.0,"Agreed. Business apps don't really need to worry about it running. Games, robotics, or anything performance critical usually does, but it isn't very hard to write code that doesn't allocate in C#. Especially in the latest version of C#."
csharp,fe8ilg0,t1_fe78bv3,1578926545.0,"Don't look at games made with C# then. It's standard practice there.

Although none of those things you mentioned are an issue."
csharp,fe38f7i,t1_fe21st5,1578846909.0,"It's not completely non-deterministic. You can keep it from running if you don't allocate, for example."
rareinsults,fe33yim,t3_ennzf4,1578845691.0,Well that was rude.
IndieDev,fdwpmhc,t3_en83kg,1578761157.0,It's odd seeing pixel art with this animation style since the pixels aren't aligned.
CryptoCurrency,fdsroun,t1_fdrr4gk,1578707073.0,"Nano is nearly instant, feeless, and has low power usage. If Nano is a shitcoin then most cryptos, including Bitcoin, are something worse than shit."
CryptoCurrency,fdspo42,t1_fds8rav,1578706327.0,It's referencing a Bitcoin ad that looks similar.
CryptoCurrency,fdsphuq,t1_fds6vr8,1578706264.0,"No, because Nano doesn't have transaction fees."
CryptoCurrency,fdsp6es,t1_fds5ykm,1578706147.0,"Because it's intentionally shit to get attention, which it is."
Wellthatsucks,fdrt9te,t3_emvanc,1578689443.0,Closed as By Design.
maker,fdrril8,t3_emuyhp,1578688644.0,"Very nice, but ""DVD-quality"" isn't really a selling point. :)"
assholedesign,fdrojqg,t1_fdrnuwg,1578687382.0,I use both.
CryptoCurrency,fdr18g8,t1_fdqy2ni,1578678106.0,Exactly.
CryptoCurrency,fdqy0as,t1_fdqojjd,1578676490.0,That video makes Bitcoin look extremely outdated.
aww,fdqw5sx,t1_fdqq0qk,1578675654.0,"You're right. We demand that tigers be set free, but keep house cats. How hypocritical."
aww,fdqv3t8,t1_fdqpmzc,1578675268.0,"Because a lot of it isn't based on reality. I used to work with big cats in zoos and they're generally very happy. They're cats, and just like house cats, if you give them food and water and toys and affection then they're content to just lay around all day and be cats.

People have a tendency to romanticize animals in the wild struggling (and sometimes failing) to survive, and therefore assume that the animal would be happier fighting for their life than being cared for. Granted, sometimes this is true, but for a lot of animals it isn't."
nanocurrency,fdqr6ve,t3_emseof,1578673128.0,"It should have had a little text that said ""And no fees!"""
Stargate,fdnc4mm,t1_fdn0n7j,1578582599.0,I always found this line really clunky. I think it ruins an important moment in the show.
PublicFreakout,fdksuji,t1_fdkphpw,1578510439.0,"At this point, supporting Trump goes way beyond ""political opinion"". He's human garbage and saying you ""love him"" is just gross.

To the people down voting me: this man has straight up killed people to suppress impeachment headlines in the news, he's responsible for putting children in cages and people dying in concentration camps because they have brown skin, he's bragged about sexual assault, he's bragged about perving on underage girls, he's mocked the disabled, he's attacked war heros and gold star families, he's pardoned murderers. These are absolutely not political opinions. These are disgusting acts by a disgusting man."
PublicFreakout,fdksnps,t1_fdknqdy,1578510327.0,">I love Trump.

Not even Melania says that."
PublicFreakout,fdkshfc,t1_fdkqkmy,1578510223.0,"Illegal immigration was also falling sharply during the Obama administration. So, Trump's biggest accomplishment, according to this guy, is being President after Obama."
PublicFreakout,fdks0ui,t1_fdkpugn,1578509949.0,Liberals tend to be better educated and work in higher paying jobs where they're allowed to use their phone at work?
PublicFreakout,fdkrsh0,t1_fdknyhk,1578509809.0,"Well, he didn't become a Trump supporter be being intelligent."

Bitcoin,fcxsf2g,t1_fcxppjt,1578069768.0,Especially since it's effectively controlled by China at this point.
facepalm,fcxnhpy,t1_fcxlqjj,1578067138.0,Trump assassinated Iran's #2 using the US military to start a war because he desperately wants to get re-elected.

startrek,fcx8kub,t1_fcx5age,1578055495.0,Because Romulus was destroyed in the current timeline.
Metroid,fcx7d5l,t3_ejbvrp,1578054210.0,It holds your hand like you're an old woman in a nursing home that needs to use the toilet.
nanocurrency,fcvwjzg,t1_fcvmxeg,1578011718.0,"Yeah, I've tried that. It works, but it's super janky and not very user friendly."
nanocurrency,fcvgmuf,t1_fcv7xju,1578001684.0,Except that it needs to be transmitted to the receiver...? What does storing it locally accomplish?
nanocurrency,fcv7c7d,t3_ej0ku3,1577996153.0,"After playing around with Nano for selling stuff, I had the same issue. I couldn't tell which payment was for what item. It really needs a memo field. Sure, there are complex layer 2 solutions, but I'd like to use Nano and just Nano."
aww,fcr2zem,t1_fcqk22f,1577896033.0,Of course it's a thing. Some pets need their glasses to drive.
mildlyinfuriating,fcmft71,t1_fcm8jtm,1577773657.0,If you have cats be careful. That stuff will kill a cat.
investing,fcllktv,t1_fclelmb,1577750634.0,"I've done a lot of research on Nano, including a deep dive into the code. I see no reason to believe it's less secure."

investing,fcknv3o,t1_fck9386,1577729381.0,"Then there's Nano which is nearly instant, free, decentralized, and doesn't destroy the planet. I honestly don't understand the point of Bitcoin when Nano exists."
blackmagicfuckery,fckdo13,t1_fcjyrxr,1577722992.0,"Also, we can process certain visuals up to 500fps."
