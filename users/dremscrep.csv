But this kicked. I marked the fuck out.

That’s also why I live okadas last moments in most of his matches.

He hits a Rainmaker and doesn’t pin his opponent. He pulls them up and goes for a second one and then they counter that one somehow and that’s where the match will be decided.

Then there was Okadas top rope elbow drop through the table and I thought that he honestly fucked his elbow so there was that.

And then the best spot was the finish with it being a time limit draw and I lost my shit because it was just so smart and I couldn’t imagine it to get down to a draw.

I have a weird relationship with 4 because I always think about it as I can admit that it IS better then 2 but I think it objectively and not subjectively.
