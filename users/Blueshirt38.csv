Having every form of wild animal and livestock shitting in front of my yard where I walk around barefoot would be a bad thing, and I am all for zoning regulations.

Genocide requires that a person knowingly, and intentionally murdered or attempted to murder the entirety, or part of a group of a race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion. 

In your world view, anyone who texts while driving should also be charged with attempted murder for every single car they pass. Who cares if the court system is bogged down with 100 new cases each day of soccer moms with 150+ attempted murder charges that will all get thrown out, right?"
Wellthatsucks,fffjqsy,t1_ffff809,1579885452.0,"It is tempered glass, which has been purposefully heated until it is stressed in a way that makes it harder, but also makes it shatter into very tiny pieces. Tempered glass, like what is in your car windows, is incredibly hard and durable to the point that it can be hard to break with full power blows from a hammer; in that same vein, a very small amount of pressure on the edges of the glass will surely make it shatter.

Think of it like a [sawn plank](https://www.grandior.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Quartersawn-Riftsawn-Lumber-Difference-Diagram.jpg) of wood from a tree. The growth rings will run from end to end. An axe strike to the face (long flat side) of the wood would do little damage, but an axe blow to the end (so with the bit of the axe striking between the growth rings) will split a whole chunk off. The stress lines in tempered glass are somewhat similar.

When the guy in the video levered the pane of glass up on it's edge, ~~it was resting the full weight of that heavy glass on the tiny, thin corner on hard, rough stone~~ it slipped off of the supports put at both ends, and struck the stone paver underneath. The stone probably chipped just the most microscopic shard of glass which sent a shockwave through the entire pane, making it explode."

As an ABH, I don't really have a direct civilian equivalent, but if I went to crash school, I could easily be making twice what the Navy would pay an lower enlisted if I went to a DOD airport to work base fire. Had an ABH2 buddy do exactly that.

Infantry and special forces is about the only thing in the military without a semi-equivalent civilian role (I don't count LEO, because the only real comparison is fitness, guns, and people hating you). Whether you're a Seabee, an IS, AE, AC, EOD, HM, YN, RP, ND... there is a civilian company that will pay you substantially more money for an easier working environment, and you probably don't have to not see your family for 11 months straight.
