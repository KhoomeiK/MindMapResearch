victorinox,ff339w8,t3_er5psd,1579532558.0,"I have a lot of respect for the combo blade. The serrations are good for cutting cordage, and it keeps the knife ""sharp"" if you're doing rough stuff and can't touch up the blade for a while. Also, it's a nice design - compare with most other combo edge blades - because the straight edge is near the base, allowing for fine work/control. Just sayin'.

Edit: almost forgot! The serrations are fairly easy to sharpen if you get yourself a Sharpmaker."

Just because something is popular, and popular with the ""wrong"" people, is no reason to bash it, yet I think that's most of the ""hate"" (haven't seen any real hate for SD either tbh) for part III - misplaced anger toward the actual part and the perception of ""starfucker"" phony fans. 

SD is one of the few things in this world that give me joy. It's ridiculous in the best way. For a  weekly serialized cliffhanger adventure aimed at young boys, it's ðŸ˜˜ðŸ‘Œ. Of course there are flaws and missed opportunities. It might be my favorite part, but DIU probably own that spot."
