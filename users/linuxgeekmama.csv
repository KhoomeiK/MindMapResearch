An error in PD is effectively adding prism to your glasses prescription. I have a degree in physics, so I was interested in some numbers. Here be math beyond this point, so you shouldn’t read further if that frightens you.

There’s an equation for determining how badly an error in PD will affect you:

P = cf

where P is prism (in diopters)

c is the error in pupillary distance (in cm, so divide the error in the distance in mm by 10). If you have an error of 2mm, your number here would be 0.2.

f is the power of the lens (in diopters, which is what the numbers on your glasses prescription probably are). The sign doesn’t affect what we’re trying to find here, so, say, -3 and +3 are equivalent for this calculation.

Now you’ve got the level of prism that an error in PD will give you, what does that mean? That link explains it, but the TL;DR is:

The smallest amount of prism you might get in a prescription is 0.25. If you need a prism correction less than that, your optician likely won’t bother with it.

ANSI standards for deviation of prism in eyeglass lenses is no more than 0.67. Don’t order a pair of glasses with more error than that.

I’d tell her about some of the things her parents are full of shit about (or, if we’re being charitable, are later proven to have been wrong about).

Judaism,ff80lnk,t1_ff7wynb,1579662880.0,"There might not be overt pressure to get married and have kids.

If all the programming for singles has a goal of getting singles into couples, that’s not so attractive to a single person who doesn’t particularly want to be part of a couple.

My husband and I are Conservative, and had kids fairly late. We found that a lot of the programs at synagogues we went to weren’t really relevant to us at our stage in life. We could see that there weren’t a lot of singles or adults without children who were coming to synagogue events. A lot of liberal Jews stop going to synagogue after bar/bat mitzvah, or after they’re past college Hillel, and they don’t come back to shul until they have kids. There’s no inherent reason why somebody wouldn’t be interested in spirituality in the phase of life between adolescence or college and having kids, but there’s just not a lot there at many synagogues for those people.

And we weren’t opposed to having kids, or unable to have kids. We knew we wanted kids, but not yet. I’m sure it’s all the more alienating for people in those situations."

Buddhism provides more of a role for people who can’t or don’t want to get married and have kids."

bipolar,fekijdj,t1_fejto5y,1579200769.0,"One of the things that makes life with bipolar more difficult is stigma. It makes it more difficult for bipolar people to get help when we need it.

And I think that blanket questions like “should bipolar people have kids” contributes to the stigma.

Native Americans and white people in the US are more than twice as likely to kill themselves than people of other backgrounds are. Being white or Native American is, of course, hereditary. But you would be shunned by the vast majority of decent people if you were to say that white people and Native Americans shouldn’t have kids for that reason.

This is why I think we have to leave the decision to have kids or not to individual bipolar people (and white people and Native Americans).

China Standard Time and Eastern Daylight Time are 12 hours apart, so it will generally be night in China when it’s daytime on the East coast of the US, and the moon will not be visible in China when it is visible in the US. Therefore, when it is daytime in the US and the moon is visible, it will be night in China and the moon will not be visible."

People used to think there might be plant life on Mars, because Mars had surface markings that seemed to change over time. It turned out to be dust storms.

You can’t just look for something that changes over the planet’s year, because that might be something like the dust storms on Mars, Looking for something green isn’t guaranteed to work, because there are green rocks, and we don’t even know if extraterrestrial plant life would be green. It’s hard to find something if you aren’t sure what you’re looking for."
explainlikeimfive,fdpbcyk,t3_em7j5m,1578624389.0,"It’s hard to see a small faint thing when it’s very close to a large bright thing. 

Stars produce light, and planets only reflect it, so stars will appear brighter than planets. Planets are often much smaller than stars, which makes it more difficult. 

Planets are also very close to stars, in comparison to the distance from the stars to us. It takes light about four hours to travel from the Sun to Neptune. By comparison, light takes a bit over four years to travel from the Sun to our nearest neighboring star, Proxima Centauri. 

An astronomer in the Proxima Centauri system would see Neptune as small, faint, and close to the Sun, all of which would make it hard to pick out. It’s going to be worse if you’re looking at a more distant star, a smaller planet, or a planet closer to its star. The planets that we think are most likely to have intelligent life are small and close to their stars."

todayilearned,fdlwust,t3_elm2ee,1578534417.0,"The environment in which humans live is changing, so that changes the selection pressures on humans. The sickle cell mutation can be beneficial in an environment where malaria is common. The resistance to malaria that you get from one copy of the gene is beneficial enough to outweigh the serious health effects of having two copies. In an environment where malaria is rare, there’s not much benefit from having a single copy, so the mutation is generally harmful.

There isn’t really any such thing as a fittest organism- only the organism that is fittest in a particular environment. Change the environment, and you change who is the fittest."

I haven’t really heard the stereotype about Chinese people eating dogs applied to Chinese restaurants in America. About people eating dogs in China, yes. At least in the places I’ve lived, Chinese restaurants are so mainstream that you really wouldn’t expect to hear that kind of thing, except maybe from really old people. And I don’t think anybody would take it seriously enough that it would make them not want to go to a restaurant that they otherwise would have gone to."

relationships,fdkpowo,t3_eln6go,1578508562.0,"As for whether she’s justified in feeling upset, things like tone and context are critical here. Did you take an “I don’t believe I have to explain this to an adult” or “Why didn’t you read the fine print when we signed up for the card”, exasperated or condescending type of tone when you explained how the card worked? Or did you explain very basic things, that she already knew, and not give her a chance to say “yes, I know that, what I want to know is this other thing”? Was the conversation almost entirely you talking to her, like a teacher in a lecture class? Were you talking down to her?

If you did those things, it’s really no mystery why she might feel upset. Unfortunately, those are kind of common dynamics when men explain things to women, and a lot of us find it REALLY annoying when they do it. 

It’s especially annoying when it’s a pattern that happens a lot in a conversation with a man. That can lead me to wonder if he thinks I’m stupid. That’s often what’s going on with a disproportionate reaction to something minor- it’s not just what happened this time, it’s that it’s part of a pattern.

Note: I am on the autism spectrum, and am generally pretty deaf to tone in conversations. If I notice this kind of thing and am annoyed by it, it’s a pretty safe bet that most other women do, too."

ETA: I feel cornered when somebody insists on being with me and talking about it to me immediately after I’ve heard something that makes me very emotional. You do not want to be around me when I feel cornered."
