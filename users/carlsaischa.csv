videos,fc2f7jf,t1_fc2ejpn,1577356749.0,">You realize that’s real money trading hands

USDT is very very far from real money.

But sure go ahead, try to sell $40M of BTC by pressing sell at market and watch all your money go away.

Just as an example, the exchange reporting the highest volume on CMC is Tagz.com (never fucking heard of it lol).

If you look at the trades there : https://trade.tagz.com/trade/view

You can see almost none of them are less than $1k which is already very suspicious, unless it is a niche site for whales you would expect trades of all sizes. Now you have sites that either have this pattern or one where bots trade a fraction of a coin every few ms.

No matter, this shall all be resolved once we see the bustling activity regarding Tagz on Reddit. Surely it will correlate with them being the biggest exchange, right?
[Oh hey look it appears no one is giving a shit.](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=tagz)

Other social media tells the same story : fb/tagzexchange/ (gimped link because facebook links are banned here apparently)

Also, CMC is a tool used to prop up the whole ecosystem to make it seem much much larger than it is. Use sites that report the real underlying volume.

Even here you see you have Binance at the top, which trades against USDT, e.g. not real volume either."
