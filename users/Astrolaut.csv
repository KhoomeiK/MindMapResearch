todayilearned,fc2w1py,t1_fbzmdh1,1577375557.0,"Really? I never did track in school, but I didn't think 12 mph was anything that amazing. I didn't get into running until my mid twenties, but I was always athletic, and that was a pretty easy speed for me to get. There's a pretty big difference between a 17 year old and a 25 year old though. I hit a wall trying to hold 16 mph for more than 20-30 seconds and eventually blew my knee out... sprained my left knee three times in my life before getting into running."
todayilearned,fc2ve0d,t1_fbzh64t,1577375069.0,"I got down to a 4:18 mile and 8:46 for two miles. I could also keep up 8 miles/near indefinitely. I was running 6 miles a day for 6 months or so. After my morning run, I'd bike 5 miles, than go to a landscaping job that had me outside and walking about 10 miles a day, then I'd bike 5 miles back, I'd also do a whole lot of pushups... then usually drink too much beer. Don't recommend that part, but it's evidence of the average part I guess.

I've also sprained my left knee three times in my life so my knee hurts if I run near a mile again, but I can still go pretty fast in emergencies. Just my anecdotal experience."

The truly destitute aren't begging outside Chipotle they're going to homeless shelters and food shelves. 

I know, it's hard and depressing. I've given away hundreds or thousands of dollars to people begging on the street. I've since stopped that after spending time with homeless people in their makeshift villages and doing volunteer work for local homeless shelters. I've actually seen local beggars take down their signs, walk two blocks, and get into a BMW.

You seem like a good and generous guy. If you really want to help give some money and time to the local food shelf."
