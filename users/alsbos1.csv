Stronglifts5x5,fffty6p,t1_fff0qri,1579891732.0,"Everyone is different.  Personally if I was plateauing on bench, and not on the other lifts, I would increase the volume with accessories on the days I wasn’t benching.  Dips, incline, close grip, close grip incline, 2 ct pause, your choice.  Maybe do 3 sets of 8-10.  You could also, on bench days, bench before squatting."

And the purported reason for neutering a male doesn't even make that much sense, since spaying the females solves the population control problem.

Your dog doesn’t want to be on your leash."
nottheonion,ff3sjrd,t1_ff33vhs,1579547925.0,"People, at work, do things \*thinking\* that the employer will reward them at a later time for their efforts.  It's important to note that your only reward for working is what your contract says, nothing more.  Did your manager every promise you something if your did XYZ?  If not, then don't expect it.  And if they 'promised', that's still not the same thing as providing it in writing.  Many managers will 'imply' that 'good things' will happen if you do XYZ.  This counts for nothing.  The agreement needs to be spelled out, clearly, for both parties to understand, or it means nothing."
Stronglifts5x5,ff3rr4b,t3_ergkqi,1579547435.0,"A year? I guess SL is sometimes sold as a long term program, but it makes more sense as a 3-4 month intro to lifting during your LP.  Barbell Medicine has some nice programs that might enjoy more."

Stronglifts5x5,fe9srlb,t3_eo6exa,1578941159.0,"I've heard SS coaches talk about increasing reps instead of increasing weight.  For instance, if you did 3 reps last time, your goal would be to get 4 or 5 next time.  Its not ideal, and you'll need to avoid deloading as long as your reps are improving."
Stronglifts5x5,fe9rss1,t3_eo1li5,1578940938.0,"Another possibility, you're at the end of LP.  You've been lifting at your very limits, and when reality hits one day at the gym, you can barely lift 20lbs less then you were doing 3 days ago.  But it just a matter of time till you return to your average."

Stronglifts5x5,fdvdz32,t1_fdv90nc,1578746393.0,"If you're going for time under tension then you would use a lower weight and higher reps (and maybe switch to a Romanian deadlift so you don't go so low).  But if you're doing 5x5 and giving it everything you have, then I would lower the weight quickly...otherwise you need to maintain your lower back the entire movement back down. But I'm no expert!"

They are literally trained to believe that firing people before they can retire is a sign that they ‘understand’ the business.  I just left a place where they fired an entire department, and everyone had to reapply for their jobs...part of their rational was they wanted to cull the mentally weak who cracked under the pressure of potential unemployment."

StartingStrength,fcx7yde,t3_ej0t9m,1578054843.0,"I think this is a good reason to do different routines when cutting.  For instance, switch to higher reps, do pause or pin squats and pause deadlifts, and close grip incline bench.  Stuff like that.  Then, you have no idea that your 1rms are falling, but youre still lifting and dealing with the challenges of learning the new lifts."

Coding jobs are easily outsourced overseas, and as you get older, it's probably challenging to stay employed.  You can't outsource trucking and plumbing jobs to India.

WhitePeopleTwitter,fcdm6bg,t1_fccwhk5,1577611334.0,"I assure you, plenty of diabetes drug discovery programs crash and burn leaving nothing but sunk costs and layoffs.  You must develop something patentable and much better than existing treatments.  Then you must get it through the FDA and all the clinical studies, where it could fail for any number of unforeseen reasons.  At the end of all this, you might be left with 10 years of patent life.  It’s not a sure thing, or everyone would be doing it."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fccrn6z,t1_fc9bjk5,1577601824.0,"But you’re excluding the research costs that exist prior to be able to produce anything.  You probably have to do 100 million $ of clinical studies just to get FDA approval.  And after spending that 100 million, you have no guarantee that you’ll get approval, or that the market for your product will even exist.   And to get that 100 million, you have to find investors, and investors will want a BIG return on a risky investment, and this is a 5-10 year investment.  So an investor puts in 10 million, and might have to wait 10 years to see a pay out."

It was extremely skittish, and we were told the dog would panic at the sight of children.  We told the shelter there was no way that would work for us, we had 2 young kids.
