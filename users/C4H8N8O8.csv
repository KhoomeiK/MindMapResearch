And I didn't meant that Java OOP is the best (I've heard great things about the JS one, but I'm not qualified for that) Just that it's the most comprehensive. Its pretty explicit and that helps a lot.

And learning to code goes beyond the absolute basics. Bulnding a basic reddit bot is a nice easy project I would do to learn python. You need to use several external libraries. Even if the script it's a simple search, replace and post."

Probably the best languages to learn are Java and Python. And I would say that Java is the best if you are learning yourself, python if you have a teacher who you can ask. There is a lot of documentation for Java.
