CPTSD,ff86ja0,t1_ff6yyfn,1579667391.0,"I agree with you! I see what you’re saying and to be clear, my post wasn’t meant to say anyone with trauma has c/ptsd. I think trauma can exist and does exist within everyone outside of c/ptsd.
Perhaps I’m being too lenient with the word “trauma.” But at that point it’s semantics. To me it just means something someone found incredibly distressing and difficult to deal with. Something above the small, daily, healthy stresses of life. And what someone finds distressing is up to them to decide. 

I do most certainly think people have trauma, are sad, are stressed without having ptsd, depression or anxiety. 

I just mainly wish people could see that sometimes their feelings aren’t just out of the blue. Our feelings have a purpose! And quite frankly we don’t function with enough space for everyone to listen to how we feel, and I’m sure that’s got a lot to do with “depression” and what not increasing, even in people with healthy childhoods."
CPTSD,ff85x6j,t1_ff76yeu,1579666888.0,"One thing I didnt really clarify is that I don’t believe everyone with trauma has ptsd. I think trauma is defined by the individual experiencing it. And people certainly have been traumatized and have learned to cope and manage those feelings. I think it’s when someone has been traumatized and have not had the chance or ability to learn to handle it that it can turn to ptsd. Even still, I think anyone who experiences trauma (which is every last one of us) will have it shape who we are to some degree. Which isn’t a bad thing. I’d say it’s up to you and your doctors discretion as to what you have (obviously.) But I think if these things are distressing to you and affecting you in any way similar as described in a ptsd diagnosis, it still matters no matter the label. My cptsd can be boiled down to a bully older brother and shitty parenting. But there are a lot of nuances in my childhood, and a lot of others childhoods that took a situation some people could cope with and turned it into something that felt horrifying and would stick with them. 
I guess what you’re describing is near exactly what I’m saying. Anything we feel can be minimized to trauma, even if we don’t have c/ptsd."
CPTSD,ff85fat,t1_ff7d8k7,1579666486.0,"(This is literally partially a copy and paste response to another comment, but I already had the same thoughts.) I personally think trauma is defined by the person going through it. One thing I didn’t clearly explain in my post was that I’m not saying everyone had ptsd. But that sometimes their feelings, especially those strong and recurrent enough to be classified as something like depression or anxiety, may stem from trauma. I definitely feel ptsd is another beast than trauma alone. 
I also agree that people can come from good circumstances but maybe they’ve ended up in not so great ones. Also, a parent could be doing everything right and a child can still be traumatized. I do think In those situations it would not be classified as ptsd or cptsd, but that the cause of their mental issues still comes from trauma. 
I have questioned why it is i have cptsd to both my therapists. Because my childhood wasn’t “awful.” It certainly wasn’t great but I’m sure many people would brush off whats happening to me. I thought it was because I was weak, or less resilient. Regardless, one explained that when you have repeated traumas that are similar, it’s harder to cope. In that same vein, my other therapist explained people are more likely to develop ptsd when they lack support after the trauma occurs. Nobody ever noticed my emotional distress and so the cause of my distress was never changed and I never got the support I needed when I would go through it. I appreciated their input as they both have some trauma experience (one is literally a trauma counselor.) it made me feel like it wasn’t so embarrassing to have this diagnosis when my trauma didn’t seem to be “bad enough.” Since as you said, lots of people walk away relatively okay, or just fine. 
I hope that makes sense. I feel bad for not explaining clearly in the original post!"
CPTSD,ff84p8o,t1_ff7he4i,1579665920.0,"Have you ever heard of Johann Hari? He has a few ted talks and other speeches about this sort of stuff, mainly addiction and depression. He talks a lot about how medicine have their place but sometimes depression and anxiety “make sense.” I like that wording, I definitely do not believe medication is a cure all. I’ve been mentally ill for many years now but just recently decided I needed help from something other than what I had been getting. So I’ve been taking medication. Having cptsd I for sure will say my depression “makes sense” and that the most important tool I have to healing and treating this is therapy. But medicine is something I still value. Just wish people didn’t think it was all they needed, that the ONLY thing wrong is the chemicals in their brains."

mentalhealth,ff57flp,t3_erosx3,1579582422.0,"At 13 I was horribly depressed to the point of barely being able to function. My primary care doctor said I wasn’t depressed, yet giving me antidepressants. I spent the next 4 years in nearly the same state. I think it took a suicide attempt to get professionally diagnosed with depression, anxiety and social anxiety. And guess what!!! I don’t have depression. I have cptsd. (Depression is a symptom of cptsd.) Which is something I began looking into a few months ago. I still don’t know that I have a technical diagnosis, even though my therapist and psychiatrist both have said I have it. I’m getting officially diagnosed in a few days. Cptsd made WAY more sense for me than depression. And I’m honestly so relieved to have a diagnosis that makes sense. I’m happy i began googling this stuff. The point of that? Some professionals are wrong. Some people don’t spend enough time to look at all the factors of why someone is feeling a certain way. It’s easier to say someone is depressed and give them meds. Sometimes even professionals aren’t experienced enough to identify certain things. If you’re uncertain, it wouldn’t hurt to get more opinions. And critically assess yourself in regards to any diagnosis. Don’t lie to yourself to fit into any one diagnosis. If you’re honest with yourself and still feel very connected to a specific diagnosis, bring it up. Explain to the professionals you’re not trying to self diagnose. But you’d like to look more critically at what’s going on for you. You know yourself best. And it’s better to have a deeper understanding of what’s wrong so you can fix it/heal it."
CPTSD,ff56iq4,t3_erp53h,1579581639.0,"I personally believe so. If you like reading try overcoming shock by Diane zimberoff and David Hartman.

My therapist and I do the hypnotherapy referenced in the book, and whether or not Im recalling real memories, it’s helpful. And I’ve recalled my birth several times, and it’s kinda explained quite a few of my feelings."

mentalhealth,ff55xuw,t3_erp81y,1579581158.0,"You sound kinda like my boyfriend. What I try to get him to understand firstly is that it’s my choice whether or not I’d be better off without him. You’re not going to see yourself the way she sees you, ever. Hopefully you’ll see yourself with more love in the future. But regardless you can never know someone’s perspective of you because you’re not them. I’d say for starters try to accept that you don’t understand and you don’t need to. Just trust her when she says she loves you. 

Then I’d definitely recommend trying to rethink your own perspective on yourself, which I know is probably way more of a challenge than the above.  And trust me I don’t think it’s easy. I hate myself immensely, too. Regardless I hope you eventually learn to be kinder to yourself."
depression,ff55k3j,t1_ff5523a,1579580848.0,"Yeah, I relate to that too. As I said the best thing would probably be a therapist. A trauma therapist at that. I just started seeing a trauma therapist (I’ve been seeing a regular therapist over a year now and she’s been very helpful) and from my understanding she and I will go through my core beliefs and try to essentially reframe my thinking. It’s called CBT if I’m not mistaken. Some people also use EMDR. Feel free to look into either. It will ultimately be up to you what you feel is best for you."

I personally think it’s more likely you’re dissociated on some level because losing or the possibility of losing a parent is horrifying, especially if you’re younger. But really at any age. I don’t think that alone would make you some sort of socio/psychopath. People deal with loss in different ways.

I’m not sure where you’re from but I’m in America and there are places here that offer low income mental health services. I, personally have ptsd.

depression,ff1j4t3,t3_er4g9u,1579480030.0,"I cant say what it will be like for you. But my therapist and I talk about things during the week that have been bothering me, and we look at why it bothers me and when it first began. We also do trauma related therapy (and everyone has trauma.) for us that is hypnotherapy, other people do EMDR. It will be up to your therapists discretion and abilities to decide what path your treatments will take. I’d say the most important thing that I get out of therapy is insight. I use it as a tool to understand myself more and try to find ways to improve my situation. 

As for my first session, I did all the talking. But that’s because of my mental state back then. If I had been more quiet I’m sure she would’ve been more inquisitive about my past and my current mental state day to day. I’ve heard a lot of therapists start with a simple “what brings you here?” 

I’ve been in therapy (with my current therapist) a bit over a year. And it has helped immensely. I had a few therapists before but they never were as helpful as my current one. (Partly because I decided on my own to start therapy with this therapist.) I’m starting therapy with an additional counselor and I recently started seeing a psychiatrist. I’m a huge advocate for therapy. I think as soon as someone decides to reach out for help, things slowly get better.

TW suicide mention
I’ve always had severe anxiety as long as I could remember. As a child I had anxiety and anger issues. As time went on, and puberty hit around 13 it turned into depression and that’s what I went on believing it was up until I was 21, where I’m at now. In the time before I had dissociative episodes, relationship and control issues, was in and out of therapy, ended up in a mental hospital at 17 for attempting suicide. And despite having gone through at least one blaringly obvious traumatic event at 15, nobody questioned that maybe I was struggling so much for any other reason than depression. Around 18 I improved for about a year, but at 19/20 I went back downhill and went back to therapy. Over the course of a year working with my therapist (who never diagnosed me) I began to learn about cptsd and after hitting a low and deciding to get extra help through medicine I’ve been diagnosed with cptsd, and the depression is a symptom. Learning about my diagnosis is what made me realize just how intense my symptoms were getting, since it’s only after I turned 20 that I began to let go of my vices that protected me from feeling my trauma."

I’ll refrain from my urge to bash religion. I’ll say I can see his point in this lesson, but I feel your implication was that you feel you’re being punished because perhaps you’re not being “good.” Forgive me if thats an incorrect assumption. But even though I know you don’t believe in god, (I don’t either obviously) I think especially still being in school, someone who is supposed to be teaching you is implying certain things on impressionable people. Impressionable minds can take god out of the equation if that doesn’t fit their story. They will hear whatever their brain wants them to. 
I definitely think some cases of depression are “bad luck.” A mix of genetics and a random chemical imbalance. But I do believe some cases are part of a bigger issue. Sometimes, people are born into situations they have no say in. Sometimes, these situations teach people at a very young age very skewed perceptions, that cause a lot of pain. Like “you’re experiencing something bad because YOU are bad.” And you’re not. Bad shit happens to good people. Good shit happens to bad people. I don’t disagree that when someone commits truly harmful acts they are not doing so with a healthy mind. But even then, at the end of the day - hurt people hurt people.
We are animals with biological programming. Sometimes this programming glitches. In a lot of ways our hardware has not caught up to our software. And this has caused a lot of problems, even though our software has a lot of potential. This isn’t about god. It’s about our brains. It’s about our biology. And believe it or not, our emotions serve us the way our bodies do. Sometimes our feelings/brains don’t work the way they should - the way sometimes our bodies don’t always work the way they should. Psychology is something I feel we don’t understand anywhere near as well as physiology. 

Also, You don’t gotta be grateful for anything. I definitely think gratitude is a helpful tool and can improve mood but not when it’s forced. If you’re not grateful for anything, that’s okay. Like I said. There are a lot of things we didn’t ask for that we go through - especially as kids/young adults. I’d say work on identifying the cause of the depression. Is there anything in your life that would make sense for it to make someone depressed? If not, is this a solely chemical issue? And what steps can be taken to help in any case."

For example (and THIS might seem silly!) I had a piece of pie my nana made in the fridge at my boyfriends house (his moms house.) She ate it without asking and I, without her knowing, cried pretty hard about it. It made me so upset. I am 21 years old but I was so hurt. I quickly realized this wasn’t about her eating my pie. It was that when I was younger any treat my mom had for me my brother would eat without asking. It was about respect to me. I feel kinda wary that your partner refuses to help out or pick up after themselves. In situations that spark intense emotions it’s undoubtedly crucial both parties take responsibility for their feelings and actions. But also should come to a compromise. I didn’t make my boyfriends mom feel bad, I wasn’t even mad at her. I just asked that next time if she sees food she knows isn’t hers, she asks before eating it. And I’ve also done my part in marking anything that’s mine. I don’t think people are sensitive for no reason. But even if that’s the case here, compromise and respect are incredibly important."

I believe you when you say you’ve come to terms with it. I’m 21, so it hasn’t been that long since she passed. But when she did, for a while she never showed up in my dreams. I was quite spiritual for a while and I had I think one dream in which I suspected a possible visit. All I remember was she looked a bit younger, and she was wearing a beautiful dress and her hair and makeup was done. She was beautiful. And she was happy. Every other dream I had for years was either her returning from some unknown vacation or something. I can still feel the excitement from those dreams. Or I’d be completely aware she was dead and had come back to life. None of the dreams I had of her was she the same to me. There was usually this sense of grief remaining as no matter what, the mom i knew had left. Either way, most of these dreams were mostly nice. I enjoyed seeing her, even if it wasn’t a visit. Even if it wasn’t 100% her. As time has gone on and I’ve had to begin to really process her death, I’ve had some awful awful nightmares. They usually involve the same premise, her returning or lately it’s been I move back in with her - and she hates me. She wants nothing to do with me and In some she’s gone out of her way to make my life suck. I know for me these are related to my psychological issues regarding her death. I agree with other comments that it could just be a nightmare. No matter what, we’ve suffered a loss and I’m sure somewhere within us will always be a part that grieves, a part that distorts things. Dreams, I think, are usually just subconscious signals- or just filtering. If you feel at peace, then feel at peace. Night mares are just night mares sometimes."

(I like makartt, their pink kit I think has everything you need.) look up some YouTube vids before doing so first. If you want natural nails - wearing nail polish, a strengthening base coat and cuticle oil."

I will say regardless of what directions say, if the directions aren’t getting you the desired results you might need to break the rules lol. The worst that can happen is that it won’t work. Also, If you mean makartt polygel - it’s what I use and it’s my absolute favorite. Do you have dual forms? I find that dual forms make polygel pretty fool proof."
mentalhealth,fdwhc2q,t3_en8ynk,1578758696.0,"Wow, I’m sorry you’re going through this. I know I cant know what you do about the relationship. But his physical contact does concern me of course. By the sounds of it, he has made up his mind about this. I would recommend looking for emotional support about this elsewhere and try to let him diffuse his feelings on his own. I’d say don’t give it much attention. If he tries to start something put up a temporary boundary that you don’t want to get into it. I think maybe once he’s calmed down, you should GENTLY ask if he’s thought about getting help. Not just medicine. In my opinion medication is rarely the only answer. I think therapy is the most important thing. Unfortunately therapy can only help to the extent the patient is cooperative. I think therapy can be a wonderful thing for literally anyone. Anyways, I’m sorry this is happening. I hope you keep yourself safe."
Nails,fdwdyi5,t1_fdtq76u,1578757716.0,"Can I ask what polygel you were using? Im pretty sure with any type of gel product a base coat is necessary. You need it for poly gel, builder gel, gel polish and I’m assuming builder in a bottle."

mentalhealth,fdq6sgq,t3_emnwrz,1578657325.0,"I had long hair (super long hair) most of my life and it became a part of my identity. There was a point in my depression that it made me feel awful because even if I did keep up, it was always frizzy and greasy. I kept getting urges to shave it. And after a few years, I did. And I’ve never grown it out past my shoulders since. I currently have a pixie cut. I will say some days you gotta wet it and brush it into place. But there are a lot of days I can just use my hands to make it look okay. I say do it!"

therapy,fdox566,t3_emhdh9,1578614892.0,I super relate! I’m always worried about overstepping with my therapist but man do I wish therapists could be a little less formal. My therapist let’s me email her but it’s really just for venting purposes and I think she just skims. She never replies. If yours says you can email - do it! I’d just say “hey these are some things I’d like to address whenever possible.” And ask your question or express anxiety. If he doesn’t answer I’m sure it can be brought up in the next session. At least he’s aware of it and at least you’ve put it somewhere.

If you want my personal account I mean I let go of a very unhealthy relationship that patched up the grief of losing my mom. It took two, actually.

depression,fdkjusb,t1_fdkcf83,1578505172.0,"That’s not the point of medication. I highly recommend seeing a therapist in tandem with medicine. Medicine, in most psychiatric cases, is used so you are able to make the proper mental progress to where you can be functioning and happy without the medicine. I am 21, I’ve had severe depression since I was 13, most of those years I spent daydreaming of Killing myself. At 17 I attempted. This entire time I was resistant to medication not even because I didn’t want to get better but because I thought I could get better on my own. For a few years after my suicide attempt I did get better but at 20, my progress slowed and I finally decided to try medicine. I saw just a therapist for over a year (and definitely made progress in that time) before making the decision to get medication. I now see two therapists and a psychiatrist. In my opinion Medication should rarely be used as a life long fix. I decided to make the choice because I needed more help and recognized that. I don’t intend on taking it forever, but it’s only been a few months since starting and it’s been important in my progress. It won’t fix everything. But the idea is that meds give you the ability to function a little better so you can have the opportunity to work on the emotional stuff that’s going on- that normally impairs function - with your therapist. It sounds like you have people who really care about you around you. Ask for help. My #1 recommendation is therapy."
CPTSD,fddgyc1,t3_eksc0t,1578311818.0,I’m happy you’re learning to take care of yourself. I’m sorry you weren’t taught that from the get go.
mentalillness,fdddpqy,t1_fddd6ld,1578307429.0,"To jump in, I don’t think that it has to be a direct response to anxiety. She could be remembering a stressful situation. 

I think trying your best is all you can do. You’re right that you can’t control what she does when you’re not there, but when you’re able to guide her, I’d say that’s still important.

I agree that you should teach her about the consequences of over eating but I’d urge you not to make it about appearance. I know that could possibly push into a different food problem down the line. We often switch one unhealthy habit for another. 

I believe the number one most important thing is to talk to her about the reason she does it, and do what’s possible to alleviate the pain there. You can try to fix the habit, but that’s just symptom control. And honestly If you talk to her and you’re not getting anywhere, therapy might be something to consider. 

Of course these are just my opinions. You know your daughter best and I hope you can work something out."

depression,fcjcc2e,t3_egzqgq,1577682853.0,"I know that must feel pretty bad, but I hope you can be a bit more forgiving with yourself. I think that when people punish themselves for doing something that is ultimately punishing themselves in the first place, it just creates a cycle of guilt/self inflicted consequences. I’m not sure if that makes sense but an example I can give is maybe someone has a hard time cleaning their room because they’re depressed. If they are hard on themselves about it, they add more weight to that depression on their shoulders. Which makes it even harder to get up and clean. But if someone can be gentle and forgive themselves for their lack of motivation, it can be a bit easier to get up and clean. May not be enough to make them do so, but at least that added weight isn’t there holding them back."
therapy,fbszklh,t3_ee68to,1577064371.0,"This kind of reminds me of the idea behind meditation. “Watching your thoughts.” Our first impulsive thoughts do not define our character it’s what we do with them, and THAT is part
of what makes a person emotionally intelligent. I even think people who go through with their impulses can be emotionally intelligent, because you can be aware of what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. You might just struggle with finding an alternative. There’s different levels of it of course. But to answer you simply, I’d say it’s completely possible to be emotionally intelligent and still have suicidal ideations."
