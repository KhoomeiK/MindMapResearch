AskReddit,ff8wwgh,t1_ff8muho,1579698754.0,I can relate to that. Around my friends we laugh at each other's jokes all the time but we all have a pretty surreal sense of humor. If I tried to say all the dumb stream of consciousness shit I say around my friends to my family or co-workers I'd just get stared at.

DeepIntoYouTube,few59ia,t1_fetdcd5,1579405593.0,"It is a joke. I've been watching this guy for years, I actually found him on this subreddit probably 5 or 6 years ago. Most of his videos are like this, he says something controversial in English and then slowly makes it clear that he's misinterpreting it. I find it funny that so many people think this is real, he has a video where he confuses Jesus with Santa clause for God's sake."
Cringetopia,fetr7hb,t1_fese0xo,1579378735.0,"I understand you're being sarcastic, but the biggest reason cannibalism is pretty much universally frowned upon is because eating human meat (or really any primate meat in general) makes it way, way more likely for you to catch diseases. As I understand it even most societies that ""practiced"" cannibalism would do it more so for ritualistic or religious purposes, so they weren't like, breeding human livestock and seasoning their flesh with only the best herbs and spices for the maximum flavor profile. But if you really want prion disease then I say go for it, I've heard people taste kind of like pork."
Cringetopia,fetpst6,t1_fet5sfl,1579378133.0,"Im not even anti-vegan, I think they make some pretty good points (I've tried going vegetarian before but decided against it for personal reasons). That being said, you have to wonder why more people don't find it at least a little suspect that Reddit is overwhelmingly an anti-vegan circlejerk until posts like this receive a couple thousand upvotes, and then all of the sudden 3/4ths of the comments are super pro vegan and anti meat."
forwardsfromgrandma,feppm5k,t1_fepdtz8,1579327099.0,"I don't think the message is supposed to be classist. There's only so much you can get across in one panel so sometimes you have to use visual shorthand. Its like how in real life, rich people aren't usually old fat guys with cigars carrying around big bags of money, but in a one panel comic you can articulate that pretty quickly by drawing a rich guy like that. The trailer and broken down cars are there to easily show that she isn't well off, which is basically necessary for the point of the comic to work. If anything this comic is pretty woke."

PublicFreakout,feg5nd6,t1_feg1s5n,1579078064.0,"Idk man, in my experience downtown cops can be the worst. My ""best"" (or I guess least bad) interactions with police have been in small to medium sized suburbs, where they aren't riled up from dealing with violent crime 24/7, but also aren't bored and looking for any reason to pull you over like a lot of rural cops. Granted I'm a pretty non-threatening looking bean pole of a white dude, so take my experience with a mountain of salt."

patientgamers,fdwq2ky,t1_fdwolze,1578761291.0,"I guess you're right, in a sense. It really depends on the game. The first 5 generations had a pretty decent level of difficulty. Not hard, but you'd at least occasionally lose if you hadn't faced a gym leader before and needed to rethink your strategy. If you face the elite 4 in heart gold right from the 8th gym, you'll be somewhat underleveled and it can be tough as nails. Ever since gen 6 that hasn't been as much the case. I just wish Pokemon would give people more options to not make the game as easy to steamroll."
patientgamers,fdwjn8h,t1_fdwc7eg,1578759425.0,"That's sort of where my critsisms with Pokemon lie. It's not the most advanced combat system in the world, but there's so much more depth that could be explored if they had some sort of harder difficulty options. Instead your options are either 1) mindlessly win every battle in the normal campaign, or 2) Go online and get your ass kicked by people using the same s-tier Pokemon they selectively bred or hacked in for perfect IVs. It sucks because even though it's simplistic I think it's a pretty fun battle system over all."
HistoryMemes,fdthnt3,t1_fdtf67h,1578716901.0,"Well yeah that's why I said ""technically"". Germany wasn't really unified until the late 19th century though, and even then Austria wasn't invited because Prussians are catty like that."

TrueOffMyChest,fdo1nwo,t1_fdnqgca,1578597247.0,"I mean, the American Revolution happened for lots of reasons. People try to paint a broad picture, but really even if you look at America's founding fathers they all had different ideologies and reasons for wanting to leave. Some were anti-monarchist, some didn't really care if there was a monarchy, some only really wanted out because they thought Britain's economic policies were holding them back. A lot of what America became was due to compromise. It took a while to figure out what the country would even function like."
AskReddit,fdlbnps,t1_fdktl7t,1578520583.0,"So are a higher number of English words than you would expect, the English language has just changed so much in the last millennia that most people wouldn't even realize it."

AskReddit,fdgmq4o,t1_fdgifij,1578402488.0,"Surf had a bit of a revival in the 90s with bands like The Mermen, Man or Astro-Man, and Satan's Pilgrims. I'd highly recommend people check some of that stuff out if they like Dick Dale type of stuff. One of the guys from Man or Astro-Man actually did the theme song for Jimmy Neutron."

pics,fddvgdi,t1_fdduf3c,1578324963.0,"People think of revolutions in real life like it's star wars or something. What really happens most of the time is less ""people stand together and defeat the oppressive government, ushering in a new age of freedom and prosperity"" and more ""the uprising splits into partisan factions that use escalating violence to advance their own agendas with civilians caught in the middle, destroying the countries economy and infrastructure. Whoever wins then becomes extremely sceptical about reactionaries starting another uprising and civil liberties are stripped away en-mass to make sure that doesn't happen"". Eventually things may go back to normal, if you're lucky."

Admittedly his question was a bit off topic, but I'm not sure it warrants the response you gave him."

AskReddit,fd3a0tr,t1_fd2rxs0,1578156212.0,"Honestly I haven't ever lived in NYC, I've only visited it a few times so take this with a grain of salt, but I've never really noticed New Yorkers as being significantly rude, just socially neutral. Sure, you get some asshole drivers that honk at people for mildly inconveniencing them, but at worst people would just be straight up and to the point about things. Sure, to someone from a place with lots of social niceties like the south this probably seems rude, but it's not like people are constantly telling you to fuck off or anything. People just seem more pragmatic about interaction there, and there's a part of me that honestly respects that."
pettyrevenge,fd2jtxa,t1_fcwz46e,1578148261.0,"Where I live it's the pickups that drive like assholes.

todayilearned,fd0204s,t1_fd0060f,1578112466.0,"I guess it's not completely a black and white thing. There's a line between not letting your kids call someone a ""shit eating motherfucker"" and getting pissed because your 13 year old used a word like ""crap"" that 90% of people wouldn't even consider taboo. The real fun of having super Christian parents is that there was basically no distinction between the two in my house."
todayilearned,fczsnsh,t1_fczo3tf,1578107943.0,"I can second this. My parents would get pissed if even said shit like ""sucks"" or ""stupid"". Now I have to try hard not to swear in certain situations because as it turns out, if you make half the English language taboo kids will wonder if there's even a reason some words are bad in the first place. Anecdotally, most people I know that have always been able to swear around their parents have much more open relationships with their parents in general. Who would have guessed that making kids walk on eggshells when they talk to you would make them less likely to want to."

Cringetopia,fcg9iiu,t1_fcfumcv,1577637815.0,"Some fan bases are just rabbid. Whenever I try to tell people that yes, I like The Beatles/Pink Floyd/Led Zepplin/Queen but none of them are particularly high on my list of favorite bands, people act like I just insulted their religion or something. I singled out those four bands because those are the ones, in my experience, where people seem personally insulted if they're not your favorite bands ever. I don't know if this is other people's experience, but I've never seen a Yes fan give someone an essay explaining why they were wrong to say ""Yeah I think yes is pretty decent. I listen to fragile sometimes"". Just to clarify, again, I like all of the band's I listed, in my experience they just have the most hostile fans."

Now imagine you walk in and the whole theater is just filled with men in animal costumes as far as the eye can see. Does that not seem like it would be a bit weird of a situation to you?
