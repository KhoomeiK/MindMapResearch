morbidquestions,ff785ed,t3_erx939,1579643003.0,"Bit of a vague question. Do you mean a pregnancy or birth? If a pregnancy is going on, not much would happen. Mother and baby ok. If you mean birth, then high risk of oxygen starvation to the baby (I believe Rosemary Kennedy was slightly brain damaged because Rose Kennedy was told to hold on and not give birth until a doc arrived) or the possibility of the baby not being born and dying inside the mother. There are examples of this happening, and the mothers body tries to reabsorb the dead baby, but cannot, so it calcifies the baby to prevent infection. Look up lithopedion or stone baby for more info on this. If the baby could not be born normally, then a caesarean is the only option. There are examples of self performed caesareans which is mind boggling."

Calling it a romance isn‚Äôt enough! Several authors have written sequels to it, but I‚Äôve always been disappointed by them. Margaret Mitchell left the book to end where it did for a reason- to keep us all thinking! Bit of a long shot, but if you ever get to find a film ‚Äòthe making of a legend: Gone with the Wind‚Äô watch it : it talks about the book and there‚Äôs a very small clip of Margaret mitchell in there.
