But brisket stall is a thing if all your temps were accurate that's what it is. Jacking the temps doesnt do anything but sear the outside and ruin your cook.

It takes a special occasion for me to cook brisket but I do it a day or two ahead of time (that extended rest makes the brisket so so so much better too) I don't wrap it in foil like that page says I just wait it out, but I have a wifi thermo probe so I never loose track of it.

smoking,fc2jk88,t3_eftxpf,1577363558.0,"Project smoke is a good book for a beginner. I've been smoking for years and I still go back to it for pointers. It's by Steven Raichlen.

Aside from seasoning it correctly there's really nothing hard about smoking. Even when you mess it up it's still good. Unless you burn it so bad you can use it as lump coal.

Seasoning process: 
Any oil or fat. Bacon grease, veggie oil, or even Pam spray. Coat the entire inside of the smoker (after you do a hot burn to burn all the factory crap off it) load it up with wood and let her rip for a few hours. Keep in mind it won't be fully seasoned until it smells like meat is on it before you put your meat candy on it. I've had neighbors come up and ask what I had cooking and then reply with ""oh Lord"" when I told them it was just preheating. Lol.

You can ask 100 different people and get 100 different answers when it comes to anything smoked. From seasoning to what kind of coal to what wood is best for what meat. It's all personal preference.

I will say experiment with cheaper cuts of meat. Let's take chicken for example. Buy a family pack of wings and experiment with a few of those first before you buy a whole chicken. Plus that helps to fully season a new smoker.

Now the quick and dirty on what woods for meats

Generally beef takes hardwoods better
Pork takes fruit woods better
Foul and birds take anything better. 

Now once you get comfortable jump on cold smoking. Now I'm assuming you have a cabinet smoker (looks like a file cabinet) if you trust yourself with a drill and hole saw bit you can drill a 4 inch hole at the bottom in the side and run some metal HVAC venting with an elbow and a piece about 2-3 foot long to a metal coffee can so you can cold smoke cheeses, peppers/veggies/whatever/the/list/is/endless.
