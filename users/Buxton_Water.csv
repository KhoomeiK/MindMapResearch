You can very much do that, hell you could even cough up a hunk of money and desalinate sea water instead. 

>How did you expect the water to return to its original basin

You don't. Or you treat the water and pump it back to its original location. Most places don't treat a lot of water and return it to the environment, most just consume and consume and consume. It's destructive but it's been happening forever now, eventually people will die off and things will balance a bit more."

>What I disagree with is that per capita pollution is a viable metric of comparison, especially between a first and third world country.

I disagree. At this stage of civilization at least the majority of those in third world countries (with the exception of the smallest and poorest nations) have similar luxuries as those in the first world (running water, phones, internet access, electricity, etc)"

Please read back on all of my comments, not once, have I ever said that running water is a bad thing, nor a luxury. Other countries consume a lot less than the US per capita even with a higher standard of living. 

Until you can understand that, I'm afraid your brain is an echo chamber and I can never speak to you properly."

>Who needs to drink Chinas massively polluted water anyway. We won't point out that those damn wasteful Americans don't even have a city in the top 500 of worst polluted cities in the world.

And there you go moving the goalposts, my inital statement was that the US massively overconsumes, and you're for some reason bringing up the worst polluted cities now? 

>Again, the point is that pollution per capita is a silly metric.

Except it is, because it indicats a much higher rate of consumption than other countries."
dataisbeautiful,fee77be,t1_fee4fr0,1579027819.0,"> Is access to running water a luxury? If everyone lived like cavemen our carbon footprint would be quite low. That is why ""per capita"" to someplace like China or India and a Western country is a dumb comparison. You can certainly use it to compare western countries, Germany and European countries are doing much better than the US. But to compare developing countries is hiding far different issues. UAE has outdoor air conditioning tents where they literally are cooling the outside air. They have an indoor ski slope... in the desert.

Are you serious? You accuse me of moving the goal posts and try and make out me saying that the US massively overconsumes every resource and you try and make it sound like I'm saying running water is a luxury."
