With my example of everyone showing up with massive 'I rolled naturally, I swear' stats, there was a lot of anxiety about the sort of combat the DM tended to throw at us, how much an encounter's survivability was telegraphed.  Even pacing, it wasn't unusual to encounter 4 sessions back to back with no character down time to catch one's breath or even gain their bearings information wise as to why they're being attacked or involved in #mysterious political intrigue#.  In that spot, their character stats are the only thing they do know and can talk about.

Wanting 2 stats being good is far from a MAD situation.  A paladin is making a choice, are they primarily a melee tank, or primarily a party face?  Trying to be both is saying you've made yourself unhappy because you set unrealistic expectations of wanting to always be a main pivot to any situation."

Aside from every paladin always taking a warlock dip to be a hex warrior on one-handed weapons, there are a lot of in game choices for the paladin.  One handed weapon because they want a shield to make up for their low Con?  Really want to be a polearm master, Str beating out Con, but someone in the part has you covered?
