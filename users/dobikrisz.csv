FifaCareers,ffcs0ke,t1_ffc9een,1579806065.0,"I dunno, WC is too easy for me but Legendary is not fun to play. I can still win on that level but the opponent just constantly presses no matter how strong they are or how important the match is. They push their full team on my half so if I can get behind them it's easy to score but it's nearly impossible to clear the ball on my half because no matter where I kick the ball, their player will be there and get it. So all my results are like 3-3 or 5-4 or something like that. And the goals just simply lose their satisfaction value because I know they will score anyway and then I will score then so on. I wish they'd just make the defending of the AI more effective and stop with the constant pushing."

If you want to do the first one then you can just go trough the events of the revolution and place your characters in them (what they did there, how they affected them etc.) You can even jump in time with relatively big leaps. If you want to do a character story then you have to find a conflict, how that conflict changed their life, how they reacted to that conflict, and eventually find a resolution (writers love to put love stories in these situations for some reason). And the revolution can be a catalyst of the conflict or it can just intensify it or it can be even the resolution. I think this is the first thing to clear before you start going deeper."
memes,fe9muy8,t1_fe9h4w5,1578939530.0,"It depends on the personal taste but The Joker is definitely the most thought provoking. It started a big argument in how movies can or can't ignite violence, how the media tried to do a crusade against it because it subtly highlighted its biggest flaws, etc. Nothing new under the sun but it made people talk about important stuff. And that's what every art's main goal. I think objectively the Joker deserves the Oscar the most. The Lighthouse and Marriage story were both really good but they were smaller films with only a few main motives. The Joker wanted to be a Character study and a critic of society at the same time and nailed it. And the Irishman is a classic Mafia story. Again, it was good but it didn't even tried to do anything new it's just a really well made movie. The Joker brought together the people who watch comic books movies and the people who watch more serious ones wonderfully (Ofc there is a big overlap between the 2 groups but I meant here those who only really cared about one or the other). I would say the other movie which deserve it really is the Parasite. I don't think I ever saw a movie which mesh together 2-3 genres so seamlessly.  It's a really unique movie which also (IMO) really good. And we should award uniqueness in a world which is controlled by sequels and remakes."
