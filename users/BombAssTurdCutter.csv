madlads,ff4xqul,t1_ff4vc96,1579574981.0,You’re right. I should have known some idiot basement dweller would step in with an “aCkCHuaLLy” statement. You fucking disgrace.
madlads,ff4vag3,t1_ff4bw51,1579573287.0,Are you that big of a cunt that you felt the need to correct everyone during a conversation about a man who died doing what he loved? Have some fucking respect.
madlads,ff31ms5,t1_ff2y685,1579531293.0,The way his toes are spreading tells me he was finishing as he was engulfed in magma. What a wild ride.
todayilearned,feynp5g,t1_feyelwz,1579448049.0,I feel like you and I are cut from the same cloth.
PublicFreakout,feqdm5v,t1_fep98ee,1579340515.0,Unfortunately they still closed captioned the kids useless commentary.
cringe,fekb626,t3_epln49,1579196386.0,God damn that’s good television.
pics,fei3kwj,t1_fei1qzh,1579129517.0,"So he says. Which is exactly what someone would say who is getting criticized for exploiting his wife. It’s crap, and you need some fucking perspective yourself. Calling the kettle black."
pics,fegknxo,t1_fegkh1p,1579095708.0,Well of course he would say that after everyone put him on blast for it. Maybe he should have respect for a dying woman instead of posting pictures of her on her death bed on the internet. You fucking morons are beyond clueless.
pics,feghk5j,t1_feggvz8,1579092977.0,"So you know him personally? Because maybe you are correct, or maybe I am correct. People like you however under some misconception that it’s some scheme to farm supportive comments lack intelligence, not everyone thinks the way you do, some people are just looking for stupid fucking internet points at the expense of a dying loved one who probably wanted privacy and peace. 

Go fuck yourself."

interestingasfuck,fe7ukxq,t1_fe7quxp,1578919439.0,"They are probably basing that statement off of the tacky looking wigs of the past, where it was obvious what was happening. You can see this guys scalp under this it looks 100% real."
nextfuckinglevel,fdqevx2,t3_emps04,1578664873.0,I’d be the guy that doesn’t get his hand out in time while setting it down and ends up flailing around with his pinky trapped under a barn.
Cringetopia,fdk4dgg,t1_fdk43sp,1578495762.0,Can you edit it again and include the username please.
betterCallSaul,fdf4ev3,t1_fde8x5l,1578353056.0,"I felt like that too, but then I thought maybe he did it for the absurdity factor. Like both cops would never think someone could make that up, and thus would not give the situation a second thought after that moment, whereas if he doesn’t offer any additional information, they may feel the need to keep an eye on him in the future. IDK? that’s all I could come up with when I was watching."
MovieDetails,fdf0eq5,t1_fdemwgx,1578350492.0,"When I saw it what hit me was that it was a piece of the actual ship that I had been so fascinated by all my life, and that it was seeing the light of day for the first time in almost 100 years."

blackstonegriddle,fdawevh,t1_fd7pm8r,1578251135.0,One of the only times I have ever bit the bullet and gone there was to get my blackstone. Felt like a dirty bitch after since I work in a very unionized field.
todayilearned,fd603nj,t1_fd1er5s,1578183687.0,I’d love to hear you describe the recent events in Iran from your very unbiased point of view.

morbidquestions,fcn2eqt,t1_fcmv70s,1577801353.0,I was making a shitty joke about the book “The Giving Tree” about a tree that was unselfish and wanted to just provide a place to play and shade for a boy it loved. I actually think OPs idea is a really cool way to be buried and much better than having a tombstone.

angelsbaseball,fc6gh1w,t1_fc6cr0e,1577480006.0,I remember him hitting over .300 one year and (I think) going to the ASG?
answers,fc6g7ye,t1_fc6f0na,1577479834.0,"I agree with you that tipping as a whole is not a great system. It’s a shitty system, but it needs to be changed from the top down. If you shit on the servers, you are trying to change it from the bottom up, which is like pissing up a rope."
answers,fc6e4hv,t1_fc60pkq,1577478417.0,"You talk about “greedy assholes” and your entire table is full of cheap shit tipping. “Complain to management” yeah ok, Karen. Unreal."
answers,fc6dpre,t1_fc5tj65,1577478144.0,As a former bartender almost all of your tipping “guidelines” are way too high. Whom you tip should be based on who is taxed on tips they receive. This means their minimum wage is taxed heavily based on the notion they receive regular tips. Full service restaurant workers are. Counter service restaurant workers are not. And no servers are expecting a 25% tip on a bill over $100 “even if the service is lacking”. Get real.
OldSchoolCool,fc5tnv9,t1_fc5s40t,1577465632.0,"Not that I condone worrying about meaningless internet points, but how exactly was he “wrong”? Condescending yes, but it is not a word."
OldSchoolCool,fc5tfwv,t1_fc5tbfv,1577465489.0,Because that sounds SO cool doesn’t it? Couldn’t have been said in jest.
OldSchoolCool,fc5r53f,t1_fc5pe5v,1577464112.0,Not all words are made up with the sole intention of trying to sound cool.
OldSchoolCool,fc5r1nh,t1_fc5ph66,1577464061.0,"I love how many of these tools are offended by this conversation. “Fuck you Im funny and witty!”

Other stupid reddit words these infantile morons think make them sound cool:

murder mittens,
snek, 
diddle (when describing pedophiles), 
trash panda, 
sauce.  

What absolute fucking retards. Cue the “wOw AngEr pRoBlem muCh??!1!” comments."
OldSchoolCool,fc5pa5u,t1_fc5ozah,1577463087.0,I’d like to add “douchecanoe” to this very excellent point you made.

angelsbaseball,fblqhsr,t1_fbl7b4e,1576967668.0,Exactly. What hot garbage. If I were a subscriber I’d drop them now. Glad I’ve never given them one red cent.
