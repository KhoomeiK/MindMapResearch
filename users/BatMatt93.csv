xboxone,ffb850r,t1_ffatfi2,1579754615.0,What happened at the start of this gen will happen next gen. 360 had games made for a couple years after Xbox One came out and then people pretty much stopped developing for it.
television,ffb3xhh,t1_ffakeg6,1579751154.0,"I thought a year or so had past after season 2 in the story, which if it did makes it semi more plausible for the actor."
Competitiveoverwatch,ffb1d9q,t3_eskuit,1579749364.0,Anyone who plays R6S ranked knows he is right about a hero ban meta happening if hero bans do happen. In Siege the first 3 ops banned are usually the same with some minor flexibility on the 4th one.
xboxone,ffadx3u,t3_esja97,1579733304.0,"Thats a weird bug. Have exclusively used dark mode and never had this problem, hopefully Amazon fixes it quickly."
technology,ff9hk58,t1_ff9eot2,1579713161.0,"If he does win, hopefully that will mean enough people will vote Cruz out of office in my state when his term is over."

politics,ff6xp2e,t1_ff68vpr,1579637030.0,As someone who lives in one of those states (texas) it does not work well.
xboxone,ff6j9hg,t1_ff5kntu,1579628387.0,"Huh. So would that explain why when PS introduced name change, only some games will recognize your new name?"
xboxone,ff5bni0,t1_ff571f7,1579586374.0,"Oh no, I know that takes more work and wont be common place till year 2 of series x."
xboxone,ff4y8ao,t1_ff4xsu1,1579575319.0,"Cuz they know what the specs are within 3 months of release. I'm not asking for a whole rework of the game, just for stuff like 60fps in Cyberpunk and further render distance."
xboxone,ff4sgqf,t1_ff4r44w,1579571354.0,"Cuz Xbox One X already has done it. When that console and PS4 Pro came out, bunch of devs released free updates to take advantage of the new system. There's no reason they cant do that with games releasing within a 3 month window of the new consoles releasing."
xboxone,ff4k52r,t1_ff3ji3k,1579565559.0,"That's a bit different cuz those remasters came out years after the originals were released. Cyberpunk launches two months before the new consoles do and it would look pretty bad on their part if they ""released"" the game again on the new consoles instead of just offering a free update you download."
politics,ff00czb,t1_fezs42i,1579463793.0,"He did that during his POTUS run, not Senator run."
politics,fezgbrc,t1_fezarok,1579457042.0,Same. Still stings how close Beto was to taking Cruz seat.

xboxone,fenypn8,t1_fenwrpa,1579292731.0,"They will just piss off their fanbase if they do that  because with the release of Xbox One X and PS4 Pro, devs have shown they can just push an update to their games to use the power of the new console. If  CDPR doesn't do that, they will piss off a lot of people."
xboxone,fenwa35,t1_fent0lm,1579291773.0,"Maybe if it released in April, but when you are releasing only two months before the next gen consoles launch then people are going to be expecting a next gen patch for their new console."
houston,fencomp,t1_fena5ec,1579281859.0,Because most parents till recently havent paid attention to who's on the board and how it runs.

houston,felbees,t1_fej3jwn,1579218226.0,"Pretty much. I don't think anyone was worried about Iran having a full out war with the US. People were more worried about skirmishes with them that would cost us American lives, not a lot but it would have  been some."
houston,felb7ju,t1_feitxj9,1579218099.0,"You know, just because you don't agree with someones policies doesn't make them a leech. I may not like everything that President Trump has done in office or how he has conducted himself (twitter rants) but I wouldn't call him a leech or say he doesn't do anything good. Don't hate a govt official just because they have a D next to their name."
xboxone,fekyaqa,t1_fekwhvd,1579210115.0,"Same, it all depends on what Sony does. If they launch PS5 at $400, MS will have to or they will be fucked at the start of the gen again."
movies,fekse6d,t1_fehhoj1,1579206619.0,"I don't think anyone thought TLJ would make as much as TFA. We all knew that film made that much because of the hype machine and the whole ""first Star Wars movie in a decade"" mindset. That plus it not being garbage (just recyled a bit) was more then enough for that movie to have the legs it did in the box office."
movies,feks73a,t1_fehr62m,1579206505.0,"I wish I was more aware of that stuff back then, but I was only 6 at the time when Ep 1 came out. The next best thing I got is TFA, may not have been as big, but was still fun being part of that hype machine."
xboxone,fekr4dx,t1_feke9n5,1579205877.0,"$600 would be suicide for them, Sony already showed people don't want to pay that much. $500 they could do if Sony did $500, but I have a feeling both consoles are gonna launch at $400."
xboxone,fekr0z2,t1_fejwqny,1579205822.0,"I would do the upgrade if you are on a One S, the difference between games on X and S is already pretty significant. I can imagine the difference being even more when Series X launches. Watch Digital Foundrys video on Modern Warfare for S and X and you can see how different those two are not just in the graphics category."
xboxone,fekqtb2,t1_fekfvgx,1579205698.0,"Pretty much everything will come out for Xbox One and One X for the first year because that install base is just too much money to miss out on. Now when the 2nd year starts, then we'll start to see less come out for the bottom of the barrel that is Xbox One."
xboxone,fekqojz,t3_epic7j,1579205619.0,"If they make a Halo Infinite Special Edition Console, then instant buy at launch for me."
xboxone,fekqbqz,t1_fekf0uv,1579205409.0,"Depends on the tier you are in. If you are in the first early alpha stage, then they probably would change things if everyone at that stage voiced concerns. When you get to my stage in the insider program, its mainly stress testing and bug fixing."
xboxone,fekbnh3,t3_epmi8n,1579196671.0,"It sucks, it really does, but you only get one chance to release a game right so they should take all the time they need. Looks like Cyberpunk is gonna be this generations GTA V, last big giant game to end the generation on with next gen two months away."
roosterteeth,fek0lqu,t1_fek0gdv,1579190047.0,Ya that's why we never saw Tex again in RvB after S10.
roosterteeth,fek05re,t1_fejzw7g,1579189771.0,Well Kathleen dissapeared like Joel 'cuz she ruffled too many feathers.
roosterteeth,fejzbfm,t1_fejykfb,1579189250.0,Lol it's funny how few people recognize Jason. Back in the day everyone knew his name like we all know Gus and Burnie..he used to be in a some RT shorts and was in RT comics all the time too. I believe he left after the first few years to focus on music.
Brawlstars,fean37a,t1_feag64e,1578950454.0,I'm not excusing their shitty servers. I was just explaining to the dude why they dont refund you a loss when you experience lag in the game.
Brawlstars,fe90opw,t1_fe90626,1578932904.0,"Look you arent listening, so I'm just gonna end this now. Good luck on all your future games."
Brawlstars,fe8ywy7,t1_fe8twz7,1578932428.0,"Like I said, its genuinely difficult for Supercell to tell if it's because of lag on their end or someone with a shitty mobile or wifi connection. It's not gonna happen, it's just a part of the game."
Brawlstars,fe8t46t,t1_fe6v1or,1578930508.0,So they can win. People DDOS other people all the time to win games.
Brawlstars,fe6uz4z,t3_eo03dx,1578905715.0,"It will never happen. There's a reason why every other big competitive game (Overwatch, R6S etc.) doesnt have a system like this. It's because it's difficult to differentiate between normal lag and player abused lag."

PS4,fe4ksky,t1_fe0c603,1578860370.0,"> I read right, Microsoft said that they’ll support the original Xbox One for at least another year or two. That means that all upcoming games will be somewhat hamstrung because they still need to run on the Xbox One

I mean thats no different then how this gen did it. Xbox One and PS4 launched and games were still being made for them and the 360/PS3 all the way to the end of 2014. It wasn't till in 2015 did we start to see a large amount of game only come out on current gen hardware and not last gen also."
PS4,fe4k145,t3_enes8o,1578860169.0,"In other news, water is wet. I dont think anybody was thinking there wouldnt be."
xboxone,fe4iq98,t1_fe3z5jk,1578859762.0,It's to stop this stuff from flooding the front page every day.
ClashRoyale,fe3o5jh,t1_fe09ww7,1578851233.0,Agreed. People almost always say a new card is OP unless its extremely weak from the get go.
DeathStranding,fdxtdlv,t1_fdx4l62,1578772716.0,Wait till you build to the mountain. That's a grind.
tf2,fdxqxzp,t1_fdxn5nd,1578772022.0,"They are annoyed, but that's not the same as salty. I've seen way too many posts that fall into the salty category on reddit. That one though is just a dude that's annoyed which everyone is with a game at some point."
DeathStranding,fdx6f8j,t1_fdwy4of,1578765779.0,Ya but that's all you get. Two or three will be done for you and the rest you gotta finish.

He has already said Suicide Squad comes first and that he had a script done for Guardians 3 before he got canned initially. Considering Guardians 3 isn't coming out for at least 3+ years, he is probably not being strained working on those two projects."
xboxone,fdntygr,t1_fdl3lnj,1578592778.0,"Unless it has gotten larger, the game shouldn't be too big. Under 25gb IIRC."
DestinyTheGame,fdni2ah,t1_fdnbzhe,1578586251.0,"I thought the same too thinking ""I'll have this done in a couple games"" then actually looked at the bounty after I did two games and realized how mistaken I was. Fuck that bounty."
NintendoSwitch,fdn999h,t1_fdn20n0,1578580670.0,That still doesnt solve the Facebook problem since FB owns Instagram.
Seaofthieves,fdm7nzu,t1_fdm66yv,1578541818.0,"I do, it's just tough to figure out how many people actually want it because so much stuff turns into a circlejerk in game communities to where people say they want the feature when in reality most dont care."
Seaofthieves,fdm282v,t1_fdkuxlo,1578538064.0,I doubt missing cross play opt out was a big reason people left the game.
Seaofthieves,fdm21mu,t1_fdkk6ss,1578537940.0,It's a good change. 70% of the time those weekly updates are fluff 'cuz there's only so much you do with weekly updates. Bi-weekly and monthly are the best routes to go.
PS4,fdlmv34,t1_fdljua9,1578527616.0,"That's part of why I didnt like it, I played on hard the whole game and it still felt easy. Also with big weapons not being a part of 98% of the game before that, having a quad rocket launcher just felt out of place."
PS4,fdl3ad2,t1_fdl2d0j,1578516325.0,Ya which is why it never bothered me too much. It does make free roam pretty easy though lol.

xboxone,fdkzlmh,t1_fdkzb4t,1578514406.0,"Ya its just a tad too much on the latency, even for singleplayer games."
xboxone,fdkyqh8,t1_fdkkq5w,1578513915.0,Still baffles me to this day that they never made it low latency. They should have known people would have wanted to plug another console into it.
movies,fdfen3x,t1_fdf3e4w,1578359903.0,Pretty much. Then 3 thousand people realized they could make a channel just doing reactions and look where we are today.
technology,fdbwjdt,t1_fd9s8la,1578262944.0,I blame the programs themselves. For some reason some companies only like to design their stuff to work with only one internet browser.

Edit: Glad the mods deleted that garbage comment."
todayilearned,fdaw2c1,t1_fdapf79,1578251000.0,"No I wont let it lie now cuz you keep insulting like you're the superior one. Both parties have lost in a conversation when they have resorted to insults, so at this point this chain is fair game.

 I called you out on your passive aggressive comment cuz the dudes comment answered your question and you decided to be a dick and just say ""and"" like a 12 yo kid.

 I read the entire chain, I understood what was going on hence why I responded to your childlike comment in the first place. If you want an internet keyboard warrior fight then fine, we can do this all day till the thread gets locked."
