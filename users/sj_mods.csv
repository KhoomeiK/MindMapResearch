Today you can buy watercooling that fits right in your case, and it's very easy to put on :)

watercooling,fcs4euh,t1_fcs2qvk,1577911313.0,"It will :)  

I tend to say ""120mm rad per item that needs cooling"" 
Or a 120mm rad for a cpu, 120mm rad for gfx etc.. you get the point!

But more/bigger rads is better/safer and more stable so to speak :)  

I don't think you should worry too much  :p"
watercooling,fcs0x84,t1_fcrzr9o,1577909688.0,"Thanks!

One is 40mm and the thicker one is 65mm I think :)

The reason for pp config on the bottom rad is to fill out the space a little more, just to make the build a bit more massive so to speak.

I don't really need 2nd rad, but y'know,  more is more in this case :p"

watercooling,fcra5m3,t1_fcr5eqh,1577899000.0,"Thanks!

Just a good advice,  when you are masking,  use a new exatoblade, makes your life so much easier!

Also, thin coats and do not stress, gets the best possible results!

At least  something I wish I knew :p"

watercooling,fcp8xct,t1_fcp8g82,1577854467.0,"Basically went into the ""open class "" where you just turn up, and there are some judges (professional builders) that take a good look and then the day after that, if you get lucky enough to be in top 3, you'll get up on the main stage and they tell who's won. Well, that's roughly what happens anyway haha

I have not fixed the bend yet, but I did win the competition for the 2nd time in a row, along winning prizes for both best cable management and build quality  :)

Pretty proud of that to be honest!"
watercooling,fcp8amb,t1_fcp7dvd,1577853828.0,"I now have the extra fitting that I needed to fix that problem,  but I ran out of time before I had to compete in Dreamhack winter casemod championship.  And I just haven't gotten around to fix the problem yet :) 

Can you imagine the bend is off by only 1 cm?  Yeah, that's the downside of doing parallel tubing.

It simply gave to be spot on!"
