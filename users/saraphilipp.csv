NoStupidQuestions,fcwpphv,t3_eixrys,1578032853.0,"Tipping isn't required unless you have a large party at a restaurant, it is known before the bill comes. If you ever relied on tips to make ends meet it might make more sense. Employees expect a tip when their employers pay below or near minimum wage for certain services. Businesses reinforce this model as normal. It's a gamble when you work for tips. Might make 20 might make 200 a day. It averages out to an almost livable wage for a single person with no dependents."
