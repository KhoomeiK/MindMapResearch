college,ffac4vu,t1_ffaamv4,1579732051.0,Funnily enough I'm an out of state student too. Turns out the vice president lived 20 minutes away from me for about 5 years when he was in the Navy. Now he's my brother. World is pretty small when you have good friends.
college,ffabuhz,t1_ffa4drs,1579731865.0,Exactly. I've made so many friends in and out of Greek life because of my frat. And I don't do drugs or drink. My frat has a very strong rule. No pressure. If you don't want to do something. You don't have to.
college,ffa1e7f,t1_ff9mlfa,1579725932.0,"I agree with everything u/barefootpine said. I'm a huge nerd. Star trek, robotics, law, but I joined a fraternity. The thing is, not every fraternity is the same. Mine is based on philanthropy and nerdy things. We play video games and such. I suggest going to a Greek crawl some time. It's usually a once a year thing. But it will let you take a look at the fraternities and scope out what they're like. You might find you enjoy it."

dontdeadopeninside,ff3u7ln,t1_ff3u1pi,1579548949.0,This sub has been putting tons of this on my feed. And I don't know why. It's not the right sub
AskMen,fezdj6g,t3_eqvtup,1579456209.0,As a man who is in a fraternity. I know nothing my brothers say is meant to be malicious. They know there's lines you don't cross. Trust me. If a line is crossed you will know. Because the difference between friends you just made and a brother. Is that one is a stranger. The other is family.

FreezingFuckingCold,few5ffq,t1_fetmuby,1579405671.0,For those that don't use metric. -25C is -13F. And -3C is 26.6F
AskMen,few4n5r,t3_eqkxjf,1579405297.0,Another question. Shower curtain open or closed when not in use?
AskMen,few4d8j,t1_fevgcri,1579405198.0,On the opposite end. Your house can be on fire for longer without you realising it. Then when you run to leave your door handles will be incredibly hot.
unpopularopinion,few3wsa,t1_fevaviw,1579404992.0,"Don't know why you're getting downvoted. It is littering to throw trash on the ground.

Advice,feq56j2,t3_eq1won,1579337759.0,I'm gonna point out that the corrections system works for some people. If he is readjusted into society and living a normal life. He's probably put it behind him. And I think that it's unfair to judge people harshly for something they did their time for and got rehabilitated from. Sounds like he's a good friend that made a BIG lapse in judgement.

college,fei4akw,t3_ep1or8,1579129967.0,My college meal plan only allows me one meal a day. I haven't eaten today because of that. As well the food isn't healthy. So in my situation no. I have 45 minutes until the cafeteria opens. And then I will eat some food that's been frozen for a month and thawed out.

HumansBeingBros,fectdzv,t3_eodyt2,1578983875.0,Moved 800 miles away to a place where I knew nobody. Was shocked how many people wished me happy birthday and made my night special. Now they're my brothers. Literally. I'm now in the fraternity they are in. Love my brothers

FreezingFuckingCold,fea3ha0,t1_fe9at3w,1578943950.0,Where I am there are signs everywhere to just call 911. That way a state trooper can make sure you're safe while you're on the side of the highway. Much less dangerous on the side when there's a cop flashing their ambers.
FreezingFuckingCold,fea3167,t3_eo4f0t,1578943837.0,That's a really interesting thing to see today.
