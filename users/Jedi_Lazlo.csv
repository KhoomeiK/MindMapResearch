gaming,ffay4ux,t1_ffavakv,1579747194.0,"I agree. I would rather pay for a *finished*, tested product that aims at an immersive experience. I want strategy based on tactics, reason, and skills- not how deep my wallet goes. I want a game with high replay value *without* having to pay for more content that was obviously withheld from the launch. Only then is there *value* in spending more money for additional DLC- because it feels worth it. I've been gaming long enough that these ideals were once the norm, and watched as the industry tried to reprogram consumers of a different pricing structure within the industry.

 Gamer standards are getting higher and higher. There are fewer really great games each year, and most of these are still made or funded by the biggest studios. Even the big guys are under enormous pressure to meet release dates and performance quality for industry demand. Indy breakouts do exist, but every successful indy studio for the last 20 years is now owned by one of the big guys. They get swallowed up the second they're profitable, so there really is no lasting ""support your local developer"" cause you can really get behind. 

So as a consumer, there's no reason I should settle for an unfinished product, partial release, or pay more to play more pricing. I can be selfish and particular- with the same reasonable expectations for quality entertainment that I might have paying for a movie or concert."

Some states have Romeo and Juliet laws that will apply even after one of the couple turns 18 if they are still together. The law isn't on his side here.

His only angle is kidnapping or restraining /imprisonment of a minor. For these reasons I would avoid driving the boyfriend places or picking him up at all until he's 18, just to save everyone the drama.

We really need some context here to help, otherwise it just sounds like ESH because when it became difficult to communicate you both took turns acting adolescent and petty. It's one thing to be inadvertently hurt, and need to work through that. It's entirely different to try to point out you were hurt by causing the same injury to the other for a ""how does it feel"" moment. If you are invested in the relationship be invested and talk things through. Don't act patient. Be patient. Don't act tolerant and understanding and empathizing. Be tolerant and understanding and allow yourself to have real empathy. If you can't be honest with each other and the process, you should reconsider being in the relationship. There are plenty of couples who love and support each other, yet completely disagree on politics. It's not a deal breaker. There are worse things to be than the opposite political party."

MBS is a thug, for sure, but he hides behind an impenetrable veil of international legitimacy- at least for now. 

You are describing an act of war, one of unprovoked aggression. One that can only be interpreted as invasive and imperialistic. Such a country would be condemned as a rogue nation and abandoned or fought by all others, especially in the region. The U.S. has over 100 military bases overseas, some manned with as little as a few hundred personnel. Many of our bases are in the region, within cruise missile danger zone. These would all be in immediate danger. Force depletion would not be good. Escalation would be unavoidable."
