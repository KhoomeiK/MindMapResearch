They take troops away from the Idlib fronts so they can go fight the SDF on the Turkish border. They force refugees to go back and live in these areas, which are poorly run and have bad security, there is constant clashes between turkish backed groups and many of these militants act as bandits, kidnapping, robbing and killing the populace.
