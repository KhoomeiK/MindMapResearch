DeadBedrooms,fbwvzat,t3_eegq0l,1577160921.0,"I'm not caught up so forgive me if you've answered this but how much do you actually try to date her? Take her out make her feel special again. Do things for her with no strings attached? The honeymoon phase always ends but doesn't mean to stop dating each other, wooing her and making her stay feeling special. 

I've learned that the hard way and don't want to see more young couples face the same easily fixed issues.

Conversation is good to start but needs action on your part and eventually hers as she will respond to your energy."
