So op is either lying, misunderstood the weight criteria or he bought a really crappy or specialised bike.
I'd love to see the actual specs."
backpacks,ffa7tr1,t1_ff85r96,1579729568.0,"I'm afraid I didn't.
I missed the sale and then I realized the bag I already have fits my purposes and it would be wasteful to buy another. Still a bit tempted. The waxed canvas doesn't concern me (I like the concept) but when thinking about it I would like more organization and a separate laptop compartment for a daily bag.

But I goes it's impossible to say what you feel about the waxed canvas unless you see it in person (which I haven't)."

Really is no wonder why the great white stand no chance."
fatlogic,ff453f5,t1_ff2grgq,1579555728.0,"Funny, I would find that life would be weird and inefficient spending so much time walking. 
I bike pretty much everywhere which with the traffic around here means I can get most places almost as fast as a car and I can get a decent heart rate up. If I would walk to work I'd spend and hour each trip walking.
Walking being inefficient exercise was mainly the reason why I started to run as well."
fatlogic,fen1wu3,t3_eq0je2,1579275139.0,TIL that the average American woman is shorter than me yet heavier than me.
ImaginaryLandscapes,fee1i2j,t3_eokagq,1579024439.0,I really hope this guy moves to Sweden.
todayilearned,fdywva3,t3_enaymq,1578784338.0,TIL that - 40 Celsius is the same as - 40 Fahrenheit.
fatlogic,fdyv9ry,t3_endjcj,1578783980.0,Dedicating all your life talking about how hard/amazing it is being fat and how bad diet culture is surely is much better.
fatlogic,fdegg5f,t1_fde222w,1578338486.0,It looks particularly weird because he's still wearing the same oversized style of clothes as he wore as a fat guy.
AmItheAsshole,fd2vg0g,t1_fd2jgpz,1578152007.0,"She doesnt seem entitled at all. She didn't know what a fritata was and the op said he was making multiple anyway so it not unreasonable for her to assume it be easy to make a plain one (fritatas aren't necessarily big as the op made them either).

When he explained that wasn't possible she just asked if he could make something simple. He still refused.

If you're not willing to make food for kids then don't invite kids.

Would you invite a jew or Muslim for dinner and only serve pork?"
Fitness,fd1pw1i,t1_fd16q7d,1578134951.0,"> Theres a gif going around about segways new electric chair. People are claiming that we're *heading* in the direction of Wall-e. We are living it now.

Reading the header that struck me as well.

How far have we gone if people actually think a ""not too big walk"" before their first gym session might break their body?

Unless the person is disabled and having a walk is the equivalent of climbing a mountain, how little does this person walk in their everyday life to think a walk might break their body?

I get it if they were thinking of having their first run and going to the gym after (which many of us do, run to gym and back) but a walk?

But OP is taking the first step which is great and I wish him the best of luck."
flashlight,fcmi4ta,t1_fclqwnl,1577776193.0,"Haha looking forward to your reviews of the lights.

Looking at the data again from the zero light review I think the FW1A will have better throw, since the measured lux it had was with a lower lumen number than the TH10. So when with lower output, it has better throw."
flashlight,fcmi09d,t1_fcku18x,1577776044.0,That's interesting. I'll have to check that one out. Although I do have a thing for for right angle lights as well since my first zebra light.
flashlight,fck7jew,t3_ehdkqu,1577718764.0,"Beauts. 
What Victorinox is that?"
flashlight,fch53c4,t1_fcflq7n,1577647398.0,"Beautiful light. 
I'm assuming it's not designed to be throwy but I'm curious how throwy it is?"
flashlight,fbu1owv,t3_eeg97y,1577105484.0,What the? Here I'm waiting for them to get back stock in the normal FW1A model and they release another version I'm not interested in instead?
