The thing is: We have a chance to uplift and give hope to this younger generation. No, this is not a ribbon for 17th place. Having said that, I never had that in my experience in this world we're all invoved in at this time. I did as what was expected of me. Period. Now, I read about the depression and the guilt and the sadness of so many of our future leaders whenever I'm on Reddit. I choose to empower this next generation. Previous generations (in the West) believed in a good life where they could live without restraints other than what Mother Nature brought them. Tough times living off the land, indeed, but it had real purpose and sincere thankfulness. After that, ""we"" had our factory jobs and what not with the promise of ""security"". A lead into lovely fantasies of happily ever after. Factories owners achieved that in spades. Fair enough. We fell for it. Then the greed really started and is rampant. Bare minimum wage that people can't live on. No ""benefits"" for keeping their companies running. Sick? An extra fuck you - make me my money, android. Others around the world have a whole other story but I'll leave that right there - for now. We have not been successful at expelling the Corporations and their cohorts, the ""puppet masters"" that run this show. The ""divide and conquer"" ideology is alive and well and obvious in this stream of comments, save a few. Promote your brothers and sisters potential, or don't.

Now, we have to pay all of them. We refuse because 1) We don't any money left 2) WTF?
