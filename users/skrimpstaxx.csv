opiates,ffedveh,t1_ffe1741,1579844387.0,"Oh, he doesn't care one bit. He chose the user name ""Doctor Sub"" like he has his PHD in pissing in cups so that other redditors just as dumb and narcissistic as him follow along and believe him just by his word. When you argue against truth and logic because your little man ego won't let you admit when you're wrong , that's when you can tell who someone is on this site.

Spreading false information can get people hurt, or even cause people to lose their life. I am all for intelligent debates, but as soon as someone is proven wrong and cant admit that they were wrong, my respect for them immediately disappears. I am not a genius, far from it in fact, but I am very good at staying open minded, and being humble when I am wrong and someone informs me of errors. A shit load of people that walk this planet cant swallow their pride and admit that they made a mistake. Instead, they resprt to name calling and other childish tactics. If you and I are debating, lets say skateboarding, I have no issues admitting that I was wrong, and you were correct (Side note: Skateboarding was just an example, although I have been Skating for 18 years and do actually know more about it than 99% of other people lol), but even when I get something wrong, I happily correct myself. Those people that cant admit when they are wrong will never change, and IF they do, and I capitalized ""if"" for a reason, I am willing to bet a very small percentage of that 1% continue to be humble when their errors are pointed out.

I would suggest maybe trying to find a suboxone strip or 2 to taper yourself off, I'm on subs currently. I have been since mid September, but if I werent physically dependant on opiates for 12 years prior I wouldnt have ever gotten on subs. They gave me quality of life back, but I also withdrawal from them if I run out.

If you want to break the cycle of withdrawal youre just gonna have to stop. Clinidine helps, benzos help for sleep, weed helps. Loperamide helps with the Hershey squirts. I highly recomment clonidine. Its a blood pressure med that regulates body temp so cold sweats will disappear and its known to help relieve opiate withdrawal anxiety. Its not a narcotic so most docs can prescribe it, just be honest and tell them youre trying to kick a pill habit and you heard clonidine wirks wonders as a comfort med.

Crank the heat and get it to 98-100°, when you pull up and park at the doctors office, put the bottle up against your gooch/taint and it will stay warm. You dont even need hand warmers.

FiftyFifty,ffakh7v,t1_ff88exk,1579737986.0,"My (28m) ex-gf (43f) argues that it isn't an illness, nor a disease. She say's that addiction is a choice. I argued that it is a choice up until physical dependancy set's in, and without it, withdrawals start to occur. She argued that is never stop's being a choice; you can CHOOSE to keep using, and fix the withdrawal's, or you can CHOOSE to say, ""Enough is enough"", and suffer through the detox. She and I started dating about 28 no ths ago. She has left me 3 time's due to my substance dependancy issues and me lying about using, making up a bullshit excuse as to why I am 3 hours late, and she is not an idiot, she can immediately tell when I was lying, EVERY. SINGKELE. TIME. She knows me better than anyone else in my life ever has, or likely ever will. I am extremely introverted so I honestly don't have many friends, but I do have a twin brother who I have been best friends with our entire lives ( He and I are as close as siblings can get, and we have a very healthy relationship), but my Ex-GF knows me even better than my twin brother, both inside and out. I am a very lucky man to have had her stick by my side for as long as she did, and I will be honest, I'm a very nice person, and absolutely do not cheat in any relationship (no excuses for me), but lying has always been an issue I have had, because I am ashamed of my actions and the fact that I let myself develope a MASSIVE street fentanyl habit, I didn't want anyone knowing more about it than they already did. She stayed with me through clean time, and eventually, relapsing, multiple times. She could have left me, shit, she SHOULD have left me, but she didn't. She then explained to me about her biological mother. Growing up, my Ex girlfriends mom had major alcoholism problems. Like, ruin a persons life over and over again type problems. Constantly in and out of my Ex girlfriends life through child-hood, adolescence, teenage years, early twenties, etc... Until her mother's eventual death, due to? You guess it: Alcohol. I don't remember exactly what happened to cause her mothers death (I think organ failure but I could be wrong), but I do remember that her death was caused as a direct result of having a life long alcohol problem. 

So, she has never personally dealt with addiction (other than her quitting smoking cigarettes, but qyitting cigarettes is NOTHING like heroin/fentanyl detox OR alcohol detox, which can be deadly, and cause death easily for some). So she has a very strong sense of disdain for psychoactive substances that can lead to dependancy issues, life long or not. She doesn't care about pot, because its natural. In fact, I really liked that about her, that I can catch a buzz on pot and she not get upset. She says its natural and she knows it doesnt usually ruin someones life like heroin or alcohol. She left me for the last time after finding out about my last relapse, August 5, 2019. It broke my heart, I really actually loved this woman, and honestly, I still kinda do. Her and my relationship had such a high intensity to it at times, and other times we were so lackadaisical around each other. We had amazing conversations too. But most of all, I miss cuddling her, and holding her in ny arms as we veg on her couch watching movies/tv shows for hours. She asks me to come over a couple times a month, so we can have sex, but she wants to keep sex and feelings separate. It's difficult for me because I still love her, but the sex we have is so amaxing to her and I that she doesn't want to lose it. I remain exclusive to her out of respect for her, I just hope she has been doing the same for me. If not then I'm gonna have to tell her goodbye for good. I wish her and I could just date again, she say's relationships take a ton of effort, but honestly, I'm about as low maintenence as a guy can get. I don't need all of her time, Just let me take you to dinner at least once a week, and be willing to rub my back and cuddle watching movies a night or two. Is that too much to ask?

China has realized that to control the global population you have to control social media and what people see. So for the last year they have been pouring a ton of money into getting their social media app to be accepted and widely used- through a campaign of paid content creation/submission, vote manipulation. Once they have widescale buy in, their backdoor monitoring and data collection will have free reign. I find it a worrying trend how easily Reddit is blindly up-voting these gifs and supporting a company with such privacy concerns, an obvious agenda, and that is censoring and controlling the information you see.

SuicideWatch,fewk0kd,t3_eqrzz3,1579412270.0,"I was on fentanyl for 3 years, that white chinese street fetanyl, the good strong stuff. With no tolerance you could do mabe 1/32 of a 00 capsule and fall asleep and never wake up. I have overdosed twice, having to be narcanned both times. Dependency sucks, withdrawals suck, that was the worst part about addiction. 

When I die thats how I hope I go, its so peaceful.

I'm sorry you are struggling right now, OP. I was going to the projects of baltimore to grab it when I was using.

I was gonna make a ""sure, I can get you some, but i need your money first"" joke, since the #1 rule in junkie world is never let your money walk out of sight, but I figured that'd be in horrible taste. And for some reason I still said it....

I'm struggling today too, I spend 24/7 alone and it gets very repetitive and lonely"
