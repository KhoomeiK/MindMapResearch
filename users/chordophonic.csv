The second one was when I was parked (and not even in the vehicle at the time) and sideswiped - except both the police and I examined the damage and it appeared that they must have backed up and hit the car a second time.

It sounds like they took out some sound deadening, but I'm not positive. It feels like they eliminated all the rubber bushings that isolated the chassis. 

It's very track focused. It shares more with the GT3 (race version) than it does with the regular 6 series. It's the homologated M6 GT3 F13.

I opted for the carbon-ceramic brakes, and don't regret that choice. I just make sure the brakes are warm if I'm going to drive in a sporting manner. The transmission is divine. I thought I'd hate the loss of my beloved third pedal, but no... No, I'm good with the DCT automatic-manual."

Err... Yes, yes I did take it to track day. Don't judge me! That's exactly what the damned car was built for! Well, more or less... It's not a pure track car and is very streetable. 

I actually had no idea they existed. My previous daily was a 2014 6 series, and I don't recall seeing an M version of it. As I mentioned elsewhere, I was thinking about the AMG GTR and called the dealership just to see if maybe they had something to keep me with the marque. 

The M6 they sent up for me to test drive was not even from their own dealership, as I recall. I think it came from one in MA (all USA) and my dealership is in NH and I live in ME. I fell in love with it - and that was without the competition package.

Your explanation makes sense, thanks. It turns out to have some side benefits. It's the ultimate sleeper car because nobody knows. It means I don't attract attention nor get people trying to race me at stop lights. It's not until heavy acceleration that it makes itself known.

I think the best way to describe the car is just to call it absurd. I know the reviews call it heavy in the corners, but they're looking at it wrong. It's not heavy in the corners when you realize how big the fat bastard really is. For a car weighing 4500 lbs, it's downright nimble with very predictable oversteer and balance. It's a comfortable car to take to the edge.

In 2024, I'll be testing the M8. If it's not the right fit, I'm sure BMW will have something in their lineup that suits my needs.

I could have ordered mine over the 'net and just taken delivery with them, but they were helpful enough to even ensure they got me pics of the exact colors I wanted. I want to say it took like four phone calls for the entire ordering process.

I do wish I could have the HUD without the driver assist package, and I would also like the pedestrian warning to be a separate item - 'cause that's actually good at telling me when there are moose and deer hiding.

Also, I knew this going in, but 'comfort mode' is a goddamned lie on the M6. I don't even need that option and it doesn't do much of anything when I push it. It's a stiff backbone in that car and the magnetic shocks don't do that much to help when they took pretty much all the rubber bushings out to make it a real M car. Comfort mode is a damned lie - and I love it that way.

It is, in my opinion, damned near perfection - for what I use it for. It's my daily, when the weather is good and the roads are dry. I need to get it on a dyno, 'cause I'm pretty sure they're low-balling their HP numbers.

It exists. It's real. I own one! LOL

I will try to make this brief...

I smashed my femur and was in the market for something without my beloved third pedal. I was looking at the AMG GT R but wanted to stay with the BMW marque. So, I called up the BMW dealership that I usually go through and told them my problem and that I was seriously considering buying an AMG.

They sent me up an M6, sans competition package, and I was supposed to return it like a week later. I called 'em up and ordered one, going through the options on the phone, and told 'em that I'd give them back their loaner when mine was delivered. I kept said loaner until mine was delivered.

I have no idea why more people don't know about this. The citation I gave you even mentioned the competition package and the carbon-ceramic brakes. 

I have never seen another one in the wild. It's a brilliant car. Everyone should know about it. It is, hands down, the best *new* car I've ever purchased. I didn't even haggle on the price. I paid full sticker, no questions asked. It's worth every single penny."

I willingly got into the automobile. I willingly even supplied some of the intoxicants. I was the one egging him on while he was showing off his new Mustang. I'm the one that convinced him to go faster and faster.

I never refer to it as an accident. I call it a wreck. It wasn't an accident. It was the only possible outcome from our behavior.

We were pretty sure I was going to die and, for a little while, we had doubts that I'd walk again. It took me quite a while to get him to stop telling me how sorry he is. He doesn't need to be sorry. I made those decisions on my own. It's my fault for being an idiot and riding with a drunk driver and then urging them well beyond their skill and comfort level.

I have no idea if it helped, but it seems to. I've maintained a positive outlook and a realistic outlook. It would have been easy to get depressed and not do my PT. In fact, it'd have been easier.

So, maybe there's something you can do to help your dad to keep a positive view on things?

This one, in particular, I'd like to answer...

I smashed my femur right where the bone gets narrow before turning into the ball that goes into the socket. It was on a Saturday and a specialist was flown in on Sunday. My surgery was Monday. My PT began on Tuesday. The ball was completely separated from the rest of the femur.

I am not a medical doctor. I'm surprised that your father isn't already in PT. My earliest PT was just trying to move my foot on that leg. I was in the hospital for weeks and then had in-home nursing and in-home physical therapy. For about 6 weeks, I had a nurse on duty for the full 24 hour day and my PT was a couple of hours per day.

It was, for lack of a better word, pretty intense. I had both in-home because, well... Because I'm not poor and because the driver was very well insured. Like it or not, that's how it works. My medical costs have been pretty extensive but anything I paid for has been reimbursed. Specifically, I paid for one prescription the day I got out of the hospital. The insurance company refunded that.

Anyhow, I'm surprised they don't have your father doing *some* sort of PT. Even starting my PT immediately resulted in some atrophy. Once all the swelling went down, my leg was quite a bit smaller than my other leg. It wasn't until I had been walking without a cane or walker that it started to go back to normal."

It's not only fast, it's quick. In my lingo, fast is your top speed and quickness is how much time it takes you to get there. It's got torque for days. I didn't think I'd like the DCT automatic-manual, but it turns out that it's delightful and a true manual mode in that I can red line it if I had some bizarre desire to do so regularly."

Mine is the M6 Grand Coupe Competition. I love it. It's absurd. I can think of no better way to describe it. It's also overlooked. In another thread, there were people who were certain that this didn't exist in 2019. So, I had to show 'em. It really is absurd - and it's awesome. There's no way that fat bastard of a car should be as nimble as it is, but it is - and it's quick.

Damn, that M8 has a sexy ass."

nextfuckinglevel,ff5zkgv,t1_ff4vghz,1579615221.0,"I can't answer all of the many replies, so I'll pick this one.

Yes. I still get drugs. In fact, I get plenty of them.

I am not poor. I live in the US. The driver had exceptionally good insurance, meaning I'm covered well into the 7 figures. My current bills are well over 7 figures, and I paid a total of $27 which the insurance company sent back to me.

I suspect a part of the reason I still get them is that I'm honest with them and I'm not poor. They're well aware that I'll just buy them off the street if I need them. They might as well provide them to ensure I get a consistent dosage.

I also tend to dress fairly formally. So, they're well aware that I'm not in it for money and that all my expenses are covered.

Thanks to all those that replied."

The femur was the worst and is still not right. It was October 2018 and they want to go back in and do another operation. There's a fancy name, but basically I broke the ball completely off. I broke a bunch of other stuff and was actually bruised over 80% of my body - but didn't have any major internal bleeding.

The femur, however... That's rough. Don't do it! Put femur smashing right near the top of the list of things you're going to try really hard to not do. The PT is worse than the break, though I'm kind of used to that now."
