A 1 day old baby would not *fairly deserve* (does that cover it enough for you?) US citizenship, because they instead got whatever citizenship for the country they were born in the day previously.  If you were to grant a 1 day baby citizenship, why not a 2 day old?  Or a 10 day old?  It's a slippery slope. 

As for why being born somewhere should automatically mean citizenship, that's a harder answer.  The reality is that there is no alternative that works better.  If there were any conditions besides ""what country were you born in"", we would have millions of stateless people, and it would be a very easy way to discriminate against minority groups.  Stateless people are already a problem, just on a much smaller scale.

This is not a perfect solution, as anyone born outside of any country (international waters, Antarctica, space) wouldn't get citizenship.  Right now, those are not common occurances and are usually granted citizenship of the parents.

Whenever Smith starts to gain the upper hand, Neo is also appearing more human.  For example, when Smith makes Neo cough up blood, betraying his humanity.

If you had communicated that before, and she withheld that information, that's a different story.  In either case, thanks for sharing your experience."
AskReddit,febx4sn,t1_febt13u,1578963741.0,"As a person, are you sleepy or alert?  It probably depends, right?  Saying ""I'm usually alert, but right now I'm sleepy"" is long-winded.  Saying just ""I'm sleepy"" isn't really an accurate statement (might be accurate for the moment, but not overall). Now replace sleep and alert with male and female.

As an aside, imagine someone telling you you can't just be sleepy or alert depending on how you feel, you have to pick just one or the other to represent you at all times.  Imagine someone saying there's no middle ground between sleepy and alert.  Imagine being discriminated against because you used to be sleepy but now you're alert."
