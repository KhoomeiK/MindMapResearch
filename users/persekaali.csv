civ,fco9pis,t1_fco3opu,1577826952.0,Actually why is it against the rules to post a diplomacy or trade screen?
depression,fclnz8i,t1_fc65b08,1577752277.0,"I mean for me at least, it's like I KNOW 100% that the image of them I have in my head is completely false and blown out of proportion, and by pursuing them in real life I'm just setting myself up for disappointment. No one could ever be so perfect to reflect what's in my mind, because they're far more likely to reject me outright than go along with my mental story. I always get this horrible awkward feeling when I talk to them as if they could somehow see in my eyes that I've been stalking them on social media. I just feel guilty and like a total weirdo."
depression,fclnjri,t1_fc67kh3,1577751983.0,"I'm assuming it's a self-esteem thing but what do I know. I at least feel like as soon as someone shows interest in me in return it's like, well that person obviously either has shit judgement or no standards and then I lose interest because them liking me is an inherent character flaw. Go figure."
depression,fcln7j9,t1_fc7sskj,1577751750.0,"There is indeed an odd purity about unabashed love for someone, even if it's a weird obsessive, unrequited love. I remember giving my heart and soul to one teacher I had and feeling this strong sense of devotion that drove me to improve myself, and him being a teacher meant that I gave my all to the class to impress him. The intensity of it made me feel so alive. Did you have the same feelings for that other boy? Nothing will ever make me get past that teacher, though the last time I saw him was almost ten years ago and I've loved others since with the same intensity. I don't think about him anymore but my feelings were real. They feel more real than many tangible things in my current life. No matter how badly it hurt to have him torn from my life by circumstance, I wouldn't trade that feeling for the world."
depression,fc65s09,t1_fc51eka,1577472915.0,"Right?! When I lived in a big city, I used to ride the metro and just people-watch and fall in love with fantasies of random commuters for a couple of hours. Anything about them could trigger it; maybe the way their hair fell across their face, or the passive look in their eyes as they looked out the window. I'd conjure up scenarios of us being in a relationship and feel *so strongly* about them. I absolutely agree when you said that it's shattering to realise that they don't feel so intensely about anything. That reality always made me feel so much more alienated in my fantasies."
depression,fc655i0,t1_fc52d0w,1577472506.0,"Yeah man, I don't understand the psychology behind ships or why they give us that loving feeling but I also get heavily invested. I have spent way too much time both reading and writing fanfiction, and reading doujinshi."
depression,fc64wlx,t1_fc52hb8,1577472344.0,"I do the same thing to the point that I get crazy anxious when I have to meet the person in real life, but then realise after five minutes with them that my stupid brain had just blown everything out of proportion and they are a completely normal, ordinary person. Then, half an hour after I've said goodbye, the fantasies start all over again. If only the person I had feelings for could sympathise with the contents of this post."
depression,fc64gw0,t1_fc52yl8,1577472060.0,"I'm totally the same. I feel like I spend so much of my time fantasising about someone, but if that person actually showed genuine interest in me in real life I would just either lose interest or freak out and ruin any chance of romance instantly. It's just a weird fixation. It sucks but I'm glad I'm not the only one who does this."
depression,fc64119,t1_fc5f6cf,1577471773.0,"I absolutely relate to this. The true tragic nature of our infatuation is that it's entirely based on fantasy and we know that the reality of the person we're ""in love"" with probably doesn't coincide at all with what we've envisioned in our heads. The fantasy is so blown out of proportion that it doesn't really matter who the person is - their true nature is irrelevant, because our construct of them reflects only what we desire."

Birates,fa9n5q5,t1_fa8b8rq,1575881300.0,Glad I'm not the only one. I can't relate to any of the things that supposedly all bi people do.
