[Here you go](https://youtu.be/ydjdBTV8ZbY?t=123).

That test is pretty much the definition of ideal conditions, but it shows what a longsword can do. The sword penetrates quite deeply, and on one of the strikes even breaks a ring. Glancing off isn't as much of a problem against mail because there are so many little rings that the tip of your blade can catch on.

Against someone in plate armor the mail you're going for is in very vulnerable spots, like the armpits or possibly the throat, where you don't need super deep penetration to do serious damage.

>Like I said though, it wasn't that they specifically made the longswords for blunt trauma, it's that against a plated opponent you were much more likely to score a damaging blow by bludgeoning or staggering rather than slashing or cutting.

Slashing or cutting is going to be useless. Even against just mail armor you probably aren't slashing through it, unless it is very poorly made. Thrusting or smashing is the way to deal with mail, and longswords could thrust through it.

Also:

>Like I said though, it wasn't that they specifically made the longswords for blunt trauma

If I'm remembering correctly, the scales in scale armor would usually be attached to some kind of under layer of cloth or leather or something, rather than being attached to each other. What you have here is more similar to lamellar armor.

ReasonableFantasy,fej73k6,t1_feiuimn,1579159643.0,"> the point is any weakest of a breast plate also applies to the thin waists on armor

Not really, because they are in entirely different positions. It's much harder to land a solid blow on the waist than on the upper chest. To the sides you have arms in the way, and to the front your blow would likely hit the upper chest first.

On top of that, even if you manage to hit right on the hips, your blow can still be deflected aside along the groove where the curves meet. With boobplate such a deflection would send the blow straight at your neck.

Besides all of that, the armor has to have a joint at the waist because of how the body moves.

>You know that sexy and badass aren't mutually exclusive, boob armor often aims to do both.

You are still missing my point.

>Many current boob plates in fantasy are not practical but that doesn't mean all boob plates designs are impractical, there are many ways to remove disadvantage those plates have, here's one notable attempt

Boob plate is inherently less protective than not-boob plate. Even the example you link has the problem of not properly deflecting strikes that hit the center of the chest.

The most practical way to feminize armor, if you really want to do it, is like what Shad suggests early into his ""is boob plate female armor dangerous"" video. Reshape the classic dome shape of historical breastplates to emphasis the curves in the upper chest. Like [this example](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/d1/61/89/d1618933ef80da03482c66d0eaea0ad4--female-knight-knights-female.jpg) that he used in the video.

I'll also point you that your link specifically calls out the same example that Shad defends in his video.

>Some feminists find porn empowering other feminists find it dehumanizing

Boob plate there a lot of males (and few females) that find it attractive and many people consider boob plate cool. Like the previously mentioned thin waists those are more prominent among males because they are historic and often look cool.

You're really missing the point of my argument here, which is that male armor tends to make the character look cool/badass while female armor tends to make the character look sexy.

>And I personally think that realism and not the reason why artists make certain choices is more important. If it does make sense (aka is practical, hence bikini armor is stupid) there's no reason not to include boob armor and no reason to include it.

The problem is, it's not practical. It's very impractical and is only there to sexualize the characters.

>When you think about it, a author can use boob armor to world build if they really want to, society that's okay with boob armor is probably more progressive than your average medieval society about sexuality, maybe they hold female physique in high regard so do something similar to what the Greeks did with their armor. I would love to see somebody do that.

If you want to write a setting that's supposed to be progressive about sexuality, and especially female sexuality, you probably shouldn't make all the women dress up in sexy armor. Making it a cultural norm that women put extra emphasis on looking attractive over more practical terms is actually rather regressive."
characterdrawing,fei1vlx,t1_fegjx2k,1579128461.0,"No, it's bad writing. Internal consistency is very important to stories, arguably even more so in fantasy. Many elements in fantasy already strain a reader's willing suspension of disbelief. Having the setting be consistent within itself does a lot of work to help readers buy into the fantastical things that are happening. On top of that, stories that lack internal consistency can be very dissatisfying because resolutions to conflicts can feel unearned when the author is pulling things out of nowhere."

As stated you frame them entirely differently.

>It is clear that for some reason it is highly important to your outlook on life that Rey has all of the skill and a backstory as exceptional as all of those people who had a single frame in the background of the OT. Have a nice life believing that.

I could as easily say it's highly important to your outlook on life that Rey has no skill and is nothing more than a vessel for the Force to act through."

It's a difference of framing. Luke uses the Force, because for him that *is* a skill. Rey is used *by* the Force, because her skills don't matter. That's the way you've framed this."

And where in Kylo's military experience did he practice melee combat?

Why is fighting over scraps less valuable experience?

>I think it is fair to say that Kylo was at least proficient in the uncommon fighting style that is required for lightsabers.

Kylo is absolutely proficient with his lightsaber. I even agree that he's better than Rey, not just with lightsabers but with melee combat in general. But I think it's silly to completely discount Rey's own skills and experience and say she could only fight him because the Force was doing it. It just dismisses her as a character and implies you could shove anybody into that position and let the Force do its thing."
