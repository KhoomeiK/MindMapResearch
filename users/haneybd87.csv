MinnesotaCamping,ff760n5,t1_ff63wpy,1579641814.0,I contacted them and she said they allow 2 tents and they also allow 2 vehicles if they fit on the pad.
MinnesotaCamping,ff7608t,t1_ff50lbx,1579641807.0,I contacted them and she said they allow 2 tents and they also allow 2 vehicles if they fit on the pad.
MinnesotaCamping,ff75xo8,t1_ff5h6nb,1579641768.0,I talked to the park and she said they allow 1 camper/1 tent or 2 tents. They also allow 2 vehicles as long as they fit on the pad.
MinnesotaCamping,ff75ven,t1_ff6r865,1579641733.0,"There was no option for number of tents on the website, just number of people and vehicles."
MinnesotaCamping,ff75t3j,t1_ff7001v,1579641697.0,I don’t see how that matters as long as you’re not going over the 6 person limit. Why would it make a difference whether you crammed 6 people into 1 tent or 2?
MinnesotaCamping,ff56yvr,t3_ejx2a2,1579582020.0,"McDougal Lake Campground is a great one between Isabella and Ely. Kimball Lake Campground is up the Gunflint Trail from Grand Marais about half an hour, also very nice. Both are in the Superior National Forest."

gaming,fem9xw1,t3_eprpb5,1579245301.0,So the qualifications for this being an underrated gem are that it has no loot boxes or no microtransactions? It couldn’t possibly be that it’s a great game independent of those factors.
AskReddit,fem1e84,t1_felmuou,1579236616.0,"I’m good, outside sucks right now in MN."

giantbomb,feksao7,t3_epmzqn,1579206563.0,Well if Nvidia 3xxx cards come out in June this sounds like good news. I was considering getting a 2080ti beforehand but now I don’t feel bad for waiting.
gaming,fekqqp0,t1_fekijzo,1579205654.0,And 3xxx series Nvidia cards.

tvPlus,feefv7y,t1_feee9o2,1579032909.0,"Not OP but the issues I’ve seen are the browser version not going over 720p, the app on Fire Stick 4k dropping to the lowest quality after pausing and playing again and having to rebuffer. My biggest problem is on the Fire Stick 4k HDR is looking really dark, despite engaging HDR on my TV. I’ve compared to Movies Anywhere with the same movies and MA is quite a bit brighter. Now of course I can’t compare the TV+ shows but I can tell they’re looking dark."

AskReddit,feaog74,t3_eo6l00,1578950839.0,I don’t know if this is a rebellion against rules really but a guy in my high school copyrighted our mascot/logo and then demanded the school stop using it unless they pay him.

RingFitAdventure,fdpeqw5,t3_emg72d,1578626740.0,It’s not even close to accurate. I did an intense set and took my measurement and gave me 51 bpm even though my heart was racing. My resting heart rate is about 70....
RingFitAdventure,fdpek07,t1_fdn1099,1578626605.0,"I’ll also add that certain exercises can exacerbate chronic pain issues if you have any. Unfortunately those can be complicated and this game can be difficult if you have those issues, as I’ve found. It’s really hard to know which exercises can exacerbate which issues as well so if you can talk to a physical therapist that’s best."
RingFitAdventure,fdpea3v,t3_emj4wk,1578626411.0,If you’re not used to exercise then yes it’s normal. It can also be a sign of fatigue so try taking a day or two off if you’ve been doing it every day.
giantbomb,fdp0o1j,t3_emhvrh,1578617208.0,"This was such a disappointing game because I really, really like the art style but I’m just not into getting my balls stepped on."
giantbomb,fdp0ahh,t1_fdnkd27,1578616957.0,I went back and listened to an episode after not listening for a long time and I can’t believe how low energy the podcast is. It’s like they don’t care anymore.

RingFitAdventure,fde3jef,t1_fddtkl2,1578330385.0,"Yeah I get that the point is to exercise, which is the whole reason I thought not using those weaker attacks was a problem. I hadn’t even considered failure as an option, so good point."
AskReddit,fdd5nxf,t3_ekjbja,1578295877.0,Sitting. I just keep doing more and more of it and my body just feels worse.
RingFitAdventure,fdd4hjs,t1_fdd46yp,1578294420.0,"Ah good, this solves the problem then."
RingFitAdventure,fdd3bt9,t3_ekpmiu,1578293069.0,"Yeah the game will kick your butt for sure, especially if you don’t get much exercise to begin with. It’s not so much about what weight you start at but how fit you are to begin with. I’m 6’1” 360lbs but actually in decent shape and I was fine until around world 4 and at that point I had to take a few days off because my entire core felt completely disabled. 

Anyways keep at it, you’ll get used to it, but lower the difficulty further. There’s nothing wrong with starting out slow. The most important thing is to keep at it."
appletv,fdam7zc,t1_fd9wvdp,1578247616.0,Hmm my TV is only HDR10 so that won’t solve it for me sadly.
appletv,fd7et53,t1_fd74n1h,1578203357.0,Did you figure out a fix for it?
giantbomb,fd0z8yt,t3_ejpp7b,1578125786.0,I haven’t been this devastated by this type of news since the 1upocalypse (keep in mind I wasn’t really aware of GB back when Ryan died). I feel like an asshole for feeling this way considering all the other news today but still. It’s hard to explain to people why I’m in such a piss-poor mood since nobody would understand. I’m bummed out.
gardening,fcz9mqd,t3_ejg9y1,1578096466.0,Seeing this then looking outside at the cold wasteland that is MN makes me want to die.
giantbomb,fcxq1zn,t3_ejej3i,1578068765.0,Just another thing that’s worse in the world.
MovieSuggestions,fctd4ss,t1_fctayfg,1577939508.0,Paterson is also great. I also love Shoplifters (which is another one of these type of movies IMO) so I’m looking forward to checking out Still Walking. Which Lucky? The one with Harry Dean Stanton?
AskReddit,fcofywa,t3_ei4bkv,1577831304.0,"I’m doing pretty alright, I’ll have Geralt of Rivia and Yennefer of Vengerberg after me."
MoviesAnywhere,fcltcj9,t1_fclr071,1577755979.0,I think they’re referring to buying codes that come with discs from third party sellers like eBay or craigslist.
MoviesAnywhere,fclta56,t1_fcls4t0,1577755932.0,I get that but this guy was being kind of insulting. There’s a difference between explaining and belittling.
MoviesAnywhere,fcll2pa,t1_fclk6jx,1577750292.0,"The bundle also says it includes these 3 movies which are labeled as 4k HDR. I wasn’t assuming, I was going with the info that they were giving me. Stop standing up for Apple and their confusing messaging."
MoviesAnywhere,fcljz2h,t1_fcljkad,1577749558.0,"Ok I looked again and now I’m seeing the HD tag by the title. I guess I was confused because the bundle info says it comes with these movies and shows the 3 separate movies, which I click into and they say 4k HDR. It’s confusing and contradictory, especially once you factor in the 4k upgrade. I’m still going to say this is a messaging problem with iTunes, even if I had seen that HD tag on the bundle I still would have been confused because the single movies are all tagged 4k HDR."
MoviesAnywhere,fclji3w,t1_fclj5wu,1577749241.0,This was definitely a 4k bundle. The movies are all listed as 4k HDR on iTunes and they play in 4k HDR on the Apple TV app after I purchased the bundle.
MoviesAnywhere,fclj6qh,t1_fcliojc,1577749032.0,"It’s not an HD bundle, it’s a 4k bundle. It says so on the store page and it plays in 4k on the Apple TV app."
MoviesAnywhere,fclh68q,t1_fclfomy,1577747693.0,Not to mention I had to come to a subreddit to learn this. That should be communicated plainly on the store page.
MoviesAnywhere,fclct1d,t1_fclayek,1577744837.0,"I’m assuming this only applies to bundles? Because single movies always end in .99. How do you tell if a single movie will transfer in 4k?

Btw, I did go through the report a problem page from Apple to request a refund and it said my purchase did not qualify for a refund. So I’m SOL there."
DiscoElysium,fcjcfep,t3_egut96,1577682931.0,I’m having this too now. What the hell.
AskReddit,fcif7bo,t1_fciewxd,1577661629.0,I see what you’re saying. I didn’t realize he was underweight to begin with. But the situation I mentioned also commonly happens.
AskReddit,fcidham,t1_fci3dbr,1577660919.0,That could also be summed up to an addictive personality. Weed was no longer filling a void that food did fill. Weight gain is a common side effect of quitting an addiction.
AskReddit,fcidbln,t1_fcib0vg,1577660851.0,Not really the same thing. The anxiety they’re speaking of is the kind where every little (and big) thing you worry about comes to the forefront of your mind and becomes overwhelming. You’re talking about hallucinations freaking you out.
AskReddit,fc6gko2,t1_fc5ftj6,1577480075.0,You’d think nobody cares about you but I’ve actually had some dudes laugh at the small amount of weight I was lifting due to a shoulder injury. There’s a lot of assholes at the gym.
AskReddit,fc6gguf,t3_ega9qc,1577480002.0,"Don’t ask people if you can “work-in” on a machine they’re using. That’s one of the most obnoxious things I’ve encountered in the gym and I just tell people no. Unless of course someone is hogging a piece of equipment for a really long time, then maybe they need a hint."

appletv,fc4bs6o,t1_fc4bnv9,1577412114.0,"Yes I rented it and the rental is HDR, as it’s showing HDR in the description and engaging HDR on my TV. But like I said, I also compared a bunch of movies that I own that are also available on Movies Anywhere, and I’m having the same problem with those movies as well."
gardening,fbtqzrf,t3_ee7zqg,1577091168.0,Looks expensive.
