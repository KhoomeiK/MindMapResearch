I have a fat, ten old cat who has never lived a day in his life outside. But I recently acquired a cat door so he can go on the balcony of my apartment. Just the balcony! But three times he’s caught birds now, two of which he murdered. I came home after a day at work last week and found the apartment littered with feathers and a half-dead, mauled mourning dove lying terrified in my living room. It was very upsetting; at least the first bird was small enough so that my cat could easily break its neck so it was a quick death. But this was a bigger bird and I think my cat didn’t know how to kill it or lost interest. No more unsupervised outside time for him anymore."

cats,ff133wn,t3_er3b3q,1579474733.0,"Make sure they have fresh water always: clean the water bowl daily and give them fresh water daily. Cats can be prone to UTIs and kidney infections, and cats can *smell* water which is why they often prefer drinking from their owners cups (our cups tend to have fresher water than their bowls). 

Use glass or steel bowls for their food and water, not plastic. Get raised bowls too, which help with digestion. 

Know that your cat will likely take time to adjust to your schedule—which means they may be very active at night while you’re trying to sleep. You have to be patient, but eventually the cat will adjust to your sleep schedule.  

Keep their litter clean or else they won’t want to use it. 

Make sure your cat stays indoors and is spayed or neutered. Nothing keeps a cat healthier than an indoor versus outdoor lifestyle."

Have you talked to your landlord? This situation feels like an exceptionally rare circumstance and maybe they’d be willing to work something out with you? 

Additionally, I’d definitely recommend therapy if you aren’t already going... not because I think you’re crazy or anything, but because something like this is bound to fuck with you mentally and you shouldn’t give him any more power than he has over you already. Don’t let this situation affect you any longer than it has to. All of this is much easier said than done, and again I’m so deeply sympathetic and sorry you’re dealing with this. People can be such pieces of shit, but it doesn’t mean you deserve it. 

I really wish you the best. Good luck. <3"
