Back in ARR there were a few times I even got yelled at in chat *FOR* doing DPS. Not that it was distracting me from healing, but they were legitimately upset that I wasn't 'sticking to my role'. The first few times, to avoid arguments, I simply obliged them. They were some of the most boring dungeon runs I've ever done, because it was just regen followed by Cure II once every hundred years.

dataisbeautiful,fchhm16,t1_fcfyw4f,1577650564.0,"Close, but not quite. The basics of his argument were that ships themselves were built super safe during the modern era, that sea routes were so well regulated that two ships would never collide and that if they were they could communicate by telegraph, and that further regulating life boats would be generally unfair to ship owners for various reasons. And, even following the Titanic, he was against requiring more lifeboats, and was pretty clearly just against regulations. Here's the relevant part of his transcript:

>I considered the matter very closely from time to time. I first of all considered the record of the trade - that is to say, the record of the casualties - and to see what immunity from loss there was. I found it was the safest mode of travel in the world, and I thought it was neither right nor the duty of a State Department to impose regulations upon that mode of travel as long as the record was a clean one. Secondly, I found that, as ships grew bigger, there were such improvements made in their construction that they were stronger and better ships, both from the point of view of watertight compartments and also absolute strength, and I considered that that was the road along which the shipowners were going to travel, and that they should not be interfered with. I then went to the maximum that is down in the table - 16 boats and upwards, together with the supplementary boats, and I considered from my experience that that was the maximum number that could be rapidly dealt with at sea and that could be safely housed without encumbering the vessel's decks unduly. In the next place, I considered that the traffic was very safe on account of the routes - the definite routes being agreed upon by the different companies, which tended to lessen the risk of collision, and to avoid ice and fog. Then, again, there was the question of wireless telegraphy which had already come into force on board of these passenger ships. I was seized of the fact that in July, 1901, the ""Lucania"" had been fitted with wireless telegraphy, and the Cunard Line, generally, fitted it during that year to all their ships. The allan Line fitted it in 1902, and I am not sure that in 1904 it had not become quite general on the trans-Atlantic ships. That, of course, entered into my consideration as well. Then another point was the manning. It was quite evident to me that if you went on crowding the ship with boats you would require a crew which were not required otherwise for the safe navigation of the ship, or for the proper upkeep of the ship, but you are providing a crew which would be carried uselessly across the ocean, that never would be required to man the boats. Then the last point, and not the least, was this, that the voluntary action of the owners was carrying them beyond the requirements of our scale, and when voluntary action on the part of shipowners is doing that, I think that any State Department should hold its hand before it steps in to make a hard-and-fast scale for that particular type of shipping. I considered that that scale fitted all sizes of ships that were then afloat, and I did not consider it necessary to increase it, and that was my advice to Sir Walter Howell.

And when asked if he would advise increasing required lifeboats:


>No. I would not personally. I consider you would be putting an undue strain upon the masters and Officers - that they could never possibly get people into the boats in case of a disaster.

dataisbeautiful,fcepi1c,t1_fcenpb1,1577622603.0,"You know that doesn't support your statement, right? It's why I didn't contest your original post saying that people were initially hopeful that the lifeboats could be ferried back because the ship was sinking so slowly. What I have a problem with is you continuing to say that the amount of lifeboats were normal because this was the mentality when outfitting the ship with lifeboats. It was not. Lifeboats were meant to get everyone off a ship in the best case scenario of a sinking. The regulations at the time desperately needed to be changed because they assumed ships wouldn't be as big, or hold the capacity of people, as the Titanic and even other ships at the time.

You are confusing the mentality of the passengers and crew of the Titanic with the overall intended utility of lifeboats at the time."

dataisbeautiful,fcejdsw,t1_fcegvga,1577621020.0,"> And yes they carried more lifeboats than was legally required

By like four, and I don't see how that proves your point. And the regulations were definitely not seen as safe and proven, just nobody pushed to have them changed because ship liners didn't want to have to pay for more lifeboats. Just how safety regulations go today. The fact that they got changed following the disaster proves this, because the Titanic brought to light how outdated the regulations are.

And NONE of what you said goes to prove that lifeboats were meant to ferry back and forth, so not as many were needed. You're making up historical facts, and refuse to admit it.

You are contesting heavily agreed upon facts about the Titanic and regulations at the time."
dataisbeautiful,fcef4e3,t1_fcedg0v,1577619887.0,"No, it was because they were able to fly under outdated regulations. In fact the original designs of the Titanic included significantly more lifeboats. I don't know where you're getting your information, but it's definitely not 100% accurate. Even what I'm posting is only half the picture, because I don't intend on sitting here giving a full history lesson on the complete disaster that was fitting the Titanic with lifeboats.

Edit to your edit: that literally goes back to the bad and outdated regulations on lifeboats.

Second edit: to those starting to downvote me, here's an interview with an actual survivor of the Titanic saying she blames bad regulations for people not surviving. It's at the end of you wish to skip it, but the overall interview is powerful and worth watching.
