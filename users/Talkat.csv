YangForPresidentHQ,fcu2rsi,t1_fcu0a26,1577970755.0,"# Andrew Yang Raised $16.5 Million in the Last 3 Months, His Campaign Says

Donations to Mr. Yang in the fourth quarter of 2019 were his highest in any such period and put him among the top fund-raisers in the Democratic presidential field.

Donors gave more than $1.3 million on Tuesday, the last day of the quarter — the campaign’s largest single-day haul.“At every turn in this race Andrew Yang continues to exceed expectations, whether it’s in terms of grass-roots fund-raising, making the debates, early-state polling or the ability to draw big crowds,” his campaign chief, Nick Ryan, said in a statement. “What we have achieved together to date through the humanity-first values of this campaign now sets us up to compete through the early-state primaries, Super Tuesday and beyond.”

Mr. Yang’s fund-raising haul was remarkable for a candidate who has never held political office: He raised more in the fourth quarter than former Vice President [Joseph R. Biden Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html) did in the third quarter ($15.7 million).

But he remains far from the top of the field financially. Senator [Bernie Sanders](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html) of Vermont [announced Thursday](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-fundraising.html) that his campaign had raised $34.5 million in the last three months of the year, and [Pete Buttigieg](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/pete-buttigieg.html)’s campaign [said Wednesday](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/us/politics/pete-buttigieg-fundraising.html) that it had raised $24.7 million."

unrealengine,fcpqcsp,t1_f60m9lz,1577869846.0,"Hi mate, thanks for your response. I was also looking at running UE4 on an Arm chip and this has helped clear it up. I was then looking at packaging it for Linux but from the packaging I have done it was a real pain in the butt to package it (and the wait time), send it to the device, and then open it. 

Is there a faster method to quickly push updates to multiple devices running the same UE4 code?"
YangForPresidentHQ,fc93icd,t3_egnyqd,1577546430.0,"I like both candidates but I think yang is more practical and his policies are far more future orientated. I think Sanders wants to bring in free tuition, which would obviously be nice, but I think a UBI would be revolutionary. You can learn almost anything online and colleges are inefficient and expensive and fear that free tuition would just make them more bloated. A UBI is a super efficient way of helping many many people. 

By the way, bravo for doing this. I'm not really in a position to support Yang but this lets me do a little be to lend a hand. Very much appreciate your generosity and helping me contribute to something I believe in. Thank you."

My general Under standing is that the orbits they are in decay in < 5 years and are designed to burn up reentry. And if there were an accident it would accelerate that. 
As for light pollution, I personally think itisa very low cost to pay for providing high speed internet to the planet."
