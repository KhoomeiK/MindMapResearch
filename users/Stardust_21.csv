End of the day, just simply say that you are honoring your fathers wishes by following his will (I’m assuming that he’s got one, and she ain’t in it).  To me that’s really all that needs to be said. She’s gonna argue I’m sure, just turn into a broken record. Let that be the only thing you say when she or one of her monkeys brings it up. Heck, you and all your siblings could do it. Have a united front! Sounds like a shitty situation tho, and I truly hope that you all stick to your guns and don’t give in to her. She already got her half!! Ugh. Some people.

We really hadn’t hung out but maybe once every couple of months when they were dating. Thing is, we were both cool with that. When we would get together, we’d geek out like kids, express home much we loved the other blah-blah-blah. So when she asked me to be a moh, I was a little surprised. We kinda talked about it and she felt kinda like you explained above. It was a fantastic wedding too btw :)"

I definitely still want a relationship. When we’re good, it’s really good. On the other hand, when it’s bad, it’s this bullshit.  I don’t have other family that I’m close with. Nor does she. So, then butting in (or not) won’t be an issue. I feel like I’m her only thing in this world currently. Well... I basically am. Not married, very few friends, and even fewer w/in driving distance, doesn’t work, no other kids, and her dog died (we put her down) 9 months ago.
I will most definitely be coming back here for support. I’m SO glad to have found this group. This is probably one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. I so appreciate the advice and kind words and support ♥️"

Also, how do you do the special-sarcastic-font, lol. I’m on mobil. I literally laughed out loud when I got to the trash part. She live up on a hill, and has a pretty long driveway, so she’s said something shit along those lines before. It’s like your psychic!!"
JUSTNOMIL,fcop5d6,t1_fcolb5o,1577837869.0,Ah yes... I can see how that would be. Whoops. I’m still at the point where I want her to “get it”. Want someone else to tell her she’s acting bat shit crazy. Ugh.

I 100% agree that therapy would help. I’m really hoping that maybe, just maybe, she’ll really think about what and how she’s talked to me in relation to me stopping communication for a while."
JUSTNOMIL,fco75kz,t1_fcneujd,1577825376.0,"It’s hard for me to think that she’s not put in effort, because she has done a lot, and been there for me. But then I think, that’s what good parents do... lol. She now is holding that over my head and expects me to do “a-b-c” because she did whatever before. 
One of the crazier ones was one time we were talking on the phone,and she starts going off about “I took you to Mexico all those times. Paid for everything etc.” and I just couldn’t think of what she was referring to, then it hit me and I asked “wait... are you talking about when I was in 7th and 8th grade?”. She said yes and I laughed out loud. Best part of this, one of her now deceased best friends lived down there. She wasn’t “taking” me on a trip, we were going so she could see her friend. Who just happened to live in Mexico.  That one really took the cake. Lol. 
But she does want me to be her keeper. Has been suggesting for the last several years “I wish you’d consider buying a duplex with me... you could be on one half, me in the other. We’d save money and be there for each other”. FUCK. NO."
JUSTNOMIL,fco6hdh,t1_fcn9x94,1577824998.0,"This is an amazing letter. Thank you. Just reading it makes me tear up... ugh. I will definitely be utilizing this. 
In regards to therapy, I’ve even suggested that we go together (probably a year ago? 8 months?) and her response was “we don’t need to go to therapy, you just need to treat me better” lol. What a fucking piece of work. As for the GF thing, that’s one of her chief complaints to/about me. “I thought we’d be best friends/close” so anything other than that is... unacceptable? A short coming? Idk wtf she thinks it is. There’s definitely some inappropriate emotional enmeshment going on that I just recently became aware of."
JUSTNOMIL,fco69ub,t1_fcn3ewz,1577824881.0,"Lol, I told her about Meetup years ago. Doesn’t do any of it cuz “it’s all down the hill” ie- 30 min drive.  She’d likely turn down the bingo & cards suggestion because she wouldn’t want to be around all those old people, Hahahah. I will mention it at some point tho.  She finally found a handyman,  but never ceases to remind me that “no she’s got to pay someone to do these things because you won’t”. The fucking guilt trips are real man. Thanks for the support. Means a lot. I’m in that spot (and assume I will be for a bit) where I still need the validation of my actions. Being in this group and just reading others situations, peoples suggestions, has I’m sure greatly helped me be able to do this. I’m grateful to have found it."

This is one of my greatest fears at this point. I’ve already not gone on trips because of my guilt and fear of the repercussion. That fact is disgusting to me. At this point, I won’t even have the time or be able to put my life on hold. I’m looking to be starting a new full time 9-5 within a couple weeks, and I will be doing grad school as well (albeit online,  but still).

My therapist said to me recently, “what are you so afraid of? It couldn’t be any worse than what your getting now”.  Joining this group has been super helpful. Learning all sorts of new stuff, lol. In regards to tending to her, I’ve found myself thinking “jeeze... I figured I’d be taking care of her at some point, but this is just too early!” and then feeling guilty for the resentment that I had thinking that. I think this time it’s a little more hurtful too because we had JUST had such a fantastic couple of days. Ugh. I’d like to at least have one parent still. Then I feel horrible (guilt) thinking how much easier my life would be without her in it. I feel terrible saying that, but it’s true. She’s the one person that makes me feel shitty in my life.
