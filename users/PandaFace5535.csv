Moms sometimes... I think our kitties are much happier without having to care for kittens, and no animals end up in shelters because of our irresponsibility."

truechildfree,fek4j09,t1_fejtmgc,1579192447.0,"Absolutely! I am now on the liberte. It's a five year one, just like the Mirena. I didn't find any heavy bleeding with this one. I personally have cramping with my periods, but I haven't found them to be affected by the IUD. I'm on year 4, and would definitely use it again. 😊"
truechildfree,feiphv4,t3_epb77i,1579143993.0,"I have had two copper and one Mirena. The first one was a copper one, hurt for insertion. I did bleed for the first few weeks. No hormones, so I wass getting a period. Unfortunately, it failed and I had to terminate pregnancy. I went onto the Mirena. I still spotted, which like a previous poster mentioned, is normal. It did not work out for me because it lowered my libido to the point where I was simply uninterested (kinda defeats the point for my reason's to be on it). I am now on a different copper one and I absolutely love it. I don't mind periods, and they stay on schedule with this IUD. removal is virtually painless. Sometimes SO can feel the string, but that's because it unwinds from the cervix right after a period.

Note: if the doc cuts the string to be longer, it will wrap around the cervix, which can make it easier to find on your own to check it. Ideally it's supposed to be checked once a month. 

I definitely advocate for the IUD. Good luck, and definitely talk with your doctor or gynecologist about what options are best for you."
AmItheAsshole,feb1ph3,t3_eo4xsd,1578954596.0,"NTA - What on earth makes it okay to stalk a neighbor? You have every right to say what you did, and were straight to the point. There was no room for argument. You didn't call him names, or cuss the hell out of him (again, you would have every right to). You were polite, but direct. He didn't like that. Not your problem. Hopefully he leaves you alone."

puppy101,fe7sqhi,t3_eo1y1o,1578918849.0,"I was told the same thing, and was questioned on why I keep them on a lead at all times. I don't let her roam because she's too rambunctious, and always tries to eat SOMETHING. People were making snide comments about how we also had a pee journal so we can be more on top of her potty training. These were ""seasoned"" dog owners, so we were taking advice where we could. Stopped the journal and scheduling naps and omg. Instant change in potty training and she was a trantrum monster who barked at 2am. We went back to our schedule, and it was like night and day. Stick to your guns, you know what's best for you and your puppy."

truechildfree,fd9tat5,t3_ekdixr,1578237765.0,"There was a post on r/depression from someone (I just spent way too long scrolling there trying to find it, if I do I'll post the link to the article). The gist of it was the OP was CF, but then caved to his wife wanting a child, because he loved her and wanted to make her happy, tdlr: it didn't turn out well for him. He had depression, so that didn't help his specific situation, but he was miserable. Saying that he completely regrets agreeing to having a child for the sake of his wife. He made it clear to his wife how unhappy he was, and she still said she was looking forward to trying for a second one. ????? 

Obviously I don't know the whole circumstances for you, but it sounds like your GF is using emotional manipulation. At the same time, she may be just as upset with where the relationship may be headed. I'm sure that hearing your CF news (not actually news because your profile conveyed this already) may have her feeling heartbroken. It's not easy, especially if you love that person, but she isn't compatible with your future. Don't have children for someone else because it may make them happy, if you already know it won't make YOU happy. 

Good luck, sounds like a sticky situation to be in."
puppy101,fd0szzb,t3_ejr3w0,1578123348.0,"Not going to lie, our 22wk old goldendoodle has just randomly started barking and whining in her crate again. It's up and down it seems. But the length of time that they bark for, and how often definitely goes down. It'll take a few months, just be patient and don't back down with the training. We found it helped A LOT to wait at least 3min after the last bark before going into their line of vision (or opening the door to the room their crate is in if it was closed). Good luck, you got this."

dogs,fcm1p1w,t3_eho07v,1577761926.0,"The only thing I want to add to this is: a friend adopted a puppy, raised to adulthood, and it did NOT help her depression. She had no ability to get out of bed, so her adult dog deficated/urinated on everything but her bedroom. They tore her house apart out of boredom. She got two kittens a bit after surrendering the dog (don't get me started, I was not impressed either) but it ended up being a great decision. She isn't in a great place, but she has company and she can better care for them. Don't do it unless you've had a dog before, or decide on a smaller dog. I do hope you find what you need to feel good, depression sucks the big one."
dogs,fcm1ju3,t1_fcm0h0t,1577761820.0,"I did the same thing. It caused me so much anxiety just to think about getting up and dealing with a puppy. Adopting an older dog is what I should have done, but I am looking forward to the amazing adult she almost is."

puppy101,fckf8rv,t1_fckcqj1,1577724006.0,"We thought we had really bad puppy, but it turns out that it is totally normal (unfortunately) lol. We had no idea that puppies are like toddlers, but it's legit like a stompey toddler. There's no listening, and is a nightmare to try to walk, so into the crate she goes. Thankfully our puppy rarely barks now, used to be all the time. She has caught on that there's no reward for barking.

Persistence and patience is key. Best of luck to you and your puppy! :)"
puppy101,fck750m,t3_ehkx41,1577718459.0,"You are definitely not alone in this at all. Our goldendoodle was an absolute land shark, and I spent for first two months crying in the bedroom. Bleeding and all cut up for both me and husband. The yelps didn't work, but saying OUCH and walking away/redirection worked until we could get her into puppy class. We were able to get her into puppy class at 12wks, which is definitely what helped her biting inhibition. Call around to different places to see how early they can take puppies for socialization classes, it is honestly the best teacher. 

Our puppy gets real bity when she's tired (she has full blown temper tantrums), so we do scheduled naps. We are at a point finally where we can do our normal thing while she's in the kennel for a nap. The walking away only worked for us because we had her tethered to something at all times, otherwise she would just follow and bite our legs. It takes time, our puppy is 5mths now, and you really have to appreciate the milestones. I promise it gets better."
