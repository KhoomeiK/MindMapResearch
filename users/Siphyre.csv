I had a civics teacher who was able to discuss politics in an unbiased manner though, and that was relieving.

Punishments inherently discourage crimes by their very nature. If the punishment is more severe, it will have a bigger effect on it. For example, if a speeding ticket was only a dollar, many more people would speed. But if it was $1,000, less would speed. So your statement saying otherwise is either completely made up by you, or you have gotten it from some corrupt source (my bet is that you are parroting headlines that others have parroted without actually reading and thinking for yourself).

No, but obviously you are. I didn't disagree that in some places the death penalty is more expensive, and I already understand why. Which is why I said that I didn't think it should be. You seem to lack reading comprehension.

>so you are proposing we start murdering innocent people again while taking a huge financial burden

No, I'm proposing that we fix the justice system to keep innocent people from being found guilty without a doubt. If this was fixed, nobody innocent would be on death row. And doing this we could also save the money from housing people that would end up dead anyways. And speaking from a strictly number side of things, only about 1.6% of people on death row that are innocent get executed. So speeding up the process would save tons of money on quick executions for people that were guilty. I also mentioned this somewhat on this comment chain and another comment that only men and women that have clear physical evidence against them (DNA + Video + Eye witness) should be on death row. Not circumstantial stuff like bootprints or eye witness from 100 yards away of you leaving the scene.

>the death penalty will not give anyone closure

Amazon would have no way of knowing what the dude did, and it would be better PR for them to fire him, instead of letting him stay. So obviously Amazon would fire their minimum wage worker to save themselves from a PR nightmare."

Do you not live in a state that does popular vote on certain things like raising taxes and shit like that? Because my county and state does it every election. 

Also, the people you vote for tend to do the things on their platform says they do. So you could always vote based on that instead of acting like some sort of victim of corruption and just voting on party lines. Very few politicians drift from their election platform, and most do it only for very good reasons.
