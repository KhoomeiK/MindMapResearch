BipolarSOs,ffdghht,t1_ffd48xq,1579820367.0,i’m the same way.
BipolarSOs,ffdg3oj,t3_esultl,1579820146.0,"hi bipolar person here, as someone with this disease, this has happened multiple times to me (granted i was never married) but the illness can get especially bad if he forgets to take his medication. it’s a dangerous thing when someone forgets. you’re a great person for sticking with him and understanding his disease. i recently made very similar statements to a girl i loved and now i’m afraid things will never be the same. every time i’m manic i don’t notice it in the moment and it causes fights because of the hurtful things i say. i believe you need to seek therapy and maybe file for a divorce. in some ways he’s purposefully not taking his meds."
