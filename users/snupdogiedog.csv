And

""I don't think we should be together anymore. We are not compatible and there is a disconnect between us"".

The first one is where you say that you aren't breaking up with them, but just taking a break from the relationship so you can focus on a problem or what it might be.

The last one is where you say the relationship is over. You can say it was a mistake and get back together, but you were still broken up at one point.


That's why we need the info, she says they were on a break, but she also says they broke up. It depends on how it was communicated, stop trying to box everything and make rules, relationships are dynamic."

 [r/niceguys](https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys) is not for showcasing general misogyny or bad behavior. There needs to some sort of claim from the man (or woman!) that he is nice/good/morally superior, etc. 

Rule 5. Off Topic

 Just because a post could fit in [r/justneckbeardthings](https://www.reddit.com/r/justneckbeardthings) or [r/CreepyPMs](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyPMs) doesn't mean it fits here.

Also, he called her baby, probably because they had been on a date before or he felt comfortable enough with her to call her that. There is literally no context on how they know each other, so you can make any assumptions you want. She literally went on the defensive when people asked her about how they knew each other and such, that says a lot I think.

The original twitter post had the caption ''He really defending his pockets''  
It's not about her, it's the fact that he's broke.  


You people throw the word misogynistic around too much, he's not being a misogynist.  


He never claimed that all women are ""demanding to be treated to dinner because he thinks all feeemales just want money and free things."" That's a conclusion you're drawing, not him.
