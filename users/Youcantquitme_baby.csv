Accutane,ff08ohq,t3_er1op0,1579466362.0,"How often are you washing your hair? 

Try for only 1x weekly with the whole shampoo + conditioner routine, and somewhere halfway through that week just co-wash with conditioner. You'll notice your hair will be softer. 

As far as the shedding goes, I shed a lot too, it was more noticeable when I moved to washing less but I think it was just because hair that normally would have fallen when I washed more often just kind of accumulated for that 1-2 times a week that I actually got it wet and brushed it. 

I think I saw someone here recommend Nioxin shampoo and conditioner, maybe someone can chime in on that. 

Stay strong girl"

Not entirely sure if she had a sensitivity to anesthesia, or was given too much, or if some things already in her system caused a reaction, but **her heart literally stopped for several minutes and she had to be rushed to emergency care**. 

She was in a coma for several weeks before her family decided to pull the plug. She left behind a husband and two small children. 


Check if you have bad reactions to anesthesia before you actually need it, folks."

My role involves talking to clients and finding a service to fit their needs. 

A client of mine, who is a sweet, friendly man,  had a shipment that he needed quickly for a machine tooling. 
His supplier was difficult to work with and not giving my corresponding teammate any sort of lead time so that we could plan appropriately.

We made suggestions to my client that we asked that he give to the supplier,  to help move things along easier. 

He told me ""It'll be about as easy getting them to cooperate, as it would be to shit out a gold bar.""

Imagine being a kid and you can ""hear"" because of an operation, but you can't play sports or swim and you look different because you have a piece of machinery in your head.

All because your parents made a decision FOR you when you were a baby, rather than learning a new language. Or at the very least, allow you to make a decision about your body when you're old enough to consent.

AskReddit,fcztu5z,t3_ejqosl,1578108509.0,"Moved in at 16 with my then boyfriend because the parents and I weren't best buds. 

I had no car, no possessions, a shitty minimum wage part time job and still 2 years of high school to go. 

I finished high school. Walked to work every day a mile there and back after school. 
Bought my first car at 19 for $500. 
It was a piece but it got me around for two years.

A couple years later, I marry the boyfriend at 21, but we divorce when I'm 23 because I caught the dude cheating with a mutual friend. 

I choose to move out and get a tiny, one bedroom apartment that is a 15 minute walk from where I worked ( a couple jobs later, pay was slightly better but not quite sustainable).
All my furniture and possessions were hand-me-downs or thrifted. 

I met someone when I was 25, we moved in together 2 years later. With his encouragement I kept applying to jobs I was interested in but not necessarily qualified for. Landed one after a year of applications. 

A couple of years after that, I've now been promoted in my department and made a decent living that I could easily support myself on. 

And my SO and I just bought our first house this past summer. It's larger and nicer than anything we ever thought either of us would ever own. 

I'm grateful."

But at least I did not have to interpret the damn thing like you did. 

Oh, it's the worst when they ask for verbal confirmation! I've said the same line, ""they're deaf"" and I've literally been told that they need to call back with an interpreter. That's about the point I ask them why it's better for a complete stranger to give them ""verbal confirmation"" when the person they are speaking to is even more removed than I am."

I'm willing to bet that you would go with him to doctor appointments, etc, because you couldn't trust anyone else to help your dad with best interests better than you? 

I ended up doing a bad rendition during my grandmother's funeral because nobody thought to hire an interpreter for my deaf father and deaf aunt. I so was not in the right mindset to interpret  effectively and I still think about it 10 years later.

Things I notice about myself is that I somewhat rely on facial expressions or lip-reading to fully grasp what is being said. I do fine if I just try to pay more attention though. 

I prefer to watch stuff with subtitles even if my parents aren't visiting. 

Positive things I noticed as a kid was that my reading level was several years ahead of my peers. But I also learned to love reading at an early age, so could be just coincidence. 

Test taking was always easy for me, I could read something once and remember it. 

I also matured quickly because I constantly had to do things / interpret for my parents before the ADA and programs like DeafCAN.
