Well, I waddled my heavily pregnant, fat ass out of our car, picked up every single piece of trash, then turned to that laughing little shit and asked him,
“What in the HELL, made you think that was a good idea?” Then I turned and waddle/marched up to his parent’s place, knocked in the door and explained the situation to his beyond hellishly pissed off dad and mortified mother. 

I explain that not only did they throw that armful of trash I had at our moving car, but that my husband was a witness, sitting in our car with our 1yr-old if they wanted to talk to him too. Kid immediately started crying/whining/throwing a tantrum, while his friend looked like a pale husk as his soul left him. Mom screamed at the friend that he needed to leave NOW, that his mom would be hearing about it, and that if he ever came back to their side of the complex, that there would be problems... 

That little shit stayed away from us after that day and we never had another problem. The parents were really apologetic, and very kind."
