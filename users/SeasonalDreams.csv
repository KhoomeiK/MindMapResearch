I had an aunt who actually had a very well behaved dog. She was really diligent and did her work because she didn‚Äôt want a nightmare dog. 

Then a family reunion happened and the kids played with her dog. They‚Äôre kids, so they enjoyed riling the dog up and getting it excited. 

The dog learned a ton of terrible habits that weekend, one of the worst of which was biting people‚Äôs feet under the table.

The dog NEVER unlearned the crap it adopted over that weekend. Months, maybe years, of diligent training down the drain. The dog was a little shit from that moment forward. 

Dogs are so fucking fragile. They will turn on a dime. There is no such thing as a well-behaved dog, only dogs that are currently behaving well because they are not being triggered into bad behavior."

It only gets worse. Once a dog acquires a new bad habit, it never never fully goes away. Even if you get the dog to stop for a while, it will start back up again at the tiniest trigger. 

So, as the dog gets older, these bad behaviors will just keep compounding. 

When people say ‚Äúit gets better‚Äù, all they mean is that they get better at adjusting their lives around their dog. They also become more attached to the dog, so are more willing to excuse the behavior.

Tarotpractices,fcsov0h,t3_eikf6n,1577921375.0,"I've only been practicing since May, but I think it's actually better not to do it every day.

When I sit down to do a serious self-reading, it takes a lot out of me. The cards usually make me think of serious and heavy topics, and I'm usually marking down thoughts I'm having in my journal. I can't imagine doing that every day.

I do have a routine 2-card spread that I like to do to set the tone for the day. But I don't do that one every day, either.

When I'm not doing a spread, I do like to read a little more about readings or the tarot in general, just so I can keep learning even when I'm not actually using the cards. But I don't think it's necessary to actually do a reading every single day, especially if you don't feel inspired to do so."
