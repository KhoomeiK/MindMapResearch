As for google, I’m probably a lot older than you, but there was WAY less information about this at this time. I needed advising, and advisors told me it was fine. I did a lot of math based on the lowest estimates of what they thought I would realistically make. I didn’t go into this blind.

I had an aunt who actually had a very well behaved dog. She was really diligent and did her work because she didn’t want a nightmare dog. 

Then a family reunion happened and the kids played with her dog. They’re kids, so they enjoyed riling the dog up and getting it excited. 

The dog learned a ton of terrible habits that weekend, one of the worst of which was biting people’s feet under the table.

The dog NEVER unlearned the crap it adopted over that weekend. Months, maybe years, of diligent training down the drain. The dog was a little shit from that moment forward. 

Dogs are so fucking fragile. They will turn on a dime. There is no such thing as a well-behaved dog, only dogs that are currently behaving well because they are not being triggered into bad behavior."
Dogfree,fe6n455,t3_enybhe,1578896642.0,"It does not get better, wow!!!

It only gets worse. Once a dog acquires a new bad habit, it never never fully goes away. Even if you get the dog to stop for a while, it will start back up again at the tiniest trigger. 

So, as the dog gets older, these bad behaviors will just keep compounding. 

When people say “it gets better”, all they mean is that they get better at adjusting their lives around their dog. They also become more attached to the dog, so are more willing to excuse the behavior. 

You did the right thing."

I feel like a lot of dog owners keep in their heads that one or two nice times they had with their dogs, and just hold onto that for posterity, and completely ignore how actually living with a dog day to day is completely miserable. They don’t want to be reminded.

Edit: I just wanted to share because I got a great case in point right after posting this. An acquaintance of mine posted on social media that she apologized if it took her longer to respond to her phone in the future. She had to turn off all audible notifications on her phone. Why? Her dog has now mysteriously adopted the new behavior of going absolutely apeshit every time he hears a sound coming from the phone, including barking fits that won’t stop.

Tarotpractices,fcsov0h,t3_eikf6n,1577921375.0,"I've only been practicing since May, but I think it's actually better not to do it every day.

When I sit down to do a serious self-reading, it takes a lot out of me. The cards usually make me think of serious and heavy topics, and I'm usually marking down thoughts I'm having in my journal. I can't imagine doing that every day.

I do have a routine 2-card spread that I like to do to set the tone for the day. But I don't do that one every day, either.

When I'm not doing a spread, I do like to read a little more about readings or the tarot in general, just so I can keep learning even when I'm not actually using the cards. But I don't think it's necessary to actually do a reading every single day, especially if you don't feel inspired to do so."
