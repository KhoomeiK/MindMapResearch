depression,feeriwo,t3_eoq8rq,1579039670.0,"Same. I properly gave up 6 months ago. Living with my parents now doing absolutely nothing and striving for nothing. Been hanging out with my friends less and less. Living off of my savings. 

It is awful.

If its ok for me to make a suggestion, try to do anything to get out of it. Like I said its been a few months, and at this point I feel like i'm just waiting for homelessness > starvation > death, or maybe i'll get brave one day and find a way to end myself. Trying to think positive might help. It may sound cheesy but thinking ""tomorrow is another day"" also helps, at least for me.

Good luck"

funny,feb3ice,t1_feazr0q,1578955092.0,"Actually didn't happen and I implore you to link proof that isn't an isolated instagram pic with the caption ""power to the people"" in front of a chinese flag, because thats all he did. I imagine if he was in Canada he would do something similar with a caption saying ""the true north"" or something. Just getting the locals hyped."
AskReddit,fdji48l,t1_fdjaxxv,1578471838.0,"Hmm sounds similar to what I learned from my mom not too long ago. When I was in 1st or 2nd grade I was acting out a lot, and the school figured out it was because of a chaotic home life. The school suggested therapy and I think even had a program specifically for kids like me, but she turned them down. 

I overheard her talking about that and asked why she didn't take them up on their offer. She said she didn't do it because she didn't want them to turn me into a ""guinea pig"". 

Rough translation: I don't believe in mental health and my son watching my husband and I scream at each other every night is perfectly normal."

videos,fcp20wb,t1_fcob7bq,1577848048.0,"Dude i know your comment is 5 hours old but I unsubbed like an hour ago just because of that. Some guys girlfriend said she thought the dinosaurs existed at the same time as the roman empire. Obviously not a smart thing to say but whatever. Instead of just saying that it wasn't true, the guy calls his girlfriend a dumbass to her face. She gets upset (to the surprise of no rational person) and goes home. Then the guy makes a post asking if he's the asshole.

There are SO MANY people in that thread saying that he's not the asshole because she's a dum dum so obviously that means you can insult her. There's one comment in particular that says if his girlfriend said that then he would just laugh in her face uncontrollably. And there are many people going ""what else were you supposed to do!?"" like insulting her was literally the only option. 

That place is such an oily latrine now. Why would anyone ever take pride in being an asshole?"
