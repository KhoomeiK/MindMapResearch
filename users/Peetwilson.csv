Multiple shows at that price are out of the question and I'm fucking bummed to have missed Providence N2 antics and that Hood because I couldn't afford it. Of course I have a great fucking time every time but it's so fleeting and the shows over in 3/hrs. Magnaball tickets were $225 for the entire weekend. The legal scalping industry has got to stop.
