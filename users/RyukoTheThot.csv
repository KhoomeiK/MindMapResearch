Warframe,fekm0qr,t3_epna28,1579202845.0,"I saw someone with that attitude when I was farming for Cryotic, he complained because I ""didn't killed the enemies faster"" It was on Pluto and I was playing Revenant, spinning all the time to kill every enemies. That guy did 6% of the total damage and i did something around 40% (A Mesa Prime was exterminating the map :) ). He then started talking about his ""feelings"" and his ""sadness"", I asked gently what was wrong in his life so I could help him a bit, he answered ""Stfu, you cunt you don't know what breaking a phone feels like"" words for words. I laughed and quitted the game to calm my lungs after what happened. Protect these engendered species."
