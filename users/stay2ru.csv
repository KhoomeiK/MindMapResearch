Adoption,fd6ah7a,t1_fd5apv6,1578188001.0,"I think it’s a great thing in the long run. Just knowing your family history for the purpose of disease prevention is good enough reason to support DNA testing. That’s the reason I want to do it. I’m 32 and adopted (closed) and know no family or medical history. 

Closed adoptions are unfair to the adoptees. It’s my life, my history, my choice whether or not to find out about my birth family should be given preference. Closed adoptions were created to protect the adoptee from their birth family coming back, changing their mind, and stirring up a shit storm of legal trouble and causing emotional damage to the adopted family. Closed adoptions were NOT made to protect the birth parent’s privacy for all of time. At age 18, adoptees don’t need that legal protection anymore, so therefore why are the records kept sealed? 

Bottom line: age 18, adoption records should be opened. 

Now carry that thought over to DNA testing—those records too should be kept sealed until age 18, and children under 18 should NOT be tested (to protect their privacy as children, and to protect their right to choose for themselves whether or not to be tested and registered into the public system when they are old enough to handle the possible ramifications).

The BIGGER bottom line: NO children should be DNA tested until age 18, and only if THEY CHOOSE TO BE

Conclusion: 

DNA testing should be restricted to Adults age 18+ only, and require consent from the individual. Prevents parents (or whoever) from violating the innermost privacy of children. 

Every person has the right to know who they are and where they came from. Adults (age 18+) who were adopted should be granted full legal access to their own birth records, free and easy, if whenever they choose. 

Laws gotta change!"

AskReddit,fcmpnvp,t3_eb5o7t,1577786019.0,"18 hour plane ride, I found the person seated next to him and swapped seats pre-boarding. Touch down, landed.

Adding a little more to the story: 
We were on a college trip to Italy for the fall semester. I saw him in our pre-Italy summer classes and was curious. We actually grew up down the street back in our home towns, same high school, both our best friends even dated, but never met once. Inseparable for the trip. Dated for our college years. Later he pooped on my romanticized airplane story, saying all he wanted to do was sleep and this girl sits down and does NOT stop talking for 18 HOURS. whatever. First Love. And any beginning is supposed to drive ya crazy."
relationship_advice,f7nrktu,t1_f7ncx0f,1573913766.0,"If you tell them, you burst the bubble and that tension goes away. Same way as if you ACT on the crush and kiss them. Telling them is awkward for 30 seconds and then you laugh about it, and instead of a crush you feel silly and a little embarrassed—preferable to screwing up a real relationship. 

Obviously I had an experience with this, so it’s just my POV."
