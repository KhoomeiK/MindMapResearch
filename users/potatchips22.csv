casualiama,ferg3kg,t1_fercd79,1579353468.0,"I honestly hope you get the help you need.

Noone in their normal state of mind would feel aroused by someone who ruins their life, their familie's, the victim's and their family's and friend's, let alone thinks this way or it's okay to hurt someone.

I also hope someone fills the gap in you that's causing you to live your life in such darkness.

Hope you get well and you never hurt yourself or someone else."
casualiama,ferc9xa,t3_el7ba8,1579352320.0,You realize that just horrible right?
offmychest,fen37wf,t1_femzpjy,1579275975.0,"Thank you, I really dont know about that, I am adding no value to other lives, hell I am adding no value to mine, on top of that I might have hurt people more than I thought and not even aware of it."

family,febecmv,t3_eo6rd8,1578957981.0,"You're not an ass but I gotta say that being too close to ur mom especially a dude to pull something so close to her crotch is..weird... it really is, if people try to normalize it, doesnt mean it's normal, just pointing this out.
Still not an ass for not knowing any better, she wont be holding a grudge against u so no worries"
casualiama,fdoh8so,t1_fdmtepa,1578605102.0,"I said I'm sorry, but I feel like I should've said more.
I know it was your dad who got killed but revenge is not an answer, I suggest you pursue the criminal in a legal way so you dont ruin your life, the system wont see it as revenge and equal right but you will be seen for the rest of your life as a criminal as well.
I'm sorry for your loss my friend, I really hope you find peace in a legal way and have a good life.
Excuse my intervention."

Little did I know he made me feel even worse.
Once I cut him off, I slowly but surely healed and eventually found people who love me and care for me.
Dont believe you're not worth it just because the closest people to you said it."
offmychest,fd6rezx,t3_ek70kr,1578194792.0,I really hope you never act on it.

It sucks to feel that way, but it gets better, personally I learned not to feel like I needed that, I am learning to feel enough on my own for myself.
Take a shot everytime I said feel."

I just meant they could keep it clean not clean it, like refraining from throwing stuff everywhere and brushing their hair anywhere..stuff like that.
In fact m gonna get up in an hour to clean.."
offmychest,fcr9alq,t1_fcr6bd5,1577898635.0,"Ur answer shows how much  u didnt look into what m typing.
I clean but with exams and projects I cant get up.
I am talking about turning the house into a trash can and not even thinking it's wrong.
I clean, I actually am the one who takes care of the chores but even when I do the whole house turns right back into what it was.
I dunno abt u but I cant clean the toilet in 30 seconds."

I used to offer too much too and by being fucked up by each one of them especially my 10 year bff I learned to stop being too nice or generous and be careful before I give the next time.
We get into shit to learn."

But m better, m saying this to tell you that it gets better, be strong. Survive and leave where you are and start over, and someone will definitely fall in love with your smile one day.
Just believe it will happen and stay strong, it's okay to breakdown and feel pain, it only makes you human.
M here if you need to talk
Happy new year buddy"
RealScaryStories,fcl1pp1,t1_fckqrfa,1577737902.0,"Or,some things do exist and just because you have never experienced them doesnt mean they dont.
I take no drugs, got no traumas, I dont drink and I eat regular foods and go out and see the world like the others. So there's no way I am delusional, or the billions of people out there who experienced paranormal stuff.
Js, they do exist whether you believe it or not man"

If so try it to prevent any use on a different one that's not yours.
U cant really confirm since I'm not an active user tbh.
But you can try to contact ig's customer service.
Or try to post it on an ig subreddit if it exists.
Sorry I couldnt help much"

RealScaryStories,fccqmn1,t1_fcco3vm,1577601484.0,"Don't wanna freak you out but same thing is pretty common where I live.
My sister and many other people had experiences like that where they hear steps and murmurs sometimes even see shadows walking around.
Mom experienced sounds or people washing her dishes at midnight many times lol wish they wash mine tho.
I believe it was Jinn at ur place but I cant confirm ofc.
They dont hurt anyone since they are like humans trying to live a normal life.
They do go around in places where they have always lived though.
I know it all sounds unrealistic but I had experiences myself but we were taught since childhood about them so we dont fear them"
