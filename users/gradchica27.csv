GetMotivated,ff9rgl6,t1_ff987l3,1579719486.0,"Interesting—I’ll have to consider the rewards for eating well. Eating certain things definitely has an immediate negative effect on me (raging heartburn or stomach upset), but usually the bad after effect is removed enough it doesn’t compute (ie, eating a plate of nachos will result in water retention and bloating the next day, or obviously weight gain if I do it often enough, but it’s not quite as 1-1 as go to gym = feel good/accomplished”). 

The rewards are equally not as obvious (eat well = not feel bloated and sluggish, basically eat well = feel normal/not feel bad. Considering I see performance gains after eating a big cookie or carb meal, eating well doesn’t always translate into a better workout). Eating well also means (at this point) not gaining weight, which isn’t the reward that seeing a loss on the scale was. It takes sooooo long to recomp enough to see visible changes in how my clothes fit that it’s hard to tie that reward/goa o to whether or not to eat this cookie."
GetMotivated,ff93wmy,t1_ff8yrsk,1579704231.0,"Focused goals help me as well, but many times mine are time limited and when I achieve them I usually “lose” that discipline until I find a new goal (new motivation). I think I need to get away from goal/motivation mindset and put it on habit autopilot once I identify something I want to do. Like workouts—I have my spreadsheet with a year’s worth of workouts on it, I build my schedule to accommodate gym time, and then it’s just habit to go and do it. I need to figure out how to that with other things as well!"
GetMotivated,ff93kqd,t1_ff8ycjj,1579703998.0,"Agree about those more nebulous goals. I do well with shorter term goals—motivation is up, discipline supports it when motivation momentarily flags. 

Discipline is the habit that automatically kicks in—like I don’t think “am I motivated to make my bed today? Is this helping toward a bigger goal?” No, I just do it bc it’s a habit.  Do I sometimes oversleep and leave it unmade? Every so often, but discipline makes me make it midday or the next morning. This from the biggest teenage slob—I cultivated the discipline of making my bed and putting things away asap. 

I also think discipline is cultivated bc often someone is disciplined in one area of life but not every area. If you just had it, wouldn’t you be disciplined in everything? 

I am disciplined in my workouts. I am in the midst of the worst raging, energy sapping hormonal s*&t storm right now and I’ve been at the gym every day, following my program despite wanting to fall asleep on the couch. Yet, I’m currently eating like crap bc I haven’t cultivated discipline in that area as assiduously as I have in the gym. 

Last month I was crazy disciplined about my eating—bc I had the goal of rocking a backless dress at my cocktail party. Lost a few pounds, muscles popped, got raves on it. Fast forward a few days, short term goal over, “discipline” gone.  

Still working on that—need to think about what works to build/maintain my workout discipline (I’m never actually training for an event, just to be stronger and fitter) and how I can apply it to my eating habits."

So if it was an unplanned big meal (or day), just log it and go back to normal, it’s a blip in the long run. 

In terms of planning how you’ll deal with treat opportunities, it’s good to come up with a plan. 

I’m a work in progress here, but I try to make it a treat meal. Or two. But not a treat weekend of eating all the things. Esp for people with smaller deficits, that can wipe out a whole week’s worth of work (which gets demoralizing if you do it often enough and aren’t seeing any progress). So for ex on Saturday we were hosting a cocktail party—I knew I was going to eat appetizers , dessert and drink a few glasses of wine. So I ate normally or a bit lighter earlier in the day and enjoyed my evening. Same for Sunday—had a big salad for dinner bc I knew I was going to have two enormous chocolate chip cookies and hot chocolate for dessert...my trade off was not eating donuts that morning or a big dinner in addition to my treat.

Find one that aligns with your goals and run it all the way through. At least once. And then run another program. All beginners need to build a base of strength and get comfortable with the big lifts. 

I’ve been lifting for almost 4 years and I still follow programs written by professionals (so not some random insta celeb) bc they know way more than I do about building a balanced program that will progress at an appropriate pace.

As for dumbbells, can you finish the sets with 8lb dumbbells? When I’m in that in between stage (lower weight db too easy, next increment is too heavy to finish set), I will go to the higher one and do as many as I can. If I hit 8 out of 10 reps, great. If I do say 6 reps, I will either finish with the lower weight or rest 10-3 seconds and finish with the high weight. Each time I try to do more of the higher weight until I can do al rea with the higher weight. So I may start doing 4 @25lbs/6@20lbs, then the next time be able to do 5@25lbs/5@20lbs, and so on until I hit 10@25lbs."

Lifting is one of the few times we’re even somewhat “unplugged”—I’m wearing headphones, but I’m not staring at a screen. I’m plugged in to my own body, how my muscles feel, if anything is tight or painful, etc. you can’t “gamify” or VR heavy lifting without distracting the lifter from all those things.

xxfitness,feyg52w,t1_feya149,1579445051.0,"My suggestion would be it would be a good idea to start with one of the established programs. 

If price is the issue, you don’t need to be paying tons of $ for a beginner program. There are some books you can get used on amazon for $2–New Rules of Lifting for Women, for ex, or Strong Curves is $18 brand new,/$9 on Kindle. Thinner Leaner Stronger is $7 on Kindle. I only included those bc they’re some I’ve run myself. Sometimes TLS will go on sale for $0.99. So you can find a solid program that aligns with your goals for a very reasonable price. 

You’re paying the equivalent of a meal at Panera for someone’s expertise in designing and explaining a program that will get you the results you want—not a bad deal. 

Following a solid, established program (not something you buy off an Instagram person with zero credentials or track record of training people) takes out guesswork for you—you know it’s balanced, that you will make progress, that you aren’t overlooking something that will leave you with imbalances later. You’ll know when to change sets/reps, how and when to up weights, and have great cues/descriptions and photos of how to do the lifts. 

Running t least one or two beginner programs will give you the base you need."

That being said, If you’re a woman still getting monthly cycles, weight can fluctuate because of hormonal changes (esp around ovulation and right before you start your cycle). Salt and other food can result in overnight gains, as can missing a bowel movement or two. 

If overnight water retention bothers you, perhaps making a note of where you are in your cycle or what you ate the day before might alleviate some stress. When I see a big overnight gain, then look at the calendar and see indeed I’ll be starting my cycle in two days, I don’t freak out bc I know what is causing it (hormones) and that it’ll be gone quickly. 

In the week or so I’ve had two separate days when I’ve gained 2.5lbs overnight. Clearly it wasn’t fat—one was ovulation bloat and the second was a big salty meal. Took about 4 days for all of that to go away, but I drank a lot of water and tried to be patient and it did."

Also, are you measuring out your alcohol? And tracking your meals out as best you can? I will look up info online and if I can’t for that restaurant I will choose a similar dish from another restaurant.

Now is the time to nip it in the bud. I’m totally saying this to myself as well. 

My motivation is way down, and I am telling myself a good part of this badness is water. And it is—I didn’t gain 2.5lbs of fat literally overnight, twice in the same week, and once the week before. I mean, 7.5 lbs between Christmas morning and Monday? I ate a lot, but not that much. Ugh.

 I started out as a runner. Does this mean I could run far, or fast? No and no. I was a fat, un athletic kid, so I had never thought of myself as an athlete. I worked up from running 1 minute to running 1 minute 10 seconds, etc. once I could slowly run for 20ish minutes, I would try and bump up my speed by .1mph for a minute, then a minute 30, etc. started the same with lifting, years later. Lifting lighter dumbbells then gradually building up. 

Now, it wasn’t really the exercise that lost the weight or kept it off. It was seeing myself as an athlete. I started viewing the activity as a hobby, not a chore, and practice and consistency makes perfect in all hobbies. I also started eating to fue my activity. I would notice if feel awful during a run after eating fried food earlier that day—ugh, the stomach and side pains!—so I would gradually phase that out as my full brain started to make the connection. I began to notice veggies and eggs equated to feeling energized and motivated for my workout, so that replaced some really overly carb heavy or greasy meals. This took a while, with continual forgetting that a giant bowl of ice cream makes me feel like death.

Seeing myself as an athlete changed my food and recovery behavior. I would think, runners take a rest day, so I will walk today and not overdo it, or runners eat to keep themselves healthy and fuel their workouts, so I can’t starve myself or I won’t make it through my run, but I probably don’t need another slab of cake either, since that will make me gassy and bloated for my run. 

Related to seeing myself as an athlete, I kept training logs and followed training plans (for running and lifting). In the beginning it was a calendar I would X for workout days and write how long I ran for. Now it’s a google spreadsheet with my lifts and numbers. Seeing that calendar with Xs kept me motivated! 

Consistency is key, as is not burning out. Opening my spreadsheet (or the running plan I used t print out back in the day) shows me what to do today (so no decision fatigue over “do I feel like it? What do I feel like doing? Bc that would usually be “nope, nothing” at first).

Then two weeks later he’ll ask if we still have those Oreos. Um, no, no we don’t. Either I ate them all or they’re so far down under the deer meat in the outside freezer I can’t be bothered to freeze my fingers off digging for them."

loseit,fd2nqxf,t3_ejx9gf,1578149836.0,"Okay, I get you, I was a chubby kid who started to hit “fat” around 11, my parents were obese, brother chubby too. It stinks. 

So if you hate being fat, what are you going to do about it? My suggestion is find stuff you do like and focus on that instead of what you hate. Hate will only get you so far and won’t sustain you when progress is slow. 

What do I mean?  Find healthy foods you like. Try things until you find some things you enjoy (or at least don’t hate). You may need your parents for this part of there is no healthy food in the house, so do you think they’d be on board? 

Find some activity you don’t hate. Pop on some headphones and go for a walk. Dance. Swim. Whatever you can do.  Record what you do so you can see your fitness improving (you could walk 10 min last week, now it’s 12. Or you walked 10 blocks in X min, now you walk 11 in the same time). Seeing improvements really helped me, even if they were small. 

As a late elementary student and again in my teens, I kept a log of my food and activities. Back then it was paper and pen, just portion size and minutes of activity and that helped me lose the weight to become a normal/healthy weight. Now I use apps for the same purpose. 

You can do this."

fatlogic,fd2a6k5,t3_ejmji3,1578144128.0,"Kids don’t just get born fat like they get born with curly hair or blue eyes or whatever. I could say, “If my kids have brown hair like me/have curly hair like me/stick their tongues out when they concentrate like me I’ll celebrate how they’re like me” but I wouldn’t say “If my kids end up liking fantasy novels and history like I do I’ll celebrate how they’re like me!”  I mean, that would be awesome, but I would be contributing to that outcome with the environment and training and feedback I provide. They didn’t come out of the womb loving history, I would be encouraging it. 

Same with obesity, kids don’t just come out fat. Well, I guess you could say my 2nd did (11 lbs!), but our environment of generally healthy eating habits and encouraging active over passive pursuits (hardly any tv, no tech) means at age 8 he is a heathy 80th percentile for height/weight and a great athlete. So celebrating that your kids are fat like you is celebrating YOU bc you encouraged that outcome.

ETA: when my son was born that big, they were worried something was wrong with him—he got tested for diabetes and some other things right away bc being a big fat baby is not normal."

Most of the time I’m not even buzzed, but I’ll notice that indeed, I did have 4 glasses over the course of a party (4-6 hours). Which usually leads to eating things I didn’t plan on. Bah. And the sugar was crazy the last two weeks! Need to kick that too. 

I have 2 events I’m hosting this month where I’ll drink (cocktails and dance party, that’s going to happen!), but I’ll leave it alone the rest of the month. It’s the slow going through a bottle during the week that needs to stop. Husband will be giving up alcohol later this month for a while as well, so that should help!"

I’m fitter now in my late 30s with 4 kids than I was throughout my 20s when I was single. Sometimes having to plan your exercise time so you can enjoy time with husband or kids makes it actually happen (as opposed to doing it when you feel like it...which for me ended up being after I did everything else..so never).

loseit,fc5h7ev,t3_eg89c1,1577457503.0,"I’m 5’4”, maintenance pre babies was 135. Got up to 200, 190, 170, and 200 with each pregnancy. Got back down to 135 each time (now 125) while breastfeeding (nurses each for 12-18 mo). 

So, your mileage may vary, but what worked for me was following a 3 stage plan:

Stage 1–the first 3 months: basically eat what I wanted, some attempt to limit junk food. Nurse all the dang time to establish a good supply and good nursing habits for baby. Wear stretchy pants. 

Stage 2–4-8 months. nursing fully established, no more engorgement, starting to see a feeding pattern (instead of constantly, feedings start to naturally space out a bit). Start experimenting with light exercise (walking, elliptical) and calorie counting. I added in extra for nursing so I started with about 2000 and added/subtracted 100 based on loss/gain AND (most importantly!) baby—is he seeming more fussy/not satisfied? Is eating more often for more than a 1-2 day growth spurt window? If so, up calories. 

Stage 3: 8-12+ months—baby is eating solids, nursing declining in frequency. I begin lowering calories—usually start this period at about 1800, end around 1600ish when I’m ready to wean. I’m exercising normally, by about 8/9 months pp I’m back to more intense exercise, eating back exercise calories. 

Now, this worked for me (obviously was trial and error, not so systematic with the first two pregnancies), might not for you. First order of business is always baby’s health , weight loss takes a backseat. I never noticed much of a help on losing from nursing, but I did notice reduced milk production when I was too aggressive too early (so worst of all worlds!) and it was frustrating, but...well, that’s motherhood"

So I lose (& maintain) by weighing and logging my food with a digital kitchen scale and my trusty MFP app. If I try to put exercise my eating, I fail (& injure myself). If I try to just kinda guesstimate “healthy” foods, I at best maintain, usually slowly gain. The only thing that works is the sober counting and facing how much I’m actually eating. Being honest with myself makes it easier to say no to what won’t fit in my budget."

I also don’t eat meat, so it is not a problem to say no if I make them meat based dishes, but if your bf makes his own meals, then make yours, or fill most of your plate with veggies so you can sit and eat with him without staring across your empty plate to his."
xxfitness,fc5esd5,t3_egavxu,1577455461.0,"You look fabulous! I am also leaning towards thinking your legs might be naturally where you store your weight—has this usually been your shape? We can change our shape somewhat with lifting—adding muscle to certain places, “neglecting” others we don’t want to emphasize, but there are some things we can’t change (or maybe we can over many years, but not short term—I’m thinking where we store fat won’t change, though we can reduce the amount, and how wide our hips are won’t change, though we can reduce the padding). 

So the question becomes fight your shape and be constantly frustrated or unhappy, or embrace it and work to make it as awesome as possible?

I too have bigger thighs (smaller hips and booty, just gargantuan thighs), despite being 10lbs lighter and fat more muscular than I’ve ever been. I had to give up my dream of willowy thin legs, but instead figured if my thighs were going to be big, I’d make them as muscular & as non-jiggly as possible. So far this has resulted in making them smaller and more muscular, even if they remain proportionally larger."

fatlogic,fc09wir,t1_fbztrzv,1577284395.0,"I think you are using “absolute fast” or “dry fast” as your definition, when that is a partial definition of fasting. Fasting encompasses more than just a dry/absolute fast (it has traditionally encompassed partial fasting/fasting from certain food or drink, and just looking up “fasting” brings up both the partial and full fast as legitimate definitions). So if what you personally consider fasting is only dry/absolute fasting, that’s fine, but the lie is another legitimate definition in common use."

loseit,fbzmqgd,t3_efc5zh,1577252039.0,"Some more dinner ideas—if grandma babysits at your house, you could prep meat for the sous vide (so put the meat and spices in the special bag and leave it in the fridge. Get your pot filled with water and set the temp on your sous vide, just don’t turn it on. Ask grandma to clip bag to pot at X time and press “on”, or you can do it through an app) and put potatoes/sweet potatoes in the oven (ask grandma to turn oven on at X time, or set it to start on its own if you can). Then all you need to do is make a quick veggie and dinner is ready!  The meat options here are nearly limitless, and lean cuts like chicken breasts turn out great. 

Definitely portion control is huge—use smaller salad plates for your daughter (and maybe you), and look up appropriate serving size for her age. Talk about how certain foods help her grow, how other foods are fun foods to eat sometimes, but don’t give her the vitamins and nutrients she needs to grow, so we don’t eat them all the time.  I talk with my boys (oldest is 10, youngest is 4) about food like this, often using their sports goals to help (ie, they want more muscle to run faster or to help them climb, so they need protein, etc)."
