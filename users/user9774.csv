realestateinvesting,fdhmrmh,t3_elg9an,1578425949.0,"I‚Äôve bought many foreclosed homes at auctions. A few reasons why many people who are new to the game can‚Äôt make it happen is because:

1) It takes a lot of time. To buy one house you need to do research, visit all of the homes, go to the auctions daily. The properties listed sometimes don‚Äôt sell at all, some take months or even years before a sale is closed. This is due to many postponements which occur.

2) You can‚Äôt inspect every home that‚Äôs listed, so your not sure the condition of the home your buying. Sometimes the previous owners mess up the house on purpose or like others say; steal plumbing or anything else of value. 

3) New investors underestimate rehab costs and run into problems which greatly increases costs. If your not doing the repairs yourself or if you don‚Äôt have a full time construction crew working for you it will be a lot harder for you to make profit because the big players have ready to go construction crews on payroll compared to hiring out independent contractors to do the work for you. Also they save a lot of time because of that as well. Let‚Äôs say you do it yourself to save money, the additional time you spend rehabbing costs money because of holding costs. 

4) The time it takes to fix and flip a home is important too. The big players have realtors on payroll which saves time and money. If you give it to a realtor who takes a while for it to sell and then takes a big percentage for selling it, your loosing money.

selfimprovement,fdd72e7,t3_ekqsaz,1578297681.0,"First off be grateful for what you have. Make a list of the things you appreciate. 

Second do the best you can in every situation. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are bagging groceries or a corporate lawyer. Do more then your asked for and you will eventually receive more then your getting paid for. Come in earlier to work, help out more customers, see if your manager needs an extra hand. Have a great time at work, smile more, make some jokes with the customers and enjoy your time every you are. Make it fun!

Third understand how we feel essentially comes down to simple chemistry in our brains. To enhance how you feel you need to eat more vitalizing/healthy foods (more raw food like fruits, vegetables, nuts) salads, beans etc.
Start working out every day. Hit the weights consistently and you will feel a direct Impact on how you feel because exercise releases chemicals in our brain to make us feel better. 
Add herbal supplements like St. John wort, 5HTP and some others.

Forth, get great rest make sure you are sleeping full 8 hours of uninterrupted rest. 

5th, try to keep your mind focused more on the positive through out your day. Make a list of the goals you want and work toward them. Make a vision board. 

6th, find new hobbies/interest and start educating hour self and immersing your self in then. Also find a good group of friends to hang out with. If you have toxic friends remove them and replace them with good people. As far as finding a new job or career, look at interests you and go forward with in that direction. If you need to go to university do it, if you need capital investment for a business ask around and start saving. Analyze and act on it. 

7th, I understand you care about your mom but she is an adult herself and you need to drop it. You can let her know a few times about how you feel but ultimately it‚Äôs up to her. Don‚Äôt let other people change how you feel inside.

Also I would recommend to start watching some comedy shows, stand up to cheer yourself up a bit more. Try to laugh more and enjoy the time you have on this planet."
AskMen,fdd67i4,t3_ekji9o,1578296569.0,"Yea that‚Äôs right I switch it up

It‚Äôs not a competition of how many things you can do or complete after work just enjoy yourself and do what‚Äôs available. Be spontaneous; a friend calls you after work and go hang out with him. If you have extra energy and feel like exploring go for a rejuvenating and relaxing hike. Maybe you want to learn a new instrument. It‚Äôs great to try/learn new things."
AskMen,fdbsub5,t3_ekji9o,1578261504.0,"I like to read and learn about new topics that interest me. For example business/finance/marketing/health. 

Play video games; Nintendo switch or call of duty 

Spend time with my kids, take them places teach them new things 

Go hiking and visit new places I haven‚Äôt been before. There is an app that will tell you cool locations nearby. Also go eat at different restaurants, do a nice BBQ, or crab legs.

Take photos as a hobby 

Make music and music videos 

Hang out with friends"

selfimprovement,fcd10ft,t1_fcbe8mi,1577605026.0,"The way I see it is it‚Äôs for the better. Your life is making room for improvements. You need to get rid of the old to have space for the new. 

If your girl can‚Äôt handle you at your worst she can‚Äôt handle you at your best. Find a better partner who you can be open with and both of you can keep each other going during bad times and enjoy the great times. 

Find some friends or even coworkers to spend New Years. If not that go to a bar or gathering  you would be surprised and you might even might some great new people. Just remember to keep an open mind and enjoy yourself let loose and have some drinks. 

It‚Äôs okay to be depressed there is nothing wrong with you. Your not alone and everyone goes through it. Remember you have the power to change it. Add some weight lifting/exercise, spend some time in nature that naturally energizes, drink fresh fruit/vegetable juices, drink herbs like St. John wort, 5HTP, get good nights rest (before bed drink some chamomile/valerian/passionflower/licorice root tea). 

Peace love and joy to you"

realestateinvesting,fcczslp,t3_egyjxh,1577604603.0,"They do take a chunk.

ReefTank,fccyzy7,t1_fc02aow,1577604338.0,"That‚Äôs why you didn‚Äôt have a clean up crew 
You got to Have some Nasarius snails hermits brittle sea star etc. 
also it‚Äôs great to have a mix of fish if possible
Clowns are lazy slow eaters if you have a damse or a six line wrasse they usually will help eat what the clowns don‚Äôt"
taoism,fccvo93,t3_egzq31,1577603202.0,"Do an activity such as cleaning your room/office and get in the zone of it. Remember that you have been through worse and with time it will pass and you will feel better. Let your thoughts about life come and do like clouds. The thoughts themselves have no power, you are the one who gives them power.

A few other things that will help you tremendously:
Different types of exercise 
Spending time in nature 
Deep breathing try the wolf method 
Drink fresh squeezed juice 
Eat healthy life abiding food 
Herbs such as ashwaganda/valerian/licorice 
Have a full nights rest (drink a sleeping aid if needed) 
If your family has kids/toddlers play and hang out with them they are always positive 
Meet with friends 
Express how you feel to a significant other 

Peace love and joy to you"

ReefTank,fc0lxup,t3_efcld9,1577294135.0,That could be the problem you needed some bottom feeders/clean up crew. Nassarius snails/shrimp/hermits they would pick up the food the clowns didn‚Äôt catch. This wouldn‚Äôt give a chance for the worms to eat any excess food.
ReefTank,fbzzbux,t1_fbzxto9,1577270041.0,Maybe it happened because you were over feeding?
