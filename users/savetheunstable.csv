Food can vary a lot, especially if you're a tourist. I traveled with some native Indians who knew to avoid those places. Meals were nowhere near 2000 INR, that's nuts. You can eat well for a couple of dollars a day.  Also I still have an Uber receipt that came to $1.90 U.S. I did not use other forms for paid transit.
