socialanxiety,fcwtgn6,t3_ejazjf,1578036924.0,"I’ve had the same thing for a while. I started just saying “yes I think so too” or “thank you” or “how nice of you to say”. Sometimes a smile or a nod is enough as a reaction. Maybe you can practice with someone you trust and like or with a mirror. 
Good luck and I hope u have a nice day"
Rowing,ee2eia2,t3_afykwo,1547494050.0,"pls keep the following in mind when you come to catch:

arms, back, legs

When you kick out it's, legs -> back -> arms. Also try standing on your toes, this way you can apply more pressure"
