AmItheAsshole,ff6dx9w,t1_ff3gr7b,1579625089.0,"I definitely find it crazy overprotective -- literally what's the rationale behind saying no? I had parents who refused to let me get my ears pierced. We used to get into screaming matches because I'd save change to buy nail polish and they'd force me into the bathroom until I took it off. I'm not going to assume anything here, but if OP's daughter is excited to do girl stuff, what's wrong with getting piercings? My parents used to tell me that they'd get infected, that I was too young to wear earrings and care about my appearance, etc. But my older sister took me for my 13th birthday without telling them and once they got over themselves the next day, they forgot about it for the next 10 years because they're literally just earholes that sit there and do nothing."
UofT,ff5f428,t3_er6ki0,1579590150.0,What college are you registered with? Not sure if this helps but Trin has a room that nonresidence Trin students can rent for $20 a night if you ever just really need a door and a bed. And I think they rent lockers too.
worldnews,ff3rwjy,t1_ff3q6qy,1579547528.0,"OP: I live in Russia and this is what it's like for Russian people. 

You: Actually I know exactly one Russian guy and he's not like that, so you're wrong (""anecdotally"")."
movies,ff21bez,t3_egox17,1579491136.0,"This thread is old, but you should definitely watch Get Out. It's a genre defying amazingly well made film."
movies,ff1yzu0,t1_fdu7eij,1579489452.0,It's not subtitled in the theatre release for some reason but the ending credit song is the son singing about how it's going to take 564 years of labour to buy the house. So yes it's meant to communicate that it's a futile dream
movies,ff1ymtc,t1_fe8ql9q,1579489197.0,Remember when JLaw was Reddit's darling? And then her nudes got leaked and everyone looked at them against her wishes & now she's ended up as Reddit's enemy. What a time.
anime,fezw4w7,t1_fezspr0,1579462428.0,"Assuming OP's not trolling, why would understanding yourself better/accepting yourself not be a positive thing?"
toronto,fetmqg4,t1_fescmoh,1579376946.0,"The Dupont bus is heavily dependent on traffic (ie Dupont gets really bad at rush hour and is fine most other times) and recently has gotten way fuller around the Lansdowne area, so I can only imagine that they'll have to add more busses to service the route once the Dufferin buildings are built, because the bus goes to St George & around rush hour it's usually standing room only after passing Ossington (& much worse on the way home from St George going west)"

AmItheAsshole,fdmnkrt,t1_fdmmcyr,1578556919.0,"Lol reddit relationship analysis classic... how is wanting to sleep together even occasionally, controlling?"
AmItheAsshole,fdmn6u5,t3_em1u97,1578556439.0,"YTA for shutting down others' earnest attempts to get to know you. You can definitely give a short answer even if it's confusing and if they want to know more they'll ask, or otherwise they'll just say it's cool and move on. I do think your girlfriend could be overreacting about it because she wants people to like you & it's probably not a big deal whatsoever. But in the future you should give people a chance to try to understand you instead of shutting them out without a second thought."
anime,fdfrlt4,t1_fddfgwq,1578368499.0,"I think Fire Force is enjoyable for the worldbuilding & the visuals, but the story + writing is nothing special & the first half of the show doesn't do a good job with things like comedy (fanservice wtf) & some characters (Hibana fight wtf)."
anime,fdfqzgy,t1_fddmhs2,1578368080.0,"Hahaha I actually muted and/or skipped over all of Zenitsu's long, unnecessary rants and freakouts. I do think there's a lot of potential there with a weak-spirited character learning to do his best, but... god... he's so irritating. I do think the show is worth watching & if you just mute it every time Zenitsu starts flipping out and/or skip over those parts it makes everything way more enjoyable."
anime,fcyzyh0,t3_ejksv6,1578090828.0,"I already started rewatching this series a while ago but didn't end up finishing it -- I'll be happy to rewatch from the start, this time alongside everyone else!"
anime,fcv4vfw,t1_fcuqazr,1577994694.0,"I would recommend either a Miyazaki movie (Spirited Away & Princess Mononoke are my personal favourites) or something visually striking and plot-driven, such as Violet Evergarden or Psychopass s1. 

I'm a big fan of anime but as a woman it can get tiring having to sit through fanservice in show after show; I love when series don't need to rely on fanservice to have great content, though by now I've seen so much that I don't even bat an eye at it anymore. Still, no fanservice > fanservice to me, and I kind of understand where your girlfriend is coming from. Hope this helps!"
anime,fcv3o9x,t1_fcuqrp7,1577993985.0,Is that the one where they go to Tokyo? You're right in the midst of my personal favourite part of the series!! CCS is definitely a kids show but is still an incredibly good piece of work.
torontoraptors,fcl1153,t1_fckht9r,1577737480.0,My money is on Lowry!
anime,fckr2n5,t3_ehdf55,1577731354.0,"I actually think the flashback episode of Fire Force (I think it was 15?) was truly great. Crazy to think that this is the same show that made the Hibana episodes, which I found to be really bad."
anime,fcgruix,t1_fcgngh5,1577643449.0,"Seconded! I watched this after watching Haikyuu and feeling like I wanted more of that, & ended up enjoying this anime too."
anime,fcgrmo9,t3_eh2c0l,1577643369.0,"I think the second half was much stronger than the first. There were some weird episodes around 5-10 if i'm remembering right, like the Hibana ""fight"" & weird pacing of Tamaki fanservice, but I've really liked the direction in the second half & the way they've been laying out the story. In my opinion it's worth it to finish."

cats,fc3b5ek,t1_fc357ok,1577385866.0,"I'm just impressed they can recognize pickles + mayo being taken out of the fridge as the ""trigger"" for tuna! Like all I have to do is close the fridge door while holding those two jars and they'll sprint across the apartment. I have no idea how they can distinguish the specific sounds, but it's really impressive!"
cats,fc30m66,t1_fc2rms4,1577378736.0,"I usually only open canned tuna when I'm making tuna salad, which I put pickles and mayo in. I also don't ever otherwise chop pickles... my cats have literally begun to recognize the act of me CHOPPING PICKLES & will now sprint to the kitchen & start mewing as soon as I bust out the mayo and pickle jars."
cats,fc30g5m,t1_fc2xwnm,1577378629.0,"hahaha, mine too! I've taken to offering them all opened non-tuna canned foods to sniff for approval so they know I'm not depriving them ðŸ˜›"
nottheonion,fc23f00,t1_fc20r00,1577338823.0,"Just because others have done egregiously worse things doesn't mean this isn't also dirty -- we should be holding politicians to a high standard. I think we can also consider pretty much every move they make (and often, also the ones the don't) to be strategic, and it's currently less than a week until the end of Q4 & he's literally holding a contest for low donations. If this were ""clean"" politics so to speak, wouldn't he be addressing the general wealth divide issue by... actually addressing the issue?"
terracehouse,fbaiie8,t1_fbaig2u,1576679071.0,I looked at the photoset on instagram and I really don't think it's her -- the face is clear in the third photo and she looks totally different
