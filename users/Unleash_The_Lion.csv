Doomers,ff3wez2,t3_erifzf,1579550321.0,"Not an American book but I read The Buried Giant by Kazuo Ishiguro. A hauting good book about a old couple suffering from amnesia, trying to find their son, which they feel sure about having from past remembrances. 
My favourite quote is: ""A couple may claim to be bonded by love, but we boatmen may see instead resentment, anger, even hatred. 
Or a great barrenness. 
Sometimes a fear of loneliness and nothing more. 
Abiding love that has endured the years
- that we see only rarely."""
depression,fex2jws,t3_eqttda,1579423255.0,"If you're dead, then there is nothing. The dark. Maybe the unknown. But if you're alive there's definitely the unknown. And that's not bad or scary. It is great being alive, even though life's not only a happy strawberry field. Hard times create the strongest people to face the earth and I believe that everyone who struggles with depression or having the roughest years, either behind them or in front of them, will be one day one tough motherfucker. It seems like a never-ending, dark tunnel, but you always see the light. Where there's a light, there's hope, remember that."
depression,fex017b,t1_fenf1du,1579422119.0,"There is a day tomorrow too. Only because it is a slow process you make doesn't mean it is not a process at all. I also started slowly with my ""achievements"" journey. One day, I was laying in bed being in an existential crisis. Then a thought came out of nowhere: ""lets just do something crazy"". Then I did 5 pushups and then I was dead. I laid after that in my bed and I was feeling better, even smiled. 
Crush this demon with a sense of creativity and craziness, it seems insane at the first moment but then you give your brain a distraction. A positive one. I don't know if that helps at all since I am not a motivational speaker or anything like this but all I can say is: You're not alone, we have to hold together as a community."
depression,femo3mv,t3_epw70l,1579264342.0,Some people think it is a sign of weakness what is completely nonsense. In my opinion it is even a sign of courage if you're talking about this rather sensitive topic. Remember you are strong and loved by this community!

Doomers,femko36,t3_epu0ke,1579260355.0,"The doomer mindset definitely leaves scars and a black hole in the heart and soul. Its been like 2 years since I started working out, eating healthy, becoming more disciplined, reading books, overcoming my pornography addiction etc. But even after a ""good"" day of doing healthy habits and socialising, I still feel not right. Its like the sparkling stars that filled the black hole are beginning to fade away. Everyday I try to create more of these stars but somehow even after doing 100 pushups, running 15km or getting good grades, this life leaves me in this depressed mindset. I think your question is subjective to every individual on this planet. Some escape and forget it, some just escape it, some can't. In the end hope is all we can hope for."
