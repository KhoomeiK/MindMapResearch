I wouldn't expect festival goers to show up with the gear and patience to bypass or pick a decent-quality code lock in order to use a toilet. 

Are you able to post photos of the locks, toilets (especially around the door/locking mechanisms) and/or of any damage from last time? This would really help with rallying suggestions from the community.

PS, many thanks for your efforts to make festivals more accessible."

germany,ff8dx1x,t3_es687a,1579674427.0,"Bavaria is a big state with some pretty strong geographical differences in terms of regional identity. In Franconia, for example, one is less likely to self-identify as Bavarian, rather as Franconian. This is likely due to divergent historical, social, linguistic, religious, and political trajectories.

There are stronger similarities, as one might expect, between South-Eastern Bavaria and Western Austria. Eastern Austria is an entirely different story, as is Tirol.

A lot has changed in Bavaria in recent decades, including more and more cultural integration with the rest of Germany, Europe, and the world. The concept of local identity is, overall, not growing stronger, rather weaker. Of course there are some exceptions.

The independence/separatist movement is not nearly as strong as one might expect. I see no sign of it, aside from the occasional social media post. I think the Adenauer will be flying here for some time to come."

It seems to me that, along these lines, a person's objection to involvement in Afghanistan should not then be interpreted as a ""live and let die"" apathy towards the suffering of the less affluent in the region, rather, that there is a total distrust in the ability of NATO and its allies in nation-building, e.g., due to a lack of political will among the electorate and inability to conduct and execute long-term strategic plans on humanitarian grounds. Is this a fair interpretation?

I volunteered to fight in Afghanistan after hearing horrific stories from friends back from deployment; the degree of sickening inhumanity had never been communicated in the popular media in my country. Nobody knew just what the Taliban were doing, except that they didn't want girls to go to school.
