China,ffdfznm,t1_ffd9z2p,1579820080.0,"this sub is pro china. Its just not pro-chinese government.  
It is in the best interest of the common chinese civilian to dismantle the government who is attempting on everey level to control and pupeteer the populace. China is not a country you would want to live in if you want to live happy and peacefully.  


tl;dr pro china and pro government are two very different ideas"
