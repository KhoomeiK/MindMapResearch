depression,ffapnru,t3_esbfsf,1579741553.0,"No, don't do it and fucking listen to me for a second.

No matter how hard it sometimes gets, and trust me I've been there too, it will eventually get better. There is always an up after every down.

My best advice for you: If you KNOW what fucks your life up, for example: I had a job I really hated, stressed me extremely out, made me feel worthless and I did it all because I had to meet expectations- just don't even think about it for long and just go ahead and say ""FUCK THIS. I dont wanna do this anymore, this is bad for me. I'm in a bad mental and physical state, this has to stop."", then just fucking do it. That is the BEST thing you can do.

Just take a 6-month break from.. hell, everything. Until you feel better and you feel like you can actually try again. Start putting yourself first for once. Just tell everyone to fuck off that puts pressure on you. If they love you they will understand it.

But.. just please dont end it. Try to think about what you will potentially miss out on in the future. Upcoming movies, games, inventions, etc. etc.

Please promise not to do it. Especially dont hang yourself, that is extremely painful and takes 3-5 minutes before you're actually unconcious."

He kept joking and saying ""the meeting is just for formality, you're pretty much hired already"" and it was true. As soon as I showed up to the interview and they heard my name, we pretty much just talked for 5 minutes and then we made the contract.

I absolutely hate that feeling, thats why I generally try to avoid people, and dont talk much.  Heck, if you dont say anything, I'll probably just say ""Hello"", do my business and leave.

depression,ff2l6u2,t3_eqy6qi,1579511321.0,"This analogy is perfect and exactly describes what it feels like to do even the simplest task.

When the task gets assigned to you, you're enraged first, thinking ""no, please, why do I have to endure this""

You feel like a lazy piece of shit for thinking that and think you probably deserve to be in the state you are.

Then you do the task even if you hate doing it. Because if you disappoint anyone, that just proves them all right.

And after you're done you feel worse than before because you ponder ""why am I struggling with even the simplest shit, why do I never get credited for what I do. Oh well, im stupid, its obviously because what I did was basically nothing. I dont deserve any praise.""

Its a cycle of self-hatred that never ends and pulls you deeper into the muddy swamp of depression every single time until you feel like you're drowning in it. All the while people are just walking around the swamp and ignoring that you need help. And all you do is wish that someone would reach out for you. But why would anyone do that?

They see you as a dumb idiot for choosing to walk through the mud, but they dont understand that you didnt choose to do it, but rather, that you were pushed into it and cant get out alone.

They ask why you dont ask for help. But they dont understand that every time you try to open your mouth, the mud starts filling your lungs and keeps you from talking. Depression silences you and makes you feel like an even bigger idiot because you cant build up the courage to even try and speak to anyone about it.

I could go on and on, but you get it.

TL;DR Depression is like a muddy swamp that everyone else can just walk around while ignoring that you fell into it."

Its a reminder that you exist, but that that is all you do- exist. You dont serve any purpose, you play no role in anyones life besides those people that had to endure you on a daily basis for the longest time anyways.

And one thing you said was extremely relatable to me: That I wouldnt like myself if I met me. Heck, its not even a question of ""if"", I DO NOT like myself."
