For a cancer patient, the pet scan may be most important. For a trauma, you may want an X-ray to see if skull is fractured and a ct/mri to see soft tissue damage.

An MRA may be most important if you suspect a clot or a possible aneurysm."

It was really nice to be able to easily communicate with co-workers that easy especially because  it was just around my neck and hands off. I think it’s a great tool because as a CNA I remember I would be slammed with a big trauma or hands deep in some dirty stuff and could easily call someone to come help me. The only downside was that the batteries would die pretty easily. I used it back in 2014 so I imagine they have improved some of those things. 

Compared to phones they are much better because it just hangs around your neck so no way to really lose it. The hospital I work in now doesn’t have anything like that so I definitely miss it.

I have made it a habit to have my “unexpected category” with about $2-300 in it just to cover those random things. I don’t want that stuff to tap into my emergency fun but I understand how frustrating it is. 

After 3-4 months I think that category has like $300 in it and it’s nice because most of the money is from overflow categories like you said. If my utilities fluctuate then any extra goes into that category which is a nice cushion.

The beauty is being able to see the average spending over time. I was budgeting $100 for gas each month but YNAB shows me that I only use ~$80 so I just take that extra 20 and put it into unexpected. Stuff like that where you can visually see the amount is what makes me love YNAB."

More of a patient care focused. Idk just different. 

I work in a hospital where NPs and PAs function essentially the same so it just depends what you want to do. I just don’t think there is a RN vs PA because one is a provider who decides the care plan of patients and the other is not."

physicianassistant,fet2edz,t1_fesyyz0,1579371202.0,"No and honestly a lot of states have laws that the scope is determined by the supervising physician so my autonomy at the hospital I work at is basically anything I want or think is right to do. We definitely communicate but I don’t have to text my attending every time I want to change meds or change a care plan. Most admissions I take I put all the orders in anyway and my attending may tweak some things if need.

Autonomy is a spectrum and I think some people think it’s a 0% or 100% which is so far from the truth. I’m sure outpatient work is different. 

Maybe it’s because the practice I work in does allow midlevels to do a lot but I’m not sure why this push for independence is so strong. If you wanted to do that then why didn’t you go to medical school? Idk I’m happy being a PA and it is fulfilling what I wanted to do as a provider."

physicianassistant,fesx9ca,t1_fesu550,1579369858.0,"The difference is most threads like that aren’t professional discussions. 95% of them are burnt out Med students or residents who haven’t truly grasped what the healthcare team means. If midlevels weren’t valuable then the profession wouldn’t have lasted 50+ years and voted consistently as one of the top careers to have. Don’t worry about it. Once you start working with older docs everyone wants the same thing and that’s good patient care.

That being said, I do agree that NPs who are pushing for this working independently stuff is out of their league and causing this generalization that all midlevels think they don’t need doctors. That is not what our professions were designed for and there are a lot of physicians who are threatened/mad about that.

Sadly, I have dealt with the question “why didn’t you just go to Med school?” And you will too as well as every PA. There will always be someone who doesn’t understand and unfortunately if that’s not something that you want to deal with then I’d say go to Med school."

Some will agree with it and some won’t. How will that help you ? 

To answer: yes there should be midlevels. They function how they should now by working under supervising physicians. They will never replace doctors but the professions were literally created to alleviate the volume of patients that doctors see. Some say they are helpful and some say they don’t."

And you could argue that having bad MDs is far more dangerous since anything midlevels do is or should be checked up by a doctor so if it’s missed then sure it looks bad on the midlevel but the doctor is in trouble if he doesn’t catch it.

Plus, all the older more experienced MDs don’t give a shit. If good patient care is occurring then they don’t care about any of this. It’s the young ones who have a problem because they are 3-4 years in with absolutely ZERO light at the end of the tunnel. 🤷🏻‍♂️"

If severe enough, the patient may need a liver transplant or a portosystemic shunt which would bypass the blockage allowing blood to flow as normal. Pretty crazy.

My other two were CT surgery and orthopedic surgery. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to do surgery so I chose to do two surgery rotations to understand if the OR life was for me. Ortho was fun because they were short procedures, lots of office procedures like steroid injections, and overall a great rotation. CT surgery wasn’t that fun.

ynab,fe8rop1,t3_eo5knn,1578929846.0,"I believe Nick True says there is a couple options.

For example, if I have $3000 in my savings right now, each month if I plan to want to save $500 then I will budget that amount to that category then I will simply do a transfer transaction from checking to savings in YNAB so that my checking account then reflects what I actually have to budget/spend. Just make sure you physically do the transfer in your bank account as well. Then I just use the rollover method for that one category line in my budget. I like this way because it allows me to see everything I have without throwing off my day to day spending. It also allows me to see what I am able to save month to month.

For you, if you add an account of $2000 dollars then if it goes to your TBB then go ahead and budget that amount to your Savings category since those dollars already have a job.

There may be easier ways to do it but I like it because I can see every dollar I own in YNAB.

It’s usually an unintentional problem that can occur in the healing process. It’s comprised of connective tissue and small capillaries that form over the wound. It essentially halts the wound healing process by preventing epithelialization from occurring which is when epithelial cells create a barrier of skin between the wound and the outside environment preventing further infection or harm.

I’m not invalidating you’re feelings of feeling  unattracted to him but your husband is at zero fault here. You asked him, he was honest, the number was high but you didn’t even know him then. You can’t hold a grudge over the past when you weren’t involved.

medizzy,fdvw6b7,t3_en7ux1,1578752323.0,I have had a lot of patients with cuts on their head and they are terrified because it won’t stop bleeding. Wish I had this picture to show them. Our body is so neat.
physicianassistant,fds92up,t1_fds8vap,1578697172.0,Oh I know that. I just see it as a “once one gets posted and is allowed then the precedent is set” kind of thing. No worries!

ynab,fds5jz4,t1_fds40d8,1578694842.0,"At the end of the day, I still want to live life and have fun. Those expenses to me are important to make sure I’m not going overboard but If I budgeted $500 for a  trip then I’m basically saying I am willing to spend that amount. 

With your weekend/day trips, set a specific amount and see what you spend. If you think $50 is reasonable then I would just put it all into one category. 

I now am able to see my “travel” average spending just like my gas, dining, etc. if you have 5 day trips over the next month or two then you will be able to say “hmm I’ve been averaging about $50 per trip” and then you can budget based on that information at the beginning of the month or whenever your pay check comes in."
physicianassistant,fds2m84,t3_emxsm0,1578693394.0,I hate to be the one to say but come on. This is not the place for this kind of stuff....
ynab,fdrz0wo,t3_emxbh5,1578691862.0,"I like to separate my “normal” expenses from my travel expenses.

That being said, I have a “travel” category that I put every transaction related to that trip in it. Gas, hotel, dining, entertainment, shopping, etc all goes into that travel category. I’d rather compare what I’m spending on different trips with all the expenses included than compare those expenses to my “normal” spending. 

I try to keep at least $500 in my travel category just in case of any spontaneous weekend getaways while also thinking ahead for trips I know I have planned which in that case my travel category will be budgeted for each month depending on the cost of future trip.

Ultimately I recommend doing what you said because I want my every day expense reports to reflect my normal life and not include those trips. For example, I budget about $100 per month for gas. I recently drove to see a friend 7 hours away for a few days and spend roughly $60 in gas. While yes that is gas money spent, I put those transactions in my travel category because I don’t want that one random trip where I use more gas than normal to affect my gas averages for all the other normal times."
