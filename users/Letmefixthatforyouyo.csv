Her character story is one of competence, of testing ~~s~~herlocks limits for the joy of it, and of course being attracted to him in the process. However, that does not mean that this women, embroiled in high society and high goverment drama, is going to do something as absurdly stupid as making a passcode to her phone her love interests name. That was flat masturbatory elevation of Sherlock as a godly figure, an example of Moffett clapping for himself in the writing while making an otherwise competent ""villain"" out to be dimwitted as all fuck. It so deeply contrived, you're inventing whole ""4d chess"" bullshit to explain why something so stupid was an amazing twist. 

In the original story, Adler was a great character. She was a free spirit that often disguised herself as a man to revel in the freedom it brought, a bold act and dangerous act in those days. She caught the eye of a king to be, and they had an affair that had a photograph of them together. Sherlock was sent to retrieve the compromising photo that she possessed to prevent the embarrassment of the king, but he failed utterly after she deduced what he was after. She left town with it in her possession, but being a good person, did not opt to use it in the nefarious way the men were afraid of. They basically worked to undermine her because they were afraid of something they would do with that kind of blackmail, but she was better than them all. Thats a powerful person, breaking social norms for freedom, and rising above using a tool for her own enrichment because it was the wrong thing to do, all while outwitting the kings personal guard and the worlds greatest detective.

So in the original story, we have a character going head to head with a king, his men and Sherlock Holmes, and beating them all out via subterfuge and perceptive deduction. In Moffets version, we have a femme fatal so puppy eyed in love with Sherlock, she ignores the most basic spycraft (a good password) after foiling the entirety of the UK goverment. This mistake puts her mere seconds away from being executed. That passcode  was literally life and death for her, and the only reason shes lived was because Sherlock magically rescued her using Sherlock powers.

I wasent aware of any sexist controversy about the episode, but I really do understand where its coming from. Moffett took the one strong female character in Doyle's Sherlock novels, who acted autonomously and well, and made her make such a stupid decision that her whole life was literally dependent on Sherlock. Way to strip out that agency Moffett."

You call that sticking the landing? It was a painfully cheesy retelling of the Arthur Conan Doyle story where Sherlock actually loses.

Steve Bannon, of Breitbart and the Trump campaign fame, realized years ago while running a WOW gold farming company that there was a large group of disenfranchised and easily manipulated men in America, looking for identity.  When a story about ""ethics in game journalism"" broke in that demographic, he told this then employee at Breitbart, Milo, to try to whip people up, as a way to engage them in his alt right cause.

It worked stunningly well. Milo ran with it, became a token ""he cant be a bigot,  he's gay"" firebrand, picking fights and making waves wherever he could, playing the classic fascist role of ""brave warrior/victim of ttthheeeem"" that  is key to driving the unanchored into frenzy. He energized a movement of sullen and violent men that we are in the thick of now. 

Some years later, riding this high, he gave an interview where he advocated for gay pedophilia, as he was apparently at least a victim, but also a likely perpetrator. Of course, he was dropped like hot lead by even the alt right.

The FTC guidelines have been posted in thread. Based on them, I think the matter rises to the level of false adverting. Even if it didn't, I don't do buisness with vendors that openly lie to me as a customer. If I cant trust what yoire saying to be true, im not going to risk spending money with you.

Since interesting hot sauce is a plentiful resource, I cant think of a single reason to give this seller any of my buisness now."

This is exactly the issue. Im glad you've caught up to the rest of us.

If he breaks [false advertising laws](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/advertising-faqs-guide-small-business) about fake ""going out of buisness"" sales, why would I believe he follows food safety laws? I know he's a liar, so him saying he does means nothing.

Between employers not doing due diligence and tech unemployment being in negative numbers in most any largish city, this is not nearly the whammy its portrayed as. 

Your potential employer is just as likely not to call at all, not take the call at face value, or opt to go ahead anyway because they really need staff. Worst case, you work for an MSP or some other body shop for a bit until you can pivot to a better role through repetition and networking.

sysadmin,fcmjez5,t1_fcm2x78,1577777711.0,"You need to earnestly reconsider your stance on RDP. Its had issues in the past, but it is the standard client in windows environments for a reason. 

Do not discount that its a built in tool on windows servers, updated and secured by Microsoft, a 100billion/yr company. They arent perfect, but it will be way, way more audited and maintained than a random VNC install you decied to use. What happens when the next guy opts not to update the VNC clients on all the servers, or the company opts to forgo support (if you even buy it to begin with)? You'll have an unpatched, outdated and vulnerable agent running on every machine, likely sharing credentials that don't expire. Its a perfect pivot point for attackers.

RDP will always be maintained, always be updated, for free, with no admin action. It works well, is ubiquitous and well understood by any windows admin. It integrates with AD, allowing granual access control via groups/GPOs. As long as its not exposed directly to the internet, it is very secure by default.

If you want to get away from RDP, move as many servers as possible to windows Nano. Thats the actual way to reduce attack surface on windows server. No RDP there, and no need for VNC either."
