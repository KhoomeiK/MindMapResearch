Like that's some sorta reason to dislike the guy"
melbourne,fecmhzl,t1_febh210,1578977587.0,"Some people believe 5G is a plot by the government to either melt our brains or sterilise us with radiation.

So they would be looking at us like ignorant idiots for going about our days normally"
melbourne,fecmbvy,t1_febh91j,1578977461.0,"Official stance is OH&S hazard, specifically *not* inclement weather."

melbourne,fdm1ikj,t1_fdlyk22,1578537587.0,"Are they on rest days, leave, or are they helping with our national emergency?

If they're on rest days or leave, not our problem - come into work and do your job like the rest of us have to. I've been called into work on my holidays before, and I got paid less than them."
conspiracy,fdiyrxo,t1_fdiw847,1578454146.0,"Do you believe people have a right to equal opportunity?

Do you also believe that being born poor is a hindrance to your chance at equal opportunity? 

Because I would answer yes to both questions, I believe it's the government's responsibility to try to ensure the poor are given a better chance than they currently are.

I don't believe freedom under the law is the same as real freedom to earn your way in society."
facepalm,fdgo0qd,t1_fdgmqj9,1578403625.0,"There are wild sheep already, and domesticated sheep don't reproduce naturally at a rate to sustain their population. 

We don't need to reverse selective breeding, just let the current ones live out their natural lives and that's pretty much it."
facepalm,fdgnsxf,t1_fdgnldd,1578403441.0,"Honest question, does wool as a fabric do anything that cotton, hemp or dozens of synthetic fibres don't?"
facepalm,fdgnlii,t1_fdglnwl,1578403262.0,"That's literally the point they're making.

Not ""stop shearing sheep"".

Instead, ""artificially breeding a genetic abomination that will literally die without our constant intervention for profit is immoral""."
conspiracy,fdfuvo0,t1_fdfr3y9,1578370838.0,"Only if your performance indicator is profit, rather than human lives saved.

I know that no matter what happens in my life, my conditions will always be treated, unlike the USA. The tax I pay for this is less than most Americans pay in insurance premiums, and theres no such thing as a deductible. 

This is consistent across the developed world, it's not a fluke or a trick. It's just the USA lagging behind and allowing your poor to die so that insurance companies can profit."
conspiracy,fdfub89,t1_fde52tb,1578370410.0,Wanting some socialist policies like public healthcare and education don't necessitate a revolution. We have great healthcare (for now) in Australia with 0 guillotined politicians.

news,fcto1w2,t1_fctmk0v,1577950937.0,"Again, I agree with you that it's a tragedy. I'm just saying, we don't have to benefit from an animal for it's death to be a bad thing.

CRISPR, anti-freeze, proteins from bears. All great things, would be horrible if they were lost. You don't need to explain the utility of certain animals for me to care about them,  you should care about them even if they're useless to you."
news,fctek8x,t1_fct5yj1,1577940753.0,"Can you get any facts to back up your claim? I ask because a huge amount of the burned land is farmland.

Even the article only really mentions an estimated 8000 koalas, leaving 492,000 other animal deaths, which I can only assume includes a huge number of farm animals."
news,fcte70j,t1_fctc4ei,1577940425.0,"Honest question, why not do both?

You said it yourself, you agree on the climate aspect of this tragedy. We're also trying to work on that. Animal agriculture is a leading cause of climate change.

If we're discussing climate change, why not also take a moment to think about animal ag?"
news,fctdxhx,t1_fct4wtd,1577940193.0,"Most of the animals that have died in these fires are farm animals, just an FYI.

There is no difference because they're the same animals, for the most part.

If you care about these fires but not animal agriculture, then you're just saying you only care about the fact that no one profited from these deaths."
dataisbeautiful,fbenoa3,t1_fbejda4,1576789746.0,"So argue for doing both, don't argue against step one."
