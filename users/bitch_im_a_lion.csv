Ehh. Its really limited customization in part because the linear bike upgrades are visual. Like the best gas tank, best engine, best exhaust, best frame, etc. dramatically change the look of your bike. Theres smaller visual changes and some paint decals and stuff but really by the end game the fully upgraded bike has a particular look no matter what. I hope the next game they can expand on it, but as a big fan of customization in games I felt pretty let down by the bike customization."

We were just like...what the hell do we do now? One of these is definitely our cat, but they both just show up like they're meant to be here. It also raised the question of if it was always the same cat or if we'd been accidentally taking care of two different cats in turns and they decided to drop the act.

BillBurr,fdq8ttm,t1_fdq6cd6,1578659553.0,">Ive grown up in an alcoholic household. Bill Burr is not an alcoholic

Your anecdotal evidence doesnt mean much. If he is an alcoholic he's a functioning one. He clearly thinks he has a problem though or else the sobriety wouldn't be that big of a deal. He would've absolutely had a drink by now if he thought he could handle it without going deep into drinking again. It's not an ""insult"" to anyone to listen to what he says and make really really logical conclusions based on what he says. 

Like jesus dude listen to yourself. 

>He also doesnt want his daughter to see him drunk

Not a concern non-alcoholics have. Casual drinkers can drink without getting drunk. They can control themselves. He clearly can't (and that's not me arriving to conclusions he's said as much). 

And even if they know they'll get drunk they can plan around it so they dont have to go to their kids drunk. Hell just in this Monday's podcast hes talking about the fact he'll be away from them for a week. For a ""casual drinker who's just taking a little break"" that seems like the opportune time to have a little drink to yourself if you're solely worried about your toddler seeing you drunk right? 

He clearly feels if he's drinking theres a nonzero chance that he could be drunk any given night. 

>Many, many drinkers just enjoy drinking. Not many can last calender years sober. Having an urge to drink doesnt make them alcoholics.

As a casual drinker myself you're absolutely right. But the difference is I don't ever ""worry"" when I have an urge to drink because I know it could be the last drink I have for months until the next time I feel like having one. I don't have a beer and then go ""well I guess I'm gettin drunk"" nor do I feel like because I've broken my ""sobriety"" since my last drink that I'll now be in a state of binge drinking until I mentally decide to have a break again. I just have that beer or two that one night and move on like normal. I also have a liquor cabinet with bottles on display. I have no issue walking past that every day and not feeling any kind of urge to drink them. I dont have to force them out of my house because looking at them would tempt me too much like Bill has.

Not to even mention in all of this that being an alcoholic, especially one who can successfully maintain sobriety as long as he has is nothing to be ashamed of. It's an easy to get and widely available drug and people with impulse control issues (again, Bill has said as much) tend to get hooked. I think he hasn't said it outright because there's a stigma attached to it and because if he does stop being sober he doesnt have to call it a relapse or make people feel weird if he's drinking around them. But I wanna make it clear I'm not judging him for being one, I'm just saying the evidence points to him being one. Also like I said in both of my comments regardless of whether he is or isnt one, he clearly feels talking about the sobriety helps as he does it a lot and I dont think people should judge him for talking about it as much as he does."
