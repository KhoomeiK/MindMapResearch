education,ff3c9nh,t3_erdt9b,1579538307.0,"I've taught in a ""high risk"" public school and a Catholic school.  While schools may vary significantly, Catholic school students tend to be much better behaved and the parents are much more involved.  Again, this is a tenancy...  This doesn't mean that some Catholic schools don't have more problems than some public schools.  A lot of parents are really bad at parenting and they tend to have a higher concentration in poorer schools.  Catholic schools tend to filter out even more bad parents.  Bad parents tend to have children who make it difficult for everyone.

&#x200B;

In a Catholic school, your child will receive religious education but will be accepted as a non Catholic.  Most of the Catholic kids won't care that your child is not Catholic.  The only time it really shows is that your child will skip communion at Mass; there are always a few and it's no big deal.  The only students I have seen become Catholic while in school, do so with their entire family.  Most non Catholics remain non Catholic.  Nearly all celebrate Halloween, are cool with Harry Potter and teach real science.  


Most importantly, get a tour during school hours.  Go to the open house during Catholic schools week (Jan 31 - Feb 6th).  Talk to parents at the school about the school culture.  


Also, consider volunteering at your current school.  You may learn that your child class is particularly bad, or the kindergarten teacher is particularly tough, or has poor classroom management skills or ?

Expect costs of: registration, taxes, insurance, maintenance, etc.  There are plenty of good reliable cars out there for way less than half of that.  Buy a decent car for 3-6K and bank the rest.
