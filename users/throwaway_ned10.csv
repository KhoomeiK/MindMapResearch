dating_advice,fep9c5g,t3_eq9hdr,1579315049.0,"Listen up. Women are emotional. They want to feel secure and cared for when they're with their boyfriend. If you're saying she's ""way out of your league,"" talking about how broke you are, putting her on a pedestal and talking about how she's 100x more intelligent than you she's not going to feel secured and cared for ever because you make yourself sound like a loser.

The problem isn't you being poor (doesn't sound like you are totally poor) or ""unintelligent""(unintelligent people don't get PHDs), its your attitude towards it. Your job, looks, etc are all secondary to how you make a woman ""feel"", if you walk around all the time shitting on yourself she's going to be a hundred times more put off by that than if she ever thought you were underachieving in life (which believe me people tend to be a lot less interested in what others do than we think).   


Bottom line: Respect yourself, big up yourself, believe in yourself and your career path. If you don't, that's going to be a 100x more detrimental with women than ""oh i'm just a PHD student why would anyone want me""."

The issue is though if one of the calls fails I would still like info from the other two calls, so promise.all() doesn't work in that scenario. So, was wondering if there's another way to make api calls concurrently without using promise.all()."
