Mouse: still going after 5 years
Keypad: still going after 5 years
Mousepad: still going after 6 years
Headphones: still going after 6 years
Keyboard: still going after 5.5 years
It may seem expensive, but it's really cheap in the long term."

I would advice you to do the same, just take your time and take it easy, and when you are ready it will come naturally. That is working for me at least, not rushing it and only telling it to people i really trust. Wish you the best tho."

socialanxiety,fc0n7n7,t3_efitlb,1577295055.0,"I used to study IT,i did 3 whole semesters but couldn't go on with the fourth. This year i started industrial design, 2 years older than the rest of the people in there, and them knowing each other from previous years, it was really hard for me to connect, as everybody already had friends and people to spend time with. It's been only after 9 months or more that im BARELY starting to talk to people and make ""friends"". It's just a matter of time and you'll be fine. I know this is only an approach to the part of having a hard time making friends of your story, but that's what i can help with.
Hope it's easy for you buddy, good luck :)"

There's this girl i had a huuuge crush on and celt weird about talking to her, mostly because of the possibility of being rejected. A few months after doing nothing i decided to reply to one of her instagram stories. Fast forward like a year or more, we've been talking for like 9 months and only met once, she has a job with a changing schedule and me, well, i have SA and always find it hard to meet, so it's perfect to both of us. We are not dating tbh, but i think we will in a few months. It might take some time and some effort, but it's possible. Good luck <3"
Suicide_help,f2iibd5,t3_dan22m,1570257644.0,Is there something similar to interventions? Or some group therapy where you can tell the therapist what is actually going on with the person in question? I think that if you find some way to get him to go to something like that it could help
