wholesomememes,ff759cz,t1_ff5igj9,1579641386.0,Oh man I’m so excited for you. I think right at the point when you’re like I don’t know if I can keep doing it then the start smiling at you and you get all supercharged again. At least that’s how it was for us. Sleep deprived at home is much better than sleep deprived at the hospital!
wholesomememes,ff5drej,t1_ff57kmk,1579588623.0,That shit’s advanced! I am trying to imagine our 5 month old doing this and it seems so far away but in reality it’ll be here before we know it! All the things they do are like wow!!  Who knew simply picking something up could be so amazing.
wholesomememes,ff5dmc2,t1_ff4mr9n,1579588468.0,Congratulations!!!
wholesomememes,ff5dkno,t1_ff4ik6r,1579588415.0,Congratulations! We found out we were pregnant around this time last year and now have a 5 month old baby girl. It’s so crazy amazing and now already the time before baby feels like a different life.
wholesomememes,ff5dih4,t1_ff4ient,1579588350.0,Hahahaahah I’ll hope this is an event that happens to my husband and not to me
wholesomememes,ff5dgf6,t1_ff4pvkj,1579588287.0,Haha oh man the hands! Ours does “The Godfather” with her fingers all crossed and a stoic contemplative pout.. every baby action is somehow adorable
wholesomememes,ff5d8m5,t1_ff4lx3z,1579588050.0,Yayyy heading home from the NICU soon!! Ours was in for a little bit and she’s doing just fine at home now. Best wishes to you buddy! Congratulations !
wholesomememes,ff5d5gs,t1_ff4m5id,1579587957.0,Great answer. I think you have described exactly what has happened to my husband now that we have a baby girl. “Softened up” is a good way to put it.
wholesomememes,ff5d0ln,t1_ff4fnph,1579587812.0,"Lol congrats! 

Meanwhile in our household 

Me: hiiiii! Sophie held her head up for 15 seconds today!! 
Hubs: wowww way to go baby!!! Getting so big!!

The tiniest things have become epic."
wholesomememes,ff5ctpn,t1_ff4bcfr,1579587605.0,It’s going to be great. Best wishes and congratulations!
wholesomememes,ff5crhr,t1_ff4rjqd,1579587535.0,Congratulations!! This has gotta be Reddit’s happiest thread!
wholesomememes,ff5cmvh,t1_ff4nab9,1579587395.0,"Congrats on the little one. It’s such a wonderful and excruciating and heartwarming experience. There’s really no way to appreciate what it means to have a baby until you have one eh. I was like oh it’ll be hard but I had no idea. No idea man. But then you look at your baby and it’s all worth it. Just wait until he/she starts smiling... your heart will melt. 

On the topic, we have a 5 month old and pretty much Amazon/Walmart delivery everything. A lot of times Walmart has better prices than Amazon on household items and they do free next day delivery!"
wholesomememes,ff5cb0x,t1_ff4j3pd,1579587050.0,Congratulations! We have a 5 month old and it’s like every day she becomes more “human.” Cannot await for the words to start. You’re in for a fun time ahead my friend!
wholesomememes,ff5c84x,t1_ff4ip95,1579586965.0,Good luck and kudos for being a good paren for little one. Get well soon!
wholesomememes,ff5c35f,t1_ff49qlr,1579586823.0,"Awww I can’t wait! Our 5 month old has just started laughing and smiles at basically every face and we’re a constant wash of awwwww and ooooo. It’s so amazing having a sleeping baby on your chest, too. I can’t even imagine what it’ll be like when she starts talking and coming in for snuggles on her own! 

Congrats and best wishes for your family!!"

gifs,ff50k72,t3_erdd1y,1579576998.0,A bunch of us were walking on a frozen pond once and I watched the guy next to me fall in in very very sow motion as the ice bent beneath him for at least two seconds before a hole cracked through. We shared a moment of wide eyed Oh Shit before he fell through and I ran away. I always wondered if I really saw that ice bend or imagined it. It was only waist deep so I assume he survived.
aww,fefiv32,t1_fee80br,1579057245.0,Awesome! Just sent this to my husband. There are so many mom resources and not nearly enough daddy ones!

One of my friends played through a bunch of Witcher games and said every choice in the game leads to either a sad or more sad outcome. Are the books depressing? I love a good fantasy novel but some are so gnarly. The show is dark but not *too* dark ya know."

AmItheAsshole,fcugm9x,t1_fcttght,1577980481.0,If my daughter wanted to play in a doll house you’re damn right I would be playing with her.
AmItheAsshole,fcufldh,t1_fcu6ev6,1577979774.0,"True and I agree with you. If I’d built a dollhouse for my daughter, I’d rather it be used than sit around, but then again I wouldn’t have put a lock on it so my other daughter couldn’t play with it. To each his own. I felt there was a curious lack of this perspective in the thread hence the comment that would obviously be downvoted to oblivion. Have a good day redditor!"
AmItheAsshole,fctk3tj,t3_einuyo,1577946122.0,"YTA

Letting a beautiful dollhouse sit unused in a house is worse than having it worn down by zealous playtime IMO. Your dad’s memory is honored by the joy his grandkids get from playing in that house, not by letting it sit around in disuse. Toys only get worn and broken and messed up because children love them. In a way they have to be expendable and any toy that isn’t is not really a toy at all. Teach them to respect their toys but also respect that if they play it to pieces then it has served its purpose.

Dad built a plexiglass lock on this so “destructive little sister” couldn’t play with it.. I did that so sad. Maybe it’s art and not a toy. 

You don’t have kids so what will happen to the dollhouse when you eventually pass away?"
GifRecipes,fcti7tw,t1_fct0hev,1577944144.0,Truth! All so delicious. Makes western meals look basic. We made her shrimp toast recipe once (outstanding) and it was probably the most complex breakfast we have ever concocted.
funny,fck8vcw,t1_fck39kd,1577719749.0,My parents have and will probably keep forever their wood paneling. It’s so vintage now I think of it as classic.
