I did this on duna with nuclear engines and called it the ""DuneHopper"". I had to give it a lot of surface area and turning/landing was near impossible because I couldn't seem to slow down/change my Delta V quick enough. I resorted to being a lofty rover with that duna craft."

Even if there is no way to test it, if someone figures it out we would have a new guide to follow so everyone could make eve planes. I feel like there is a lot that we could actually learn about the game that we can pass on so we could all make eve/duna planes."
