fatlogic,feuvrxb,t1_felont7,1579390418.0,"Yes, and I don’t get it. When I got diagnosed with fibro, my first question to my doc was “what can I do about it?”. So when she said an anti inflammatory diet and exercise, along with weight loss, would help, then I did those. She was right. So an actual medical expert knew more than me? Who knew? Lol

And yeah, they’re toxic people. Having chronic health problems is hard for sure, and some people DO dismiss you and give unhelpful advice. They just don’t want to actually try anything that would involve bettering themselves."

fatlogic,fefog9p,t3_envvez,1579060839.0,"I’m actually all for incorporating different body types in art, film, tv, etc. I often find many shows more relatable when there’s a more diverse array of people. So I don’t mind the fat acceptance crown campaigning for different body types to be seen.

What I do mind is when artists do just that, but it’s not ever enough for them."

fatlogic,fdp1z9u,t3_emg6ba,1578618087.0,"One thing I will say is this: we need to advocate for better nutrition education, and I’d also love to see free cooking classes offered in low income areas. I do think that would be a big help. Whole junk food is cheap, there are so many meals you can make with cheap ingredients (chicken legs, beans, rice, frozen veggies, canned tomatoes and tomato sauce, eggs, milk, potatoes), often the same price or CHEAPER than pre packaged junk. 

Basically, I’d love for the fat acceptance movement to change the narrative to say “it seems that obesity rates are higher in low income areas. What can we do to educate about cooking healthy foods on a budget? What can we do to inform the public about exercises you can do at home, or for free at libraries and community centers?”

But no. That would mean doing something..."
fatlogic,fdox52s,t3_emfjt1,1578614891.0,"I won’t lie. When my doctor told me I developed prediabetes, high blood pressure, and non alcoholic fatty liver disease due to obesity and I needed to lose weight, it stung. It was embarrassing. I felt so defeated.

But the next day I got over it. Admitted I did it to myself, and I could fix it, too.

I’m down 130lbs; have maintained for 2 years. All of those health problems are gone now.

It sucks to be told you’re destroying your body because your love of food is more important than your quality of life. But my doctor was obligated to tell me that. I’m grateful that he did."

progresspics,fddn2lm,t1_fddm04u,1578318315.0,"Thank you! Two years, but it’s because I took my time so that I could focus on it being a total lifestyle change. It’s what kept me going! I didn’t have a date of when I wanted to meet my goal. I just followed my macros, but if I wanted to splurge on occasion I did."
fatlogic,fddmtgc,t3_ekn7m2,1578318082.0,"My gym is AMAZING! I go at the same time 5 days a week and there are a lot of regulars. They’ve always been friendly to me—when I started losing weight, I was embarrassed to lift weights in the main lifting area so I went to the women’s workout room. I guess I clearly looked lost. A woman asked if I needed help, and I admitted I didn’t know how to use the machines. I showed her the workout plan I had, and she showed me how to use and adjust every machine. She noticed I was new, and let’s face it, out of shape and fat, and helped.

I’ve seen this happen to others at my gym, too.

I’ve been going for over 3 years and I have NEVER seen a single person make fun of, or stare at, anyone. Not far people, thin people, no one. Everyone is there to better themselves and I think we just kinda all silently root each other on. You know?

I wish the fat acceptance movement knew how supportive the fitness community actually is! What a shame that they make fat people feel like they’d be teased and stared at at the gym, when most likely no one would even give them a second look!"
DuggarsSnark,fddmiu3,t3_ekpgx5,1578317805.0,"I absolutely agree that this would be great. I grew up church of Christ and while it’s not as fundie as the Duggar’s, it is a very spiritually abusive church. Lots of cult like mentality, black and entire thinking, constant threat of going to hell, etc. 

I know it’s so easy to judge Jill for doing some modern things (like having a nose ring, cutting hair, wearing pants), but still having homophobic and sexist beliefs. But keep in mind that deprogramming takes a LONG TIME.

I was around Jill’s age when I started feeling like everything I was taught in my church was faulty. I started doing little things at first, like wearing short skirts or sleeveless shirts. I was still spewing homophobic nonsense and other bad beliefs. I was brainwashed! And terrified that if I admitted I didn’t really agree with it, that I’d go to hell. 

Slowly I started making other bolder choices, like drinking alcohol, having sex (I wasn’t married), and becoming friends with LGBT people.

I’d say it took about 5 years before I finally said I didn’t believe what I was brought up believing, and then left the church. It took even longer to be vocal about my support for the LGBT community.  And even longer before I started speaking out about the spiritual abuse you get from the church of Christ!

What honestly helped me was stumbling upon things online that started planting that seed of doubt. I feel like if we can give resources that use love and logic to help fundies see the damage their churches are causing them, that’s a good thing.

I’m NOT defending people like Jill and Derek for their homophobia. What I’m saying is, if we can provide resources they might stumble upon that could open their minds, let’s do it.

I hope to see the day where some of the Duggars break totally free from fundamentalism and live happy lives."
progresspics,fdchcqj,t1_fdcec93,1578274919.0,"Honestly? For me I started by thinking about why I wanted to lose weight. I wanted to reverse the health problems I knew obesity was causing; and I wanted to become a runner. Having tangible goals motivated me to stick with it in the long run.

My other tip: work with food, not against it. I love food, so I cook delicious food that is made healthier. It’s not hard to stick with it when you actually want to eat the food.

And find exercise you genuinely like doing. The best workout is the one you want to do, not the one you feel like you have to do."
fatlogic,fdakamj,t3_ekfumk,1578246959.0,"You know what else feels good? Eating a healthy diet that gives me energy for my day and fuels my love of running and roller skating. 

I know that becoming the best runner I can means I have to fuel my body properly. 

I know that learning more tricks at the skate park is easier when my body is lean and strong.

So, to each their own, but for me, counting my macros and eating healthy foods feels good."

I battle fibromyalgia, celiac disease, depression, post concussion syndrome, and I’m autistic. It has made it all really difficult to know who I can trust as friends because, like you, people bailed on me because 1)my fibro is much better than it used to be, but still, sometimes I hurt too much to go out, 2)I can’t eat at the restaurant they chose due to celiac, 3)they try to say I’m not autistic because I “don’t seem like it”, but I mask it really well so a lot of people don’t see it until they know me better.

I genuinely mean this—if you’d like to chat, message me. I could use more chronic illness warriors to chat with and become friends with."

This is a group for people who don’t like dogs, don’t understand society’s obsession with them, and are tired of being demonized for it. There are hundreds of other places you can go to share your love of dogs. This is one of few places we can come to vent about dogs without being attacked for it."

I spent the night crying on my couch with my cats, watching Disney movies and just alone and unsure.

2016 brought a ton of wonderful things. It truly did get better.

It’s ok if tonight just sucks for you. It sounds like you’re choosing a healthy hobby to spend your evening doing, instead of something self destructive.
