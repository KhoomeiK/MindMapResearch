Yes, I think there are plenty of Germans in Germany who are homogeneous. Have you traveled Germany? Because I have for a couple of months. There are loads of tiny villages which the same families have lived in for millennia. That's not the same as immigrants moving to a country full of other immigrants and expecting that the bloodline remained pure for 3 centuries.
