vegan,fcpdq4m,t1_fcow9su,1577859632.0,"I disagree with everyone who says we don‚Äôt have a good cheese substitute yet. When I first began my vegan transition (14 years ago in rural AZ), there was nothing. We have so much now! I craved cheese for probably almost a year after I finally made the switch for good, but once you switch it in your mind there‚Äôs no going back, and I think there are some amazing options now. It‚Äôs night and day compared to even a decade ago. Good luck!"
AskWomenOver30,fcm8qon,t1_fcj5btq,1577767256.0,"This is an interesting point. Thank you! Not something I‚Äôd do immediately since there‚Äôs a cost involved, but I‚Äôll keep it in the back of my mind."
AskWomenOver30,fcm8okr,t1_fci6iqo,1577767209.0,"Yes! You and I sound similar. I don‚Äôt have fb or Instagram and cancelled my Netflix, but will most likely delete this app from my phone. Thanks!"
AskWomenOver30,fcm8kz4,t1_fciwnm9,1577767127.0,"This is very true, thank you...I‚Äôll think on that as well!"
AskWomenOver30,fcm8jzs,t1_fchuwct,1577767104.0,Definitely going to be better about the time limit thing. I do it now and then ignore myself üôÑ
VeganFoodPorn,fcjg83y,t3_eheift,1577686452.0,This looks amazing! Recipe?
FreeCompliments,fcje856,t3_ehclgs,1577684495.0,"Good job! Also you have excellent music taste, wonderful hair and perfect skin."
offmychest,fcjdx74,t3_eh51f9,1577684220.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you, and that your family has reacted in such a confusing and hurtful way. A lot of folks are telling you you should report, and that is certainly an option, but it‚Äôs not true in every state that there is no statute of limitations. I really recommend connecting with a confidential advocate who can help you understand your options where you live. RAINN.org has an online chat option, and every state in the US has a state-based agency that can lead you to an advocate nearest you. If you‚Äôre still under 18, confidentiality laws are different per state, but they can also explain that to you. Feel free to PM me if I can help connect you with resources. Take care of yourself ‚ô•Ô∏è"
offmychest,fcjdep8,t1_fcffqu2,1577683767.0,That‚Äôs incorrect. Totally depends on the state.
femalehairadvice,fcjd9w7,t1_fcjayla,1577683648.0,And the purple color is so beautiful on you!
FreeCompliments,fcjbe4j,t3_ehckzp,1577682079.0,"You are a genuine human who is more than just a body. While it‚Äôs important to learn to love our bodies, it‚Äôs also important to know that we‚Äôre more than that - and just from looking at this picture, it‚Äôs clear you‚Äôre a creative, thoughtful person who deserves happiness. üíó"
suggestmeabook,fcja46g,t3_ehfwl2,1577681080.0,"It‚Äôs not exactly what I think you‚Äôre looking for, but I‚Äôd always rather get a survivor‚Äôs perspective - Girls Like Us is a memoir by Rachel Lloyd, who founded GEMS in NY. Not perfect and not super-new, but very recommended."

tattoo,fci4g1h,t1_fci3w3w,1577657671.0,"Honestly, if you can do the hour trip, I would. I‚Äôm a bit of a rule-follower with the care instructions, and it‚Äôs always worked well."
KindVoice,fchnken,t3_ehaffo,1577652080.0,It doesn‚Äôt sound stupid. I‚Äôm really sorry this happened to you üôÅ
Shoestring,fccz4r7,t3_eh2fj7,1577604385.0,"This might not be up your alley but I love thisbatteredsuitcase.com so much. A woman who has traveled a TON alone and with others, now gets paid for it but didn‚Äôt used to, and has a lot of wisdom to share."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fccrtet,t1_fcbsfb7,1577601881.0,Thank you. People are idiots.
lookatmydog,fccas3b,t1_fcc1re6,1577596281.0,One can be both.

offmychest,fc4pyyn,t3_efytb3,1577424249.0,"This is really heartwarming. You both sound like wonderful, loving people."
KindVoice,fc4o6u4,t3_eg5ovc,1577422590.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry that the people closest to you have such unkind things to say. Often, I think it‚Äôs much more a part of male culture to ‚Äúgood-naturedly‚Äù make fun of each other based on looks. I hope you find the ability to communicate what you need to those around you, and I REALLY hope you find some folks in your life who can be kind."
AskWomenOver30,fc4kvl3,t3_eg3qtc,1577419653.0,"Much of this has been mentioned, but my thoughts as a female who likes running alone and also works very closely with the subject matter:

- your dad is most likely not trying to be victim-blamey, he is scared. Folks in the comments are right that you‚Äôre more likely to be assaulted by a partner/killed in a car accident/etc, but women are also assaulted by strangers and it‚Äôs important to be aware of your surroundings. 
- you don‚Äôt have to guess at how safe your area is. Crime stats are reported, and you can look up those in your city/neighborhood (of course, this will only give you those that are reported to police, so keep that in mind)
- it would be a good idea to do at least one of the following (some of which people have mentioned): turn down the music or take one headphone out, find a dog to accompany you, find a human to accompany you who also likes to walk and listen to music/an audiobook, and/or tell someone where you are going and when you expect to be back - with a plan for what they should do if you‚Äôre not. 
- listen to your gut feeling! Try to work on hearing it and not questioning it - most of us are conditioned from an early age to avoid hurting people‚Äôs [read: men‚Äôs] feelings, and to be polite. Fuck that. If you get a weird feeling about someone or somewhere, don‚Äôt try to be tough, just trust yourself and get away from that thing. 

Do the things you love...just also make sure the rose-colored glasses aren‚Äôt on all the time. The world isn‚Äôt always safe, and we can plan for that but still enjoy it ‚ù§Ô∏è"
AskWomenOver30,fc4jhzq,t1_fc49dct,1577418474.0,Jesus. I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss.
Frugal,fc4eavv,t1_fc4b0vu,1577414177.0,I wish I could upvote this a million times. Such an important point.
Marriage,fc4dqsk,t1_fc3uwhk,1577413713.0,"Sorry that internet strangers think they know best how to act in your own marriage. Sounds like you have a happy partnership that works well for the both of you. It works differently for everyone, folks!"
