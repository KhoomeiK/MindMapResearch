I totally understand about not knowing what the hell is going on. Am I depressed or just hormonal? Is this normal? That's a tough one to call, IMHO. When in doubt, find a good therapist to talk to and maybe after a few sessions they'll tell you that you're normal and just need to learn some better ways to deal with shit.

Second is timing. Depression doesn't make for good dinner conversation. Pick a time when the right person is in the mood to talk about depression.

Third is your words. Focus on statements that begin with ""I feel..."". If you say, ""Sometimes I feel like everything is pointless,"" then there's something to talk about. If you say, ""Everything is pointless,"" then you've issued a blanket statement that will put your conversation partner is an awkward position.

Regardless, I understand about missing someone's kid who you were close to. I saw my former stepson yesterday. It was tough. When he was little he was my little buddy. We were super close. The divorce messed that up and now things just feel awkward and full of tension.

It's really difficult being a stepparent (legally or not - doesn't matter really). You have to ride an emotional line that keeps moving. It's easy to fuck up and extremely difficult to do right. I'm about to become a stepparent again and it's a huge source of anxiety for me.
