I think if grounding yourself had actual health benefits, it would be rather easy to find research from unbiased actual scientists and published in a respectable journal. It would honestly be a massive discovery, so scientists have no reason to withhold such a discovery.

I'll go out on a limb and say Biden just has antiquated or inappropriate ideas on how to show friendliness or affection toward girls/women.

Also, regarding deciding whether Biden has pedophile tendencies, this video is literally the worst way to do it. Is he the same way around boys and men? We don't know because the video refused to show that. Does he make the same ""are you 17?"" remark to the boys? We don't know. Moreover, what is the reason for that? Maybe he considers it a complement, or maybe he's teasing the kids. The video never mentioned these possibilities. And on ""Don't date until you're 30,"" that could be solid (albeit, hyperbolic) advice for young adults, one of whose main characteristics that distinguishes them from other adults is their heightened sexual hormones that could lead them getting pregnant or suffering emotion distress from breakups or whatever else. Maybe he has a preference for how people should live their younger years.

Also, the video cites Infowars at one point, a conspiracy theory and fake news website. And the entire YouTube channel is filled with right-leaning propaganda bullshit. The video isn't credible.

Yes, he should keep his hands to himself if it makes people uncomfortable. Maybe he already has.

My point is you shouldn't let this video make you feel conflicted because that's exactly the intention. It's making something look like something it's not to influence your political decisions. And this post exemplifies at least one good reason for the no politics rule."

Why do we remember events from the past but don't remember events from the future?

Because memories are created when events occur and then (through the way our brains and the universe works) they are preserved into the future. They are not preserved into the past because that was before they were created.

Why are memories of events created when the event occurs?

The memory must have been created at some point. The way memories work is they are created by some event and it is that event that the memory is about.

Why does the event that created the memory coincide with the event that the memory is about?

Because for something unrelated like a series of cosmic rays creating a memory of an event that hasn't happened yet is statistically unlikely.

Why is it statistically unlikely?

However, it's not likely you'll know the exact time at which the RNG was seeded.

In cases where security is not essential, the specific RNG that is used may be simple enough that it can be quickly ""cracked"" which means determining the initial or internal seed from the sequence of numbers it outputs.

And I'm confused on why you think giving a minority larger representation is a good thing. The majority doesn't want to be trampled either. Why should you make only 20% of people happy when you could make 80% of people happy?

Also side note: I'm curious how voter turnout in each state affects things. If *only one person* in each of the republican states voted and they voted republican and *everyone* in the democratic states voted and they all voted democrat, then the republican candidate would have won the electoral college, but the popular vote would have been 99.9999% in favor of the democratic candidate. Voter turnout ranged from 42% in Hawaii to the highest of 74% in Minnesota in 2016. It's possible that there's more wrong with the system than at first glance.

That said, the electoral college result agrees with the popular result 91% of the time, so maybe it's not all that bad. And when they do disagree, it's only when the margin in the popular vote is small."

Some beliefs can be the same way. I don't think you can prove a god exists. But depending on the type of god, you can harmlessly (and maybe pointlessly) believe it exists.

videos,fdj9uxk,t1_fdj3po6,1578462685.0,"If you ask experts or academics in geopolitics or international relations theory, they'll probably tell you that leaving or not getting involved creates a power vacuum that is usurped by whoever has the capability, e.g. terrorists, dictators, or another country whose interests don't align with the people they're seeking to conquer. And they suggest this as a justification for continued US involvement and military alliance or opposition with other countries.

And I suspect that's been the justification for a long time, including when Britain was a huge naval and colonial power. ""If we don't colonize them, then it'll be the french, spanish, or dutch instead! Do you want that? Do you want to just hand over a free lunch to our enemy?"" Basically, it's the same arms race due to our competitive nature and inability to coordinate on peace and disarmament that has been happening since the birth of civilization.

Now, I don't know if the experts are right. But that's what they're saying."
