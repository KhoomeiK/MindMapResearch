\> Most people can safely go at least 10km/h over the speed limit safely without increasing any risk but changing all the speed limit signs is too costly for a government so we remain driving at the same limits we did many years ago. 

&#x200B;

Again a hard no. Speed variation is what increases the probability of an accident. So if you are driving faster (or slower than) everybody else (who may drive at speed limit) you are going to increase the chance of a collision.

Speed kills is not a motto. Its just physics. Faster you travel, higher your kinetic energy."

Do you know how reddit commenting works?

Read that article. Trump he himself gave the explanation. Trump is the source of the quote. All of these is in the linked article. I do not see how you can misunderstand this if you are not being willfully dumb.

I do not know if WSJ is outright lying. If you think that is the case WSJ can easily lie with sources and quotes. So there is no point of arguing about this at that point."

I do not think this is going to be that much of a problem. i am in a similar apartment complex where landlord prohibits portable washers. Mostly I go to a Laundromat next to me because its a little cheaper. However sometimes I go to the one in the apartment complex. I have never had to come back because its full. Out unit have 4 washers and 4 dryers with about 30-40 rental units.

\> The only time I've hand-washed clothes, they didn't end up smelling as fresh as the washer 

I think this is an issue of air drying cloths indoors rather than washing it in machine. Have you tried washing by hand and then drying in the dryer?"
