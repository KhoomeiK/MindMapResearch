Fable,ff9199m,t1_ff914jt,1579702309.0,"Yes and no. Your 360 account will turn into one on the xbox one when you get one but not the other way around. For example to play backwards compat games, you would have to add your friend as a friend through the 360 interface also to play together. Just being friends on xbox one doesnt count"
Fable,ff90vpc,t1_ff90te3,1579702020.0,Its a tad annoying. I think its because of servers or something that you cant make new 360 accounts
Fable,ff90gyq,t1_ff8krjp,1579701694.0,Yeah but once you get into the 360 interface it only uses the one 360 account so its the main and then a guest account. It wont let you make a new 360 one
