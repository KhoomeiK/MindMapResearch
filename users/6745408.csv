* [LCD](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33002900218.html)
* [iFlash Quad](https://www.iflash.xyz/store/iflash-quad/)

If you upgrade your new one, you can use the HDD from that in the old one you're repairing. The iFlash site has a guide for batteries. I did a 2000mAh (about $12 or so). It fits in the slim case but includes a bumper if you don't want to replace the back. If you do replace the back, you need a new lock and headphone jack ($9 or so)

It's all just ribbon cables, very easy to work with. Be gentle with the battery if you go down that route. There are plenty of videos.

Laundry|Simon|Daily|1|

The output looks like

You can add normal checkboxes in there. 

For conditional formatting, use `=REGEXMATCH(G2,""Jane"")` or if you want to get fancy, use `=AND($F2=FALSE,REGEXMATCH($G2,""Jane""))` --- this assumes the checkboxes are in F and the `Dishes (Jane)` is in G. If the person hasn't done their chores for the day, then their name is highlighted, otherwise it's normal. 

Now, one thing you might want to do instead of a single checkbox for the task is have the whole month mapped out and have them pop an `x` in for each day they cover that chore. This way you don't have to have a script or someone go in and reset the checkboxes. You can also get a better idea about your flatmates' schedules and which chores they have more success with."

This pulls all of the ranges for the player names then uses regex to remove `Name:` and `~Open Spot~`. We then used this for the data validation.

**Dough Recipe:**

* Bread Flour: 16 1/2 oz. (just over 3 cups)
* Ice Water: 10.3 oz. (about 1 1/8 cups)
* Sugar: 7 tsp
* Kosher or Sea Salt: 1 tsp
* Yeast: 1 1/2 tsp
* Vegetable or olive Oil: 1 tbs
* Dusting flour: For all the dusting, I use half bread flour, half semolina flour. You can use what you want.

**Directions:**

1. In mixing bowl, mix together flour, sugar, yeast.
1. While mixing with flat paddle, slowly poor ice water into dry mixture.
1. Let stand for 10 minutes+ (allows yeast to interact with water)
1. Add kosher salt and olive oil. Hand knead until combined.
1. Roll into a ball.
1. Place in oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 12-24 hours. If 24 hours, first 12 in the fridge.

An hour before preparing the pizza, put dough onto floured surface. Cut into two pieces. Pull the sides up and in until the bottom side resembles a dough ball. Flip over so that the clean looking side is on top and place onto floured cookie sheet. Lightly flour top, and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for about an hour before flattening out and preparing pizza.

If using pizza steel:

* Place pizza steel on rungs second from the top.
* Preheat oven to highest temperature (550Â° for mine). Let sit for 1 hour
* 10 minutes before putting pizza in, turn off oven, and turn on the oven broiler (makes steel even hotter.)
* Once pizza is prepared, launch it into the steel with a pizza peel. Let cook for 5 minutes flat, take out and bask in the glory of your better-than-delivery pizza!"

Pizza,felisvb,t1_felijpo,1579223190.0,"we only take made pizzas :)

but yeah, a stone or a steel works. You can launch right onto the grill, though. Back when I was doing this, I would launch into the grill then after a minute or so, move it to the top rack so the bottom doesn't get burned to death."
Pizza,feli32z,t3_eps8om,1579222693.0,"is this from the show or did you make it? 

You can totally make pizza on a grill, but it's better to have a solid surface to launch on to."

It takes the current year, then pulls the date from the row, then even rows get 1 and odd rows get 15. Since we set the rows, you can use it anywhere."
