funny,fcn9mh6,t1_fcmzxdj,1577806789.0,"I figured this was a case of specific issues that applied to you as a user. I too am not a fan of the white UI that they definitely do not intend to change since they're eventually dropping the product. Discovery has greatly improved though. However, I am not a fan of discovery on most platforms, they still lack the finesse and personalization a human has. 

>  a lot of my songs were no longer available or were replaced with different versions that I hadn't added to my playlists.

This would have driven me away from the platform in a flash. I have been a GPM user for ages with over 40k songs in my library and never experienced this issue, or at least that I have noticed. I would have been outraged. Have any specific examples of songs that changed? I would be interested in checking my library to see if this has occurred to me.

That said, I cannot stand YTM's limited selection. A **VAST** majority of my library **still** isn't available on YTM. My playlists still haven't migrated, and the suggestions I receive don't seem tailored to me in anyway. The one feature I do like is as you mentioned, if it isn't available, I can find the video. Granted, that's at a cost of audio quality.

I actually signed back up for Spotify and began migrating my playlists and library over to it in fear of when GPM would shut down. I was in the early beta for YTM and it's shocking how little it has improved since then. I have some issues with Spotify, but nothing that has been so significant that I don't think it's the superior music streaming service."
