Try community college or take a year gap and figure out what you want to do and be. Save some money come back stronger. Take an internship and try figuring out if it fits for you."

I'm a junior in college in international business, I started out applying to another university because I didn't have the proper grade required to enter the university. I went every month to the counselor of the university I wanted to transfer and eventually they allowed me to transfer with a certain amount of credits required. I recommend you do the same, head to the university counselor and ask."
