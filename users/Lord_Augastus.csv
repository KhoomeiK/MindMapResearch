No, Halo is the first time I decided not to buy 15 dollar single maps, just so I can play Multiplayer ay.....they locke me out. 

No mans sky released as a beta, then after some time and a dlc they fixed their game and now its actually liked, but the point remains, games are sold as full products when they are almost beta like, in the process of being compelted. And its all possible with more dlc money or something. 

Assasins creed was like arkam, but later regularly releases had packs, and preorder bonuses and dlc and microtransactions. So ya know, I can quote great games too, Metro, Bioshock, Witcher, Skyrim, nfs shift and Undergound, gta 4 had the best dlc imo, for the same price they were selling sinlge maps for cod, gta 4 devs gave us 2 more campaigns essentially. To this day makes me happy, the point still stands, EA was either strong armed by Disney or investors to make a great game as their track record in last year with Anthem. In fact anthem is a prime example with industires problem, at least those who partake in these exploitative shady anti fan practices. Anthem released as overhyped under delivered mess, that had weekly updates that seemingly had players go from one fucked thing devs did to the next, as like, game testers are put through to fine tune the games mechanics for the market. Released as full game with day one dlc, locked contented behind microtransactions and massive grind that mathematically couldnt pay for the costs of the 'cosmetics'. Game itself was a shell of what it could b or promised to be. and 1 of devs came out that 'they' have finishers, people who come in take the game and smash it into an online game thing with monetization.

Just because there is a ton of money being soent on them, doesnt mean they work if they are out dated , do not provide opportunities for self growth and alck fo social support. Like for example you mentioned addiction, great, it has been shown that by treating addiction as a medical and not a criminal issue, by removing the stigma of getting help, people do genuenly try and population improves. Systemic change is needed, as long as attitudes like yours prevail, nobody cant be helped as attitudes like yours not only put those who are addicted and lazy and criminal will forever stay in that cycle and worse keep dragging more helpless souls down with them. It will never be enough to just through money at these problems, social, communities, policing, laws, social identity and values need to be there as well. Capitalism as a form of social system has failed, it has failed all arpund developed world as seen by skyrocketed depression and suicide rates, but that alone isnt the issue as many countries have social services and have far less issues whilst also having capitalist marketplace. So my point isnt that there needs to be more funding, there needs to be a systemic change about how governance, sociaty and economy work together, as atm, sure tons of money is being spent, but clearly with resentment, this outward disgust with it, is stoppong open dialouge from happeningz preventing people getting help, and encouraging self loathing that drugs and crime bring to communities."

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,ferr1w2,t1_feqltci,1579357369.0,"Actually I think gta 6 will have no story because of multuiple reasons:

1. trend to DRM games into a service, aka online only helps fight piracy, have stable income from dlc etc. tred is moving that way, because its th eonly way drm can work. Whilst also giving most profit

2. gta online has become a huge steaming pile of built code ontop of cde, mechanic ontop of mechanic. Years of development, and we have freemode coop mission right now. People pvping, doing heist prep, work, girind, cheallenges, cfreate their own fun with cafr meets etc. 

So the game will not need offline, as everyone would be able to do the heists, and cuts cenes and story together or alone, (i hope alone, as atm having 4 people for origional lester heists is a fuck, and doomsday...most of it can eb done with a single person, so im thankful they made that and casino heists a 2 people thing!

3. Will there be a campaign in gta 6, i hope so. if rdr2 is to go by, there is no shortage from the management to keep some semblance of storytelling art that R* used to be known for alive. Single player isnt dead, and with games liek rdr and gta creating the map and mechanics needs something to bounce off. Story makes sense. Online is just a beast that if going by how they have changed experience, is that at least gta 6 will be more ambitious with its freemode. There is no reason not to have a single player story and multiplayer alive world at the same time. It would help as well, as for the time being since launch freemode has been the most stable thing, having to navigate to and from lobbies for majority of time creates a shit ton of connection issues. thats my thought process.

We have faster computers, and more money, and yet games come out rushed almost as if thy were still in beta. And then the team continues to 'develop' then for years after release testing and resetting, and updating until an official ""release"". R* has gotten away with this in gta online and rdr2, because they have good people left who beleive in some campaign purity, but online components....oh boy. Modern games release online as beta states, advertising full price exprieince, but then delivering that ""full"" expirience only after years fo dlc, content etc. Which is fine if they advertised it as much, but they didnt. No man sky, destiny, gta, fortnight, all EA titles, are all essentially a beta state game, that is built as community and developers discover it. So now we are paying MORE, for LESS, whilst also being beta testers, and get lied to. 

I have no idea why you think it costs more to develop a game nowadays, when technology says otherwise, but it does take a lot to appease greedy vile publishers from butchering games into pay2play mechanic. So, unless you rememeber how gta changed after the lead on it left, and then single player dlc got frankensteined into onlien dlc, which took then fucking years and we are still getting it, and then you remember all the reports of underpaid and undervalued staff on rdr2 development, you would realise that greed has overcome creativity and user experience.   

As for 2003 comment, your naivety stems from being stuck in 2013? its 2019, games are so much cheaper to make, even with cgi and motion capture. Its just that big companies siphon talent and bureaucracy kills creativity and thats why EA keeps killing developers. thats why gta online was a fuck for years, and thats why rdr2 online is worse as trying to recreate gta online in rdr2 is a fuck.

If africa can make worlds largest dam that will alter rivers and topography of nile into egyot, china has built a great wall of trees to hold back a desert. Cloud seeding has been done for a long time, and last year america got hit in the same place 3 times in a row. China alone pumped so much smug that it was visible from space and in the last 12 months, we had tons of largest fires in last decades in all major continent amazons, australia, russia, canada, usa mainly california. So there is no doubt on my mind humanity is capable of planetary geoengineering, we have demonstrated it.

So 'who done the rain' fuck knows, but I am sure as hell will be labeled some sort od conspiracy theorist, because ya know, progress waits for nobody."

SciFiScroll,fek5i0u,t3_ep6ako,1579193033.0,"Weeping angels is precisely why i staryed to watch dr who regularly. Last season i tuned out and forgot about, episode 1 of spyfall i also tuned out. The  article put it nicely, the story isnt there, charecters are overburden the plot and this weeks social drama narrative over scifi threat is equally distracting. Lessons are better served if audience gets the moral of the story, not if its bashed into the narrative like a 5th grade trying to hammer  two rocks together.

Seriously, I get it you wanted to male female dr who lead, you did. In the process you fucked up what dr who was about and continued to do so this season. In comparison having sonic screw driver turn into sonic glassess seems like a more dr who thing than having a female dr who who acts like lgtbq groupie than a eons old time treveler. Now dr who is eartha protector or something. Lack of offworld adventures is troublesome, and forced 'message' as a plot, is just not good writing.

Basically, if they wanted female dr who, they had the option of continuing doctors daughter story, could have dont a verse thing with her getting her owm show. But no, lets take existing formulah, throw it out, amd fuck shit up with garbage driven story to shove some agenda down our throats. I dont get it, i really dont. I am not even going to bother trying again with this show ay. Clearly its done for till they get new cast, wroters and directors..."

lifehacks,fejmvpn,t3_eph1hh,1579180234.0,"I will quote the human rights violations moderators on reddit are guilty of: ""reddit is a private company, it can do what it likes"" without transperency with financial records, these 'donations' have no way of being guaranteed in whole or in part to the cause. With no oversight, this site that has been peddling propoganda for years, suppressing free speech and controlling what gets promoted to the front page and what gets suppressed, there is no guarantees what funds will actually go to 'firefighters'. The point is, reddit went from crying about money, to having so many different monetisation options, ontop of being an active participant in for profit media agendas and advertising. This is a for profit buissness, there is a long line of skimming from donation drives. Without transperency and active follow up, there is no way of knowing if funds go where the people donating think they go.

My 2c worth, as I have recently come to realisarion of how much good will is wasted on buerocracy of for profit society we live in. And reddit is no different, no matter how much you believe otherwise, as without transperency there is no hope of truth, and with transperency there is always deception. 

Edit: half goes to reddit, there knew it. Scum. Donate directly."

russia,feihq3b,t3_ep6ftc,1579138798.0,"Since 00s Putin's gov tried to reform the constitution so that russia isnt under the thumb of western banking cabal. Just as in america FAD reserve is owned by private entity not beholden to the gov and doesnt owe any transparency to anyone, so it happened in russia under pact of capitalisation. Current Russian constitution restricts alot of the gov power in governing the state. Like being tied to western monetary sstem, plunged russian  Ruble into hyper inflation, sanctions, US weaponised dollar, the contriction of monetary flow within russia. US can pint money out fo thin air to ""stimulate the economy"", but russia has a limited cash flow and so cant just dump money into the system like US has been doing for decades. Now that russia is back and pact of capitalisation has ended in 15 the only way to ""change the constitution"" is to do this hoopti loop with gov resignation... as the old gov was built on western ideals as soviet union collapsed. 

You see in america its built on a failed notion of free market. Sure, capitalism is great for marketplaces, creates competition, ownership, market forces drive supply and demand. Society isnt a marketplace, governance of civility and society has more to it than pure capitalist ideals. Russia has been struggling in getting some of that freedom that a sovereign state enjoys (like owning a state bank....having it be beholden to the country, not rothschilds). 

But hey, if this endeavour creates another stalin,  sure this meme makes sense. But from the last 28 years of russian development and the stark contrast to 00s putin leadership change vs 90s, I believe that this is being done so that russian government gets a lot more power than they have now, through a new constitution. But hey, to the western audience, aka redditors, who actively stood against Sopa an PIPA that aimed to give corporations power over states, it must not compute the process of reforming a gov system..... After all, UK, US, Can, AUs have all been functioning on USD and US leadership model since the 60s and change is therefore going to be near impossible. Where as russia had a revolution in early 1900s, then systemic change after ww2 right up till soviet collapse of 90s. Change for russian people, and government is just part of the process. Where as western nations just aimed their guns at liberties and shot past into federalist ideals of class elitism and socialism for the rich."
