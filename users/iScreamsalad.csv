worldnews,feeuf73,t1_feeuagm,1579041441.0,"I know, or better said expected, what you would say. I was more interested if you were aware of reports or studies pointing to increased droughts. I assumed you’d have seen a few in your research regarding china’s cloud seeding."
worldnews,feet9e4,t1_feesvi2,1579040727.0,So are they experiencing more drought conditions?
worldnews,feeqm72,t1_feeqems,1579039133.0,Not unprecedented but seemingly unwarranted. Could it not be that the upward trend in global average temperature has more to die with disturbed air currents and droughts than relatively recent and localized cloud seeding in China? Also why would China need to cloud seed? Are they experiencing more droughts as well?
worldnews,feenru9,t1_feejqe7,1579037489.0,You hope

worldnews,feel32u,t1_feeklwr,1579035932.0,"Coinciding with record high temperatures? I’d venture to say yes. As for cloud seeding in China, cloud seeding doesn’t draw in moisture from across the ocean it just quickens the condensation of moisture already in the air into clouds. 

Do you have any sources correlating cloud seeding in China with less rain in Australia?"
worldnews,feehath,t1_feecp52,1579033740.0,The changes in climate like increased heat and prolonged times of drought didn’t cause the fire but it did set the groundwork for the fires being as intense as they are

videos,fedkn71,t1_fedj4o6,1579013892.0,Not “mistakenly”. Deceived. Rape is when someone forces sex on another without consent. The lady didn’t consent to having sex with this guy. That’s rape
videos,fedkkaa,t1_fedk941,1579013837.0,I’d say it’s because of the layers of trauma. A person beats you senseless. That can be jarring you might even have a lasting effect like a limp or head aches. But a rape cuts both physically and psychologically. “Is this person I just met just acting nice but is secretly a rapist like the other one?” “Was it really my fault that I was raped?” Etc etc

For example a disruption of the Gulf Stream that carries warm equatorial water to Western Europe would dramatically drop the air temperature of that region iirc. But it wouldn’t likely change the upward trend of global average temperature
