The low framerate, the spin, the zoom, and it just goes on forever. The first time it happened I passed a blunt with some friends at a party(my first time ever having nicotine) I still don't remember a lot about that night, but they said I went full meerkat and described it as ""falling in 3 dimensions""."

So at the end of 2019 we were at 9.999(cont) years. And therefore,at the kickoff of 2020, we rolled over to 10 even."
Narcolepsy,fdgtfg7,t1_fdgnn18,1578407869.0,"God, what a life! That's exactly why I've thought about getting a bike. I only commute about 15 minutes to work, but first thing in the morning, sitting down, in my quiet car, going 45, even with the radio blaring I feel like I'm on the verge of nodding off. My cats are usually only triggered by extreme laughter or extreme anger, so I dont feel like any surprise break checks or cut offs would drop me, at least they haven't yet. And actively gripping onto a bike, changing gears, leening to steer instead of just moving my arms, I feel like it would he more engaging and help to keep me awake.

I also used to do downhill longboarding as a hobby. Skirting down a hill at 25-35 mph with nothing between your face and the road but a chunk of plywood and some plastic wheels, and never had any issue with cats then."
