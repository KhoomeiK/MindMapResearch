There were also dictatorial types regimes for a few years in between wherein they tried forced family planning by nuetering men in rural areas. But India being a democracy those people were soon voted out and forced family planning was one of the factors that led to their wide infamy. 

Anyways 20-30 years of rigorous campaigns and Indians have largely migrated to 2 children system. And what was the issue then, i.e massive population, is the strength now with India being the largest pool of youth in the world currently. 

We don't often understand or know the consequences of our decisions when we make them. They seem right in the short term, and a pool of people support it as the best measure. But  sometimes it's best to leave things to be rather than try to correct it."

beholdthemasterrace,fckdhrx,t1_fck1kk3,1577722880.0,"I am guessing you deleted your first comment, but I read the other two and I'd like to answer. Objectively. 

I was born during apartheid. It was horrible and thus my family moved away from there. Years later I returned, it is home after all, worked, made friends, and now I co own a house with a white person in a predominantly colored neighborhood. 

When we were buying the house my friend's parents were very concerned and without actually saying it what they meant was that while it was okay for me (I am coloured), it is not for their white child. I wanted to buy and went ahead anyways, and at some point friend joined in against parent's wishes. It was the first white owner in the neighborhood but now there are plenty. 

Now to answer your question, apartheid ended because whites voted against it. Mind u no other race besides whites had voting rights then. So yes u r right, not all Germans are Nazis, not all Jews hate Palestinian and so on. 

Now move forward to current times. When apartheid ended, whites had the choice to move to whatever they considered as their country of origin (in Europe) or continue to live in SA or have dual citizenship of that country if that country allows it that is. Needless to say in a world where Israel can be made in the middle of Arabian peninsula for the fault of Germany, a white country, Europe was more than glad to extend citizenships to fellow white South Africans. And whites living in SA continue to enjoy this privilege. Most hold dual citizenship, if not they can easily migrate to any white country. In recent times besides Europe, New Zealand has come up as a big hub for this. 

In the last 20 years a lot of whites, especially those who were from working families, left SA. Working class whites also formed the majority that voted apartheid out. The whites that are still in SA are primarily the land owners. Because land couldn't be sold to locals, they don't have enough money, and you can't pack land in a suitcase and take it with you. But landowners, the world over, are often the more conservative ones. So even in SA these were the ardent supporters of apartheid, these were the ones left behind, and these are the guys who are getting murdered. Most of these murders are revenge killing of the times when apartheid was still there and these landowners were responsible for some seriously heinous things. Besides SA is a large country and farmlands are often very aloof so they also become easy target. However to say that every white is a target is blatantly incorrect."

But people r fucking idiots and that's why SA is projected as a genocidal nation. Alas.
beholdthemasterrace,fcjtk63,t1_fcjt5mu,1577704006.0,"That's not how I meant. I meant the percentage fall in economics. For ex if whites controlled 80% of wealth then, they hold say 72% now. Still the highest but the largest loss of 10% compared to any other race. Whereas if the Indians held say 5% then, and it is now at say 6% then they gained most with 20% rise.

This just shows how quickly things change when u give people equal opportunities. Whites lost because the rider that gave them preferential rights went away. And other races gained because they were finally playing on fair terms. 

Edit: is this the wrong sub to talk sense? Why the downvotes?"
beholdthemasterrace,fcjtg71,t1_fcjrth7,1577703845.0,"To answer the question, there's no genocide happening in SA. However crime rate there is very high. Some of the reasons being years of oppression,  abject poverty, and lack of education and resultant unemployment among blacks. 

Till apartheid, Blacks had no freedom and whites were well protected. However now blacks can move freely which has put some wealthy white farmers, living in remote places at risk of retribution, especially from the local community which their fathers and grandfather's generation has actively abused.

It is sad, however as far as percentage of murders are concerned, blacks are murdered way more than whites, simple reason being they live in unsafe areas and often become easy victimsas. On the other hand every white murder gets international exposure from white media. 

On the sidenote: Oscar Pistorius, the blade runner, murdered his girlfriend at the time. The ongoing joke in the country is that if Oscar was dating a colored girl, by now Trump would've intervened to set him free for murder."

Indian news is dominated by brutal incidents of rapes, latest being the veterinarian burnt to death and then the blatant killing of the culprits by state sponsored mafias and the whole country hailing the tit-for-tat. In short neither the culprits cared for the law, nor did the state. 

The only other place where rape has been part of national news in the recent times was Hong Kong where protestors who were arrested were raped and killed by their police. Enough Hong Kong posts were removed by mods however for reasons very different from whatever is it that u r insinuating. 

Now unless u have incidents, screenshots etc. to prove the point. You can maybe stop."
