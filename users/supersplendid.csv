You may also want to grab a copy of any settings / configuration for the relevant applications. These will usually be identifiable somewhere within the system and/or user `Library` folders."

Proxmox,fcn53uv,t3_ei2jyb,1577803503.0,"I tackled this exact issue recently.

Within Proxmox, make sure your guests:-

* are using the VirtIO SCSI disk controller (as you state)
* have the *Discard* option enabled on their disk(s)

Now, assuming your guests are Linux, you can manually initiate a trim from within the guest, using:

`sudo fstrim -av`

If you were to backup your guest now, you should see  the backup size is much more reasonable.

However, as you mention, you really want the trim to be performed periodically and automatically. If your guest is using systemd, you probably already have a systemd timer unit, `fstrim.timer`, to do this, although it may not yet be enabled.

You can check the status of this timer with:

`systemctl status fstrim.timer`

If you see it's inactive and/or disabled, you can enable and start it with:-

`sudo systemctl enable fstrim.timer`

`sudo systemctl start fstrim.timer`

And check when the timer last ran and will run next, using:

`systemctl list-timers --all`

The timer is typically set to run once a week, which should be fine for most purposes."
