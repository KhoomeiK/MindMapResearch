overcoming,ff4bszi,t1_ff1sdgh,1579559928.0,"Thanks, youâ€™re right I can disclose as much as Iâ€™d like. I sometimes struggle to know when itâ€™s appropriate with people and can either be totally closed off or say too much too fast. 

I am working on building my life as safe and comfortable as possible now. :)"
overcoming,ff4bovj,t1_ff1zqkg,1579559855.0,"Thanks, thatâ€™s a good idea! I do have to tell people I would prefer them to not pity me but itâ€™s sweet that they care."
flexibility,ff1q0mr,t1_fez6vnp,1579483627.0,"Yeah, having 30-degree scoliosis is what led to my pronounced lordosis/ anterior pelvic tilt. I'd imagine there have to be many other cases like that."
AskDocs,feil45z,t1_feiijd4,1579141057.0,"GI - anxiety is generally managed but I'm a student so I definitely have stressors. 

Acne - I haven't seen a derm in a while since my psoriasis has been in remission for a while and I have access to a script of hydrocortisone, but I am on a waitlist to see one for acne. I'll try some BP, probably at a low % since I have really sensitive skin.

Infections - I had tinea versicolor about 6 months ago that cleared up with that shampoo stuff. I've talked to gynos before about my hygiene and they said I follow proper hygiene but I had BV this summer and have had Candida overgrowth a few times, not just vaginally. 

Existing - yes I'm sure, I had a scan done. It's in my jaw due to TMJD/bruxism.

Drugs - my use was long ago and very little, not in past year, I don't plan on using at all again. 

Diet - I cook most of my meals and eat more plants than most people I know, so I know the occasional snack that I have shouldn't be causing these issues. If anything, I suspect an underlying intolerance to nightshades or gluten or something.



I will talk to a rheumatologist, thanks!"

NatureIsFuckingLit,fefgouf,t1_fefe83d,1579055945.0,"There were at least 100,000 First Nations people living in Canada before the colonizers arrived, and thatâ€™s a conservative estimate. 

Some researchers say the population was 500,000 in the Pacific Northwest alone.

NatureIsFuckingLit,fefflin,t1_feet1rc,1579055291.0,"European settlers purposefully killed them off to starve the First Nations people who lived there and reduce their access to resources. Their goal was to weaken them - physically, economically, culturally - so the new colony would have stronger bargaining power."
netflixwitcher,fe48c0i,t3_en7r8s,1578856736.0,"It's possible to change. Even if all you've ever known was the darkness. Our minds have neuroplasticity and can continue to learn new ways of life and thinking our whole lives. You just need to do the work to change your habits, which usually happens from a kick-in-the-butt moment like this that motivates you because you know deep down you are capable of moving forward with your life.

I got out of lifelong depression with SSRIs and cognitive-behavioural therapy, but your road might look different than mine. I hope you find out what works for you, and good luck on your journey :)

Just remember that recovery isn't linear and setbacks can happen, just have compassion for yourself and work on being better tomorrow."
netflixwitcher,fe43ezb,t1_fe3qqml,1578855415.0,Especially since Geralt was totally projecting onto Jaskier for his own choices!
interestingasfuck,fe3u1r8,t1_fe0uwvy,1578852872.0,I hope you will be ok after these fires. Whatâ€™s happening is a tragedy and thereâ€™s not enough attention to how itâ€™s affecting /will affect indigenous people and way of life.
relationships,fcvdy2v,t1_fcvdhcz,1578000087.0,"Yeah exactly, we've hung out alone maybe 2-3x. She came back this week and seems kind of weird over text, she's using a lot of ""I guess"" and ""hmm"" over text. Normally we make space for each other to grab coffee or lunch before our shifts since I couldn't hang out on her day off, but she hasn't responded to any bids for days that could work, and seems mad that I couldn't hang out on that one day."
relationships,fcvd2z2,t1_fcvcqo0,1577999571.0,"The ""bad night"" was halloween, and we re-connected mid/late-November. I had exams after that so we didn't hang out much and then she left for Christmas to be with her boyfriend."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fctp2fz,t1_fctovdq,1577952310.0,"Thanks for the pic! I prefer mine to be thinner for vanity reasons, usually go to Costco and pay ~$200. Still worth considering as a student lol."

todayilearned,fce2kmj,t1_fcd3u7x,1577616315.0,"Ehh.. Iâ€™d say itâ€™s more passive than active. 

Compared to many countries Canada looks like itâ€™s friendly to itâ€™s native citizens. 

But we have barely implemented UNDRIP and have a long way to go as far as real reconciliation and indigenous resurgence goes."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fc7trbq,t1_fc7skhp,1577518418.0,Always love seeing Feed Me on my feed. Even if itâ€™s not a great one..
gatekeeping,fc6jns3,t1_fc5f4um,1577482174.0,"Yeah Iâ€™ve gotten it managed with benzoyl peroxide during breakouts and minimal products rest of the time bc my face is sensitive. I have hormonal acne and Iâ€™ve seen dermatologists, thankfully itâ€™s not bad as it has been. 

My point was that even when people follow proper routines (with derm recommendations/meds) they can have acne. Itâ€™s not all hygiene.. itâ€™s often genetics, hormones, food intolerance, etc. And it can be hurtful when people assume my acne is from being dirty or lazy or uneducated on skincare."
gatekeeping,fc1ao9f,t1_fbyxiah,1577313106.0,"Yeah I canâ€™t use coconut oil because it clogs my pores, donâ€™t worry I follow a proper skincare routine and do lots of research. Acne is often hormonal."
YouShouldKnow,fbydgne,t1_fbxmv7l,1577214135.0,"One thing I learned from living with GAD my whole life is that itâ€™s bigger in my mind. It sounds dumb but once you make the choice and set a plan to do it, the change isnâ€™t so scary as when it was this nebulous thought that you had no idea how to implement."
YouShouldKnow,fbydals,t1_fbxzj9z,1577214016.0,I find almond milk is the most watery of all the non-dairy milks. Have you tried a chocolate oat beverage? SO GOOD.
YouShouldKnow,fbyd5jp,t1_fbxfuez,1577213917.0,I dunno man all the B&J and other non-dairy ice creams taste exactly the same to me and hit the spot.

HumansBeingBros,f995448,t1_f98ug5s,1575187187.0,"I totally relate. My father growing up was homeless, mentally ill, and addicted to heroin. I lived for others my whole life in what I thought was empathy but might have been more like martyrdom. 
I have since learned how to place boundaries (not only with others but myself too), so that I can sit with somebodyâ€™s pain and not lose myself in it anymore."
