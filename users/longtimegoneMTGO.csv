Those two things go together a lot of the time. You don't often hear about someone who was assaulted by a stranger in broad daylight on a busy street. 

Most of the time, someone getting assaulted by a stranger isn't just some random occurrence, but part of an attempted mugging or other crime. People who commit these sorts of crimes would prefer not to be caught, so they look for victims in locations where they are isolated, as in your dim alleyway example. 

Women get taught from a fairly young age to constantly avoid situations like this, which would seem likely to reduce their chances of being involved in this sort of crime.

Worth noting, grapefruit interacts with a lot of different medications, in some cases reducing the effectiveness of those medications, and in others greatly increasing their effect as well as related side effects. 

The reason it can make drugs either more or less effective has to do with the grapefruit decreasing the activity of certain enzymes that in some cases are responsible for clearing drugs out of your system, and in other cases needed to break down the drug you take into the active form your body is able to process.

I've read articles based on real life testing that showed the opposite of this. In their testing, parts printed at .3 layer height were 24 percent stronger than the same part printed at .1 layer height. 

It comes down to bonding, faster cooling results in weaker prints, and thicker layers take longer to cool than thinner ones. It is possible to print thinner layers and still get good strength, but it requires significantly increasing printing temperature. 

Another easy method to increase part strength by getting better layer bonding is to print lines that are thicker than the opening of your nozzle. IIRC, the strongest parts they tested were printed at 150 percent of the nozzle size."

There is nothing sinister happening there, it's just the market at work.

For a very long time, there wasn't a lot of domestic demand for used tractors, which drove the prices down. I used to know someone who's whole business was buying used tractors and shipping them to Thailand to be resold, and it was quite profitable. It wasn't anything he was being paid by the tractor manufacturers to do, there was just much more demand over there for used equipment compared to here so he could make good money on the difference in price."

That's not really true, mechanics are often not linked to a particular plane. As an example, Convoke was first seen on Ravnica, but the next time we saw it was in Future Sight, and after that in M15


Realistically, you won't see these again the next time we return to ravnica. In the three trips to the plane, only Convoke has been used more than once.

Some mechanics do end up getting linked to a particular plane such as Landfall and Zendikar, but it is not the default."
MagicArena,fdf5bfs,t1_fdebg1d,1578353652.0,"Because surveil isn't an evergreen mechanic, and it is not one of this set's mechanics. 

That is just how they do it, it's for the sake of simplicity. You know what surveil does, but putting it on the cards would require everyone who plays this set in limited to know as well.

Instead, when something is only going to appear one one or two cards, they will just spell out the effect in the card text rather than having a confusing mess of keywords and abilities that only appear on one or two cards. There are plenty of examples of this, a recent example would be Makeshift Battalion from war of the spark that had the Battalion ability word.

It's less of an issue with something like Arena where the cards are going to work correctly regardless of if the players understand them or not, but it's a complexity issue for paper."

The most likely reason is because the set had a 2hg theme, due to the Surge mechanic, but because MTGO had implemented 2hg in a sort of hacky way that didn't match with the actual rules, this didn't work. In real 2hg, the players take one shared turn, but on MTGO they just had them take back to back individual turns. 

Since it was never a particularly popular format, they just dropped it rather than redo it it to work correctly or deal with a bunch of complaints about cards that didn't work as they should."

Not exactly, but it's close enough that plenty of people use it with COE 33 glass.

It's not a perfect match, so there are issues with stability if it's not handled right. Since you can't anneal away all the stress, it helps to encase it under a decent amount of glass to help give more structural stability in spite of the internal stress. 

All that said, I think this particular piece might be only opal and no glass, fused together with an optically clear UV cure resin, I know people do layered laminated dichroic work that way."
