JUSTNOMIL,fdjhvu2,t1_fdgvpeu,1578471535.0,"You certainly understand.  And yes on generations & yes on my Dad‚Äôs bad childhood & my mom‚Äôs strong mother.  As sad as it is to see the number of families affected, I‚Äôm glad to see open communication on this more exposed subject.  Wish I had the info & support decades ago."
JUSTNOMIL,fdjhovw,t3_elefs3,1578471285.0,"Enthusiasm can lead to poor judgement.  You said she appears to not have much confidence & is always over-interactive to make up for it.  So she goofed.  She also may have a very diff view of marriage, like babies right away.  My own MIL wanted me to wear to work at a Wall Street financial business a maternity dress she wore 30 years prior in the mid-50‚Äôs.  I could see she thought me ungrateful but there was no way.  Plus I‚Äôm a full 1/2 foot taller & built longer.  

Yes, it was awkward.  But she owns that, not you.  You have to own whether you showed her dignity & respect (mistakes included) in public.  You are in charge of how you handled yourself.  

Now what‚Äôs done is done.  You might consider finding a quiet moment with no one around for an audience to return her wedding night nightgown with a brief & kind explanation.  Idk, something like I get uncomfortable wearing confining clothes while I sleep or, my gyn says it‚Äôs a bad practice to wear other women‚Äôs lingerie or better, I knew this was important enough for you to keep this all these years.  I cannot use it, but appreciate your willingness to share it with me.  I wanted you to have this back for safe keeping.  

Maybe AFTER the wedding another quiet time to confirm BY YOUR HUSBAND, since he must manage his family, to relate the absolute necessity of not planning events you & he agreed not to have & no surprises where if you did have something, your input is required like timing, theme, sizes, invitee list.  

Yes a wedding is a particularly high emotion time with so much planning, so many moving parts & so many participant & sooo much money devoted to it.  It‚Äôs very easy to get caught up in wanting things to go perfectly.  This obviously did not.  Unless you really believe her intent had malice, perhaps her excitement & desire to participate over-rode her judgement.  No one can blame that on you so long as you were clear & consistent.  But perhaps you‚Äôre reacting to all the pressure & expectations when in fact, you‚Äôre able to let this go with character.  I would solicit your husband‚Äôs help in establishing some boundaries to prevent hard feelings in the future.  Boundaries, spoken kindly with good intentions go a long way to preserving relationships.  You‚Äôre just beginning.  Maybe look at this gaff as her one Mulligan and move forward from there.  It‚Äôs not worth wasting time on since it‚Äôs done.  Just have a plan to divest yourself of the old gown & to establish future guidelines.  

Now, if all goes south from here on out, you‚Äôll know whether or not to take more drastic steps.  What you‚Äôve described imo, is a socially awkward lady trying to find her way with a married son & new DIL.  BEST WISHES & good weather"

relationship_advice,fdgf6yc,t3_el4s3p,1578393983.0,"Wish there was some way for your mom to find the email herself.  She deserves to know.  IF their marriage can be saved, addressing the infidelity sooner rather than later is best.   No matter how she learns it, the news will be humiliating.  I‚Äôd want my daughters to tell me the facts.  No judgement, no embellishment, just the facts.  Then let me take it from there.  It‚Äôs really best, imo, if you‚Äôre not involved, like forcing your dad to tell.  There‚Äôs an issue already for sure. Sometimes spouses wrongly go outside the marriage looking for answers.  The only answers are inside.  Give your mom the facts then let her draw her own conclusions.  If ANYONE tries to say you busted up the family, just know that‚Äôs not true.  You‚Äôre trying to bring sanity & honesty to it. That‚Äôs all.  Support both parents, even though they‚Äôll both likely have or will do something not cool.  Give them both the benefit of dealing with this themselves once outed."

Several of her & their friends knew & said zilch.  In the course of discovering him out she found a friend had cheated on her husband with him. She told.  She was treated like a monster.  Of course she‚Äôd been thinking how badly she needed others to care enough about her to speak up. She lost 7 years of her prime on this cheat & found-out pervert.

JUSTNOMIL,fdgdkue,t3_el385y,1578391692.0,"Your story has caused me to want to share my experience with boundaries & my folks.  My dad was actually diagnosed as a malignant narcissist. Pretty out there on the scale.  (I‚Äôll put this all together soon with what caught me ear) Narcissistic ppl are typically married to enablers who do the bidding of the narcissist when he/she isn‚Äôt successful manipulating a situation to their favor.  Sure, we all manipulate others to some degree & our SO‚Äôs will likely help out.  The difference is the agenda is about the narcissist, it‚Äôs persistent & the needs of others be damned.  The enabler (my mom in my case) typically gets all the family sympathy for being ‚Äúcaught in the middle‚Äù or for taking the brunt.  BUT, and I know this from my own family, the enabler, which I see as your FIL, is just as guilty of hurting the family by the enabling & promoting the narcissist‚Äôs agenda, thereby promoting the incessant hurts.  Actually, the enabler, usually calmer & nicer at other times, is the more skilled manipulator,!They keep peace with the narcissist, inducing others to comply in the belief that they are not party to the hurt and will defend the hurtful, blaming person bc they have been made into a believer & are having to hear all about it.  I mean, what else do they hear? (They also know you are likely more sympathetic towards them) 

My father was a narcissist with a temper.  He controlled us four women, mom & 3 daughters, with intimidation, fear & use of temper which he applied to my mom to get her to be his enforcer so he didn‚Äôt have to make those repeated phone calls etc.  She knew full well the misery she expected us to participate in by abiding by my Dad‚Äôs wishes to do this or that or come do this or that or to behave like this or that or give up this or that etc etc.  

I‚Äôm the youngest.  I was in my 30‚Äôs when it struck me how she was willing to see us go down like this.  (Yet at 6 I stood 3 feet from my sister being beat with a horse whip for a smart remark she ‚Äúwouldnt take back‚Äù. My mom was right there.  She did not protect my sister from a beating that this day & time he‚Äôd be prosecuted for & she‚Äôd loose to CPS over, nor did she shield me.  I learned right then to comply, comply, comply.). Late, she even expected my kids, her grandchildren to obey ridiculous demands. 

I‚Äôm not saying your situation is as abusive as mine but I wanted to share that a big trap is believing the enabling spouse is somehow less guilty of imposing hurt bc they‚Äôre more in the background, or don‚Äôt initiate the same hurts or portray themselves as so-called peace-keepers.  They are not peace keepers.  They are abetting. They are directly involved in manipulating others into compliance.  

As for your SO, let me share that it‚Äôs never too late to redefine boundaries that should‚Äôve been there the whole time.  A family dealing with a parent like this must have a consistent, united front & like your wife is doing, don‚Äôt engage in the irrational behavior or some distracting details or convo. It‚Äôs a purposely set trap, a strategy, designed to keep one off guard & unable to protect oneself, even to the point where one is characterized as the bad guy (your wife is being told how bad SHE is).  It‚Äôs a tactic, plain & simple, which works well on unknowing folks (new boyfriend/husband) and particularly well on children conditioned into compliance bc children believe what they‚Äôre told about themselves.  (You don‚Äôt love me & are a bad, rude daughter unless you answer every phone call.  Of course, rationally you know that‚Äôs not true). 

Objectively, if a friend asked your wife what she thought about someone doing that to her, she‚Äôd know it‚Äôs not right and that her friend was completely just and a good person if she established boundaries.  But when you‚Äôre raised like that and already have a pattern of compliance, breaking free of those bonds is really tough.  

It is possible, possible to have an adult-to-adult relationship, newly defined with boundaries that allow for a great relationship.  The stars have to align, like getting educated, having full support, even writing out & rehearsing your new responses & establishing exact, no-exception, boundaries.  I had to finally realize that after 30, 40, yes, 50 years of marriage that my enabling mom wasn‚Äôt going to be able to help herself or me in redefining our relationship with my dad and, this is important, she had begun to believe like him years ago.  She bought into a non-compliant adult child with her own family & responsibilities was not a good daughter.  She either had to buy-in or never be able to live with the dissonance.  From about age 13 I prayed my parents would divorce.  That mightve been early enough for my mom to break free of the daily grind down & influence.   We‚Äôll never know. 

Now, let me add, that in my family, my older sisters didn‚Äôt ever ‚Äúget it‚Äù. One just cut herself off from our dad but still told him how she loved him. Made my mom‚Äôs life worse trying to be the middle person bc this sibling never was able to deal face to face setting boundaries or state her case.  Therefore my dad justified her distance (to anyone who‚Äôd listen) as something that was wrong with HER!  Her early life conditioning of total compliance or affection & approval would be withheld, was just too strong.  My other sibling also never told the truth & was my mother‚Äôs enabler, many times goading me into compliance to spare my mother my narcissistic Dad‚Äôs ire. For one ex: At my own house when in my mid thirties she took over an activity (training my animal!) that I said I wasn‚Äôt gonna do yet & certainly not during their short visit.   My dad had demanded it even though we were all gathered for R&R together, just 48 hours in six months.  I did not go outside, nor did my kids.  My mom fretted & cried, worried about Dad‚Äôs reaction.  So my dad & 40 yo sister took OUR green stallion and worked on teaching him to ride for an hour without my permission.  Later we all heard how horrible I was to force my sister to do that! WTF?!?! Had that happened today, I would simply say that‚Äôs not in the plan- no further discussion or justification.  Then, anyone who insisted would be asked to leave.  I could & would be calm, not engage in why or any of that diversion tactic and most of all, show no concern over his, my mom‚Äôs or sister‚Äôs judgement for not dropping everything to go do that.  It was sad.  My young kids were neglected that afternoon bc they weren‚Äôt allowed to be around when training.  Seeing them & us was allegedly the reason for the visit.  The criticizing was non-stop for 3-4 hours.  Like I said, I eventually knew better & did better.  My mom died unexpectedly (another story)  then later for 7 years I cared for my dad BUT not til after I established a new relationship & enforced it without exception or weakness with my DH‚Äôs full support. (He‚Äôd finally gotten the point) 

In my later 40‚Äôs I‚Äôd finally ‚Äúgotten it‚Äù.  By then I‚Äôd allowed too much exposure to my children of this damaging dynamic.  It demeaned them & they saw me demeaned & my husband not helping to extract me (out of some maladaptive sense of honoring one‚Äôs parents) They are now, yrs later,  affected to some degree.  I‚Äôll always be affected since I was raised in it.  Im always working on my self-awareness.  Getting to a new place with my dad (missed out on mom.  Had just started but she died) was almost impossible since my own DH, who couldn‚Äôt conceive of this damaging kind of relationship (narcissists can be generous- but there‚Äôs a motive), so he questioned my ‚Äúgood daughter‚Äù status for over 20 yrs when I attempted to set boundaries & my siblings were zero help, even saboteurs many times.  Since I was onto my Dad‚Äôs illness & mom‚Äôs role, they worked on dividing us siblings to maintain as much control as possible.  We no longer speak-not my idea.  

I was pleased to read that you‚Äôre enthused by this new, likely overdue, response of your SO‚Äôs. It‚Äôs regrettable she had to be so bad off that day that her base level of self-survival is what kicked in.  Glad she has that instinct.  Often children of this dynamic loose that self-survival instinct for fear of reprisal or for being identified as selfish or ungrateful.  It gets pummeled out of them either physically or emotionally or both.  The hateful dynamic can be well camouflaged as love & concern.  It‚Äôs not.  It‚Äôs about the needs of that person-period.  Same is true of the enabler when the chips are down.  

If you happen to believe it‚Äôd help, let me lastly share that I find the approx 12-15 mins single aspect topic presentations for ppl with these issues on the YouTube channel, Surviving Narcissism, is plain spoken & very much on point.  I go back occasionally to listen to a few as my personal check-in. (Dad passed in 2017) 

I very obviously cannot say your family is dealing with narcissism. I‚Äôm no doctor & don‚Äôt know any of the parties involved.   So, you may wanna discount all Ive shared.  Perfectly okay.  I will say I saw parallels to my experiences that were all too familiar, so much so that I wanted to provide an info source & moral support so that you can have the desired relationships you deserve.  

Keep supporting your best gal üíï& best wishes."
