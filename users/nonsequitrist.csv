The best part of this is exactly that. A lasting and ruinous division in the GOP would be the best thing for our society. Now, I'm not in favor of one-party rule and I don't think that there should be no successful conservative party. I think the whole two-party system needs to go.

If today's GOP founders like the Whigs did in the 1850s (giving rise to the new Republican Party then), that's our best chance to fundamentally restructure the way we handle parties and our system of governance. We can't reform the system in normal conditions, because any reform would threaten the institutional power of the people who get to vote on the reform. But a little creative chaos can break that logjam and allow new paradigms to emerge.

There's no guarantee that it will happen, but the implosion of our duo-lithic system is the best short-term prospect for a better political system that doesn't require a Constitutional Amendment.

A party for the Evangelicals who think Jesus was about keeping white people rich and favored. A party for the moneyed elites who want everyone else to live like the peons they imagine them to be. A new-socialism party and a progressive capitalism party. We need more successful parties, and one way to possibly get there is to have one of our current parties die a merciful death."

The current Catalonian identity doesn't go back that far. 2000 years ago there were Celts there. Then Romans. Those groups of people had totally different cultural identities -- different from each other and different from today's Catalonians. The political and cultural identity that dominates the region now didn't start to evolve until after yet another group, the Visigoths, came to dominate the land. Even after that point it took hundreds for the current Cata-local sense of self to evolve.

It truly is amazing when cultures last that long, because there aren't many of them. The Basques, baby. They go back even farther. Wales, maybe, at least in part?"

Going on a tangent about your ideas is totally cool. And I'm not going to claim that you were the only one misunderstanding the other's points, obviously.

There are plenty of valid criticisms that can be made about any set of ideas, even you own, and even someone else's. 

What I said about American handegg is really not far-fetched. Someone could in good faith could definitely argue that those themes are present but don't represent deep currents in American culture, as you pretty much did, though with a disputative twist.

So I'll offer another reasoned idea. Consider the cultural emphasis on thanking *every* member of the armed services for their service. Consider having them stand and get applauded at events not in any way related to government or service or anything like that. 

Now, I'm not saying that people's impulse to serve others should not be celebrated. But we don't honor the same impulse that is surely as strong in many other voluntary roles in our society. Social workers get no special recognition, and often scorn from many quarters. Teachers don't get thanked by everyone.

Why this difference? One might argue that service members risk their very lives, and others don't, and this makes all the difference. Well, we don't ask firefighters to stand and get applauded.

I think it's rather clear that there's a ritualistic quality to this honoring specifically of our warriors, and further proof that warlike themes run right through the culture, without totally defining an idea set so vast and complex."

Men and women are human. They're people -- fellow-people, with all the complications that entails about expectations and cultural norms and identity and on and on. This stuff isn't the same for every listener, of course, but *something* extra about human culture is there for *every*one who hears the words.

""Male"" and ""female"" aren't even explicitly human. They apply to all sorts of creatures, even plants. Now, when they are used as nouns we know from context that humans are being referred to when that is the case, but using these words as nouns still strips all that emotive cultural content away.

That's why you'll see them used in scientific contexts. Anthropological field reports, for example, will use these words as nouns. So will police reports. In a police report one intent is to describe events and facts unemotively. Tell it straight. Remove from the presentation any hint that the bias of the author is changing the content. These nouns are perfect for that kind of messaging intent.

It also makes them perfect for the Army. The Army needs to strip people down and rebuild them. To inculcate them with a new culture and identity. To take people without the emotional biases that dominate in the mainstream culture. 

But stripping away this stuff also suits incels. For them ""woman"" is loaded with all kinds of scary cultural content.

These are not unique to Trump, but he has been the most brazen bigot behind the Resolute Desk. The brazen quality of his ideological consonance with Christian Nationalism is the key to his support by people who are Christian Nationalists, and who also happen to be evangelical Christians.

If Trump is followed by those who continue to espouse Christian Nationalism, they can also expect support from the same cultural group. However, note that Trump also has other qualities that earn him support from those quarters.

Authoritarianism is a quality that citizens have or don't have to one degree or another. People with authoritarian views believe in strong leaders, adherence to authority over individual heterodoxy, etc. Christian Nationalists are also highly authoritarian, and Trump presents himself as the ultimate strongman. His incessant protestations of personal perfection are blatantly obvious signs of insecurity and weakness, as is his bullying and love for punching down, but people tend to see what they want to see, and Trump is very noisy with his self-presentation.

If anyone wants to match Trump's levels of adherence from Christian Nationalists, they have a tough act to follow. Also note that after every presidency there tends to be a reaction that pulls people to another pole in expected conduct or character (consider how Obama was the opposite of Bush, and Trump the opposite of Obama, etc.) Particularly if Trump wins a second term, after he leaves office don't expect a continued hegemony of the groups empowered right now. That doesn't tend to happen."
IAmA,fbzgpc5,t1_fbz4kfq,1577246103.0,"The Disciples of Christ defends pedophiles? I think you are mistaken. It is a very progressive church, without the hierarchical power structures or requirement of chastity for all church officials. It is the toxic combination of those that lies at the heart of the vile corruption and tragic victimization of children.

If you know of any Disciples of Christ transgressions concerning the safety of children please do let us know. If you were assuming that u/revanon was of a different Protestant faith or perhaps Catholic, you might want to apologize for your assumption."
IAmA,fbz9vnr,t1_fby3bvw,1577239671.0,"There are some other smart people who agree with you, and they've done research. Quoting from a [New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/news/on-religion/what-it-would-take-for-evangelicals-to-turn-on-president-trump?verso=true) from this very week: ""an amalgam of cultural beliefs—fusing Christianity with American identity and centered on the belief that America is, and should be, a Christian nation—is a better predictor of support for Trump than economic dissatisfaction, political party, ideology, religion, or a host of other possible determining factors.""

This conclusion comes from “Taking America Back for God: Christian Nationalism in the United States,” by the sociologists Andrew L. Whitehead, a professor at Clemson University, and Samuel L. Perry, a professor at the University of Oklahoma.

They've termed this culture around American evangelicalism that is separate from strictly Christian teachings ""Christian Nationalism."" And their studies suggest the ""Americans who engaged in more frequent religious practice—church attendance, prayer, and bible reading—were less likely than their less observant peers to subscribe to political views normally associated with Christian nationalism, such as believing that refugees from the Middle East pose a terrorist threat to the United States, or that illegal immigrants from Mexico are mostly dangerous criminals.""

Bigotry connected to a fearful attitude about loss of privileged status is the predictor for Trumpist extreme conservatism, not evangelical belief. Unfortunately a lot of the evangelical population are those Americans in this problematic cultural group. But their religious practices can be part of a solution to the problem, particularly if they can be isolated from self-serving political agitation concerning topics like a supposedly foretold Christian destiny for the American continent, and other quasi-religious doctrines powered by cultural desires for power and status."

Yes, and those antislavery sentiments were then edited out under pressure from a broad coalition of representatives whose supporters profited from slavery. Which is exactly the point of the 1619 Project in this regard.

> He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us"" more likely refers to actual violence by colonists against specific British policies. E.g., stamp act riots, Boston tea party...

No, it doesn't. Did you read the linked text? Those words are about slave insurrections, as scholarship devoted to the document has revealed perfectly clearly."
