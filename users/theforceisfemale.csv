AmItheAsshole,ffd1823,t3_essrci,1579811409.0,Imagine ruining a friendship and damaging half a dozen family member’s opinions of you all so you can control someone else’s appearance. Lolol
AmItheAsshole,ffd0szc,t3_essrci,1579811176.0,"YTA so bad. It’s her literal hair color. As someone who got married last year, you’re being a total bridezilla. 

Of course she dropped out. You’re prioritizing what you want in the pictures over your (supposed) friend’s physical appearance. 

It would be like telling a bridesmaid ‘you can be in my wedding if you lose 20 lbs’. It’s worse than other AITA posts I’ve seen about making people walk around without their prescription glasses all day, or cover their tattoos.

Her hair isn’t ‘vibrant’. She’s a natural redhead, it’s not purple or neon green. And no it is not going to ruin your photos so calm down. No one (except apparently you somehow) is going to look at your pictures and be like ‘oh, if only she’d made the one bridesmaid shave her head, it ruins the whole aesthetic’.

Yikes. Do yourself a favor as planning a wedding is stressful enough as it is, and choose to be a more relaxed bride."

People change their minds. She is allowed to reevaluate what she wants to do. I know that you have not changed your mind, and that you had an agreement, but people change.
