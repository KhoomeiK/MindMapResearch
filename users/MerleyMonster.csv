TwoXChromosomes,ff4f4jl,t1_ff4eysd,1579562115.0,"Forcing someone to have sex with you, or performing sexual acts they don't consent to, is sexual assault. In this case you already didn't want to have sex. No matter if you joined in, you didn't give your consent. That's rape. Lots of rape victims ""played along"" with their rapist to keep themselves safe. To top it off, he choked you when you made it clear you didn't want that."

AskReddit,few0efm,t3_eqqu61,1579403686.0,"I was at the local library and was reading quietly somewhere tucked away as I was skipping school. At some point the lights start to go out so I get up and walk downstairs to the entrance. Automatic doors don't open. So I go back upstairs and call out for someone. No answer. I'm completely alone.
I run back down to the automatic doors, trying to find a button or anything to make them work but couldn't find a thing.
Then I noticed the door to the tourism office has a lock on my side, I open it and step through. From there on I could just walk outside as the center is never really closed. I did notify some of the close-by shopkeepers so the door could be locked again.

Now the librarians double check the whole library before they close down xD"

AskReddit,fdujmvu,t3_en58u2,1578734090.0,"In my dream I woke up to go to the toilet and when I got back I noticed someone was in my walk-in closet. Door was open, light was on. So I said: I know you're in there. Get the fuck out.
But instead of a human being, a small creature came out. It just straight up terrified me. Upon waking up I couldn't even fully remember what it looked like, but I was so scared that I wanted to run away and scream but only little squeeks came from my throat and my legs couldn't move while this creature moved towards me.

I've had this dream multiple times and every time I remember a little more about the creature but it still terrifies me. He's about half the size of a human, completely pitch black, looks like he's wearing a hat with a wide brim but it's attached to him and his face has red eyes and his mouth is a sharp fanged grin, but it's too big. The corners of his mouth end at the same height of his eyes!"
