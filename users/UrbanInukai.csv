depression,fewg3uc,t1_fetrmql,1579410010.0,"Im so sorry that happened to you :(
My gf once told me too that it's exhausting being together with someone having a depression,she even told me she could have depression or anxiety disorder too if she have to keep dealing with my depression,she once even ask me,is it really you have a depression or you are just lazy? It's hurtful,n im embarrassed for myself for not being able to do anything right,so i totally understand how hurtful it must've been going through something like that"
depression,fewf485,t1_fesvl8b,1579409544.0,"Exactly what i mean,places with crowded people easily triggers my panic attack,i told them about this for several times everytime i went out with them,but they still insisted to went in to a very cramped bus or any public transportation, cuz it's not a big deal for them n they believe i could handle it too by pulling me inside,they keep telling me it's gonna be alright when it's clearly not,sometimes even just left me alone waiting for the next bus to arrive cuz im starting to show signs that im going to have a panic attack

And again,i can't blame them tho,maybe they were just busy or in a hurry,but it stills kinda disappoint me a little bit,aside from that,they are still a good people,i know they are trying too,but in a wrong way,idk why i keep telling myself this,but i always convince myself they didn't mean it"

SuicideWatch,feruotx,t1_fermwgd,1579358559.0,"It's true things were really complicated here,especially about the immigrant stuff,rules often change without official announcements from the department,sometimes even the department people don't even know what's going on,I've been studying here for almost 9 to 10 years i think,my mother language is actually Indonesian,mandarin and english are my second language,1 more year I'll be graduating from college,still haven't find a job that'll give me a work permit,idk what's the exact correct name of it,in order to get their green card here,you have to live at taiwan at least for 5 to 6 years,have to be 20 or 21 i think,and 5 years of work permit/contribution,it's not just any work,it's more like you have to prove your are actually usefull for this country kind of work,by working as a translator for example,im trying so hard to apply everywhere,none of them called back

Im actually majoring in art n design,which is completely a useless talent to have here,even my work were so mediocre to even got accepted at companies,im self aware of how much talent i do actually have,n that makes me even more depressed because i never actually do anything n can't do anything,i have everything some people wanted,i really have nothing to be depressed about,people have it harsher than i do,i should've been more grateful for what i have instead of being depressed and wanting to die,but i really do wanted to die

My sister deserve better than i do,im way too toxic for her and i couldn't bare to see her have to seeing me like this,being a pathetic shit n not even doing anything which clearly i have everything to be a lot more useful,i could've been successful with the amount of skills or talent i have,i wish i could just gave them to people that who are actually needing it though,I feel like I've been wasting my whole life living and not even accomplish anything"
depression,ferkcs8,t1_feretxh,1579355007.0,"I totally get your point,they actually lived pretty close to me,they were pretty chill people to hangout with,there's already a few lot of times when im outside with them,i still often got my anxiety or panic attack,i told them and i said i really need them to take me to some place with less people around or a hospital,apparently when that happens they really actually just didn't do anything,they saw what's happening to me,saying everything is gonna be alright,and then they just talk to each other like there's nothing wrong with me,or maybe one of them just left n said there's something emergency going on with them,idk if it's just coincidence or they didn't actually care,when i ask them about this,they said they didn't know what to do and maybe left me alone to calm myself down will be actually better

It's nothing really,i completely understand maybe they were just nervous and not everyone can handle these kind of situations,you were right tho,maybe i didn't gave them a chance to help me,though i know myself when they do actually need me,im willing to went outside to look for them whatever they need is"
SuicideWatch,feqay1d,t1_fepsbf7,1579339583.0,"I think the only reason im studying in college is actually i just wanna get my permit to stay here in taiwan because  I'll rather live here than being sent back to my homeland,my mom and i were actually ran from home to taiwan because my dad were abusive and a drug addict,he was wanted by local police so my mom have to take me to taiwan to leave him behind,but 2 years later after that,idk what was my mom thinking about,she let my dad come to taiwan to live with us again,im already depressed enough to live with him back in my homeland,after 2 years finally free from his clutches,my mom for god knows what reason let him back,despite my 6 other aunt disagreeing letting him come to taiwan,she still let him come back anyway,i feel disgusted and disappointed,I've been sexually harrassed by him when i was a kid,i didn't even told my mom because she already stressing enough being yelled at everyday by him

The only reason i still kept on studying here is simply just because i don't wanna go back,but now since he was already here,we got into a lot of argument a lot,i was told that im just a dog that keeps on begging for food and didn't even do anything in return,which i didn't denied because it's technically true,i didn't even do anything,my existence were really just an accident,my mom forced my dad to marry her because she was pregnant,n my dad didn't even wanted a girl,especially when im a lesbian

They have my little sister,she was 7 while im 22,i really just hope they don't make the same mistake like they did to me,i really see no point of living,i always felt like my life time is supposedly already expired and yet im still living here rotting even more every single day"
SuicideWatch,feq6gu4,t1_fepu101,1579338195.0,"There's a lot of factor that's causes me a lot more harder to get a job,cuz my family were immigrants,im still a student n i only have a permit as student to stay here at taiwan,if i graduated without even having a job that allows you to get a working permit there,im screwed,i can't go back again to my homeland,that's the worst place I've ever been too,and it's hard to find a job here especially when they know you are an immigrants,second of all,even though im already tried to speak normal to people,they still found out that im weird and prefer that i just stop talking,which is makes me really confused because they also told me to be more open up to people

And now here i am,im already suffering from severe depression and anxiety disorder for around 6 years or more i think,im trying really hard to get myself better but things just seems only getting even worst than before,i see no point of trying,maybe they were right,maybe im just a lazy slob that uses my disorder to escape reality,i really hope i could just die got hit by a car or get a terminal disease so at least i know when is my time to come"
depression,fejdqd2,t3_epes44,1579169029.0,"Always,everyday,especially when im with someone i deeply care about,i just felt so guilty being around with them cuz i know they deserve better rather than having me around,it gets really bad over time n i often having a mental breakdown because of that"

depression,feja3fr,t1_fej8zpj,1579163609.0,"Oh,tbh i really love animals more than people haha,i think all animals were just great,i love cats too! I used to have one a few years ago,sadly he was already really old when i adopted him,but at least he gets to chill with me for a good 3 years before passing away.
Unfortunately i can't have any pets in my place because the environment is just too humid and wet for most animals,working as a dog caretakers or anything similar to that is definitely an option tho! Been on a volunteer once at a local animal rescue shelter,it was great,planning to do more in the future when i have the time!

Im so sorry to hear about your condition n your daughter..and yes i do believe in heaven too,i can't say im much of a religious person,but i do grow up in a very religious family tho,and i was an obedient religious child once too,but then i don't remember what exactly happened,the next thing i know im already an atheist,well..half atheist i think,i still believe God exists so do heaven n hell,but i just often thinks more logically rather than involving anything with religions,and im sure believe that your daughter is doing well on the other side,you can stick on this believe too if that's comforts you :)

Oh,and also,you dont have to be religious to pray,praying is just praying i guess,haha i personally rarely ever pray because i just simply feel weird about it haha"
depression,fej8pid,t1_fej8aw6,1579161721.0,"Thanks,yea,i think it's pretty much like it,and i get that too where you open up about your feelings n get shouted at,i got scared,so i just dont do it anymore

And the truth is,i kinda do actually wanna end my life,it's just too much of a back story to tell n the history of it,i never actually committed it simply because i strongly believe about the existence of hell....i know,it's stupid,but that's what keeping me alive for so long,but yeah,at least i still get to see the innocent and the most pure part of this world,like puppies,i like puppies,all dogs are puppies,i love seeing them n having them around,at least they made me smile n made me like this world a little bit more"
depression,fej7ixe,t3_ep96tq,1579160182.0,"I feel you on this one,im self aware of how I can be such a pain in the ass to some people for being...depressed,i think im just appeared to be lazy to them,especially my gf,i know this might be nothing,but once she said to me,""why are you not doing anything? You fall even worst than you was ever before when since we started dating,you feel like doing nothing,is it because you have a depression,anxiety disorder or just being lazy?""

That was a few months ago,and still to this day,i just can't get that words out of my mind,n honestly depressed even more"
