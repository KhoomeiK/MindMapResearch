Below was Tokyo only, my bad. 


Your can't. US and Japan estimated about from about 120,000 to 210,000 casualties. One historian said that he estimated 100,000 dead and 1,000,000 injured, and 1,000,000 homeless. However, the homeless and wounded population is comprised of mostly the same people. 

Basically, 2,000,000 is a huge stretch by official estimates

There have been multiple research papers, presentations, and God knows how many experiments in data recovery and effective data destruction presented. 

One of the better versions of these have been presented across multiple DefCons, where they explore effective data destruction techniques. Part of that setup is to define what is considered unrecoverable, specifically based on inductions given to a military EOD guy who did tours in the ME. I believe the criteria was to reclaim any drive that was not pulverised or melted as the NSA could get data from it.

Making a drive unrecoverable is still very doable, but data recovery is getting better every year, and it's only going to get easier as we move into Solid State Storage. 

Here's one of the more recent talks I mentioned, I think there was an updated one in 2018 as well but this one still gives a good idea, and it's 5 years old by now.

You are right, though, it's much less invasive. If you declaw a cat, or a dog, or a skunk, you completely screw with their ability to do a lot of day to day things. 

Removing a skunk's scent glands is most closely related to removing the anal sacs of a dog. Anal sacs are what store and then secrete the substance that they use to help mark their territory in the wild. In captivity, these sacs can commonly get full and need release (ever see a dog scooting along the carpet? they need help expressing the liquid in the sacs). 

Usually, a vet or groomer will do express the glands every time they see the dog, but in some a surgery is required. The hardest thing to do is keep it clean for a few days,but it has not negative impacts for an animal in captivity, as a pet would be."
