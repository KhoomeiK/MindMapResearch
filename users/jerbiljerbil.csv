AskReddit,fbq91qe,t3_ee2ps8,1577029475.0,"my earliest  memory was running to catch the bus with my mom and cousins. I was like 3ish and they were 7/8. we had to go down these steps that had 2 parts and everyone else flew down them but my little legs couldnâ€™t move that fast, so it was taking me awhile. my mom ran ahead to catch the bus and my cousins came back to help me down the steps. 

i remember feeling bad that my legs couldnâ€™t move faster and i thought that my mom would go on and get on the bus and leave me and my cousins. (of course she didnâ€™t, yes i have abandonment issues)"
