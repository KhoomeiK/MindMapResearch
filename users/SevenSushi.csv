dogs,ffcsz46,t3_esu4m3,1579806632.0,"They are not interested in the food and leave it sit all day because they know it will always be there. This is very common with free-fed dogs, they typically have little food motivation. This would be like if we had an all you can eat buffet in our kitchen 24/7. We would eventually not care about it or hardly be hungry, instead we would just grab something when walking by every few hours. Same with the dogs."

dogs,ff3vab6,t3_erguc5,1579549620.0,"Rescue volunteer here!

I have been fostering, doing home inspections, and checking references for a large local rescue for several years. For the vet reference part, we don't actually speak to the vet. What it is is calling and usually speaking to the receptionist to make sure you are actually a client there, that the pets you have on file are in good standing (up to date on core vaccines, etc). Also, for the home check, I promise you that the size is not typically taken into account unless you were trying to adopt a 175 pound mastiff but were living in a high rise studio apartment, or something crazy like that. When I do home checks, which is several times a month, it is typically to just verify that the adopters do live where they say they live, that they are not hoarders, and that there isn't any injured/neglected animals in the home. We aren't there to judge tidiness, size, etc. Just that it is a safe and suitable environment for a pet."

Also, can you elaborate on the dramatic aggression issues that happened with family dogs? I am very curious due to the Dx given at the vet behavioral consult."
dogs,ff36biv,t1_feotuv5,1579534726.0,"Notice in the video how the dog is leaning the entire front half of his body against the harness, the dog is literally walking at a slanted angle because he is leaning so much. Most dogs I see wearing rear clip harnesses are doing just this, leaning. Or as some people call it ""hanging on the harness""."

Not to mention I was hard core rolling my eyes because here is another dog ""leaning/hanging"" in a harness... biggest pet peeve of mine."

As the owner of both breeds living together under my roof at the same time, I one hundred percent recommend a Rottweiler over a GSD. My Rott is very ""easy"" in comparison to the GSD as far as training, exercise, behavior, and everything else."

Start looking for these things around 18 months and then please, please, please update us when this dog is 24 months. I am willing to bet money this will be a very different post by then."

Dogtraining,fcnybbw,t1_fcnxp0h,1577820799.0,"This dog is acting out because it likely makes all its own life decisions and doesn't believe that its owners will make decisions (including protecting the dog and themselves from others). This has NOTHING to do with dominance. Notice how the dog was fine in the abcense of the owners, yet as soon as they returned the dog acted out again. That is because this dog thinks it has to make life decisions (when to eat, when to potty, when to play). When a dog is faced with a scenario that it doesn't know how to make a decision to, it acts out. Such as what you are seeing above. I currently have a 9 month old shelter dog in my home for training because it dislocated its owners arm do to leash reactivity and issues. You would not believe how different this dog is in just 13 days by being put on a feeding and bathroom schedule and given a few very simple rules. No tools used. No ""dominance"" used. The leash reactivity is GONE and the anxiousness is GONE. I have never ever laid a hand on this dog, or done any dominance bull shit. What is worse is that this dog will most likely result back to a hot mess full of anxiety and behavior problems when it goes back to its mom. 

Very sad!"

dogs,fbxqwym,t3_eet209,1577198014.0,"""needs medication"" is often used on tags I guess for urgency sake. It it thought that the finders will be more likely to return the dog or get it home quickly if they think it might be sickly or have an illness.

I personally put ""Do not feed"" on mine instead of an address. My dog has a funky stomach and sensitivities and it seems like a pretty common thing for finders to immediately give a found dog a huge meal. This would likely cause my guy to become ill for a few days."
