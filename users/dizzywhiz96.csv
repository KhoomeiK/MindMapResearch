relationship_advice,ff8zqvq,t3_esa3bs,1579701126.0,"I recently lost my dog, who was my best friend. It was the first big loss I‚Äôve experienced and I have had a really really hard time with it. Here are a few things that have helped me:

-looking at pictures and videos of when he was happy and doing well. His last moments were hard and he was in a lot of pain, and looking at pictures nearly constantly in the first few days helped me re-write my main memory of him as a happy one, rather than the very end. 

-talking about him. I‚Äôve talked about him to anyone that will listen. 

-writing. Writing out how I feel, writing out what I remember about him. 

-a huge help was talking through every detail of his last night, when we lost him unexpectedly. Getting out every step from beginning to end was a big weight off my shoulders and helped me begin to heal. 

Encourage him to do these things, and give him space for it. Be an ear and a shoulder, and share your memories with him too. Let him know that you miss and love your dog, too. 

This has been the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever had to go through. Two weeks later, I am doing okay. There are ups and downs, and I miss him like im missing a piece of myself. If you aren‚Äôt ready for another dog soon, try visiting friends‚Äô dogs or visiting the shelter. The shelter near me allows you to walk them and certain ones are eligible for a staycation/daycation, where you can either take them out for a day or bring them home for a few days. Some of these things may help his heart heal without feeling like he‚Äôs replacing your dog right away. I for one know that I am nowhere near ready for a new dog anytime soon. 

This is long, but I hope it helps and gives you insight into how he‚Äôs feeling. Sending you best wishes, and maybe our pups are hanging out together now."

Petloss,feltnmz,t3_epqf36,1579230653.0,"Sending you good thoughts. I lost my dog Sam last Monday, and it was extremely sudden. He went from being totally fine one day to having continuous seizures that night out of nowhere until we had no choice but to let him go immediately to put him out of pain. It was so sudden with no time to even process what was happening because that day had been so normal. 

So, I guess no experience could have gone right. Both yours and mine were so hard, but both of our boys went without prolonged suffering, and we can both be proud of that.

OldManDog,fefouv3,t1_fefo7o4,1579061125.0,"I only saw the very beginning of one seizure - he was perfectly fine and then started having several in one night in my parents‚Äô room. They woke me up to tell me and I knew I had to be with him to the very end. We took him to the emergency vet, and he reacted badly to the anti seizure meds. Not only did they not help the seizures at all, but they caused him delusions and he was making the worst noises. There wasn‚Äôt anything else we could do so we had to decide very quickly to let him go. They couldn‚Äôt even get him calm enough to say a peaceful goodbye - he was basically wailing in my arms for his last moments. It was horrible. So I do get what you‚Äôre going through too and I hate you had to witness and experience it with yours. A week on, the images and sounds have actually faded considerably already but it haunted me terribly for the first few days. I hope you find the same relief. 

That‚Äôs really comforting. Since it all happened so quickly, I‚Äôve tried to tell myself that once he started having them, he wasn‚Äôt really aware anymore and everything was just an involuntary reaction. He had 8 seizures in the span of a few hours, and from never having had any before or really any serious problems, it was so sudden and scary. I just wish I‚Äôd been able to say a real goodbye. But he was so loved, and I‚Äôm sure Chloe was too. 

Thanks so much for the offer :-) I may take you up on it, and feel free to do the same. I love talking about Sam, and hearing about other dogs too. So I‚Äôd love to hear and share some happy memories too if you‚Äôd like."

He was always happy, always wagging his tail and barking for attention. If you stopped petting him, he‚Äôd bark and whine until you started up again. He LOVED baby carrots. Every time someone came home, he had to have a carrot out of the fridge. He would be so full of energy in the evenings and slept while we were at work. He was always so snuggly on weekend mornings because he was used to being alone and asleep during that time. Those moments were the best. Most nights he couldn‚Äôt get enough food in him, and it was so funny to hear him chowing down. 

I have so many memories with him, I can‚Äôt begin to decide on a favorite. If I was home, we were always together.
