I remember when going on to pornhub never even brought the idea of incest into your head, that shit was probably there somewhere for those who cared to look but for us normal folks it was never on our minds.

northernireland,fem5pjg,t3_epqm0u,1579240677.0,"I know this will get downvote to death, because people hate ""preachy vegans"" (when what they really hate is being faced with the truth and the consequences of their own dietary choices) but really, ""animal welfare"" in the context of animal agriculture is an oxymoron. The animals are literally bred to be killed, and long before their natural lifespans, so you can eat them because bacon and steak taste good. That's a weak justification and a horrible fucking thing we still allow to happen. And if you have a pet dog or cat and consider yourself an animal lover but happily eat the flesh of long suffering animals, you're a fucking hypocrite
