nba,ffcd5jv,t1_ffc4078,1579796893.0,"But he only played 18 minutes, is on a terrible team, and it was his first actual game ever. After an injury. I think the media still is overhyping him, but I myself am hyped to see what he does, whether he lives up to the hype or not, he’s an incredible athlete, and that’s why the hype started. And that’s why it’ll continue. Even if he’s not the next LeBron, or Charles Barkley, he will be fun to watch."
nba,ffc0b1m,t3_esocpt,1579788243.0,"Even in college I hated him, not because he's a bad dude, just from all the media hype. After every single game it was Zion Center, not Sport Center. I understood why but I felt that all the hype after every single game, even his not so great ones was a little much. Other big things happened but it’s was just Zion Center all the time. But last night I finally felt the hype. And me from just 2 weeks ago would’ve been exhilarated with the start of the game. But now, I finally understood the hype, and I can’t wait for his next games. He’s going to be one of the funnest athletes to watch the world has ever seen. The hype was real after all."
