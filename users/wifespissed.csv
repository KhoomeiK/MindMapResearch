They'd come down on bullying. If there was a fight the kid who started it would get in trouble. Use the students as witnesses. We could always wear whatever we wanted. My hair was probably 20 different colors throughout. I had mohawks/liberty spikes what have you. Hats were not banned. I'd skate through the halls and teachers would just jokingly tell me to slow it down. We could skate whatever we wanted outside(my school had some good sets of stairs)There was a trail behind the school where everybody smoked in between classes, teachers to busy or lazy to care. Plenty of bowls were smoked there as well. You were allowed to leave campus during lunch via car or walking. You did not need parental permission to do so. Jock kids were always playing catch in the halls or working on their cuts with basketballs. Pretty much as long as you weren't a blatant asshole or complete douchebag and didn't purposely try to test the teachers/administrators patience you had nothing to worry about."
