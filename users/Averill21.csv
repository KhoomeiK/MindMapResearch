gaming,ff2i0w7,t1_ff2bar2,1579507013.0,"You basically linked the book that comes with starter decks, the rules are way more nuanced then that. They don’t even cover missing timing, did you know yugioh has a mechanic where some cards won’t get their effect activated based off of the exact wording on whatever cards are being played right then? I honestly still have no idea how miss timing works."
gaming,ff2hwau,t1_ff2d1jf,1579506852.0,"Since every meta card is now a secret rare or ultra rare that is short printed so hard you probably will get one copy per four booster boxes. Seriously infinite impermanence is a hand trap that is very powerful and a staple sideboard if not main deck card, it only was printed secret rare and was fetching around 80 each. I don’t even know if they reprinted it yet"
gaming,ff2ayk9,t1_ff1uebs,1579499151.0,"Wrong, link monsters are used to open up more spaces to extra deck summon. Look up danger dark thunder dragons they combo and end on like four extra deck monsters after pulling two cards out of your opponents hand on turn one"
gaming,ff2aw3v,t1_ff1fld8,1579499085.0,"Bro that is nothing, the top combo deck was 37 monsters and 3 spells that are literally pot of greed but better, with the caveat being you can’t play any other spells or traps after playing it. My turns took like ten minutes when I played as fast as possible and would end with three strong monsters that could negate anything, a guy who prevented your opponent from searching his deck, and a card that you could sacrifice to return a card to your opponents hand AND play a dragon from your deck, meaning depending on what you ran you could banish another card. Check out danger dark thunder dragons and see what the combos can do"
gaming,ff2aoi5,t1_ff1y36z,1579498884.0,"The alternative dragon is currently twenty bucks each and you need three, and you want at least two bingo machine go which are 30 each. Blue eyes deck cost me about 400 total and that is modest for a yugioh deck"
gaming,ff2al2z,t1_ff1ouu8,1579498793.0,"Gen one yugioh was cool because the monsters felt like monsters. When they started having themed decks it started losing the fun I felt, although it makes more sense from a game perspective"

funny,ff25s9j,t1_ff1d127,1579494597.0,"Because sometimes dogs don’t obey when they are supposed to or do bad things no matter what you do? Not every dog is an angel to train, sometimes you have to do something like that to discourage the bad behavior. The in laws have a huskie who they took to training classes and have tried everything they can and he still doesn’t obey, chases cats, steals clothes and puts holes in them, takes things off of the countertops now that he is big enough, and even opens doors. And no shit capsaicin affects dogs, but they are much much less receptive to heat than the bitter or sour flavors."

funny,ff1afx3,t1_ff0kf6t,1579476849.0,"That is true I don’t care about what you have to say because your opinion isn’t really based on much other than hot sauce hurts dogs, when it really doesn’t. It is like giving them a bitter liquid to discourage begging at dinner, why is that bad? Unless the guy was feeding his dog Blair’s mega death sauce or something"
funny,ff0k6oa,t1_ff0ixss,1579469626.0,You have clearly never had an incredibly energetic dog like a huskie. Is it cruel to use a leash to train them to not do stuff? I am sure pulling a leash hurts more than a little bit of hot sauce.
funny,ff0ik9g,t1_ff0g1pm,1579469188.0,"Yes, yes it does. It is ridiculous to call hot sauce torture. Also, if you do some research, dogs don't really notice spice as much as bitter/sour flavor, which is what they will react to. Of course you shouldn't give them too much but a little bit won't hurt them in the slightest."
