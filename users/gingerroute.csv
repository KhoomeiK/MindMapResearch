Obviously the higher elos forgot they were all shit to start with and are saying this is bad. When you're first starting out in a MOBA or just league in general, this is a good guideline of where to be. If you're wandering aimlessly, you're worthless in game and now it's a 4v5. This gives you a guideline. The more you play, the more you can fill in between the lines of mechanics, objectives, technical ability, champ understanding, etc. League isn't simple and this breaks it down in the most simple (and comical) way.

We also keep each other from getting tilted since our roles are different parts of the map and we can warn of missing people without just a ping. He can say ""by red buff 3 seconds ago"".

Also, what I've learned, is check WHERE your top laner is warding. Most times, it's too close to lane so they don't even have time to react to a gank let alone stay alive. Advise to ward farther away so they have a reaction time, especially mid fight."

xayahmains,fekimdm,t3_epcepw,1579200819.0,"Wow. No one on here is helpful. Let me try to help you because I also had this problem with her.

1. She is heavily reliant on a good CC support at the beginning of her game until about 5/6 when she can begin to successfully CC champs. 
2. Learn how to kite minions/last hit. You'll be ahead in gold this way. Champ take downs onlly give so much as opposed to a wave clear which in the long run, will give you more.
3. You cannot trade with Draven or Blitz. Just stay back.
4. I can almost guarantee you're getting ahead of your minions and wanting to trade, do not. Stay back and farm near your turret if you have to. She isn't as mobile as she seems.
5. Her AA seems that it's fast, but it's not and it's easy to not last hit.
6. Try building Essence Reaver on her first. I have the most success with this item being my first. It's not the cheapest to build, but it's worth having that AD and CDR.
7. Be. Patient. Mastering Xayah isn't an easy feat. Learning useful feather placement is key here. Place feathers around you so when a champ comes near you, you can E them and root to get away or fight if you're able.
8. Play her often. Play her in bot games against intermediate. Nothing less. Int bots will give you a better idea of how to deal with champs running at you as those damn things seem to tower dive lol.
9. Runes. Manaflow band is useful with her alongside lethal tempo.
10. Use your W when you KNOW you can take down in a team fight. The feathers will be abundant and you can root in TF this way more successfully then AA and Q them to oblivion!"
