aviation,fconuru,t1_fcocdo2,1577836922.0,"I think in general heights scare me. I don’t like gondolas or being on the edge of a cliff. So that is a factor on take offs, but once I’m above clouds I’m so high up the fear goes out the window.But if you mean specifically when flying, what wigs me out the most is when the plane starts banking, for some reason I feel like we’re just gunna keep banking and roll over. It’s obviously a stupid thought, and if I were able to watch the pilot with the yoke in his hand I know I wouldn’t be worried.

I also fear the way that a death would occur on an airplane. The minutes of panic before a crash. The mental torture of knowing you’re gunna die, being tossed around the cabin,  but not being able to do anything about it.."

mildlyinteresting,fcl8jw8,t1_fcl7byf,1577742133.0,"back in the day a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 went down with 364 people on board due to a flaw with the cargo door latch causing a rapid decompression of the plane  severing the hydraulics to the tail of the aircraft.

It came out that it was an issue McDonnell Douglas had known about and witnessed during the testing of the DC-10 prior to its release, and in a flight 2 years prior to the incident that luckily was able to land. They, however, neglected to fix the problem properly.

Last season Drake sat on the sidelines cheering Toronto on with fucking tattoos of Steph and KD on his arms, cause he respects them, but he roots for his home team and they come first. You think Toronto was saying “stop pretending”? Nah, Nick Nurse was practically sucking the dude off.  I’m allowed to think the Nuggets have ballers on their team, I’m allowed to be fans of players on other teams, but still root for my home team.

In the beginning that dudes dog is getting attacked by a much bigger dog, so the guy is forcefully trying to separate the dogs. The crowd gets pissed and pushes him away assuming he’s being too rough with the  big dog, and then starts egging him on.  Then you can see a very small dog start running (I’m assuming this is the guys dog)  and the bigger black dog begins to chase it again pulling its owner along. this guy then runs over and kicks the black dog before it gets the smaller dog. 

Here’s my takeaways:
-If your dog is not properly trained to be around other dogs, then don’t take it to the dog park.

-if you don’t want to risk your dog being attacked, then keep it on a leash."
