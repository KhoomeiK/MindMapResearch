AMA,ff4nwsc,t1_ff4n0io,1579568196.0,"I hated it. I was the only kid. I was a female so I was sheltered. Wasnt allowed around the ride guys who tended to be pretty rough characters. It was really isolating. I was held back socially. In the summer my friends were making memories and I was stuck were ever. It is a 24 hr job. You set up, work, tear down, then move things to the next spot. There wasnt much rest time and when there was... there wasnt anything to do. So my parents let me stay home alone every summer from 16 on. I moved out at 21 after I was married. (Not religious just poor lol)."

I check the leg out for a good 10 to 15 minutes. So I run inside and start calling vets. I grab food and water so it doesn't stray to far. All emergency vets are like 45min drive away.

So I am freaking out, raking my brain on how I am going to get this freakin kitten some help. I go around back to check it out again. The freaking cats leg was fine.

AmItheButtface,feeml8w,t1_feedxai,1579036809.0,Well the 23rd chromosome plays a big part in what gets decided. Seeing how it literally decides what sex you are. Your acting like there is one deciding factor and there isnt. Do you check more boxes for men then your a man. More for women your a woman. Even if your a woman who produces sperm your still a woman because you have more boxes checked yes. This is from a science perspective. We have a base model for what a man is. A base model for what a female is. Open up a biology textbook and you will find them. A lot of people smarter then me (and I am going to assume you) have decided this. Anything differing from these two models are defects. Mother nature screws up. Sometimes people are born with crap(or without crap) they shouldn't have(or crap they actually need). Thank God we have come so far and can fix most issues.
AmItheButtface,fee939z,t1_fee7mc5,1579028931.0,"Well you would need a higher elevation of testosterone.. (no one is born 50 50 even intersect either lean more male or female), have testicles or the capacity to make testicles at one point of time (all the right equipment was there but didnt form properly or poorly still counts). This can go for the rest of the male anatomy. Penis, prostate etc. For people born with malformations/ both which is bigger/ better functioning and does it match the hormonal levels being put out. So if you live up with more male body anatomy then your a male. If you line up more with a woman your a woman. Yes there are gray areas but even in the gray we still find a way to put the person it one side or the other. Again no one is 50/50 split down the middle."

""At first it was just a quite squak here and there. I used to make jokes about the chicken that stalked me. Yea, yea it used to be one big joke until I actually started to see them. It was one at first.  He would follow me everywhere. I would point him out to friends and laugh. The damn thing followed me everywhere I went. Stores, bar, work, home, you name it and that little bird was there. 

We came to a sort of understanding you see. He didn't mess with my things and I would feed him. I even made him a little area in my back yard. He could come and go as he pleased. He actually became my friend. He didn't talk back of course. Just the occasional squak here and there. I would sit and talk to him forever. The little jerk never let me get close to him and he would bite if anyone tried. But he was my freind regardless. He was a survivor, a scrapper, and I understood that better then anyone. 

My friends started to call me the chicken man but I didn't mind. The joking got worse when Cluck Norris got a friend. There I was walking around with these two freakin chicken following me. To say people stared was an understatement. They asked all kinds of questions. It was hard not to after all when do you ever see chickens in the city?  They even road the subway with me a few times. Just picture it and you can see why it's pretty funny. 

They always stuck by myside. At least they did until I stopped into a KFC. I came out with a big box of delicious greasy heaven. I sat down on the curb took out a leg and just went to town. It wasn't until I looked over and they were both just staring at me. Not like their normal stare either. They looked at me like I had just betrayed them. I said to them ""what it's just food. Yo, you want a bite."" I stuck the leg out and offered it to them. Knowing full well chickens were known for eating their own. Neither of them said anything so i figured their lose. So I finished up my meal stood up looked around and they were gone. 

I looked everywhere for those two knuckle heads but I couldn't find them anywhere. It wasn't like them to go more then a few feet away. I looked for hours for them. Finally feeling deflated at the lose of my friends I headed back to my apartment. It was a shitty little one bedroom in a terrible part of town. Thankfully not many people messed with me.  Me being six feet tall and built like a brick house... that's what dad always said anyways.... I got left alone and my chickens got left alone. Two of the neighborhood thugs found out the hard way not to mess with them. They had tried to catch them and eat them. Let's just say they didn't eat anything for a while after that. 

Anyway I stayed up pretty late that night. I kept waiting to hear the inevitable peck at the door saying they wanted in. It wasn't until around three that morning that I heard the first peck. I bolted up and went flying to my door. I flung it open eagerly awaiting my friends but what i saw was something out of a movie.

 There was like 500 chickens at my door. I couldnt believe it. Cluck Norris and Dixie Chick were just standing there watching me. I tried to pet Dixie whom usually didnt mind but she tried to bite me. Then thats when I heard it. It was almost a growl coming from Cluck Norris. A deep primal sound. A threat if  ever there was one. I backed up slowly to my door while extending my arms out to show I didnt mean any harm. That's when the rest of them started. Five hundred chickens all growling. Man it was crazy I tell you. So I ran back inside, grabbed my pistol, and headed straight to the bathroom. Only room in that crapy apartment without any windows. I sat in there for minutes before I heard the glass break in the livingroom. Next was the glass in my bedroom. I could here them scratching and pecking at the door. An occasional squak here and there. I am not going to lie, I was terrified. It wasn't until noon that the the noise settled down. It was around super time that the noise stopped completely. 

Opening the door you could see feathers, shit, all over the carpets. I definitely wasn't getting my deposit back. The door to the bathroom was scratched almost all the way through. Thank goodness they gave up when they did. I looked every where in that apartment and not a single chicken remained so I headed over to the police station. I saw Cluck Norris before he saw me and quickly went the other way.  It would add on and extra five minutes but I didn't want to risk running into them again. Who new what five hundred chickens were capable of. 

Once I got to the police station they sent a car to check my place out after I told them everything.  They said they saw claws marks, and blood every where. Blood....but there wasn't any blood when I left. Now this is were things go down hill for me, man. They also said they found a body in my living room. It was of one of the neighbors. An old man from a couple doors down. I didn't even know the guys name. He had made a few complaints about the chickens but he had been harmless. Seriously the guy complained about anything and everything. I didn't want him dead. That dude was miserable enough in this life and that was punishment enough. 

So here a I am. Doing 35  years for murder that I didn't do. I know no one believes me. That those freaking chickens set me up but I know they did. "" Mark took a long drag on his cigarette. His legs had a nervous shake to them. It got worse everytime he mentioned chickens. 

""That's all very interesting Mark but they never found any feathers or claws marks. In fact what they found was strangulation marks all over Mr. Smiths neck."" Dr. G turned over a page in the folder he was holding. ""You have to come to terms with what you did.... you have to""

Mark tried to jump up from his seat but thankfully the shackles around his hands and feet prevented any hasty actions. ""Now,  now Mark none of that. Thats what got you in here in the first place. Looking over reports"" Dr.G scanned a couple different pages flipping back and forth. No  one but you even mentions these.... chickens. Dont you think a neighbor should have made a noise complaint if there was indeed five hundred chickens. From what the police gathered you and Mr. Smith got into an argument about you playing music to loud. Then you snapped and strangled him. These are the facts Mark.""

""I know what I saw and those chickens are real."" Marks nostrils flared in and out. He knew what he saw and couldn't help that no one believed him. Though how those chickens manage to strangle anyone was beyond him. 

""Not even you friends saw the chicken. None of your neighbors."" Dr. G let out a long sigh. They had been working together for months and weren't making any progress. ""Well until you can accept responsibility for your actions Mark, there really isn't anything I can do for you."" With that he signaled the guards.

Mark new how this session was going to go, just like all the rest had. No one believed him but who else could have done it. He walked solemnly beside the guards. They had to walk outside to get to his building. He had been almost too lost in thought to see him but there he was in all of his glory. Cluck Norris holding onto a KFC bag. Mark lost it. Not being able to contain himself he launched towards the fence. ""I am going to kill you. This is all your fault."" The guards were too quick. They tackled him before he could even make it a step. He tried to fight them and almost won until someone brought out a taser. Before he blacked out he saw Cluck Norris and vowed to get his revenge. If it was the last thing he ever did. He was going to cook that chicken and eat him for Sunday dinner.



Edit to add... dang it. I didnt put in the prompt. I came back to it after reading others stories and took it to be chickens following people. My bad."

""Oh god not this shit again."" An audible sigh permeates the room. ""Of all the shit I have done and these assholes remember this."" His hand itched for a cigar but those times had ended long ago. An ache in his back signaled it was time to switch his position. He scruntched, then stretched out on the bench. He had hung back dreading the question he knew was going to be asked. Not wanting to follow the group around. It wasnt until they had moved on that he settled on this bench.

The museum had been packed today. More so then he had expected. He loved coming to see the faces of the children being able to understand their excitement with new discoveries. So many things had happened since he had died. To much in fact and it made his head spin. Shaking his head he looked back over his exhibit. Smaller then it was before. Still all factual if only people would read the damn sign. His life laid out on the plaque that hung over a few of his inventions. 

 He noticed a large man waddle up to his case. He could feel his face biggen to heat up. The anger coming swiftly. ""Hey babe..."" he looks over and sees a short but stocky female turn to answer.

""Yes dear.""

""Isnt this the......."" before the large man can even finish the sentence he is up. He trys to hit him in his mouth but it just phases through him like usual. It doesn't stop him though. He throws a kick then another punch. Nothing lands but atleast the agression helping fizzle some of his anger out. Panting hard he limps back to his seat. The anger had made him forget about his back injury for just the moment. Now it screamed at him. With a humph he sits back down.

""Oh Georgie boy why you do this to yourself."" Casandra came around and sat down. ""You know this doesnt help anything. They cant hear us or see us. Heck I have been dead 10 years and have been able to let the anger go. You've been dead 155 years. You think this wouldn't bother you.""

He stared at her for a moment trying to keep his anger at bay. ""Cass I made 100's of inventions. I have helped shape the future of the south and they remember me for something I didnt even do."" 

A young couple walked by glancing at his name plate. ""Hey honey its the peanut butter guy!""
George Washington Carver sat on his wooden bench. His shoulders rolled over and he just deflated. This must be hell.

So the after we got back from our honeymoon I moved in. 1 hour away from were I lived previous. I had to find a job right away. I was stressed out like crazy. Thankfully I started to work 4 weeks after moving in.  (Not from a lack of trying either.) So I started to work 40 plus hours a week.)  They would text me wanting to hang out that night but I was always working those nights (lots of nights and weekends). I told them to let me know in advance and I would make sure I was off. They never did. So the friendship dwindled. We are still friendly but no were the level we were before. Life just has a habit of getting in the way sometimes.
