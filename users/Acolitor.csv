todayilearned,fde6s5f,t1_fde5o3r,1578332427.0,Yup! I recommend watching it! The reporter challenges Hannu well. Hannu is MP of the party with strongest ties to peat and forest industry. He's also the chair of state's environmental committee which is problematic.
todayilearned,fde3cz9,t1_fde28cl,1578330270.0,"Clear cutting is practically the only logging method used in Finland. It's all because of few myths in the 50s. Forest owners are not even informed of other methods according to studies by WWF. Only 1/3 of forest owners (n: 624) were told about optional methods of silviculture.

Environmental organisations and researchers are pushing the continuous-cover silviculture to replace clear cutting. It is better for the environment and also benefits the land owners with more continuous earnings and healthier forests.

EDIT: And to make it even pettier, the forest industry upholds the mainstream silviculture by buying only in bulk. If you don't provide enough wood they won't buy it from you, so you have to cut the whole forest to sell. This makes it hard for small forest owners to change."
todayilearned,fde0ofj,t1_fddypfg,1578328522.0,"That's right. State of natural forests is extremely poor in Finland. Forest industry is very active at lobbying our government.

Only like 2 political parties are willing to touch the amount of forests being cut, but it is very hard to do without bigger agreement. One of the government parties is deep in forest industry."
todayilearned,fddsh5b,t1_fddi2ah,1578322820.0,"Finland is not doing good either, even though better than some. Our small population helps us to seem good.

In 2019 our emissions increased by 2% mainly because of peat. Also our total carbon sink decreased by 43% because of rough forestry. Most of our endangered species are under threat because of forest industry. There are big fights going on to make it more sustainable, like stopping clear cutting.

Our forests are cut by clearing whole area from trees and then the ground is modified for saplings. When the ground is broken apart it destroys the carbon storage which leads to the new ""forest"" being carbon source for 20 years. After that it becomes a carbon sink until the process is repeated. This is very problematic for nature and carbon balance. The trees are usually used in products with short life span, so the products are not storing carbon that well either.

Also the trees planted are usually the ones found in forests with late succession stages like pine and spruce, so the ecosystems arent healthy. These trees are not found in naturally occurring first stages of secondary succession.

BBC did great short documentary on our peat issue."
