If he doesn't like how an actor perform, he should tell him so and reshoot. 

Leto has proven time and time again that he's an incredible actor. If he fucked up as the Joker, it's because the director didn't know what he wanted or didn't know how to portray it."

When I realized that everyone always looked so confident because they were at the dead centre of their comfort zone changed how I view things.

In 2016 with the Airpods maybe, but even then, it was following the dongle debacle and people were annoyed by it.

I think they had incredibly innovative products throughout the years, but marketing had a much bigger role to play in most products than their technical abilities. They were able to take existing products, design it slightly differently and make the world forget about everyone else. 

More recently they did it with the Airpods, but overall their marketing hasn't been on-par with their earlier work."
