You might have heard this a thousand times, but God really does love you, no matter what. He loves you so much that he sent a part of Himself to save you and every other person, too. I hope this thought helps, it’s been encouraging to me when I’m down. Talking to people has helped me as well, so I hope seeing a therapist will be beneficial for you. I’ll be keeping you in my prayers, I hope you feel better soon."

depression,fd2riwe,t3_ejw74l,1578150927.0,"When I was in high school, I worried about the same thing. I spent so much time working and studying that I didn't have a whole lot of time to spend with friends. I too worried that I was ""wasting the best years of my life."" I told this to my father, and he told me something that helped relieve my anxiety.

One day, when my father was in college, he was spending some time at a friend's house. He was talking with his friend's mother, and somewhere in the conversation he expressed how difficult he found college to be. His friend's mother told him that his college years would be the best days of his life, and that he should enjoy them, because life after college is nothing but work. However, my father now tells me that that statement is not true. He's told me that he's enjoyed each stage of life more and more. Yes, there were some difficult times, but he tells me that life really just keeps getting better. 

What has helped my dad enjoy life has been ""finding his gift"", so to speak. My family and I are Christian, and we believe that each person has something called a ""spiritual gift"". This is an ability that a person has that they can use to spread kindness and shine God's light. For example, my father's spiritual gift is teaching. He finds a lot of joy in teaching a Sunday school class on Sunday mornings. He also teaches several training courses in his engineering job, which helps him enjoy his work a lot more. Personally, I think my spiritual gift is prayer, so I find a lot of joy in praying for people.  Finding my gift and using it for God has really helped me find joy and contentment in my life. 

Anyway, I hope that this was helpful. Yes life is difficult at times, but for me at least finding my gift has been a big help. If you have any questions or anything, please feel free to ask. I know I shared a lot of information."

PrayerRequests,fd0ep2x,t1_fcxnmm2,1578117749.0,"I definitely believe that demons and bad spirits are real. But please know that God is infinitely more powerful than any evil spirits. 

“You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.” 1 John 4:4

That’s great that you want to rededicate your life to Christ. It’s a big commitment, but with His strength you can shine light to the world. 

I  ask if you’ve talked to a pastor because they may be able to help you discern what’s going on and expel any evil spirits, if need be. I’m sorry to hear no one believes you. The book I mentioned earlier talks a lot about the “deliverance ministry”, which deals with casting out evil spirits from people’s lives. I would still recommend reading the book, and if you think that you may be suffering from evil spirits, then maybe you could reach out to a different pastor? Prayer is also a great weapon again the evil one, so please keep communicating with God through all of this. And I will keep you in my prayers too."

By working for something bigger than myself, I can hope to leave this world a little bit better than when I found it.
