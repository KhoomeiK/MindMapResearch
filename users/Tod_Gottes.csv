Now I think the the idea behind his actions was great, in an ideal world it should all be freely available, but he was hurting a private company in more ways then one and all of which were illegal. 

And when you knowingly break the law (and he did know. He tried to hide who was doing it rather than using his own account through harvard) you should expect to be criminally tried for it.

He also was sending so many download requests that jstor had to block all of MIT because it was crashing their servers. He was basically ddosing them. 

I think they threw the book at him and a lot of the stuff was bullshit but what he did wasn't totally legal and he should have accepted that he was in a legal grey area and could be arrested.

A single frightening event can cause a phobia to form. And some pretty messed up experiments on kids back in the day showed that it could cause them to hate things they previously loved. 

They had kids play with like a soft toy bunny and then one day flashed lights and loud noises when they went to play with the toy and they found that even after a single event like that the kids would never touch the toy again, would panic when they saw it, and it extended to other soft fuzzy things."
