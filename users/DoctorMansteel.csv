nba,fezlv4f,t1_fezay22,1579458786.0,"Whatever that post recently was about the Lakers trainer saying Shaq could've been the greatest ever but he wanted to have a good time, give back to the people and enjoy life. Can't fault him for that and he ultimately seems very happy but.. If he'd taken the time (whether it be months or years) and effort to just improve his free throws 20% that's thousands of points over the space of his career. But Jesus was he an animal. I remember that fucker ripping down backboards and it was just insane to behold."
leagueoflegends,fezi56a,t1_fez17pe,1579457621.0,I mean it happens nowhere near every game. If it was that way no one would climb. It's just something that people use as an excuse. It affects everyone equally and a non toxic person less since they only have 4 potential toxic teammates.
leagueoflegends,few40il,t1_fevr5vy,1579405038.0,Yeah I'm just saying what makes him a great general is his knowledge of maneuvers and past battles. In essence his experience. Although he is definitely charmingly charismatic that isn't as impactful in his role as general. Idk it was dumb of me to put so much thought into it.
leagueoflegends,fevkybg,t1_fevj8s3,1579398647.0,"Then play another game? I mean that without malice and not trying to be a dick. As someone who's played since season one it's unfortunately always been like this.  A team game where, no matter how well you do, someone can always screw it all up. It's inherently going to be toxic. Maybe that's fatalistic of me but in my experience it's true. I see this thread multiple times a year, every year. Aram is a good break, I rarely see too much toxicity there."
leagueoflegends,fevjxfp,t1_fevdy4r,1579398249.0,"Mat was definitely favored by the band but I'd say it was his memories that were his greatest boon. It wasn't like he galvanized his troops and turned the tide of battle with his appearance like Elayne did to her troops. He was without a doubt a great general and very charismatic but just don't see it as a great example. Awesome to see random Wheel of Time, definitely my favorite series of all time! And Mat by far my favorite character (Thom is in a close 2nd though). 

&#x200B;

Dalanar is a good example though, his stoic discipline is reflected by his troops. He lives by a code and adheres to it proudly even when others scorn him for it. I can only remember the example of requiring his sons to wear their uniforms at all times in camp because they're at war but stuff like that definitely shows he sets a standard and holds everyone to it. Waiting for the next book to come out before I re-read again. 

&#x200B;

Both amazing series' though, what are some of your other favorites? I feel like we have similar taste!"

leagueoflegends,fcvrqbf,t1_fcvqg0f,1578008605.0,"Fuck it, I'll waste a few minutes of my life breaking it down for you just like everyone else has. An outlier winrate (55%+) doesn't necessarily mean the champion is broken if the playrate is extremely low. Yorick has maintained a high winrate for quite awhile now but you don't see people screaming for Yorick nerfs because it's a niche character played by few. The reason his winrate is so high isn't necessarily because of an imbalance in his kit it could be a number of factors. One of the primary ones is going to be that the people playing him know what they're doing because the playrate is so low it's primarily one tricks or pocket pick counters. Another reason is that lane opponents are unfamiliar playing against it. Conversely, a champ with even a 48% winrate but an 80% playrate would be absurd. 8 out of 10 games this champ is being featured in and it's still doing well. Everyone knows how to play against it, what it wants to do and it IS STILL DOING IT. That's when you start to see people wanting nerfs and screaming OP. That was an extreme example probably only ever seen by maybe Season 2/3 Kassadin but hopefully that explains it in a manner that makes sense to you. Lee sin has traditionally always had a very low winrate because of his high playrate. He's super unfriendly to new players but in the hands of a skilled player he's effective. That's why he's been at such a low winrate for years while still appearing to be effective in almost any meta."

You're the guy who can't understand how a 40% playrate champ with a 51% winrate is unhealthy. To be frank it's clear you don't understand statistics and don't want to learn. You're just arguing moot points with people, might as well be screaming the grass is blue."
