Malls were these places back then that were kind of like ordering things online except the thing you wanted to buy was right there and if they didn't have what you wanted you couldn't buy it or had to wait for it to come in to the mall store.   He used the sword to cut watermelons and beer cans in his back yard to impress his friends on Facebook.

funny,ff9bs2s,t1_ff8x9ty,1579709363.0,"I was at the orange big box home store a few months ago.  The one that is kind of like a depot for home stuff.  I was loading some lumber in the loading area and I saw a beat up truck pull up. The two guys pushed out a cart loaded with tools and threw them on the truck.  I didn't think anything of it except to note that the portable saw they picked was known for having a wobbly blade issue and they were not tying anthing down.  Then they pulled out and left their cart in the driving lane.  I thought that was rude so I pushed the cart back against the wall.  Then I saw that the employees were all watching out the windows.  They had just stolen all that stuff.  Not one employee even went outside.  

&#x200B;

A similar thing happened where 3 guys pushed a cart full of small expensive items to a waiting car sitting in the loading area in the middle of the day.  The car had no plates.  A bunch of employees watched them load the car with the stolen items but none of them walked past the doors.

My buddy and I saw a big box on a pallet and we thought it would contain like 2 air conditioners or something easy and we would inventory that whole pallet in 1 minute and go to the next one.  It turned out to be all full of panties in bunches of 12 in plastic bags with a huge list of all the different model numbers.  We had to count the panties and check each bag against the list to make sure they were all there.  In the end, we found one bag that had 13 instead of 12 and all the rest were accounted for.  We did ask the supervisor if we had to count each bag and we were told to just inventory it no matter how long it took.     Meanwhile, a team of girls went to the pallet next to ours and found boxes of hammers and tool boxes which they inventoried in a few minutes and then went through so many easy pallets that they were out of sight for the rest of the time we were counting panties.  It was 16 hours of overtime because I had just worked 8 hours and then took a shuttle van to the store several hours away, worked 8, and then a several hour drive back.

Bodhidharma refused, saying, ""how can you hope for true religion with little virtue, little wisdom, a shallow heart, and an arrogant mind? It would just be a waste of effort.""

The sauce is made of melted down Guatemalan Insanity Peppers, habanero peppers, whole peppercorns, and possibly rattlesnake venom.   No one would eat one.  They would smell it and gag or take a small bite and then go drink a liter of soda.    

I ended up with a betting pool going that I could eat 10 without drinking anything.   It was set up for a few weeks out when a fresh batch would be brought in for the Great Wing Challenge. 

I managed to eat 6 of them.  It was like trying to eat molten iron wrapped in molten glass.  The heat was not changed in the slightest by digestion and the next morning was like lava coming out.  My fingers were so stained with the sauce that I couldn't even rub my eyes until it wore off.

A few months later it was time for the Great Wing Challenge 2 and there was a larger betting pool for me to eat 10 wings and no drinking.   But this time I wore rubber gloves, shredded the chicken from the bones in advance and just ate the meat without putting my lips directly on the wings.

AskReddit,fctg17i,t3_eimxr3,1577942089.0,"At work we spent over a year preparing for Y2K.  We had a mainframe running Cobol for everything.  I was assigned to convert some old Rbase databases.   Everything was checked like 10 times.  I think we even had our mainframe backup several states away on call in case something happened locally.   We even upgraded the phone system.   Six months later, I was working my normal job and a weird error came up in a weekly report that I got from the mainframe system.  It took me awhile but I figured out that it was the only Y2K bug that we had and that it had a six month delay due to the maths.

Ten years later, I was managing the phone system and looking into doing another upgrade of the system.  I discovered that the guy (now vice president) who upgraded the system for Y2K had never canceled a bunch of special radio interface phone lines to equipment that had been removed.  This resulted in $660,000 in expenses over 10 years for lines that did not plug into anything.  When I canceled it, the only thing that management said was 'Great, I have an extra $66,000 in my budget for this year'.

After Y2K I solely designed and built a system that handles our dispatched orders.  It took me 13 months to build, test, write the manual, and train the employees all by myself.  It was a thing of beauty that ran for 6 six years before it was replaced by a system bought from a vendor.   On the first new year's day that it ran, it crashed due to 2 duplicate order numbers.  It turns out that our mainframe jobs were delivering orders in two parallel runs and both order sets start with the 2 digit year followed by 00000000.   One order stream gets like 1000 orders per day and the other one gets maybe 20 per day.  So the only day they could possibly overlap is Jan 1.  Every year.  It was the only thing I missed in the design because I had never seen the orders on Jan 1 specifically.   After I fixed it that first Jan 1, I had a year to patch it before it happened again so it was no problem to add a prefix to one order set."
