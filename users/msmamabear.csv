Is there another way to approach your work responsibilities that will help to relieve the stress there? As for your band mate, it‚Äôs so hard to lose those friendships that link to fond memories. But, inevitably and for various reasons people change. Start looking for another group you can play with! You might find new lasting friendships there.
