Edit: I kid. I just couldn’t resist.

PoliticalHumor,ffalwoc,t1_ffalpw4,1579739019.0,Sure thing. I was also going to point it was the wrong word but I remembered encountering this use a long time ago and looking it up then. I personally prefer differentiation.
PoliticalHumor,ffalavw,t1_ff9ofjn,1579738598.0,Seems that they can be used interchangeably but it is not so commonly done. According to [this] (https://www.writersdigest.com/online-editor/ensure-vs-insure ) the NYT and The New Yorker treat them as the same.

askscience,fevknkk,t1_fev2ed8,1579398527.0,"So just fyi, glycogen breakdown is glycogenolysis, not gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis is a totally separate process where glucose is synthesized de novo, using carbon backbones from amino acids and is energetically costly."
askscience,fevk2tp,t3_eql38r,1579398306.0,"The liver is the major gluconeogenic organ (kidneys and intestines help out in a minor way but liver is the main one). Glut2 is always expressed (with a circadian pattern)  and what helps determine whether glucose is exported is the balance between PCK and GCK activity, which are two enzymes that remove and add a phosphate group to glucose. Glucose with phosphate group (Glucose 6-Phosphate) cannot go through Glut2."
