The threat and competitive drive to beat the other guy by throwing massive amounts of manpower and money at the problem is a sustained pressure for decades that drives the technological revolution. A one off devastating event doesn't do that.

No Berlin, no WWI. No Russian Revolution. No WWII. No cold war.

That's 80 years of sustained pressure by belligerent antagonists driving technological advancement.

UNLESS, in this timeline, Berlin is replaced by Tokyo and Japan takes Germany's place. The difference there is Europe doesn't become the battlefield and Japan's exploits would be largely Asia centric, so ignored by Western leaders."

However, it can very much be a localized norm in your geographic area as an acceptable work culture.

My advice to anyone in this situation is to get out of it. Find a different company which values your time and worth. I know that's easier said than done, but I have seen far too many people stuck in comfortable situations for far too long because they simply don't know what else is out there. Remember, people don't quit jobs, they quit bosses. 

I've been with my company for 8 years and in my industry for 20. I have no plans of leaving the guys I work for. However, I STILL go on interviews inside and outside my industry. I like to know what's out there and if I'm getting a fair shake."

If that means the government has to increase revenue streams to pay for social programs, so be it. We don't ask corporations to launch product lines without a way to pay for it. The difference is, they go to banks to get their funding and governments go to taxpayers for it. 

I'm also a believer that large organizations use economies of scale to benefit their bottom line, which benefits shareholders, regardless if that bottom line is a government or a corporation. So bulk purchasing of some products/services like healthcare is in the government's best interest, since their profit is derived from the safety and security of their citizens, not actual dollars.
