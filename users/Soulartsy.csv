offmychest,fdf23rt,t1_fc6j9hm,1578351559.0,I’d understand if you tested up! It’s so weird to think that people care about us more than we think sometimes. And that’s such a good feeling
offmychest,fdf20ws,t1_fc59j0n,1578351508.0,Thank you!!
offmychest,fdf20ck,t1_fc4tzw5,1578351498.0,Thank you!

offmychest,fdf1xil,t1_fc4e92c,1578351447.0,"She’s just not a feely-feely person, but I did tell her that was so sweet of her and I’m happy she put it up!"
offmychest,fdf1uoj,t1_fc49fq6,1578351397.0,"No, no. We’re both women, and in our nearly-late (oh dear, I feel old) 20’s. So it’s just a friendship :)"
offmychest,fdf1qid,t1_fc49380,1578351325.0,"Exactly, it’s really overwhelming to think about! My friends’ mother apparently loves me a lot and always asks about how I’m doing. That whole family is so sweet and kind! 
I actually had photos of her placed in my apartment as soon as I moved in 2 years ago haha"
offmychest,fdf1i2w,t1_fc40k11,1578351180.0,You’re a good friend!!

offmychest,fdf153a,t1_fc49oye,1578350955.0,Yeah! I’m embracing it like hell haha
offmychest,fdf13l0,t1_fc3wbl0,1578350928.0,"I actually already have pictures of my friends at home, that’s the first thing I did when I moved in. So I’ve always felt one sided (if that sounds right), and I was really, really touched when she sent me a snap of her hanging pictures up"
offmychest,fdf0ys8,t1_fc3776y,1578350844.0,"I used to think I didn’t, even though I’ve known her for 10 years haha, but after that it made me feel more secure in our friendship."
offmychest,fdf0vlm,t1_fc32nux,1578350786.0,Yes it does!!
offmychest,fdf0uo8,t1_fc39olt,1578350770.0,Haha thanks! I’m a very short person at 5’1. So I don’t know if that helps haha
offmychest,fdf0qo8,t1_fc2xui5,1578350700.0,"Exactly! She probably doesn’t even know how much it means to me, which makes it all the more better"
