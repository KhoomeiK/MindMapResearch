confidence,ffbcef1,t1_ffay1mi,1579759508.0,This will get you a bigger bum if you want one but as others have said women come in all shapes and sizes and different men want different bodytypes. Love yourself! Or if you canâ€™t get past it definitely get to the gym as you can do a lot with weights
Hobbies,ff2lvqk,t3_eqmera,1579512355.0,"What about looking for a scouts or girl guiding group (rainbows, brownies, girl guides)? They are all over the country!"
bristol,fewkc2r,t3_eocybq,1579412524.0,Could be exhibition at the cori tap which they only serve in half pints. Definitely try it if you havenâ€™t already!
bristol,fewjfqc,t1_feq5l94,1579411838.0,On Friday afternoon I think it might be that thereâ€™s extra people going away for the weekend
namenerds,few0ly1,t3_eqn83h,1579403772.0,Anastasia is lovely! I also really like Arabella and Florence
socialanxiety,fev7llc,t3_eqjw9x,1579394123.0,Yes!
houseswap,femeebc,t3_ectcza,1579251171.0,"Iâ€™ll swap on the unlikely chance you want to come to Bristol, UK! ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§"
relationship_advice,fe6c71s,t3_enx593,1578886723.0,"Youâ€™re doing amazing, youâ€™ve just got to give it time. Hope you feel better soon"
careerguidance,fdkyn4m,t3_elpsdi,1578513859.0,Could you work up to managing a zoo? Would that have a decent salary?
CsectionCentral,fdf8utl,t3_ekptyu,1578356010.0,"Have you seen a physio and checked for separation of your abdominal muscles? They can give you exercises to restore your core and bring your abs back together. Pilates is the best for postnatal recovery, a postnatal class ideally! Go really gently to start with!

Also do not do any sit ups or crunches until youâ€™ve had your abs checked that theyâ€™re back together. You can try and do this yourself but I had my physio and Pilates teacher check this for me"
PCOSandPregnant,fdf8apr,t3_el1hbq,1578355630.0,The IAMAT website says Pregnant travellers should seek counselling from a travel medicine specialist and carefully consider the risks associated with travel to this country.
PCOSandPregnant,fdcvowa,t3_ekgvua,1578285658.0,I wouldnâ€™t personally go back on the pill as PCOS is a hormonal issue and the pill messes with your hormones! My cycles were all over the place coming off the pill - normally 60-75 days long. Have you considered the copper coil? It isnâ€™t hormonal at all so itâ€™s a good option for women with PCOS
confidence,fdcvhvk,t3_ekgmu8,1578285494.0,Woohoo thatâ€™s great! Have a happy year!
findapath,fd9whg6,t3_ek4d08,1578238849.0,I felt like this a couple of years back and now Iâ€™ve had a baby! I also wish Iâ€™d travelled more during university summers. Why did I waste that time?! I always had a boyfriend holding me back which really annoys me. Before having our baby Iâ€™d plan one big 3 week holiday a year where weâ€™d do a road trip. That would really keep me going! Can you take a sebatical from work? Can your SO travel with you and leave your pets with friends or family? Once/if you have children youâ€™ll probably look back and wished you had taken the opportunity to travel now while you have little holding you back!
socialanxiety,fd9729w,t3_ek7qey,1578229316.0,"I think if you are close to family members and youâ€™re getting social anxiety with them, itâ€™s something you should definitely seek some professional help with. If itâ€™s with other people it is easier to manage but you donâ€™t want to have anxiety with the people you live with/are close to or it will be a daily occurrence!"
socialanxiety,fd968u9,t3_ekanej,1578229059.0,"Definitely speak to someone at school. Theyâ€™ll be asking questions and they will know how to make you feel comfortable. Your mum obviously doesnâ€™t understand what itâ€™s like to have social anxiety. Your counsellor should really be able to help or recommend you see a therapist if needed, and then hopefully your mum will listen to! Youâ€™re not boring! Try to get out of that state of mind"
socialanxiety,fd94xp4,t3_ekc780,1578228478.0,Well done for still going! I did used to get this especially if it were people I didnâ€™t know so well but I donâ€™t seem to get it anymore. Hopefully the more positive experiences you have the less it will happen!
confidence,fcxa2fj,t3_ejbnto,1578056971.0,You do you! No rush at all. Youâ€™re a spring chicken!
socialanxiety,fcx9ogb,t3_ej9sk8,1578056590.0,Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re going through this. How are you one to one? This might be a bit of a random suggestion but near me thereâ€™s a charity where you are paired with a elderly person thatâ€™s quite isolated to visit them once or twice a week. I donâ€™t know if this exists near you but you might get something out of it as itâ€™s volunteer work and only one to one. I would say very small steps are what you need and if youâ€™re therapist isnâ€™t helping try a new one!
socialanxiety,fcx9dix,t3_ej8for,1578056299.0,Icebreaker! Tell us about something you did at the weekend... I cannot remember a thing ðŸ˜‚
relationship_advice,fcwy9k3,t3_ej3aq7,1578042803.0,"If sheâ€™s intending to be a SAHM then thatâ€™s fair enough to expect you to support her, but whilst youâ€™re both working you should both contribute! Iâ€™d have a serious chat with her about the ridiculous expectations she has in her head. When youâ€™re married she would be entitled to half of everything of yours anyway so that should provide her with security. Was her mum a single mum and got screwed over perhaps?"
nosurf,fcbxswu,t3_egwg1q,1577592169.0,Have you looked on meet-up for introvert groups? Thereâ€™s one in my area. Otherwise you could still reduce time wasting online and limit your online relationships for instance using email only and only checking your email a couple of times a week
TFABLinePorn,fc17tyi,t3_efk1o1,1577310730.0,A line is a line! Merry Christmas!
confidence,fc17myg,t3_efdse6,1577310575.0,You are beautiful! Everyone is beautiful in different ways but you are seriously pretty so I hope you donâ€™t feel insecure about your looks!
confidence,fbz6fmd,t1_fbz5tk1,1577236529.0,Near me theyâ€™re Â£200-250 a month but Iâ€™m in a UK city. You said youâ€™re on a six figure income so I thought financially it might be an option? Might be worth the cost for the social benefits!
bristol,fbyt7k0,t3_ef777p,1577225686.0,"Just saw this article on the [Bristol Post](https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/go-bristol-christmas-day-youre-3649773?fbclid=IwAR0HyhzlKfX4WnyzRdP6q6dWjH1VUH7GVdIl6WmH4Yx16m1B2taiO2zs96g)
