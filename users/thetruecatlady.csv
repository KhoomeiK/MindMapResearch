offmychest,ff0bq6a,t1_fez2zf4,1579467341.0,Thank you so much for this. I’ll definitely check these resources out. It makes me feel relieved knowing that I have support out there somewhere and I’m really grateful for your help.
offmychest,ff0b0tu,t1_fezglan,1579467044.0,Sorry to hear the man sounded disinterested but glad he was able to stop you. Great job staying strong and fighting.

As far as I knew up to this point I was included in these plans and they were on their way. I figured it would only be a short while until they arrived so I didn’t want to leave and have them waiting on me, and before I knew it it had already been 3 hours. I had my own plans for today that I cancelled because they insisted on us hanging out."
AmItheAsshole,fewv6h7,t1_fewt0mn,1579419990.0,"I don’t mind that they get along, if they want to hang out on their own then they can. What bothers me is that they pretend to want me around and then waste my time when I can be doing other things with my day off. Instead of doing anything today I was sat on the couch expecting them to show up any minute because they insisted they were on their way when in fact they just couldn’t bring themselves to admit they didn’t want me there."
