I had a guy dm'ing me today just to call me a retard with no argument. Since he's in the anti-Trump camp with you, are you therefore as dumb as that guy? If the evidence you give for your view of half the country being dimwits is a random person you spoke to on facebook, maybe your view is unsupported?

No direct evidence Biden acted corruptly, but maybe firing the prosecutor investigating his son was because the prosecutor was investigating his son. This is an obvious logical step. If the guy was a little smarter maybe he'd acknowledge the lack of direct evidence and explain his belief as being formed on some facts and a bit of common sense. You using him as evidence that half the country is just like him is very confusing to me and I don't understand why you think this is an acceptable way of viewing other people."
AskTrumpSupporters,ffcmscn,t1_ffc2ucz,1579802776.0,"I literally explained in the quote that I already considered that. You're quoting my answer and just repeating the question. In sincerity with all due respect, I think you should recognize this and reflect on your ""something wrong with the way the wheels spin in their heads"" quote about the other half of the country. 'Half the country is dumb as bricks' is a simple-minded view propagated by the media to people simple-minded or disengaged enough to believe it. Whilst I understand and even sympathise with any person who has been deluded by the media, what I cannot sympathise with is people who choose to believe half the country is just way dumber than them and unable to form opinions from the most obvious facts - and are content to keep this view and never question it, even though it 1. doesn't make any sense and 2. it degrades their character.

Based on your logic do you think the vast majority of Trump supporters fall in this camp of being almost completely braindead? Do you assume the same about me? Do the arguments I have formulated support your hypothesis? In other words, do you think I'm utterly incapable of reading an article about how Trump is acting like a horrible human being through family separation at the border and coming out with the ""intelligent"" conclusion that Trump is a horrible human being? Because if that's your measure of intelligence, any primary school child is more intelligent than the president and half the country. This doesn't sound like an intelligent point of view to me, just an easy one.

By the way, you missed out on a camp. There are people who follow politics, people who don't follow politics, and also people who follow politics but don't follow them to the same place as you.

2. Well it's based on their way of thinking which is less emotional. To the extent which they do think emotionally, perhaps they are either empathetic to the baby or acting out of their own visceral reaction to what they perceive as mass murder of unborn children. If they were more emotional thinkers, maybe they'd empathise with the mother instead. The painful truth is we do not know what a fetus experiences during an abortion or if there is any moral consequence of our action beyond its experience. But conservatives more often than not accept the simple reality that we cannot be sure abortion is not a great evil, whereas leftists have ignored and talked around this fact for decades. I like to think modern conservatives are more progressive. Personally I support availability of abortion because I can empathise with the mother but not with the fetus. The fetus can't tell me what it feels and we may never know, but the mother can. I don't think it's a right, I think it's a medical procedure that should be avoided however possible - but available when needed.

You're just plain wrong. Ask any conservative in good faith to tell you if they care about the children separated from their families, and see what response you get.

We develop these modes ourselves as individuals and do our best to construct the most useful and / or correct way of thinking. Without any condescension, I do remember having that same view myself re: conservatives. It's in the name, right? They want things to stay the same.

Actually Trump's policies shift to match his base's views, not the other way around. I'd suggest you watch some Ann Coulter interviews about Trump if you want to understand why the republican voter base embraced him and how he actually just ran on popular policies and issues that establishment republicans shied away from. As she very well puts it ""He picked up a thousand dollar bill off the ground that nobody else would touch"". Regardless of whether he's a genius or an idiot, if he's the only one running on popular policies he is bound to win the vote. This is the same reason Hillary lost, and Bernie may have won.

AskTrumpSupporters,ffb7h73,t3_esfroo,1579753933.0,"I trust him to do what's in his own best interest. His interests evidently include winning and being popular. Making positive decisions in the eyes of his voters makes him popular, therefore I trust he will generally act in the interest of the country as defined by his base. This puts him leagues above any other US President of recent times, of which most objective Americans assume were all motivated by bribes.  


The rift between TS and NS is multifaceted, and it's not just about Trump. People on the left are emotional thinkers. They see a rich morally ambiguous businessman, and this is who they know to hate. Of course it's just common sense to them that he will act in the interests of the wealthy. The idea that this is what he's been doing is a media narrative that is very acceptable to the left, but isn't true.  


Why would he act in the interests of the wealthy? As the left repeats ad infinitum, he is only interested in himself - not other wealthy people or donors. By satisfying his voter base he fulfills his own self interest. As far as using the office of the President for personal gain, if we believed he ran for election for that express purpose then we would be very much against him. The truth is that being president hasn't made him richer, hasn't made his life easier or more joyful. Given that the only benefit to him in the very difficult job of POTUS is the chance to make a bigger better name for himself and the only way to do this is to satisfy his voter base, therefore his voter base has the right kind of trust in him to give him their votes. These are all conditions for having that trust, but the main source of it is simply that he can't be bribed. First off he doesn't need the money, secondly his image as a 'man of the people' amongst a field of corrupt politicians is worth far more to him than a bribe. Yes, we do think about this stuff when deciding our leanings.  


Would we prefer a president who's just as capable and patriotic but much less disruptive and antagonistic? Yes. Is there any chance of getting one? No.  


Don't be deluded - the establishment in the US will not allow to succeed any candidate with the interests of American citizens at heart. They destroyed Bernie's chance to win just recently and they're starting again now. They did it to Ron Paul several years ago. They tried to do it to Trump, but this time it didn't work. That's extremely significant in terms of modern American politics. Now you folks on the left look at him and say 'he's rich, he's combative and he's inflammatory - how could he be elected? We've never had a candidate like him before.' We on the right look at all these same attributes, and say 'yeah, we've never seen a candidate opposed by the establishment be successful. And we've never seen a candidate with a personality like his.' We make a connection between these two concepts and infer some causality. When the vote came up, conservatives had the chance to vote in an outsider who is not a career politician who we believe has American interests at heart. We did not get to choose who would be that candidate or what their personality would be like, and knew we may never get that chance. People on the left cannot accept the logic of this choice, even though all the facts individually are easily demonstrable and we are generally all on the same page about corrupt institutions. I think looking at the reasons behind that gets into some really thought-provoking territory, and will make for some great discourse in a few decades when we all have some perspective."

Arguments about the morality of the things America does in the Middle East aside, spending exorbitant sums of money on military expeditions without gaining anything in return is a net loss. His attitude to taking oil and his attitude to taking money from foreign powers in exchange for America's troop placement seem branches of the same tree. Whilst left-leaning people see this as mercenarial and incredibly corrupt, TS see it more as ""we're not going to lose money doing what we do"". I think I'm personally okay with recouping the expenses of war, but an immoral for-profit war would be a red line for me.

""Trump's first CIA director, urged the president to consider taking a more aggressive approach to Soleimani after showing him new intelligence on what a second senior administration official described as ""very serious threats that didn't come to fruition."" ""

So the option was put more on the table over time. Overall, the new information that has come to light shows that the option was previously considered when other threats were a possibility per available intelligence. It does not show that the decision to do this was made far ahead of time. The fact that this option was previously considered as a response to immediate threats, does not mean that there was no immediate threat when it was used this time.

Regarding him lying thousands of times, that number is way overblown and you should have a bit more skepticism when you read the articles that say that.

The type of honesty I expect is that he's not trying to delude his voter base in terms of principles. He does play off the principles of his voter base and takes advantage of pre-existing delusion in order to win, and he does lie / stretch the truth to bolster his image.

j\_la are you asking if I think, given the context, Trump's statement indicates he is more than just 'thinking about' taking the oil? If so, no.

AskTrumpSupporters,fdzrqsd,t1_fdziry3,1578794255.0,"I think it's clear that they did attempt to get some information. The thing is, most of his supporters even if they agree about this will not support action against him. They are distrustful of democratic candidates and perhaps even other Republican candidates, and feel Trump has been more effective in his job than most presidents. It's simply not in their interest to act against him. Even considering accountability and government overreach which is a big issue for most Americans, the much more immediate issue is ""if we don't have this guy we're fucked"".  


I mean, right now it looks like the alternative is a socialist. Alot of Americans would rather have effective policy from a president that crosses the line sometimes, than ineffective policy that could crush the economy (which has prospered under the leadership of the former)."
AskTrumpSupporters,fdzq80z,t1_fdz9it6,1578793281.0,"He's expressing honest uncertainties, I don't think ""Maybe you're wrong and I'm right"" is an appropriate response, which is the essence of what you said."
AskTrumpSupporters,fdzq0c5,t1_fdzmhiq,1578793156.0,"In my opinion, it's your comment that lacks self-awareness. You're obsessing over Trump's behaviour rather than trying to understand the actual point. Trump's pattern of insulting other politicians and public figures is completely different to the type of behaviour TDS describes. Without saying one is better or worse than the other, they are completely different.  


Any Trump supporter would be happy to clarify for you, and I would too, but you don't seem to want to understand. Remember you are in a subreddit called ""AskTrumpSupporters"". It's not about debate, it's to help you understand the other point of view."

worldnews,fdsrcwj,t1_fdqba9y,1578706948.0,"Using a small dick label as an insult is antagonistic. Is it fair to say people who do this themselves have small dicks?  
Personally I don't think so, but I do think taking your preconceptions about a group you dislike and projecting that onto their penis size says alot about yourself. There are definitely Trump supporters with much bigger dicks than you, and it sounds like the small dick label is something you use to delude yourself about this fact, which presumably makes you uncomfortable for some reason."
