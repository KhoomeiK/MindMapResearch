You want to make the chips that you have the most of worth the least amount of money. Whatever your blinds are, the whites should be the small blind. So if you play 25c/50c, then they should be worth 25c. From there, each chip should be worth 4 or 5 times the next level with a couple of exceptions (e.g. if your blinds are 50c/$1, the red chips could be $1). 

Even if the chips don‚Äôt align with the casino standards, you‚Äôll be much better off."
