I follow urbanize.la because I like to see what new intersting projects are happening around LA, my home town.  There is a lot of cool stuff but what is striking is that South L.A. is loaded with new city funded affordable housing units, not being built elseware in the city.   I imagine this is because land value, in the over priced L.A Market, is moderately better priced.

However, as we have learned in the last seven decades it's just not good to concentrate poverty in one area for various reasons.  Neighborhoods should be mixed economically for a vareity of reasons, including economic opportunity, transportation congestion, a culture/mentalaity of poverty, crime, exposure to different economic and social classes, school funding problems, better land use and a whole assortment of reasons others can articulate better then me."

They probably just share a name or you're just forwarding some BS.

tinnitusresearch,fen0med,t1_femc2ky,1579274302.0,"I am a year and half into this experience.  I have seen two regular doctors and one Ear Nose and Throat doctor.  So far no one can do anything.  As soon as I can afford it, I want to see another ENT because I wasn't fond of this doctor's lack of effort.

With that said, Number one thing is keep your cool.  Stay zen.  As this can have a strong emotional impact. Acceptance that this sound is probably, not going to physically hurt you, just annoy the duck out of you.

So for me the tinnitus is always there but the volume changes.  When the volume is lower I can go about my life and even forget about it for awhile but when I have  a spike life sucks.    It's much harder to concentrate.  It's much harder to work or even enjoy life.

I don't know if this is scientifically founded on anything or just my imagination, but I feel multi-vitamins bring the sound down.    I've reduced my caffeine intake as a lot of things I've read say don't consume caffeine, on the other hand there are studies that say caffeine is fine.    I read that Melatonin, a non-prescription sleep aid, can help.  But only take when it's Ok to take a nap.  I took it for a while, but I can't decide if it helps.
 It's hard to guage what works because often the effects are not immediate but the next day or you have to take it cummulatively.

I've read, but have not taken any, that anti-depressents might help. Personally I don't want to mess with those as I beleive they can rewire your mood chemistry, to the point your body stops naturally producing these neuro chemicals.

About six months ago people were posting on this forum about pscydelic mushrooms helping or curing their condition.  A friend of a friend, got me some.  I took them on a couple different occasions and they did nothing for my tinnitus.
I've seen people post here about wax build up inside the ear canal, and the clearing of it, fixing their condition. When next I can go to ENT I want to ask if that doctor can check that out for me.

The things that cause spikes for me are:  Loud noises, stress, and marijuana."
tinnitusresearch,fekstpc,t1_fek5nba,1579206875.0,"A percentage of people who have tinnitus also have hyperacusis. This is where you experience pain, discomfort or a tinnitus spike triggered by sound, such as loud music, a dog barking, a stupid loud motorcycle....etc.

The tinnitus spike is not necessarily permanently louder.  It usually goes down again.

I have hyperacusis, and it sucks.  I can no longer have the same enjoyment of loud environments that I use to.  New Years Eve, brought me a three day long tinnitus spike and it wasn't even that loud.   Now, I don't care how I look or if my girlfriend gets upset that I'm not partying. I'm either wearing ear muffs or I'm not going.

Side note:  Tinnitus and hyperacusis are invisible handicaps. People can't see these conditions. They forget and drop that loud piece of metal five feet away, and then they'll do it again a week an half latter, only to do it again three days latter.  It might be good just to let people know that, right now, you have this thing, and to please be mindful of the loud noises they generate in your presence.

People post here that their problem was solved.  Others post that they have had it for 9 years or all their life.  I wish you speedy healing."

You don't have to make your neighborhood shitty as  some have advocated here. We all deserve to live in and enjoy our community.

Off the top of my head: 

\- Rent control, including making it  harder to evict people who have done nothing wrong.  
\- Affordable housing requirements,   
\- Affordable housing incentives.  
\- Programs to allow existing neighborhood citizens to more easily transition into a mortgage. (down payment assistance, education,   
\- Laws or taxes for empty housing.  (Many investors buy, sit and flip leaving houses empty and unused.  They are only economic vehicles)  
\- Regulating AIR BNB  Some people buy dozens of houses and run them as little hotels, taking long term housing out of the housing pool.  
\- Get rid of shitty city council officials who do little or nothing to protect all of their citizens.  
\- Workforce training so that citizen can gain the skills, to get good jobs, so that they can afford to be homeowners in their own community..  Utlimately, the problem lies in economic disparity:  Where good people, cannot afford to live in their own neighborhood.  We need to lift up our people, train them and educate them."

LosAngeles,feciaqi,t1_fdse7zu,1578974590.0,"Not entirely.  You just might not get your first choice and you might pay a little more then you would like.  My partner and I bought our home a year and a half ago.   Our price range was at the lower end of he market (what would have got you a nice home five years ago.)  We initially wanted to get a fixer in the valley. It was disheartening as one after another the word came back that the price on this fixer went up a hundred thousand and they were now only accepting all cash offers.  We were about to start looking for apartments because our current landlord of nearly 20 years, was kicking us out, to remodel and tripple the rent.  Thankfully she gave us time to find a new place but our deadline was fast approaching.  


So, we decided to start looking in South L.A.   It was not the same story at all.  Another bidder, a flipper, offered 10 grand more, we matched it and the seller went with us. (thank god).  We thought South L.A. was kind of sketch prior to moving here, but after living a year a half here, we've discovered it's actually kind of chill and way more central then the valley.  Both of our commutes are way better then they otherwise would have been all be it the commercial corridors are admittedly more gritty.  


My point is we too, thought that home ownership was out of our reach, but it wasn't."
LosAngeles,fecddzz,t3_en0708,1578971272.0,"It all depends on how the deal is constructed.  For example I recall reading an article in LA Times five years back about Orange county toll lanes and the inability of the OCTA / Caltrans to expand much needed regular lanes due to contractual obligations to the private, for profit toll lane operator to limit capacity.  If memory serves me correct, Orange County had to pay sizable amount of money to the private operator to add a lane in crippling traffic..  That kind of deal is not good for the public.

These lines should remain publicly owned and controlled. The public should determine fairs. Revenue sharing is fine;  Advertisement revenue is fine, easement revenue, co-development all fine but nothing that would give a private entity undue control specially if the bulk of the funds and the land, are coming from the public.

Lastly, the contract should be able to be terminated, expire, and/or renewed.  Nothing in perpetuity.

Perhaps the Pacifc Electric, Red and Yellow Cars would still be around if they weren't privately owned.  That was a massive network."
