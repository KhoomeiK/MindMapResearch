fightporn,ff03nde,t3_eqx7yh,1579464796.0,"I find it really strange a lot of comments are actually applauding that sucker punch from behind at the end of the fight when dude was CLEARLY out of it, when I've seen plenty of videos here in which the racial roles were reversed and the aggressor was called a pussy, bitch, coward, etc. for the exact same thing. Interesting."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fdzvy1q,t1_fdzc5yg,1578797086.0,"Completely inaccurate. Most of the time people can't even recognize a Pitbull and when people go into hospitals because of bites hospitals have to rely on the victim, bystanders, or family to tell them what happened, which refers back to my previous point. More to this, it's almost become a misnomer for ""canine as yet unidentified."" And much more recent studies show pitbulls are consistently along the ""seldom"" to ""never aggressive"" end of the scale."

It's hard to find anyone for me to play with aside from 1 friend of mine (who's in the same situation), let alone a guild that won't kick me out because I haven't logged on in 2 weeks :("

PublicFreakout,fcav2vr,t1_fcafts0,1577577192.0,"I'm in school now to become a teacher. When it comes down to it, people don't teach for the money. Most it's a passion. You have to want to do it, and god damn does the satisfaction really hit home in the end. But states seem to almost willfully believe you don't need that much money to live with the way they cut teachers salaries and schools budgets. It's disgusting and disgraceful.

Edit: this video is one of the reasons I wanted to become a teacher as well. Hopefully to try and enact some positive change in the way the next generation is taught and hopefully they can influence the generations that follow.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fc24bgd,t1_fc1s4bc,1577339865.0,"This. At one point they were America's favorite dog for the fact they were seen as a simple, no frills, straight up, American muscle, blue collar working dog. They're reputation was hit in the 70's when the media was on a mission to stamp out dog fighting for good. Between them and the AKC's push towards specific breeds, pitbulls rep got treated harshly and as such attracted the wrong crowd, which would use them for nefarious means and in turn worsen their reputation even further. It's all a really interesting backstory."
