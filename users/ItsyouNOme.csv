Dreams,ff5wv4w,t3_erqb5u,1579612932.0,"Probably a warning something is not right. As a rule you should never be with someone who left someone for you, they could do the same to you.

I think the baby and the blanket represent comfort and a safety net, while the demon represents danger and risk. Since the baby didnt allow the stranger in the blanket it could be seen as a sign of change, and potentially not a good one (especially work romance since this dream took place at work).

The gun could represent making a solid found decision, you both can use it but you don't. Not sure what the spirit with three eyes could mean since the third eye seems significant."

mainecoons,femruvk,t3_epxsdx,1579267815.0,I wouldn't have thought so unless it is a cross breed. The pointed ears with the fur flicking off is usually a give away. If they aren't charging maine coon prices and you love them go for it. If it is specifically maine coon you want they should all have documents with their family line of 3 generations minimum on them.

FinalFantasy,fci2fqc,t1_fcfz3bi,1577656941.0,"Every update is similar. It maybe different dungeons but it is the same formula for an update near enough. 2 dungeons and a trial. Content wise it is too ""safe"". The stuff I enjoy dies out too fast like diadem. I pretty much wait several patches now before I rejoin and it can all be done in 1-2 months (about 5 - 7hours a week).

I would like more risks. Just my opinion though. Take it as you will."
