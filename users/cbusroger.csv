Columbus,ff693xq,t3_ergpp2,1579622023.0,"They went up another 5 bucks this year.  Menus seem to be expanding.    


I still laugh at how me and 3 friends went to Hyde Park a few years ago for $30 each, then proceeded to order a 90.00 bottle of wine.  And another, and then another.  It was a fun night though."
Columbus,ff66xyx,t1_ff63lps,1579620595.0,It wasn't.  The peppercorns provide a nice spice that kills your taste buds.  It was a good level of spice that didn't build over time.  I enjoyed it completely.
Columbus,ff5yqyl,t3_eqy7kb,1579614554.0,"This place is legit!  Had the Szechuan noodles yesterday, just as pictured above.  Perfect spicy level, not too hot, not too not.  I didn't even have to doctor up the broth, it was perfect the way it came out.  Noodles hand-tossed and cut to each order."
Columbus,ff5yn3z,t1_ff21p4l,1579614466.0,"If hand-tossed made to order noodles are your thing, give Noodle Topia a go.  It's on Sawmill Rd north of 270.  New place.  We had lunch there yesterday for the first time and it was amazeballs.  Can't wait to go back.

Man given the prices I would hope so!  14.00 for a baked potato to go alongside your steak is crazy."
Columbus,femqfgy,t1_fej63oc,1579266575.0,"Agreed, we flew Allegiance to Florida in October, and it was fantastic.  We are going back in September, and I wouldn't hesitate to fly Allegiance again anywhere.  Our tickets were 112.50 nonstop round-trip including taxes and fees.  I could have made the trip with clothes/items in a backpack, but the Mrs of course had to take all her stuff, so there is a checked bag fee.  Still not bad though."
Columbus,femq52h,t1_febwle2,1579266311.0," 

Replace Westerville with Hilliard and you got a good list. I lived in Dublin/Hilliard for the better part of 20 years, and my ex still lives there with our children. Excellent schools in either district. I live in Westerville now (because I got an awesome lease deal), and while it is nice and close to both Easton and Polaris, it wouldn't be my first choice to raise children in Columbus.

Ironically, I'm looking to get back to Florida in the next couple of years. I grew up down there. I'll take the hot summers over the snow and cold winters here anytime."
Columbus,fejyu1d,t1_feijsqf,1579188947.0,Thanks!
Columbus,fegitwx,t1_feg6c3v,1579094099.0,"Yeah, my friends used to bring these delicious caramel waffle cookies with them from Amsterdam.  Then we shut down the Amsterdam office.  I found the same cookies at Jungle Jim's.  It's worth the trip just to check it out.  That place is NUTS."

Columbus,feeppqn,t3_eonmst,1579038615.0,"This is Orkin marketing.  This is based on their findings on cities they treated, per the article, not an independent study.

Not to say these little fuckers aren't a big problem in Columbus or most anywhere, just saying this was based on 1 company's findings."
gifs,fdvkdv4,t3_emxaot,1578748360.0,I'd love to see the ass on that.

Columbus,fdre527,t1_fdpoh8p,1578683182.0,"Yeah those fighter jets make some noise.  You should hear a F35 taking over, or any fighter coming overhead on full afterburners.  Unreal."
Columbus,fdrdfe0,t3_ems87w,1578682970.0,Interesting.  Some good picks in there too.
Columbus,fdrcyt0,t3_emrazf,1578682706.0,"Had some fucker almost clip my rear bumper on 270NB on the east side yesterday, cutting over 3 lanes to get on the 70E ramp.  That was right after he cut across 3 lanes to get in the far left side so he could do approximately 85-ish before he cut back across behind me.  I was doing 75.  He nearly clipped my bumper and still passed me pretty fast.  He proceeded to ride the bumper of the other driver making his way down the ramp onto 70.  Sorry, people like that piss me off.  If you are late to work or anything else, that's generally your fault.  No need to put others at risk because of your mistake.

Driving in Columbus is making me look forward to my retirement in Florida where the only driving I will have to worry about is the golf cart around the retirement community."

Destin,fdebs3z,t3_ek85lm,1578335573.0,"We usually stay at  Okaloosa Island in September.  This past October we stayed in Destin for the first time.  I figured it would be still off-season.  WRONG, apparently schools in the south get what is known as a fall break.  I had no idea, it was almost as crowded like peak season.  We still had fun, it was just more crowded than expected.

Having said that, we won't be staying in Destin again.  The beaches are just too tight together - it seems every gulf front condo complex has a sectioned off part of beach for their guests.  It's nice to be in the heart of it all, but this September we will be back at nearby Okaloosa Island."

Columbus,fd3yckj,t1_fcy3gty,1578162716.0,Delany's Diner in Westerville is legit.
Columbus,fd3xjj5,t1_fcylmjd,1578162485.0,"I lived in UA for awhile and was close to the Godown location.  I've lived in Westerville for a couple of years and have been to the Cherrybottom Rd location several times.  I think the Godown location is consistently better and less crowded.  There is always a line at the Cherrybottom Rd location.  But, you can get the Gringas all day on special rather than waiting until 4pm."
Columbus,fd3wzer,t3_ejf1pj,1578162324.0,"Calling Condado ""good street tacos"" is an insult to tacos.

Went to the Easton location once.  Never again.  Packed, loud AF, tacos were not anything at all special.  Bakerfield's has this place beat by a mile, not to say they are close to the best in town."
cowboys,fcqw98w,t1_fco705t,1577893167.0,"I've been thinking #2 myself.  Either Jones hasn't found him a spot yet, or he has and Garrett is weighing options.  It's the only plausible explanation."
cowboys,fck4jbf,t1_fcjqr6j,1577716374.0,I don't see who they are going to bring on board that will influence such a huge change in a short amount of time.  I just don't see that kind of coach available right now.  And don't you even say Urban Myer.
cowboys,fck3sm9,t1_fck1j0j,1577715745.0,"He's a human being that's losing a job that I'm sure he absolutely loved.  I certainly like JG more than that dickhead Patriot's coach, and while it is past time for a change, I still feel for the guy.  He gave it his best shot, he just didn't have the skills to do it."
cowboys,fck3iw7,t3_ehf0nf,1577715512.0,He does seem like a good guy.  I'm sure this is one of the reasons Jones kept him all these years.  Being a good guy doesn't make you a good coach though.
cowboys,fcgz1qt,t1_fcgw5gv,1577645509.0,"I hear ya man.  I expect us to win today though, and Philly to win, and Garrett to \*finally\* get the axe tomorrow.

Bring on Urban Meyer."
cowboys,fcgjlzw,t3_eh571n,1577640875.0,"In the end, it doesn't really matter.  Even if we win today and the Eagles lose, we're just going to get creamed in the 1st playoff round.  Let the madness end right now.

I know, not spoken like a true fan, but that's the reality of it all."
Columbus,fcgj4z3,t1_fccmmjn,1577640656.0,It's been good for awhile now.  The food that comes out of that little kitchen is amazing.
Columbus,fcgj09x,t3_egyiqs,1577640602.0,"If you saw the shit that roams around there, you wouldn't have to ask."
Columbus,fcgir0g,t3_egyi4v,1577640490.0,"I'm kinda partical as they are only 5 minutes from my house.  I like them, a lot.  Having said that, I wouldn't consider them the best Greek food in Columbus.  They have a good Gyro, make killer subs (try their double Italian), Rueben's, and killer onion rings.  Those are not Greek foods for the most part, but all are good, great prices, and great portions.  The lemon chicken soup isn't to be missed either.

I like the Happy Greek in the Short North for a true taste of Greek food.  It's my favorite in town, though I will check out others noted in this thread.  Thanks everyone."
Columbus,fbv4feb,t3_ee9252,1577125249.0,"I would suggest she try to resolve breaking the lease with the leasing company directly.  If she has legitimate concerns about her new neighbors and she has voiced them to the landlord, they might be willing to drop the 1 month rent fee.  If it were me, I would make every effort possible to settle this with the landlord and move, rather than resorting to court.  It sounds like she has very legitimate concerns.  Has she asked them to simply opt-out of her lease so she can move?"
