TruePokemon,fevx62c,t1_fesu0om,1579402607.0,"Adding an extra layer of immersion is going to be ambitious but it’s nothing that the biggest media franchise couldn’t do.

As for quicker leveling, did you notice how empty the postgame was? You beat the league and essentially never have to grind your team anymore because they’ve already reached really high levels. This causes the game to kind of lose the magic it has in the beginning. I think slowing down the leveling would make progressing in the game more meaningful while providing additional space in the story."
TruePokemon,fevv3ha,t1_feuv2cl,1579401889.0,"I mean what purpose do pokeballs serve anyway beyond making travelling easier and offering the pokemon a safe place to rest?

As for shoulder mons, it could provide to be a way to let smaller pokemon spectate battles in places they couldn’t before. Your charmander can’t swim? Let him hop on to your shoulder.

Altough this would present new smaller problems such as making it a bit of a gimmick to switch between your shoulder pokemon, I think with an intuitive implementation and an easy UI it could work."
TruePokemon,fevt324,t1_feue8vx,1579401124.0,In sw&sh the player rides a floating bike on the water. In let’s go you fly around with aa balloon. Even in the anime most characters have suitable gear for harsher areas and limit using their pokemon because of this.
pokemon,fevr48i,t1_fevc6cx,1579400502.0,"I think you have misunderstood my idea. I apologise if I’ve not presented this concept clearly enough, but the idea was to actually not let the spectating pokemon participate in the battle. Their sole purpose is to gain exp in the background without interfering with the battle."
TruePokemon,fetfg99,t1_fet3oll,1579374920.0,"Ok how about this? After a certain point in the story you unlock a floating water pod for one of your fire pokemon which lets it participate in the water battles? Early in the game you’d have to catch various different pokemon but later on when grinding becomes too tedious and the wild pokemon become too strong, a key item comes to the rescue.

The idea behind this whole mechanic is to bring a realistic way to train your other non battling pokemon. It’s inspired from the anime where they don’t use exp. share. It wouldn’t make sense and that’s why I disagree with people who say that an on-off switch would be enough.

I agree with you that these water area barriers could introduce unnecessary complexities and discourage using certain types of pokemon, but really the point is to just make it as realistic as possible. With a well implemented balanced system, I could see it work well.

Gaining exp every turn would make it possible for your pokemon to evolve mid battle against the same pokemon."
TruePokemon,fet0ls9,t1_fesxi9x,1579370739.0,">	if I’m on a water route but I want to train my fire Pokemon

The game could exploit this obstacle as a feature. It would force you to use/catch other pokemon making your team more versatile. Also I mentioned that pokemon would get more exp. based on their weaknesses. In this case if your charmander manages to defeat a water type pokemon, it would gain boosted exp. and vice versa less exp. from a grass type.

Keep in mind that this doesn’t have to be the only way to gain exp.
Also how often do you encounter water areas in the mainline games?"

NintendoSwitch,fer2thu,t1_fer12v1,1579349036.0,"My reasoning behind this is because I think mk8d is already pretty demanding. I mean if you play in split screen the fr drops to 30 fps. 
By nintendo’s standards a sequel would push at least the og switch’s limits. Hard to compare when we don’t know how it looks like but I think both are equally capable."

I don’t do them immediately and use a counter that’s easily accessible from a widget on the lock screen. So now my counter says reddit 4 and youtube 3 meaning 35 push ups in total. I try to do as many as I can at once.

The point is to make it a bit hard to keep up with the push ups by lowering the time limit.

Start off with a more comfortable time limit and lower it gradually until you find it challenging to keep up with. For me personally it has successfully brought down my usage of these two apps by about 30%."

theperfectpokemongame,fcyy10g,t3_ej9ji7,1578089586.0,"I really liked the idea of ambushing a pokemon and earning one priority turn in a battle. Meaning that whatever move you use, you move first. Same goes for a surprising pokemon attacking you so you have to prepare with a defensive strategy.

However I wouldn’t hold my breath for a major combat revamp. I mean it would require expertise and high understanding of the system balance and besides it would push away people who liked the traditional combat system. I think it’s unlikely that the turn based combat system will change drastically anytime soon. Maybe in 10 years. Who knows.

I also liked your pokedex idea which builds upon an underused feature in the mainline games. There could be a button on the battle screen which brings up the pokedex and asks it about any known weaknesses and strengths about the foe’s pokemon. The pokedex would tell the type match ups, characteristic stats and possible abilities.

Walking around with 1-3 pokemon out sounds awesome!

There are very helpful guides to get you started on setting up your switch for custom firmware. You just have to make sure that your switch has the right model version to be able to do that based on its serial number. The guides will help with that.

Just as a word of caution, there is a risk of ban if you play online in cfw mode. So you mostly lose the online features altough there are working LAN systems if you’re interested. 

There is also a way to setup your switch to emulated nand, EMUNAND (or EMUMMC), to minimize the risk of ban. You can boot to your stock nand whenever you feel like it you want to play the games safely online again.

All in all I highly recommend seeing the scene for yourself. There are many other features that come with cfw, such as emulation, themes, streaming from pc, save backups, overclocking and much more.

I personally use the homebrew provided by SX OS and the dongle that came with it + the licence cost me 50€. There are free alternatives that work just as well but I recommend sx os since it’s the easiest one to set up.
