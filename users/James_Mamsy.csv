facepalm,fbzmsl4,t3_ef5bh0,1577252100.0,"-From a technical standpoint, Cats is a fucking marvel. They accurately put fur and tails onto humans with realistic lighting and physics and it’s pretty amazing. That said technology is so good that the ease of access (money to pay some poor animator)  to the maniac who thought this was a good idea is also a reality. 

-Also practical effects aren’t CGI (computer generated)

-I hope that screenshot isn’t from the George Lucas edits (I can’t tell not that much a Star Wars fam) bc then it probably is CGI, but from the late 90s and is noticeably worse than the original models put into the film."
