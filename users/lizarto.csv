mildlyinteresting,fetj76z,t3_eql1qk,1579376001.0,Just what exactly is going on there?
AmItheAsshole,fekhibi,t3_epng9r,1579200153.0,"NTA, you are in a relationship with her, a partnership of sorts, you have every right to tell your partner that you are ready to move on, as much for her sake as for yourself. Not to be unkind, but because that is not your preference. I feel you should support her in her decision, and remain friends."

AskReddit,fdiz7lq,t1_fdixsby,1578454447.0,Good Lord...that’s pretty bad. Yeah that’d do it for me.
AskReddit,fdix2ye,t3_elmfda,1578453009.0,"Most of my night paralysis experiences are when I’m quasi awake. Right between the point of asleep and awake, but more awake than asleep... and I get a super relaxed feeling and I know right away I’d better move any body part that I can so that it won’t happen. Sometimes that works and it goes away, most times it doesn’t though. 

Sometimes it feels like there’s something else in the room and once or twice I have seen something.  I have epilepsy, and more often than not, seizures will  occur during night paralysis so that I’m unable to see, wide awake, and paralyzed. Fun stuff."

AskReddit,fcym4hf,t1_fcy7spq,1578082551.0,"But how old is the kid?

Edit: are we talking about a teenage kid here or like an actual child? If this is an actual child,  in my opinion, you should just let it be. That doesn’t mean that the child can act disrespectful unchecked though..."
AskReddit,fcy6hk3,t1_fcy5e05,1578075474.0,"First of all how old are you and how old is the kid? 
Kids are the way they are for reasons, and the age of the child matters, you don’t want to crush someone just to give them a dose of reality. Childhood “annoyingness” is usually just a stage all kids go through."

cats,fcy470o,t3_ejiyiz,1578074464.0,"Sort of resembles the “butt scooch” that dogs do if they have an irritation  around their anus, or if their anal glands need to be expressed. I don’t know if cats are set up the same way though."

I am overly appreciative of gifts I receive, even if I know I’ll never use it because I know they spent their hard earned money and time getting *me* something. How could someone laugh at that.
