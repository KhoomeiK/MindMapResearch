I do certainly think while I play, like i said how i have a gameplan and how i adapt and mix up but i generally dont think too hard or worry too hard about things which I think is what plenty of people do, which while great for them, I just think for me just playing with intuition is better if you can."
smashbros,fexgsmx,t1_fexge49,1579430750.0,"yeah. I actively try to play tournament players who have a name to themselves a lot and do very well, so believe me, I do mix everything up, adapt, all that. 

but most of the time I think people have a habit of trying too hard which makes them ironically play worse. so I kind of lay off of it for a bit and dont think too deeply about thinks. of course I mix things up and all that, but then again my definition of auto piloting is simply just playing the game without too much thought, which in my opinion isnt bad if you know how to do it."

Idk man it seems weird. It's like it stands out so much, like every other character has been third party and he breaks it just to put in another FE character that he seemingly knew people would get triggered over. It's like he knew the corrin backlash but still wanted Byleth in or something."

buildapc,fc60405,t1_fc5yxtt,1577469367.0,"if you're asking on when to put the motherboard in the case then yes theres a specific time. 

basically lay your motherboard on the motherboard box and build on it. once there simply put these in order: 

1) ram > cpu > cpu cooler
next go to your case and if you have any case fans, install those;
2) install motherboard standoffs and align the motherboard with the standoffs with your ram, cpu, and cooler all properly installed prior
3) screw in the standoff screws through the standoff holes in the motherboard 
4) install your gpu and psu


make sure you applied paste first, but if your cpu already comes with a cooler then it most likely comes with paste anyway. for example ryzen cpus come with a stock cooler with paste already applied. 

also, this list is ignoring cables and plugging them in. of course you're going to need to plug those into the respective plugs and whatnot of course.

buildapc,fc4nihb,t1_fc4na6m,1577421981.0,that I'm not sure about the thermal pastes and whatnot. did your cpu come with it's own thermal paste preinstalled? you didnt mention if you cleaned the thermal paste off before reapplying it so idk. but I assume not since you're using your own paste. but if it did then that's probably why. mixing thermal paste is never good and adding more than the vanilla paste already on the cooler is never good either. what I would do is remove the thermal paste from the cpu + cooler and then repaste and see if it works. if not try another paste and see if it works again.
buildapc,fc4n4mr,t1_fc4mzxg,1577421638.0,"it should be fine if its on the desk. sometimes carpets really scuff up computers because they dont get the airflow out because the carpets just block airflow from the bottom. the psu and airflow cant get out and the computer freezes and shuts down almost instantly. 

but from what it sounds like repasting it could do the trick if your cpu is getting that hot."
buildapc,fc4mq42,t3_eg64ml,1577421282.0,"first let me ask you: 
before getting the parts I assume you researched what every part did right? for example the cpu does x and the psu does y and all that. by that point you should know where each part goes. for example ram go in their ram respective ram slot and cpu goes in with the arrow lining up, etc.

what I recommend you to do is watch a pc build guide as a general guide but if he or she confuses you while building dont worry. I recommend using your manual as the guide 90% of the time and 10% using a video build guide. build guides are rarely helpful in my experience because they dont have the same parts and often times dont show everything perfectly all too well. 

your MOBO manual will be the most useful and will be your guide in telling you where things go such as the orientation of your cpu and where to put your ram sticks, among other things that build guides might not touch on. if you have a general idea of parts and their placement and purpose following your mobo manual should get the job done without a build guide. 

another thing, some cpu fans require tons of force to lock. this is normal and it's okay to feel like youre using a lot of force"

buildapc,fc4lvk2,t1_fc4lqdl,1577420525.0,"correct. it's a scam in my opinion to pay for an operating system, something you NEED for a computer. 

it's basically like selling bottled water at over a hundred dollars.

buildapc,fc4lnyf,t3_eg4irn,1577420339.0,"Hello, you'd be shocked to find out, I bet, if I told you that most, if not ALL the things you can't do because of windows being ""inactivated"" can be bypassed or done other ways. For example, if you want to change the background, simply download a picture, plop the picture onto your desktop like any other icon, and right click the picture icon and click ""set as background.""   


Other methods like this can be done to change the themes, or even remove the logo that says ""Activate Windows"" entirely. Honestly, F Microsoft for making an OPERATING SYSTEM so overly expensive. Like, really? close to 100 bucks for windows 10? Seriously? What a scam  


I'm glad that all the things that they try to ""lock"" you can easily get around and bypass with other methods. If you want to remove the logo/watermark for example, you can make a batch file with certain commands that removes it.   


But besides that, windows inactivated is essentially windows 10 just with some very small minor inconveniences that you can easily get around if you really wanted to."
buildapc,fc4kzxf,t1_fc2ykq1,1577419756.0,"I understand your point. that's a common thing said anyway. most people go ham on their cpu and get stuff like i9 9900k's or whatever even if they get a mid range gpu. their reasoning is basically ""most people never replace their cpu ever and if you need to replace a gpu you're going to need to replace the cpu as well"" 

but a ryzen 7 3700x and a ryzen 9 3900x both are certainly capable of gaming for a long ass time. one is 8 c 16 t and the other is 12 c and 24 t. theres only a four core difference there and most games dont even use more than four. six might be the average in 2020 and itll take even longer for eight to become the average. so either way both cpus are very future proofed indeed"
