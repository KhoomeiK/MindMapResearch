Periods,ff82l0i,t3_es5lgq,1579664327.0,"A lot of girls can be nervous about tampons since  you actually have to insert them rather than just sticking something in your underwear. It can be scary, but it shouldn‚Äôt hurt (a little discomfort is ok your first time and a tiny bit beyond). There is also a risk of toxic shock syndrome, but that is very rare and you should be totally fine as long as you are changing them regularly. There are a lot of benefits to tampons as opposed to pads, but at the end of the day everyone should do what they are comfortable with. Using tampons isn‚Äôt dangerous or wrong or anything! You are all good my friend!"

My first two periods had the same pattern, two days of bleeding, one day with nothing whatsoever, then another day of bleeding and I was done. It was so weird! Then my last period did something similar too. It kept stopping/slowing down for short periods of time and coming back. The worst was when I took out my tampon after 8 HOURS and not a speck or spot of blood, so I was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the clear just in time! Yay!‚Äù That day I was flying, and after my first flight, which was about and hour, I wake up, the plane lands, and as I‚Äôm getting off I notice that I have bled through my underwear and sweatpants. Worst part? I had another four hour flight to go. Luckily I brought tampons, but seriously it was the worst. As soon as I landed and got home, you better believe I took the longest hot shower ever!"

Invading someone‚Äôs privacy is not a good way to become close to them, especially a teenage girl who is going through some tough times. There are other ways you could have gone about doing this, but barging your way into her life via her personal and private property was what you decided to do. If she read your journal, how would you feel?"

Your daughter deserves to know where she came from and who her bio family is. You are taking something important to your daughter, twisting it and making it about you. Why did you adopt if you can‚Äôt handle the possibility that your daughter would want to have a relationship with her bio mom? Her bio mom is her mother by way of blood, and you are her mom by way of care and love. Her bio mom didn‚Äôt just give her up for the heck of it, she gave her up because she HAD to. It wasn‚Äôt a choice, she wanted her baby to have a chance at life. I would re-evaluate your stance here and try to see it from your daughter‚Äôs perspective."

Periods,fdrx8be,t1_fdrqp6e,1578691101.0,"Ok. I am not sure then. My only thought would be how you are inserting it, but it seems like you are doing everything correctly. I would keep experimenting with angle and placement to see if there is any difference. If it keeps persisting, messaging your doctor could be a good idea."
Periods,fdrortf,t3_emvzyz,1578687513.0," Info: Can you feel it when it is in and/or is it uncomfortable? If so, it might be placed improperly and not far enough up. Make sure you are using the lowest level tampon for your flow. If a tampon is saturated in two hours go up a size. If it isn‚Äôt after a long time, go down one. Also, make sure you insert it at the right angle. Aim towards your lower back, do not go straight up. For me, putting one foot in the toilet seat while standing helps. If your issue continues, maybe try a different brand."

Periods,fd6676r,t1_fd657yg,1578186082.0,The vagina is the large hole between your legs and where tampons go. This is where you bleed out of. Your urethra (where pee comes out) is way to small for a tampon and can be hard to see and you anus (butt-hole) is self explanatory and most likely easy to find.

Periods,fd5f99z,t3_ek3enw,1578177039.0,"Make sure you are using the lowest level tampon for your flow. If your flow is light, use a light tampon. If regular, use a regular tampon. If heavy, use a heavy/super tampon. If the tampon is mostly dry when you take it out, go down a size and if you are constantly changing it then go a size up. A good rule of thumb is if after two hours it is completely soaked, go up a size. Using the wrong size tampon can lead to irritation(where the burning could come from) and higher risk of toxic shock syndrome(rare, but still possible). Rounded plastic applicator tampons go in easier and are less painful. Try adjusting your angle as well, aim towards your lower back, don‚Äôt go straight up. Putting my foot on the toilet seat and putting it in helps me. Hope this helps!"

It is your sister‚Äôs day, so she is in charge. She wants her wedding a certain way, and that is perfectly fine since a day like this only happens once. It is not your choice to decide what you are going to wear while in her wedding party. If you don‚Äôt want to wear a dress, that is perfectly fine, but drop out of the wedding first. As a guest, you can wear whatever, but alongside the bride and in view of other guests, it is your sister‚Äôs choice.
