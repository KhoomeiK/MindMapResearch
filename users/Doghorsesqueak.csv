Let’s talk about how four companies own damn near everything in this country due to unchecked capitalism. Let’s talk about how the 1% manipulates the market by inflating the hell out of it with misleading info, then places bets against it while the average Joe invests their entire life savings, makes bank off the resulting downturn, and buys up even more of the property for a fraction of a price.

(Which absolutely *shocked* me, because if that had happened in the US, I would have been looking at about $5K for an uninsured ambulance ride and trip to the ER.) 

Then I like to remind my nana how she waited months in the US to see a specialist for her back, or how my papa’s heart surgery was rescheduled 3 times, or how you can sometimes wait an hour or two in an urgent care lobby if you don’t have an appointment, and then you can shell out $150 for the visit *with insurance.*"
Damnthatsinteresting,fedx995,t1_fedp8x9,1579021826.0,"Yeah, I’m an American, and talking to older conservative Americans about taxes is ludicrous. They feel like tax is theft bc a) “the government doesn’t *do* anything for them” and b) “they *need* that money to pay for the services the government doesn’t provide for them.” All the while ignoring that if these social services were properly funded with an effective tax system, they would be cheaper and better for everyone, and the quality of living would likely improve or stay the same despite the loss of take-home income. But nope, they’re all “fuck you, I got mine.”

They also like to do this fun thing where they vote for policies that gut our social services so they can turn around and go, “see, look how shitty they are, you *socialist.*” It’s infuriating."

SapphoAndHerFriend,fdj124p,t1_fdiy0wb,1578455727.0,"Oh I don’t think they like each other at all for most of the trilogy, but there is some intense pull between them which you can choose to read as attraction or not. Kylo is obviously attracted to her throughout (look at the scene where he captures her in Force Awakens and compare it to his treatment of Poe at the beginning of that movie. He literally carries her bridal style onto his ship). Rey hates him the whole first movie, then hates him but maybe starts to empathize and see a glimmer of redemptive hope in the second, then falls in love with a version of him that doesn’t really exist until the end of RoS. “I wanted to hold your hand, Ben’s hand.” You could interpret that as romantic or friendly love, but there’s clearly some degree of care/ affection established between them by the end of RoS."
SapphoAndHerFriend,fdivly3,t1_fb1q21r,1578452040.0,"Mostly I ship it because Adam and Daisy had some sizzlin’ screen chemistry and my thirsty bisexual ass wanted them to make out, thank you. 

If you want an actual answer, the ship is similar to the Drarry ship in HP, which is also pretty popular despite being canonically toxic as hell. Couple reasons I think people like these types of pairings but specifically Rey and Kylo: 
1) Tension. They’re equals on two sides of a literal Force, and adversarial passion is easy to tangle into desire. It’s why hate sex is such a common trope in movies. 
2) Connection - they have an intimate soul connection with each other because they are a dyad. They know each other mentally and physically. Look at how perfectly in sync they are in the throne room fight or how many times they’re shown having one-on-one conversations and sharing secrets they don’t tell any other characters. Also they were totally gonna hold hands that one time before Luke interrupted. 
3) Potential (for redemption or hurt/comfort) - both characters have been through trauma and can empathize with each other’s family issues as well as their sway toward the dark side. I think it’s more mutual than the classic “good girl bad boy” trope because Rey is arguably not a good girl at all. She’s kind of a hotheaded baddie by nature who just tries really hard not to be. Whereas Kylo is a softie who is constantly pushed toward anger and aggression by his family, palpatine, or his own desire to emulate his grandfather. 

I don’t think this ship is healthy or that the relationship would have worked at all if Ben had survived, (Can you imagine? “Hey guys, we’re back! Don’t worry, Ben’s over the murdering thing now, be cool.”) but I also don’t get the people who claim that there was absolutely no context whatsoever for that kiss when Rey and Kylo spent most of the 8th movie eyefucking through their force bond."
