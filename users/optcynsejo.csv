He's not the most innocent or admirable character, in fact he's a bit of a zealot, but from the standpoint of the common people of the story the death of dragons was absolutely a good thing. Power corrupts and the whole thematic point of the Dance of Dragons is a war that started over nothing spiraled into a disaster that killed tens of thousands.

He was the leader of populist radicals who in desperation tried to destroy the key to the power of the ruling class. His influence waned as order was restored, and then he and hundreds were executed horribly by burning. I have a lot of sympathy for him and the other of the ""Three Kings"" during the anarchy in King's Landing."

* we know Aegon favored/loved Rhaenys a lot more than Visenya

* Whatever the contents were it kept Aegon from continuing the war or escalation (like burning every abandoned castle and town from dragonback) despite his immense anger.

* Unless Aegon thought his newly conquered kingdoms would grow war weary, the only reasons to stop the war were not wanting to conquer Dorne after all, losing the respect/command of his subjects, or some reason to preserve Dorne

* the letter could have provided evidence Rhaenys was alive (a confession/memory only she’s know, or her describing an item kept at Dragonstone that he confirmed)

* If Rhaenys was alive and I was Princess Martell, I’d say “she’s in a random castle, and if you attack there’s a chance you’ll burn your beloved sister. Leave us in peace.”"

Eight bastards compared to three “trueborn” is potentially suspicious, but (1) confirmation bias. We know these black haired kids are Roberts, but for all we know he had a dozen more other colored bastards that no one picked up on. After all the man gets around.

And (2) the royal children also have the blood of a family famous for their golden hair. Not that surprising, maybe the Lannister gene is dominant. Until people begin reading up on obscure history they aren’t going to pick up on anything too weird."

AskReddit,fe5buls,t3_enqs22,1578867428.0,"People curse for multiple reasons but ultimately it’s *because* a curse by nature is taboo.

When you drop something heavy you could yelp “Shucks” or you could shout “Shit”. But if you said “shucks” you’d lose a bit of social standing because it isn’t cool. And often cool is counterculture.

Now curses evolve over time. They fall in and out of fashion. Half of Dan Carlin’s infamous seven dirty words routine is barely inflammatory to us now, but there are new curse words that have taken over. I feel fine typing Fuck, Shit, and Asshole. I wouldn’t sweat too much blurting that out around my boss at work. Bitch was read by Alex Trebek the other night on Jeopardy perfectly uncensored.

But there are words that don’t fly, either alone or in a slur context. N-word, fa—-t, c-nt, calling someone gay. Why? Because the mainstream is now very much in support of racial justice and lgbt issues, so it’s edgy to not be. It’s not as pervasive but because of the acceptance of “typical” curse words, these words are being used at least in circumstances where curses are for shock value. Try playing any online fps with young teens to check me. One can argue slurs are different from curses, but we’re seeing a linguistic morph as words fill the vacuum left as fuck/shit become last generation’s damn/ass.

Now as to why it matters that teach kids not to curse. Almost no one will follow the “no cursing” rule to the letter. Just like you and I, kids will curse among themselves to seem cooler or edgier or more adult. But teaching kids “Hey don’t do this thing all the time” is the difference between a regular person who swears for emphasis in a story or when they stub their toe, versus that guy we all know that can’t go 1 sentence without using “fuckin” as an adjective. Not always a life ruiner but it’s not doing them any favors as they start off into society."

AskReddit,fchc4f6,t1_fch0bfz,1577649169.0,"You’re also acting like the sort of person to make a hitlist is a rational arbiter of their anger, instead of targeting people for perceived slights. Or for having a “good life”, “popularity”, or richness compared to the imagination of the targeter.

No more so necessarily than a random gunman or terrorist has actually been harmed by their targets versus their warped perception of what they think has been done against themselves."

It’s a calendar. It measures days according to an arbitrary attempt to link it to years, which 365.24:1 give or take.

Also which calendar, because there are multiple Mayan calendars."
AskReddit,fcggfur,t1_fcgbyuc,1577639673.0,"Yes bullying is bad and traumatic. But whenever there’s a thread on a bullied child planning or orchestrating an attack there’s always people that weirdly leap to their defense.

Or assume that there’s not a reason the kid is ostracized in the case of passive bullying (already acting weird or throwing up red flags). Kids aren’t psychiatrists and don’t need to include the outsider kid in their group if they don’t feel safe to. That’s the job of counseling to intervene and work with the kid to get them to be more socially receptive."

From a Watsonian perspective, it was a bit luck. It could have to do with some machinations by Bloodraven. And the doctrine of Exceptionalism meant that those Targaryens who had white hair and purple eyes could marry each other more “acceptably” than those with typical features. In fact, I don’t think we have any examples of 2 non-Targaryen-featured members of the family marrying."

My point is yes it is hard to fathom for some people. Guess I’m not like people who get tattoos. But there’s nothing I care about enough to want to get permanently inscribed in my skin. Because my opinion is it looks bad. And I guess that merits downvotes."

There’s no need for Silicon Valley to be the single dream spot for comp sci jobs, you can work remotely. (Not to mention all my friends from college who moved there hate it not just due to housing costs but demographics- the guys hate the 80/20 gender imbalance for our age, the girls hate that it’s all techbros).

Lets get some big name companies to set up shop in the Carolinas, in St Louis, in Phoenix, in Des Moines, in Chattanooga."

Also, if Lady Whent is somehow still alive and not dead, it’s likely she’s hiding on the Isle of Faces."

Someone better versed in sexual studies than me can chime in, but I didn’t get the impression that Cersei was bisexual. No more so than some straight girls kissing at spring break because it’s flirty to others, or straight man that may assualt another man in prison— it’s about the perceived notion of what they’re doing is “What’s expected” and they get off on that. (Not to equate those 2 examples, I was wracking my mind for examples where straight people do homosexual acts).

She was doing this for the *power* and domination aspect of penetrative sex that Robert had over her and that she associated with strength. Now that she fancied herself the power behind Tommen’s rule she exerts this in bed, and indeed goes on to not care when she hurts Merryweather. It’s a very dark look into more of Cersei’s psyche."

I’ve been downvoted to hell before on a “dating red flag” thread for posting I don’t like tattoos before. My guess is that people who have or like tattoos get defensive because it’s permanent.

It’s not like I’m a crotchety old person too. I’m a young twenty-something guy, just think they look bad and “quirky” at best, trashy at worst."
todayilearned,fc9g7rb,t1_fc8ewao,1577552216.0,"I agree with you. Tattoos look terrible to me, on top of not understanding why people would go through the cost and the pain. They all look trashy. Especially now that they’re so common, that people will get joke tats, or dumb motivational text, or tattoos in prominent visible places.

But good luck voicing that opinion online here.

In real life I don’t mention it, I just avoid dating people with tattoos. But people don’t like getting reminded of their decisions if they regret a tattoo I guess? It’s just a sure way to get people mad at you."

Honestly North Korea is terrifying because it’s a nightmare at all levels of society in a different way. It’s like *1984*. Not to sound classist, but everyone thinks of the plight of the commoners there, which is horrible. But imagine you’re a middle level  beaurocrat. One wrong word, stumble, cough at the wrong time, and you plus your ten closest loved ones could be off to a labour camp.

It goes all the way to the top. Who do you trust when you can’t misstep in front of anyone? Your wife or kids could sell you out. Your colleagues. You can’t form a conspiracy.

What could Kim Jong-un have done if he had even wanted to? He would’ve gotten offed and replaced with another half-brother, as a puppet or otherwise.

Just constant paranoia unless you make yourself the big dog and even then you’re only key to staying alive is keeping others too afraid to act, lest they be found out first."
