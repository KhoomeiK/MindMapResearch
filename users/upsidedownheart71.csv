Keep to your MFP goal, ignore your exercise calories (or, if you eat any of them, keep it at about 1/2). Since we tend to underestimate our food and overestimate our exercise, this tends to balance things out and make up for the margin of error."

Lost weight, now sleep like a baby and no longer need the heating pad at all. 

For years, my feet have also been swelling over the course of the day, everyday. Even regular Pilates wasn’t doing anything for it. I’m tall so figured my circulation was just getting wacky (doctor could also find no medical reason for it).

Only 2 people have commented on it: my husband and my boss (who was actively losing herself before her wedding). All comments have been neutral. An acknowledgement, neither positive or negative. And I’ve lost 20% of my body mass, so it’s definitely noticeable. 

My husband will say I look good in something new I bought, but he said that when I was at my heaviest too. But he also didn’t rush to deny it when I mentioned losing weight has made the couple of wrinkles I have are more pronounced now.

I chalk it up to most people being wrapped up in their own stuff. What’s a big deal to us, is not a big deal to them. If you’re not talking about, there’s really no need for them to. 

What matters is I feel better, feel I look better and a bunch of minor health complaints I’d chalked up to getting older have completely vanished. If somebody else thinks I look bad, who cares? They may not like my hair or my clothing or my personality either. 

As for the rude comment, it’s just that. A rude comment. It could be about anything. Weight loss makes other people weird. They probably thought your pleasure at being slimmer makes you able to handle teasing or a joke. Or they could be jealous. I would have shot back, “Then why do you look like such a downer all the time?”"
loseit,fdye0yi,t3_endfmu,1578778706.0,"Weight loss is 90% diet. Track your calories. I’ve lost nearly 35 lbs (was a size 10-12, almost back to a size 4) cutting portions alone. 

I’ve found that exercise is great for maintaining my weight and loss but does nothing to help me actually lose. 

It is not harder for women to lose than men. We do need less calories than them in general though. If we try to “keep up” with them in terms of our diets, we’re going to gain weight. 

Look up a TDEE calculator, figure out your maintenance calorie budget as sedentary. Subtract 500 calories and eat at that to lose roughly a pound a week (but remember, weight loss is not linear — there will be fluctuations and plateaus, but if you stick to the deficit, you will lose).

loseit,fcosp25,t3_ehw9zc,1577840495.0,"As a 48-year-old female who has lost nearly 35 lbs this year, I can comfortably say don’t blame menopause. It’s not what’s causing you to gain weight. It might put the weight in different places, but the actual gains are due to the same thing it always is — too many calories. 

Your metabolism hasn’t changed. As we get older, we need fewer calories. 100 calories a day you could eat a couple of years ago that you don’t need anymore? That’s 10 lbs you‘ll tack on in a year. To get it off, you’ll have to restrict by 200 calories a day. Or more. 

Also, as we get older we naturally become more sedentary (trust, 20-year-old you was probably getting 4,000 steps in before noon). So, need for fewer calories + less activity = weight gain. 

The good news is that you haven’t missed your window and you’re not doomed to being this weight forever. The bad news is that CICO is the only thing that works and it requires commitment."
