triathlon,feeibiz,t3_eo0das,1579034329.0,"FWIW most of these diets turn out to be gimmicks that proper scientific study debunks.  This is just the latest of many many of these things.  If you are training 2 a days, please just eat a normal diet of high quality food, an reasonable training support that works for you (naps, self or professional message, stretching, yoga or pilates ect). 

Also many of these all to often can lead to eating disorders or body dis-morphia.  So take a hard pass and keep on training hard instead."

GarminFenix,fdds763,t3_ekq990,1578322611.0,"My take based on the DC raimaker review

Wear OS still = ugh.  No triathlon/multisport mode support. 

"" As you can see, it’s mostly a WearOS device that Suunto has added their  specific sport tracking apps too. In other words, they re-wrote their  entire sport tracking engine and placed it atop WearOS. ""

And worst:  "" Finally – the last catch for endurance athletes is there’s no sensor  support. So if you want heart rate, it’s gotta leverage that internal  optical HR sensor. You can’t pair an external HR sensor, cadence sensor,  power meter, etc…""

My verdict: its a Burger King Apple Watch knockoff for the hard core WearOS fans."

GarminFenix,fcxocfh,t3_ejc7gr,1578067687.0,"If you buy it with a credit card, they often have some form of buyer protection (American Express really good about this for example).

I have a Garmin 5+, and its a nice mature product that's mostly sorted and has maps, music and most the features I need. 

Garmin 6 has more features, some really nice new to 6 features in theory (like Swim HR and other swim metrics), bigger/better screen and new feature support (5+ is sunsetted for that).  But its still a bit buggy right now, based on the Garmin forums.

I would still get the 6."
