BreakUps,fek9yd3,t3_eplehq,1579195673.0,"I was told my ex of 9 years started on Facebook dating like within a week of us breaking up.

Shit was like a punch in th dick so I know how it is. Its whatever at this point. You'll do better and find someone who respects you.

And yes hooking up for the sake of having someone to touch is strange as hell. I felt dirty afterwards. 

Try to focus on you. Your mind and body needs to discover new things, work out , take new classes, experience nature. He'll get a tattoo like I did"
BreakUps,feih1k2,t3_ep3nw1,1579138350.0,"Best just to vent to someone. Be it friends family or strangers. Anyone that's willing to listen. 

Feel free to reach out"
BreakUps,fecfyco,t3_eochy6,1578972980.0,I'm more power to you man. Not a safety net for her
BreakUps,feb0x2t,t3_eo9sr6,1578954336.0,"Goodnight. Love you lots. We'll be right here when you wake up, don't worry."
intermittentfasting,fdthj13,t1_fdt3kvw,1578716848.0,Yea man thanks for the support!! You truly are a inspiration
BreakUps,fdtaibc,t3_en15os,1578714050.0,Man that's really fucked up. Like it's funny as shit but damn that's depressing AF
intermittentfasting,fdt304g,t3_emwx2a,1578711251.0,Goddamn. I'm pretty much starting where you did. Hopefully I get the same results! So far my IF made me go from 220 to 160 but I still have that pudgy gut
BreakUps,fdo10mg,t3_eme2rk,1578596901.0,Get rid of it
BreakUps,fdns66s,t3_emd0i6,1578591751.0,"Reach out to friends. Maybe have a friend's night out or reach out to people you haven't contacted in a while.

This first few weeks are brutal"
BreakUps,fdnqss4,t3_em96vj,1578591052.0,"I was like this for a while. Even after the breakup I was looking out for her. Making sure she was ok, etc. She was in a tight spot so I let her borrow money like a idiot only to find out that instead of using it to pay some of her bills she used it to fly out to Oregon to meet up with a guy she was ""cheating"" on me with 

Then she posted some stuff on social media that pretty much low-key shaded me. 

That's when I realized....fuck her. I gave her all that I could and she treats me like shit."
BreakUps,fdnkyxq,t3_embk4u,1578587984.0,"Congratulations! Its good seeing someone move on from a breakup. Obviously if you were here posting it must've really fucked you mentally at some point. 


Our reality is our own to create,
And the sooner that you realize that
The sooner that you can change.
Or history will just hit repeat"

Our reality is our own to create,
And the sooner that you realize that
The sooner that you can change.


Or history will just hit repeat
And you will pass your poison down onto your child's feet.
And they will struggle, struggle to breathe,
Cowering in shadows that you cast they cannot see."
BreakUps,fdip9xm,t3_eljpnl,1578447984.0,"You did the right thing man. Good for you. 

Took alot of courage and self respect, the fact that you busted your ass to give the ones you loved a better life speaks volumes. 

You're a good person don't you ever forget that"
intermittentfasting,fcr78si,t1_fcopddz,1577897786.0,That whole cutting thing made me uncomfortable for a bit then I re-read it slower lol
r4r,fcr3skb,t3_eig5ka,1577896366.0,Just swinging by and saying fuck yea on pineapple pizza
intermittentfasting,fco8ksy,t3_ei872g,1577826180.0,See this is why I regret throwing old clothes away. Shopping is fun but so painful wallet wise
BreakUps,fcmejr5,t3_ehxciy,1577772384.0,Same shit man. Ugly hearts.
r4r,fcm5gzt,t3_ehu19c,1577764738.0,"Dat hair 

You need to put a fan and make it majestically blowing in the wind"
BreakUps,fcfisnl,t3_eh36b5,1577630447.0,"I blamed myself for a long time as well. I still partially do. When we broke she didn't really give me any closure so I kinda beat my self up 

Down the line she posted something on FB that was low-key shading me according to my sister and friends. 

I didn't realize I was holding her happiness hostage by buying her whatever she wanted, taking her out to eat, supporting her emotionally and physically. Not even 2 months and she found a new partner after 9 years of ""us"". Nice job on losing weight, your post literally is saying you got too hot for me and don't need me to comfort your insecurities.

Some people just have a hideous heart"
BreakUps,fc8s7uy,t1_fc8qia1,1577541040.0,"I second this 

We have to be stronger"
BreakUps,fc8rrio,t3_egma7y,1577540818.0,"Nah fuck that. She said she wanted to be friends and shit after the breakup and we kept in touch...... erratically. Even asked me for a grand to pay bills, which I stupidly did. 

But as soon as I saw she's been shit posting on FB I deleted everything for good."
BreakUps,fc8oh60,t3_egq768,1577539064.0,"It goes through phases.....sadness anger hate.....jumps all around for a while..

Take it out at the gym. That's what im doing. Helps me forget. When I do feel down I come to this subreddit to vent or offer my 2 cents"
BreakUps,fc771cq,t1_fc76hfo,1577499253.0,"Then it isn't meant to be. 

Don't reach out at all.  If he finds out about the guy you're seeing then hopefully he respects youre decision and leaves it at that. 

For his sanity I hope he realizes it's time to move on.

Figure out who you are in life. Don't let others hold you back."
selfimprovement,fc766bb,t1_fc7582n,1577498599.0,"Yea I know. I'm a idiot. But for the last 9 years she was my priority. Its hard for me to deny her in a time of need. 

But yea I think everyone's right. Money is gone. Just cut off the tail now"
BreakUps,fc760na,t1_fc75452,1577498479.0,"That's kinda how my ex broke things off with me. 

So from my personal standpoint I'm gonna have to say you guys need to have a sit down and actually explain what happened to finally figure things out so the BOTH of you to move on."
BreakUps,fc74xbl,t1_fc748t1,1577497632.0,Did you guys ever reach a conclusion to the break up? Or did things just break off with alot left unsaid?
BreakUps,fc73u96,t1_fc73h8z,1577496810.0,"I don't know the guy. But it sounds like he's trying to keep you as a backup in case things don't work out with other people. 

Just trust your gut, you've known him for a long time. Don't let your heart play tricks on you unless you are ABSOLUTELY sure. 

NOBODY deserves going through this kind of pain, especially more then once."
BreakUps,fc73k2m,t3_egjqib,1577496591.0,"He seems like he has a short fuse.

When you break up with him make sure you have your family or friends you trust that will intervene if things go south.

Just be honest and tell him the truth, how you feel. His temper is major red flag for a future husband."
BreakUps,fc736ic,t3_egk2ap,1577496304.0,"Similar story for me. I gave a girl my life from 21-30 only to find out she fell out of love years ago and was just stringing me along because of her insecurities. Now she hooked up with someone in less then 2 months. 

Shits fucked for both of us, especially this time of year.

Today I even found out she's been low-key shading me on FB. shit is excruciating.

But take the time to pick yourself up. Some days will be harder then the next as you already know. Everyone on this Reddit is supportive. Don't be scared to reach out to vent. I still do"
selfimprovement,fc6e1g8,t1_fc6dgfq,1577478360.0,Believe I want to do that. But I loaned her 1k to pay off a bill. Waiting for her to give me that back. Low expectations though. Should told her to ask the guy she was talking to to lend it
BreakUps,fc60muq,t1_fc5gwm0,1577469642.0,Yea man. She is literally saying she is too hot for me now and didn't wanna make it seem like she's a bitch.
BreakUps,fc0yd00,t3_efkk6j,1577303023.0,I know you are buddy. Don't let anyone hold you down.
BreakUps,fbz45yg,t3_ef92oy,1577234534.0,I miss her too. First Christmas in 9 years alone. God this is heartbreaking
BreakUps,fbz0jcz,t3_ef8qvb,1577231466.0,Your username is fucking me up man...
BreakUps,fbwf844,t3_eetf2e,1577148343.0,At least it didn't get to a point where the holidays feel strange without them.
