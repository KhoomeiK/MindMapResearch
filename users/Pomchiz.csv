And I also did warn that my opinion wouldn't be to well liked"
ontario,fek0dqn,t1_fejiu4i,1579189909.0,Wowza!! I have after school care with YMCA. I had the notice from before Xmas that stated it would take 2-3 days minimum before care could start if a strike was to Happen. So I am finding your comment interesting.
ontario,fejzspe,t1_fejfzsa,1579189549.0,"Ok I get what your saying, but beforehand there is alot more education for a EMS than ppl realize...it's not just 16 months. It's a tiered level of education, first you now need pre-health sciences. (1 year) than you can take the two year course for paramedic. Than with three years of education you have to work for two years to get on the job training. Than you go back to school for another couple of years to become an advanced paramedic, from there you work for three years to go back to school to finish your education. So roughly 7-8 years of education not including your on the job training. 
Sorry not trying to get technical but figured it should be thrown out here."
ontario,fejwwl3,t1_fejmw41,1579187717.0,Police are an ESSENTIAL SERVICE.
ontario,fejwoki,t1_fejif1h,1579187573.0,"Here's my 2 cents.
I am warning all it's not going to be liked.
Remove the strike clause. It's not just the teachers & government that is being affected here. In all honesty why should my child have to loose a day of education because of a contract negotiation? Seriously if it's about the kids than show up to work & do your job. Don't play the it's about the kids card if your willing to walk out on them so you can negotiate a contract. 
I am not for the PCs in anyway but this is becoming a bigger fish fry. I warned all when I posted my comments wouldn't be liked."

PersonalFinanceCanada,feixmz2,t1_feik9kw,1579150052.0,Simply put.. I say KUDDOS to the government. Assisting parents who are dealing with the BS of this so called strike.  If teachers so 'cared' than kids would be in the classrooms & TEACHERs would be as well. I don't give a damn I am an ESSENTIAL SERVICE field & we don't get half the perks teachers get & I am so sick & tired of this poor boowho us mentality. Make teachers an essential service...make them work for a full year ( like everyone else) than hit the 😭😭😭 button. Yes I am pissed & yes I am a parent & yes good to the government who actually is saying HEY it's not ur fault this is going on...were at least assisting with the financial crunch that this putting on families who have to work & need the money.
PersonalFinanceCanada,feiwo82,t3_ep5aha,1579149262.0,"All I can say is make teachers an ESSENTIAL SERVICE, it's mandatory for kids to go to school, than ur now an ESSENTIAL SERVICE as choosing to work in that field. Don't tell me you care ' when every few years you work to rule'"

PersonalFinanceCanada,fefnw5d,t3_eort5y,1579060460.0,"Oh pls don't get sad. Honestly I am not Rich (we live paycheck to paycheck like most people. I should try to save more (or at least try the 2nd job route. So it's not just you that is in this ever rowing boat. Honestly what brought me here the first time was I just learned bout the 52 week $$ challenge (let me tell you it worked for Xmas wasn't a credit card bomb) I read all the posts & honestly I still know NOTHING about personal finances. The only reason I was able to start investing was because I didn't spend the money that was left from that challenge, I used it to invest. Now I swear by that challenge for it is my only saving Grace for Xmas time. I don't have a HUGE portfolio, infact I consider myself lucky that it motivated me enough to start saving something that won't lead me into the usual Xmas time credit card fiasco. So pls pls pls don't ever feel like everyone on here is Rich & living the dream"

PersonalFinanceCanada,fedgged,t1_fckrmlo,1579010862.0,"Sorry if I sound rude, investing in real estate is a great opportunity that I agree with if you have the funds/knowledge/time to deal with up keep & having the resources to deal with being the landlord. I see so many posts on it. But I am no guru at this nor do I want the hassle of dealing with Tennant's at 3 am who are calling me to say HEY there is a problem with the property. I have seen both sides of the coin (family have done this and I have seen the grey hairs arise from it) I am not trying to sound negative & I am apologizing now if it sounds that way, Again it's having the resources to meet the demands of doing this to which I have seen as well which can be profitable, but you really need to be prepared for that adventure."

PersonalFinanceCanada,fdwqjte,t1_fdwnsur,1578761382.0,Oh trust me u don't it's just I want to research the heck out of it 💐
PersonalFinanceCanada,fdwniq1,t1_fdwkx4c,1578760512.0,Ty so I see u did some research as well 😃 but where did u find all of it? I am so on fence edge to find more information so I can make it worth while
PersonalFinanceCanada,fdwlogz,t1_fdwjh4c,1578759950.0,Lol I only want to invest in Canadian companies I know sounds silly especially since I live here & would rather keep my economy going since I have kids that will need to survive here. I know the dividend is attractive but to me there has to be that 'aha' moment to make it happen. I have made the first wtf I got about health care for so many reasons to state which drove my advisor nuts for I made it a HUGE issue (6 hours of talking & stating my reasons) to which I think hopefully one day will be valid enough to say I knew something 5 years ago. Lol yeah I have an issue with knowing & working in the field to make it my reason enough lol...not a doctor...not a pharmacist...no big fancy title but I have so many reasons for it.
PersonalFinanceCanada,fdwgndl,t1_fdwcjtu,1578758454.0,Yeah I have an advisor he recommended QSR (tummies Burger King stock) but price scared the poop out of me 100 something a share!! And tbh I don't know much about it. So 6 months ago I started to research Enbridge...which leads me to asking on here where else to look for information on it. But I am seeing that maybe I should just wait it out & not jump into this yet! I trust the advisor but again it's not something I can just say OK to without feeling like I know EVERYTHING I can. Ugh this is all due to my insecurity of knowledge is power & honestly I am going with that 6 months of learning means nothing when it comes to this. I am going to continue my hunt with Enbridge and maybe next year I won't need to ask ppls opinions for I can trust my gut & go ahead with a stock purchase

PersonalFinanceCanada,fdw84w4,t1_fdvtp4l,1578756030.0,Ok I get what ur saying & ty. This is why I wanted to research the heck out of it. I want to say hey I learned more about the company & honestly I learned that it wasn't for me to say purchase 10 shares of it (example numbers) 💐
PersonalFinanceCanada,fdw79fu,t1_fdtpqkz,1578755825.0,"I do have ETFs, I have two REITs...I have two mutual funds. That's why I am looking now to do a stock purchase. I know alot of ppl will say it's crazy but I figure that it's time to jump into 'the old stock market' I know ETFs & REITs are considered stocks in some crazy world. But I figure if I can just research the heck out of something than if I do choose to invest in it I would know the reasons to make it a worthwhile stock pick."
