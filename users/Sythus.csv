Granted, this wasn't one of those free online dating sites, I forget which one it was, but I guess a small price tag will thin out the herd of who is legitimately trying to find a relationship and not just seek validation.

IMO, LDR/ online dating is great because you don't have that sexual element to get in the way of trying to know somebody. Maybe things have changed though."
