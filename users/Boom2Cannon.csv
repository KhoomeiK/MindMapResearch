I’m not even like a die-hard Kobe fan or anything, but go tell that man that his defense doesn’t matter. Or Jordan. Or wade. Or any other number of actually elite SGs. 

Yeah, rim protection matters, but it sure as shit doesn’t matter if the shooting guard keeps his man in front of him and doesn’t let him get to the rim; something that Harden is literally incapable of. 

His technique is embarrassing. He literally opens up defensively and allows the middle of the floor to the players he defends. He doesn’t slide his feet worth a shit. 

There’s a reason that he can’t, and never will be able to, get his team to a championship, let alone win one.

NBA2k,fep5t0z,t1_fep49h2,1579312776.0,"You literally are way too young to know what you’re talking about. It shows. 

He can average 50/15/15 and it won’t mean shit. He will never win a ring. Never. 

He’s MAYBE an average defender. TMac and Drexler were elite offensively AND defensively in their prime. They also didn’t need to flop like little pansies to get to the line. They also didn’t have the insane turnover numbers harden has. It’s disgraceful to the position. 

And if you want to talk stats, we certainly can. We can even look at advanced metrics.  Harden doesn’t stack up. He never will not only is he not the best SG in Rockets history, but he’s also not even the best shooting guard in the league right now. 

Again, if you think that an all-time great player can only be great offensively, you don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about. He’s great at only 50% of the game. The other 50% is laughable. He’s lazy as fuck and has never actually impacted a game defensively. 

Yes, Tmac never had any playoff run, but nor has Harden. Spoiler alert: harden won’t this year either. However, Tmac became an all-time great in basically 6-7 seasons (injuries). 

Go watch some videos of Drexler. That’s how basketball is played. No pansy double-step back, pump fake, flop shit. His game literally had no weakness. 50% of Hardens game is a weakness; defense."
NBA2k,fep3u50,t1_fep2fho,1579311524.0,"You clearly are not old enough to have ever watched Drexler. And any person that uses stats to justify Harden is a damn joke. 

Mcgrady’s best four years were undoubtedly better than Hardens best four. Harden is a one-way player that is embarrassing to watch. How he has exploited the ridiculous new-age NBA rules isn’t skillful. He would have gotten stomped in yesteryears NBA - he’s soft. Regardless of the past, he still can’t play defense worth a damn. He could be the best offensive player ever (he’s not), but that doesn’t mean jack shit if he gets scored on at-will. 

People that legitimately don’t understand basketball or what it takes to win are the ones that base a players talent level off of offense and flashy plays. 

Harden will never win a ring. Ever. 100% guaranteed. He’s a defensive liability. He puts up gaudy offensive numbers in the regular season, yet he routinely gets shut-down in the playoffs; when players actually D up. He’s nothing more than a volume shooter."

You sell shit to maximize profit. That’s called business. It’s that way in nearly every industry, and it should be. If you sell something at a price that is higher than what people will pay, you fail. If you sell it under what people will pay, you have a much higher chance of failing. 

Let’s assume that a pencil costs $1 to produce. If I sell that pencil, and even thousands of others for $1.10, I’ll likely lose money after you factor in overhead. If I now offer that pencil for $100, I’ll likely lose money. Sure, maybe some dumbass will think the pencil will improve your handwriting and buy it, but the majority of the market will not.

So much for those who were saying no one is offended. It’s always just a matter of time. 

Sounds like you have more hatred and vitriol than anyone else...at no point did I say I hated trannies. You just can’t take the fact that a person can’t magically just change their biological sex."
funny,fct18eh,t1_fct00w3,1577930248.0,You are straight retarded. Lmao. Good luck to ya
funny,fct161e,t1_fct040n,1577930199.0,"No, it literally SCIENTIFICALLY AND BIOLOGICALLY is not proven wrong. Are you retarded?"
funny,fcsyx9n,t1_fcsysnk,1577928597.0,"They actually literally cannot, barring a very, very tiny scientific/biological exception. 

Begone!"
funny,fcsynr4,t1_fcsylry,1577928411.0,If it looks like a man and has a penis.
funny,fcsy9jr,t1_fcsxybp,1577928133.0,"Woah, how do you think I’m transphobic?"
funny,fcsy4cv,t1_fcsxclr,1577928031.0,"Actually, that’s biologically impossible (excluding very very few circumstances) for a female to have a cock. 

I never called a person disagreeing with me trans. 

You making stuff up again?"
funny,fcsxxeo,t1_fcsx2hb,1577927895.0,"Lol making up. 

There’s plenty of examples. Plenty. 

ITS MA’AM!"
funny,fcsxtwh,t1_fcsxh1v,1577927825.0,"You are verifiably wrong.  Might want to take a look across the world at “hate speech”. 

Seriously, you people are the goddamn worst."
funny,fcswqws,t1_fcswk4b,1577927060.0,"Well you can’t just assume that. 

And the people downvoting me are definitely offended."
funny,fcswisz,t1_fcsw43w,1577926899.0,A chick with a dick. That would be a female that has a penis. Also known as a tranny. A fake woman. A mentally ill male.
funny,fcswg14,t1_fcsw78y,1577926844.0,"No, it’s great!  See, the US is one of the few, if only, countries that actually allows for free speech. 

A massive reason your bud Trump won was because America is not on board with PC culture. 

We get it, everyone on the left is offended about everything. That doesn’t mean I can’t be too!"
funny,fcsw9dj,t1_fcsw2pv,1577926710.0,"It’s not a joke. It’s a serious question that is frequently asked. In fact, there are laws throughout the world that could fine or jail a person for not knowing!"
funny,fcsvenk,t1_fcsv2kp,1577926091.0,"No, I’m not offended at all.  Not one bit!  I’d appreciate you not assuming that I was. 

Are you offended?  It sure seems like it since you’re mad and commenting. You a chick with a dick?"
