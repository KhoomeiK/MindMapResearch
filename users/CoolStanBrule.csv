memes,ffbefvy,t3_eskqx4,1579761777.0,"I‚Äôve lived on Jersey Shore, my entire life and was in the thick of it when Hurricane Sandy hit back in 2012. A lot of the homes in my community were destroyed. My best friends neighbor lost his house entirely. A lot of us locals grouped together to help rebuilt their house and repair the houses nearby, gutting basement removing fallen trees from living rooms etc. This was truly uplifting, but perhaps the thing that inspired me the most was the day I saw a bus load of Amish men arrive to help. They lived nearly 3 hours away and their community was fortunate enough to survived the storm unscathed. Because these kind people went completely out of there way to help others, the frame of my friend‚Äôs neighbors house was rebuilt in 2 Days!"

AskReddit,ff2wti7,t1_ff2cek8,1579527099.0,"I used to work as an LO for a fairly small mortgage company. I dealt with people like that as well, usually people with multiple properties. During the summer of 2016 when rates were at a historic low my company was offering free rate reductions with no change in term and no closing costs or fees of any kind as part of business retention. This one guy I spoke to, who was already a client of ours,had close to a 6% interest rate 5.875 if I remember correctly. I was offering to lower him down to a 3.875 APR saving him around $200 a month and Tens of Thousands over the life of his loan. When I explained this, he replied ‚ÄúI work for Meryl Lynch and have over One Million dollars in savings and own four properties.

AskReddit,ff2vq7c,t3_er3a4t,1579525992.0,"I‚Äôm a caddie and used to work outside ops (valet parking, retrieving golf bags for members, and maintaining golf carts) at a wealthy country club in NJ. One day the 14-15yo son of an extremely wealth member comes in and asks for a golf cart. My co-worker apologizes and very politely explains it‚Äôs the law in NJ and course policy that you have to be 16 to rent a golf cart. The kid replies ‚Äúthat‚Äôs bullshit‚Äù and leaves. 20 min later I hear a monster engine growling and see a bright yellow Ferrari flying up the driveway. The Ferrari comes to screeching halt, and the kid gets out, tosses the keys to my co-worker and says ‚Äúpark it.‚Äù I laughed out of shock. My co-worker just shook his head. It‚Äôs also worth noting, the kid never stopped or even slowed down at the mini intersection where the golf carts cross the driveway to get to the driving range. There‚Äôs a huge blind spot there and he easily would have killed someone, had they been crossing. 

Also the kids father, who is the member, insists on having his ball teed for him on every hole. In all my years of caddying, I‚Äôve never heard of this. He always is so intoxicated that he can‚Äôt do it himself. He then proceeds to drive home in one of his many exotic sports cars."
