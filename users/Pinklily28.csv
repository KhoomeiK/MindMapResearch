Personally, I would show the texts to his friend.  He should know what’s going on. 
Tell your SO that you know what he’s doing and tell him you’re done, if you are.

deadbedroom,ff6xqu0,t3_erxp0o,1579637059.0,"First off this can go either way HLM or HLF-   I’m writing it through a woman’s eyes to save time.
The mood hits women slower than men.  Some of us like a build up.  When we’ve had enough, everyone is different, that’s enough.  When a guy is coming at us every day, twice a day or more, some women just feel like any woman would do. Its not about the woman, it’s her vagina.  It’s not personal anymore, it’s a chore.   We can’t get into it because it’s overdone.  The moody pouts because we didn’t “like it” or weren’t involved enough is because our minds have drifted off and we’re waiting until he’s done.  If you are HL or LL be truthful with your partner from the beginning.  Nothing’s worse than not being compatible in the bedroom."

If that’s the worse thing your mom does I would be pretty thankful.  A good MIL that doesn’t give you grief, is friendly and helpful is worth her weight in gold.  
As long as your mom is as nice as you say she is she’ll cooperate.  Your gf has to loosen up a little and understand your mom has been coming over regularly.  Hopefully this works out."

I have an EMS, pharmacy tech and phlebotomy background so I know about injuries, meds and infections.  No one , no matter who they are, should kiss, nibble on or put their mouth on baby’s face, head or hands.  This year’s flu is wild. Our area hospitals are full and 2 deaths in our area were due to the flu.  
Older generations don’t understand the no kissing rule because it wasn’t stressed as much as it is now.  My mom kept us out of crowds for the first 3 months because we were born at the start of flu season.  She listen to our Dr like he was speaking the Gospel.  It seems like OP’s MIL thinks none of the warnings apply to her because she’s related to the baby. It’s not about HER, it’s germs and the baby’s lack of immunity. 
Show her some utube videos and let her see how sick newborns can get. Then ask how she would feel if she was to blame for getting baby sick like that.
Good luck with her."

It’s not fair that your home is upside down, that you’re working 12 hour shifts and can’t unwind the way you want, but you are crossing the line.

Any time you give this other woman outside of job, actively working, all the hours at the gym, sharing lunches.... if you haven’t shared everything with your wife ... you’re hiding it.  That’s cheating.  Your wife doesn’t deserve that.    
Have you listened to what your wife says? Is she a SAHM? Is your son home all day? Does your wife get any down time?  It sounds like she’s frustrated with your absence and her having to do pretty much everything at home.    You both could probably use some counseling and some time together so you can reconnect.  Is she living like a single mom? I’d be frustrated with that arrangement.
