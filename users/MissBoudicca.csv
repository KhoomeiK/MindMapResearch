cats,ff9o1ye,t1_ff9jn6r,1579717021.0,"Cardiomyopathy in Maine coons is usually caused by an inherited genetic mutation that affects the ability of the heart muscle to contract properly. It is unlikely for a half Maine coon to develop the disease, as having the mutation does not always cause the disease to occur. (another reason genetic testing doesn’t always help)

Pure bred Maine coons that are homozygous for the mutation (got a bad copy of the gene from both parents) are much more likely to develop this disorder before the age of 7. 

Adopting a Maine coon mix from a local shelter or rescue group would be an excellent way to get that wonderful Maine coon personality and beauty without running as much of a risk of the kitty developing this issue ❤️"

MakeupLounge,fei1nyq,t1_fef4pe4,1579128334.0,Also a cool and easy tip for figuring out where your natural crease lies is to use a dot of concealer on your eye then look up and down a few times. Where the concealer lands is where you define your crease
MakeupLounge,fei1kz0,t3_eoubra,1579128282.0,"You’re doing great!! Starting out simple with focus on some really meticulous blending is the perfect way to learn :)

Edit: do you put concealer on your lids before applying eyeshadow? Because it really helps to make the color pop and stay in one place."
