Oh, now I have to choose between dessert or a soup. Well I def still am a dessert person, always will be! I'll have key lime pie please!

You: nowp, can't do that.

In a two party system, like the US has, it's easy to pick a side, and whatever comes out of it, it's probably still in the range if your ideology, because the other side is the complete opposite. Your politics has been brought down to blzck and white. The only nuance is within the party it seems.

If you were talking about a parlaimentary system, like a lit of countries over here in Europe have, then things are different. But we're not.

In the US it seems to be roughly what I believe vs not at all what I belief. R and D like to take as opposing views as possible.
Then in the primaries you try to get as close to your ideology as possible. If you don't get your exact candidate, tough luck, but it will probably always be closer to your views than the opposite party.

So no. Do vote in the primary, even if you'll support your side, regardless of outcome.

But actually, do question your side as well. Specially when they do shit you don't condone. Not that hard. 

How do you Americans say it.. ""country over party""? Make sure you don't turn those around though.

Passief koelen heeft dit niet. Bijkomend voordeel is dat dit warmte uit je huis onttrekt en terug in je grond steekt, waardoor je je buffer warmte in de winter terug aanvult. Hoeveel dit is en hoe goed dit werkt hangt natuurlijk af van het soort ondergrond en je grondwaterstand 

Passief koelen kun je ook enkel maar met grondgebonden warmtepompen. Lucht/lucht en lucht/water kunnen dit niet.
