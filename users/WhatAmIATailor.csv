This guy owns a solar farm where a transformer fell off a power pole and caught fire. 

The local brigade shared a few photos of the aftermath causing CB to launch into a rant about their actions while extinguishing the fire.

The actual transformer was owned by the distributor so he’s not at fault. Leaving the review is a too much though.

I agree the number was pretty pointless. Politics for sure. That said there are so many jobs out there that need doing. It could have been 4000 and they still would have found tasks that need doing.

All hands on deck has worked out fairly well. I know some people didn’t head straight out into the field the day they showed up but Army is a huge beast. Reservists were organised and on the ground before the online brigade had its ready combat team deployed. That’s a huge achievement.

I can guarantee the vast majority called up won’t be sitting on a base watching Netflix. Infantry and Artillery are doing general duties from unloading stores to fire proofing heritage sites. Engineers are clearing routes. Cav are transporting any and everybody. Combat Service Support are keeping everyone fed, supplied and operational. There’s specialist doctors, nurses and vets.
