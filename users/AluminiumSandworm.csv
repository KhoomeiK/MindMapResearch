bezos' control over the company is part of what makes it worth so much, and selling it would destroy it.  he'd still be fantastically wealthy, doubtless top 100 or even 20 or 10, but that doesn't change the fact that the majority of his wealth is tied to an existing infrastructure, brand name, massive set of buildings of servers, ip, warehouses full of shit, employee contracts, and whatever the fuck else companies are made out of.

this control over amazon's resources gives him more power and influence on a global scale, and soon more than global, than any amount of liquid cash could.

when people say ""his wealth is in stock"" they should take that more as ""he's the head of something equivalent to an influential nation"" rather than ""he has less money than you think because it's tied up in stock"""

Worked hard? Come on in! Did you work just a bit more than usual? Come on in!

I got fucking regents, they bought me the fuck out, but fuck this I should have gone to USC or UCLA and just take the L on the debt. All the sacrifices I made for prestige and money: working extremely hard for 1530 SAT, giving up social life, giving up a dream school atmosphere and experience all for fucking nothing, all absolutely out the fucking window. When anyone can get in like this what's the point in working so hard to pull yourself out of the herd? Any fucking dumbass can make it in here. I am fucking done with this place.

I'm going to be obsessed just to get post-graduate work so I can erase this embarrassment from my life.
