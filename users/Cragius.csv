*Heri Domenicus filius Antonii Giulianotti et Domenice eius uxoris inventus fuit a dictis patre et matre soffocatus in flumine...*

So, the boy 'was found drowned by said father and mother'.

Now, of course, this is ambiguous -- was he found by them or drowned by them?

I would lean towards the former, partly because it is perfectly obvious how one can say *who he was found by*, but not so obvious how you could say *who he was found drowned by*, and partly because accidents are more common than murders, in this case the murder of a son by *both* his parents. The argument is harder to make from the Latin, in particular because this is not exactly an elegantly constructed sentence.

The rest of the passage is just stating that his little body was brought to the parish church for the funeral rites."

In all capitals, some would put a 'V' in place of any 'U', mimicking the ancient capitals, but Latin is generally written using the same conventions (such as punctuation, putting spaces between words, and so on) as other modern European languages, so it's not at all necessary to use the conventions of Cicero's day."

As a general principle, I think it best to use what classical words exist and know their strict significations, and only to supplement them where there is a need, since it is the classical standard to which Latin tends ever to revert, but then I gather that your purpose with the language is a little different to most people's.

We really shouldn't attempt to say things like 'in the first place' literally in Latin.

You do find the odd error in the Latin, though not too many, and I found that sometimes the app would offer me four incorrect multiple choice options, which seemed both unfair and confusing (this happens in the French and Italian courses too). You also run into patches where it seems like every sentence is missing the exact same word or even form of a word, like several in a row needing you to supply *mensam* after *supra* or *mensa* after *sub* or an *e* or *ex* in a sentence with *oriundus*, and this can be a little tedious when it's something you know well already.

A lot of the sentences are contemporary and conversational, and there is some Christian Latin mixed in there, so it is one of a small minority of Latin courses that treats the language as something other than strictly ancient.

We are probably being a little generous in calling this a 'course', since it will not teach you much by itself, but I think it is a nice thing to do in addition to other Latin study.

Certain things just 'click' with some people, so it's worth trying just to see if it happens to work for you and get you doing that little bit of extra study every day. I would say the same for Duolingo, or for a flashcard application or site like Anki or Quizlet.

However you think of it, this verb just is *not* found with acc. + inf. among the classical authors. I think that's the example we should follow.

It's hard for us as English speakers, because we learn that this verb means 'to think' and so we suppose that it is therefore basically synonymous with *putare* and operates with the same syntax.

Based on the numbers provided, the box for the Australian fires should be about 4-5 times larger than the one for the Amazon fires, yet it looks instead to be about 30 times larger. The scale between the boxes for the Amazon fires and the Mendocino one is at least as inaccurate, if not more so.

And of course the boxes are the element of the image that first draws our eye, and which will more readily stay in our mind than the actual figures provided.

Of all issues, it is hard to think of a single one less in need of being sensationalised and exaggerated than these fires, given how huge they are and how terrifying and destructive. Even the baldest, driest description of the fires is chilling, as is every photograph however amateurishly taken. We don't need lies or bullshit."

I do certainly not think it is accurate to say that the effect of European settlement has been to move the environment back to its pristine state, but rather to massively accelerate its destruction and exploitation. In fact, this is so obvious a point that I don't think you can quite have meant to suggest otherwise. Perhaps you could explain what you meant by saying that 'the habitat has gone back to its previous ways'."

But this is pronounced like the English *-sh-* only before a vowel like *-e-*,  *-i-*,  *-ae-*, or  *-oe-*, is it not? So the cluster *-shl-* still lies outside of the phonotactic bounds of Italianate Latin.

The closest approximation is just *-s-*, I should think. This is how the *-sh-* is generally handled in names such as 'Washington', 'Chicago', and 'Bangladesh' -- respectively *Vasintonia*, *Sicagum*, *Bangladesa*."

latin,fclhp1y,t3_ehtfrz,1577748044.0,"I find it strange too.

If Latin had only been the language of the ancient Romans, I would expect it to be taught only in universities to the very small number of people who wished to specialise in classical history, much as Middle Egyptian and Sumerian are taught to a tiny select few who hope to make their living as experts on the ancient levant.

The reason why Latin was a staple of a western education, and why it is still somewhat widely taught in schools, is not that Caesar spoke it, but that it became Europe's common cultural and literary language and kept that special position for a thousand years. Even after the appearance of works in the vulgar tongues, for a long time anyone who hoped that what they wrote would be read in other nations and in other centuries would write it in Latin. Although (or arguably *because*) the language ossified, it enjoys a continuous and lively tradition that most other 'dead' languages do not. This is what tempts some to call this language not dead but perennial, and this, even if you are one who would argue that many of its finest works are classical, is the real reason why it is worthy of our study."
latin,fcleql3,t1_fckagfw,1577746092.0,"There are lots of times when the use of the dative case does not align well with those English words:

*tibi credo*, 'I trust you'  
*tibi creditur*, 'you are trusted'  
*tibi pecuniam aufero*, 'I steal money from you'  
*tibi faciendum est*, 'it has to be done by you'

More relevant to the case at hand, there is a tendency for verbs with a prefix to get a dative:

*tibi onus impono*, 'I put the burden on you'  
*tibi eum praeficio*, 'I put him ahead of you'

Notice that the basic verb still takes an accusative (*onus pono*, 'I put the burden'; *eum facio*, 'I make him'), while the sense of the prefix seems to be directed at the word in the dative case (*im- tibi* 'on you', *prae- tibi* 'before you').

This is what is going on with *circumdare*: the *dare* part takes an accusative object for the thing that you are 'giving' (i.e., 'providing', 'putting', 'placing'), but the prefix *circum* impinges on the word in the dative case:

*tibi libros imponis*, 'you place books on yourself'  
*tibi libros praefers*, 'you carry books before you'  
*tibi libros circumdas*, 'you put books around yourself'"
latin,fcijon6,t3_ehdj1h,1577663679.0,"*Circumdare* can work two ways:

1. The way that feels right in English: you surround something (acc.) with another thing (abl.)

2. The way that makes sense given that this verb is a compound of *dare*: you put something (acc.) around another thing (dat.)

If a general positions his soldiers around the enemy camp, we can say either: *ipse pedites castris hostium circumdat* or *ipse castra hostium peditibus circumdat*.

The meaning of these two is the same, as far as I can see. This can be a bit of a problem, since often, as in that example, the dative and ablative of a word look and sound alike. Common sense and context should always sort out what is surrounding what."

*poetas omnino quasi alia quadam lingua locutos non conor attingere*, 'I don't make any attempt at all to deal with the poets, who seem to be speaking some different language'

This is the value of consulting a proper dictionary like Oxford's or Lewis and Short's: it should give you a good view not just of the word's range of meaning, but also its range of use.

*Latine*, I should say, is by far the more common expression -- in fact, there is no example that I can find of *linguā latinā* being used this way with *loqui*. Similarly, 'in Greek' is *graece*, 'in Carthaginian' is *punice*, and so on. The ablative can be used where no such adverb exists or would suffice, as with *alia lingua* or *nostra lingua* or whatever."
