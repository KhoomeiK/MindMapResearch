Dungeon running is perfect information, you’re not competing against another agent, it’s honestly way easier and doesn’t require any sort of machine learning. A simple handcrafted rule set would suffice.

Infant mortality is one of the *least* standard ways to measure healthcare.

It’s basically the “wage gap” of healthcare. An erroneously cited metric that captures far more complexity than just the underlying healthcare system. We’re talking socioeconomic status, demographics, age of the mother, differences in recording practices by locality, etc. there are far too many variables to enumerate. 

Teen pregnancy rates in the US are multiples of other countries, and births even more so due to problematic abortion laws. Teens happen to have increased neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates. I haven’t even mentioned the ridiculous obesity rates and substance abuse.
