WhitePeopleTwitter,fdeld6t,t1_fde5o2n,1578341476.0,I read what you wrote. You basically advocate inherited wealth being fine because some poor people become florists. I gave concrete examples of how the tax structure is broken and you call it nit-picking. Lol
WhitePeopleTwitter,fddpgqr,t1_fddnz0z,1578320418.0,"I am because you seem to think the reason people are poor is making the choice to be something akin to a florist. In the current tax structure you can donate 11M to each of your children tax free, which can be withdrawn from at a tax rate of 15% which amounts to approximately $380K/yr with a 5%ish risk of ruin until they themselves die and pass it to their kids again tax free. Our current tax structure is very broken when working class people are paying 30%+ after state FICA and federal taxes"
