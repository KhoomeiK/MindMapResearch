Needafriend,ffcsm74,t1_ffcrqbc,1579806422.0,I guess we'll see if you really care or if you just want to feel good about helping someone in need. I don't really have anything to lose any more so I'll give it a shot.
Needafriend,ffcrltw,t1_ffcr6eo,1579805822.0,There are no guarantees. We'll just see where we are a year later. That's all I can do.

AskReddit,ffbfp2e,t1_ffbfipp,1579763259.0,Not a real Spartan I did it on easy.
Needafriend,ffbdtqy,t1_ffbd065,1579761084.0,Too late for that help bot. Maybe you can help someone else though.

AskReddit,ffbb6dm,t3_esmzbi,1579758209.0,Very few people would use it. I wouldn't be here if I had to hookup a credit card.
AskReddit,ffbb3us,t3_esmm4h,1579758136.0,I kept everyone okay in metro exodus. Seeing them all jump down to save me after the radiation really got to me. I've never had anyone do anything like that for me. People won't even inconvenience themselves for me let alone do anything that serious.
AskReddit,ffb92vn,t1_ff2parp,1579755662.0,No the time for improving is over.I've tried so hard for so many years. The ONLY way I'm not gonna do it is if somehow someway my old friend group takes me back.

AskReddit,ff8ft7m,t3_es77ls,1579676594.0,Claws like the nergigante dual blades in monster Hunter. Also probably red.

relationship_advice,ff7i6a4,t1_ff7hxvi,1579650117.0,"Yeah if both people are like that then whatever. But unfortunately its usually like this instead. Yeah they should he should find someone who actually likes him. Not someone that has to be ""talking"" to someone else like that."
relationship_advice,ff7hs4q,t1_ff7guxl,1579649856.0,I think doing things like that teach people that others are disposable. Like if you don't like someone forget em! Go on tinder find someone else.
relationship_advice,ff7g7xj,t1_ff7d2ov,1579648826.0,Yeah not only is it easier to just go on your phone and find someone who's dtf on like 2 seconds but it seems like no one has any self respect any more. Everyone gives themselves away like they're worthless and just takes whatever comes there way. Like the my wife's boyfriend isn't just a joke any more its really real. That has to be the saddest thing about modern times the lack of true love.
relationship_advice,ff7cwnt,t1_ff798zv,1579646636.0,">On the other hand you guys weren’t “officially official.” 

This argument is so stupid. If you're talking to someone with the intention of dating or becoming more then friends you shouldn't be talking to others too. I think he should move on and find someone that isn't wasting his time."

SuicideWatch,ff4pg2d,t1_ff4ommu,1579569280.0,I really don't think anyone would match with me. Maybe bots or women who are selling themselves. But I want a real connection not a robot or someone like that. I'm not looking for hookups.

AskReddit,ff3umxp,t1_ff3udjh,1579549215.0,"It won't. Anything good that comes turns into something horrible as a trade off. The last time I met a friend I had to move away into a horrible place and then she forgot about me. Its always like that. I don't get anything good without paying a worse price later. Yeah I guess, I'm just gone spend the rest of my money on games and good places to eat in the meantime."

AskReddit,ff2f54b,t1_ff2epsb,1579503537.0,"I've been through meds, working out, moving away and coming back, my therapist won't see me any more. Everyone I let into my life is gone with better people. I have no one and nothing. Maybe the next one like me that they meet will have it better because of what I'm gonna do. I will not accept it can get better any more. All my works made it worse. Everyone I used to know are now all with other people. I'm a broken toy no one needs any more. I see myself how everyone else does. I've lived my whole life trying to find acceptance. Even when I gave it to myself first it made no difference and that wore me back down again. I was still used and discarded. What you say is worth nothing to me. My whole life has been leading up to it. Why else would I always end up like this."

wholesomememes,ff2ceug,t1_ff2bneu,1579500593.0,Its nice what you're trying to do but it doesn't change that fact that nobody stays with me. I could never leave my house again and no one would ever check on me. I'm routinely ignored and just abandoned by everyone I know. They all have others they like to be with more. I'm lucky they serve me at restaurants. I don't think they would if they didn't have to.
wholesomememes,ff1sgca,t3_er4lkh,1579485166.0,Lol everyone I've ever tried to have a friendship with would disagree with you.

AskReddit,ff17aq6,t1_ff16y0b,1579475975.0,Of course. Years of therapy. Different horrible medications. Being more active. Change of scenery. All of it left me the same. Not even my therapist will see me any more.

We're broken and we're not gonna be fixed but we can't live like this. Everybody that pushed me to this will treat the next person like me better at least.the only way I think I'll be treated better is I fail and I could because I did everything else.all I can hope for now is to be an example.
AskReddit,ff13blh,t1_ff12pno,1579474765.0,No I should've though. Maybe if I ever see them again I might. People don't really talk to me though. I guess I'm a creep.
depression,ff12rq5,t3_er3qsy,1579474667.0,They're not your friends or they wouldn't just be okay with you not being invited. I would never be okay with that happening to somebody I knew.
depression,ff12jfz,t3_er3ry2,1579474598.0,It feels kinda nice to give up though. I know I'm gonna kill myself someday. Before next year. So what do I have to worry about now.
depression,ff12cvk,t3_er3t4l,1579474534.0,Yeah you feel guilty for talking about it but the only way people talk to you and take you seriously is when you say stuff like I'm going to kill myself soon or I've been cutting myself. You don't matter unless you want to stop existing than your life has meaning apparently.
depression,ff00y51,t3_er15cg,1579464016.0,"Isn't it terrible the only way we can get any attention or be noticed is to hurt ourselves. We're little gears as long as we ""function""its alright but if we stop then its their problem too and they ""care"""

Normal does exist I want to experience life but I'm wasting away instead because of all the problems I have. I want people I can count on and depend on.

AskReddit,feus5up,t1_feupseu,1579389397.0,Personally I wouldn't want to be friends with someone after being rejected. I wouldn't be able to just stop how I feel.it would only make it worse having them around.

AskReddit,fetnxja,t1_feti4zr,1579377397.0,Yeah true. If they're narcissistic it wouldn't help to try and show them otherwise. But when their low you could help them then.
AskReddit,fetntel,t1_fetjkd6,1579377350.0,Yeah they have to change themselves but you can show them what's wrong. Although I think some of them just really do have terrible luck/taste in women.
AskReddit,fetnnhm,t1_fetmp6b,1579377284.0,What's the difference?
AskReddit,fetnlf7,t1_fetk0vc,1579377261.0,Yeah I guess wanting to be nice or trying to be nice aren't really things. You are nice or you aren't.
AskReddit,fetha4m,t1_fetgxix,1579375462.0,I think most people have those things. Maybe they're so focused being nice they can't do anything else?
AskReddit,fetg5c9,t1_fetfw0b,1579375140.0,You can help though. Alcoholics and drug users have interventions don't they? These people can be helped.
