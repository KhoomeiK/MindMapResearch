dankmemes,felqazn,t1_feknlc4,1579228338.0,"Nice opinion. Just one tiny problem with it. Inspecting
your post, it looks like your opinion is different from
mine.

Boy, let me tell you something.

I am the baseline for opinions, any opinion I hold is
objectively correct and, as a result, any other opinions
are wrong. And guess what? You happen to hold a wrong
one. And I hope you know that your opinion is now
illegal. I have now contacted the FBI, the CIA, the NSA,
the Navy SEALs, the Secret Service and your mom. You'll
rot in prison for the rest of your life over this, mark my
words you'll be sorry you ever shared your opinions. By
the time you're reading this, you're done for boy. Nature
will punish you. Humanity will punish you. Supernatural
beings will punish you. Space will punish you. Oh yeah,
and we decided that just to make sure we'll nuke your
house from orbit so there's no chance you can run away
and everyone you know will die. It's a small price to pay
for ethnic cleansing. May this post be a warning for
anyone else brave enough to share an incorrect opinion;
you've been warned."
