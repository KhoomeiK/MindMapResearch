Look at vampires. Ageless, immune to disease and resistant to trauma, but not really invulnerable. If they ever decide they wanna end it they can just catch one last sunrise.

Why do you think there are no major bunkers or defensive positions that are open to the public? As compared to, say, Sweden. Or Japan. The president and chiefs of staff are priority number 1 in the event of a nuclear strike. Intelligence agencies have their own bunkers for their leadership. The rest of us better learn to love our new tumors.

For those about to ask:

[Raven Rick, the so-called “underground Pentagon”](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven_Rock_Mountain_Complex) 

[Project Greek Island, officially decommissioned but intended to house Congree](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Greek_Island) 

[Mount Weather, officially the command center for FEMA but also a permanent substitute for the Executive Branch in the event of devastation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Weather_Emergency_Operations_Center)

And we all know about [Cheyenne Mountain, intended as a bunker and command post specifically for military leadership, which includes the President](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_Mountain_Complex)

There isn’t a single structure on the scale of these bunkers for civilian use that isn’t privately owned. Not a single tax dollar spent to defend the ordinary rank and file of the country. Just the military and the politicians. The rest of us will be treated as hostile forces if we attempt to approach these sites during an emergency situation that warrants their use.

worldpolitics,fdrbvbi,t1_f6zxj9a,1578682279.0,"“The British tried to cull Irish people because they were Irish”

Yes. Irish. Not because they were white. You literally ended your own argument. White people declaring war on other white people is not white genocide. By that logic the 100 Years War, War of the Roses and the US Civil War were also white genocide. And the Sino-Japanese war was an Asian genocide. By that logic literally every war in history, no matter what reason, was a form of genocide.

What your inaccurately describing was an Irish genocide. Don’t conflate the two. The majority of whites didn’t consider the Irish to be on their level until it was convenient.

Racism against whites is real in certain places. Some on the left will say you cant be racist against white peole but those are the same people who say using chopsticks is cultural appropriation. Those people are doing the same thing as you: stretching and mutating the truth to serve their own agenda. In their case its some sort of misguided benevolence brought in by white guilt. In yours its a feeble and easily factchecked attempt to convince the world that the the people who make the rules across half the planet and who dominated and/or colonized somewhere around 80% of it are an endangered species.

But all else aside, genocide is an action, not a state of being. Have there BEEN white genocides in the past? Now THAT is worth discussion. But there is none currently. As for your heritage, you can cry about what other white people did or you can look around and realize that the people responsible were the people who made the rules. The same kind of people make the rules now. And who makes the rules in Britain right now? I’ll give you a hint: it rhymes with, but is the opposite of, meritocracy."

mildlyinteresting,fd76z3z,t1_fd75yxo,1578200241.0,"Ive worked placed like that. A restaurant i did lrep for gave me permission to take home the fat and scraps i cut off the beef (I was making my own stock and rendering the fat) and one day threatened to fire me for theft. They also wanted to schedule me for an 8 hour shift but finish and leave in 4. Not the last to do that either, which is why I refuse to work food service now. A bit depressing, too, cuz I used to want to open a restaurant of my own. But that dream is dead now."

If it walks like a duck, acts like a duck, has a swasticka in its room and marches in the streets with a tiki torch shouting seig heil, its a nazi. And a duck.

Fun fact, prior to WWII the term was a shortened form of the original Nationalsozialist used in souther Germany to refer to a clumsy, awkward of foolish person. The actual Nazis were understandably not fond of the label. All the more reason to keep using it."

I DO know some Hasidics. And the ones I know are the most tight assed people I have ever met. Even the other Jews I know call them Yiddishe Kup. So either you’re responding to the wrong person or you’re just playing SJW and assuming any Shagetz with something to say about any Jew is an antisemite. If its the former I’m gonna go ahead an apologize for going off, but otherwise you need to check your faux outrage and find some productive way to channel that pissy attitude other than acting like a shmendrik to strangers on the damn internet."

Political_Revolution,fd1ovpb,t1_fd0h1kw,1578134487.0,"Its not that he did or is, its that he promised to. He used that, among other things, to galvanize a base in support of this “outside actor.” The voters felt burned by the politicians and the other candidates at the time were weak. Now the entire Republican institution has spent the last 3 years pushing the narrative that Trump is everything short of a king, that hes the best thing that could ever happen to the country and that he is a bigger victim of political violence than JFK or MLK.

He played on the same fears Sanders supporters feel. The difference is Sanders has a history of fighting the good fight and delivering what he promises. Whereas Trump is quite proud of his history as a con-man. He literally wrote the definitive book on the subject. While Trump strolled down 5th Avenue (probably looking for a puppy to kick he’s so cartoonishly evil) Sanders was being arrested for taking part in Civil Rights protests. They both run on the same fuel, just in radically different ways."
