AskMen,ff8sqks,t3_esavjh,1579694649.0,"Have found that decent people will be welcoming and hospitable to a new person joining their group. But have also experienced exclusion. Doesn't have to be about age either. Sometimes they find any kind of ""difference"" and make it a reason to exclude. You won't know which it is till you are in it. But you will learn something about your BF by the way he handles the situation. I would recommend being your kind, genuine self and observing. You certainly don't need to impress anyone. Good luck!"
conspiracy,ff7j1gt,t1_ff7iimv,1579650702.0,Very well put. Will be using this in future.
NoStupidQuestions,ff3tpzu,t3_erhubn,1579548646.0,Date who you want and give no thought to anyone else.
1200isplenty,feu9jb2,t1_feu95yf,1579384464.0,Thanks for that. :) Appreciated!
GetMotivated,fettxqm,t1_fetqvl4,1579380042.0,That's excellent. Congratulations@
1200isplenty,fettder,t1_feta99n,1579379845.0,"Pardon my noseyness-- I think this is a great practice. Is it something you are committed to doing long-term to maintain your healthy weight? In my case I've noticed that lack of tracking always leads to a bad place. I'm coming to terms with the fact that, if I want to maintain my favourite size, I have to track for the rest of my life. I'm wrapping my mind around the concept. And I wonder how many out there -- have reached their perfect weight and continue to track."
1200isplenty,fet7apj,t1_ferbej1,1579372443.0,Do you track with an app?
1200isplenty,fet6y1a,t3_eq8u56,1579372344.0,So amazing to have nothing off limits!
1200isplenty,fet6o6j,t3_eq5xoo,1579372257.0,There’s something so simple and beautiful about CICO. Old faithful indeed!
fatlogic,fet3jhz,t3_eqazl3,1579371472.0,"100% of dieters experience regain when they cease having a calorie deficit. To maintain our new, healthy weight, we have to maintain energy balance. There’s no way around this. Trust me, I’ve looked!"
Purebarre,femqlwi,t3_eq05e2,1579266736.0,"During times of stress, I’ve found that any exercise is better than none. And as the workload lessens, those other things can be added back in."
raisedbynarcissists,felhs2f,t3_epshzl,1579222483.0,"Yes, normal. It’s possible to have those feelings and still have your necessary boundaries/healthy distance etc."
NarcissisticAbuse,fek384a,t1_fek32yo,1579191661.0,Good for you! Keep on keeping on! :)
NarcissisticAbuse,fek169m,t3_epl49y,1579190397.0,Protect your own boundaries at all costs. Try explaining your requirements for these boundaries to your friend. But don’t be drawn into an argument about it. You don’t need to convince or persuade. Try to tell her lovingly and gently and leave it with her.
ufo,fejzaqo,t1_fejdzr7,1579189238.0,"Exactly. Why? Seems like a forum to share space related technical info. And that seems to be a bit of a security red flag. Follow the money as they say. 

Would be good to know if this group has come to any shared conclusions about the phenomena. Are they for or against sharing evidence with the public? According to the video, they are interested in the nuts and bolts aspect. So it would be great if they shared any nuts and bolts evidence with the rest of us."
CanadaPublicServants,fei5mcb,t1_fei576c,1579130803.0,That is fantastic! Congratulations! I agree about this subreddit. Totally invaluable.
CanadaPublicServants,fehytak,t3_ep8os6,1579126614.0,"Seems like a good plan. Even if candidates are not playing games — if they are legitimately applying for jobs and have no control over which LOO comes through first — it is reassuring for good faith candidates that they aren’t causing major suffering for the manager they turn down. I know someone waiting on 4 potential LOOs. For him, it probably comes down to which LOO, if any, materializes first."
CanadaPublicServants,fehuy4j,t1_fehuiou,1579124376.0,"Can you create a pool even if that was not stated at the outset. Can you reserve that right? Also, would you ever tell a candidate that they were choice 2 or 3? I imagine that would bittersweet news to the candidate — but they’d be happy to get the job."
HighStrangeness,fehujim,t3_ep8fls,1579124144.0,Perhaps the videos demonstrate USA capabilities that are actually and rightfully kept private. One can imagine scenarios where it’s wise not to show all your cards to enemies foreign or domestic. The word “gravely” is notable. This seems like a hard no as far as disclosing this material. I recall Luis Elizondo once saying that there are certain needs which outweigh public curiosity. It’s frustrating but seems like it’s a dead end for openness on this incident.
CanadaPublicServants,fehgjht,t1_fegm6gy,1579116080.0," ""Sometimes they only check references for ""close calls"" where the interview marks are close to passing and they want to establish which way to go with the candidate. ""

Is that right? I thought that interviews were pass/fail per question. Is it really the case that a candidate could fail a part of the interview and still continue in the process? I had the idea that it was really rigid. But is there actually some flexibility?"
CanadaPublicServants,fef7jb7,t3_ehx9ld,1579050033.0,Any news about how you did on the interview yet?
raisedbynarcissists,fdyg0pn,t3_en1i3i,1578779421.0,"Want to add something— there’s an N in my experience that, for business reasons, cannot be avoided. Have somehow managed to become so grey and dull that this person literally yawns every time we interact for any length of time. Not exaggerating. At first, it seemed kind of insulting. Am I that boring? But then I realized that I’d effectively made myself a non-supply! So all is well. ;)"
raisedbynarcissists,fdt4edf,t3_en1i3i,1578711770.0,"Impossible to say the best course. Only you can know. But for sure doing the same will get the same.  You might try altering your behaviour slightly. Be a less interesting supply. Go “grey” a little bit. Spend more time with yourself making yourself happy. This person might just vibrate right out of your experience. Or her behaviour might change. But regardless, nothing is worth disrupting your hard earned peace of mind."
raisedbynarcissists,fdt27v5,t3_en1i3i,1578710962.0,Yes. Have unwittingly attracted all the wrong types over and over. The way out is to try to notice the pattern in its early stages and try to do something different. This is a life’s work. But worth it.
interestingasfuck,fdlux75,t3_em2ca1,1578533078.0,There goes my good night’s sleep
AskMen,fdlukcx,t3_em27qn,1578532837.0,We are all basically brains and brain stems walking around. So the gender of a person is really irrelevant for the most part. Life gets so much easier when you can kind of bracket gender concerns. Whatever mind tricks you need to do is worth it.
vegan1200isplenty,fdlty8g,t1_fdlfohf,1578532424.0,Uranium lol!
selfimprovement,fdkye3l,t3_elxvm7,1578513711.0,"When on the receiving end of this kind of stuff, I imagine that it’s just like dogs barking or cats meowing. They are just making noise because they can. It’s more for them to hear the sound of their own voice and to feel alive. The sounds have nothing to do with my design of my life. I don’t get mad — or even respond — because it’s not a legitimate dialogue. Hopefully this doesn’t sound too mean. By really, many utterances don’t require a response."
vegan1200isplenty,fdhf7wk,t1_fdh8u60,1578421382.0,I switched to Cronometer! Calorie counts are more accurate.
CanadaPublicServants,fde5wmp,t3_ek9298,1578331875.0,Any updates?
1200isplenty,fdbx6fo,t1_fdbjzd0,1578263321.0,Hahaha!! 100 percent!!
1200isplenty,fdb18f7,t3_ekhka9,1578252591.0,Exactly! Each calorie is a precious part of the budget. Not to be wasted on anything that isn’t delicious and/or nutritious. Everything wonderful within my budget!
fatlogic,fcu3g4p,t1_fctruod,1577971443.0,Ha ha ha!! Brilliant!!
fatlogic,fcu3b2o,t1_fcti9wx,1577971301.0,Congratulations on changing your pre-diabetic status. That is outstanding!
answers,fcscgao,t3_eio0io,1577914600.0,"Confidence is magnetic. Have seen this play out many times, overtaking all other factors. Taking care of yourself via fitness and nutrition demonstrates that you value yourself. Also magnetic. Goes for any gender as it happens."
fatlogic,fcnxfzf,t1_fcnx3xa,1577820345.0,Great! So relatable that emotional eating.  Feels great to control those emotions. I’m in the same boat and remain ever vigilant against emotional eating. It’s math for me. Strictly living by the laws of thermodynamics.
fatlogic,fcnv0aq,t1_fcnhljf,1577818966.0,"They can argue with the BMI chart if they have a problem. There's nothing wrong with living at the low end of the healthy BMI range. And it's so weird to need to defend this! And yet here we are!! Stick to your guns, everyone! Happy shopping!!"

vegan1200isplenty,fcgcns4,t1_fc9qoqg,1577638666.0,"Right? The first time I really understood the calories in ramen — boy. I had to question whether it’s worth it. As a kid, I believed it was healthy because it was noodles rather than pizza or a burger. I was incredibly ignorant!"
fatlogic,fcgc3vj,t1_fcfhast,1577638481.0,"Guaranteed relationships will change. Not all, but some."
fatlogic,fcgbw2x,t1_fcg16wt,1577638401.0,"So relatable. In my case, I do my talking about it anonymously. When the IRL folks  start their nonsense, I tell them I am following medical advice and refuse to engage."
fatlogic,fcgb55k,t1_fcg17ew,1577638256.0,Ridiculous
fatlogic,fcey7aj,t3_egrqt2,1577624845.0,Thanks everyone for those tips. Weighed in this morning. It’s just data. Onward!
fatlogic,fcamo07,t1_fcambdn,1577572282.0,"Yes, you are right! Well put. It's so irrational. Am having a good laugh at myself!!"
fatlogic,fcad1lf,t1_fcacpt4,1577567076.0,"Well, there is some comfort knowing that it’s just an indicator of where I am right now and that it will go down. And admitting to that anxiety is a big step. Also, by this time tomorrow it will be old news!"
fatlogic,fcac4l8,t1_fcac2ay,1577566536.0,Thank you for that tip!
fatlogic,fca70q7,t3_egrqt2,1577564000.0,"Started my fitness pal 3 days ago. Ordered a scale and it has arrived. Nervous about stepping on it tomorrow morning.

vegan1200isplenty,fc6qa82,t3_eggo1f,1577486763.0,Brand new person here. This is Day 3 for me tracking on an app. Not sure if we can mention brand names. It’s the free one. Am thankful to have found this particular group because it is just what I need right now. Was surprised to find something this specific!
vegan1200isplenty,fc6q2id,t3_egdk99,1577486613.0,Had the PB one today. It was incredible! And happily within my 1200!

Myfitnesspal,fc37je4,t1_fb5544w,1577383352.0,This was helpful. Thank you.
