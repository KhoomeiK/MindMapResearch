aww,fd42l3k,t1_fd419a9,1578163794.0,"It *was* good. Now I can't go see my Lab...... My wife is at work and my dog is across the road from my flat. I have my children with me and I can't leave them to go to my dog. Bed time and what not... Kids, eh!

&#x200B;

just to add, the other day I looked out the bedroom window (The pub where I work is LITERALLY across the street) and I noticed the curtains in the Bosses bedroom window move, lo and behold a yellow lab stuck its face out of the window to have a look at the world. I opened my window, shouted ""LOUIS"". he looked at me and you know when a dog wags its tail. It was going 10 to the dozen..

Yeah,  went over and gave him a big fuss.."

aww,fd3zi2u,t1_fd3vazh,1578162966.0,"I have to say Maley and me is one of my favourite movies. I always cry at it . I have a Lab myself ( the time I watched M&M I had a different Lab which my ex took away from me. Long story and upsets me to this day) The Lab I have now is now resident at the Pub I work at and looked after by my boss. I live in a flat with  my family now literally across the road from the pub I work at.  


The flat does not allow animals due to having a fast food outlet below us. So my boss took him in for me. I obviously see him everyday and take him out, but I would never let him go away from myself. Its a shitty situation to be in for us both but hes happy,  I am happy hes looked after. Many of the staff at the pub take him out if I cant manage it due to working hours etc. He is always fussed and treated well when the guys pop upstairs for after work drinks and chill."

tabletopgamedesign,fd3jzo8,t3_ejyuji,1578159024.0,"I am currently testing out a game I have designed. It uses two 3x3 grids though (technically it is 4x3 but one row of squares is purely for non active dice, in a way). One for each player and a handfull of D6 are the remaining components."

educationalgifs,fcyv9vw,t1_fcyuwx5,1578087837.0,Educational guess is the light/match the person was holding would have touched the wire wool in some way and reduced the weight. Maybe it 'lifted' the wire wool slightly.

photography,fc5xw3m,t1_fc5thva,1577468181.0,"So you basicaly set your camera to use continuous focus using the info display then on your menu in settings you set the button for AF-on or whatever it is on your make of camera to AF-lock.

Now test this out, grab a glass of water or anything stationary, press the newly assigned button once to focus. Press your shutter button fully and take the shot. Now try this, point your camera to the furthest object in the room your are in, press and HOLD the new assigned button and move the camera to a different object closer  to you, you will now see it continuously focusing on where ever the camera is pointing. Press the shutter down fully to graba  picture.

I have only just found this out and it is the best thing ever"
