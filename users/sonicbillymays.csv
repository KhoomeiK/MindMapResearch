Works fine as intended. Its okay. All colors except a good orange so i tend to use purple. Has flashing options but its meh on that aspect, if you want to only use a solid red green blue or other color then i would absolutely suggest it. But im sure theres better options out there if you look more!"

internetparents,fecuwbh,t3_eobm5w,1578985573.0,"Not muslim or female but am a son of an immigrant family, and if i were in a situation that i believe would lead to me getting kicked out i would lie and i LOVE lying. When you have strict parents you become a good liar, bc I dont want to deal w my parents BS. Immigrant parents have a different mindset than local parents that say grew up like in the USA. Itâ€™ll be hard sometimes to change our parents views but sometimes it aint worth it. All i can do is advise that you lie and tell you theres nothing wrong with lying to your strict overprotective parents. Live your life make your own choices. Godspeed"

marketing,fecqosx,t3_eo6lsp,1578981081.0,"Thank you for sharing this story. Because im not a marketing major (school doesnt offer it anyway) im a Graphic Design Major and i want to do what youâ€™re trying to do on the marketing side, of handling events, marketing plans as well as SEO, Adwords, Hubspot and the technical side of marketing.

I plan on finding a marketing internship by next summer to get started so im very happy to hear of what youâ€™ve experienced while job searching, but i wish you best of luck as well! Just stick to youtube, everything i learn in GD can be taught even better on youtube. The only major difference is all the one on one critiques i get with my professors to further improve myself."
