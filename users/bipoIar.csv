depression,fd4wtm7,t3_ek1svd,1578171813.0,"New fresh starts can be a great beginning. Perhaps it’ll improve a not-so-great life. That’s what I need too, a fresh start, and leave everything else behind. I’m too much of a coward to end my life so this is me, barely hanging on. I hope everything goes well for you."
depression,fd3gqkt,t3_ejsoej,1578158207.0,Exactly. That’s what it takes for people to realize they never knew what they had til it’s gone.
misanthropy,fcteo2i,t3_eim3mf,1577940848.0,"Honestly? No one. And to be even more honest, I wish I had someone to trust."
depression,fctdyl6,t3_eis3us,1577940221.0,"I literally just had this thought. All these years of socializing and not a single person who cares. Not even my own family. I wonder if people would even notice if I just offed myself one day. It’s a cold scary world, one that I don’t want to be in."
depression,fctd1wh,t3_eihb2v,1577939439.0,I always had this thought. I feel like I wasted my soul on a life that I don’t deserve because I don’t want to be here.
