Also, you talked about halo, I wasnt a big halo fan myself, but I love the Tom Clancy Ghost Recon games, I loved traversing through the levels were a bullet is usually death. Slow and methodical, sure they ruined it with wildlands (Though still a 8.5/10 game) and breakpoint just finished breaking the love I had for the games. 

Also, yeah Im 100% pro difficulty. If a player is strugling they might change the difficulty to easy, and that would ruin the accomplishment. But I don't think releasing extremely hard games is the right move, releasing really hard games with a extremely hard difficulty is good, so players can go through on a second playthrough. But basically telling the 90% of sekiro players ""Hey yeah we know you think the game is really hard, so we made it harder"" would make a solid half of your player base quit, or ask for refunds on steam. And not leave sekiro as game of the year.

Now, I can see where you are comming from, and yeah that game seems pretty badass. But the problem with wanting sekiro and these 2019 games to be like that is that it would be waaay to hard for a lot of players. I can barely get by as a begginer with the kanji and all that, I can barely imagine what it would be like without it. 

And in this day and age making a game so hard means only veterans at that catagory play (you). And that is throwing away money. I would be in favour of them having a difficulty setting, like hard and impossible, and in impossible they remove the kanji, or make it appear later in on the attack. Also makes animations go faster.
