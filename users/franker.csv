OldSchoolCool,ffdos0u,t1_ffda2nw,1579825421.0,"> We should separate the artist from the art.

But there's just been so many artists with horrible personal lives throughout history, and since we can't judge them all, we have to give them all a pass, or we'll never be able to enjoy any art!  That's my favorite horseshit variation of this stupid logic.  

Imagine if a criminal defense lawyer tried to argue, ""your honor, you can't hold my client responsible for anything, because there have already been so many criminals in history! And, you know, he was in a gang where they all thought it was socially acceptable, so it's all cool!""  It's like the Idiocracy court."

In April 1820, Jefferson wrote to John Holmes concerning slavery: there is not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than I would, to relieve us from this heavy reproach [slavery] ... we have the wolf by the ear, and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go."

We just lament that we need to understand the people better and how we can't fault them for anything because that would just create more divisiveness.  And then we're baffled at how these politicians are the way they are.  It's like a kid that just wants to eat cookies all day, and the parents refusing to hold them accountable because they don't want to make the child mad."

As a beginner in this, it's difficult to interpret the relativeness.   Here's the results of a couple keywords I put into [ubersuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/).   Is it better/easier to go after a keyword with a traffic of 9,900 and competition of 36, or a keyword with a traffic of 201,000 and competition of 77?

* search volume:  9,900 high
* SEO difficulty:  36
* Paid difficulty:   10 easy
* cost per click:  1.86
