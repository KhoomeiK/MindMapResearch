battletech,ff6n7v7,t3_erxf7h,1579630791.0,"I don't think of the pirates in Battletech like the privateers in the golden age of piracy.   I think of them more along the line of minor nobility and their retainers (aka a lance with some armor) trying to generate some extra revenue and keep their skills sharp by conducting raids against concerns that are not under the control of their liege lord.

Most people tend to think of the successor states like a single unified modern European nation-state.  I find it more helpful to imagine more like the decentralized Holy Roman Empire.  Within one of the successor states a minor noble and their crew could be pirates raiding a small mining concern on the other side of the planet.  The next day they are part of the local militia beating back a ""pirate"" raid from the next system.   The following year they could fulfill their service and go on a longer campaign.

Then you have the younger sibling without a clear inheritance, going off adventuring trying to make enough of a fortune or name for themselves in order to secure their own title of nobility.   Depending on the options available a lot of this adventuring could start to look like piracy."

Both of these are hold overs from the demo and both have been patched a couple of times.   They also closely couple to the mechanics around ambushes, pilot skills, mechlab, and using your lance command tool.  I am not going to call everything flawless but at least make sure you are reading criticism from someone who understands the mechanics and not the old MWO Anti-PGI Salt show.
