Having said that, you also need to respect that you are part of a family. You are not on your own, you live with your parents and their other children. There will be some expectations that you’ll participate in the family dynamic. My brother was 16 when I was born, he moved out when he was 18 so I never really knew him as a child. But I’m sure that he considered me to be his little sister and helped watch me while he was living at home. That’s what family does."
