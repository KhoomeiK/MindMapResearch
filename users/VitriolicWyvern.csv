AmItheAsshole,ffejldf,t1_ffehgcj,1579850689.0,Sounds like you aren’t ready for marriage if that’s how you see it.
unpopularopinion,ffb64bc,t1_ffawxhe,1579752805.0,Calm down cOmRaDe. My point is I’m not abusing a system that isn’t meant for me.
vegan1200isplenty,ffar7c8,t3_esh7ht,1579742592.0,Oooh I’ll have to try these. I may not be vegan but I’m always open to low calorie options!
unpopularopinion,ffaqxn8,t3_esk8v0,1579742408.0,"Maybe not completely relevant but reminded me of an experience I had. I’ve had people tell me to register my cat as an emotional support animal because I was having a hard time finding a place to rent that allowed cats. 

Straight up told me that if I registered my cat that the property owner couldn’t legally deny me. Like??? Why though??? That’s abusing a system that is not meant for me. I in no way need an emotional support animal so using it to bully a land owner into letting me live in their rental is an absolute disgusting and shitty thing to do. 


All in all I 100% agree with you."
youngpeopleyoutube,ff9j307,t3_esdb1l,1579714083.0,He’s not even young I don’t think. Isn’t he in his 20s? All I know of him is what I learned from the Idubbbz video.
caloriecount,fev7ddy,t1_feuxbtz,1579394017.0,I’m not sure about my body type but I’m 5’7 and 155. According to TDEE Im ideal in the 130’s. I do have decent muscle I think but have always had “padding” since I was little so I don’t know how muscular I actually am.
MadeMeSmile,feu0q58,t3_eqkx90,1579381993.0,These always get me. I remember how it felt seeing my husband come home and that was with me knowing he was on his way!
caloriecount,fetuzwj,t1_fet8e6r,1579380305.0,I’m as muscular as I’ve ever been luckily. I make it a point to work my muscles while I’m at work
caloriecount,fepny2g,t1_fepghew,1579325631.0,It does but I used the TDEE calculator so I roughly know my maintenance and deficit numbers.

caloriecount,feo66rn,t1_feo15ik,1579295655.0,Calorie deficit is exactly what I’ve been doing. I successfully went from 210 to 150 with it.
caloriecount,fenwtzb,t1_fent2mx,1579292072.0,"I haven’t had any issues with it either. TDEE says 1,200 is just fine for me which is why I had been sticking with it. I definitely don’t work out as much as I’d like but I work childcare for almost 11 hours a day 5 days a week. Don’t have much time for the gym."
caloriecount,fenwl29,t1_fens9pt,1579291945.0,Yeah it’s usually pizza or BBQ whenever we have cheat days. So sodium is probably part of if not the whole issue.

TrueOffMyChest,feliff9,t3_eprq4m,1579222929.0,I mean I agree for the most part but I don’t let it bug me. Attention feeds them (the bullshitters) and I find getting so worked up is just an honest waste of my energy.
birthcontrol,fel2kfb,t1_fekyu82,1579212684.0,"Best of luck to you! My periods were super heavy lasting weeks to months which was my original reason for starting BC. Currently I’m on mononessa and I’m loving it. 

I’m lucky that the hair fall stopped after getting it removed but now it seems my hair is very brittle and dry."
birthcontrol,fekwgil,t1_fekua8x,1579209021.0,It’s definitely stressful. Because my hair used to be so thick I’m hyper aware of how thin it is and stress that I look like I’m balding. Did you get your removed or did it stabilize without removal?
AskReddit,fejaost,t1_fejaiz1,1579164456.0,Oooooh gotcha.
AskReddit,fej9vrt,t1_fej70uq,1579163310.0,Sounds pretty unprofessional to be taking pictures of your patients like that. (Assuming he was a patient she worked with)
facepalm,fej45a8,t3_epemxp,1579156201.0,We could breathe and be called racist.
Hair,feixcp2,t3_epedu9,1579149815.0,I’ve been hyper aware of my hair since I noticed it falling out. Since getting the IUD removed over a year ago the shedding has stopped and regrowth has started but I still feel so self conscious about it. My husband says it looks fine but it’s still causing me anxiety.

AmItheAsshole,fec5een,t3_eoctui,1578966910.0,NTA!!! NTA NTA NTA!!! Your boyfriend is the asshole. For him to be so inconsiderate and to be jealous of your relationship with the people you served with??? My husband himself has deployed and there are things he won’t even talk to me about; it’s something you just have to accept when in a relationship with a vet. find someone who is going to respect your boundaries and your relationship with your brothers.

relationships,fdyjyxy,t1_fdyiymo,1578780622.0,Part of being a sister is respecting each other’s boundaries. I would never ask my sister to cut or dye her hair for me and she would never ask the same of me.
AskReddit,fdunew7,t1_fduapan,1578735764.0,I’ve played it through multiple times and love it more with every playthrough. It definitely isn’t everyone’s thing though. My husband isn’t very fond of it because of the combat as well.
AskReddit,fdun9se,t3_en4uuh,1578735695.0,"It’s not that I dislike it, it’s just I don’t see the appeals; most Nintendo games especially Mario. Maybe it’s because I didn’t grow up with?"

Old_Recipes,fdsr9bd,t1_fds165p,1578706911.0,Well hopefully they can help bring you a lovely homey feeling ❤️
Old_Recipes,fdsr06g,t1_fds97m5,1578706820.0,Depends on how big of cookies you want. If you want them small enough to be eaten in one bite could easily make over 30. Regular size maybe 13 to 20? Not sure because I never bothered to count. If you wanted you could spread it out in a sheet and cut it even.
Old_Recipes,fdrq6we,t1_fdrm9mv,1578688103.0,I’m so happy you liked them!
Old_Recipes,fdrq3wb,t1_fdrhrea,1578688057.0,Never had them that way. If I were to skip cocoa id add extra peanut butter lol
Old_Recipes,fdrq0gf,t1_fdre6eg,1578688011.0,No problem! Though I feel like that Peter Pan peanut butter might be way too sweet for it considering these cookies already have such a rich flavor.
Old_Recipes,fdrpwcj,t1_fdr98dk,1578687950.0,Please do!
Old_Recipes,fdrpufm,t1_fdqxq06,1578687919.0,Do it do it do it!

Old_Recipes,fdrpk8e,t1_fdqmbfa,1578687753.0,"Lol that’s great. My mother would get so frustrated by the fact my sister, dad and I would eat them before they even had a chance to cook down. Growing up it felt like no one knew about them! I’d ask my fiends if they had ever had them and they’d just say they sounded gross :( i honestly thought it was a recipe that was exclusive to my family for awhile lol."
Old_Recipes,fdrompc,t1_fdqli70,1578687432.0,I’m loving hearing all the different names and occasions you guys would make them for ❤️❤️❤️
Old_Recipes,fdrogi8,t1_fdqj82w,1578687328.0,I’ve found they both work just fine.

AskReddit,fdpy82z,t3_emnj5b,1578645650.0,This guy my husband works with is 28 and confessed while drunk that he was a virgin.
Old_Recipes,fdpxlps,t1_fdpww2m,1578644823.0,Same! The only other name I’ve heard them called was “Winston Churchill’s favorite cookie”
Old_Recipes,fdpxiez,t1_fdpwdy3,1578644703.0,"I’ve made them with multiple kinds and it doesn’t seem to make much of a difference. When I was kid it was Jiffy I think, then later she started using Adams."
Old_Recipes,fdpv3de,t1_fdptmjf,1578641707.0,I’m happy to share!
Old_Recipes,fdptl6j,t1_fdpsojb,1578639957.0,They would be so amazing on snow days except where I currently live it’s snowy for half the year lol. I plan on making them soon when my husband gets promoted though.
Old_Recipes,fdpri7l,t1_fdpo3t1,1578637718.0,She only ever added it if it happened to be in the house (which was rare) but they’re a great addition. Sometimes she’d add sliced almonds too.
Old_Recipes,fdpmztf,t1_fdpk23c,1578633273.0,I’ve always loved them mushy. I found underboiling just makes them gritty because the sugar didn’t dissolve/break down. I rarely ever let them cool fully because I love eating the warm gloopy mess.
Old_Recipes,fdpdzuj,t3_emkzjm,1578626212.0,I probably should have included that they’re no bake cookies in the title.

FoodPorn,fdmsb8q,t1_fdmrvo4,1578563325.0,"You should try no bake cookies next. My mom would make them when I was growing up. They’re so good I’d eat the whole batch if given the chance. Basically mix sugar, butter, milk, peanut butter, vanilla (?) and coconut (it’s optional) on the stove, remove from heat and add oatmeal. Plop on wax paper and cool."
progun,fdmrx32,t3_em6rjp,1578562766.0,"Alaska. Insanely lax laws and wouldn’t you know it, very little gun crime if any (because everyone and their grandma has a gun) 

I love my state."
FoodPorn,fdmrtb9,t3_em713u,1578562624.0,They look amazing! Snickerdoodles were my first cookie as well; my grandma tought me and I’ve loved them ever since.
Fairbanks,fdmnix2,t3_em61on,1578556854.0,If there’s no real reason other than “it’s cold” I’d say it would be wrong to not go to work. If -40 is too cold for you I’d recommend either moving to Anchorage or the lower 48 for your comfort.
AskReddit,fdmmsvp,t3_em5vj8,1578555974.0,Banana bread and milk.
TrueOffMyChest,fdmmfad,t3_em5vnw,1578555526.0,As a woman I have to agree. Stuff like that for sure happens but I don’t doubt there’s a decent amount of fabrication that goes on from time to time.

AskReddit,fdh39y7,t1_fdgerix,1578414450.0,I guess I’m talking about their outward identity? Not sure how to word it. Like during an introduction of they just HAVE to mention they’re autistic or are constantly bringing it up as if it’s some quirky trait. Or they say something really weird and out of place that gets people attention and their follow up is “lol sorry I’m autistic”.
TrueOffMyChest,fdgcl0u,t3_el8p3i,1578390210.0,I’m very happy you are able to consciously make the decision.
AskReddit,fdgcevb,t3_el969l,1578389962.0,"As someone on the spectrum I don’t think much more of them than I do anyone else. But I hate the ones who feel the need to make it a part of their identity or blame everything on it when it isn’t relevant. 

I understand there is an extremely broad spectrum, but when high-ish functioning ones feel a need to announce it, I can’t help but roll my eyes."

unpopularopinion,fd81ysn,t1_fd7ts95,1578212957.0,"Exercise certainly helps but the main key is the calories you take in to the calories you burn. For sure it’s not the answer for EVERYONE but calories are in fact a major factor for weight loss. 

You can exercise all you want but if you are consuming more than you burn you will not lose weight. Where you can count your calories and not exercise and still lose weight (though won’t be toned and “fit”)."
