Even if you don't report this to the police (which I frankly believe you should), you need to get away from this individual. I'm sure it's hard to think about the five years you've invested, but your present and future are all that really matter now.

Thank you for the courage to come here and talk about what happened. Everyone here cares about you and your ultimate well-being."
depression,fe5szww,t3_enqkiy,1578874278.0,"What an interesting topic. Yes, I have had that sensation. It's usually just some natural fragrance, and for a moment, I'm reminded of good, unburdened times. And then I just want to shut those memories off -- I can't bear the thought of longing for what was. I'm suddenly aware of this incredible chasm between where I am and where I used to be. I'm grateful you brought this up; it's just good to feel understood.

Good luck to you."
depression,fdmfog8,t1_fdmcqgw,1578548342.0,"Sending you love back, Alex."

depression,fdltoi1,t1_fdjqyzi,1578532243.0,"I agree with your assessment that often just getting through the day reflects our inner strength. While dark thoughts and self-doubt are constantly whirling through our brain, just taking that next step to do what is essential requires great will and fortitude. I really appreciate you acknowledging it."

depression,fbypx2v,t3_ef4960,1577223226.0,"Thank you for your open-hearted share.

My only child, a 28-year-old son, now lives in Japan. I'm in Northern California.

He's flying in today with his girlfriend for the holidays, and I'll be picking him up and driving him to his mom's house locally. He's a wonderful young man, and I love him dearly. He flew home last Christmas, too.

But I'm just struggling with increased darkness today. I don't experience the joy I once did, and it's particularly hard when the circumstances would seem to dictate something far better. I hate wearing the mask, but it's generally what gets me through social situations like these. I just need to shut off the inner critic and proceed.

I'm sorry to hear of your own struggles, but I can certainly empathize with the effort it will take you to show up and ""act normal.""

I've seen your many kind responses to other comments on here, and I just want to acknowledge your good heart.

Do your best; that's all that we can ask of ourselves under these challenging circumstances.

And Merry Christmas."
depression,fbwlt1n,t3_eendp2,1577153298.0,"I can appreciate mastering those small challenges. I'm taking much better care of myself and I was 9 months ago, and that's indeed an achievement. I give you great credit for doing the same. Thank you for speaking out. You are a mirror for many of us."
