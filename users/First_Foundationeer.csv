You are right that Google has a lot of resources, but most of these classes are not teaching you information so much as the process of figuring out what the best concise representation of that information is. I guess, at heart, it's teaching you the human version of SINDy in a sense."

If they want the support of their idiot electorate who don't understand practical solutions, then partial legalization will drive those uncompromising religious folks to fight against them. It isn't about enforcing the bans so much as appearing to support those who do not compromise.

Now, on the other hand, if these same politicians recognize that there is a significant population of pragmatists, then there might be hope."

It was actually an increase of 20 minutes of commute PER DAY (not just one way) is comparable to a paycut of 19%.
