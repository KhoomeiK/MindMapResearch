I think there's an article in this book, which is a good all-around Psychology book. In essence, they postulate that people who stayed in a primitive style of hunter/gathering have to be more attuned to their world, by necessity. Dreams, the researchers believe are a way to facilitate the movement from short-term memory into long-term. Obviously, I'm just paraphrasing because it's a study I haven't read in a long time and as well I don't know what their methodology was like."

On the decision to scrap waterboarding from the SERE training. 

My ex-gf was in the Marines and took SERE training. If she is to be believed (I wasn't there) she was locked in a dog cage and sprayed down with cold water. I also think there were ""psychologists"" there to determine a person's limits. The tale told to me is that the highest level of SERE training they were allowed to break a couple bones but like I said, that's hearsay. 

One of the interrogators I heard lecture said the best way to turn someone is to help their family out because people will do anything to give their families a better life. 



Veteran military interrogator and intelligence officer Steven Kleinman told HuffPost. Waterboarding “teaches failure,” he said. “No one succeeds. They can’t teach a strategy during that. Literally, it was absolutely so painful.”"
