roosterteeth,ff6jwo7,t3_erxcan,1579628778.0,"For anyone curious about what Silver Dollar City is, I've best seen it described as imagine a Cracker Barrel gift shop, but with roller coasters."
ChernobylTV,fero4qy,t1_feq00dh,1579356376.0,"The other guy is right. The rush wasn’t because of party deadlines. They couldn’t build the sarcophagus until each roof was cleared. As long as the reactor stayed exposed to the air, it was a problem."
ChernobylTV,felif8d,t1_fek7v89,1579222926.0,"To be fair, the men who died in that hospital were part of the 31."
ChernobylTV,felia99,t1_fek1can,1579222829.0,Listened to the podcast before watching? Any reason you did that order?

roosterteeth,fee91ui,t1_fee5n8t,1579028908.0,"If you're referring to the ""making the rounds"", it's a crosspost from r/instant_regret, where it did really well. They're glad to see Achievement Hunter content is doing well on other subs."
roosterteeth,fee7aem,t1_fedz8f1,1579027870.0,"Dennis 3.0 has to be my favorite gag from them. I don't know how many times I replayed ""Bing Bong, it's been 12 minutes"" and everyone's reaction."
roosterteeth,fee74df,t1_fedssad,1579027771.0,"I loved the ""Oh my God"" from broadcast when Chris mentioned that he got a family member a Hail Clayton shirt for Christmas."
roosterteeth,fee6y3s,t1_fednynj,1579027668.0,"Blaine mentioned in a different podcast how he had to step away from the mic and you can hear him hit the table/wall to stifle his laughter from Jeremy's Beverly Kills joke. I heard him tell that story before listening to the episode of Good Morning from Hell, so it made it even funnier for me."
roosterteeth,fdna951,t1_fdlbtmb,1578581367.0,"That's part of what makes him an excellent addition to the podcast, he's willing to tell embarrassing stories about himself for a good laugh."
roosterteeth,fdknpe5,t1_fdj1lvf,1578507368.0,I believe he's previously been referred to as Vice President of Hell on the podcast.
roosterteeth,fcy0ax5,t3_ehj84f,1578072897.0,I thought Lawrence did an awesome job with this! He spoke so well and had some really good lines in my opinion.
corgi,fcxmi10,t1_fcxjp13,1578066489.0,What made you choose River? Our pet names are based on characters from shows my wife and I watch. River came from Doctor Who for us.
corgi,fcwuqih,t3_ej9e7n,1578038426.0,This is the second post this week that I’ve seen on here where someone’s Corgi has the same name as ours!
boeing,fcw8pfp,t1_fcw8jxk,1578019707.0,"It’s accrued every pay period, so every 2 weeks. The total number of days above converted into hours, then divided by 26 will give the bi-weekly amount."
boeing,fcvmwy4,t1_fct6sm6,1578005544.0,"With the exception of new hires who are still in their first year with the company, everyone's annual PTO will be the same as Vacation plus sickleave from before. First year employees get an additional 2 days on top of the 10 vacation plus 10 sick leave, which puts them at the same amount as anyone at 1-4 years. So 0-4 years is 22 days, 5-9 years is 25 days, 10-14 years is 27 days, 15-24 years is 30 days, and 25+ years is 32 days. Maximum accrual is any of these values multiplied by 1.5"
roosterteeth,fcute3i,t1_fcspprj,1577988124.0,"I think those were all bonus categories, but didn't count towards the main competition. I think it was primarily just who could eat there the most."
roosterteeth,fcpa3qz,t1_fcp97be,1577855775.0,"He tagged the sub because your comment was either supposed to be a reply to someone or it doesn’t make sense to the wording of the post. You just put “nah it’s not” but what is that for? Also, they’re both adults. Age differences happen. It’s not creepy, grow up."
corgi,fcp9w2a,t3_ei9tbw,1577855547.0,"Our Corgi is named River as well! But she is far more tan. She is named after River Song from Doctor Who, and mainly nicknamed as Riv-ee"
roosterteeth,fbjrmm5,t1_fbjkt5c,1576938867.0,"There probably wouldn’t be too many reasons for this guy to complain about a game mode that is over a decade old, except he is probably raging about recently doing really badly in it."
