ChineseInstruments,ffe7lku,t1_ffe5xnd,1579838860.0,Thank you so much! Sound of mountain has a good option that I can afford. I hope I'll be able to start in the summer.
schoolsucks,ffcmj8d,t3_essj0b,1579802620.0,"School time should be shortened for students. It would give more time for teachers to get a lesson plan ready, meaning shorter classes times of a higher quality. Also allows more time for students to do homework and for teachers to grade without rushing. It annoys me so much how uninterested the US is in reforming the education system."
SuicideWatch,ff2h8or,t1_ff2gtt7,1579506034.0,"I tend to internalize my suffering, and nobody really knows the extent of it in any way. Nobody in my family even knows somethings up, but in school and at night a flip switches in my head where I cant help but think about dying and about how I wish I were female. Talking about it is everything, but I've set myself up in a way where I cant. If you can talk to people about it or find people who would listen (even a teacher) it can help in unexpected ways. 

Hope things get better for you, you can message me if you want to talk to someone or vent, I don't really go to sleep much."

Antiques,fcrzd97,t1_fcrz3lo,1577908874.0,"You should, the results of gojo and steel wool would surprise you! If you have any questions about you're victrola in general, I'd be willing to help."
Antiques,fcrz165,t1_fcrwa14,1577908684.0,"Gojo is harmless to shellac. It's likely that the cleaning agent you used contained alchohol of some sort, as alchohol dissolves shellac"
mildlyinteresting,fcrw3fz,t3_cmcjrx,1577907418.0,"Augh, wrong side!"
Antiques,fcru113,t3_df6jor,1577906606.0,"I know this is an old post, but if you still have this, I would recommend cleaning this with GOJO hand cleaner (original formula without pumice) and #0000 steel wool. After letting the gojo sit there for 10 minutes, wipe it off thoroughly with paper towel. 

After it dries, you can use feed-N-Wax if you want 

This is a good cleaning method that's used by many in the phonograph world. Hope this helps!"
