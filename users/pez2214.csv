I was saying how I can't wait to make homemade his food and homemade japanese food and share our culture and heritage with them and I said something about chinese too. And he said, but you don't have chinese culture. You were raised japanese. And he just didn't get any of it. Essentially Chinese culture isn't who you are, it's japanese and I dont understand why you would want to teach your children something you dont know either. (I love him he is great just a little ignorant at times) and ya I hate that I can only order off a picture dim sum menu, just learned about the importance of shark fin soup to the middle class, I've taken years of Chinese through school and i cant read the ad on the train, that I dont know anything about chinese new year and don't have any traditions of my heritage.
