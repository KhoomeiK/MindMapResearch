Next-Day Availability—Section 229.10
Rules governing next-day availability of funds are set forth in section 229.10.


General Rules (§§ 229.10(a)–229.10(c))
Cash, electronic payments, and certain check deposits **must generally be made available for
withdrawal the business day after the banking day on which they were received.** Among the covered check deposits are cashier’s, certified, and teller’s checks; government checks (including U.S. Treasury checks, U.S. Postal Service money orders, state and local government checks, and checks
drawn on a Federal Reserve Bank or a Federal
Home Loan Bank); and certain on-us checks
(checks drawn on the same bank, or a branch
thereof).

https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/supmanual/cch/efaa.pdf


Also

“Available” does not mean cleared: When somebody writes you a check, it has ""cleared"" when the check writer’s bank transfers money to your bank and you can spend the funds. However, it's not always clear if or when the money arrives (or not). Your bank often allows you to spend money from deposited checks—and even withdraw cash—before a check clears.

Eliminate:

Animals need a lot of food and water to raise, humans can use most of that food and water directly. Growing plants can be easier than raising animals, especially as we perfect different growing methods like vertical farming, aeroponics and aquaponics. Fish could still be okay as part of the aquaponics systems.

We would also need to consider the impact of suddenly having to grow many, many more plants to source protein for people in place of the animals we use now. This could potentially be mitigated by continuing to eat fish.

Keep:

Animals are still the easiest source of protein and animal products are still used in many places (like leather, fertilizers, collagen, amongst other uses). Little goes to waste.

The biggest impact would be the type of animal raised. Cow or chickens? Goat or pigs?

The only criticisms I've seen lobbed at particular people are the ones directed at KK, JJ, and RJ, and that's either because of how badly they've acted in certain cases, or for their lack of planning and handling of the Disney Trilogy.
