depression_memes,fdrwbs8,t1_fdrhswy,1578690734.0,"I grew up on one, it’s technically a farm but we don’t really have any animals, just 2 cats. We have a barn though, it’s mostly upkeep I have to learn and such. Me wanting to die has something to do with the responsibility of it all but there are a lot of other factors"
SuicideWatch,fcnqkqo,t1_fcnnqfm,1577816562.0,"Thanks. I’m in therapy currently, I hope so Too"
SuicideWatch,fcnkx6h,t1_fcnktzp,1577813528.0,I’m ok with admitting this here because it relates and I’m anonymous
SuicideWatch,fcnktzp,t3_ei137q,1577813483.0,"I tried committing suicide at 14. People saying this makes me feel like I’m weak. Like I need to just suck it up. Like I’m just attention-seeking. I doubt myself. I don’t know why people say this. They don’t know how they make me feel. I don’t like admitting I tried to kill myself for them to prove a point or something. It’s none of their business. What are they trying to accomplish with saying it? I have no idea, maybe they want to stop hearing about it? If that’s the case, then why even say that. You can just tell me to shut the fuck up and I’ll stop."

Other creators are good Too, but those two are my personal favourites"
