The way you respond when something goes wrong. You’ve been doing things in particular ways for so long that this is the only path your brain knows how to take. Every time it happens, you’re so used to following the same pattern that you start doing it again without even noticing.

CBT with a therapist is a process of breaking down your old habits, and training your brain into adopting new, healthier ones. It’s gradual. It takes a while, and at first you **do** find yourself consciously stopping when you notice old habits and going *no, I don’t want to react this way; I’m going to reset and choose THIS instead*

Talking to someone in general can help in some of the same ways that therapy does. But it’s a lot easier to learn and reinforce new habits (they have to be reinforced before they can become automatic) when you’re supported by a therapist who knows exactly what you’re trying to do."

NoStupidQuestions,felw5gv,t1_felvmca,1579232434.0,"If you’re faced with two people, and Person A claims Person B is being a white knight rather than being genuinely kind...the way I solve that is to look at what I know of the two people.

Does Person A have a vested interest in discrediting Person B’s efforts?

 Does Person B have a history of being kind and respectful of others even without praise, or do they only do it when there’s something to be gained from performative kindness?"
NoStupidQuestions,felvu9u,t1_felvogx,1579232210.0,No. That’s just being a decent person.
NoStupidQuestions,felvbel,t3_epumyc,1579231832.0,"“White knighting”, as I would define it, is a kind of false respect. It’s not real. You’re only doing it in the hope that the person you’re doing it in front of will reward you somehow - not because you’re just a nice person or because you think they deserve your consideration anyway, but because you want to be **seen** to be making an effort, you want to be praised for that effort, you want the reward.

Genuine respect and courtesy is given to others regardless of whether you’re rewarded (or even noticed) or not. 


This distinction can be muddied by the fact that sometimes someone will try to discredit a genuine act of respect by questioning the motivation behind it and **claiming** it as white knighting."

Josephus himself was not old enough to have witnessed the events he writes about, but they would still have been in living memory when he was writing."
AskHistorians,feliwys,t3_epsn8x,1579223270.0,"There is some archaeological evidence for people connected with the story of Jesus, even if not for the man himself. We know, for instance, that Pontus Pilate was a real person active in Judea at the time the Biblical events of the Cruxifiction are supposed to have happened. We know King Herod the Great was a real person, who ruled the region where Jesus was born at the time he’s supposed to have been born. His son Herod Antipas appears in the Gospel of Luke when Christ was an adult, and we can confirm he was real too. The historicity of John the Baptist is generally accepted.

So some of the people **around** Jesus were definitely real. We can confirm that, and the evidence we have for them matches up (more or less) with the written accounts.

Christopher Hitchens is right that the written material all dates from after Jesus’ putative death...but he’s wrong to suggest that means it’s totally worthless. Secondary sources need to be taken with a grain of salt, especially here when they claim such extraordinary stuff...but we use them fairly frequently for other historical figures. 

It’s likely a man called Yeshua, the son of Miriam and Yosef the carpenter, existed in the right place at the right time. Whether or not he was **the messiah figure he claimed to be** is a different question."

Any person convicted of a crime has the right to appeal. Just like every other part of the legal process, appeals take time.

When the sentence they’ve been given is execution, going through the process and making **absolutely sure** that they’re really guilty before the sentence is carried out is important.
