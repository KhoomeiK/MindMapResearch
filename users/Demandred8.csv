AOWPlanetFall,ffdqr12,t3_et0hs1,1579826663.0,"I have not played the kir'ko much, so dont take this as gospel. But I have been on here for a while so I've picked up on some things.

As melee units go the kir'ko are ok. Honestly the assembly have a better front line infantry all told, but the Kir'ko are ok. Remember to prioritize defensive stance on the approach and maybe hold off on using their air attack until you have already closed in for melee. They also get an excelent early mod that Grant's regeneration. 

The Kir'ko hidden is a standout unit in this game. For the price you get an excelent damage dealer that wins against most enemies at range. Spamming hidden is an entirely viable strategy for winning the game. Remember to make liberal use of their jump ability to get flanks and escape danger. 

Kir'ko heroes also get the best ""assault vehicle"" option. It's fairly tough, has what amounts to a stun, deals good damage, comes with regeneration and has excelent mobility as well as an escape ability. Add early psynumbra mods in to the mix and early on Kir'ko heroes can get prety ridiculous. It's a good idea to have veteran and the assault vehicle (as well as kleptomaniac) and send your hero on their own while the rest of the army does something else. 

Psynumbra kirko is prety good, the secret tech units get a 20% damage boost for being Kir'ko. The mods also are great on your heros and an army of hidden and initiates would be hard to overcome with biological units, as well as benefitting from the same mods. Xenoplague is also good, but I dont care for it as much. Kir'ko has little to offer xenoplague units, though the hero abilities like skitter are very good. 

Celestian Kir'ko is also a fine way to go about things. The Kir'ko already have nice buffs to growth, and the celestian can help with that. The healing and support abilities are also great for keeping your units alive. Voidtech is interesting too, it comes with an excelent tier 1 mod and makes it much easier to focus on melee. The other options are ok (as far as I know) but nothing special. Hope this helps!"

So the German's had to invade (the soviets wouldnt until their advantage was overwhelming) and they had to invade as quickly as possible. 

Once Poland was invaded and the war begun, Germany was rendered isolated from most of the international community.

Most of it is about history prior to WWII, but it does go into detail about the third reich. Specifically, the question of germany's economic state just prior to war can be found here. You could also try looking up Hitler's top economics advisor when he first became chancellor. Living With Hitler is also a good deep dive on the liberal experience of the third Reich and makes reference to prominent liberal supporters of the regime (by liberal I mean real liberal, bot the US understanding of the term). The economic situation is also brought up herein.

The Secret of Stalingrad is a great, if old, book that focuses on the soviet experience of the Stalingrad campaign. Despite this there is still a lot of information about the wehermacht at the time and many of these myths are addressed here. Specifically the myth that Hitler was a uniquely bad leader is debunked. Another interesting note is that the wehermacht kept excelent minutes of the meetings between Hitler and his General's staff. However, several months worth of minutes around the time of Stalingrad were missing from the record after the war. In minutes prior to this Hitler had begun to profess misgivings about his officers perspectives on the war. This is, of course, very convenient. 

There are also a few youtube channels that go into this. Potential history is a self professed meme channel but has an excelent video debunking WWII myths named Germany could not win WWII. Its split into two parts but goes into all the myriad reasons why the Germans were doomed from the start. The WWII channel is also doing WWII week by week right now, and is absolutely worth a watch.

I light of all this hitler made a good scapegoat for getmab failures and atrocities all at once. Of course, in order for hitler to be solely responsible for the defeat then victory would have needed to be possible.

>listened to his generals

The minutes of meetings between Hitler and his Generals show that there was lively discussion and Hitler acquiesced to his generals demands as often as they did to his. At times he was right in his determination, at times they were. And later in the war neither party tended to be right (though Hitler was the only one with misgivings about the Kirsk offensive). It is also important to note that most ""evidence"" of Hitler's incompetence come from the memoirs of former wehermacht generals, who have something of a conflict of interest here.


>been patient

Prior to the invasion of Poland Hitler successfully revitalized the German economy. The popular myth is that he ""saved"" the economy, and the numbers initially seem to bear this out. Unfortunately for the Fuhrer there were serious problems with his economic plan. Unemployment was resolved not by creating more jobs, but by eliminating workers. Women and political enemies (jews and marxists) were denied work, and the political enemies were sent to work camps. Compounding this was fascist opposition to trade and consumer goods. The vast majority of new industrial production was for rearmament. The problem here is that, unlike consumer goods, military equipment generates no value of it's own. This meant that Germany's economy was teetering on the edge and if Hitler had waited much longer to begin the war the economy would likely have collapsed. 

>and not fucked with Russia in the winter.

This is the worst myth. No matter when the Germans launched their invasion there was no way they could conquer the USSR. People always forget that the Wehermacht was stopped outside Moscow before winter got going due to supply issues. Even if the invasion started earlier it would only have meant stopping outside Moscow earlier for the same reason. It might have even been worse for the Germans because the Red Army would have had less issues reinforcing and reorganizing in late summer than fall and winter. The winter counter offensive that nearly succeeded in our history may have succeeded if the red army could reinforce and restructure during fall and have all of winter with which to operate, though this probably wouldnt change much. People also seem to forget that slavs arnt magical, both sides suffered from winter equally. 

Tldr; there is no way the German's win WWII without a) changing their ideological objectives to the point that they probably wouldnt start the war anyway or b) introducing magic technology or a great deal of good luck that goes well beyond the realm of probability. Germany can't win WWII.

Ultimately though, the Germand succeeded as much thanks to good fortune as anything else.

There have been many political memes in this subreddit and the game itself is unabashedly political in the extreme (onenof the most overtly political games I have ever played), but this is the first one where I have seen many responses calling for getting ""politics"" out of this sub. 

That is because the previous posts were about issues that the community did not find divisive, thus rendering them ""apolitical"". This is the problem with the modern understanding of politics, it is inconsistent because it reflects the views of each community rather than an objective standard. Nazis are a good example of this. Because the general consensus is that nazis are bad, nazi memes and ""ironic"" nazis are apolitical because no one could seriously hold these views in the face of the consensus. Meanwhile, feminism is a contentious subject where there is no clear consensus. Thus you can have trolls shirposting about the holocaust being fake without much consequence, while a reference to feminism is immediately treated as political. 

This disregards the fact that in the grand scheme of things an ironic nazi and a real nazi look exactly the same online. Thus the holocaust jokes should be treated as just as political as the patriarchy jokes, because they both represent political activity. Just because there is a consensus on an issue does not mean that this issue is apolitical, and the fact that in the modern day people have fallen into this way of thinking is very concerning for the future of democracy and civil society."

The difference between right and left libertarians is we want to limit this ""enslavement"" to only society and make it as democratic as possible.

>Yes, while you are completely dependent on other people to survive you would become their slave, as you should, as you owe them your life anyway.

Mask off I guess. This statement here encapsulates my experience with lib right in general. You claim to care about personal rights and liberties, but in truth you have no problem with some people having a solute control over their 'dependents'. Indeed, your opposition to government is namely to eliminate one of the few means people have for regulating the domination of the elite. It was nice of you to just strait up admit that libertarianism in the US is just authoritarianism with extra steps."

In which case the family can simply cross it unmolested. It matters bot to me that the bridge owner is fully within his rights to make demands of the family, the purpose of this thought experiment is to illustrate the problem with private ownership of capital. The bridge owner generates wealth not through productive labor but merely through possession. Outside of the original construction of the bridge nothing is being added to society, and yet the owner is able to proffit in perpetuity. 

This is why all billionaires only achieved their wealth upon becoming owners. No amount of labor will make you a billionair, only ownership of capital can do that. And the nice thing about owning capital is that once you own enough no labor is necesary on your part to make a continued proffit."

Ownership, and not labor, is the path to success under capitalism. Every billionair achieved their wealth through being the bridge owner.

By abolishing capitalism indo not expect, or even desire, absolute equality. But by eliminating private ownership of capital (that bridge) I can ensure that no one, no matter how much they work, can dominate others."

Would you dispute that the more wealthy a person is, the more capital they possess, the more powerful they are. If all capital, like that bridge, was community owned then that family, as members of the community, would cross unmolested. 

The problem with lib right is your solution to assholes is to weaken or destroy the only institution where the people have any say, the government. I can at least vote for my representatives in the state, flawed as that system is. I cannot vote for my CEO or shift manager. Capitalism is inherently hierarchical, meaning that it will tend towards concentration. This allows bad people to monopolize power and wield it against the general welfare. We can see this happening in the world today and there is no reason to assume that eliminating or weakening government will make it any better.

The bridge owner is not ""agressing"" against the family, the eruption is totally outside his control.

Thus, lib right theoretically allows slavery (or at least permanent indentured servitude) bu default.

The bigger problem with the NAP though, is what I said before. It seems reasonable on the surface because it is.

This means that every time their conditioning of an individual fails, it fails disastrously (as with Anakin, Revan, etc.).

And from the libleft the Jedi get an unwillingness to just do it.

Government programs intended to help the poor are means tested, paradoxically this means in most cases that they created an incentive not to pursue a legal income (making crime the only real means of improving ones standard of living). 

This has meant that black communities tend to have more organized crime because of these issues, this has in turn resulted in greater policing of these areas. Because the police spend more time looking for black criminals, they tend to find more of them. 

The type of crime also matters, most black criminals were imprisoned for nonviolent drug offenses (the true purpose of the war on drugs, by the way). Black suspects are more likely to be convicted and serve longer sentences on average than white defendants when controlling for evidence and type of crime. These factors skew the prison population towards more black prisoners.

It's also important to note that white people tend to commit different types of crime from black people. White crime is typically financial in nature, what we normally refer to as ""white collar"" crime. These crimes often come with relatively short prison sentences (if at all) and fines. This is a direct result of class, middle and upper class people dont join gangs, deal drugs or steal candy bars, they buy drugs, launder money and skim proffits.
