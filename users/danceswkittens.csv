unpopularopinion,ff88xei,t3_eru6be,1579669457.0,"I agree. Ive seen shirts that say stuff like ""no sleep!"" ""Work hard - no time for sleep"" and while i get the sentiment of working hard to acheive your goals ppl need sleep too.  this grind till you die attitude if frankly.... exhausting."
AmItheAsshole,feytq0c,t3_eqtevd,1579450384.0,"I wanna say NAH bc your sis was so young and from my perspective that environment can be so brain washing. She truly thought she was doing the right thing and now that she is outside of that bubble she was raised in she can see the error of her ways. This is no way erases the hardship you faced. You every right to feel the way do and if its not the right time for you to reconcile with her than thats all there is too say. If the time never comes where you feel comfortable with that.. well thats ok too.
But i also want to say NTA deaming her the asshole because regardless of her very skewed perspective that is still a very shitty mindset."

AskReddit,fe6d7ft,t1_fe637p1,1578887489.0,"similar thing happed to me with my ex in my car in a small empty parking lot. We'd just hot boxed in the back seat and had enough weed in the car to get a pretty charge. Mid stroke he looks up and sees a cop car parked perpendicularly right behind us. Of course were panicking and like 80% naked. So we try to get dressed and do something... anything.. with the weed. Didnt want to switch seats or open the door obviously. So we sat there scared as hell for 10 mins (felt like an eternity) and then the cop drove off.
It was our lucky day i guess but definitely killed the mood"
LifeProTips,fe6bcwj,t1_fe62rcj,1578886105.0,Exactly she definitely sparked my love of baking when i found her some years back. And im very much a type A - Monica Geller type lol so i realllly appreciate all she does!
LifeProTips,fe60j6a,t3_enup9y,1578879071.0,"Why does this bother people so much? Most blogs have a jump to recipe link at the top of their page. Otherwise it really doesnt take much effort to scroll. And there are a few bloggers i love (eg: recipe tin eats, half baked harvest, sallys baking addiction, damn delicious) and enjoy reading their posts.
Sally's adds great commentary on the hows and whys of what shes baking. recipetin always adds a picture of her cute dog Dozer."

AmItheAsshole,fdzk5gc,t3_en9qnq,1578790960.0,"Hmm i think NTA. It was a kind gesture that would have saved the bride some money. Awesome!
 i can understand you feeling bummed after realizing you wont have apart in planning some of the wedding. Or just being involved in general.
I agree with the yta judgments in the sense that this isnt your wedding and you should just drop it. Honestly DIL is probably feeling like she has little/no control over her day and its easier to dismiss your help than her mothers."

AmItheAsshole,fdtnr61,t3_en0xo2,1578719446.0,NTA NTA your baby and YOUR health are the most important thing in this scenario. I personally prefer to not have a male doctor after a bad experience with one as a teen. but if i feel its an emergency i will take whatever medical professional available. Your partner needs to seek therapy ASAP.
ThriftStoreHauls,fdtjyxt,t3_emzoxb,1578717851.0,Wow that is insanely gorgeous if only i had the 525 for the cherish link you shared.

AmItheAsshole,fdkhxah,t3_eliwde,1578504212.0,NTA i hate this so. My coworkers have never given me lip about not bringing home made. But its clearly expected. While They all have their wives cook or bring grocery store platters.

AmItheAsshole,fdfqtdr,t3_ekzr0b,1578367968.0,I hate that theyre not teaching this in the school system earlier. I had the course in 5th grade. I was 9 y/o. One of the girls in my class already had her period and the rest of us followed suit the year or two after. Are they waiting for their female students to have already learned the hard way years prior....

Ive always managed to live near a body of water so im lucky enough to enjoy the sound of natural running water daily. And oddly enough the one office sound i can bare is keyboard typing lol
AmItheAsshole,fcz1vyi,t3_ejkij2,1578091999.0,"NTA its very concerning that they didnt call you or speak to you in prior consultations. If they would do this i cant imagine what other procedures theyre comfortable doing without approval.
Im sure they were trying to ease your mind with their rebuttals but it definitely came off as a lack of understanding."
unpopularopinion,fcybgzw,t1_fcxcl0o,1578077672.0,"I personally think youre attractive and dont see this ""weight issue"" everyone's discussing. But im 5'2 and 218lbs so maybe my view is skewed. And a little weight id better for snuggles anyways lol"

konmari,fcwi6fw,t3_ej6ff4,1578026274.0,I only decanter (decant?) My hand and dish soaps. Also my detergent pods i move to a more aesthetically pleasing container. Ive been saving some of my prettier candle jars to eventually put my lotions and what nots in
misophonia,fcv3moo,t3_eivm0g,1577993960.0,"Youre not alone. Sometimes its hard for my ""triggers"" to not be made abundantly clear bc of my reaction to them. But my fear is that people will go out of their way to click their pens and tap their fingers to irritate me for a good laugh or whatever. My parents never, to this day, took me seriously. My dad always pops his gum and my mom twirls her hair (the sight and the sound drive me mental). When ever id ask them to stop they would chew harder or twirl more."

unpopularopinion,fc742am,t3_egehar,1577496980.0,"I say this all of the time! Im the only 20 something at my job everyone else in in there 60s or older. I hear very often ""back in my day you could leave your doors unlocked and not have to worry"" type of statements. The level of concern should be the same.
Another thing to keep in mind, with the very specific targeted marketing we see daily, the news and info we come acrods is generally very biased to our opinion and point of view."
unpopularopinion,fc70snc,t1_fc6edox,1577494493.0,"While i have heard that reasoning many times before that is not the case for me. I have no concerns of us splitting. Lets face it if we want out well do it, married or not. If you asked me 2 years ago, I knew id like to marry him but it felt too soon for me. Couldnt explain it much further than a feeling. But asking me today, weve discussed it plenty of times and were ready for that step. Just waiting on him to pop the question :)
However im also content with where our relationship is now."
unpopularopinion,fc6dvsd,t1_fc690a0,1577478256.0,I meant more like 2 years in i would consider that a serious relationship. New but still serious. i would agree its a hasty move to be married by that point.
unpopularopinion,fc67991,t1_fc65uxr,1577473887.0,"Seriously? After just 2 years your annoyed? 2 years is a long time, yes, but if you consider a 60-80 year marriage, thats still a very new relationship.
Also i wouldnt call it a declaration of ""best-friendship"". If youre truly committed then you are regardless of the paperwork.
Ive been in my relationship for 4 years. We intend to marry but im not going to rush that or an engagement just bc we should be legal bound by now."
LifeProTips,fc2yulu,t3_efpsu3,1577377591.0,"I dont know how effective this would be at my 3rd floor apartment. But when im in a house i will definitely use this idea. I ordered a dining table set from wayfair last year came shipped in 2 large boxes. 6 days in a row... They would pull up in their truck, sit in the parking lot for 5 mins, then drive off and say i wasnt home. The leasing office wouldnt hold it bc the boxes were too big. There was someone home each day we called USPS probably 8 different times. Offered to help the guys/girls carry it up the stairs.

These drivers are completely lazy. Like dont do that job if you dont want to do that job!"
LifeProTips,fbzqmv5,t1_fbz77m6,1577256643.0,"So many holiday bdays here. Im the 29th. 3 days after xmas 3 days before new years. Youve all hit the nail on the head. It only took 1 party attempt for my mom to realize kids wouldnt show bc theyre out of town. Im an only child so thigs like that really enforced my loneliness.
Fortunately my mother and gma always made it a point to get me a seperate gift but often it was wrapped in xmas themed paper.
And for some reason our large family get together always fell on my bday so it was kind of disappointing watching other kids opening presents on ""my day""."
