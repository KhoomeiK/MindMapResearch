sex,fewy1yh,t1_few6qnh,1579421250.0,"I tend to have stronger orgasms when masturbating if I let myself moan (as a woman). 

I never really understood the argument of ‚Äúdudes had to be quiet to masturbate so they wouldn‚Äôt get caught‚Äù - do people think women just moan loudly regardless? There‚Äôs a time and place to be discreet, for both men and women! I love when my partner is vocal during sex, such a huge turn on"

I always hate when people ask if you like cats or dogs

*Ew cats kill them*

People are so annoying"
todayilearned,fen5vvt,t1_femuljg,1579277661.0,Yes THANK you. I remembered reading about this fairly recently about how the brother is credited and I was mad because it was the wife that was suspicious first and had to convince the brother to read it! SHE is the one that led them!

It sounded strange to say that I was one of the worst things that happened to me but I‚Äôm glad to know you felt that way too. Mine wasn‚Äôt a clean break either and it was unfortunately something that I had to find out on my own and ask about, which kind of made extra worse for me. Blech. 

Thanks again for taking the time to read and write and share with me."
