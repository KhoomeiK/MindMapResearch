They knocked me out. They shot me with an IV of white liquid (I forget the name) and before I could count back from 10 I was out.

I woke up an hour later a little fuzzy but nothing like those funny videos you see that go viral.

They packed the back of my mouth with gauze because it's going to continue to bleed for a while. For me personally I think it took like a day maybe a day and half before it stopped.

They are going to give you a syringe and you are going to have to shoot Listerine in the holes until they heal. For me it took like three weeks to completely heal. I did it after every meal. It's annoying as fuck and shits going to get stuck in there all the time but it's worth it.

It's was always in the back of my mind and stressed me out. It was worth it."

atheism,fe3mhma,t3_enmk6q,1578850626.0,"I'm not religious and think it's bogus but saying you get nothing in return is kind of not true. Also, 10% is a suggestion it's not like they ask to see your pay stubs and send you a monthly bill.

The church (if a good one) gives you family, community, a support system in trying times, they provide people with food, shelter, a since of everything is going to be okay, they ease your mind when it comes to death, and triggers the same in your brain as drugs.

I feel like church is our new modern version of tribes. Before modern times we use to live in tribes of 75 to 150 people max which isn't a thing anymore, obviously. I think that sense of community does something to us subconsciously.

I agree with you religion is a scam but the points your bring up in your argument doesn't work for me. I believe churches if ran correctly by good people are great for most communities."

My thing with this is the amount of steps he was able to take. If he caught that ball took one step and then went out of bounds, catch. 

But him taking three steps with the ball not moving in his hands is some how not a caught? That doesn't make sense to me. Seems like bs.

Edit: I will give you the benefit of the doubt when you watch it in normal speed it does look  incomplete-ish it is a pretty fast play. 

However, the officials never called incomplete pass during the play, you can't see the ball from the angle which the camera was watching the play, and when you take in the context of the slow mo were he has full possession of the ball the whole time. That was a fumble and a terrible call.

I would be fine with an incomplete pass if the ball moved at all but once it hits that guy's hands it was like it was glued in there until it got knocked out. That call completely changed the game.
