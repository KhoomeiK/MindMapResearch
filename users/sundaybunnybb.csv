AmItheAsshole,ffbg826,t1_ffbasnn,1579763909.0,"She’s the one who tells me everything in the relationship, I don’t ask or stick my nose in she just tells me everything so it’s kinda hard to not have something to say about it, and I guess I am a bad person because I don’t regret what I did honestly, me and her are best friends still, and she’s friends with him, it’s not like I’m forcing him out of her life I just worry for her as a sister as she gets into bad friendships and relationships, I get it, it was wrong to manipulate her into doing it and I’ll try to be weary on how i deal with these things"
AmItheAsshole,ffbfad8,t1_ffbey9b,1579762773.0,Thanks for your opinion but you gotta chill dude I’m not “very young and immature” nor am I “stuck in my own ego” that’s just what’s happened with people I’ve met so like it or not I’m telling the truth on my experiences and you can’t prove me wrong on that
AmItheAsshole,ffbf3tl,t1_ffbckvp,1579762556.0,"Actually after that me and her talked just like always, she wouldn’t get mad at me for something as trivial as that and I know I shouldn’t have forced her I was just mad, how does threatening her just “count as immaturity”? That’s like the idiotic saying “boys will be boys”what he said sounds like he has some mental issues to me, and one day when she’s married to a good person we will barely remember him, I know it wasn’t a very good idea but I’m happy with the choice I made and will be later on"
AmItheAsshole,ffb9i16,t1_ffb9a1c,1579756169.0,"I have told her about the problems calmly many times, she brushes them off and I didn’t want them in a relationship anymore because all that happened in 3 months, also in the reasons he threatened her! I know it’s unlikely they would get married but he has anger issues and by the way he threatened her if they did get married it sounds like she would be the victim of domestic abuse, he said as I wrote “if we get in a fight and I walk away *for your safety* let me walk away” he pretty much said he would hurt her if she followed him, that’s extremely toxic and she doesn’t need to be near that in my opinion"
AmItheAsshole,ffb90ul,t1_ffb8s46,1579755604.0,"I kinda did the first one, it was the heat of the moment and I was mad, she never listened to the reasons I’ve told her numerous times but she’s just said “he’s a good person I love him!” So my last resort was to threaten our friendship over him (not the right call I know but I didn’t know what else to do) 

Edit: and I told her along with threatening our friendship why I knew he wasn’t good"

foshelter,ffavt3u,t1_ffatctw,1579745652.0,"I already have 60 dwellers with no room for more, and I’m not gonna get rid of a lot of fighters for pregnancy’s that’s will last a long time because I’ll have to get room for them, pregnant women just run from everything so they’re useless until I have space for children, they’ll just have to suck it up til they’re at top of the level lol"

Christianity,ff41h5y,t1_ff36t0q,1579553483.0,"Well God actually nether confirms or denies animals in heaven, he gives hints just like other things like the rapture, he doesn’t say it exactly but says what will happen eventually with hints, and God gave us free will so God lets us assume and guess, and just because he is silent on it doesn’t mean I’m wrong it’s just way harder to tell who’s right, and at the end of the day it’s just a girl hoping she can see her childhood dog again, it’s not like I’m trying to summon a demon or anything like that this is an innocent wish that I have and believe that won’t falter the chance of anyone going to heaven"

Christianity,ff40qlh,t1_ff3hku4,1579553023.0,"Well we apparently have total opposite opinions, “some people” actually enjoy having animals in their lives and don’t believe they should be killed by humans for sport or entertainment purposes, animals actually have lives, they have children and teach them, they run around playing with friends, and humans have to cut down their trees, and shoot them for fun, your acting like I’m completely close minded but I’ve tried seeing it your way, I just can’t because I have so much compassion for animals and I doubt you ever have or ever will try see it my way"

I can’t believe she thinks rabbits, hamsters or anything deserves that horrible cage, she also thinks it’s funny when it climbs the cage even after I told her it was because of stress she said “no it’s not he’s perfectly happy here!” I only saw a wheel a hide house and a chew toy with at most 2 inches, she is the kind of person Victoria would say not to be in every way when it comes to hamsters sadly, and it’s a serian named Hershey 😔 she’s my best friend but I feel horrible for it"
