I don’t know how Canadians would take this, but meeting one around here feels pretty much like meeting someone from another state.  Just...normal.

The one exception would probably be someone from Quebec.  While there lots of Canadians intermingled in American culture, I’ve only ever met a handful, personally, who spoke French or with a French accent."

I had braces, both my sisters did, as did our three sons, and the only time any of us were uncomfortable or sore were on the days our orthodontists made changes to the braces—tightening them, adjusting them, changing the direction(s) of tension, adding rubber bands, or whatever.  Even then it doesn’t generally hurt at the time, but might get sore a bit later.  Nothing *extraordinarily* painful.  In our experiences and for most people I’ve known, painful enough for a Tylenol and *maybe* a preference for a dinner of soup that day instead of a burger or steak, but nothing horrendous and not for long.  

The only exception—sort of—is that one of our kids did have to wear a head brace at night for awhile that attached to his braces and was part of his straightening.  He hated that head brace, no question, but it wasn’t as much *painful* as it was uncomfortable.  You can imagine trying to sleep well in a head brace.  BUT...he’d tell you that the gorgeous, wide, white Pepsodent smile he has today was worth every restless night!

FYI: eating an apple before a braces adjustment helps.  Something about the pectin.  Also, you can take a Tylenol in the waiting room to get a jump on discomfort if tightening really bothers you."
ArtHistory,ff4c5ic,t3_ep6tvv,1579560149.0,"<<* Impressionists try to do exactly what the title entails, give you and impression of what you're seeing. The iconography was contemporary life, and the paintings had a sort of hazy quality to them because of the quick, sloppy brush strokes. The goal was to capture the moment.*>>

Keeping in mind that this is coming from someone who appreciates art in a “this makes my heart sing” or “that doesn’t speak to me” way than any deep familiarity with artists or their techniques, influences, genres, etc., I have a question.  In the above quote, you seemed to be saying—if I understood correctly—that the “hazy quality” and “quick, sloppy brush strokes” and, I assume, the quality that I’ll call...the simplicity?...of Impressionism are products of the goal to “capture the moment.”  You also said something about impressionists focusing on ordinary, everyday life.  This made me think of what many photographers do in terms of trying to catch the *perfect shot*—a tiny slice of everyday life that manages to tell a story that will go to the heart of anyone who sees it.  Not a long, studied still life or intricately arranged and detailed portrait, but a snapshot of life *as it’s being lived*.  (Keep with me here, I do have a question).  

The thing is, photography wasn’t available—and certainly not widely or easily available—to truly “capture a moment” until the 20th century.  And yes, it’s a different art medium altogether, I realize, but this entire train of thought still made me wonder:   Did Impressionism basically arise out of the same **goals** as photography?  The attempt in art to develop new ways to quickly outline a subject and develop ways to *very quickly* convey a picture of life in the moment, developing techniques and short cuts, perhaps, for lack of a better term, in order to get all the major details as they occurred?  Which would also be the basis of the movement you feel with Impressionist world?  I could be way off base, but when I read your explanations to another poster, this is what went through my mind.

Traditional artists spent great amounts of time on their paintings.  Models.  Still lifes.  Multiple sketches.  Perfect lighting.  All things that would have prohibited a goal of immediacy.  So was Impressionism the answer to that?

AmItheAsshole,feubrud,t1_fernmpy,1579385045.0,"Did you not get the part where they *bring the dander with them to me*?   There’s just **no** work-around for these levels of reactions, and you should know that better than anyone here if you worked for an allergist.  If it were a type of food allergen, like peanut butter or shellfish, no problem...I can just not eat it.   But as you obviously well know, dander is *everywhere* in the house and on the people who live there.  I’ve tried meds.  Desensitizing shots won’t work with whatever type of allergy to cats that I have, or I’d have taken them.  There’s nothing else I can do.

As I said, I truly love cats, and **hate** this allergy!!   I wish things were different!!  I wish allergy shots or medications or *something* would work, but they don’t.  So to me, insisting on putting up this kind of insurmountable barrier between a mom (or dad or sibling) and their son/brother is avoidable and it’s wrong.  Not only that, but you plan to continue it with more cats in future.  Really?!?  I’m sorry, but there’s just all kinds of heartless in that.  We’re a very close, loving family, and this would be nothing less than intentionally putting a wall between us.

For the record, I’d feel the exact same way *if I were immuno-fine and it was my MIL who had my allergy to cats*.   No way would I want this kind of impossible barrier between my husband and his mom or dad (not to mention between grandparents and grandchildren).

Can’t even believe this discussion.  You asked if you’re T A.  I gave my vote and explained it.  I’m sorry you disagree, but my vote remains YTA *assuming your MIL really does have the allergy she claims and isn’t just a jerk.* *

*This is my perspective from *my* reality.  Can’t speak for your SO’s mom.  Is she lying?  Maybe, but why?  Is she exaggerating?  Possibly, or maybe she has different reactions to different breeds.  Either way, meds or possibly allergy shots can sometimes help with help some people.  I do think she should make sure — if she hasn’t already — that there’s not something which could mitigate her reactions.  Just be aware that she *may truly be* that allergic to your cat, and these intervention meds *may not* work."
AmItheAsshole,feqx7cz,t3_eqbzw3,1579347104.0,"YTA if his mom really does have serious cat allergies.  I don’t know if she does or not, but I do, and some of your premises are incorrect about cat allergens.   Let’s say this we’re my son.  For one thing, you couldn’t simply let someone else babysit the cat on nights I’m invited over b/c once the cat has lived there, his dander has spread from one end of your house to the other whether he’s actually present or not.  It will also be brought to my house when you visit...in your clothes, coats, purses, bags, skin, etc.   

When my sweet mom was dying, various family members were staying with her at different times to help out.  One relative had a cat, which *never* came with her.  Except it came on her clothes, PJs, etc.  First time I spent the night in the same guest bedroom she had used, my allergies went nuts!  Strong allergies just *react*.  It’s what they do.  I walked in a carpet store once, years back, and didn’t even get to the information desk before my eyes started itching terribly.  I asked, “Do you by any chance have a cat in the store?!?”  Oh, yes.  They did.  And I knew that fast and had to leave.

And the symptoms for me don’t just go away.  Starts with a tickle in the top-back of my throat.  Then the eyes start itching.  And itching.  And itching.  Forever.  Then the sneezing.  The sinuses.  The asthma.  My eyes can look like the worst, reddest case of pink-eye you’ve ever seen within 30 minutes and then I. Can’t. Breathe!  And even if I leave, it can still impact me all night, being unable to breathe, and with red eyes like sandpaper for days.   How bad the attack will be all depends on the cat.  I’m allergic to *all cats*, BUT some give me much stronger reactions much quicker than others.  No clue why.  Maybe it’s whether they’re single or double coated?  Breed?  Sadly, though, every breed affects me within two hours if not 30 seconds.😢

My point is that it would be my worst nightmare for our sons to have any cats, because I’m just *that* allergic to them.  Wish it weren’t true, cuz I love kitties to bits, but this has been my life since I was 14.  So yeah, cats really can be **that** hard for some people."

Who are these idiots who do this stuff?!?"

BetterEveryLoop,fem1zpx,t3_eoluro,1579237145.0,"Legit question:  what would’ve happened if the guy in the white shorts—after being slammed by the drop-kick—had hit the concrete so hard that he died?

I mean, I applaud the two guys for intervening on behalf of the one being beaten, but I also wonder how it would likely play out legally when a rescue results in a death."

I remember when our twins were freshmen in college, and at that time, they even felt a gap with girls who were still seniors in h.s.   It wasn’t about the age(s).  It was about all the stuff you go through, the experiences, the rapid independence in such a short period of time that first year at university.  For a brief period of time, that one year is a LOT.  Kind of the same thing with your sister’s situation."
AmItheAsshole,feiu2gg,t3_ep9ovz,1579147225.0,"NTA, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t a risky move on your part.  With many bosses (and in many states) you’d be lucky to come back employed.  

If that’s not a worry, though, then by all means teach him a lesson."
AmItheAsshole,feisz6d,t3_ep6ary,1579146415.0,"I’m from Dallas, and every Chinese restaurant I’ve ever been to serves on small platters that are separate from your plate, but I’ve never seen anyone just take from someone else’s order unless sharing was planned as part of the ordering."

And FWIW, I’d make it a finished thing.  In other words, she may start negotiating on what she’ll cover if only you’ll come, and I would shut down the haggling politely.  More than likely, you’d still end up conceding to an amount that’s more than you want to spend.

“I really just can’t now; I’m so sorry” should be respected."
AmItheAsshole,feiritb,t3_eo858m,1579145387.0,"I’ve been around a few celebs and sports stars, and my experience is that they’re able to do stuff just like everyone else.  They get amazingly good at blending in, and also very good at shutting down attention.  I’d have had any of the ones I’ve known at a wedding with no worries."
