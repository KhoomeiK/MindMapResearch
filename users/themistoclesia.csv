I had braces, both my sisters did, as did our three sons, and the only time any of us were uncomfortable or sore were on the days our orthodontists made changes to the braces‚Äîtightening them, adjusting them, changing the direction(s) of tension, adding rubber bands, or whatever.  Even then it doesn‚Äôt generally hurt at the time, but might get sore a bit later.  Nothing *extraordinarily* painful.  In our experiences and for most people I‚Äôve known, painful enough for a Tylenol and *maybe* a preference for a dinner of soup that day instead of a burger or steak, but nothing horrendous and not for long.  

The only exception‚Äîsort of‚Äîis that one of our kids did have to wear a head brace at night for awhile that attached to his braces and was part of his straightening.  He hated that head brace, no question, but it wasn‚Äôt as much *painful* as it was uncomfortable.  You can imagine trying to sleep well in a head brace.  BUT...he‚Äôd tell you that the gorgeous, wide, white Pepsodent smile he has today was worth every restless night!

FYI: eating an apple before a braces adjustment helps.  Something about the pectin.  Also, you can take a Tylenol in the waiting room to get a jump on discomfort if tightening really bothers you."
ArtHistory,ff4c5ic,t3_ep6tvv,1579560149.0,"<<* Impressionists try to do exactly what the title entails, give you and impression of what you're seeing. The iconography was contemporary life, and the paintings had a sort of hazy quality to them because of the quick, sloppy brush strokes. The goal was to capture the moment.*>>

Keeping in mind that this is coming from someone who appreciates art in a ‚Äúthis makes my heart sing‚Äù or ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt speak to me‚Äù way than any deep familiarity with artists or their techniques, influences, genres, etc., I have a question.  In the above quote, you seemed to be saying‚Äîif I understood correctly‚Äîthat the ‚Äúhazy quality‚Äù and ‚Äúquick, sloppy brush strokes‚Äù and, I assume, the quality that I‚Äôll call...the simplicity?...of Impressionism are products of the goal to ‚Äúcapture the moment.‚Äù  You also said something about impressionists focusing on ordinary, everyday life.  This made me think of what many photographers do in terms of trying to catch the *perfect shot*‚Äîa tiny slice of everyday life that manages to tell a story that will go to the heart of anyone who sees it.  Not a long, studied still life or intricately arranged and detailed portrait, but a snapshot of life *as it‚Äôs being lived*.  (Keep with me here, I do have a question).  

The thing is, photography wasn‚Äôt available‚Äîand certainly not widely or easily available‚Äîto truly ‚Äúcapture a moment‚Äù until the 20th century.  And yes, it‚Äôs a different art medium altogether, I realize, but this entire train of thought still made me wonder:   Did Impressionism basically arise out of the same **goals** as photography?  The attempt in art to develop new ways to quickly outline a subject and develop ways to *very quickly* convey a picture of life in the moment, developing techniques and short cuts, perhaps, for lack of a better term, in order to get all the major details as they occurred?  Which would also be the basis of the movement you feel with Impressionist world?  I could be way off base, but when I read your explanations to another poster, this is what went through my mind.

Traditional artists spent great amounts of time on their paintings.  Models.  Still lifes.  Multiple sketches.  Perfect lighting.  All things that would have prohibited a goal of immediacy.  So was Impressionism the answer to that?

There‚Äôs just **no** work-around for these levels of reactions, and you should know that better than anyone here if you worked for an allergist.  If it were a type of food allergen, like peanut butter or shellfish, no problem...I can just not eat it.   But as you obviously well know, dander is *everywhere* in the house and on the people who live there.  I‚Äôve tried meds.  Desensitizing shots won‚Äôt work with whatever type of allergy to cats that I have, or I‚Äôd have taken them.  There‚Äôs nothing else I can do.

As I said, I truly love cats, and **hate** this allergy!!   I wish things were different!!  I wish allergy shots or medications or *something* would work, but they don‚Äôt.  So to me, insisting on putting up this kind of insurmountable barrier between a mom (or dad or sibling) and their son/brother is avoidable and it‚Äôs wrong.  Not only that, but you plan to continue it with more cats in future.  Really?!?  I‚Äôm sorry, but there‚Äôs just all kinds of heartless in that.  We‚Äôre a very close, loving family, and this would be nothing less than intentionally putting a wall between us.

For the record, I‚Äôd feel the exact same way *if I were immuno-fine and it was my MIL who had my allergy to cats*.   No way would I want this kind of impossible barrier between my husband and his mom or dad (not to mention between grandparents and grandchildren).

Can‚Äôt even believe this discussion.  You asked if you‚Äôre T A.  I gave my vote and explained it.  I‚Äôm sorry you disagree, but my vote remains YTA *assuming your MIL really does have the allergy she claims and isn‚Äôt just a jerk.* *

*This is my perspective from *my* reality.  Can‚Äôt speak for your SO‚Äôs mom.  Is she lying?  Maybe, but why?  Is she exaggerating?  Possibly, or maybe she has different reactions to different breeds.  Either way, meds or possibly allergy shots can sometimes help with help some people.  I do think she should make sure ‚Äî if she hasn‚Äôt already ‚Äî that there‚Äôs not something which could mitigate her reactions.

I don‚Äôt know if she does or not, but I do, and some of your premises are incorrect about cat allergens.   Let‚Äôs say this we‚Äôre my son.  For one thing, you couldn‚Äôt simply let someone else babysit the cat on nights I‚Äôm invited over b/c once the cat has lived there, his dander has spread from one end of your house to the other whether he‚Äôs actually present or not.  It will also be brought to my house when you visit...in your clothes, coats, purses, bags, skin, etc.   

When my sweet mom was dying, various family members were staying with her at different times to help out.  One relative had a cat, which *never* came with her.  Except it came on her clothes, PJs, etc.  First time I spent the night in the same guest bedroom she had used, my allergies went nuts!  Strong allergies just *react*.  It‚Äôs what they do.  I walked in a carpet store once, years back, and didn‚Äôt even get to the information desk before my eyes started itching terribly.  I asked, ‚ÄúDo you by any chance have a cat in the store?!?‚Äù  Oh, yes.  They did.  And I knew that fast and had to leave.

And the symptoms for me don‚Äôt just go away.  Starts with a tickle in the top-back of my throat.  Then the eyes start itching.  And itching.  And itching.  Forever.  Then the sneezing.  The sinuses.  The asthma.  My eyes can look like the worst, reddest case of pink-eye you‚Äôve ever seen within 30 minutes and then I. Can‚Äôt. Breathe!  And even if I leave, it can still impact me all night, being unable to breathe, and with red eyes like sandpaper for days.   How bad the attack will be all depends on the cat.  I‚Äôm allergic to *all cats*, BUT some give me much stronger reactions much quicker than others.  No clue why.  Maybe it‚Äôs whether they‚Äôre single or double coated?  Breed?  Sadly, though, every breed affects me within two hours if not 30 seconds.üò¢

My point is that it would be my worst nightmare for our sons to have any cats, because I‚Äôm just *that* allergic to them.  Wish it weren‚Äôt true, cuz I love kitties to bits, but this has been my life since I was 14.  So yeah, cats really can be **that** hard for some people."

You‚Äôre NTA in **one** respect:   your daughter should have let you know that she had you on speaker phone from the get-go.  

But beyond that, the gross information about *why you might be a bit late* was unnecessary, immature, gauche, crude, and a megaphone announcement to your daughter‚Äôs friends that her dad was born in a barn.  Of course she was embarrassed!

I have three **sons** who would die if they ever heard their dad or me talk like that!  Yikes!  Some things just aren‚Äôt meant to be shared.  All you had to say was, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there, but it‚Äôll be 5-10 minutes before I can leave.‚Äù   Trust me that NO ONE wants to know ANYTHING about the rest."

In fact, by bringing out the proper order when you were well through the incorrect pork and sides, they really should have comped your meal or at the very least charged you for the pork dinner *only* and given you a future comped dinner.  Charging for both??  Yikes.  Beyond tacky."

I remember when our twins were freshmen in college, and at that time, they even felt a gap with girls who were still seniors in h.s.   It wasn‚Äôt about the age(s).  It was about all the stuff you go through, the experiences, the rapid independence in such a short period of time that first year at university.  For a brief period of time, that one year is a LOT.  Kind of the same thing with your sister‚Äôs situation."

And FWIW, I‚Äôd make it a finished thing.  In other words, she may start negotiating on what she‚Äôll cover if only you‚Äôll come, and I would shut down the haggling politely.
