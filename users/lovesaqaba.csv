I brought this up briefly yesterday, but this expansion could have easily turned into a faction war as it started, then evolved into Sylvanas becoming so power hungry N'Zoth is released and 8.3's events happen in a way such that we need to enter the Shadowlands while the other NPC heroes fight off N'Zoth.

Catholics have the Vatican, Oriental Christians have Istanbul, Armenian Christians have Armenia, Muslims have Saudi Arabia. Protestants have their own system where no homeland is necessary.  
  
>It's not like Jews are one group of people, like the Kurds or Yoruba people. Jews come from all over the world, are very diverse.

>So how do they all feel like this land is their home just because the ancient Israelites lived there several thousands of years ago?  
  
Yes, the same way Assyrians want to establish a state in their own lands in Iraq as well. The Israeli Declaration of Independence does not claim sovereignty over the entirety of the Eretz, just that a Jewish State is in the region with borders to be determined.
