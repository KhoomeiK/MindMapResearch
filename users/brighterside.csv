boston,ff8267r,t1_ff71u95,1579664026.0,"> To be hanged, drawn and quartered was, from 1352, a statutory penalty in England for men convicted of high treason, although the ritual was first recorded during the reign of King Henry III (1216â€“1272). The convicted traitor was fastened to a hurdle, or wooden panel, and drawn by horse to the place of execution, where he was then hanged (almost to the point of death), emasculated, disembowelled, beheaded, and quartered (chopped into four pieces). His remains would then often be displayed in prominent places across the country, such as London Bridge, to serve as a warning of the fate of traitors.

Damn bro. A little harsh, don't you think?"

Realistically, 5-10 years if beta is reached, and that's a hypothetical assuming they had the money to keep them going. The amount of resources that goes into this game is not enough to meet its ambition.

Mark these words -- this is not a game. Just a tech demo, always has been. Always will be. I've been saying this since 2014 to people like you, people who put Chris on a pedestal. (""He can do no wrong, he wouldn't lie, he just made a mistake."") Chris lies so people like you give away their money to finance what he knows is inachievable given his company's state. So 6 years I've been warning poor saps like yourself. And I'll continue to do it regardless of the hate and downvotes because I was one of those poor few that believed once. Then I peeked under the hood like so many are afraid to do.

They spend too much in overhead, and the 'game' started on a lie.

I predict the largest class action suit in video game industry hitting this man. And people like you will be dumbstruck."

news,fdbdbwi,t1_fd9vetf,1578256242.0,"Media wouldn't specifically say WW3. That would be dumb and considered more like parody news.

They would have headline titles that are inflammatory and designed to attract emotion like fear or anger, such as: 

[Iran threatens to attack White House in 'powerful retaliation''](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7853703/Iran-threatens-attack-White-House-crushing-powerful-retaliation.html)

OK - There are those in Iran that have been 'threatening to attack the White House' for decades. Plus those threatening are usually not at the top of the decision making hierarchy.

Another thing media does is take quotes from non-officials, or those with very little political/military influence within a country, and then label that person after the country.

For example, some former aid of a general says some very angering words toward the US. Someone from Fox eats it up and says 'Iran' said this. No, it wasn't Iran, Iran is not a person, it was a person that said that. And even though they said that, that person does not represent the views of an entire military/government structure - which are actually extremely complex in nature.

War and conflict are not simple. And the media knows that and simplifies them anyway to dumb it down for population consumption, and for $."
