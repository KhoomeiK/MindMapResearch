Stand on the edge of the cliff anywhere or go to the edge platform you can get to if you keep moving on the path right of the lab entrance. Now stand with your back to the drop. Point the Rocket Launcher at your feet. Jump and immediately launch a rocket at your feet. If you do it right, you'll fly off and fal down the pit over the edge of the map. I prefer the cliff edge to the very end of the map. Towards the left of the lab entrance.

Apparently this is how I got it, albeit on accident because I unconsciously blasted a concussion shot at my feet in a panic when I was surrounded by grunts on Legendary."

He typed and hit Reply.  Satisfied that he'd spread his valuable and much asked for knowledge, he scratched his neck to get the Cheeto dust out of the hair growth there. 

He chuckled. 

""I'm just like Geralt! My beard grows in real time!"", he thought, looking longingly at the shiny new poster of Henry Cavill on the wall. ""That's so me!""

He leaned down to retrieve the can of Mountain Dew but was unable to reach it.

""Well *this* is an interesting side mission!"", he said to himself.

He painstakingly got off his gaming chair, made doubly difficult due to his size and retrieved the can from the six pack using his high density fingers.

As he sat back down, the old boiler behind him let off a loud bang.

He sighed.

It tended to do this often. It disturbed his much adored Gaming Moments^TM but it was a necessary evil. 

It got pretty cold in the basement in winters.

He reminded himself to ask his mom to get him a space heater. 

""That'll solve it!"", he said, as he put his headphones on, pulled the box of tissues closer and booted up Hentai Nazi for his millionth replay.

He cracked his knuckles and grabbed the mouse.

halo,fene2mt,t1_fen9gkg,1579282701.0,"So I looked it up a bit. Halcyons were older light cruisers first made in Mars. Due to their unique honeycomb frame structure they could take a tremendous beating and still function at some capacity (Source: Fall of Reach). Marathons were meant to be replacements for Halcyons and were longer, bigger, better armored and carried more weaponry and classified as heavy cruisers (Source: [Halo Wiki](https://www.halopedia.org/Marathon-class_heavy_cruiser))

The Pillar of Autumn was a Halcyon class cruiser that was badly damaged during the Battle for Arcadia. It was then decommissioned and put into long term storage. It was selected by Halsey for Operation: Red Flag due to the afore mentioned sturdy structure. It was then upgraded with the latest in human tech and weaponry including two MAC Cannons and hundreds of Archer missiles, plus many meters of Titanium A battleplate and *two* AIs! All these modifications were so extensive that they transformed the Autumn from a Halcyon class cruiser to something else entirely. It had become meaner, leaner and could take a beating and dish it back! The Autumn was literally one of a kind and became the template for the Autumn class heavy cruisers made by humanity after the war. (Source: Fall of Reach, [Halo Wiki_1](https://www.halopedia.org/UNSC_Pillar_of_Autumn), [Halo Wiki_2](https://www.halopedia.org/Autumn-class_heavy_cruiser))
