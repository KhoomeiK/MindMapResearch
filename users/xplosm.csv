He knows where you live, that sucks but if you open a police report he will be on the scope. The police would pay him a visit and he won't dare to do anything to you.

If (and only if) he does escalate, there will be a report and it will be easier to press charges and convict him. Your safety and others' is no joke and it shouldn't be left to chance. If you do nothing you put yourself and others in danger.

You don't have to do anything alone. Ask your folks, your grandma, an older and trustworthy friend, a teacher, a counselor. You have options. Don't leave your part to chances and apathy. Help make he world a better place. You are young but you make a difference.

The kid is a bully and very successful at that. My recommendation is to work on yourself and how you handle these trolls. He won't be the last one. He was just the first who got under your skin.

You reacted and he fed on it. With these kinds of shit stains you have to be smarter and be completely stoic. You need to gray rock the shit out of them so they get bored and move on to their next victim. Yes. You were his victim. You reacted, you read the messages, reacted to the abuse, blocked, you did everything he wanted. Even when blocking you sent the message that you read his word vomit.

The most effective way to deal with them is to not engage. Ghost them. They don't exist. Don't block them because their messages go to a void in a black hole not to your brain. No reply, no smart-ass sas or whatever. They don't feed on your misery, they move on to someone else.

You need a thicker skin and remove yourself from the abuse. It's not easy. Read ""the gift of fear"" that while targeted at victims in abusive relationships can help you identify better your clients from trolls.

I don't know of any self-respected adult that would withstand such amount of abuse, do something about it and still feel guilty.

It's not being empathetic, kind, good fellow to be treated like that and still cave in due to guilt.

Your worst enemy is yourself. Since you lacked a father figure and your mom was no good either you need lots of therapy to heal for that and relearn to love yourself. If you don't love, respect, care for yourself you think others will?

You were an easy target for that bitch. She preyed on you and had you under her thumb. That's why she was the way she was with you. That's why she was so upset when you broke it off. You were the perfect slave, the perfect minion, the one to always do as she said without questioning it. Her mother is the same. They prey on easy targets and feast on them.

Your resolution for 2020 should not be about your weigh. It should be about your mind. A healthy mind can create a healthy body but a healthy body cannot sustain a healthy mind and depression, self deprecation and doubt restart the cycle again and you regain the lost weight...

You did the most difficult part already. Don't feel guilty. The rest is healing. Start by healing your mind.
