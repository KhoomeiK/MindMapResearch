Not sure what others have commented but from the noises made by the puppy, both your dog and I think it's fine.

There are subtle differences in puppy noises and this one is not fear or pain, just some trash talk towards the elders while playing ü§ó. Don't misunderstand this as disrespect but more as rough play from the puppy, small dogs tend to play like that.

Your older dog should be trusted from my view, all older dogs do this and if you were to search on YouTube ""how mother dogs treat disrespectful puppies,"" I think you will see this type of behaviour quite a bit (playing to expose them to certain behaviours).

Your dog is clearly playing with the pup and vis versa. No foul play here in my opinion.

Here's an example of disrespectful puppies that don't like play:

Dogtraining,fdf8v5x,t1_fdf7zzr,1578356017.0,Aww that's great only one or so weeks to them sleeping without the fence I hope. Seems there won't be any problems with your dogs in terms of friendship.
reactivedogs,fdd2wd8,t3_ekkz5g,1578292593.0,"My people aggressive dog has accepted all adults (anyone above 4 ft and even the timid/scared ones) to a level that I can keep her off leash for a while now but her bane was kids.

She now lies on her back asking for pats from kids that don't seem scared and don't flail around. She still doesn't like anyone under 4ft if they run, scream or pat her a little roughly.

She has gone from an agitated dog to a completely submissive one that licks any human furiously.

I don't think I can work the kids thing out of her because of her collie X other working dog genes and probably got my personality ingrained in her too (I don't like boisterous kids from the get go).

All in all, she is completely baby sitter friendly if I need to go anywhere so long as no kids are around."

Dogtraining,fdcpw4g,t1_fdcjus4,1578281063.0,"That's great, I suspected something like that. It won't be a surprise if the young ones have similar personalities as the older one.

Dogs tend to have their natural way of teaching each other and yours doesn't seem to be a strict type. 

I encourage you to keep them together at all times from eating to sleeping.

Supervise the eating and you will soon find that the pups will act like the older one on how to treat food. 

The sleeping increases their bonding. Having an older dog is so much easier to training the younger one, just the bad habits come through too.

Good luck, and hope to see the results. Just let me know when you upload :)"

Reading the comment about your dog being social, I think it might not be a problem but I would give boundaries (not physical boundaries just make them have a place to play and a place to be calm).

dogs,fcvxzxr,t3_ej0137,1578012667.0,"There are two main reasons.

1. Age: the dog might feel unsettled after this age due to health problems related to age etc... You should spend the time you have.

2. Anxiety: a dog can start showing signs of seperation anxiety which can be caused due to the age related issues, having less time and such. But it can also be a symptom of you leaving the dog at home a lot longer than usual/ a bad experience occurred when you left. This following can lead to trashing of the house spontaneously due to the anxiety, this is a severe health risk on top of the age of your dog.

There is a third reason which is less commonly used to explain it but this is something I would interpret as well.

3. Your dog is aware of an innate health problem relating to you, dogs have been known for their keen intuition for these things. It can be mental or physical. Are you having a stressful time right now? Maybe the following is a concern for your mental wellbeing, check how you are going. The physical side would be something like an abnormal amount of chemicals in your body which they can smell. Some can detect diabetes or heart issues.

I suggest getting a check up for yourself and your dog, I'm not a professional so you need the right sources. Full scale blood tests are always good for you every 12 months anyways."

reactivedogs,fcuuuor,t1_fcu8waw,1577988993.0,"My two biggest suggestions have been made, walking + feeding. Make sure he does both with the same methods you apply (like the feeding ritual of waiting for food or something) and he can't be timid on walks and must react to Duke's reactions accordingly.

My small plot hole in what you have been telling is that you're looking for the reactive outburst behaviour instead of the more subtle signs (not saying you are doing this since I'm not there in person and this is a wild guess since I can see you have done research.

The signs I look for in a reactive dog are not bark, slight pull, stand or lunge.

They are the subtle signs before all this the ears, eyes, nose, mouth and tail. 

I want to see a dog transition quickly from ears up and glaring with mouth closed TO ears back, relaxed eyes and panting (it can be hard to tell with some dogs and the mouth panting can be negligible).

I would suggest you use a NO between the scale of when he begs vs when he reacts on walks. We used to get a thin piece of paper and roll it to make a noise distraction (we used to hit something for loud noise but found that keeping it soft and tapping the nose gently distracted both ears and eyes because the paper wasn't rolled up and blocked her view). 

You can disregard the paper if you don't feel like you know what the best way to use it is and might confuse Duke with your current method. But I still suggest the no (and possibly a small tap on the snout if he doesn't react to you). You want zero signs, just a relaxed dog.

Third thing when training indoors is the entrance. Get cousin (and all new people) to stand at the door with treats, you do your thing but the stranger rewards by throwing the treat from that same spot (while box breathing to help calm their nerves https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FJJazKtH_9I). The treat thrown is his reward for ears back and relaxed.

If he continues, be patient, you must be using a leash when training him so I suggest jerking it then relaxing tension when he sits. No need for extra tension while he is reactive and wait patiently. Stand in front of him facing cousin and have a normal conversation, when he calms down just throw a very small piece and walk a good step closer + repeat (treat pieces should get bigger).

Work this way to associate strangers with relaxation = treats. Stop the stepping closer at two steps away and make him go outside and knock again, make sure he doesn't come in until you say so which is after Duke is sitting. Repeat this process for a bit then when he mellows down, get your cousin to feed him some food from his palm (or a treat).

You should do this exercise after walking and before feeding, this is the best time to train any dog, especially if walking and feeding is hand-in-hand.

I think I've given my best advice to you, just work on door manners by making him sit away from the door and making him stay. Muzzle for safety and slip leash fort control.

Let me know if you need bigger paragraphs üòù

Edit: make sure to still say good boy as the stranger treats and ignore all unwanted behaviour after/use no (should not use together, ignoring suggested over the no's).
Remember to always be in front. I understand you've tried the treats but not after walking and at the right distance. Get him to walk past Duke and drop treats randomly too, like every 2 passes to begin with and randomising it (after the entering stuff is going well).

Milestones:

1. Walking smoothly with no tugging (with cousin)

2. Getting treats from cousin's palm

3. Not showing signs (note I'm not saying reacting) when he passes"
reactivedogs,fctk3t7,t3_eitm2w,1577946122.0,"I can see what type of behaviour you are trying to get out of a dog, but what is you and your cousin's reaction towards the dog. Your approach etc...

Have you been giving small jerks as soon as the smaller signs start or have you been giving pats as he approaches and treat him if he doesn't bark etc...

Have you two gone walking yet? Walking together is bonding together. Transfer the leash to him when he is calm and treat for maintaining the behaviour.

Your cousin needs to have a part in activities as if Duke IS his dog. Feeding, walking etc... (After the walking and introducing is smooth).

We need a few more things about how you guys act."
reactivedogs,fcp5epo,t3_ei454m,1577851029.0,"There's also a good chance that your dog is just being patient and submissive. If she gets up to meet them nicely, maybe it's her waiting for permission (by being approached by the others). This is what my dog does sometimes and other dogs too when at a dog park (just not nearly as strong as your dog's reaction though).

Even if it doesn't turn into reactive behaviour it's still annoying so get strong smelling treats, make her sit and hold the treat tightly (close to the nose so she gets distracted) as the other people approach and start walking as she sees them. 

If your dog starts walking while looking at them come head on then reward by letting go of the treat, you want to get to a point where she looks at you when you approach others (the attention on you because she may/may not get treats). 

Treat a second time when she stops looking at them to show that you want her to ignore rather than bound over to the others (you might have to work on the laying down more at the start then transfer to this part later instead of doing them together).

It can take time but you should teach it to prevent the behaviour from continuing.

You wanted to use clickers, just click as you hand the treat. I personally don't use clickers cause I don't feel like turning it into some type of regimented training and keeping it natural (just my opinion). I give pats instead of clicking.

Let me know if you don't understand what I have said."

I say (from what you have given us) that a puppy won't be a problem. Your dog's probably going to help with training by example etc...

You just need to be careful of feeding since there might be a time when they go for each other's food. The puppy will lose most likely.

But there shouldn't be a need to separate them since keeping them together will get them accustomed more.

Dogtraining,fcakuqp,t1_fc963mj,1577571196.0,"I do highly suggest it, you have to be strict for a minimum of 2-3 weeks for a puppy in this area.

The rule for a puppy is start training NOW.

If you let the pup up now and then start saying no it will be a longer process.

I would suggest you get one of those dog beds and give her a spot in the house you can easily monitor her from.

You can allow a dog onto your couch after you have established it is your couch by not allowing her to come up at the start (2 - 3 weeks). You should also keep the bed since that's her personal spot too.

I will explain why this is important:


Dogs with no boundaries at the beginning start to listen to the owner less in other aspects of the house. This can be running into rooms you might have said no to, jumping into your beds and marking it, food aggression etc...

Keep in mind these are EXTREME cases but likely. 

A dog that's always allowed to sit on the couch will come to know it as his property too, this can get troublesome with guests which can be your greatest concern. They can start invading space or worse...

I hope you understand that this is temporary so you can bring her back up in a few weeks and still tell her to get down occasionally so that she listens in the future.

Let me know what you don't understand/disagree with, although a few people have supported my previous comment.

Also let me know how it goes."
dogs,fcaj5kr,t1_fc9f30j,1577570175.0,Thanks for those ideas.
dogs,fc8g397,t3_egninb,1577534137.0,"You can try to be quick and stand between the dog and the bone but that's a recipe for a bite and escalation if you're not experienced with this (you wouldn't be asking this if you were)

I would suggest persisting with a stronger smelling treat and sounding excited. When he is distracted, just grab the bone.

You should then do a small ritual when introducing food and bones:

Make him sit while the bone is in your hand and slowly lower yourself. If he stands up for the bone then quickly get up and make him sit again. Repeat the process until he starts making eye contact instead of staring at the bone AND relaxes (basically ignoring the bone).

Eye contact is like asking for permission, the eye contact should be there since he should be looking for you to allow him to take YOUR bone (giving it straight away without making him ask is going to turn on the possessive side).

You should also walk around him slowly and depending on the reaction you follow up.

If he runs away then follow him (if you see no hope of this stopping after a few times use a leash) 

You should stop one step away and if he doesn't run then reward by saying good boy and walking away. This shows that you aren't there to take it (ideally this isn't necessary if the induction ritual works but it may take a few repetitions)



I'd like to add that you may be misreading his behaviour too, some dog breeds prefer to eat treats away in general and doesn't ever turn into aggression against their owners."
Dogtraining,fc8d24r,t3_egowgm,1577532178.0,"Unfortunately there isn't much you can do. You can try reporting it under malnutrition which is the main thing they look at alongside physical abuse for them to be taken away.

If they have a backyard then the dogs are still able to exercise and that may be their only option.

My family are not as active as he so they walk mine less frequently after I left for college. My dog still had plenty of exercise chasing the wildlife in our backyard. Infact, she lost weight with the same diet...

As long as the dogs have a yard all day to play in then it should be good. Especially since they are bred from working dogs.

I do say that 7-8 is not a good time to start this but I guess her being a smart Collie mutt helped me out.

The crate can be swapped with just a doggy bed, I didn't use a crate.

Having a designated spot that the dog owns makes it a spot to relax in.

I would also suggest closing off everything that you don't want damaged.

My view on old dogs is that you can still teach them if they have the energy to vent. You can always help an anxious dog, it just takes longer."
Dogtraining,fc85gb9,t3_egmzbx,1577527285.0,"Hate to say this but you're possibly giving too much of your love to him right now.

1. Some dogs don't like being pet unless they come to you for it and this sounds like that.

2. Second thing is to stop putting him on your bed and couch. Dogs that aren't integrated to some type of boundaries like the couch can develop this behaviour.

I would suggest some research into finding out if your dog doesn't like being pet. 

Maybe there isn't enough dog to dog time, do you take him to see other dogs at the park?

Maybe he is food possessive too.

All these factors should be looked into to prevent further aggression."
Dogtraining,fc83v3x,t3_egnjdb,1577526260.0,"I don't know where this barrier solution came from but it's probably going to do more harm than good.

1. Restraining a dog will not change what it feels inside and can escalate it

2. You don't even know if the dogs will fight

3. Puppies are meant to be put in place, mothers do this all the time. It does not result in serious injury because dogs don't tend to show prey based aggression in this unless the other fights back (the puppy can't do it's more of a snarl, but, if the puppy gets bigger with these barriers then it is difficult to integrate)

4. Do a family walk to the park, walking is bonding for dogs. Take them to socialise with more than just your house's dogs. Mine is 7 and can still play like a pup because of the socialisation we provided.


All in all: remove the gates for both you and the dog's sake.

You will find integration harder at a later age, puppies are easier to integrate.

Make corrections quickly with a long silence afterwards if the energy escalates in either dog.

I understand your feelings on keeping one safe but it's more like you segregating than protecting right now.

Edit:
One thing I would add is that there is a way to calm energetic dogs down. Mine is a border collie X mutt with other working dogs. She doesn't move a muscle in the house but is the fastest thing outside.

You have to start using segregation in the right way. I would suggest keep one gate in a small area as a spot you put the dog when the energy starts to go up.
When the dog relaxes, bring her back with good girl.

Repetition is key. (You can use ""out"" and send her outside then repeat what I said above.

To explain what I think may be the issue will be because of the extra information about K. 
K may have been fed first, feed him last and see what happens. I would suggest the victim of both aggression scenarios be fed first then then other girl and K last.

The feeding order matters in a dog's world as the first to eat is the boss and the runt last. Only do this to see if the aggression continues (not recommended if food aggression was very bad). Make sure you have them sit and wait since you have to show you are the real owner of the food and they are just being allowed to have some.

This activity should stop if it is a success first time and then teach them to eat at the same time by using the wait trick.

Feeding is essential to a pack member's rank and they should all be equal. 

Buy new toys and do the same wait game.

Apart from that you need to walk them together with you in the lead and them on your heel.

These activities are all to show they are all family.

Now to explain: I think the introduction of K's aggression may save started a Domino effect in that the other dogs now want to decide you is the next in rank.

This is a very old way of analysis in dog behaviour but it has worked.

Other activities if you are able to is: take them to the dog park, let them tire out and be worry free with the other dogs. This is what can calm a dog down since it makes them feel at home.

Dogtraining,fc6trtz,t3_egh7jy,1577489291.0,"Are you leaving the house when she is standing up? Usually if a dog is in walk mode he would think that you're leaving together but then the door closes all of a sudden and now he has to find a way to get to you, but the frustration leads to these other things.

This is a simple but time consuming thing to work on. You need your dog accustomed to the crate and you leaving.

First comes sensitisation to cues of you leaving (but you are just pretending). E.g keys, purse, door... Just make noise with all that stuff all the time and reward when he starts ignoring. To boost this process by multiple chew toys with hidden treats to distract him. 
Note that you should be ignoring all reactions and the dog until he starts relaxing. This will be a game of patience.

The toys will be used as fun and something to relax with when you are gone.

The second is crate training, I assume you just put the dog in and then shut the door. This gives the dog no time to relax and be introduced properly. 
I know you might not have done this and it could also be a crate size thing.

The way to train a dog to relax in a crate is to lure the dog in and give a treat after he sits. Don't close the door and move around a little, this is testing if the dog will start following you or not. If the dog follows, then correct it quickly and make him sit inside (put a toy in there to help but no more treats). 

When your dog starts to relax in the cage you treat him, make the crate a place to relax. This shows that a crate isn't to lock him in but for him to calm down in. 

Now the final stage, make the dog sit in the open cage and leave the room, come back in 5 second if you don't see him and reward if still in the crate. 
You can say crate time or something while giving the treats and work on him getting in himself with the command.

Work your way up to leaving your house, make sure he has sat down properly before you leave. Use the same process as above and increase distance/time. Remember the toys.

Final notes, make the crate your dog's designated spot even when you are home, the open door is for when he wants to stretch and say hi for a little time. Giving your dog a spot to stay in tells them that it's time to stay calm and not move around much.

This is the method I am familiar with for seperation anxiety."

Once you see Cooper ignore him or sit comfortably + panting then he can move slowly and stop when he starts fidgeting.

If Cooper isn't protective/nervous aggressive then you can leave them in a smaller room/put him on a leash.

Make sure he uses minimal eye contact at first and pretend that he is ignoring him when he is moving down. You have to find the starting distance yourself then work towards arms length etc...

This might seem hard but a dog never had a well manufactured house in the wild to live in (just trying to say a dog can stay outside the house).

This could be just the dog thinking your aunt is her property and shouldn't lean over her. 

Despite the fact that this sounds unfair, you need to set boundaries on your dog not allowed to sit in high places or jump on people as this is an attempt to claim the object.

(The cage training will help with this as you can tell her to go sit in there and relax with the gate open)

A dog with boundaries and quick corrections/rewards at the right time is less likely to act in a possessive way.

Use toys in which you can hide strong smelling treats for him to distract/give him something to chew.

You need to help the dog relief his irritation as we do with babies.

With this said, the comment about petting is also important.
A quick test to see if the dog hated you petting him is to hand out your fist slowly for him to smell and react to. If he licks you then give him a small pet and walk away a little, this shows him not to worry about pets and that it's for him to relax.

If he tries to bite when you go in slowly then it could just be a teething thing and you should only pet when he is distracted."
Dogtraining,fc4mylw,t3_eg5i99,1577421491.0,"You have to be strict with feeding too, this will be your timer's beginning. And use go potty when on walks.

Stop using treats and use affection (go berserk and say good potty/dog) to be known as someone who loves not someone who has food. Giving treats every time he does something good isn't necessarily a great technique.

Hope this is good enough, use another reference to confirm.

Feeding times should be researched well and maybe ask the vet if you are taking him soon."
dogs,fc435zw,t1_fc41qoz,1577405412.0,"Well that's a start, simple and less assertive activities to help prevent further development of issues.

The best trick is sit, they are in a more following mindset when you make them sit.

Sit will help with distracted walks and object protectiveness.

You make him sit then slowly place the food down, if he moves in stand up with the food quickly. Repeat as much as necessary until he gets the message that you have to tell him to eat for him to eat. The reward for this is the food and one Pat with ""good boy"" then walk off.

This is a less assertive way of teaching than what I suggested previously.

There are ways you can get the food off him by distracting him from the food with his favourite toy or something then you can grab it safely.

Overtime he will learn that the food is yours and you are giving permission to eat not letting him own the food."
Dogtraining,fc42adl,t3_eg21ev,1577404748.0,"You should train to respond while on a leash to start with, it helps with the foundation for both owner and dog.

You can teach basics like come super easily but you need to play the part with strong smelling treats and enthusiasm for their inquisitive and playful nature.

To challenge yourself do it at parks when you do it at home nicely.


The leg isn't something you can fix at home but if you take the dog to the vets I suspect there to be a lot of different tests so hope you have insurance.

I don't think it's a big deal right now as it could be a rehab thing (abuse related reflexes)"
dogs,fc41g6a,t3_eg1tue,1577404121.0,I'm curious as to how much socialisation has been done with your pup? Just want to know how he plays with others.
dogs,fc3zoh8,t1_fc3ybfw,1577402792.0,"Thanks for that, the Cesar Millan way is definately not suggested especially with older dogs but it is still effective with puppies if you have the resource.

I have trained countless dogs like this coming from an Asian background where this is common and none have bitten us (currently the most lovely and happiest dogs on the street)

Although I think I should look into your reference. Just that this method has worked for me for a long time with no side effects"
dogs,fc3yliy,t3_eg29q9,1577401982.0,"I also think that you should try the pound, it is literally their last hope and you can find some lovely dogs which just need time (which you are willing to spendi assume) the pound is a quick process.
Take your pets to see friendliness"
