I was scrolling down the screen, stopped, and clicked on the shorty pickup lines post. Running iPhone 6s, iOS 1.13.

college,fdn90d7,t3_cwufdh,1578580490.0,"When I did my fafsa, the estimated loan amount was the grant and 5500 of the unsubsidized loan. Is it possible to also take out the subsidized loan (non-need based one) to top off college tuition?

If I take out the 5500$ loan, can I then take out an additional 15000$ loan to finish the tuition? 

If not, how exactly does that work?"
