Oh I got it now! Sorry. That makes a lot of sense and I'm glad you have that experience!

>Btw why do you feel that they intimidated to talk to you? is it something specific in their behavior?

More or less.

One time I even asked a friend of mine if he thought people were able to ""receive"" the message that I like them/their company, and he said that not so much, especially since when people meet me, they can tell I'm a different person (in a good way) with a strong personality.

Which, he said, was something that made me a difficult person to approach out of fear. He went as further as to say that I seem to be ""indifferent"" when it comes to people, as opposed to people feeling like I like them, therefore it makes them not try to ""pursue"" me as well (in a friendship sense, not romantic).

Edit: Ever since this conversation I've made the effort to show more to people that I care about them and appreciate them. But that is something that happens when I become friends with people, not while we are strangers, since I don't know those new people enough to have a ""relationship"" with them yet.

Oh and I also had people tell me that the first thing, more or less, that they notice about me is that I'm extremely intelligent, so I think that may add to people feeling intimated in case they can't keep up with me.

Regarding the specific behaviour of people, there isn't anything that jumps out, beside me getting the feeling that they are listening to me but then they seem to feel ""stuck"" in what to say in response to it.

Maybe because they think that if I say 100 words, they need to also respond with 100 words as to be ""equal"" in the value that they add, but they may only have 20 words to respond back with, so they opt for silence than giving a ""less than"" response.

(This is my analysis of the situation and the physical, conversational cues, plus ""vibe shift"" I feel, that my intuition and Ni picks up)"

I can relate to this 100%. I've only had this \*not\* happen, when I was in uni and had my close group of friends. Basically all the people I met at that time, through friends or not, were people I was able to have a conversation (even if it wasn't an ""intellectual"" one, or if it was only small talk) and we had a nice back and forth going on.

>I actually had misread a new interaction with one of my closest friends.

I'm very used to his conversation style now so it doesn't feel.

Totally agree with you here as well. I don't want to avoid small talk with people, because as you so beautifully said, it can become and still be a very interesting conversation. Even in those small talks, it feels like people don't have anything to add, which bums me out even more."

relationships,fekpabp,t3_epj630,1579204786.0,"I think a better way for you to look at this is the following:

Do you feel like you're not interesting enough *for yourself*?

People are 99.99% (if not 100%) of the time, reflections of us, our inner world, the way we see ourselves, etc...

That leads me to believe (because we can all relate to this in a way or another), that most likely you are feeling like you could be living a much more interesting life in relation to your hobbies and interests.

Imagine this scenario:

Maybe you've always wanted to go salsa dancing, but are too scared to do it. Your friend just told you that she had an amazing time and will be doing weekly classes from now on. You, most likely, would feel ""boring"" in comparison to her as well, your first thought probably *wouldn't* be: ""Maybe she doesn't like me that much as a friend, since she can see how boring I am after all..."".

It would be something along the lines of: ""Damn... If only I could put my insecurities aside too and go try out salsa dancing like I've always wanted"".

It's more about you, yourself, than the other person. As it (almost) always is, for everyone.

Sidenote: I don't mean that you are ""inadequate"" btw. Your feelings are valid and it's totally understandable that you feel this way. That *doesn't* mean you are ""inadequate"" though!

You said you are an introvert, \*high five\* I'm one too, so I totally get where you are coming from, and I've noticed that whenever I'm not living up to my expectations of myself, nor engaging in hobbies or wants that I have, it really affects my self-esteem, I get in this ""everyone is more exciting, and leads more exciting lives, than me..."", thus making me retreat even more into myself.

When I should be doing the opposite and going towards those things I want, or always wanted, to do.

I do agree with other people that your partner chose you most likely because he likes you. If you are feeling really insecure about this, I think your best bet would be to talk to him. He's your partner after all, what better response can you get other than the one directly from the source?"

How do you know?
You have control over this. You can change your life and improve yourself, you just have to decide to.

My suggestion, which is what I also suggest everyone, cause I think everyone needs it, is this:
Go to therapy.

There's such a thing as: ""the right therapist *for you*"", you just need to find them and then you're golden.

I can honestly say that going to therapy was the best decision I ever made. I've always wanted to go to therapy, since I was little, cause I was always aware of how important and valuable it was.

Depression ""forced my hand"" in going to therapy sooner, and it really was a blessing in disguise.

For one, I've learnt how to *not* repress my emotions and feel them as much as I can once they come. It's still hard, especially since I haven't let go of everything that I've repressed (spoiler, it's *a lot*), nonetheless it has lead to a much more healthy state of mind, heart and soul."

Capitalism isn't the problem, PEOPLE are.

A knife is a great tool to cut your veggies to make a stew, but, someone can take that same knife and go on a killing spree... Is the knife the problem? Nah, the maniac who committed the homicides is.

She mentioned she was a *teen* girl, but made no mention of the guy's age - red flag #1.

She also mentioned she knew this guy from the internet/online, it seemed they don't know each other IRL - (*huge*) red flag #2 folks."

Does that make sense to you? Probably not. You treat a cut before it gets an infection, the list goes on...

>My doctors have always said that it can't be treated unless it's interfering with your every day life

Depression *always* interferes with your daily life. It interferes whether you can't get out of bed, whether you get insomnia, whether you just can't focus on reading for more than 2 minutes,... It always interferes. In little subtle ways, or in more extreme visible ways.

Majority of GP Doctors know shit about depression. They don't even think rationally about what they are saying and prescribing. Instead, they dangerously spread misinformation.

Edit: Oh and GP Doctors can't help with depression. Only therapists/psychologists or, IIRC, psychiatrists if you need to take medication. But majority of the time, a psychologist is what is going to help you with depression. The same way you wouldn't go to your GP Doctor to treat a cavity, you go to a dentist.

Edit 2: I'm sorry if I come across harsh, it's not ""against"" you, it's against Doctors spreading misinformation and not giving proper advice to their patients. Therefore endangering their mental health."

Regarding your doctor, are you talking about your GP? If so, GPs really aren't the best doctors to comment on that. My GP/family doctor, wanted me to take antidepressants, even after I told her that I was going to therapy and working things out with my therapist/psychologist.

I'm not against medication for depression when people really need it, but fortunately, that wasn't my case and my therapist agreed that there were still a bunch of things to try/do before even considering medication.

I know your health care there sucks but if you can, try to find a good therapist, that matches well with you (there is such as thing as the *right* therapist *for you*), which is the most important part when it comes to therapy. This is something that shouldn't be repressed and discarded, if so, it only gets way way worse, as you also described when talking about the movie Joker."
HireaWriter,fc3uplo,t3_eg1aen,1577399113.0,">Very likely there are people who doesn't give a hoot about low pay rates, has probably contacted some of these people and got to work with them. This just encourages these people to get away with their behavior regardless, and at a whole is passively encouraging people to take jobs at rule-breaking rates. 

Completely agree with this. I think that's also one of the ""guidelines"" in this sub, for writers to not accept basically ""slave labour"" rates, because it messes up the rates of every other writer. Since people get accostumed to having the work done for way less.

I do understand that most people who accept those rates are probably people living in countries where that rate is above their average pay but it still doesn't help *anyone*, to accept them."

That's not true though. Depression isn't a ""one size fits all"" kind of thing. Plus, there is such a thing as ""high-functioning depression"".

You can have depression and still ""do basic shit"". I would even go as far as to say that *majority* of people dealing with depression do, in fact, ""basic shit"". Perpetuating the idea that depression is only when people hibernate in their bed, in a dark room, doing nothing, is not helpful at all."
