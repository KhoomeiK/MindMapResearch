UIUC,ff7y87l,t1_ff6sh10,1579661197.0,i’m sorry about your little guy:( hanging old cd’s from trees and stuff in the surrounding area can reflect the light from the sun and deter birds of prey! (don’t use mirrors- you can accidentally start a fire)
UIUC,ff7xw2f,t1_ff7tqk5,1579660966.0,probably partly this and partly it’s very used to humans if it’s territory is on the campus(: I work with a red tailed hawk and he is very comfortable with me but other people are a big no even on very cold days (were at the beginning of training so it’s something we’re working on!)
cats,fep7svc,t3_eq3gxo,1579314061.0,my pups name is sora!! looks like a cute little guy(:
dadswhodidnotwantpets,fdnb2gv,t1_fdmqv9n,1578581914.0,good to know that it works!! i’m still a bit nervous that something would happen while we weren’t home as my sisters cat is notorious for doing things he knows is wrong when he thinks no one is looking. i’m sure it varies from cat to cat though. thanks for the advice!(:
dadswhodidnotwantpets,fdnavci,t1_fdna2bu,1578581787.0,i don’t think they were implying they were letting the beardie and cat play together..
dadswhodidnotwantpets,fdm473t,t1_fdlolqs,1578539389.0,do the cats not care about the beardie?? i want a cat of my own but am so worried they will try and harm my beardie because of natural hunting instincts (my dog absolutely adores her though!)
dogs,fcn6qdz,t3_ehu469,1577804717.0,"I tried to login with facebook but just ended up in a cycle of opening facebook and approving, and the app not registering it/moving on from the login page. don’t know if it was my facebook or a glitch, but thought it was worth mentioning(: i love the idea overall!"
dogs,fc43inx,t1_fc3q9j5,1577405680.0,"yes, however most dog foods/treats already has the required amount of salt/sodium in it, so any people food salt would be extra"
dogs,fc2wg8i,t1_fc2uq76,1577375858.0,i think there are a few causes of pancreatitis in dogs and a high fat diet is one of them!
dogs,fc21f77,t1_fc21806,1577336646.0,"i’m not saying the one steak is gonna kill them, just best to watch what you give as you are solely responsible for your dogs health. too much high fat human foods can also cause pancreatitis!"
dogs,fc2124p,t1_fc20tpt,1577336266.0,"salt/seasonings are not good for dogs- their digestive track isn’t used to it and it can cause an upset stomach. some herbs and stuff are ok, just make sure to research beforehand(:"
reactivedogs,fb3klup,t1_fb2y1by,1576476442.0,my shibe loves other dogs- only gets upset when an excited dog knocks her over (she’s a rescue with only three good legs) and when this happens she just runs back to me(: theres always an exception!
