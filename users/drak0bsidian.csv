Usually my gift is more of a ""New Years"" present because it takes so long to get here.

It's always more expensive, though.

I've been matched with Germans most often, and have never had an address issue. It might be because I order it through the German Amazon website (no need to translate - do everything through the English language site and just copy and paste everything over), or I buy something locally and ship it through the USPS.

Judaism,ffa55fq,t1_ffa39kn,1579728083.0,"I would have expected you to know about it, being on Reddit as long as you have! But yea, it's good fun. I've done the exchanges for going on six years. With each successful exchange (meaning that everyone - you, your gifter, and your giftee - has accomplished what they need to) you get a certain amount of points. Those points allow you to reach thresholds in which you can opt to exchange only with others within that threshold, further guaranteeing that your exchange goes off without a hitch.

The points also allow you to participate internationally; some exchanges I do within the US, but specifically the books and the Secret Santa exchanges do I opt for an international pairing. I have gifts from Mexico, Germany, Austria, Australia, and New Zealand!

**Edit:** How have you only been on Reddit for two years? I could have sworn you'd been around for much longer."

Abraham didn't practice Judaism (or any type of codified ritual practice) as we'd recognize it, but is considered to be the first Jew. The rituals of the Israelites in Egypt would be equally as unrecognizable, but they were - for all intents and purposes - Jews. And they wouldn't just be unrecognizable - they were practicing a faith without documentation (i.e. no Torah had been given).

Once we reached Israel, each tribe had their own rituals and practices, which were melded into a unified form under the Kingdom of Judah. Each Temple period also had their own rituals, and what we practice today, rabbinic Judaism, has evolved within itself over the last 1,500 years since its decentralized founding.

There isn't. And if there is, no one outside of that little group would accept the individual as Jewish. Being Jewish isn't just a personal identity - anyone can call themself anything they want. But without acceptance from the group by which the individual identifies, their self-identity is meaningless.

You should do more research before slinging mud. Those denominations have their own protocols and standards - they aren't simply free-for-alls."
