depression,ff3r2lt,t3_erbhjy,1579547018.0,I’d give everything I have to cry again. ✋🏽✋🏽✋🏽✋🏽hellppp
depression,fevbdtn,t3_eqkpsy,1579395356.0,"I feel you man. I thought I always got drunk for fun. But now I’m almost 22 and it’s been several years of drinking on the weekends and now I kinda realize how alcohol kinda makes it possible to think I have no problems. But sober, years later, any problems I thought I could maybe solve or forget about with alcohol are all still there again. It sucks. I’ve gone to like 8 AA meetings recently cuz my uncle goes sometimes and I thought it was really cool. The people in my area who go to this one place for meetings, I like and they share great stuff it’s like we all kinda have similar problems and they can be overcome idk. If this helps at all maybe."

At about 15 minutes until 25 mins or something these guys talk about that. Being in a corner of your mind and stuff. I related pretty hard"
depression,feir2zv,t1_fehgjr0,1579145080.0,Yes!!! For sure. I’ve been numb for years and it’s terrible. But I can’t figure out how to cry again. It’s like ever since I stopped crying this one time a couple years ago I can’t feel those feelings I shit off again. Any ideas ?

depression,feiqwjy,t1_feilime,1579144951.0,"I sobbed in the shower 2 years ago, but I stopped after a minute or two because I was scared of people hearing me. Any ideas on how to do it again? I stopped myself and suppressed that spontaneous expression and river of feelings. Now I’m depressed and lost connection to myself."
depression,feiqnnx,t3_ep7rm5,1579144783.0,I saw these videos from school of life on YouTube how to be sad and dealing with depression and how to process your emotions and I found em helpful to explain my lack of joy and foreground constant boredom. I’m still bored af and nothing really keeps me entertained but I think if I somehow can acknowledge my feelings I can get that joy back

depression,fecjvz2,t1_feciphm,1578975695.0,"I’m sorry you feel that way about how others kinda are towards you. I think it’s better to have self love than to have people like you or at least think they do, but not like yourself and have to act. Me personally I’m completely numb and it’s terrible so don’t stop yourself from crying, I guess. I don’t know I don’t have advice haha, but I just want to help"
