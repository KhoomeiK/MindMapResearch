unpopularopinion,fbdnv8d,t3_d3v6hu,1576767202.0,"Disagree.

Suppose a website put all its ads along the right edge in a column. If I put a strip of paper over that column and consumed the content, is that stealing?

If I have a free newspaper or magazine, and have someone offer to cover every ad with post it notes, am I stealing?

If I mute television or radio commercials, am I stealing?

Problem with the initial argument is that the end user has not signed a contract that states that ad viewing is required in order to consume the material on the site. Some sites have chosen to put content behind a paywall and require money and authentication, which is a legitimate exchange for some.

Personally, I will NEVER buy anything from an internet ad because that is not how I choose which products to buy. So ads shown to me this way are wasteful."
