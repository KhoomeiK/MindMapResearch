* Imperialistic power projection - hostile annexation of the South China Sea, weaponizing economic assistance with debt traps, cultural invasion of other countries.

China,fcwn2h7,t1_fcwi2ju,1578030322.0,"No.  Trump will want to look tough but he is an idiot who doesn't bother with details.  He'll tell the military to make it go boom and not care how the military does it.  The professionals in the military will decide the best way to give Trump what he wants.

This will turn into a continual low level stick poking game.  Nothing more than it has been for a couple of years.  Iran will go straight at the US military because it would create the kind of escalation they want to avoid."

China,fcwhrbh,t3_ej9vuz,1578025950.0,"I think you overestimate the amount of resources the US will throw at this.  It's not another land invasion and occupancy.  There will be tit for tat attacks but the US will do it from above and afar with the resources they already have in place throughout the middle east.  Don't forget all the private mercenary companies that can be brought in without drawing down our forces elsewhere.

I don't think China will make the mistake of thinking that we are looking the other way."

Legalization - No

It should be like a parking ticket.  Something that doesn't go on a criminal record.  But there is such a problem with substance abuse and mental illness, it shouldn't be legalized."
