EDIT: Heavily downvoted for merely stating reality. Touchy teenagers."
Catholicism,feseegg,t1_feoxpla,1579364343.0,You can only use “Real” if the title has been bestowed by the Crown. And if it has been bestowed it was for a very special reason normally because of some patronage by a king or queen which could go all the way to the king or queen being the founders.

Catholicism,femc1ax,t1_fem8ir6,1579247950.0,"The difference between Poland and Spain is that the Poles did not have sufficiently strong forces to confront the communists. That’s all.

The Holy See recognised Franco’s government as the legitimate one in Spain already in July 1937, just one year after the war started.  That should serve as a guide."

Catholicism,fekem2n,t1_fejph0e,1579198432.0,"You weren’t there, my friend, I assure you Franco did not strike half as hard as the communists did, they lost the war but controlled the narrative."
Catholicism,feke7y8,t1_fejtgds,1579198200.0,"Excuse me but we do know his faith life. There are at least two books out there that desk precisely with that.

And about his “atrocities” do please explain. He is not known for ordering massive killings of civilian population (Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Dresden might ring a bell) or incarcerating non-combatants (US citizens of Japanese ascent might bring memories), or blatantly ignoring international law by promoting government overthrows (vast amount of examples across central and South America).  He is known for saving thousands of Jews in Hungary, for example, in an episode conveniently forgotten by the official narrative and at a moment when the Allies didn’t want to have anything to do with rescuing Jews out of Germany. 

There were atrocities committed in the latest Spanish civil war but no one can attribute those to the direct orders of Franco. 

The hard truth is that if it wasn’t for Franco and the people who fought under his command, the Catholic Church would today be a shadow of its former past in Spain. Examples abound in Eastern Europe."

Catholicism,fejdj6k,t3_epe3o8,1579168731.0,"Francisco Franco was a devout catholic. There are at least a couple of good books describing the way he practiced the faith, if you are interested, but they are in Spanish.

He explicitly sought to conform the laws of Spain to the precepts of the Church and he made the defence of the Church one of his driving forces.

He did not use the Catholic faith for anything ideological basically because he had no ideology as such, he was a pragmatic man that just wanted to stabilise Spain after more than 100 years of civil wars and bringing the least favoured people in society to a dignified position, which he achieved to a very large extent.

The Spanish “republicans” (communists would be a better term, as there were some quite high profile republicans on Franco’s side) were no just “less friendly” towards the Church: they laboured hard to destroy it, more than 1000 martyrs already officially recognised by the Church (a lot more to come) attest to this."

And the local languages were preserved throughout Central and South America because Spanish catholic priests took good care of learning them and even compose grammar books of those languages and dictionaries so that they could communicate with the natives in their own languages."
