confession,ffacvof,t3_esd6po,1579732564.0,"This is disgusting. It’s sad that people are encountering you in these comments, but I’m going to assume they’re just a bunch of kids. You are a grown man and you’re  hitting women because you’re annoyed? Stop being a spoiled brat. Get a job and get your grown ass out of your mother’s house before she has you arrested."
childfree,feh5xb0,t3_ep1k59,1579109815.0,"For me, it was a particular incident/period of time. 

Three years ago, I moved out of state to the east coast and I had to live with my brother, his wife, and their 2 toddlers for a year until I saved up to get my own place.  My nephew has undiagnosed behavior problems and would start every morning off with blood curdling screams at 6am. He would scream throughout the day whenever he didn’t get his way and it was extremely disturbing to me. Both the kids are also very spoiled and were messy, belligerent, and I was often stuck with babysitting them. By the end of that year, I was sleep deprived, irritable, and miserable 85% of the time. 

I have my own place now and I finally decided that I never want to live in the same household as kids again. I don’t have the patience to deal with kids, and I value my time too much to have to permanently hand it over to some bad ass children. 

My family still thinks I’m joking when I say I’m not having kids. 🤷🏽‍♀️"
Showerthoughts,fdt6ud0,t3_emvatn,1578712688.0,"I hate when people do this. I live in NYC and there’s always tourists by my job taking pictures with the homeless people that are sitting on the sidewalks. That’s so humiliating. Like ok we get it, if you’re gonna do something nice and give them money that’s fine but most people don’t want their hard times broadcasted on the internet so you can feel like a nice person."
childfree,fdqeku0,t1_fdqawh9,1578664634.0,In Ohio (my home state) it doesn’t matter but it’s only for newborns up to a month old and as long as the baby isn’t abused they don’t ask any questions. It’s called the Safe Haven Law. Not sure how it applies nationally though.
childfree,fdq5c15,t3_emohwz,1578655537.0,"She didn’t make the kid herself so it’s fucked up that you’re considering getting a separate apartment and leaving her with him/her alone. It sounds like she’s also going through postpartum depression and you both feel trapped. Your parents also did not make this kid so please don’t put that responsibility on them either. 

I don’t know what state you’re in, but please lookup the laws in your state regarding the “no questions asked” option. Some states allow you to drop the baby off at a fire station, police station, or hospital and they’ll just take the kid without you getting in any trouble. Or you could also look into adoption but that may not be an immediate resolution."

offmychest,fdc63b8,t3_eki8ru,1578267832.0,Congratulations! This just gave me hope. I’m 27 and I’m going back to college this year after dropping out for like 6 years. I’ve been really down about it and didn’t wanna tell people but I’m so glad you went back and finished. Good luck with your career. ☺️
astoria,fd7qzfd,t3_ek4dq6,1578208724.0,"I’m a real estate agent in NY. Sorry if this comes off as rude, but we don’t feel the need to play around with uncertain or unprepared buyers/renters. 

If I feel like someone is wasting my time, I move on to a client who’s serious and ready to make moves. Real estate in NY is very fast paced and that agent probably had at least 5 equally qualified people willing to make moves ASAP. So no, it’s not the agent’s loss. 

That being said, I hope you find what you’re looking for and enjoy your future home. Please just keep in mind that time is very important to people in this city."

offmychest,fcz9tfj,t3_ejnf6c,1578096575.0,"Ugh I’ve been like this my entire life and my family always got mad when I’d ask them to stop smacking.

I’m 27 now, and I’ve come to realize that you simply cannot control the way other people eat. I just remove myself from situations where I know I’m gonna become enraged from hearing those noises. For instance, when I go to my family’s house, I always go to another room in the house during breakfast/lunch/dinner. They think I’m being antisocial for not wanting to sit and eat with my family but I just can’t sit there and listen to that smacking. It may seem rude but it’s what I have to do and I don’t apologize for it. My mom likes to stuff a bunch of food in her mouth and then call me on the phone. I used to be polite about it but now I just cut her off and say “I’ll call you another time when you’re not eating because you know I don’t wanna hear you chewing and smacking in my ear.” Rude? Probably. Effective? Absolutely. 

My advice is to just try to avoid being in the same room with people who eat like that if you can. Simply get up and leave until they’re done eating. If they think you’re being rude, tell them they’re being rude for chewing like a horse."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcwvpdn,t3_ej3k5c,1578039588.0,"Oh now y’all wanna cry about unfair generalizations. 

So where is this energy when black men are openly calling black women monkeys, dogs, saying we have ugly features, ugly dark skin, and nappy hair? What about when they say we’re only  “cute for a black woman?” Or when they proudly proclaim that biracial babies are cuter than black babies so they wanna have mixed kids? How about when they call us bed wenches for dating non-black men? Or when they chase after white/Asian/Latina women and tell those women that they’re better than black women? Black men will pass up an educated, financially stable black woman for an obese, uneducated white girl then have the nerve to convince her that she’s better than all black women and black women are jealous of her. “sHe TReaTs mE LiKe a KiNG” 😂😂"
offmychest,fc8glat,t3_egp6pj,1577534457.0,"From what you said, they went as a group and at least one of them was sober so I don’t see how it’s their fault. You mentioned that a group of men were harassing them, but you also say “young girls are stupid” and “wtf is wrong with you girls?” That makes no sense. You can’t blame them for being targeted by Bill Cosbys in training. This mindset is exactly why so many guys don’t see anything wrong with their predatory behavior. 🤦🏾‍♀️"

I’m going to be starting therapy for the first time next month so I’ve decided to make 2020 my year of self care and I hope you do the same.

Happy New Year!"
DoesAnybodyElse,fc7ooj7,t3_egmyop,1577514506.0,"I also get extremely depressed during this time to the point where I isolate myself and I’ve barely left my apartment since thanksgiving.  This has been happening for about 5 years.

I decided to do sort of a deep dive on my life events from the past 5 years or so and I THINK I figured out why this keeps happening (at least for me personally). I used to be a in very emotionally abusive and narcissistic relationship where I was constantly cheated on/rejected. My ex would cheat on me with his daughter’s mom and this usually would happen around the holidays. She would always come to him with this whole “it’s the holidays and I want us to be a family for our daughter” crap and he’d go for it and end up spending Christmas, Thanksgiving, and New Years with  her. He would then convince me that I’m being a jealous girlfriend and I must be jealous of his kid (which was not true).  She eventually ended up getting pregnant again and he left me for her. Also during this time, my immediate family moved out of state and I stayed. This caused me to spend the holidays completely isolated and lonely while I sat at home and watched everyone on social media post cute little family photos with their boyfriends and husbands. 

Fast forward 2 years, and I have since moved to the same city that my family moved to so I have been able to attend holiday dinners/parties, which helps a little bit I’m still extremely sad during this time of year. New Years is still pretty rough because everyone I know has someone special to go into the new year with and I don’t have that. I’ve concluded that I have some sort of ptsd or something because I can’t shake the constant sadness and feelings of dread during the holidays even though I’m spending them with family now. 

TLDR: I have the same problem and it’s because of past stressful and emotionally taxing events that happened during this time of year. I would suggest you do some self reflecting and try to see if you can figure out what causes you to feel like this during this time of year."
childfree,fc7h3z5,t3_eghqyp,1577507258.0,And I’m sure she’s the same type of person who would try to blame the company if her kid were to get abducted from the store while she’s too busy scrolling Instagram 🙄
loseit,fbx2khy,t3_eenmvj,1577166840.0,Thank you for this. I’m only 27 and my teeth are terrible. I really wish my dad would have taught me healthy oral hygiene growing up. I’m getting them fixed now but so many people aren’t informed on things like cavities and how you get them.
