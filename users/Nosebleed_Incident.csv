Generally the elements won't retain their properties in compounds. Compounds get very complicated very quickly, and like you pointed out, neither oxygen nor hydrogen have properties similar to water.

bestof,fckv3sk,t1_fckdd2y,1577733840.0,"I understand what you're saying. Totally. I think the other commenters are correct in that assigning traits to masculinity and femininity is not important, and that using good traits to be a good person is what matters. But I think there is more behind what you said. We now live in a modern society with technology and structure that our biology is not at all prepared for, and men will have the biggest adjustment to make. 

Millions of years of evolution are working against us now that we live the way we do (in massive communities with food and water readily available, no real environmental dangers, and endless stream of mostly useless information and stimuli). In this environment, the 'feminine' traits like cooperation, sensitivity, elegance etc. are considered good, while the 'masculine' traits such as competitiveness, aggression, violence, and strong goal-orientation are seen as anti-social and destructive. This isn't necessarily wrong either; we can't have a very effective society if everybody is aggressive, ego-boosted, and violent all the time. Now that there aren't any saber-tooth tigers to defend our camp from or dangerous game to hunt, this kind of behavior is obsolete, and the more 'feminine' qualities are better for constructing an effective society.

What I think you (and I) have struggled with is, how can we take these 'masculine' traits into something acceptable to ourselves and society? I think the answer is that we can't. Men got stuck with these traits that were very useful to us 10,000 years ago, and probably helped us get to where we are now, but in this new way of life, they are destructive and demonized, while the 'feminine' traits are constructive and celebrated.

This makes it difficult to resolve a positive version of masculinity, and I think we will have to stop assigning traits to genders in order to get this right. The change will have to be a social evolution thing and will probably only happen over the course of generations.

I don't want to say that we should try to reject all of the 'masculine' traits though. There needs to be an understanding that these feelings and behaviors exist in humans, and we have to acknowledge them as neither good or bad. Ripping apart modern 'masculine' hobbies like video games, motorcycle racing etc. is very destructive, and it doesn't just hurt men. Women who want to play video games or race motorcycles also suffer. 

It is very important that we not tear these traits apart because it ends up being very damaging, and causes this struggle that you're describing. I'm a gay man, and I think gay men feel this issue strongly because we get all of our personality traits used against us all the time; straight people are not accepting of feminine gay men, and the gay community is not always kind to more masculine members, making fun of how they're trying to be straight and rejecting gay culture. So men get torn apart from both angles, and all their personality traits are shat on, and then we wonder why male mental health is so poor.

Sorry, that comment ended up being way longer than I wanted lol, but like I said, this issue is particularly annoying to me, and I thought you made a good point."
