CompetitiveHS,ff5q4r6,t1_fdfh03v,1579605638.0,This is how I feel about Cubelock. Love piloting that deck and always will. Popping off cubes and tutoring/cheating shit out was the bees knees.
CompetitiveHS,ff5k5kh,t1_fekj13l,1579596733.0,"I have to agree. Arena is the best game mode to improve your ‚Äúgame sense‚Äù. It‚Äôs the most ‚Äúpure‚Äù game mode in HS, in terms of the basics of playing the game. Most games are about who can control the board, and often make the right decisions at the right time. 

I probably play 75% Arena and 25% constructed, but when I play constructed, I feel like my experience in Arena helps me for some reason (even though I don‚Äôt have the best knowledge of the meta most of the time)."
CompetitiveHS,ff5jwm6,t1_fe536es,1579596379.0,"This might be a silly question, but when it comes to discovered cards, do you ever assume things based on seemingly trivial things, like how long it took your opponent to choose their discovered card (whether that be almost instantaneously or they take 20+ seconds to decide on one)? Might be a dumb thought, but I usually assume if they pick a card instantly that it‚Äôs probably a very strong card whether that be a big swing minion or a powerful spell (board clear, polymorph, etc), and of they take a long time, it‚Äôs probably not anything that they can use/need.

Idk, just some food for thought."
CompetitiveHS,ff5dsbf,t3_eo5a4i,1579588649.0,"Just got back into the game, and decided to craft this deck and give it a whirl. So far, I really like the play style (even though I‚Äôm still getting used to it, as I haven‚Äôt played Rogue much besides in Arena), and love the versatility of it. 

However, I‚Äôve noticed that the Lifedrinkers tend to be dead cards in my hand half of the time, or I don‚Äôt have a good time to play them. Are they essential to the deck? Or are there any cards that could be subbed in for them? Like Zillax, or anything else? Thanks"
CompetitiveHS,ff5dfc9,t1_fedwke2,1579588254.0,"I‚Äôm sorry if this is a stupid question, but what does HCT stand for? I‚Äôm trying to figure it out and I can‚Äôt put my finger on it lol. 

I‚Äôve been playing around with this deck list lately, and I find Lifedrinker to be an underwhelming card that often just sits in my hand unused. Looking for replacements to try out atm.

ArenaHS,ff5bozl,t1_ff3vrk1,1579586417.0,"Yeah. I used to love getting Paladin, but now I reluctantly choose them if the classes I want to play aren‚Äôt presented to me (Warrior and Rogue mostly). 

I still think the difference between classes is pretty thin, and any class can be won with as long as you draft well and make the right plays in game."

CompetitiveHS,fetqjje,t3_eqfldx,1579378425.0,"Just getting back into the game, and have currently been just playing Arena and the solo adventures for the past 2 weeks. I really want to make a competitive deck to try and climb the ladder with, but don‚Äôt have any semblance of a deck to use. I do have ~8K dust and do have some cards I can dust if needed to get enough to craft a new, good deck. 

(Edit: the only relevant legendary I have already is Zilax... and I know that he‚Äôs used in a few deck atm. I also have Ysera, not sure if it‚Äôs used at all though. The rest of my cards on this account have basically rotated out of standard)

I was thinking of trying to make one of the Galakrond Rogue decks, but whenever I‚Äôm about to craft any of the cards needed for it, I chicken out... mostly because I don‚Äôt want to craft a deck and then learn that I‚Äôm absolutely trash with it. I‚Äôve never played Rogue in ranked, and in the past when climbing I played Handlock, Cubelock, Zoolock, Heal-Zoolock, Odd Paladin, Dude Paladin, Token Druid, Hardronox Druid, and that‚Äôs about it. 

Any decks you guys would recommend for me? And does anyone have any deck lists/guides for playing any of the new Rogue decks that might help me understand how to play it, so I can judge if I think I‚Äôll be able to confidently pilot them?"

ArenaHS,felhuo6,t1_feklnrs,1579222533.0,"Yeah.. tbh, I can see a lot of people drafting this when it‚Äôs released because it *looks* like a juicy, game-swinging card (which it definitely can be), but it might end up being a ‚Äúwin more‚Äù card more than anything, or there will be something more practical/usable up against it when drafting. 

I will say, that in a match that is pretty even and goes long into the late stages of the game, top decking this card can absolutely win you a game in one turn."
