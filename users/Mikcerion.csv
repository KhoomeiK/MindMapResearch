FragileWhiteRedditor,ff6yy9i,t1_ff6xr84,1579637766.0,"What society? Do you think every person of <some> color is raised equally? Not every white person comes from USA / other multi cultural country. If they teach you in USA that whites are superior, then you have very great country, where people live with each other and don't even try to respect each other.

Here I don't know how much of a problem it is, because I don't know any non white person living here. What I know is that mostly brainwashed morons tend to be racist where I live."

1. They bought their kid an Xbox and then destroyed it (they could have burnt that money instead then)

coaxedintoasnafu,fcx6ryw,t3_ej6pu0,1578053560.0,"Ok so I see a lot of negative comments there. 

Depression is complex. Things that you say and you think are helping can be harmful. If somebody says you are not helping, do not try to push your helping hand down their throat really.

Things like ""just smile"" made me feel bad during depression because I felt I couldn't even do that. 

What really helped me was a professional doctor, if you want to help somebody, help them going to the doctor/therapist. But it is hard for some people to go and talk about their mental state so be more understanding."

 I have thought about backing up on SD cards because of physical space but can't understand price argument really."
