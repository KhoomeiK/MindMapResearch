Dashcam,feyfmro,t1_fewl7mm,1579444858.0,"I had a incident with a kid that hit my brand new car I’d had it maybe a year. I was parked wait for my nieces and nephew to get out of school. This idiot was screwing around and hit my rear drivers side corner panel. Had multiple eye witnesses to his wreck-less driving I told the officer that it seemed the kid tried to drive off, officer knew the kids family as soon as he said that I should have requested a different officer. Kid got off light with an illegal lane usage ticket instead of e wreck-less driving. Thankfully he was insured. But it still irks me. 1. Because it was my first brand new car and I had only had it for a year. 2. The kids attitude pissed me off. He told me to calm the f*** down that it wasn’t that big of a deal. 3. Because the cop ignored the witnesses and let this punk off with a lighter ticket. 

The biggest kicker is that a few months later I ended up working with the jerks ex-girlfriend (they were both high schoolers) and she told me he was messing around trying to act like he was going to hit her and that’s how he ended up hitting my car."

This is good advice, I’d say it’s not so much about the things but, the stories behind the things. Or heck just Th e stories themselves. 

I really wish I would have ask my mom an documented some of the stories she told. There are things I’d love to know that I always thought I’d have time to ask her. Now it’s too late. She went to the hospital and was basically put on hospice care, she went home on the following Tuesday afternoon, a day later she was essentially comatose. She passed on Friday morning. 

I’m just glad we were able to have our whole family together to “say” our goodbyes she got to hold her great grandson and was chipper until she was no longer responsive."

CHICubs,fec0vab,t1_feae6f5,1578964991.0,Honestly tho why waste energy on a player who probably condones cheating to get ahead. To Dallas how are your teammates better if the way they “get ahead” is to cheat using technology to steal signs. It actually makes them worse than the players on the Cubs.
CHICubs,febzzg8,t1_fean5rm,1578964764.0,"Maybe but how much of their “better run” is due to the widespread cheating within their organization as opposed to to actual hard work. The success they’ve “enjoyed” in the past 3 years should carry an asterisk, as it’s impossible to tell just how much the players benefitted from the cheating. The fact that the players themselves aren’t facing punishment is somewhat wrong, they all had to know to a degree that what they were doing at home games being tipped to certain pitches was wrong. In my book any player whose ok with using technology to steal signs to benefit the team is a loser and is almost up there with the Ryan Braun’s who dose themselves to get an edge."

It’s very easy for us to get “tunnel vision” when watching these videos and say that an accident was completely avoidable. The fact remains we have absolutely no idea what either driver saw.

CHIBears,fbybc12,t1_fbw69ae,1577212647.0,"The answer is not good. Mahomes had/has the perfect situation. He was able to sit for a year a learn from an actual starting QB. He also has 2 pro-bowl caliber WRs that can get separation and a pro-bowl TE. Add to that an O-line that doesn’t constantly let defenses run all over them. And a head coach who knows how to play to the strengths of his players and not try and force them into something they are not. 

I honestly wish Nagy hadn’t won coach of the year last year I feel it’s gone to much to his head.  First he decided to move Daniels to center, then instead of testing that move in preseason against other NFL teams he sits his starters for essentially all of preseason. He then try’s to make Trubisky be a pocket QB which he is not. Mitch gets hurt and we have to rely on Chase Daniel. Then in his first overseas game he makes to bone headed choice to fly out in the Thursday before the game.  Then waits till it’s essentially to late in the season to move Whitehair back to center. He’s never really tried to establish a run game, I guess in his defense with a O-line that’s terrible at opening holes it’s kinda understandable. Where’s the freaking O-line coach is he not watching his guys? Then add in that this season Trubisky really only has ARob as a trustworthy target, because the WR core leads the league in dropped passes. And that he has had NO TE this season with Burton being injured the whole year, a Shaheen who hasn’t lived up to his potential. 

All the pressure to exceed at QB and he really has no help outside of Robinson. 
Yes he over throws his guys to much, but how much of that is the WR not getting enough separation and not always running the route correctly. Trubisky had/has potential and the willingness to try and get better. But he needs help. Nagy has to stop trying so many gimmicky plays. They aren’t working this year at all. 

Add in the they played against the one coach who knows Nagy better than anyone else. Andy Reid probably was able to predict what Nagy was going to do and Nagy didn’t adjust to that. 

Just look at Tom Brady this season. Without Gronk and reliable receivers outside of Julian Edelman he struggles. The only thing the Patriots have going for them this year is a top five defense that’s creating turnovers."

The first game against the Vikings and Lions and our last game.Plus who knows how many other games they’ve won do to horrible officiating.
CHIBears,fbvgsag,t3_eegg7g,1577130583.0,"Mahomes would probably be shit without the guys he plays with like tight end Kelce and wide receivers Tyreek Hill and Sammy Watkins and even Demarcus Robinson has played well and he has an O-line that can buy him time. Mahomes definitely has play makers around him. Trubisky is talented, yes while not as talented as Mahomes, Mitch really only has Allen Robinson II who can make tremendous plays sometimes Miller can make plays, when he runs the correct route. The O-line has outside of a handful of plays played horrible, Leno hasn’t been able to block anybody even when he gets help. Yes Mitch deserves criticism but he definitely shouldn’t carry all the blame. Nagy has to stop calling the stupid gimmicky plays they are only hurting Mitch. Like whatever that play was that Miller fumbled for a 10+ yard loss. Nagy needs to play to his offenses strengths not try and force them into his “mold” that’s what makes Andy Reid so good as a coach he knows how to make the best of the guys he has and he plays them to their strengths."
