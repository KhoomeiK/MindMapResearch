That's is some bogus shit! You know what makes an American really, not these bible thumping, gun toting, white trash that is what is displayed. A true American recognizes that we are a young country that has made MANY mistakes, but the one mistake not made was making America a melting pot. Americans choose to be here i rather have a country full of people that come from everywhere not because we are the best like we say, but because there is the opportunity to be the best. To build it better ourselves and we do that with people that fight and go through hell to be here. The mexican that battles jungles, rivers, disease, gangs, border patrol, ect to come here for just the chance to be American is a billion times more American than any white neonazi trash will ever be."
offmychest,fefdiix,t1_fefb5qd,1579053990.0,Yeah dude the hate you are getting is totally unfounded plus i mean the subreddit is /offmychest. which translates to me that this is something you had to vent and when people are venting its not always going to be sensitive. Regardless I fully agree with your post and i think it's unfortunate how instead of overcoming their past they want to suffocate in it. There was a person who was like it doesn't matter if you are drowning 7ft or 20ft you are still drowning well then swim up and you won't drown at all.
offmychest,fefad1p,t1_fef9xl8,1579051922.0,Right and people are taking it way too personally. I mean I get what you were trying to say honestly because I feel that way sometimes too; it seems that any time someone does something bad it's like oh I had a bad childhood. However you know you're an adult now you have to grow up a little bit and deal with some of that trauma and present yourself like a working adult no matter how difficult I can be sometimes.
Louisville,feetv53,t1_fecprgt,1579041093.0,Lol right! I didn't see ur post said the same thing lol
Louisville,feetrmx,t3_eogvhp,1579041035.0,"What if the girl just like rainbows, wtf?!"
offmychest,fee9d06,t3_eog7oh,1579029091.0,"Op isn't trying to invalidate anyone's trauma they just want people to stop being like ""my dad beat me so im going to beat you"" or ""i got bullied so im going to go shoot up a place"". As an adult we have to choose whether to do better than what was done to us or embolden it by repeating it. We know what is being done to us is wrong to a certain extent so we shouldn't use our trauma to justify traumatizing another."

Parenting,fbqq65l,t3_edzimg,1577034223.0,"You are so right! i have been cobathing with my since he was like 4months... Maybe younger, but i get in in my bathing suit then have my hubby or mother-in-law hand him to me. he plays while i wash him. He's only pooped once but that was ok cause we just drained the tub and took a shower instead lol. But he's about to be 1 and he's getting to where i can sit on the toilet next to him help him soap when needed then rinse when he's done. He'll be bathing on his own with just supervision soon and i will miss the bonding lol. All kids are different though so if it doesn't work out you'll find what does :)"
