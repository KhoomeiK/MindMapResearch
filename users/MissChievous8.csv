aww,ff32gvt,t1_ff2iq3z,1579531944.0,"Yep they are super cute but they make horrible pets. Their diet and social needs are really hard to keep up with, they poop like 15 to 20 min after eating (they eat a lot for their size!) and if you watch some videos of them, you'll notice sometimes they look like they are rubbing something on themselves. Guess what it is? Its piss. Their rubbing piss into their fur and do this multiple times a day. If you were to touch one, you're basically touching a piss oiled bat. It's called urine wash behaviour. Scent is an important sense to a bat and largely how they communicate with other bats so they like to stay stinky. Also this ones kinda funny... bats are highly sexual creatures. They have sex and/or masturbate multiple times a day and are not discrete about it at all!"

Dealing with people like that can be down right exhausting. Not to mention who wants to keep telling your lifes details to someone who's just going to constantly one up them? The only thing I've found that works is one of two things. After they have diminished your story with theirs simply say ""interesting"" and change the topic. Or if you really want to be bold about it, as soon as they start to tell you their I've got it worse story, cut them off mid sentence or get up and walk away to do something, pull your phone out and mindlessly skim through reddit or something lol! They should get the hint!"

ehlersdanlos,feu9l5z,t1_fetnypq,1579384484.0,Really? How interesting! Mine pop in and out all the time too and most often it's not painful at first... then a little bit later my tendons and ligaments will tell me otherwise and either swell or lock up. I understand some of the bone pain.. it sucks! Sometimes I feel like I dont have enough skin on my feet and that my bones are trying to push right through it
ehlersdanlos,fesjnos,t3_eqdkqy,1579365894.0,"Hi! First off... hugs! I know how horrible it is. I'm 34 and have been suffering with symptoms fo-eva!!!! Sometimes they get a lot worse for a while and then back to feeling ok for a bit. Kind of a cycle I guess. Stress is definately going to make your condition worse but that being said having people and doctors tell you that stress is causing your issues is enough to make anyone lose their shit. Yes stress can cause palpitations but so can dysautonomia. POTS is super common with EDS patients and from what I've been told by many other zebras here, the symptoms can come and go day to day. It's worth a Google search to see if you get that ""ah ha, this is me"" moment. Basic first line treatment for that is upping your salt and water intake. I noticed I feel better on days where I've had a lot of salt and kept my fluid intake higher than average. But if you're like me, I have a weak bladder now and all the bathroom trips royally suck. 

As for your pain with your hips.. I'm really sorry your going through that. Enduring constant pain is something people should get a medal for. I heard a quote a while back that stuck with me...  healthy people wear a crown only the sick can see. I understand how incredibly frustrating it is dealing with the vast majority of the medical community because most of them dont treat a patient as a whole and focus on individual issues even tho it's all connected. Here is my honest opinion. Fuck the doctors. Lol! I'm kidding, but not entirely... what I mean is you are your best advocate and if your doctor isnt taking you serious and you know you need more help from someone who understands than request to be sent to an EDS specialist and demand it if you have to. Are you in the US or Canada? I could possibly help you look up info for where to go if you would like. 

About what helps for the pain... NSAIDs dont seem to help me very much either so I only really take them when I have a migraine coming on or for the first day or two after a sprain/injury. What I did find that helped immensely is CBD/THC oil. I was honestly very skeptical at first and thought it wouldn't do anything but within the a hour after taking a dose I can do stairs again without wanting to cry. I cant say if it'll work for you but worth a shot!  I also use heat and ice packs like crazy. Epsom salts in a warm bath too. 

Also yoga really helps! You would have to do some Google searches for the yoga but theres a lot of you tube videos of beginner style moves you can follow that aren't overly strenuous. 

And finally massaging pressure points for relief. A lot of the time where you are super achy, it's not actually the area that's tensed up and causing the issues. Like for me I get almost daily tension headaches and a visible muscle knot on the back of my neck and used to press that knot like I was trying to push it through my skull hoping for relief. It did nothing but provide seconds of relief and brusing where I pushed. Later I found out that theres a muscle right in between my shoulder blades that was the real culprit and fatiguing that muscle would actually relieve the chain of pain I like to call it. On your hip theres a few pressure points. I'll leave a link to a website about some of them maybe itll help you find some relief for now :)

ehlersdanlos,feqdt1f,t3_eq9g9v,1579340605.0,"Hi!! I'm pretty new here too! :) I have something similar to this. Could be one of two things.. could be scoliosis like the others were saying. The shoulder that drops is also usually accompanied by your hip on the same side being slightly higher than the other side. It's also possible its caused by tight muscles/tendons from having something misaligned. I tend to have one shoulder higher than the other without realizing it when I hurt my back, neck or shoulder somehow. Also it's hard to tell by the picture but I think I spot a chest wall indent. I have one too!!! They dont always cause issues but having an uneven rib cage does make it harder for things like your spine to stay even so I'd say get your doc to check you out when you get the opportunity to go see him or her again."

ehlersdanlos,feleyr7,t1_feld89d,1579220596.0,"Right!? I know theres real decent doctors out there but damn I have some bad luck running into the ones that dont seem to know shit from toothpaste... my family doctor told me most of my issues couldn't possibly be connected to one cause.. finding out now that yeah it can.

I went to an internal medicine doc after my family doc was unsure where to turn next and at the time my family doc was set on fibro being a diagnosis.. the internist flat out told me nope it cant be fibro because that would have shown up in blood work ergo its gotta be MS. I've asked 4 doctors about this since that visit and they all confirmed fibro does NOT show in blood work. So I had to go through lyme testing, diabetes, and tons of testing for MS for the last 2 years... I wonder where he got his degree from and if they still sell that kind of cereal?? Hehe ;)"

ehlersdanlos,felchwu,t1_felam1i,1579218948.0,"Ok! Thanks for your info!  I've noticed theres times my heartrate will jump up 30 or more beats when I get up and other times it only goes up about 20 bpm. That's why I was questioning if pots is a possibility. It doesn't happen all the time... but it's really interesting to hear it doesnt happen all the time for other people too. 
Oh I hope I dont have to go to yet another specialist!!! I've seen sooo many at this point and I've developed a bit of a mistrust for most doctors. I remember going to my gp as a kid with my dad and us showing him hey my elbows bend in and my knees can dislocate if I bend a certain way, told its normal, later I keep going back about my knees and skin problems. All normal I'm told. He said could be juvenile arthritis but that's super rare and never tested me..I've had unsolved issues with my liver developing a couple lumps that wasnt cancerous so they didnt care to look deeper, had a rheumatologist look at my knees and me tell him all my symptoms and he couldnt piece it together that I have eds. When I say look I mean look.. he didn't come within arms reach of me to inspect my swollen knee yet offered to drain it and said its most likely patella femoral syndrome. I had iritis and the the eye doctor told me it normally only happenes in auto immune and connective tissue  disorders... should have been clue one. I've been to hospitals with injuries I cant explain and symptoms that tests cant find anything like numbness and twitching and it all leads to nurses and doctors treating me unkindly, telling me it's just stress and making me feel crazy. It took me being fed up and not taking fibromyalgia as a diagnosis and digging deeper to discover (on google none the less) that I most likely have EDS. It was a very ""omg, this is me"" moment. I took my findings to my new gp (old one retired) and she agreed, sent me to a connective tissue specialist who also agreed who sent me to the Eds clinic in Toronto. There is literally a sign in my doctors office that says ""please dont confuse my medical degree with your google search"" ... I think that needs to be taken down now"

ehlersdanlos,fel5s65,t3_epls9a,1579214665.0,I sprained my ankle in december and didnt go to the hospital. Most of the times I've been there they treated me like garbage and I didn't want a repeat of that even though I had a visual injury. I've been there before with my right knee being over double the size of my other.. front sides and upper knee swollen and the bursa on the back of my knee was bulging out. The nurses asked me why I was there if it wasnt from a recent injury.. it was only like that for 4 days before I went in. My finger tip dislocated just yesterday actually. I even tried to get a picture of it lol! I wouldnt go to the hospital for help unless I couldnt pop it back in by myself. Just from my personal experiences I feel that they would just laugh at me and tell me theres nothing wrong
ehlersdanlos,fel4q5e,t3_eplcgo,1579214014.0,"Yup!! I've partially dislocated my thumb many times trying to open a jar... and when taking off a knee brace, or turning a lock that's hard to move.. life in general lol"
ehlersdanlos,fehkbky,t3_ep1zxs,1579118291.0,"I get something similar to this... I'll get a really sharp and painful stinging feeling (usually randomly without trauma to the area) in a hand or foot (normally on my fingers or somewhere on a toe or bottom of my foot) and when I look I can see a small pool of blood under the surface of the skin. Its hurts like hell for the day and then feels like a normal bruise for days until it heals up. 

Also I gave myself a giant bruise a few weeks ago on the back of my calf. All I did was reach my finger in between a pair of socks and my tights to pull my sock off and me poking into my leg with one finger left a bruise that was the size of my fist. Furustating how easy it is to hurt myself so I completely understand where you're coming from.

ehlersdanlos,fe5wt0e,t3_enqzax,1578876701.0,"This is pretty much ALL of Ontario's health care system. The amount of things ive suffered with and had no idea until I google search diagnosed myself and brought my findings to a couple doctors is beyond maddening. I've been treated like garbage by hospitals and specialists. The last specialist told me that when my hands or feet go numb to just ignore it and say I dont have time for this and go on with my day. That was his ""medical advice"" went to a connective tissue specialist who told me to just stop standing with my knees hyperextended. Just always keep them bent a little he says. He also said I need to do gentle stretching exercises to strengthen my body?? Umm Im overly stretchy everywhere already. The rest of the time I'm met with doctors who wont come near me and nurses with nasty attitudes towards me. If you arent suffering from something obvious and visual where they can see the cause some way, than you're treated like garbage. 

How many of them had to go through compassion training and even suicide prevention training?? And they are failing both with how they act and treat people. Pathetic. I have zero respect left for the health care system. 

I'm really sorry you're being treated the way you have been. Think it's time we just start putting people in their places instead of letting them talk down to us like this. 🖕 them! Lol"

I had zero complications when I was pregnant except a super sore back and really swollen feet in the last month... stretch marks too... be prepared you'll most likely get them because of the way our skin is but honestly mine faded to a be barely noticable.

Yay us! Lol! 

I think they will listen when you go in... I mean they kinda gotta!! And if you get the idea they arent, just request to be sent to an EDS specialist.

They were very surprised it was missed all these years. 

I really had no idea what stretchy skin was...  I've been like this my whole life so I thought what I've got goin on is normal and everyone's skin is like that. I've always been told I have shockingly smooth skin.. just figured I take care of it enough to be that way lol! I always knew I could contort my body without any kind of training for it  but it was always just parlor tricks, kinda like this girl above.
