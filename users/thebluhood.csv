Am I right to say that there have been/are some issues you are facing right now that make you feel this way? Formerly suicidal myself, and I did go through a lot in the past. If you feel comfortable talking about it, drop me a msg. Not going to be overly optimistic here, but since you know what life is like, and bad as it may seem, at least it's not unknown territory. Take care."

therapy,fcxqkoc,t3_ejgg2v,1578069086.0,"What you're going through can't be easy, and it sounds like it may be frustrating to tackle the issue at its core, but I believe you can do it. This has happened to a close friend of mine a couple of years back, so I think I can imagine what it's like. 

First, I would like you to consider the possibility that what they say is not entirely false, that you are intelligent. While it seems to me that they overly emphasize it, the fact that you have good grades at university level, is an impressive achievement, ""even"" if you did work hard for it. I believe that to excel in anything, you need a minimum amount of talent before your effort can carry you. You may say that grades are not a necessary indicator of intelligence and that is true, so let's say you have ""academic intelligence"", which is also a very good trait.  Believing in yourself and your intellect, while not necessarily being something that can solve the problem fully, can help lessen the pressure you are facing right now. 

Second, your classmates may say this due to envy. This is a wild speculation on my part because I don't know them personally, but I'd say that it is a possibility. There may be closet muggers among them who say this because they can't achieve the same grades as you and refuse to accept that you are more academically inclined. If this is the case, and I hope not, then unfortunately you probably have to accept it, since you won't be able to change their attitudes. The best I can say is to keep believing in yourself and you have the potential to do it. A simple ""Others think I'm smart, so why not I challenge myself where possible to see if that's true?""

Last, perhaps you could try asking your classmates if they want to study together. I believe there are two benefits to this: Your classmates will understand that there are areas which you are not as strong in, which require improvement and it will help foster your bonds as you do something meaningful together. Can't hurt to try, right? 

I hope that I was able to help you, even if just a little. All the best with your future interactions with your classmates. :)"
SuicideWatch,fcr50i8,t3_eijhkc,1577896862.0,Respect your bravery to live your life for your mom. Not everybody has that kind of courage. Cheers!
SuicideWatch,fcr1mfz,t1_fcqwyul,1577895450.0,"Hello again. You appear to be in a lot of pain, and in retrospect what i said did not fully take your feelings into account and I apologize for that. I get that you have doubts when I claim that I care and in all honesty, I'm not offended, but just a lot more optimistic than others. You're also right when you say I don't know you, but if you ever do feel comfortable, you could drop me a message to chat about our lives. This isn't an empty promise, I do put effort into things like these, but it's entirely up to you. :) 

It's just like how you continue to live your life even though it is painful, and I just wanna say not everybody can do that. So if nothing else, you aren't a weak person. Additionally, (and I know this is an easy thing for me to say),is there any chance of reaching out to your ex? If you find some meaning, don't you wanna have a shot? Hang in there just like you have all this while, tbh I'm not happy in my life too, but we gotta do what we gotta do."

SuicideWatch,fc0l2v4,t3_efi486,1577293442.0,"I'm sorry that you had to go through what you did with your best friend and mom. It can't be easy and if I were in your situation, I would feel the same way. However, as much as you may love your best friend and mom, they don't own or control you, and their thoughts certainly do not dictate their actions. Your best friend may have been unsympathetic and shown no understanding, but you don't necessarily have to let her words get to you, it's the same with your mother. Yes, they do hurt, but life has infinite possibilities. Think about the times when you were happy, life has so much good to offer, don't let the words of your mother affect you to the point where you deny yourselves these opportunities to happiness. 

Please, talk to your mom, open up to her and share what's plaguing you. Be honest about how you're feeling, it will be hard, but please believe that your mother will help you if you first help yourself. Tell her that it hurts when she pretends that everything is ok and you want her to help. By sharing with her, you are giving her more reasons to understand and more opportunities to connect with you and make you feel better. Hope this helps. :)"
SuicideWatch,fc0jnsl,t3_efibc7,1577292329.0,"Hello there, it seems like you're going through a difficult time and my heart goes out to you. You say you are a complete failure and have not moved past where you were when you got out of high school. My question here is: Could you be a little too overly critical about this? I do not wish to downplay your problems and tell you to forget about it, because everyone's issues are very real and should be managed carefully so as to allow it to be better understood. 

Comparison is very common nowadays, we compare with everyone. Strangers, peers, our past selves. However, I think expectations have become increasingly high and a lot of us want so much from ourselves that we are quick to blame ourselves. I know it's really cliche to say ""Count your blessings"", but it can be really useful to do that sometimes, just to remember that we are more fortunate than we realize, and we should cherish what we have been given to the best of our ability. I would like to try and invite you to think of something good that has happened because of you, it can be anything really. Even if you made someone happy, that counts as a success, since it developed your relationship with said person. I'm sure there's something good that you have done that is worth remembering. 

In essence, I'd like to sum this up with a quote by Vincent Van Gogh: If you hear a voice within you that says you cannot paint, then by all means paint and that voice will be silenced. If you feel like a failure, then please go ahead and try to do something you've always wanted to do that you've considered an achievement. It really doesn't matter how well you do it, for by trying, you've proven yourself wrong that you're a good for nothing. So I beg you to consider taking a first step towards something new. You are not worthless, and are not a huge waste of space. Hope this helps, and happy birthday in advance. :)"

family,fby486f,t3_eeszew,1577207699.0,"Hello, I'm from Singapore too and I agree with your stands on fillial piety and the need to give back to our parents and elders. I don't want to drag religion too much into this but in Buddhist teachings, it is said that when giving back to our parents, we must ""pour water into the cup until it overflows"". In whatever we achieve, we must always give back more to our parents, and even then we will never truly able to repay them back for all the love that they have given us. Your parents seem very, if not over, understanding about your elder brother not willing to support them, which while good hearted, is likely to cause them trouble with finances in the future. I get that you are a fillial person and I respect you for that and it must be very frustrating for you to have to deal with your brothers nonsense. Unfortunately, some people are just selfish. I believe that sometimes you have to be more insistent with people like these, when their actions do hurt people. If he won't listen when you ask him about it, then speak up and be fully honest with him about how you really don't like it and how you think he should stop being a dick. It won't be easy, but I believe it's your best chance. If he doesn't listen to you, find a way to make yourself be heard. Hope this helps. :)"

Loving someone is one of the best feelings that you can experience. That's why I don't want you to think about killing yourself. Don't even entertain the slightest idea of it. There are so many positive things in life that can bring you happiness, being in a relationship and with someone that is so great you can love with all your heart is one such example. Please don't hurt yourself, give yourself the opportunity to live a wonderful life that you will enjoy to the fullest. Here for you. :)"
SuicideWatch,fbxu4kg,t3_ef0ziy,1577200565.0,"You say you are a failure and people in your life would be better off without you. I'm not sure whether these statements are true or false, so I won't dispute them. But I want to say this: There is always a chance for redemption. You may have done things that you are ashamed of, I have too, I get that it sucks. But moving on, you can either try to make it up or do nothing and be painted in a negative light for the rest of your life. Would you really want the latter to happen to you? It may seem hard to try to make a positive impact on others, but baby steps are crucial. Even if its slow, as long as you keep moving forward, yojr progress still counts, no matter how small. Everyday, just focus on trying to do good things, making others happy is a truly wonderful thing, I kid you not. It will make you happy and serve as a source of inspiration to you to keep helping others, to keep redeeming yourself. What you've done before cannot be changed, but you now have the opportunity to make things better, so go for it! Keep on moving forward! Hope this helps. :)"

Somewhere out there, there are many people who do care. You may not know it now, but there are so many caring wonderful people on this planet.

But I will say this: I do care about what happens to you, and I don't want you to go or hurt yourself. Even though we don't know each other, I believe everyone has the right to live their life and try to pursue their own happiness. Yes, you feel very sad now, but there are so many what ifs. What if you tried, just that little bit of effort, to not give up? What if you persevered, just that tiny yet extremely crucial bit of resilience, to try and get up from the setbacks that you have faced? What if, you tried to live your life to the fullest, face the infinite possibilities that life has to offer you? These are very big what if's, but the answers could be world apart from what you are feeling now. I hope you won't give up, because for what it's worth, I'm with you.

SuicideWatch,fbxro9a,t3_eew5fz,1577198637.0,"I'd like to say that I feel you are a brave and caring person. I'm really not trying to sugarcoat it, but what you're going through definitely cannot be easy and my heart goes out to you. Nonetheless, it takes a great deal of courage to cope with the sadness you are feeling and try to brighten the lives of your son and mother. I respect you for that. I understand that having no ""real connections"" can be suffocating, everybody wants someone to be able to connect with and confide in, someone whom they can be genuine around because they know everything's gonna be alright with them. Unfortunately, life isn't always fortunate like that and most of the time things can be sour. But I'd like to say that just because you don't have any close friends does not mean that your life is meaningless. Everyday, if you could focus on all the positive aspects of your life, both of the good that happens to you, and the good that brings to others, it's very likely that it could really brighten your day! I know its cliche, but I think too little people do actually count their blessings. We all can be happy if we focus on something positive in our lives. Dr Seuss once said, ""You have brains in your head, you have feet in your shoes, you can steer yourself anywhere you choose!"" So my question to you is: Will you let your lack of connections stop you from living out a life, or will you try and embrace the positivity that life has to offer you to develop and grow as a human being? The choice is yours. 
Additionally, if you do want to make a new friend, I'd be happy to talk to you, I promise to be non judgemental and as helpful and genuine as I can. Just drop me a message. Hope this helps. :)"
SuicideWatch,fbxqe5o,t3_eewlrz,1577197573.0,"My heart goes out to you, I was depressed before and it really did suck. What you're going through right now must be really painful, but please don't give up. You may have suicidal thoughts, but it is possible to not give in to them. It is our choices, rather than our internal self, that reflect who we truly are. During my darkest days, despite all my sadness, I would constantly tell myself ""You are braver than this, you are stronger than this, you are better than this. You will pull through and see the light at the end."" That was what enabled me to become more optimistic. As long as you try your best to live your life to the fullest, that's already a massive step towards helping yourself. Help yourself by believing that, even if nothing else, doing so will demonstrate your resilience and strength of character. It's your choice, so my question is: How will you make the most out of it? I'm here if you ever need someone to talk to. Hope this helps. :)"

It seems that you've been through a lot, and my heart goes out to you. Suffering is unwanted, but very unfortunately it happens, even to the very best of us. But I think that ironic as it may seem, some good can come out of feeling pain. Not only do we know what it's like and not want it to happen to others, we are also presented with the opportunity to stand up against it and be as resilient as we can be. In that regard, you can help yourself. Please, give yourself one more chance, there are many things in life that could bring so much meaning if we were to just examine them a little bit deeper. As for others who can't help you, I believe that there are people out there who care. I do, if it does mean anything to you. I hope I can give you that little burst of courage and confidence to go on about your life, life can be the most beautiful thing to know, please trust me on this. I believe it's possible to go on, no matter how impossible it seems. hope this helps, here for you if you need anything :)"
