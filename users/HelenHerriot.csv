For example, a person who is habitually rude may constantly accuse other people of being rude.”

Adult coloring books (the thinner ones) generally fit in there, small books, an inexpensive/small gift card (coffee, movies, etc.), fancy hair clips/barrettes.

They can sometimes cause... *ahem* gastrointestinal upset), jerky, protein powder, etc. It kinda depends on your audience, yanno?"
