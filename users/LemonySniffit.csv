AmItheAsshole,femmmn5,t3_epnbxq,1579262757.0,"I never comment on these posts but seeing the bizarre responses from other redditors motivated me to finally do so. NTA, and you should go to your best friends wedding.

 Not only is it apparently very, very important to you, as you said it is one of three most important events in your entire life, you’ve been waiting forever to attend it, and you’ve put in a ton of effort into preparing for it, but you’re also the best man who has an active role in the ceremony. 

It sounds harsh but your life long best friend is alive and counting on you, and your girlfriends father is not. The wedding is only one day, and the father can he honored/remembered every other single day of your life. You would not be an asshole for not attending, as it will make no difference to the dead, and his family will likely just want to be with other family (except maybe your girlfriend). Who, from the sounds of it, might not be your girlfriend for very long.

The damage with your girlfriends family seems to already be done and on top of that they are, petty, rude and passive aggressive people who based on how they treat you probably never were that fond of you anyway, and will likely be out of your life sooner than later. They are selfish for even asking you to miss an event so important to you. I would never do that to my SO, and nor should your girlfriend. Furthermore why the hell did they plan it on a day they knew was very important to you (and by proxy your girlfriend), that was planned for 2 friggin’ years?

 So, for the love of God NTA and hope it is not too late to attend your live long best friends special day."

todayilearned,fde54ud,t1_fddti3e,1578331396.0,Indigenous who tribes? Native Americans and Aboriginal Australians probably did more environmental damage to their respective continents than all contemporary logging and mining industries combined.
todayilearned,fde376o,t1_fddqavc,1578330164.0,The Netherlands for one has no more space because almost 60% of all land is used for a barely profitable agricultural industry that only employs about 1% of the population and exports the fast majority of its produce.
todayilearned,fde2htp,t1_fddz0ck,1578329707.0,The fact that a tiny country like the Netherlands is the second largest agricultural producer in the world shows that we could farm a lot more efficiently and not waste nearly as much land (and water) as we currently do.
geopolitics,fdddv7f,t3_ehlhst,1578307651.0,"I know this sounds terrible but wasn’t Germany able to increase its birthrate by some ridiculous high percentage in the 1930s? Maybe the EU should look at what exact policies worked for them, i.e. things like giving young couples particular financial incentives to have children."

imaginarymaps,fby6niw,t1_fbxukau,1577209381.0,"From just scanning those articles it seems that these studies not only rely almost entirely on guesses and estimates based on insufficient data, but they use flawed methodology and  completely fail to take a great number of factors into account."
