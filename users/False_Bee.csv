Kickback of the weapon, a split second  fear of death as you pull the trigger, a distraction. 

Some people use shotguns thinking that will for sure do the trick, but that makes kickback an even worse problem, and often it cause the aim to go more up into the frontal lobe.

The faster it squeezes, the faster things get digested and noved around into your intestines, that also squeeze to move the food around to get rid of it. 

When you're hungry, your brain sends messages to your stomach to get ready for food, so it starts getting active by releasing digestive juices and squeezing. This sequeezing is caused by the hormone Motilin. It causes the gut to move food around and be prepared to do so when empty. 

A hormone called Ghrelin sends messages to our brain that we are hungry, causing you to think about food and the growling of your stomach.

Studies show that in a completely enclosed environment (like a space station), they can help a little. But in a house, air is coming from out side constantly, so the little bit the plants may do to help is overshadowed by the contaminated air from outside.

Basicly a lighter is a tube full of pressurized lighterfluid. The pressure helps push the fuel out to be lit. Without pressure, the fuel doesn't get pushed out.

explainlikeimfive,ff7pz4t,t3_es3wx6,1579655527.0,"We can't tell for sure really, but some ways we use are tests to see how they react to certain things. 

A common one is the mirror test. 

Basicly, you put a dot on the animal and show it a mirror so it can see itself with the dot. Many animals will look at the mirror as if it is another animal and react that way, but some will see the dot and touch its own dot. 

In doing so, it is thought that they recognize themselves and are inspecting the strange dot on them. 

Human babies pass this test this test around 18-24 months old. 

This test still has problems though aand its difficult to understand exactly what is going on because the animals can't tell us. They may not understand the concept of a mirror or have other interests that distract from the test. 

An interesting fact is that this has even been tried on ants. The ants scratched at the dots on them when they saw it in the mirror, but didn't when there was no mirror and they didn't scratch at the mirror, suggesting they may see themselves and understand."
explainlikeimfive,ff7oc3t,t3_erzt37,1579654373.0,"Bacteria make toxins to help defend themselves. They also make waste by eating and basicly pooping out harmful substances, kind of like we do. 

When a food sits for a little while, more bacteria populate it, but it hasn't had long enough for waste products or toxins to build up. 

So we can eat it and feel fine for a little while. But, it had a lot more bacteria on it than non-contaminated food. So those bacteria grow jn your belly instead of out on the countertop. Thr grow and grow, pooping and releasing toxins. And after a while, theres so much waste and toxin that you feel sick and your body tries to get rid id it by throwing up. 

On the other hand, if a food sits out for a longer time, the bacteria grow on the food on the counter. Theres a lot of bacteria and a lot of waste and a lot of toxins. So you get sick much more quickly, because all the work they would do in your stomach in the above process, is already done.

Think of it like eating pistachios with the shells. You can eat them individually, taking the shell off and eating them one by one. Or you can take the shell off of a lot of them at once and pop a whole bunch in your mouth. If you do them individually, it takes longer for you to feel full. If you do them all at once, your stomach is more full quickly."

Now we travel wide and far frequently. People from other countries come to our own and expose us to those baceria and viruses. 

So basicly, on a global scale, the mixture of bacteria is more uniform today than it was in the past. We now have more exposure to a wider array of bacteria that helps boost our immune system against them."
explainlikeimfive,ff7mw0k,t3_es0x2s,1579653356.0,"You use saliva to help make things easier to chew and mash up through lubrication, as well as to help start digesting it with enzymes in your saliva that break down starches and such into smaller easier to use pieces. 

Imagine if you had no saliva and wanted to take a bite out of some bread or some salad. It'd be dry. When you chew normally, the saliva helps firm it into a paste that is easier to move around and chew. Without it, it doesn't mush very well, things like lettuce don't get broken up as easily. And then you try ro swallow and it gets caught in your dry throat. 

Seeing food acts as a heads up from your eyes to your brain that there is food you might want to eat. Better to be ready than to end up chewing for a long time before it starts making saliva right?"

That means that they won't cause any harmful effect in most people, even if they don't have the condition the medication treats or cause any serious side effect in most people. 

Someone in this thread mentioned metformin. The reason metformin isn't a good candidate is because metformin requires some education on its use and on diabetic education in general, or serious risks such as bottoming out your sugar may occur. 

If you take an extra tylenol here and there, nothing is likely to happen as long as you don't do it frequently; if you take extra metformin, there is a good risk for lowering your blood sugar too low which can harm or kill you easily. Metformin also has a lot of other risks that require occasional monitoring of thinks like kidney function.

explainlikeimfive,ff5e6ym,t3_erqmne,1579589099.0,"The key to losing weight and keeping it off is doing something you can stick to forever. Diets fail because you diet for a while, lose weight, and go back to your old ways and gain it back. 

To lose weight and keep it off, you need to relearn how to eat and exercise by slowly replacing bad habits with good ones. 

Cutting out regular consumption of sugary drinks like soda is a good first step. 

Take it one step at a time and master each good habit so it sticks. Take a couple of weeks to get used to it and get past the cravings. 

Add another good habit after you feel good about the last one. After 2 weeks or so of not drinking sodas, look at your other eating habits and switch poor choices for good ones. 

Also work in good exercise habits. Start with something easy: a walk a couple times a week, 30 minutes. Even once a week if that is a struggle. 

When you feel comfortable, bump it up. Go more frequently or do 60 minutes instead of 30. When you're ready, start working up to running. You don't have to go from walking to running, you can run a little here and there between walking to get used to it. Before you know it, you'll feel comfortable running longer distences without stopping. 

Once you've established healthy weight loss, all you have tondonis keep up with your habits. 

Don't beat yourself up too much if you miss one day or eat something unhealthy, just remind yourself next time. Encourage yourself rather than beat yourself up. 

Eventually the hard work will just be every day habits. It won't be a struggle, it'll just be what you do normally."

todayilearned,fewk7xd,t1_fevd5qo,1579412430.0,"Insurence doesn't pay much for it. Hospitals typically take a loss on things not covered by insurence, because who has that money laying around? 

So psych is basicly a money pit. Most insurence pays at best 20% for psych inpatient visit. 

Granted, american health costs are inflated as fuck. But why would you open a psych facility when just about anything would be more profitable? 

But not everything is about money. People get into it because they care about the people suffering. 

But burn out in psych is pretty big. You're taking on a lot of hard to deal with shit. Peoples stress and depression and anxiety. Its hard to be a good therapist, nurse, or doctor in psych and not get tangled in the personal shit."

People scratch, get sores with fibers in them, and assume the fibers are part of the illness. We prove its not. Not entirely illogical to think the fibers were the cause before hand, especially to someone who has no medical knowledge. 

But the itching, what was that from?"

Was the almond like a marzipan style or just crushed almond peices?"
