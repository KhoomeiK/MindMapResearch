Cooking,fep6pxj,t3_eq9wej,1579313372.0,One of my favorites is cut up some broccoli or similar veg and throw it in a pan with lid and half a cup ish of chicken broth or stock and let it steam till pretty cooked but slightly crunchy and take it out. Add oil and a bunch of thinly sliced garlic and cook for 30 seconds then add back the broccoli and 1-2 tbsp of oyster sauce depending on how much you like. Obviously this recipe works the same for any par cooked vegetable and I love the flavor of oyster sauce and a little goes a long way.
