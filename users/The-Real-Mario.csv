preppers,feso9qh,t1_ferwnuk,1579367358.0,"Sorry , we obviously have a lot of different precognitions.  I live in BC where the government started giving out narcan kits with syringes and single dose ampules, opioid overdoses kill by paralyzing  the breathing apparatus , I volunteer with Saint John Ambulance where I get to know a lot of professional paramedics  and they believe the CPR mask can do a better job at keeping a patient allive because if it's an accidental overdose; giving proper CPR is just as effective as narcan, and narcan needs redosi g every 5 minutes 


 The big difference is that if the patient is addicted and gets given narcan they will very often instantly go into withdrawal,  some times refuse care and go look for another dose  , then 5 minutes later the narcan wears out and they go back into withdrawal except now they are in a dark alley instead of inside your ambulance where you can give them another dose of narcan, and if in those 5 minutes they did find another dose now they are overdosing twice as hard. 

Another issue I was explained by a nurse (only relevant if you use syringe-ampulle kits) is that as we all know brain cell death starts to happen after 3 minutes if apnea, and even an avarage first aid attendant is hardly nimble enough to give an IM dose of narcan within 3 minutes, and that's assuming that response was instantaneous, while at best it will take a first aider 1. Or 2 minutes to get on location.

So the idea is that : if you you are not well trained in first aid then narcan is good because anyone can use it 

Then There is the issue of having too many issues in your mind, how do I know that the patient accidentally double dosed on medication? They are not breathing and need artificial respiration so I'll give them that, it's not a very easy task and thinking about wether or not I should give them narcan will distract me a lot from the prime directive  

If you are well trained in giving artificial respiration with a CPR mask then it will be a better and more reliable method to keep a patient alive ,

While an untrained bystander is probably not gonna make much difference using a mask , so they  may as well try to use narcan on the off-chanse  they will will administer it  properly and quickly enough to save the patient ."

One could be worried about having bared windows in a fire, but in most of the world houses are made of brick  and are a lot safer, also perhaps one could install some escape hatches that can ony be opened from the inside .

- The ammo box is intended for mortar smoke shells , the seal was in perfect conditions, I added aluminium tape to the gasket to further protect against EMPs (tips tinfoil hat ) 

Otherwise I didn't touch the box at all, no holes 


The frame is made of aluminium plates 0.200 "" tick, and 3/8"" threaded rod , nuts hold all the plates solidly in position from both sides, the radio is held on by 2 strips of 0.032"" tick aluminium that may hopefully absorb some impacts of I were to drop it. 


The wiring is very simple, all Anderson power pole, all the positives and all the negatives are bundled together, you can see the 110v plug and the powerpole input coming out of the front, because of the simple wiring I gotta make sure the included power supply is unplugged if I want to plug in the 12v input so I just always keep the power supply unplugged and plug it in if needed. 


At the bottom there is a box with a bunch of random stuff, a few antennas and some parts I wanna add to the build like a fan that I want to install under the box that contains the microphone . 


I still want to add a nice push button to function as a crappy CW key if necessary .

conspiracy,fckaxkp,t1_fcjy2fw,1577721188.0,"I don't know much about the computer side, but the reason your car remote only works while you hold it is that the transmitter in it is very low power (like maybe 50 milliwatts) and the antenna is very small and omnidirectional, intact because of the limitations of the transmitter I would guess that the receiver is very sensitive , if someone used a 10 W transmitter with a directional antenna (a few hundred dollars in equipment)  they could easly interact with the receiver in your car from geosynchronous  orbit , I am not exaggerating at all, look into amateur radio satellites, they are much closer, in low earth orbit , but they only emmit like 2  to 5 ways, their antennas are small, omnidirectional, they tumble in space

legaladvicecanada,fcivkot,t3_ehc0xj,1577670858.0,"I would suggest avoiding the baseball bat-glove-ball unless you actually use them regularly for sports, the thing is, in Canada it's illegal to carry something for self defense even if you are also carrying it for another reason, you can't carry a baseball bat for sports ""and also because I can use it for self defense"" 

Instead, what you CAN do is to keep a mental list of things that are in your reach that you could use for self defense if necessity came,

 for example, some people I know have a small tool box under the rear seat if their car, and I wouldn't be surprised if , if threatened with a knife by a robber , they were to grab a bottle of spray brake cleaner solvent from the tool box and use that to neutralise the threat. 

Some people smoke so they may have some smoking equipment in their car , including a Zippo lighter and a small bottle of lighter fluid to refill it , and if their life was endangered by an assailant they could perhaps squirt lighter fluid in their face, only if the assault was serious enough to warrant it ofcourse.

Edit. 
And like some others said, everyone carries a good flashlight in their car, so if it happened to be a very long heavy one that could also be used in a pinch to reppel an attach , or the beam could be used to dazzle them

And many people use a walking cane , either as a mobility aid or as a fashion accessory, and that could also be used for self defense if necessity arose"
