vinyl,fcw7kfd,t1_fcux0bd,1578018963.0,"Let the market do what it’s going to do.  If people can get it cheaper and faster from Amazon they’re going to.  Local shops can either get with the program or find a new business IMO.  They cost more, oftentimes don’t have the same selection or what you’re looking for at all. You’re partly right, some stores are much better than amazon, but telling everyone to quit buying on amazon just means more of us will either A. Not get the music we want B. Have to overpay for music we want or C. Suck a dick because there aren’t enough local shops in our area (which you do realize is the reasoning for 90% of the amazon purchases so if you want to fix that tell some shops to open up in the suburbs).  Until then, Amazon is filling the niche that these shops don’t provide, convenience."

What my point was is that you learn a lot on the job, anyone old enough to run the business is going to know the math that comes with that (woodworking alone is a lot of numbers most people are too stupid to follow, just check and see how much money IKEA makes from selling services to put together their oversized legos).  Also it’s flat out false they don’t receive an education, it’s not wrong to call that out."

vinyl,fct3k74,t3_eirk3a,1577931963.0,"Yeah that threw me for a loop too when I first heard it!  It’s pretty cool, so our turntables needles are all picking up the grooves and translating it into the music we hear. Thing is it’s not nearly loud enough to really be heard so the pre amp in your player (or the one you’ve added) takes that sound and magnifies it by like a thousand times.  It’s one of the reasons why changing your pre-amp can really effect the final product of sound you’re hearing."

Not saying the scooters are super safe but trying to compare them in terms of safety is laughable. 102 people die *each day* in car accidents (and that’s just the US alone)."
IsItBullshit,fcsotcl,t1_fcqvem8,1577921343.0,"Bit too stupid for most people to agree to, what’s his plan, everyone on earth quits their jobs and when we all die of starvation we can hope the next generation of malnourished children will create a better system?  Protest the people doing something wrong but survival is imbedded into every humans brain, ‘quit your job and lose your livelihood’ isn’t going to convince anyone.  Maybe he believes that’s actually the way to go, sure, but if he wants anyone to even think of him as sane he’ll need to repackage it in a way that doesn’t sound so condescending and childish."
