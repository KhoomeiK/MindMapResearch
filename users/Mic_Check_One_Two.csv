Lots of people find an organized environment (like inside of a game store, or part of a large Discord LFG group,) to be much more comfortable than just showing up at some random dude’s apartment and hoping for the best. Like the DM has been vetted by the game store.

So you have a weird combination of:  
A) People who have been exiled from all the other groups, because of their behavior, and  
B) Newcomers who have no idea how the game is actually supposed to run.

It means lots of players will only ever play once or twice, before the toxic players run them off."
CrappyDesign,ffdkrqk,t1_ffcwv0h,1579822965.0,"Pretty sure it’s cocked sideways to allow for exhaust extractors. It’s fairly common on fire trucks and ambulances, since those are typically parked indoors in dispatch/fire houses. So you attach the extractor hose to the exhaust, and it blows things outside to prevent the entire garage from filling with fumes. But you can only easily attach that extractor hose if the exhaust is cocked sideways. Then whenever a dispatch call rolls in, they simply pull the hose off and the truck is ready to roll out.

So it could just be that this truck is using one that’s also made for emergency services. Or it’s frequently parked and left to idle in a garage."

Richardson,ffchhwa,t3_esvdoe,1579799570.0,"My personal experiences? Meh. Not great, but not entirely awful either. My neighborhood has a shitty node that AT&T refuses to replace, so we just get random “oh yeah your router is working fine but the neighborhood’s node overheated” brownouts at odd times. Sometimes for just a few minutes, but the worst I experienced was ~20 mins when I was trying to upload a video. That was fun. 

And calling to report the outage it is usually just met with a “looks like it’s working on our end” because the node has rebooted by the time you actually get to a real person. That obviously doesn’t fix the ranked game you just dropped out of, halfway though a match.

If you have fiber in your area, then absolutely jump on that. My parents just down the road have fiber from AT&T and love it. The company has refused to install it at my place though, so I’m still in the dark ages with copper.

I’m sure that if I had a good node, I’d like the service. At least the customer service (so far) has been better than Comcast. Fuck Comcast."
AmItheAsshole,ffbgla0,t1_ff9on81,1579764370.0,"Exactly. Watched it happen to a friend of mine. Dude got nearly ten million dollars in inheritance from his step-father passing. This is in an area where the median household income is something like $80k/year. Two years later, he was nearly bankrupt.

When he first mentioned it to me, he asked if I knew anything about how to handle suns that large. I pleaded with him to invest it in something like long-term US treasuries, index funds, or G7’s... So he could basically just live off of dividends as his income for the rest of his life. Even at a paltry 1% return, a ten million dollar investment will return *a hundred thousand dollars annually*. That’s no chump change, and he’d never have to work a single day of his life to maintain it. And 1% is actually a hilariously low estimate. If you’re only making 1% returns on a 10 year treasury, you’ve got some major issues and need to rethink your investments.

Did he do any of that? No. Instead, he blew it on sugar babies (oddly enough, giving pretty girls $50k for plastic surgery isn’t a good long term investment,) and a house that he couldn’t afford the taxes+upkeep on."

A good example I’ve heard in the past is one with firefighters: When more firefighters respond to a fire, the fire causes more damage. We can estimate how bad a fire will be by the size of the response. Therefore, firefighters cause damage, and should stop responding.

It’s an awful argument if you actually know anything about firefighters. Obviously more respond because the fire is worse, and is causing more damage/taking longer to fight/etc... But if you knew nothing about firefighters, I could intentionally misconstrue the statistics to convince you that firefighters just go around building pyres."

Keep your head down, don’t stand out, and you’ll be fine when the authorities eventually talk them down or bust the door in.

The passengers on the first two planes likely expected just that to happen. Then suddenly they were crashing into a building instead. The passengers on the third plane heard about the first two, and actually fought back against the hijackers once they realized what the plan was.

So it’s not that they were unprepared for a few box cutters. They were unprepared for the hijackers to actually use the planes as weapons."

PublicFreakout,fel997p,t1_fekj2kb,1579216839.0,"Sort of. It just won’t be the same.

Essentially, a cochlear implant has “channels” that it listens to. Each channel is a specific frequency band, which it then sends to the corresponding sections of the cochlea. So higher quality implants will have more channels, (or better definition in each channel) giving them more definition.

The reason we aren’t able to fully replicate human hearing is because of those channels. The cochlea is normally full of hair cells, each hair cell is a “channel”, effectively giving us thousands* of channels. But even the best cochlear implants only have like 24 channels. So when the entire 20Hz-20KHz hearing range is chopped up into those ultra wide 24 channels, things get distorted."

plano,fej2eux,t1_fehd3hg,1579154380.0,"It could also be referring to duplicates or backups. Also not defending him, but here’s what I mean: Let’s say this dude had a 1GB video on his phone, then a copy on his computer, then a backup of his phone and a backup of his computer. That’s 4GB just for a 1GB video.

It’s also possible that he had something like a RAID array for his drives. It’s not a backup, but it provides redundant protection against data corruption. Essentially the idea is that you spread the data out across multiple drives. So if a single drive fails, you don’t lose everything. That one drive can be swapped out, and the RAID array will continue as if nothing had gone wrong. But this takes a lot more space. At the more extreme ends of the spectrum, an 18TB RAID6 array may only be able to hold a few TB of data, but would be able to survive two full drive failures before any data was actually lost. For something as shady as child porn, I’d actually bet that this is the answer. Since downloading/uploading it is a huge deal, the dude probably didn’t want to lose what he had. So something like a RAID array would ensure that the data was safe against something like a drive failure."

It’s a good example of Terry Pratchett’s Boot theory. If a poor man buys shitty boots, he’ll replace them every season when the soles wear out and his feet start getting wet. But if a rich man buys a nice pair of boots, they’ll last him a lifetime. And the poor man will spend more money on boots in the long run, from constantly buying new ones. 

Don’t be the poor man with shitty boots. Get a good charging cable, and you won’t need to constantly replace it."

For those who are curious:  
1.	Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked.  
2.	Do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them.  
3.	When in another’s lair, show him respect or else do not go there.  
4.	If a guest in your lair annoys you, treat him cruelly and without mercy.  
5.	Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal.  
6.	Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and he cries out to be relieved.  
7.	Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained.  
8.	Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself.  
9.	Do not harm little children.  
10. Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food.  
11. When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask him to stop. If he does not stop, destroy him.

I’ve played Lawful Evil D&D characters who literally just followed the 11 guidelines to the letter."

RegularRevenge,feehjpl,t3_eonk7i,1579033882.0,"I did something similar during a contract negotiation. They made a lowball offer, and I was actually pretty insulted. It was a $15k contract, and they were offering maybe half that. 

They were the ones who had approached me, not the other way around. It was clear that they wanted me to do it, and the project was already in a time crunch. So what did I do? I turned off my phone and waited a day. The next morning, I turned my phone back on and had a slew of missed calls and messages.

The first few were friendly. “Hey, hope you saw my email. Looking forward to hearing back from you” type of thing. Then they got worried. “Hey. Would really like to hear back from you.” Next they got angry. “We expected you to get back to us by now. That offer was honestly higher than what we thought it was worth. It’s the best you’re going to get.” Then finally, they resorted to apologizing, raising the offer to what I had originally mentioned, and begging me to take the contract.

Essentially, I just ghosted and let them negotiate with themselves. And it worked like a charm; If I had simply demanded the amount outright, they would have declined and moved on. But since they felt like the offer was coming from them, they were happy to pay it in the end."
