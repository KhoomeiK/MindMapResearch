Erasmus,feth4mf,t1_fetdk4f,1579375404.0,Do you happen to know if employers care about the uni someone went to during erasmus? Because I don't know to be honest.
SuicideWatch,feso2p2,t3_eqg8kz,1579367297.0,"I think the advice others have given you is pretty good. As you are 17 and nearly 18, maybe you can try to find a reason to move out and get some distance between you and your parents. Maybe university/college or just a job"

Tinder,fe4cm5i,t3_ens1at,1578857889.0,Not a really good one no. At least he didnt ask for nudes 4/10
Tinder,fdrctrd,t1_fdrbysr,1578682619.0,"True, I understand what you mean yeah. Tinder isnt made for finding friends and she should look for another app yes. If someone is interested in becoming friends, they'll swipe right on her and most of the time not. But about the dirty words, that doesnt need to be per se on tinder if you catch my drift."
makemychoice,fdqs4ep,t3_ekuhrc,1578673699.0,"1 semester, you have to balance fun and money. You have made some fun in the first semester I guess, now you have to compare if the extra money is worth the new experiences that you will receive if you stay an extra semester. As i see you are worried about the money not enabling you to spend too much, i think you should go back. What experiences will you get by staying another month, is there much new stuff to see/do/live? Or more of the same?"
makemychoice,fdqr8zt,t3_emrje5,1578673164.0,No
Tinder,fdq2z76,t1_fdpxb63,1578652323.0,"The tinder culture turned itself into dirty words and stuff, however not everyone is a fan of that of course. Maybe there are some people who'd like to use tinder but not in a way most people do."

makemychoice,fcxjcma,t3_ej4iyw,1578064363.0,"I guess don't. Wigs are pretty expensive, and maybe your fiance would think you to be less attractive. Think about it for some more time and talk about it with your fiance. Maybe it is an impulsive decision so take some time to think about it."
makemychoice,fcxj075,t3_ejb6k1,1578064125.0,"Wait for the PS5, the ps4 is getting to the end of its lifetime and it will be better for you to save some more money and get something that will last you many more years than if you buy a ps4. Until then, play some other games on your pc or switch"
makemychoice,fcxisws,t3_ejf8cz,1578063984.0,"Econ with a Cs Minor, follow what you love but which also can get you a job. Economists are always needed so you'll find a job. Especially some knowledge about CS will make you more attractive for recruiters as that is something good to have next to economics"
SuicideWatch,fcaaqyz,t1_fca3gpb,1577565769.0,"You don't deserve anything bad, you might feel worthless but that doesnt mean you should punish yourself or even kill yourself. What is bothering you to make you want to take your life?"
