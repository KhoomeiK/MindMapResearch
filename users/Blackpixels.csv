The auto-aim for Blitz PC is like the WoT PC style – you point it a red and right-click, and it aims just below the center mass of the red. It's also a ""hard"" aim in that you'll stay aimed there regardless of where you look, until you right-click again or the red dies.

dankchristianmemes,fch2yb7,t1_fcgs3cj,1577646809.0,"Not quite; it's more about you gotta actively receive the redemption.

It's like Jesus' death gave everyone a gift-wrapped box with redemption from sin/eternal life inside. To actually get its benefit you gotta (1) Realize that you actually need what's inside the box (acknowledgement of your sin) and (2) Unwrapping the present (accepting God and His forgiveness into your heart).

Why people don't receive salvation if they don't acknowledge is akin to just leaving that present addressed to you unopened, so you can't make use of what's inside it."

Anyway (generally) Christians believe that we are saved by grace through our faith in Jesus (Eph 2:8).

Yeah we have to ""be as good as we can"" in terms of realizing some of our toxic or wrong behaviors need to change; it's not about living on the edge worrying that you'll lose your place in heaven cause you shouted at an old lady on the street yesterday in the heat of the moment.

Also yeah Jesus loves us but God is also just. There's certainly more to Christianity – some challenging and some pleasant – than what makes for good (and dank) meme material but hey, there's a first step for everything."
