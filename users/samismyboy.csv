We live in Northern California and I’m in the same union as the Bay Area so I make Bay Area salaries, so yeah I make a good wage. Luckily we live north of Sacramento so housing prices aren’t as bad and I can own my own home with my kids.  When we originally got married he was a stay at home dad and he was miserable.

He also takes care of them while I’m at work every day and he does a good job of it. So I feel like I’m mainly paying for babysitting.

FemaleDatingStrategy,feqbx94,t3_eqboq8,1579339973.0,the legal definition of Battery in California is  Battery is the intentional and unlawful use of force or violence against another—physical contact is involved here.  If shoving would fit in the legal definition of battery than it is physical abuse and it will only get worse.  stay as far from him as possible.  The normal abuser cycle is to come back and fiercely apologize and make promises he will never keep or make you out to be imagining it all and then the abuse will start again and get worse every time.  stay away from him!!

MedicalQuestions,feq378d,t3_eqao7w,1579336969.0,"its a blood blister most likely.  if its not hot, or red around the edges its most likely not an infection so quickly.  Don't rupture it, you'll just introduce infection.  Take an NSAID like Ibuprofen and put it up on a pillow above the level of your heart to decrease the pressure.  As long as it isn't getting bigger it should start feeling better tomorrow as your body starts reabsorbing it."

Just a lymphnode thats a bit larger than normal.  they are usually perfectly normal but may swell and become painful if you have any sort of infection in that area like acne, cold sore or even a virus.  They will usually then go back to their original size when you get better.  If you are worried have a doctor take a look at it to be sure.  Worrisome symptoms would be increasing pain and swelling that do not go away, fever and weight loss for no reason."

Accutane,fdtuq69,t3_en34pv,1578722517.0,"Styes are usually caused by Staph infection in the hair follicle around the eye.  I'm sure the irritation from the dryness caused by the accutane can contribute to it.  Doctors don't normally prescribe medication for them because they generally get better on their own.  Warm, moist compresses two to three times a day and throw away any mascara and eyeliner you have been using the staph will generally harbor there and you will just reinfect yourself.  I wouldn't use any makeup until the infection is gone."
Accutane,fdttw38,t3_en3ads,1578722131.0,"Yes.  Its most likely coupled with Tylenol, Right?  Like Vicodin or Tylenol 3.  It does put some more pressure on your liver but if your young and healthy and you don't have any liver issues to begin with you are probably ok.  Just don't take more than prescribed, DO NOT take for recreational use and DO NOT take with alcohol.  I have chronic migraines and for a lengthy amount of reasons I can only take Tylenol 3 and my doctor had no problems with it.  I'm also a nurse if you need any more background."

About 5 years ago I quit telling her to get out and told her to stop calling me when he was awful to her again.  She's never going to do it and he's never going to stop.  The only good thing that came out of it is none of us kids married anyone like him, I can spot an abuser a mile away.  My brother started acting just like him with the anger issues, his wife split from him and he immediately sought help and was able to save his marriage.  But, one reason my marriage ended (among many) was that I am so afraid of conflict that we never communicated.

The clients loved him because he was charming and charismatic.  But he was just as abusive to his staff and slowly but surely they all dissappeared too.  Eventually it came out he was  abusive to his wife and family and his wife divorced him and took his clinic.  Luckily as years went by and I grew up I found my voice.  I worked with another Vet who was subbing for the wonderful Vet I worked for at the time. He brought his hand down to slap a puppy on the flank to ""calm it down"".  Instead, he slapped me.  I had an imprint of his hand on my arm for an hour.  I was quick to let my Vet know and he never worked in out hospital again.
