Like a lot of the comments say on here, a good dom listens and respects the sub, and they don't force them to do things that make them feel uncomfortable.

This guy was just being outright creepy. You are 100% justified to block him."

arkps4,fekufl3,t3_epn1ap,1579207825.0,"A while back there was a series of events known as ""The Extinction Chronicles"". These events brought with them the tek creatures you run into from time to time as well as the increase of 5 levels to your maximum level and an increase of 2 or 3 (I think) to how many times your dino can level up after being tamed. 

Otherwise the only way to gain max levels is through ascension."
FireEmblemThreeHouses,feglvlf,t3_eovxdm,1579096757.0,I agree

entitledparents,fcv6ie9,t3_eiwiu0,1577995661.0,What if we just gathered all these entitled people together and forced them into their own community. And entitlement community where they'll do nothing but argue all day with each other about who deserves something more. It'd be an interesting social experiment.

arkps4,fbeh1hw,t1_fbegiv1,1576785514.0,"Unless you're on PvE, then all you gotta worry about is wild dinos. But no, he's right. While there are Island servers out there, you won't find one that's very popular as it's not that popular of a map. Ragnarok is more popular. My suggestion is to either keep searching for a non clustered server, settle for a less popular one, make your own server without clustering it, or just start playing on the other clustered servers like everyone else and get your own Wyverns and such. If you can't beat them, join them!"
