college,fcvk1c5,t3_ej3dps,1578003751.0,"My school has multiple plans to choose from, for the smallest one possible is $350 which just translates to $350 to spend at multiple eateries on campus. It is required each year of undergrad. I don’t mind it, as I would likely spend that much anyways through a semester. The school doesn’t make money on ours, because most of the places to eat are actual places like chic-fil-a and steak and shake. I think it’s main purpose is to ensure people are actually eating and since you have to spend the money on campus it ensures businesses come so that there are options for those students who don’t have cars and things."

Took 2 years off college, went back for an engineering degree which i’ve made all A’s and B’s. Before going back I watched khan academy and took notes on elementary to high school math. It’s hard work but not impossible."
