Go slow- as slow as necessary to have ZERO errors. This will often be one note at a time the first few run thrus. Once you're getting the right notes, use the metronome at half speed. Don't speed it up from there until it feels easy. It doesn't need to be fast until it's right.

Start small- half a bar to a bar at a time. Practice each small chunk until it comes smoothly, then do the next little chunk, THEN join them together.

Repeat often- do something right three times in a row before you move on to the next chunk. Do this every day until it starts to feel like natural and easy. Once you can connect full phrases, repeat them correctly several times before moving on. Getting something right once doesn't stay in your memory for long. It has to be repeated."
