fatlogic,ff6pmc9,t1_ff6n5tc,1579632239.0,"Especially frustrating because FAs are always going on about how they can't get adequate medical care. So the tech wanted to give this person the best result, and the super-body-confident-fat-acceptor said ""No, I'd rather have a suspect mammogram"""
fatlogic,ff677ke,t1_ff66ust,1579620771.0,"I think the very concept of ""flattering"" is offensive to them"
fatlogic,ff5y9y4,t1_ff5y3ps,1579614160.0,"Right, and where girls are force-fed (and made to eat their vomit if they get sick) so they can be fat enough to be marriageable"
fatlogic,ff36us1,t1_ff36qgc,1579535089.0,"Yeah, I was surprised...I just calculated it from height/weight listed on some website. Questionable accuracy, of course."

fatlogic,fey6q94,t1_fey64ic,1579441452.0,Wow!
fatlogic,fexut91,t1_fexuqev,1579436759.0,"Seriously! Plus you'd think it might be a happy thought that they would not be forced to be a handmaiden, along the lines of ""fat people are harder to kidnap"""
fatlogic,fes7yo3,t1_fes4wqs,1579362328.0,I think it's the frequent comparison to professional athletes that this sub really goes against
fatlogic,fes3ksb,t1_feruynq,1579361013.0,"And that it's ""bizarre"" to be classified as obese, as though it's completely arbitrary. I realize nothing magical happens between 29.9 and 30.0, but still, cutoffs are just the way it is (17 years and 364 days versus 18 years)"
fatlogic,fehixfy,t1_fehh1m4,1579117477.0,"But it's not stigma to have advanced, fast-paced classes! I'd probably be killed in a black-belt karate class, so I'd go to a beginner class!"
fatlogic,fehisax,t1_fehi95k,1579117394.0,"Yeah, it's not stigma that not all exercise programs are achievable for all people!"
fatlogic,fe22ybg,t1_fe0c3jk,1578833924.0,"I do too! I still fight E.D. thoughts a lot, and I started a med that listed weight gain (sometimes ""rapid"") as a side effect, and it TERRIFIED me. I think it's probably a combination of increased appetite (which I can manage) and water retention (which I don't know how to combat, so that sucks), but I wish they would say those things instead of the horribly vague ""weight gain (sometimes rapid)"" :'("
fatlogic,fdkelea,t1_fdke4gp,1578502221.0,"Hahaha, love this!"
fatlogic,fde81at,t3_ekway9,1578333207.0,"I just started a medicine that made me gain 3 pounds overnight. I know it's not fat; I understand CICO. So it must be water weight, I guess? But I'm terrified that I'll just keep retaining more and more water and get bloated and gain weight indefinitely"
fatlogic,fddh7by,t1_fdc3sea,1578312131.0,"I was going to say, I'm surprised attributing ""bad-assery"" to working out is not fatphobic ;)"
fatlogic,fd5ygr6,t1_fd5xrv4,1578183091.0,"You are right; I should have labeled it ""Sanity"". I'm relatively new to the sub, and I forgot"
fatlogic,fd5kb0g,t3_ek22r9,1578178453.0,"Replace ""food"" with ANYTHING ELSE, and it's so apparent how ridiculous this is.
Let yourself spend whatever you want, whenever you want. (Buy the Porsche!)
Let yourself drink whatever you want, whenever you want! (Vodka while driving the Porsche!)
Let yourself do whatever you want, whenever you want! (Psychopaths!)"
fatlogic,fd5j9vc,t1_fd53o7q,1578178207.0,"I think it's really just referring to calories as a whole, not a specific source. The average American eats so many calories that, if all people followed suit, we'd need 4 earths to produce the calories."
fatlogic,fd2crpt,t1_fcztki7,1578145342.0,I'm glad my cousins and I are on see-you-at-Christmas-only terms D-:
fatlogic,fd2cccg,t1_fczpm25,1578145169.0,"But shouldn't ""regular"" and ""average"" mean the same thing?"
fatlogic,fd2c0ik,t3_ejncnr,1578145018.0,"We need a bot that automatically links to the debunked ""95% failure rate"" whenever that load of crap comes up"
fatlogic,fcyq2od,t1_fcyj4yg,1578084765.0,Plus I read it like the thing you hang clothes on ;)
fatlogic,fcxzd1n,t1_fcxxn48,1578072546.0,"Hahaha, erectile dysfunction? I'm reverse; whenever I hear Viagra ads, I think eating disorder for ED ;)"
fatlogic,fcxwkyv,t1_fcxmmo4,1578071509.0,"The 95% comes from an old study (like, 1960s) of 100 obese people who were kind of told about nutrition in a clinic setting and then sent out into the world."
fatlogic,fcqzren,t3_eijtl9,1577894649.0,"Again with the ""your body forces you to gain weight"" instead of ""you gain weight"". Your body is not a separate entity!"
fatlogic,fbw1k6z,t1_fbvl7gz,1577139206.0,"Yeah, it's definitely real, on an FA blog. Soooooo ridiculous! I don't often truly lol, but I absolutely did with this"
