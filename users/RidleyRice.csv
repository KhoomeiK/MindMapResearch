starbucks,fd8b4e4,t1_fd6zrna,1578216198.0,"I agree its seems to be a trend. But do we as baristas give offer a similar nasty vibe to our customers (possibly a giant over lapping*unconsciously* tit for tat game going??) Of course not all baristas (many are good and many are shit, lol). Nasty vibe i.e. condescending, smartass, give off an air of smugness (bc customers are often stupid as hell and we get tired). 

Admittedly I get great pleasure in being the most polite prick barista our customers ever met. And I love when we be out of shit, ""I'm SO sorry to say were out of all our holiday beverages for the season [b!g grinch style grin]"""
