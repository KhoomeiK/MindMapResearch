Despite our strengths, everything I know about your  country causes me to think that the US would lose any war with you. I do what I can to get any US pro war types to see the light-that you haven't declared war in hundreds of years, that you have some of the absolutely most difficult terrain on the globe which protects you,that you are nothing like Iraq and that was lost by US forces, that the Persian empire is the cradle of civilization . 

I personally feel right now, that had it not been for the great work  of other countries mediating behind the scenes (sigh, not the US) in the past couple of days we would be in dire straits. I'm not thinking anyone should be less vigilant. I'm only 1 American of over 330 million of us, but I was educated with a large number of other Americans and students of so many different nationalities. In the circles my life has been part of-not a one of us sought or believed in confrontation. We protested wars in the thousands. So, I hope that gives you hope.
