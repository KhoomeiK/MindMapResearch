IAmA,fecw2hs,t1_febubyn,1578986903.0,"Perfume is one of those purchases that seems expensive upfront, but is totally worth it in the long run. Sure, a pricier bottle will cost you at least $100, but a single bottle will last you something like 800 sprays. So a full year if you use a couple sprays every day. But most people don’t wear perfume/cologne everyday. So a single bottle could last you two or three years."

fatlogic,fdw0rez,t1_fcs6v7a,1578753818.0,"I was never much of a snacker, and I used to miss meals. But now that I’m older (late 20s) I can more easily see the relationship between my mood, brain function and calorie intake. If I miss breakfast or lunch, I don’t wait until I get home. I go ahead and grab a 100 - 250 bite. Keeps me happier and more focused."

ShittyLifeProTips,fd2n155,t3_eju1a1,1578149552.0,"Lol. This sounds like a joke, but it totally works for me. I get sleep paralysis really bad, and see shadowy figures and ghosts. I can’t move, but I can talk/scream (I’m aware it’s all in my head). I started asserting dominance over the shadowy figures by shouting at them during my episodes, and they’ve gotten a whole lot less scary. It helps when you remind yourself that it’s all just a hallucination, and you can control what’s happening."

As far as I’ve heard, not a lot of the Navy is on his side. Just a bunch of conservatives turning this into a political agenda."
Showerthoughts,fcrsm74,t1_fcp06qq,1577906074.0,"Sorta sexism. Old school mentality from way back. 

King is a higher title than Queen. Elizabeth was born into the British royal family, and is the heir. Her husband was not born into the royal family, and is not the heir. In order to make sure the heir to the throne has the highest title, her husband remains Prince and doesn’t become King. 

Whenever Elizabeth dies, there will be a King because her son is heir to the throne. I’m convinced that’ll never happen though, and Queen Elizabeth will outlive her son. Title is going straight to George."
