As far as I know, I didn't die but I cannot be 100% sure."

australia,fd51wnr,t1_fd4w3lq,1578173433.0,Thanks for the response. Yes I will fight mine. I am all for dobbing in these irrisponsible f*ckers. The reason why I still had the dash cam footage is because I saved the video when I saw it. I didnt report it myself because the rego number I spoke over the video (too dark to catch on the video) was not found when I went the rego data bases. Otherwise I was going to report this one. There is a chance they could still identify the truck as it was only 5 minutes past a major truck checking station so they will have a record to be able to get a close match to the rego plate.

I have received a fine for the same thing but I am a non smoker and fortunately have dash cam footage of the truck driver actually flicking out the butt that went under my car at the time. I have to go to court to contest it. A blood test will prove I am not a smoker and I have the dash cam footage so I am confident of getting off. If I was a smoker and did not have the dash cam, I could be in trouble."

newzealand,fcszbnp,t3_eiqm4k,1577928876.0,"Last time I was in New Zealand, I saw a sign on the side of the road promoting the 1 meter rule. It showed a silhouette  of a bike rider and a car sharing the road and giving a thumbs up to each other. I thought that if this was in Australia, they would be giving each other the middle finger. The hate goes both ways in Australia. PS. can anyone post up a photo of said sign if you can get a shot of it. Not sure if they are everywhere, the one I saw from memory was between Hastings and Palmy (I think). I want to have a go at photoshopping it to the Australian version."
