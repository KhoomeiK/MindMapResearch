YouShouldKnow,feppblv,t1_fej2zid,1579326837.0,My situation is very similar minus my dad who passed years ago. It is so much worse to deal with their junk when they are still around to ask what you did with x y and z. I cleaned out my mom's place while she was in rehab and she is still cranky about the choices I made. I had to take over her incoming mail to stop her from creating new towers of useless papers. I'm glad you had your parents' blessing to do it and that you have your dad there as a voice of reason.

news,feipe18,t1_fegp9b6,1579143922.0,"When I was house shopping, all of the options in the nice parts of town had HOAs. The other parts of town weren’t as nice - junk visible outside, tall grass, rickety old sheds against fences that clearly needed repair, etc. I moved away from a trashy city with loud, dirty neighbors and had no interest in living near that shit again. You can talk to that kind of neighbor until you’re blue in the face but they don’t care and that attitude tends to spread. 

My current HOA's biggest drama is with one neighbor who refuses to take a basketball net down. He just pays the fine and will probably do that until his kids stop wanting to use it. They also have a problem with people that leave their trash out front too long on trash day and prople that park on the street where they are blocking driveways. Otherwise they are pretty laid back. I go to the meetings so that I'm not just a faceless name to them should something come up. It's important to participate and make sure the HOA stays good but most people don’t bother."

Tivo,fdf9832,t3_ejsqev,1578356259.0,"Spectrum's cable cards and tuning adapters are aging and unreliable. It's a crapshoot as to whether you'll get functioning equipment and then another roll of the dice on whether the person you talk to knows how to pair and activate the stuff properly. I'm on my 3rd TA & second hours-long tech visit, and the techs have no idea what's wrong. I'm considering finally ditching Tivo over this even though I know it isn't Tivo's doing. But that would be what Spectrum is encouraging so they can charge for their crappy boxes and not have to support CCs anymore. 

Of note I used to have a CC in another city with Comcast, and it took one tech visit, one swapped card, and two phone calls to get that up and running so it's not just a Spectrum thing. 

When it works, it works great! But setup can be a nightmare."

Try to remove every component except power and try to boot, then keep connecting parts back and trying to boot until it stops working and then you have your culprit. 

Also pay attention to any beeps during boot. You can google your pc or mobo name plus beeps to get to the manual which will explain what they mean. Good luck."

DeAngelo faces 13 counts of murder with special circumstances, including murder committed during the course of a burglary and rape, as well as 13 counts of kidnapping for robbery.

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in every county except Tulare and Contra Costa, which aren't eligible for that sentence.

In the wake of his arrest, DeAngelo did not enter a plea to the murder charges.

personalfinance,fcp963z,t1_fcoal18,1577854726.0,"The best system I used:

* HR would post the job and send me the resumes & cover letters from almost all candidates. The ones that obviously weren’t a good fit (no experience at all, asking way too much, etc.) were weeded out before that. 
* I chose the ones I wanted to pursue and sent the names back to HR.
*  They did phone screens to make sure the candidates weren’t crazy or lying and then sent me back any that they had concerns about or that they thought stood out.
* I prioritized the list and gave HR my availability and they scheduled the onsite interviews.

The only thing HR did not do that I wish they did was send automated or personal rejection emails to the candidates that were not chosen."

dataisbeautiful,fc1sfxf,t1_fc0r10y,1577328270.0,"I'm in this boat too. I took out a lot of loans during college because I was only making minimum wage and my family didn’t help. I used loan $ for food, car expenses, etc. living off campus because I thought it was cheaper, but I probably would’ve been better off on campus. I used loan $ on books and computers too and when that fell short I used credit cards. 

I graduated into a recession and got a low paying job that I stayed at for far too long because I hate the whole job hunting process and they offered some minimal advancement. But it was never enough to make up for all of the debt I ran up. Whenever the car would break or I had a medical bill (lots of dental issues) it would go on credit because I had no emergency fund. 

Eventually I was able to get a better paying job and pay a large portion of my debts, but I'm still working on it two decades later. A lot of the people I grew up with skipped college because they didn’t want to go into debt and there are very mixed results; some went into trades and are doing great but the others are still working the same ""teenager jobs"" they had before. 

If I had it to do over again I would still have to use loans and credit, but I would start at the cheap school instead of the fancy one and then job hop more to get more pay after graduation."
pics,fc0slg0,t1_fc0nzsk,1577298706.0,"The USA will probably not go full single payer but rather use a hybrid approach where basics are covered for everyone and extras are through a commercial plan. Like Medicare and Medicare supplemental plans are now for seniors. Your employer will be relieved of the burden of paying for your basic plan and may decide to offer a supplemental plan as a benefit. This would be for things like a private hospital room, wider range of in-network doctor choices, and better Rx coverage (viagra, new drugs that don’t have generics, etc.).

Most Americans pay something out of pocket for premiums, deductibles, and copays so if you aren’t paying those at all by some miracle then your taxes will probably go up. But then so should your pay when that enormous burden is taken off of your employer. More likely though is that they will come up with some reason they can’t pay you more."
