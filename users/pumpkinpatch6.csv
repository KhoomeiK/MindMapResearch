hoarding,feggkwn,t3_eowr6a,1579092064.0,"I‚Äôve found the more you clean, the easier it gets. I bet by Saturday you could have quite a bit done that might make the situation more manageable. Perhaps consider your options once you‚Äôve finished your pre-cleaning. Little wins, like tossing the pizza boxes, can be addicting and propel you onto the next win.

I do appreciate your effort to tidy before leaving. My mother left us very recently and I have had to clean out the apartment. It smells so bad you can taste it. I spent all of last year cleaning my home and now it‚Äôs filling up with boxes of her stuff and her furniture and things we‚Äôll have to sell. I have to turn the apartment over to the landlord and apologize for stains and damages I didn‚Äôt cause. I have to sort, scrub, vacuum and try not to gag for hours every day.

I gently offered to help her clean a few times, of course she said no. She was reluctant to let me come over, and I didn‚Äôt know it was this bad, but I was totally ready to jump in and make an improvement. All I can think about when I‚Äôm over there is how she wouldn‚Äôt let me clean her apartment, but now I‚Äôm cleaning her apartment. She could have lived much more comfortably if she would‚Äôve let me clean. Instead I‚Äôm knee deep in her mess all by myself (with the clock ticking), finding things she wouldn‚Äôt want me to see and finding things that I have no idea what they are so they won‚Äôt get properly valued or re-homed. 

I think anyone in your situation should look into something like Swedish Death Cleaning, where one prepares their things before passing. It gives you a fresh perspective on what you should keep and what you should toss or donate. And it sounds like you‚Äôre already doing a bit of that, which is great. Maybe you‚Äôll find peace in the cleaning process and reconsider your situation. Or maybe we won‚Äôt see you after Saturday, and that‚Äôs your choice to make, I won‚Äôt judge. I‚Äôm just saying thank you for realizing that the cleanup needs to happen and it‚Äôs going to happen either way- I wanted to point out that you‚Äôve already made huge progress by posting and cleaning, and you could take it all the way if you want to. Best of luck to you."
