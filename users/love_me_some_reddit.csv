AskDocs,ff0jd7k,t1_ff08duu,1579469444.0,"> hypogonadism 

I have that and I am pretty much just like the OP. My bits pieces retract just like OP's.  TRT has helped me a bit with the penis retraction, my balls never recovered.  TRT makes them even smaller.  For some reason I really don't care so much about it anymore since I have been on testosterone.  QOL is unbelievably improved with TRT."
depression,fda6m59,t1_fd71a5w,1578242308.0,I agree.  It was way different in the 80's.

depression,fd4iv71,t3_ejw74l,1578167848.0,"I'm 42 now.  You never stop thinking about the good old days.  By the way, I have underwear older than you.  

As you get older you laugh more about how you acted at 13,14,15 and so on.  

I had a rough time growing up being a disabled child in public school. Picked on bullied, you name it.  Some kid even shit in my lunch bag.

I can laugh about it all now.  At 42 I'm the happiest I have ever been.  I have my moments for sure, and I will always have some depression.  I fill my life with positive people only.  I smile and say hello to strangers.  Sometimes I buy the person behind me their coffee."

AskDocs,fcokhm3,t1_fcok43u,1577834509.0,Thanks a lot.  I'm giving this a try!
modernwarfare,fcohevz,t3_ei9zsp,1577832290.0,"I fixed my issues with cod and discord by putting modern warfare on cores 0-2 and discord on core 3.  That will fix your voice issue, but you are losing a core for cod. I think with hyper threading you will be just fine."
AskDocs,fcnrfdk,t1_fcnprnh,1577817014.0,"Well I was at one of my post op appointments with my urologist. I had what was called a mitrofanoff procedure done. I use a catheter in my belly to empty my bladder. 

Anyways, she asked me how things were going and I just broke down. I told her I was too tired to deal with all this and I needed mental help. She ordered a testosterone test, and a free testosterone test and then sent me to a therapist that same day.  The test came back very low. 28 free test and 120 or 140 total. She then referred me to a   colleague that has experience with trt. 

I have never felt better since starting it. I dont have it right now because it was too expensive for me but I got some money for Christmas and I'm going to treat myself to six months worth lol"
AskDocs,fcnq0zp,t1_fcnna67,1577816270.0,I tried injections. I spiked really high to 1100 testosterone  up from 140. That was 200 mg every two weeks. What do they have you on every week? What are your levels?
AskDocs,fcnpmm5,t1_fcnntyq,1577816053.0,I have no idea. I do know they check my  Estrogen levels often. I see my urologist at the cleveland clinic for my trt. I would start with a GP and see if they can refer you to someone that knows what to look for.
AskDocs,fcnh9qc,t1_fcngstq,1577811676.0,"Yeah, they are everywhere.  And with the rise of self diagnosis because of the internet it's big business.  They want you thinking that it's harmless to try, when the risk of heart attack and blood clots increase a lot and you need to have some well trained eyes watching your progress."
AskDocs,fcnbcaa,t1_fcn1x50,1577807965.0,"I have hypogonadism as a side effect from spina bifida. I didn't have much interest in sex at all.  With testosterone cream I can't leave my girlfriend alone.  The other symptoms were depression, and I could not get quality sleep.  Oh and of course erections were a no go.

Getting my levels to where the results fit best for me was hard.  My T went way too high at first and it was horrible. Now that I use a smaller dose of the cream It's keeping my levels around 380.  That is where I seem to feel the best.  

They watch me very closely, and anyone that just puts you on TRT on a whim is not someone you want see."
funny,fc25aih,t3_efpft8,1577341042.0,I'm just like you and I got running shoes from my brother in law.  Fucker.
aww,fc1vl3d,t3_efkdyj,1577331085.0,Awww.  This makes me think of my dog Winston.  I lost him in 2013 and every Christmas I watch the videos I have of him.  So glad you got another Christmas with your dog.
HumansBeingBros,fc0fq6j,t3_efglj4,1577289722.0,This was a great video.  Not sure about the music choice.  I am 42 though.
