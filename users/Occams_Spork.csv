Buddhism is an expansive religion/ideology...it seems like a quite a few of the practitioners hold multiple faiths...so it's understandable that it's so varied and mutated.  

Not sure what it's proven beyond maybe analyzing some human drives, behavior and emotional realities. 

But some subsets of it make claims about reincarnation and shit.... funny enough those are often the worst.  Those societies apparently treat people with malformations and disabilities extremely badly.  They view their disability as a karmic punishment from so past life's misdeed.  So their suffering is often met with total apathy mixed with active hatred.
