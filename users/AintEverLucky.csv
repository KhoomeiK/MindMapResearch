Except for the untitled Nickelodeon show in development, all of these are airing or will air on CBS All Access. Which makes me think, maybe they actually can build an audience through sheer *supply* of Trek shows.

I mean, the more different Trek shows there are, the more reasons people who don't already subscribe to CBSAA have to sign up, even if it's just for a couple months every year or so. If TOS was your favorite era of Trek, maybe Pike's Enterprise and S1/S2 of Disco will be up your alley. If TNG is more your jam, here's Picard. If you want a spies-with-phasers thriller, Section 31 is on its way. 

And who knows, once you've already paid for a month to get caught up on your Trek show of choice, maybe you'll try one or more of the others ... and eventually, maybe you'll decide you like em all & just stay subscribed so you never miss any Trek ep"

StarTrekTimelines,ffdffqz,t1_ffde8g0,1579819752.0,"yah I'm kinda wondering about that myself.  But I think it will be OK

It's not so much the number of simultaneous shows, as the number of episodes to absorb in a given year. Back when you had full 25-ish episode ""overlap"" seasons of TNG + DS9, or DS9 + VOY (not sure if VOY + ENT overlapped) ... that was more than 50 hours of new Trek coming out every year. easy to get burned out that way

Right now we have Disco and Picard, for about 10 eps each. Sec31 is looking similar.  They could add Pike's Enterprise and Lower Decks for 10 eps each, and it still wouldn't quite hit those burnout levels. (esp since Lower Decks will be 30-min eps, I think)"

StarTrekTimelines,ffd98f5,t1_ffcq376,1579815905.0,"hey there.  I just finished 21 runs to hit 130k for my 3rd Shelby; got the full 6k Victory Points on each run & always chose the prize box, never needed to take the ship heal

here's what I used:

**Ship -- D'kora Krayton at Level 10/10**. If you don't have a 10/10 Krayton then I would suggest your 5-star ship that's the highest level; maybe a Prakesh, HMS Bounty or Borg Cube.

-- The Krayton's ""red"" ability speeds up timers on all your other abilities by 2 secs by default, or 4 secs or even 6 secs if you charge it up. I find 4 secs usually does the trick.

-- Its ""yellow"" ability is a 350% instant-damage. Save it until after you've boosted your ATK with a red ability & it will hit em hard.

-- Its ""blue"" ability repairs your hull by 15%. This works very well to keep your health topped off so you can safely pick the prize box after every round. Just gotta remember to save it until your hull is damaged by 15+ percent so you don't overheal.

**Seat 1 -- Augment Riker**. He's Event Crew so that ensures on Epic runs, you'll get 1000 VPs on Stages 1 to 4 and 2000 VPs on Stage 5. If you don't have Augment Riker (or Belle Q as a reward from last week), I suggest slotting in a Riker variant or someone with the Q trait. That way you'll get 85% of the max points, until you hit 6500 VPs for your first copy of Shelby. Then slot her in.

**Seat 2 -- Professor Scott**. ""Blue"" insta-damage, plus the ENG stat so he'll get full equipment bonuses.

**Seat 3 -- Waitress Ezri**. ""Yellow"" insta-damage, plus the DIP stat so she'll get full equipment bonuses.

**Seat 4 -- Garth of Izar**. ""Red"" insta-damage, plus the SEC stat so he'll get full equipment bonuses. He has a 6-second spin-up so you can just use the ship's red ability to boost your base ATK, fire Garth, then Ezri to keep your ACC high, then Scotty. You can only use Garth twice per battle, but usually OtherShip will be dead before you even need the second.

Lemme know if you have any other Qs  O:-)"

StarTrekTimelines,ffcow8h,t3_esw9e2,1579804070.0,"leaving aside the offer's financial aspects for a moment, some interesting design choices here...

* ""Lunar New Year"" refers to the annual observance of what Western society used to call ""Chinese New Year""

* Georghiou in all her variants is portrayed by Michelle Yeoh, an actress with Chinese and Malaysian heritage. ( https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Michelle_Yeoh )

* The offer includes **888** dil and **888,888 credits**. per Wikipedia, ""Eight is considered a lucky number in Chinese culture because it sounds like the word meaning 'to generate wealth'."" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8#As_a_lucky_number )

Now, turning back to the financials... (N.B. that I'm in the U.S. and so will use USD prices for comparison)

The game shop's normal, everyday offer for Dil is $9.99 for 900 crystals (actually the offer is 700, but you get +200 in bonus crystals) and it comes bundled with 500 VIP points. So if we consider 888 dil as being close enough to 900 as makes no difference, everything else in the special is pure gravy.

We all know what ~1MM credits is worth; now that the Honor Sale is over, a Legendary Citation is back to being worth a full 50k honor; and then there's the Emperor card itself -- a solid Tier 5 in the pre-squish Big Book.

Her one bright spot appears to be her CMD stat -- its base value shows up at #7 among Very Rare crew, though with Proficiency rolls she comes in at #11 among her purple peers. Her Battle Stations ability seems to be no great shakes.

And here's the thing about Augment Riker: under the pre-squish BBoBA ratings, he's only a Tier 5, and that's with the J.R. collection and frequent event chances. With as little as Shelby has going for her, I'd venture to guess she would only rate a pre-squish Tier 10.

How do you define ""good voyage"", like 6+ hours? Because going shorter than that could open things up for a few characters with helpful blue/green/gray variants...

Looking at the STT Wiki, here are a few prospects:

-------------

***TOS***

* Spock... comes up 1 MED variant short (boo). You remembered right, Seeking Spock is the only variant with MED. You could do an 11-Spock voyage with one lone, superbly cranky McCoy. 

-------------------

***TNG***

* Riker... comes decently close, needing 3 between SCI and MED. Chef Riker provides 1 of each, but of course he can't fill 2 seats on the same voyage. (By contrast, Picard has no ENG **or** MED variants.)

* Data... has no MED variants, as you noted. The other stats are fine tho

* La Forge... does have 1 MED variant -- Doctor ~~Watson~~ La Forge, natch -- but needs a 2nd. 

--------------------

***DS9***

* **Ben Sisko** gets it done! You can take Conflicted and Ishan Chaye for ENG; Sous Chef & Dr. Noah for MED; and Benny Russell & Solar Sails for SCI. (Solar Sails doubles for ENG and Dr. Noah doubles for SCI, but then you risk leaving some seats unfilled.)

--------------

***VOY***

* Janeway's the only one that could even qualify with 12+ variants; her Determined and Vice Admiral variants give her much-needed ENG, but she has no MED variants.

----------------

***ENT***

* Archer is surprisingly close!  He has 11 variants including **seven** with ENG; if and when he gets a 12th, he should be good-to-go. Just slot the Humbled & Imprinted variants in the MED seats, and Desert & Test Pilot into the SCI ones, and you're golden.

------------

***DIS***

* Burnham's the only one who's even halfway close, with 9 variants. Of course the show's only had two seasons, and short ones by TOS/TNG/DS9 standards. Perhaps with time she'll hit a Dandy Dozen like the toons above."

Always? I have my doubts. Generally movies that bombed in theatrical, also bomb in home video; movies that were hits in theatrical, usually also do well in home video. Yes there are some movies that get reported as ""it bombed in theatrical but it surprised everyone by doing great in home video""; these are the exceptions that prove the rule. I'm not aware that *Tron* was one of those

Using the prices and technology prevalent at the time, the thinking would be more like ""I had no problem paying $3 to see Tron in the theater, but there's no way in hell I want to pay $90 for my own Tron VHS tape."" In case you're too young to remember from personal experience: Back in the 1980s, most movies coming out on VHS were ""priced to rent"", as in, priced so high that generally only Blockbuster & other video rental stores could afford to buy them. (And yes, maybe there were a few superfans who WOULD pay $90 for their own copy; c.f. ""exception that proves the rule"")

> The issue was they always super under performed in merchandise.

For a long time I also thought merch was a big contributor to movies' bottom lines, but recently I've come to learn in most cases, it's just not so. Read this for background: https://stephenfollows.com/how-movies-make-money-hollywood-blockbusters/

In another of Mr. Follows' articles (I don't have the link handy rn) he says that even with animated movies, merch only contributes ~4 percent to the film's overall take. And animated is far & away the most merch-friendly type of films, because when a Frozen comes out, every little kiddo wants Elsa, Anna, Hans or Olaf on their T-shirts, backpacks and sippy cups, not to mention wanting to play with Frozen-themed dolls & other toys. All other genres drop steeply from that 4 percent; outside of the Top 5 (animated, action, thriller, sci-fi & 1 other) it's typically 1 percent or less.

* **Blade Runner 2049** brought back about $122.6MM to its studio, based on numbers from BoxOfficeData, which also stated the film's production budget at $150MM. After prints, ads & promotions, BR2049 lost about $177.4MM in theatrical.

-- Studios typically spend as much on prints, advertising & promotions on a movie, as they did on the production budget. matching it dollar for dollar

-- When a movie earns $1 at the domestic box office, 60% of that goes back to the studios. (The rest stays with the theaters, or with distribution companies & other middlemen)

-- When a movie earns $1 in foreign box office, 40% of that goes back to the studios. (The split is worse overseas because there are more middlemen; in some cases e.g. China the studio doesn't even get 40%, but they figure ""half a loaf is better than none"")

So, on with the math with figures from BoxOfficeMojo:

* **Tron** earned $33MM in 1982, all of it domestically. Disney got back ~$19.8MM of that, after spending $17MM on production and another $17MM on prints, ads & promotions. That yields a loss of $14.2MM in theatrical; maybe the overall project reached break-even once merchandising and ancilliaries (VHS & later DVD sales, broadcast rights, etc.) are accounted for. But then again, maybe not.

* **Tron Legacy** earned $172MM domestically in 2010, and $228MM abroad. Disney got back ~$194.4MM of that, after spending $170MM on production and another $170MM on prints, ads & promotions. That yields a loss of $145.6MM in theatrical; I find it unlikely that the merchandising and ancilliaries on this one could have dragged it to break-even.
