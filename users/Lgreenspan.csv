askdrugs,ff5yug5,t3_eqxl67,1579614635.0,"Not likely... Atypical Antipsychotics... Seroquel, Olanzapine, Risperdal, etc... are usually the culprits."
askdrugs,ff5rioq,t3_ero7un,1579607422.0,"Benzos and Barbiturates certainly have a track record for causing far more destructive issues than only sleeping 4-5 hours nightly. Tolerance also builds very quickly. 
Things like Seroquel and Mirtazapine have a high rate of efficacy in those that do not find relief in the benzos, barbiturates and z drugs. And while not devoid of a litany of side effects themselves, they‚Äôre *relatively* less likely to be as destructive as the GABA Agonists when stopped. 
I‚Äôve gone down the rabbit hole with all of them at one point or another. Seroquel worked best for me overall."

AskAnAmerican,fewhro3,t3_eqqvyx,1579410810.0,"Because many of us proud Americans are of the belief that the US is the center of the universe and the only worthwhile place to ever experience, sadly."
AskAnAmerican,fewhfcp,t3_eqrlho,1579410628.0,The US Government‚Äôs official spelling of the word *war* is ‚ÄúW-I-N‚Äù.
opiates,fea2g1k,t3_eo7bcz,1578943701.0,You are not the person your friend used to know. You‚Äôre an addict. The only thing you can afford to do right now is to level with yourself. Get some help. Give your buddy is friend back. He will accept your apology.
addiction,fe69t3w,t3_enr0xn,1578884983.0,"I struggle daily and I‚Äôve finally begun to understand why I can‚Äôt beat this. 
*The only coping skill I‚Äôve ever known is that drugs are my coping skill* 
I cope by using and I cope with my destructive using by using more. 
Talk to someone. Start small and take deliberate steps to learn to cope. 
I feel your frustration. I‚Äôm getting to a desperate point myself. 
You‚Äôre strong. And you will overcome this."

dogswithjobs,fddz3fg,t1_fdd2tsc,1578327456.0,Got it- Thank you for sending this.

askhotels,fddqplo,t3_cr7ahz,1578321451.0,I spend 20% of my time explaining the seemingly inexplainable story of authorizations vs payments vs incidental holds to guests that are absolutely convinced that I personally charged them double. In theory it seems pretty simple from my side of the desk. But in practice it‚Äôs more complex than organic chemistry. And once they finally get it... they ask me to break down why we charge 16% tax followed by the dreaded ‚Äúwhat does the resort fee cover‚Äù? üòí
askhotels,fddq0ir,t3_d3z7l9,1578320875.0,Additionally- you have six couples that intentionally picked Friday the 13th as their wedding date. Those people are already a little nutty I‚Äôd think. The full moon is just a happy accident... I‚Äôd love to read your shift recap email...
askhotels,fddm8xv,t3_ekifi3,1578317546.0,"Rooms Division Manager for luxury property here. I‚Äôd suggest you target smaller, boutique brands or privately owned. Have a great resume. Apply for an appropriate position. Try to get in on the rooms side. Front desk, sales, reservations or PBX operator. If you work hard, take ownership, prioritize reliability / punctuality and take the initiative to engage guests and colleagues... you will move up and succeed. 
I love what I do. Wouldn‚Äôt trade it."

Bulldogs,fc5g3xj,t3_egbpnf,1577456605.0,I should add... he was asleep when I put it on.
