He has found them because of the cursed bell that is a relic that gives you 3 relics in exchange of having a curse you cannot remove in your deck"
science,ff5z86q,t1_ff5ti70,1579614943.0,Wait it might have saved your mom that this is getting no press? Or is that sacarsm? I'm actually completely new about this and I lack the context  so if you care to explain I would appreciate it
science,ff5kp1n,t1_ff5ifdj,1579597520.0,"its not only about the goverment here, we as society put a lot of pressure making climate friendly Techs and systems a trend. We live in a world dominated by people that want to sell us things to gain power, and when we make of all of this a trend suddenly companies are gonna be interested on showing how climate friendly they are because thats pontential sales and competitive advantage against their oponent. I think we not only have the obligaiton to make presurre on our goverments but to be sure to demand ourselves some guarantees from companies and boycott/show when they dont do it. 

We as human beens are a big echo chamber so every little debate and shoutout we do is helping change the situation. 

remember the theoretical manifestation of power is money, and remember who has that."
slaythespire,ff49j6f,t1_ff17j9a,1579558494.0,Today I defeated them (I know 2 wins in a row I feel powerful) and I realized it's kinda helpful to go for the donut first as he keeps rising the strength they have
slaythespire,ff46dsz,t1_ff42yld,1579556535.0,"Thanks!!

Yep I tend to avoid the elites on the third as I noticed they can bring a real risk to a almost secure game by that time. And I only go for the first in the second if all."

news,fejbcq1,t1_fej512s,1579165421.0,"well idk about this case and im talking out of pure emotion because this is an outraging thing but that guy shoudnt even have a bail. there is no price you can pay to abuse anybody you know, he should be going straight to jail."
SnapChad,feja07z,t1_fei4d3d,1579163481.0,"well, me and my SO are currently really far away so i talk from experience when i say, they can be as hot as any other hot photo. But you have to want it, like for real . it doesnt matter that much the type of nude the two in the end its just so you can like imagine it in some way?.

The problem is having a unrequested one. Cause it just seems like the other part is trying to have some sexual activity without consulting you or something, like it doesnt feel like we are having fun and we want to have sex it seems like you want to have sex and dont care about wheter i want it too"
news,fej9ojq,t1_fej63pa,1579163035.0,"well it depends and idk hows that in the us but in some (really rare) schools in my country(Spain) there are priest teaching but you have to take into account that when catholic priests do seminar they also are forced to study an actual career at that seminar (like a lot of them do philosophy, Biology or some Science branch related thing).  so some of them are actually qualified to teach in their fields and some religious schools take them. but this is no the rule, atleast in big cities that are mostly atheist like Madrid or Barcelona.  

&#x200B;

You have to be searching for it too and there arent any public religious schools, so thats that."

wholesomememes,fdgedi7,t1_fdgdx8s,1578392830.0,"well i see your point but i strongly disagree with the word plague, i think in a balance of the things we have acomplished as species we are outstanding and there is so much beautiful and good people in the world for me to consider our fellow a plague. We are still animals, and sometimes we can do terrible things for some really silly reasons. But to quote one of my favourites quotes from true detective :   “Well, once there was only dark. You ask me, the light’s winning.” 

its only my way of seeing things, but i understand your point. Have a good day sir"
wholesomememes,fdgdr6a,t1_fdgd5bf,1578391948.0,"we are nothing compared to the world. yes we can kill or destroy what we consider beautiful. So can an random asteroid, the only ones who consider this a big deal are the actual humans. we are nothing to the world but sometimes some of us can be terrible for the rest of our species."
