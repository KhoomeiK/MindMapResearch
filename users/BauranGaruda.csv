The founding fathers with their wisdom realized that in order for the will of ALL the states get equal representation they had to develop a system that doesn't ignore the ""flyover states"". 

A straight popular vote system would lead to New York and California dictating the rest of the country's direction. While I agree that 1:1 vote system sounds good the founders knew that if they allowed that then it would eventually end with animosity.

Edited to add: I would only get behind a straight democratic country is if voting was compulsory and mandated by law. *Thats* the only way for a straight democratic country to ensure *""all people matter""* as you've stated in several posts. So if we make every citizen, who is legal resident, vote or face some sort of penalty then yes, you can have a popular vote democratic country."

Religion is a comfortable myth for most people, nothing more.

Zealots of any religion, hell, any group, do exist though and should be shamed and condemned as terrible people. Just saying that we shouldn’t judge every person of a religion based on the actions of a few. It’s *why* the crazies of Islam that kill people in the name of their religion aren’t used to lump all Muslims together. Don’t get why Christianity isn’t extended the same courtesy.

We realize as a society that it’s disingenuous to be bigoted against all Muslims and we only talk about and down to the few that are calling for the death of nonbelievers. So I agree, Christians are picked on more than any other religion, but I don’t know why.

There is no hand holding, no tutorial, you're just plopped in a starting city with cloths and a meager weapon and told ""figure it out stupid"".

NM's, long pop times, weird NM pop requirements, Absolute Virtue, hell even some of the maps are mazes just for the hell of it.

In spite of all that the player base goes through all the motions, follows all the steps, and continues to play and have fun doing it. What's my point?

However, and I wish more would get this, that dude swinging on him is the same as the potential victim walking up to a lgbtq parade and punching someone saying “we’re here, we’re queer, get used to it!”

Both are absolutely fundamentally wrong! You do not swing on people for disagreeing with you, period. Everyone needs to get that.

Unless they are straight up inciting violence then you’re wrong, and EVEN if they are, it’s not your place to police it, report it to authorities, that’s it.

To many people forget that popular opinion is just that, popular, and it ebbs and flows all the time. What you consider right is fleeting."
instantkarma,fefybz4,t1_fefqpam,1579069341.0,"Sorry it’s just not, what you are advocating for is a totalitarian state. The thing is you can never guarantee that the majority believes as you do. What you feel justified in trying to squash through force may one day be used to squash your voice.

There are far to many examples of just that happening around the world, even today. What we should tolerate is everyone’s right to an opinion but combat it through dialogue. No one ever bends the knee to those telling them they are wrong, they either die on the knee or bide their time till they can stand. 

That has been true through time of both morally right and terribly wrong opinions, at the end of the day though they have always been people, and people never change their view at the face of violence. They just don’t."

With the exception that speech *incites* violence, as in “go punch that dude” incites violence, not “that dude said something I don’t like, imma punch him”.

If you advocate people just punching anyone who doesn’t agree with you that means you also support someone knocking you out for something you say that *they* don’t like. Can’t have it both ways my dude."

It’s why Snickers and sea monkeys was all the rage back in the 90’s when comics were a $1.75 - $1.99. 

They tried all that advertising and guess what, people complained, and to be fair they didn’t stop but they did try. It’s why Marvel, the pinnacle of cinema today was all but bankrupt and sold off everything but the furniture to stay open. Why is it you think Spider-Man, who has been an Avenger since at least the 90’s (way back when Blade was all the rage in theaters), was disputed no less than a year ago?"
