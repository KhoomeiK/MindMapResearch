In addition, you have to plead guilty in order to accept a deal; in this case Swartz would have had to have pleaded guilty to 13 federal crimes, most of which (in the opinion of many) were completely spurious.

Burlington, VT 05401ðŸ“·12/23/2019

I've stayed here once and was totally ignored by everyone. Now after living in Burlington for over a year, I will stop in on my morning walks for a free coffee. The staff has been polite but haven't asked me any questions except for one incident where I was asked to leave just for having my backpack on. They asked me if I was staying in the hotel and ""what my room number was."" I think they're too conservative and they discriminate against poor people. Don't stay here if you don't want to be in an anti-social environment. The manager yelled at me like a crazy person and threatened to call the police after I told him that I wasn't staying there, and that was probably one of the first times I stopped by the hotel, and it was probably only 8:00 in the morning. Just weird. (I'm not 80 years old, I'm only 23, but still, I wasn't doing anything wrong.)"
