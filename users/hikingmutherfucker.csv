vinyl,ff92up5,t3_es2foq,1579703485.0,"I am 51 years of age.  

Grew up listening to vinyl.  First album was ""Sold our Soul for Rockn'Roll"" by Black Sabbath.   
 Did not go over to CD till about 1996.  Still had my Smiths LPs and Hüsker Dü and Minutemen albums from my college days.  Kept just a few LPs for sentimental reasons and never thought about vinyl again after CDs took over.

Then my father got terribly sick Cancer this was this year 10 years ago and he brought my grandfather's records.  My grandfather was a manager of a country station in my home town and connected in the business of country.  700+ albums.  I was just really getting into alt-country and roots music so it amazing.  Of course considering the heritage of passing down something like this it was amazing anyway just a great coincidence as well.

So here I am listening to everything from old tyme country to punk rock or to early 80s mostly american independent bands and modern indie music and now just in the last 3 years or so gone bat shit crazy getting into jazz.

When I got back into it I started with a Technics SL-B2 first but when the speed started slipping snagged a Pro-Ject Debut iii which I just recently upgraded to a VPI Cliffwood."

movies,ff2tug2,t1_ff2ts5f,1579523923.0,What was wrong with his acting in that film? I  thought it was some of his strongest work despite the fact was not a big fan of the overall movie itself.
Vinyl_Jazz,ff2q199,t1_ff2b6ps,1579518735.0,Yeah I got that one on Tone Poet it is really good and hot but Sidewinder just smokes right from the start and swings throughout.  Sidewinder is one that is so good I put it on my list of albums when I reply to people asking me what they should listen to if they are first getting into jazz.  It is just step above to classic imho.
Vinyl_Jazz,ff2akup,t1_ff2a9e0,1579498787.0,"Customer service is always good at Music Matters Carol is great!!

I have a poor digital copy of Moanin so saving it up next few weeks nice and slow and getting that one and then Maiden Voyage.  Was very tempted to replace my Sidewinder by Lee Morgan but listened to my copy and realized I needed to get the heck off of the fact the sleeve is not in great condition because the media sounded excellent so just two this year for me!   

Wish they would repress last year’s releases because I missed out on Wayne Shorter’s “Adam’s Apple” and that is still bugging me hahahahaha!

Happy listening man!!"

turntables,fez2npz,t1_fez05km,1579453292.0,"Man i personally think it is ok to know what you want and the Dynavector  cartridge seems to be all over the VPI Facebook forum as a choice and really excellent cartridge!  

If I say read reviews it sounds silly because you do not read negative reviews out there right??  What I like to do instead is read reviews looking for keywords like for me warm lush and smooth when it comes to a cartridge and others might look for things like ton of clarity extended highs etc .. knowing what you like in your sound and your system lets you look at reviews with a more forgive the pun critical eye.

Edit:  nice setup!!!"
turntables,feyz8rd,t1_feyuyh3,1579452334.0,"I am of the opinion the two biggest places to hear increases due to upgrades is in the extreme of the signal chain.  Outside of room treatment and speaker placement either an upgrade of the speakers or the cartridge (maybe stylus) will give you the most bang for your buck in terms of improvement to your sound.  This is all IMHO and ymmv and all that.  

Plus the 20x2 is a well regarded cartridge to boot!

In that price range I like the Sumiko Songbird at $899 and I really want to hear the well thought of SoundSmith Carmen at $999 and almost everyone likes the Hana ML at $1200.

Then again if you like Dynavector the 20x20 is supposed to be the damn awesome sauce."
turntables,feyxt13,t3_eqy30i,1579451757.0,"The VM95ML is one of the sweet spots for value/price/performance in this range have a friend who went right away to this stylus when he bought a deck with the VM95E and he is way happy.  

It all depends on your level of comfort in setting up a new cartridge on your deck.  You are used to it and have no worries setting up a new cartridge hard NOT to recommend the Nagaoka MP-110.  I know someone else that has this set up on a $2k VPI Scout and I have heard that setup.  

Yeah it is top of the game great balance of clarity in the extremes good separation of instruments and warm defined midrange response.  There is a reason you have heard so much online about how good this cart is."

Vinyl_Jazz,fepnrcc,t1_fepm8gg,1579325467.0,"Just listened again to my copy of “Sidewinder” 70s late Blue Note repress and .. hold on .. wait for it .. it is really really good.  

I would just be wasting money objectively
speaking replacing it.  But I do have two from this list I will snag.  I get it the Tone Poet and excellent Blue Note 80 stuff for the rare and barely reissued albums and for the classics?  Well pony up the money here are the choice reissues for those of us who never find NM- RVG NY/Liberty Blue Notes under $75.  I really need to get more patient because I have had a few folks saying they can find pre 70s Blue Notes for lower than Music Matters prices but I never seem to except VG- copies"

Vinyl_Jazz,fepert9,t1_fepekza,1579318697.0,Better luck than I on Discogs!  That is a great set of titles.
Vinyl_Jazz,fepe0n5,t1_fepdewk,1579318186.0,"I have had pretty good luck under $75 on finding mid to late 70s Blue Note pressings some with and without the RVG stamp that sound excellent or Japanese copies in US dealers hands typically without the obi strip.  

Also had pretty good luck finding used Classic Records pressing even of Cannonball Adderley’s “Somethin’ Else” and Kenny Burrell’s “Midnight Blue” 

All the classic Blue Notes like the ones in this list are hard to find in early pressings under $75 in decent condition anyways.  

Why I am only getting two of the ones on the list this time. I got good Japanese 70s era reissues or Japanese pressings of most on the list."

Vinyl_Jazz,fep85w1,t1_fep7uq1,1579314296.0,Seems like they are hitting the classics that have been out of print in this or that format for them.  Some people will hate this because they already have all of those but it means I get to finally get Art Blakey’s “Moanin’” and replace my old worn 70s copy of Herbie Hancock’s “Maiden Voyage”

Vinyl_Jazz,feoz0tw,t1_feoxqh8,1579308476.0,Yeah I replaced some BN75 stuff with Music Matters versions and of course they are far superior
Vinyl_Jazz,feoyvs0,t1_feoyeee,1579308386.0,I would not personally all the 33 1/3 rpm Music Matters are all choice!  Definitely getting Moanin and Maiden Voyage but I got nice copies of most of everything else just bought a nice copy of Speak No Evil King Records Japanese pressing and my 70s version of Sidewinder is tempting but copy I have is in excellent shape.
Vinyl_Jazz,feoxur9,t1_feoxflk,1579307745.0,If you go to their new SRX page you can see the price even on the ones not released yet.  Unfortunately most are going to be $74.95 which means I will get Moanin’ finally and replace my ragged out Maiden Voyage but will not be upgrading my copy of Sodewinder which is in great shape a 70s reissue.

Btw beautiful speakers."
audiophile,fejtouj,t3_epe9de,1579185604.0,"I use a an old laptop a family member upgraded from with an upgraded 1TB drive directly to my DAC and others use a Chromecast Audio or other devices to stream from the computer into their home to their system.  Do not over complicate it.  Get a decent DAC for your price range use the Apple Remote app for example and plug everything together and you will be fine man.    

The Klipschorns are legendary speakers experiment and if you need parts Bob Crites is a good source as mentioned by another poster.  If my father passed to me a pair of these speakers I would hold on to them and pass them to my kids.  They are that kind of special imho ymmv and all that.  

Sounds like there might not really be a problem with the speakers and luckily these speakers are really really sensitive so any well-made amp including your AVR can power them.  Btw $800 is not necessarily cheap my Jolida 102CRC was in that price range and that little 20w tube amp can power those speakers so loud the neighbors will be singing along to your tunes.  

If the Denon amp is busted will be easy to find out from your pictures nothing seems wrong but that does not mean a whole lot.  You got some good gear sir enjoy in memory of the family you cherished and lost."

ELAC - Debut 2.0 B6.2 are like $350 which gives you more room for looking for a subwoofer.  

KEF Q150 bookshelves for like $600 are another to look at. 

Also look for deals and sales like MusicDirect has a deal on the Wharfedale  - Denton 80th for like $500 and they used to go for like $1k.

Or the same place has the big tower speaker DALI - Zensor 5 Tower Speakers for like $599 for example.

And speaking of tower speakers there is always the ELAC - Debut 2.0 F5.2 for example at $699.  

KEF Q550 at $559 is well liked as well big speakers well respected brand.

These are all just examples best deal is to go out and listen to some speakers if you can.  And judge your own tastes.

Btw this is all new buying used can get you a hell of a deal if you live in a metro area.  This is really useful if you go out and listen and the speakers you like are just out of your price range.

ELAC and KEF and Wharfedale and Dali are all good brands you might want to check out."

Nothing will improve your sound more than a speaker upgrade.  

This is simple advice repeated on every audiophile forum and /r/audiophile.  Why?  Because it is true good speakers and the room those speakers live in are the two biggest influences on your overall sound.  

You ain’t got the money for speakers then with vinyl look at the far extreme of the signal chain and upgrade either the cartridge or sometimes the stylus.  If you got one of the new Audio Technica VM95e carts you do not even have to replace the entire cart just the stylus and seriously I mean freaking seriously upgrade the sound.  In the new Audio Technica 95 line the two sweet spot are from review the VM95e and the VM95ML.  You can snag that stylus for $149."

turntables,fdgu4gg,t1_fdgt517,1578408374.0,"Yes but I am becoming convinced especially when it comes to LP playback via turntable that the two extremes of the signal chain are still the most important.  The cartridge + stylus and the speakers are the most impactful on the actual quality of the sound you get out of any system with the room playing an integral part.  You can take a simple but solid well reviewed Rega RP-1 or Pro-Ject Debut or whatever and get get incredible superior sound from the stock setup by upgrading the cartridge.  More than switching out amps or phono preamps or anything else except for the speakers.  



I understand your point that the 50% rule is outdated and I am not dismissing that but the importance of really good speakers that fit your listening tastes are incredibly important.  I really think this should never be understated and I think overstating it a tad with the old axiom is not a bad thing.  This is especially the case since many fine awesome super good budget speakers need a subwoofer not just for bass heavy music but to fill the sound out.  This is the case because to my ears many modern speakers tend to almost over-emphasize high frequency detail over a full sound lower mid upper bass response.  

IMHO anyway,  and thanks I like the turntable a lot and the Sumiko Moonstone I just put on influenced a lot of my thinking about the extremes of the signal chain in vinyl playback"

audiophile,fddjy55,t1_fddjfme,1578315222.0,"The famous example during the “loudness wars” was the Beatles albums and how they were progressively compressed and made louder on later reissues of their CD copies squishing their dynamic range.

Then nowadays many of the companies doing hi-res versions are using the original studio masters right?  

The difference the audible difference between comes down to the quality of the source material not the bitrate to a certain point once you get to the old 128mbps mp3s I do not know about you but according to tests I could pick them out but not 320mbps or above - not if both files used the same source material throughout."
audiophile,fddiv91,t1_fddi9zz,1578314056.0,"I came here to say this 320mbps mp3 is very hard to discern from CD quality rips and unless the hi-res is from the original non-compressed studio masters and from a better mix that the mp3 or the CD rip you are not going to hear a difference.  

As an aside when someone says their hi-res copy of said album sounds better if you dig hard enough it is usually the difference in the quality of the version of the copy.  I mean it is the difference between a typically analog to digital of an original master and a CD rip of a latter remastered compressed CD copy of the same musical work.  Yeah it sounds better because one version of the song was butchered and compressed and the other is a copy of the original from the studio."

Sidewinder - Lee Morgan (never on enough lists)

Time Out - Dave Brubeck (uber chill super classic)

Blue Train - John Coltrane (I feel this is more accessible than A Love Supreme or My Favorite Things is another standard)

Ah Uhm - Charles Mingus (the most accessible Mingus album that really shows his brilliance)

Saxophone Collosus - Sonny Rollins (Strode Rode is one of my fav go to songs for testing out systems)

Speak No Evil - Wayne Shorter (whole album is insane and wonderful and listenable)

Something Else - Cannonball Adderly (it's a classic it's hot and fun sounding and has a ton of greats represented)

Moanin - Art Blakley and the Jazz Messengers (such a classic but do not tell anyone but I almost like Mosaic better - oops I will deny that if you guys tell anyone)

Herbie Hancock - Maiden Voyage (Sunday night chill time fav of mine)

Kind of Blue - Miles Davis (how many folks come out on /r/jazz or here saying I heard this album and have to know about jazz?? - for a lot of folks the irony is the start of modal jazz is their gateway to the beauty of jazz which is neat but odd)"

When we did pork ribs the sugar was primarily honey not molasses which gave it a different taste than say for example Texas ribs."

AskReddit,fdcq9kq,t1_fdcpaux,1578281335.0,"The creole and Cajun cuisines were in favor or vogue in the 80s and have been forgotten in the US for many fusion cuisines of the western and west coast states from Texas-mex southwestern dishes to East meets west fusion dishes on the west coast.  

However I am from the south and was taught how to cook Cajun from a manager I had from Baton Rouge La when she found out my grandfather owned a BBQ restaurant in Ga.  

I listed the big dishes but it is a mix primarily of French and Spanish and here is the wild part like all southern cuisines yes African influences.  The famous muffuletta sandwich is even an Italian inspiration.  There are a lot of incredible dishes from famous beignets in the morning to the barely known but exquisite Trout Meunière which I have had only once and never heard anyone outside of Louisiana ever mention."

If something from this cuisine is not on the UNESCO list it should be."

Think they are the same type of connectors

vinyl,fd5xuas,t1_fd5wrll,1578182867.0,He also said he was not a big fan of the Concept cartridge which I cannot blame him I have heard the thing and kind of went -meh- and yes on the ClearAudio Concept table which my local stereo store has.  Someone on the VPI Facebook group says his sounds great once it was broken in but never impressed me.  It is about the same price range as my cartridge the Sumiko Moonstone $299 the Concept is like $250.  The cart I have and the legendary Denon DL-103 are the two best stock cartridges in the same price as the Concept imho ymmv and all that.  And no I have not heard the Nagaoka MP-150 which is supposed to be lovely.
vinyl,fd5ro89,t1_fd5qxwx,1578180728.0,"Thanks!

My price point was not quite this high stuck with a Sumiko Moonstone that the analog planet guy Fremer reviewed a while back.  It was an easy upgrade from my Sumiko Olympia and the new Sumiko MM carts are good.  

The Sumiko Songbird at $899 is my favorite like that one so so good."
vinyl,fd5nh2e,t1_fd5lxfv,1578179383.0,"At $500 if OP likes Grado I would say skip Statement stuff until you can afford the Grado Sonata at $600 is the only wooden body Grado cartridges I think is worth the money you pay and fucking rocks - my favorite Grado.

Grado Gold is awesome and I love the warmth but find it could be more detailed on the highs but with a $500 budget you could get the Gold and add a Grado 8mV stylus which will make it sound more detailed and refined.  And that is a $150 stylus on a $265 cartridge which works."
vinyl,fd5gx5l,t1_fd4dzuw,1578177513.0,"$500 well then you might want to look at the Nagaoka MP-200 like $409

Hana EH like $475 

Denon DL-103R for $450

Sound Smith Otello for $399

Or one of my favs:


Sumiko Blue Point Special EVO-III High Output MC Cartridge for $549 oh so good"
