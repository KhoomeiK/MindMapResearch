What I mean is I often feel like my back, legs and the rest can handle a heavier deadlift, but my grip gives up"

bulletjournal,fd0wu9k,t1_fcz8i8k,1578124839.0,Thank you! I did and I would not recommend doing that üòÖ The paper held up slightly worse than I hoped - the middle section bled through a lot
bulletjournal,fcz4e92,t1_fcypbx3,1578093435.0,"Thank you so much!

I'll try to stick to the Tarot / occult theme but in reality I'll probably won't do a spread again in a few months 'cos life üòû

I really enjoyed a post Xmas / NY downtime tho. Happy to use this time to draw my heart out and try new things.

bulletjournal,fcxpvfi,t1_fcxl90q,1578068651.0,Thank you! I got mine off Amazon

bulletjournal,fcuf6ai,t1_fcue9de,1577979481.0,"Nope, they are 160gsm. No bleeding or ghosting with any water-based markers or brushes. Something like Copic markers will bleed, but they'd bleed through cardboard prob ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

A&O are one of the most expensive, especially if you ship outside the US but so so worth it! The cover designs are beautiful too"
bulletjournal,fcue1h3,t1_fcudvto,1577978753.0,Archer & Olive! I've tried a bunch but these notebooks are my favourite by far.
