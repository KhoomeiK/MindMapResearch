AskMen,feokp50,t3_eq1iti,1579301487.0,"I recently dated someone who has BPD. I understood that although his reactions were intense, his feelings were still his. 

However, as soon as I saw that he wasn’t working on himself (ie therapy and mixing medication with massive amounts of alcohol) I became a lot less understanding and patient."

I have a therapist with whom I’ve never discussed the issue with. So, maybe next session I’ll have the guts to talk about it out loud. 

Thank you for your response ♥️"

AskWomen,fbhbmy3,t1_fbg3yyf,1576869840.0,"I got the same advice from my mom when I was 9. 

I knew then I didn’t want to “marry rich”. I wanted to work and be successful myself. 

My advice to my future children will be the complete opposite. 
“Stand up for yourself and create boundaries.”
“Never rely on someone else’s success for your happiness. You need to create your own.”
“Be with someone you love and who compliments your life positively.”"
