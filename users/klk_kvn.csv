bipolar,fd5tczh,t3_ejzu6z,1578181284.0,gained 30lb on it after three months. But remember that everyone reacts differently!
stopdrinking,fcy8way,t3_ejfky5,1578076497.0,"I am soooo proud of you! I'm a little over a month sober, still a little sober baby but getting there. If you don't mind me asking, what were the hardest parts of those first three months?"
benzodiazepines,fcy8191,t3_ej57jj,1578076088.0,I have bipolar disorder so I can't do regular antidepressants like anxiety like SSRIs/SNRIs or anything else touching serotonin. Hence the benzos. Have worked my way up to 4mg klonopin and have added buspar and propranolol to the mix for anxiety plus some mood stabilizers. They'll prescribe it if they think you need it!
benzodiazepines,fcy6bni,t3_eiu4au,1578075386.0,If only man. That used to be my prescription. Good times...
bipolar,fcj4i7n,t3_ehe11w,1577677074.0,You rock for 100 days!!! So proud :)
benzodiazepines,fc7jve2,t3_egf7q2,1577509749.0,Took 2.5mg klonopin and smoked hella weed all day today
stopdrinking,fc5clht,t3_eg5z8s,1577453374.0,So proud of you!!!
bipolar,fc5cey0,t1_fc321jq,1577453187.0,"I COMPLETELY know what you mean. It used to be the running joke that I’d get more drunk than everyone else and embarrass myself in front of everyone. One thing I’ve done is, before I arrived home on vacation, I told them all that I am no longer drinking. They still push it but I just say I started a medication and they usually back off. Whatever works!"
bipolar,fc2ya52,t1_fc1al9q,1577377228.0,"What a powerful story. For me my alcohol would cause depression that would last forever. It’s interesting too. Once I cut out alcohol I realized people didn’t drink as much as I did either! Same to you if you ever need to talk to someone, though you are FAR more experienced in sobriety than I am :)"
benzodiazepines,fc1ua1k,t1_fc1thqs,1577329918.0,a psychiatrist. I have SEVERE bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety and panic
bipolar,fc1sk2x,t3_ebeoqf,1577328371.0,"1200mg lithium, 30mg abilify, 1200mg trileptal, 4mg klonopin, and 30mg buspar. I know, it's a lot of meds, but this is the most stable I've ever been! I want to cut back though."
Anxiety,fc1ni11,t3_ecjak6,1577324075.0,"What's your BuSpar dose? I personally take a combo of BuSpar 30mg/day, propranolol 10mg PRN, and Klonopin 4mg/day and it works beautifully. I have horrible anxiety and panic though, it's unimaginable. Yes, you should try your best to avoid taking a benzo every day. However, in cases of extreme anxiety daily benzo use may be appropriate. Klonopin is one of the better benzos for daily use."
TwoXSex,fc1mmnb,t3_e9sv4q,1577323337.0,I started BuSpar exactly three weeks ago and my libido has gone up significantly!
stopdrinking,fc1k9yi,t3_efmt25,1577321287.0,thank you so much! This is my first holidays not drinking and its been the best one yet :)
benzodiazepines,fc1joan,t3_efkyri,1577320771.0,I'm prescribed 1mg klonopin 4x daily so that saved my ass on christmas and christmas eve!
bipolar,fc1j8oq,t3_efl3co,1577320396.0,"one option is emergency Medicaid. A lot of hospitals also offer financial assistance. Above all, your health matters."
bipolar,fc1j28d,t3_efljm3,1577320246.0,my psych prescribed me Zofran (ondansetron) to take 15-30 minutes before I took my meds so that I wouldn't vomit them. I was vomiting every morning because of intense anxiety :/
bipolar,fc1i7uk,t1_fc1dqtb,1577319543.0,Awareness is the first step!

bipolar,fc0g00v,t1_fc0fvjo,1577289960.0,I’m so proud of you! One day at a time but totally worth it :)
benzodiazepines,fc0fxkv,t3_efhzpp,1577289901.0,2mg klonopin is wayyy stronger than 10mg Valium. Don’t do it
benzodiazepines,fc0f6oz,t3_efcgv5,1577289260.0,this was me two days ago lol
bipolar,fc0f2fi,t3_ef82bm,1577289159.0,I know the feeling. I force myself to take them even when I REALLY don't want to. I've noticed myself staying up later and I just wanna be like fuck it but now they're not putting me to sleep...
benzodiazepines,fc0ew6n,t3_eff4mw,1577289009.0,Benzos are the ONLY way I make it through the holidays. I take 1mg klonopin four times throughout the day along with other meds and i can actually function.
BipolarReddit,fc0co6k,t1_fbz5fk3,1577287028.0,same here. I have horrible anxiety and know that an SSRI would cure it but my psychiatrist refuses :(

bipolar,fbeiejp,t3_ecqx27,1576786382.0,"I was registering with my school's disability services in grad school for the first time ever and part of it was writing your official diagnosis. My psychologist wrote ""bipolar II disorder"" and I felt a sense of relief I've never felt before. I had a name for what I've been experiencing, it was amazing! I've been diagnosed since 2012 so it's good to see that there's a name for what I have!"
