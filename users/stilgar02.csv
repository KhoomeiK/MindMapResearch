facepalm,fenok79,t1_femx75z,1579288621.0,"Lightning very much cares about the shape of metal.  The shape of anything really.  If you're standing next to a tree with a tin pan over your head, lighting will strike the tall, pointy tree branch almost every time.

To get super physicsy, a flat or dispersed metal object may even DIScourage lightning from striking due to the coronal discharge it creates."

movies,fdcq6yc,t1_fdcljqf,1578281282.0,"Was he really proven to be all that competent? Seemed kind of open ended to me whether he was actually competent or just extremely lucky. Spoilers below:

>!On the one hand, he had figured out from the beginning that Marta was involved somehow in the death. On the other hand, it seemed like he didn't fully figure out the ""truth"" until he glanced at the toxology report at the last possible second.!<"
facepalm,fc9ib2g,t1_fc8kw0u,1577553089.0,"Same thing when people rail against ""identity"" politics. 9 times out of 10 they really mean ""not *my* identity"" politics."
funny,fc4wm0e,t1_fc4gvyy,1577431474.0,"In my experience I'm usually tailgated when I'm in the left passing cars or a truck...but I'm not passing at the speed the person behind me wants me to.  I'm passing going only 10 mph over, they want me to be going 20+ over.  There's no intentionally blocking anyone going on."
funny,fc4g0bb,t1_fc4b96b,1577415572.0,"And if you tailgate you're also an asshole.  Honk your horn if you want, but there's no need to make the situation dangerous for you and everyone else around you by riding someone's ass."
PS4,fc3qy6a,t1_fc3a6ve,1577396394.0,"My dad made one of those fundraising bars for me and my brother to save up for an N64.  Every time we would do a chore or something he'd fill the bar up by like $5.  Come Christmas we only had about half of the thing filled up, so we were not expecting it at all. Lo and behold guess what we opened... That was a good Christmas."
facepalm,fbzda93,t1_fbyw9m0,1577242884.0,"Same story with the latest Lion King movie.  Technically super impressive, but a flawed art direction (should have sacrificed realistic depictions for more ""human"" facial expressions)"
facepalm,fbuqp1q,t1_fbu912v,1577118837.0,"And if you would manage to do like 30 more seconds of research, you'd find that wind turbines recoup their monetary and energy costs in around 5-6 months if placed in favorable locations. [source](https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJSM.2014.062496)

I'm with you that nuclear energy is the future, but wind and solar are also great renewable energy sources in the meantime which are becoming more and more cost effective and energy efficient."
