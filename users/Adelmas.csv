politics,ff6iblj,t1_ff3injm,1579627813.0,"Thank you for the link. 

I read the article with an open mind.

What I did like about the article:

The points it made about advertisement costs decreasing, and slight administrative costs decreasing.

What I didn't like about the article:

The way it justified the tax increase. It said that taxes are something that ""we have come to terms with"" and that because of the cost decreases mentioned above, it would balance out.

I think with the vague information the article described, it is a long shot to say that costs will balance out or even become cheaper.

The article also made a point about being able to negotiate prices of medical operations. It was very vague and didn't include information as to how that would be possible.


So I can agree that costs would decrease slightly due to advertisement, and maybe a little bit in administrative costs, however the tax increase that comes with it limits my financial freedom and that is my biggest problem with the idea."

politics,ff3e0k5,t1_ff22d1e,1579539189.0,"I am open to different viewpoints. But pointing to one country just isn't enough to convince me. I have given you solid reasoning as to why I believe what I believe. What you are doing is pointing to a country and saying I don't believe your view because of propaganda. 

If you want to try to convince me using an example of one country, tell me more about why Norway is a good example and implementation of the system you propose. ""Catapulting economy"" is all you have said. Your argument is very broad and unfocused.

You say that the government isn't the Boogeyman, but I have given you solid reasoning as to why they can be.

You say that the extra profits should go to the government, but I have given you solid reasoning as to why they shouldn't.

The ""propaganda"" line you gave me is a cop out because you can't defend your position.

 If I'm wrong, prove me wrong."
politics,ff1zc1v,t1_ff0zcyq,1579489699.0,Those countries have such corrupt governments lol. Perfect example of why we shouldn't give the government the profits thus giving them more power. We don't want to turn out like them.
politics,ff0vexj,t1_ff0pd2f,1579472670.0,"Money is the motivation, people aren't going to work ten times harder when they don't have to. It is just how it is. You would do the same.

Which countries are you referring to? Any country that exports large amounts of oil will bring in lots of money of course. The difference is where does that money go."
politics,ff0n7tp,t1_ff0dsop,1579470477.0,">It is literally the exact same scenario lol.

No it is not.

>your salary is contingent on growth

This is so wrong and contradictory! How is your salary contingent on growth if the profits coming from said growth don't go to you?

>are you suddenly just going to sit there and do nothing because excess profits are going to the government?

 Do nothing is an exaggeration, but I can guarantee there will be a drop in urgency and innovation (why work so hard if you can't make more money from it), thus eventually resulting in a less quality product."
politics,ff0d64c,t1_fezfb46,1579467774.0,"If access money goes to the government, then what is the incentive for innovation and trying to maximize produce? 

Answer: There is none. No matter how much of a resource they yield, they get paid the same. 

Therefore supply drops and prices rise."
politics,ff02wbu,t1_fezj55g,1579464601.0,"That is not true. The cost of services itself will still stay the same. 

The difference is that costs will go up for people who make more money.

So in summary, you are saying ""give the government money so other people can pay for my healthcare and make it cheaper for me"""
politics,fezb5dh,t1_feyya11,1579455585.0,Why? Who does the work to collect the resources?
politics,fez3js9,t1_feyz7ro,1579453561.0,"What you are essentially saying is ""give the government money so that the government can give you money"". See the catch?

As far as your argument of paying less without premiums, that might be true, slightly. But you would have less money in your pocket to pay the rest of the costs! It still doesn't work, it is an illusion. Again, ""give the government money so we can give you money"" makes no sense. If we resort to government run healthcare, those employees working still need to get paid (out of your taxes) and all the costs will still need to be covered (by your taxes!). 

Having less money in your pocket does NOT give you more financial freedom as you said.

The government can definitely be the Boogeyman, which is why they need to have less control. Just look at all of the corrupt governments we see today. Maybe right now it isn't, but give them control of everyone's finances by raising taxes, and if it gets corrupt, we are screwed! Why would you want the government to have more power?"
politics,feyquw2,t1_feyn2di,1579449414.0,"But what problem would that solve? Why are you against private corporations handling it?

Having private corporations handle this keeps prices low."
politics,fewkdu4,t1_fewjrou,1579412563.0,"Yep.

I advocate for low taxes because of the financial freedom that comes with it. It also gives incentive to work and move up ranks in the work force.

 It is immoral to take my money away because you think someone else deserves it.

I have seen social security abused by many people in my life. That system just doesn't work.

I think we have common ground, and you have good intentions, but ultimately your answer of raising taxes doesn't work because it takes money away from Americans forcefully and limits their financial freedom."
politics,fewji9j,t1_feulwi0,1579411886.0,"Just because other countries tax rates are higher does not mean we should increase taxes. 

It makes alot more sense to let private corporations control the economy as opposed to the government. The government is one central place of control, if that gets corrupt then everyone gets hit. With capitalism, what you buy and spend money on is essentially a vote. You don't like a company? Don't buy from them. If people don't like a service from a company and they stop buying their goods, the company goes out of business. It encourages a competitive high quality market."
politics,fetyrtr,t1_fetts3d,1579381412.0,"We have alot more expenses to pay, for instance the US defense budget is way higher than most countries. If we add these socialist programs we can expect to see that tax percentage increase heavily."
politics,fetu9sp,t1_fett3jf,1579380144.0,"I highly disagree with your comment.

You think, because I don't want to pay for other peoples stuff, that I lack empathy and don't care about them. This is wrong.

I believe that I should have financial freedom to do what I want with my money. I think that taking money from someone and giving it to someone else because the government thinks that they deserve it more is immoral. Absolutely immoral.

This country has loads of job opportunities, and if you want to be financially stable, there is a path to reach it. It requires alot of work though.

This doesn't mean I don't give to charity. I give plenty of my money to charity. I should have the financial freedom to give my money away how I please."
politics,fetsduf,t1_fetl26k,1579379487.0,">We already tried, it didn't.

How so? 

>Medicare for all.

Why should I have to pay for everyone else's health care? If everyone had more money (and not have it be taken by the government), they would be able to pay their own.

>Then why don't you want your fellow Americans to have it?

How do I not want my fellow Americans to have it? This is wrong. ""You don't care about Americans because you don't want to pay for their healthcare"". Guilt tactics. I don't want to pay for everyone else's health care, I shouldn't have to. I want them to be able to pay for it themselves. I want everyone to have health care as much as you do.

> So we can have our claims denied by our insurance overlords.

Assuming that the claims will get denied, which isn't as common as you are portraying it to be. But I would absolutely be in favor of keeping insurance companies more accountable in terms of denying claims.

But in most cases your insurance will cover the cost and the system will work."
politics,fetr57i,t1_feti7d4,1579378689.0,"Oh okay, I get what you're saying now.

You are saying it isn't about ""free stuff"", but it is. What you are saying is to take money from taxes and spend it into these things you mention. 

Where do you think the government gets its money to fund these things? Taxes. Or in other words, your paycheck.

You mention multiple in depth problems that shouldn't be lumped together in one category. There is no one big solution for these problems.

""Poor education"". How does America have poor education? There is free public schooling, and then the opportunity to go to college. Granted it costs alot, but it is manageable. I am about to graduate college myself and I got a got a good job from it so you won't be able to convince me that our education system is poor. OPPORTUNITY IS THERE.

Worlds highest incarceration rate - this is a complex problem. I think it is because of poorer areas.. people resort to stealing and selling drugs and it gets them locked up. That is the choice they made. The solution to this problem is NOT taking money out of my paycheck and giving it to them.

Poor healthcare - there are so many factors to this, simply raising taxes isn't gonna fix this. Drugs in the US have a higher cost than anywhere in the world."
politics,fetnjfx,t1_fesqjzk,1579377239.0,"So taxing the citizens to Oblivion is how we get out of debt? I don't think that's a good way to do it. How will I be able to feed a family if the government takes all of my money?

Also there are so so many other factors in play when it comes to countries budgets, not just taxes."
politics,fetjdsa,t1_fesgu8o,1579376059.0,"None of that is reflected in my statement. You are making wrong assumptions. Obviously healthcare is good. That's why I want you to keep the hard earned money you work for (and not have the government take it), so that you can afford your health care.

If you think this won't work, or if you think a different system would work better, please do share. 

Passive aggressiveness doesn't make for productive conversation."

And thank you, there is too much slander in modern day politics, we should be able to believe what we want and be able to discuss it without being called deplorable or Nazis or whatever."
politics,fes8m4f,t1_fes4lqo,1579362584.0,"All I hear is ""free stuff, raise taxes"".

You can't just bribe the public with the public's money. It doesn't work that way. Where do you think that money comes from?

There is already corporate income tax, which means your company doesn't pay you to your full potential, then there's income tax, where you get paid less from the money your company pays you, then there's tax on every item you buy, BUT raising taxes even more is the answer? No. It's not."
