That's some open minded thinking you have there. If you knew Amy thing about Tennessee you'd know that Nashville is our largest and most liberal city. It's no backwoods city like you have pictured in your head, and for you to immediately jump to racism displays some of your own serious prejudice."

I always wrote them off as over priced, but I have price matched and they consistently come out comparable, plus I got some best buy bucks last time so I really came out ahead, and if given the choice I'm going to go to a retail store if I can to keep them in business."

tmobile,fdl9yfw,t1_fdl93z6,1578519576.0,"Yes. The most frustrating part is, some of their toys, mostly the black nylon and solid bar type toys were great.

tmobile,fdl8wss,t1_fdkyjki,1578519042.0,"The nightmare for me has been canceling. I signed up for six months, but after two it was clear that, even getting the Super Chewer box, most of the toys weren't tough enough.

I told them I wasn't going to email every month and ask for new toys and that I wanted to cancel. The rep convinced me to try it for another month, so I did and again they were dead in a day. Some of the toys were great, but the majority didn't last.

I called them and they pulled up the chat log and said ""blah blah he didn't actually promise to let you cancel early..."" etc. January is my last month and I've sworn off the company for good. They admitted I had a problem with the toys every single month and then used doublespeak to keep me around."

technology,fctgwwg,t1_fcte8dz,1577942901.0,"It's not funny really, at least not in the sense you're trying to say. Business and People have different taxes codes, it works like that in every single functioning country on the planet. If you had a small business you would be eligible for the same style of tax break as Amazon if you didn't make a profit last year."
technology,fct3oh0,t1_fct2rh0,1577932052.0,"They don't pay virtually zero taxes. They pay nothing close to zero taxes, and they pay tax on all of their net income over a period of years. The truth is that, due to reinvestment into the company, Amazon and Netflix lost profit for a long time, and that should be encouraged. 

The whole reason it is setup like this is so you can run a company that loses $1M over 5 years you don't have to pay taxes till after you've brought at least your $1M back in profit, but that $1M in profit only puts you back at zero. As soon as you go above zero you start paying federal income tax.

Also federal income tax isn't even the most expensive tax that employers pay. Amazon and Netflix both pay state taxes, social security taxes, payroll taxes, property taxes and many other various types of taxes. 

My whole point here, is not even that they pay ""almost no"" taxes. They pay A LOT of tax. So, your comment of ""no taxes"" is at best seriously misleading and at worst a flat out lie."
technology,fct15yp,t1_fcsy2ve,1577930197.0,"You're changing the goalposts. You said they paid ""no taxes"" your sources simply say they paid no federal income taxes. They paid a host of other state and federal taxes."

Mohammed Sanu looked like a great pickup, a lot of people were happy to have him, but I think the problem you've pointed out is that he is a great #2 and we needed a #1. 

You also failed to mention all of the efforts the team has made this year to try to bolster the WR core. We literally lost a player to the Titans because he thought TB was too old. That can't be predicted or helped at this point. Maybe our moves to bolster the offense haven't panned out, but you completely discounting all the moves we have made and have attempted to make."
