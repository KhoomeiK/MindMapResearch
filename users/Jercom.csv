suggestmeabook,ff6bf5f,t3_ertim7,1579623509.0,"One of my friends also has severe anxiety and he read The Happiness Trap by Russ Harris. He spoke very highly of it and he's not a big reader so I assume it's easy to get through.

I absolutely loved The Social Animal by David Brooks, (he has a few good ones). It's not really about coping with mental illness but it does give a lot of insight into the inner workings of our minds by following the story of two people from birth to death. It helped me come to a deeper understanding of myself and others and for an educational book it was incredibly fun to read.

It's also important to remember that in modern developed countries we are less socially connected than ever before. If your anxiety doesn't have a chemical cause and self care isn't working either, then it's likely your brain longing for more meaningful social connections. I used to have cripplingly low self-esteem for seemingly no reason. That only changed when I moved from home and found an entirely new social circle of people that actually look out for each other. It takes time but It's so worth it."
TrueOffMyChest,ff64121,t3_eruldt,1579618586.0,"Our culture is obsessed with sex. In most peoples minds it seems that when unrelated men and women hang out they must only be interested in each other sexually. So when you grow up with someone of the opposite sex and don't fuck them for a long time the only way people can justify this in their brains is to view you as siblings. Hence, if you do eventually come to fall in love with that person romantically, these people have a hard time changing this perception of your relationship in their heads. 

In short. Fuck em'. What other people think doesn't matter whatsoever and never will. Do what makes you guys happy."

TrueOffMyChest,ff346bo,t3_erbzb8,1579533230.0,"Shaming people for not working themselves into the grave is one of the most disgusting mentalities that I keep hearing older generations perpetuate. Humans are physically not designed to work long days. For well over a hundred thousand years homo sapiens spent, on average, just a few hours per day searching for food and the need to work long hours doing physically taxing work is something that only began with the agricultural revolution. 

Now i'm not saying that you can't find a great job that makes you happy and leaves you with enough free time and energy to do other things. In fact my previous job was incredible and I was happy to pick up extra shifts and work 11/12 hour days because I had great coworkers and a boss who treated us like human beings. But these jobs, in my experience are few and far between. 

As someone who doesn't believe in an afterlife I only have this one lifetime to enjoy as much as I can and I'll be damned If I let myself become some old cranky bastard because he wasted his life busting his ass for a system that doesn't give a fuck about him."

todayilearned,fejvt9n,t1_fejs9tz,1579187007.0,"This is the one I was referring to...

""Girls say to me, very reasonably, ‘why isn’t it a bunch of girls? Why did you write this about a bunch of boys?’ Well, my reply is I was once a little boy — I have been a brother, a father, I am going to be a grandfather. I have never been a sister, or a mother, or a grandmother. That’s one answer. Another answer is of course to say that if you, as it were, scaled down human beings, scaled down society, if you land with a group of little boys, they are more like a scaled-down version of society than a group of little girls would be. Don’t ask me why, and this is a terrible thing to say because I’m going to be chased from hell to breakfast by all the women who talk about equality— this is nothing to do with equality at all. I think women are foolish to pretend they are equal to men, they are far superior and always have been. But one thing you can’t do with them is take a bunch of them and boil them down, so to speak, into a set of little girls who would then become a kind of image of civilization, of society.""

The flaw with Golding's logic is that you can't ""scale down"" society and expect the behavior of it's members to remain the same. Humans behave much differently in small groups that they do in large societies with set rules."

todayilearned,fejrejq,t1_fejmy0d,1579183961.0,"I feel like this one example could be mostly attributed to life experience. Boys tend to learn more ""handy"" skills as they grow up so this would've given the men an advantage in this situation. If you were to make a group of equally handy women they probably would've fared the same. The myth that I'm trying to dispel is the one William Golding supposedly began which is that women work together better then men do. I'm saying that in a small isolated group there would probably be little difference in the ability to cooperate socially.

Edit: spelling"
