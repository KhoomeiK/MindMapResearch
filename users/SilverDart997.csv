summonerschool,fdqze5v,t1_fdqyt9w,1578677327.0,"Are there champs that you would consider classic mid that I could get a feel for the role well with? I've played adc a bit so I think I'm understanding that one, but I haven't really done much on mid"
summonerschool,fdqxlsi,t1_fdqweef,1578676244.0,"I've heard that before, I was just thinking that it'd take a while to be able to try out the different champs and figure out what I like/what works well for me, so I wasn't sure if there's a quicker way than trial and error since I'd like to get into it more rather than do this ""trial"" thing. Cause also I've noticed that sometimes I think a champion would be fun but then I just suck when I play them ðŸ˜‚"
summonerschool,fdqus3f,t3_elvyh2,1578675179.0,"Has anyone else had trouble deciding where/who they want to play? I'm relatively new I guess (lvl 33 but playing for a few months), but it's been bugging me. I started as Illaoi top, but now I'll sometimes play Diana as mid/top, Ez or KogÂ as bot, and sometimes Elise or Xin as jung. I just can't seem to figure out where I want to play (although I'm definitely worst at jungle lol). How did othersÂ decide where/who they want to play?Â "

Internet,fdnqhkn,t1_fdnean7,1578590897.0,"We don't have a real desktop, only latops, so pretty much everything would be wireless. Would I still need the modem then or can I get away with just a router?"

Internet,fdmb6g2,t1_fdmal6r,1578544466.0,"We haven't really looked for a place to move to yet, so it kind of seems like it might be safer to get the router and modem separate for now so that if we can't use it after moving we only have to replace the modem instead of a whole unit"
ChineseLanguage,fdipacg,t1_fdioe37,1578447991.0,"Thanks! I got most of it, there were a few that I didn't. But also thanks for the links, those look like they'll be interesting :)"
college,fdip040,t1_fdimv5r,1578447810.0,"No problem! Courses may or may not count, that'd be up to whichever school(s) you apply to. Certifications are pretty much always good (better if it's for an applicable skill) , but some are better than others. Maybe take a look at who offers it and do some research that way.
At least as far as college is concerned, pick a few that you're interested and get in contact with their admissions office. They'll be able to point you in the direction of the people who are in charge of applications from the Philippines and should be able to give you some pointers (I hope!). They should at least be able to give you more specific information than I can :P"
Chinese,fdhkrcd,t3_ekk5vg,1578424730.0,"There's also an app called soul, one of my Chinese friends showed it to me. It's pretty much exclusively used by Chinese people, and you can send messages or even call or video call. I think it let's you record verbal messages as well, but I'm not sure. Either way, it's a great way to practice speaking with random Chinese people"
college,fdhk5nd,t3_eleifj,1578424364.0,"I'd say go for it! If you aren't really liking that job but want to keep working then you could get out quick with an ""easy"" job (retail, fast food, etc.) and keep your eyes open for ways to get your foot in the door with law stuff. For example, I'm studying the microbio, but it's hard to get a job related to that without the degree. So, I volunteer at a hospital to get some experience but I also have a part time job at a hotel so I can still have some income while I'm at school"
college,fdhjsje,t3_eld6dn,1578424146.0,"That sounds like a tough situation. If you're planning on going back to the US to study then I'd say look at the requirements of some of the universities (or if you have specific ones you want then look at those) and see what you can do there. Find service opportunities, join a club/find a hobby, maybe join linked in or another professional system and try to connect with people on that. As for the studies, it seems like you might end up a little behind, but I'm not really sure how intense the schools down there are. If you're worried about that you should start studying for the GMAT/GRE stuff early, maybe see if you can find some curriculums or course content online that you can use as a base for your studies (essentially just supplement what you're learning there with what you can find out about what students in the US/Europe are learning)"
college,fdetvzx,t1_fdetjv4,1578346505.0,"I'd say go for it then. My roommate is going for a patent lawyer and plans on doing engineering for his undergrad and then law for graduate, so maybe you could do something similar? I'm not super familiar with that field, but if you could then you could focus on the bio part and get your gpa up that way instead of trying to work on both at the same time"
college,fdeslfe,t1_fdemluz,1578345740.0,"In addition to that, most schools will only accept certain credits, so you'd have to talk to individual schools to figure out what would transfer and what wouldn't"
college,fdesgrd,t3_el0ees,1578345662.0,"I've had a few tough semesters myself that have had a large impact on my gpa... Do you know what you want to do? If schooling is needed for that then go for it, and just work hard for the next couple years. It's not worth giving up a dream just because of a bad year :) if there's a specific university you want to get into, also try to set some goals and maybe meet with a counselor to see how you can get it back up in time. The good thing is that was the beginning and you can now move up from here"
college,fdes17x,t3_ekyv7u,1578345405.0,"I'd check and see if your school has a psychologist or some other program available to help students, but also doesn't have any obligation to report to the school. If so you could probably get a letter/note or something from them and the school would likely be more willing to consider it. On the other hand, I've noticed that most school counselors are pretty understanding and if it's something that will impact your mental state or even safety then I think they'd be willing to work something out with you."
