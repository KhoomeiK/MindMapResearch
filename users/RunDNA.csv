StarWarsLeaks,fffvung,t1_fffto7v,1579892920.0,"If you read early drafts of the first Star Wars film they feature scenes in  huge cities, but those scenes disappear from later drafts, presumably for budget reasons.

So the Star Wars that was in George's mind from the get-go is a different thing from the Star Wars that he had the money to  first bring to the screen, and this has caused problems in the definition of 'What Star Wars Is' ever since. Star Wars was never just  set in wastelands in George's mind, but many fans seem to think it should be."

> I don't want to over-explain our intentions in the film, and I'd leave it to the audience to draw causal connections between events. But, I will say this: there's no reason to think that Luke's sacrifice wasn't what inspired the galaxy. Lando rounded up the allies, but clearly something has changed in the galaxy since the Battle of Crait. The galaxy answers the call this time. I can't speak for anyone except myself, but in The Last Jedi, we are given a privileged moment with the children on Canto Bight. The audience understands — though perhaps the Resistance does not yet understand — that something is changing in the galaxy at that moment. In my mind at least, the legend of Skywalker and of his sacrifice is taking root in the consciousness of the galaxy. Again, I won't presume to decode the film, but when the galaxy answers this time around, I sure as hell wouldn't contradict anyone who draws a connection between the sacrifice of Skywalker, the final scene in TLJ, and the galaxy coming when called at the climax of TROS. It's all one story."
television,ff93act,t3_esbex7,1579703794.0,"I sometimes imagine to myself  what happens with most comedians when they die. That there is some Ancient God with a scale weighing the good and bad deeds of each man or woman. 

And I think of Terry Jones in front of the scale as his small amount of bad or selfish deeds are placed on one side, tilting it slightly towards Perdition. And then the literally billions of laughs he has caused during his life are plomped down on the other side of the instrument, breaking it in the process, resulting in his swift escort to whatever passes for Paradise.

But whether that idea is fantasy or reality, we can all agree that Terry Jones caused an enormous amount of happiness and laughter in millions of people around the world and will continue to do so long past his time on Earth. A life splendidly lived."
