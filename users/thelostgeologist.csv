Accounting,fejsm1y,t1_fejrd2d,1579184843.0,Thanks for the response. I think it would be manageable. I would be working 40 hours a week and be taking 2 online courses. So I could probably listen to lectures while driving. And the commute would be about 1.5 hours with traffic.
Accounting,fejsi1z,t1_fejro1l,1579184764.0,That‚Äôs what I thought. The commute would be between 1.15 and 1.5 hours. Probably just going to listen to my online lectures when driving. It‚Äôs been hell trying to find a sublease for 4 month period of the internship.
