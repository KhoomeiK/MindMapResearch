Ill ask ""Did you get a confirmation email saying its ready?"" They will say ""No, I ordered it like 20mins ago."" I slap my forehead.

We check online orders every 30-60 mins. Usually the tickets arent even printed that quickly unless one of us is very bored and keep refreshing the page. When customers do this, they will now have to wait until I can grab someone off the sales floor to pull the order, then we have to stage it before we can print off an invoice for them to sign... soooo they will be waiting 30+ mins especially if its a big order or a large item. By this to me people are just impatient and say they will just go grab it off the self if its gonna take too long... Wow, its like you could of just been normal and shopped without online or you could of waited for a confirmation. And if they choose to grab it themselves we have to cancel the order and ring it up like normal through our system... its sooooo frustrating."

dating_advice,fdhi2j7,t1_fdhbat9,1578423096.0,"Im glad my experience could help you. I think having insecurities and doubts about your relationship is normal because we dont know the future and we are worried we arent on the right path and we fear failure. 

I see it this way, you make your own path because your trying to be happy. I think about what life would be like if I didn't stay with him (we had almost no contact against our will for a month due to certain events. And when i saw him again... it was the best feel. I tear up every time I think of it) or if we had ended things when we were struggling but my heart breaks when I think about him being with someone else and I know myself well enough that I know all I'll be thinking about for years will be him. I have severe anxiety and when I had my doubts about our relationship, if this was the right path, I would have full on panic attacks to where if he text me or cuddled me I would start freaking out on the inside. He would always ask if it was because of him, and my answer was always, no im having bad thoughts its nothing that you did wrong. And to this day, I still get panic attacks but not due to true doubts, my mind will wonder and Ill return to flashbacks of the time we almost broke up early on and the full month where everyday was me scare I wasnt making the right choices. I was so upset I was panicking over something I already decided I wanted to do and who I wanted to be with. These memories will trigger the thoughts I had, followed by mini panic attacks but those arent my doubts anymore, those are my past doubts that I refuse to have. I have fought my inner demons (anxiety and doubts) tooth and nail to be free of the fear, I wanted control over my own life. In a way I guess its like PTSD, thats best I can explain it.

He is a new person and so am I, we have grown up a lot and every time I see him I get so happy and we flow so well together. I dont want anyone besides him, he is the man I've waited for and I'm grateful I was cautious and patient.

I hope this didnt scare you too much. You will have doubts but you also will have the choice to either act on those doubts or act on your love for him. 

I chose him."
AskReddit,fdhf3m0,t3_elet8a,1578421310.0,"Wasnt even a relationship, i fell for a guy who had a girlfriend and at first I was just friends with him but was so desperate to be loved I let him in a cheat on his girlfriend with me. We never kissed, never ha sex or anything like that but he would cuddle me, talk to me everyday and he acted sexual in some twisted way. He really liked giving massages soooo yeah... and he did this with many girls, hanging out with them giving them massages, at least thats what he said he was doing. I dont truly know. We also had a couple of people who were trying to get him to dump his girlfriend since she was long distance and im pretty sure she was fooling around with guys too. So they were both in a way cheating. But the people who were rooting for us to get together made me have higher hopes and ignore the fact what I was doing was something I regret terribly. I was THAT GIRL who tried to get between two people in a relationship and I told myself I wasnt, it was a shit fest. So while I was focused on this guy, my now handsome and wonderful fiancé came along and met me in school. He fell in love at first sight and was trying his best to stalk me, like we do to learn more about our love interests through social media, but I didnt go by my real name I went by my nickname so it took him a minute to figure it out and I wasnt on many social media sites. But he ends up getting my number and we talk for weeks, even pulled an all nighter over skype. He told me his honest past within that night and told me he really wanted to see us together. I was anxious about him because of how clingy he was and I hadnt dated for 4 years and I was interested in someone else who he knew about. But i had told him I did like him but I wasnt sure about a relationship. I led my fiancé on for months before I decided to Ghost both of them to see who really cared about me. And at the time I had a realization that I was chasing the wrong guy. I had been depressed and suicidal for nearly the whole year and almost ended it because of the situation I put myself in. I was so manipulated which made me manipulate my fiancé. 

I regret chasing that terrible guy, being that girl who tried to break up a relationship and leading on such a wonderful and loyal person. Im soooo grateful that my Fiancé decided he still wanted to be with me. He said he tried to shake off his feelings for me but he just couldnt and it made him feel so much worse. We are happy now and have been together for over 2 years."

AskReddit,fdhakvf,t3_eleos4,1578418922.0,"For me its by hanging around them and listening, when Im comfortable I engage in light conversation and slowly spend more time around them until I know their humor and boundaries before really letting my personality shine. I smile alot and im always trying to be as open minded of people as possible. But i think I also attract people since Ive got such a goofy personality. Like everyone Im shy and I think im much more timid than most would say, maybe because I hide my fear and step out of my comfort zone often, but not because I have to. This has also caused me to mature very quickly so I guess how I hold myself is very approachable as well. 

Dont have your goal be to make friends right away, be acquaintances first to where you wont be hurt if they dont want to hang out. Then when you have gotten into an established group or established some solid base with them then your goal is to open up more and actually become friends. Thats how I look at things. Its really hard to put the process into words but thats the best I got."
dating_advice,fdh9r26,t3_ele803,1578418439.0,"I have dated semi-seriously once before  my fiancé with some puppy love when I was younger, then I didnt date for 4 years because I was so cautious and scared of relationships. He had dated several girls and had one really serious relationship where he thought he found the one but they didnt workout and she moved on pretty quick while he was broken for a long time. He was dating and playing around with other girls after that until he met me. My fiancé and I dated for 4 months after trying to win me over for several months and finally succeeding, then on the 4 month mark we got engaged because of events in our lives, we wanted to put a ring on it and marry shortly after. I wasn't even out of high school yet when I got engaged. I was the only person I believe from my school who was. Events in life didnt work out like we though but we stuck together like glue. We both believe we are 'the one' and always say ""forever and always"" because of our strong belief of everything happening for a reason. I have had doubts before especially early on since I hadnt dated anyone for 4 years and suddenly have a guy fall in love with me and other relationship issues. He was my first for everything and we caught through so much hard times.  We have had times where we thought we were going to end it but we love each other far too much to let go. We have been together for over 2 years and have taken things slow now and prolonged the engagement until we are more stable and thats ok. The ring is a promise to him to marry and a warning to others to stay away. 

My mother has only been with my dad and they have been together since they were 14. The  married fresh out of high school. They are still together 24years later depending on if your counting the marriage years only. 

As long as your an adult and you truly love each other than no, your not too young. I have a lot of faith in my man and my relationship, but only you can make the final call on what you believe is best for you. I never really desired to play around with different people, I was kinda the date to marry gal. Which is why I was so cautious of people, i didnt want to be used. My relationship is simple in a way, we have similar goals, similar morals and understandings of how we should be in our relationship.

Im sorry for the long post. I have people ask about this sort of thing often."
TrueOffMyChest,fdh66g8,t3_elam6b,1578416227.0,"People need scars and need to struggle on their own to survive in life and the earlier people have this the more mature and prepared they are. This guy seems to have been entirely dependent on every person he's been with regardless if it was family, friends or ex lovers. He feels no shame and in my mind he's a loser and a failure as an adult. We all need help even as Adults but he has taken this to a whole other level. He could easily work at any restaurant, any gas station, any retail or grocery store, a call center or even do landscaping like trimming grass and bushes in a company. There are soooo many kinds of jobs out there, not all pay well but a job is better than no job. But he has no ambition and no sense of independence. The sooner you cut ties the better. You will hate your life and regret ever meeting him if you keep in contact. He will have the options of getting a job right away when he is kicked out which he might blow up your phone or worst case stalk you, he might find a new victim or just give up and act like the world is out to get him and just be homeless without trying. I've known people who have lived out of their cars for a year or so until they had enough to rent a place and even my sisters Ex was living in a hotel for months while he worked but he is a terrible man and got her to pay for his new place and take him to and from work and even cosign on a car loan, he was a leech too just not to the extent of not working. 

Please dont let this man ruin your life anymore. Karma is coming to him and its gonna come hard but it will come to you as well and might bring you the one true thing that your life needs, if he's out of your life. I dont know what that may be but I have the belief everything happens for a reason and right now, him not helping himself is a sign from whatever it may be (your beliefs), to cut ties forever otherwise your life is gonna be a living hell."
