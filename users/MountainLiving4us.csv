Cause  God knows you aint getting famous as a DJ .. You have zero respect for people. You were loud and vulgar in public. Go back to the city and chase people parking in the bike lane ."

Poconos,fddffkn,t3_eklq8o,1578309847.0,"I left NYC in 1991 and moved up here. I commuted to the city for 2 yrs after I moved .. The commute is HELL.. Esp in the winter .. I use to leave  Mt Pocono at 430am and would be at the GWB  toll at 6am . The commute  tore up my vehicle. You might  just want to buy a monthly  Bus  ticket and take the bus. At least you can sleep.. The winters are  rough .. You can get stuck in NJ or in the city .. So have  somewhere there you can crash in case of bad weather . Good luck ...Monroe county  is a ghetto  these days.. Id  go to  Pike county or Wayne county ..NEVER buy a home in a community .. They all SUCK ..If you  stay in Dingmans Ferry  you can take the Dingmans  bridge  to NJ  then shoot down 206 to 15  and be on rt 80 in Rockaway ,NJ..  Its a easier ride .."
Poconos,fda9v7k,t3_ek8l9g,1578243430.0,"I would avoid a community at all costs.  Because EVERY year  you'll be paying more and more dues. They never go down .. They go UP every year .. Also, In a community  you own the house  and the footprint of it .. The community most of the times  owns the rest. Read the community  rule book very carefully. If you have central water and sewer you'll get hammered  every  year ( Stick with a well and a septic system) ..  That's  just my two cents  . Do the homework before you pull the trigger ."
