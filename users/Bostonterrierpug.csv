Teachers,ff4ivba,t1_ff3r3u5,1579564675.0,In Florida we have dual enrollment where kids can take college classes for free which considering the rep of the state is amazing. I wish they had that when I was in HS.
edtech,ff4h4p9,t1_ff4gsl3,1579563480.0,As a technology advisor for public libraries you might have a way in. Worst case scenario you can get a masters in about a year and a half though I know that is not what you want to hear. Really the library side is out of my expertise. I am guessing your chair has experience here and would be a much better person to talk to you.
edtech,ff4g9uf,t1_ff4dudr,1579562891.0,Well sounds like you should look into libraries and library science.  There is a happy he crossover between the fields.
Teachers,ff4g6o3,t1_ff4emr6,1579562832.0,"My school has mostly tenure track with fewer adjuncts faculty and yes more and more institutions are turning to adjuncts while at the same time raising tuition sadly. Still it depends on the school and state and as always stay away from the horrible for profit schools.
Also I am at a state college which is a CC that offers bachelors.

Edit: also looking at our adjuncts a lot of them are in trade fields. We have police officers who teach, refrigerator repairman and mechanics as well professional chefs. Almost all of them have full-time jobs and teach on the side for fun. This may be somewhat skew the data of the report for CC. Still sadly yes a lot of schools are turning to adjuncts and you make a very good point. What we really need now is more full-time teachers in K-12 ( though I am biased being in an Ed department). And in regards to the original post we still get a lot of but I got an A in someone else’s  class so why don’t I have an A in your class?! So I feel the pain as well, but I’m sure it’s much worse coming from annoying parents."
edtech,ff4bvii,t3_erjwuc,1579559971.0,As far as I know there are three main sectors (1) faculty (2) college or K-12 staff or (3) private sector. What are you go for would greatly depend on your dissertation and  research focus.  I am a professor of Ed tech but have friends who work at private companies and also who work in K 12 as well as as being staff. I will save all the jobs probably tenure track faculty is the most difficult to get. As the above poster said really you should speak with your chair as they know the most about your work.
Teachers,ff4ae4d,t1_ff3otfo,1579559034.0,This depends entirely on the school and state . I took a state college job over uni cause the pay was much better and I was short listed for tenure and definitely more than I made as a HS teacher. I have a heavier class load so can’t do as much research as I’d like but I am paid much better than many of my uni prof friends. Our union is also the AAUP same as the unis. Adjuncts at either a uni or college will make very little and have no job security nor benefits sadly.

aww,ff1kp6d,t1_fesudbu,1579480742.0,I would recommend getting just one and taking at least a year to bond with it. That’s what our breeder told us. And as per my below post we did not choose the cutest one but the most friendly and that seems to be working out very well.
Professors,ff1fpi8,t3_er2ixk,1579478501.0,"This is a bad answer probably and I know my type isn’t exactly popular on Reddit, but I’m an extrovert. I too like be the mental gymnastics and also the constant interaction and I make fun of myself to the class when I mess up. After a fun class I feel recharged and can’t wait to get home to tell my wife about it.

Edit: Sorry had a kiddo on my lap. The sexual harassment is just bullshit and sorry you had to deal with it. I am the only man in my ed department so have it a bit differently as 90% of our students are female. Still my coworkers and I have noticed that some students take my attempts at authority ( I’m normally a goofball lest they get out of line or try and pull something) much more seriously than many of theirs. I would say do your best not to let it bother you and work on a strong teaching persona. Try and emulate people in movies who seem very confident maybe? Sorry if this advice is crap."
aww,feys3px,t1_fesrwun,1579449906.0,Our chinchilla is very friendly and loves to cuddle and play (see my post history for example). Like any pet it makes a difference if you (1) get them young and (2) take your time and choose a friendly one. We went to a breeder and though we didn’t choose the cutest chinchilla we chose the friendliest one. Haven’t regretted it a bit.

Even then do your first two years at a community or state college. Most master’s can be done in 1.5-2 years and are a better investment. Still it depends on your specialty. Some lesser known nationally schools have top notch masters and doc programs.
