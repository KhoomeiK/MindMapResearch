vizsla,fek4kjv,t1_feij2p7,1579192474.0,They are used for horses too. It is the easiest way to control an animals movement. It works perfectly for my weim. After a while you might not need it anymore if you use it well to train them.
AskVet,fek1sox,t3_epjoj1,1579190783.0,The reason the hand test is good is because it takes the sun into account. It also depends om the dog. A pharaoh hound can handle hotter temperatures than a husky.
Hunting,fek0j7e,t1_feil9j9,1579190003.0,Why so many downvotes? Is everyone so salty?
dogs,fefb1tb,t1_feex01r,1579052378.0,"I agree with most of what you say. I think that there is not 1 right way to do things. You have to adjust methods and lifestyle to your specific dogs needs. The fit between owner and dog must be right. I think it is very rare that a dog is mentally not okay. At least the amount of aggressive dogs is definitely disproportionate.
Honestly say about Cesar what you want, but he rehabilitated a lot of dogs that would otherwise have beem euthanized or abandoned. His books about puppy training are a lot more based on positivity than his rescue shows."

From experience with my first dog, his techniques really work if you can put in the time and stay in control of your energy. Might be interesting to look at."
dogs,fef7wb3,t1_fef21vt,1579050278.0,"The bite when someone bends over a dog makes sense since it is quite threatening to a lot of dogs. Shouldn't happen of course but bending over dogs is not smart. Even a happy dog can jump and knock out teeth (trust me on that one)
Sorry it didn't work out. Training resource guarding against humans is way easier for sure because you have more control.
Did the agression start with the chihuahua? Was there any incident that led to her aggression?
After something like that happening you definitely shouldn't have the dog with other dogs in one house, especially not a (fragile) chihuahua. 
Puppy class also is important but socialization goes a lot further. I took 4 months off to be with my pup and take her everywhere and meet with loads of dogs every day. I get not everyone can do that, but some breeds need a lot of extra socialization. She isn't a pitbull, but is from very strong working line.
I want to thank you for finding him a good home and not just abandoning him. You seem like good people"
dogs,feduynu,t1_fedtyp0,1579020448.0,"I meant a lack of training. A police dog is trained to bite but knows when to do it. I have a german Weimaraner myself so I know what gameness is. Thing is that with training you can teach a dog when certain behaviours is appropriate and when it is not. My dog doesn't hunt people and other dogs or cats anymore, but she still does it with game. If you get a breed that is more likely to be dog reactive then you need to socialize it more than you would a golden retriever."
dogs,fedg9hz,t1_fece1lm,1579010713.0,"Food guarding can be trained. It is quite usefull to do as a puppy. Training isn't just at classes, but everywhere. Was it well socialized? I let my pup play with at least 5 other dogs a day. 
Also I don't mean this in a mean way, but did the pitbull really want to kill the chihuahua or did it stop after throwing it off the couch? It is not that hard for a big dog to kill a chihuahua by accident.
I also didn't mean it can't be dog aggressive if it isn't abused. You need to train (a lot) and give a dog a lot of exercise. A tired dog is a good dog. My last dog would react to other dogs if she didn't have her energy out. She just had so much energy that it came out as aggression. Having her run for 1 or 2 hours a day fixed everything."
dogs,fecc7ec,t1_febmfwk,1578970548.0,It is true that many herding dogs try to herd people and other animals. This behaviour could be redirected and then if you are consistent it will stop.
dogs,fecaykr,t1_fec6y53,1578969856.0,"I don't disagree on this. I responded to the original statement of ""aggressive breeds"". This just atracts the wrong owners and just makes it worse. I don't know how many times I need to keep saying this but I'm not saying they aren't more likely to be aggressive. I'm just saying in is not solely to be blamed on that. I believe the decisive factor is the owner. Do you think Cesar Milan or any other highly experienced dog trainer would have a dog aggressive pit?"
dogs,febsvlm,t1_febds11,1578962260.0,Didn't know that they are not off leash. That's why I put a questionmark behind it. Obviously people should keep their dogs on leash in areas where the rules say you should. In my country natural parks are mostly off leash and it annoys me when I go to a specific place because it is an off leash area and someone with a reactive dogs tells me I can't have my dog off leash.
dogs,febo2kg,t1_febmfwk,1578960922.0,"My argument still stands that if a dog is aggressive it is not BECAUSE of the breed necessarily. I had a dog aggressive dog when I was in high school and after some time of training her a couple hours a day she was perfect.   If someone can't take the manage or train a dog then that dog isn't right for you. But you aren't telling me that cesar milans dogs are dog aggressive because of their breed.
I don't think we disagree that much. If someone can't manage a dog then that is not a breed that suits them. That is not the dogs fault. Do research and get a dog that fits your lifestyle and personality."
dogs,feblywg,t1_febk0s1,1578960188.0,"Your dog wasn't bred to nip other dogs. It was meant to nip cattle. 
Pitbulls haven't been bred for dog aggression in a long time. Is it that hard to go to a breeder and see how the parent dogs are? Walk the parent dogs?"
dogs,febjikl,t1_febhofu,1578959459.0,"I am not denying breed traits. If you socialize your dog well from when they are a pup they won't get dog aggressive just because of their breed. People really underestimate socialization and training. My dog wants to catch all birds and animals she sees, by training her I now have control over the outcomes of her instinct. 
If you view your dog nipping others as a bad thing then do something with it. If you socialized her a lot as a pup other dogs would have corrected her. You could have trained her by directing the nipping towards animals that she needs to nip. This is like saying a police dog can't help but bite children, because that's what is in its nature ""biting""."
dogs,febh3ej,t1_fea8gem,1578958708.0,Also you say more likely. More likely does not mean that if a pitbull is aggressive that it is BECAUSE it is a pitbull. It simply isn't. There is no scientific basis for that. Correlation =/= causation.
dogs,febeqmp,t1_fea8gem,1578958109.0,"I never said they will be anything you want. Don't put words in my mouth. With treating them right I also mean letting them do their thing. If you get a hunting dog like me, then train it to be a hunting dog. Same if you get a malinois with a working bloodline. Though the most important thing in my mind is exercise. A tired dog is often a good dog.

Aggression is not a personality trait. It is the result of bad ownership. Whether this is abuse, lack of attention or bad training. Being aloof is not aggression.

Not getting along does not mean that your dog can attack others. A dog that doesn't like other dogs should communicate this and look for safety at the owner if necessary."
dogs,fea1j44,t1_fe9qhb3,1578943374.0,"""Although some level of dog aggression is characteristic of this breed, handlers will be expected to comply with UKC policy regarding dog temperament at UKC events.""Â 

Being predisposed to dog aggression does not make it the breed (apply that logic to humans). If you socialize and train well and don't abuse them you won't end up with a very aggressive dog. The decisive factor is more the owner than the breed. 
A malinois has biting instinct, just like my weim. With which I mean that if trained they will bite humans, which other breeds are often not willing to do. Does that mean that if it gets aggressive towards humans that it is the breed? No, if your dog is aggressive it is your fault as an owner."
dogs,fe9ms49,t1_fe9gz1t,1578939501.0,"Genetics doesn't make a dog aggressive. That has to do with the way it is treated and trained. Only in very rare cases a dog just is mentally ill. 

No I wouldn't let an adopted dog off leash before I knew its behaviour in multiple scenarios."
dogs,fe9kb64,t1_fe9e9fz,1578938635.0,I think it is great for the dog. You just can't really blame others for not using a leash (if it is legal and their dog is not aggressive)
dogs,fe9ednk,t1_fe912ws,1578936833.0,"Aggressive breeds? It's not the breed mate, it's the owner."
dogs,fe9c3hv,t1_fe93rn3,1578936234.0,Is that not to be expected in a state park? I always have my dog leashed but in an off leash area I think people should just not go there if they don't like other dogs to be off leash.
DobermanPinscher,f9g9gzi,t1_f9g7o8n,1575295679.0,"I didn't read anything about a location, so I just chose the country of the breeds origin"
