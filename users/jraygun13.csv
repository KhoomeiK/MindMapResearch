Apparently they found a crate of those on red and orange vinyl, and original pressings of Eagles of Death Metal too! Only $35 each, which was a steal. I thought that was really cool of the band to release those to the public."

I didn't do a damn thing but drive through a lot of them, but it was still a blast. It was much like your experience: we rocked out to all types of music on cassette tapes (Dwight Yoakam, Pearl Jam, AC/DC are ones that come to mind), and stopped at truck stops and ate & played video games in the truck stop arcades. I credit my love of music, road trips, and traveling to those times."

I guess the question would be do references to things that aren't referring to the state count too?"

After listening I would say they do have some stuff that has a psychedelic sound, but I don't know if that was the greatest descriptor. I would say they have some elements of The Smiths, My Bloody Valentine, and Yo La Tengo, with some grunge and a little psychedelia mixed in. Check em out if you get a chance!"
