For example, I had a problem with studying, I say to myself I will start studying at 8.00 and when the time comes instead I just sit down and start studying I overthink and start finding motivation or reason in my head to start. 

Then I started meditating, the best fucking thing ever. I manage to stop my thoughts with meditation and now when the time comes to study, I just shut my thoughts and sit down and start doing it without thinking. 

So you must learn to stop thinking and just do it and the only way is through meditation. I meditate 3 times a day for 5 mins. Its 15 mins a day that it will improve your life."

Second, create a plan, create your daily routine. You can't just stop playing games and watching youtube and do nothing. You must do something you must time you used for games to use for something else. Find a job.

You must have something to thrive for, you must have some goal our you will never break those habits."

2.)Stop masturbating and watching porn

3.)Find a place where you will only study. If you study at a table where you also watch movies, masturbate playing games... your brain connect that space with all those activities so when you start studying at that table your brain will trigger ""wantings"" to do those activities and not studying. So the best thing is to go to libary or create your own working space where you will only work and nothing else.

4.)Exercise every single day. You don't need to go to the gym just home bodyweight exercises (pushups, pullups, dips, heavy bag,...). 

5.)Eat healthy quit junk food.

6.)Get in time in bed. You must sleep at least 8 hours and you must go to bed between 21.00 and 23.30 so you get enough of your melatonin. Sleep in a completely dark room and wear a sleeping mask.

These are some tips that helped me a lot. I hope it will help you too. Sorry for bad English."
getdisciplined,fcrxd03,t1_fcqg2kw,1577907922.0,"I still struggle to completely quit smoking but I can give you some tips that helped me a lot. 

Before these tips you must know that you will face 2 types of cravings. Nicotine cravings and dopamine craving. 

Nicotine cravings are strong, for me, it felt like my soul is burning inside my chest but they pass. After month you will probably experience 90% fewer nicotine cravings so the first month is hardest.

Dopamine cravings are so much worse. They will last a lot longer. Dopamine cravings shuts down your center for rational thinking inside your brain.  You will experience incredible ""DESIRE"" for smoking, your brain will tell you lies that you want to smoke so hard. Dopamine cravings create ""wanting for smoking"".

So nicotine cravings are just bad fucking feel inside your chest that passes after a couple of minutes and they don't create WANTING for a cigarette like dopamine cravings. Dopamine cravings will start when you are in a place or doing some things you were doing while you were smoking. For example, if you used to smoke while you were drinking coffee, the moment you start drinking that coffee you will experience that ""desire"" and wanting for a cigarette. All things you connected with smoking will create dopamine cravings. Emotions create strongest connection. If you used to smoke when you feel sad or stressed or depressed or happy will create incredibly connection that even you are 3 months smoke-free when you experience some of those emotions you will have strong wanting for a cigarette.

The only way to break up smoking addiction like any other addiction is to say NO when you experience the urge to smoke. 

So the BIGGEST tip is to AVOID places and things you were doing while smoking and create new living space, new life habits,  new lifestyle.

Some other tips are:

1.)Drink lemonade every day without sugar, it will help a lot with your cravings.

2.) Take menthol bonbons when you have a craving, they help to forget about cravings.

3.) Exercise every single day, you don't need to go to the gym just home bodyweight exercise, (pushups, pullups, dips you can buy some dumbells) and I highly recommended heavy bag, when you exercise your brain gets a lot of endorphins like when you smoke so hitting a bag is a great thing. 

4.) Don't hang out and go to clubs or cafes. This is my last obstacle to completely become smoke-free. Because when i was in high-school (i started smoking when I was 15 now I am 22) I smoked a lot while I was hanging out and flirting with girls and i had a big problem with that. Because now when i hang out and don't smoke I experience cravings and I think a lot and can't be that same person I used to be while I was smoking. I could not talk with a girl with confidence I had without smoking. I could not party at all without smoking, i just couldn't. But then I realized that is all because of dopamine addiction and that when I am 6+ months completely free (4 months my highest streek without smoking, but in last 400 days I am 350+ days smoke-free) my confidence will be sky high and I will be even bigger and bader motherfucker I used to be when I was smoking.

5.) NEVER GIVE UP. If you fall start over, just never give up you will success sometimes.

&#x200B;

Remember all effort is counting. I struggle for over 2 years to stop but I can say that I am now 90% free only 1 obstacle have I left to complete, even you relapse just start again you will not be at the same spot as you used to be when you first started."
