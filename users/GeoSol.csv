I posted a bunch of discussions on this topic that include links from both sides of this diacussion.

Sadly it's only one side that acts this hateful about having a discussion on making vaccines safer."

And it's not the vaccine thats dangerous so much, but the adjuncts added them that extend their shelf life.

But obviously you haven't read much on both side of this issue."
worldnews,feuwqcc,t1_ferkrr0,1579390709.0,"Really? 

I've had more downvotes, and me responses to this post, than any I've posted before.

I've also ran into 2 people actually interested in a discussion and debate, and not a hatefest."
worldnews,feuwitt,t1_ferov7b,1579390638.0,"Well, it's a safe place to discuss both sides of an issue with an open mind, and not just spit vitriol at eachother.

Although that happens too, with those that don't frequent it much.

Also, these were easier to post, than the dozens of links in each post, referencing data about the issue."
