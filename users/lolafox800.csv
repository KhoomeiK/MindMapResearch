AskWomen,fdisekv,t3_elalri,1578449991.0,"I've thought about dating someone I didn't find attractive because I thought they would treat me nice, but either they were rude or I just couldn't stand the thought of being physical with them. I found that the less attractive men are usually more rude and just a horrible person, than someone who's attractive. 

Examples of rude unattractive men:

This one guy tried to get me to drink and actually pushed the drink towards me and told me to drink, when he saw I was taking too long to drink. He did this so that he could get me drunk and sleep with me. This person knew that I do things I regret when I'm drunk. I called him out on his behavior every time we hung out and he was embarrassed and stayed away.

Another guy thought commenting on how my sister was attractive was a compliment to me. It just offended me because I was there on a date with him, and he had asked to see what my sister looks like. So rude. He was a cop and his breath smelled bad and he was balding early. Gross.

Another guy kept on calling himself ""very attractive"" (he wasn't) and kept on talking about other women like we were in ranks. He said I am good because I'm not fat and I look pretty, but if I were the opposite of those two traits he wouldn't give me time of day. I was appalled because he clearly had a terrible personality and terrible outward appearance as well. 
 
So I stopped dating unattractive men and my life has improved. I have a kind and gorgeous fiancé with a heart of gold."

I got asked out from so many men in one day that managers told the next guy to stop talking to me and that if they don't have anything to buy to move on. Girls hated me because I was getting hit on by their boyfriends. I honestly don't think I'm that great looking at all. It was hell in my workplace and I quit. Best decision I ever made because now I work for myself and don't have to interact with anyone except my family, boyfriend and friends.
