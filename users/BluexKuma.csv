SuicideWatch,fc4lton,t1_fc4fu5n,1577420479.0,"well that explains it for me, i keep trying to rationalise why i always end up having negative thoughts. it never makes any sense. even minor things i am normally fine with become a trigger when i'm beginning to feel hopeful again."
otomegames,fbutsuy,t3_eefkjk,1577120245.0," I absolutely adore everyone in Hakuouki, but my favourite might have to be Kazama. My soft spot is Saito but the steam deluxe edition really made my dreams come true, with the additional pursueable routes. I love how he's quite the gentleman to her, emotionally at least, as he respects her boundaries despite appearing as a leering kidnapper. His willingness to help Chizuru find the Shinsengumi, and then wait for her to come back to him was super sweet. 

Thanks for the giveaway. I hope everyone a merry christmas."
