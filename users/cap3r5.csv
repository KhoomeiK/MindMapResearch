teslamotors,fez1em7,t3_eqxi2p,1579453024.0,"I have a hypothesis that may explain some of these claims. It has happened to me. It was about 1 month into own the car and I was slowly turning around it the driveway. I accelerated to just under 10 mph then wanted to slow down to make sure my front cleared a pole. So my regen was kicking in but I thought I should slow down even more just to be sure. It was new and my baby so I was overly cautious when I first got it. Instead of slowing down more though I accidentally accelerated rapidly. 

I cleared the pole but was left wondering for a second or two, what had happened. I then realized what it was. My muscle memory from driving an automatic dinosaur car meant that I was used to pressing on the brakes slightly if I wanted to move forward slowly. I thought the go pedal which (was slowing me down through regen) was the brake pedal. At the end of the day nothing happened except I nearly gave myself a heart attack. I did learn my lesson and since then it hasn't been an issue. I blame the years of ice driving as the main cause. 

I would like to see tesla implement a creep setting for when you aren't on a main road or something or are in reverse or something but at the end of the day the car was working as intended... I on the other hand was not. Call it a picnic error - problem in chair not in computer..."

science,femlnml,t1_femirxk,1579261604.0,"It is very much instantaneous. It was so strange and unexpected that Einstein actually drove himself crazy trying to prove it wrong and ended up failing.

The entanglement phenomenon was discovered and then its implications of collapsing wave functions when it was reconciled with a pillar that survived the discovery of quantum theory i.e. the conservation of energy. 

They discovered quantum entanglement. Then they originally thought at the moment of particle creation (the are created only when they are close to each other in spacetime) the particles share data of their wave probability. Then they discovered bells theorem which means they measure the spin at angles and yet how they measure the angle at one particle determines the spin at the other particle even though you did not decide how to measure until after the particles were split far apart. Then they realized this must be instantaneous otherwise it violates the of conservation of energy. 

So that leaves 3 options 1. The collapse of wave function in one particle means instantaneous collapse of the other one. 2. The arrow of time is broken and cause and effect can be reversed.  Or 3. The law of conservation is no more. Science has proven in this case, much to Einstein's chagrin, that the collapse of 1 wave function means the simultaneous collapse of the other or that time has no meaning. 

No experiment I have read about has suggested that 2 is the answer or even proposed a way to test it though most agree 1 is favored by occam's razor."

teslamotors,fdcjqfn,t1_fdcif4k,1578276611.0,"To get it up to that uphill position would take more energy than you could ever recapture. Even if your goal was to capture as much regen as possible going downhill and cared nothing of other factors such as safety, load capacity, durability, etc. 

Thermodynamics dictates some energy will be lost as entropy during any energy conversion. So assuming you don't start every trip at the top of a hill and all loads are not downhill, regen will still mean less range than if you carried the load on a flat road with all other things being equal.

Incidentally there is a mining EV that does use physics so it never needs to be charged. It does this by starting its day empty and travels uphill. Then when the load is added to the vehicle, it regens on the way down. That additional weight allows it to regen more than the energy it needs to get uphill. It is using potential energy of the material being transported as its fuel. This however is a very specific scenario and not applicable to most Semi routes."

You control it through your phone via the local network if connected to the same wifi or through the cloud as long as your phone has internet. This allows you to change and switch between bulbs and their setting with ease without having to jump from one bluetooth device to another.

2. It will keep the brightness and settings the same as you left them last unless you have a schedule. You can schedule it to change brightness or color or to turn on or off via the app. This will happen even if your phone is off as the commands come through the lifx cloud servers. You can also reset it to a neutral white and normal colors if you'd like by flipping the switch from on to off and back on in quick succession too. But simply turning it on and off should not change the bulb settings.

3. I highly recommend voice control. It is very nice at least for the bedroom. I use it to turn the light on and off without having to get out of bed. It is also useful for changing brightness and making the light more of a red hue as you get ready for bed. You can always schedule it I suppose but for me voice was clutch.

science,fcrkqme,t1_fcrbggn,1577903095.0,"The collapse of quantum superposition is instantaneous and is FTL however making it useful for now seems to be limited by the speed of light. The qubits themselves collapse instantaneously regardless of how far they are as long as they were created together. It was actually something that Einstein did not believe could be possible and one of main reason why he spent so much of his life trying to disprove quantum mechanics and unite it with his GR. He also though the probabilistic nature of quantum was wrong and said, ""God does not throw dice"". But I digress

The basic concept is that you entangle 2 particles of some kind. When they are entangled they are in a quantum superposition meaning they don't have discrete values for some of their properties. Then you can separate them as far as you'd like and as soon as you measure one, the other one has the opposite value. If it didn't, the law of conservation of energy would fall apart until light had enough time to get to the other particle. So either the law of conservation of energy is wrong, quantum mechanics is wrong, or the collapse from a quantum superposition to a discrete value is instantaneous. Einstein bet that quantum mechanics had it wrong and called it ""spooky interaction at a distance"". Turns out he was wrong and the collapse of superposition is instantaneous. 

How useful this will be is yet to be determined but yes, there is FTL collapse of a wave function to a discrete value. As it stands though you can not determine the value it will have so it is like sending white noise FTL. Information though that can be determined or controlled is not possible. Still could be good as a entropy or random value generator.

I would argue that although early and impractical now (much like computers in the 60's) moving qubits from one chip to another is:
1. Essential to future quantum computing 
2. Is ultra cool ( literally microKelvin level shit) if you understand quantum mechanics.
3. Hard to make sound cool or interesting or important as it is to non-scientists/physics majors which is pretty much everyone who would report on it.

Perhaps he is on one side where he is an atheist but thinks church is still important for social connection and can be used to do good in the community. Or maybe he is on the opposite side where he thinks all religion is bad and a form of brainwashing.

 It might be scary finding out but better to ask and find out now then to have to deal with it any further down the road.

As for me personally, I think religion was necessary for primitive man and was one of many lies used to unite people. Other lies include imaginary boarders of countries, money, and the value of symbols/trademarks/brand goodwill.

However as science has progressed in the last 400 or so years, religion has become less necessary and in many cases has reached counterproductive status.

But seriously I am not moving to a liberal state and swinging the electoral college even more towards the conservative side... I will forever be in swing states doing my part at the local, state, and federal level to make our voices matter as much as the other side."

Also just for fun I did the math for my Model 3: The gas tax is 0.385 per gallon. That means a $200 fee is equivalent to getting \~519.5 gallons of gas. That equates to 17,500 kWh of energy. That means right around ‭60k miles of driving per year and we are on equal footing. Why the tax is per unit of energy for gas cars and a flat fee for us, I will never understand. 

But no matter how you slice it, it is equivalent at best with a big prepayment of 5 years. If they DID ONLY charge $200 per registration and you do 5 years, it is like 12k miles a year in gas equivalent over 5 years. On the other hand, any less amount of time or $200 per year and it is outright penal in the anal."

aww,fc1b3np,t1_fc14x0l,1577313467.0,"Totally agree.. also great danes end up living short lives due to the strain on their hearts. If I ever become rich af. I want to start my own bread of dog and not go for any specific look or anything but just breed a longer life span dog and good health. 

All dogs die too young in my opinion if I could have my pitbull and doberman rottweiler mix for 50 years I would.

Edit: Also all my dogs have been and will be rescues."
