cats,ff220dx,t1_ff1zwg2,1579491657.0,Medium hair calico. That’s about all they knew when we adopted her. She is pretty ridiculously cute though.
cats,femllfr,t3_epuha4,1579261531.0,Photogenic and so serene.
knitting,fe3fk9z,t1_fe2l5u8,1578848796.0,That is exactly right!
knitting,fe2jf2o,t3_enncxi,1578839084.0,"Don’t let your mom drag you down. It looks great so far, and it’s your project. The only reason to start anew is if you want to. Keep at it and make something you’re happy with. 

You can always tell her what I tell myself, the mistakes let the demons out. If it was perfect, they’d get trapped in the maze of stitches. I don’t remember where I heard that, but it’s stuck with me from the beginning, and people don’t usually know how to respond so they shut up."
OrganizationPorn,fdrtclw,t1_fdr8b30,1578689485.0,I can only imagine. But the result is amazing. Hope you’ve got lots of projects planned!
OrganizationPorn,fdq6fce,t3_emo505,1578656900.0,This is the stuff of dreams!
menstrualcups,fdq66wm,t3_emh430,1578656617.0,"Signed up! I’ve been meaning to start giving some different cups a try, so this could be really fun."
menstrualcups,fdq54es,t1_fdo6y85,1578655264.0,"I haven’t tried out any yet, so I can’t say for sure, but I’ve been eyeing the Super Jennie. It appears to have less tapering from the rim to the bowl. 

I should have clarified, the Lena is what I have always been using and it works fine, just can have a tendency to have clots sitting on top of the mouth and make for a less than clean removal. 

You can always check Put A Cut In It’s menstrual cup comparison chart to see the width of different cups and look at their shapes."
menstrualcups,fdmw2nv,t3_em5r5e,1578568493.0,"I agree wit the idea of getting her a voucher to get one on her own, and also with the comment about Lena (my cup of choice), but I have some advice as someone with PCOS.

When looking for a cup, take clots into consideration. While I love my Lena cup, it was not super effective when I had to deal with large clots. If she has any issue with large clots, try to find a cup with a good wide mouth if she’s comfortable with it. 

Also, consider buying a few reusable pads or some period underwear (you can find reasonably priced ones on Amazon usually) for those times when the flow is too heavy for even the cup. It can really be a life saver with unpredictably heavy periods."
tea,fd9uawf,t1_fd9ni52,1578238126.0,That’s fair. It’s a wonderful set really! One worth keeping around for a long time.
tea,fd9n2x2,t1_fd9m3hz,1578235574.0,Yea I wouldn’t even think of getting rid of it. My parents let my brother and I choose which set of of their ridiculously large collections we wanted when we moved out. I chose this one and haven’t regretted it yet.
cats,fd9m5k7,t3_ekd7yr,1578235270.0,The level of cling in this video is perfect. Love it when cats just decide they must be near you at all costs.
cats,fd9ltqv,t3_ekc84l,1578235112.0,Like a little roly poly.
tea,fd9lqc0,t3_ek8ygz,1578235064.0,"It’s so interesting to see someone else with this book set! I always felt like such a weirdo for hanging on to it. 

And what better place to have a nice tea set up as well."
cats,fd9kspe,t3_ek8pux,1578234744.0,Grumpy cats are the best; it’s how we ended up with our baby! Resting grump face but a sweet cuddler ans playful kitty.
cats,fcxgx0n,t1_fcwnrkl,1578062635.0,Very much so!
cats,fcvytxq,t1_fcvvdoj,1578013213.0,Thank you! She’s well aware of it too. Uses it to garner favor!
organization,fcvbihr,t3_ej0qk8,1577998633.0,"I suffer from a similar issue. My best suggestion is to set yourself a rotating schedule for just a part of your days off. Spend one day thoroughly cleaning one space (just the kitchen or just the bathroom) and try to ignore the other spaces. If you find something that goes in a space other than where you’re working, set it aside in a pile and at the end, put just those things away. Rotate the spaces so that you don’t feel like you’re half-cleaning everything ans really get a good clean on each one. You’d be surprised how fast that can actually be. 

As for management on busy days, I know that’s hard work, especially being out for 12 hour blocks for work. Best tip I’ve found helpful, is if it can be done in under 5 minutes, just do it when you see it. Empty the sink or put away dishes. Come home and your bathroom counter is a little rough? Take 5 minutes and tidy and wipe. If you think something will take more than 5 minutes I’d you let it (very easy to do if you’ve got obsessive issues) set a timer and get as much done in 5-10 minutes as possible.  If your issue is you’d get too distracted it drawn away from the short tasks, then designate a set time (I do a half hour) and do all the things that are bothering you. Move from one space to the next and fix all the minor things you can do quickly.  Try not to let yourself bounce from place to place. 

Hoarding issues is another beast all together and you’re probably gonna have to consider it separate from your cleaning. But you can do it the same way as cleaning. Designate time on your day off to go through a certain area or collection of things. Go through all of your closet, or clothes, or kitchen wares, or whatever and be critical. If you use/wear it often, keep it. If you like it and it has special meaning to you (heirloom or sentimental gift) then keep it. If you’re keeping it out of obligation, or you don’t know why you’re keeping it, put it in a bag or box and put it somewhere obvious to get rid of. If you don’t think you’ll reasonably have the time or drive to put it up on a selling site, don’t even bother thinking it. Donate useful and good condition items, trash things that no one could have any use for. 

You won’t get everything all at once, speaking from experience, it took me 5 months to go through all of my things, but I filled my entire car with trash/donations. But then I just did another purge and I’m finding more things have accumulated. If you’re a natural hoarder, it’s hard to break that. You’re gonna have to figure out why you hoard if you want to stop. But you can at least manage it for now. 

Just don’t feel pressure to do all the things at once. Set a time line that is reasonable and tackle it step by step. Write it down if you have to; a list of everything you want done in a space. That way, if you find yourself getting distracted or off track, you can come back to the list. A schedule is not a bad idea, but if you don’t stick to them and you know that, then won’t do you any good."
OrganizationPorn,fculss5,t3_eimc9o,1577983795.0,This is inspirational. Wonderful job!
cats,fc5lh28,t1_fc5k3o7,1577460758.0,"That’s awesome! It’s gotta be sturdy. Ours isn’t a chonk but she throws herself at surfaces with the weight of 3 cats sometimes. 

Thank you!"
cats,fc52rhu,t3_eg8ec0,1577440119.0,"Biscuit looks like the best boy. And looks like he knows it too. 

Where’d you find your tower if you don’t mind me asking? We’ve been looking for something just like that for a while"
knitting,fbzgrsr,t3_efa5d3,1577246168.0,That’s a very clever solution! And looks like it would double nicely as a place to hold notions your working with.
menstrualcups,fbxpolp,t1_fbwotot,1577196960.0,That’s totally fair.
menstrualcups,fbwn6ne,t3_eepdbu,1577154323.0,"That’s the worse feeling. You stand up and you just...know.  Sorry this had to happen to you in such a vulnerable place, but it sounds like you handled it really well! 

If you travel a lot, possibly wet wipes may be a future purchase for cup travel!"
