bipolar,ff2nbdf,t3_emm7hr,1579514584.0,Edit: just noticed that in the title I said ‚Äúanti-convulsants and Lamotrigine‚Äù which clearly makes zero sense. I meant to say ‚Äúbirth control and lamotrigine‚Äù
MH370,ff201cu,t1_fei3bcd,1579490210.0,I hadn‚Äôt heard any rumors that the black box had been located. More info please?
bipolar,fet8de2,t1_fdqj1nn,1579372712.0,Thank you! This worked for me after a couple of days. I wonder if the Wellbutrin/buproprion generic that my pharmacy keeps switching could be responsible. I‚Äôve taken the same generic lamotrigine since after my post-diagnosis gradual increase.

illnessfakers,fesbk64,t1_feq8xvc,1579363541.0,"As someone with Type 1 diabetes and Celiac, I‚Äôm not embarrassed to talk about it, and due to having to take shots/test BG and request gluten free meals or refuse cupcakes, I often have to... but I sure as shit don‚Äôt want to make myself look any more fucking complicated or attention-seeking by mentioning my slew of mental health issues until I‚Äôve gotten to know someone well enough, let alone putting it on my IG bio. I can‚Äôt imagine waking up and thinking about what disorder/illness to claim or wanting to have one because having autoimmune and mental health disorders disrupts my ability to function like a normal fucking person, which I desperately wish I could be! The need for negative attention is just sickening. I wish there was a way to make all the illness fakers see that.

Edit: I do want to add that before being diagnosed with bipolar I did exacerbate some of my health problems to my ex at the time during hypomanic episodes after he stopped talking to me to get his attention. 2 years later and it still pains me to think about it. Amazing how these girls do it for years and years to thousands of people with little if no remorse."

JonBenetRamsey,fem9qm9,t1_fem4017,1579245051.0,"Everyone seems to be forgetting how Burke literally shit in a box of JBR‚Äôs chocolate and on her bed. Scatolia is common in kids with autism but not normal children. He had also been aggressive with JBR in the past and was likely jealous at the attention she received from being successful in pageants, which made him feel neglected. I can see his thought process being defensive over a piece of pineapple and that driving him over the edge with your sequence of events occurring."

bipolar,feim084,t1_fedbm5s,1579141665.0,"Yeah definitely does.

Can you take Lithium when you start to feel your stability declining but not when you‚Äôre doing well off of it?

Obviously, meds are very different for everyone but have you tried Lamictal? It‚Äôs worked really well for me. 

I don‚Äôt like the idea of having all feeling whacked out of you by medication either... Lamictal doesn‚Äôt feel like that at all."
bipolar,fed7cii,t3_eok30v,1579002294.0,"Definitely can relate on having difficulty with taking preventative measures instead of reacting. 

CBT techniques have been very helpful for me in restructuring thought patterns that can cause the same emotional spirals you‚Äôre describing.

Learning how to self-monitor your thinking, mood, and behavior, so you can see when it‚Äôs becoming erratic or unstable, also really helps.

Are you on meds by chance?"
bipolar,fe6r77i,t3_eo0v9a,1578901552.0,"Trauma. Trauma can also trigger or exacerbate bipolar episodes. Having PTSD, ADHD, and severe depression was the reason it took me so long to get properly diagnosed and treated."

MH370,fdqfddx,t1_fdqeuan,1578665247.0,"Thank you for your input and leniency. I‚Äôm not trying to start any arguments here, just putting forward the news of an event that demonstrates exactly the situation theorized by those who believe the US or other military force is responsible for MH370‚Äôs disappearance. I don‚Äôt even know what I believe anymore."
MH370,fdqecld,t1_fdqe72s,1578664457.0,"It‚Äôs relevant because MH370 did not send out a distress call before disappearing off of radar, neither did this aircraft before disintegrating. Not that I necessarily believe in the military cover up theory, but it does lend some credence towards the idea. 


Edit: We already knew this was something that can and does happen, but I just think it‚Äôs not something to discount since the plane hasn‚Äôt been found yet."
bipolar,fdqb5fl,t1_fdq947k,1578661777.0,"Hm ok, maybe I‚Äôll try that first, since it doesn‚Äôt involve much effort on my part (nor could it cause any problems for the most part) and I can‚Äôt see either doctor for a few weeks. Thank you!"
bipolar,fdov2hk,t1_fdoffft,1578613532.0,I feel so lucky that Lamictal works so well for me (along with Cymbalta/Wellbutrin)... It‚Äôs nice to have some stability and better ability to control myself when I‚Äôm in an up or down swing. I wish it worked for everyone just the same üò¢

bipolar,fcmao09,t1_fcm8hlr,1577768864.0,"Type 1 diabetic speaking here, it absolutely is the same. If I do not take my insulin, I lose control of my blood glucose levels and metabolism. If I continue to not take insulin, I lose my ability to function. If I further continue not to take insulin, my organs will basically eat themselves, and eventually, I will die.

If I don‚Äôt take my bipolar meds or follow the regimen and self monitor, I might feel a little sick. If I continue to not do those things, I might slip into episodes or rapid cycle, fuck up my life and relationships. and go through full blown withdrawal. If I further continue to not do those things, I will begin to have extreme intrusive and suicidal thoughts along with the episodes and I‚Äôll probably eventually die by doing something erratic and dangerous, or by committing suicide.

So yeah, be responsible and take your meds, home slice. Bipolar obviously affects you the most, but it also affects all the people you love and other people around you. So if you‚Äôre not doing it for yourself at first, do it for them."

BeautyAddiction,fc5ljz4,t1_fb6hyh5,1577460816.0,"The Fresh seaberry oil is so awesome! It‚Äôs pricey like $65 but totally worth it and it lasts for an entire year for me. I‚Äôm not a big fan of the (normal in clear travel size bottle) rose floral toner personally, but the hydrating one is nice. The only issue I have is with the scents in the products. They can be a little strong and it makes me worry about irritation sometimes"
BeautyAddiction,fc5l60c,t1_fc3g1b2,1577460536.0,"I was actually looking at that when I was at H-E-B yesterday (TX grocery chain... y‚Äôall non-Texans are really missing out lol) and was wondering if it was similar but I didn‚Äôt know if it would work the same. Have you tried it? My main concern is the product irritating my scalp and/or making it more oily. Badlands works like a charm, and I could go to a specialty salon to pick it up, but if there‚Äôs a product I can buy that works as well as that does at the store when I‚Äôm already going to be there anyway, it would be more convenient lol"

BipolarReddit,fc2bmty,t3_e9rbv4,1577350595.0,"When I look back on it, I think the switch from Adderall XR to Vyvanse prior to being diagnosed was what really kicked off the emergence of bipolar for me, but it didn‚Äôt fully present until about 7 months later when I had a miscarriage. I was mostly just really irritable and sad most of the time, and when I wasn‚Äôt, I was experiencing excitement and anxiety out of nowhere on a very frequent basis. 

When i was on Prozac many years ago for depression, it turned me into a blob incapable of producing appropriate emotions.

I was also put on geodon as an adolescent for a brief period under the care of a very progressive child psychiatrist, and that made me super sick (I‚Äôm a type 1 diabetic and it put me into DKA), so I stopped seeing him and the discussion surrounding emergent bipolar was put on the backburner.

Currently taking 60mg cymbalta, 300 Wellbutrin, 100 lamictal, 20mg Adderall XR, and then xanax/klonapin/lorazepam as necessary to calm myself down and/or sleep (when I‚Äôm realizing I‚Äôm mixed/manic this works really well to calm down the intrusive thoughts and abundance of rage/excitement, and also slow my thinking enough to where I‚Äôm able to think and evaluate the person/situation before I respond, rather than reacting to the person/situation based on my current mood)."
