UrbanHell,ff6dl79,t1_ff67phf,1579624883.0,"Literally the wealth of Western nations built on colonizing placed like Indonesia for centuries--laying the ground for an unbelievably uneven distribution of wealth across parts of the world and segments of society--and you think that a major barrier is peoples decision to eat a banana instead of a bag of chips? (p.s., wealthy people/countries eat chips too, and choose chips over bananas plenty.)

I'm not doubting you've been dedicated to your work and genuine passion for improving peoples lives.  I'm sure we both share the frustration and sadness that comes with seeing such squalid conditions. But wow, the issue is not ignorance, my friend."

&#x200B;

EDIT: Getting downvoted for saying it's sad that this person is saying poor people are too stupid to not be poor and have cleaner environments where they live/play/work.

This is what this sub is... blaming the poor for their ""UrbanHell"". Unsubbed."

Yeah I'm afraid this is pretty characteristic of poverty/capitalism/imperialism. This is everyday existence for so many people in the world and not at all unfamiliar to many in countries like the United States."

That's 24,090,000,000 sunrises and sunsets ago. And that was just the end of their time on Earth--nothing to speak of the  quadrillions of days before then. 

Evolutionary time really is mind-boggling. We're a blip here on this planet, and we can't even fathom just how much so."

But also, for the folks in this thread, emasculation does not mean becoming homosexual. One can be masculine and gay, obviously. Masculinity here refers to the performance of his gender identity...i.e., his manhood being about war/being stoic/dominative

What does idiot Malkin think masculinity should be? Quoting OP's (/s) comment down below because they already answered: ""He's standing next to a woman and not treating her like property. And she's even confidently talking in public!"""
