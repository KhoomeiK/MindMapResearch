They voice their mind just “as is” and are unable to understand how hurtful their unwanted opinion can be.

You could have also said that cars aren’t  much of a thing to but you drive a (insert car name) and it means much to you because (story time) ...

Small talkers like stories more than anything else. They want to read your experiences like a book and find themselves in those stories again. Once she says anything like “me too!!!” you can’t really go wrong anymore."

Obviously the “3 questions” were important to her, like the basics what a guy must have to take him into consideration. You basically ignored her very attempt to figure out if you’re worth dating. I can assure you that she would have met up with you if you answered those questions seriously and a little in depth. But instead you brushed them aside and she obviously didn’t like it. Next time, try to read the (virtual) room better."

Sure, you were nice and polite about it but still, it was clear that she didn’t want to meet up without any further information to judge your character. Chat a bit, tell her about your past life, your future life, your passions and find something you both like. Sure, you’d rather want that to happen face to face but she made it clear that she was unsure about you, so she tried to get more information. Look at her reaction, every time you revealed something about yourself she was ready to meet up because it gave her confidence and a better picture of who you are. She’s obviously a small talk person, so you’ve got to roll with it. I’m sure your life is interesting enough to find more things to talk about when finally meeting up."

There’s nothing you can do about this but to accept that right now, he’s just not in the clear with himself. I’m sure he’ll come around eventually but that could take years. My advice is to put an end to it and look for someone new. Maybe in like 5 years you’ll find together again but right now I don’t see anything good coming from this.

Mit deinem Nettogehalt würde ich maximal €550.- in Miete investieren. Dazu kommt ja auch noch Strom und Gas, Internet, Essen, Fahrkarten und was auch immer. €1700 ist nicht viel.
