AskReddit,fe8538f,t1_fe81zl8,1578922675.0,"I would jump straight into Udemy. It is MUCH easier to keep track of progress and many of the instructors actively monitor (or have TA‚Äôs that monitor) the discord chats and comments on the course to help answer questions. It‚Äôs incredibly valuable and definitely worth the $10-20 investment. Most of the courses start with the assumption you know absolutely nothing, so no need to do prep for them."
AskReddit,fe84ozq,t1_fe834i7,1578922530.0,"The one I used for MySQL was by a guy named Colt Steele and it‚Äôs called The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp. For more advanced stuff I used Michael Juhas‚Äô Practice Advanced SQL Queries with MySQL 5.7+ (his teaching style is NOT for everyone though, but there aren‚Äôt many advanced MySQL courses on Udemy that can teach you about window functions, cursors in stored procedures, stored procedures in general, etc.). 

Python I recommend Jose Portilla‚Äôs. He has one for Python (Complete Python Bootcamp) and one that does a deep dive into Pandas and NumPy for data science tools (Learning Python for Data Analysis and Visualization). 

Tableau I used Kirill Eremenko‚Äôs series of courses - I did Tableau 10 A-Z and then followed it up with (but never finished) Tableau 10 Advanced Training. Really solid courses. 

You should take Colt‚Äôs class before any of these - he does a fantastic job teaching about data types and concepts that will creep up in other courses. You should follow it up with Jose‚Äôs first Python course if you plan to learn that since he takes a deeper dive into data concepts and language that is also useful in the other courses. Take Jose‚Äôs second one after you learn Tableau. Going through all the courses will take you about 2 months full time or 6 months part time if you have a lot of discipline."

LifeProTips,fdp1u7q,t3_emc893,1578617994.0,"I‚Äôve worked for several data companies... they don‚Äôt delete your data, they just archive it and sometimes anonymize it. Frankly, the train of thought is that if there is a data leak, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you leaked 5 million or 50 million records - people are still going to be pissed. So you might as well just keep it all. It sucks, but there‚Äôs not much you can do as a consumer other than not use the services - it‚Äôs nearly impossible to determine that the data exists through an audit if it‚Äôs hidden correctly so the only way you‚Äôll find out is if it gets leaked and by then it‚Äôs too late."
