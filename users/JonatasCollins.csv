LearnUselessTalents,fesfw3e,t3_eqhu26,1579364751.0,"To me, is about the tongue position, you put your tongue on the upper part of your mouth rigth where your teeth should start growing (you can feel a little curve with your tongue) and then you want to make your tongue U shaped, then you can close your mouth in a shape of an O but leaving a little bit of space for air to come, and every breath that you take should be a whistle, once you get the tongue position right you can even change the shape of your mouth to make different tones to match what you're actually singing along, I hope I could help

Tldr; TONGUE UP, MOUTH ALMOST SHUT, BREATH"
