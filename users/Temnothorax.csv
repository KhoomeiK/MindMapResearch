Swallow and gag reflexes are pretty robust compared to say orientation. However the patient should be the one putting the liquids in their mouth.

That’s just not reflective of how people will actually respond. It’s more important to tell Putin to stfu, stop deflecting, fix your shit. Him saying “u first tho” everytime Russia is criticized means he never has to fix shit."
worldnews,fcjpmob,t1_fcjp4hf,1577698274.0,"It’s just, I don’t feel like you are taking into consideration why Putin even brought up the whole poland thing. It’s obvious that he was trying to make people care less about Soviet responsibility. Bringing up what Poland’s ambassador did/said back them makes people care less about the original conversation. It shouldn’t work that way, but it’s not exactly secret knowledge that human beings are not perfectly rational creatures and exploiting that flaw is a bad thing.

Also hypocrisy attacks can be totally true, but totally irrelevant. Hypocrisy is a character flaw, and is annoying, but like so what? Is it worth derailing the discussion regarding Soviet fault for WW2 to make a separate argument about poland being hypocritical? Can you see how hypocrisy arguments derail conversations? Don’t you think one of those arguments is way more important than the other?"

AmItheAsshole,fc0vblg,t1_fc0swgg,1577300595.0,"Sometimes a disproportionate response makes up for the fact that the person making that response didn’t have a choice in whether they would be involved in a conflict.

Like, if I catch someone stealing my wallet, I would have a right to use physical force or even violence to get back my property. Violence is disproportionate to theft, but the thief had a choice in whether they would be involved in the theft, whereas the situation would be forced on me.

If someone is berating or insulting me, they don’t get to decide my response insults went too far."
todayilearned,fbx58bi,t1_fbuytbh,1577169882.0,We use “neutropenic” because there are so many types of immunodeficiency diseases with different levels of severity. Everyone already knows what to do for neutropenia so if someone requires the same precautions no one will be confused about what to do if the patient has a disease they aren’t familiar with. Also neutropenia always requires those precautions whereas something like AIDS might not.
