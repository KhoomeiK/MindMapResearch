There's a lot of irony in that name."
BipolarReddit,ff5wz9g,t3_ernxer,1579613035.0,"29 after an unexplainable elated two weeks followed by the worst depression I’d felt in years.

 Bkg. I had on and off depression since high school but no qualifiable “hypomanic” episodes."
ADHD,fdaah3s,t3_ek6jsi,1578243688.0,"The funny thing for me is that the drifting and inattention didn’t start right away. When I was little I could power through books like a champ, but as soon as I had to do anything “serious” I just could not do it. I could read single sentences or a paragraph at the high school level and then be asked questions about it and excel but when I was on my own doing it for exams down the road I was middling at best. My retention absolutely blew."
BipolarReddit,fcyib9j,t3_ejh5x3,1578080608.0,"Lithium is kind of a yo-yo for me. Sometimes it really sucks: I’ve put on 20 lbs since starting it in July, my hands tremor in the morning, early morning stretches are ratchety, and I can’t think clearly at times. On the flip side I don’t have the depressive patches that ate my lunch, so there’s that.

Considering that lurasidone caused AkAtHiSiA and gave me horrible nausea and vomiting and quetiapine put me to sleep the SGAs are probably out the window.
...I guess Lithium is a good fit...

But yeah, I want to quit it too from time to time."

bipolar,fc3qaqp,t1_fc2pbkj,1577395947.0,"I still find it so interesting that lithium is such a useful drug given its utter simplicity. The most complicated part of delivering it was which anion was best. Meanwhile, the SGAs are all a little different and are waaaay more complicated structurally than a simple monovalent cation...

/me is chemist."

bipolar,fc0vb9o,t3_efi8q5,1577300588.0,"I like eMoods, I have two new tracking points: “energy” and “difficulty focusing”, these are at times far more useful to me than tracking elevated mood. The two new factors are very cyclical so far."
bipolar,fc0v6st,t3_efa65t,1577300491.0,You kicked ass! I’m glad things are working out for you! I wish I’d had the presence of mind to get evaluated in college.
bipolar,fc0v284,t3_efj7nh,1577300389.0,Dude that’s really awesome. It’s expressive while retaining a realistic portrayal of the tree. I wish you all the best and a Merry Christmas.
ADHD,fbleeya,t3_edtx7c,1576961796.0,"I did. I fortunately didn’t have to deal with a busy lab and my work was all pretty quick without long experiments that I’d fuck up.

I got lucky. I would not have otherwise been able to finish in all likelihood."
