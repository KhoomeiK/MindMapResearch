aww,ff4atou,t3_erja5n,1579559307.0,"I used to live with my father-in-law. His neighbor had three large dogs tied up 24/7 outside with no fence. They also had a cat and a small dog that lived inside the house.

*THEN* they got a puppy. That made me so mad. I knew exactly what was going to happen. That puppy was going to grow up and join the large dogs outside.

The state we live in doesn't really have any laws against mistreating animals as long as it's not anything crazy extreme. So we couldn't do anything. Makes me mad."
