BeautyGuruChatter,ff241rj,t3_er5j00,1579493222.0,There are so many YouTuber parents who successfully make regular videos without any help? I bet they get really tired of hearing someone trying to put them into the one box. You can be a parent and (successfully) do other things too.

BeautyGuruChatter,fepwt68,t3_eqboqm,1579333736.0,Am I the only person who thinks snitchery’s recent lip look is not flattering at all? It’s okay when she’s pouting but the lip shape is straight up weird when she’s talking/smiling etc

fatlogic,fel2riv,t3_eppxr0,1579212806.0,Okay what’s going on with this diabetes misinformation going around?? Have they not even attempted to understand how type 2 diabetes works or are they just looking for confirmation bias?
loseit,fel15ip,t1_fek6lmu,1579211821.0,Thanks for recommending this!! I’ve been looking for an app like this for a while
StudentNurse,feixayx,t3_epb8cv,1579149777.0,"I just graduated and felt very nervous right up until the last day of placement. I live in Australia so it’s probably slightly different, but you have pretty heavy expectations on you, especially in final year. You’re basically expected to be independent with no interventions from supervisors. It’s normal to be nervous! We’re still baby nurses."
BeautyGuruChatter,fdxnmur,t3_en9ybc,1578770947.0,I can’t believe he’s going to be living in that big ass house alone. He could really spiral and end up in a dark place.
BeautyGuruChatter,fdxmuhh,t3_en9ybc,1578770736.0,The fact that family was trying to sell their breakup to the media is a disgusting reality. Imagine going through a breakup of a long-term relationship and then knowing your family sees it as an opportunity to make cash
BeautyGuruChatter,fdoev6k,t3_emd5lh,1578603799.0,"I’m not really into Sam posting cryptic things like this recently. If you’re going to only dip your toe in, don’t say you’re not trying to stir the pot. 

Even in her recent video about the no-buy, Sam exposed that girl (keeping her name and profile picture heavily featured in the video) too. Of course haters shouldn’t be able to beat influencers down, but it just left a bad taste in my mouth."

medizzy,fdmlgk1,t1_fdmk8hr,1578554400.0,"I’m an OR nurse. Sometimes the patient will request photos to be taken. Most of the time surgeons will take photographs (especially during laparoscopic surgeries) so they can be placed in the patient’s chart and recorded (for diagnostic, legal purposes, and sometimes deciding a treatment plan). 

Usually whoever is unsterile at the time (like the circulating nurse or anaesthetist) takes the photos."
australia,fdes14i,t3_eky78w,1578345404.0,Thank you so much!
australia,fdd2m66,t1_fdd2bhd,1578292282.0,"Why are you denying something so hard that requires far more extensive research, when all (minimal) findings thus far have pointed toward man-made warming being more of a contributor? Just seems silly to ignore the best of what is available currently. Denying something for the sake of denying it isn’t useful."
australia,fdd25mf,t1_fdd002m,1578291782.0,"I chose that term as it is the most researched aspect of solar changes when compared to greenhouse gases. Sorry but all journals and reports from recent years conclude that more extensive/concise research is required in solar forcing, and allude to greenhouse gases being an uncontrolled experiment on the climate. In fact, huge solar changes would be required to cancel the effect of greenhouse gases. Why on earth would you want to roll the dice that is heavily in favour of man-made warming?"
australia,fdczoon,t1_fdcyyqf,1578289192.0,"It is not one or the other. Yes, solar radiation makes an impact on our climate. However, the degree to which solar radiation warms the atmosphere is minimal compared to man-made impacts. It is important to understand that this concept is still being studied extensively, however, I’d tend to trust the 97% of scientists who have dedicated years of their life to study this subject and agree climate change is an issue regardless. https://eos.org/science-updates/better-data-for-modeling-the-suns-influence-on-climate"
australia,fdcuthh,t1_fdcuh3b,1578284936.0,"There's a huge body of evidence built by scientists to support climate change action, who could be making *far* more money being in the pockets of the coal/mining industry instead. It's like these Facebook warriors cling onto one denialist who's wearing a fucking tin foil hat and just run with it."
australia,fdctiex,t3_ekmz6l,1578283871.0,"Reading the comments from climate change denialists and Greens blamers on Facebook is shortening my life-span. Proud of not just Russell Crowe, but every single celebrity who mentioned the fires. They may just be a drop in the bucket, but they hold a lot of influence."
StrangerThings,fdcsr5r,t3_ekjt20,1578283269.0,Whenever I rewatch the series I always dread episode 7. It felt so out of place and even comical at times.

australia,fcw5bog,t1_fcw38cq,1578017502.0,"Indigenous ecological knowledge combined with western science should be implemented. For example, their involvement in wetland burning in Kakadu in collaboration with CSIRO. It’s based upon their Indigenous seasonal calendar and knowledge of fire behaviour, vegetation, water and weather."

fatlogic,fcw4hkh,t3_ej6o9x,1578016946.0,A doctor is the first person to know that health issues aren’t always diagnosable with weight. They weigh patients in necessary situations. Imagine undermining someone’s  8+ years of study because you think you know better than them.
BeautyGuruChatter,fcw1u6h,t3_ej7xuc,1578015194.0,"This sub doesn’t allow crossposting; this was originally seen on r/KUWTK. My main thoughts on this are: Kylie’s collections are pumped out way too quickly and I predict this will be part of the company’s demise in the future. It makes them look cheap. 

Also, people are angry that she seems to be featuring Stormi heavily on her YouTube/IG in order to advertise the company and their new launches. The main sentiment behind this is that Kylie once said she wish she didn’t grow up around cameras as a child, and now she’s doing the same to her own child. Thoughts? Is this exploitation or a proud parent wanting to share harmless moments with her child?"
fatlogic,fcw0uj0,t3_ej6o9x,1578014543.0,Weighing is necessary in order to prescribe medications. If someone comes in with a bacterial infection are they going to avoid being weighed and potentially be given the wrong dosage of antibiotic? Steroids? I’d hope the doctor would refuse treatment and educate the patient instead. Ridiculous.

nursing,fbvkc0h,t3_eekenw,1577132041.0,I wish they used these more in OR because I’m a mouth reader and some of the surgeons are known to mumble quietly when asking for something. I always feel like an idiot asking them to repeat over and over
