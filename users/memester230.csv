Darth Senate was a Dark senate of the Senate, so powerful and so wise he could use the senate to influence the Senate to create Senate... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Senate is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his Senate, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his Senate everything he knew, then his Senate killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from Senate, but not himself."
