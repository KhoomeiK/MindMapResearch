Like, both sides have their merits. Speak your mind and move on. I really wanted Bastion to be like Lumina in that we worked with anther lore character (Saint this time) to build the gun. Am I a little disappointed, sure, but I'll move on and continue to enjoy the game for what it is: great gunplay, amazing lore and world building, and an ever growing concern about Telesto."

Idk if they will ever see this comment, but I greatly appreciate the love and commitment to quality of the product. I'm sure their shareholders roll their eyes now, but will grateful once these games hit the shelves and blow audiences away."

Her songs remind of Justin Beiber's work when he was younger; very young vibe cringe work, but good in it's own right. I hope one day she does something with bands I enjoy as I'd love to hear what she can really bring to the table with that voice."
facepalm,fepgi8s,t1_fep767p,1579319912.0,"Dramatic overreaction? You honestly sound like one of those lovely type of people who disable safety features because ""they're stupid"" and end up getting hurt. The action could of been carried out without publicity, but as any person who has lived in the world for longer than five seconds knows, that isn't the most likely outcome in this day and age. All it takes is the manager, the call lady, or the lady who received twenty bucks to open their mouth once to start a problem. The biggest fires can be started by the smallest of sparks. 

How is it you can acknowledge the supervisor approved her break to leave, but fail to grasp that means she is still on the company's time? If you're off the clock for lunch or on your own personal time, you wouldn't be asking to leave the grounds, now would you? You're also right, this isn't kindergarten, which is why they expect you be professional and understand that in that contract you sign where you acknowledge when you are on the clock, you are representing the company and it is to be enforced. Not to be ignored because you wanted to do a good deed for someone. Not to mention, it is also a potential breech of privacy  and potential lawsuit for the bank that this woman used personal information from work to literally hunt and stalk this woman down to do the nice deed. Talk about a major issue for the bank and not to mention a sign that this woman can't be trusted with such information, but ""good deed"" right? 

She did a personal good deed because she had a heart, on someone else's dime, time, and reputation. You have made it clear, that you don't understand the concept of being on the clock and performing anything outside of work. If you are racking up money on a company's time, regardless, you are representing that company. This is very much a fire-able offense by every company under the sun in the US if you're breaking their code of conduct. Yes, we do put ourselves at risks from time to time, but that in no way excuses her of her actions, just because they were pure. The manager should of known that the desire to leave the office with stolen personal information was bad from the start, but very much like yourself, right now, saw the good deed before the company's view of the situation. This is also one of those situations where all this could of been completely avoided had she waited till after work ,on her own time, and anonymously helped this woman.

""No body  is going to hear a story about someone getting a generous helping hand..."" literally plenty of stories of good people doing good things getting screwed over throughout history because of their good deeds reaching the ears of others. What kind of bubble wrap world do you live in? I'd like to join you there where no good deed goes punished.

I spent all of five minutes writing that basic HR and lawyer PoV of how the company views the situation. Also, you sound like you work at the service desk of a retail store. There is a very big difference in giving into a customer who is in your store, making stupid request and you just meeting them halfway because their request isn't too outlandish and pushes things along vs stealing a clients personal information, leaving grounds to go to their residence on the company's time just to give away something to help someone out. If you can't see that, I can't help you. Also, large companies don't just give stuff away. You don't just walk into any store you want and say ""I see you have 12 cans of beans,  I'd like one of those cause I'm hungry"" and they just give it to you. This isn't how reality works in the slightest and we both know that.

I said companies **don't typically** give things away, but donate to companies that specialize in giving things out. If you've worked in any place higher than a a front desk customer service rep, you would know exactly what I mean when I say this. There is a lot of potential problems that can occur with giving things away from PR nightmares to lawsuits. These things are handled with a lot of care and outsourced to companies that handle things specifically in these manners. Just because you don't see the other company's name up in lights, doesn't mean they don't exist. You don't need to see that the trash pick up is being handled by ""The Garbage Guys"" to understand that the company themselves aren't actively taking their trash to the dump themselves, but hired an outside company to deal with it."
facepalm,fep4etk,t1_fep391a,1579311890.0,"Funny how when it's not your business, money, reputation, and liabilities on the line that exceptions should be made because it was a ""good thing."""
facepalm,fep1zum,t3_eq3o7l,1579310351.0,"So... She left on company time and dime to go seek out a customer to give them her own personal money. The only facepalm here is on the woman and the manager who approved of her action. From the business PoV, you got an employee leaving while you're paying them to be there in the facility, you got a manager approving the unapproved action, you got a missing employee that isn't helping other customers, you got a potential risk of personnel injury to employee outside the building while on the company dime, you got unapproved company dealings. Doesn't matter that it was a good deed, all that matters is you are on the clock and at that point in time, you are representing the bank. 

""Your bank gave free money to such and such, where's my free money"" is all they will hear and I know that many will throw a fit about how it was her personal money, but that doesn't matter. Any person who has ever worked in the real world know that this type of out of line behavior brings in the worst types of people into your establishment. This is why large companies dont typically give away free things, but donate to other companies that specialize in giving out things. This type of action, while selfless on behalf of the employee, only will cause issues for the bank. Next person to come in with money issues is gonna bring up this and ask why they aren't being given the same treatment. It's a nice deed by the woman, but a bad image for the bank.

If you still don't understand, then look at it this way: how many stories have you read the titles here on Reddit, only to read the story or comments on the story and find out that the article title was a total farce? How many people are gonna here that a bank gave twenty dollars out to a person who was struggling instead of ""bank employee"" gave?"

AskReddit,femdxwu,t3_epxnfo,1579250528.0,"My ex fiancee. First girl I was ever so completely madly in love with. Sacrificed for her and put up with a lot of her own deep-seated problems for years while pushing her to further reaches in whatever she wanted to set her mind to. Then when I was injured at home due to her negligence (to which she never did take responsibility for either. Wanted me to blame it on work) and couldn't bring money in like I was, she cheated on me. She destroyed my credit score, stole my dog and a couple of family keepsakes, broke my heart, and piled so much of the blame on me for why we needed some time apart. I beat the ever living shit out of myself for half a year till I learned the truth of all that she had done. Lost almost 90 pounds due to starving myself from depression and fought tooth and nail to try to prove to her how much I loved her till that day when someone pointed out to me the truth because she stabbed them in the back as well. She was proud of what she had done and that just made me completely lose myself. I try my best to forgive and forget, but no amount of time will ever expunge her from the bitterness she imbued in me for her."

A few months of living together I get outted as not doing anything around the apartment. It hurt, but I told her if that's how she felt, she could do all the chores for a week. Week passed and a lot things piled up (trash, laundry, dishes, etc) that I normally kept up on throughout the week leaving very little during the weekend. We made up after that, but that hurt knowing that she paid so little attention to how small the work loads were and just assumed I had done nothing at all."
gaming,fdqya0v,t3_emsbme,1578676654.0,"Nintendo has always been a shit company when it comes to their sales and re-releases. They will wait till a game sells a certain number of copies at full price and it doesn't matter how long it takes. Then they release it with again with a slightly smaller price tag and that shitty border thing telling you it was a player choice of a game. Took you guys five years to hit projected sales, it's no one's choice apperently.No other company could get away with this shit. They love that their games are a massive nostalgia magnet and that people happily turn blind eyes to their shenanigans regularly. 

Don't get me wrong, Nintendo games are fantastic usually, but their sales division are a bunch of asses."
