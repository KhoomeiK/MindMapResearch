In order to have that much grass over the pavement it has to have been let go for a long time. The roots pull the dirt above the pavement and create their own as some of the grass and roots die and decompose.

Basically the only reason tattoos work is because the WBCs are unable to remove the ink from your skin, not all the particles are this big and that is why tattoos fade over time. The laser breaks up the particles and makes them easier to remove."

DIY,ff8zt1z,t3_eqxd1j,1579701173.0,"I'm purchasing a house in Anne Arundel county, MD and we have a few DIY projects in mind to improve the property. But, as usual I'm pretty intimidated by the permitting requirements and I'm not completely sure where to start. Here's a list of the improvements:

* Cut and install sliding patio door into foundation (assuming building permit, possibly engineering stamp required)
* Cut and install egress windows in 2 rooms (assuming building permit) \[one is holistically above grade and does not require a well to be dug, the other room is not\]
* mostly gut/rearrange the master bathroom to include removing a walk-in-closet that you have to go through the bathroom to get to (there's another sizable WIC in the master) and making it a 5-6 piece (sink, sink, shower (maybe double), toilet, bathtub) rather than 4 piece (sink, sink, toilet, shower/bathtub) bathroom (building permit, electrical, plumbing)
* Cut non-existent exterior window into the house for master bathroom (building permit?)

The AA county site says an electrical and plumbing permit require that a master electrician/plumber has to be associated with the permit. How does that work for DIY renovations? I'm confident with electrical and most plumbing applications. Where should I start? Should I just walk into the permitting office and tell them what I'm planning to do and go from there?

They are to VISUALLY inspect and report on the mechanical workings of the property and recommend if something should be assessed or repaired by a licensed professional (it doesn't have to be licensed, that's a CYA term). To be clear, the inspection can be used to back out of the real estate contract (for basically no reason at all)

* Normal for inspectors not to test water softeners, if there was something visually wrong with the system his report would have said ""recommend assessment and repair by licensed contractor""
* Your HVAC, he said in his report it was rusted and should be assessed/repaired by licensed contractor. You chose to not have that done until it failed.
* Home inspector usually points out 'negative grading' that can have water infiltration on the foundation, sounds like he put that in the report.
* Most home inspectors don't even comment on the trees on the property unless it poses an imminent threat to the structure. Most inspectors are not arborists.
* Roof: the inspector probably said the roof was in the last third of it's life and you should have a couple years left on it.. that is not a guarantee that storms will not cause damage and a subsequent leak. Most asphalt shingle roofs last between 15-25 years, you should have been able to find some inkling of how old it was prior to closing on the house. 
* Foundation settling, this happens all the time and it can happen quickly. The inspector told you about moisture down there, he did his job. 

Bottom line: the house is 65 years old... you bought an old house and you will have issues like this pop up. It sounds like you got a house that is more troublesome than the average but thus is life. If you like the area then stick it out and have a thorough inspection of the house and actually listen to what is put in the report and have contractors come out and assess the issues that it points out."
