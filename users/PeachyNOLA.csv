Also, if there are a lot of people that are negatively impacted by her mom's drinking, & want her to get help, they should look into setting up an intervention. Would be better tho if an adult set it up & took the lead, so that your friend didn't catch any backlash."

Also, your roommate needs to grow up & take the responsibility of an animal seriously. Ask your vet if they have suggestions on how to stress the importance of taking proper care of the kitten, or even see if she's willing to talk to them so they can explain things."

Both times it only took the manager about 5mins to get there. So either the managers are expected to be on call, or they should be there but skip out. 

If they run out of change, then i guess it's a matter of, do you have an alternate form of payment, do you want to wait on the manager or a kind stranger that has change, or is what you're buying just not that important?"

He wouldn't dream of touching them inappropriately, but he just doesn't get personal space.

I don't know how Jake would handle it, but the only way to get my guy to back off is to flat out tell him ""I'm not interested"", "" You're standing way too close, please back up"", etc. He doesn't understand when someone is being subtle, so being blunt but kind is the best way.

I went yrs where i didn't go anywhere w/out my ""shields"", & it just got worse the more i did it. If you give in to what she wants, all you're really doing is enabling her codependency.
