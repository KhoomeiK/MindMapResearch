We don’t need to burn it (like the nazis did burn art), but we also don’t need to spread it (like the nazis did spread their demagogies).


His signage is no integral part to the “art”, and OP already defaced his “art” by memefying it, all i ask is for him to deface it a bit more. People entertained by the “artist’s” demagogies will find the source anyway, as they have the motivation by entertainment.

So where is the problem with not shilling for that dude?

Even if it is art (imho a question of opinion, in mine it isn’t, in yours it is, agree to disagree?!), it would stay “art” incase we do not mention the artist…

You don’t complain about basically every piece of  unsigned art in your daily life. Maybe in a movie? Yes, you’d complain if you’d know. But in the most cases you don’t, be it the art of fontdesign shown on traffic navigational signs, the art of productpackaging, etc.. 


The only time you really do, is when an artist makes money by spreading their name. You stand up for a guy you don’t agree with. Funny how you propose, it is due diligence in this case.  I supposed to not shill for his shit (whatever art or just demagogies) by simply removing his name as well, as it would support his endeavor to red-pill vulnerable people.
You say, defacing it, by removing his homepage(a nonintegral part of his “art”), would violate his rights as an “artist”, but don’t bat an eyelash at the defacing of the integral part of his “art” in the first place.

So tell me why would you support him? It isn’t his art, it has  been defaced, one panel cut, the content altered, the artists “signage” already is obsolete, so why do we need to have the homepage there? Shouldn’t the creator of this meme put their own name there? As he is the current author?"

Our schools have a three level system and people from the highest level are preassured into taking aprenticeships even though they are able to get a degree because as you say”not everybody needs to study”

That is a general phenomenon worldwide, in germany even people with the highest school degree are preasures into taking apprenticeships once reserved for the lowest schooldegree because bluecollar jobs lack aprentices


> The major they study in does not correlate to their profession of study, think a business major doing real estate. Also the education does not break down the day to day challenges people will face in their profession. For the vast majority they go to college, get in-debt and then learn what they need to learn from their jobs.

Similar here in germany, besides the crippling debt for a degree not needed in society right now

> Education in America is actually very affordable if you go to an in-state college and live at home till you graduate. 

In germany education is considered a human right thus it is free, and you can get cheap loans to cover cost of living( you won’t be bothered to pay back until you got a job and you won’t need to pay back in full)

> To attend a community college for the first two years would be no more than $5000. 

we got private universities not listed in the above that charge less…


> After you can transfer to and tuition is typically 5-10k per year at instate. The total cost of education is 25k, 

25k more than in germany to get a degree from a top notch worldrank university

> maybe 30k total once you factor in a laptop and books.

We fot libraries holding all books neccesary for the degree of choice, and laptops and other studymaterials (books if you fancy a book you want to own as well)can partially be deducted from taxes up to 5 years after you finished your degree

> You can also choose to work during college and earn 10k a year without too much difficulty. This means that after 4 years * 10k/year earnings - 30k tuition = 10k left over.

You can so that too in germany if you want a bit more money on the side for livingcost, generally your parents are obligated to pay for livingcost until you finished your first degree/aprenticeship, if they are unable you can apply for that sweet ass loan i mentioned before

>The above scenarios is only chosen by a minority of US students. Teenagers are idiots and make dumb choices, also their parents don't stop them. They decide to go out of state where tuition is 20k/year or go to a college that is nicer/higher ranked but is 4-5x more expensive. 

Funny how they chose to get better education and get drowned in debt for that, we don’t have that here( the debt, we don’t have that, we too don’t lack idiots)


> In addition, it is expected you won't live with your parents after 18 (its out culture but honestly who gives a shit) and so you'll need to pay for room & board which is an addition 10k/year or 30k/year total. 

That is also pretty expensive, i have my degree and pay less for living cost in the third biggest metropole per year(5k for rent and utilities and a good 4k for food clothes etc)


> This means you'll graduate a 4 year university with 120k in debt which is a pretty fucking terrible deal.

Which we don’t have at all, loan i mentioned is capped at 10k payback afaik

> Now there are circumstances where that type of money is absolutely worth it. Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Berkley etc are top tier and if a person enters the right major and plays their hand well, they can come out of college making 100-200k easy.

Niedersachsen up to 500€ (also no university out of the 16)


All the others have absolutely no tutition fee for anyone.

So to get a high profile degree you simply do not have to pay any tutition fee and for a second degree or in case you take longer than usual  you can simply pick or transfer to a high profile university not ln these 4/16 states...


Go read books

Oh btw the companies you mention all offer paid programs for dual studies(a degree paired with an aprenticeship) so in these cases, if you got the neccesary grades in school, you even get paid to get such an degree.

To add insult to injury, if german universities had the same funds us universities generate by bleeding out their students, we wouldn’t see as many us universities on the list.

That is why the us gets so much shit from a german pov, the dutch f.e. have their own reasons, and brits will simply point out the top 5…(and to be honest, i saw my own university <duisburg essen> on the top 100 list and was baffled)"

You mean fortnite?

Well what about the loot though?


> What I'm saying is that Rust is a hell of a lot more fun when the whole server is actively roaming and playing more minimally.

So fortnite? Don’t understand



Because I didn't feel like writing out ""Open world FPS with base building and survival mechanics.""

I also understand that if 100% of players never farm then the game becomes an eternal bow-fight. The only reason to grind a big base is to protect your stuff from other people who will grind a bunch of boom to raid it. If you don't care about the stuff, and the process of getting said stuff is enjoyable (the PVP), then getting raided doesn't matter.

> I feel like you're asking how a hypothetical all PVP Rust would work, or more specifically where the base level stuff comes from. It's literally on the ground, or in boxes when you run the road, or from PVP <sic>events like rig and cargo and chinook. 

Exactly from pve /survival aspects of the game 


> You can basically get everything you need from outpost with minimal scrap.

Again pve elements... 

I don’t say pvp isn’t part of rust but it is maybe 1/5 of it... get it? Grind out another a better base and don’t just pvp to complain how your loot is gone because you mainly pvp and offline raiding is too op. no mate it isn’t if you actually don’t build youtube bases everybody knows..."
