cats,fb10gd2,t3_e0lxv8,1576431023.0,"Unfortunately Spiderman passed away on the night of Friday the 13th. He died surrounded by people who loved him very much. His ashes will be in a cherrywood box with ""Spidey, everyone's favorite cat"" and he really was, everyone loved him, even the vet that he bit out of pain when he lost his back leg to a car. He purred all the time, I always said he had a pilot light purr, he always purred. Always. Rest in peace my Spidey Cat. üòû"
