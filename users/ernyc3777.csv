Edit to add: I just remembered when I went to a Giants game this year that they had fast lane concessions that actually worked. There was a sign above the facade before you even entered that said what they sold. It was all quick serve food/drink. 

It worked because the POS at the front wasn't coded to punch in the chicken finger basket the Deluxe Nacho so you'd be wasting your time trying to cut the longer line.

If they had a black coffee line with a POS that can only punch in S,M,L, then it would work. BUT it would be a waste of money for the company to buy a brand new register and have a dedicated employee stand at it waiting for black coffee orders."

Physics,feetvj7,t1_feem788,1579041100.0,">An enormous amount of a supernovaâ€™s energy, a whopping 99 percent, is carried away by a burst of neutrinos (of all flavors) in a span of about 10 seconds. The core of the collapsing star is incredibly dense, but because neutrinos interact so rarely, they escape from the center even more quickly than the light does. Neutrino observatories will thus be the first places on Earth to see a supernova and can be used to direct optical telescopes to the right part of the sky to witness the arrival of the supernovaâ€™s light. Many neutrino detectors are connected through the Supernova Early Warning System, orÂ SNEWS, which will trigger experiments to record and save additional data if a sudden influx of neutrinos (indicating a supernova) arrives.

This is from https://neutrinos.fnal.gov/sources/supernova-neutrinos/

So basically since neutrinos get a ""free pass"" through anything and everything, they exit before light which is why we can know they're coming"
