Go to your teacher and sit down with them.  Tell them about your struggles and find a solution to get those assignments in.  Once I started doing that in college my life got a lot easier.  Your teacher doesn't want to fail you, but they also don't know what you're going through, and you can't let your diagnosis become an excuse not to take responsibility or you'll end up spiraling even more.  Perhaps you can work on the assignments during lunch break and the teacher can provide a quiet place (the classroom) to do so in.  Or maybe they'll give you an alternative assignment, which you then can try to get your parents involved in keeping you accountable for finishing. Emphasize that you don't expect to be given 100%, and that you just want to do what you can to overcome the obstacles you've has so far."

facepalm,fe6l3rf,t1_fe6kk6a,1578894499.0,"The picture is incorrect.  A drainage pipe from a nearby bathroom was blocked and leaking (nothing suggests it was septic from the toilet).  The water seeped into the wooden cross from the stone wall that the statute shared with the pipe, and then out of a nail hole and down to the feet of the statue. Hence it seemingly coming from no where.  They were able to discover this by removing some of the stone and checking the pipe.

Unfortunately, the person who made the discovery has since had to flee the country under fear of persecution by the government, specifically for violating a law against ""deliberately hurting religious feelings and attempting malicious acts intended to outrage the religious sentiments of any class or community."""

As someone who dealt with a stalker in one of my college classes, I strongly recommend her going to her professor, and then the dean of the subject if the professor can't resolve it.  In my case they dealt with the stalker and I never saw him again, and I was also able to make up classwork I'd missed because I was too scared and anxious to go to class.  While it sucks that she doesn't know who he is, the class should be able to accommodate her in some way that keeps her safe."

AmItheAsshole,fe5yysg,t1_fe5ymhv,1578878069.0,Absolutely agree with this.  As my grandparents/aunts/uncles/parents get older gift cards become increasingly common as gifts because it's easier than trying to shop for 20+ individualized gifts.

While a specialized gift may feel more thoughtful, it's rude to be ungrateful for what you're getting, which honestly based on your post is quite generous.  As long as you're not being forced into buying gifts you can't afford or being told you can only buy gift cards for other people, leave it be."
AmItheAsshole,fe5ssy3,t3_enuhxr,1578874161.0,"ESH.  You bought from a shitty backyard breeder/puppy mill.  If you're going to buy from a breeder, you should have done more research into the breeder. Should have seen the parents. Should have gotten the vet records of the sire and dam.  There are a lot of simple things you should have done that would have prevented this and while you may have made a mistake out of pure ignorance, now you know for the future.  Always do your research before investing in any animal.  While I support the idea of of punishing backyard breeders/puppy mills for the shit they pull I don't think you'll have a legal case unless you have a contract that is written in your favor, which is unlikely."
AmItheAsshole,fe5r388,t3_envghu,1578873356.0,"YTA. It costs nothing to tell people who don't know your family you have a sister. You don't have to specify ""trans sister"" and open it up for discussion. She's just your sister. It's uncool to intentionally misgender someone when they're not around."

Sounds like this person needs relationship counseling though."
