OpiatesRecovery,feidhnc,t1_fehr9ah,1579135957.0,I’m in twice weekly therapy as well as a combination of 4 different psych meds. Maybe it’s more than opiates - maybe it’s not. But I definitely felt a happiness and pleasure on them that I no longer feel.
OpiatesRecovery,fehi1gn,t3_ep3bo9,1579116956.0,"Two years out and I’m still waiting to feel pleasure again. Lot of hope in this thread, OP, but reality is that some of us never feel the same again."
marvelstudios,fdsa0ny,t3_emqbxd,1578697795.0,What am I missing? Why is this better than just watching it on my 75” TV?
OpiatesRecovery,fdgitbd,t1_fdfm4w5,1578398565.0,You can ease the pain just a little - try subs. For all the hate they seem to get they are the single most effective long terms treatment available to treat opiate addiction. No other program/method/drug has near the success rate. Then once you’re stable get into therapy and address the underlying reasons for your addiction. Good luck.
opiates,fczbhsa,t1_fcwonub,1578097571.0,I’m all about the memes my friend - they ring true for a reason. We as addicts can usually relate to one another in a way most can’t. We share a unique pain that bonds us. I hope you didn’t think I was criticizing the meme - just responding to someone about the aspects of withdrawal.
opiates,fczbb9v,t1_fcw0isx,1578097466.0,"Yeah...anxiety is exactly what brought me to oxy. Nothing has ever worked to cure my anxiety the way opiates did, so I definitely feel you on that. Good luck my friend. Please be safe when you’re using and happy to answer any questions if you ever want to try getting clean."
opiates,fcvkmd4,t3_ej4gdb,1578004114.0,"Here’s my thoughts; if you want to do drugs, do drugs. If you want to be in recovery, use MMT. Don’t do both. You’re going to OD and fucking die and then you can’t get high or recover. You can only feed the maggots."
opiates,fcvkf49,t3_eivu8u,1578003990.0,So this happened to you and you’re still actively using? God damn addiction is a bitch.
opiates,fcvk5ps,t3_ej2j4a,1578003828.0,Is there no chance you’d be able to see a doctor that can write you a script for subs?
opiates,fcvjxhz,t1_fcv408m,1578003684.0,"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, and while I don’t want to downplay how awful the physical aspect of wd is, it doesn’t hold a candle to the mental.





The physical is more or less over within a month. Mentally you have to fight cravings to some degree for the rest of your life. That shit takes a real toll on your mental health. The rebound anxiety, depression - all that accompanied with the fact that now you very likely have to deal with whatever emotional/mental thing that’s broken inside you that lead you to be an addict in the first place. Plus you’ve numbed your emotions so much for so long you have a hard time figuring out what it is, exactly, you’re even feeling. Sad? Angry? Morose? Happy? Sometimes you can’t tell which is which, and you’ll cry not knowing how you’ll ever be whole without opiates again.


I’m 19 months and still really in the thick of it. I don’t want to be a bummer or scare you but it’s a tough fight, one you’ll have to choose to fight over and over again every minute of every day. Good luck homie."
SuicideWatch,fcswjgp,t3_einsh4,1577926912.0,"You got into college, graduated high school and are intelligent enough to reach out for help. That is the opposite of a loser and failure."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fcldkqg,t3_ehrty3,1577745333.0,"Sounds tough. Congrats on your sobriety. I didn’t get any context for how she feels about her decision. Did she regret it? Did she think it wouldn’t matter? How did she respond to your dismay?


I won’t say it’s impossible for two addicts to recover as a couple but i will say the odds are really stacked against you."
science,fceosu8,t1_fcae0f6,1577622458.0,"Damn. This hit me hard emotionally. I’ve spent my entire life (40 yrs old now) telling myself this part of me that finds men attractive is fucked up, wrong and that I’m just imagining it. I know what you’re saying isn’t scientific but for whatever reason I suddenly feel so much less alone. Thank you."
SuicideWatch,fc3g3vq,t1_fc3e5z4,1577389033.0,I’m sorry you fee the way you do. If you comb through my post history I think you’ll see I understand and empathize better than most.  I wish I could tell you it gets better - for some people it looks like it does. But I’ve felt this way for most of my adult life and often feel like I’m hanging by a thread. I hope things change for both of us.
SuicideWatch,fc1ufqw,t1_fc1tw7h,1577330062.0,Nobody wants to be depressed my friend.
SuicideWatch,fc1trht,t3_efozs6,1577329459.0,"When you say you don’t want to do that again - well, that’s life friendo. Meet someone and it doesn’t work out 5 hours, 5 weeks or 5 years, it ends and you’re back to square one. That’s the whole gig. Life is nothing if not a constant series of starting over and trying harder.


I’m sorry life hasn’t aligned with what you want. I know it doesn’t help you to hear that this is just how it is for everyone except a very lucky few. But you get to choose your reaction to life. That’s it. You don’t get to pick what you’re handed. Only how you handle it. Good luck."
