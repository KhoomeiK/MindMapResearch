educationalgifs,fedagtb,t1_fed9o27,1579005668.0,"It's much more complicated than that. Germany was broke and could not possibly have paid the reparations. They used credit, lent by the Allies to rebuild (laudable) to pay the reparations. So the Allies were being paid by the same money they lent

Either by design or accident this massive debt contributed to the collapse of the mark and the massive unemployment you pointed out.

The reparations meant that borrowed money was not going on infrastructure...as is happening in the US right now: massive borrowing with few assets being generated from it.

It's a fascinating area to study, don't you think?"
educationalgifs,fed9iqv,t1_fed2wmd,1579004706.0,"In Churchill's book ""The Gathering Storm"" he says the crippling reparations demanded by the Allies dragged down the German economy and contributed to their economic collapse in the 1930s. This opened the door for Hitler and the Nazi party to seize power.

If you in the USA, my experience might help you. I am first generation immigrant (now a US citizen) from the UK and one of the things that struck me about the USA was how long it took people to figure out what they wanted to do. I met students in the late 20's and early 30's who were still vacillating about what to do. So at 18, I am not surprised, nor worried, that you don't have a direction.
