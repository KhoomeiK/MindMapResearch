And the bottom line is that I think the majority of us don't want to date trans.

No offense to them, and I'll still call them how they want to be called and support equal rights for them, but I'm not going to date one ever.

I'd rather be cheated on then find out who I'm dating is trans. In a way it is cheating. It's deceitful. If you're going to date as a trans, you need to disclose it like the first thing out of your mouth or you're just going to have issues down the line."
