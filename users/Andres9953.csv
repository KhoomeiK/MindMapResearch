RandomActsOfGaming,ff42go0,t3_eravl9,1579554094.0,"Hello, thank you very much for doing this! You are awesome.

My first pick is Euro Trcuk Simulator 2 and dlc. I have always loved this game. I just love listenning to the radio and chilling while I drive. I haven't bought it as it is really expensive in my country and I only played a pirated version, which I played several years ago and I don't want to pirate anything anymore. 

My second pick would be Hollow Knight. It seems just so pretty.

My favorite Australian is Steve Irwin. I always admired him when I was a kid. He was a real inspiration and a wholesome person who was kind to animals. I became really interested in science and animals thanks to people like him. And also, after the incidicent, I just love to see that his family continued with his legacy and have played an important role in preserving species in Australia, namely during the recent wildfires.

If you are from Australia, hope you are ok and also know that you are an awesome person for doing this kind of giveways. People like you make the difference."

French,femyib0,t3_epznip,1579272870.0,"Audiovisual translator here:

Subtitling and dubbing are done by different people in most cases. In one hand, if you translate a movie/series and you want to add subtitles, you normally have to shorten what is being said due to space and time limitations. On the other hand, translating for dubbing is a bit different, as you translate the script that will be handed to voice actors. You are given more freedom because an actor can speak as fast as a character in the film, yet you have to pay attention to lip sync at times, so you might change a word in order to match or mirror what is being said. And finally, if some languages are simply different, like English and French, and literally translating everything is not an option. For jokes, bad words, etc. you have to be creative and change it a bit so it would make sense in the target language, and you also have to pay attention to censorship, that mostly applies to subtitling, when you are asked to. In brief, it's difficult for subtitles to be 100% similar to the dubbing or the original audio."

Quedaría así ""explicarme cómo usarla..."". Este cambio se debe a que ""cómo"" tiene un valor interrogativo. Pero descuida que este es un error que los nativos cometen mucho y es muy difícil de detectar.

Si quieres saber más sobre esto, puedes consultar este artículo: [https://www.fundeu.es/recomendacion/como-con-sin-tilde-diferencia/](https://www.fundeu.es/recomendacion/como-con-sin-tilde-diferencia/)

Y lo único que se me ocurre para ayudarte con el ""ya"", es ver las diferentes acepciones de la RAE, que puedes encontrar aquí: [https://dle.rae.es/ya](https://dle.rae.es/ya)

Al final, mientras más leas, podrás ver su uso en diferentes situaciones.

learnspanish,fdam8au,t3_ekckmm,1578247620.0,"Look up for ""tilde diacrítica"", it is when you add an accent to some monosyllabe words, which shouldn't always have a written accent, in order to give them a different meaning. For instance: ""tu"" (your) vs ""tú (you); ""de"" (of) vs ""dé"" (to give); si (if) vs sí (yes); and there are many many more which are often overlooked by natives, even tho they sound the same. 

Also when you wrongly chance words with the same sounds, as it's been already commented above. For instance when you change ""v"" for ""b""; ""s"", ""c"" <---> ""z""; ""ll"" for ""y""; and so on. 

Here are some random examples, I  often see, of words with the same -or similar- sound but with different meaning.

\-porque, porqué, por qué, por que

\-baya, vaya, valla 

\-haya, allá, halla 

\-has, haz, as

\-A ver, haber

\-Ay, hay, y ahí

\-calló, cayó

learnspanish,fd673ae,t1_fd4u9rh,1578186478.0,"Well, this really depends on the person. I had never formally studied English before, but I got to practice with video games. So I did not actually realize until I already knew a bit. But the moment when I felt things ""clicking"" was when I was able to watch Youtube videos without subtitles.

Regarding French my experience was different, as my mother tongue is Spanish, so it was easier for me as both languages come from Latin and have a lot in common. And I was also formally studying it in college, so it took way less, just a couple months, for me to be able to understand and communicate in a superficial way."

My linguistics teacher told us that the differences are only noticeable in some regions, for instance in Andalucia, Spain.

Teachers do not say that to simplificate. It has been stated by the Real Spanish Academy (RAE), and they are not longer pronouced differently nowadays: [http://lema.rae.es/dpd/srv/search?id=d45ahCOicD6TkHkns8](http://lema.rae.es/dpd/srv/search?id=d45ahCOicD6TkHkns8)"

But as others said, it depends on the context. I could get into a store and say ""usted"" if there is an older person. But if it is full of young people, then ""tú"" feels way more normal. 

Regardless of which one you use, you can always omit the personal pornoum when speaking in many cases. E.G: ""¿(usted) sabe a qué hora llega el tren?"" / ""¿(tú) sabes a qué hora llega el tren?"""
learnspanish,fd4ko3y,t3_ejzmmq,1578168441.0,"The ultimate test is when you are able to undertand the most subtle things, related to idiosyncrasy. For example, you at some point will realize when something sounds natural (or not) in the language when an non-native speaker says something.

Also, when you are able to identify slang words, sayings, puns, among others. Those are the harders to learn imo, as even native speakers may stuggle with them. 

But asides from that, you will eventually realize that now you can say, listen to and read things you wouldnt have been able to in the pass. When I started studying English, for instance, I notice how I was suddendly able to understand Youtube videos, then how I was able to comunicate with natives, and so on. The best way is comparing those things that now you can do, and couldnt in the pass.

Espero haberte ayudado."
