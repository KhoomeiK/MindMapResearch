DiagnoseMe,fedgspt,t1_febv4wx,1579011122.0,I like to stick with unmedicated because just chemical avoidance. I use chapstick religiously year round though so it can’t be much healthier.
DiagnoseMe,fedgmhi,t1_fed8rst,1579010990.0,Wow that looks almost exactly like what I have. I feel a tender sensation when I breathe in a way that lifts my chest. Thank you so much! How did you treat it?
DiagnoseMe,feceg84,t1_febx6kg,1578971968.0,Thank you. I plan to schedule another doctor’s visit soon and hopefully get an X-ray and see if I have any hairline fractures or anything.
DiagnoseMe,febnefg,t3_eocmck,1578960646.0,Something similar happened to me a while back. Chapstick might help.

AskReddit,fdrefdz,t1_fdrdefj,1578683360.0,Similar story with my dad. They just had a really late-life child and I was both done with putting up with their shit and not about to drag a young child through the constant fights I grew up with. The breaking point was my father trying to put me down for not acting like a perfect daughter after a trip there. It’s been about a month and I feel so much better. I should’ve done this *long* ago.
AskReddit,fdre8ao,t1_fdrdgxq,1578683239.0,Oh my god. Wow. Good call.

cats,fdlf3wn,t1_fdhvd51,1578522664.0,"Right? Some people are downvoting chicken leg comments, but I honestly find them cute because that’s exactly what I said when I saw her. She has little stubble there now; I think the most interesting thing to see will be it half grown because then there’ll be hair everywhere but it will be different lengths.

Can’t wait for her to feel good in a new pair of full-grown pants through. 😉"
cats,fdlewgk,t1_fdhw757,1578522540.0,This comment I can respect. Have an upvote for stating your standpoint kindly.

cats,fdlelf7,t1_fdl5vkt,1578522356.0,I’m so happy for her! They had to put a screw through her pelvis but thankfully that’s it. I’m so glad she made a recovery and my heart goes out to her.
cats,fdl2fs7,t1_fdhwaza,1578515915.0,"Me too, but thankfully we managed to get her to surgery in time. She is in no pain now thanks to the surgeon and some painkillers (which we took her off of yesterday)"

cats,fdjzuw4,t1_fdjwrmy,1578492502.0,"I appreciate your concern, but please take this argument to a post suited for it. She is a pretty kitty and I posted her because I figured Reddit would enjoy a little love for her. I am tired of people telling me how to raise my cat. I appreciate the respectful commenters and am disgusted by rude ones."
cats,fdjzb61,t1_fdjx0fc,1578492071.0,"Poor thing, I send my love and my sympathy. May they have a long and fulfilling life with you as their caretaker, kind redditor."
cats,fdjwp2f,t1_fdjiy8a,1578489927.0,"Thank you for trying to rephrase, but I have enough comments telling me how to care for my cat. I respect the lack of jargon in your comment, and wish you a lovely day."
cats,fdjwlwm,t1_fdjk0sg,1578489850.0,"No no I am the owner, I can’t see the rest of the thread for context on your reply for some reason but I am the owner. She does tend to act a little more like a community cat because she enjoys the love, though 😂."
cats,fdjwi5h,t1_fdjk622,1578489759.0,"We own her, but she does wander around and take love from several of our neighbors."
cats,fdjwff5,t1_fdjkzed,1578489694.0,"Thank you for your concerned comment. Letting your cat outside is not a sin and this injury is not my fault, she is pampered and taken care of. Please note that cats have different personalities and some really are happier going outside. Most of the world let’s their cats wander, and she’s in far better conditions here. Please take this argument to a suitable thread, but your concern really is appreciated."
cats,fdjw8k6,t1_fdjmaht,1578489527.0,"No one’s kitty ever gets injured in our neighborhood. She roams in a school zone and doesn’t roam in the morning during the school craze. Drivers are slow and careful. It’s also a neighborhood with many young children so it generally calls for attentive drivers. There will always be a small risk, just like there will always be a small risk of a wreck when you’re in a car, but I truly believe this was an accident and nothing else."
cats,fdjw2hh,t1_fdjn4in,1578489379.0,Thank you ❤️
cats,fdjw1e0,t1_fdjn6ni,1578489352.0,"I do not agree, but I make an effort to read every comment and I reply to almost all of them. As I said, they have been read and taken to heart. There is nothing wrong with giving an animal a bit of time outside and I’m tired of people telling me how to treat my cat. Please appreciate her and her good vibes and move on to a thread created for this debate."

cats,fdjvwxm,t1_fdjpgti,1578489242.0,"I respect that, and thank you for your kind words. May Cecil have long and fulfilling life ❤️."
cats,fdjvvy0,t1_fdjmd51,1578489218.0,"I have tried the harness training and every toy imaginable, she is simply one of those cats who needs outside time and this doesn’t make me a monster or poor caretaker."
cats,fdjvsth,t1_fdjq8ly,1578489138.0,"Me too honestly, and anyone who posts otherwise gets downvoted immediately."
cats,fdjvrjz,t1_fdjqv4t,1578489106.0,She shall!

I really do love comments like yours. It has been read and taken to heart."
cats,fdj9hao,t1_fdj97km,1578462346.0,"And I hope you find a better place to vent negative emotions. Constructive criticism is combed over and appreciated. I do not need to agree with you to respect your opinions. I do not respect your comment, as you suggest taking her away from her love, her family, and her best friend (our other cat). I am not the cruel one here..."
cats,fdj8m1s,t1_fdihkkk,1578461583.0,Please do not spread your hate. Letting a cat in or out isn’t necessarily wrong.
cats,fdj8i12,t1_fdj81qy,1578461485.0,"She won’t be going outside for as long as we can keep her, but we won’t deny her a peruse through nature once she is healed. She is a happy cat and her lifestyle is vet approved. Not every cat can be kept indoors and not every cat enjoys the outdoors. It’s a play it by ear sort of thing, and I totally respect both sides of the argument. She lives in a suburb btw so she is much safer than in a city."
cats,fdj8b3i,t1_fdj84go,1578461316.0,"Because in a debate with pros and cons on either side, the opposite side is not necessarily right (or wrong). You are a hurt/damaged person and I hope you heal. Please find a different release for your negativity as far away from my kitty as possible. She doesn’t have room for bad vibes rn."
cats,fdj86as,t1_fdj4fhx,1578461204.0,"I send my love. I’m sorry for these cats and for you. We can’t keep them caged because we are scared, but I do respect that and I respect your experience and your opinion. May you never have to see a cat suffer again. ❤️"
cats,fdj80k0,t1_fdj7tgc,1578461068.0,"Counseling is a thing, better place to siphon your emotions. You are not constructive and are simply looking to vent. I accept constructive comments happily as I respect everybody’s opinion, but I have no respect for wanton venting. Please appreciate the picture and move on."
cats,fdj7b10,t1_fdj79vp,1578460475.0,Thank you. She is happy to accept the good vibes.
cats,fdj71qd,t1_fdj70uh,1578460265.0,"Good to know. Looks like someone ripped me off...

Edit: I do not understand why I am being downvoted... when I made the harness I was told it did not work because she had different anatomy because of her breed. I lost a lot of karma on this thread because I don’t put up with bullshit and rude replies trying to tell me how to care for my cat. I had done my research before getting her and she is well taken care of. Please stop dumping your side of this controversial topic on my thread people."
cats,fdj6vq3,t1_fdj5vdw,1578460125.0,Haha have my upvote. I just wanted to post a pic for happy vibes for a healing kitty.
cats,fdj6ad7,t1_fdj663j,1578459639.0,"Noted, but she is in a very safe and pet friendly suburb. Cats roam regularly. They rarely sustain injury. I respect your opinion, this is my choice on how to treat my kitty."
cats,fdj62ng,t1_fdj5uby,1578459466.0,"No they are not, I do not use that term derogatorily as she is a kind and gentle soul. Letting your cat out is owner’s choice and there are pros and cons either way. She was not happy despite our efforts and constant attention *and* her partner cat until let out. She is a smart and nimble creature. Accidents happen, tha my my for your concern but the hate is unwarranted."
cats,fdj5ubi,t1_fdj4i90,1578459279.0,She’ll knit herself a new pair of pants soon 😉

Have my upvote. I am not against indoor cats either, but this one wasn’t happy without going outside. She shall be scratched in your name."
cats,fdj43b0,t1_fdiouto,1578457907.0,I’m sorry to hear. May he rest in peace.
cats,fdj3zm9,t1_fdj3q1b,1578457829.0,"She is neutered! We wouldn’t let her out otherwise, and she was inside for the first year until she could mature and properly learn the ropes of kittydom from our older cat."
cats,fdj3vav,t1_fdj3ubo,1578457739.0,Oh! Are they okay?
cats,fdj3th3,t1_fdj3a54,1578457702.0,"I respect your opinion, but some cats really need the nature. We are lowering the risk as much as possible while keeping her happy and healthy. I sincerely thank you for your concern, but if you are looking for a neglect case this is not the post."
cats,fdj3q8h,t1_fdip4xe,1578457635.0,"Already she is eating more and her stitches go out tomorrow! Roughly 5 more weeks and she should be almost fine, the vet says."
cats,fdj3l8w,t1_fdirxqw,1578457529.0,Will do. She is loved and safe. She has a good home. She is not abused and is constantly given love and attention. Thank you for your concern.
cats,fdj3i09,t1_fdiseu1,1578457462.0,"She has all her legs, camera trick. Some of the hate I’ve been getting is more understandable if you factor in that illusion, but not excused."
