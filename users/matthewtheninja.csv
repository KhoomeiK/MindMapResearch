Woke up in my house and it was super dark, but I couldn't turn the lights on which is what is usually my trigger to realize that I'm dreaming. Unfortunately the only remedy for the darkness is to leave my house where I know that I can force it to be daylight outside. So I leave my room and head down the hall to the stairs where I can make my way down and out the front door. I get to the top of the stairs and look down, the light from outside flickers off and everything goes dark for a split second and when the (still very slight) light comes back there is a shadowy figure standing menacingly at the base of the stairs.

>we did it because we didn't have the same issues we have today.

Citation needed. Please explain what issues are present today that weren't then and why accepting refugees does anything to exacerbate these issues.

>Most refugees today come from places that have issues due to European colonialism.

A significant proportion of refugees in recent years have come from middle eastern countries that we have directly and indirectly destabilized through American adventurism in the region. That number has dropped significantly, largely because of Trump's ban on people from these countries. Same is true of central America where our decades long war on drugs and history of supporting coups have destabilized the entire region. 

>It wasn't a problem we created, and we should be wise to completely pull out of it.

Historically, how many of the people we took in from devastated areas were from the results of US actions? Vietnam, sure. But going back further, the Irish potato famine? Poor Europeans from Germany and Italy, Chinese and Japanese in the 19th century? These types of impoverished groups of people had a major role in building this country, yet you would argue that these same types of people today can only burden us? I can't agree, and the numbers don't support your position. What does it matter if it wasn't our fault that these people are in the position they are in now? Shouldn't we try to act as an example to the rest of the world? It seems especially weird to me that the party that represents the bulk of supposed Christians in this country would reject the teaching of Christ to help those in need. He sure as shit didn't say to help your neighbor, but only if they are citizens of the country you're from.

>While refugees here five years or less have a median household income of roughly $22,000, that figure more than triples in the following decades, growing far faster than other foreign-born groups. By the time a refugee
has been in the country at least 25 years, their median household income reaches $67,000—a full $14,000 more than the median income of U.S. households overall.

>The United States was home to more than 180,000 refugee entrepreneurs in 2015. That means that 13 percent of refugees were entrepreneurs in 2015, compared to just 11.5 percent of non-refugee immigrants and 9.0 percent of the U.S.-born population. The businesses of refugees also generated $4.6 billion in business income that year.

>In 18 U.S. states—including Minnesota, Michigan, and Georgia—the likely refugees in our sample hold more than $1 billion in spending power. In California alone, their spending power totals more than $17.2 billion, while
in Texas, the equivalent figure is more than $4.6 billion. 

>More than 84 percent of refugees who have been in the country for 16 to 25 years have taken the step of becoming citizens, compared to roughly half of all immigrants in the country that long. Additionally, 57.4 percent of all likely refugee households own their homes, a figure relatively close to the homeownership rate among U.S. residents overall."
