trashy,fd4fu7u,t1_fd4ex6a,1578167102.0,"No, no. I mean when they were going through ideas in there heads, I want to know why on earth this was chosen and how it came to life. I can imagine a person thinking about being satirical about burgeoning socialism and then decides, let's do a banana, with the a Hitler mustache and let's throw in some nazi imagery."
trashy,fd4bj71,t3_ejydt4,1578166110.0,I want to know the story behind this so bad
self,fd4b8e4,t3_ejxz2f,1578166017.0,"I remember this feeling when I woke up from surgery to deal with my cancer and no one was there. In the hospital for a week and no one visited. You arent alone. Hell, if we were friends I would be sneaking fast food into your room right now, only because I remember how much I wished someone would do that for me. Keep your chin up. It gets better."

toastme,fd4297b,t3_ejyomo,1578163693.0,"Did you do that hair glow effect on purpose or accident? Either way it's amazing. Dont stress about your finals. Easier said then done I know. As anyone who has stressed over nothing will tell you, it's better to be chill when you go in rather rhen second guess yourself. Let us know how you do."
toastme,fd41gdr,t1_fd40xy1,1578163509.0,I appreciate that. My students do that for me too after they found out why I don't smile.
toastme,fd417xo,t3_ejy0zt,1578163472.0,"You are beautiful. You are obviously strong. Definitely intelligent if you know when to leave a bad situation. Though she may be small, she is fierce."

Needafriend,fcvj9rl,t3_ej0ol4,1578003277.0,I have to admit that you being open to other religions is a pretty big thing. It says a lot about you.
PrettyGirlsUglyFaces,fcvj37e,t3_eizsta,1578003165.0,Lmao. That looks like you had some bad gas that just felt great getting out .

TwinCities,fchngef,t1_fchm4no,1577652038.0,My work friends think I am a white presenting misogynistic person who dont even know me well enough to make those assumptions. Every time I try to get outside my comfort zone I always seem to shot down hard.

toastme,fchd96m,t3_eh4lz9,1577649440.0,They had to be trolling you. No way you are a 2. Perhaps your beauty intimidates men? Maybe they think someone so pretty already has a partner?

self,fcgzk2s,t3_eh93a8,1577645680.0,Your story sounds like mine. Both my parents were drug addicts and had people over our house all the time. I cant even recall how many times I was molested by the women they had around. How cute they all thought it was. How I learned that naked people were apparently a common thing. When I got older i began to learn what i was supposed to do. As an adult i struggle with this sometimes. Think about why you want something to be a certain way and focus on that. Focus on what you want as a person.
self,fcgxoa0,t3_eh05zt,1577645043.0,"Congratulations.  That had to be a load off your shoulders. As a cancer survivor I can remember what it felt like. Now you have a new lease on things, do what you want to. Become the person you always wanted to be. You deserve it."
