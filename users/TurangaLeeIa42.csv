AskReddit,ff53zz7,t1_ff4txhg,1579579602.0,"Cool, thank you for explaining that so well. I appreciate it."
AskReddit,ff4k60e,t1_ff4jcth,1579565578.0,"Well, I appreciate your feedback, and it has made me think about how best express what I'm trying to say. I was sharing my own (discouraging) personal experience as a patient, rather than as a colleague. I'm not a colleague. I can in no way do what psychiatrists do, and would never attempt to give advice pertaining to their field. I don't think, however, that most consumers of mental health care initially understand the differences between the disciplines and that's why I said what I did. I wish someone had told me before I went to see a psychiatrist for the first time.

I considered taking the comment down, and I may still. But I wasn't lying to anyone, because that has been my personal experience with multiple psychiatrists. In the end, I think both the medical side and the ""soft science"" side has the same goal: we want people to get better and live full lives. And, in the future, although I can't eschew my lived experience, I will keep that more in mind as I comment."
AskReddit,ff4gu5t,t1_ff4fnwp,1579563280.0,"If you look below, I have apologized to the other poster who was upset on similar grounds. I am sorry I have offended you. I wasn't trying to totally dump on psychiatry, and have in fact benefitted from it a lot. Please forgive me."
AskReddit,ff4cyl9,t1_ff4buva,1579560682.0,"Also. As a patient who has been massively helped by meds -- thank you for all your hard work. I know your job isn't easy and it has taken you years to get here. You are doing something important, and it is, at least from me, massively appreciated."
AskReddit,ff4cp9p,t1_ff4buva,1579560515.0,"I would love to see more psychiatrists who are trained in both disciplines. I would assume, at least in the US, big reasons they are not include (a) the expense of more school on top of all the school they've already gone through/lost income from seeing patients during that time and (b) all the extra time spent. I don't blame anybody who wouldn't want to do both. Just becoming a psychiatrist is an enormous job."
AskReddit,ff45sso,t1_ff443il,1579556172.0,That is awesome! What a wise and caring psychiatrist you have!
AskReddit,ff3yfkl,t1_ff31x6a,1579551583.0,"You know, I'll admit to some ego being in my response. You're right. Thanks for the humility check. I am proud of what I am learning to do. From your response, I get the sense that I don't understand exactly what is at stake for you in this conversation. My intent is not to offend or strong-arm others into agreeing with me, and I didn't state my student status for that purpose. I just wanted to be transparent about the fact that I'm still learning. 

I as a patient have received excellent medication and terrible conversation from several psychiatrists. I don't begrudge them that, necessarily, because talk therapy was not their field of expertise. I just wish they had ""stayed in their lane,"" because their words were very difficult for me to bear as an already-distressed person. I don't think enough potential patients and clients who would benefit from both medication AND talk therapy understand that psychiatrists and, say, psychologists have different specialties. That was my original point in commenting. 

I hope you have a good rest of your day."
AskReddit,ff314om,t1_ff31272,1579530890.0,"Thank you. I am in my last semester of becoming an MFT, so I feel pretty confident using that term. But details can certainly clarify communication."
AskReddit,ff309hf,t1_ff307ad,1579530183.0,"Absolutely. I sure needed both. But I quickly learned my therapist was the one I could open up to, and that was okay."
AskReddit,ff2zksp,t1_ff2ymfc,1579529609.0,"Oof. Remember though, psychiatrists are not therapists. They deal with psychopharmacology, not therapy. In my experience, even the good ones are not always good at listening to people. It's just not always their field of expertise.

*Edit: I have, unwittingly, stepped on toes with this. Although I have never had the good fortune of encountering, in all my years as a patient, a psychiatrist who was also trained in psychotherapy, of course that doesn't mean they don't exist. If we were in a perfect world, I'd hope ALL of them were. But, many aren't, and sometimes patients learn this the hard way. Without psychiatric meds and trained therapists, I wouldn't be here today. Both are important, and I am grateful to them. Please forgive an internet stranger for offending you."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,feycfrl,t3_eqnfyp,1579443715.0,"Man I sure used to. In the last year though I've begun to realize that (a) most people don't notice me or care what I do and (b) even if I do something noticeable, they won't remember it unless I draw attention to it. So far it is working great!"

FunnyandSad,fefu5ji,t3_eol16e,1579065293.0,"School counselors have lots of books like this, about all kinds of difficult subjects. Kids go through a lot, and knowing what to expect can help them put adult-sized worries down for a little while longer."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fed6x75,t1_fecxslm,1579001768.0,"OP, this comment is spot on. Others have dumped a lot on your shoulders and it is dragging you too far down. You don't deserve to carry it. Please talk to a professional. You deserve to be happy in yourself."

2meirl4meirl,fe3347i,t1_fe32ssz,1578845468.0,"I don't know that those two things are always mutually exclusive. I do understand it can feel really unfair if someone who appears attractive complains about not feeling like it. And some people are manipulative, sure. But being kind to people who say they are sad is always a better option than telling them to suck it up. That's all."
2meirl4meirl,fe30mld,t1_fe2tzw1,1578844779.0,"Everybody has bad angles, no matter how attractive, and  - more to the point - being attractive to others doesn't mean you are happy with yourself. She had control over taking a selfie that shows her in a way she likes. When others take a photo of you, they may not take a good one, and don't always ask before sharing it."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdqbhun,t3_emlgof,1578662084.0,"Remember OP, even though many people experience what you are describing (and many of these comments are full of wonderful ideas), if this anxiety continues to be so strong that it controls your life, you might consider also talking to a professional about it. You could even look to the internet to find strategies to minimize the anxiousness itself, as you continue to deal with its subject matter (right now, expectations & life timeline). I am sorry you are suffering. I am hopeful, though, that you will get through this and come to happier times as a result. Best to you!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdqb7qh,t1_fdq9pm2,1578661835.0,"This is such a good perspective, and you are right on. Culture has a HUGE impact on the pressures we perceive and to which we're subjected. Kids are great, but they are also all-encompassing (necessarily) for a good while. I want them eventually, but seeing the everyday lives of my friends who have them now makes me relish these years with just me + SO."
