raisedbynarcissists,ff4389y,t1_ff42tng,1579554567.0,"Oh! Sorry, I misunderstood. I think that’s a really good idea. It’s hard to keep everything straight and not only that but thinking about her and what she does makes me feel like I’m going crazy because nothing makes any logical sense."
raisedbynarcissists,ff42pn1,t1_ff2y9b3,1579554248.0,"Ah yes, the classic “I hate you but hey everyone look how great my child is!” My mom does that one too. When I had a more impressive sounding job, you would have thought I walked on water. I changed industries and I’m scum again. 

Unfortunately, at least in my opinion, there’s no solution other to move out if you’re able to. And if you’re not, make a plan so you can soon. She’ll always be the sick, twisted person she is but you will have so much more peace in your life. And you deserve that."
raisedbynarcissists,ff41c9i,t1_ff2gwdf,1579553399.0,"I tried that about 7 years ago. I called her out for who and what she is. She has since erased it from memory and we pretend like it never happened. That’s what she does when any sort of conflict, loss, or problem arises- it didn’t happen. For example, her father died when she was 4 years old. For YEARS I was never told of him, I believed my step-grandfather was my grandpa. When I found out about my biological grandpa, I was told he died in a construction accident. Even that wasn’t true. He died on a camping trip with his family. There’s no hope for her."
raisedbynarcissists,ff40mf4,t1_ff2oixv,1579552952.0,"It’s funny because most of my life, until a few years ago, I thought I was the bad person. Thank you for saying this."
toastme,ff2fjf6,t3_er00f2,1579503992.0,I’m sorry but I’ve been playing a lot of Witcher 3 lately and you literally have a Geralt scar and that is SO bad ass! And 30 days is huge! One day at a time my friend. I’m very happy for you. Keep this up and more good things will follow. Cheers!
raisedbynarcissists,ff2f7t4,t1_ff2e3sb,1579503624.0,"I don’t know why I even care honestly. I’ve gotten to the point where I usually don’t but like I said in my post losing my cat has me really messed up. That cat showed me more love and kindness than my mother ever did. It’s like I’m concerned about hurting someone’s feelings who is literally incapable of having empathy. And I know that’s absurd. 

You’re right though. Ever since she moved, it’s like the childish mentality where if she can’t see me I’m not “really” there. It’s bizarre but I’m thankful for the space that has allowed me to go VERY low contact. If it weren’t for my sister, I’d have told her to get lost a long time ago. 

She knows I’m down right now which is why she is pestering me. Like an alligator trying to pick off the slowest deer in the flock. That is my mother. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. It means a lot to me that someone can validate my feelings and that it’s not all in my head as my mother would try to make you believe lol"

Petloss,fdpspi6,t3_emmfla,1578638990.0,"I’m very sorry for your loss. I just lost my cat Syl on Tuesday due to an out of left field blood clot in his brain. I do feel guilty- Ashamed and angry with myself that I didn’t know something was wrong. I left for work that morning in a hurry and thought to myself, “oh, I’ll give him his special food treat when I get home.” When I got home, he was on the floor dying. I never got to give him his treat. That really stings."

As cliche as it sounds, it’s honestly their loss. But now you can heal and focus on yourself. I’m sorry that this happened to you but there are better things to come. Give yourself time to grieve, it’s normal to have a lot of emotions after any kind of heartbreak. I truly hope you feel better soon."

Petloss,fdogxzj,t3_emckx2,1578604930.0,"First, I am deeply sorry for your loss.

Just this Tuesday I lost my cat to a blood clot in his brain. It is the most horrible pain I've ever known.

The kind of person who does this has never known and will never know genuine love, like you and I have for our cats, because they themselves are unlovable. Ignore this miserable human being and the poison they spread. They have to live the rest of their life being them. They're already getting theirs in that alone.

Take comfort in knowing that you are far from alone and that your beloved cat is with you, always. 

May we both one day find peace <3"

depression,fdm9675,t3_elqwy9,1578542925.0,"Mine comes and goes in bouts, varying in intensity. I think it’s always there for me, it just depends how strong it is at that given moment. Sometimes there’s no reason. Right now my depression is in full force due to my beloved cat suddenly and unexpectedly passing away Tuesday. My depression was at bay for quite awhile and I almost forgot how dark the world could be. 

I think the cause, at least for me, was being abused around age 5. Add my genetic predisposition to depression and being raised by a toxic, narcissistic mother and I was doomed to have depression."

He was truly everything to me, we had this bond I can’t explain. Like a piece of me went with him and I’m honestly not sure how I’m going to get through life without him. He was fine when I left for work and  without getting into the terrible specifics, when I got home he was in critical condition. The ER couldn’t help him. Just like that. That’s what hurts the most right now. He wasn’t old, wasn’t sick and I was, and am, completely blindsided and unprepared for this emotionally and all I want is to go pet him or pick him up or meow at him and he’ll meow back (he was VERY chatty) and it’s like I keep forgetting he’s not here anymore. It’s agony."
confession,fdjjive,t3_el3rvh,1578473746.0,"I would quit while you’re ahead. I just had a really fucked up day where my world shattered and it was to no fault of my own. Life happens.. things can and will go wrong whether it’s your own doing or not. You say this is the best thing that’s happened to you, why not try to do everything you can to preserve it then? Stealing is a compulsive habit. And just like any habit can be learned, it can be unlearned. It will be difficult to adjust to, but I believe you can stop. There’s enough pain life brings throughout a person’s short time on this planet- so why not spare yourself some heartache and prevent the pain you can?"
