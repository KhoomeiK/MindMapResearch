They have 2499 patreons that's 8000 every month if everyone was on the lowest tier, they dont need donations when they have a monthly wage over some hours of work. Op should donate to people who actually need it"
dankmemer,fehi3d1,t1_fehhftm,1579116989.0,"Again, ""stfu nobody asked"", they have jobs on the side, they have put ""hours"" into this and probably (*PROBABLY*) made at least 10k.... for a few hours of work, even if they worked for something like 5 days total, 10k (which is probably not even close compared to the users they have) is a good payout. They've gotten their donations (obviously), which could probably be ok with just 1 option, £1 donations and you get all the perks that the highest would get (idfk), and isnt patreon a monthly thing? They'd be getting easily 10k a month.... for a few hours of work."
dankmemer,fehh6n9,t1_fehgqfh,1579116454.0,"Really? ""Stfu nobody asked"" about how hard they worked on the bot, £45 could go to something useful rather than a few perks on a bot where you steal fake money, gamble fake money, looks at memes from reddit (you can literally just go on reddit yourself) and yeah that's about all the usefulness. In not some sort of expert but it wouldn't be THAT hard to have simple commands pull an image from somewhere or show you how much fake money you have."
