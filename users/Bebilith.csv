AskReddit,fewhbil,t1_fesbjjj,1579410579.0,"Mostly we want to know if you are from the U.S because we don’t want to offend the Canadians and we can’t really tell the difference in the accent. Most of us don’t know where Tennessee is and really don’t care if you are from there or Carolina. 

Does it matter to you if I’m from the ATC or New South Wales? Can you point to those places on a map?"
aww,fewdm01,t1_ferp9f0,1579408826.0,"Hmm. Still wild with impressive claws. If they are not starving, dehydrated or in shock, they can be a bit cranky about being handled."

Now after 7 weeks, switching from the trial machine to a purchased one and a few ups and downs I’m gradually adapting again to it."

Citrix,febonkn,t1_febh6zy,1578961050.0,Yes. “Should be” being the key phrase here. :)
Citrix,feb0xsg,t1_feaxlnm,1578954343.0,"Because switching from XenApp 6.5 to 7.15 is a big change likely being done at the same time as the move from Server 2008R2 to 2016. 

If you are not ready for that but hosting needs to move to VMware 6.7 and you are not using any incompatible Citrix components, it’s easier to decouple the upgrades. 

All said in the context of today being THE DAY that has been written on our whiteboards for the last year or more."
aww,feayctv,t1_fe8e6q3,1578953500.0,"Which Koalas do all the time!

Reminds me of a politician photo op I accidentally attended in the 80s at a wildlife place. A keeper handed a koala to the politician. The koala immediately scratched the shit out of and pee'd all over him. 

We should arrange for Koalas to be handed to our politicians at every photo op they go to."
Citrix,feavr67,t1_fe95rzv,1578952669.0,"There is another kb which is amore complete comparability matrix of the various components. Sorry I don't have the time now to track it down. 

More than a year ago it said only the PVS 7.6 component wasn't compatible with vsphere 6.7. The other components were fine.

6.5 patched above R03 is compatible with vsphere 6.5 from memory. Again, checks the more complete compatability kB."
AskReddit,fe5ubbs,t3_enpz15,1578875111.0,"Babysitter dropped me from her shoulders when I was less than a year old. She didn’t tell my parents. 

Took my mum a couple of days to figure out something was wrong cause I screamed each time I was picked up and take me to the doctors."
AskReddit,fdv73e9,t1_fduvhgw,1578744029.0,"Yes. Thus the need to replicate into a fresh body. Just like viruses that infect living hosts. Gota spread into another host before this one carks it. 

The zombie virus or parasite just takes it one step further and makes fresh dead bodies to infect."

AskReddit,fd0gzjv,t1_fczdfs0,1578118651.0,"I disagree, there is a good reason for not doing that. 

Had someone slam into the back/side of me when I stepped off a kerb to cross, they were running at an angle coming up behind me and failed to account for the fact I might step forward into their path when there was a break in traffic. 

Was sore for days and could easily have fallen and got a head injury."

PublicFreakout,fbxbe2e,t3_eep3hv,1577178359.0,"LPT with small dogs like this, flip it on its back,  clamp your hand around its throat and squeeze. It dog will give up and relax, also release whatever it’s bitting. Or if it’s really stubborn, it will fall unconscious. 

Use your other hand to keep its front claws out of your face. You will get a bit scratched, but nothing serious."
Futurology,fbnh413,t1_fbm26rj,1576997708.0,"I have a box full of token ring adapters by multiple manufacturers salvaged from multiple previous places of work would be evidence it was fairly widespread. 

In the end Ethernet was just more practical. Having a floor brought down because someone unplugged their kit or a loop connector to move desk was a nightmare to support."
