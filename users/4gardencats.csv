Also, starting with your stick's tip against the cue ball before pushing it teaches you exactly how close to the cue ball you can get without touching it. Neither of course is allowed in a game, but they have benefits as an exercise."

Problem was, all the meowing and wailing that two of them did caused the very sensitive 3rd one to get so upset he vomited before we got there. Took him alone after that and he did fine."

Love the blanket!"
