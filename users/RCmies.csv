depression,ffc3uoz,t3_eslvlt,1579790878.0,"What's gonna get harder? It starts with small steps, to get better. It can be as little as taking a piece of litter to the garbage bin from your desk. Next time you can maybe clean the whole desk. Now you have a clean desk. The desk will probably get messy again, unless you keep taking those small steps and putting things where they belong. Maybe you can sometimes try putting your depressive thoughts where they belong. Good luck to you."

flightsim,ffc2t1o,t1_ffbtvuj,1579790127.0,I think the reason I didn't get accepted is because I only have 8GB DDR3. I have an i5-4690K and GTX 970 so it should be fine.

Kysyvät ensin mikä yhtiö on nykyisin jne. Väittävät että niiden hinnat on halvempia ja ne tukee tuulivoimaa jne. Sitten syyllistävät että miksi et halua vaihtaa ympäristöystävällisempään sähköön jos sanot että ei.

Still I have no purpose, it all just feels pointless. Yeah. Just feel out of place every fucking where. I'm on medication right now. It helps a bit, but I'm not sure how I would feel without it. Like it's just a filter for my brain to not worry about the negative stuff. I'm always out of place, I always feel different than others. Even if theyre feeling the same thing. I've just disconnected from this world long ago. I'm trying my best to be a good person but sometimes this sense of loneliness and emptiness just makes me want to disappear."

No, you have to also think about what others might think is good and it has changed my whole view on listening to music. Now when I hear a song, instead of going ""this is alright but not really the perfect song I would listen to on my free time"" I go ""I think people would really enjoy this during a set"" and I'll add it to my collection."

It's important that you try."

If I enjoyed the sunsets in FSX and being able to fly from the airport in my home country, I'm going to enjoy it so much more to actually see all the details in the land. Finland won't be boring anymore, instead of a bunch of dead trees it will look interesting no matter what even though there aren't many buildings.

It's just when the other person isn't interested you automatically become clingy and most of the time the other person isn't interested.

Olin silloin muutenkin masentunut, pakotettu inttiin ja halusin kai vaan että kuolisin.

My dad was never drunk by the way but that shit gave me mad anxiety... I hope you can find peace in your home. Definitely go to that doctor's appointment, it will help you a lot to have someone from an outside view look at your situation anyways.

depression,fd9hnfs,t1_fd7jps4,1578233522.0,If you're really fucked up by mental illness it can make you do things you never would in a clear state of mind. Or you're directing your negative feelings toward others. Most depressed people turn them towards themselves however.

Like what's the point anymore, I had my chances of spending my best years and they just slipped away and now I gotta work the rest of my life. That's not how it goes thankfully.

depression,fd31xmx,t3_ejvcf6,1578153955.0,"I used to worry about that shit all the time. Same thing for me, never talked to girls, never partied etc. But I made the personal decision to not drink alcohol because I didn't want to turn like my mother. And I think it was a good one. I have also gone to some parties later only to realize it's literally just about getting drunk and it's honestly quite fucking sad. Then when people are sober they can't even talk to each other lmao. Maybe I missed out on something, who cares. I can do that shit later too if I really want but I don't think I do. Who's to say that's how you're supposed to spend your teenage years? Why let some social standards define your life? I'm not gonna party for 10 years and then work the rest of my life at a shitty job just to feed the kids I made by fucking the wrong woman."

depression,fd23qw7,t3_ejsoej,1578141217.0,"It's hard to help depressed people. If you say the wrong thing they'll lash out at you. They usually feel they don't deserve help or care. I think no one cares is more as a ""I don't have friends who would check in on me"". But once a suicide happens of course everyone talks about it. But in reality most people don't care other than for the fact that people dying is bad and they get to say their ""I always thought he was nice (even though I bullied him lol)"" on social media. You know the people who care. If someone reaches out to you more often than anyone else it means they care about you. Besides does it really matter if no one cares... At least to me it doesn't. If no one cares about me then it doesn't really matter because I care about me and so far that's all I need."

depression,fc55dfr,t1_fc4s5ey,1577444025.0,Sometimes I wonder if people like us are supposed to be leaders but because of anxiety don't even consider that - but in social interaction other people expect us to lead the situation. Just a thought. I think I would be a good leader as in I would make good choices but I'm just too anxious and not enough confident for that.
depression,fc559zw,t3_eg6zyt,1577443880.0,"Thank you for writing this. I feel exactly the same. And it happens even when I'm not depressed or anxious which puts me in that loop again. 

Personally I've just given up my social life. I've quit social media, I don't hang out with friends. Only friends I care about are people across the seas on some discord server. I've just learned to focus on other things besides friends. I've been focusing on exercising, learning to cook, doing my school work well and just enjoying my time alone, even though sometimes it feels very lonely. Funny enough now that I look good, people seem to be a lot kinder to me, although that stops quickly when they realize I'm kind of anxious and not as confident as I look. 

Anyways, when you're alone enough you adapt. Humans are made to adapt. It's sort of sad but really it isn't. I'm enjoying my time. Only thing I'm really missing is human touch and a deeper connection with someone. But I wouldn't have that even if I tried to socialize. Hanging out with people who don't make you feel at home just makes you feel even lonelier."

Eivät naiset ole niin tyhmiä, että he eivät osaisi tappaa itseään. Itsemurhayritykset ovat usein avunhuuto. Tottakai ihminen pitää ottaa tosissaan jos se yrittää itsemurhaa. Ehkä olisi pitänyt huomion hakemisen sijaan käyttää tuota avunhuuto ilmaisua. Pointtini oli kuitenkin se että jos ihan oikeasti haluaa tappaa itsensä niin kyllä se onnistuu ihan yhtä lailla naiselta kuin mieheltä. Ja jos haluaa vain yrittää itsemurhaa niin se onnistuu myös mieheltä. Se vaan on niin että miehet tappavat itseään enemmän."
