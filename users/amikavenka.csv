konmari,fdlsd7k,t1_fdeqny5,1578531353.0,"I separate by blouses/shirts, pants/jeans, and cardigans/jackets, dresses and skirts. I keep dresses and skirts separate. If there is a pattern I go with the predominant color. If I can't figure that out I just put the pattern at the end of the color. Black jeans are with black pants. Blue jeans light to dark. I try to keep like sleeve length together, but I am not always successful with that."

simpleliving,fcjv3j4,t3_ef5l8i,1577706201.0,I have no background in Comp Sci only work experience in the field the software is used that I train. Am I techie? Yes. I used a different software when working full time. I taught myself the software I train. I know it well enough to train first time users needing a broad overview. There is so much online training being done now. You can train or teach online for many companies. I was asked at a wedding to last week to pass on a have to my boss. She has a background in online curriculum development. No background in my field though. I think with a background in Spec Ed there should be some company selling software for IEPs or something related to Ed in general.

I am thinking about getting it removed but it has not changed since healing other then stretching as my breasts sag with age. I thought it would heal as other slots had when I did it.

simpleliving,fc2gelj,t3_ef5l8i,1577358766.0,Have you ever right about becoming on online trainer? I work part-time as a online trainer for a software company. As an educator with Spec Ed experience there should be opportunities out there. It is the best job I have ever had.
Frugal,fbfg9rx,t3_ed294l,1576809859.0,"Have you separated from the company you worked with when you put money into the 401K not then my experience had been you can't touch it except to take a loan from it. If you taking a loan from it then you have to pay, which you might be able to due because of your medical bills. If you can take a withdrawal then you will have to pay income tax on the amount. Be sure to have them take out at least 25% to cover the taxes. I took out 6K for hospital bills from one once. It still bugs me 16 years later."
