AskReddit,ff9o99j,t1_ff8ir72,1579717147.0,You wanna share it or just leave us all in suspense?
AskReddit,ff8e0rn,t1_ff8dy2l,1579674541.0,I understood the first half of that lol. I'll assume it's impressive.
AskReddit,ff8dxug,t1_ff8ckhz,1579674452.0,Is it on YouTube?
AskReddit,ff8dx97,t1_ff8clit,1579674435.0,Those both honestly sound exhausting.
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff7456m,t3_ernq8x,1579640747.0,Star wars the old republic has fully voiced dialogue and meaningful rpg mechanics. It's my favorite mmo.
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff741nb,t3_erp1n5,1579640692.0,"Let me know if you find this game, I don't think it exists."
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff740jn,t1_ff6hr68,1579640675.0,Shooting is pretty meh in that though.
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff73ten,t3_ersqti,1579640563.0,"Rouge legacy is a single player retro game that you can make huge strides in by playing an hour or two. 

The Spyro and crash bandicoot remasters are perfect for short play sessions as well. 

For multiplayer just pick your favorite shooter. Matches are like 10 minutes tops."
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff73kc4,t3_ertbg5,1579640419.0,"You want the sims. You literally build a family, then a house. Next you can do it all over or live out that families life."
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff73gii,t3_erua6x,1579640359.0,"Well that's a super wide range of games so I'll just throw out my personal favorites. 


The surge is similar to sairento but with a sci-fi world and lots of equipment upgradeability

The Witcher 3 is probably the best RPG of the last decade. Multiple interesting character builds, well developed NPCs and quests, and meaningful reasons for crafting and exploration. 

Boarderlands is a goofy whacky shooter with crazy character and gun options. 

Ark is a dinosaur survival game that's pretty hard but pretty cool too. Once you get going it becomes a lot of fun. 

Smite is a mutuplayer arena game where you play as mythical beings. I have hundreds of hours in this game."
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff72mhh,t3_erur8f,1579639880.0,Nintendo has always been about the games. Is it worth it to you for the Nintendo games? Cause there won't be much else available.
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff72cbo,t3_ervi44,1579639719.0,I haven't played GTA but I didn't finish rdr2. I loved the first game but the second game sorta loses itself in the pursuit of more. There's a ton to do in rdr2 and it could easily last 100 hours but by hour 25 or so I just lost interest in it all. There's no good reason to do any of the tedious crap the game wants you to.
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff71y0p,t3_erw9sq,1579639502.0,Wipeout Omega collection is a blast if it's available on your system.
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff71u6m,t1_ff6kalv,1579639445.0,"I was gonna suggest this, not great for grinding but a great retro game with delightful humor."
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff71qtl,t3_erwt3o,1579639394.0,Terra was the only thing that came to mind. Definitely look at Japanese games.
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff71m0v,t3_erx6rr,1579639321.0,"This is the exact reason I prefer smite over lol. Gameplay is certainly a lot less management and minion sniping but we could argue all day over balance. I feel like it's decently balanced for the most part. 

I will warn smite is pretty aggressive in the sales department."
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff71bsr,t3_erxnvr,1579639156.0,"Dc universe comes to mind first,

AskReddit,fdrmfr0,t1_fdp30l8,1578686582.0,No my job doesn't pay for my healthcare but that doesn't mean I believe the government should. Healthcare is not a right.
AskReddit,fdrlnnv,t1_fdp3t5o,1578686341.0,I am a moderate to be sure. I lean to the right but would rather have a moderate Democrat over a extreme conservative.
AskReddit,fdrjq6f,t1_fdpby9u,1578685501.0,He's more moderate. The rest all come across as crazy to me.
AskReddit,fdrjlgi,t1_fdpcike,1578685429.0,He's the only moderate in the race at all so yea.
AskReddit,fdrji7b,t1_fdpcyf9,1578685378.0,"The way a person presents themselves matters alot. I'd much rather have a dignified well spoken leader, but Trump will have to do."
AskReddit,fdrijyp,t1_fdpfq84,1578685070.0,"It's too deeply ingrained in us that your money belongs to you. The right to private property is one of the foundations of our nation and that protects the 1% just as much as me. No matter how noble the cause is, stealing from the rich to give to the poor is still wrong."
AskReddit,fdri85o,t1_fdph6mk,1578684888.0,"Not familiar with the pizza shops actually, I'll admit it's a far cry from proven that Clinton is a murderer, but between Benghazi, Epstein, and a whole lot of people around the clintons commiting suicide, it just gets real suspicious."
AskReddit,fdrhm2n,t1_fdpjmhc,1578684582.0,Mostly just that he's more moderate. Biden is one of the few people who doesn't have extreme policies.
AskReddit,fdrh0od,t1_fdpli6e,1578684451.0,It's easy to argue against voting for someone but you also need a better alternative.

AskReddit,fdrgm2b,t1_fdprpeb,1578684208.0,Don't have a real strong opinion there but I imagine if I bothered to read about it in depth I wouldn't be too bothered or impressed.
AskReddit,fdrfynb,t1_fdpuom1,1578684012.0,I'm skeptical of it but don't disregard it. I'm a cornucopian which is pretty much the belief that mankind will overcome any problem as it arises. So climate change is like a 5 or 6 in my mind.

AskReddit,fdox5fd,t3_emhkiu,1578614897.0,"I voted third party last election because Clinton is a murderer and Trump is just distasteful. This election I'll be voting Trump because whatever my problems with him personally may be, his policies are ok. Only other person I might vote for would be Biden.

Edit: all you liberals can stop replying, I promise someone else already said what your about too. Just downvote me and move on."
