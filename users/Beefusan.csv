Arcade1Up,ff94jn0,t1_ff90yc5,1579704671.0,There is no guarantee they will sell the bench separate.

IdiotsInCars,ff5z4vi,t1_ff4ewes,1579614869.0,Attention grabbing.
nfl,ff1p9qa,t1_ff1onyk,1579483140.0,Giants/Jets play in New Jersey. The Buccaneers don't play in the Bay. They play in the city of Tampa. Then add Cowboys and Bills but i don't remember where they play. Not in Dallas and not in Buffalo.
nfl,ff1oam1,t1_feznri5,1579482539.0,5k yards and 30 tds. I say the oline did their part. The 30 ints are on Winston.
nfl,ff1knug,t1_ff1kj6c,1579480726.0,Into his center's legs? That would be dumb.
nfl,ff1jwn4,t1_ff1jmdy,1579480367.0,Carbonated water with alcohol in it. And some sugar flavoring.
todayilearned,feyd6k7,t1_feuh4pf,1579444011.0,Then it's back to prison for the crime of not having enough money.
nfl,feycfaz,t3_eqhgee,1579443710.0,Well. He should score more points then.
todayilearned,fenhytv,t3_eq1wyq,1579285088.0,I am not familiar with skate parks. Are they not required to have exits for emergency reasons?
Arcade1Up,fegbgi9,t1_feeid1v,1579086261.0,There isn't one. They have only said expect about 10 games.
CFB,febzu53,t3_eocu5w,1578964706.0,A well done and very thorough coin flip.
AskReddit,fdp8kn3,t3_emgnqh,1578622529.0,Chalkboard on nails.
Arcade1Up,fdlto3n,t1_fdlkusx,1578532236.0,"Well, it is Vegas."
Arcade1Up,fdk4hoq,t3_elrkzk,1578495843.0,They already said Wifi is to push updates and fixes if needed.
Arcade1Up,fdjo6t0,t1_fdhvxns,1578480476.0,Toyshock is expanding their products and making improvements to sound and responsiveness. But no release date on those features. I still like the arcade1up better. Thin bezel and better titles.
Arcade1Up,fdikuln,t1_fdh8w3y,1578445150.0,"With a light up marquee and custom riser, it may be more."
Arcade1Up,fdikqly,t3_eldvb1,1578445080.0,I don't need this. I didn't want this. I have no room for this. But it looks so great. Love the artwork. Screw my 60 in 1 mod. I may buy this one anyways.
Arcade1Up,fdigbir,t3_elduzp,1578442259.0,I didn't know I wanted this. Day 1 preorder once they make it happen.
Arcade1Up,fdgy661,t3_elc0o0,1578411208.0,The picture that came out a day or two ago was not from CES. It does appear to show some machines that will be announced at CES.
Arcade1Up,fdgx8a8,t1_fdgw3f0,1578410562.0,Looks a few inches taller. Shape is different too. Probably because the screen is angled differently.
Arcade1Up,fdgwh5y,t1_fdguh25,1578410039.0,That universal machine we saw leaked appears to only be a box.
Arcade1Up,fdeif3c,t3_ekyw4h,1578339695.0,Would make more sense to include Lee Carvallo's Putting Challenge with Simpsons.
Arcade1Up,fde107f,t1_fddvsc6,1578328738.0,That was a goof. And I think them accidentally releasing it hurt them getting the license.
Games,fddyq4j,t3_ekpv58,1578327209.0,So the other guy is still playing huh?
Arcade1Up,fddi696,t1_fdcdd2v,1578313283.0,It was probably the easiest one to do first. If they get it right then there will be more light gun games.
Arcade1Up,fdcjj0d,t1_fdcct0z,1578276462.0,Sunset riders is a 4 player Konami title.
Arcade1Up,fdcj8vi,t1_fdc8add,1578276261.0,"Well, they changed the art of what is now the Burger Time cab after feedback. So it could be possible they do it again."
Arcade1Up,fdcj028,t3_ekkpvq,1578276089.0,"So the other pinball is the Universal pinball collection (ET, Back to the Future, Jaws)? Going to be a tough decision for me."
nfl,fdcb9j4,t1_fdcb30s,1578270827.0,They would still be losing and Seattle would have the ball.
nfl,fdauujf,t1_fdau9rj,1578250484.0,Different people.
nfl,fdas69c,t1_fdaroz2,1578249414.0,"Down, down, up"
nfl,fdane65,t1_fdamsak,1578247964.0,That's what really needs to be reviewed. There are two guys that touched the ball and both were close to stepping out of bounds prior to touching it.
nfl,fd63428,t1_fd62z82,1578184885.0,It starts again on the whistle.
BoneAppleTea,fd2rozq,t3_ejrd3s,1578150986.0,Don't be super sizing with the enemy guys.
Arcade1Up,fczf0me,t1_fcyle0n,1578099778.0,Oh. Then I have no complaints. Can't wait them to officially announce so I can order.
Arcade1Up,fcxr0e8,t1_fcxqaw6,1578069301.0,"Thanks! 24 inch playfield seems a tad small. But I suppose that helps keep the cost down. Other than that it has everything else I'm looking for. Wifi for new tables, feedback, tilt."
Arcade1Up,fcxnukl,t1_fcxnisx,1578067367.0,That sounds too cheap to me. Virtual pinball needs pretty beefy computer specs to get the ball physics and animations right. If it's high quality and less than 1k I'm buying it.
nfl,fcspt29,t3_eiouck,1577922049.0,Next year let's go for 6k 40/40!
Arcade1Up,fcskunf,t3_ei7x2t,1577918635.0,I'm most excited about the digital pinball machine they have hinted at.
AskReddit,fcmxp09,t3_ei1iub,1577796801.0,Just too much of an Old Zealander I suppose.
teslamotors,fcmxcew,t1_fcmw02j,1577796419.0,I don't think Donald Duck really said that. Source?
IdiotsInCars,fcluv4g,t1_fckvq66,1577757029.0,Temporary tags are only good for about 60 days. Not 6 months.
Arcade1Up,fckqtz7,t1_fchyqyx,1577731206.0,How bad are we talking? I wanted to do this same mod to my space invaders.
todayilearned,fcknvam,t1_fckhqeu,1577729385.0,None of these kids pay attention in school man.
nfl,fckmukr,t1_fchui1q,1577728753.0,First throw of his Tampa Bay career was a pick 6.
buccaneers,fchu856,t3_eh81mp,1577654193.0,Buc'd it up right there.
buccaneers,fchtgzc,t3_eh81mp,1577653934.0,Time for a coin flip to determine who wins.
buccaneers,fchrnbf,t3_eh81mp,1577653387.0,Defense was too busy dancing over the sack to get ready for the 4th down play.
buccaneers,fchniww,t1_fchmwl8,1577652064.0,The play you call on 3rd and 20 when you have a lead and are prone to making mistakes.
buccaneers,fchlxwk,t3_eh81mp,1577651659.0,Gholston with great back to back plays.
buccaneers,fchftsp,t1_fchfoad,1577650081.0,I saw the same thing.
buccaneers,fch3kp8,t3_eh81mp,1577646918.0,"Wow. They actually let that one play out. No whistle? What happened, did the refs falls asleep and let us make a play?"
buccaneers,fch2xcv,t1_fch2jdi,1577646801.0,Receiver ran out. Jameis was expecting him to go in. Watson I think.
buccaneers,fcgt5oh,t1_fcgss43,1577643768.0,Offensive tackles don't have to report eligible for the Falcons and Rojo fumbled.
buccaneers,fcgqv57,t1_fcgqkw5,1577643072.0,Because the refs hate us.
PSVR,fc1j8g0,t1_fc0fbiy,1577320389.0,I've played the game for over 100 hours and never knew #1.
movies,fbul5ux,t3_eedrah,1577116260.0,Just shows what works in a musical doesn't work in cinema. Now who is ready for the movie adaptation of Starlight Express?
