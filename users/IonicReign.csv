fatlogic,ff320mi,t1_ff30mf8,1579531598.0,"I also think it's important to flag the difference between:

Psychologically addictive (sugar, marijuana, shopping, etc - All of which flood your system with reward chemicals from your brain) 

And

Physiologically addictive (heroin, cigarettes, alcohol) which results in dangerous withdrawal symptoms and can result in things like seizure, heart attack, and hallucination when the drug of dependence is removed from the system. 


Stopping one results in unhappiness, anhedonism and a desire to repeatedly re-engage in the risky or negative behaviours (e.g. overeating sugar while obese, shopping despite being broke)

Quitting the other can be life-threatening if not done properly.

Edit to Add: both are addictions. The addiction is formed by the feel good chemicals flooding your brain to the point of ignoring the negatives, which includes overconsumption of the addictive substance. 

Humans don't care if theyll get withdrawals it not. That comes after."

And now that AP is the SO... well she knows how easy it was for him to make the switch once. She can just as easily be yesterday's treasure in tomorrow's trash.

I think you've gotten this one wrong, as plenty of non-monogamous couples engage in DADT (Don't ask dont tell) 

IMO the definition of cheating is betraying the prescribed boundaries and rules established in the relationship. 

E.g. a polygamous couple can engage in cheating if the agreement is condom-only sex with other partners, and one partner unilaterally decides to not use protection."

It sounds like you're attempting to do positive reinforcement training similar to when dogs bark at other dogs.  When thats done, the treat is meant to be given BEFORE the barking starts but AFTER the trigger. That way dog learns that trigger = treat = look at human expectantly rather than bark.
