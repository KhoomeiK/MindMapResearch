Almost everyone I know does. So maybe it’s a sampling issue? I’m honestly not sure what % of the population works 9-5 (or 8-5) but I’ve always assumed it’s significantly more than half.

MapPorn,fel5al0,t1_fekqtxl,1579214365.0,"> ""Analog GPS"" is not remotely funny. It's just literally what this is- an analog way to find your position on a globe.

Exactly. Analog GPS describes what it is but is not actual name. Like “danger noodle” and “forbidden fruit” both at least (loosely) describe the thing. Snakes are dangerous and tide pods shouldn’t be eaten - perfectly described by their adjectives.

Acoustic doesn’t even describe it. Nothing about this is acoustic.

If “acoustic GPS” is supposed to be funny, what does the “acoustic” part even mean? Why is it supposed to funny? Like, I’m missing something. 

Edit: actually, I didn’t even suggest it was a joke. I think the original commenter was literally describing what it is “analog GPS.” You were the person suggesting it was a joke so I guess you should explain what’s funny about “acoustic GPS.” 

Analog makes sense to me because an analog GPS is a bizarre concept but is exactly what this image is. Also, “analog” is sometimes a synonym for “old” which is literally the title.

Edit2: actually a typo or autocorrect makes much more sense than some weird convoluted joke you’re trying to create.

It’s easy to say “hey I’m friendly” when the radar detects you as a passenger aircraft. Not so easy to say “hey I’m friendly” when radar detects was you as a fighter jet.

It’s obviously much more complicated than that. I used to design radar systems (antenna design) but I only know a small amount. 

Search for “radar cross section” if you want to see the technical aspect. It’s like an electromagnetic fingerprint.

You can spoof fingerprints (and it’s indeed done sometimes with drones to protect B-52 bomber for example). Advanced designs just reduce radar signature (B2) so that it’s just not detected altogether. If you aren’t detected, no need to identify."
