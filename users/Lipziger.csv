I think everyone was confused. The mouse, because she thought she would die just to land in a bowl full of food. The cat as she apparently didn't know what to do with it now (or maybe she just wasn't hungry, bc. she was actually a good hunter) and we as we saw it once we went to the kitchen and also didn't know what to do with it."

But... there is no plastic fork in it anymore. Because its important to reduce plastic.

So I can proudly say. The job is done and everything will be fine."

There are some amazing block companies out there now. Obviously they don't get SW licences or something but for non franchise stuff I ignore Lego entirely. And I'm not talking about the ""illegal"" ones."

wholesomememes,fe6tvgs,t1_fe5tyft,1578905167.0,Wow the down votes. Its not as great as KOTOR story wise but it can be a lot of fun and has better story lines than a lot of single player games. Of course mixed with MMO elements but I'm still having a blast with it as a full solo player.

yeah - worst thing they can do is to bump into you repeatedly. Or avoid the open window at all cost - At least once they're inside, hah."
Awwducational,fdxqhoc,t1_fdvqr19,1578771829.0,"People forget that a lot of insects pollinate. Also mosquitos do it and lots of others. Usually not nearly as efficient as bees but they have huge numbers combined and are in combination very important. 

I know that there are some really mean wasps in some places but I love European wasps. They don't really harm anyone and as you said, keep other insects in check. I think I've been stung exactly once by a wasp because I crushed her but that's it. But I also don't freak out like so many people.

I always watch them fascinated when they take a big bite out of something I want to eat or drink something from a glass. And countless of them ran around on my fingers, arms, legs and my face. Never did they do anything, apart from 2 wasps that decided to actually bite my finger. Probably because I handled meat right before. 

I think they're some of the most interesting insects overall and are absolutely beautiful creatures."

socialanxiety,fdmsa10,t3_em1qd6,1578563274.0,"I hated this as well and was pretty much panicking when I had to speak in front of the class, BUT it should stay the way it is, since school should not just teach you the stuff on the plan but also behaviour and should prepare you for what comes after.

And the World doesn't give a damn that you're insecure. It will be way harder to get anything done later in life when you never left your bubble. I don't think bursting that bubble too aggressively in school is always good but it has to be done one way or another.

I had a teacher that took a speach test with me every single week. No exception. I won't say I lost my fear entirely but it pushed me to find something to deal with it or go down with it. I hated the teacher at first, but when I left school and even now at nearly 30 I think of him as one of the best teachers I could've had. But then again, he knew how to pull it off without being an ass about it.

And you also have to think about the people with different strengths. Some are very vocal, an active but might lack in other departments. This might be a thing they're looking forward in school and that might help them get through topics or classes that are incredibly hard for them."

swtor,fd4khfd,t3_ek1ejj,1578168352.0,"IMO that depends highly on their story and how much you enjoy that, since this will bring you to around lvl 50. After that you can have good builds with any class to go for max level.

Because what's it worth to have early maneuverability or a more complete skill routine if you don't enjoy the story or the class overall? Sounds more of a hassle than to deal with more basic skills for some time. 

I really don't think the enjoyment for leveling is heavily based on the order of your skills but just subjective, based on what class you want to play and what story you enjoy.

And then there are about 1000 posts about what storylines are the best.

But based on skills, any class that has stealth, so you can ignore a lot of trash or a class that has strong AOE can be really good. You don't really need complex builds while leveling anyways and having strong AOE like the sorc makes it even easier, but that can also become kind of lame after a while. I would probably say sorcerer... you'll have your essential skills really fast, don't need a lot of maneuverability bc. you're ranged and you'll melt through every group really fast. And the story is entertaining."

boxoffice,fbvlolo,t1_fbve99f,1577132607.0,"The first one was by far the best selling and it would've been regardless of who had anything to do with it because it was the first Star Wars movie in a long time. ""THE"" movie franchise .... yeah - A monkey would've made a fortune with that.  


And then it went down pretty drastically. Not only the gross income, but also the reviews.  


Now they even pissed off the people that actually enjoyed TLJ, lol. How is that good handling?  


There's also the cost for advertisement and all that - The whole cost besides the SW movies overall.  


But as I said - It is essentially guaranteed do make tons of money with the SW franchise - Right now it would be pretty much impossible to lose money with it. But the income is still way behind expectations and THAT is what's important. Not that it makes alright money, but that it makes way less than anticipated, that the income goes down with every movie and the reviews break down as well - both from critics and viewers.   


None of that is well handled - Making money with a Franchise that big doesn't mean it's handled well, either. There wouldn't be that much controversy if she did a good job. Or did you hear that much about Marvel? Which is under the same roof now?   


playing it safe, then turning everything around 180Â° - piss off a lot of fans and then turn everything around again with the third movie, pissing off even the folks that weren't pisses at first. Really great handling. ..."
