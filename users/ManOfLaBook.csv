Benjamin Franklin did not discover nor invent electricity. What he did was find a way to harness lightning (electricity) away from buildings and hence save the infrastructure, by  conducting a series of groundbreaking experiments (he was the first to use the terms positive and negative to describe electricity).



A the time Franklin was the only one, through the experiments I mentioned, to believe that there were similarities between electricity and lightning and he set out to prove so. He also wanted to protect  people, buildings, and other structures from lightning and invented the lightning rod which made him famous all over the world (before that, during a storm, you could only hope that your building wouldn't burn down). This was the idea behind the whole experiment with the kite, basically Franklin was too impatient to wait for a storm to strike his lightning rod.
