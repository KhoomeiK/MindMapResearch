I know we're joking around here but you peaked my curiosity.

Turns out that, although rare, [pig-cow hybrids](http://www.macroevolution.net/cow-pig-hybrids.html)are possible.  

Pig-sheep hybrids are more common though so you could probably get a pork lamb. 

[human-pig hybrids](https://amp-theguardian-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/26/first-human-pig-chimera-created-in-milestone-study?amp_js_v=a2&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQCKAE%3D#aoh=15793710023303&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fscience%2F2017%2Fjan%2F26%2Ffirst-human-pig-chimera-created-in-milestone-study) are also a thing recently.

That chick even admits she couldn't find any copy and pasted reviews but her argument instead hinged on to many people saying saga (saga isn't an unusual word when fans are talking about star wars).  

The whole argument is full of halfway thought out pattern recognition, and is flimsy at best. It offers no real world empirical data to compare to, or support her claims.
