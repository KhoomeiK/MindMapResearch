Correct me if I'm wrong but you're suggesting that I uproot my life and move somewhere that EMS pays more? If that's the case you're missing the point. EMS is underpaid everywhere in the US.

>shortage of EMTs

Are you fucking high?

Your 11.33/hr is not synonymous with my 14.03/hr. Guarantee I have a much higher cost of living. 150k house will put me in the ghetto."

ems,fejs0iu,t1_fejc8hw,1579184411.0,"Okay but they CAN increase pay without a significant change in their profit margins, especially when we're talking about 1000% mark ups like you see in EMS. Employers use this ""we'll have to fire people"" to con idiots like you"
ems,fejrrmg,t1_feih7ts,1579184227.0,What happens when the perceived value doesn't match the actual value? This argument is so god damn stupid because it implies that employers actually give a shit about your worth. They're gonna pay you the least amount they can get away with. Your concept also only works if theres competition and in EMS there really isnt much. Theres only 3 other 911 services within 2 hours of me and I'm already working for the highest paid one.

JusticeServed,fdu3r69,t1_fdo5t00,1578727011.0,Your results may vary. For us the signature is you agreeing for us to treat you and bill your insurance (the latter being the important part in this context). Refusing to sign just means the full bill goes directly to you instead of your insurance.
JusticeServed,fdu3dgq,t1_fdna2v4,1578726806.0,EMT here. This varies wildly between EMS agencies and circumstances. Not transporting may be cheaper but you will probably still pay something. For us it's like $100 if we don't transport and actually do the paperwork. I know I wont put any patient info down if it's literally just a 70 year old grandma who fell out of her chair and just needs help getting on her feet.

JusticeServed,fdu2sx9,t1_fdp5f3u,1578726515.0,Signing is a promise to appear at court and receipt of the ticket. If you refuse to sign then they have to take you to jail to insure that you show up for your court date. If you didn't sign (acknowledge reciept) they let you go and you don't show up to court then they cant actually do anything about it.

Also did it actually turn out to be a heart attack or just chest pain? A lot of people will say they've had a heart attack just because they've had chest pain in the past.
