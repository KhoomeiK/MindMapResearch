Futurology,ff68nug,t1_ff67i6l,1579621734.0,"You're absolutely correct on every point, but it goes beyond that.

Poverty is absolutely a factor. If I was in absolute poverty I'd probably get pretty sketchy about things myself, but if you go to Chinese markets here in the west the buck at any cost attitude still dominates. There's no poverty motivation, it's just greed.    

The west certainly isn't above such attitudes, but there's a general moral code that most people follow, including criminals.   It's almost completely absent in Chinese culture.  

It's a lack of good governance that keeps people ignorant.  Any society can suffer from ignorance. We have tons in the west.  But when it comes to health, our governments spend considerable resources on education campaigns and shifting attitudes when they spot health problems.  They don't even try in China."
Futurology,ff66bqt,t1_ff64x34,1579620196.0,"That's my point. Bats cause obvious harm, as well as many of the other exotic animals because they are captured from the wild, not farmed like pigs or chickens.  

Not that pigs or chickens don't have their own history of spreading disease, but at least they're isolated on farms so things can be contained.

When you get these markets with live animals, many trapped, then slam them together in close quarters, disease has a field day spreading across species and evolving into fun new diseases.

In the west we would see this, launch a public information campaign, regulate things to eliminate the problem, and enforce compliance.

In China they say well we don't want anyone not making a quick buck, so let's just mop up the mess when it happens. 

It's a cultural thing where they just don't give a crap about other peoples health if they can make even a nickle in profit from being shitty."

This looks tough for the masses, but is meaningless and pathetic by any measure.

BUT, if they shoot down an airliner with no Americans on board, but lots of Allies citizens....THAT sends a message; and minimizes the risk of retaliation by the US.

I had a HARD time at first. I'm not cut out for raising young kids and I shut down some days.  But I also had a fantastic family to lean on, including my ex's mother who is a fantastic person.  Everyone rallied around me in support. Now the kids are older and I'm having a lot more fun raising them, and we have the deepest connection.  The three of us are a team and it's super rewarding.  I've also let go of the initial anger I had.  It's there a little, but life has moved on and it's just the new normal.

And there's some humor to be had. My absolute favorite picture is of my ex wife just after we split, posing infront of her new boat on a trailer attached to her new SUV that she bought with my money. And she's wearing a t-shirt that says ""I've got this""

It was all repossessed by debit collectors months later. 

She, in fact, did not have it.

ðŸ¤£"
SingleDads,fee2lt4,t1_feb4twv,1579025100.0,"Mine was a lot more complex and only evident to me in hindsight.  She was 20 when we met, I was 25.  She was with a total trash bag but that didn't matter to me. She was warm, friendly, and looking for love. No drug or alcohol issues.  We moved in with eachother almost immediately.  It quickly became apparent she was lazy, slept like 12 hours a day, was a total slob, and couldn't pay a bill before it got to collections, but I thought I could fix all that.  She was SO easy to get along with and we clicked otherwise, it seemed like minor problems.  Everyone grows up eventually, right?  As the years passed, I had some success. I nagged her into finding a real job, she sorta stepped up with the cleaning, and I learned it was just easier to pay the bills myself and let her just give me some cash on payday. We got married and then had kids. And that's when the issues started.

She stayed at home for 4 years raising our two kids.  She was a FANTASTIC mom and did all the kid stuff. But she generally had friends over all day every day while I was at work, and none of the 'housewife' stuff ever got done. I was coming home from work and then cooking and cleaning.  I felt like a bitch busting my ass off all day while she socialized and did fun stuff with the kids, but none of the chores.

Finally the kids were both in school and it was time to go back to work...and she just didn't. At first I bought her excuses, but after a while it was pretty apparent she had no desire to work.   So iI read her the riot act.  Get to work or get out.  So, she she decided to cheat with some guy on FB she used to go to highschool with, feathered her near, and left me for him.

She moved in with the guy immediately after we split. She took 100k as her ""half"" despite hardly ever helping with any bills, but that's the rules so I gladly coughed up.  

This guy turned out to be a drug dealer and didn't work. She rented a massive, unaffordable house, bought a boat and a new car, and they both partied 7 days a week with no income.  3 months later I find out he's hitting her, and the kids are telling me he screams a lot.   I began preparing to go to court for custody.

Fortunately, 5 months after we split, she ran out of money (all 100k gone) and moved 60 miles away with him. She gave me the kids, except every second weekend.  1 month after that, the guy got drunk and beat the crap out of her and rolled her car into a canal. He spent 6 months in jail.  That was enough to get her to leave him.

But then she just met the next loser. This guy was less.ciolent, but also a drug dealer. I just stoped giving her the kids when someone told me there was an overdose at her house. She agreed at the time it was for the best.

The thing is, she was SO close with my kids.  It ripped their heart out. I will never forget holding my 6 year old son as he balled his eyes out, holding his hand over his heart and saying ""it hurts so much, I miss mommy""

I have never hated anyone in my life until that moment.  The absolute rage I feel is unimaginable. I never fathomed any human could do that to. Especially someone who on the outside seemed so friendly and caring.  

In reality she was a chameleon who sponges off everyone around her and is only as nice as she needs to be to get what she wants.  I was blind to it for 13 years.  She's the definition of evil"

SingleDads,fe9l6i0,t3_eo64ha,1578938985.0,"I'm in the same situation. My ex voluntarily walked away from the kids because the abusive pricks she chooses were more important then her kids.  We've never set foot in a courtroom.  

She descended into drugs and the whole lifestyle her boyfriends lead.  She pays zero child support.  She's around, but only when it works for her, which is typically a short visit every 2 to 4 weeks, holidays, and the occasional text messages with the kids.  

Here's the thing.  Everyone needs to be able to look themselves in the mirror and say ""I'm a good person"". People who aren't, bullshit themselves.  So she's invented a narrative that she wants the kids 50/50, but it's ME stoping it.  I swindled the kids from her. She would see them ALL the time if it could only be at her house. She would do anything for them, and I'm a controlling monster. Why should she pay child support when I've stolen the kids?  And to make it believable, every 6 months or so, she blasts me over text demanding I return the kids. When I say no, it's proof that she tried, and I stoped it. And I get the ""one day the kids will see the truth"", and they'll resent me for it. Blah blah blah.

The rules are she can see the kids ANY time she wants, unsupervised, but they cannot go to her home (it's unfit for kids and her friends are thugs ). She typically shows up at sports games, or hangs out at her mother's with them for the odd afternoon. If they're lucky, they get a sleepover there. 

Every time she texts me telling me she wants the kids back, I explain that I'm not comfortable with it because I don't trust her judgement. BUT, if she would commit to a regular visitation schedule, and stick to it, that would be a good first step to building trust and we could discuss next steps when that happens.  There's a path she can take to get what she wants.

That's never acceptable to her (because she doesn't want the kids, only an excuse), and she says she deserves them back without question and anything less then that is unacceptable.  That's when I politely end the conversation and point her to the family courts if she disagrees.  She never pursues it.

But, she can tell herself she tried, and look at herself in the mirror for one more day."

Go to a hotel, place it on the counter during check-in, and demand things you'd easily get, like extra towels."
funny,fcosx8e,t1_fconpn4,1577840669.0,"That's a load of bunk they tell people to encourage fixing dogs.  I have two male dogs that aren't fixed and there is absolutely zero difference in their temperament from any other neutered males I have ever owned.  My vet is pretty honest and advised I only do it if they're pissing indoors or I want to let them roam loose, which will never happen.

They DO pee inside the house more and it's much harder to train them out of it. But you still can. It's a rare occurrence in my home, but it took a lot of work to get there.   They also drip goo from time to time, which is kinda gross lol

But my dogs are not aggressive. They don't hump any more or less then any other dog. And they get along just fine.  I have a boxer and an American bulldog."
canada,fcgp3ew,t1_fcgbhld,1577642543.0,"The problem is the US. If anyone gets too serious about climate change and drives up the cost of doing business, companies simply leave for the US. They control the world economy, nothing can really happen without them, especially in Canada.  Stephen Harper's policy was essentially ""We will do whatever the Americans do"", because it is really the logical thing you can do.  Unfortunately, that also means doing nothing.

If America would regear their economy and start punishing countries economically that didn't align with a climate agenda, we could make some serious progress on this.  Unfortunately, Republicans."

A month later the guy runs a stop sign during a pursuit and gets crushed by a car.  I actually have the last photo taken of the guy alive."
