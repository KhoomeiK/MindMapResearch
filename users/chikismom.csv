JustNoSO,fdq6k7z,t3_emlf05,1578657060.0,No it’s his house that I lived in for over a year
selfimprovement,fdpg3wh,t3_em0cnr,1578627725.0,"Thank you and you as well! Definitely practice being more intentional about your wants and needs for the year. I made a vision board to help focus me and remind me tbh of things I wanted to change, remove, and add to my life"
selfimprovement,fdn0w3i,t3_em0cnr,1578573834.0,I’m aware
selfimprovement,fdmlcav,t3_em0cnr,1578554260.0,"I decided to relocate to warmer weather. Was in upstate ny and wanted to return back to NC. Felt I was my happiest and healthiest there and recognized how moving back to NY for work impacted my mental health (was there two years). The job wasn’t too bad. Part time work, good pay but still wasn’t making ends meet and the work became repetitive and tbh boring. Didn’t feel any kind of challenge or like I was utilizing my degree and skills appropriately"
selfimprovement,fdmf9w3,t3_em0cnr,1578547967.0,Thank you ❤️
selfimprovement,fdmf9c5,t3_em0cnr,1578547953.0,❤️❤️❤️
selfimprovement,fdm872y,t3_em0cnr,1578542205.0,"You’re welcome! I’ve often had to leave work environments that have become toxic and stressful, to the point where I’m dreading going to work and it’s deeply impacting my mental health and I’m questioning myself. Money is important, but I honestly went to college with none. Depended solely on financial aid. Some redditor assumes under this post that I had money because I left my job... no. I just realize what’s most important. I can secure a job in a month if I’m applying to jobs like it’s my job. Don’t let someone talk you into staying at a table that no longer serves you. Not even free water, if you get my drift. Rooting for you!"
selfimprovement,fdm7wof,t3_em0cnr,1578541993.0,"Haha we’ve been best friends since 7th grade and are now both 25, in therapy, trying to heal from a lot. I love her!"

sex,fcap2ax,t3_egpm14,1577573721.0,"This deserved gold! So so so important.
All this yes. This would be a good post for reddit dead bedroom ( idk how to put the link in) but there’s a lot of y’all about high and low libido partners and tbh a lot of time the LL partner are experiencing these things!"
calmhands,fcadaqq,t3_egsb2f,1577567234.0,Thanks! Yeah I don’t bite my nails. I went to my pcp and they felt maybe it was a fungus? But I’ve also heard it’s due to improper nail cutting. Just want it resolved because the very corner gives me discomfort. I’ve tried soaks too. Sigh
selfimprovement,fbt308i,t3_ee1981,1577066947.0,"Thank you, I will definitely employ this"
