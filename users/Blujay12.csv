Also worried about thermal paste, I need that when replacing a cpu correct?

Just their own weird way of spending time I guess."
MurderedByWords,fdtpyxe,t1_fdt02mj,1578720405.0,"I mean the first guy was ""rping"" you being at a taco bell drive through, so in that sense it was the text version of someone going to a taco bell and saying they're vegan and they're too good for fast food? 

It's still twitter though, so i get the confusion, and it is stupid. It's a Filthy Frank joke where a vegan can't stop saying they are vegan, and how superior they are, which hasn't been a problem ever, and hasn't been funny since he did the video."
