UpliftingNews,ff89ncn,t1_ff7ewdj,1579670110.0,"You are absolutely 100% incorrect on every front. Antifa has caused more damages and disruption than any group. Their greatest strength is disruption in general. A group of purple haired, eyeliner wearing mamas boys with little emotional control over their hate."

4kTV,ff7ewtr,t3_es2b88,1579647964.0,It would bother the shit out of me to be honest. I wouldn’t be able to unsee it.
UpliftingNews,ff79ugp,t1_ff6krbs,1579644120.0,"Much like how antifa operates, you’re being downvoted because it doesn’t suit the agenda. 
Honestly, I am actually really surprised people are even defending them...shows the average age here."

UpliftingNews,ff6tmf6,t1_ff6qo1d,1579634629.0,"“At this point” as in today. 

I worked just as hard if not harder than anyone else around me to make things happen. Because I’m white, I’m supposedly privileged.  Tell me again how you or a person of different race has less opportunity to succeed? Lesser opportunity for education? Health? Can you state your opinions when you please? Can you protest? Can leave? Can you start your own business?

There are definitely instances of racism but they go both ways for sure sure. Neither should be ignored.

You are battling culture not race."
PublicFreakout,ff6qy5y,t3_eruvnk,1579633030.0,You spit in someone’s face you should expect to catch a beat down.
UpliftingNews,ff6qce9,t1_ff6pptu,1579632673.0,Racism is swinging both ways at this point. Just like kkk and antifa. It’s very apparent on both sides.
UpliftingNews,ff6nr5n,t1_ff6lvpc,1579631118.0,Antifa shows up regardless. They create more damage/fights than nazis. We will get there with them eventually as well.
UpliftingNews,ff6n336,t1_ff6l84r,1579630712.0,You are smoking something and i want some. The left is offended by everything and anything and the accusation of racism is thrown out like a used car salesmen’s business card.

donthelpjustfilm,feyk1p0,t1_feyg8p4,1579446558.0,You’re absolutely correct. That reflects pretty shitty parenting if they’re ok even thinking about throwing haymakers at each other like that.

4kTV,fewb1dc,t1_few485k,1579407782.0,A 55” C9 runs you at over $2500! For $1500 at 65” you can probably find a Samsung q7 or x900.
RedDeadOnline,few9gzk,t3_eqi8lr,1579407143.0,"I beg to differ. Apart from less animals I love the tension of not knowing if someone is good or bad, doing a long distance delivery (or encountering one and deciding) or being in a busy town where anything can happen. It’s fun and gives you that “feel”. 

It’s even more fun when you have a posse of 2-4 with you."

playstation,fep137i,t1_feovd56,1579309779.0,Horizon zero dawn was specials for me. I actually gave up on it thinking it was too hard. Then picked it back and everything just seemed to click all of a sudden. Even bought and finished the dlc. Incredible game second only to red dead for me.
fightporn,fen63ir,t1_fen51j1,1579277793.0,ah true. all bets are off there.
fightporn,fen307z,t3_eq0q19,1579275839.0,big  dude really should have shown restraint there. its basically child abuse here.

Visions.ca has some great prices for the hisense. And Costco for the Vizio."
RedDeadOnline,fekg58y,t3_epjs83,1579199343.0,Weird. Last night I spent an hour with no animals. Reconnected after a third time and all of a sudden they were everywhere. Did an update or patch come late last night?

4kTV,feilelh,t1_feijtmc,1579141254.0,"Better contrast and blacks, better motion handling, better gaming features, less money, better OS. Seems like a no brainer to me. 

As for the processor, I remember everyone saying the same thing about last years processor but it is horrible. I love the Sony but in this case the Samsung is the smarter buy."

4kTV,feihvvm,t1_feibz2b,1579138903.0,The 950 is MAYBE on par or close to the q70. X900? Not as good.
4kTV,fei3t03,t3_ep8w6j,1579129658.0,"From my understanding the Samsung has better picture quality than the x950 let alone the x900.
