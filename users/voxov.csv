A comprehensive view is needed before a successful model can be declared.

\*edit\* I searched for overturned conviction Missouri, and [the first result in Google was a sexual assault case](https://www.innocenceproject.org/wrongful-conviction-overturned-for-missouri-man/).

Last year, the Missouri AG reported [Black Missouri drivers 91% more likely to be stopped](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/black-missouri-drivers-91-more-likely-to-be-stopped-state-attorney-general-finds)

gaming,fe08b15,t1_fdu3atu,1578805784.0,"Ah yeah, meant 火. Was thinking of 火曜日 and hi/bi softened sounds, then used wrong kanji. 

I know the softened sound for many characters is normal, but my point was that the phrase フシギダネ , prior to pokemon popularity, would very much elicit a certain expectation when written in katakana like that. I don't think any regular reader would have thought of seed, so it seems like a good pun to me. Then again, maybe it's an old joke and was obvious? I don't know Pokemon, let alone the Japanese names, so that's just what jumped out to me. Could be missing the mark entirely, but I'm a big fan of wordplay, so I thought I'd give it a shot."
gaming,fdv5dn0,t1_fdumqyz,1578743379.0,"Right, that's why it's a pun here is what I'm saying, not a typo. Just seeing the text, the much more common way to read the letters would suggest the meaning ""strange, isn't it?"". However, if spoken, the intonation here would give a more clear grouping of the syllables, so it takes on an alternate meaning, which may not be grammatically incorrect, but is far less common in abstract.

My point overall is that it's definitely intended as a joke, not just a coincidence."
gaming,fdtzsrx,t1_fdt9vg3,1578724974.0,"Hmm, I don't know Pokemon well, but if I see

フシギダネ

Then this to me is a joke, since the word for seed is ""タネ / tane"", and this is written ""ダネ / dane"", so it's read ""strange, isn't it?"", not, ""strange seed"".  It's still a name pun.

ヒトカゲ  this one is tougher...

ヒ = fire, トカゲ = lizard, so fire lizard. But, you can also write it as 日と鹿毛 (fire & faun color), which is a reference to the colors of charmander. It's a description of his appearance; still a valid and pretty good pun.

gachagaming,fdmnjo9,t1_fdmmryl,1578556880.0,"Yeah, pretty girl games are very much flavor of the month. 

What I haven't seen much of, which surprises me, are games that have less default sexualized art, and then sell those as skins in a vanity shop. Selling skins lets you have twice as many character designs for people to aim for, with half the mechanics balancing.  Also, more of a something-for-everyone approach.

&#x200B;

For a really wild system, check out gacha game Hop Step Jumpers, which let players make and submit character art, which then gets voted on and purchased with in-game currency. Players who make the most popular art get currency added to their accounts. Incredible way to crowdsource content. Instead of hiring artists, you just need to hire a moderator or two that can review submissions. ([I made my own, vicious version of their cute catgirl.](https://www.newgrounds.com/art/view/voxov/ferrous) It wasn't well received, but I thought it was funny)."

I believe you're confusing civil disobedience and public action such as boycotts.

askscience,fddeg8b,t1_fdd8sey,1578308492.0,"Note that significant digits in game collision detection are practically limited both by the observer's capacity to perceive them, but also by other physical limitations of the same system. Even if you made something vastly more precise than the brain could process, it would still be moot in this case, since the other peripheral processes of the system are not capable of matching such accuracy, and so the data would immediately be truncated and lost.

&#x200B;

As an example, if you had a game with a play area the size of a galaxy, and could fire light-speed attacks (assuming this is space and light is traveling in a vacuum), then even if you could plan amazingly precise shots over incomprehensibly large distances, you'd still have little use for that as a player, since 1) the reaction time needed would often supersede human capability to act, and 2) the process of interacting with a UI to issue a command would likely fall outside of the required action window.

&#x200B;

In simulations, this is overcome by having a preset process act out a planned script. While that's still possible in the case of a game, it essentially removes player agency, rendering the 'game' more of a hands-off demonstration.

On the flip side, it could end up being a fun game for Skynet."
