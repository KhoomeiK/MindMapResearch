If you are trying to be a kind person and work hard you are being you. Why would you expect more than what you are? Why set a standard for yourself that you can reach? People do it all of the time

If you have a failing that disappoints you, accept it. You don't have to love it, you don't even have to like it. Just accept it, That is the path to self love. Look for ways to become more and always accept that you are trying and make that the only thing you measure yourself by. Are you trying? Some days you'll be able try very hard.
