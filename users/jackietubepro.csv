AskReddit,fdm6wfw,t3_eld4mi,1578541274.0,"Hers a list
1. Got in trouble for talking but I was lip sync 
2. The teacher told us to stop at the first gym door. All of the other boys ran past the door and I was the only one who followed directions. Naw, I got in trouble for running but the other boys didn’t get in trouble 
3. I checked out a book that was on display in the library. It was a good book even though it had some words (ass, and sexual intercourse). I forgot it and the teacher took it back to the library because some kids in the other class was being immature (as if I was normal) and got a fine until I told the librarians that the teacher took it back. They called my mom
4. I arrived to the classroom earlier than everyone else. I must have got there too early because I went back up and they haven’t made it to the stairs. The asshole teacher was going to write me up for being out of area. I tried to tell her but I was now being written up for being out of area AND disrespecting the teacher. I was being isolated to another classroom. As if that didn’t already pissed me off, another kid was isolated to the same room I was and he didn’t in much trouble. He was pretty much in time out for talking back to the teacher and I was wrote up for being too early for class. This was all in the 6th grade btw."
