AskReddit,ff0p9sr,t1_ff0dpxn,1579470964.0,"That’s only partly true. Yes, you can get a BA in physics, but it basically only qualifies you to teach at a community college or high school. You’ll rarely work in the actual field of physics with that arts degree. 

The “liberal arts” part of the degree speaks more towards the general education credits required rather than the specialized curriculum. Where a BS in physics will have much heavier math and sciences requirements, and a BA will have much more humanities requirements in their degree. 

If you are considered an actual career in physics, other than in lower level academia, you need a BS. 

In your case, if your Biology degree was a BA, you would likely not be qualified to do much in the actual field of biology.

There are a ton of people out there that get those degrees thinking they are equivalent, and are sadly mistaken when they can’t find work in their actual field.  Especially in tech. 

For example, a BA in computer science is functionally useless unless you want a low level IT job for which you will still likely require a number of professional certifications. A BS in computer science will actually afford you a job in the field."

I’ve also interacted with well to do suits in NYC that spoke sophisticated and were some of the most racist people you’ll meet. 

Redneck racism is just marketed differently. It’s more upfront and verbally vulgar. But it’s no more or less racist than someone that treats you horribly based on the color of your skin and doesn’t use the crude language, which you tend to find more in urban culture.  I could argue the language is less offensive than the actions.

You need to start with a price point and desired living condition.  Do you have $5000/month of income for housing, or $1500?  Do you want a backyard and a white picket fence, or are you ok with a condo, townhouse, etc?  Are you ok with a bus, or do you want a train commute?

Answer those and you will get much better answers here.  Everyone else is just throwing out the suburb they like.  Which may not even be practical for you, depending on price point.

Generally the further out you go, the cheaper things get, but there are vast exceptions to that rule.  Also, consider that commuting cost can increase significantly the further out you get...  A daily commute from Secaucus NJ will cost you $9 per day.  A commute from the outer limits of Metro North or NJ transit could cost you upwards of $40 per day.  

Most people prefer a train commute over a bus due to reliability (subjective considering NJ transit), but still.  If that is a thing for you, the best two lines will be metro north and NJ transit (NE corridor).  The further out you go on both of those lines the cheaper things will get and the more space you will have.  You can go as far north as Putnam (mayyybe southern Duchess) county on Metro north and still be under 1.5 hours.  And as far SW as roughly Princeton in NJ using the same time.  There is a world of difference along both lines, depending on what you have to spend, and if you are willing to buy or rent.  I don't know shit about long island, but I hear the LIRR is swell.  Unfortunately, as I understand it, you have to get way far out on the island to get the same value as NJ or heading North into NY.

The Iranians have anti ship missiles lining the coast of the Strait.  Meaning we will have to bomb the shit out of some ground targets, and likely set up a presence at strategic places along the strait to ensure safety of passage.  

No small task, which is why the Iranians are so dangerous in the region."

todayilearned,fck09s1,t1_fck04rx,1577712498.0,"On the infrastructure side, not so much as we are mostly engineers and architects. If you want to work on the IT side of the house, sure. I build the shell and infrastructure of data centers. Basically what keeps them alive. I stop at the racks. 

There are a ton of CS majors working on the server hardware and software side of the house. Usually they work on my client’s side. In OPs example, they are likely Apple employees. Though in some examples, they can be outsourced firms as well.

On the hardware side you have the groups that install the kit (servers) and maintain them, as well as repair when broken. Sometimes reconfigure. On the software side, it really depends on what the function of the data center is, but most times the software guys will never even set foot in the data center."

That said, the ones in question have redundant power supplies so that should, in theory, never happen. 

I design data centers, exactly like this one. Man traps like this are no different, and are always required to fail safe just like any means of egress.

In many places they are required to release in the event of a fire alarm too."
UpliftingNews,fciebt3,t1_fcidxsv,1577661266.0,"Kenya is more developed than most places in Africa. And the whole point of this post was an emerging technology to eventually replace reliance on ground sources of water. Which this technology won’t for some time, due to scalability factors. 

Not that it’s a bad thing, it’s just not cost effective enough to use at the moment, until ground water becomes more scarce and costly.

None of which was a reason to call the poster a dumbass above. 

An urban person in Kenya likely consumes MUCH more than two liters, as other posters suggest. You are right that Americans and the West consume more. But 100 gallons per day in an urban environment isn’t so far off, even for Kenya."

You are right that the money doesn’t show right up after the fireworks. But the city can spend the money like it does. That’s precisely how most cities (and a lot of companies) operate, using operating funds from banks, etc, that are backed by future revenues. 

So essentially, more fucked than before. 

The correct answer is reallocate some future non-revenue generating spend to the fire cause now, and then when the bill for whatever that allocation was earmarked for comes up, either make cuts or issue bonds to stop that gap. Problem solved."
