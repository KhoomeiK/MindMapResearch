Step four: have a total fucking meltdown when faced with having to go back to your job. Consider web camming, or just strapping yourself in your car and shooting it off the nearest bridge. Eventually say fuck it and quit.

Step five: crap, you have to get a new job. Apply for one zillion things, unsuccessfully try to get unemployment. Start selling your stuff and collecting nickles and dimes from around the house to buy things.
