What you eat is not important, just the amount of calories. Should you eat nutrient dense foods? Sure. You don’t have to though. If you’d like half your calories to come from Fruity Peebles and milk one day, like I did, go for it, but I’d be sure to keep up your protein with a lean source like chicken breast- or save some calories for chicken thighs. Both can be made delicious. But I digress. Just weigh your foods and pay attention to serving size. Even nutrient dense “healthy” foods can be eaten in too large a portion. Exercise does not matter in regards to weight loss- if you do exercise and set your calorie goal too high to compensate you won’t lose weight,as I did when I began running every other day. I wouldn’t trust exercise calorie trackers either.  Just load any free app onto your phone, calculate you total daily energy expenditure (TDEE), grab your food scale, and eat what you want within the limit. No need for cheat days when you have what you crave in moderate amounts. Some days I snack a bit, but usually I have 2 or 3 meals- easier to track eating food in discreet time periods. Tracking doesn’t take long either- I spend 4 minutes max weighing out portions.  When you do this continuously your weight *will* drop. I find measuring my weight every day at the same time then using the app Happy Scale to track my weight trend helpful as my weight can fluctuate 4 pounds in a day. This way I can see a decrease whereas measuring once a week may not reflect my actual loss due to fluctuation. Just know weight loss is definitely achievable, and if you stick to your habits you’re not going to gain your weight back. You can definitely do this."
fatlogic,ff6062y,t3_erux8f,1579615709.0,"No, too much fat *is* unhealthy and it *is* solely portion control. Your weight will decrease staying under your TDEE by eating Corn Pops and that ridiculous but awesome donut-breaded breakfast sandwich at Dunkin Donuts one day then chicken breast and steam vegetables the next. Calorie counting apps are free."
fatlogic,ff5u04q,t3_ertbqb,1579610188.0,"“Dehumanizes fat people?” BMI is simply an assessment of risk. I certainly didn’t feel dehumanized when my doctor told me I was developing NAFLD at 30 BMI and increasing my risk for diabetes that run in my family- I just went and lost 40 lbs, and am continuing to lose until I hit around a BMI of 22, going up if that’s uncomfortable. Everything is taken as degrading with these people. That can’t be comfortable."
fatlogic,ff4v64h,t1_ff3vzub,1579573205.0,I can believe Carl Sagan’s stash is still this potent.
xxfitness,fetdffq,t3_eq8gb4,1579374204.0,"I enjoy lifting for the feeling of accomplishment when I hit a higher weight, but the endorphin rush comes from cardio. I do Jeff Galloway’s run/walk because I find running for a minute then walking for a minute more involved, and the endorphins come more easily than straight running. I can run straight for an hour to mix things up. but on longer runs I have more energy run/walking, and my pace is the same as continuous running. I’ve even gotten nice endorphin boost from hour long walks or 45 minutes on the elliptical. I feel great throughout the rest of the day after cardio and less anxious. Perhaps try some easy cardio then work to something more intense."
fatlogic,fep9iov,t1_fep4to3,1579315167.0,Oh that’s extremely reasonable. The ones I’d seen were like 80$. Thanks for sharing.
fatlogic,feozvzl,t1_feoyher,1579309019.0,"I haven’t looked into those much. I just use my cheap bathroom scale that’s off by 4lbs but is consistent- it’s probably on ground that isn’t entirely level. When I get to my goal weight in 4-5 months I’d like to get a DEXA scan to see how much muscle I’ve retained/body fat percentage, then start lifting more."
fatlogic,feoxkku,t1_feow1la,1579307569.0,As I’m losing I’m weighing everyday too using Happy Scale to track my progress. I’ve found this takes the emotional element out of seeing the number- it’s the trend that matters. I’m just going to treat obesity as a chronic condition and be sure to measure.
fatlogic,feo8d0n,t3_eq5xqr,1579296493.0,So when you reach your goal weight you have to toss out your scale?

fatlogic,fdxh6jl,t3_en9y8m,1578768675.0,"I see what this is- more BMI denialism, and another attempt to connect BMI to racism. BMI differences amongst racial/ethnic groups *are* studied. An article I just read referred to current research that Black people may have a lower ideal BMI than those of European descent. BMI began studying white men, yes, but FAs refuse to look further than its origins."

fatlogic,fdh0uyr,t1_fdgz6a5,1578412932.0,"I just make whatever I’d like to eat, or whatever everyone in my house wants, and weigh out a portion. It takes 2 minutes maximum and is certainly no obsession."
fatlogic,fddi8jd,t1_fddfmbj,1578313357.0,They are but the percentage of eating disorders in the US is 2.7% according to NIMH. Their focus on eating disorders compared to the dangers of obesity is a huge whataboutism.

ShittyGifRecipes,fd8wqai,t3_ek2bzi,1578224570.0,Until the beer cheese sauce my three year old niece would definitely have eaten hotdog waffles. She enjoys ketchup by itself so that must be the palate they’re appealing to.
fatlogic,fd3otrj,t3_ejyo7h,1578160400.0,I’m eating adequately to maintain my muscle mass and achieve a healthy weight. That’s what she meant right?
fatlogic,fcwj1gd,t1_fcwfax3,1578026944.0,"Counting carbs and calories for Keto made me obsessive so I switched to IF, alternating 16 hour and 24 hour fast. Weight came off slowly because I would at times choose calorie dense foods but it still came off at about a half to 1 pound a week, and was far better than tracking for me mentally. I lost 30 pounds then maintained for a few months still using 16 hour fasts. I’ve switched to a new medication and am having far less anxiety so I’m tracking calories to get to my goal weight faster while still doing IF- 20 lbs to go. It’s an excellent tool, and an easy one to be flexible with if you want to have your skipped meal(s) on special occasions."
fatlogic,fbwphqc,t1_fbwnnak,1577155983.0,"I doubt they work in any healthcare or related field. People who do take health issues in their communities-be those communities defined by ethnicity, area or whatever-seriously. My professor of social policy certainly talked about obesity and its health consequences. Labeling health risks “slurs” or “anti-Black” doesn’t solve the problem. Besides, there *are* problems created by racism- Black mother mortality has been studied and its heightened occurrence has been shown to be caused by racism. Obesity just isn’t. The science ignorance or outright denial of FAs is offensive."
fatlogic,fbwnczu,t1_fbwmk0m,1577154455.0,"I don’t think these people know any black people. They just speak for them without looking into what communities actually want, which is available if you look- no need to take my word for it. I went to school with older Black women for social work and they most definitely value education and want their children to become professionals. Data on any racial/ethnic group exists, but ideologues don’t care."
fatlogic,fbwmdpd,t3_eeu4yj,1577153727.0,"This “anti-Black” is bullshit. Black people work in public health, social work, etc., and *want* obesity, food deserts and nutrition addressed. Communities want fresh, healthy food. This is racist."
fatlogic,fbwavzc,t3_eesbon,1577145119.0,"Lizzo responded to this citing her talent. Nothing about ridiculous fat acceptance or “obese” being a slur. I like her body positivity because shame leads obese people to over eat- it’s counterproductive. I know when I was depressed I was ashamed of how much I weighed- I was right at obese with a BMI of 30. Treating my depression has led me to lose 30 pounds- half way to a healthy BMI. Medical facts are not shaming- higher BMI raises health risks. This shouldn’t be brought up in the context of Lizzo, but neither should the denial of medical facts."
