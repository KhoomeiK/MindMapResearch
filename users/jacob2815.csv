He's never been childfree, but I'm a recent convert, decided I didn't want any around the time i graduated from college.

I've been trying to show him the truth, because i know that if he has kids, he will A. regret it and B. no longer have time to be friends. At least, not in the way that I want.

His reasons to have kids are because he wants a miniature him and because he thinks his kid is going to get rich and support him when he's old. I've told him how dumb that is, but, although he's overall intelligent, he's known to be lacking in common sense. It's so frustrating.

His gf of three years and I have gotten into casual arguments about it, because she desperately wants kids. Her main reason is because life has no meaning and she thinks having kids will give her life a purpose.

It's to the point that I'm genuinely concerned for her life. She's had a rough upbringing and goes through dark periods where she struggles with a desire to die. She's ripe for ppd and i'm afraid for them both if they have a kid, because she will realize when she has a kid that it's not going to work the way she's expecting and she might decide to off herself.

It's all fragmented, though. Reading it on your own as you play is enjoyable but you don't get the full picture unless you read all of it or read all the relevant pieces of the puzzle. It can be fun, but also a chore.

It does have that mmo/looter grind, which is where it turns people off. 

The art/design sound is also top notch. Enemies and weapons are unique looking and badass, locales are gorgeous, sky boxes are intoxicating and the soundtrack and effect sounds are second to none. 

The lore is also my biggest draw. I love the universe they've built. The histories of the races and characters are supremely interesting. But not everyone wants to read hours of written content or listen to videos from people who have.

Destiny struggles in three main areas: surface level story telling, weapon balancing, and the grinding. 

If you can look past those, it's an exceptional game. Not everyone can. It's my favorite game franchise of the decade, yet I haven't played in months. I love it, still, but I can't look past the weapon balancing. The gun meta is the exact same as it was in September when I was running the raid a bunch. That's boring to me, so I stopped playing. 

Because I'm such a lore nerd, the story on the surface is an easy ignore for me. And I'm a huge fan of grinding in games. All I need is the balancing to be fixed and I'll be back."

This was one of my big reasons for switching to PC for gaming. I like to multitask. Yes, of course, sometimes I will watch something or play a game that requires my full attention and i do enjoy it. 

It entirely depends on what game or what show. Or if you're watching sports. 

If I'm watching football, there's a ton of downtime and commercials. Im not gonna watch those commercials, so why not play a game on my phone or reddit. If I'm watching at my PC, I'll have the game up on my 2nd monitor and play something that doesn't require a ton of focus. Same is true for basketball, although less so. And if my team is playing, I'll absolutely drop what im playing and focus on it.

Quality TV shows or movies of course require full attention.

And story-based games or immersive games as well. I wouldn't watch something on the side when i'm playing something like Oblivion, Divinity 2, or Red Dead. Or if playing Destiny and I'm doing a raid or strike or some other story content for the first time where i need to hear/read what's being said. 

But there are tons of games with passive moments. Destiny is a great example of a game that has both. If i'm grinding strikes, I'm playing the same strikes for the 50th+ time. I don't need to hear the same dialogue again and the ambiance is stale after doing it so many times. So why not do it while watching a sporting event im not super into? Or maybe a reality TV show like Kitchen Nightmares? Gordon is entertaining but a lot of those episodes involve rehashing the same points and mostly the content is auditory. But I'll also watch youtube videos that are more like podcasts with video content backgrounds. When a subject matter is being discussed but the video feed is either unrelated or simply supplementary rather than necessary. 

Another example of a game good for this is NBA 2k. I like playing the game. The actual moment to moment gameplay is fun and soothing for me. But i don't need to hear the cpu announcers regurgitate the same lines of dialogue ive heard a million times. I don't need to hear the fake crowd or the broadcast sounds. 2k is fun, but it's not mentally engaging, making it a great game to play while watching/listening to other content. Also great because it's easy to pause and turn all my focus on the 2nd screen if i feel like i need to in the moment. Rocket league is also fun, but harder because you can't pause when playing online. 

So, it ultimately depends on the game/show. Multitasking the two together doesn't mean they aren't worthwhile games or shows. Sometimes they offer us certain things we like but are lacking in other areas."
