Okay, I get that, but still, if one makes the effort to register to vote, one should maintain the validity to vote. That is, if the Right to vote is as important as it should be.

I'd like to see the agencies that drive voter registration maintain that commitment to keep those they register qualified to vote, just registering is half an effort. Plus, those same agencies should facilitate voting for those who need help by providing rides and mail-in ballots, they know who needs help.
Just registering large numbers of voters is worthless if those people can't vote."
