analog,fe48rkx,t1_fe45cy6,1578856877.0,I used the meter in the camera. I typically always shoot with an aperture of 1.8. And thank you!
iPhonePhotography,fe25dar,t3_en1rs3,1578834681.0,Which phone are you using? I started using a little tripod.
Polaroid,fdzrcxt,t1_fdzra0i,1578794011.0,Me too! It’s so sad. I hope you are ok too.
Polaroid,fdzptt7,t3_enca4q,1578793053.0,"Sorry for your loss! I had to say goodbye to my dog, Maverick this morning. :("
dogs,fdwdssm,t1_fdwd1zb,1578757659.0,"I am glad I did it. I realized just how much pain he was in once he was sleeping. He didn’t need to live through that pain, I’m glad he can finally rest. I will miss him and be crying for a long time but this was what was best."
dogs,fdvwa9b,t1_fdvvxhl,1578752370.0,I scheduled appointment to put him down this morning. Ultimately I think it is the best thing. He is more unhappy then happy. Thank you for your comment. This is a heartbreaking choice but I don’t want him to suffer.
dogs,fduxea4,t3_emnqy7,1578740494.0,"My dog’s name is Maverick. I call him Mr. Maverick, Mav, and Mavypoo"
dogs,fduk6vn,t3_en514d,1578734186.0,"I am going through a very similar situation at this very moment. I took my dog to the vet last night as an emergency because he wasn’t using his back legs at all. The advice the vet gave me was that if your dog is not enjoying life anymore it is time. I’m so sorry you are going through this, it is really tough. I can only speak from my experience, but my dog can go through periods of walking (I just got through a short, slow, walk with him) but he is no longer wagging his tail, smiling, and energetic to see me. For me, that is the indicator, he isn’t happy or comfortable. That’s just been my experience, I hope it helps."
Polaroid,fdp5xzn,t1_fdgrvu7,1578620765.0,"I’m new to using Polaroid and I’m sure I’m about to ask a dumb question. When you say store it inside your jacket or armpit, is it ok for the photo side to touch stuff as it is developing? Or does it have to remain untouched?"
dogs,fde6zrb,t1_fdd5l1s,1578332557.0,"Oh , I also forgot to mention he is falling asleep standing up or sitting. I think he is tired.  I could get a dog walker during the day."
dogs,fddnctm,t1_fddhngr,1578318573.0,I think I will ask about anxiety medication. The vet is supposed to call me at the end of the week to check in. Their next recommendation is a dog neurologist and I’m not sure I want to put him through all that.
dogs,fdd5o6q,t1_fdd5l1s,1578295885.0,"That could be. I will say though, when I sit him on the couch on the weekends/evenings it does take him a long time to lay down. He does have some mobility issues."
dogs,fdd5hxd,t1_fdd59qs,1578295674.0,"I work during the week so I’m not sure what he does. When I am home on weekends, he does lay on the couch (I pick him up and put him there) and he will sleep for a couple hours at a time. He is pretty anxious, so if I get up off the couch so will he."
dogs,fdd4zie,t1_fdd4xll,1578295035.0,I forgot to mention he is on CBD oil too. He has been for about a month. I haven’t seen a change.
PokemonLetsGo,fcw0wum,t3_ej6kwu,1578014586.0,How many did you have to catch to get that?
frederickmd,fcg2i8i,t1_fcg2by9,1577635915.0,Thank you!
reddeadredemption,fc74xnn,t1_fc67k9r,1577497639.0,This! I spent the whole time yelling “woo! Fire lady!”
PokemonLetsGo,fbdady7,t3_ecqla7,1576754883.0,Congrats! I only need a Machamp and then I’ll be shiny hunting too!
