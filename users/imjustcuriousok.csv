IdiotsInCars,ff1z9al,t1_ff1se5r,1579489644.0,For me it's a history of constantly being ripped off and lied to by mechanics. I'm just afraid to go to an auto shop now since I clearly can't trust them. Though I won't fuck around with oil etc. I'll just fill my tires myself and have my husband check my brakes and all that. It sucks that the shady mechanics ruin it for the good ones.

IdiotsInCars,fene47n,t1_fem5alx,1579282728.0,It's legal in Hawaii for sure. People keep folding chairs in the beds of their truck and passengers just sit in them. I've seen company trucks even have workers in the back.

BabyBumps,fej0n1o,t1_feir0dg,1579152689.0,"Honestly I'd just assume he's distracted/overwhelmed by the other kids and is maybe ""over"" this pregnancy, like it isn't as exciting as the others since he's been through it before? That's not a good excuse of course, I'm sorry you're experiencing this 😞 have you told him how his actions are making you feel? I'd be upset too, hope he changes his ways soon."
BabyBumps,fehf3qq,t1_fehc4yw,1579115238.0,"YES. I know a girl who had twins, one boy is named after the father (third of the name) and the other was just given a name. How horrible is that?? This kid already has a connection the other twin will never have. Sibling and twins are already competitive, why make things even worse by giving one a special name and one a name from a movie?"
thesims,fehcxju,t1_fegm7c2,1579113980.0,"If they had put the sink where the barstools are on the peninsula (or on an island but where the barstools normally go), the triangle would have been disturbed. Or if the peninsula would have come into the kitchen more, it would make it difficult to reach the sink therefore ruining the triangle. I think the reason for the confusion is that it would be *so* inefficient to design a kitchen in which the triangle/line is disturbed so we would never think to do it."
thesims,feh99y1,t1_feh8x16,1579111803.0,Hey nothing wrong with knowing your own limits! You might even learn new words by avoiding it lol nothing wrong with that

IdiotsInCars,fefzb0r,t1_feblq9q,1579070386.0,"Since you haven't really gotten a serious answer, here are my thoughts: I've seen people suggest putting your floor mats under the tire that can't get traction. I've never tried this, I think it'd be a total mess (mud/ice) and have never had to resort to that. Whenever I've been in a car that gets stuck like this there's two people, one to hit the gas gently and one to push/rock the car out. If I was alone, I'd try to shovel out the front so if I do get out, it's a clear shot back onto the road. Then maybe pack some snow under the back tires and try to rock the car a bit and get out. Maybe put it in reverse if all else fails and see if I can reverse out somehow. That might make the rut bigger so I'd try to avoid it. 

The one time I absolutely *couldn't* get out of a snowbank I had to call my stepdad on his farm and he drove a tractor over to lift my car out of the drift. We get a *lot* of snow where I'm from though, it was a 3-5 foot drift I was stuck in and no way out."

Or you can skip cheats and go through the edit households option (the little people icon on the top right of the upper menu) on the neighborhood view page but you won't be able to change a lot of things, I think including bone structure, name, physique, etc."

BabyBumps,fdg9rrz,t1_fdg0h1b,1578386204.0,This happened to my SIL! She went in after giving birth to get her tubes tied and found out she was pregnant again. Had the second baby on the first baby's birthday! So I think that would mean she got pregnant around 3 months after giving birth.

You can opt out if you want though. I think if you hit the ""add a character"" button in CAS there's an option, similar to occult where it pops up from the icon, that says you can take the quiz."
