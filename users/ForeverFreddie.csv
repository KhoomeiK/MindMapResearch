SmashBrosUltimate,fejx42e,t3_epklq1,1579187852.0,"The Smash community is viewed as toxic because of rampant sexism, misogyny, elitism, and its inability to allow other players to have fun with a video game."
SmashBrosUltimate,fejwkyf,t1_fejsb0i,1579187506.0,"Sakurai was personally asked by the company to handle development. Pretty sure a list was produced and Sakurai and the team at Sora picked who they felt would fit their philosophy of “fun and interesting” characters. Nintendo clearly agreed, but has decided to include another 6 fighters due to the games massive popularity and attachment rate to the title. Nintendo is very hands off with Smash because of Sakurai’s ability and track record. The man pretty much fanboyed with a lot of these fighters in DLC pack 1. So 🤷🏻‍♂️ six more are coming, even if they have already been decided I’m interested to see in who they chose. Sakurai doesn’t give a flying fuck about audience perception and only cares about the games quality and ability to create fun experiences for its players."
SmashBrosUltimate,fejs4ll,t1_fejrucf,1579184494.0,"No it’s not. Sora Ltd. is it’s own company. Nintendo lets Sakurai have whatever he wants because of his track record, pretty sure the approval process for this character was, oh no royalty fees? Count us in, especially since more fighters are planned."
SmashBrosUltimate,fejrseh,t1_fejr2ld,1579184243.0,You mean fuck you Sora Limited. Nintendo has little say in who Sakurai chooses.
worldpolitics,feja5qg,t3_epghcp,1579163700.0,Good for her for wanting to be involved in the affairs of her country as is her right.
BabyCorgis,fej4om5,t3_epfca0,1579156786.0,We do not deserve to live in a world with such adorable creatures. 😍😍😍😍
rupaulsdragrace,feguy1x,t1_fegunl4,1579103106.0,"Facebook owns Instagram, so you are still giving him that sweet ad revenue."
PS4,fecbekk,t1_fecajk7,1578970108.0,You’ll still get them right before or soon after E3. PS5 is set to launch this holiday.
PS4,fecag5v,t3_eoev0z,1578969567.0,"E3 has not been relevant for console makers in years, so I’m not surprised. They will have a streamed PlayStation event, just like Nintendo does with its Directs. Why share the spotlight when you can choose a date of your liking and have the press all over you and only you."
RPDRDRAMA,fe4kota,t1_fe4hwrq,1578860331.0,"I draw the line at people suggesting others to harm themselves, that is what compelled me to engage. That kind of language can be dangerous and be the impetus for someone to self harm. The only point I’ve been trying to make here is that that kind of language is not cool. It’s the same language that Tyra is chastised for and if you’re going to do that then how about you try to not use it and be better than the behaviors you dislike and criticize. 

I don’t have anything productive to say on the other subjects being discussed so I won’t engage with them. However, this is different to me and I did. 

You don’t have to agree with anything anyone says, that’s your right and privilege, but no need to suggest self harm even if you don’t believe you meant it in a serious manner."
RPDRDRAMA,fe4hoat,t1_fe4f0ov,1578859437.0,"Be better. 

It’s never ok to suggest someone to harm themselves. 

Have a nice day."
RPDRDRAMA,fe4doo0,t1_fe4cju6,1578858182.0,"How about you just don’t use language like that in the first place, because that excuse is a stretch.  Be better. 

Your political beliefs don’t give you a pass to suggest suicide/harm to another."
RPDRDRAMA,fe4bebc,t1_fe4023h,1578857567.0,"This is pretty hypocritical of you. Tyra does it, and it’s not cool and an outrage, yet here you are telling this random person to commit suicide/harm themselves. 

Just no. Be better."
NintendoSwitch,fdtwo9x,t1_fdtwfsh,1578723429.0,Thank you. :)

rupaulsdragrace,fdqrz5g,t3_ems7j5,1578673609.0,This album has to be the weakest out of all his recent albums. His work after he stopped working with Lucian has been pretty hit or miss and this one is a big miss for me.
depression,fdj6k61,t3_elo0vr,1578459863.0,"Getting help doesn’t make you weak. That idea is ridiculous, archaic, and needs to die. If you had cancer or any other illness would you just sit there and deal with it on your own or would you go get help so you can live and not die? The answer always is get help, and take care of yourself. Everyone else be damned. Getting help shows a level of maturity and strength that is unparalleled, and if no one else can see that they can fuck off.  Get help, take care of yourself."
