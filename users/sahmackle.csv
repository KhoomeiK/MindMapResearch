news,fexj1cd,t1_fexh6es,1579431790.0,"I feel is because it's easy to dehumanize people in these situation and to decide for them that they aren't capable of making wise decisions. It feels like a ""don't feed the birds"" sign in the park to stop them being fed inappropriate food so they don't get harmed and so not to attract further flocks of extra birds to the region.  
  
Whereas that person on half a mil a year, definitely capable of gif choices if they've gotten themselves a job earning that much."

Then he would start digging out a path from the street to their front door. Where snow ploughs  hopefully kept the street clear enough for then to go about their day."
funny,feteqdp,t1_fesypt7,1579374671.0,"That's one way to pad out the number of hours to do a job.  
  
Boss: Can you please explain why it took you four and a half hours to swap a breaker in the switchboard? It should have taken a hour and a half, tops.  
  
u/OurHeroXero : well you see boss, I kind of had a few technical issues...

worldnews,fdi3jkk,t1_fdgtgkp,1578435100.0,"There's also pride. They are toeing the lounge and continuing previous policy, rightly or wrongly..none of them want to be the one to do a total backflip on what they've been saying for nearly a decade or more.  
  
Plus Scott Morrison is Pentecostal Christian. So there's the potential for him bringing the belief of ""this is God's will, I am but a man, whom an I to question and try to change what he is doing to the world"" into government.  America got rid of mixing church and state and got a megalomaniac, as usual were fifteen years behind them so are firmly getting caught up in the God in government thing."
videos,fdevzzh,t1_fde7fvj,1578347756.0,"This is exactly the way I opened my front door when I left my keys in the house and went to go out.   
  
Instead of an oj container I had to use the curved bottom/side of a plastic ice-cream tub because the plastic was curved enough naturally to make the tight radius around the door and steel frame and strong enough to push the latch in once I pre loaded the door by pulling on the handle to relieve any friction holding the latch in place.  
  
Not a fun day, this happened while on the way out the door to my grandfather's funeral, so I'm a bit amazed I even had the presence of mind to figure this out. It was probably also why I left my keys inside in the first place. It was years ago, so I'm good now.  
  
I also used it years later on another front door when the pins froze up inside the lock and the key barrel wouldn't turn. Saved myself a chunk of money to call out a locksmith as it was on a weekend."
