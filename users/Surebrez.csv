JurassicPark,fcn2wei,t3_ehvqoh,1577801759.0,Great idea. Kind of reminds me of SimCopter where you were able to import cities created in SimCity 2000. That was a lot of fun.
linux4noobs,fcmsk7u,t1_fcmnvca,1577790174.0,"I wish I could upvote you twice. It's just the same with so many things in IT. People find an IDE they like, find out about minimalistic desktop setups with mechanical keyboards or get hyped with Linux or Apple or whatever and suddenly their thing is the best for everybody. Different problems and different people require different solutions. Don't get hung up on your ideas.

BTW: I have a dual boot setup as well. I like Manjaro a lot more then windows 10, but I also like to play The Sims from time to time. Also, my wife uses the laptop and she doesn't care for learning about Linux. So there you have it. Two different people using the same computer on totally different operating systems. And everybody's happy."
