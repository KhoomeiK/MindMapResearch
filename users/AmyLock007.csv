There is a lot to this story, and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll do it justice, but here goes: 

So for context it‚Äôs important to note that this story is told from the author, Angela Stanton‚Äôs perspective and her grievances with Phaedra. 

To start Angela documents how she was molested by her cousin when she was 5 years old. After telling her family, no action was taken for the sake of ‚Äúkinship.‚Äù This leads to resentment and distrust which the author feels leads her to trouble life. 

Angela meets Phaedra through an at the time boyfriend, who Phaedra was representing. Phaedra and Angela form a friendship that somewhat quickly evolves into a business relationship. Initially the author was executing fraudulent business checks and fake identities. As the scheme evolved Angela was introduced to Apollo and E, Apollo‚Äôs brother. They started casing luxury cars, creating fictitious registrations and titles and stealing the vehicles which would then have the vin scrubbed off. Throughout this, Phaedra made a verbal pact with Angela that phaedra would not only represent Angela should anything come up, but would leverage her ‚Äúsecret society of attorneys and judges, and it would all be ok.‚Äù 

Eventually Angela is arrested and sent to prison where she gives birth to her fifth child, and Phaedra is elusive at best. Angela ends up being sentenced for five years. While in prison, her mother and grandmother die. Once she is released she tries to get a hold of Phaedra to little avail and within 3 days she is arrested again on related but separate charges of conspiracy and is facing 5 additional years. Angela finally gets a hold of Phaedra, who agrees to represent her. Fast forward to trial and Phaedra refuses herself due to conflict of interest. Angela is assigned a court appointed attorney who has two weeks to prepare. During this time between imprisonment and trial, was out on pre-trail bond and had been able to prove herself through as a rehabilitated, contributor to society and was given 3 years supervised release. It‚Äôs important to note that in this conspiracy case, her trial was at the same time as E‚Äôs (Apollo‚Äôs brother - conflict of interest). 

Angela goes onto release a book life behind these walls which documented women‚Äôs stories from while she was in prison. A little while later, Angela sees Phaedra on rhoa with Apollo who she assumes Phaedra only married initially so he couldn‚Äôt testify against her and E. This infuriated Angela as she realized that Phaedra hadn‚Äôt distanced herself from everyone involved, only Angela. While Angela was calling Phaedra from a homeless with her kids asking for help and being met with refusal, she was picking E up in a Bentley from a halfway house. She tried to make a civil compliant but no attorney would take the case citing statues of limitations. Angela states she wrote this book for justice so other young vulnerable girls might spot an opportunistic snake when they are met with one. 

A few things my summary doesn‚Äôt capture that in my opinion are relevant are: 

- The author‚Äôs role as a mother and her children‚Äôs story. There were grave emotional and physical impacts as consequences which are documented that very much relate to the overall story, including Phaedra‚Äôs part 
- In my opinion, the author really tries to convey the imbalance of the justice system when you‚Äôre in a position of poverty. Hence, in my opinion, Phaedra leveraging Angela in these tasks. Angela was seen as a throwaway. No one society would ever care about and thus the fall person without any regard for their friendship, shared promises, Angela‚Äôs children one of which Phaedra was the godmother too
- Many rap artists and those connected in the southern rap circle of the 90‚Äôs and 00‚Äôs are mentioned. Some notables are mystikal and young Jeezy."

The night she passed, my uncle decided not to call that particular cousin or the rest of his children until the following morning.

For now, we have the year to save but given the demands of raising a family and other obligations would like to keep it around $6k - $8k. For US travel, we would probably like to do 7 days. For international travel, we would probably like to spend about 10 or so days. We plan to travel as a family of four, two of which being children. Our kids are 12 and 8, both pretty active. As a family, we love being outdoors and spend a lot of time on hikes or trails. In regards to traveling light, I would probably fail at that as I imagine we would have one checked bag per person.
