My friend Pete has a weird hobby revolving around the tube..

He holds the world record for this as far as I know  (or he was part of the planning of the record).

His hobby is to visit every tube stop in as short a time as possible.

They plan the route meticulously including backup strategies.

They ran the world record on a day when there was an intentional delay because it worked out faster (this is all vague memories from him telling me.

It's nuts. If im in london and want to know how to get somewhere he can literally say stuff like; get on the tube at 8:02 in Euston and travel for x mins ...


etc.

nuts.


Edit; here is the blurb;

Londonist film maker Geoff Marshall has regained the Guinness World Record for visiting every tube station in the shortest time. Geoff and a group of friends passed through all 270 stations in 16 hours, 20 minutes and 27 seconds, breaking the previous world record by around 9 minutes.

she sent me to school but i never fitted in. Suspended for ramming. I wanted to be the dominant bull but it never worked.

Eventually i found my calling and at 7 years old my passion for art came out.

I drew a picture and and was so proud. I took it home to mother. she said 'thats great, son' and pinned it on the fridge.
