>Police arrested 10 people yesterday after discovering **powerful explosives** the suspects were allegedly plotting to set off to cause **mayhem and bloodshed** during this week's Legislative Council debate on electoral reform.

>The explosive seized in the raids was triacetone triperoxide - also known as **TATP - which has been used in deadly terrorist attacks around the world**

>[Chief Superintendent] Au said a small quantity of TATP was powerful enough to blow a car to pieces.

[Actual conviction] (https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/2120405/hong-kong-pro-independence-pair-found-guilty-making) (November 2017)

>Court heard the duo made smokes bombs in bid to create chaos during 2015 election reform vote

>In mitigation, defence counsel John Haynes, for Pennelli, said **police had exaggerated the case in the beginning by saying an explosive substance had been involved. He said the smoke bombs did not pose a danger to life nor were able to damage property, noting they could have been used in war games in other countries.**

Their press releases are horseshit.

mostly this sub is about listening, and not about 'advice', but there's one thing that sprang to mind that helped me a lot, and that i'd like to share with you

>If you expect rejection, you tend to hide, avoid, stay silent, and be hesitant.
Other people may interpret your behavior as a lack of interest on your part, or to
the fact that you are “different” or weird.
If you expect to be liked, you will be outgoing, friendly, willing to take the
initiative, and willing to talk and be open. As a result of the way you act,
other people see you as a nice, friendly person.
The negative cycle you are in may have convinced you there is something
wrong with YOU. That is not true. The only thing you may be doing wrong
is viewing yourself and the world inaccurately.

>Here’s another profound statement: “What you give out – comes back.”
This is not meant to be new age, philosophical, or eastern mysticism. It is a
rational statement, grounded in common sense. “What you give out – comes
back.” Let me explain.
If you are hesitant and indecisive around other people, they will react to your
indecision and be hesitant with you, too. They sense there’s something unusual
about your actions, but they don’t know exactly what it is, so they are reluctant
to get too involved with you.
They can’t see you have social anxiety – they just see you’re hesitant and
tentative.
Because of social anxiety, you censor yourself and give out indecision and
hesitancy.
You’re tentative and not quite sure what to say or how to act. Others respond to
you by being hesitant and tentative in return. They can’t see you have social
anxiety, so they are reacting to the way you act.
What you “give out” to other people, comes back to you.
If you are too quiet, others may feel uncomfortable around you. Your silence
makes you stand out from the crowd and you’re viewed as “different,” “timid,”
or “too reserved.”
People usually feel more comfortable around others like themselves because it
takes the guesswork out of social situations. Being quiet and timid doesn’t help
us make friends and influence other people.
If we hide from life and avoid social interaction, others will see us as unfriendly,
“reticent” and as a loner.
People do not react negatively to us as individuals, they are reacting to the
way we act or behave. We act the way we do because of our beliefs and
feelings: in the way we have been “conditioned” to believe in the past

it's from a social anxiety course i did that helped me a lot, so some of it might not be relevant to you

but i'm guessing you've had a lot of experiences that have caused you to expect rejection, and you probably view yourself in those terms. but it's likely that you're not distinguishing between 'you', and your behaviour.

when you say 'i'm annoying', i'm not going to tell you that you're not annoying. i mean i could argue that point; annoying to who? to *everyone*? how do you know? but mostly, I'd point to the idea, maybe it's your behaviour, not *YOU*. maybe you're 'awkward', around people, because you don't feel secure. and you're taking that as if there's something fundamentally wrong with you as a person, when really you've just had a bad start."

i'm glad you felt you could open up here, and agree with the other post; opening up with your therapist might help to.

i'm sorry for everything you've been through and that you feel so lacking in control. i hope you feel free to post more here if you find it helpful."

I'm sorry about your brother. and I mean everything else, but especially that =(

I can't imagine what that's like. did you speak to anyone about it?"
SuicideWatch,fd1kevk,t3_ejupw0,1578132471.0,">Yesterday, I was laying in bed, listening to the muffled sounds of my roommate fucking my ex through my apartment’s paper thin walls

Jeez, this sounds like  a shitty situation for anyone, never mind everything else

I'm glad music gave you some release

I found your soundcloud on your profile and I'm listening now

Do you like The Mountain Goats? I could imagine your voice suiting it"
SuicideWatch,fd1jtj4,t3_ejut1m,1578132232.0,"Can you tell us more about how you feel, and why you feel this way?"
SuicideWatch,fd1jggy,t3_ejryog,1578132078.0,"I'm sorry you went through that

I know it's hard when you don't feel in control of your situation and feel helpless to change it

one thing I'd say is, sometimes when people are feeling suicidal they want to kill themselves as a way of punishing those they blame, but no one would be 'punished' more than you

I hope you have some time and space to free yourself of your current situation, and feel a bit better"
