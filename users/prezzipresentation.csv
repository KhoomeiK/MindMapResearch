AskReddit,femcpc7,t3_epk5tm,1579248831.0,"I never really imagine the place with specific details, just more of colors. So when I imagine this bar, I'm seeing a dark blue, close to purple, color as the background and some dark figures that lightly represent people. The one thing that does have some sort of real shape to it is the doorway which is just a normal dark wooden frame wide enough for one, and the ""characters"" that are part of the joke. And some sparkles for whatever reason."
AskReddit,fem8q91,t3_epp36x,1579243876.0,Tons and tons of washi tape and stickers and pens. My bullet journal will look amazing:)))

Journaling,fdmg4cn,t1_fdmfcme,1578548752.0,"That's really interesting. The most I've done in terms of taking notes while reading is highlighting words that I'm not familiar with. Save the homework assignments that require annotations, of course. I might try that out and incorporate into the final product"
Journaling,fdme6w2,t1_fdmdgtl,1578546998.0,"The way I like to do it is begin only once I've finished the book, and it serves as a reflection and how the characters in the book or the story in its entirety affects me. I also like to ask questions I have about certain aspects/ details of the book. And I also promised myself that I would not write the title until I actually finish the book, because I can get ambitious and then write down tasks before even premeditating  the time I have for them :P"
bujo,fdm91h9,t3_elwob9,1578542827.0,"I like to use my monthly calendar to write down important due dates. I have a separate planner where I write day to day hw assignments, but it doesn't come with a monthly lay out so that's how I've come to use my bujo. Hope this helps :)"

TooAfraidToAsk,fcthl2w,t3_eisqt8,1577943530.0,"As someone who turned 18 not too long ago, I'll have you know that it's the exact same as being 17, except that you can get into real trouble now, vote, get a tattoo by yourself, go to a rated r movie without an adult because you are the adult, and some other stuff. And life will continue just the same; with big changes and small, good moments and bad, and new opportunities. Follow your own path and dreams, and good things will come."

AskReddit,fc16lok,t3_efe5rt,1577309731.0,My boyfriend got me a bunch of supplies and a new journal since I love bullet journaling. First time I've been genuinely excited during Christmas since I was 12.
bulletjournal,fc128ve,t1_fc11htg,1577306179.0,"That is amazing. My old journal would do the same, it was so annoying."
bulletjournal,fc114v2,t1_fc103qf,1577305274.0,"That's beautiful, and I'm sorry about their passing. And I'm amazed with the paper. Before I was working with a cheap bookstore journal I found earlier this year, so to me it's a huge upgrade. The fact that I can layer my tombows ontop of eachother and see the paper still intact is soo cool to see. And I might start using watercolors a bit later, but for now I'm too nervous to mess it up lol"

bulletjournal,fc01cam,t1_fc00idj,1577273399.0,"I genuinely love it, but that's considering that it's my first ""high quality"" journal I've ever owned. The paper is extremely smooth, but there is some ghosting when it comes to using tombows and such"
bulletjournal,fbzw0g0,t1_fbzutme,1577264615.0,It really is. I got the grid layout to try it out and I'm really liking it. Did you just go with the traditional dot grid?
