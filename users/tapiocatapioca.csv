How you don’t recognize this is beyond me. We’ve also seen national firearms registries and stronger gun laws work out just fine in other nations. It’s funny how no one knows what they’re talking about except you and the other people who deepthroat the muzzle of their guns, right? 

Where is the threshold for “having an idea of what I’m talking about?” By the way, great support for that argument. No shit criminals don’t follow the law. That’s why they should make it more difficult for people who shouldn’t have them to get them. One way is to require background checks on all sales. You’re making an appeal to perfection. You’re also essentially talking about a slippery slope, too. Tighten up.

We don’t make laws based on the fact that some people will break them. The entire basis of a legal system is mitigation and penalization. I’m so sick and tired of this fucking talking point. There are laws preventing murder and rape, yet people break them every day. So are we just gonna say fuck it and do away with any sense of a legal system? No. Because that’s not how a civilized society functions.

Read comments in full next time. I didn’t say I wanted guns off the streets because... wait for it... I don’t. I grew up with them. Damn near everyone in my family, both immediate and extended, owns at least one. Did they get rid of cars because it’s required for you to prove you’re not a danger to others before you get a license? If so, that’s news to me. 

What I do want are measures to prevent a felon, terrorist, or domestic abuser from driving to pick up a shotgun an hour after seeing a posting. Not a fucking controversial opinion. If you don’t like living in a place with a legal system, go live in a shack like the Unabomber. As long as you don’t blow or shoot anything up, no one will bother you. 

And yes, the government is going to become a tyranny because certain people won’t be able to buy a fucking secondhand gun without a background check. You’re spot on. The 300 million+ guns already in the states are obsolete after the government forces a potential buyer to go through a rudimentary system to make sure they don’t have a history of violence or violent crimes.

Libertarian,fcmq0xp,t1_fcmicqv,1577786539.0,"I’m not suggesting making guns illegal. That will never happen in this country and that is not what I would personally want anyway. I love guns and I always will. I went shooting less than a week ago. I’m suggesting more stringent gun laws. With the most notable being universal background checks on primary and secondary gun sales. There are several states, including mine, where you do not even need a bill of sale on secondary firearm sales, let alone a background check.

I purchased my first gun through an online ad, met the guy, and was leaving within the night. Overall the entire ordeal took less than four hours from me finding the listing to me walking back in the door of my home. A bill of sale is not required, so there would’ve been no record of the sale at all if I were not set on the seller signing one to provide his information. Even with the bill of sale, a personally printed out piece of paper, I or the seller could’ve lied when filling it out. Even further, the paper is not required to be held onto, as it isn’t required in the first place.

Do you want to know what the seller knew of me? Nothing. Not a thing. He knew the name I told him and the number I used communicating with him. There wouldn’t have been any capture of the exchange either, as he wanted me to come to his house to buy it (fuck no), so I insisted on meeting in a Cabelas lot (cameras). So a Mossberg AR (MMR for those who can’t connect the dots) switched hands without anyone but the two of us knowing. *He had no way of knowing my experience with guns. He had no way of knowing my intentions. He had no way of knowing whether or not I had a record, and vice versa.*

This evil piece of shit in Texas, who just took two innocent lives, could’ve done the exact same thing I did as there are no laws in TX concerning background checks on sales if you’re not a licensed seller. The person who sold it to him could’ve had no idea he was selling a gun to someone who planned to kill innocent people. He, a felon, could purchase a gun that simply. That is an illegally purchased gun without a single preventative barrier. Criminals don’t care about the law; no shit. Well how about preventing some of them from circumventing it with less effort than it takes to buy a couch? How about we stop oversimplifying the issue and treating people as if they’re too fucking stupid to understand that “criminals don’t care about the law” every time measures are suggested to nix one avenue they can use? How about we stop with the bullshit, condescending tones whenever gun control is brought up because we think that we are the only one with experience in owning guns?

This is the shit that most people want. Closing lax laws and regulations like this. Not being able to purchase guns at a goddamn Walmart an aisle away from Power Rangers is what most people want. The people fighting for the complete abolition of firearms are the minority of those fighting for stronger gun laws. I am a progressive and have, and will continue to, vote democrat in elections. I am what most people on this sub would probably consider a “bleeding heart liberal.” I don’t want guns to be wiped from the streets. I don’t know a single person in my pool of liberal friends who does. It’s not feasible and it isn’t going to happen without a constitutional amendment, which we will never see. I have friends working in notable positions in DC within the Democratic Party who feel the exact same way that I do. 

But whenever there is even an inkling about enacting legislation to make it more difficult for someone to purchase or obtain a gun that shouldn’t have one in the first place, people come out of the woodwork saying that anything preventing anyone from buying a gun is “an attack against the second amendment.” There are people that shouldn’t have guns. Period. Most of us agree on this uncontroversial opinion. So why the fuck is it so difficult for so many people to wrap their heads around the fact that this is better accomplished when there is a more in-depth process. Why do people lose their minds when lawmakers try to enact legislation making it more difficult to buy something specifically made with the capability to kill than texting a seller and driving to meet them. Why can’t people grow up and have a conversation about an issue without talking down on others as if they’re a toddler, acting like they’re the only ones who know what the surrounding concerns are?

We’re talking about Texas. There are plenty of Hispanics that have weapons, just like there are plenty of white gun owners.

I am sure you are aware of the alternative to TARP.

We are due for another contraction given the average business cycle. The Fed’s actions in 2018 and 2019 have nothing to do with him. I don’t mean to be rude, but I don’t think you fully understand how monetary policy works. Where are these “billions of dollars going to the banks?” Are you referring to the Fed adjusting the rates? Because that is not them giving money to banks. The Fed meets their target rate by adjusting the amount of money in the economy. If you don’t like their current policy, that is a different topic. But trying to characterize it as anything other than what it is, adjusting the rates, is either disingenuous, misinformed, or both."

worldnews,fc7q27n,t1_fc7a9oa,1577515694.0,Every single president makes money off of writing books and doing speeches so don’t act like him having money is corruption.

Edit: downvote me for saying it’s ridiculous how straightforward questions get pummeled. Been here for three years and it’s gotten worse. Proves my point."

PeopleFuckingDying,fc41u9u,t1_fc3r582,1577404411.0,I feel like there is a template in this but I don’t have the know how.
trashy,fc41422,t1_fc3xmd1,1577403869.0,A thousand dollars is a thousand dollars. Grow up. You act like people don’t value money the same because they have more of it and it makes you look out of touch.

news,fbzd6ii,t1_fbz83gl,1577242785.0,"Respectfully disagree. I feel that is a poor analogy. If you cannot criticize another party’s (nation’s) evil because there has been injustice in your own, there would be no one to stand up. Everyone has history. That does not mean you cannot acknowledge the atrocities going on elsewhere. Would it be fair to suggest that the Swiss cannot be appalled by the human rights violations in North Korea because they watched over Nazi gold? I don’t think so."
