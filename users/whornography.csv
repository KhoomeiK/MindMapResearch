science,fexthv7,t3_eqtnrk,1579435787.0,"This is anecdotal and may get deleted, but in the cases of two of my friends, they were both at peace with having had an abortion until they decided they wanted to have kids and got pregnant. Then the feelings of ""what could have been"" with their aborted child became overwhelming.

Years later after having children, it's a topic that occasionally comes up during some of our more meaningful chats. Considering the emotion they both exhibit when discussing their experience, I very much doubt they would opt into a research study to tell a stranger about it."

The most recent Epstein release said he was going after 11 year olds. If they had all the evidence, I bet that number would go down even further."

movies,fek0dua,t1_fejxu5j,1579189911.0,"There are plenty of depictions of strong feminine characters in movies. The horror genre, in particular, is filled with them. 

This modern push for strong female characters in Hollywood seems to miss the point. We're not a replacement for men, and our identity isn't formed around trying to be better than our male counterparts. Hollywood lately has just been like, ""Let's make her catty, insecure, and a slut. Really capture the female essence."""
movies,fejt1dy,t1_fejrxff,1579185145.0,"If this came about organically and not on the heels of sociopolitical outcry, I would love it. But now Hollywood ""inclusiveness"" feels like pandering. 

And I'm left wondering how much being a black female will define the character. Will she have an inferiority complex and try to prove she's ""just as good as any white man"", or will they actually try to do the character justice and show how her culture impacts the role?"

I'm not saying THC use at a young age isn't a problem, but I feel it's more likely the result of an underlying problem and leads to a lot of people misattributing negative occurances with THC use, rather than their actual antecedents (i.e. poverty, abuse, undiagnosed mental health issues, etc)."
aww,fcopgur,t1_fcomp1u,1577838106.0,"I in no way meant that to be personally directed at you. Neither did the original poster of this thread. 

I've never heard of ""walks and talks"", but I'm sure several people walk while they talk. 

I'm not trying to imply anything about you at all, but having grown up dealing with people in my life with pronounced ADHD, I can say that the near-constant motion and rambling speaking is unsettling FOR ME. And I have to assume it isn't easy to live with your thinking always like that, though to be fair, a person with ADHD likely doesn't know what being relaxed and chill is like, so there's no basis for comparison. 

Again, this wasn't about you directly, just trying to make it clear why interacting with someone with uncontrolled ADHD is tiring for some non-ADHD people. But maybe you can ask your friends what their experiences with you have been like, if you feel concerned by what I said?"

science,fcjvzo6,t1_fcjo96n,1577707428.0,"I think one of the big differences is that men are expected to leave their comforts and build their own independent life (find a wife, possibly protect their nation, start and provide for a family, have a meaningful career, leave a legacy). Women are, societally, seen more as protected property and expected to handle more of a support role (which I hate and personally find to be bullshit). 

Societally, learning makeup and which of your friends is a gossip doesn't compare to the issues men face... particularly the ones who internalize that idea."
