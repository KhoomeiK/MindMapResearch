Direct replacement as in you don't have to reengineer the process itself (i.e. Burn fuel to release heat, or fill a tank at a refuelling station and continue driving).

Storage and transportation are definitely hurdles to overcome, but they are engineering challenges that I firmly believe can be solved.

You have the right of it with regard to H2's efficiency, especially relative to renewables connected directly to the grid. But renewables are inherently intermittent, so we need something to provide for base load. There are a lot of really great ideas and technologies out there that can store surplus wind/solar energy, but none of them can simultaneously provide base load generation, replace fossil fuels in jet fuel and industrial heating, and fill in with existing transportation networks (namely, refuelling stations that could be retrofitted to dispense H2 instead of gasoline). I know it's more complicated than simply switching the fuel source, but an economy based on H2 has a lot of infrastructure and process overlap with an economy based on fossil fuels. My understanding is that the process of decarbonizing with Hydrogen would be much more straightforward and easier to stomach for the general population than total global electrification."

Of course, residential activities will require full electrification due to the invisible and volatile nature of H2; but industrial heating, jet fuel (ATF), and base-load electrical generation (and many other fossil fuel roles) can be completely replaced with Hydrogen.
