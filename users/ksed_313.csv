I’m very sure to tell all parents this at open house/the first day, but I’m still asked upwards of 150 times during the first few weeks by students to tie their shoes. My response? “Nope.

The school I teach at does well with providing families in need with food through food bank services that drop off directly to our school. But we teachers are mandated reporters. We can be kicked out of our careers for not contacting CPS for instances that call for it. So when we see hungry students, we reach out to families and work with them. In most cases, the issue goes away, and we don’t need to call. Schools need to do more, but are limited on resources. My school is an independent public charter school, so it easier for us to address and meet our families’ needs as opposed to a traditional public school districts."

ThatsInsane,felvrsc,t1_fek3ov4,1579232160.0,"I did pointe. I can confirm that I never once put 100% of my weight solely on my toes. There’s so much more to what goes into pointe than that. It’s core, back, leg, and ankle strength. I can also confirm that my feet are fine. They’re not gross or deformed. I only ever got one blister, and it was my fault for seeing my elastic hastily, causing it to rub. My ankle is shot because I sprained it and it never healed properly, resulting in multiple re-sprains, and I wasn’t on pointe when I sprained it. 

Ballet, not pointe, ruined my knees, hips, and lower back, however. Turning out isn’t natural, and forcing your body to do something it’s not designed (per se) to do from an early age through early adulthood (3-18 for me) leads to things growing/developing in ways that make you feel 55 when you’re only 30! 😅

When teaching science, it’s better for students to figure out out how phenomena works through trial and error, rather than reading about it in a book. Makes sense, right? To a young kid, scientific explanations put into words is just that - a bunch of words. But young children are very much capable of explaining complex phenomena if they’ve been given the opportunity to explore and work through it themselves. 

My mom would never give any explanation or backstory as to why she felt so strong with her rules and boundaries, and would just say things like “because I said so/I’m your mother” or make threats to make me miserable in various ways. It wasn’t until later in life I got some clarity when I confided in my dad during a period where my mom had gone too far with her controlling ways. He told me some stories of my mom’s past that explained why my mom acted how she did with me. 

But at the same time, it made me even angrier. I was hurt. Hurt that my mom didn’t feel as though I was worthy of hearing these stories, that she didn’t want to share with me (no, it was nothing traumatic or sensitive, just very similar to myself at the time). It made me feel like she saw everything in me that she was ashamed of in herself. I got that vibe a lot from her. 
Still do from time to time.

We got through it after I cut her out of my life for about 6 months. She came around realizing that she needed to change or I would choose to not have her in my life at all. We get along great now, and we’re closer than we ever were! Not as close as many of my friends are with their moms, but still an improvement!"

I teach elementary school, and my ass would be (potentially)* toast if I explained what a period was to a student who was having a meltdown, thinking they were dying. It breaks my heart and makes me feel disgusted with myself to even think of the back and forth I’d do in my head, debating on whether or not to console a traumatized kiddo who trusted me and came to me for help, or save my skin and be like “ummm let’s go to the office and call your mom!”, knowing damn well that she wouldn’t be much help/not the consoling the kid wants, as she never bothered to explain it to her in the first place!

Touch topic for me. I worked with a co-worker who got in trouble for this exact situation. Student was hyperventilating, thinking she was dying of cancer like her aunt, parents couldn’t be reached, co-worker stepped in and was whatever person that student needed her to be for her in that moment. Makes my blood boil with how unfair that whole thing is, how much more sense it makes to charge the parents for “unlawful neglect through withholding information causing psychological trauma” or something. Makes me sad that kids have less rights than pets these days. (Not that I think pets deserve less - I’m a vegetarian - before people go there!).

* = I 100% adore the families and community I currently service. They are awesome people, many of which I feel are like family. I know that in this situation, should it ever arise, they would thank me endlessly if I comforted their daughter during such a scary time, and wouldn’t be weird about it it at all. But I know I’m lucky. I’ve worked elsewhere in the past that showed me how nuts parents can be about these things!"
