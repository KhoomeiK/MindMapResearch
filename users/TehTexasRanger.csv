unpopularopinion,ff7zz8q,t3_es5ma0,1579662428.0,Who cares. Ya life sucks we all know it. If it makes you mad go do something else.
college,ff7qfpc,t3_es1djp,1579655852.0,You want to avoid any communication majors at all cost. I’m a journalism major and it will ruin your life. The only thing you’ll be able to do is teach unless you have connections. The average high school grad makes the same amount as a journalist by age 23. Instead you’ll be in debt which will make it even worse for you. Journalism is a dead major and if you cannot do something in STEM or something like nursing/marketing I’d just drop out of college.
unpopularopinion,ff7q0qi,t3_es3ymm,1579655558.0,"Everyone knows this. I blame myself for not being good at math or science. Instead I chose a shit journalism degree and now in debt. So now I’m fucked in life. But instead of being a plague on society I rather just off myself. At least this way, I won’t be taking up space for people who are more fit in modern society."

TooAfraidToAsk,fe8okn0,t1_fe89l7a,1578928669.0,I never thought I was special. I was told I was shit from Day 1. So I worked to prove the opposite but unfortunately I’ve always came up short.
TooAfraidToAsk,fe8n52p,t1_fe8gh7h,1578928165.0,Yes I have a degree in journalism which is a huge mistake. I felt like I should’ve dropped out of college instead.
TooAfraidToAsk,fe6my06,t1_fe6ln60,1578896456.0,Mainly because I’m too mentally weak do to stuff while lacking any form of talent or skill. I also feel constantly drained and have low energy. Some days I wake up feeling like I have the flu even though I’m not sick. So it’s complicated.
TooAfraidToAsk,fe6lbno,t1_fe6kfci,1578894723.0,B. Unfortunately I care..
unpopularopinion,fe6jali,t1_fe6j7i0,1578892716.0,Nah. I just feel like there’s no point for most of us to even care about living because there’s absolutely nothing to look forward to.
TooAfraidToAsk,fe6j6le,t1_fe6ij26,1578892610.0,I’ve felt this way since I was 19 well really 13 but it started to get really bad during college.
unpopularopinion,fe6j3hf,t1_fe6ilg5,1578892525.0,I feel like most people do but don’t want to admit it.
unpopularopinion,fe6ifw7,t3_enzhr1,1578891908.0,As you get older stuff becomes less enjoyable. Paying this months rent becomes your new game and your employer can disconnect you at anytime:
unpopularopinion,fe6fwvk,t3_enz2sy,1578889684.0,Marrying someone and popping out a kid isn’t an accomplishment either
unpopularopinion,fe6dhoo,t3_eny95x,1578887715.0,It’s kinda weird but that’s just my opinion.
unpopularopinion,fe3uvoi,t1_fe2qr8m,1578853129.0,Dang. Well never mind my statement lol. But that’s interesting.
unpopularopinion,fe2olos,t1_fe2n5ub,1578841246.0,Chemical imbalance in their brain probably. They might have serotonin deficiency which makes them feel bad all the time.
unpopularopinion,fe0ihn5,t3_enkg3j,1578813918.0,TTG comedy is as witty as taking a shit in a truck and calling it a dumpster truck.
unpopularopinion,fdy38qa,t1_fdxvnrd,1578775585.0,Yeah most don’t. When I was working at some office I told people how deep they collect your information and their jaws dropped. But that didn’t stop them from logging on Facebook still lol.
unpopularopinion,fdxvfge,t3_enbukm,1578773335.0,People don’t care about being under 24-7 watch as long as they can see their favorite consumerism product on their screen.

unpopularopinion,fdorsup,t1_fdooe1x,1578611453.0,Hold up. Let me go ahead and change the entire world. I’ll be back in 5 days.
unpopularopinion,fdnjtj7,t1_fdmkugc,1578587301.0,"It’s not because they have to work. It’s because worldwide most people absolutely hate their jobs. This leads then to hate a large portion of their day, nearly everyday for the rest of their lives. This only leads them to maybe enjoy a few hours of the day if that and then maybe he weekends. And that is if they aren’t over stressed about the job they hate or the fact that they can be thrown out of the door at any moment due to outsourcing, automation, or etc."
unpopularopinion,fdniohj,t1_fdml12x,1578586619.0,Not at all. I don’t really have any passions. I just pick a job and do it the best I can. It doesn’t bring me any pleasure at all but I like to eat occasionally so I do it anyways. I don’t have any super deep emotional connections with people.
unpopularopinion,fdnia9w,t1_fdmnric,1578586383.0,Never said life should be 100% all enjoyment. In my experience it’s more of a 99% state of misery and emotional/mental numbness.
unpopularopinion,fdmkyy0,t1_fdmktxt,1578553835.0,In my experience the balance between good and bad is completely uneven. Maybe if you’re a person with great potential maybe. If you’re an average peasant like me and many others then you’ll be experiencing pain either mentally or physically every single day while enjoyment comes maybe once a month if you’re lucky
unpopularopinion,fdmkpnf,t1_fdmk8a3,1578553538.0,It’s sad too because I’ve seen reports where suicide rates in the US are reaching WW2 era levels. Life is miserable for most people because there is absolutely nothing to look forward to. At this point it feels like assisted suicide being illegal is just a business strategy. It seems like they know that if it became legal a lot of business people may lose a few of their workers due to the get out of jail card.
college,fdahsxu,t1_fdafh9l,1578246231.0,"I mean, I’m a non-stem major myself. I’ve lived the reality of a non-stem major. Now that I think of it, out of all the non-stem majors, I know most of them are working at Arby’s or the dollar store. My friend is unemployed. The only successful one I know to become an actress and influencer through her insane connections. I know this is exceptionally anecdotal and doesn’t mean much, but that’s just my personal experience. The people who had STEM majors are either going for their masters or have full-time jobs and don’t depend on their parents anymore as we all do."
college,fdaeqxv,t3_ekehjt,1578245214.0,"Because if you do not have a STEM degree chances are you’re going to be living with your parents, homeless, work a full time job and be on the brink of homelessness , or forced to join the military out of survival necessities. This isn’t always true if you have extreme connections, but for a lot of people this is the case."

unpopularopinion,fd5oclm,t3_ek45bf,1578179641.0,Nothing like good ol discrimination.
unpopularopinion,fd5n3zh,t3_ek3mam,1578179271.0,Having a kid is not an achievement. If the overwhelming majority of the worlds population can spit out a child it’s not an achievement
unpopularopinion,fd5mwje,t3_ek3q3t,1578179202.0,Poor people have the right but they should not. Poor people who have kids are absolute assholes. All they are doing is dooming someone else to a life of misery because they’re such a fuckup they have to fuck over someone else’s life too. Fuck them for doing that shit.
AskReddit,fd1a4wh,t3_ejt8je,1578129040.0,Honestly I want to die. I do not enjoy life and I’m tired of generic advice and cliche quotes: i want to go ahead and die
AskReddit,fd12a0k,t1_fd0ybg8,1578126794.0,What if success is the only thing that would make this person happy but they have zero potential in everything
depression,fd0ykrf,t1_fd0wtes,1578125519.0,I don’t get better at games. I’ve never actually improved at anything I ever do. How I start is usually how I finish no matter how hard I try
depression,fd0vb2c,t3_ejtro1,1578124244.0,Video games make me feel worse because it reminds me i lose in life and in games
college,fcwqda4,t1_fcwow7s,1578033522.0,Lol you’ll enjoy it in college but as soon as you graduate you will realize how fucked you are. Then those student loans creep up. You can't find a decent job that pays more than Walmart. You'll see first hand.
unpopularopinion,fcwo6vn,t3_ejb54g,1578031354.0,True. I feel weird just watching Disney stuff or cartoons made for children. I’m too old for that.
unpopularopinion,fcwnah8,t1_fcwn7q8,1578030525.0,Not really. They’re just lower class in general.
unpopularopinion,fcwn6bs,t1_fcwmxvu,1578030420.0,People who work for minimum wage aren’t middle class.
unpopularopinion,fcwn3ca,t3_ejao95,1578030343.0,"Most people suffer from depression because this is the first time humans have mass access to information. People are now learning how shit everything is in life and do not want to participate in. There is very little to look forward to in life. Suicide is becoming an increasingly attractive deal which is the the numbers have skyrocketed, in the US at least."
college,fcwmx3f,t3_ej9fbi,1578030186.0,Using that to get into grad school for something useful is different. Atleast the biology major might have a shot to get a high paying job in the future. The communications major has no hope in life outside of McJob wages and living with their mom until age 40 unless they make a miracle happen.
SuicideWatch,fcwmopq,t3_ejazvg,1578029983.0,I always do. I know that I’m a fuck up who we live a life not worth living. The only thing I could hope for is a painless quick death.
college,fcwj18y,t3_ej6lri,1578026940.0,Yes. I regret not dropping out of college after failing math exams.
college,fcwiq9y,t3_ej77a8,1578026701.0,If you’re not going into STEM or something like Law then drop out of college. Do not waste your time.
college,fcwilqr,t3_ej9fbi,1578026603.0,It depends. If you graduated with an actually degree then yes. But if you chose a worthless major then you’re either living with your parents or borderline homeless.
unpopularopinion,fcwiebt,t3_eja21r,1578026442.0,CA is great if you’re rich.
college,fcwi76h,t1_fcuvjw6,1578026289.0,Yep. Life is shit and then you die.
unpopularopinion,fcukj8a,t1_fcuhus5,1577983059.0,This pretty much. Accept your shit life and move on
unpopularopinion,fcuk67v,t3_ej0bfb,1577982848.0,Obvious troll post is obvious.
AskMen,fcuju9e,t1_fctyo96,1577982641.0,Yeah it’s called a journalism degree lmao
college,fctvmjw,t1_fctm81o,1577961843.0,Do not take journalism. It is a worthless major and the job market is terrible. You will be making wages similar to a Walmart employee.  Consider going into Law
AskMen,fctvjnu,t3_eiwi1w,1577961723.0,Telling people what my degree is in. It lets them know immediately that I’m retarded
AskMen,fctuttj,t3_eiwk4w,1577960675.0,Like shit as always
college,fcrzq4d,t1_fcp4cro,1577909082.0,Terrible option. 100% will not find a decent job unless you have connections. You are better off working at McDonald's for four years. At least then you might become a manager making more money then you would taking pictures.
college,fcrzkog,t3_eid8pe,1577908994.0,"Those degrees are worthless. The reality is after you graduate, you probably will not be able to find a job you can live on. Then you will be forced to live with your parents while everyone mocks you for being a loser."
unpopularopinion,fcpffkf,t1_fcpetyf,1577861620.0,The point is i already know I’m a failure. Rather not be reminded everyday
unpopularopinion,fcperlb,t3_eif6az,1577860835.0,Nah I rather not be reminded how much I’m a failure at life everyday
unpopularopinion,fcot2lz,t3_eibr34,1577840785.0,Agreed. Ain’t shit different except for the number of the of year
unpopularopinion,fcos34l,t3_eibldq,1577840038.0,People are always shitheads. It doesn’t get better with age. If anything it gets worse because then they’ll have more ways to talk shit about you.

unpopularopinion,fcorjo5,t3_eib6uy,1577839628.0,Therapy is a waste of time. Give you pretty basic generic answers that you’ll see from a YouTube video. Actually made me feel worse than when I started
unpopularopinion,fcoras6,t3_eib9m2,1577839443.0,It’s just another day like the rest. Just another shitty decade
AskReddit,fcm3ktz,t1_fcm2zem,1577763332.0,Damn at least your person got what they kind of deserve. In my case it’s the opposite. This person now lives a great lifestyle with a small role in a movie. Has sponsorships via Instagram and lives an insane lifestyle because she had the right connections while looking moderately attractive.
unpopularopinion,fcm3297,t3_ehx153,1577762949.0,Streaming is about having connections. The only way to really be a streamer now is to already have a following or be a cute girl with an instagram.

AskReddit,fcm2n13,t3_ehx07s,1577762633.0,They tried to use me and get me to do their college work. Sat next to me in class and didn’t do shit. Came in one day drunk. Pretty much did the bare minimum in academics.
AskReddit,fcm2hlz,t3_ehx155,1577762518.0,How much worse life gets
TooAfraidToAsk,fcl9gpv,t1_fcl7rc2,1577742705.0,Yeah and boomers wonder why suicide rates are so high
SuicideWatch,fcl9aax,t3_ehsqfh,1577742593.0,Unfortunately life never really gets better. It’s just some lame ass shit that people tell themselves to  try to make everything better.
TooAfraidToAsk,fcl3ubw,t3_ehrie8,1577739215.0,"They don’t have time to. By the time they are 13 they have to consider what will they do with their life to start working to pay for the insane college fees. If they’re aren’t talented in math science, or some other field they can exploit to make a lot of money from they’re basically fucked"

unpopularopinion,fcjti1d,t3_ehknzd,1577703919.0,Nah life is shit. Suicide is a good option. Someone shouldn’t be miserable just to keep a few people from being sad for a few hours to a month. And also you’re helping the people who are employed at these jobs hat collection bodies and etc. so you’re helping with their job. Not selfish
unpopularopinion,fcjs3zi,t3_ehkgg2,1577701879.0,True most of us are just cogs in the machine. When we die we are easily replaced.
unpopularopinion,fc3sg4g,t1_fc3qw6y,1577397462.0,True but I think the average movie goer barely pays attention to what they’re watching which is why he standards for movies can be extremely low.
unpopularopinion,fc3scrg,t3_eg103a,1577397394.0,I never watched games of thrones but rise of Skywalker was trash.
unpopularopinion,fc3rx4k,t1_fc18upg,1577397089.0,When I think of basic I don’t think of attitude. I was thinking of the basic person that wakes up. Does a boring 9-5. Marries. Have kids. Does that boring 9-5 for the next 60+ years. Die
AskRedditAfterDark,fc29qrw,t1_fc1y2ba,1577347418.0,"Yeah somewhat. But I don’t talk to people very often so I try not to deal with it. For me personally I get the whole “you aren’t black” thing because of the way I talk, dress, and my interest."

unpopularopinion,fc1e7fp,t3_efn4kx,1577316105.0,True which is why most successful people know how the game goes and can easily manipulate others. That’s why most successful people aren’t super nice guys. Nice guys/women always finish last most of the time.
AskRedditAfterDark,fc1du02,t1_fc1amuz,1577315786.0,Yeah Im from Alabama so it wasn’t  uncommon for me to hear someone say something like that
