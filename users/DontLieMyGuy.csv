This is a step in the right direction. We need to have more insurance options. A young person like me doesn’t need the same coverage an 80yr old needs too. Catastrophic insurance would be nice. My employer pays 20,000 a year for my wife and I. And I still have a deductible when I get a service. That’s insane. If healthcare were cheaper, my employer could afford to pay me more. Wages would rise. It’s a real universal problem for sure."

quittingkratom,feedwdy,t3_eoq5ow,1579031746.0,"So we can’t name vendors? I would buy your own CBD isolate and make a simple olive oil tincture. I use CBDistillery. Right now they’re out of stock on the 3.5g and 7g jars though. 

If you’re referring to topicals, I buy my own isolate and make my own salve. The base is beeswax and coconut oil but I add a lot of others like jojoba oil,   Vitamin E, camphor oil, peppermint extract, and a couple more I can’t think of at the moment. I skip the hemp seed oil. I make my little tins with 500-1000mg per 2-3oz tin. 

The stuff is downright amazing. My father and mother in law use it every night on they’re neck and back and my wife’s grandma uses it on her hands because they go numb once in a while. My lower back was hurting yesterday and I rubbed some on and the pain vanished in 3 minutes. 

 Here’s where I found the original recipe. It’s very easy to make and ends up costing about $33 per 2-3oz tin. Most of that cost ($27) is for the CBD. You can find all that on amazon. I add a little more beeswax than the recipe so the salve isn’t so oily.

Fitness,fecho1k,t3_eofjlw,1578974156.0,I mean your post answers your question. You’re 110lbs and exercise intensively 1.5hrs almost every day and eat a pretty conservative diet. Plus your metabolism is probably above average. Your stomach could be stretched too. Maybe taking two days off and fasting for most of the day will help it shrink? Also I bet cheating on weekends stretches your stomach for the week ahead. Just my 2 cents.
