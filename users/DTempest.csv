I'm sure a lot was known about the spaces for expansion and contraction needed in joints etc which was later seen as unneeded and is lost. Will people look at present structural engineers' knowledge of steel and concrete in the same manner?

&#x200B;

What you said somewhat reminds me of the national navies during the age of sail which used to have to plan vast periods in advance for what size wood they predicted wood be needed for ships future, as the keel of ships needed to be one long piece of timber, forests were planted with the expectation of the huge trees being needed when mature in a hundred years. Of course just about when this became most organised, and when ships became largest and requiring the tallest trees; metal hulled vessels became more and more common, so many of these giant trees which had been expected to be used to build timber ships were never cut down."

I use an anycubic photon, the original rather than the newer S model. Its been a steep learning curve but incredibly engaging and fulfilling to experiment with. When I have more spare time I can't wait to see what I can make. Exposure time and support placement are the  key, and I'm now managing to use fewer and fewer supports, and getting more experimental with editing the models I'm going to print.

todayilearned,feo310a,t1_fel31yy,1579294469.0,"One thing I've noticed on reddit is that there's a tendency for us to end up in circular discussions because we're trying to make points which don't actually related to  each other, we don't realise we're have two separate monologues trying to explain our point to someone who is trying to make a point on a totally different foundation of what the conversation is about.

To me this was about why the comment about about tearing down and rebuilding temples wasn't commonly applicable to Buddhist ones, but might arise from the common stories about regular reconstruction of Shinto buildings for ritual purposes.

No one is arguing that wood rots- or that some pieces of architecture survive by chance. Survivor bias means we can mistakenly assume that all historical buildings were built by skilled engineer with well chosen materials- which clearly wasn't the case.

&#x200B;

I would like to know about why Horyuji has survived so well in the humid climate of japan, and also if any special precautions were taken against accidental fire or lightning, but this was never the point of the discussion for me. I guess you were saying that because many wood buildings do have to be rebuilt due to poor maintenance and environmental conditions there was a sustainable market for this construction company still, and I'd unconsciously moved away from that topic."

I have a decent resin printers it can get the same level of detail as the GW plastics.but a print takes 13 hours, I'm exposed to hazardous liquids, and preparing the model the build and paint is t as easy as snapping it off a sprue.

There are 5 temples around Kyoto which have bloody footprints and handprints on their ceiling, as those timber used to be the floor of Fushimi Castle , and the stains are the blood of Tokugawa Ieyasu's slain retainers.

A praetor on bike in a command squad is absolutely deadly, as they'll have a 3+ jink if nightfighting, 2+ armour, and usually hit and wound on 2s with power fists and axes. They will chew through the enemy army and attract tonnes of fire. Easily one of the most dangerous units in the game at 2k."

The Horus heresy, which is one of the 3 main game systems,has received much less support recently than the other two, especially since a lot of forgeworld was moved over to specialist games. 40k is getting constant content and entire range rereleases.
