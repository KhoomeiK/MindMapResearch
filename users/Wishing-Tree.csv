AskReddit,ff2lklp,t1_ff1zlu3,1579511885.0,"Well true, don't have nothing but water but if you are over eating it's a guide idea to drink first.  And slow down.  Eating to fast stops you registering that you are full."
AskReddit,ff0xkr5,t1_fey0vo4,1579473296.0,"Making, and keeping, friends.   I am super insecure and crap at social stuff so am too inhibited to contact people as I think they can't really want to spend time with me.  This makes me a shit friend and so I have lost all the friends I have ever had except for one, that I speak to a few times a year.  I suck."
AskReddit,ff0vhcy,t1_fezfiio,1579472691.0,Was about to say this.  Fill up on water.  Also the thirst impulse often gets mistaken for hunger so if you think you're hungry Inbetween meals drink some water first and wait.
bulletjournal,fezh87s,t1_fewp2pl,1579457319.0,I would think bi-weekly was twice a week and would use fortnightly for every two weeks.   Dunno what OP intended though!

The trashy British press already doesn't like her and now its progressed to full on hate that she's ""stealing out prince"", it's bloody bonkers.  Just leave em be."
AskReddit,fejhhqt,t1_fejfjyt,1579174470.0,"So many people in my old job had this mindset, there were a lot of women aged 50+ and they would discount themselves from being able to do it before they even started.  ""oh I just don't get computers"" ""I'm too old"" etc.  It's frustrating nonsense, these were intelligent people who could have figured it out if they really wanted."

bulletjournal,fddwd5j,t1_fddvfkk,1578325594.0,It's one that's recommended loads and the one the original guy used I think.  I didn't realised the pages are only 90gsm though.  I'll do a tester page at  the back and see if anything I have works.  Thanks.

WholesomeComics,fcaq1me,t1_fca6nfx,1577574309.0,"I don't think it's so much that many individuals hold that explicit belief, though I don't doubt that there are those that do, but more that its part of pervasive and subconscious biases and ideas on gender roles.  For example-how toys are gendered and marketed.  And it's not that women in STEM aren't ""girly enough"" but that you have to be more ""like the boys"" to be into those fields; cool/intelligent/nerdy girls aren't into all that stupid giiirllly shit like make up and bows yknow?  All that pretty feminine stuff is just for dumb bimbos.  Ohhh obviously if you're into science you couldn't possibly want to wear a bow in your hair like a ""typical girl"", nah you subvert that and wear a bow tie like those awesome boys that science really belongs to.  /s
Or something.  I dunno."
WholesomeComics,fca4kot,t1_fc92nyt,1577562969.0,"Could be I guess, Dr Who came to my mind first as a bow tie reference as we are not so familiar with Nye over here (UK).

AskReddit,fc0b2yk,t1_fc08ndb,1577285551.0,No that is VAT which is our basically our sales tax.  There isn't a separate one.
