sugarfree,fcz1sbs,t1_fcyuhk4,1578091940.0,"Me too. 
You know it occurred to me that when my Aunt quit smoking she had these huge chocolate bars everywhere. 
I know that when an alcoholic quits alcohol you get a lot of sugar and coffee offered.
A drug addicted also is offered sugar.
Sugar is just another drug that takes longer to kill you or ruin your life. The very fact that a smoker, an alcoholic, and a drug addict use it to mitigate their withdrawals is disconcerting."

Start looking outside yourself —purposely , mindfully and intentionally.  Love others.
You have know idea what they are going through that day. Purposely be kind to a person. If you don’t have a job go out and be kind to somebody at 7:11."
