SouthFlorida,fcynygu,t3_ehby9d,1578083604.0,duplicated comment. deleted.  Sorry.
SouthFlorida,fcynxnh,t3_ehby9d,1578083591.0,"My parents were heavily involved with the Bible College and I lived there for about 18 months when we first sold our house and moved up to Hollywood from Coconut Grove.  I have a long history with that building...had my first kiss there, my sister's wedding was there, etc.  

I never understood why Oceanwalk didn't take off.  It was really hot for about the first two years, then places just stopped making money.  Now the old mall part is mostly vacant and kind of spooky.  The one good thing about the place is the old O'Malley's bar behind the hotel on the Broadwalk has reopened as Grumpy Gary's.  It's pretty good and I have a good friend that works there.  It's kinda pricey when it's not happy hour, but show me a place on the beach that isn't.

Being a South Florida native, I hate seeing old things getting bulldozed and built all shiney.  But in the case of the hotel it's probably way too far gone for the rehab it needs. From what I know, there are like 3 different groups that own parts of the property, and none of them can agree on what to do with it.  So it sits and decays while they argue.  It's a shame.  

U\The_Write_Stuff is correct.  This is our gateway to the beach and it should be a landmark rather than an eyesore."
