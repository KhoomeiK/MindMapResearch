It touches on a lot of crazy topics—like the near infinite (yet not perfectly infinite) range of sound combinations that can be formed within a 5 minute CD audio track. Also, the interesting psychology behind why we like familiar (but not too familiar) melodies. Maybe it’s all the Britney I’ve listened to, but sometimes one simple chord change in an otherwise “plain” song can totally make it for me. The song Not About a Girl by Film School comes to mind, but I could be off on the title there.

Boomers were handed a new American Dream and prosperity never known before—and they’ve stolen, squandered, manipulated both the economy and governance. No mind the Great Recession thing...

I think it’s fitting that they flame out with Trump holding the reins. He was one of the poster children for 80’s greed, which led in part to the outsourcing of manufacturing, which led in large part to the collapse of our traditional economy in the US. Pure, shortsighted, unmanaged greed.

Of course all generalizations are, well, simply that. But over the last five to ten years, the Boomer generation (in general) has been deeply and consistently disappointing on the most important issues.

I wasn’t looking to prove a point with my post so much as get some input. I probably could’ve phrased it better.

I mentioned the “guy I met story” because it felt *to me* to be representative of what I’ve heard from other passionate pro-gun individuals. So, if you want to give it a quick glance, I’d like to hear your take on it. I think you’d have a better read on that overall stance than me.

To argue over details, such as, “Which model gun is designed to do what?” is a slippery slope, and probably not helpful assuming that either one of us sincerely wants to understand the other. But, I do think it’s necessary to make a distinction between guns (assault rifles, for lack of a better term) that were specifically designed to kill people during war—and which have no other *good faith* uses—and the majority of all other gun in the market. The M-16/AR-15 in fully or semi-auto configuration are both potent tools of war. I hope we can agree on that model, alone, despite its popularity with some gun owners.

A handgun may be designed to kill people, but it’s limited in lethality and capacity (to some extent). Hunting rifles can be more lethal on a shot-per-shot basis compared to a military combat rifle, but again, the real world differences are significant.

So, with all that said, I think “sensible” regulation (from *my* point of view) would entail closing gun show loopholes, enforcing mandatory background checks—so that existing laws can be adhered to. And whatever other loopholes that allow someone to buy a gun without any waiting period. As for military grade combat rifles, I think you should have to get a license to own one, and the barriers to attaining that license should be both meaningful and reasonable (such that anyone could own one, but they’d have to demonstrate a commensurate amount of knowledge and skill). Penalties for violating gun laws should be serious (and they already seem to be in most places) and consistent. 

That’s it, from my perspective. What I’ve mentioned seem like actions that any (truly) responsible gun owner could swallow—as all that’s really there is a closing of loopholes.

The “left” would like to go further than what I’ve described, *but* I honestly don’t think they want anything that involves people turning in their guns, or overly invasive procedures to monitor gun ownership. There are nut jobs on both sides—but to me those groups are irrelevant (though they seem to make the most noise). I’m curious to hear what you think, and if you made it this far, thanks."

Damnthatsinteresting,fdwf0ad,t1_fdsqe6d,1578758048.0,"I think passionate gun owners, are, on average, some degree of paranoid. I was doing a ride share and I picked up a guy and his wife who were traveling 45 minutes away. One thing led to another, and we ended up on the topic of guns. (Just as background, this guy seemed like a genuinely nice guy. He and his wife were going from a nice part of town to a nice part of another town. And both communicated well, appeared educated, blah blah blah.)

Anyway, this guy let it known that he was 100% convinced that “the left” *absolutely* has an agenda to take everyone’s guns away from them.

I think this is not only bananas, but not even remotely plausible. The leaps in logic to get there are simply impossible (IMHO). But I’ve heard this same line of thought many times, from many sources.

There are more guns in America than people. Not even on the longest timeline does anyone in any party (with two brain cells to rub together) think that they could truly “take people’s guns from them.” Nor have I ever heard anyone (who is talking sense) say that they think guns should be banned.

What I do think might happen, is because gun owners aren’t willing to concede *anything* WRT gun control (not even talking about banning any guns) if Democrats do ever get the majority to pass legislation, it’s going to be far more radical than had the NRA (and whoever else) given a little on the subject. But even in the worst case scenario for gun devotees, I can’t imagine it ever going beyond a ban on military grade assault rifles (designed purely with the ability to large groups of people) and some stricter background check stuff, plus closing gun show loopholes.

That’s as far as I can possible imagine it going in my lifetime, or the next 50 years. If gun owners could have conceded to stricter background checks (I’m talking rather mild restrictions that seem like common sense to the majority of people) I doubt “gun control” would even go as far as I described above.

Paranoia and fear have a way of manifesting the very things they are most afraid of. Just my 2 1/2 cents... I’m not a liberal or “gun control advocate.” 🤷‍♂️"

MapPorn,fdpnt3g,t1_fdoza3b,1578634025.0,"I don’t think there’s much hate towards states simply because they’re rural or less developed. But there is some correlation between the attitude and those attributes, since there are significant reasons why some places remain rural and less developed.

I don’t dislike Nevada, for instance, simply because it’s largely a rural state, but because it’s so barren, hot and devoid of life. I also don’t like Vegas much, and cities placed in the middle of a hot, dry, featureless desert suck up tons of resources just to exist. And thus they don’t feel very inspired. If it weren’t for air conditioning I don’t think many people would live there, which says a lot (IMHO). 

Phoenix in the middle of summer feels like a godless scorched earth hellscape. This is an example that has nothing to do with city vs rural, or developed vs underdeveloped.

But that’s not been the situation. Their cooperation with the nuclear treaty (that Trump ripped up like a little brat) was actually a success. We *were* on a (relatively) stable path with Iran. 

To get all up in their shit by assassinating  their second in command is dumb as fuck. Our priorities should not be in Middle Eastern politics. Like I mentioned, China? And Russia? And modernizing our economy. We need to quit screwing with MidEast countries. (They might even start to leave us alone if we stopped f’ing with them... Imagine!)"
worldnews,fdjhag7,t1_fdjgp3d,1578470772.0,"The treaty with Iran that Obama orchestrated, which was an incredible diplomatic feat pertained to nuclear enrichment. The one thing that Republican hawks (and Israel) yelled and screamed about the loudest. The nuclear treaty was a success by all accounts when you pause to consider its scope.

No country can force another country to stop “trying to expand their regional influence.” That’s absurd because that’s precisely what *every country in the world* tries to do in one way or another.

To think that the US can—or even has the right—to micromanage Iran’s sovereignty is presumptuous and ignorant beyond belief. The US doesn’t NEED to be in the Middle East anyway. FFS.

We need to focus on China and Russia and making sure our economy is protected and competitive. WTF are we still doing messing around in the Middle East?!"

If you read about mining towns in America during the 1800’s what they describe is frightening. They were all male (except for the brothels), and civilization essentially vanished in all but the most basic and utilitarian of ways. Cheyenne, Wyoming, about an hour and a half north of me was fine example of this—in part because I don’t think there was even much mining to do.

It’d be a fascinating sitcom, however. (Though I’d only expect about half the dads to make it to episode five.)"
