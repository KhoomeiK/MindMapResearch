## Is irregardless a word?: Usage Guide

*Irregardless*  was popularized in dialectal American speech in the early 20th century.  Its increasingly widespread spoken use called it to the attention of  usage commentators as early as 1927. The most frequently repeated remark  about it is that ""there is no such word."" There is such a word,  however. It is still used primarily in speech, although it can be found  from time to time in edited prose. Its reputation has not risen over the  years, and it is still a long way from general acceptance. Use *regardless* instead.

I'm seriously asking, English is my second language and it seems ~~un~~impractical unless there's a grammatical reason to avoid a certain misunderstanding when speaking.

Languages usually develop overtime to be easier and to discard unnecessary words. From what I see the word ""fewer"" is rarely used and when the word ""less"" is used instead the same meaning of the sentence is still communicated."
