educationalgifs,fczfg0w,t1_fczblpz,1578100071.0,"THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF A LARGE AMOUNT OF ENTROPY DISAPPEARING LOCALLY SO THAT THE TOTAL ENTROPY OF THE UNIVERSE CAN INCREASE (BY AN EVEN LARGER AMOUNT).

IN THE VIDEO, EVERY MOLE OF OXYGEN THAT REACTS TO FORM A SOLID TO SIT IN THE MEASURING TRAY REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL LOSS OF ENTROPY. (GASES CONTAIN MORE ENTROPY THAN CONDENSED MATTER.) THE REASON THAT THE REACTION PROCEEDS, THEN, MUST BE THAT IT'S EXOTHERMIC. THE THERMAL ENERGY PRODUCED AND ITS TRANSFER TO THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT BOTH INCREASE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ENTROPY IN THE UNIVERSE, BY A LARGER AMOUNT THAN WAS DESTROYED BY GAS ELIMINATION.

THIS KIND OF EXCHANGE CAN BE QUANTIFIED USING AN ELLINGHAM DIAGRAM. ALL THE OXIDATION REACTIONS SHOWN ARE EXOTHERMIC. ALL BECOME LESS SPONTANEOUS AS THE TEMPERATURE INCREASES (BECAUSE THE ENTROPY OF THE GAS ESSENTIALLY BECOMES MORE IMPORTANT WITH INCREASING TEMPERATURE) EXCEPT FOR TWO REACTIONS: (1) THE REACTION OF CARBON WITH OXYGEN TO PRODUCE CARBON DIOXIDE, WHICH TAKES A MOLE OF ONE GAS AND GIVES YOU A MOLE OF ANOTHER GAS, SO THE CORRESPONDING LINE ON THE DIAGRAM IS HORIZONTAL, AND (2) THE REACTION OF CARBON WITH OXYGEN TO PRODUCE CARBON MONOXIDE, WHICH ACTUALLY TURNS A MOLE OF ONE GAS INTO TWO MOLES OF ANOTHER GAS, RESULTING IN A POSITIVE SLOPE."
