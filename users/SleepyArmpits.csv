If you get in shape, do it for you, if you do anything to improve yourself, do it for the sake of your own mental health and self love and self care. 

An open marriage would require that you are both allowed to see other people. Why would only you stay monogamous? Is it for religious reasons? Your comfort level? Or his comfort levels? 

He’s asking too much of you without any compassion or love for all that you’ve done for him and for your family. You don’t need to be grateful that he asked first, that’s just some lame excuse he’s trying to come up with to use against you later. You deserve better! Fine lines, baby weight, all of that doesn’t matter - you deserve respect and you deserve love regardless of the things that have happened due to natural consequences. 

Don’t be hard on yourself. Accept your husband for exactly who he is - whatever that may truly be - and then decide if you’re willing to put up with that or not."

I understand your sister is still planning her wedding, but you’re grieving the loss of a relationship.

breakingmom,ff2eywk,t3_er5q2u,1579503341.0,"I have to work on my mindset constantly as it’s a work in progress. It’s hard for me to explain but it’s kind of like, changing from thinking I need to slave over and do all these things for them to just living together and being with them. It just got a lot easier when I let go of a lot of the pressure and expectations put on me, and I pace myself and only do a little at a time. I’ve also stopped interacting with a lot of judgemental parents because that’s just stress inducing. 

Not sure any of that made sense but I hope it helps! I know it’s hard, and we are made to feel guilty for it. Evolution makes us want these adorable little ones, but modern society has made it extremely difficult to raise them.

Editing to add (because I saw some other comments), I do have shared custody, so I am not around my kids constantly. I have been judged and shamed for it (not like I had control over the decision but whatever) but ultimately I’m able to be a much better parent to them when I am not overworked and stressed."

You deserve better. You deserve a “fiancé” that is thrilled to be marrying you, you deserve someone that will give you space when you need it, you deserve someone that’ll check in on you when you’re sick, you deserve someone that won’t sabotage the things going on in your life just to make it all about them. 

Be careful about getting out. Abuse escalates when the abuser feels like they are losing control and they’ll start using all kinds of things as leverage against you. 

Be safe, and love yourself."

This guy made the girl look crazy, and with how words go around, women are called crazy all the time. He gaslit her and manipulated everyone to take his side over hers. 

I’m glad you ended things with him, but he’s not going to let things end amicably, pretty soon you’ll be considered crazy too - especially if you’re trying to leave a note to tell someone to apologize. The two guys will probably just get a laugh about “those crazy bitches”. 

Get your things and be as avoidant as possible, and don’t let him engage you in any conversation that would require you to give information."

datingoverthirty,fenzxob,t3_eq3466,1579293210.0,"I don’t believe in this statement either. I cheated on my first ex many many many years ago (15+?) several times. It was an unhealthy relationship, but I stayed with him to get away from family abuse. He however didn’t treat me a whole lot better, treated me like I was his personal sex doll but had zero interest in making it a two way street. So yeah, I cheated on him with people who were more caring and more attentive. 

I really think cheating is kind of like an alarm that signals that something is wrong and something needs to be addressed. Of course not all cheating is like that though, so it really depends on the situation and on the person. 

If you’re concerned about the more impulsive “I don’t care how this will affect anyone” type of cheating, look for signs of narcissism. If it’s not that, then it should be okay."
askwomenadvice,fenpfvr,t3_eq4dnx,1579288897.0,"This used to be me, but then I had kids and never slept and am constantly overwhelmed with stress, so now it’s OBVIOUS I’m not 16 anymore. There’s no “you’ll appreciate it when you’re older” now! 

Also, I hate how society makes it a joke and even a terrible thing for women to age. It happens, it’s natural, and there shouldn’t be any insult or fear of it at all. 

Unless legally required, I wouldn’t waste any time or effort on these people that want to know your age. I’ve learned as a way of coping to just act dumb in certain circumstances when people make comments about my (age/race/whatever else that’s none of their business). I’d recommend you continue to be your fabulous self, and just say “oh ok”. And they can feel their own stupidity if they were to ever find out."

I’m a single mom but share custody. On my days with them I stay at home to tend to house work and dinner and all the paperwork that needs to be done and what not, when they’re not around I work part time to provide for us. I have them on school days, so I only see them for dinner, spend some time doing activities (or take them to their own activities) and then bed. I don’t see them often, and they get to do all the fun weekend things with their dad. I miss them all the time.

breakingmom,fdpi2x7,t3_emekmk,1578629209.0,"This is so honest and I really appreciate it. 

I notice a difference between my son (10) and my daughter (6). I have no official diagnosis if my son is special needs or not, but I do feel like I have to parent him way more than I do my daughter. My daughter just does a lot of things naturally on her own and only needs some reminders on the odd occasion, but with my son it’s constant and I always feel like he’s giving me so much attitude. He’ll always respond with okay mom, but turn around to continue doing what he wasn’t supposed to or something like that. And I swear to god, the stress levels are going to kill me, I hate being his parent! I bet if I was his aunt or mentor it’d be so much easier to just play board games with him and hang out, but no, constant reminders for literally everything. 

So on some level I can relate. It’s not easy, and it’s not exactly enjoyable, and I think more and more people should and can be honest about it. I hope your littlest one feels better soon!"

So although he was kind and smart and willing to incorporate into my little family, there were a lot of things missing and I was left with a lot of doubts for a long time.

Things ended up being really tense my entire birthday and he didn’t even bring it up at all because he didn’t want to fight on my birthday. So instead I sulked and cried by myself because apparently avoiding issues is the best way to go about things? (Sorry, still a bit salty about it).
