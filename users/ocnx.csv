depression,feilmes,t3_eoxun3,1579141404.0,When youre sad dont worry it will pass. When youre happy dont get attatched it will pass too.
stopdrinking,feed4mm,t3_eoqb66,1579031292.0,I like the connections you have made here. Your doing a good job!
NoStupidQuestions,fe2yzoh,t3_enoyot,1578844396.0,Probably not but if we are that far along that we are actually inhabiting another planet then we might have a solution by then.
Meditation,fdnh1nw,t3_embilv,1578585637.0,"At first it always felt like that. Now when i do i feel like its my sanctuary. My safe place where i dont have to do anything or think about anything and i can just be and watch my thoughts as they come and go. It feels like climbing into bed with a warm blanket on a cold day, except for my mind. If that makes sense. üôÇ"
depression,fdf11hb,t1_fdemvw4,1578350891.0,Yes exactly!! Wow that makes so much sense
depression,fdf0vvp,t1_fdec8y5,1578350792.0,No doubt. Unfortunatley...
depression,fde8ns2,t1_fde6llo,1578333601.0,"Im not an authority on this but i guess its just my theory for my own chronic anxiety. It just doesnt make sense the way it gets so bad sometimes. I feel like early experience as a child gets very deep rooted in the mind. If many of those early experiences were negative then ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

PSA: Hug your kids. Give them what the rest of world wont most of them time. A sense of belonging."
depression,fde6b55,t3_ekpvdz,1578332130.0,Me too. I blame inadequate parenting when i was younger. I think lack of affection as children causes alot of subconscious insecurity which leads to chronic anxiety in adulthood. What do you think?
depression,fd7s7on,t1_fd73ivb,1578209281.0,"Not at all. I went through more than one mental breakdown. One in which i had to leave my job and lose my apartment. Up and downs with drug addiction and withdrawls and alcohol abuse while trying to pass my exams. Had to move back in with a mentally ill and abusive mother while dealing with my own mental issues while losing all my friends. I had to then finally pass my exams, land a job that i like and pays well, and finding a gf that cares about me. Quit all my meds and hard drugs and alcohol. Now i havea bit of financial stability, relationship stability, and health stability. Now i can say things are stable which brings me great relief. Now i feel like i have an oppurtunity to address my core issues and that one day i can finally find internal peace and happiness. I believe now one day i can achieve that.

I still have very real lows and dibilitating anxiety but i am coping with it alot better than i used to when i had suicidal ideation."
depression,fd6gwgy,t1_fd1mewe,1578190832.0,Another one is fight club which i beleive mr robot has drawn alot of inspiration from :)
depression,fd43h9n,t1_fd1mewe,1578164051.0,Lol! Thats kind of funny. Yeah i have not watched the end yet.
depression,fd1m2v5,t3_ejuzly,1578133197.0,"Mr. Robot/elliot, without a doubt, the entire series feels like he's talking about how i feel about life. I think alot of young people with deppression can relate to this character."
unpopularopinion,fd1h5dm,t3_eju5sf,1578131320.0,Very unpopular opinion lol
stopdrinking,fd1czm3,t3_eju60b,1578130007.0,"Im also 29 male with anxiety and depression. I am sober 2 days now. I feel the same way. Ive been working out ALOT. Like Until i can barley walk properly. thats the only way i can fall asleep at night. Just alot of high intensity cardio. 

I feel the same as you but remeber this: Removing alcohol only solves your alcohol problem. You stopped because it was a problem. And you probably developed this alcohol problem because you couldnt deal with other problems in your life in a constructive and effective way. These real problems are the issues that are keeping you unhappy in the longterm. You tried to mask it with alcohol and it worked temporarily. But then you needed more and more and then it back fired. It started adding more problems to your life. 

Newly sober we can now begin to work on our other problems that we couldnt fix cause we have been drinking all this time. Message me if you want to chat and maybe help each other out. Wish you the best my friend."
depression,fcxtg6j,t1_fcx29t8,1578070186.0,I understand where you're coming from and im sorry to hear that you're suffering my friend. I hope you can find some relief or atleast some comfort in your life.
Neuropsychology,fcxrpl9,t3_ejhsyi,1578069547.0,"I am no authority on this but i read a few books. Specifcally, Buddha's Brain by Richard Hanson. From what I understand it is possible but the longer the pathways have been in use, the longer and more arduous the process of creating new pathways. As the brain gets older too it becomes less able to change as well. Meditation can help this adaption process by helping us control our attention and our behavior."
depression,fcvu6px,t3_ej5p03,1578010192.0,"I think the reason its not legal for deppression is that alot of people do indeed get somewhat ""better"". I know i used to have suicidal ideation and if it were possible i would have pursued it legally without a doubt. If i made that decision though i would not be here today and who i am today is wayyyyy different than who i used to be. Although im still not perfect and i still get really down, im no where near offing myself these days. 

I guess what im trying to say is that its difficult to see any other possible scenario when you are really in the black hole that is depression. But somehow circumstances do change and we would have way too many people offing themselves way too early if it were allowed."

stopdrinking,fcsy9rf,t1_fcsebew,1577928137.0,This is a terrible addiction and its tricky cause its not everytime i over do it. I always wind up back to this place now though with all this anxiety and fear for my life!
