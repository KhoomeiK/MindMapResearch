news,ffax187,t1_ffatsan,1579746466.0,"The energy scales aren't even comparable. The mantle isn't sitting on a ledge waiting to fall off and start moving again- the only way to ""get it moving"" would be something like detonating the entire planet, then waiting for it to fall back in on itself. This is not something you could accomplish with a nuclear weapon. It would be like trying to demolish Mt. Everest with a BB-gun. Also, I don't think mars with an active mantle would necessarily be any more inhabitable than it is now. 

On the other hand, /u/rediKELous's hypothesis (which I assume he picked up from [Elon Musk](https://www.space.com/elon-musk-nuke-mars-terraforming.html)), has some merit. If you nuked the polar ice caps of mars, you might displace enough CO2 and liquid water to form a substantial atmosphere. This thicker atmosphere might heat up the planet enough to melt the remainder of the polar ice caps; this means you might only need a few nuclear bombs to get the process started. 

These gasses would eventually escape Mar's atmosphere, but it would be an incredibly slow process. It would take millions of years to thin- basically irrelevant on human time scales. This would also give humans plenty of time to come with other, more sustainable options.

Of course, this is just Elon Musk speculating. Scientists have stated that there simply isn't enough CO2 in the ice caps to make this happen, and have also raised moral concerns about nuking mars, and potentially killing life that already exists there."
Games,ffatutm,t1_ff91le6,1579744358.0,"I work in Japan at an entertainment company (games/anime/music/etc), and can attest to some of this. 

Personally, my stated work hours are 9:30-6:00. Other westerners might notice that this is 30 minutes longer than a typical 9:00-5:00, but this is actually somewhat short in Japan; most jobs are 8:00-5:00 or 10:00-7:00, with the latter being more common in the games industry. Flex hours exist at some work places, but I haven't personally experienced it. The Japanese like to claim they work a 40 hour work week, but this is because they don't count the lunch hour. 

Most of my co-workers will do at least some overtime everyday. This might mean working till 7, or it might mean working till 10. At 8, they turn the lights off and tell everyone to go home, but this is a fairly new policy that I think they use to cover their asses, since many people were (and still are) working over the legally limited 45 hours of overtime / month, and having everyone go home at 8 means they can officially say, ""there's just no way anyone is working more than that"". 

Average overtime / month is probably around 30 hours. If you're on a team with particularly bad overtime (any of the creative teams, teams working on new properties, etc), there's a good chance you're working till 9 every day, with a lot of weekend obligations and longer nights as ""necessary"". One of my office-friends switched teams, and went from working *some* overtime (he probably stayed after work to 7:00 or 8:00 a few times a month) to overtime every single day, most of it off the clock. He said that he regularly worked till 10:00-11:00, and sometimes into the morning hours, with essentially no breaks (he had events on the weekends to attend as well). 

When I probed him about this, he said that it was ""fun"", but uh... it was kind of like how Jeremiah Denton said he was being treated alright by the Vietcong, all the while blinking ""torture"". Or how a member of a cult says they love their new family after not eating for 3 days, that sort of thing. He burned out after about 6-8 months, and is headed back to our team (good for his health). 

This is probably what Japanese ""crunch"" looks like. You go from an unhealthy work life to a work life that might literally kill you, or make you want to kill yourself, depending. What's worse is that all this overtime is uncompensated; Japanese law allows companies to stipulate ""regular overtime"" in their contract, so they don't have to pay you extra until you exceed 45 hours. To make up for this, they put your base wage at around minimum, then include 45 hours of overtime at 1.25x the normal rate; the more overtime you work, the less they value your time. 

And people here are conditioned to think that is necessary and normal. If you ask them about it, they'll agree that it's bad, but they just think that that's how life is; being a responsible adult means dealing with it.

Anyway, it's a horrendous system that needs to be overhauled from the top down. The people are never going to stop working overtime if their company implies that they have to, especially if they're holding their bonus (which, in Japan, is typically 3-6 months of pay) hostage. A good start would be making ""included overtime"" illegal."

funny,ff832rg,t1_ff6zguk,1579664689.0,"I'm not sure I would believe this without a source. It sounds a lot like pseudoscience. Human bodies mostly determine hunger based on how full their stomachs are; it doesn't matter what they're full of. If you eat a plate full of Shirataki noodles, you'll feel full, despite Shirataki having no nutritional content. 

So are cats different? And how did we determine that this is the case? Presumably cats choose when and when not to eat based on the fullness of their stomachs as well, otherwise they'd run the risk of eating until their stomachs burst. 

Additionally, ""meat"" isn't a nutrient. There are things *in* meat that cats (and humans) need to survive, but you don't necessarily need to eat a certain quantity of meat to get those nutrients. Both cat and human foods are often enriched with necessary nutrients; if the food the cat is eating is nutritionally complete, it doesn't matter if it's 20% meat or 100% meat.  

I honestly find it hard to believe that cats wouldn't overeat if provided with unlimited amounts of what OP believes is ""GOOD FOOD"". To intuit how much you need to eat *only* to be healthy and nothing more would be an incredible natural ability, and also would be very out of place for creatures who traditionally did not have a reliable source of food (overeating and storing fat might be a developed trait to account for food scarcity). 

On the other hand, it makes a lot of sense that cats will eat similar volumes of food no matter what it is, as long it's available, and that more calorie dense foods would lead them to becoming fat, and nutritionally starved if the food is not nutritionally complete. 

Anyway, if you follow the principle of feeding your cat the *appropriate/recommended amount* of a food suggested by your veterinarian, they'll be happy and healthy. I wouldn't try to think about things like ""meat units"", as a heuristic like this is likely to be more harmful then helpful, especially if it makes you overlook things like how much your cat is actually eating. Most people just leave food in a bowl for their cats, rather than having a regular feeding schedule. If you do this, they're probably going to overeat; the claimed ability to feel how much meat they've eaten in a given day and decide to cut back is probably BS."

This way of thinking is particularly insidious, because while the rationale seems solid, it just doesn't work out like that in reality. I moved to a country where you are more likely to be killed by lightning than by a gun. There are less than 10 gun deaths in an average year, in a country of over 120,000,000 people. Not only that, but the intentional homicide rate is *1/27th* that of America. It's because we don't have to guess who has a gun and who doesn't- we just know that no one does.  

The Mexican-standoff theory of security needs to go away. It doesn't work in the real world. If the chance of shooting someone back was a better deterrent then gun scarcity, then gang members wouldn't be shooting at each other.

hardware,ff21fac,t1_ff1yh0o,1579491216.0,"Generally, the ""18 month"" release window is in reference to the release of new generations of cards, and not specifically a change in micro-architecture. This is important because Tesla encompassed 3-5 different GPU generations ([8000, 9000, 200] + [100, 300]), and 5 different node shrinks (all the way from 90, 80, 65, 55, 40).

GTX 280 - June 17th, 2008 

GTX 480 - March 26th, 2010 - 21 months

GTX 580 - November 9th, 2010 (Refresh) - 6 months

GTX 680 - March 22nd, 2012 - 24 months (from 480)

GTX 780 - May 23rd, 2013 - 14 months 

GTX 980 - September 18th, 2014 - 16 months

GTX 1080 - May 27th, 2016 - 20 months

GTX 2080 - September 20th, 2018 - 28 months 

The GTX 1080-2080 period was the longest wait between generations of GPUs in Nvidia's history. We are current at 15 months in this generation, meaning that a Q1 2021 (27-30 months) release would be late compared to the average (about 20 months), and probably be the new longest period between generational releases. A Q2 2021 release would be unprecedented. 

Even if we just looked at the micro-architecture numbers provided by the other poster, it would not be strange for Ampere to release in Q4 2020, which will be 24-27 months after the release of Turing (excluding Telsa and Volta, which are outliers in this set, the average is 24.5 months)."

Real time ray-tracing as it appears today is made possible by both specialized hardware and very clever implementations that reduce the number of rays that need to be processed. There is no way to get it work in real time on a generalized CPU- a CPU is not good at handling massively parallelized task.

Designing a CPU so that it could accommodate this workload would make it unable to do general tasks (it would need thousands of cores for parallelization), and likewise, making a GPU more CPU like would make it unable to do what it's designed for... in general, processing a specific set of massively parallelized computations related to rendering."

No, that's not what bail is. Generally speaking, the authorities don't want to keep you detained until your trial. They just want to make sure you show up. So if you're not a flight risk, then you don't need to go to jail. You are, after all, innocent until proven guilty. 

However, if you pose *some* flight risk, they'll set a bail. A bail is like a deposit. To ensure that you won't try to flee, they ask to hold on to a certain amount of money. If you try to run, they keep the money. If you cooperate and go to court like you're supposed to, you get it back.

The amount of that bail is based on a number of things. Richer people get higher bails, because $4k would be nothing to a millionaire.

It fits in perfectly with the missile strikes themselves. Iran launched the attack to show its people that it would not take an attack from America sitting down. However, they needed to do this in the way that was least likely to trigger an actual conflict. 

A war with the US would be disastrous. The Iranian leadership doesn't want to become the next Baathist just for the optics. They need to maintain their populations support and confidence, while avoiding the ruin that would come from picking a fight with a country whose military budget is larger than their entire GDP.  

So they launch an attack that avoids causalities. They go on state news and Twitter and saber rattle; they're talking mostly to their own people, not the US. They say that America has balked at their retaliation, proving to the Iranian people that their government is strong and confident. They say at Soleimani's funeral that his death has been avenged and now he can rest in peace. And they get to do all that without collapsing their entire economy. 

As for how the US feels about this, I'm not sure. I think that they probably consider this a rather tame outcome for assassinating a foreign general. Trump probably has his own views on this that he does not share with intelligence; you can tell he wasn't happy to be up their walking back his 'we're going to glass the desert' rhetoric. But Iran's behavior following the attacks makes it seem like they're accepting the attack on their territory, and just trying reign things in internally; they're even encouraging domestic militias not to begin military action. Overall, that's not a bad outcome for the US."

For me, buying a 3600k and compatible motherboard for around ~$300 would be a worthwhile expenditure for 2 years of vastly improved performance. Especially if we expect games to get significantly more demanding around the next generation console launch.

And, most likely, the people currently using DDR3 platforms wouldn't mind not having a cutting edge system when DDR5 comes out (after all, their current hardware is over 5 years old, and will be over 7 years old by then), so they could probably just sit on DDR4 with a more modern CPU into the DDR5 cycle, and then upgrade again after a few years."

Games,fd92q6o,t3_ek18oe,1578227538.0,"I always think this question is a lot like asking why thermometers in Mexico go down to zero when it only freezes once every few years. I think what it boils down to is a difference in perspective about what the scoring system means. A lot of people seem to believe that scores should average around 5.5/10, because that's the midpoint of the 1-10 scale. 

But most people grade movies/games/etc on an ""absolute"" scale, not a relative one. It's similar to grading a test. If you get 83% of the questions right, your grade is a 83%. They don't then say, ""Well, the average student got 83% of the questions correct, so we're going to adjust all of the scores so that 83% gets a 50/100.""

Similarly, if a game is mostly enjoyable, people will give it something like a 7/10. If there's as much good to the game as there is bad, it probably lands around a 5/10. If the game is a horrid, abysmal slog it will be 1/10; etc. I won't claim it's an exact science, but that's the line of thinking. And it makes sense to do this, really. Imagine if you tried to grade things on a relative basis, with the average being around 5.5/10. The first game you played would *have* to be a 5.5/10, because it's the average by default. If you then played a truly stellar game the next time around, it might have to go to a 1 so that the other could be a 10 (otherwise, your scale becomes imbalanced). Trying to force your average rating to be around the midpoint is in fact quite impractical, and doesn't really serve a purpose- the relative ranking of the game is still encoded in the absolute-scale, you just need to compare its score with the scores of other games.

With that in mind it makes sense that most games are going to be on the right side of the scale. Even the average game that manages to get published is probably fairly enjoyable- it's received years of development and millions in investment. A lot of the really shitty ideas or games with no general appeal get weeded out long before development ever starts. In addition, people tend to self-select for better games/movies. I don't go out and watch all of the movies I think I'll hate- I generally just go to see the ones I'm interested in from the premise. That means, if I'm any good at picking movies I'm interested in, then my average rating is going to be quite high.

So yeah, I don't see any reason to move scores towards the midpoint, and I've never been given a compelling argument as to why they should be."

gaming,fcpid2k,t1_fcotxii,1577865113.0,"I think this is because using a glitch or an exploit still feels like playing within the rules of the game, since you're just doing things that are normally allowed in the game world. Sometimes there's also a lot of skill involved in using glitches, as you can see in speed running. 

For something like Skyrim's abusable enchanting and alchemy buffs, it at least feels rewarding to *discover* that this is possible, as making the best enchantments and potions is itself a form of gameplay. The game challenges you to find the right materials, choose the right skills, and use the right equipment to make your character as powerful as possible within the systems it provides you; and that's exactly what you're doing when you exploit this mechanic. 

The devs know that a lot of players can't really resist the temptation to make the strongest character possible, and if that character is too strong, there's a good chance it could spoil the rest of their experience. That's why devs tend to patch exploits like this, even in single player games. As an example, I'm pretty sure that the max skill boosts in the latest version of Skyrim and SSE are all capped to prevent this."

politics,fc4vcl3,t1_fc4q072,1577429911.0,"Yeah, this type of hand-wavey argument might work in a 4chan style circle jerk, but just shouting the three things you know about Europe and pretending these are somehow bigger problems than all of the things the US is facing is not a convincing argument. Like, just calling the strikes ""crippling"" or using the word ""Brexit"" doesn't somehow make the UK or France worse than the US; if that were the case, I could just say ""most gun deaths in the world"", ""highest homicide rate among developed nations"", ""most medical related bankruptcies"", ""children in literal cages"", ""rampant racism"" or something like that and boom, automatically the US is the worst nation on Earth. 

And yes, the US should try to be more like France or the UK in a number of ways; adopting their incredibly efficient healthcare systems, or vastly improving workers benefits would be a good start. If you're sitting here and in the back of your head, you're thinking, ""Man, I wish I could have 1.5 months of paid vacation each year and still have an excellent quality of living"", then the answer isn't to get irrationally mad and convince yourself that the US is the best place on Earth and everyone else must be bullshitting."
politics,fc4uq19,t1_fc4t863,1577429174.0,"Some parts of your rant I agree with, others not so much. Americans who have only ever lived in America are ridiculously dramatic about the state of America, insofar as they compare it to places that are objectively much worse off; saying America is ""as bad as China"" just shows you don't have a very good grasp of how bad things are in China (in regards to personal liberties, democracy, human rights) right now, for example. 

Your stab at universal health care in Europe though, I don't agree with at all. Every country with a similar level of development to the US that implements universal health has a [much more efficient healthcare system](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-19/u-s-near-bottom-of-health-index-hong-kong-and-singapore-at-top) than the US with [equal or comparable quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_quality_of_healthcare). So yes, it is full of amazing results in Europe if we consider comparable economies (Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, Austria, Norway, Denmark, France...) and outside of Europe as well (SK, Japan, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Canada). 

The US has great quality of healthcare, but in most cases it's *only as good* as comparably developed countries with universal healthcare, and much, much less efficient."

A lot of people wondered why Congress and the media were using the words ""quid pro quo"" and not ""bribery"" or ""extortion""- it's because quid pro quo wasn't the crime, it was part of proving that a crime was committed. If Trump had withheld military aid for a valid reason, and notified congress/received approval, it would not have been illegal. The issue is that he withheld aid because he wanted something out of it, and he wanted to use the aid as leverage to get what he wanted- that was where the focus on quid pro quo came from."
