We already have protective order laws on the books that _already_ do everything this proposed law _claims_ it will do but can't, by design.

amateurradio,fdktplt,t1_fdiji2t,1578510953.0,"Here's how I did the math:

To knock 100W down to 1 mW, you need a reduction of 100000x or 50dB.

Assuming your RF sample equipment is high impedance, I want 1 mW to be dissipated in the 50 ohm resistor at the bottom the divider. That means the current thru that resistor must be 4.5 mA (P=I^2 R, .001 = I^2 (50) = 0.0045).

100W across 50 ohms (I assume that's you characteristic impedance) at the J1/J2 circuit is 1.414A and 70.7 V (P=I^2 R again, with V=IR for V). 

Given that current, the total resistance of the divider must must satisfy 70.7 = I*Rtotal, where Rtotal = Rupper + the 50 ohms at the bottom.

Working that out, you get Rtotal = 15711. At 100W, the whole resistor chain dissipates P=I^2 Rtotal Watts, or 0.32 Watts. 

If you go with a standard 5% 16k resistor, it must be capable of about 1/3 W dissipation - a 1/2 watt would do fine. The 50 ohm at the bottom can be as small as (you guessed to) 1mW or so."
