2: Even with computers, it's not 100% accurate and usually needs at least a few shots to get it just right"
Warthunder,ff1glqg,t1_ff1fqu1,1579478908.0,"The only AAA that uses computers to aim is heavy AA, which you don't really find on land. It's mostly cruisers, battleships and carriers that have them. The ones on land are most smaller ones operated by a few soldiers whoanually adjusts the gun."
Warthunder,ff1erov,t1_ff0isxx,1579478276.0,"Well you still need to predict how much to lead the planes. If you don't lead enough, the shells will fall behind the plane. If you lead too much, the shell will go past the plane in front."

My Reddit is u/werstreddituserever because I didn't know it's called a Redditor but I don't know how to change my u/ without making a new account or if it's even possible so I just keep it that way. I shorten my usernames to just Werst_______ now"
