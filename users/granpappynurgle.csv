My deck names are not even remotely lore friendly. 

When I slap something together, I’ll keep the default name until I’m ready to ladder with it. By then it will have “earned” its name. 

I also specifically name my “net decks” as you can see.

I’ll also name my challenge decks based on the challenge that they are designed for."
AskMenOver30,fdn4tfe,t3_em5b7s,1578577298.0,"I recommend:

- Replacing ""permanent"" ideas in your inner-monologue with ""impermanent"" ideas. For example, replace ""I am an idiot"" with ""I have made mistakes in the past, but I will do my best not to make them again.” For more information, check out [Learned Optimism](https://www.amazon.com/Learned-Optimism-Change-Your-Mind/dp/1400078393)

- Studying Buddhism or Stoicism. You can watch youtube videos and listen to podcasts on it. They teach you ""hows"" and ""whys"" to help you stay in the present and focus on improving yourself and your situation."

AskMen,fcytg9u,t3_ejds1d,1578086711.0,"Rejection is good. Rejection means that you know for sure that it isn't going to happen with your crush, so you no longer have to waste time, effort, and thoughts on her and you can move on. 

Remember that being rejected isn't an objective assessment of your personal worth. It just means that it wasn't a good fit. There are tons, TONS of amazing women out there, and this rejection means that you are now open to them.

I suggest that you give yourself time to get over this and then get back out there and meet some people. Get rejected more. The more practice you get, the better you will be at dating, and the better your relationships will be."
