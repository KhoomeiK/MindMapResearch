ADHD,ffbt3z7,t1_ffbsyrp,1579781764.0,"No, I won't be taking another today though since I had two yesterday to balance it out. I'll still take one a day afterword + particularly on school days"
ADHD,ffbssdh,t1_ffbsda5,1579781404.0,I'm not gonna take anymore I didn't like the side effects it gave me. I don't even drink alcohol it tastes like shit and even when other people try to get me drunk I can't stand it. I don't have an addictive personality.
ADHD,ffbqyn9,t1_ffbo56j,1579779220.0,"I'm not going to abuse it, I've already researched side effects of medications like this and Adderall and I sure as hell don't want any health problems from it. My mom actually told me to take 2 instead of one because she wanted me to get a higher dose"
Dreams,ff1yf3e,t1_ff1vnx1,1579489050.0,"no clue, but the last one is so ridiculous it just makes me crack up"
Dreams,fewofa0,t1_few6dok,1579417006.0,"I’m not scared of anything bad happening, more like time is running out and I really haven’t done anything at all but yeah the dream is making more sense now I think"
Dreams,few48ja,t1_fevz4am,1579405140.0,Hm idk I’m 16 so it’s possible although I found the antelope and wolf part odd
Dreams,fevu7br,t1_fevthcj,1579401559.0,"Nope nothings triggered any vulnerability maybe it was just a weird dream, but it seems too weird lol"
Subliminal,feuxdo9,t3_eqm0fc,1579390915.0,For some reason binaural beats work better for me
Schizoid,feuxba9,t1_feoxs83,1579390893.0,"It just makes me extremely angry, that people would view me as a sexual object and not a person and projecting onto me and fantasizing about me. It makes me want to rip their head off. It’s repulsive and primal."
astrology,feosmkq,t3_eq678m,1579304846.0,Or you could just feel like shit and it’s not because you’re  a Scorpio moon
Schizoid,feosjfr,t1_femxbly,1579304796.0,Because people are creepy that’s why
Dreams,fejqfy9,t3_epcmh5,1579183238.0,The song sounded so good too :(
astrology,fehnw4s,t1_fehl374,1579120352.0,"Same but without the acceptance part and bullying, I want to have a lot of friends but it’s frustrating because it’s hard for me to make new ones and if I do they’re usually users or extremely immature"
astrology,fehnsem,t1_fehd7ci,1579120293.0,"I have the same placement, hard to make friends and the few that I have are clingy, immature, act like children and are really emotional. Loyal as well though I don’t like it"
Schizoid,feezo7b,t3_eolq7r,1579044766.0,That’s scary I’d be worried if someone asked me that they’d jerk off to it later or something
OCD,fedd4gw,t3_emx0gh,1579008127.0,I inhale it to get the mold off my brain
OCD,fe5msjp,t1_fdpxkz2,1578871494.0,"I just got recommended this sub and I do this all the time what the fuck, it’s like a shut up war between my brain and me"
Beastars,fdted3j,t1_fdt7vh3,1578715554.0,Well you follow a beastars porn sub so yea I can see why
cogsci,fdsq2oi,t3_emq515,1578706473.0,Wow they made an article about me
LeftTheBurnerOn,fdk2onu,t1_fdix8no,1578494585.0,>probably to sound like a victim and then have some random person defend them for attention
astrology,fdk03en,t1_fdjxp6l,1578492685.0,Yep I’m 16
astrology,fdjwzom,t1_fdjqr9s,1578490182.0,"Yeah I haven’t really been able to find it since, I transitioned from public school to home school and then some college level classes and it’s been difficult for me to make one friend that sticks much less a group"
SkincareAddiction,fdjtcb5,t3_elj8m4,1578486783.0,Thank you
astrology,fdjq9s5,t3_el0mcb,1578483272.0,"Not Pluto itself, though my Sun and Mercury square Pluto and Mars and Uranus quintile my Pluto. Ever since I left that group environment I haven’t been the same, not as extroverted and carefree as I was. So I think leaving that all certainly changed me permanently."
astrology,fdjntrq,t1_fdh7wdg,1578479971.0,"Meh it’s more the other way around, I attract friends with problems and I’ll have best friends but they’ll split off and go a separate way. I’ve accepted that nothing lasts and my friendships are likely to die even if they last for years. Usually I’m the one to help or introduce new things into their life or be the person they rely on. But in the past I did feed off of the happy energy of being in a group, haven’t been one in awhile but it did charge me up."
astrology,fdi6eer,t1_fdhel9u,1578436544.0,What’s it like for you? I noticed my friend has it in her chart but she doesn’t seem like someone who would
astrology,fdi6cti,t1_fdhsaq8,1578436521.0,"I don’t do anything out of the ordinary, they were just stuff like having to leave public school and transitioning to home school suddenly and being isolated then having to get over social anxiety and other things"
astrology,fdh50co,t1_fdh2xlz,1578415512.0,"Oh I just meant Jupiter ruling the 11th house in response to their question, I can’t ever really put my finger on as to what Pluto in the 11th means regardless since Pluto is such a heavy planet and then it’s placed in a more light and friendship-y type of house."
astrology,fdggg54,t3_el0mcb,1578395686.0,"I’m still trying to understand what Pluto in the 11th house means

But I’d assume it’s because Jupiter rules it, it’s also for friendships and connections though"
astrology,fdesk9m,t1_fdeoc6o,1578345720.0,"Relatable, I'm only 16 and already had 3 transformations, one of them being pretty Tower moment life-intervening so I'm not very excited about the others but at least with these placements you'll know afterword that you'll be okay after it eventually."
astrology,fdeixa3,t1_fddz6jc,1578340001.0,"Ah how interesting, draconic charts are really intriguing. Except for me mine is more like the epitome of what I wish I could be not exactly who I am it’s weird"
astrology,fdeitrl,t1_fddznzu,1578339941.0,"I have Venus in libra in 8th too I’ve been offered before but I’d feel guilty to take it

So it’s probably entirely possible lol"
cats,fddygc6,t3_eksg1x,1578327024.0,I like your nails
Dreams,fdcxs8j,t3_eklxr1,1578287465.0,Looks like a fork in the path
astrology,fcwxnso,t3_ej9tzk,1578042030.0,"Yea I just took a 5 hour nap and another 4 hour nap before it lol

Probably just the mold though"
menwritingwomen,fcw6vpf,t3_ej3udn,1578018517.0,Her pruned toenails were “perfect to suit any pedophile”
astrology,fcuynhx,t1_fcukaq1,1577991143.0,"Mine is in 1st house Aquarius nearly in the second as well lol basically people can project their fantasies onto us or may be likely to idealize us as something we aren’t or the standard of something, perhaps not having a firm understanding of who you are and constantly searching for an answer as to who you are, also an indicator of big green/blue/grey eyes, dreamy looking, perceptive to the environment , etc"
astrology,fcskvss,t1_fcsd344,1577918655.0,I think your alcoholism affects you immeasurably lol

cats,fc15s3b,t1_fc15kok,1577309061.0,"She’s alright, she has weird Persian genetics. One of her sisters is small like hers too while her brothers are huge. We think she’s a runt but we feed her extra bottle to help her grow."
TrollMUA,fbzbsko,t3_efah4z,1577241468.0,So cool!
