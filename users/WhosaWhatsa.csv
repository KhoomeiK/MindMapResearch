Ii'm getting this error for a value formatted like this ""810 /  20 /, 1015 /  48 /"":

Error in .f(.x\[\[i\]\], ...) : <text>:2:0: unexpected end of input 1: 810 /  20 /  


EDIT: the hat that indicates the problematic character is under the 8 in the error message. I can't figure out how to format that in reddit's comment box."

datascience,fd2sozr,t1_fd2eyd7,1578151312.0,"I'm just one person. But so far I'd say no. We can learn how to use the tools well. Even with a data science job I still hit datacamp everyday to keep my SQL, python, r and git functions and syntax sharp. You have to know how to use your tools. I data mine, model, segment, a/b test, predict, clean, and all that using these tools. 

However, the domain is the other 65%. I work in finance, which means my work is pointed at social science concepts... socioeconomic behavior in terms of financial instruments and contexts. I did not have this background before I started as I was in linguistics. So I learn the theory, read papers, TALK with as many COLLEAGUES as possible. After all, it's their work and business I'm analyzing. 

I engineer variables more appropriately after these conversations. My dashboards are more used after these conversations. My models generally yield better metrics after these conversations. My work is more appreciated. 

DS folks dig into the technical programming and mathematics because we have been cultured to via the internet. DS professional development was born of the internet. So the discourse lends itself to topics more aligned with internet culture. Interpersonal skills are not emphasized here. But from what I've experienced, those are the skills you need to get your work accepted and to learn about your domain. That generally happens in an actual job as it is very difficult to simulate in a class."

statistics,fcsq64v,t3_eiky8o,1577922307.0,"Started as a factor analysis of a key customer decision (0,1) for my business' services. It's a data mining project really. Two databases and one sas drive of tables that I joined using SQL and R. 

Started with some basic cleaning and transformations to align with business processes. Then to a collinearity assessment since all IVs are continuous and a best subset algorithm using AIC as a selection criteria. 

Then onto a supervised clustering using a recursive partitioning decision tree just to help stakeholders understand some useful ways to think about their customer base. Helped build a tableau dash for each terminal leaf which seems like an effective way for your stakeholders to do some EDA after they see their business processes in terms of decision tree logic. They can assign names to the resulting terminal leaves and it engages them a bit more. 

Now I'm using a random forest for prediction but I think we may need to access another database with more time-based behavioral data of customers. The AUC is not all that impressive for the RF and I think this other database may have what we need. 

We'll see if any of this works toward actionable business decisions."

statistics,fcid77t,t1_fci9oal,1577660799.0,"Excuse me, yes it is discrete not continuous. But there is not enough context to know if a mean is appropriate as the central location measure. 

It certainly depends on the question

statistics,fchrpc6,t1_fcgx802,1577653409.0,"Then it is basically discrete count data but may not mean a lot when you take an average depending on what you want to infer from it. The median may be the best location measure in that case.

Edit: not continuous but discrete"
statistics,fcguhoa,t3_eh88ab,1577644100.0,"Raw, it's a discrete count data, but is it capped at 7 or is that just the natural range of the data? If it is capped at 7, you could consider looking at it a few ways. 

Look at your dist. If it is not terribly skewed, consider the mean. But if skewed look at the median. 

Also consider that the distribution could be Poisson if it is related to counts over time... where the expected value and the variance are equal. There are tests to verify this."
statistics,fc9embh,t1_fc80or1,1577551506.0,"There is an actual limitation to repeating social science experiments in many cases. Physics, for example, is a matter of natural law and lends itself to more reproducible results in many contexts (country, language, economic status). Social sciences are so socially contextual that reproducing results may be very challenging and require far far more funding than a natural science experiment.  Imagine having to reproduce a linguistic experimental result across all languages just so you can say it was a reproducible result. The result isn't valued enough to pour that investment into it."

But how effective are certain educational methods? Right... It's not that simple regardless of the quality of your statisticians. The interactions that cause one educational outcome over another are overwhelming. And how to measure this outcome? 

I've oversimplified it all here, certainly. But generally in hard sciences, many of the rules/parameters are consistent. In social sciences, not so much."

statistics,fc0989p,t1_fbzqutm,1577283710.0,"First, I get where you are coming from. But without context, it's challenging to know how much depth to go into. To what degree should each test be explained for such a general question? Should a paper be referenced each time? Talk to the mods on that one. 

Second, the post is about the difference between the two test, not the origin story of each. And while incomplete, I provided some key differences on their uses. 

Third, these tests are tools for certain situations and need to be adapted to situations with unclear parameters, etc. In fact, their uses have all been adjusted for certain purposes after extensive simulation. So of you prefer that I say a test ""can"" be used for x or y rather than ""is"" used for x or y, I get where you're coming from. But again, talk to the mods if you want the standards to be yours. 

Mann Whitney U is quite general and nonparametric for assessing distribution location. And it differs, at the very least in part, from Welch in the way I mentioned."

After that, consider feature engineering and clustering approaches before modeling. 

All of these steps require subject matter expertise to some degree. But they are all standard data mining techniques for dimensionality reduction.

Finally, consider a random forests or xgboost over the options you mentioned if you think trees are appropriate. Those may yield more actual predictive accuracy. But they won't be as easy to understand for your stakeholders if you have some."
