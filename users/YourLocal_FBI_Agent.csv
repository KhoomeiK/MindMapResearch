I don't care about pokémon, haven't done so for over a decade. But this looks so generic, there's a couple of ""temtem's"" popping up in a row that look like type variations of the same creature, four legged dog with grass on it, four legged dog which is gray which i guess means rocks and so on. 

Temtem sounds like something a kindergartner would come up with. I super don't care if this is the most successful game series of all time forever, but change the name to something better please guys! The instant hype also makes me a bit suspicious, it's like the bot accounts activated all at once."
