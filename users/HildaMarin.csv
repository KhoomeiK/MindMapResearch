So, if they wanted to work 8 hrs *at the community college teaching calculus* (OMG I wish they had done this; also you realize that you're going to get a full ride scholarship to any Ivy League you want with this CV right?) instead of 4 on some job day the key would just be not to have that be a school day.

At some point I asked, ""When do I get the results of this test?"" ""You don't."" ""Why am I taking this test then?"" ""The state requires it."" ""Is my grade affected?"" ""No."" At that point I stopped cooperating. I just zoned out during testing week and turned in a blank test. Years later as an adult I got my transcripts and found the test scores of the state standardized tests at last and found that before I stopped cooperating, I had the highest possible scores for every test, across the board, which was unheard of. So I was smart. And a smart kid is going to at a certain point say ""This is bullshit, the system is crap, and none of these people know what they are doing."" That's bad because at that point the smart kid checks out. Some never return. I made my way back. Pointless repeated standardized testing harms kids.

With my kids when they got a 5 on each AP test (they got a 5 on all of them), they got $500. And a 4 or a 3 was worth... nothing. But I didn't even tell them the rules ahead of time. I just made sure that for the trouble they went to afterwards they saw it was appreciated. Likewise 800 on a SAT subject test is worth $800, and a 790 is worth... nothing. 36 on the ACT is worth $3600 and a 35 is worth... nothing.

Anyway this isn't about regular grading and evaluation though of material, but about standardized state and national tests. Feedback is useful. I never ever ever got feedback with the state tests I took. None. It was completely pointless. And even with my exemplary scores it didn't stop my schools from going completely apeshit and coming down hard on me when I started turning in politically or religiously incorrect opinions in essays.

In my state they require standardized testing of all homeschoolers. And homeschoolers, like in all states that have mandatory testing like this, kick the absolute ass of public school students, scoring in the 85th percentile. But they didn't even catch us because we, like a lot of the smartest homeschooling families, managed to create legal structures to exempt ourselves from the testing by not being categorized as  homeschoolers at all. We have a private school that's exempt from testing requirements. Which is good because one of the tests is they want in high school us to take final tests at the high school for the subjects we are covering in homeschool. My curriculum has absolutely nothing to do with theirs and such a test is completely pointless.

I do however have them go and take SAT subject tests when appropriate because colleges like to see those."

For the purpose of college, yeah, they don't care about my subjective opinion, and so at *that* point standardized national tests by an independent third party like ACT/SAT is great.

While using pi as given, or approximated (some ancients used fractions like 22/7 as being good enough) is useful for some problems way before one can understand the theory.

I personally prefer to teach practical skills way ahead of where they are presented with full justification. Trigonometry is extremely useful for day to day projects without knowing how to calculate values of trigonometric functions from scratch using arithmetic and series, or how those series were derived. Having learned the usefulness then when the background is presented the students have motivation. It's not just some weird abstract stuff.

With science I like to look at the historical background of discoveries. Why do we think there are atoms made up of certain subatomic particles? What experiments did we actually do that lead to those conclusions? I've found that students have difficulty with this one as a first approach to a science field. It does well though as a second semester class.

I saw your other post about giving students bad information in the hopes they will figure it out. I am not sure that is a great idea when the bad idea is subtle. But useful when the claims clearly controvert the status quo beliefs. I like to insist to students that the earth is flat, and debunk all their claims that it is not.

In-state school might run $10-15k tuition, $10-15k dorms, $10-15k expenses (books, transportation, phone, internet). So $30-$45k for a budget choice per year. If the school is out of your home state, double the tuition. If a private school figure might be $50-$100k tuition plus the $20k expenses.

However, the thing is that these are prices for out of state, foreign, and students with poor academic achievement but rich parents.

If your parents are very poor your in state college might waive all tuition fees altogether, and might even through in free room and board.

If your achievement scores and GPA are very good, then you'll typically see most or all your tuition covered by a scholarship. That still leaves $20k or so the typical middle class family will still have to cover per year at a so-so college.

If you are going to the top 5 schools, you are only getting in if you are extremely high performing, and those schools might have $75,000 a year tuition, but they cover $70,000 of that with a scholarship if your family income is under say $200,000 a year.

Through the magic of nondischargable student loans, guaranteed by the government. Government guarantees you'll get 4 years of loans at a fairly high rate of interest (considerably more than a mortgage or that you can earn in a savings account) in return for which the loan can never be discharged in bankruptcy court.

Notice the teen birth rates for asians in particular. Also note that births to 18 and 19 yr olds are technically teens in all these studies, but they never look at if they are married or not.

The declines are incredible. What are the reasons? The CDC states:

> Although reasons for the declines are not totally clear, **evidence suggests these declines are due to more teens abstaining from sexual activity, and more teens who are sexually active using birth control than in previous years.**

Abstinence only education is fairly dead and has been for years. Is any school district still going with that approach? Telling teens what to do has always been a bad idea since many will rebel. Teens know what sex is and what causes pregnancy. They have access to the internet. Internet access has a lot to do with the decline. As societies advance fertility rates tend to plummet of their own accord. Quite a bit intentionally. Sex is not as interesting as video games, porn, sports, and trying to get into a good college. We're in something of a post-sex society. Japan leading the way on this.

Who is still at risk? The poor and disadvantaged. Not enough interesting things to do. Not fast enough computers. Maybe no internet access. Boredom leads to teen pregnancy.

CDC again:

> Less favorable socioeconomic conditions, such as low education and low income levels of a teen’s family, may contribute to high teen birth rates. Teens in child welfare systems are at higher risk of teen pregnancy and birth than other groups. For example, young women living in foster care are more than twice as likely to become pregnant than those not in foster care.

Yeah foster care. That system is really bad. A lot of foster parents are sexually and physically abusive. Kids are knocked around from home to home. Some crack."

I do agree that abstinence-only education is absurd, agenda oriented, ineffective, and counterproductive though.

The overall trend in the US for some time though has been a massive decrease in teen pregnancies.

Tons of people take this route.

So my advice is similar to others. Except, don't bother with the GED *unless* the community college requires it for admission. Most don't. GED is for people that need a high school diploma equivalent for employment purposes, not for people who want to go to college. The community college may under your state law have requirements you would have gotten from high school but don't have, such as 2 years of a foreign language and US history.

Regarding education, neither parent has a degree homeschooling families are in the 83rd percentile, both have a degree are in the 90th percentile. Both again dramatically better than non-homeschooled.

Amount of money spent also very little correlation with outcome. Families spending $600 and up per student annually at 89th percentile, below $600 at 86th percentile. Interesting especially given that average spent on public schooling is over $10k per student, again resulting in 50th percentile overall. Then again we're not including the cost of the teacher's salary for the work in homeschooling or the homeschool's ""student lunch program"", gas costs, heating for the house, etc. if one parent forgoes a career that would have paid $60k in order to homeschool and educates 2 students then there's at least a hidden $30k annual cost per student in there for homeschooling.

Also lacking much of a correlation is homeschooling in a high regulation state vs low regulation, both about the same.

The only thing that there is a negative correlation on compared to expectations is whether or not the homeschooling parent is a certified teacher. Certified teachers produce slightly worse results than parents without that training. But it's not statistically significant.

> What about University?

Homeschoolers generally do better at University than others.

Interesting trivia - did you know some top schools like MIT don't care at all if you have a high school diploma? Or a GED for that matter. It's not much of a factor in admissions. So you could do some totally different curriculum or set of projects and might have a chance there. Of course without a more standard curriculum, one weakens their chances at some other colleges. MIT has said they are doing ""inverted admissions"" for Masters programs. Take your entire first semester for free online. Then they look at how you did and admit you based on that. Or actually, they admit 100% of applicants, then kick 99% of them out of the program after a semester. Inverted admissions! Similar approach can be done for undergrad but is not formalized, with various accounts of kids being admitted at age 15 based on having spent years mastering MIT classes and demonstrating their skills online, applying with that and a portfolio. And if they don't get admitted there, they are in a way better position to get admitted elsewhere since those classes are extremely hard.

That is, low-regulation states experienced neither more nor less abuse of homeschool students than medium-regulation and high-regulation states; none of the regulation categories was significantly different from the other categories. The lack of a correlation undermines the claim that there is some causal relationship between state control of homeschooling and abuse of students. In this analysis, there was no significant correlation between regulation and homeschool abuse.

Child abuse is illegal in all 50 states. Measures to reduce child abuse and increase prosecution are welcome. Targeting homeschoolers for regulation does not make sense as a solution to child abuse because homeschoolers are less likely to be abused to begin with, and second there is no connection between increased regulation and reduced abuse when evaluated nationally."

This is covered in ""Personal Finance"", which is now a graduation requirement in many states. There's a great Khan Academy section covering the typical curriculum.

> cooking, proper diets

Home Economics used to be a common near-requirement for girls. Rather than make it a requirement for boys as well many schools just dropped it altogether. I think that was a mistake. It should be offered, and a requirement, unless the student can show they are a trust fund baby that will always have servants taking care of them. Then they can be excused. Some high schools though now have a class called something like ""Health and Nutrition"", which is a subset of Home Economics, generally missing sewing, time management, and most but not all of the cooking content. Many colleges have a similar class. Some even make it a requirement.

> and the importance of mental health.

A lot of high schools offer AP Psychology or other psychology classes as an elective. I think it's a good idea to offer these."

* A demographically wide variety of people homeschool – these are atheists, Christians, and Mormons; conservatives, libertarians, and liberals; low-, middle-, and high-income families; black, Hispanic, and white; parents with Ph.D.s, GEDs, and no high-school diplomas. One study shows that 32 percent of homeschool students are Black, Asian, Hispanic, and others (i.e., not White/non-Hispanic) (Noel, Stark, & Redford, 2013).
* Families engaged in home-based education are not dependent on public, tax-funded resources for their children’s education. The finances associated with their homeschooling likely represent over $27 billion that American taxpayers do not have to spend, annually, since these children are not in public schools.
* Taxpayers spend an average of $11,732 per pupil annually in public schools, plus capital expenditures. Taxpayers spend nothing on most homeschool students and homeschool families spend an average of $600 per student annually for their education.
* The home-educated typically score 15 to 30 percentile points above public-school students on standardized academic achievement tests. (The public school average is the 50th percentile; scores range from 1 to 99.) A 2015 study found Black homeschool students to be scoring 23 to 42 percentile points above Black public school students (Ray, 2015).
* Homeschool students score above average on achievement tests regardless of their parents’ level of formal education or their family’s household income.
* Whether homeschool parents were ever certified teachers is not related to their children’s academic achievement.
* **Degree of state control and regulation of homeschooling is not related to academic achievement.**
* The home-educated are doing well, typically above average, on measures of social, emotional, and psychological development. Research measures include peer interaction, self-concept, leadership skills, family cohesion, participation in community service, and self-esteem.
* Adults who were home educated are more politically tolerant than the public schooled in the limited research done so far."
homeschool,fcau8nf,t1_fcaezi4,1577576721.0,"I mentioned coal as part of the history of my mom's childhood home since I thought it was interesting that their dirt pit house became a combination refrigerator/coal storage once their shack was built.

I currently heat with coal or wood, using a combination coal/wood stove, when it is particularly cold. Oil heaters if only nippy. The coal I just get myself from an open coal seam on my property. Seems like there is huge amounts of coal nearly everywhere and free for the taking. One of the major energy costs in homes is heating particularly during winter, my cost is only labor plus the electric cost of running the distribution fan on the coal oven. Monthly energy cost stays under $50. In Spring through Fall it's generally under $15. Went down when I sealed up leaks and fixed gaps and such, the main heat loss was from cold air coming in."
homeschool,fca91xp,t3_eg383b,1577564949.0,"OK, so you were raised in England, presumably rural england, possibly a long time ago, with no electricity or running water. No doubt there was an outdoor toilet and you used a chamberpot at night or when the snow drifts outside were too deep.

How common is this experience in modern western nations at present?

It's very uncommon.

How common in the third world at present? Very common.

How common was this experience in my parent's generation in, say, the US?

It was the most common experience for rural people. And uncommon for city people though since cities need waste disposal and sewers and the like or people die of cholera.

My mother was born in the US in a ""dugout"" which is a pit dwelling. You dig a hole in the ground and build up a bern around it, then cover it with tree trunks and branches and then build mud on top of that, and get grass to grow back on that. Not suitable for areas where it rains all the time though. This dwelling was a common starter home at the time for rural newlywed farmers in her area. Eventually they built a two room home which could only be described as a shack and the pit became their cellar where they stored food items and kept their supply of heating coal kind of dry. The shack was made of rough hewn wood and when it snowed hard they would awaken with snow partially covering their beds. She would then go to the root cellar outside with her coal bucket, bring it in, and get the stove going in the morning. Most of the day and year was spent toiling in the fields. But she also went to a public school. This was a 1 room schoolhouse. As she was the top student it was soon her job to teach all the lower grades because that's how things worked.

So there you go, public school and the living conditions you describe. Obviously there is no connection between going to public school or homeschool and living as you mention.

In the US at present it is not common for kids to live without electricity or a toilet or running water. Unless you are an undocumented immigrant kid whose parents work in the fields, along with you. These kids don't go to school at all. Or if you are a homeless kid living with your parents in a car or under a bridge, or you've colonized an abandoned town out in the middle of nowhere. I have personally seen and interacted with people in all of these circumstances. Unusual these days but it still happens.

Is it bad? Among one family of undocumented kids who never went to school a single day as a minor, but worked in the fields, most went to community college and university after age 18. One is a school teacher now making over $100k according to public records. Another is a paramedic, another a registered nurse.

Of the kids who squatted in abandoned apocalyptic towns, they seem to have done ok and developed good survival and farming skills.

The homeless kids ... I don't know. Many bad results there as these kids have PTSD. But you hear about people who end up doing ok. One who ended up going some place like Harvard wrote a book about her experience. Might have been a movie as well."
education,fbwokoz,t1_fbwntiw,1577155313.0,"I don't know what is normal.

What I teach is precalculus starting in grade 7. That is a composite course of algebra, geometry and trigonometry which takes 1-2 years to complete, after which students then enter AP Calculus BC. I've had good results with it, but I'm a disparaged crazy person according to many.

Calculus is super cool and fun, by the way, and highly useful for other subjects and life in general. You just need to be able to do algebra well and trigonometry pretty well in advance."
