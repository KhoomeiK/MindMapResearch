Again you're calling actual animal abuse ""milk"" and ""petty grievances"", euphemisms.

Milk means a forcefully impregnated cow, a calf that is taken away so you can take the mothers milk. The calf is either going to be raped as soon as possible or just murdered right away. This process is repeated until the cow is worth more dead and is killed and slaughtered.

By saying ""milk"" and reducing it to nothing but the act of buying a drink you ignore everything that happened in its production. How convenient because that shit is animal abuse, which you just don't want to acknowledge.

[Look at the numbers](https://animalclock.org/) and tell me it's not a genocide. It's a fucking crazy mass murder. But you can't acknowledge it.

2 290 000 000 animals in the US *this year* and we're just halfway through fucking January!!!

And I'm so ready for you becoming pedantic, telling me that ""genocide"" is a term for humans, as if that justified *anything* and wasn't completely beside the point.

> On a deserted island I’m not going to question humanities need to stop relying on red meat, I’m going to eat the deer I killed.

I'm guessing then that every single day that you're *not* on a deserted island you are eating plant-based because it's not some crazy emergency situation and you clearly have the choice not to support harmful behaviour towards animals. Am I right?

We don't even need meat, millions of healthy vegans and even vegan top athletes are proof of that. There's studied nutritionists who are vegan for decades and perfectly healthy. We don't need meat.

>Or really any pack animal that hunts together.  Or any animal that uses resources to build things, like beavers and birds.

Those species are not actually using tools to hunt or build. They never discovered fire nor did they cook their food, develop speech let alone developed society.

Look at the biology of a lion, look at wolves, bears, look at those species that actually evolutionary developed biology to kill. Do you honestly think we're just the same? With teeth made for ripping apart flesh? And claws etc?

Of course our species hunted animals for survival, we also used tools made out of stone and now build skycrapers. That isn't part of evolution!

I can only think of [this comic](https://pics.me.me/what-people-seem-to-think-a-human-is-when-who-60841200.png) when reading your comments.

WTF,fed029j,t1_fecznq4,1578991938.0,">It's been years since I studied and read about this stuff, but there are studies that show human brain development is directly tied to hunting success and the diet of meat in early hominids. Basically the nutrient rich food we could secure by hunting allowed our brains to grow bigger and more developed, which helped us be better at hunting, and it's a cycle and feedback loop. 

The scientific consensus I've heard is that while meat definitely played a role in our species evolution, it was primarily cooked food that allowed more developed brains.

WTF,feczp0j,t1_fecyz8h,1578991435.0,"You realise you just gave me a definition of ""predator"" that includes basically every single animal right?

And you're still comparing humans to lions, who fucking kill prey with their mouth. Humans *never* did that.

When our early ancestors were hunting they used tools, which is already a technological advancement no other species could do.

Why are you still comparing humans to lions, you could just as well compare them to the fucking gazelle, because they also ""kill organisms""

The number of organisms killed has nothing to do with how much a species is a predator. And for us humans it's due to the technological superiority of humans l. It's down to NOTHING ELSE but that"
WTF,feczazh,t1_fecywc4,1578990919.0,">no it's not, that is our biology. We are biologically designed to work together, to communicate, to use tools, and to hunt.

No species is ""designed to use tools"". Evolution does not work that way. By using tools we have so to speak one upped evolution and gone around it.

>The only reason human society developed as it did was because people were forced to come together and work in communities in order to hunt

This is wrong. The neolithic Revolution which is commonly seen as the ""beginning"" of society was *not about hunting*. It's communication and working in groups that were crucial in developing society, and these are also needed for hunting, but you are twisting it as if hunting lead to developed society. That is not the case.

>Look at how chimps hunt. They work in groups using some to chase the prey to others waiting in ambush. That's very likely how early humans hunted.

I'm aware, but now what? This doesn't change the unethical nature of how we treat animals of certain species.

The questions of early homini development are definitely interesting, but don't have a place in discussing neither [ethics](https://philpapers.org/rec/MCPACF) nor [environmental impact](https://youaretheirvoice.com/pages/the-daunting-facts#Agriculture) of industrial scale farming done today"
