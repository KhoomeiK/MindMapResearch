**Answer:** Your problem is not at all an uncommon one. However, it does require careful attention. The type of feeling that you have toward boys is probably not an innate tendency, but something that has been culturally acquired. Your reasons for adopting this habit have now been consciously suppressed or unconsciously repressed. Therefore, it is necessary to deal with this problem by getting back to some of the experiences and circumstances that lead to the habit. In order to do this I would suggest that you see a good psychiatrist who can assist you in bringing to the forefront of conscience all of those experiences and circumstances that lead to the habit. You are already on the right road toward a solution, since you honestly recognize the problem and have a desire to solve it."

Throughout the new testament reference is made of him teaching and debating the Jewish scriptures  which shows he believed it was worthy enough to consider.  He clearly acknowledged the God of the old Testament  as his God.  He didn't invent a new God.

Any attempts at moderation of eye for an eye etc were not uncommon teachings.  Jesus didn't introduce any dramatically new teachings on these issues.  The Law was never met to be meted out without considering justice.

In the most famous case with the woman brought before him to be stoned, he didn't explicitly condemn capital punishment he simply stopped a miscarriage of justice because the accusers were also guilty of adultery ""let him who is without sin cast the first"".

>the notion that ideology matters more than blood relations.

Blood line was very important.  Jesus and his followers saw him as the Messiah which had to be of the Davidic line. 

And for someone who didn't care about bloodlines he cared a lot for Jews.

 ""I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.""

Matthew 15:22-24

These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them, ""Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.""

Matthew 10:5-6"

LeopardsAteMyFace,fech9sf,t1_fecfsdn,1578973887.0,Its okay.  I realize that you're in over your head.   Take the loss but don't be too hard on yourself.
LeopardsAteMyFace,fecdixl,t1_fecbk6i,1578971354.0,Exactly.  Thanks for proving my point. The Iranian gov murders a plane load of people with Obama funded missiles and Reddit wants to talk about 30 year old plot and some has been?  No cigar.

Lol. Try harder."
LeopardsAteMyFace,fecazcw,t1_feca0gj,1578969869.0,"Lol nice try.  You can talk your way out this one.  Obama's actions occurred recently. And thus have far more relevance on the current situation.

He's a traitor, deal with it."

Where do people get this idea from? Insurance is a back up plan that you don't want to use.  Its far more profitable and efficient if the facilities didn't burn down. Lol."

LeopardsAteMyFace,febpsif,t1_febno6b,1578961356.0,Nope. Never said that.
