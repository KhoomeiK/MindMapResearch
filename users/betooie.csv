Demons with Pierce are not necessary just have them with good resistances (aliments) and good support moves like Prayer, Rakukaja, Tarukaja, War cry/Debilitate. Dante doesn't have Pierce or good support skills so another demon will be more useful.

If you still feel insecure you could grind a little more with your final team and fuse them with mitamas."

Ah ok now I think I understand your point and I think it has some  good ideas but you make it sound like the greatest advice ever that everyone should follow and  it tickle me in a wrong way, I agree and like the meaningful things for you part, obsessing with what you want is very damaging but I think it has nothing bad to work patiently on personal desires.

Maybe the world owns my nothing but I also don't own him nothing, being a good person feels great but is far from making me motivated or happy when my life is still shit.
