trees,ff97qwe,t1_ff8c2xj,1579706804.0,"I'm pretty used to both sets, and have to move between them regularly in my job...I think the biggest thing that metric-only people don't realize (or don't acknowledge) about imperial units is just how little conversion actually goes on within the system.

Most of the casual use of these units takes place in a context where the units are already understood, with an intuitive grasp on the information being conveyed.

It's not the most science or newbie friendly way of doing things, but you can get along just fine in the US without ever knowing that a mile is 5,280 feet. It just doesn't ever really matter. What matters is that you know, conceptually, what 10 miles means in the current context. It's a short drive over to the next town, but it's a really long walk when your car breaks down...or a moderate hike, depending on terrain.

Likewise, nobody really gives a shit about temperature conversion. The most common use of the units for the overwhelming majority of people is weather, and for that usage, it's an easy, intuitive 0-100 scale for most of the US for most of the year.

Would it be easier if we'd adopted metric at the same time as the rest of the world? Of course. But either way it wouldn't make a huge difference in the daily lives of most people, and what's more important, that's just not how it went down, and imperial units are still working fine for most people.

Further, at this point, changing would be more of a net negative for most people, so it's unlikely to happen in the near future."
AskReddit,ff96tbn,t1_ff8zbvr,1579706201.0,"This.

I've worked for a mechanical engineer who used to work for the auto industry. The man couldn't change his own oil, put on a spare tire, or jump a dead battery, let alone any issue beyond basic maintenance or filling his gas tank. I think most of his work had something to do with some portion of the drive train, and he knew a lot about fluid couplings (I think?).

Regardless, the point is that he was a brilliant mind in his niche but it didn't translate outside of that niche into the subject at large in any practical way.

Two other angles though:

First: that knowledge didn't help him to even replace his wiper blades without help, but by the time I met him, it *did* get him working at a high level in the natural gas industry. This highly specialized experience he had didn't translate directly, but had a lot of overlap with another highly specialized area.

Second: A friend of mine is a real grease monkey when it comes to his car. I'm not sure anyone else has done any work on it but him since it rolled off the production line. Wouldn't surprise me if he's at least left a fingerprint on every single discrete part of that car. But when I brought up whatever the component was that my boss had done engineering on, my friend knew the part, but for him it was one of those parts that you never really touched, and if it went bad, the fix was to take the whole thing off and put a new one on.

So I knew two guys who each individually knew more than 100 times my level of automotive knowledge, but had basically zero overlap on one another. Didn't mean either one was stupid, or that their knowledge wasn't as ""worthwhile"" as the other...it was just different.  And to assume that ""he knows about cars"" covered certain given territory was just a blind assumption."
AskReddit,ff95g07,t1_ff8yymo,1579705280.0,"I mean, that's mostly true.

Most people spend most of their waking hours either doing job related stuff or ""life maintenance"" stuff like cooking, cleaning, parenting, etc. And with whatever is leftover, they have time for relaxing with a drink or some pot, and maybe a hobby or two.

That's pretty much what middle class success looks like in early 21st century America. 

And then here we are saying that all of that constitutes boring.

It's not that we're *wrong*, but if that's where we're setting the bar, it logically follows that most people are boring and relatively few will be interesting...which is accurate.

I guess at this point it's also worth a reminder that if the worst someone can say about you is that you're boring, you're probably doing okay."

reactiongifs,ff7w7n6,t1_ff7oyym,1579659824.0,"That's your life and I'm glad for you, but for me, being a good kid didn't mean not having to have those lectures.

Not that my mom was awful, she did a great job with us, but she was (and still very much is) prone to endless lectures. 

Even now, she will chew me out over the phone for an hour or more because she ran into computer issues and I ignored her when she called and didn't get back to her for hours (because I was at work). Apparently I don't care about her. 

I've just learned that when she's on a roll like that she's not really upset about what I did, she's venting her stress and frustration, and she just happens to be long winded.

She does the same thing to my dad even to this day. He'll go to the grocery store for her but come back with the wrong kind of paper towels, and it's not because she didn't specify, or that it was just an honest mistake, it's because he never listens to get because he doesn't care. 

It's always the small offense that to her is a sign of a big underlying issue.

I hate to sound like I'm just ripping on my mom, because she really is a good mom, but the older I get, the more I realize that her lecturing was way beyond the norm. Some of hers would last for days. Go to school, come home and get lectured from the moment you walked in the door, through dinner, and around 9 or so, she'd let up so you could do your homework and go to bed. Come home from school the next day and it'd start up again.

So yeah maybe it makes me sound like a shitty kid, but it's not just that as a kid or teen I clashed with my parents and never grew up. I have a good relationship with both my parents, and there's times even to this day that I butt heads with each of them, but that's always been one of the things I remember about those years that each time I look back on it I'm like, ""Yeah, no that was ridiculous.""

And I'm not saying I should have been an equal party. I was a kid. Hell, even now I respect them and wouldn't try to impose my own will over theirs. But dad's approach was always that if he wasn't looking for your input, he wouldn't ask for it. And he'd just tell you what he wanted to say and that was that. With Mom, that process always involved asking you questions, and if you answered, you were either interrupted or it'd give her a new subject to lecture you on, so you just kinda learned to keep the answers short, and just enough to keep from stirring her up even more."
reactiongifs,ff7iwhr,t1_ff7g5w6,1579650608.0,"So if it's a one sided lecture, the only participation required is the kid's presence and short simple answers, so that's all you'll get, since the faster they play their part, the faster the parent will finish up whatever they're going on about and they can move on.

My mom was always a lecturer, and once I learned that my punishment whatever came after was already decided, I just came to see the inevitable hours long interrogation/lecture as the appetizer punishment to whatever main dish she's already cooked up, I quit participating. Just the shortest answer to keep her talking until she spoke her peace, and I got my punishment, and that was it.

I think that's something that a lot of parents miss. 

I'm in my 30s and all I remember from any of her ""conversations"" was how tedious and boring it was, not a word she said. If you expect a long talk to have any positive net result the kid must feel they're an active participant whose opinions are being heard and valued, and that the results that come after will be impacted by their participation. If any disagreement or failure to parrot back what the patent wants to hear is met with instant shut down, parental pulling of rank, or even just a lack of impact, the only logical thing for them to do is just the bare minimum effort of being there and saying whatever the parents want to hear. And the more they do it, the better they'll get at doing it without ever thinking about what is being talked about."
TalesFromRetail,ff7hv51,t1_ff7cy7w,1579649911.0,"Had a manager that tried this.

He wanted to look good at the expense of the people under him as well as not have to put in any extra time (managers were salary but us grunts were hourly).

As soon as he started scheduling us night workers only up until closing time, I asked him if he was planning to close alone (knowing this was generally not done) and he wouldn't give me a straight answer.

At close, he insisted we stay to carry out the closing procedures (while he sat in the back and did nothing) but still sign out at the scheduled closing time, effectively working unpaid for about a half hour.

I did it that time but warned him it was the last. He basically said yay, yeah whatever, you'll do what I tell you. Myself and the other hourly person that night were scheduled for the same close the next night, so I convinced her to leave with me at close.

As soon as 9:00 came, we went to the sign out sheet and filled it out, then grabbed our coats and left. Asshole manager thought we were closing, sat on his ass, and when he wondered what was taking so long, he came out to full, uncounted tills, a store that hadn't been restocked, straightened up, organized, and cleaned, and it all had to be done before he left. Usually the manager helped the two associates and it took about a half hour but I guess he was there till after 11 that night.

The next day he was livid and ripped into us and told us we were being written up, and maybe fired. He did all the paperwork and shoved it in front of us to sign but I refused (can't remember what the other associate did) and a few days later I got a call from one of the location supervisors.

I explained what he was doing, and that I'd already had time that I worked that he wouldn't let me sign out appropriately for and the supervisor thanked me and asked if it came to it, if I'd sign a legal document stating all of what I said to her, and I said I would.

Turns out I didn't need to, as she called other night associates after me and all of them said the same story. 

I never saw him again."

That sense of entitlement that, because you're a small business, you're somehow allowed to treat customers badly and still expect their business, or else *they're* the bad ones.

Never had it with a garden store, but my main hobby is fly fishing, and I have definitely encountered it there.

One local shop is run by a couple, out of their basement, and they got to the point of shaming people on their email list (not to a person, naming names, but collectively) for not buying more of the gear they ""bought for us to enjoy"". Also complained constantly that more people weren't donating to the causes they supported.

I got tired of it and unsubscribed and quit going, then months later they asked a mutual friend why I hadn't been there in a while and he kinda demurred, so they emailed me directly (again with a generous helping of ""we're a small business so you owe us your business, and you're not giving us enough money so you need to get over here and buy some stuff"").

So I tried to explain as politely as I could, and they blew up on me, calling many creative names and accusing me of everything from being a kid with no respect, to a freeloader, you name it.

So (maybe ill advised but I was pissed), I made an angry post on social media about it. Didn't mention names, but the description of the antics accomplished as much. People knew.

Started getting vaguely threatening (and wildly dramatic) emails from them, and they even started asking that mutual friend threatening questions like where I liked to fish and what kind of car I drove.

I emailed them back to tell them to cut it out, and if they didn't, my next move would be to contact police, and they did relent...but damn...

INTP,ff6qeh8,t1_ff5ioxk,1579632708.0,"I've worked under engineers for basically my entire career.

Generally I've found that when they ask for information, whether they call it a report, a summary, an update, appraisal, whatever...they want the core of the information, with as few extras as absolutely necessary, presented as briefly and as spartan as possible.

At my last job this was distilled even further: I was asked to set up an inspection procedure and a report for a trial order on what could become a huge contract for us.

I basically wrote out an entire procedure made accompanying worksheets for the shop inspectors to just fill out, an Excel sheet for me to enter those numbers and calculate various overall metrics, and export them to a PDF I could generate and email.

I was convinced my boss would be blown away.

When I was finally ready, I asked him for a minute to explain my report to him.

He says, ""If you need to explain it, it's not doing its job, and probably over complicated. Are the parts all in spec? If not, how close are we?""

Me: ""No, but like 98% are good and the ones that are out are close.""

""Thank you for your report. Have the inspector set aside any parts out of spec with a note on what's out. We'll check them out at the end of the day.""

And that was it! Never even used the excel sheet or PDF even once.

That said, the ""fill in the blank"" inspection sheet was a hit with the inspector, and while *he* wanted one for every job, he settled for only our frequently done core products. Engineer boss liked it too, since it gave him a quick reference that he could use to discuss with the machinists and customers. Other than that, though, my advanced report was a waste of time."

You can afford to rent a place, but aside from a weekend getaway, how can you spend most of your summer there instead of at work?

You still have all your expenses like rent or mortgage, food, clothing, etc. so you're still going to need to work. If you're under 40 you likely still have several thousand in student debt hanging over your head, plus a car payment, phone/internet, etc.

So you've gotta keep working full time to maintain all of that, *plus* even more time to be able to pay for this getaway summer home.

Not so fast.

I believe a judge would also look at the circumstances, particularly at whether the alterations to the item were plausibly in good faith or not.

This is similar to lunch thieves at offices.

If some piece of shit is stealing my food from the fridge, I can add spice to as hot as I can stand it, knowing he may steal it and suffer (and indeed I could do this intentionally), and that's on him. He shouldn't be stealing the food, and adding spice is something that people regularly plausibly do to food they intend to consume. As long as I didn't, for example, leave it on the thief's desk (which might be construed as a gift).

However, if I'm adding a poison, drug (aside from something prescribed, and advised to be mixed with food), foreign physical substance (something discrete like rocks or hair...or something that would be miscible like bodily fluids), or even a food additive that the other side could prove I reasonably wouldn't have done for my own food (like thermonuclear atomic hot sauce if I'm not that kind of eater), or something like a known allergen to target the thief (say I'm good with peanuts but I know the suspected thief is allergic, so I specifically put some peanut butter on a food item that wouldn't normally have it...like a chicken salad sandwich), in *those* cases, a judge would likely find me at fault, since my actions were fully intended to cause harm. 

Personally, I have mixed feelings there, because on one hand we can't have people dosing their pizza leftovers with cyanide, then when Ned from accounting goes down, they shrug their shoulders and say, ""Not my fault, he shouldn't have been stealing my lunch.""...but on the other, *especially* as far as allergies, or OTC medicines like laxatives are concerned, that the food thief should bear far more personal responsibility and fault.

In this case, an added drug to a drink would pretty clearly fall under that category. Even if the drink's owner had that drug prescribed by a doctor, that delivery method would be inconsistent with it's intended method, and in a way that is implausible for self administration but a *very plausible* method for surreptitiously drugging an unsuspecting victim.

It's sort of like the difference between owning a set of lockpicking tools and having them at home in your garage beside a vise and an assortment of practice locks... and the same set of tools found duct taped to your torso, found during a pat down when you were discovered lurking behind a jewelry store at 3am wearing head to toe black and a ski mask.

In the former case, you can argue that it's hobby gear for a fun leisure time challenging activity you enjoy. In the latter context, you can certainly *try* the same defense, but circumstantial factors do not support you. True, in that second case you still might not have done anything illegal, but it's going to be an uphill battle in the courtroom."

Maybe eating out every day is not what people in poverty tend to do...or maybe it is. Not that it's a wise decision, but maybe it's a part of what's keeping this person in poverty. Or maybe they're working two jobs and don't have more than 20 minutes to spare between them, so going home and cooking is out of the question, and fast food is the only realistic option for a hot meal. 

I guess my point is that it's easy to look at someone's situation on the surface and make hasty judgements about the contributing factors or changes they should make.

Of course, that is all with regard to the fast food.

For the car, yeah, don't buy a car you can't afford. That can be a difficult concept for some people though (and I don't say that patronizingly). The car I currently drive is the first one I pretty much handled on my own completely, from shopping around, reading reviews, evaluating my finances, negotiating with the dealership, qualifying for financing, and making the purchase...as well as making the payments.

Luckily, my obsessive number crunching paid off, and even though I went to the max of my budget, it turned out my calculations were on target and while my car payment really does max out my monthly budget sometimes, it's a payment that I can indeed afford.

And that's through a job change that led to more income but a much higher cost of living.

Now I'm looking into yet another job change in the next month or two, and this would be the first one for me that would take me from living on a pretty strict budget to actually having some disposable income to do what I want with each month. To that end I'm trying already to calculate what that might look like and what I want to do with it, and a big part of that extra amount will be put toward my car payment. It won't feel like I'm enjoying the extra pay much, but in about a year I'll have the car paid off and then I'll have not only the extra from the new job but also that car payment I don't have to send in every month.

I think it's that sort of strategizing that people don't really do, and it keeps biting them in the ass. You don't have to allocate every dollar or obsess over every expense, you just have to be mindful of where your money is going in your current lifestyle, and evaluate options to make it all work."

With all fly tying it's a good idea, but with the expense (and sheer amount of material you get) with dry hackle, it's always a good idea to decide what you want to accomplish, *then* get the material to do it. Don't just shop aimlessly and get whatever jumps out at you, then figure out how to use it.

Read up on the hatches in your area (and on the water you fish specifically, if you can find it...I know in my area for example, I have tricos, but not in any numbers where I feel the need to carry them, and green drakes happen on some streams but not others...and even where they DO hatch, the fish often ignore them in favor of slate drakes...etc.).

Come up with a list of the most common, prevalent, fishable hatches you're likely to encounter. From there, come up with a material list you'll need to tie them, and from *that*, look at the hackle and see if you can merge, compromise, etc. For example: you'll want to tie plenty of Adams dries, but early on, feel free to skip the brown hackle. Use the grizzly that you're gonna need anyway and leave off the brown that you're only gonna use in larger sizes for Adams, Simulators and Wulff patterns. They can all make do with grizzly for now. Dun can be replaced by grizzly too, in most cases. You'll also probably want to have smaller feathers for caddis. Here, you can grab a brown OR dark ginger in a 16 or 18 and be good to go for just about all caddis from 14 to 18. For darker variants, just use a body dubbed in a darker shade and darker winging. For lighter, do the opposite.

Honestly, I could likely cover the majority of my dry tying with a 14 grizzly saddle, an 18 brown, and a midge grizzly. There would be compromises for sure, but I could make it work."

flytying,fek8f2j,t1_fek06rf,1579194767.0,"Most saddles are 80-90% one size, with the remainder being split more or less evenly between the next size up and down. Some are tweeners, where the feathers are, say, a big 14 or a small 12, and you can likely make all of them work on either size.

So in a word, no.

You don't get a genetic saddle for versatility. You get a genetic saddle because they're the best damn feathers to use for dries, bar none.

I've got maybe 15 whiting saddle products (whole, halves, and quarters, in a variety of colors and sizes), and maybe 3 genetic dry necks. It's pretty amazing how far dry hackle has come, and whiting especially. My brown neck ties from 8 to 24 but the feathers have large, stiff stems, and have an overall length that only lets me tie one fly per feather...two feathers to a fly in some cases, and the feathers have a constant taper, making it tough/impossible to get really nice consistent even hackling on a set of flies. In contrast, take my light ginger saddle. It's a whiting gold grade full saddle (remember: whiting grades just mean more feathers, not better feathers), and it ties mostly 14s. I can get 12s out of it, but I have to hunt around the pelt for bigger feathers, and I tie 16s with it as well, but I hunt for smaller feathers and usually opt to tie parachutes, where I can get away with using a large feather without issue. But using this saddle, the feathers all have a super fine, pliable stem, I can usually get 3-8 flies *per feather* (depending on how heavily I hackle them and how big they are), and there's effectively no taper at all.  I can snip off the bottom half inch of feather and start tying...3-8 flies later, the tip is a size smaller but it's too short to tie another anyway. 

You're not getting saddles because they can do everything, you're getting them because they do what they do better than anything else.

That being said, I must acknowledge that Whiting's necks have come a long way, even in the past 10-12 years. I have a tyers grade (high & dry?) neck that I bought maybe 3 years ago and it's worlds better than that brown neck I talked about earlier. I can get multiple flies from most of the feathers, and they're all more flexible, with finer stems. Sure the feathers aren't as long and uniform as a saddle, and the neck doesn't have *quite* as much range as older necks, but I'd say it could tie 12-18 pretty easily, and get 2-3 parachutes per feather...which was just unheard of a few decades ago.

So for you, maybe get that grizzly neck. You'll need it for everything from your #8 hex to your #20 Griffiths Gnats, and the quality will be great.

But pick up a 100s pack of size 14 dun for Hendricksons and slate drakes and see how you like using those feathers.

Some guys prefer to accept the cons of handling for the versatility. I chose to buy mostly saddles. A few of the most popular things I've had to double or triple up: I have grizzly in two half saddles: one ties 12 & 14, the other is a midge half, tying 18-22. But really, look at what you realistically need and plan around that.

For me, in order of most to least essential, I'd want: grizzly in 12-14, brown in 16-18, dun in 14-16, grizzly in midge sizes, brown in 12-14, ginger in 14, dun in midge sizes, black in 14.

From there, I can plan my purchases as I set aside cash. I didn't get all my saddles at once by any means, I got maybe 2 to get me tying dries, then added one at a time over the years until now I can admire a new pelt without feeling any urge to buy. I've added a few other sizes and colors to the hoard (a grizzly olive half saddle in 12 is appreciated for hoppers, for example) but the list above is far and away the core of my use."

If anything, it's a liability.

Wire wrap is meant as a guard to keep material under it from damage and fraying. To do this it only needs thickness (to keep sharp things away from the sensitive material) and to cross over the wraps underneath. As long as it's not wrapped at the same pitch, you're definitely crossing, and since most underbodies have at least 25+ wraps while ribs max out in the single digits, they have different pitches.

So.

Why not wrap in the *same* direction instead of counter? 

Wrapping counter pulls all of your tight tying in the opposite direction, making the fly less secure. Wrapping in the same direction pulls everything together even tighter.

Broadly, I think wrapping for fly integrity is largely irrelevant, wasted time and material and bulk for zero benefit, but if the fly specifically calls for it, or it's being added for cosmetics, for Pete's sake, wrap in the same direction as all the other materials."

Nature gives them so many other things that they don't need intelligence to survive as a species.

I think often people understand ""intelligence"" as ""ability to achieve success"", and in the human world, often they're one in the same, as being intelligent is often 95% of what you need to overcome a challenge. In technical terms, if your robot isn't doing what it needs to do, think about the problem and use your intelligence to write a better and better program until you have something that works.

In the gator's case, it's got a robot that is much more capable of overcoming challenges in it's environment, and the OS is pretty much capable of overcoming most of the challenges that it's likely to face, so there's not really much need for advanced programming or a programmer to adapt to various situations. Basically: with a body like a gator, in the preferred habitat of the gator, you don't have to be smart, you just have to use that gator body to carry out relatively straightforward processes, and you don't have to worry about self-preservation.

And really, the proof is in the pudding, because if you had to be smart to survive as a gator, then the dim ones would have long since failed to pass on their genes, and by now the only kind you'd have would be the smart ones."

She was making the argument that all things cisgendered should be identified as such to both differentiate from as well as normalize their trans equivalents.

I conceded that such a measure would indeed likely help, however argued that it wasn't a reasonable (let alone feasible or likely) thing from a purely logical standpoint.

I tried using examples: we don't call every car a gas car to differentiate from hybrids or electric cars because they're so overwhelmingly more common that it's the assumed state unless specified otherwise. We don't say dairy milk or cow milk along with soy and almond (and goat and coconut) because dairy/cow is what the vast majority of people consider normal. 

This of course got onto ideas of normalcy, to which my position is that cisgendered is indeed what's ""normal"", objectively, like it or not. That doesn't make it any more right, any better, any more worthy of social acceptance, and it *certainly* doesn't mean that anything *other than* cis should get any sort of negative reaction. It's a term that just reflects frequency of occurrence. Our problem, as a society, isn't thinking of cis as normal, it's how we react to what's *not* normal.

From there she suggested that perhaps my position was too coldly logic-based for what was, to many, a deeply emotional issue, and I agreed that might be the case, but that being logical didn't necessarily make me wrong.

It was a good discussion, and I'm glad we had it, as I came away from it with a lot more to think about. But I think that this ""fats"" example, using the actual prefixes, would have really made it more clear."
