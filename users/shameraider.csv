I’ve seen enough poorly controlled diabetes in people.  It isn’t pretty."
fatlogic,ff7rokk,t3_es2fu7,1579656720.0,"Apparently my primary care physician goes to the same gym as me.  I encountered him while there and felt awkward enough.  I’m possibly looking for another gym as he’s the hospital’s chief of staff so I’m not sure I’m up for social encounters.

At least he can say at my next appointment that I was observed in the gym doing exercise, thankfully.  My GP just looks goofy on a treadmill.

None of those “advocacy” bits tumble out my mouth at appointments.  He’s firmly backing me up on losing weight."

Yeah, 52 pounds to go until a healthy BMI.  I think the journey will be worth it.  Having a partner to join me on it would definitely make it easier..."
