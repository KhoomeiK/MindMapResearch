Chonkers,ffaxqxz,t1_ffawq8r,1579746941.0,Yes he's a fine boi now according to the sticky but he was a heckin chonker about 8 years ago. He went on a diet and lost enough weight that he still has some excess loose belly skin that covers his back feet when he sits like this.

Chonkers,ffap379,t1_ffaopj0,1579741168.0,That sounds frustrating yet adorable!
funny,ffajbmp,t1_ffadkip,1579737141.0,My favorite is the Carne Assassin with the Scorpion Salsa for a little extra kick.
funny,ffaj754,t1_ffaepr1,1579737050.0,"It used to be a food trailer that would hang out in North Dakota then set up in East Idaho for a year or so. They decided to franchise and opened the first couple of stores in northern Utah and now they're cropping up all over the Northwest US. It's my favorite TexMex/CaliMex burrito joint. I was first in line for the opening of one of them and got a card for a free burrito a week for a year and I'm still not sick of the place. If you can make it to one, their namesake Sweeto Burrito is really good but my favorite is their Carne Assassin burrito because it's chock full of fresh cooked steak. They also happen to have the best french fries I've ever had."
