It is especially contagious but will not kill you unless you are already compromised or like... really dehydrated.

If you can work, there are companies in calgary that offer temp work paid by the day (mostly construction gigs if they have any). Getting on any kind of EI or disability right now is going to 1) take absolutely forever and 2) be very hard as the UPC cut funding to a shitload of social programs--it is a very bad time to be a poor person in calgary. That said, if you're a citizen of canada there will be government programs (or nonprofits/stuff like the Dream Center) for helping you find work or find housing but there will be waiting lists--if you need out NOW and have no friends or social net your only bet is unfortunately a shelter and someone to foster your dog. Alternatively focus first on getting a car and then live in your car... it isnt glamorous but its better than the street. Last ditch you could sign up for the military and live on base but again, your dog would need to be fostered."

Calgary,ff5c2mu,t3_ern11h,1579586808.0,Petfinder.com will connect you with local rescues and help you find ones if you're breed picky. French Bulldogs/English bulldogs have a very poor life expectancy (and quality of life... every single one is conceived via artificial insemination and birthed via C section because of anatomical issues) and beagles are a VERY poor choice for an apartment (loud as fuck and athletic). Buying a dog isnt just about looks! That said a pug is a pretty good choice for a small apartment if youre okay with the breeding standards but for gods sake do NOT use a collar on the neck--use a harness on pugs as the pressure on their throat can cause their eyes to pop out of their sockets (i shit you not this is a real problem for them)

WhitePeopleTwitter,fenlvy6,t1_fenkazo,1579287477.0,"So you think that wealth is a matter of good vs. bad decisions even though the middle class is disappearing, the 40 hour work week (which was a number supposed to be split between two people) has been normalized--or more considering most jobs dont have unions anymore, and wages havent matched the rate of inflation in decades. Jeff Bezos is having his arm twisted to pay his workers a ""minimum"" wage of 15 dollars an hour, whereas to actually live a ""comfortable"" life that minimum actually needs to be somewhere around 30. 

Hilarious to think you consider the government to be evil--im guessing you call the cops when you have an emergency? You drive on the roads they built and use the pipes put in to drink the water and electricity set up by government contract?
