I am a fat person who has lived both in Europe and the US, my immediate family consists of Germans and US Americans. The differences in habits are statistically proven as is the genetic link to obesity. Please educate yourself."
dating_advice,ff91rmp,t1_ff8lc0v,1579702694.0,"I was a bit younger (not that it really matters though) and had decided for myself that I wasn’t looking for anything serious in the slightest at the time so if the person seemed safe enough to meet up with after “talking” online, I did. People tend to keep conversation relatively light when they’re looking for this sort of thing so I would later often realize I have nothing in common with a guy, or that some of their world views don’t align with mine etc. And of course some of them would try to turn things into a friends with benefits kind of situation but I was never interested because they didn’t seem like somebody I’d want to actually be around. Except for one guy who was really pleasant to talk to actually but he (relatively) quickly started dating somebody so that never happened. Nice guy though, we stayed in touch for a bit after that lol"

You are 20 and have already achieved more career-wise than a lot of people will by the time they are in their 30’s and yet you think you have no right to be proud of that and see yourself as a highly valuable employee. It’s normal to be a little afraid of “making a mistake” when deciding to accept a new job because having a little bit of fear of the unknown is a normal, human thing. Not to get all cliché phrasey on you, but life is a gamble. You are super super young and already advancing in your current job. You’re doing great."

investing,ff5dzwx,t3_erqrbb,1579588880.0,Not much bad will happen to the average person. The super rich will get taxed more if his plans go through and they won’t feel it to a life-altering extent. Greedy people will hate it and working class people will in turn feel less like their life depends on not getting fired from a shitty job because of better worker’s protection. Look at the last time the super rich were taxed at a high rate (70%) before Reagan ruined it for everybody. Things were good.

On-campus jobs do exist but they’re seen as any other job and being a student at the same place usually doesn’t give you an advantage though it does give you the student worker pay rate (in my experience it’s 1 to 2€ higher per hour than minimum wage).

If you work full-time out of college and your living costs leave some money leftover to pay back your loans you should usually be fine after some years when the debts are paid off. This can be faster or longer again, depending on many factors. You can't generalize this stuff. You can google federal aid policies and guidelines though. But even then, those who apply for financial aid before others will have aid dispensed to them more favorably, so again, there are variables."

It is one thing to aspire towards being more healthy, and getting there by eating right and exercising sometimes. If you tie it onto wanting to be skinny though, because you feel like it will make you considered ""pretty"" by the world and your life will somehow magically be fixed, you are setting yourself up for a lifetime of disappointment.
