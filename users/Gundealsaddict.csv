Which completely nullified any argument #4 had. If you had any belief in #4, you obviously didn’t read any of those quotes, and you have clearly never heard of the Federalist Papers. Those happen to pretty much be the instruction guide as to how our country works by the way, since you seem to have no clue what our founders intended. 

> letting everyone carry guns protects minorities and lets them resist corrupt government actors is total bullshit?

That was addressed with the quotes, but if you really are that dense... 

Have you never heard of the Battles of Lexington and Concord? Government forces, under order of Massachusetts Governor Thomas Gage, were sent to break up protestors and confiscate their weapons. Said protestors opened fire on the soldiers in what would be the first battles of the American Revolution. 

How about the Battle of Athens? In 1946, local citizens took up arms against the local law enforcement offices to combat corruption, police brutality, and voter intimidation. You can read the details here. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Athens_(1946)

Counter to “lie 4”: DC versus Heller affirmed the individual right to bear arms. The opinion written for it even stated that arms in common use are protected by the amendment. The constitution is pretty clear on the 2nd amendment when it uses the statement “shall not be infringed” as it is the only amendment with such wording. You may not like the amendment, but that’s what it says. 

As for your “lie 8” it’s a disingenuous and sad argument but I’ll bite. Let’s start with some quotes from the founders.

“A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined…”
– George Washington, First Annual Address, to both House of Congress, January 8, 1790

“No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.”
– Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Constitution, Draft 1, 1776

“The Constitution of most of our states (and of the United States) assert that all power is inherent in the people; that they may exercise it by themselves; that it is their right and duty to be at all times armed.”
– Thomas Jefferson, letter to to John Cartwright, 5 June 1824

“Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch. Liberty is a well-armed lamb contesting the vote!”
-Benjamin Franklin 

“Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of.”
– James Madison, Federalist No. 46, January 29, 1788

Clearly our founders supported individual ownerships as these are just a few of the hundreds of quotes that affirm this. 

As to the rest of the nonsense, I won’t bother addressing it. God made man, Samuel Colt made them equal. Minorities should not only be armed the same as the majority, but more so. It is the great equalizer. Gun control in this nation has always targeted the poor through additional fees and tax stamps and minorities through additional screening that specifically has been written time and time again to restrict ownership to only the white upper classes. That doesn’t change with any of the new proposed laws. The wealthy will in no way be disarmed, only the poor. Not to mention the fact that LEO’s are exempt from every single one of these laws. Democrats love to talk about cops shooting unarmed minorities, but they sure are keen on keeping them well armed and provided more privilege than the average citizen. 

I’ll debate gun laws with you all you want. It’s one of my absolute favorite past times. That wasn’t the point of this entire conversation though. The point was that our politicians can’t play nice with each other, and are consistently throwing low blows at the opposing party’s base. I’d prefer not to add any more ammunition to this war. Just remember, if you play your healthcare solely in the hands of the government, you are submitting yourself to one day having your healthcare be under the control of men like Mitch McConnell. If that makes you uncomfortable, you may want to not throw all your eggs in the government’s basket. Said government has a tendency to fuck things like that up."
news,fdp0am2,t1_fdoykz6,1578616959.0,"You’re right, those laws are more to hurt poor people and minorities who would seek to use their arms to fight back against a tyrannical government, which you would probably not want to have to reload after each shot if that was your situation. 

Regardless, Democrats still push unconstitutional gun laws (Yes, it is unconstitutional. SCOTUS already has confirmed the AR-15 is protected by the 2nd amendment.) for the sake of making Republican voters angry. Democrat supporters enthusiastically support it because they want to piss off Republicans. Both sides are guilty of the same bullshit political game of trying to make the other side hurt more than they hurt you.

Imagine having single payer healthcare in the US with an opt out clause that allowed the individual to not have to participate or pay taxes towards single payer. The system would collapse due to lack of funds from individuals who choose to not participate. So, in order to make it work, you have to force the individual to participate even if they don’t want to.

As for how Marines interact with JSOC units, if you know how JSOC operated you’d know why Marines are rarely the QRF for them. It just isn’t logistically reasonable to use Marines or Army infantry as QRF for them because it takes too long to mobilize them. You’d know that if you’d ever done the job. Operators call air support if they are in trouble. In the event that they need ground support, it’s typically another JSOC unit that responds. The only reason Marine or Army infantry would respond is if they happened to be in the area. It’s rare that they are in the area because their presence would indicate one of two things. 1) The area is secured by Marine or Army infantry units. This would likely negate the need for JSOC to be operating in the area unless it’s for training purposes. 2) They are working in tandem. In this event, infantry would not be QRF because they are already there and engaged. Maybe you are confusing joint operations. Maybe your marine buddies over inflated their stories. Maybe you are an idiot who plays too many video games. It doesn’t matter, but Marine and Army infantry rarely rescues JSOC. 

Again, if you actually knew how combat operations worked, you’d know these things. You don’t though. You are a shitbag armchair general who is now guilty of the very same thing you tried to accuse me of doing. Good job trying to shit on the army though.

news,fcz5vn9,t1_fcysx2b,1578094295.0,Just wait until they nationalize healthcare and education. That number isn’t even close to where it will go when we essentially have to double the budget. They say the rich will pay for it. They won’t.
news,fcz4zfm,t1_fcyzfg4,1578093776.0,I’m sure the elite US forces and Russian forces could hold their own. They all just have different ways of doing things.
news,fcz4ulz,t1_fcz25ah,1578093697.0,"Everyone in the army is trained to be a rifleman as well. Being trained as a rifleman doesn’t mean much. It just means you can pass basic rifle marksmanship. Being trained as an infantryman is the difference, and just like the army, not all marines and infantrymen."

news,fcz4efm,t1_fcyyglh,1578093438.0,"The Marines are note worthy because they are really good as convincing themselves and others that they are. I deployed with the Army in 09, and we had Marines in the area. They are no better trained, and often have worse equipment. They are thought of as more elite because their force employs less support classes than the army does. The army has a massive force of support personnel. The army also has more troops in combat roles than the entire USMC has people, and they are often better equipped. Marines being  elite is a myth. The elite forces are all under control of JSOC. They include Army Green Berets, Army Rangers, Army Night Stalkers, Navy SEALS, Airforce Parijumpers, and Marine Raiders."

gundeals,fcrnupc,t1_fcok9i0,1577904265.0,"Most USP fans say it’s better in 40 than it is in 9. 40 is the caliber it was designed to be. The 9mm variant was an afterthought. If you are going to give in and get 40, this should be the one."

guns,fcof0ox,t1_fcncmz4,1577830649.0,"No, it really doesn’t, stupid fuck. Tyranny by majority is still tyranny. If 99% of Americans voted that you should be killed if you aren’t a Christian, that would still be wrong. Having the majority does not give you the right to strip the minority of their rights. The fact that you and other liberals thinks it does is more than enough for me to go to war over. War sucks. Killing people isn’t fun. Being subjected to tyranny is more than enough to justify it though. I wish you good fortune in the violence to come."

A politician that is attacking the Constitution is the traitor, not the people fighting to defend it. If you infringe on my Constitutionally protected rights, you are no longer my countryman."
