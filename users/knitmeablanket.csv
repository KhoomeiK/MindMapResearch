This bitch shows up pregnant as fuck. I mean absofuckinglutely no denying it. Walks around slamming shots and brews like nothing. I'm flabbergasted, but the whole family (mom, dad, everyone) is on this medical anomaly train. 

I told my friend later her niece was absolutely pregnant. She kinda knew, but went with the family explanation.

AskMen,fd35963,t3_ejpr7t,1578154818.0,"People always assuming you're just watching the kids until mom gets back is super annoying. 

I'll be clear, I only did the single dad thing for a short period until I met someone very special to be their bonus mom. 

Cooking, cleaning, shopping, etc... I already did that. I already went to games and recitals. I even taught my daughter how to braid. I had a kick ass schedule that got me home before their buses dropped them off. I helped with all the homework, even though the new math was admittedly difficult for me to learn. 

Finding time to rest and reset was tough, but manageable. 

But yes, the single most annoying and difficult part is other people assuming you are incapable of being a solo parent and the mother must be on her way shortly. 

That, and convincing my oldest that wiping his ass is necessary, but I think all parents go through that."

Outback says its gonna be over an hour, totally understandable. My hothead BIL says fuck that and walks inside. I'm assuming shit is going to get ugly very quickly. 

The opposite happened. I have no idea what he did (he carries some money but is by no means rich), but we were sat in 15 minutes and had excellent service. 

The tab was around 1k, so I'm guessing the server knew the tip would be massive (FIL, now that dude has money and he was paying). 

Very rare and memorable.  Also 100% not typical of a restaurant. I'm still confused about it.
