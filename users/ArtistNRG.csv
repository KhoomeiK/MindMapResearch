Be very careful if the Ukraine complain like a little girl back to Russia because America cut its military funding your country might face annihilation, your country-has become a pawn in the world stage, you could of been a bishop or a castle but the powers that be as in the g5 choose you to suffer, you are surrounded bye adversaries and live in a  mountainous country that nuclear fall out could be minimized and contained. When America fights we rebuild what we break and don‚Äôt steal your resources but the same isn‚Äôt true about any other country through out history.  My true suggestion here is to figure out a way to apologize on the world stage. Or rent the machines that dig big tunnels and move your cities underground. 

Be very careful trump is a hot head with a lot of power that he abuses, he is basically the school (world) bully with a twist. He is in a position of power and doesn‚Äôt have impulse control.

If the population (regular people) left the country your dictator wouldn‚Äôt have anyone to rule, if you start a revolution against your regime, your country might just end up with foreign aid because the world loves the underdog. 

America is strong because we are all races and religions including yours working together

The reality is either we fix it or accept it and since most of society is complacent ya get the point.

Another is get your own place and don‚Äôt let anyone in your inner sanctum a boy won‚Äôt care he is just in that area for well you know.
