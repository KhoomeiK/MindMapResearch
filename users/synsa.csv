nutrition,ff2fj6f,t1_ff2143e,1579503985.0,"You have to eat foods that have the good microbes naturally in them such as raw vegetables (leafy greens as well as root vegetables because we also need microbes from the soil), fruit, fermented foods. You have to also feed the microbes by eating foods that they need to survive such as eating prebiotics."

aerogarden,fdxc4sk,t1_fdw5w04,1578767308.0,Thanks! Good to know there are other methods as the only one I know of is using the mouth to suck the water through (gross!) I like your method better!
aerogarden,fdupk2h,t1_fca91ck,1578736848.0,That's a great tip! Those sponges are almost half the price and you get more than ordering from aerogarden. Were they comparable in quality and did they work well?

Haircare,fd69k0v,t3_ejznj9,1578187602.0,Puberty can change your hair texture and curl. I know many people whose hair used to be straight but got curly and/or frizzy when puberty hit. Tigi manipulator is great for smoothing. Rub small amount on palms and run over the outside of hair. A little goes a long way so don't overdo it

Here is a good basic tutorial. 

https://youtu.be/JCoWjqR---M

I'd use jojoba oil instead if argan oil like he does because I always find argan oil goes rancid really fast and you only need 1 to 2 drops so it lasts forever. Don't use too much oil or your hair will get too greasy. Style with hair wax and hairspray if you'd like. He talks for about a minute so start the video at 1:11 if you want to go straight to the tutorial. 

As for the flakes, have you tried head and shoulders shampoo? If that doesn't work, try Nizoral"
AmItheAsshole,fbzu5it,t1_fbyi5r1,1577261692.0,Take pictures with them and your siblings throughout the year. Maybe even some with just you. That should be enough for a calendar.

This is the time for him to make strong connections to families. It won't be the same when he's older. I grew up without family close by and it was really hard. I fantasized about having close grandparents, aunts, uncles. I know of them and saw them a few times but never developed a relationship to this day."
YouShouldKnow,fbxtqxr,t1_fbxico5,1577200279.0,"I mentioned in another reply that dairy also has casein and whey that one can be intolerant to. It won't show up in a lactose intolerance test. The fact that this doesn't happen to you everyday suggests that you might be intolerant to casein (like me) because casein takes a while to digest. I tested it when I eliminated dairy for a while, then ate a good amount. Consistently, 3 days later, I get symptoms.

Try eliminating dairy to see if it makes a difference. My doctor suggested to me to give it 2 months to see a difference. And reading labels is a must because it's in so many things, a lot of times in things I would never suspect would have dairy."
YouShouldKnow,fbxt4iu,t1_fbxjec8,1577199802.0,"You may be intolerant to casein or whey also, the other components of dairy. In that case, the pills won't work because it only addresses lactose"
YouShouldKnow,fbxsxot,t1_fbxj7c6,1577199654.0,"Same, I suspect I'm casein intolerant because my symptoms aren't immediate because I think casein takes a while to digest. I also lost weight and dropped a ton of cholesterol points with no other dietary change"
YouShouldKnow,fbxro65,t1_fbxk7h6,1577198635.0,"I don't remember exactly but I want to say it took a few months. I don't know the exact science behind it but I'm guessing that my stomach had to heal so it wasn't immediate. 

It might've also taken that long because it took me a while to fully educate myself on what constitutes dairy (and plus I cheated so much because I missed some foods and also found dairy was in soooo many processed foods it was really hard to avoid). For example, I switched to non dairy creamer for my coffee, to later find that it contained casein, a huge component of milk. 

So it took me a while to not cheat and to come to terms that I can't eat certain foods anymore, then to find acceptable substitutes and then to not miss those foods enough to not cheat. Dairy free has become my new normal so it's not so hard anymore. I still cheat just a tiny bit sometimes  but I do pay for it when the eczema comes back but it's very mild and goes away if I stay good."
YouShouldKnow,fbxd4kb,t3_eexaso,1577181019.0,Appreciate you sticking your neck out to spread this message. I was in denial for a long time because the symptoms were so subtle and not what I assume. My stomach bothered me but I wasn't in pain. I had eczema but didn't ever think it was dairy. Plus I loved dairy. I was so skeptical at first but giving it up cleared up so many problems.
glutenfree,fbxcoy5,t3_eeqhty,1577180353.0,"Soy bean sheets (yuba) are spongy. I bet combined with the glutinous rice flour, it might give the spongy/chewy texture of seitan."
AskDocs,fbx9qa6,t3_eex91x,1577175905.0,"I'm finding out that milk intolerance goes beyond stomach aches. I had eczema for years and stopping dairy completely got rid of it for good. My son has really bad acne and greasy hair hours after showering and stopping dairy completely got rid of the grease and his acne. Ymmv. 

What I also found out was that dairy isn't necessarily the best source for calcium and vitamin d. Dairy is high in calcium but it also pulls calcium from bones. This is a sticky point of contention and you'll find confusing and conflicting information but this was my takeaway from my research. Here are 2 interesting reads:

AskDocs,fbx8kgh,t3_eesc6e,1577174266.0,Maybe try to post this on r/rheumatoid as there are speculations that it may be an issue. It's a great group of supportive people. There might be someone who can relate. RA is a difficult disease to pinpoint. Maybe also chronic fatigue syndrome? Both are auto immune so you may have more than one to deal with. I agree with you that there is something real going on and it's frustrating to be ping ponged from one doctor to another with no answers. How does one imagine a grand Mal seizure for gods sake!? Hugs and hope you find an answer soon.
