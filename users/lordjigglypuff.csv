depression,ffbzndx,t3_estaae,1579787721.0,"I'm the first to comment. So hopefully I can get in before the just Break up brigade.

Visit some therapy and learn better communication tools. I can't diagnose you but I can tell you hiding that your upset is not a step towards a successful relationship lol.

You should be able to communicate to him that you are upset because of reasons that aren't him. And that it's your own personal issues. However do keep in mind. Not everyone is equipped to date someone with depression. They will need more patience than average. And a high level of empathy. But you have to be clear with him. If you are snapping at him he might be under the Impression that he isn't contributing positively to your life and you would be better off without him."
depression,ffbz6ql,t3_est8uf,1579787359.0,"Hey man I took a look at your post history. And you Do seem quite lonely.

I don't know if I can give you a solution but. I remember as a teen I just wanted sex. Then I got it. Then I wanted more. I wanted to be loved. And then I was loved deeply. And I loved her back. She left and now I crave the ability to love again.

What I think I learned is that we will always want new goals. Humans are just that way. So try to give yourself goals that have a more permanent effect on your self. Work out more. Set a crazy cool fitness goal. Get a 6 pack. Get your money up. Take time and read ahead in your Courses. If your in an intro class read the intermediate text book for that class.

But that shits real hard. I get it. Find someone that gives you the strength to do this. Try therapy. A good therapist will 180 your life.

Edit: Thanks for the gold stranger :)"

depression,ffby2nc,t3_essxe0,1579786438.0,"In your comment I can see that people have good memories about you. And it's good that you recognize you are a person of value to others.

I am going to be frank with you. You actually can't tell everyone that offers to help you about your problems. How can someone who has had a regular life understand someone like you?

You have to be selective. Most counselors have been though incredibly fucked up shit. And they came out the other side stronger and able to understand themselves and able to help others. Therapy helps. If the first therapist you get doesn't help you, that therapist is the wrong medication. You are going to have to try another one.

I know this sounds really difficult. When depressed it's hard enough to just book an appointment. But having to cycle through them is just so much more work. Especially if it's a government mandated one. They are overworked and it's incredibly hard to actually get to a counsellor or psychiatrist through all the paperwork. But trust me. When you find someone that really understands you and has the tools and perspective to change your life. You r life will be full of color again.

Also please Dont kill yourself, the good part of life  is yet to come :)."
depression,ffbxahu,t3_esrsmb,1579785769.0,"I feel you. I broke up with my ex in June last year and we were together for 2 years. And I felt really out of it for months because of it. She was a nursing student as well and while we were together she gave me a 5 question questionnaire and diagnosed me with depression. I went to my GP and he gave the same one and said boy your depressed. They gave me my happy pills and made me incredibly dumb. A month in on my meds I broke down a lot emotionally and she couldn't tolerate it. And she saw other options at her work place so she left me. I had been in casual relationships before her. I had been in some serious ones as well. But they were all. Slow and I couldn't muster an I love you to any of them. She got me to say it in 3 days and after about a year together had me sort of convinced that we were meant to be together forever and she was definitely the woman I was going to marry. I was incredibly wrong. And I let her set my life plan back by 6 months. I had crazy withdrawals from trying to leave the meds and even tried to kill myself the first time I tried to leave it. This time I've succeeded in leaving the meds  I feel but I had migraines for about a month and half. And not just any migraines. The type that won't leave you while sober.

I woke up the other day crying because I had nothing going on in my life. 2 years prior I remembered I had a well paying job. 25$ an hour for a student, I was in university top of my class. And I had a loving gf. Now I'm single, unemployed, and have a semester off uni.

Sorry for painting such a bleak picture. But the good part comes now. My friends picked me up from my house and they reminded me that I was the guy that achieved all those things. And that I have the aptitude to do it again but even better. And that it doesn't matter at what pace I finish my degrees, I will still have them at the end of the day. It doesn't matter that Im single right now. I had the ability to love someone else before and I will have it in the future as well.

So for you please don't feel bad about feeling bad lol. We can't always be at a 100%. Especially after tragedy. And we are bound to stumble, you will grow stronger and you won't feel lonely on your own. You will find someone that enhances your life. You will learn to love yourself and be loved by others in a healthy manor. Just how it takes a while for bones to heal, it takes a while to heal our feelings. I understand that its very painful. But you are alive, and strong and I fully believe you will get better, because it's human nature to evolve."
Drugs,ffasixb,t1_ffaprwk,1579743479.0, You can't take control. It's up to her to take control sadly. All you can really do is give perspective. Absolutely don't support her by giving her money. Maybe pay for a trainer or pay for a counselor. But don't enable her with anything else. Let her know you love her but she's destroying her life and everyone's around her as well with her actions.
Drugs,ffaol2d,t3_esjj0c,1579740834.0,"The more fun you have right now, the more boring the rest of your life will seem. It will be harder to enjoy a fresh snow fall. Or enjoying the beauty of the first leaves that change during autumn. You won't feel as touched when a toddler grabs your finger and offers you food. When you achieve a long term goal it won't hit you the way you want. Instead of enjoying the actual achievement you will just crave the celebration. I hope drugs don't make your life as Grey as it does to others."
Drugs,ffanpo8,t3_esint5,1579740242.0,"Each person is different with how they use drugs. Some people need a gentle touch and need to be shown more love and acceptance and be shown what they are losing. Others are delusional and will say they don't have an issue at all. They will find every way to justify and normalize their behavior.  For these people they need to absolutely hit rock bottom and be left by everyone till they are ready to look at them selves
And admit they have an issue.

Once she is willing to work on herself it is so incredibly imperative that your family stay by her side. She will most likely relapse and feel shitty about it as well but you have to be there to help pick her up. The damage done isn't as permanent as you would think. I have had friends abuse Molly and become better after a year of anti-depressants. Anti depressants alone don't work which is another thing to remember. She will need therapy, and to become more physically fit. Getting her a good trainer will do wonders for her as well. Someone to really exhaust her because insomnia is an absolute bitch while leaving drugs.

Fair warning though. I had crazy withdrawals from anti-depressants and it happens to about 20% of users from anti depressants. I would still recommend it though because her dopamine and seratonin production is most likely screwed up.

Another good resource for you which isnt very well known would be Steve- Os videos on his drug use. It's very honest and will maybe show things from your sisters perspective."
depression,ff1d1uu,t1_ff16n7k,1579477617.0,"https://www.shroomsdirect.ca/

shrooms are like in a legal grey area. so you can find them online easily. LSD is a bit riskier. You would have to find a dealer you trust or synthesize it yourself. Try to buy a test kit for LSD if you get them from a dealer. test kits are about 35$. a tab of LSD runs between 5-20$ depending on where you are. 

Again I will say please do your research and understand the risks of drugs. I'm not a doctor. I would strongly suggest getting a therapist and a personal trainer because, in the long run, they will provide you with the tools for long term happiness."

depression,ff144t6,t3_er3w98,1579475046.0,"There's a lot of ways to go about.
Sometimes there is something blocking us from being motivated, it could be a bad memory or other trauma. Maybe we are aware of it maybe we aren't. Therapy can help us work through that.


Another way is drugs. Do lsd or shrooms when you are in a rut and unable to accomplish anything. It's fairly good reset. But it is a drug so try to educate yourself on the risks and upsides of it. For eg. Don't take it while on anti depressents. You get seratonin syndrome and die. If your family has a history of mental health issues it could trigger that in you.

And if you are already doing drugs. Like smoking weed regularly drinking regularly or doing molly. Take a break from that stuff. You can enjoy the mundane again when you stop living from excitement to excitement. You won't live for the events you will live for everything in between as well."
depression,fet5n52,t3_eqjuqy,1579372051.0,"You need therapy to figure yourself out. Perhaps try medication after a couple sessions of therapy. Or psychedelics. The medication the doctors prescribe can be addictive, and psychedelics can have really bad side effects like psychosis happen so do be careful and consider the pros and cons while choosing what to do. But these things made me more passionate about life. With therapy mixed in which is the most important factor in getting better from depression."
AskReddit,fet2b4r,t1_fesou8s,1579371174.0,So with lsd you have to be careful mixing it with anti depressants.  It Will in the best case be a more stifled boring trip than normal. Or in the worst case you will face seratonin overload which will kill you. It's recommended you be off anti - depressants for 2 weeks before doing acid. And if you feel the anti depressants are helping you it's simply not worth it for you.

depression,feqxxat,t1_feqvcdf,1579347346.0,You just have to take the plunge with out him. Go to a yoga class and say hi to 2-3 people and ask how they are doing and what they do for a living. And try to show interest in their lives. The hard part is that you have to keep plunging yourself into social situations to get better at them. Being socially anxious only gets better by doing more social things. Try to think about how much you appreciate being talked to. So many other people will feel the same way. And I understand that it is really nerve wracking at first. Especially since you don't know these strangers and you don't know when you will find your next best friend. You don't know if you guys will have chemistry. But if you keep trying with people eventually you will find someone you really care for and they will also really care for you.

My fave ones currently are

* overwatch 
* skyrim
* pokemon shield 
* civ 5

Getting dressed up all nice and going out to eat is very under rated too. I understand it can be bit nerve wracking to do but it is well worth it. You might attract some positive attention too because it takes confidence to dine alone and a lot of people really like that confidence.

I don't know if you're a girl or a guy but if you are a girl practicing make up tutorials is rather fun I heard. And if make up ain't your thing start a tutorial series on YouTube or Khan academy. Learning how to use photo shop was fun for me.
You could learn how to draw, play an Instrument.

For instruments a really good start for me was the kalimba. It was a 30$ buy and wasn't crazy hard to learn how to do.

Now I know this one ain't alone. But you don't need anyone else to sign up for a class with you. Taking a class in anything can be fun if the situation is right. Yoga classes, boxing, music classes. They can be collaborative and fun."
depression,fequi1f,t3_eqf51x,1579346134.0,You are searching for the friend you had 10 years ago. People change and that's part of life. You don't have to cut him out of your life if you aren't ready for that. But you have to accept the fact that you aren't the highest priority for him. You need to fill your life with new activities and people. Which is really easy to say but hard to do. The only thing I can say is that it takes time. And you don't know when it will succeed which is the most anxiety inducing part. But eventually with time you will find someone that makes you a priority because they see the value in you :). I would suggest signing up for a martial arts class. Lots of humble and kind people with lots of energy there.
depression,feqtcsi,t3_eqeyze,1579345789.0,"The substance matter is tough. If you look through my post history you can see my history with it.

I agree with the system being broken. I was blessed to go to a university with a good support system that really helped me out. The publicly funded psychiatrist I went to made fun of me for smoking weed and looking for help. He said I deserved what was happening to me. And I was absolutely shocked that can happen to me. But it's more common than you would think.

You aren't alone in facing these structural issues.

Now you might feel that people don't care. But the truth of the matter is that a lot of people really don't care. We walk past homeless people regularly ignoring their pleas for help. We say to ourselves that we really can't change their lives and move on. It's the same with other people. We have to show people that we appreciate them and be of value to them so they can appreciate us and be of value to us. But even that isn't enough. A lot of people will use you and leave. But you have to keep trying because eventually, you will find the person that won't leave you no matter what. And will always care for you. And you will care for them as well."
depression,feqq213,t3_eqeunc,1579344725.0,"When people say it takes time it is 100% true. But you need things other than time as well to help you.

My depression went away because of all the help I had. I had my therapist, I had my trainer, I had my mother, I had my best friends. My diet improved, my fitness improved. My perspectives were changed.

Working through depression is exactly that. It's work. And it gets really tiring, especially with setbacks. While getting fit I injured my back. And it's so painful mentally watching myself fall behind on my goals. But I keep going because I know for sure it gets better with time. And I will achieve my goals one day. Maybe not the day I wanted. But I will eventually get there.

The same applies to you my friend. Setbacks may hurt, but remember that you are still making progress in the long run. We can't just fixate on one kerfuffle in our timeline. We have to look at the whole picture and see all that we have done :)."

I would say avoid psychedelics if you have underlying psychological issues and you have absolutely no experience with drugs.
If you have smoked weed like 10-20x at least you should be safe.


There is the risk of psychosis and having a schizophrenic break if your family has a record of mental illness.


My father is an alcoholic and shows obvious signs of depression. I myself was diagnosed with chronic depression by my doctor. And I took the plunge anyways.



It really helped me personally. I had gotten out of a 2 year relationship. She was the first girl I felt like I would marry so I took it really hard. I felt like I wouldnt be able to trust and love anyone the same way again. But the acid made me truly believe the things my therapist and friends were telling me. I really believed that that there are so many humans out there and there has to be someone that can invoke that kind of love and trust out of me again.


This was like 6 hours into the trip the first 6 are just giggles and fun and general tripping. Paintings turned melty faces turned big.  All the fun stuff.


It helped me with my anxiety and depression. But it didn't cure it by itself. I can say with 100% confidence I'm not depressed anymore. Sure I get sad and I get lonely occasionally but that ain't depression.


I owe the cure of my depression to my therapist, personal trainer, and friends and family. My underlying issues being fixed is what cured my anxiety and depression. I was on anti- depressants as well and I really wish I never took them. Weaning off them was incredibly painful. The first time I went from 20 to 15 MG of escitalopram and 2 weeks in I was really close to killing myself. It felt like the pain would never end. For a full week It was near unbearable to live It seemed impossible for me to have a positive thought. I had to sleep with friends or my parents every night because I was really concerned I would end my life.


I went back to 20 and after a couple weeks I was back to normal.



I felt like I'd be stuck on this drug my whole life. But after a couple more months it had been about 8 months since I was put on the drug. And I was stronger physically and mentally because of the therapy.



This time I started weaning off on November 24 and was fully off them by December 23rd. While leaving them this time thankfully there wasn't severe mental side effects. I had some heightened anxiety but it wasn't anything I couldn't handle. However I had severe migraines.  My doctor first said go back to your anti depressants and I said no. I was tired of feeling dumb and numb all the time. And he gave some naproxen which didn't work. I went back and he prescribed another medication. I asked if it was an anti depressant. And he said it isn't. I went home and Googled the medication and it was an anti depressant but the tricyclic type. At this point I was done with this doctor. I started smoking weed 2-3x a day to deal with the migraines.



Then I went to a different doctor. And this one actually took the time to do all the check ups. And prescribed me a different anti-inflammatory drug. And it worked.



I'm completely Off weed and anti depressants now and I think this is the happiest I've been in my life.
