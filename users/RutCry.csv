This was in the 60’s, back when cars had chrome bumpers that were not the same height, and the mismatch made the damage much much worse.  

It was 50 years ago and I can still see her pinned with her palms on the hood of the car trying to push it away as it slowly happened, screaming “NO!  NO!”

Showerthoughts,feccwbw,t1_fe91us8,1578970968.0,"There are many reasons why UBI will not work IRL, but the main objection is that such wealth redistribution would require ruinous taxation to provide the money.  That money has to come from *somewhere*, and there is no other place to take it than from the people who have earned it in the first place.  

Don’t even bother to trot out the “tax the rich” lie; it’s never going to be enough money. UBI would be REQUIRE a HUGE chunk out of every working person’s paycheck.  The net effect would actively discourage productivity and innovation because there would no longer be a reward for creating better mousetraps.  

Such a scheme would destroy our prosperity and ultimately benefit no one, except for those who actually *seek* to destroy our way of life in preference for a political system that has already failed in every other time and place it has been tried.  

I can’t help but think that is the actual goal of those who promote UBI.  

Aside from that, UBI would swell the ranks of the dependent class and actively discourage their escape from it.  The excuse that people, disconnected from
the need to provide for themselves, would be free to pursue their dreams is another lie.  Why work to improve your situation when your basic needs are given to you by Big Brother, and any success you earn is only going to be taxed away?"
