stopdrinking,feg6h94,t1_feg5q07,1579079229.0,I know you dont want to hear it but if you are getting trembling so bad you avoid people you may want to keep drinking until a doctor can help you out. You are suffering withdrawal which can (not to be scary) cause seizures and even death. I am not trying to scare you but the fact is that without proper care quiting booze can kill some people. I think its 1 in 20 who suffer with withdrawal so you're not alone in your struggle. Dont try  to do this alone or that's exactly how your family will feel if something happens to you.  Make an appointment in the morning. If you feel ashamed asking for help then there is nothing wrong with you. Admitting you have a problem is a big step and will take its toll and that's progress.

skin,fcmm090,t3_ehq2ea,1577780945.0,I have a ton of  skin damage from beaches as a kid too. Mostly on my shoulders chest and back. Just moisturize as often as possible and hope for the best.  We can't repair skin. It's like broken glass. All we can do is care for it now that its damaged. Theres no miracle fix all or anything like that. My face used to be covered in freckles but bc I got burnt so bad it became blisters so many times I no longer have them on my face.  It sucks but it's true. Our largest organ is our epidermis and never listening to people when they told us to protect it at a younger age has really screwed us up.
skin,fcmh1ji,t3_ehwnje,1577774964.0,"Maybe a cyst? 

Milia are small, bump-like cysts found under the skin. They are usually 1 to 2 millimeters (mm) in size. They form when skin flakes or keratin, a protein, become trapped under the skin. Milia most often appear on the face, commonly around the eyelids and cheeks, though they can occur anywhere"
