I provided multiple studies that pointed out that this is the case. If you're curious about the mechanisms for how it works, there are a litany of possibilities. Higher pay means more stability in their home life which in turn leads to better job performance. Higher pay could also mean lower stress and as such better performance. There a multiple studies that show that happiness and income are directly correlated (up to a certain point, around 75k/yr on average in the US) [Source](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html), and happier people are generally better workers. These are just off of the top of my head. 

>The study suggests that worker who’s payment is closer to their managers payment feel treated more fairly

It's not because their pay is closer to the managers, it's because their pay is better than it was. The manager's pay is irrelevant. I'm not sure where you got this idea from

> Following the chain reaction that with higher minimum wage we could see a drop in qualification then this also could lead longterm to a drop in quality given that we only raise minimum wage jobs.

It seems you didn't follow my reasoning then because I was pointing out that a rising tide rises all ships. Raising the minimum wage would create market pressures that would force higher skilled work to be paid more. Re-read my previous comment again after I said ""That's a big ""if"".""

Right. And the assumption here is that lower paid workers are being paid for less than the value of their work. It's possible that other people that are paid better are also still not being paid fairly for their work. If it is the case that they only realize this when the people being paid less than them get a federally mandated raise, so be it. I don't see how this is an argument against a minimum wage.

>If there is no difference in payment between jobs that require high qualification and jobs with lower required qualification then why bother get the qualification needed at all?

That's a big ""if"". Isn't it just as likely that higher paid minimum wage would mean more people are likely to be OK working those jobs, creating a lower supply of workers for higher skilled jobs, thereby increasing the demand for higher skilled workers and as such increased wages for those jobs?

>So may people leave the company because they feel their qualification is not appreciated. Or the company is unable to get qualified worker for jobs with higher requirements because they don’t offer some kind of premium to people with these qualifications.

Yes totally. I don't think that just people making minimum wage are underpaid. I think a LOT of people working across many industries are underpaid for their work. It's just the case that people working minimum wage jobs are the most vulnerable.

>My thought was that worker who get more wage because of higher minimum wage may not feel treated more fairly because the reason of their wage isn’t appreciation for their work but outside rules.

I don't see where you're going with this. We can all agree that there is an adversarial relationship between workers and management. Management makes a profit off of the difference between how much labor they can squeeze out of workers, and how much they can charge others for the output of this labor. 

>So they don’t feel like they are treated more fairly they feel like they just get the minimum of fairness the state requires.

higher pay correlates to better service.

>raising the minimum wage to $15 like small businesses suffering,

If your business can't afford to exist without paying it's employees decent wages, then your company can't afford to exist. This is pretty cut and dry. That being said, study after study have shown that it is simply not the case the raising minimum wages hurts businesses. The restaurant industry thrives in equal treatment states. In one of the most comprehensive studies on the minimum wage, researchers aggregated the results of over four decades of studies on the employment effects of the minimum wage. They concluded that there is “little or no significant impact of minimum wage increases on employment.” Affected businesses are typically able to absorb additional labor costs through increases in productivity, reductions in turnover costs, compressing internal wage ladders, and modest price increases [Source](http://cepr.net/publications/reports/why-does-the-minimum-wage-have-no-discernible-effect-on-employment). Furthermore, research specific to the tipped minimum wage also found no significant effect on employment. [Source](https://irle.berkeley.edu/files/2015/Tipped-Wage-Effects-on-Earnings-and-Employment-in-Full-Service-Restaurants.pdf)

You gave an example of Taco Bell in your area being shit but Chic-fil-A being great. Taco Bell pays their employees minimum wages while CFA pays above minimum wages [Source](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Employer=Chick-Fil-A_Inc/Hourly_Rate) so anecdotally in your own situation higher pay does in fact lead to better service.

Another way to think about this is if you are being paid literally the least possible it is legally permitted for you to be paid (and this amount is woefully inadequate in terms of providing you with a stable living situation), why would you give a shit about how good you are at your job. Clearly, the company doesn't give a fuck about you, so what is the impetus to work hard at all? Worker productivity has risen significantly over time while real wages (minimum wage with inflation taken into account) have decreased [Source](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/), why do anything *but* be lazy in your job?

Here are some minimum/tipped wage fun facts:

1. Women, African Americans, and Hispanic workers have disproportionately benefited from minimum wage increases in Washington, D.C [Source](https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-d-c-minimum-wage/). 

2. Contrary to popular opinion, the vast majority of minimum-wage earners are not teenagers or college students working part-time jobs. Only 12% of minimum wage workers are teenagers, more women make minimum wage than men, nearly a third of them have children and on average they earn half of their families total income [Source](https://www.epi.org/publication/wage-workers-older-88-percent-workers-benefit/).

3. In the states where tipped workers are paid the federal tipped minimum wage of $2.13 per hour 18.5 percent of waiters, waitresses, and bartenders are in poverty. Yet in the states where they are paid the regular minimum wage before tips (equal treatment states), the poverty rate for waitstaff and bartenders is only 11.1 percent. So the lower wages for tipped workers seem to directly correlate to their poverty rates.

4. Wage theft is particularly acute in food and drink service, and restaurants across the country have been found to be in violation of wage and hour laws. It is true that the law requires restaurants to ensure that tipped workers receive at least the regular minimum wage when their tips are included, but the reality is that huge numbers of restaurants—helped by too-weak enforcement efforts—ignore these requirements. In investigations of over 9,000 restaurants, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) found that 84 percent of investigated restaurants were in violation of wage and hour laws, including nearly 1,200 violations of the requirement to bring tipped workers’ wages up to the minimum wage. Among the restaurants that were investigated, tipped workers were cheated out of nearly $5.5 million. Workers in the food and drink service industries are more likely to suffer minimum wage violations than workers in other industries. [Source](https://www.epi.org/publication/waiting-for-change-tipped-minimum-wage/)

All this is to say that there are soooo many reasons to raise wages for workers, most of which deal with the quality of life of those people and not the service you get at restaurants. It's so fucked, that at this point it's not really relevant how good/bad your service is since many of these people are struggling just to survive. I have more concern for the people working two jobs making minimum wage and their quality of life than that of the guy on the receiving end of their work. But even so, since OP seems to care:

I am exaggerating here, as few centrists truly believe these things, but at times centrists come off as such. Just wait for the weekly ""why are you a centrist"" thread where every other post is a variation of ""I have a balanced view of things and don't believe something just because one side says it. I avoid bias at all costs and try my best to stick to the facts."" Of course, this is a good thing and most people should strive to act in such a way.

AskHistorians,fehmntb,t3_ep1czn,1579119641.0,"Short answer, yes (at least in the western world). Water was dangerous to drink in many places, and without the germ theory of disease people didn't really understand the importance of boiling/purifying water to prevent illness. As such, water was often eschewed in favor of the safer, alcoholic drinks.

[History of the World in Six Glasses](https://smile.amazon.com/History-World-6-Glasses/dp/0802715524) is a fantastic book that touches on this. One of the theories put forth in the book was that the introduction of coffee to Western Europe helped fuel the enlightenment. Because it was made with boiled water, coffee was safer to drink than the water in most places, and consider that with the spread of the drink the population went from carrying a steady buzz all day to being sober/being keyed up from the caffeine. Tied to this was the interesting way in which coffeehouses functioned at this time. It was sort of like the internet, with each coffeeshop being a website about a difference subject. Want to talk about science and disect stuff over a few cups? Go to this shop. Want to talk politics while drinking your java? Head over here. People like Isaac Newton would drink cup after cup after cup while working in these coffeeshops.

The book also talks about how early beer was more like a ""liquid bread."" Heavy, lots of calories and carbohydrates, safe to drink because of the alcohol. In fact, another theory put forth by the book is that one of the reasons Indus Valley civilizations turned to agrarianism (despite the ROI for calories being worse that for hunter/gatherer societies) was to be able to regularly brew beer (as opposed to make bread, as other theories suggest)."

Do you honestly believe that there are people out there who think ""100 companies are **solely** responsible for climate change?""

>which brings us back to absolving blame from individuals.

I feel like I have chosen my words very carefully to illustrate that neither I, nor the people using the fact that 100 companies are responsible for 71% of emissions, believe this means *only* companies should do anything. I've said multiple times that individuals making choices for ecological reasons is a good thing. You're creating another strawman here and arguing against a point that no one is making, and that is the second time in as many comments that you've done so.

>Those are huge companies that collectively have millions of employees and service billions of end user.

Yeah, exactly. So forcing them to change will have massive downstream effects. That is the point of bringing up this stat.

> Those are huge companies that collectively have millions of employees and service billions of end user. It seems extreme, but once you dig into what companies it is, it is simply a statement of how big energy companies are, which is only a problem if you think large companies are a bad thing in itself.

I have a distinct feeling you haven't actually looked this up. Did you look at the list of companies? They're all fossil fuel companies. They're bad because they're fossil fuel companies, not necessarily because they're big. And for that matter none of them are even in the top 10 of employers in the world, and not a single one cracks half a million employees. Only two are in the top 50 largest employers (Gazprom and Rosneft Oil). Even so, for the sake of argument, let's say every one of these top 100 emitters employ 500k. That's 50 million people. So 50 million people are creating 71% of global carbon emissions. 71% of the population of the world (7 billion) is around 5.5 billion. Seems to me like they're producing far more than their fair share of emissions per capita.


https://www.statista.com/statistics/264671/top-20-companies-based-on-number-of-employees

Again, the entire concept here is that top down change will have a greater impact as a result of less ""effort"" than bottom up change. No one is saying individual choice doesn't matter. No one is saying that these 100 companies are the sole issue and shutting them down/breaking them up will solve everything."
