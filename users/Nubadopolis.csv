Leftyguitarists,fenpuif,t1_fenoh11,1579289135.0,"Well it’s a matter of reaching out to the person of interest and asking if they would be interested in participating. Some dig it, some don’t. His focus is elsewhere."
Leftyguitarists,fennq58,t1_fengy1t,1579288350.0,FWIW I reached out to him a while ago asking if he would be willing to do an AMA here. He declined. He is more interested in product reviews and building his channel base.
Leftyguitarists,fenmnqe,t1_fen0pcw,1579287953.0,"Yes they have gotten much better. Their first year or two their quality wasn’t that great. Then Rick changed manufacturers and quality has been much better. 

Think G&L Tribute level quality."

I was surprised when I started this sub that it hadn’t existed before. I spent the past 6 years trying my (left) hand at guitar and recently concluded it isn’t the right instrument for me. I created /r/leftyguitarists a few years back and it took off pretty well. Here’s hoping this sub picks up speed too!

Drums are where I feel at home. Thanks again for joining!"

drums,fdig1yf,t3_eljzua,1578442089.0,"Good playing. I would also suggest practicing limb independence. Try keeping your hi-hat on the 8th notes while doing a syncopated fill with the bass & snare. 

Good luck & have fun!"
