MorbidReality,fepddax,t3_eq1lor,1579317740.0,Dude’s house is/was (they tore it down I think) is a 5 minute walk from me. It’s creepy as hell knowing a sick fuck like that lived near me. You always think in that  “not in my town” mentality and something like this happens.
AMA,fentd57,t3_epycy7,1579290528.0,"As a cancer survivor, make sure you know you didn’t lose a fight against that tumor. You just took that fight to another place. Give as many hugs and kisses while you can, that’s what people will miss, that physical touch.  You are brave as fuck. I admire that and you’re making me (and probably a lot of people) realize what they can do to work through everything that comes up.

But question for you: What’s your favorite color? And I love anime and scary movies and ghost shows...got any recommendations for me? 🙂

And like everyone, a huge virtual hug. I’m a pretty tiny girl, but I’d give you the strongest hug that I have in me.  ❤️"

But I thought the same about Rocky, he won’t be confused about the world around him. My biggest call was that I wanted him to go while he still knew who I was and not just some stranger he has no idea who why are putting him down.

I wish with all my heart that there’ll be a cure or better treatments for them so we don’t have to watch them go through all that. Chloe and Rocky are running around like crazy and loving life again. 🙂"

It’s horrible to watch your best friend go down like that. But after reading all the literature about CCD, it’s better than too early than a week too late. I talked (and still talk) to my boo all the time asking him for help training our dog and make sure things are okay with her, or even just to say hi. I’m so very sorry for your loss, OP.

Rabbits,fdkjb6e,t1_fdj640g,1578504904.0,"I am also a vet tech, and a bite of something like this isn’t sought after but won’t do much damage for 20 seconds of a bite. Same as when a dog gets an M&M off the floor, it probably isn’t going to kill them. I took the picture, which took 5 seconds, and then took it away from here. I do appreciate the concern but if you want to be helpful, you shouldn’t come at it with kind of elitist attitude. I’m not mistreating my pets whatsoever.

My old dog died last May, and I still talk to him like he’s around. That helped (and still helps) me a lot. We got a new dog and I even ask my old dog to help her. Even if the message to him doesn’t get there, it’s cathartic to me.

Good luck and I hope it goes smoothly for you and your boyfriend. And just remember all the wonderful times you shared with your pooch. I’m so very sorry. ❤️"
dogs,fdaszs7,t3_ekcdai,1578249723.0,"I’m so sorry about your loss of Sandy, she sounds like one hell of a dog! I hope you had many beautiful moments together over your long companionship. And I bet she thanks you for giving her a wonderful life.

There is no right or wrong when it comes to choosing to get another dog “too soon”. Some people do it the next day, some years, and some never again. So I think it’s absolutely great you’re willing to have another pup in your life. In my experience, I literally chose the opposite of my old dog Rocky (and just FYI I got my current pup Harper 10 days after Rocky went to Rainbow Bridge). Rocky was a male Silkyhuahua (Silky Terrier + Chihuahua) who was about 13 pounds and black and brown with a little white mohawk. He was 8 when I adopted him and died last May at 16. Harper, in the other hand, is a female thats around 38 pounds now, I think she’s a Corgibull (Corgi + pittie) and is tan. She’s also a puppy and she just turned 1 last October. I read somewhere it was a good idea not to get a similar dog and I wholeheartedly support that. I would have lost it having another dog that was a Rocky twin. I would have expected him/her to be exactly like Rocky and I just would have been so resentful they weren’t being Rocky. So getting a puppy, not black, female dog was so much better because she can live up to being Harper instead of being in Rocky’s shadow. But there will never be another Rocky just like there will never be another Sandy.

But anyway, it is ultimately your choice. If you want a Golden Lab again, that’s totally fine! If you want a different breed, that works out too! What matters most is how well you connect with that dog when you see them and want to bring them home. Good luck! ❤️"
dogs,fdah5q6,t3_ekd1uc,1578246086.0,"I use a Kong harness and a retractable leash (for walks) and a nylon Kong leash (for going into stores or similar situations). I am 110% subscribed to a harness. It makes it so much safer and easier to have a harness if they bolt or you need them to go another way. But either way, I’m a fan of Kong products. They’re always tough and in my experience, so far, they never break or tear."

MorbidReality,fcj08iv,t1_fci1qb5,1577674055.0,"I live in Chicago and in August, everyone knows the summers are hot. I was rushed to the ER after a doctor that was performing a small procedure took my temperature. My body temperature was 94.6 degrees (Fahrenheit) and it was 98 degrees (F) outside. The ER doctor diagnosed me a hypothermic and started body warming procedures right away. It made absolutely no sense but that’s what the official ruling is. I have almost no memory of what was happening (not really sure why it made me not remember) but I remember telling my Mom I was cold and about 30-35 minutes after that I kept telling Mom I was so hot and started trying to take my T-shirt off because “I was fine”. Could be similar to me!"
dogs,fcfyhon,t3_eh3gql,1577634838.0,"This got me right in the feels. I had a really similar situation. I got my Rocky (Silkyhuahua) when I was living on a military base with my piece of shit ex. Then we got Spot (SBT) because he wanted “a bigger dog he could play rough with”. When driving to our new base, he was going to hit Spot and I told him not to touch the dog. He then started hitting me instead. After we got to the new base, he drugged me, beat the fuck out of me and pushed me down the stairs then he brought me to a psych hospital claiming I did it to myself. I was packing up to leave the next day and I went to take both dogs but he took Spot from me, locked the car and I couldn’t take her. Rocky got me through all of that and the aftermath of the whole situation. He passed away this year at age 16 (he was 8 when I got him) but we had a wonderful life together. There’s no doubt in my mind that if it weren’t for him, I wouldn’t have been able to handle everything. I guess Rocky’s help everyone! I hope you and your Rocky continue your absolutely wonderful connection and that you live a better life after what happened to you. The best revenge is massive success so show him that he never deserved such an amazing person like you in his life, OP. ❤️"
lastimages,fcftrht,t3_egw9n1,1577633681.0,I don’t think I have ever heard something as evil as this. There’s so many things this poor girl will never experience. She never even got to finish high school. (I know the school system is different in the UK but to us in the US go to high school until around 17-18.) It’s disgusting that this boy bragged about it but his friends would cook breakfast for him if he killed her. Him and his friends are fucking pieces of shit.
