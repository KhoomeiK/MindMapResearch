My dad told him to go home and he started crying that his wife left him. My dad still told him to just go home and get some rest (the guy didn't say anything about wanting to die so my dad didn't say anything). I was home visiting that weekend (I live 5 hrs from my parents).

I didn't vote for Trump or Clinton in 2016. For this years election I don't plan on voting either. People will say ""You don't have the right to complain if you don't vote."" Fact of the matter is I have every right to complain, because I don't support any of the candidates because 90% of their objectives don't align with mine. There are aspects of each candidate I like but not enough to endorse ANY of them. In that case it's my right NOT to vote because I don't support either of them.   


For this election I would be more inclined to vote for Trump than the last. In 2016 it felt like it was ""I'm not really sure if Trump will be elected. Holy shit he was actually elected."" Since being elected literally all you hear about is how the Russians interfered with the election. You never hear about policies that are actually being passed by the president and government. If you want to, you have to seek them out. With Obama the republicans wanted him out and now it's the exact opposite, and it's quite annoying to be honest. I know and recognize changes made in the Obama administration are still seen to this day. Unemployment rates are down from what they were due to THOSE changes and this is great. After Trump was elected there was a higher confidence in the markets. 

Then the shit with the tax returns. Get the fuck over it, he probably doesn't pay anything in taxes like the rest of the billionaires in the USA. With tax reform don't piss and moan because of what happened in the past, prevent it from happening in the future.

baseball,fdiwfrl,t1_fdivqxi,1578452582.0,"Honestly depends on what you're looking for in a ball game. Citi Field is definitely more family friendly. The lines aren't nearly as long at the vendors and it's slightly cheaper (I've heard people say it's ALOT cheaper, I didn't think so). Parking and Tailgate is much better at Citi as well.   


Myself I prefer the Old Yankee Stadium as most Yankee fans do. But since I'm a young adult that enjoys a good party very few things beat sitting in the Yankee Stadium Bleachers during the playoffs. I feel that getting around Yankee Stadium is a bit easier as well. The character of the ball park has definitely come out in the past few years.

After the second failed hearing exam that day they told me they will schedule another hearing exam at a later date. They wanted to assume it was just a day with bad hearing I suppose.
