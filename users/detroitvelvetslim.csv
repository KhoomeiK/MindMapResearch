However, you aren't going to make money selling ""cheap and simple"" to the Yeti Cooler SALT LIFE crowd, who instead wants the ANGERY V6 Tacoma and will torpedo their financial stability by buying a Ford Raptor to big-dick people on their commute into the city. 

Essentially, Nissan went downmarket and dug in to survive the recession, but didn't recover and start selling premium products after. Now the innovation gap is so vast that they can't compete with companies that did pivot into high-margin and upmarket segments, and they are going to be unable to make the needed investments in both technology and brand perception, especially as new players like Kia have crowded into Nissans traditional space."

If we ever get to a future where people are working for dozens or hundreds of years at remote sites before returning, I'm betting we'd see 1 of 2 types of contracts: a discounted, upfront lump-sum, or a perpetual, non-inflating salary for the duration. 

Another interesting consideration would be what the result of colonizing outer space do to financial markets? If real economic output accelerates at an exponential rate as resources become easier to extract and production becomes simpler, this would put strong, deflationary pressure on financial markets. A reserve Bank might have to engage in constant, massive stimulus just to keep inflation at 0. 

Also, a steady-state level of inflation might be necessary if people spread out far enough and trade. Imagine trying to close a transaction with 6 months of delay, if you knew the amount of inflation that would occur during that time you would have less risk in how you price your goods and services."
