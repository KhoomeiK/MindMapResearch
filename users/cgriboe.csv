Ep 164 - Tim's Rant on ""Tyrannical Government""

""People think that if we give up the weapons, the government will start to get tyrannical. Start? They'll ‘start.’ What do you think the government would do if we didn't have the weapons?

""Do you think potentially the government might start spying on everybody? Listening to their phone calls and reading their emails? Do you think possibly the government might suspend habeus corpus and decide you are an enemy combatant and lock you up in prison, not charge you with a crime, keep you indefinitely and torture you? Do you think the government would start doing that?  Do you think the government would start taking whistleblowers and locking them into little boxes and making them go insane when they said the military is slaughtering civillains and the NSA is acting without congressional authority to wiretap everyone? You think the CIA would start spying on the Senate Intelligence Committee and destroying tapes of their interrogations? Do you think Elites would start engaging in illicit sexual behavior like pedophile on private islands and murder the only person who could testify about it even though he was in a maximum security prison? Do you think they would get us into endless wars without any explanation? Do you think they would murder journalists? If we gave up the guns?"""
