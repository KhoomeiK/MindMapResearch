bipolar,ffg1nzy,t1_fdsozkq,1579896527.0,"Thank you so much for posting that. My husband reads that stuff (really want to use another 's' word here) and gets all defeated, like it'll never work. We've been on this roller coaster together for 20 years now, so I'm thinking maybe it's a suspect and/or irrelevant statistic (and bogus).   


It reminds me of a line from Fight Club: ""On a long enough timeline, everyone's life expectancy is 0."" Something like that. I mean, after 20 years, are we really sure it was the bp that did the marriage in? C'mon. Life is more complex than that."

As someone else mentioned, the phrase 'day of the rope' is found in some seriously f'ed up white supremacist book. That would definitely make sense.

Man, I tried that one and just could not get into it. Maybe I didn't make it far enough in... Does it get better after the bit where the young woman decides to marry the guy with money? (That \*can't\* be a spoiler; if so, someone lmk & I'll edit it out of this msg.)"

I once had a passport renewed at the county tax office in Boerne, TX, and the woman there had nearly perfect penmanship. Not florid like this, but rather like a serif font you'd find in a textbook. Of course I commented on it, and she told me that her father would make her re-do homework until the writing was acceptable to him (I believe she said he was an architect.) No doubt her 10-year-old self hated it, but I imagine her 30-something self is grateful and proud."

AskReddit,fdkbtza,t3_elbejj,1578500568.0,"""Which begs the question."" 

It's almost always used incorrectly. 'Begs' in this context means ASSUMES. So, begging the question is making an assumption. The phrase is meant to point out an error in a logical argument. 

But, like the misuse of the word 'plethora' (which means 'an excessive amount,' not 'a lot'), the battle has been lost."
