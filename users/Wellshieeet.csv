UnresolvedMysteries,ffga6hz,t3_etds9x,1579901779.0,"[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum theft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_Stewart_Gardner_Museum_theft) is the obvious one. 

I also found the Nationalmuseum theft from 2000 interesting. If you scroll down on [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_theft) it says:

"" One Rembrandt and two Renoir paintings were stolen from the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, Sweden, after three armed thieves, **who had diverted the attention of police by setting off two separate** **car bombs** **nearby beforehand**, broke into the museum and fled using a boat, moored nearby. By 2001, the police had recovered one of the Renoirs and by March 2005 they had recovered the second one in Los Angeles. That year, in September, they recovered the Rembrandt in a sting operation in a hotel in Copenhagen. ""

Reminds me of the [NOKAS robbery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOKAS_robbery) where they set fire to a truck outside of the parking house for the police so the police couldn't get out quick enough to stop the robbery, but that's a bank robbery, not art heist.

I also remember reading [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Rescue-Artist-Thieves-Missing-Masterpiece-ebook/dp/B003V1WUIU) (I think that's the one) years ago about an undercover cop trying to recover [The Scream after the 1994 theft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream#1994_theft)."

I don't think any alien came here on purpose though. I've heard this theory about octopuses, but I believe people that actually know stuff about things say that there is absolutely nothing about them that would suggest that they did not evolve on earth. 

&#x200B;

I'd also like to add this theory; If I showed you a picture of a frog that was recently discovered after being thought extinct for 200 years, and a picture of a regular frog that's not special at all and didn't tell you about the first one, but then asked you to tell me why one of them is special, you wouldn't be able to (unless you're a frog expert). So since most of us don't know a lot about animals it could be that we see animals that are thought to be extinct all the time but just don't know it. So my second theory is that a lot animals that are thought to be extinct aren't really, because nobody reports them since we don't know."

 After the referendum overwhelmingly confirmed by a 79 percent majority (259,563 votes for and 69,264 against) that Norwegians desired to retain a monarchy, Prince Carl was formally offered the throne of Norway by the Storting (parliament) and was elected on 18 November 1905. """
