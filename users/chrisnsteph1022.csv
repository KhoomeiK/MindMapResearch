Maybe you’re talking about the building permit to add the door, but it sounds like you mean an ongoing permit just to own a garage.

Therefore, it’s not lack of trust in their character, but knowledge that they lack the proper resources to make the best decisions. They lack impulse control and knowledge of consequences.
