AskReddit,fdsep18,t1_fdsbw81,1578700995.0,"Unless you taint all the good times with a lot of bad times. I had a lot of good times with my dad which always ended up with him throwing a tantrum for now reason and giving me the silent treatment for weeks at a time. I text my dad on his birthday and Father’s Day now. My youngest sister has disowned him, and my middle sister just plays “bitch” to him whenever he gets out of line.
  
Always keep your selfishness in check, put your children first, and love them unconditionally, they didn’t ask to be born so giving them the gift of life is nothing if you don’t do these things."

After the election This American Life had a good objective piece of the facts that make Hillary so polarizing. Nothing illegal, she just plays politics in a very slimy way. The republicans could make her look unappealing with facts, they just go the crazy route to convince their uneducated base. If you follow her career as a Democrat and support her, it’s not very different of people that support trump. That being said, she is incredibly capable in government and when push comes to shove, how many hours did she testify during the Benghazi incident vs trump testifying about Russia, Ukraine, obstruction or justice, his taxes, his double set of books in NY, his unqualified children given high profile government positions, his long list of sexual misconduct accusations, his charity money theft, his defrauding of students through his university...????"

Can’t find a job about a month after I moved across the country. My now ex decides to offer to have him move in with us. Moves in with us, supposedly for a couple months. Ends up staying there 3 years. My ex and I can’t get rid of him so we pretend to break up and I move into a friend’s house. He tries to move in with me, I put a stop to it since there’s only so many rooms. My friend develops a cancerous intratable heart tumor and my dad moves in with my bestie from Art School. Surprisingly he manages to not poison that relationship. At this point he’s poisoned our relationship so bad there’s no going back so I break up with her. I start dating another girl and we decide to move in together after a year. He tells me he wants to move my mom and sister to our state. I’m friends with our rental manager she offers to hire me as maintenance and train me, he says, I want that job too! So I give it up for him since I had a decent paying job. No we have free rent, which he’s never helped pay or help with. I tell him, give me a year of not paying rent so I can pay off my student loans. He agrees. Literally a week later he’s move my mom in, come to find out he hates my girl and he figured she’d just move out since we could have more than 5 people in the place. Last year I found out that he’s become very verbally abusive and controlling of my mom, more so than before. At that point I decided to cut all ties. I text him for his birthday and Father’s Day and that is it.
  
I have very bad PTSD from years of abuse from him. I used to have recurring nightmares about his emotional abuse even though he beat me on occasion, he would give me the silent treatment for months all while “mean mugging” me. The nightmares aren’t as frequent anymore but they pop up from time to time. I have had a very rich life with a lot of jobs and accomplishments and I still feel like a failure because of him."
