todayilearned,ff3053u,t1_ff2dpty,1579530084.0,"As a person familiar with blood banks, I disagree with your post, and I feel like the way you phrased it kind of contributes to distrust in the medical profession.

Like u/chrisms150 said, there weren't tests available that could screen/identify HIV yet when Asimov underwent tranfusions (1983). The first developed test approved by FDA weren't available until 1985. Unfortunately, in science/healthcare, there is often a lag behind that which providers are capable of testing for and treating versus what they see clinically presenting in their patients. 

Something you need to realize too is blood tranfusions are given with guidelines - Asimov received a transfusion during a cardiac procedure, so it was likely urgently needed - without it he could have died acutely essentially from bleeding out. 

Similarly Ryan White had to receive many tranfusions also in the times preceding development of adequate infectious disease screening, with risk of bleeding if not received. Blood tranfusions that are given out inappropriate can be blamed, but with patients like Asimov and White, the only thing that could have changed was if testing was available for the infection, but it wasn't.

I do agree though that suppressing the information isn't the best, and people should be aware of the risks. For tranfusions it is  more important to prevent the patient from dying immediately than it is to risk exposure to infectious diseases. And since the technology wasn't available yet to detect the virus and not all blood was tainted, spreading information without an answer could cause hysteria and people not accepting tranfusions even if they direly needed it. That is probably what the doctors feared, because most likely they gave blood appropriately (because it was needed), not worried about being blamed for being ""shitty"". 

Though honestly, in White's case, I would blame the people around him for their cruelty..but think of how scared people were of people who were exposed to Ebola coming back to the US...it is one of the dark sides of human nature. :(

Nowadays, fortunately technology is available to screen for infectious diseases (and treat many of them), and questionnaires available to decrease chances of disease in the donor's. So if giving blood make sure you answer your questions honestly! There are reasons behind all the questions and you can always ask to clarify!

It can slide 2 slides at a time, and uses objectives from Olympus. I had issues with it one day and the representatives were very responsive even outside of their stated business hours. I haven't had experience with other slide scanners though, so I don't have a comparison."
