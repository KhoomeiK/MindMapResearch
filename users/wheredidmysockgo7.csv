The grass doesn't look like it's been mowed in a while, but there are some pretty flowers. You can't pick the flowers without damaging the petals and ruining them. 
When you go to enter, you don't see a tall registry. It's one of those crooked wooden desks, similar to the ones in school. It's well organized and everything seems to have a place. You're met with a short man. He seems to be rather friendly, but gives off confusing sarcasm. After spending half an hour getting registered, he gives you an address. 
Once you find the address after getting slightly lost you walk in through the chain fencing. It's nothing special. You've got a pretty nice porch, and it's a pretty big house. You've got a 1 acre property, but that's really it. 
The interior of the house isn't awful, but it isn't great. The style isn't very consistent, but everything seems to complement each other. 

When you go to look around Mehven, it looks decent. There are stores within two miles of each other, with restaurants littered between them. The restaurants aren't 5 stars. But they're never below 3 stars. 
When you eat, it's never going to be completely fullfilling. You're always stuck in-between ""I'm full"" and ""I could eat"". 
Wifi will never be full bars, it'll always be half decent. Everything is never gonna be awful, or awesome. Just 'ok'"
SuicideWatch,ff37bh3,t1_ff2n3ul,1579535406.0,"I'm calling this a relapse because I went from having top marks in my class, amazing friends, doing pretty good emotionally too. Now I've got the worst grades in my grade, abusive home life, and I'm mentally in the fucking shitter. Half the time I'm numb to litterally anything, or I want to just fucking die. I went from great and happy, to eating disorders, self abuse, and crying myself to sleep.
