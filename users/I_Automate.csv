Be careful how hard you throw those rocks, stranger."
interestingasfuck,fendm4k,t1_fenc59b,1579282422.0,"For that, you'd still be looking at internal compartments that are as small as possible, with strong internal bulkheads, and small passageways between them, that have numerous pressure doors that stay closed whenever not being used. Take a look at what the inside of a modern naval ship looks like. They are built with the exact same considerations in mind, and that's exactly how they're built nowadays, and how they've been built for the last 100+ years.

Adding space between systems isn't going to be as vital as putting as much armour between those systems and any possible enemy fire will be. Strong internal bulkheads count as armour here. Obviously you don't want everything touching, but if given the choice between putting a vital system close to another system, or putting it near the outside of the hull...... you put it close to the other system. Of course you don't put your backup life support directly adjacent to your primary, but....yea. 

Being a bigger target by adding empty internal space doesn't help your survivability. That makes everything heavier, and less durable. If anything, add multiple layers of thin spaced armour around the outside of your ship. Something to the effect of a ""whipple shield"", which is currently in use for spacecraft. Incoming projectiles will tend to be incredibly high velocity, so giving them time to break up will help quite a bit. 

As for nukes.....unless you go to something exotic like bomb pumped X-ray lasers or nuclear shaped charges (casba-howitzer, interesting reading!), the warhead will have to get very, VERY close, relatively speaking, to do much damage. No atmosphere in space to carry a blast wave after all. Nukes in space are basically just extremely bright X-ray flash bulbs, unless they go off basically touching the target. And, if that happens.....spacing out internal systems isn't going to matter much at all. You won't be shrugging that one off....."

In space, you only need to keep, at most, 1 atmosphere of pressure IN. 

You need armour, not containment. Having multiple layers of spaced armour would be good, but in space, you can also just completely empty compartments of air as needed. No need to contain anything at all, really. Smaller compartments, with smaller passages between them, are also easier to seal."

Have you ever seen Das Boot? The cramped interior of the submarine helps set a very definite atmosphere. It forces you to understand that the environment that you're looking at is hostile, and will kill you given any chance at all. I'd LOVE to see something like The Expanse embrace that, and put it in the faces of the general audience."
interestingasfuck,fen691h,t1_fen5tfn,1579277889.0,"""Fewer kill points""?

Not how that works. Not at all. Same number of vital systems, but a larger target to hit with weapons, which corresponds to reduced armour covering those systems and a weaker structure supporting them. You don't gain anything by being a bigger target, ESPECIALLY considering that a missile hit, with possibly a nuclear warhead, is about the worst thing that can happen to you.

A clean miss will ALWAYS be better than ANY hit, whether it hits a vital system or not. You don't gain anything by spreading things out. Best you can do is put your vital systems (and things like the bridge), as close to the middle of the ship as you can, with as much armour surrounding them as possible."
interestingasfuck,fen5esd,t1_fen48sw,1579277360.0,"There's a hell of a lot more than that. Much, much more.

1- Despite making a big deal of acceleration forces being a problem, the actual acceleration couches aren't all facing the same direction, namely, aligned with the axis of thrust. So, on a burn, some folks would be fine, while most others would be mashed out the sides of the couches that were supposed to protect them. This is common across all ships.

2- Related to above, but the bridge of the Martian naval ship has the captain walking around. Upright. AFTER general quarters has been sounded. That means that violent accelerations would be expected with effectively zero warning. She should be strapped down any time she's on the bridge. Same goes for the rest of the command crew. No monitors at eye level for someone standing upright.

3- Empty space in ships makes weak points, and is wasteful all across the board. Empty space just means you need more armour for no practical reason. Even if space is cheap aboard ships, which it wouldn't be, there is literally no reason to have 15 foot wide corridors with 12 foot vaulted ceilings. Especially not on a combat ship that is expected to take battle damage and survive. The inside of a combat spacecraft would look very much like the inside of a modern submarine, not like the inside of a luxury cruise ship.

4- A hypervelocity tungsten slug (from a rail gun, say), wouldn't JUST punch a nice, clean hole through a compartment and only damage what it directly hits. The material of the bulkhead that was penetrated has to go SOMEWHERE, and that somewhere would be into said compartment. At several times the speed of sound. Never mind the fact that that slug would also cause a compression blast inside the compartment that could fairly easily kill anyone inside, depending on the size of the compartment. There is a pretty good argument to be made that a ship at general quarters would have the crew in suits and the internal compartments of the ship at vacuum to prevent exactly that, as well as reducing the risk of fire.

There's more, but that's a start....."

The use of wire guided ATGMs factors very heavily into the ground combat. 3 guys in a jeep with a TOW launcher, moving from pre-selected firing point to firing point, firing at tank columns from a few kilometers away, that kind of thing.
