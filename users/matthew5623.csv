ATV,ffddtjt,t1_ffdd74f,1579818783.0,It had a full rebuild in 2010 and the guy said he hasn’t used it much since. But I would be prepared to do some work. I bargained it down to 2000 so I could afford it.

ATV,fc7b7i5,t1_fc7azpy,1577502414.0,"Nope it doesn’t. I’ll make a post with a pic of it. Should come up under new.

ATV,fc79vm3,t1_fc79ppa,1577501379.0,Well I’m glad it doesn’t have one. How are the ranchers compared to a sports quad. Probably couldn’t jump but can you wheelie? How is the acceleration and donuts?
ATV,fc79989,t1_fc792j6,1577500908.0,Dang that does suck. Mines an 09 it says. But they changed them in 09 I think so it technically an 08. Idk it confusing.
ATV,fc78s14,t1_fc78k5q,1577500543.0,"I got 63 when I first got it, but o think the cold is effecting it. Don’t think I could hit 50 now"

ATV,fc77lqe,t1_fc77h67,1577499673.0,It sounds so cool man. I would have kept it like that but it was down on power and the neighbors would have killed me. When it was idle it in the garage I couldn’t even hear myself yell lol.
ATV,fc76u8e,t1_fc763m4,1577499104.0,I had to get a new exhaust pipe cause mine fell off and a new front brake line cause it melted from the exhaust. It broke so that it shot 4-5 inch flames and the line was right in the middle. Man I think everyone within a mile of us knew when I had my quad running. My friend on the other side of the section said he could hear it idle if the wind was right.
ATV,fc6v7k8,t1_fc6uszx,1577490352.0,Oh that explains it. Sorry man. Do study on ur punctuation tho lol. Have a good day/night.
