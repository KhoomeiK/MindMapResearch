Humans are not the same as other animals which ironically is the whole basis of the argument of ""we're smarter than them so we don't have to kill"". The fact that we're smarter than them also means we can recognize a fellow human as more than a beast, that we can demonstrate empathy for our fellows. Some people chose to extend that empathy to non-human animals and that's great, but it's not the next logical step of our sapience. Not killing a cow for its meat is not some great next step beyond.

Obviously, the comparison is not to say animal cruelty is 1:1 between omnivores and vegetarians because it clearly isn't.

Habs,ff66tzo,t3_erpznk,1579620524.0,"""Le Canadien est l’une des pires formations de la LNH quant au volume de tirs dangereux accordés à l’adversaire, alors que ses cerbères sont souvent sollicités depuis l’enclave et le bas de l’enclave. Depuis ces emplacements, le tireur profite d’un angle de tir optimal pendant que le temps de réaction du gardien y est minimal.

Non seulement les gardiens du Tricolore doivent contrecarrer de nombreuses chances de marquer, mais une vaste proportion de celles-ci se concluent via un tir sur réception. Ces séquences augmentent de façon exponentielle le coefficient de difficulté de l’arrêt à effectuer, alors que le gardien doit effectuer un déplacement latéral explosif pour suivre le mouvement du disque, avant de repérer rapidement une rondelle qui change constamment de trajectoire.

Les adversaires du CH exploitent à leur guise l’enclave, y complétant un nombre hallucinant de passes, ce qui fait foi de la couverture défensive poreuse qui y règne. De même, les joueurs du Tricolore sont couramment utilisés comme écran, alors que les opposants décochent beaucoup de tirs voilés, ce qui complique grandement la tâche du gardien au moment de lire la trajectoire du lancer."""

Those clumps of traits come from populations breeding with each other and so they tend to cluster geographically, which then means they cluster culturally and linguistically. But there are NO hard lines between ""races"" because they are social, rather than scientific concepts. You can't ""test"" for race, definitions of who belongs to what race changes (Check out the history of who is white) and what forensic anthropologists are doing when they examine skeletons from the past is telling you what population the person most likely belonged to, based on a bunch of average metrics. So, Race has no biological validity as a category, but variations in biology stemming from population dynamics absolutely exist, which is why different ethnic groups have different rates of disease, etc. If we didn't have the social notion of race already, science would not be able to find it -- we are all just a product of various populations breeding within and among each other, and all humans can interbreed."
