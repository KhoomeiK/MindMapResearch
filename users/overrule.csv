science,fewnotf,t1_fes6x1k,1579416002.0,"Do you want new drugs to be tested or not? Pharma is a giant machine for taking academic ideas and running massive clinical trials on them to meet FDA regulations.

Like it or not, it's basically impossible to run these trials to FDA specifications without the massive infrastructure of big pharma.

If you look at published reviews of clinical trial quality, big pharma trials are generally very high quality compared to academic or others because they have the funding to pay for the experts to run them.

Do you have an alternative model for bringing new drugs to the market safely?"

Like of course I'd like to make more money. But like at a certain point it's probably enough. Each association is gonna fight for more pay because that's their job.

I personally feel like patients are pretty decent at assessing if they need a certain level of care and they're pretty good realizing when their provider is not competent. 

I definitely agree that more years of schooling and more expertise deserves more compensation. It's just from a system pov we're all scrambling for cost effectiveness and giving midlevels more rights is one way the government is trying to cut costs.

Like you can lose sleep over the devaluation of your degree and turf war or you can try to be more positive. But if you're dealing with idiots, I completely get that. I dunno, there's no easy answer. Personally I'd just try to assume that people are acting in general good faith and give constructive feedback like harm reduction fashion, but that's just me.

Doesn't matter if it's just one more rep or the smallest weight increment, as long as it's more than last time. Your brain will naturally get more efficient but of course it's impossible to separate this effect from muscle growth.

I mean the rest is more of a realization that things are mind over matter. Like you hear stories about mom's lifting trees off their kids because they're pumped so full of adrenaline and so desperate that their brain removes the protective limiters. Like they probably ripped a tendon and or something but they still were physically able to do it. It's mostly anecdotal but it's theoretically possible. The technical term is hysterical strength. 

So basically get hype and confident. Play some epic music, visualize yourself performing the exercise and succeeding. 

As Ronnie Coleman once said while dumb incline benching the 150 in each hand: ""light weight, light weight.""

Just be patient and don't try to lift too much too fast with bad form. An injury will set you back so much longer than the time you ""lose"" by taking your time. Just continual small improvements are the main thing."

science,fd015p1,t1_fczwfk2,1578112083.0,"Well, a lot of the hard work isn't design of the new cell but the actual process of creating a factory that can efficiently produce a new type of cell. For example, conveyor belt or other automated processes would need to be retooled and reprogrammed due to the different size of the cell. This would also require validation of the automation process (e.g. Estimating the failure rate, designing contingencies etc).

Also, the supply chain and timing of the of the new manufacturing process is different from the old one. It's kinda similar to the logistic problem hot dog weiner and buns coming in different packaging sizes but multiplied several thousand times."

nutrition,fcamvty,t1_fcagt8k,1577572408.0,"You can access both of those papers by pasting the doi into sci-hub.tw

I'm basing my opinion on a huge body of evidence that shows statins to be  beneficial as well as dozens of guidelines. Here's a registry of landmark lipid trials: https://www.rxfiles.ca/RxFiles/uploads/documents/cht-trialsummaries-webpage.htm#lipid

Here's a summary of these landmark trials linked to my Google drive https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UJj4kX2y2XUMgIZq1aVyhzQiLh_fAnLB/view?usp=drivesdk

The most of the randomized trials use placebo design. Some of the active comparators are for high intensity vs low intensity statin. 

Your example with poison ivy misses the point. If you showed that if people who were tolerant of poison ivy were having less heart attacks and stokes, I would be fine with poison ivy as an intervention. The later trials will use run ins because they want to avoid patients dropping out from statin intolerance and affecting the modified intention to treat analysis. 

I'm a bit unsure why you're against using older trials. I know there is some issue with publication bias in past decades, but you're highly unlikely to get a newer  good quality rct of statins given that they are now standard of care. I'm not really sure what your overall position is either: are you saying that statins are not beneficial at in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality?"
nutrition,fcafdsm,t1_fcaca3u,1577568290.0,"Well, let's just go by Cochrane. You can also try libgen or sci hub for full text access. 

https://www.cochrane.org/CD004816/VASC_statins-primary-prevention-cardiovascular-disease

Or this 92k patient meta analysis from 2019: https://ipccs.org/2019/02/19/efficacy-of-statins-in-primary-cvd-prevention-confirmed-in-large-meta-analysis-but-individual-benefit-harm-profiles-vary/

I'm fine with an active run in as that's consistent with clinical practice. It might skew the results by excluding statin intolerant or reducing the effect size due to real world non compliance. Given the huge number of patients enrolled in the major trials.

Again, I'm not sure if it's useful to debate whether or not statins have an effect. They definitely work for secondary prevention. They likely have some sort of effect in primary prevention, the overall benefit varies on baseline risk. If the individual can tolerate, I would say should just continue."

nutrition,fc9khi9,t1_fbdao8h,1577554003.0,"Ok so I read the abstracts of all those papers. Many of them are a bit out there in terms of actual usage vs clinical practice. If you restrict the population to patients at high risk of cvd, you obtain a more favorable result:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/28249380/

Again, the way I think about it is that statins get you 30% relative reduction in your risk of CVD. Whether this is a significant risk reduction depends on your baseline.

The way I was told to conceptualize this was to imagine relative risk reduction as a % off coupon and absolute risk reduction as the actual $ you are saving. So the 30% off coupon you only really matters if you're buying an expensive television (high cv risk) vs a pack of gum (low cv risk)."
