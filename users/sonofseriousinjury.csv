AdviceAnimals,ff8h6m1,t1_ff89l0z,1579678317.0,"I went to an urgent care because I was experiencing fatigue. They looked at my throat, said my tonsils were swollen, gave me antibiotics, and told me to return in two weeks if it didn't get better. They didn't do any blood work or any other testing. I went back two weeks later because I was getting worse, but the wait time was horrendous. Ended up going to the ER instead. Turns out I had cancer. Could've probably been caught two weeks earlier if they had done any sort of blood work."
cannabis,ff5lis5,t3_erlys6,1579598755.0,"This law has literally changed my life and my quality of life for however long I have left. I was diagnosed with leukemia about six months before the law passed and I cried when I got the approval email. The amount of times smoking has helped with my pain, nausea, appetite, and most importantly intense stomach cramping is more than I could ever count. I could take a 10MG Oxy (or several more), wait 45 minutes and hope I picked the right amount for the pain or I can take a couple of hits and start to feel relief within 5-10 minutes. I've always been pro-legalization, especially MM, but I truly had no idea how beneficial it was until I was locked away in a hospital for months at a time without it. Being able to enjoy this extra time with my wife, family, and friends has given me so many wonderful memories. I thought OK would be far behind when it came to MM. I'm so incredibly grateful to those who helped push it passed all of the jackasses trying to keep medicine away from patients."
Whatcouldgowrong,ff2tqu4,t1_ff2t15n,1579523801.0,"I once over-rotated on a dive and did a back-buster off of a 10 meter high platform. My friend (both of us were on the high school swim team) jumped in the pool while all of the lifeguards stood around dumbfounded. He was trying to help me get to the side of the pool in case I passed out, but I was trying to doggy-paddle to the edge as quickly as possible. Both of us attempting to swim, me in intense pain and him trying to hold me, caused us both to just kind of flop around together. It probably took longer and more effort to reach the side of the pool than if he had left me alone, but I know he was just trying to help. And that was in a pool with no current, rocks, or anything else in the way. I can totally see how others can cause people to drown in a frantic accident. That's more terrifying than drowning by yourself."

It's a great controller with a lot of customization (buttons, sticks, triggers, d-pad, motors) and six programmable buttons. It's definitely more comfortable than a normal PS4 controller. I have some minor neuropathy in my hands due to having cancer, receiving chemotherapy and radiation, and a pinched nerve in my neck.

Starting out as a brand new company and trying to make an MMO to compete with WoW wasn't exactly a smart move. They realized that once they were deep into development and switched it to single player game to try and save it. The game ended up feeling like an empty MMO with decent combat; big surprise.

I'm kind of used to hospitals at this point. They're used to me too and I've got a lot of people who know me there now, haha.

Oof, those surgeries sound rough too! It's all relative, you know? I'm hoping the tumor was benign? Spinal stuff isn't very fun. Because of the type of leukemia I have it has a higher chance of infecting the spinal cord/brain. So, during treatment I had to get nine spinal taps with chemo injection.

I'm in remission now, but still dealing with a lot of GVHD. I go to the hospital complex at least twice a week, but sometimes four or five times. It's definitely better than having cancer or being dead though! :D"

What sucked the most was that I was able to get online, download new games, stream whatever I wanted, but I wasn't able to connect to any multiplayer. Since the WiFi is open it makes sense, but a closed network specifically for long-term patients that would allow more flexibility/connectivity would have been so much better.

That's awesome what you were trying to do! I imagine it's a harder problem to solve for smaller hospitals. I was at one of the largest in the state. They're actually building an entirely new tower specifically for cancer patients/study that's set to open this year."

Time is the one gift that's so incredibly hard to give anybody and you were able to do that for another human. I was married for three months before I was diagnosed and being able to have this extra time with my wife, friends, and family has meant more than I could ever express. I'm sure he felt the same.

I actually donated bone marrow anonymously about five years before I was diagnosed (it's now been nearly seven years and she and I still talk regularly). She's sent me all kinds of baked goods, homemade preserves, birthday presents, and even a clever wedding gift that had to have taken a decent amount of time and effort. It always felt like it was too much attention until I was diagnosed. I wanted to give my donor the opportunity to release their information to me, but they haven't yet. For me, they asked if I wanted to give her my info after it'd been a year and then she contacted me after a couple of months. I haven't heard anything from or about my donor. I don't really know what to say to them, but I need to reach out soon.

When I was a teen I watched a very close friend die from leukemia within a 10 month timeframe. It all happens so fast. I saw a post on Reddit about eight years ago and signed up to be a donor. So now I usually plug [DKMS](https://www.dkms.org) whenever I can just in case somebody sees it.

Imagine the men who only wear college football t-shirts and collect that type of memorabilia. Imagine the person who collects arcade cabinets in their video game store and makes them free to play. Imagine the guy who wants to go live in dirty conditions on the weekend and spends thousands of dollars on equipment to do so. Imagine the person who spends thousands on their car to make it suped up since all you really need is a basic way to and from work.

We all find joy in hobbies. Why shame somebody for liking something different than you?"

I had a very close friend pass from leukemia when we were in our mid-teens. I donated bone marrow nearly seven years ago through [DKMS](https://www.dkms.org/) to an anonymous donee. We now talk and check-in on each other every few weeks. Then I was diagnosed with leulemia nearly two years ago. Cancer is fucking rough and having any sort of family or friends around absolutely help.

Sending good vibes your way. I wish I could express to my wife how much I appreciate everything she's done for me, but she'll never really know. I imagine your wife felt the same. 🧡"

DC_Cinematic,fcjl18d,t1_fbyrcoo,1577691961.0,"So, I was on DC Universe (the Roku TV app) the other day and I was a little surprised by one of the show's dates. Every show that is not still continuing has a start and end date done by year ex. ""The Batman (2004 - 2008)"" and others are like this ex. ""Titans (2018 - )"". ""The New Batman Adventures"" has a date of ""(1998 - )"". Seems odd to me.

Also, they're continuing the animated Batman line of figures by releasing characters that never appeared on the show. They're under the name ""Batman: The Adventures Continue"" and they are releasing Deathstroke, The Joker, Harley Quinn, Super Armor Batman, Batman, Robin, Red Hood, and Azrael so far.

Not that either of these things mean anything, but it does give me a little bit of hope for a continuation of the DCAU."
DC_Cinematic,fcjjidq,t1_fchwe73,1577690063.0,"He doesn't kill anybody after he rescues Martha. He shoots KGBeast's gas tank and KGBeast turns around and lights it on fire. Just like with the grenade in the scene prior. He knocks it out of the guy's hand and the dude jumps to try and grab it instead of scrambling away. Batman definitely kills some people (like dragging that car around and blowing up the vehicles outside of the warehouse), but he's not thinking straight and being pushed over the edge is an integral plot of the film.

When Superman dies Bruce says, ""Men are still good. We fight, we kill, we betray one another, but we can rebuild we can do better. We will. We have to."" This is his turning point. He watched somebody whom he loathed and who he never even considered a person sacrifice himself for humanity."
DC_Cinematic,fcjizd3,t1_fchl2ki,1577689432.0,"He hasn't killed before BvS. Alfred has the whole speech about how he's changing. He branded those human traffickers. There's a newspaper (theatrical cut) and a news host on TV (director's cut) in the backgrounds that asks if Batman should be held responsible for the murders of the criminals he has branded (turns out it was Lex). If Batman has killed before then why would that matter? They should just be going after a murderer and Gordon wouldn't be working with him.

The first time we see him kill is after he talks to Alfred about having to do anything to stop Superman if there's any chance he could harm humanity. ""If there is a one percent chance he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty."" That's after the Knightmare scene and after Flash tells him he was right about Superman. Flash came back too early (as he says in BvS) and Bruce doesn't quite understand the context, but after those two things happened back to back it convinced him that he has to stop Superman by any means necessary."

WTF,fc7e2ma,t1_fc7cn4f,1577504684.0,"A friend of mine managed hog/pig farms for years. He'd go around giving vaccines, herding them, and making sure their living conditions were up to code (sufficient heating/shelter, enough room to move around, proper diet, etc.). He took care of four or five farms and visited each at least two times a week, I believe. He would get extremely pissed off if a farmer delayed vaccinations or anything like that, but it very rarely happened. Most farmers want happy and healthy livestock because that equals more money. Every head lost is money out of their pockets and following the regulations usually saves/earns more money in the long run (especially so if they were to get fined or shut down).

**EFIT**: Not sure why this comment is controversial since nobody has responded... I guess some vegans/vegetarians hate to hear that most farms aren't hellholes that they can be angry about?"
