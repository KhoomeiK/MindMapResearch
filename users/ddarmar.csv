Psychosis,ff9fcez,t3_es65zs,1579711809.0,"I understand your situation is really hard, but please for your own sake try and kick out the illegal drugs. All the drugs you mentioned are hallucionogenics. Hallucionegincs are quite dangerous if you have a history of psychosis. I higly doubt it will help you in long term, it can take the stress off but there are healtier ways to do that. The drugs could kick you back into psychosis or strenghten them.

Take care <3"

Psychosis,fema029,t1_fel0dlt,1579245372.0,"I have never experienced psychosis, but I see a pattern where everyone becomes extremly depressed after the psychotic break. Do you know why is that and can you explain to me please.
I don't want to be an asshole and I could probably google it but I'd like a personal opinion/experience if you're ok with that"

depression,fdbxdkg,t3_ekj9jz,1578263426.0,How do you define a mental breakdown?
depression,fdbx2p4,t3_ekcqrj,1578263259.0,"I did. Not saying everyone can or will, but it definitly doable. Working on yourself, getting therapy, the right meds if you need them and fixing your life is doable. Hard as shit and takes a lot of boldness but worth it. Don't give up, this month could be better than the last one or the next one could be better than this one... little progress is still progress and eventualy it's a big progress. Of course there's ups and downs but it is what it is."

Psychosis,fcwwjfp,t3_ejb2zr,1578040627.0,"Not a doctor but could be a sign of mania, make sure you talk to your doctor."
depression,fc543mw,t3_eg6v1y,1577442126.0,"Hey, my mom tried to kill herself atleast 50 times, i ""saved"" her some of those times. Dad beat the shit out of her, she played the victim role but was a abuser also. They'll make you believe its not that bad but it is.
I'm 22 now, i got out of my hometown, i still suffer   and scars still remain the same but with every month or two it's getting better. 
Get therapy, medication if you need it and try and plan getting the fuck out of your family. Also never feel guilty for taking care of yourself, you're the only one that can and will do it."
Showerthoughts,fbtx4dr,t3_eeeccm,1577100524.0,"Not a chronic illness but have been sick for a year and a half. Doctors coudn't diagnose me for a long time and after all concluded it's in my head, a psychosomatic condition. I was sure it wasn't but nobody trusted me, friends abandoned me, family told me i need to chill and i'll be fine. Long story short i invested all my money into finding what's wrong and was diagnosed 2 weeks ago. 
Now i've got a diagnosis and far less shitty friends and family members, maybe that's not a bad thing."
