My view is that it is important it's acknowledged as an issue so I'm NOT minimising men's experiences when I say this... but a lot fewer women care about height than men think. 

I think it's more perpetuated by toxic masculinity where taller men see it as an opportunity to feel superior in some way (especially the insecure ones). 

I like that this expressed all those issues so coherently.

I do know that men are rejected by women based on height but (as a 6' woman happy to date anyone 5'6"" plus*) I know a lot of men just don't even try with taller women and just assume their height will be an issue when that's not the case. I'd love to see shorter guy/taller women relationships normalised in the media too.
