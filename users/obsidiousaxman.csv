BatmanArkham,ff4xznp,t1_ff4bmwk,1579575153.0,One of the first things I do in predator mode is overload their medpacks so they knock themselves out when they try to revive someone. Screw those guys.
arrow,ff206iz,t1_ff1vvz7,1579490312.0,"All of which was due to the showrunners obsession with being validated by a bunch of internet nerds on tumblr, as opposed to being validated by a bunch of internet nerds on reddit."
DCcomics,fenitao,t1_felzjl1,1579285609.0,"I think part of the reason I liked Doomsday Clock as much as I did because it wasn't fucking around with the world built in Watchmen, and kind of made sense for Dr Manhattan to do something like that in an attempt to understand humanity."
motorcycles,fen2aq3,t1_femxbpj,1579275385.0,Those tires were the first on my list of upgrades and they do help a ton. Now I'm currently looking for a solid set of rear shocks and front rebuild kits.
DCcomics,femummm,t1_femp128,1579270045.0,"There was some question about whether itd be on DCUniverse or HBOMAX. But how can you not love Robot Brendan Fraiser screaming ""what the fuck"" for a whole season?"
DCcomics,femuhoi,t1_fem9upo,1579269940.0,"It sure was, but NBC was a horrible platform for it"
Watchmen,fel7o2n,t1_fel7fwm,1579215830.0,What a fucking CRAZY series. Both comics and TV are great. Can't wait for season 2.
arrow,feerrae,t1_fedoqem,1579039811.0,The entire first run was so bad he had to do a soft reboot at like issue 17. Ann Nocenti does not belong in writing. Neither does Andrew Kreisberg.
AskReddit,feeqh3c,t1_fedpckh,1579039050.0,"This reminds me of when I was younger, my sister and I went to CCD (like night class for religious shit, for those unaware) which was like an hour and a half once a week. My dad decided to volunteer there to help with stuff and they made him and the other dads go through a background check and a seminar on how not to diddle kids. I just find it ironic the Catholic Church was telling my dad not to diddle kids."
AskReddit,feegl3b,t1_fedk3sc,1579033326.0,"I went to college in philly, and the only place I did my grocery shopping was the Wegmans in KOP which was almost a half hour away. Wegmans makes me not hate food shopping."
DCcomics,feed8mu,t1_fee4a6w,1579031358.0,"I just know realized I'm that type of asshole who talks about how cool something looks without linking that thing, but that is 100% it. Even if you're a casual fan of art check out his website alexrossart.com because everything he puts out is phenomenal, like the follow up to his famous Joker and Harley pic http://www.alexrossart.com/assets/images/gallery/large/Batman-Mind_If_I_Cut_In.jpg"
DCcomics,fedt5i7,t3_eolddq,1579019343.0,Alex Ross is a goddamn treasure. He colored an image of the Justice League that Bruce Timm pencilled and it's just as amazing as this is.
AskReddit,fdqnf6l,t3_emqd57,1578670775.0,"For flannel and button down shirts: Dixxon Flannels. Some goddamn quality shirts that I wear frequently, they always look and feel great.

For pretty much any other clothing: Duluth Trading Co. I am a slut for their stuff. Most of the stuff holds up pretty well in an industrial environment. So far the only reason I've needed to replace a pair is because I low sided my motorcycle and theres now a quarter sized hole in the knee."
phillies,fdlhhez,t1_fdlft52,1578524119.0,Exactly. I'll pick up a Reebok flyers jersey if I see one and like it.
phillies,fdlf3e1,t3_elz5pe,1578522656.0,"Got a red Harper and Schmidt for myself and my dad for christmas, gotta say the deal on the majestics are awesome."
movies,fdeyyfq,t1_fddp7c9,1578349585.0,"I'm pretty sure they were close to making it at Granite run, but the filming schedule didnt work out with the demo date. I feel like they should've accommodated the film, cause they rushed to put up a heaping pile of shit that looks fucking stupid. At least having a film there would've boosted the economy for a little bit."
movies,fdeyfpz,t1_fdeq0zt,1578349260.0,"Honestly, I'm glad Kevin Smith didnt do anything on Arrow. That show fucked the character of Oliver Queen so hard, whatever Kevin did would've had to fit in that frame, which couldnt have ended great."
movies,fdey50j,t1_fdeqpbf,1578349078.0,"I havent seen the Reboot yet,  but his entire social media presence leading up to it was ""I'm pretty much gonna make a movie that touches on all my early movies and gets that nostalgia train rolling"". And you know what, I'm excited to get it on dvd and watch it"
batman,fco8cw9,t1_fcmdvnn,1577826031.0,I love the One:12 series. I only have the blue edition of the Ascending Knight figure but I'm always on the look out for more.
todayilearned,fccdx2l,t1_fccazdm,1577597290.0,I think a Constantine show with Matt Ryan on DCs streaming service or netflix would be perfect. As much as I liked the show theres a lot of hard R rated material that could be dealt with better than just completely omitting it.
todayilearned,fcb1ug2,t1_fcaz3o6,1577581086.0,"Which sucked because I'm a huge Hellbalzer fan, and the guy they got to play Constantine did a great job."
todayilearned,fcargql,t1_fcanc23,1577575170.0,NBC really pissed me off with Constantine because they put it at a 10pm friday slot. Really how do you reasonably expect a show to do well at that time
motorcycles,fc6vptf,t1_fc6ut6e,1577490719.0,I got the bobber comfort seat from Indian and it helped me get over the hard ass seat. I'm looking for a good set of rear shocks to make the ride more comfortable. It's a great bike dont get me wrong but I do get the argument against spending over a grand to get a bike to be a comfy ride.
DCcomics,fc1nix5,t1_fc1act8,1577324093.0,I have yet to read Undiscovered Country yet but Snyder is added to the list of writers where I'll pick up at least a few issues of whatever title hes on.
DCcomics,falvknf,t1_falfga2,1576191206.0,At this point it feels like Doomsday Clock is never ending.  I really hope the payoff is worth the delays.
