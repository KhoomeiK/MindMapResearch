depression,fdqwpkq,t3_emt3a5,1578675958.0,"All valid and all racing thoughts. We oftentimes focus on these things so much that we begin believing each and every one of them. It's so easy to feel this way and feel like we've found ourselves in a constant rut. I feel that you're not as big of a failure as you think (we all fail sometimes), you aren't ""retarded"", everyone may let someone down time times, many people expect way too much from others, there's nothing wrong with being a little weird, sometimes we all have ""brain-fart"" moments, mistakes are the way that we learn and grow, I can promise you aren't a burden, you're only a disappointment by the unrealistic standards that are set in this world, I truly don't believe that anyone is an ""idiot"" (everyone just processes things differently), and existing is something that you should never ever be sorry for. I'm sorry that you're going through a difficult time. Sometimes it feels like we're going through a difficult life. It'll all be okay."
depression,fdqvqhc,t3_emt6vn,1578675587.0,"It'll probably happen for you at some point. There's really no set time. A lot people just rush into sexual things without even really thinking about it. A lot of people see it as ""just getting it over-with"". My advice would be not to rush into anything just for the sake of doing something. If you feel that you would like to have an emotional connection with someone, then seek that. Honestly, in my opinion, a good emotional connection with someone is greater than a sexual connection could ever be."
depression,fdqv6sw,t3_emtfop,1578675319.0,"It's easy to get into that mindset sometimes. But for the most part things are usually experienced in a cycle of better and worse. The worse days are when we must work the hardest even though sometimes we feel that we'd rather do nothing. And feeling trapped is something normal to experience in your situation. Sometimes there just doesn't feel like there's a way out. Keep focused, hold your head as high as you can, and I'm sure you'll come out the other side."
marfans,fdqtn56,t3_eik6nh,1578674628.0,I'm like 6'5 and 150lbs (68kg) so I kinda know a thing or two about not being able to gain any weight. I've even gone as far as trying protein powders and some other things which also never worked. Seems to be no luck with weight gain so I've just accepted it.

relationships,fdo54dv,t3_eme0bx,1578599060.0,"The fact that you two were friends before getting together is a huge bonus. The feelings and trust of a friendship can definitely carry over to a relationship.

Our own mind can sometimes be our worst enemy. We oftentimes will think about the absolute worst case scenario and focus on it so much that we then believe it's true. This is especially true sometimes in relationships. It's more common than you think that partners will sometimes expect the worst when they don't hear from their significant other for an extended period of time. I know you feel bad, but it's fairly common.

In your case, you're very lucky to have such an understanding partner. When going through anything, this always makes things so much easier. You are right, a person will only deal with so much. But the fact that you've talked to your partner lets her know that you're serious about trying to fix the whole thing. I'm sure she knows that it's your own personal struggle but I'm sure she will also help you along the way.

You're very wise to get on a waiting list to speak to a councillor. This can be a great tool. Having someone to talk to, even sometimes just hearing yourself say things out loud, can be a major help for working through things.

I can't say for sure if everything will be okay, but I have a feeling that things will work out."
AskReddit,fdo3tbs,t3_embbja,1578598382.0,I'm taking new medication. Does that count?
depression,fdo3ppd,t3_emchv2,1578598328.0,"Everything feels like a chore. That really hits home since it's so truthful. A person only has so much energy to get through the day. A person with anxiety, depression, or both that have all their daily energy used before they even get out of bed. 

It is wonderful that you don't feel suicidal. I'm glad to hear that you have value of your life. Sometimes we go through phases in our lives where things may get better or worse. Focus on the things in your life that you enjoy doing. Like spending time with your cat and your wife. I know things may not enthuse you at the moment, but there is always the possibility that may change.

Try to keep your head held as high as you can. Focus getting through each day. It seems like you at least have one person in your life that loves you (your wife). That is truly a blessing.

We all want something to look forward to. Some people look forward to something big like a vacation, and another people look forward to something simple like having pizza. I feel that things will change for the better for you. The day may never come that you feel 100% okay, but the day may come where you can feel joy and look forward to the things in your life."
depression,fdo2qrh,t3_emcnwi,1578597818.0,"Anxiety, no mater what type, can be extremely difficult. Sometimes we go through phases where our anxiety will get a little better for awhile. Then, out of nowhere it gets worse than before. It is a constant cycle. I understand how hard it can be. It can make you hate yourself and question everything. 

I'm not quite sure how your friends making jokes to trigger your anxiety will make it go away but I suppose crazier things have happened. I would figure that they should be trying to avoid things that they know will trigger you rather than joking about it.

It makes perfect sense to get down sometimes. There are time we wake up and would rather not even get out of bed. Those are the days we must try the hardest. Sometimes we may fail, but the fact that we still try is what's important. Rather than take things day-by-day, take them one situation at a time. Focus getting through the situation that you're in and then move onto the next. 

Do what you feel you're able to do. It's okay to push yourself a little. Just don't push it too far too quickly. Take care."
depression,fdo1ll2,t3_emd6n1,1578597211.0,"I hear ya when you say that you're not fond of changes and are indecisive. I 100% relate. It truly seems that we have a bit of a similar story.

Firstly, I really don't believe that being shy or having good grades is any reason to put someone down. But people these days will look for any reason they can I guess. I know it was probably hard to see at the time, but neither of those things should've been anything that you were made to feel bad for. 

The constant questioning is something I'm also very familiar with. It's always so easy to wonder ""what if, what if"". But if that all everyone ever thought, no one would ever do anything. Even though the ""what if"" can help us be prepared, it can sometimes also limit us in many ways that it shouldn't. But having anxieties for anything in life can make perfect sense. And honestly, college isn't for everyone. I finished high school with no idea what I really wanted to do with my life. So, I went to college with all of the ""what ifs"" in my mind. Like you, I hated it. I felt completely unprepared, failed a course, didn't do great in the others, suffered mentally, had no friends, and nearly lost my mind. I didn't go back to college after my experience. I couldn't. And I felt horrible for it. I felt like I was giving up. But I see things differently now. When we finish school and try to start our lives, many people have no idea what they want to do in life. Because really, how can we know if we'll like something if we've never done it. Right? But that's why there's no shame in looking elsewhere. I have tried multiple things in my life. Travelled, worked different jobs, tried different courses and schools. It all works out in the end. And I'm sure it will for you too. The road to get there seems so long and horrible, and most days it is, but the end result is usually worth it.

And honestly, a lot of people in college are in the same boat as you. Even those who look like they have it all figured out and seem like they're having fun could be completely suffering on the inside. Sometimes, those who seem the most well-built are actually the most broken."
depression,fdo056e,t3_emdn4m,1578596384.0,"I think I understand what you mean. Sometimes it's almost like there's a ball of fire building up inside. To anyone who doesn't experience this, it is almost impossible to explain. As far as dealing with it goes, after more than a couple of decades on this Earth, I still haven't fully figured out how. It seems like it's a constant fight sometimes. I find that it sometimes has a lot to do with what maybe going on around me, even if I don't realize it."
depression,fdnzovr,t3_emc5hh,1578596121.0,"Like a couple of other people said, drinking while on antidepressants can have a lot of odd effects on your body. Most of the time this will including an increase in depression and anxiety (if present). Also, it has been said that the effects of intoxication will come on much sooner. I'm speaking from the experience of bad decisions."

depression,fdnduym,t3_emav3m,1578583696.0,Eventually sometimes everyone feels nothing. It all depends on what we‚Äôre going through at the time. Sometimes the normal everyday routine gets old and boring.
depression,fdndd2v,t3_emabok,1578583387.0,Yeah I understand where your coming from. Some people will simply just use others for emotional support. Eventually they just tend to get bored
depression,fdn3wr0,t3_em7m8b,1578576548.0,"Depending on who you are as a person, it may help. The issue I‚Äôve always found with therapy is that a lot of their information is coming from a textbook. It‚Äôs rare to find someone who hasn‚Äôt lived with depression that understands. Just give it a try I guess, whatever accepting yourself means. I‚Äôm assuming maybe it means trying to accept yourself as a person for who you are. I‚Äôm not really sure. Wish you all the best!"
depression,fdmchqx,t3_elycos,1578545540.0,"I think it‚Äôs always sorta been something I‚Äôve lived with. It has definitely set me back a couple of years when things got really bad. But I just really wasn‚Äôt very good at dealing with anything at that point. I feel like the key to not letting depression set you back is trying to find what works for you the best to manage it. I know there‚Äôs no perfect fix or anything. There‚Äôre many days I‚Äôd rather just lay in bed and forget the world exists. But whether we have 10, 20, 30 years or more on this Earth, it‚Äôs just as well to make the best of it."
MeetPeople,fdmbn4y,t3_eiwrbz,1578544838.0,"Well, I think you sound like a very interesting person. You have a very nice way of writing. I wouldn‚Äôt say that you‚Äôre superficial at all; you know exactly what you want. That‚Äôs a nice thing to see in this world. People oftentimes are so indecisive so it‚Äôs wonderful to see someone who knows exactly what she wants. We all have our issues even if we pretend they don‚Äôt exist sometimes. And as far as being clingy goes, some people really like that. I‚Äôve always found it cute to a certain point. You sound like a gemüòä"
