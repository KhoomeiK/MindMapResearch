AfterTheLoop,ff90k6h,t3_epape7,1579701766.0,"An impressionable young man, Luke, is manipulated into joining a militant group of dissidents by a desert dwelling religious zealot.  Luke teams up with a smuggler to blow up a military installation as revenge for the murder of Luke's aunt and uncle at the hands of the legally elected government.

Part 2

In an attempt to bring the terrorists to justice, heroic government cyborg Darth Vader searches across the galaxy for Luke and his vile band of murderers.  Eventually, he finds and enhancedly interrogates Han Solo, the very same smuggler who helped Luke to murder hundreds of thousands in the previous film. 

At the same time, Luke was learning magical ways to murder people with his mind from another religious zealot named Yoda.  Yoda was also wanted by the government for high treason.  Oddly, Yoda isn't impressed by Luke's sinister accolades and is reluctant to teach him how to cause more mayhem and destruction around the stars.

Halfway through the seminar, Luke catches wind that Han has been lawfully detained and sets off to murder the troops who did this. Luke confronts Vader to find that Vader had mercifully and wisely put Han to sleep and returned him to a businessman that Han had swindled in order  to go and murder people.  Vader anduke fight, and Luke loses.  Instead of killing Luke, Vader informs him that Vader is in fact his father. Luke was kidnapped by religious zealots and brain washed into fighting their war.  Furthermore, Vader offers his son a very nice government job. 

Luke vehemently declines the offer and jumps to his death. He miraculously survives by using his magic to telepathically contact some babe he had the hots for and kind of made out with earlier. 


Part 3

Luke goes back to his home planet to spring Han out of the clink.  He does this by murdering a business man and a ton of strippers, and also feeding some people to a giant monster.

Next, he returns to Yoda's planet to grill the little bastard on all the secrets.  Yoda tells Luke that not only is Vader his father, but the chick Luke has the hots for is his sister.  Luke doesn't seem all that shocked by the revelation. Yoda all commands Luke to kill his father. Yoda dies for some reason and Luke runs off to join his friends to blow up another military installation.

Later, Luke's sister Leia becomes queen of living teddy bears.  She convinces them to launch an unprovoked attack on the military while Luke tries to convince his father to fuck the police and come ride dirty with him and Han.

Vader is dubious and has Luke talk to Vader's boss.  Vader's boss tells Vader he's fired and tried to hire Luke. Luke again declines the offer and chops his Dad's hand off in a fit of rage. Then Vader's boss gives Luke the mother of all static shocks, causing Vader to think that maybe supporting the troops ain't all its cracked up to be.  Vader kills his boss, but the static shock blows up his cyborg parts and Vader dies.

Luke goes on to try and murder his nephew and spends the rest of his life drinking milk straight from an alien teet.

The end."

The door swung open.  Colonel McLeod strutted out like a man used to kicking ass and taking names. He looked down at me through his space-o-visor with the penisiesty look I'd ever seen.

""Because, *sir*"" , I sneered.  ""Ghosts are already dead, dipshit.  Conventional fire arms are ineffective. Take one of the proton accelerators to immobilize and an electro-magnetic trap for containment."" I threw a thumb to the closet behind us. Colonel McLeod shifted his gaze between the closet and the space-o-pistol.

japanlife,fc0pcud,t3_efcuu5,1577296468.0,"We sold the meaning of Christmas long ago.  Almost all of Christianity has a dollar sign on it.  Compare Christian holidays with those of other major religions. Other than Hannukah, there aren't a lot (or any) commercial element associated with Jewish or Muslim holidays. Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah, Ramadan, etc all retain their spiritual impact. 

Christmas, Easter, Valentine's, St. Pat's, All Hallow's Eve all took on a distinctly secular identity.  That genie is out of the bottle.  And Christmas got it worst of all.  The birth of Christ is now represented by Santa, the Grinch, Rudolph, Frosty the Snowman, Coca Cola polar bears, and who knows what else. 

That's not to say they've lost all their meaning, but it's no surprise that other cultures co-opted Christmas.  I have friends and family who certainly keep the true, religious significance of it, though.

I guess it means something different to everyone."
