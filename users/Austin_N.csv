RWBYcritics,ffa9d08,t3_esiu4v,1579730425.0,"Yang: Her introduction had her picking a fight with a crime lord for no reason, which leaves a bad first impression for some people. Her getting so mad at Ozpin for giving Raven and Qrow the ability to turn into birds was so nonsensical that it tainted her character, and her giving him no sympathy for his tragic backstory was also offputting to people.

Blake: Because her character was often bland in the first few seasons and her running away after learning to not run away soured her perception among some fans. It's also hard to relate to her motivations when the racism plotline was so badly handled.

Both: Yang and Blake had a few significant interactions in the first three seasons, but they didn't really speak to each other *that* much. Because of that, them spending most of their time together post season-5 leads to lot of accusations of pandering to fans. For whatever reason, a lot of Bumblebee fans are more aggressive about their ship than fans of other pairings which probably causes people to criticize it even more out of spite.

Adam: Because he's one of the most inconsistently written characters in the series and all the confusion surrounding what in the hell he was supposed to be leads to arguments. He's also emblematic of how botched the Faunus plotline was and how most of RWBY's villains have no nuance."

Wrong. Most of Jaune's character relates to his insecurity and him trying to be a better fighter. He has never existed exclusively for romantic arc.
