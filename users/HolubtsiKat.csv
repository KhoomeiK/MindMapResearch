facepalm,fev77lk,t1_feug017,1579393945.0,"I am sorry. I mistook you for someone else I was commenting to. 

I realized this after. 

I done fucked up."
facepalm,fev6yh3,t1_feuxgca,1579393827.0,"I don't know much else beyond to definitions of sex and gender. Probably best to consult several peer reviewed articles on that shit.

I feel that a percentage of transgendered cases may still be considered body dysmorphia. Some are due to other mental illnesses. Others are apparently linked to brain chemistry.

Schizophrenia does not exactly work the way media portrays it. A great deal of it is the changes in the mind and how their perceive the world.
This is an illness that can negatively affect someone's life. So treatment is usually necessary.

You live in the usa I take it? I am sorry to say, but your politics are no longer what anyone would consider the norm.

Anyone under the age of 21 shouldn't make such a drastic change to their lives. This is just my opinion though. We are not able to clearly reason until our frontal lobe is fully developed."
facepalm,feueeb4,t1_feu6jfi,1579385728.0,"If we want to know if they are true we can replicate the experiment. There are extensive documents detailing the experiments, and every step taken/variable considered. 

If you research the specific claims history of replications you can gain a better understanding of how accurate that claim may be."
facepalm,feu63j3,t1_feu505w,1579383444.0,"Gender and sex are two different things. One is biological, while the other is socially influenced.

I agree that blindly following anything is pointless. The problem with the world is people don't know how to critically think, and a large portion of people rather be told what reality is than have to do the work for themselves.

As a tip, any thing called an ""exciting new study"" means that it was never replicated or properly tested. 

Media is the problem. These new exciting studies draw more eyes than articles about failed studies or inconsistencies."
facepalm,feu1oit,t1_feu0qij,1579382212.0,"Dude... Science is based on empirical evidence.

A claim is made. This claim is then repeatedly tested by several independent investigators to check for replicability, amongst other things.

You yourself can test a claim. It then would be you who observes and records the data.

You can't test religion."
facepalm,feu0x1k,t1_fetqfdv,1579382051.0,"If you wanted and had the ability to do so, you could perform tests to see if the experiments are replicable.

Religion can not be tested. Therefore religion and science exist separately from one another as a means to understand the world."
facepalm,feu00t5,t1_fetsi5q,1579381767.0,That is not how science works.

A real smile often reaches the eyes."

bestof,fehlft3,t1_fehl1al,1579118932.0,"Having a strong support system through my family is what got me away from a similar situation.

Without them I would still be on the streets.

Support systems like your friend is what makes a difference in these situations."

gaming,fea3bmf,t1_fe9urxg,1578943913.0,"I am a women one year away from 30, and still enjoy playing games. We own every possible console.

In my experience, women tend to receive more pressure from their female peers over video games being seen as childish, than men do. 

Probably has something to do with gendered socialization. 

Which results in less women having gaming as a hobby."

gaming,fe9za4r,t1_fe9kvbm,1578942765.0,"Some people grew up with only a negative impression of gaming. For instance, someone close to them could of had an addiction to gaming. 

To people who haven't experienced gaming in a positive light, it can seem like a drug.

This is at least something I've noticed in relationships where one of the partners really detests gaming as a whole."
standupshots,fe0wl0l,t1_fdztgbk,1578819593.0,This right here. Hear-say is not evidence.

Edmonton,fdm4s2t,t3_em2x5y,1578539784.0,"Thank you for posting this. This information needs to be more widely available.

My family has experienced every one of their tricks over the years.

When my grandfather passed he was to be cremated, but we rented a coffin for the viewing.

This company cremated my grandfather in the rented coffin, informed us about it and expected us to pay. There was a lot of pressure on my mother. 
Luckily she was able to see through their bullshit and refused, but I could see how someone may be coerced while being consumed with grief."
TrueOffMyChest,fdil8fw,t1_fdh9ryn,1578445394.0,"Exactly! My white ancestors were to busy being enslaved and killed off by other white people to have any part in that shit.

rape,fcpo5tq,t1_fcplgzc,1577868523.0,"I think you may be right about the subconscious factor. The risk of saying no was not worth it. Everything led to a fight. 

Now I am left feeling like my worth is dependent on whether or not I can be there for my boyfriend when he needs me in that way.

My partner knows about my past boyfriend. I have told him small bits and pieces over the years. 

I am scared to open up. My ex is not the only guy to have taken advantage of me, and I really don't want my current partner to see me differently.
He doesn't seem very comfortable discussing my past."
