socialanxiety,ff4d0xh,t3_erawyl,1579560724.0,"Also, “am I walking too loud?” “Do I look like I’m walking heel-toe like I’m supposed to? Or do I look like I’m walking like an elephant?” “Can people here me breathing heavily?” “Are people going to notice my boobs bouncing when I walk?” ....oh the joys of social anxiety!"
DoesAnybodyElse,fecrwqb,t3_eoeh12,1578982288.0,Y E S! I can’t stand it! The whole concept of it just seems so odd to me.
Anxiety,fecmpju,t1_fea3qjc,1578977742.0,Hmm I actually didn’t think about that. That very well could be why. Thank you!

selfharm,fe8ze4r,t3_enzc3n,1578932536.0,I have a playlist of songs that remind me of really painful or emotional memories that I’ll listen to
selfharm,fe8u9pb,t3_enuiil,1578930984.0,My best friend did something similar to me. Only she decided to say how she didn’t understand why someone would want to hurt themselves and  said a bunch of other things that made me feel like shit for doing it.
infp,fe4fxzq,t3_eno9ta,1578858874.0,"Oh ya all the time. I get excited to go to bed because I know that means I’m going to get to live in my own little world in my dreams. The emotions I experience are so intense that when I wake up, I’m so mad."
ADHD,fdtz7d6,t3_en33y8,1578724669.0,"This happened to me when I first started taking meds and it still happens to me everytime I boost my prescription up to a higher dose. I get really irritable/angry, sad, and extremely hungry at the end of the day. I believe these are fairly common side affects of the medication. If you’ve been taking it for a couple of weeks, they should wear off pretty soon."
depression,fdtxo21,t1_fdmlm60,1578723916.0,"I totally understand that feeling. I feel the same way a lot of the time, but I’m starting to get better at it. And you’re welcome! I hope that it helped :). Good luck, you can do this! I know it’s hard, really hard, but I know you can do this!"
DoesAnybodyElse,fdsj5c3,t3_emq6l0,1578703755.0,I always tell my dog I love them and that I’ll be back soon when I leave my house for school. I feel weird if I don’t ngl
depression,fdmki6f,t3_em5r0m,1578553305.0,"Honestly, it’s not a bad idea in my opinion. I’ve done something similar before. Take a mental health day and allow yourself to study in a place you feel safe and can focus. Then go back to school tomorrow. I just highly recommend not turning it into a behavioral pattern. You let your anxiety beat you by avoiding school (typical anxiety behavior is avoidance). 

Maybe talk to a school counselor? Or try talking to some of your teachers? If you attend a public school, I believe that most teachers are required to take a class on mental health, so they might be of some help."
depression,fdmk3jf,t3_em4acf,1578552845.0,I feel the same way. I turn 18 in a few months and I’m so scared. How the hell am I gonna function as an adult in this cruel world when I can hardly function now as a teenager living under my parent’s roof? The thought of it just brings my mind to dark places I don’t wanna go.
