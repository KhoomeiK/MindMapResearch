I remember playing with 7 people on Bomberman on the PS3. Not gonna get my hopes up but it would be cool if this means we'll have 8 player support for games like Gang Beasts, Screen Cheat, and Laser League. Let me throw money at you Sony by buying 8 controllers for me and my friends. :D"

It's Lego and even if you don't like the new movies, there will be humor and jokes poking fun at them to make it enjoyable. And you can choose to only play the first 6 or 3 if you want and still get an open world game set in Star Wars with all the awesome characters! :D"
LegoStarWarsVideoGame,fetzm7a,t1_fetax50,1579381622.0,Exactly. I've been waiting for this game since I heard more Star Wars movies were being made back like 6 years ago. I'm so glad it's actually happening.
