todayilearned,ff5b34w,t1_ff59z35,1579585810.0,From what I can tell from the population stabilized in the sense that  it dipped due to hardship and casualties during wartime and then regained back to a linear increase in population rather than a stagnation.
todayilearned,ff585tw,t1_ff57iqb,1579583067.0,"What do you mean? After ww2 the population of the world started increasing drastically. The lack of hardships after the war and more unity in the world meant people were having more kids and an increase in quality of life. (In the long run as there are obviously other factors that negatively affect that.) 

Lack of food decreases population as does hardship, the more a population struggles generally the more they focus on self survival rather than procreation. Atleast that's how I see it."

They also mention they dont know how it would be accomplished just estimating what it would take.

The government funded militaries around the world are also major parts of the global economy (Via employment, research, advancement in technologies, and other stuff.) Taking money away from one thing may help others but could hurt people as well.

If the woman had been at the gas station and overheard the person with money issues and offered gas money outside of her work hours it wouldn't be seen as anything but a nice gesture. 

But since shes at the bank as the employee representing the bank and going potentially against work policies to perform this act that she learned of through means of her employer it presents some legal issues. 

I feel bad for her losing her job but I understand the banks side of things as well in respects to american business culture. She should have called a friend to give 20 bucks to the man and then paid the friend back later making it more of an anonymous donation thing."
facepalm,felg340,t1_fekqcoq,1579221349.0,"I think that's partially true... there is no good substitute for ""hands on"" experience that you can get from reading books and taking tests.

The problem I noticed with ALOT of students when I was going to college was the lack of people who'd actually worked.... period. Never worked in high school and didnt work any sort of job through college. 

Even a basic burger flipping job or coffee shop gives a person some valuable experience beyond the book smarts.

I went to college for engineering with some extremely smart people. When I say smart i mean  that they knew exactly every formula to calculate this or that but no practical experience at all. I managed to get and keep internships over plenty of those people purely because I could atleast apply what i knew or what i had learned to real world situations or think outside the box for solutions where others only have their pond of book knowledge to pull from. 

Education works best with a mix of real world experience and Visa versa in my opinion."
facepalm,felf7sq,t1_fel6dsf,1579220761.0,"You can theoretically work an engineering level job and do the work. You just cant certify the numbers. 

Basically you have a PE that has the education that can review work and stamp it to make it official but the actual person working on the numbers doesn't necessarily have to be a degree holder. Most companies do require you to hold a degree because they want to atleast know you have the basics."
facepalm,feledrq,t1_fel43un,1579220207.0,"For another ""yankee"" perspective, I wasn't able to recieve the ""good"" financial aid (grants and scholarships, which are basically just free money you can apply for), and was told to take out student loans. Most scholarships and Grant's that I could find for my region and college were aimed at the minority of college attendees (basically being something other than male caucasian) and in my opinion are very much under utilized.

I went to a state school as well for mechanical and aerospace engineering 4 year degree. I paid around 6 to 10 thousand USD per year in tuition depending on the amount of courses and level of classes. I took 6.5 years to graduate but came out with more than one 4 year degree at a cost of maybe 60,000 USD. 

I didnt take out loans personally. I actually worked in the summer time at internships and part time or full time jobs that allowed me to pay for all my living expenses and tuition and what not. The experience gained through the internships along with the contacts I gained landed me job offers before I graduated making more in a year than my degrees cost me. 

To answer the loans thing here as best I understand since I didnt take out loans but know people that have:

 My particular friend pulled out 30,000$ loans every year he was in school to pay for school and housing and food and all that. The loans I am aware of, you dont have to start paying back until you are out of school. The interest rate on student  loans as there is no credit score or work history or anything involved is very high (15% or greater). Which with any debt at all is already insane let alone a huge one. Some loans actually increase the interest rates the longer they go without being paid off.

My friend got a job with me loading planes at the airport because he hadnt built up saving and spent a good portion of the extra loan money on vacations and a new vehicle while he was in school. His interest rate was doubling the amount he had to pay monthly in order to combat the interest accrual per year. Basically making minimum payments meant that each year he owed more on the loan than he did at the start of the prior year."
facepalm,felacua,t1_fel8ial,1579217544.0,"Experience plays a large role in wages too. A college degree says you took the classes and know how to take tests. That doesnt give you work ethics, experience, or being able to take instruction.

I've worked since I was in high school, not always hardcore jobs or anything but I've never had issue getting a good starting pay or raises. Without that experience to back me up in an employer's eyes I would have had to wait for the raises longer. 

I'd say a degree earns you the potential to make more over a non degree holding person in some regard but not all.."
GolfGTI,fel8kx7,t1_fekha83,1579216407.0,"I have driven DSGs because my dealership has a waiting list for manuals and they were offering some pretty steep discounts to get the 4 or 5 DSGs off the lot before the end of the year. 

The DSG is a very nice automatic, definitely alot more engaging than most. However I definitely got about 5 minutes in and still immediately wished I'd had a stick and the extra pedal.

I've noticed alot of people get the auto over the MT for usually one of like 4 reasons perusing the forums and posts.

1. Cant/don't want to drive a manual.

2. It's faster.

3. They drive in traffic alot! And the paddles satisfy the occasion drive.

4. It's a more family oriented purchase (aka so the wife can drive it when needed) l.

Or I suppose an encompassing 5th element is that it's their daily and they have a separate manual vehicle that satisfies the itch for the stick.

Either way I intend to get a manual in part because I love a manual, my daily commute is not  stop and go and I do alot of fun driving in between, no family, and will be a primary car. Also the manuals are very much disappearing, so might as well get one while I can because chance are the next car in 5 or 10 years will most likely be   an automatic."

If you have the part and are willing to change it I suppose it couldn't hurt to change it but I would say it's probably fine. Worst case change it later, I don't think there would be any oil to leak out if you had to change it.

Straight oil for what?

I dont believe in additives, the oil already has everything it needs in theory depending on what you run. Just dont cheap out on the filter (napa golds are pretty decent or Walmart puralator/motorcraft) and change it regularly."
fordranger,fejdaro,t1_fejcx3g,1579168372.0,"Well he isnt aware that the lifter tick is just out of adjustment lifters so I'm assuming he is not familiar with the engine. 

The piston rings sound fine if it's not blowing blue smoke. And your valve seats really would be leaking oil into the combustion chamber and causing the same thing so id assume they are ok. 

The pcv is as he said to relieve pressure due to gasses from the oil heating up. Which is normal.

I'd switch back to the thinner oil first thing and get it running. Maybe do a cooling system flush as well just try and keep temps down and that could help reduce the vaporizing.

If you do blow the motor. A 4.0l will be a bolt up swap. Not sure about bolt in but the 4.0 shares the bellhousing patter with the 2.8 and 2.9 engines."
fordranger,fejcvft,t1_fejcnhc,1579167722.0,Depends on if you have the parts or not I'd guess...? I'd do the oil quickly as it sounds like thats definitely causing some known issues. And maybe just change it again when you go to adjust the lifters.
fordranger,fejck5z,t1_fejchki,1579167246.0,Well I know the fuel level sending units on these trucks arent in production and are very hard to fjnd/recondition but I think there is an electric pump in the tank. Not positive though.
fordranger,fejcdvr,t3_epfbbb,1579166979.0,"20w50 is insane.... at most I'd do a 10w40. Little thicker when warm over a 10w30. 

Also these arent hydraulic lifters! The lifters need manual adjusted, I would say every 20,000 miles or so? You could have oil leaking from the valve covers as they are generally cork gaskets or can be.

As for the fuel pump these trucks have two I believe, a tank pump and a mechanical pump on the engine itself. If you havent done any maintenance I would get the carb cleaned, and change the fuel filter and crank it over to make sure fuels getting through.

Edit: the oil light flickering could've because the trucks not able to pump that thick of oil through the system and have it drain back to the sump quickly enough."

fordranger,feidw8h,t1_feiaths,1579136232.0,"The tire change without gearing or gearing without a tire change will hurt gas mileage more because you're either making the engine try and turn heavier wheels that are larger making a low power engine lug alot more. Or.... gearing which will make the engine spin faster to keep the same speed as before. 

The gearing will help bring it back to stock.

A stock 2wd with 27"" tires and 3.55 gearing  I would think is average...

Going to a 33"" tire youd want ideally 4.33 gearing to match exactly but most gears are 4.10 or 4.56? So 4.56 will keep the lower powered engine a bit higher in the rpms for the same speed but in some sense keeps it closer to peak power and compensates for the added weight.. either way with 33s I'd not think youd be getting better than 20 mpg no matter what engine you get but the proper gearing will help keep the truck much more drivable."

A 2wd could add a few mpg.... the 3.0l is a very solid and decent engine if you drive it right. Still slow though. A 4 cylinder 2.3 or 2.5 will work, but you'll need better gearing, same with the 3.0l.

4.0l could be ok as long as you got 4.10s in the back.

WhitePeopleTwitter,fdtmtjq,t1_fdsjydz,1578719048.0,"Well after you pay for the hundreds of people doing the research over the 10 years it takes to develop, test, redesign, tweak to reduce negative effects, retest, do FDA approval testing, invest in mass production equipment, place it in your factory, hire workers, quality control, and all of that..... hmmmm sounds kinda pricy to me but you should obviously just eat that 10 billion dollar production  cost to develop this new product and just give it away for free.

Edit: forgot to add.... one guy took it and died to an unrelated cause but now the family is suing you and that hack doctor that reluctantly prescribe it to him for another 5 million."

Like I would love if everyone ever had access to basic services everywhere globally. You have a broken arm or like asthma that can be easily and effectively treated for pennies? You should be able to have access to that care I totally agree.

It just bugs people that think it can be as simple as snapping your finger and voila.... everything just works."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdt991l,t1_fdswpd1,1578713582.0,"You're talking about something different entirely there though. 

I'm talking about capitalism in less of a production term and more in a research and development. 

Production being some company buys the raw materials and the equipment and staffing to turn the raw materials into the product. Their continual cost is the raw material and staffing with an upfront cost only in equipment. So yes overtime a company making a product will work out bugs and make a better product faster which means it's cheaper. 


What I was referring to is research and development. That has to be tied to production as well. A company that spends 10 million on developing a new hangover cure has to recoupe that cost of the r & d so that gets tacked onto the price of the end product. They may cost .30 cents a pill to make but it cost 10$ because of the unseen cost of the development. Eventually the cost will come down or the patent will expire allowing a company like what you were talklng about start producing the pill at cost and only charge 1$ for it to maintain running cost and cover initial expenses. 

In any case.... my point is that medicine and equipment and knowledge at some point in time cost someone ALOT of money to improve and most of those country's are taking advantage of that in the way that one buys a used car over a new one. Lots of these company's in America are rich people buying a brand new car, they keep it to themselves for a few years and then once it's not the latest thing they sell it off at a much lower price to buy the next new latest car. The used car which is still nice and still works great is now obtainable by someone else for much cheaper. 

Get my point? New medicines cost alot of money to develop and produce which that cost has to be absorbed by someone which in this case is generally bigger companies that take that investment to recoupe costs and eventually use that to kick off research into a newer product that's better. The old one still works but that doesnt mean it came from nowhere."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdsvco4,t3_emxn5k,1578708425.0,"Reasons healthcare works in other countries...

1. Not the leading edge in new technologies, medicine, highly specialized fields.

2. Not sue happy countries, no hard numbers but the United States has insane amounts of lawsuits over some of the pettiest stuff least of which is health care.

3. Other systems work well because the individuals themselves arent super self centered and selfish. Everyone works when they can to pay into the system that will take care if them until they are better.

There are more I'm sure but those are the things I notice the most.

As much as socialized society has its appeal to many people in some aspects. It's extremely hard to deny that capitalism also plays a major role in advancement of knowledge and technology.

Edit: For those of you downvoting (which I'm not surprised) I am not against everyone being able to get a cast for a broken arm or being able to have a baby and not have to worry about going bankrupt. I'm just pointing out some of the reasons it's not as simple as snapping your finger  and making something just work like other countries."

IdiotsInCars,fdijats,t1_fdi5fdc,1578444178.0,"Never know what the situation is dude. I had people screaming at me when I had come out to my truck that'd been parked legally for hours. People I was parked by had left and whatever happened caused a few people around me parked far enough away that I was ""taking up two spots"" even though I was clearly parked correctly inside the lines. The one person was trying to break my offroad lights above the cab. 

Clearly the people that were screaming at me were idiots and were worse off after they touched my truck.

But my point is not everyone that is an ""asshole"" is an asshole. They might just have been in the right place and now the wrong time. 

Regardless destruction or damaging someone's property is wrong and petty, prank all you want but damaging someone's property is a downright shitty thing to do no matter what."
facepalm,fdigs4m,t1_fdif13a,1578442562.0,"Yeah you could be correct, the reference or joke is from the United States though in that our diesel pumps are Green handled and as far as I've been aware are not that different to the regular pumps. Also they dont really tell you or give you the option to go with non ethanol or mixed fuels at gas stations.

The joke stemmed from when a few states, who had previously not allowed people to pump their own gas, passed new laws or abolished old laws? Which meant people who had never pumped gas before had to pump their own gas. A bunch of people started putting diesel in their cars because they had assumed green meant environmentally friendly. Or that's what was shown in the papers."
