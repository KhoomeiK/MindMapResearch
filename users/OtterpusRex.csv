An Ox that is born with the exact same DNA as the steer will be WAY stronger and much more useful because of its size, power and temperament. All due to them not having testicles. There are some populations of deer that have this deformity naturally but they are extremely rare and usually very isolated.  

Deer semen is nowhere near as lucrative as race horse semen. Or any live stock just by volume alone. It's crazy expensive but there is not a huge demand. I mean you can buy a straw of crazy antler semen for $5000 but you're also going to have to find some high fence hunting range with the need for it. Yes there is a market but it's not that large. It's a lot easier to inseminate docile live stock than white tail deer. 

Sorry about that rant. Too many Bovine expos at the Ag Demonstration hall (not a joke). I don't like high fence ""hunters"" and I am totally biased against them. If you're going to mount a deer you best be prepared to tell that hunt story for as long as you keep it on your wall."

This is a dumb and childish move. This is how teens and children deal with issues.

Your last sentence was good.

Have a grown up conversation. Say you found the messages and that before you make a judgment you'd like to talk about it with her. Give her a few minutes to read the messages and collect herself.  Also she's not going to feel great about you going through her messages so humble yourself, apologize for going through her stuff,  and be prepared for blowback.

You're also dealing with the dude being a coke head. So he's going to be doing things that she has no control over. She needs you to be on her side. Let her know that you think his actions are the main problem and that her responses worry you because drug addicted people will say and do anything. Don't go around attacking her.

Edit. All I am advocating is for OP to create an environment that helps both parties feel safe to say what they really feel, without backing either one into a corner. I’m saying weather they should break up or not. OP can say whatever they want but it does neither party any good to attack the other one first. 

Relationships are hard and people have baggage. It up to OP to decide what to do but I think it’s best to have the most information before making a decision of this magnitude. 

Being humble and understanding is not weak. It’s being an adult. What if you have kids and they lie to you about something or someone You can’t break up with them. But you can have healthy thought patterns that lead to better, more honest communication."

If he does want to change it come down to humility, consistency, and honesty. All 3. 

Every little lie matters. Every single one. If he's comfortable lying at all then he will continue to do it. One thing that helped me was when I did lie was first acknowledging that, in one on one situations, I did lie. And probably more than I even knew.  I would get instantaneously  anxious and say the lie because it was a coping mechanism I developed because it was so much easier than telling the truth.  It's a weak excuse and no partner needs to put up with that. It's fight or flight. Flight is always easier. 

But what helped was my GF, when she was suspect of a lie ,would say something like "" I don't really believe you. How about you take a couple of minutes to think about this and we can start the conversation again, this time with both of us being more honest. I won't be mad if anything you just said wasn't your best choice of words. I understand you get anxious sometimes but i'm here for you and won't hold this against you.

Or theres the whole vitamin C and Magnesium benedryl melatonin path he can go down if he's not interested in pharmacuticles.  There needs to be some sort of balance His insomnia is a huge issue in this whole thing. 

Is there a way that he can wake up at 5:30 or whatever, take his day time medication, and then go back to sleep until that wakes him up?

adderall,fd9nlpe,t3_ekbj96,1578235688.0,"When it comes down to it adderall is a salt. It's super stable over time and doesn't ""expire"". The plastic (or whatever it is) outside of the capsule might be weird, or kind of sticky as you swallow it so that's the only part you might have an issue with."

They always play down to the lowest common denominator, which is not always the youngest. The older ones usually seem to be not as bright and for some reason the 14 year olds are usually running the show.  The older ones seem like protection for the more adventurous middle/younger ones, who they all cheer on and pressure."

There are some very strong plastic wraps for wrapping pallets and other commercial uses and I’m curious how strong that could be if it were twisted or braided into plastic rope. 

I’m not trying to be negative. I think we’re all on the same side here. :)"
