fatlogic,felm9zh,t3_eppkz7,1579225565.0,Someone should mention to these people that they have choice beyond ‚Äúeat a burger or starve‚Äù
fatlogic,fellwqn,t1_feli0t0,1579225308.0,*I* definitely think it‚Äôs a big deal. I was saying that I‚Äôve seeing people in the FA community saying that it‚Äôs not. My mother is diabetic and I absolutely know how serious it is!
fatlogic,felbf1j,t1_fel5u0s,1579218238.0,"Ive actually seen FA‚Äôs talking about how doctors act like diabetes is this scary boogeyman, when it‚Äôs really not that big of a deal. Just take medication and you‚Äôre fine! It makes so angry to read."
fatlogic,felandm,t3_epngga,1579217733.0,"I‚Äôm sure there are artists out there who DO draw fat people. There are probably also artists who draw exclusively cats and fruit. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs nice about art-and the world in general-there things to suit lots of different people‚Äôs tastes. You don‚Äôt have to see yourself represented everywhere and you don‚Äôt have to pitch a fit when you don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs honestly kind of narcissistic to do that, imo."
fatlogic,fekany5,t1_fejcxvy,1579196089.0,Loving this idea
fatlogic,fdtdvac,t1_fdtb2jg,1578715352.0,There‚Äôs a LOT of resentment and anger directed towards a group of people who are battling a torturous mental illness with a high mortality rate.
fatlogic,fdregsg,t1_fdre1wl,1578683382.0,Yes. This was basically what I was going to say. Wearing something several sizes too big gives a different look than wearing something that is deliberately cut to be oversized.
fatlogic,fdogp21,t3_em9kad,1578604787.0,"Yeah, I‚Äôm sure that happened üôÑ"
fatlogic,fdey432,t1_fde8rst,1578349062.0,I cannot thank you enough for this response üòÇ
illnessfakersgonewild,fd6v2fz,t1_fd6ktam,1578196083.0,"That could definitely be it, but I noticed that she was rocking the no pants/knee socks look even before she gained all the weight. So weird!"
fatlogic,fd5nkby,t3_ek3vy3,1578179409.0,WHAT?!
illnessfakersgonewild,fd5mrag,t3_ek23aj,1578179154.0,"Does anyone know the deal with why she has seemingly  never worn pants, and only wears knee-high socks?"
fatlogic,fczxa13,t3_ejpsjn,1578110206.0,what is this from?
fatlogic,fczx5mv,t1_fczpqrz,1578110142.0,"My dad is almost 74. He is a tennis player and has played several hours of tennis 2-3 times a week my whole life, and he still does. In the last few years, he‚Äôs also started working out with a personal trainer. He eats moderately and loves sweets but doesn‚Äôt obsess over having or not having them. He‚Äôs been a healthy weight my whole life. He also knows nothing about the HAES/FA nonsense, and it kind of comforts me to know that if I told him that he‚Äôs an oppressor for being fit and active, he would not know wtf I was talking about."
fatlogic,fcvohrs,t3_ej2xmk,1578006539.0,Is anyone else having trouble opening the link?
fatlogic,fcsgn3d,t1_fcr7x7z,1577916243.0,So curious to know where you work!
fatlogic,fcjixs9,t1_fcj2q7f,1577689381.0,Did someone actually literally do that?!!
fatlogic,fcjdnk4,t3_ehgy19,1577683983.0,"Being fat fucking sucks. It does. I‚Äôve been there in a real sense. But for a group to be marginalized and oppressed, it needs to be because of a trait that cannot be changed-like skin color or sexual orientation. I can‚Äôt even comprehend the mental gymnastics necessary to maintain the delusion that IWL isn‚Äôt possible. I recognize that even though I became fat because of a confluence of mental health issues (ED, depression, PTSD), at the end of the day, the weight gain occurred in a context in which it was possible to gain weight to that extent (because food is abundant here). It‚Äôs actually an incredible privilege to have access to such an abundance of food that eating yourself to a state of obesity is even possible. When these people compare their plight to that of actual marginalized groups, it makes me SO angry.

You are NOT marginalized. You are NOT oppressed, and no, you can‚Äôt take off a fat suit in one go, but it doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt make changes."

fatlogic,fcij5ao,t1_fci7qh9,1577663415.0,"Our ancestors were OBVIOUSLY eating 3 meals per day every day, and they were also DEFINITELY intuitively consuming lots and lots and LOTS of snacks as they migrated. Otherwise the human race would have totally died out ages ago. Duh."
fatlogic,fciir6d,t1_fchy51n,1577663229.0,But don‚Äôt joyfully move too purposefully from your bed to the fridge or then it will be the evil ‚Äúe‚Äù word and you‚Äôre a total fatphobe.
fatlogic,fciia7u,t1_fchs0ua,1577663000.0,"So true, but I‚Äôm guessing a lot of FAs are snacking or grazing during a good chunk of their waking hours and not actually experiencing many periods of unintentional IF. It would explain why so many have such a skewed view of what hunger is and what true starvation is. I suppose if you have very little experience with tolerating any kind of hunger at all, the idea or IF *would* sound torturous and evil and inhumane ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è."
fatlogic,fcihhft,t1_fchv6n2,1577662623.0,"Also, that‚Äôs awesome that you found something that feels helpful in your ED recovery! I really appreciated you sharing that, as I struggle with an ED myself."
fatlogic,fcihc27,t1_fchv6n2,1577662551.0,"It‚Äôs almost like different things work for different people! Maybe IF isn‚Äôt their thing and that‚Äôs totally fine-but it doesn‚Äôt equal OMG ANOREXIA STARVATION the way that they think it does. 

In one of his videos, Alan Roberts from Every Damn Day Fitness said that doing 16:8 for him is literally just not having something first thing in the AM, because he prefers to have a more calorically dense dinner. I happen to be a breakfast eater, so IF might not be my thing (I haven‚Äôt tried it) or maybe it would work for me if I structured it in a different way. Either way, it‚Äôs my damn business, and the way that FAs take other people‚Äôs personal choices re: weight and diet to be an indictment of their own bodies and food choices feels incredibly narcissistic and childish to me.

I truly don‚Äôt walk around yapping to anyone who will listen about the way that I structure my diet and the exercise that I choose to do, and honestly, I really can see how someone going on and on unprompted about keto or IF or whatever could be annoying and maybe triggering depending on your own history. It‚Äôs happened to me during various stages of my ED recovery. I don‚Äôt think that FAs realize that they can make emotionally healthy choices for themselves in a way that doesn‚Äôt make them an obnoxious, sanctimonious twat. 

Like, if the person talking about a subject that is triggering is not someone you know well, you can find a reason to leave the conversation or you can change the subject. Or, you can, I don‚Äôt know, learn to build up skills and ways to cope when you encounter something emotionally difficult. 

If it‚Äôs happening with someone in your personal life that matters to you, talk to them about it like a human being that recognizes that they‚Äôre likely not doing it to personally hurt you. It might feel satisfying in the moment to be snarky or sarcastic in response, but that‚Äôs not the way to effectively communicate your point, if that‚Äôs your goal. 

Then maybe go to therapy to unpack why other people‚Äôs choices feel like personal attacks to you, recognize that you can‚Äôt control other people, and work on coping in a world where-sorry-you‚Äôre GOING to get triggered."
