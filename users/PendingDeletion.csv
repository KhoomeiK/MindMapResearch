churningcanada,ff82j4l,t1_ff6auyf,1579664290.0,I have a stupid amount of credit cards.  Every one is auto pay and e-statements.
canada,ff656wr,t1_ff63n77,1579619405.0,Why use many word when few do trick?
toronto,ff0x1tu,t1_ff0wkxa,1579473112.0,"Thanks for that, and for the subtle insults in both of your replies."
toronto,ff0vlut,t1_ff0uzk6,1579472734.0,"Yes, really.  Also the expression you were looking for is to “live within your means”, not to “live within means”."
toronto,ff0tmbr,t1_ff0s3lz,1579472167.0,"Yeah... “I am feeding” is actually pretty damned ambiguous.  It could mean that you are earning enough income at your job to pay for your families food.  Or it could mean that you stay at home and cook.


Similarly confusing, a “traditional role” is something entirely different from a “role model”."
Dashcam,fekxhes,t1_fekrgg8,1579209629.0,"It absolutely was *not* intentional, you can clearly see the driver is looking to the right when he hits the green beater in front of him."
dogs,fehyttj,t1_feh8kp2,1579126622.0,Maybe that’s because dogs and humans are  different creatures with entirely different needs.
dogs,feh82bo,t1_feh7qyo,1579111081.0,I totally agree.  And limiting their time alone to 8-9 hours like the majority of dog owners do accomplishes that nicely.  Looks like others in this thread feel the same way.
dogs,feh4l65,t1_feh43ei,1579109021.0,"My question was in plain English.  Your answer is clear.  How is that not gatekeeping dog ownership, exactly?!  You’re saying people shouldn’t adopt unless they meet *your* incredibly restrictive standards."
videos,feh3io6,t1_feh334l,1579108390.0,"I’m fine with her getting this type of press, exposing her for the shallow bully that she clearly is.  I see no problem with demanding her to apologize, yet another example of free speech being used."
dogs,feh32oy,t1_fegm6fb,1579108126.0,"So, do you think someone should avoid adopting a dog if they would be alone for 8 hours on weekdays?"
dogs,fegleth,t1_fegik6a,1579096382.0,"You speak of lacking empathy and yet here you are gatekeeping basic pet ownership.  It also sounds like you’re anthropomorphizing dogs, who certainly wouldn’t have similar “feelings” about being inside and sleeping on a couch for 8 hours while their responsible owners are at work making a living."
videos,feflils,t1_feeqark,1579058887.0,Please explain how asking for someone to apologize in *any* way is infringing on their freedom of speech.
explainlikeimfive,fefjzdt,t1_fefcwrr,1579057932.0,That was the same guy both times.
dogs,fefi524,t1_feeu19u,1579056807.0,"Why would their bladder be “full” for the 8 hours?  If you think about it logically, their bladder would most likely start off empty since they would have just been walked."
IdiotsInCars,feffcdo,t1_fef07k1,1579055135.0,That... that’s why he linked it...
apolloapp,feesl8i,t1_fedcceu,1579040317.0,"Yup so same issue as everyone else, people have been posting about it for a month now.  I’ve seen zero with a response from Christian...

Here, someone even made a gif demonstrating the issue: https://imgur.com/a/DDym0kQ"
apolloapp,feesisj,t1_fe7bc2i,1579040276.0,Did you full screen the video?  Was it video and not a gif?
PersonalFinanceCanada,febp1o2,t1_febm1y9,1578961180.0,"Might’ve been 7.99 as seen here: https://forums.redflagdeals.com/amazon-ca-kraft-dinner-original-macaroni-cheese-12-pack-7-98-15-s-s-2290717/

Still well under my $0.75 price per box."
PersonalFinanceCanada,feax1ti,t1_fe9gaho,1578953079.0,Because young people in cities like Toronto can’t afford the detached homes...
PersonalFinanceCanada,fea6bog,t1_fea5po6,1578944858.0,"Where on earth are you shopping?  Certainly not anywhere that someone trying to save money would shop at.  Where I live, 4L of milk is $4.39 and KD is sold in a 12 pack for $6.99."
DIY,fea0p3t,t1_fe9wfou,1578943138.0,"Metal roofs are more expensive but I’m guessing he did that to better match the look of his house, which has a shingled roof."
PersonalFinanceCanada,fe8syk3,t1_fe8jvzd,1578930408.0,"Huh?  How much milk and butter do you add to these things?

Bowl of cereal: $0.50
Ramen: $0.50
Kraft Dinner: $0.75
1/2 liter of milk (more than enough for a bowl of cereal and KD): $0.55
2 tbsp Butter (thought I highly doubt anyone trying to spend so little on food would use real butter...): $0.25

Total: $2.55"

toronto,fdj0lk5,t1_fdhozgu,1578455402.0,Yeah it’s a wonder they managed to stay in business without your support.

financialindependence,fda3ekt,t1_fd9obbl,1578241196.0,Nothing in your comment demonstrated that a lease wouldn’t bake in costs for services which are included with the lease.
