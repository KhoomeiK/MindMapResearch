logodesign,ffen3ts,t3_et0qj2,1579855346.0,"The stroke thickness on the inside of the teeth and the tongue seem slightly overkill, and because you're using the same color stroke for the outside border of the graphic too, it gives me a hard time with associating the tan part as the mouth.

The places with shadow on upper teeth and tongue are nice touches, I think if you toned down the saturation for the tongue and made the stroke that color (also turn down the miter limit a notch) it would help communicate the snake's mouth a bit more effectively; you can try something similar for the teeth too.

I bet you can give this graphic a more ""meaner"" look if also focus on variation in stroke width in certain areas (eyes, top of the head, mouth).

Good job so far, if you decide to touch it up more in the future I would like to see the new version."

The text is not nearly strong / bold enough compared to the logo you have designed. Remove the line between the lines of text, and rather separate the two lines by using different type choices. The name and production needs to have way thicker lines, if the logo gets blown up to a larger size you will encounter legibility issues from afar.

Tracking and leading really needs an adjustment too, especially in ""DIE"" and ""SWART"". I'm not 100% sure whether you immediately decided on this text choice or experimented with other options, but if you did not, then I suggest you do; don't be worried about experimenting with different serif type options because at the moment it is clear to me that text was an afterthought.

This is the best advice I can give you.

Take a look at OpenDota to see averages for farm and experience for any hero. Even If your CM is going to suicide into the enemy then use it to your advantage and get more CS and let her furiously ping you when she dies. 

If you’ve deemed an early fight as unwinnable, the supp losing gold and exp isn’t nearly as harmful as it would be if you were to as a carry. You will also get the solo exp when she’s gone.

As a Dota plus subscriber myself, the most useful thing I find is the in match death summary that details how much and what kind of damage was taken during the fight.

If you are watching replays or streamers, focus on what the supports do early on (positioning, warding, items, aggro) to help optimize the carry’s farm potential. 

It’s good to know carry and support roles, but you should whittle down your hero pool to two heroes, or three at the most. It’s hard to learn other aspects of the game when you barely know how your own hero works (this a general statement I’m not making a jab at you or anything).

Also I would say learning how to not tilt is a big requirement for this game. I have had teammates in the past singlehandedly tilt our entire team into a loss because he addressed everyone as a “fucking retard” for forty minutes straight."

I have personal experience with friends only playing support, who are new, and I say the lane is being pushed too much so we should pull it back and have 0 idea what I’m talking about. I explained what is in the past but takes a few reiterations. So we fight dangerously close to the enemy tower and I lose the most optimal farm opportunity. 

I think  OP should teach the very basic essentials of the positions including some of the simpler mechanics to ensure they can do their best to help the team win."
