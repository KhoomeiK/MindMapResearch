intermittentfasting,ff7rjw8,t1_ff7r0kf,1579656630.0,I agree. Was just curious
intermittentfasting,ff7ldw9,t1_ff7eysd,1579652318.0,So what about those no calorie energy drinks like Bang? Zero cals but they have to cause an insulin spike which would end the fast right?

Testosterone,fe8bb6t,t1_fe6mal7,1578924440.0,It is possible your body will adjust. I agree that the rush of new/different hormones could be causing this. I noticed my boys were sore for about a week. It's different for everyone
Testosterone,fe8au8k,t3_enzbui,1578924326.0,4 weeks in is a bit too soon to start changing things. My recommendation would be to split up the dose to 2x a week and get labs done in a month or two. Lower your dose as necessary. Avoid using an AI at all cost.
Testosterone,fdrpjeh,t1_fdrot9t,1578687739.0,well I certainly hope you're not using the same syringe... the oil sitting on the rubber plunger of whichever prefilled syringe for X amount of days at a time may start to degrade before you inject...
Testosterone,fdromdd,t1_fdrogl0,1578687427.0,no the rubber plunger in the syringe
Testosterone,fdrnpas,t3_emvtts,1578687112.0,Some say not to prefill as the rubber plunger may degrade over time. Some say its okay long as you only prefill for a week or two. I personally do not prefill syringes.
Chattanooga,fdqk3ol,t3_emqyq2,1578668595.0,I'd play. Would prefer cash game as opposed to tournament format but that's just my .02
Testosterone,fdhtvtz,t3_elc0hq,1578430066.0,Never got anxiety here but I did realize that lying down while injecting glutes helps me twist more and keep the muscle relaxed.
tippytaps,fcm1v4z,t1_fclk59b,1577762051.0,I didn't even know slammies and wammies where a thing until that first comment lol
slammywhammies,fcm1o2z,t1_fcm10qs,1577761907.0,Was originally posted there and someone said it belonged here as well!
tippytaps,fcl9olm,t1_fcl7xo2,1577742842.0,Yes he's a Dobe. The uncropped ears often throw people off
tippytaps,fckxk7m,t1_fckuv8r,1577735343.0,Thank you. He's been a great dog and I hope Reddit enjoys him being a goof over his favorite toy
Chattanooga,fchiqe8,t3_eh9t1p,1577650807.0,The Sunday after Christmas...
Chattanooga,fbhfsh5,t1_fbgq8zj,1576872618.0,Not vegan but IG is derrikakers if you wanna be friends
