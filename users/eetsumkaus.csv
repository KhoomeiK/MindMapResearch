Well, a few more reasons. Since people are taught to think in ideograms from a young age, sophisticated kango (漢語) find people thinking in Kanji as well. Newspapers make heavy use of this because Kanji makes writing much more compact. It's rather convenient as a system actually. You can express many foreign concepts just by putting Kanji together, much as the way we use Latin and Greek roots to do the same. However the Japanese way is prone to creating many homophones, so in a way it reinforces its own need."
