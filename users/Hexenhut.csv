AskMen,feyw2l4,t3_eqvtup,1579451156.0,">When does joking between friends start being more than that?

&#x200B;

When it hurts or embarrasses the person on the receiving end; when it's done maliciously. This is different for everyone insofar as tolerance of ribbing goes. You said your husband doesn't take offense to it, but you do. Personally, when I've taken issue with an s.o.'s friend I just limit my own contact and voice my concerns. I wouldn't advise anything more as it could be controlling, and you respect that your husband can make up his own mind about the company he keeps, yeah?"

That said, the expectation of receiving the product of another person's labor, particularly by virtue of your relationship with them, without offer or intent to pay (or trade) seems exploitative to me personally.
