GetMotivated,fezridv,t1_fez2xh1,1579460725.0,"Show me where he labelled anyone as 'problem people'. He said that people who are passive and don't take action won't succeed, surely that's a truth self-evident? He then essentially said hard work and perseverance are the traits required for success, which again, is a fairly well-accepted and inoffensive assertion. So what exactly are you angry about?"
GetMotivated,fezqu0f,t1_fez59wm,1579460491.0,"Maybe my problem was stating my opinion in a subreddit populated by children.

> What if the other people are working what should I do then?

Why are you taking it literally? Have you never encountered figurative speech before? The intention of the post is to suggest you work harder/are more dedicated than the average person. It's implying that that, and the other traits listed, are the ingredients to success. It's not that hard to work out and hardly worth getting offended about."
GetMotivated,feyu2mb,t1_feyosda,1579450522.0,"What is your problem? Stop following the hivemind and hating on the post just because everyone else is. Of course in a lot of circumstances people's situations are out of their control, but in most they're not. And it's generally true that successful people work harder and have more dedication than unsuccessful people, regardless of the obstacles in their path. No need to be so aggressive."
GetMotivated,feyt0u5,t3_eqvo6v,1579450246.0,I love how all the comments of every /r/GetMotivated post are just people slagging it off. There has been some turds recently but this one's fine. It's clear what it's trying to convey - put the work in while other people are being idle. Y'all don't need to deconstruct every aspect of it.
davidgoggins,fesff0j,t3_eq4w6c,1579364576.0,That's such a rare occurrence it looks like you used the FaceApp filter.
dataisbeautiful,fegqzqw,t1_fegjcza,1579100486.0,Can confirm. My mum played her album on repeat in the car for years.

selfimprovement,fdhtfqp,t1_fdhjg6n,1578429846.0,I followed him a few years ago but I remember delving a little too deep and being put off. He did an interview for GQ where he came across as really standoffish and aggressive. He denied there having ever existed a patriarchy and basically refuted the claim there's ever been any inequality between the sexes. There's also a clip somewhere of him saying he'd have voted for Trump if he was an American. So make of that what you will.
selfimprovement,fdhf5yn,t1_fdgjnq5,1578421350.0,I'm not sure if Robert Greene is the best recommendation. All his books seem like manuals on how to be an effective sociopath.
selfimprovement,fdhf05y,t1_fdhckb7,1578421252.0,He does give some good advice. I've read his book and it was fairly helpful. But he is associated with the alt-right movement and has some fairly questionnable views.

funny,fddb1n1,t1_fdd9e9o,1578303407.0,Any source for this?
AskMen,fcy2sf7,t1_fcx8yvr,1578074028.0,This should be higher - gives a really useful perspective! :)
ConanBeingAwesome,fcngq6b,t1_fcng60f,1577811362.0,That's probably why he ran around a bit afterwards.

self,fc6ofz7,t1_fc6mnx4,1577485453.0,"I agree there! About a year ago I'd go to a friend's house and we'd 'jam', by that I mean he'd play and I'd struggle to copy. But it was fun!

Those are good suggestions too, I used to be into soccer (or football as we call it) so I'd like to reignite that interest. 

And sure I'd be up for learning some stuff on guitar! I do still have it and play it every now and then. But I wasn't good originally and I'm even rustier now."
self,fc6lpmi,t1_fc6jzb4,1577483539.0,Thanks man :)
self,fc6js52,t1_fc6je5s,1577482253.0,"Wow, that's quite inspirational. That's really good that you got so far out of your comfort zone despite feeling like that! While it's getting better, I'm also someone who's struggled with social anxiety and I still don't feel comfortable in big crowds, so I relate. I've heard lots of people wax lyrical about BJJ so I'm very curious to check it out now. Just gotta force myself out of my comfort zone like you did!"
self,fc6iiyh,t1_fc6hnxj,1577481394.0,"I've heard this a lot. I'd like to try that but I'm reluctant partly due to a lack of body confidence. I've always moved clumsily and awkwardly and feel quite self conscious doing anything physical, but I imagine it'll be a good step in remedying that! But also the places near me are quite expensive. Maybe I could look around for a cheaper place though."
self,fc6ib7n,t1_fc6he21,1577481248.0,Great advice in theory but I've always struggled with that! I enjoy quite a few different things but I don't know what I could turn into a hobby.
self,fc6i7rp,t1_fc6hgbf,1577481181.0,"I've been trying! But if I'm not immediately hooked it's very hard to build the motivation to continue, especially when modern life is full of more immediately gratifying distractions (games, social media etc). I also think reading should be a supplement to something more substantial in my life. I'm bored of laying about my house."
self,fc6i3q7,t1_fc6hka0,1577481106.0,I did teach myself to play a guitar (poorly) and I've dabbled in art. The only thing I haven't tried is a sport but I don't really know what to pick and where to go - much easier said than done!
self,fc6hn1a,t3_egds3q,1577480792.0,"Yeah, I agree. I get bored fairly early into movies and have to really force myself to continue. Then again, movies are a lot more action-heavy than they were a few decades ago. I think social media and technology has destroyed our attention spans. I know it has to mine."
