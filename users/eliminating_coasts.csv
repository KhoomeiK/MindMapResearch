Foodforthought,ffdprlx,t1_ffdkyr6,1579826043.0,"I just thought a personal example might make it more specific; there are kind of poetic problems and boring mundane ones, and I suspect in many cases, this is more of a matter of available means than about matters of character.

It's like the difference of ""skill"" you get if you change your saw, you know? Doesn't matter how careful you want to be, if your tool is going to jump it's going to jump, and you put something in a jig etc. Most of your comment recognises this, the problem of structural design.

What I'm observing is that this flawed structural design isn't just about the immediate lack of connection, but about things that stretch out the gaps between all those times you do actually have a chance to meet people. How those moments of branching out fail to connect together into a consistent alternative life, become almost more ritualistic or about keeping up a habit for when circumstances change.

It's like some old nineties music video about a guy in a matrix style cubical, who does something crazy and then the music changes and he's living this cool interesting life. Whereas in fact instead of these moments of breaking the norms forming a profound shift, the moment where things turn into colour, they form a temporary escape valve. 

What happens in practice is that you make a spluttering start at some alternative hobby or moment of doing something interesting, you start to have to compromise it for work, and so then you try another run.

Speaking personally again, I've not changed my attitude, but shifts in my available life have dramatically shifted the kinds of time I have access to, and this context has meant that many kinds of natural socialising I would do have become ineffective.

In some ways I'm not a good example of this, in that my particular context does actually give me a reasonable amount of time to build relationships, it's not actually the grey cubical intro, but in another sense I'm a great example, because it's a situation where ""people could do so much more if only we tried"" falls down, I knew this kind of thing would have an effect, I resolved to limit it as much as I could, and broadly kept the same attitude, but the practicalities have made a difference.

It's almost like making escape attempts, you don't do it because this is the one time you know it will succeed, you keep trying things because you want to be ready when an opportunity for one of them to work arises.

And so it's the same with relationships, you know that modern working norms damage the capacity to form them, but you do what you can to fight that regardless."

Foodforthought,ffdct28,t1_ffd3het,1579818160.0,">With the rise of modern technology, there is very little reason for any given individual to value the collective over their own self interest, as we are no longer bound by constraints imposed upon us by our family, friends, or community. We rarely seek their approval and we do not depend on them materially. 

I think there are other ways this can work as well as having to depend on people, there are ways that people can benefit themselves while benefiting others, the economic connection here is that ways by which people can build these organic connections of mutual support are limited by two factors.

The first is lack of control of time; you can't rely on other people if they will suddenly be called in to work overtime, and you can't always commit to help other people in the same way. Even voluntary activities get destabalised by the demands of work.

The second is the diminution of forms of collective social support, particularly relating to unionisation, but also the privatisation of previously public spaces, and the tendency to overlay zero sum games over previously neutral situations where cooperation that would not particularly benefit you would be available.

All that said, it's probably something you can study; most of this technological change has happened everywhere, but I suspect not every country is dealing with the same levels of alienation and separation."

It's not enough to say ""people need to do more about protecting young women and believing rape victims"" or even, for the more right wing ""we need to stop immigration"", because even if the police believe rape victims, and we put bars on every port and airport in the UK, we can't deal with british citizens raping people unless we actually *prosecute*.

When police officers start deciding that dealing with a specific crime might cause ""community tensions"", and then start ignoring it, they create the exact thing they are worried about, because in the north of england, you could get away with trafficking children if you were a muslim, *because* the police knew about it, and thought things might get complicated for them if they did anything. There was a void in policing, filled by victim after victim.

There are problems with police being racist, this didn't fix that, they still on the ground level tend to treat muslims worse, searching them more often etc. but instead of dealing with that on the ground, they reacted to their earned community reputation by flipping the opposite way at a higher level, giving actual known criminals of the worst kind impunity, and this kind of unequal treatment is only going to make racial tension worse."

Nobody does, but it's often true that if you start dialling up your explicitness and confronting autistic people with their behaviour, they will feel it's unfair that they are getting singled out. The problem of course is that they aren't, the signals they were being sent below their level of awareness are also being sent out to other people all the time, it's just they never responded. It's like a deaf person complaining that everyone shouts at them. Sometimes pointing out later when other people got a signal and shifted their topic can be helpful.

AskScienceDiscussion,ff8t3dn,t3_erji0h,1579695056.0,"We don't really know, the origins of human time perception are still a pretty knotty affair, with lots of analogies taken from computer visuals, talking about the frame rate of consciousness vs the visual cortex. But generally speaking, what we already know suggests that the visual cortex seems to be clocked faster than our conscious perceptions of moments, meaning that the brain is already batching together a large number of rapid perceptions into the time we experience.

So it's also possible that they would see things at the same subjective speed, but with 10x more detail, I say this because when we look at people's experience of ""time slowing down"" in extreme events, often the slowed perception of time is accompanied by tunnel vision and loss of colour. This suggests a hypothesis that the brain isn't actually ""running faster"" in extreme situations, it's still perceiving at the same rate on a low level, but is throwing away more information about the environment that is less likely to be helpful.

So just as people whose perception is tuned in the right way can perceive a piece of art in great depth, seeing lots of its patterns and details at once, we might expect that some people would just throw away less elements of any given scene, but perceive time at more or less the same rate, just in larger ""chunks""."

This particular calculation is about money vanishing, or rather, about the implicit value generated by transactions contributing a certain amount to GDP vanishing; if you get an economic crash, or, in the case of the UK, an economic slowdown that pretty much flattened growth, then the total value of transactions in an economy go down in real terms. This provides less tax from the government taking their cut, which is the comparison he is doing here, but also generally means that less services are being performed to benefit people's lives, keep people employed etc.

White checks happen when you try things intentionally, and can be retried after a failure by putting a point in the stat (or certain events/thoughts) red checks can't be retried.

Passive checks happen without you doing anything, and are what cause the various skills to say stuff. Different combinations of skills passing their checks will lead to different results, like conversations between skills. So if you have a high motorics stat, then you're more likely to get passives from all your motorics skills, but only because each of them individually check against a specific difficulty when they have something to say, and will probably have a higher value due to higher contribution to the skill rating from the base stat.

In a number of societies, this is where people tend to go through initiation rites to recognise their changing mental structure and support them, (while also basically demanding arbitrarily difficult things of them).

During this period, even leaving aside sexual development and the broad associated body changes, the brain is also being rewired, having boosted the quantities of grey matter at about 10, and then continuing to work on fine tuning things, ""insulating"" neural fibres from interference with myelin, and building structures until about 25.

Though it is true that their frontal cortex is underdeveloped, this was also true in childhood, so if you're looking for changes, I would say to emphasise the work that goes on retuning the limbic system and the hind brain *first*.

Pretty much every component of your cognitive processes is being reworked, and different systems will tend to benefit from this myelin speedup at different times, and so the first parts to get a boost in efficiency are parts relating to motion, but also fear, excitement, lust etc. and not just in magnitude either, with teenagers developing more complex emotions and being able to do more emotional prediction, forward planning, and react to more abstract social issues.

Arguing that you feel a video is clickbait is not invalidated because it's part one of a series of 100 parts that you haven't watched to the end, you can still perceive in the moment the creator's efforts to string you along.

Notice that I do not critique the fundamental argument, simply the framing. That argument could be wrong too, but if you sing me that argument, or a better one, to the accompaniment of inexpert children playing violins, I will also feel justified in disengaging, regardless of the content.

Critique that does so self-consciously on a superficial level based on the experience of engaging with a written work is not the same as rendering judgement on something you haven't read.

And even if I was, there's a categorical difference between openly low content low effort posts, (especially ones that are attempting to express dissinterest by articulate the causes behind it) vs stretching low content posts over long essays, with flow breaks and other rhetorical tricks to keep people reading.

I think you're right that news channels gave Trump a lot of PR, uninterupted coverage, and found his persona, and people speaking against it, to be exciting and good for drama, they also continued promoting the ""emails"" scandal in a way that has not been true of far more extreme behaviour by trump since.

It is also true though that if you try to find the [correlations](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/537A8ABA46783791BFF4E2E36B90C0BE/S1049096518000367a.pdf/div-class-title-explaining-the-trump-vote-the-effect-of-racist-resentment-and-anti-immigrant-sentiments-div.pdf), you discover that most people voted for Trump... because he was the republican candidate and they vote republican.

It's strange to me that this apparently boring fact has passed people by; Trump had a very small percentage of the vote in a wide primary, and then, once he was the nominee, people fell in line to vote for him. Not necessarily because they thought he was the best possible candidates, but because the republicans they *would* have voted for were knocked out.

But once you control for that, you get obvious things, like racial resentment, fear of immigrants, that mark out many of the independents, democrat leaning, or occasional republican voters who went to his side. And also, many of those with a negative assessment of the economy during his run, and wanted to try something new.

In other words, when you do the stats, racism, xenophobia and economic anxiety all come out, though being less significant than the fact that he was the republican, and got the republican vote."

On the bigger question, global energy consumption of non-hydro renewables in 2018 was 4%, so if total global energy consumption increases to 1.5 of it's value by 2050, a not unreasonable level, then non-hyro renewables would have to hit a growth rate of 12% per year in order to meet global energy demand. Solar PV, and Wind have hit over double that growth rate in the last 10 years on average, and biogas and solar thermal have almost hit it.

In terms of total capacity, if we wanted for some reason to meet global energy needs by only exporting energy, in the form of electricity and hydrogen produced from wind power from the EU, [we could do it](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190814081202.htm) for current demand. This would be ridiculous of course, because countries would install their own wind turbines rather than simply buy electricity from us, but there is actually an astonishingly large amount of energy available, and renewables, under current incentive structures, have met the growth rates necessary to hit it.

This doesn't mean we can just drift into 100% renewables obviously, lots of tech will need to be developed to transform our high energy industries and transport modes to take electricity or hydrogen as the primary energy input, and most likely a few will still need carbon capture and storage, like concrete manufacturing, but it is technically possible."

On the other hand, you can observe the extent to which running that distance affected him physiologically, try to infer how far he can get.

40% is already a non-negligable contribution, equivalent to how much energy many countries that are currently committed to coal get from it; if Bulgaria replaced their coal with that amount of renewables, they would be approaching zero carbon, for example.

How to actually build zero carbon infrastructure in poorer countries like Bulgaria isn't a matter of just swapping over percentages obviously, they'd need a mix of biogas, solar, wind, and upgrades to transmission networks to shift away from a centralised system - where power is being generated in a few plants - to something where people can generate a higher proportion of their own energy, but that's just like saying people will ""have"" to build roads; it's work that leads to employment and economic growth."
