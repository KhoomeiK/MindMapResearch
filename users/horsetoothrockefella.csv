BlackPeopleTwitter,feog0f6,t1_feoahnt,1579299604.0,"Colorado, I was a white kid that lived in a hispanic neighborhood. In 5th grade I was put into a ""gifted and talented"" program. White ass teacher spent the whole year on the Civil War. Her main point was that slavery had nothing to do with it, it was about the sovereignty of the south. Once she told all of us at the start of class that because we were in the gifted program we didn't get to go to recess any more. Of course we were pissed off, we were 11. We spent the whole class arguing with her about it, at the end of the class she said ""now you know how they felt in the southern states when Lincoln was elected..."" and the whole no recess thing was just made up to get us to see the Confederate side. Fucking ridiculous.  


And that was in 2001!  


The next year we spent the whole year on Lewis and Clark. Terrible."

 He could have gone inside for a hit of pcp and destroyed the evidence before his Hypothetical double kill and subsequent self destruct. 

Maybe he had an anger problem, went inside, stepped on a Lego, looked out the window and saw the kids get in the mower. In a fit of blind rage he ran out and turned it on. 

Or maybe he was just drugging his wife up, so she wouldn't wake up until long after his psychotic plan was completed. 

Or maybe he was playing hide and seek with the kids, checked in the house, then came out and was tired so decided to ride the bigass mower to look for them, and that's when he ""found"" them. 

Or maybe he just had to take a shit? 

All of these are just as likely to be the detail that actually happened in the real version of your made up story"

AskReddit,fej6m9c,t1_fej5csf,1579159040.0,"But hide and seek sounds like a made up/assumed detail. Maybe they were gonna try and scare dad, like hiding behind a door and jumping out yelling ""boo"" when someone walks by. The kids can't tell you what they were doing. Also I didn't see any source at all, but it's plausible. 

Shit maybe the kids knew about a wardrobe style door to Narnia inside the mower and were just about to go through safely as it powered up. We may never know. 

Maybe they just really hated their dad."

lost,fe08mpb,t1_fe04nai,1578806069.0,"Yeah she's not really a bitch, I just hated the way the character was acted, and I have a lot of ethical problems with having cancer, even in remission, and trying to have a kid. No significant other was ever shown that I remembered, so I assume she was straight up planning on being a single mom from the beginning. I don't know/remember if she had a job, or a lot of money, or something like that, but it seemed irresponsible. Then she gets pregnant, and she's ecstatic, and says ""Now I just need to get healthy so I can see the little bugger get into and ivy league school,"" which sounds to me like in her current state of health she's not going to live another 18 years, unless she changes her health somehow. That poor kid. She has the baby and dies a couple of years later, so depending on whether or not she had a significant other, she either had a baby just to make it an orphan, or the kid lives with his dad and has to grow up without his mom. It's the most obviously predictable outcome, in fact it calls Juliet's ethics into question, since she was willing to do whatever medical magic she invented to get her pregnant in the first place, especially as the one and only secret test subject."
