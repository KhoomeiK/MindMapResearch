NoStupidQuestions,fedydcw,t1_fedwrzw,1579022493.0,"I don't think there's any doubts about how much better China's railway system is compared to the USA. I grabbed a few links off first page google.

https://www.insider.com/trains-in-us-china-differences-2017-5
https://www.chinahighlights.com/china-trains/chinese-western-train-differents.htm

Speed, cost, coverage, etc, China are all better. Might be wrong though. Perhaps USA have a bunch of top secret public transportation system that I'm not aware of. Elon's Boring company haven't been put to use yet, so it's not considered. 

As for road, it's harder to tell due to the smaller gap. But on average of all the public provided transportation, I believe there's no doubt in which is better. So yes, when it comes to transport, China have better infrastructure compared to USA's ageing roads."
NoStupidQuestions,fedx96n,t1_fed9qkv,1579021825.0,"Yes, but those closed source parts runs on open source software. Hardware alone can't gather data. For hardware to parse data into meaningful information, it'd require software level or a built in chip specifically for that. Hardware can't parse a bunch of assembly level instruction to properly data mine. This would mean setting aside a good portion of the chip for it, thus making a gigantic disadvantage against their competitors. It would make a $1000 CPU as shit as a $200 dollar.

Also, there's no need to read the whole thing yourself. Why would you do everything alone? It's a community work. It'd mean swearing a few thousand people to silence to mask the loophole. There's only some libraries related to permission that you might need to care about, and those are actively worked on by the community. Simply checking within those community to see if anyone raised issue would be more than enough.

UI doesn't matter when it comes to data mining concerns. The part about audio had nothing to do with it. Bunch of drivers are pointless too. Yes, it is possible that there's something bad hidden in it. But it's difficult that nobody working on them ever said anything. 'Yeah, this code calls a bunch of functions from network library because that's totally needed to command renderer in GPU'.

Also, there's a difference between vulnerability and backdoor access being used. It's a vulnerability that nobody knows, not that it was used. Funny thing, in your link, another exploit was talked about, one that was actually used. However, of all the exploits, not one was discovered to gather information on the user. Just because the code's riddle with bugs and shit doesn't mean it's intentional and used to gather information."
NoStupidQuestions,fedvufp,t1_fedde61,1579020973.0,"China is roughly the same size as USA. They have worse terrain compared to USA. They have a bigger population than USA. The transportation system of China is larger than USA, in both road for cars, and trains/other railway method. However, at the current time of writing, China have better infrastructure than USA, despite falling far behind due to their shorter history with industrialization. While they have a longer history, I doubt bunch of dirt road built be ancient dynasty counts when we talk about modern road.

I fail to see how US government isn't to be blamed. EU system cannot be scaled up for USA, China system cannot be down scaled for USA. So unless there's a nation exactly the size and population of USA and yet perform better in those fields, this discussion is meaningless."

NoStupidQuestions,fed59sn,t1_fed4obi,1578999545.0,"Are you 100% certain the said AP investigation did turn all of the setting off correctly? I understand that it is indeed a problem, as the complexity of preventing being track is often too high for the average user (either intentionally, or due to other reasons). 

Also, I don't really trust VPN. They do not grant any control to the user. However, with andriod source readily available, you have the power to control the software (and thus hardware). Unless there is zero day vulnerability being exploited, it is impossible to be tracked. When it comes to hiding IP, tor might be a better option, as their encryption and system model makes it harder to efficiently track people en masse. Of course, if the encryption is cracked, or that a good amount of nodes were compromised, tracking would be possible once more. 

While there's many case of app tracking despite claims not to, there had been zero survillence code discovered within the open source android codebase. There had been nearly zero case of a total identity leak of tor network as of now.

As I major in such field, it grants me the ability to take matters into my own hand, such as keep out of dirty app, use/build open source firmware/OS, keep an eye out for permission control, etc. I do agree with your point.
