antiMLM,ff39kq7,t1_ff2trlq,1579536892.0,"Thank you, I was cringing at ""starvation mode"" too."
antiMLM,ff39etu,t3_ere2cy,1579536788.0,Clearly this person has no marketable skills and is severely lacking in the critical thinking department. Sad.
FundieSnark,fewf2rz,t1_feuv5ik,1579409526.0,So you've read/watched Pet Sematary then?
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fetizka,t1_fetdur2,1579375934.0,That's what makes her so great. She knew her Quirk was limited when it came to combat so developed a skill to work in conjunction with it.
fatlogic,fet1g50,t1_fesczkq,1579370909.0,"High while lifting, I was arguably underweight years ago."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fesxk1q,t1_fesc379,1579369951.0,I thought she was weak at the beginning of the show but she really can hold her own.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fesx7m4,t3_eqeh21,1579369843.0,"Not going to lie, Nighteye had me tearing up like a baby."
fatlogic,fes4q77,t1_fes3205,1579361405.0,"I did a Master's of Education. Unfortunately there are some academic disciplines that outright reject objectivity or dismiss the scientific method as just ""another way of knowing"".


I'm all for a researcher acknowledging emotions towards a certain topic and taking steps to mitigate how it could impact their positionality and research, but many don't even try."

Recently cut some weight and at a BMI of 33.5, major lifts still going up."
fatlogic,fepf08f,t1_feo74el,1579318856.0,Modern academia.
fatlogic,fepekxd,t3_eq53r6,1579318567.0,This makes me cringe at the memories of my Education professors trying to bring their agendas into the classroom.
FundieSnark,feipluo,t1_feihlfz,1579144068.0,I'm not very good with emotional people but I'd like to think I at least do the bare minimum.
FundieSnark,fefnoua,t3_eosjcm,1579060319.0,My friend's daughter is immunocompromised and could literally die if she is exposed to a child who isnt vaccinated against certain things. Fuck you Barfy.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fe8xf3q,t1_fe6omux,1578932031.0,I was just about to say...
antiMLM,fe6abeg,t3_enwwp3,1578885345.0,"Poor dog, even he knows how bad that stuff is."
FundieSnark,fe63jxl,t1_fe5z67p,1578880992.0,Imagine if she actually had to be a functioning adult and get a real job.
FundieSnark,fe62z2f,t1_fe5uhpx,1578880614.0,"Wait, she's an 18 year old? That's disturbing."
dbz,fe62lba,t3_enpvgo,1578880375.0,Were there any characters that couldn't fly? Not being able to fly would automatically disqualify them from competing.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fe5xpqv,t1_fe4jhji,1578877273.0,Back in the days when power levels meant something.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fe5xlx4,t1_fe55i1j,1578877205.0,"I started watching the sub since it's a week ahead, and now going back and listening to the dub is weird :("
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fe5xj7n,t1_fe5gun7,1578877159.0,"I did see several ""Deku went Super Saiyan"" comments going around."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fe5wje6,t1_fe5srhc,1578876532.0,@raptorwithashotgun on IG. They are about the only cosplay account I care about.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fe4ifmf,t1_fe4gra6,1578859630.0,I thought using All For One's theme for Deku Infinite 100% was pretty fitting. I wonder if he could have taken on All For One in that form.
FundieSnark,fe035oh,t3_engvrn,1578801902.0,This looks like some of the most boring people to be in a room with.
FundieSnark,fdvbr1r,t3_emwq7j,1578745778.0,"That sounds like an incredibly boring, sheltered life. Wow."
RagenChastain,fdm97jr,t3_em08go,1578542953.0,This pretty much proves she barely spends anytime in the gym.
FundieSnark,fdctkae,t1_fdccszc,1578283912.0,Couple social media accounts are just weird in general.
FundieSnark,fdcpplj,t3_ekjw9s,1578280930.0,Why is her finger on the trigger??
antiMLM,fdcgvxm,t1_fdb29u5,1578274591.0,"If you are in a caloric deficit, you can lose weight just eating McDonalds."
antiMLM,fdcgtl1,t1_fdblzu9,1578274546.0,Apparently not that intelligent of a person or a total sellout too.
antiMLM,fdcgipy,t1_fdcbonp,1578274335.0,"I'm not defending the being in an MLM, but maybe they are doing high volume, low weight work? Or working on endurance, recovering from an injury and reestablishing strength, etc. The weights are not remotely the issue here, the being in a scam and pushing others to join their scam is."
FundieSnark,fdc5ol1,t1_fdc4kea,1578267605.0,Yeah. Similar with YouTube as well.
fatlogic,fdb52ut,t3_ekd3yk,1578253921.0,"I feel sorry for this person and as others have said, they need serious therapy."
antiMLM,fda74vm,t1_fd6udj1,1578242526.0,"Thing is all of the nurses I know, people who actually help people, don't post constantly on social media about how they are changing lives. They just do it and have personalities and interests outside of their work as well."
RagenChastain,fd5cews,t3_ek19le,1578176228.0,"Wait, she's still planning on getting a tattoo for the ""Iron Distance"" event?"
FundieSnark,fd2r5gq,t1_fd236zt,1578150847.0,*Barfy.
FundieSnark,fd04oet,t3_ejn735,1578113578.0,And then Jesus clapped.
FundieSnark,fcuk7ut,t1_fcu4ss7,1577982873.0,I think the snark is not being able to make it herself and posting about how joyfully he is cleaning up for her.
FundieSnark,fcuk3qp,t1_fcuc7di,1577982809.0,Barfy sounds like an amazing name for her.
antiMLM,fcujj6p,t1_fcufsjm,1577982439.0,"I'm glad he was able to escape, and I have seen recent legislation passed where military members go through education on MLM's (granted, I question how effective the education is actually going to be though)."
FundieSnark,fctaptc,t1_fcta6eh,1577937478.0,"Oh yeah. I guess I don't know any adult that says ""throw-up"" in that way."
FundieSnark,fct9zw9,t1_fct301n,1577936891.0,I literally just recovered from Norovirus and thankfully didn't vomit anywhere outside of a toilet.
FundieSnark,fct9wbq,t1_fct7l73,1577936812.0,Good luck in your continued progress.
FundieSnark,fct99r3,t1_fct686s,1577936309.0,"I use vomit, don't really like calling it anything else."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fcsw2w8,t1_fcsvik8,1577926579.0,"Yeah, I see no redeeming qualities to him. I don't even find much comic relief in him as others do. I'm sure he does eventually mature and evolve, but he does nothing for me as of now and trying to watch the girls showering would get him at minimum seriously disciplined at most academic institutions."
fatlogic,fcs0why,t1_fcs0dd8,1577909678.0,"Yeah, admittedly there is a great deal of evidence of medical malpractice and testing on Native populations by mostly White scientists at the time. Tying it into modern fatphobia though? Big stretch, and helping populations disproportionately impacted by obesity I'd say is the opposite of white supremacy."
antiMLM,fcruv36,t1_fcrh2pe,1577906924.0,"Hey, don't insult Buffy the Vampire Slayer like that. She was way smarter."
antiMLM,fcqvbjb,t1_fcp2p6g,1577892756.0,"Yeah, only engagement on her posts is from other huns getting ""chills"" from how ""inspiring"" she is, or her mother."
nosleepfinder,fcpdtw7,t1_fcp8j11,1577859753.0,Thanks so much! It was literally one of the first NoSleep stories I read years ago and I was just reminded of it today.
antiMLM,fcp5vyv,t1_fcp3ktl,1577851486.0,"Shit, that's what I do..."
FundieSnark,fcp4kwt,t3_eicl1j,1577850274.0,"On an unrelated note, wow his quads are small. Does he not even lift?"
antiMLM,fcowmr3,t3_ei3jth,1577843591.0,"I'm not an expert on women's fashion, but is that really something to brag about?"
antiMLM,fcow8wr,t1_fcosakg,1577843290.0,"Yes and no. Yes, the companies do prey on these people, but at a certain point and with all of the knowledge about MLMs out there, you need to take some accountability for yourself."
antiMLM,fcovib0,t1_fcomaix,1577842709.0,Unfortunately I was unfriended when I actually very kindly pointed this out and pointed out the evidence to them.
FundieSnark,fcougii,t1_fconq7a,1577841873.0,"I was referring to Hello Fresh, seems like Hello Fresh made them remove their post."
FundieSnark,fcok853,t3_ei91q3,1577834319.0,"Also seems like a typical corporate response, though apparently they did take action."
antiMLM,fcnr88b,t1_fcljh4n,1577816912.0,"I think I understood what she meant. ""Actively"" dying as in the last steps of dying with hours left, vs terminally ill but still has weeks or months left."
antiMLM,fcicm8u,t1_fci5olo,1577660564.0,"Fat burners are essentially just super strong stimulants, though nothing about them will automatically prioritize fat loss."
antiMLM,fch3j5w,t1_fcfpov0,1577646904.0,"I have had random encounters with what I assume was Amway, but they never explicitly said it, and everything seems too perfect in this story."
aspergers,fccdxcz,t3_egyg8a,1577597293.0,"Bear in mind MBTI is very methodologically flawed and isn't taken seriously by most psychologists, though still overused in Education and HR settings. Barnum/Forer effect is a major problem it seems to have as well with issues with construct validity."
antiMLM,fcbzros,t1_fcaj2wr,1577592793.0,"He also needs to divorce her, stat."
antiMLM,fcbccuf,t1_fcb1utm,1577585137.0,Also impedes MPS (muscle protein synthesis) if you are working on putting on muscle mass.
antiMLM,fcb0qj5,t3_egubag,1577580400.0,"Alternatively, just don't use essential oils at all."
firebrigade,fcau38b,t3_egdz8f,1577576634.0,"Have to say, this series ended up much better than I thought, and the final fight with Burns was pretty great too. Wish Season 2 would be here already."
FundieSnark,fcam5lk,t1_fcaklgf,1577571979.0,"Yeah, kind of funny when people want to go back to ""the good old days"" when stuff was so horrible then."
FundieSnark,fcaj6gq,t1_fcabeap,1577570189.0,After thousands of years. Apparently women in non-modern times were just meant to suffer.
FundieSnark,fcadlvc,t1_fca0ta2,1577567429.0,"Hearing you describe all of that makes me very happy I'm never having children. Unfortunately, people like Bethany still are."
antiMLM,fc9hbd2,t3_egmrw0,1577552677.0,"The women I know who are legitimate supervisors, managers, high up in business, etc. don't go around calling themselves #bossbabe's either."
antiMLM,fc9f6ao,t3_egpfjj,1577551775.0,"I'm a male who doesn't wear makeup, so obviously I'm not the target demographic, but I don't see in anyway how this would make anybody want to buy the product."
fatlogic,fc7bzxk,t3_eg4s63,1577503024.0,It must be hard being constantly triggered like this.
antiMLM,fc7anqw,t1_fc648md,1577501985.0,I think that's the first male Scentsy rep I've heard of too.
FundieSnark,fc7268k,t3_egizxu,1577495546.0,Imagine being this judgemental...
antiMLM,fc1wp7c,t3_efoa14,1577332043.0,I don't actually know of anybody who constantly posts about any products they use or food they are eating.
