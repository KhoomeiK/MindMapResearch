depression,ffab5fr,t1_ffaavyo,1579731454.0,"Ugh that's horrible, I hope you feel better or that you're feeling okay. I'm sending you a virtual hug though and if you want to talk feel free to message me."
toastme,ffa9ac4,t3_eshbhv,1579730384.0,You're so pretty :) and I think it's awesome how you're there for your mom!
depression,ffa8c8i,t3_esedcq,1579729856.0,"Fuck that person, I'm sorry that happened to you OP.  Typical tough guy over the phone but not in real life. I know the feeling of wanting to isolate but just know that there are plenty of people who can relate here and I hope its supportive to you as it is me. :)"
SuicideWatch,felhc6r,t1_felh6xs,1579222182.0,"Thanks, just messaged you."
SuicideWatch,felalfk,t1_fel25qh,1579217697.0,Sorry for your loss.
SuicideWatch,fek4c3w,t1_fek2stz,1579192330.0,"Hey bro, I can be a friend if you'd like. I'd rather have people I can relate too anyways."
depression,fehtew1,t1_fehmzzk,1579123507.0,"That's not how someone is supportive, and if you're gonna say things like that you shouldn't comment in this sub."
depression,fea60v0,t1_fea53az,1578944766.0,"Okay well first off you don't know how anyone's life is? Secondly if someone is struggling with depression it doesn't matter who they are or what their life is like. There's plenty of information about these things, how about instead of assuming things you actually read about depression. I hope you do."
depression,fea4xrk,t1_fea0u6l,1578944411.0,"Fuck you, I hope you never have to suffer through how hard depression can be. I would never wish that on my worst enemy. It also doesn't matter what someone's background is either, so stop assuming things because you have no fucking clue what you are talking about."
depression,fea4f4l,t1_fe9w8v7,1578944276.0,How can you say those things to someone? Depression can affect someone's entire life. I've also definitely thought about how it would affect my loved ones. I hope you take the time to read about why someone struggling would consider taking their own life. Also try having some sympathy maybe?
SuicideWatch,fe7jt3y,t1_fe7ipcc,1578915571.0,"I know how you feel, I wonder what will happen if I don't talk to my supportive friends for a little bit."
SuicideWatch,fe55w17,t3_eno6ue,1578865923.0,"Hey OP, do you want to talk? I'm here."
depression,fdzcr4o,t1_fdzcno9,1578789018.0,"
I understand and will respect that."
depression,fdyjuma,t1_fdu7o1o,1578780589.0,Wanna talk? I can somewhat relate I think.
depression,fdyivfv,t3_en9okh,1578780233.0,"You should look into the band The Amity Affliction, their song all fucked up is pretty sad. I love them though and can relate to their songs."
depression,fdyh697,t1_fdvm8ht,1578779726.0,Hey are you doing okay? If you want to talk I can message you or you can if you're more comfortable with that. Even if you don't want to chat I hope you're okay.
SuicideWatch,fdyen4y,t1_fdxivbv,1578778944.0,Please stop preaching your religion to others.
depression,fdlqhlw,t1_fdlpz82,1578530068.0,"You're right, It's probably my depression which honestly makes me feel like another person sometimes. How I think or act, such as projecting what people in the past did on to someone who isn't like me. I have been wondering recently whether or not I have been letting my mental health define me. I know that it shouldn't, but is it to late I wonder?"
SuicideWatch,fclbfm8,t1_fclazj2,1577743953.0,"You're welcome, I just don't like when people are playing arm chair psychologist.  That person has no clue what they are talking about. Regardless though you being okay is more important"
SuicideWatch,fcjv6j9,t1_fcjnxlb,1577706320.0,I wish I could downvote your comment twice. How could you say that to someone? You don't need to be an armchair psychologist for people either.
SuicideWatch,fcjv4na,t1_fcjphbf,1577706245.0,OP I'm sorry you had to deal with that comment. What they are saying isn't true and I'm glad you are okay.
depression,fcipqv2,t1_fcipp7m,1577666910.0,Thanks I sent you a pm
AskReddit,fc2hiyi,t1_fc1ts6e,1577360559.0,You're implying that the majority of people in the countries you listed welcomed the nazi invaders. That's an insult to all the victims. So fuck off you bigoted nazi smooth brained fuck.
AskReddit,fc1sotm,t1_fc0uupl,1577328489.0,"Fuck off, nazi scum."
toastme,fc1cww2,t3_efjmdw,1577315007.0,"Merry Christmas! You are so pretty by the way. :) My mental health hasn't been the best too. I know how much things can truly suck, but finding others that I can relate with helps so much. I hope you are enjoying the holidays though, and those with mental health issues are never alone. :)"
