fatlogic,few260g,t1_feuxu5s,1579404436.0,"The majority of my symptoms went away when I got below 200lbs. The rest disappeared with consistent hormonal birth control, to the point where all that's left is the hair growth. The change was so significant with even a small reduction in weight that I was kicking myself for not doing it a lot sooner."
fatlogic,feuv5x1,t3_eqhfl0,1579390288.0,"My knee is definitely getting better. It's turning all the colors of the rainbow, but it's back to a normal size, and I can walk comfortably.

My job schedule is shifting to one that fits my life a little bit better, and I am genuinely excited. I've been working late nights since May, and I never quite got the hang of it. Working 12-9 seems like a small shift from 2-11, but when I was previously on it, I had a regular sleep schedule and woke up before my alarm.

Also great news: with this change comes a total ban on snacks at our desks. While I know I absolutely could have stopped snacking at any time, having an outside force to help resist the urge is a huge help.

With all this change happening, and a lot of stress leading up to it, I'm spending this weekend recouping. Laundry, groceries, journaling, and chilling with the cats to reset my sanity meter."

Rave: I slept great last night, and the sun is out today, so I'm basking in it. I'm learning more and more that I am basically a plant that needs mostly water and sunshine to thrive."

fatlogic,feiaay4,t1_fefew4l,1579133826.0,"Same here. I want pecs, and I want the best recovery possible. Being active and at a healthy weight goes a long way toward making recovery as easy as it can be."
fatlogic,feg15cs,t3_eomg76,1579072487.0,"Rant:

Last night I went to get the mail at our complex. It had been raining, and I was wearing my sneakers that aren't water-repellant at all, so I hopped up on the curb to avoid a deep puddle. And then I fell, hard, on my left knee. Other knee in the puddle. I sat there for way too long, convinced I had broken my knee with all my 189lbs. Some dude in the parking lot had to come help me up.

The good news is that while it is bruised and sore, I have a full range of motion with no sharp pains, and had my boyfriend check it just to be sure. It'll be fine with ice and rest, but it's putting a hitch in my plans to get back to the gym tomorrow.

Ugh."

Hello, friends. I've missed this kick in the pants."
minimalism,fdpqk2t,t3_emcv6s,1578636734.0,"I loved having an e-reader, but then I got a job where I can't have it, even on breaks, due to strict tech security. So I got a library card, which I think is the next best thing for keeping my house tidy. I know you mentioned it, but honestly, I had been one of those people racking up low-cost ebooks for years, so I hadn't even thought about a library since leaving college."

In the US, women's shoes are 2.5 sizes bigger than men's. I wear a 7.5 in women's and a 5 in men's/boys."
