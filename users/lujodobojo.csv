AskReddit,feejxvq,t1_feej0b1,1579035268.0,"It's not has hard as you think actually. I decided to opt for a digital label mostly, although we have pressed a couple of vinyl and cd releases.

Initially it was fueled by being heavily involved in the UK free party scene and evolved as a side hustle to get our names out there and release tracks we were really happy with. As a crew post party one of our favourite activities was to hit the studio and frantically write tracks before the post rave blues kicked in. 

Hardest part is getting a contract with a decent distributor, once that's in place it's actually pretty simple. We had another company take care of our release promotions. They basically have access to a list of DJs that will review and play releases for us. So far we've had plenty of support and had direct contact with big names in the industry.  It's been a wild ride and incredibly fun. We are on our 60th release and also planning on staring a new imprint in a different genre."
