There is also virtual therapy these days. You may also have to set clear boundaries with him as to when you need time for yourself. Tell him something like ""hey I have a lot going on today and just need to power off my phone for a few hours I will message (or you can message me) at ___ o'clock"" or ""hey it's been really hard to take care of myself lately and I feel like it's hard for me to be all there for you is there possibly a chance that we can switch the subject for now?"". Another option is to offer other help or options that isn't talking."
offmychest,fdbd4so,t3_ekhqgv,1578256208.0,"Hi, I'm curious to know if you are dealing with trauma. Like a childhood form of it perhaps? Not trying to pry but I have felt the same (I have not been in therapy as long, but have been for a long time). I can't really say I don't believe in the power of therapy because I myself am planning to pursue a career in mental health counseling this year. To make it short I endured a couple of adverse experiences growing up and talk therapy has never been particularly effective for treating that. It helps with daily stressors and stuff but not so much my trauma. Idk if you can relate but I often feel like talking about it just feels worse or pointless. Sometimes you just feel this constant need to address this overarching theme in your life but you can't quite touch on it? Therapy does sometimes feel like a ""scam"" but I just wonder what it would be like with absolutely NO ONE to talk to ever."

Random suggestion but have you considered joining a community that advocates for mental health/eating disorders? Not necessarily a support group but a community type initiative. Just volunteering and talking to people about this topic can be incredibly therapeutic. It also allows you to be social and turn your attention outward more often. Things like this have helped me when I was attempting to stop self harming. It's been 3 years since, I have engaged in any of that behavior and now I'm even applying to be a mental health counselor. We are social beings and can really benefit and heal through our interactions especially if we are really taking the healing process seriously. Either way, I wish you amazing health, growth, the ability to cope and understand your boundaries and sincere happiness!"

We all went to highschool together and knew each other well so I didn't think it would be so terrible considering the circumstances. Otherwise yeah that is true."
