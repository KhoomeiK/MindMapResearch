The best bet is to do 3 days a week focusing on Pushes one day, pulls the other, and then legs  on another.

There's more people that main Bayo that have never played her games, and that's true for FE too. This served as a good ad for her games too, so it's naive to believe that she wasn't overpowered intentionally.

People who were gonna be happy with anything don't care as long as they can win. You know, that same slot of people that ""just hope she's fun!"" Is code for wanting good feeling mechanics, and it's invalidating the whole reason anyone mad about FE deserves to be mad.

If you don't get it, then stop trying to make other people see your side, because that's side isn't apart of this object. 

The argument is very clear ""blacklist this franchise from getting new characters"" and any reasoning that you can muster has to come from a place where you assume that we don't understand why they picked this character, so you quote  a bunch of known business models that make you feel good.

Of course we understand why. That's why people made themselves believe that blacklisting FE characters was a preconceived notion that we (Nintendo included) were all in on.

No one would care if FE was getting another character if it wasn't hyped this way. They shouldn't have been the cherry on this challenger pack."
smashbros,femfosn,t1_femepko,1579253072.0,"In this game about picking your character because it's from your favorite franchise, ""as long as their fun to play"" doesn't cut it.

This isn't super polygon fighters. That shit's probably just as good as Smash. Literally reskin Byleth with a shitty Dante skin, and people wouldn't be as mad, because the sole purpose of this game is to fight as your favorite character from a different game.

Byleth is insulting on more levels than I can think.

A silent protagonist with less personality than Link. (Any characterization you inferred onto that character is completely invalidated by the imp they included to talk for them)

I wouldn't touch that character if I wasn't a fan, so unless it's a broken God tier, who cares? And by that regard, Byleth is already an advertisement that people are mad at, so the ones on the fence like you will fall in love when Nintendo inevitably releases them as a broken overpowered fuck, to quell the backlash that they rightfully deserve for shoehorning this ad in as a pretend cherry on top of this pretty boring fighter pass."

It's still money laundering through the distilled actions of ""would a governing body have prevented you from obtaining that money if you hadn't purchased the government?""

 The answer being ""yes, absolutely, happens in other countries all the time."", I'd say it's society's definition that needs some updating

todayilearned,fdh6hk8,t1_fdgzy8t,1578416419.0,"No. I'll elaborate instead.

Some artists are super talented, but none of their work is worth more than the time, and materiels.

The overvaluation of the art is mainly to benefit the buyer, who can use the value they've set for it as a tax write off if the painting is donated, which is usually is.

Since the value is created by the initial purchase, the artists work can now be valued similarly, so more people can get in on the money laundering, and this artist feels like they are a genius, when they're just being paid off very well to be used.

Unless they are the one telling the art buyers about the plan, in which case, they are the genius, and can just start throwing random aesthetic lines onto blank walls."

A ninja warrior type workout with a lot of static holds.

The meso is a body builder focusing on large lats, upper arms, and big definition across their body. They can use every machine in the gym, and tell you specifically which muscle it's working.

stocky thighs, wide footing and calves, and abs made of cinder blocks for even more foundation.

Animals don't deserve to die. I'm biased.

Added benefit. Murdering and eating plants won't poison you either. Unlike doing it to an animal, one that you literally couldn't eat without tools, in the wild if you tried. Most of our tools were developed to make fucking plants to death easier, or defending against predators.

Our species of animal eats and evolved on collecting and cooking plants, and should unlearn whatever empathy we have for them. They are food.

You'd have to be a legit psycho if you can talk about a cow, chicken, or pig that way, and you'd be factually wrong too. Large scale farming or consumption of these animals didn't happen until recently last millennia.

Steer (cows) used to be used forpulling tools for agriculture, but the byproduct of having milk when they had given birth was a weird thing that mostly happened in Europe.

Even chickens were used for breaking down seed and fertilizing yards and the occasional eggs. They weren't bred for this kind of egg laying until recently either. It's very unhealthy for them.

You only ate your animals when times were fucking tough, and crops were too.

Maybe people should extend the weird plant empathy toward all  the other animals, since we only started hunting during the ice age?

And don't compare yourself to something with a short intestine and harsh ammonia urine. You don't have the capacity to eat chelesterol and stay healthy.
