I said nothing wrong- I have had a ton of experience with people like that user (frankly I can’t see anything further you or he said as I’ve blocked you both, as speaking to you is evidently meaningless) so I *know* about them- and for you to say I did say something wrong out of nowhere just so you can fit in says a lot about you. You seem hypocritical on your end, and I frankly couldn’t care less about your opinion. 🤷🏻‍♀️👋"
todayilearned,fe9rgsq,t1_fe9256r,1578940870.0,"Adults back then were young teenagers. They could easily be considered children in our eyes today. Our lifetimes are short and God knew they would be in a better place, reunited again afterwards. You sure are hateful and it shows you have a LOT of resentment against God for crap that’s obviously gone on in your life, so you use him for blame. I feel sorry for you and I’ll pray for you."
todayilearned,fe9qs9x,t1_fe8hhuo,1578940665.0,God didn’t send Satan after them. Satan asked God and God allowed it under certain circumstances (eg that he not be killed). He was fully restored afterwards.

If you’re going to attempt to insult someone, at least use proper grammar. That’s pretty humiliating if you can’t understand basic English grammar at your age (and if it’s your first language). I can’t take you and the others seriously, so thank you for the genuine entertainment! I got a good laugh! 👏"

AskReddit,fddh0lw,t3_ekgrxd,1578311897.0,"I remember years ago, in my dream, I was in a courtyard made of cobblestone, with grass and trees and pretty flowers surrounding the outside of it. I was wearing a white dress/robe like thing. This man with wavy brown hair and in a similar white linen robe, runs up to me in the courtyard, and I run to him excitedly. He picks me up and twirls me around, puts me down and looked at me lovingly. I then woke up. 

I remember thinking the love I felt in that dream felt so real, and that this person who I’ve never met before also felt real. For days I couldn’t stop thinking about it and I remember all of the dream vividly to this day. It’s amazing the kind of impact dreams can have."

FundieSnark,fcfi46v,t3_egi5m1,1577630211.0,"I think what she was saying was her child was a gift so it would be like a happy day like Christmas all over again, not that he was the next savior lol. I’m a Christian but Christian fundamentalists are annoying as shit and I wouldn’t ever want kids myself, but she wasn’t implying what you stated at all.

I feel like it was trashy of her to show off the bag in a supposed post about her kid though if that makes any sense. Can’t stand the hypocrisy."
FundieSnark,fcfgrxg,t3_egkqr8,1577629771.0,Good lord. Just because someone disagrees with a lifestyle choice doesn’t mean they’re afraid of it. They’re also not misogynistic. It genuinely seems like you are hateful and jealous of their successes and blame God for all the things wrong in your life. That’s pretty sad. 🤷🏻‍♀️👋
