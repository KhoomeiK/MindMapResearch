The following:

> He was convicted of several small crimes as a youth, but also two counts of arson including burning down an elementary school, which he spent 7 years in prison for.  

He paid his debt to society for these crimes. They are irrelevant to the case.

&#x200B;

>He was seen near the location of the levee breach directly after the breach occurred.

With two other volunteers. Admittedly, he did not remember the name of one of them, but they didn't know each other to begin with.

&#x200B;

>During those questionings, he admitted to moving sandbags on the levee.

He moved four or five sandbags to a depressed area in an attempt to reinforce the trouble spot.

&#x200B;

>He was then arrested for an unrelated burglary after the levee break and sentenced to 10 years in prison for the burglary.

This was not the crime in question. He wasn't a great citizen, but a burglary charge is irrelevant.

&#x200B;

>Multiple witnesses testified that James Scott told them he caused the levee break.

Maybe he did. They were at a party, and he was inebriated.

&#x200B;

>Where the breach occurred was considered the strongest part of the levee.

This was said by the ACE engineer in charge of the levee, whose entire reputation was at stake. Admitting that the levee was faulty would mean admitting that ACE designed a faulty levee. They couldn't have that.

The defense called a civil engineer and a soil scientist who had not been involved in the levee construction. This is what one of them had to say:

&#x200B;

>In the wake of the Great Flood of '93, Hammer participated in a multi-disciplinary analysis of the 1,083 levees that succumbed to floodwaters along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. The study found six factors that increase the probability of a levee failure. **All six existed at the West Quincy levee site**, convincing him the levee was already vulnerable.  
Hammer said the conditions were so obvious that he showed six fellow soil scientists and geologists a map of the area, **and two of them correctly guessed the exact point of the levee failure. The other four were ""within 50 yards,""** Hammer claimed.

&#x200B;

>He was convicted by a jury, the ruling was thrown out because of procedural issues, a retrial occurred, and a 2nd jury also found him guilty.

The mistrial was caused by those witnesses you mentioned above. The prosecution didn't inform the defense of those witnesses.

In my opinion, it's because they knew they didn't have to. That was enough to convince the first jury, true or not. The second jury already knew about the case, and they didn't care much to reassess, evident by the three hour deliberation. Though that's my speculation."

James was one of hundeds of volunteers, and had been volunteering for several days before the levee broke.

>there are two reasons:  
>  
>“The whole region was destroyed and people were just raging,” he says. “If you go back and look at the Court TV footage, everyone—the lawyers, the judge, even Scott’s attorney—just looks miserable at being there. At the time of the second trial, Hannibal \[Missouri\] was flooded.”  
>  
>The other reason is the fact that the flood of 1993 was dubbed “The 500-year Flood,” a once-in-a-lifetime event. People in the region had grown too confident that a flood would never happen. “If you live in a federally designated floodplain, you’re required to have flood insurance,” says Pitluk. “The only way you can be made whole again is with insurance. And no one had it. But if the levee was sabotaged, that’s now an act of vandalism and not an act of God. So the $1 billion dollars paid out of insurance can be collected.”

I think that people were angry and mourning, and they couldn't bring themselves to believe that the government, city, or God had let such a catastrophe happen. So they didn't, and blamed James Scott instead. And the US government was fine with that."

>  
>Norman Haerr, chairman of the West Quincy Levee Drainage District **(who also worked for ACE)**, asserted that the levee was rock-solid. His testimony consisted of detailing the patrols and the amount of seepage going over the levee. The bulldozed area held the high water when the river was at 31.97 feet. When the water came rushing through, the level was 31.67 feet -- about 4 inches lower.

todayilearned,ff9jxnf,t3_esf5xg,1579714591.0,"I heard about this story on an episode of r/TheDollop. After further research, it is fairly obvious that this was a gross miscarriage of justice. A not-so TL;DR of events:

* James Scott commits petty crimes as a youth, including his most infamous crimes of arson
* James is released from prison in 1991
* Flooding begins in 1993. Hundreds of levees began failing
* The Army Core of Engineers uses bulldozers to build the West Quincy levee up. The levee, built to hold back 30 feet of water, was made to hold 32 feet. The water levels were at 31.9 feet
* July 12th: James volunteers on the levee in 1993 in ""efforts to better \[him\]self""
* July 16th: James and some others are working to duct tape holes in the plastic tarps along the northern levee
* James tells a national guard member, Duke Kelly, that he had seen water leaking from under the tarp. Kelly told James he would inspect the problem area (Kelly never did)
* The levee breaks just before James leaves
* A newscaster interviewed James about what he had seen
* Sargent Neil Baker saw James on the news, He had arrested James several times before, and was immediately suspicious. Later, Sargent Baker explained his reasoning:
   * James looked too clean for a man working on a levee all day
   * James wasn't wearing a life jacket
   * James' answers sounded ""squirrely""
   * He couldn't explain the events that had happened (although he did in the interview)
* Deputy Sheriff John McCoy also saw James on the news
   * McCoy immediately came to the same conclusion that James had broken the levee

**The Investigation Begins:**

* Sargent Baker interviewed James' neighbors. He claimed, without proof, that neighbors told him James had said such things as:
   * ""I'm going to break the levee""
   * ""Wouldn't it be cool to be there when the levee broke?""
* October 1st: Baker arrested James for burglary. He is taken in for questioning
   * It had already been determined that James had been working on the night of the burglary
* James is again questioned about the levee. James explained he had moved several sandbags from one area of the levee to a trouble spot. James told Baker he didn't mean to make it worse if that's what happened, he was just trying to help. ""I had no plans to hurt anything. They needed help, so I helped.""
* The moved sandbags explanation was taken as a confession by Baker
* James Scott was charged with ""causing a catastrophe""

**Lead-Up to the Trial:**

* The only evidence was the interrogation and the TV interview
* 16 year old Joe Flachs testified that James bragged about wanting to break the levee to strand his wife Suzie on the other side of the river. James , he said, wanted to drink and go fishing. James claimed the conversation did not happen.
   * James actually drove to pick up his wife the next day, having to take a five hour detour, traveling 10 hours out of his way.
* The defense asks the trial to be relocated, in part because of public sentiment, such as:
   * ""If you ask me, we should have the trial here locally. Know what we'd have do? We'd hang him from the Bayview bridge and let the birds get at him""
   * ""Just knowing James Scott over the years is enough to know he's guilty""
   * ""Maybe hang him from a tree and everybody go home for lunch""
* The trial was moved.

**The Trial Begins:**

* The prosecution made the case that James cut the plastic sheets covering the levee and then burrowed through the sand until the water rushed in. This would have in fact killed him.
* The Defense called Dr. Charles Morris, a civil engineer, who testified that the West Quincy levee would have failed without being sabotaged
* Dr. David Hammer, a soil scientist, also testified saying the same
* The ACE did not make their internal report available to the defense team. The report concluded that piping erosion was the cause of the failures.
* James was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. He is up for parol in 2023.

After that, I'd add a line to the tracking page you see above.

I definitely recommend it. I am a college student, so have to do a lot of writing. It'd be very useful for someone in such a position. And it's honestly kind of fun to see the progress I made.

Edit to add: The only thing I had to be mindful of is my writing posture. As a lefty, I am used to writing with the paper positioned sideways, or sometimes with a ""[left hook](https://youtu.be/BM1ghKNc6lM?t=107)"". So it is definitely a bit of a transition to the typical  posture of a right-handed writer."

This is the product of twenty ten-minute daily writing sessions over the course of a few weeks. On session number twenty, I started using a [roller-ball/fountain pen](https://www.amazon.com/Schneider-Cartridge-Rollerball-Barrel-187803/dp/B06XYQ1NPM) hybrid, which requires much less pressure and is easier to use. I am planning to continue practicing. I am able to write legibly with my non-dominant hand, but not quickly (yet!)."
