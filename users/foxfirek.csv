The place I did so at there was a cubby in the bathroom for the samples, often many samples are there. A place that would implement this kind of thing would probably have similar, and gendered bathrooms, snooping would mean going into the wrong bathroom or trying to figure out your partners cup vs others, and it’s quite possible the cubby will just open to a back room and never be on the customer floor. There are pretty easy ways to make this work."

If I don’t do laundry fast enough my husband will eventually take a hint and do it himself.

1) Is it a boy? point the penis down when you put on a diaper so when they pee its less likely to just escape out the top, also when you take off a diaper they sometimes pee because of the temp change, so be ready to cover them back up. 

2) When they are tiny you can fold the top of the diaper to avoid leakage if the diapers are too big

3) Wear your baby whenever you go out, babies love snuggling up to a warm body.

Parenting,fdcjtpd,t1_fdc4nl0,1578276676.0,"Every parent does something another parent thinks is wrong. It's very easy to be judgmental. Its best to try not to think too much about it. If you are worried you may be doing something wrong ask a pediatrician, do not ask forums, or mommy groups. in groups if someone is outspoken to the negative people who agree with you will often remain silent because they don't want to handle drama.

Examples of things parents do others think is wrong, and the opposite others also think is wrong:

Helicopter parenting, not watching their kids closely enough. Using formula, breastfeeding in public. Spoiling their kids, being too strict. Giving a kid sweets and juice, only feeding your kid ""health food."" Sleep training, Letting your kid sleep with you till 5. Potty training a kid too young, Not potty training young enough.

Parents often think their own way is best but it's not. The choices that are right for one kid are not right for another. The choices for one parent are not right for another. So long as your child is safe and loved and cared for thats what really matters, not our differences in parenting technique."

We bought a refrigerator and washer and dryer, so that ticks most of the “big purchases” even a nice washer and dryer are only $400 each. I think our fridge was 2k and that was on the higher end. A rental quality fridge would have been $800. Replacing our sewer lateral (one of the most expensive home repairs you can do) was 5k. New electrical 2k, including new panels), redoing most of the water and sewer lines in the house was like 3k. Replacing the flat roof (not the whole roof just like 1/3 that needed it) was 3k. So repairs and appliances. Most of those repairs will last 20 years, but so far that puts us at about 5k for repairs and appliances per year and that’s almost certainly on the very high side. 

People will spout out insane housing costs but partly you just need to not be taken advantage of, look at reviews for people before you hire them. One guy wanted 13k to do the sewer and he was doing a very hard sales pitch, so we asked a place that only does  sewers and they quoted 7k, and found a person on yelp that does then all the time with great reviews who did it for 5k.
