CasualConversation,fde3ikw,t3_ektdcn,1578330371.0,"1-3, 19 Is merely because they don't know enough about the situation, so all they have are vague generalities based on inaccurate info. They've not had any experience with people on the spectrum.

4 This is by no means universal, but just because a situation is unfamiliar, doesn't mean the way they navigate is unfamiliar. In other words, they are familiar with being in unfamiliar social situations, and apply the same base techniques to each situation.

5-6,16, 22 When the brain automates filtering of input, it's amazing how much freer the attention is for processing other information.

7/9 There are plenty of studies in behavioral science about this stage of social development and why it exists, makes for a good read.

8 Many NTs hate cigarette smoke as well, but can handle exposure to unpleasant stimuli better.

10 Vanity - as a society we value sex appeal, vitality, and youth. We are told by media that our worth is tied to how desirable we are to others. Doesn't mean that individuals feel this way or think that mindset is good or healthy. It's a societal rot.

11,14, 29 This is what happens when NTs don't know how to deal with a social situation. You are witnessing them having trouble with knowing what's expected or helpful.

12, 24, 26 There are entire disciplines devoted to studying culture's influence on us. It's by no means something that can be adequately explained in a Reddit comment.

13 One of the primary ways we as humans define the self is through gender. Think of the usual info ppl share first in chat: ASL. Age, sex, location. It's probably THE primary means of identifying what kind of person we are, where we fit into the world at large.

15,17, 19 There are certain levels of interaction for every relationship that are expected to communicate that you value the other person and care for them. It's not really based on the personal style of expression of affection of an individual, so there's wiggle room in this when you are an independent adult. When you're a child, the parent often models their expectations on their own personal style of expression.

18 Cultural expectations and familiarity

21 Honestly I think because the misguided people who tell people this don't want to think in depth about the circumstances in others' lives. They want a pleasant background in their world where people are essentially cardboard cutouts with no depth or problems of their own, serving only to decorate their background. I despise it when people say this to strangers. It's incredibly presumptuous.

23 Out of sensitivity, I'd guess, to the circumstances of others. People expect they'll be judged on how much money they make. They don't want to appear to be bragging, if they make a lot, and don't want to be looked down upon if they don't.

25 It's difficult to jump straight into topics. Think of small talk as breaking the ice, allowing each person to become accustomed to the conversation and person before topics of more personal sensitivity are broached.

27 Because either they themselves enjoy parenting and find it fulfilling, or because it's such a consuming undertaking that they can't envision what would fill up their lives if they didn't themselves have that aspect of life.

28 This one has to do with perception of others. You don't want others to perceive you as overly willing or eager to take advantage of others.

30 To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. They're trying to help but don't know how, or applying their own personal style and coping mechanisms to others when it doesn't necessarily apply. This reminds me of the book Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.  Men want to fix problems and sometimes it causes trouble when women talk about their problems to commiserate and vent and instead of listening, the men try to help by offering solutions. It's well intentioned, but not always what the other person needs.
Hope this helps!"
