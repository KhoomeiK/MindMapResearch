I agree. There are so many people here condemning or ridiculing the prof for leaving, but I bet the same people would be the ones saying ""well if you don't like your university's investments, why don't you leave and go somewhere else?"" in the other scenario."
canada,fehps8q,t1_feh8p3h,1579121442.0,">""Don't maximize return on investment""

It's increasingly turning out that the smart thing to do to maximize long-term return on investment is actually divestment from fossil fuels and investments in renewable energy. According to the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2016/mar/15/why-graduates-of-a-top-canadian-university-are-returning-our-diplomas), McGill actually lost $43 million in fossil fuel holdings in only a 2-3 year period, and that trend is continuing. Fossil fuels are a dying industry; with or without climate change awareness and activism that fact will remain true. 

Divestment is not an empty gesture either; it's been shown to have real effects in the social pressure it creates, whether from fossil fuels (as the UC system, Cal State, John Hopkins, Yale, Boston U, Cardiff, King's College, Leeds, London School of Economics, Oxford, Queens Cambridge, SOAS, Seattle, Stanford, UCL, Bath, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Wales, UOttawa, UBC, UQAM, Concordia, Laval, and many more universities have done), during apartheid, or elsewhere. Of course other companies will continue to invest in it, but in the end sends a clear message that neither the university nor its students want any part in funding the climate crisis.

>Not investing is a legal product that you continue to use

A huge percentage of McGill's carbon footprint is not actually in the use of fossil fuels but in investments in them. Besides the social pressure and financial *incentive* to divest, divestment would actually have a real benefit."

canada,fegn0im,t1_fegldaw,1579097651.0,"Here's the thing, people still have to participate in society and yes fossil fuels are part of that right now.
