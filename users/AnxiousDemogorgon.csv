toastme,ff2p08k,t3_er00f2,1579517193.0,"One month! That’s incredible. I remember your first post. I’m still so proud of you, I can’t stop smiling. With every minute, every hour you stay clean, you’re building a better life for yourself.  I know your getting drowned in comments about your beard and scar making you look badass, so I’ll say something else. You have very pretty, intense eyes."

aww,fef0rry,t1_fee8312,1579045486.0,I’m laying down and I have tears in my ear now. That’s so sweet and pure.
aww,fef0kvj,t3_eonffw,1579045359.0,"Oh my gosh.. congratulations. You look like a very happy family. You’ll have a lot of sleepless nights ahead, but it’ll be so worth it for you, and Joshua. I wish all three of you the best. Enjoy your life journey together."
religiousfruitcake,feezxtu,t1_fe8gbm7,1579044940.0,"Sorry I just saw this, I don’t get notifications on this account! No, since it’s legally binding only between the two and not the whole, divorces should just be the two involved.  If they were married to others legally, those marriages would remain unless divorce was filed for those as well. And hey don’t apologize man, talking about it is great! That’s how we figure things out."
MadeMeSmile,fed20d6,t3_eobm9r,1578994736.0,"Congratulations! That is So Much weight. I’m really proud of both of you, and I wish you a lifetime of happiness together."
aww,fe638gn,t1_fe5y8kl,1578880781.0,"Two of my cats enjoy car rides as well, in or out of a crate. The third one doesn’t enjoy them per say, but she’s relaxed enough that it’s not a problem. She just finds a spot, preferably the back window or under a seat, and hunkers down to wait it out. It’s really nice. Three angry cats and a crying dog would be nightmarish."
religiousfruitcake,fe5vn2z,t1_fe3vtwl,1578875959.0,"My thoughts on the matter would be

1. Kind of similar to now, marriage only links the ones getting married. Other spouses are more regarded as siblings legally, unless they go through the process of actually marrying each other.

2. Yeah, have current spouse(s) sign documents that state yes, this is coo. Otherwise one could just go marry someone else, dump everything into their new spouses name legally and then leave the current one. Lotta grey there.

3. Have one or two spouses that are designated as the person who dictates what happens in an emergency. How that person is decided should be left to the spouses and partner.

These are just my thoughts on the matter though, if you have other thoughts feel free to share, or not. Have a great day!"
