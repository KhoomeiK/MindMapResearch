depression,fehnv7a,t3_eoxun3,1579120337.0,"The familiarity of how you feel and what you’re experiencing currently (and have felt/experienced in the past) can be comforting. Change is also scary. I hear you, completely.

It’s okay to feel low. It’s a matter of whether or not it’s impacting your ability to function. I know for me, when I have experienced significant change (i.e. a breakup) my anxiety and depression is exacerbated to the point where personal and home tasks like showering, cooking, and dishes basically go out the window. If that is something you’re experiencing, it might be worthwhile to touch base with a doctor, call a support line, or seek counselling/treatment."
SuicideWatch,fecoyhx,t1_fecoci9,1578979527.0,"I understand your frustration and I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. I know lots of people who have it going for them and they use an inhaler daily. Some things can be a struggle, certainly, but the inhaler helps a great deal.

It’s okay to need medicine. And it’s okay to not feel happy about your body needing it. I take medicine everyday, too. I’m not always excited to take it, but I know that it helps me live my life. I accept that it is something useful for me and try my best to not be so hard on myself.

I hope you feel a little bit better about it soon. Could you speak to a doctor about it? Perhaps they have some insight and/or could connect you with a counsellor to discuss how you’re feeling."
SuicideWatch,fecokc0,t3_eog9ns,1578979199.0,"Hey, I’m really sorry all of this has happened to you. It hurts my heart to learn you have gone through all this. It’s not your fault and you aren’t alone.

When you were in counselling, did you find it helped? I have been in counselling, too, and found that talking about the past was helpful. Learning about how the past impacts me and learning new ways to cope and build a life worth living has helped me heal. I’m still learning and working on it— perhaps it will be a lifelong journey. I take things day by day and do my best to take care of myself. 

I hope you are able to connect with a professional and feel better soon. I’m rooting for you, truly. And here to chat a bit more if you’d like/if it might help."
SuicideWatch,fecnunt,t3_eogaw9,1578978625.0,"Hey I’m sorry you’re going through that. Do you live with your brother/does he smoke in the house? Maybe you or someone else could ask him to smoke outside.

I have asthma, too. And anxiety. It’s difficult to regulate my breathing sometimes, and smoke definitely triggers it, so I feel you. Lots of people use inhalers though, and thank goodness for them.

I hope things get better. You’re not alone."
SuicideWatch,fecnmf1,t3_eogd3r,1578978449.0,"Hey I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Thank you for sharing.

It sounds like a really difficult situation. Is there any way you could seek counselling? Maybe someone could meet with you and come up with some coping strategies and plans to feel better/potentially set yourself up to be in a better spot. I’ve found counselling useful in the past.

Are you safe right now at home? You mention your family speaking to your abuser: I’m sorry that’s happening.

It’s okay that you don’t know when the relief will come— you might have glimpses of it here and there on your healing journey. I encourage you to take things one day at a time. Self care and do the things you can do, and ask for help when needed. No shame in it.

I’m rooting for you."
depression,fdyq25e,t3_en7336,1578782438.0,Depression is familiar and comfortable. Change is scary. It’s real and valid to cling onto what you’re used to. But change could be good. I’m rooting for you.

SuicideWatch,fdxv51x,t3_en44vp,1578773233.0,"I’m so sorry you’re feeling like that. Life can be so difficult and heavy. Sometimes, we just have to do our best and survive, and find even a little bit of joy in small things. That looks different for everyone. On a bad day, I’m grateful for a glass of water and a bed to nap in. On better days, maybe the things that bring me joy are friends or video games. 

Taking care of the “smaller” stuff can help you to build a life where you might feel a bit better.

I hope therapy goes well. Hang on 💛 I’m rooting for you."
SuicideWatch,fdu4t9q,t3_en3tkh,1578727562.0,"Hey, thank you so much for sharing and reaching out. I’m listening.

Something that really stood out to me was your passion and care for others. Maybe that can manifest in things like volunteering, if you’re able and willing. Even a few times a month. It could be a fulfilling duty for you and maybe help you build mastery and build a life where you feel you feel content, like you describe you want. These steps can be scary, and so meaningful. And if you don’t like something, you can change it. You can decide to go somewhere else or do something else.

Another really insightful thing you mention is that you feel like a teenager. Sometimes, when we don’t feel our age (so to speak) it points to a time when maybe we were feeling anxious or low and we feel it again. It’s our inner child, sometimes. This is something I have been working through in therapy and on my own healing journey through reading self help books. 

Life can be so hard sometimes. I genuinely hope things get better for you!"
SuicideWatch,fdu47p8,t3_en3tm5,1578727242.0,"Hey, thank you for reaching out and sharing a bit about what you’re going through. It sounds really overwhelming, I’m sorry to hear it.

Something that has helped me when it feels like things are piling up, one after another, is to break the tasks down and to ask for help. A friend of mine brought me to the doctor today so we could touch base about my anxiety and depression treatment (among other diagnoses including CPTSD). I don’t know exactly what you’re going through but I can relate and understand some of it

It sounds like you’re doing your best. Try to be gentle with yourself; you are going through a lot!

First things first... take care of you. Even “little things” like having a glass of water or doing some self care (whatever that may look like for you, so long as it’s safe and soothing) can make a difference. It won’t solve everything, of course. But it will put you in a bit of a better position to manage some of the other things going on.

I genuinely hope things get better for you. One thing at a time."

Sometimes, we say things out of anger or other strong feelings. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot. I think taking one step to talk things out— even if it’s here, right now— that is great and brave.

Is there a support line you could call? Maybe they could give you a bit more support, lend an ear, and suggest local resources. I’ve called a support line/crisis line before and been helped. It’s good to have someone to talk to. There’s text services, too. Depending on what you’re comfortable with.

Some longer term support could be helpful, if you’re up for it. I genuinely hope things get better for you.

Moment by moment. Is there anything you can do, right now, to take care of yourself? Even if it’s something “small” like having a glass of water. Sometimes self care can make a difference."

If a friend isn't someone you can go to, that is ok. I think maybe speaking with your husband about your serious, very real feelings and thoughts could be helpful, so long as you feel comfortable and think he could support you through that. It might also be helpful to connect with a professional. I've called a support hotline before and it felt really good to talk to someone and get some resources set up (i.e. for me, it was counselling to start, seeing a psychiatrist, etc.)

You mention removing obstacles... are there things you can do to self soothe and heal instead? Things like taking care of yourself. I know it is so painful and difficult. But it could help you gain a bit of control.

Are you safe right now? Do you think touching base with a support hotline or maybe a psychiatrist could help? I know you said you lack the trust, I just wonder if maybe they could help."

You mention hurting and failing your wife... can you tell me a bit more about what you mean by that? I just want to understand.

It was hurtful and really hurt my self esteem. I felt so sad and alone. Some things I did that helped were:
- focused on taking care of myself. - did things like painted my nails, make my hair look and smell nice, rearranged my bedroom, wrote in a journal, drawing, took photos/got into photography, played guitar... anything to feel good
- got lost in the fictional stories of books and lived through those beautiful stories by reading
- read magazines and watched YouTube videos that made me feel good, laugh, and showed me how to care for myself
- joined clubs in school like drama and student council! I made friends there. I met people who liked the same things as me and were interested in the same things.
- I watched showed (and still watch shows) about people who struggled like me. Have you ever watched Glee? It changed my life.

I am overcoming so much, each day. I still struggle with my confidence. I have days where I feel down. In those moments, I call a friend, have a long shower, call a support line, take a nap. Whatever is healthy and safe in that moment... I do it.

What do you like to do? What are you into? Maybe joining a school club or trying a new hobby could be enjoyable."

I decided it was important to have a professional to talk to, so I chose that. My therapist now isn't perfect, but she listens, provides perspective, and respects me. We all deserve that in a therapist and I hope you find that soon. 

I'm not sure where you live or what your school is like but I do know counselling is often available, whether its through your school specifically of through community resources your school is connected with. I really encourage you to reach out to your student affairs department and see what might be available. If you don't know, you could check your school website for student services or speak to a teacher.

I accessed counselling when I was in university and it really helped me get through some hard, painful times. We came up with some ways for me to cope when I felt overwhelmed and discussed how to make it through hard times. It sounds like maybe that could help you, too.

I've felt like a burden in the past, too. But I realized that there's always at least one person who cares and doesn't feel burdened: like me, right here, right now. 

What about the last few days has made you feel like a burden? Has someone told you that you are? 

I want to help and understand a little bit better. I'm here."
SuicideWatch,fdoqwn7,t1_fdoq3p4,1578610883.0,"I'm sorry to hear that. Work can be a big part of our lives and when it's difficult or stressful, it can really impact our wellbeing. What kind of work do you do? And what about it isn't working for you?"
SuicideWatch,fdoq7vs,t3_emhhie,1578610405.0,"Friendships are so important, it sounds like you really value connection. Meeting new people and building relationships can be so tough. Can you tell me a little bit more about the people you do have in your life?"
SuicideWatch,fdoq1w2,t3_emhasi,1578610303.0,"It worries me to know you are feeling so bad about yourself. I wish I could help you feel better.

Can you tell me a bit more about what you're going through that has you feeling like this?"
SuicideWatch,fdopue9,t1_fdop9bk,1578610176.0,"Life can often feel like a lot; it sounds like you are really struggling.

You mentioned work... Is your job part of why you are feeling this way? Work stress can definitely add to struggle, immensely."
SuicideWatch,fdop71b,t3_emh3tw,1578609783.0,"Hey, I am really sorry you are feeling this way. You are not alone and we can chat. Do you want to share a little bit more about what's been going on?"
SuicideWatch,fdop0vf,t1_fdoofc2,1578609681.0,"I get that. Talking about everything all over again and filling a new therapist in on the important parts and experiences of your life can be difficult and re-traumatizing. But if going through the important stuff in your own time and when you're ready to share means potentially getting some effective talk therapy, I'd say it's a win.

You only have to share as much or as little is relevant. 

And, further to that, perhaps if your current therapist has other therapists in their practice, with your permission maybe they could share some of their notes with another therapist? I know I've had it where I've asked that some things be shared to provide another therapist with some context. It could be an option."
SuicideWatch,fdooqa9,t1_fdoo51x,1578609502.0,"I think it is so courageous of you to push through, even when it's so painful and difficult. I can tell you are a fighter. I admire you and your courage.

Something that has helped me is doing a bit of research about things that can help me when I'm in a rough patch. Everyone is different and it takes some trial and error... I'm curious: what works for you? What do you do, tangibly, to push through when you're struggling? What works? :)"
SuicideWatch,fdoogxo,t1_fdonsw4,1578609345.0,"Thank you for being here. And for your bold, brave words. I am so proud of you to keep fighting. You are absolutely right-- you/we are not alone.

it doesn't make the painful stuff go away, but it can help to reach out and take care of ourselves. 

I admire your strength."
SuicideWatch,fdoo3ik,t1_fdonl4t,1578609118.0,"That sounds like a frustrating, invalidating situation. I am sorry to hear you're going through that. Is there any way that you can connect with a new therapist? there is absolutely nothing wrong with switching therapists when the fit isn't right."
SuicideWatch,fdonqx2,t1_fdon9tu,1578608907.0,"That sounds unbelievably exhausting. I don't know exactly what you're going through, but the cycle you describe sounds like something I've experienced.

When you're in that spot where you think ""I am going to get better"" and you try, what are some things that help?"
SuicideWatch,fdonj36,t3_emgwe0,1578608777.0,"Hey I am really sorry to hear you're going through all of this. What you're feeling is valid.

People who are naive and don't understand mental illness say ridiculous, hurtful things like the things you mentioned. But your feelings are real and they matter.

I won't repeat any of the things other people have told you about things getting better or anything like that. It could get better, if you give it a chance. Sometimes, that looks like living moment to moment. Making your life as comfortable as you can. Asking for help when you're struggling- like right now. I am really proud of you for reaching out and I am here to chat if you want.

The world can definitely be very frustrating, and so can life. Can you tell me a bit more about what's going on? Maybe talking a bit more could help a bit."
SuicideWatch,fdon0k4,t3_emg0vk,1578608465.0,"Hey, I am so sorry you are going through this. It's a lot at once. You are so unbelivably strong for going through it, day after day. Even when it might not always feel like strength.

It worries me when you say that you don't see a point in going on.

How can I help? And what do you think would be comforting, right now, in this moment?"
SuicideWatch,fdomnqn,t3_emg4nt,1578608257.0,"Hey, I am so sorry you're going through this. You are not alone. I am here and ready to talk. 

Journaling can be so therapeutic. It's so good you're trying to see what helps. Instrusive thoughts can be scary.

It makes me sad to read that you're going to yell at yourself tomorrow. We can be our own harshest critics. May I suggest trying to be gentler with yourself? I know it's hard. But we all make mistakes and sometimes we don't take the best care of ourselves. But getting angry doesn't fox anything."
SuicideWatch,fdom6pz,t3_emgtgc,1578607972.0,"Everyone's threshold for pain and suffering is different. It all depends on how we cope with the now. It sounds like you're really struggling, and I'm sorry to hear that.

Can you tell me a little bit more about how you've been feeling/what thoughts you've been thinking?"
SuicideWatch,fdolqac,t3_emeeer,1578607702.0,"Sometimes temporary is okay. Sometimes, we just have to do the things that get us from one moment to the next. It doesn't always feel like it's enough, I hear you.

It's frustrating when the things we are told are gonna ""work"" don't work. Or when they do work but it's only temporary. Recovery and healing can be a lifelong process. It can be tiring. It can also be worthwhile.

Let's talk."
SuicideWatch,fdol9rw,t3_em5lnw,1578607429.0,"Is there a teacher or guidance counselor at school that you trust? Maybe speaking with someone at school could help-- maybe they could set you up with some accommodations, extensions, later-date to write, etc."
SuicideWatch,fdol3ru,t3_em5lnw,1578607329.0,"I hope your therapist gets back to you soon, too. I am so proud of you for reaching out to them."
SuicideWatch,fdoky6c,t3_emb9kl,1578607237.0,"I am so sorry you're going through this. Thank you for sharing. 

What do you need right now? To vent? Some advice? I am happy to talk with you."
SuicideWatch,famwiam,t1_faj9x5h,1576214982.0,"That sounds incredibly difficult. I am so sorry you are going through that. What do you think might happen if you tried, even something small, to enact some change? It could be negative or positive... I just wonder if maybe you'd want to flesh out the possibilities together.

Vulnerability is so tough. it sounds like you are really craving some change. That can take a bit of change yourself... changing your space, your routine, your approach to certain things... opening yourself up to new options and possibilities is so scary, but it can be meaningful (and feel good). 

Lonliness is totally normal and valid. It sucks and is tough. You aren't alone in that feeling and experience. What are some things that have helped you in the past that make you feel a little less lonely? Could you try some of those?

Sometimes, if I am feeling lonely but don't want to go out or see anyone face to face, I'll watch YouTube videos (especially by creators who really engage their viewers with stories, shared experiences, etc.), I'll hop on message boards/forums and connect with people online (like Reddit or Discord), I'll play online video games (even if I don't chat/speak), or I'll even stream on Twitch if I feel like it. 

You have options. I am rooting for you. Life can be so tough. 

Let's chat more here if you're up for it."
