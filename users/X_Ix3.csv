amiugly,fe2v1jw,t3_enolmm,1578843154.0,your nose is big but you're not an ugly guy in my honest opinion. try a hairstyle where the sides are short and the top is long.

introvert,fd8tar7,t1_fd8sa35,1578223165.0,"Apparently blunt means being straightforward and not sugarcoating, someone who appeciates honesty. I don't really see how this can affect you flirting with women lmao.

What I meant was I need to be in a certain mood to flirt/sugar talk, which I thought was quite obvious. If I'm tired, angry, or something else that messes with my thought process, I'm not going to flirt."
introvert,fd8rpo3,t1_fd6xjhm,1578222453.0,"Thank you, that's good advice."
introvert,fd8rmqs,t1_fd7fc34,1578222414.0,"When I talk I run out of topics or everyone else keeps talking so I shut down.

You have to get into the mood so you can sweet talk. I don't really know how you can achieve that."

i was also talking with a 19-year-old girl and she told me she was buying rope. i didn't think much of it but she hasn't responded to my texts or posted/commented anything for 6 days. i'm worried she actually killed herself and i could have prevented it. i've been texting her every day, i hope she responds eventually"
