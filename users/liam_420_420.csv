So this dudes expecting like 300-400$. Thats what pushed it over the line was when he said 20$ per game as if that was low for what he had in his head. Idk why he even bothered asking us he should have just took it to EB games where they would gave him probably 2$ for all 14 game and maybe 20$ for console and I'd say 1$ per controller."
apexlegends,fer782c,t1_feqkf5f,1579350660.0,Ahh there it is your ways the best way the only way to play is the meta. Because I like the g7 more it's far better gun. Funny how they buffed it so ppl would use it and the only thing they would do is take away the double tap. I can almost guarantee you don't touch the g7 unless you have the double tap. Also while everyone is talking about things that actually need to be fixed with the game your here bitching about the g7 a gun which is no where near as op as you wanna claim. Easy charge rifle needed its nerfs because it was a 100% accurate hit scan weapon and disrupter rounds they were op they needed to go they legitly changed how the game was played big time. It made it so that if you didn't have them and they did you were at a massive disadvantage unlike the g7 also using predator gameplay to represent the majority of the player bases skill level and accuracy is idiotic at best. That's what's considered when making weapon balance not how well the top tier players use them. I mean I can keep going if you want but I say let's talk about the real problems now.
gaming,fer4yzj,t1_feqvsdp,1579349895.0,True been stressful lately and it was the last straw for me. Ive always hated ppl that act like he does. Asks for opinions and then argues why theirs is wrong and his is right.

FuckYouKaren,feq1ikx,t3_eqadt2,1579336105.0,Dude in his state that's THE FUCKING LAW end of story he's complaining about a company litterly breaking the law. That's in now way Karen's behaviour. You just look at the pics didn't you.
FuckYouKaren,feq0xdi,t3_eqbr96,1579335794.0,You should called the cops dude that's assault and destruction of property if she made that hole. Now she thinks she can keep doing since you didn't get her in real trouble. One thing I learned police are pretty good at dealing with Karen's
gaming,fepx4gx,t1_fep5drw,1579333938.0,"Which one I tried multiple and he refuses to listen to anyone so why should I be nice to an entitled pick who think custom ps3 controllers matters or that they think they can get 20$ a game so please tell me how the first comment I made was anyway sound like an ass cuz I'm pretty sure I told him the truth not some sugar coated b's you seem to wanna give him

My first comment to the guy before pretty much everyone else. 

Just console I wouldn't pay more than 75$ and that's pushing it. Controllers dont matter maybe add 5$ per controller or they will tell you to keep it and go get a brand new one for maybe 10$ depending on games maybe an extra 20$ at most since most of those games you'll get in bargain bins so all the stuff you put max 100$ bucks but I would offer ya 75$ first.

Please point out where I was an ass hole in my first comment? I'll be waiting. 

Oh this is gonna be comical let's see what your ass has to say about it now that you were proven wrong also the dudes fucking delusional he's got it in his head that he's getting more than 200$ for his 10 year old shit console. And he won't listen to truth so I've giving up on babying full grown adults because Thier feelings might get hurt. He's an adult who asked for advice was given given good advice from multiple ppl and argued all of them. So this means he already knows how much he's selling his garbage ass ps3 for and just wanted validation for his priceing.

The dude expected to get 20$ per fucking game for ps3 games. So please tell me how this idiot was gonna listen to anything anyone says."

gaming,feor83a,t1_fenrpuu,1579304338.0,100$ tops too old most games servers are shut down its pretty much a split screener now.
gaming,feoqxj9,t1_feoinu8,1579304251.0,Don't bother this dude won't listen and he will argue it's worth more. I gave a generous estimate at a max of 100$ and I said that's even really stretching it. He thinks cuz his controllers are custom it matters some how.
gaming,feoqqb4,t1_feoodei,1579304131.0,Omg your absolutely delusional if you think your getting more than 100$ ppl don't give a shit if the controllers are custom that was your choice honestly you better watch yourself before you end up on the choosing beggers sub. Like you asked ppl what's its worth and we tell you then you argue about it clearly you already know what your selling it for and I can promise no one will buy your fucking garbage ps3 for more than 100$. everything included I can walk down the street and buy 3 ps3 systems for 100$ rn. Your pile of garbage ain't worth shit. Especially since you gave no details about games only thing was oh look my controllers are custom like that fucking matters. Fuck outta here with your dumbass. Everyone that commented has actual experience selling their old shit clearly you have none.
apexlegends,feoppba,t1_fentaxp,1579303626.0,Didn't say anything about the main point of my comment there bud. I think you avoided it because your not good with the longbow or you don't trust yourself to hit shots so you need to have fast follow up rounds. Let me guess when the charge rifle dropped you had one every game didn't you.
gaming,feookaa,t1_feojtkp,1579303110.0,Yup it's worthless prett much unless it's limited edition. Fuck I remember trying to take my Xbox in when the 360 came out and it wasn't worth it I even had the fucking DVD attachment for it with remote and I still haven't seen anyone else with it or at least with the remote and infrared sensor that plugs into a controller slot. Your better off keeping your old games and consoles they will be worth alot more later in life when they become rare and considered an artifact by the current generation of gamers

Man your fucking retarded as I said before your way or no way right.
apexlegends,feltfxs,t1_felskjg,1579230503.0,Man it's gotta be your way or no way huh and you know what he ment by this isn't fortnite.

But you do realize that the picture is of just the laptop so I still doubt you found it there like I said earlier I say you put it there and came up with a line for it either way how you phrased it does not work now if you made it about the simple facts it's on a drinking fountain you would have done better.
apexlegends,fekm7mi,t1_fekj16z,1579202959.0,THAN STAY WITH YOUR TEAM!! Stop running out in front trying to make them follow you try following them if your good than you would know to stay near the weakest link. You sound like a solo player you said word for word what one guy in my group says all the time. It's always the teammates fault never his. If your taking off and leaving two randoms who might be in a party behind to try and catch up they probably say fuck you. Like this game you can't go acting like some hot shit lone wolf excepting your teammates you follow you especially if you qued solo they are probably in a party which means YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THEM. Ffs this shits getting old whenever solo players lose its always the teammates fault never theirs.
