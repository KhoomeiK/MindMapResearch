StarWars,ff9uenv,t1_ff9cdyl,1579721574.0,Iirc from the Ahsoka book she's supposed to have a single green saber in Mandalore. So there seems to be a continuity error there as she has both of them blue in the trailer.
PrequelMemes,ff8kvi5,t1_ff8knrh,1579683390.0,You shouldn't hold out hope for that. Ever since the legends purge in 2014 they haven't made a single retcon to the canon material. They also made it so that Palpatine was talking to Kylo that night so the darkness Luke felt was more than likely that and not really Kylo. They've been going out of their way to redeem Kylo as much as possible and insert Palpatine everywhere...as if no one else could do bad in the galaxy except him.
PrequelMemes,ff8ka3m,t1_ff8k85h,1579682504.0,"It's in one of the recent canon comics. I don't like how they're making it so that Palpatine is basically the only evil in the galaxy.

PrequelMemes,ff8jcyd,t1_ff87alh,1579681188.0,"I'm mad that from what I have read they changed it so that Kylo wasn't the one who destroyed the jedi temple. They made it so it was really Palpatine from that planet far away sending a lightning storm...like, why?"
dndnext,ff58a53,t1_ff576mw,1579583175.0,"Jabba just laughs because many jedi and sith have tried to use it on him through the years and it has mever worked. He still didn't feel anything, he just knows about it and he also literally saw Luke use it on his assistant a moment before trying it on him. In all forms of media that are canon no one feels anything about the mind trick and iirc barely anyone even remembers what they did during the mind trick (as read on the canon supplement ""The Secrets of the Jedi"") that was released relatively recently. On SW canon no one feels the attempt at a mind trick, they just see the hand movement and if they know what that means then they know what was attempted on them with one exception.


The one exception being when three jedi attempted to use the mind trick on bounty hunter Cad Bane after they couldn't get the information they desired out of him (The Clone Wars S02 E03). First Anakin tries to mind trick him and with no reaction at all he just tells him that what he's trying won't work. Only when three of them all try at the same time does he have a physical reaction towards it and it's one of pain (the scene is portrayed in a way to let you see that the jedi have basically fallen and aren't what they're meant to be anymore. They almost crossed a line to the dark side on said scene and Ahsoka recognizes it). Other than this one scene, no one else feels the attempts of a mind a trick, whether they succeed or fail in any of the canon media out there."
dndnext,ff56kdj,t1_ff4zbwp,1579581678.0,"That's only because those characters already know what the jedi was trying to do, not because they felt anything at all. Watto doesn't feel Qui-Gon try to mind trick him, he just says ""What, you think you're some kind of Jedi, waving your hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks won't work on me; only money."". The choice of words is important as it lets us know that Watto doesn't think Qui-Gon is a jedi but in case he is he informs him that it wouldn't work anyway. There is no indication that he felt anything at all because otherwise he would have used ""don't"" instead of ""won't"", as well as accusing Qui-Gon of trying to pass for a jedi which implies he isn't one. 


This us both supported by the movies, series and even the short story about the Stormtrooper being mind controlled by Old Ben in ep4. The short story can be found in the book ""From a Certain Point of View"". 


Tldr; in SW people know about the mind trick not because they felt it but because they know about the hand movement and effect."

I think that the people with insane lvls are just playing a few heroes or units during exp events like I did.
StarWarsBattlefront,fepze9z,t3_eqbeo3,1579335216.0,Isn't Palpatine like extremely bad in HvV? Basically a free win for the light side considering how many force pushes they have and he can do absolutely nothing about it.

StarWarsBattlefront,fe08l3z,t1_fe07slt,1578806030.0,"In CS I wish I were talking about 1v1 but a single lightsaber hero can wipe an entire group on their own. What I see in CS is Anakin, Yoda and Obi running around and if they see a group then they push them for an instant kill then keep running and jumping. The darkside heroes seem to be easier to manage too, so imo it's only a problem with the lightside."
StarWarsBattlefront,fe07kmk,t3_en7z4r,1578805170.0,"I got the Celebration Edition as it was discounted and though I'm far from being great it just seems like there's no point in picking anything with your points except heroes when available. Heroes here are extremely overpowered and there's no point in even trying to kill them as they just spawn back up immediately. I've been loving most of the features of the game with the exception of heroes, it seems like they put no thought to their balance in GA and CS. Really wishing that they had an internal cooldown after death because CS right now from what I can tell is just heroes going to a command post, using push/pull and then going to another one. This is on console btw, might be easier to deal with them in PC."
PrequelMemes,fdzjjkv,t3_enamay,1578790836.0,"I wonder how they will do this. After the fall of the Empire, Jar Jar is in Naboo living in exile again because the Gungans and the humans of Naboo blame him for being the one that set Palpatine's rise in AotC. There the only people that get along with him are little kids that don't know what happened. The book does poke a little fun at theory of him being a sith as he takes one of the kids as his apprentice to make the galaxy smile (Jar Jar has become a sort of clown for kids)."

wholesomememes,fdmsopl,t1_fdms5qi,1578563856.0,"They can be that without having to ride the back of an established character. Anything otherwise is lack of faith on said character. A well written new character will sell just as good, just look at John Wick in recent times. People in Hollywood don't have that same level of trust when it comes to women. 


We will have to agree to disagree because I will never see it any other way. Writers don't go changing well established female roles into male. They only do this when it comes to women and only with very famous male roles. There's nothing that will make this seem anything else except writers not thinking that a woman can sell unless it's taking the role of a male character. We need more Ellen Ripley, Sarah Connor, Lara Croft, Black Widow and Atomic Blonde and less Ghostbusters but now all women."
wholesomememes,fdms6wy,t1_fdmjaq1,1578563149.0,"I'm an elementary school teacher and even kids in Kindergarten will tell each other that certain things are for girls or boys. I've even had to correct in class that purple isn't a gendered color (that no color is gendered even). Kids will generally not accept this without near tangible examples. So if they say that purple or pink are colors for girls, I wear a shirt of that color the mext day to prove that color doesn't have a gender. Kids are like that sometimes so I believe that some kid could say that Star Wars is for boys."
wholesomememes,fdms125,t1_fdmr5ka,1578562921.0,"I think writers should stay away from making female characters that just take the spot of a well established male character (like if they make James Bond a woman). That's just a different form of misogyny as the writer is basically saying and thinking that a woman can't succeed on her own unless she's put on a spot carved by men for years. I hate that, it's insulting to women and shouldn't be as accepted as it is right now. 


In the same thought, writers should never make a male character take the spot of a well established female character. Imagine if someone decided to change Ellen Ripley, Sarah Connor, Princess Leia, Lara Croft, Samus Aran or even Charlie's Angels into men. It would be equally wrong imo. Writers should write people first and worry about genders later, no need to take well established characters and change them into the opposite gender just because the writers don't trust that a woman can shine on her own unless she supplants a male character."

dankchristianmemes,fdb1416,t3_ekexhy,1578252542.0,"I stopped noticing that sub because it's no longer about atheism, rather it's now about antitheism.

People here posting about how there are some hating atheists, I personally haven't seen that at all here. What I have seen is the same as anywhere else on reddit, people hating on hate subs and that's what r/atheism is now. It is no longer the place of discussion and theological arguments that it used to be, now it might as well change its name to r/antitheism because they no longer represent what atheism is about."
wholesomememes,fd8y8du,t1_fd8a910,1578225263.0,He was already around 8-10 years during The Clone Wars. We don't know at what point in The Clone Wars he was rescued so let's count the time since the end to where the series is. From Ep3 to Ep4 we have 20 years and then one to three years between each movie iirc. The series takes place sometime after Ep6 but before the battle of Jakku (since the Empire basically banished after that into the Unknown Regions). This all means that at minimum Mando has between 33-35 years. Not that farfetched that he could be in his 40s if the he was found a bit older than what I think.

While it wasn't mentioned in the previous two sequel movies, this one made it so that Kylo and Rey are basically the new embodiments of the force, like the ones from the show were (though less powerful than the ones in the show). Also, force resurrection was done by The Daughter iirc, she revived Ahsoka at the cost of what little life she had left.
