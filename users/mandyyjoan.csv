I would recommend not trying an hard drugs, you aren‚Äôt missing out. Be proud you went 36 years without anything.
We were told that anything that alters your mind isn‚Äôt good. Now some may argue coke is worse than cannabis but for me using both got me high, altered my mind and thinking, and was an easy escape for how i was feeling. You think by using drugs nothing could go wrong but sometimes you can‚Äôt even see it. Cannabis has honestly helped me so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as bad as the harder drugs. Just be safe yeah?"

I was addicted to Klonopin for the last 7 years. I have had bad anxiety my whole life and when I was 17 I was prescribed it to help w my symptoms. As the years went on I struggled w my addiction and substance abuse to alcohol, cocaine, and opiates. I wanted to become numb to everything. I didn‚Äôt want to feel.
I would definitely recommend talking to someone about your feelings. If you have mental health issues seek proper care. If you need medication talk to your doctor about non narcotic options. See if there is any family history of addiction if so don‚Äôt use. Drugs don‚Äôt make you look cool so don‚Äôt do it. It will ruin your life. No matter what you say you will never control it bc it will take control of you. When you hit rock bottom bc you will go to treatment. Go to rehab. Go to the hospital. Detox safely you can die from alcohol and benzo withdrawals. Don‚Äôt be afraid to seek help. You will be so glad you did."

This continued until I was 21. Throughout these years I become very sick, been the ER, was hospitalized alot, went inpatient many times, been to residential treatment, seen so many doctors, tried so many medications, got hooked on benzos, relapsed after months of getting better, I actually starting smoking weed to gain weight and an appetite after I gained 20lbs I stopped and I was able to find a good mixture of meds and drs and on my 21st bday I was in recovery and haven‚Äôt relapsed since.
