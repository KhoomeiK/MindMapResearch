AmItheAsshole,ff9cl1o,t1_ff8ub60,1579709949.0,Oh wow! I never even thought of that. But you are correct! Damn!
AmItheAsshole,ff9ce5z,t1_ff92c21,1579709803.0,"Who is arguing? I was giving me opinion,  just like you were."
AmItheAsshole,ff923f3,t1_ff8x2z8,1579702939.0,"If it truly had value to him,  he wouldn't have given it to her. He used it as a way to get her to contact him, so he could continue to abuse her. He doesn't deserve to have his feelings considered once he hit her."
AmItheAsshole,ff8rvxj,t3_esaqsf,1579693648.0,"Nta- I could see her being upset if it had been a 9 year relationship but 9 months?!? She is overreacting. My advise would be to stand with what you said. There are women ie your mother or aunt who should still mean a great deal to you. Even though you have met this great new woman, that doesn't erase your past with your family and shouldn't."
AmItheAsshole,ff819ar,t1_ff80rfz,1579663352.0,I would agree if they had put gluten in food. No real harm done.
MadeMeSmile,ff6uxyg,t3_erytag,1579635407.0,That is so sweet!!!
AmItheAsshole,ff6si2r,t1_ff6rze3,1579633962.0,"Anal has absolutely nothing to do with your birth control. His reaction is serious cause for concern. It sounds like he is using the birth control as an excuse to be upset when he is upset about something completely different. I would really watch this relationship, there are some serious red flags here!"
nevertellmetheodds,ff5t8ps,t1_ff5lny5,1579609377.0,Happy cake day!
PublicFreakout,ff5rhrs,t1_ff5pgun,1579607391.0,Agreed 100%
AmItheAsshole,ff4ihqi,t3_erlqlm,1579564417.0,NTA but your family is horrible!!! God forbid you do as you were told! Tell then to shove their  tsk tsk  up their ass!
single,ff3hid4,t1_ff2qx64,1579541149.0,Agreed. As a women that is a great tip. Also if you are looking for anything and I mean anything other than getting blocked. Dont ask for pics immediately. Biggest turn off there is.

bipolar,ff2o84h,t3_erbgxo,1579515993.0,If you were somewhere the first few days of withdraw. You are likely okay. I used to watch my mom go through withdraw every week. I watched it completely eat her brain up.
MadeMeSmile,feykx8m,t3_eqvm3w,1579446948.0,That's awesome!!!
insaneparents,feyi1rf,t1_fexw5w3,1579445855.0,Most women do. It's no big deal.

AmItheAsshole,fep1tax,t3_eq9ni3,1579310236.0,NTA- you are completely right. She doesn't want any more kids. However.....she is hormonal.  Give her a little bit to cool down. And feed her. That always helps.
AmItheAsshole,femjgrd,t1_femg755,1579258707.0,Right! Me too
AmItheAsshole,femj6fd,t1_fem8p37,1579258290.0,I 2nd this!
bipolar,fejhlge,t1_fej15lh,1579174606.0,Apparently I wasn't. My boss said she walked by me standing at the copier sleeping. I would fall asleep everywhere.
AmItheAsshole,feiw7ji,t3_epe4kl,1579148888.0,"Unless you have telepathy you are NTA. How are you supposed to know not to mention that fact to anyone. She is an asshole and very childish for throwing out flowers you got her. If she us that embarrassed about the situation,  she needs to change it. I honestly cant help you on how to prevent this, unless you can, of course learn telepathy."
bipolar,feio11f,t1_fehpvre,1579143013.0,"I feel like every year, I get more meds added but nothing is ever taken off. Well except once. But that was due to me losing a job. When I got off the vig dose of seroquel, 600mg, I dropped the weight at an alarming rate. Lost 115 lbs in less than 7 months. It was crazy."
bipolar,feinuc0,t1_feifu7c,1579142891.0,Absolutely! I would love to chat!
bipolar,feinrrw,t1_feimgl2,1579142845.0,"I would have to agree with your doctor 100%. I was on 3 50mg doses plus 600mg at night. I lost my job because I kept falling asleep at work. They knew why, but said they couldn't have an Accountant sleeping on the job. I just got an appointment to see my doc after a year of no insurance, but it's not till Feb 20th. :-( Thank you for your imput!"
bipolar,feift6l,t1_fehw66y,1579137523.0,I have to remind myself if that. The seroquel's side effects are really hard on me. At one point I had gain 120lbs. As a petite woman who was only 115 lbs to begin with. It was devastating.
bipolar,feiflbo,t1_feibh2u,1579137375.0,"I misread that at first and thought it said 240+ a day. My mind was blown. Lol I agree with you, good support system is essential.  My fiance didn't really understand at first . He would get upset when I was extremely drowsy. He thought I was on illegal drugs. He went to one of my psychiatrist appointments and has been great ever since. He now comes to my visits to help me explain how I am doing."
AmItheAsshole,fehksg1,t3_ep7bnw,1579118558.0,"Nta- this situation just sucks. While in rehab they tell you over and over to let the outside world be, while you work on yourself. I understand your concern, but honestly what are you expecting from the calls? You are worried for him and want to hear from him but there is no reason to worry. He is in the best place he can be right now."
bipolar,fehjpcc,t3_ep6zky,1579117934.0,I am just now able to get all my meds again but I dont remember taking so many. I always wonder if my doc just throws pills at me in Hope's that I will shut up.
bipolar,feh9f6s,t3_eox52u,1579111892.0,Omg that's crazy. I got my insurance card today after not having it for a year (almost to the date). It took me about 5 min before I was on the phone with my physiatrist. He called in my meds for me and I'll be able to pick them up after I cash my check tomorrow.  I am so freaking excited!!!
bipolar,feh8rf1,t1_fegwcuu,1579111492.0,I didn't either. Dont feel bad. I thought she painted her nails while on Seraquil. Lol

AmItheAsshole,feemeda,t1_feehcqm,1579036697.0,That is ridiculous!!! I use that on my 5 year old when he wants to know why he has to listen to me. I would never use that to a grown child. It's not a real excuse for anything. You use that on young kids when they ask ridiculous questions. I really feel for you!

AmItheAsshole,fdl4yuk,t3_elyoc4,1578517125.0,"NTA- Man this sounds like my life, 15 years ago. I wish I would have done what you did. I stayed for 10 more years and 5 more DWI's, countless court dates and an endless amount of money later. He will never have his license back and I got a lot of gray hairs. He isn't taking this situation seriously and he is trying to gaslight you. You are very smart to get away now."

AmItheAsshole,fdiilwy,t3_eljjk5,1578443740.0,NTA- okay so I see where people are saying she is pregnant and he should have given up his bed. I(f) have 3 sisters and we are all within 5 years. So basically 1 every year. There was a time when 1 or more of us were pregnant and would stay at the parents house. No one ever gave up their beds for the pregnant one. It wasnt even asked. So I see both ways. Plus mom could have given up her bed.
AmItheAsshole,fdihmtk,t1_fdie8qa,1578443119.0,"I'm going to guess they ruled in his favor because she accepted partial payment. Most states, you must be a full 30 to 90 past due before the will sign an order to evict. But that's a guess."

AmItheAsshole,fdh0xxh,t3_eldcam,1578412986.0,Nta- You are subletting and it isnt working. You are willing to find someone else to take your place. You have done everything asked of you. I think you are putting emotions in where there shouldn't be. I think you feel bad for moving out because you would be leaving a friend. If you are unhappy but are willing to do everything legally. You are doing nothing wrong!

AmItheAsshole,fd9xu6f,t3_ek52i9,1578239325.0,"Nta- I also used to be a hair stylist and on behalf of all styles,  I apologize for their actions.  That was completely uncalled for. If the trainee genuinely had a concern she would have gone to your stylist. Not anyone else. As she knows you and your situation. She should have never gone to anyone else, more a less that person take a picture.  You should 100% speak to your stylist as you should have never had to go through this. They need to be properly trained on how this should be handled. 

I am so sorry you had to be embarrassed due to lack of judgement and training.  I am on a lot of medication now for BPD and I know the embarrassment it can bring. This should have been handled so differently. You did nothing wrong and I promise you are correct in wanting to say something!"

ITS THE DEVILS LETTUCE!!!! You gave him your honest opinion. You have done nothing wrong. He could be out there smoking the stems and messing his head up truthfully. You didnt gift the kid a dong for christ sakes. Lol but just my opinion here!
