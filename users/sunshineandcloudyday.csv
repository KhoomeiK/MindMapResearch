According to real world rules, the answer is sort of. Milk in the right proportions can prevent some calcium deficiency diseases/problems in plants as well as keep away some pests. In the wrong proportions, it can cause just as many problems. It can be used as fertilizer and allows plants to live longer which sometimes can mean an increase in size.

Here are some websites I used to find the answer:

They love people usually and each one has their own personality. They are just like little puppies. You can train them to do tricks and they understand simple sentences. The females are more active and playful than males. Males tend to be lazy cuddle bugs. We had/have girls and they rarely nap outside of the cage.
