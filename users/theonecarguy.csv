I got it out in the end so not really a life ender. I just cant fathom what dipshit would run a plug in with an impact. Snug the thing up, go a quarter turn past that, and it never leaks plus you dont need the hand of god to remove it."

A piece of dirt fell in my eye, I jerked my head back smacking the back of it on the ground, and then reacted to that by jerking it forward and plowing my forehead into the transmission cross member.

The fucking saint of a man didn't make a peep till after I was done swearing. I told him it was fine to laugh because that shit was pretty damn comical."

Good lord he was probably just shocked. We've all had moments where we are caught off guard and cant/dont think to look away. In fact it's so prevalent that there are studies observing such reactions in people.

But this is reddit where we crucify people for not making the perfect decision all the time."

Ffs look at how long it took the church to allow these heretical beliefs, and if it weren't for popular opinion they'd probably still make these bs claims.

IdiotsInCars,fecxfmb,t1_fecwicf,1578988519.0,"You are quite the delusional hypocrite. I never said karma existed, I merely pointed out you made a similarly foolish claim. You karma is an overused concept yet say ""pray to god"". You quote the burden of proof about God not existing, then in the same breath say karma isnt real. Do you understand self awareness? Shame your program has to deal with your idiotic ass. 

""Look ma, I can split hairs and enforce double standards! I am so smart.""

Good day to you, I'm done here lol."
IdiotsInCars,fecul8e,t1_fectw11,1578985223.0,"That's not how that works. Look, homie, in another comment on a different thread you said the phrase ""pray to God"". God does not exist, and that phrase is far more overused that Karma, yet you still said it. Why?

And to go back to the point I made, on which you informed me I should educate myself, ""reap what you sow"" is another phrase describing the same general concept as Karma. ""Reap what you sow"" is the belief that through your actions you plant seeds of a certain nature, and as a result the fruits of those seeds shall be of the same nature. Karma (this is grossly over simplifying) is the belief that if you do good, good things will happen to you, and if you do bad, bad things will happen to you. Both of these are slightly different, yet still very similar interpretations of cause and effect. The philosophy behind both is the same, do (A) and (B) will happen. 

This is shit you would know if you picked up any book of philosophy ever, or took any entry level course. Perhaps it isn't me that lacks education on the matter. Instead you just want to talk out of your ass and spout nonsensical drivel in order to appear superior, though you likely try to mask this as some attempt to ""educate"" others, and in the process make yourself feel as though you are above the rest of us.

To summarize, you're being a bit of a twat m8, and we all see that, as reflected by the negative votes on your original comment. But of course everyone else is wrong and only you know the truth."
