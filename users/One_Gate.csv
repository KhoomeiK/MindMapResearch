It just wasn't written realistically.  The scene was all exposition and slapped together due to last minute re-writes.  They had to cram the botched Romulan evacuation and a completely separate story line about a synth revolt into the episode.   It was way too many ideas in an implausible scenario.  It wasn't good writing."

These type of ""journalists"" are only found after 8PM on 24h news networks.  It just seemed like the writers don't understand journalism. It just wasn't realistic."
startrek,fffa798,t1_ffeye7g,1579879475.0,"I think the point of the interview was exposition due to lazy writers.  There's no excuse for a scene like that with a tv show of this budget.  Also, there were 5 writers for this episode. How did any of them allow that?  Then again, it probably slipped through because there were so many writers messing with it.

Clearly, there were significant reshoots involved and they were unable to completely remove entire storylines and needed to cram them all in.  it's almost comical how he explains that there was a rescue mission...that failed...oh and there was a also a synth revolt...and mars exploded.

Also, I could appreciate the interview scene because of how cartoonish it was.  When you set up a feature interview like that, you are familiar with the journalist and you select someone based on their reputation and legitimacy.  The journalist turned out to be a CNN talking head personality like Chris Cuomo.  It just wasn't realistic. 

My other issue was that it wasn't thought provoking.  Normally, when you reference current events, you do it in a way that gives you a different perspective on current society.  There was nothing thought provoking about this interview. All they did was let us know that the media hasn't evolved.  Oh, ok."
startrek,fff93tu,t1_ffd6l85,1579878760.0,"Agreed. I thought this series would fill the Star Trek gap left by Discovery's action movie take on Trek. I thought this series would take us back to thought provoking science fiction.

startrek,fff7vae,t1_ffehnzy,1579877914.0,"I'm not saying that an interview can't move the story. I'm just saying that exposition like that is inexcusable. It's bad writing for any show let alone a show with this budget.  Also, it took me out of the scene when it became a cartoonish hard-hitting interview that would never have taken place.

Name a single feature story that included an interview like this.  Off the top of my head, I can think combative interviews with Sarah Palin or R. Kelly.  In both cases, the interviewer was selected in advance and gave fair questions where the interviewee had a chance to answer.  The interview presented in the show doesn't happen.  Unless, you're talking about talking head interviews on shows like Chris Cuomo but those are intentionally set up to be contentious and both parties know that going into it.  This was not an interview Picard did in a rush.  He had time to choose the platform."

I also agree about the archive.  It was a ridiculous scene.  He travels to san francisco to receive exposition that he already knows.  He knows there are two paintains, he knows the name of the painting. The other copy is in his study.  The only reason for the scene seemed to be to ensure that no one had accessed the second copy.  Why bother with the ""two copies"" idea to begin with. I suppose it was a poorly written metaphor that resulted in a scene full of expostiion."
startrek,ffefdxq,t1_ffeezfw,1579845909.0,"Yes, interviews like that take place.  That doesn't explain why Picard chose her to interview him.  The paint point is that exposition is bad writing. That scene shouldn't have been in the episode.  When it comes to writing: show. don't tell.

and if they wanted to include something about the current state of the media, the premise for the scene would have needed to be completely different. That interview approach doesn't happen in feature stories."

Then he offers Dajh some earl grey tea...""early grey tea makes everything better.""   ya...we get it....the man likes earl grey tea.

The fan service got old fast. His dog's name being ""Number 1"", the replicator, the tea, the dream sequence on the ship, the poker game, the photo of him and Worf.  It felt more like lip service than anything that moved the story forward.

and i agree about the writing being lazy.  There's no excuse for having lines like ""But that's impossible!"" and ""They killed my boyfriend"" ""Calm down. Who's they?"""
startrek,ffed7ny,t1_ffe09h0,1579843754.0,"What i liked about his moral uprightness was that it led to difficult thought provoking decisions.

In this episode he seemed to be right about everything.  It sounds like Synths killed a lot of people and yet Picard thinks it was inconceivable that synths be regulated.

startrek,ffecluq,t1_ffd3zg3,1579843178.0,"I was confused by the archive scene.  He travelled to san francisco to be told exposition about a painting that he already knew.  He even asked 'Index' to tell him the name of the painting. a painting that he already has in his study in France.

startrek,ffebjcx,t3_esxtrd,1579842197.0,"Television writing has improved massively since the days of TNG.  I didn't expect recycled tv tropes.

* Cliche dream sequence opener
* Cliche Dajh/Picard dialogue. ""Who are you"" ""My boyfriend...they...they killed my boyfriend."" ""Calm down. Who's they?""
* A lot of recycled network tv show tropes/lines like ""Don't quit your day job"" ""but that's not possible!"" ""wait, I didn't mention picard. how could you have known that?"" ""organic synths? hahahaha...wait are you being serious?"" It's cartoonish lazy dialogue.
* The female characters were odd. The reporter was a 1 dimensional bitch. The servant(?) didn't seem to have any characteristics.  All of the scenes were either two men talking, a woman talking to a man, or a brief scene of a woman talking to another woman about a man.  When the servant got a room ready for Dajh I thought it was odd that we didn't see them speaking to each other.  When Dajh went missing she said something like ""your guest is missing.""  Did they not speak and learn each other's names? Dajh's entire personality seemed to consist of confusion. It wasn't clear what her strengths, weaknesses, or motivations were other than finding Picard.
* There was a lot of lazy exposition: the interview, the ""she's activating!"" scene, Picard saying ""you seem to have been...awakened"", picard immediately knowing/explaining that her memories aren't real, picard for some reason knowing/explaining that she's a fully organic synth, the archive ""Index"" character explaining to Picard where the painting came from despite him already knowing where it came from.

In the age of HBO, Netflix, FX quality writing, the writing here felt like a cheesy CW superhero show.  Dialogue in 2020 should not have dialogue like ""What? But that's not possible!"""

PoliticalDiscussion,ffcmc71,t3_ess5j2,1579802499.0,"A proportional representation election can result in, for example, 30% of the representatives being selected by part X. The drawback is that, by not electing people directly, it can lead to ineffective/corrupt representatives being continuously selected by the party to make up the government. You can't ""vote out"" individual candidates under proportional representation. The party is the only one that chooses who makes up the government. This can entrench corrupt candidates with a lot of ties in the party.

With a single member representing a district, the member has to directly earn votes and be accountable to those voters in each election. If they're ineffective or corrupt, the opposing candidate in that district will win.

I'm not suggesting one system is better, just pointing out some benefits of single member rep.

Proportional rep has benefits in countries where there's a well distributed majority group that would prevent any minority members from being elected in any one district. However it doesn't work well in countries with a lot of corruption. Voters might be generally happier with less corrupt representatives even if they aren't from their minority group."
