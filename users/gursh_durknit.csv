Political_Revolution,ff89hjo,t1_ff7hwe9,1579669962.0,"I've never been a fan of HRC, but I didn't realize what a petty monster she is until her recent comments about Bernie. Particularly after all he did for her, the gentleman he is, and she says no one likes him and that he is a career politician (talk about the pot calling the kettle black). And then she brings up the BeRnIe BrOs and says that he enjoys their supposed behavior. I have zero respect for her at this point, but I'm honestly glad she made these comments because I think it will gain him sympathy, particularly from right leaning independent voters."

ABoringDystopia,fdlbvra,t1_fdiu46s,1578520714.0,"I would argue the opposite. It's too ""inconvenient"" for most to care until they MUST. The U.S. will eventually turn a new leaf, but not until there is more unnecessary suffering to make people angry and not only willing to vote, but to follow elected officials on their promises. So often when people do ever vote in this country, it's a thoughtless throw away, and they're not paying attention to see what their elected officials are actually doing while in office, so when problems persist, they become apathetic and confused, which leads to acceptance. We need to break this, and it starts by saying ""We have a system of shit. And this is not acceptable."""

ABoringDystopia,fdkv66v,t1_fdk6fub,1578511817.0,"This is not accurate. Mental illness is certainly a significant cause of homelessness, but it has never been the leading. Some sources below.  


[From the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty](https://nlchp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Homeless_Stats_Fact_Sheet.pdf):  
The leading causes of homelessness are: (1) lack of affordable housing, (2) unemployment, (3) poverty and low wages, (4) mental illness and the lack of needed services, and (5) substance abuse and the lack of needed services.   


[From the National Coalition for the Homeless:](https://nationalhomeless.org/about-homelessness/)  
The leading causes of homelessness are: (1) lack of affordable housing, (2) poverty due to unemployment, low wages, and declining availability of public assistance, and (3) lack of affordable health care, domestic violence, mental health illnesses, and addiction.  


[From the National Alliance to End Homelessness](https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/what-causes-homelessness/incomeinequality/):  
The leading causes of homelessness are: (1) lack of affordable housing, (2) poverty due to unemployment or low wages, (3) health issues - physical and mental, (4) domestic violence, (5) specific racial disparities  


[From NYU's ""The 12 **Biggest Myths** about Homelessness in America""](https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2019/september/HomelessQandA.html):  
(1) Most are mentally ill.  
(2) The majority abuse drugs and alcohol.  
(3) They're dangerous and violent.  
(4) They're criminals  
(5) ""Bad choices"" led to their homelessness  
(6) They prefer the freedom of life on the street.  
(7) They spend all their money on drugs and alcohol.  
(8) They just need to get a job.  
(9) The homeless are not part of our ""community"".  
(10) They live in unsanitary conditions because they don't care.  
(11) The legal ""right to shelter"" is the best way to end homelessness.  
(12) In coastal cities with low rental-housing vacancy rates, it is impossible to find enough housing for homeless individuals and families."
