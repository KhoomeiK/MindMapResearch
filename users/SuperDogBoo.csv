At some point, I would encourage them to keep making YouTube videos, and we would work on a lot of videos together and I would give them a run down on how to edit the videos, the gear needed, and then past me will eventually time travel back, edit the videos, become viral, and I will be living one of my several teenaged dreams and create a successful online business for myself. 

We would also introduce younger me to my now older sister, me see the younger version of my sister, and do a lot of time travel shenanigans. Also, have them teach me how to time travel."
MaliciousCompliance,ff48qyp,t1_ff2eiw2,1579558003.0,"My comment gave me a brilliant idea. Next time I make myself a milkshake, I’ll either split it into 2 cups for more whipped cream, or just make less and add more whipped cream. Either way, the milkshakes we make are huge and it doesn’t really hurt the quantity size."
MaliciousCompliance,ff2coc6,t1_ff2cb38,1579500866.0,"Ooh I love getting the double chocolate chip frappe and seeing the whipped cream with drizzled chocolate on top. Yum!!

I am at college and actually have a whipped cream container to go with my Christmas themed ice cream (one of my favorite ice cream flavors that is only available during the holidays so I stock up on it at home and bring it to school whenever I have the chance.) I also do shots of whipped cream straight into my mouth lol. 

I brushed my teeth and just 5-10 minutes ago I was craving donuts that I got for free, and now I’m craving whipped cream lol. Just wait till morning, SuperDogBoo, just wait till morning.."
MaliciousCompliance,ff2bg14,t3_er8guc,1579499623.0,"Honestly, I’d love it if someone did that to me. I ask for extra whipped cream all the time, and sometimes they deliver, sometimes it’s the normal amount that should be on there and they originally didn’t put enough on there. Sometimes they don’t listen to my request and I have normal whipped cream lackage.


Whenever I make a milkshake at my job, I try to put as much whipped cream on that sucker as gravity will allow me. Unfortunately I also add too much milkshake to my drink as well, so it’s less room for whipped cream goodness."

Toontown,fe6l1ra,t1_fdzqj5z,1578894443.0,"You have a good point with the limitations part. I’ve heard that before. I think that even entering the videos with a topic to discuss would help make the videos more interesting. I have watched   Megasnoop, Coach Z, and Coach’s evil twin. They all have very different approaches to Toontown which is cool. Megasnoop talks more about updates and the irl stuff, Coach Z would give tips and tricks in a rude way, and his evil twin had the appeal of trolling and going against the rules. I definitely won’t troll and green, but I need to figure out what my approach is on this game. I don’t want to be like every other channel, which is why I’m trying to add random challenges to the mix. However, I don’t want each episode to be the same as the last.

Toontown,fe6ks1d,t1_fe42v73,1578894174.0,"That’s an interesting idea. I can still do the same content, but would probably progress more each stream than in an episode. I’d just have to find time to stream. The nice thing about the videos I’ve been doing is it only takes 20-40 minutes to record which is great for my college and work schedule. However, streaming would help eliminate the time it takes to edit, which would help me create more content more often."

I have an emergency fund in a high yield savings account, have some money invested in the stock market, and am going to start investing in a Roth IRA as well. I don’t intend to purchase the pc parts till late spring or summer, so I have plenty of time to save up. 

I appreciate the concern, but as long as I am smart with finances, I don’t see the problem with spending extra time to save myself money in the long run by purchasing nicer parts later instead of buying more inexpensive parts now then replacing them later this year or next year.

investing,fd60mn6,t3_ejyye9,1578183876.0,"I started a few months ago. Originally I was going to go into Forex trading because it seemed simpler to understand. At some point I decided to go into the Stock Market instead. I’m guessing I thought it seemed safer and since I can get dividends, would make money regardless of what I do. Also, I discovered that investing in what you know is pretty safe and some companies, like Disney, Apple, and Coca-Cola, will pretty much always be around so those are safe. I didn’t have a bunch of money to start with (and still don’t) so I bought mostly cheaper dividend stocks that either were good price with monthly dividends, or stocks that will last longer with dividends. I made a couple of dumb investments, but thankfully my losses were small. I also learned to buy and hold and not be emotional. Of course, I’m human and probably sold a couple stocks I shouldn’t have or bought stocks that are dumb, but oh well. I also have about 40 dollars in bitcoin (gonna sell half once I can get a profit to invest it better.) 

I started 3 months ago and if I sold everything today, I would profit about 60-70 dollars. Not much but proof of concept.

Also, I’m a college student with a part time job making minimum wage. I wanted to find other sources of income and make my money work for me. Yes, I still work for money, but through high interest savings accounts and the stock market, I make about 3-5 dollars a month. Not a lot, but a start."

I’m personally taking the dividend strategy route. It’s small amounts of money right now, but I want the stocks to do work for me and eventually make enough to get a free stock each month. Once fractional shares are released on Robinhood, that will help me a lot. 


I started only a few months ago with a hundred dollars. (Also a college student with limited funds lol) up to today, I’ve spent about 500-600 dollars and if I sold everything right now, I’d profit about 50-60 dollars. Not a lot, but it’s a 10% return on investment right now which isn’t bad. Of course, the only stocks I’d sell are my “stupid” stocks, super high gains stocks, or the small bit of money I threw into bitcoin just to mess around. 

I’m also using a long term strategy where I intend to hang onto my stocks for as long as possible.

Now that I’ve been in the stock market for a few months, I’ve discovered that it can be quite addicting just to throw 20 dollars into my account here and there, so be careful if you need to save your money for other stuff. 

Since you have 100 dollars right now, I recommend investing in some of the more expensive stocks or an etf in case you can’t afford it later. Of course, do your own research on what to invest it in."

This fall, while in school, I got started on investing in the stock market, opened up a high interest savings account, and while am currently at a lost, am working on a dropshipping business. 

I haven’t made a ton of money this year, but didn’t really start making much money until the fall semester with my job. The stock market is costing me quite a bit of money, but I’m growing my dividend stocks. Right now I only make 1-3 dollars a month, but it’s a start. When Robinhood starts fractional shares, I know that will definitely help my dividend and growth stocks. 

If I can get a location on campus and it’s allowed, I’m going to also experiment with the candy machine/vending business. I am going to buy a candy machine and see if I can turn that into a monthly stream of income.

investing,fcd7lkp,t1_fcc0kc0,1577607351.0,"True. Once Robinhood has fractional shares, my dividends will be much more stable and safe. I will also focus more on growth and long term too. I can’t wait to invest my 2-4 dollars a month into decent dividend stocks and high yielding cheap stocks lol. I want some Coca Cola, Appla, Disney, Verizon, and more Johnson and Johnson in my life lol. 

I’ve got an M1 finance account and some money invested there, but Robinhood is my primary brokerage. I’m investing more into M1 as time goes on, because they do fractional shares really well."

It looks like it is kind of risky since it dipped significantly. Could be a fluke. Idk, I might take some bitcoin money and invest it in that since my bitcoin money is already the money I’m fine being risky with."

Also, I want a stronger focus on the present day story. The story in 2, Brotherhood, Revelations, and 3 was really cool, but I also loved what they did in Black Flag and Rogue with the first person stuff. It seemed like there would be a nice trend going but then they dropped that. I want the present day focus like Desmond’s story, but with the style of Black Flag. There’s all these hints going on in present day, but no progress. 

I haven’t played Odyssey yet and barely played Origins, so isn’t how that turned out. I know ur in 3rd person and have some story in Odyssey, but idk how much focus it gets."

Entrepreneur,fc7i28r,t1_fc72w7k,1577508088.0,"Nice! Im definitely wanting to invest more into index funds once I get the chance. I’ve been investing in lower costing dividend funds because it’s easier investing small bits at a time and I want to build the beginning part of the snowball. I know it’s not the safest, but once fractional shares on Robinhood are a thing, I’ll change my strategy up some. 

Thanks! My YouTube is YouTube.com/verytori. I’ll definitely check out your channel!

I was having a Christmas party with some family tonight and it was kind of funny that I sounded more financially smart tonight. For example, when my cousin who lives in LA mentioned how much Bachelorette contestants earn for each rose, I asked if it was before or after taxes lol. (Never did find out, but I’m assuming before) While that is something I’ve thought about before, I feel like I’ve almost become a different person in this aspect. I just have to make sure that change is a good thing lol.

It’s also weird that my cousins and I are all adults in our 20s and we are talking about real life adult stuff lol. Not to mention everyone I know is getting married 😂."
