depression,fet6z37,t3_eqc90a,1579372353.0,You know.... Your eating and exercise habits have an enormous impact on your energy levels. You really should try changing that before going on meds....
depression,felgw78,t3_epm2ch,1579221885.0,My goodness your ex is an absolute horrible person and you're much better without him....
needadvice,fek11cb,t3_epdtks,1579190312.0,My very best advice : read Heaven and Hell by Allan Kardec. Or at least look into it! It'll change your perspective.
socialwork,fefetxe,t1_fefeq32,1579054818.0,Great!! Thank you so much I really appreciate everything!
socialwork,fefeh1z,t1_fefde4p,1579054595.0,"Thanks so much I'll definitely look into that. And yes, I'd go ahead and do a MSW, I like the one given at uVic as it's a SW program focused on indigenous (in which case I'd move on the Island too). Although you can only apply every other year, it'd give me time to do volunteer work before even starting my MSW."
socialwork,fefbmun,t1_feejy3h,1579052760.0,"Thanks for sharing. If I do go into that field - and I'm thinking about it more and more seriously - I'll at least go with the knowledge that I'll have to deal with difficulties with people/the system/ myself, and that I ought to be well equipped (especially mindset-wise). Almost everyone who works in that field do it for a bigger cause... For others.. To bring more good, and if possible, some justice. I think it may be one of the best ways to dedicate one's life..!"
socialwork,fefba7x,t1_feesq67,1579052532.0,"Thank you so much for taking the time to reply... It's true that the people you work with make a world of difference regarding whether or not you end up liking your job, but I can see how this would be even more so when it comes to social work, since the situations encountered can be quite difficult. It's good to keep in mind.

I am not currently working/volunteering in the area, but a part of my current job is working as a medical emergency coordinator for people travelling (travel insurance field), so I've dealt/deal with crisis situations and death. Unfortunately as I'm on call 24/7 I cannot do volunteer work, but it's definetly something I've thought about and looked into briefly as I am doing my research on sw/see if it's something I really want to get into. My hours may change though and if they do I'll definetly look into volunteer work. I'm in Vancouver too -- any resources you could share regarding volunteer work in social work programs (especially Indigenous if possible)? Thanks again!!"
socialwork,fecq5jv,t1_fecg0d9,1578980581.0,"That's amazing! And yes... I like how being a social worker puts you in a position where you can stand for what is right, and advocated for others as much as you can."
socialwork,feciahv,t3_entbhq,1578974586.0,"I've been juggling a lot with the idea of going into social work, more specifically Indigenous social work (I'm in Canada). I have a BA in Anthropology and always wanted to dedicate my life helping and understanding others. I'm scared though that being a social worker may be taxing emotionall/mentally, or get me frustrated and mad with the system. So I was just curious as to what pushed you to become a social worker? And those of you who are social workers and have been doing it for a while, how are you finding it?"
socialwork,fecfubc,t3_enbiky,1578972904.0,Awesome!! So happy for you! Wishing you all the best

spirituality,fe3acvd,t3_enpc2o,1578847468.0,"While you're incarnated, your ego is a part of you. You're a trinity; mind body and soul. No need to go against what is God given. Sure you need to learn to look pass your ego, but your ego is your current self, current individualization of God. See oneness, but don't go against what simply is..."

Overwatch,fdak54z,t3_ekd1pt,1578246914.0,Love this!!
spirituality,fdaidfj,t3_ekfyaa,1578246456.0,"Well, I don't know if this is related to your past psychological/mental issues, it could be, but one thing I know for sure is that every human by their nature can be medium/psychic, and these faculties can be dormant and awakened. I would recommend you The Mediums Book by Allan Kardec, it's brought a lot of answers to me but also a safety net, giving me knowledge on what to do if ill-intentioned spirits are bothering me. The book also explains how to open up more to the spiritual world, and in a proper manner. I think you can find free pdfs of the book online ~"
spirituality,fdahhee,t1_fdago4a,1578246168.0,"I see, that's fair lol. Well, enjoy the book! I pretty much devoured it when I first stumbled upon it, but it's good to take time to internalize the info. Hope it helps you on your spiritual journey, it surely gave a boost to mine! :)"
spirituality,fdagfik,t1_fdaclvg,1578245783.0,"Btw it's easy to find free pdfs of these books online. I also found a deal on kindle a few years back and got all the books for like $2. If you want a hard copy you can buy them but they tend to be a bit more expensive. You can also check in your community ; I don't know where you live, but there might be a Spiritist Center near you and they usually give books away/sell them cheaply and in different languages."
spirituality,fdafdft,t1_fdaclvg,1578245467.0,"No, they are all unique, and they complement each other very well. The mediums book is very good at understanding disincarnated spirits and how you can interact with them/what to do when they are bothering you, how to understand them, etc. The Genesis was very interesting however a bit too focused on Christianity for me (it's understandable as it was written in France in the 1800s, but keep in mind that Spiritism encompasses all religions on earth and not just Christianity (see Cao Dai in Vietnam, very interesting.)) Also I found a few pieces of info here and there to be... Not outdated per se, they are still valid, but from science we now know a lot more about the topic. Mainly that one was my least favorite but still interesting. Heaven and Hell by Allan Kardec is incredibly interesting!!! It's a Q&A with people/spirits who recently passed away, and talk about their experience. It's illuminating, and makes you understand karma and justice in a whole new light. Also wipes the fear of what's beyond, at least for me. 
I haven't read The Gospel yet."
spirituality,fdacffu,t1_fdab5bi,1578244550.0,"I love the Spirits Book, it was compiled in in the 1850s by a French person who took the pseudonym of Allan Kardec. And I say compiled because he didn't actually write it, these are compilations of Q&As made by different mediums and answered by different spirits accross time. It's the most scientifically based spiritual doctrine. You'll understand once you read it. Tip: the intro of that book is long and heavy, I recommend keeping it for the end if it ends up making you want to stop reading the book (that's what happened to me and that's what my friend suggested me). No problem on reading the intro at the very end, and skipping to the Q&A right away ;)."
spirituality,fdabgc7,t1_fd9k80d,1578244121.0,"Yes, indeed..!"
spirituality,fdab024,t1_fda12o3,1578243918.0,"Yes, a lot of them!"
spirituality,fd7uqod,t1_fd7ukoa,1578210419.0,Both books are pretty much Q&As / conversations. Easy to read ~
spirituality,fd7ukoa,t3_ek0wjf,1578210338.0,"I strongly recommend The Spirits Book by Allan Kardec and Conversations with God by Neil Donald Walsh. Both of these together will give you a great understanding of the nature of the spiritual world and life as it is. You can form your own opinions with them, follow your heart. One thing I'm sure of thought, itll give you a LOT of answers."
spirituality,fd7t33n,t3_ek8gew,1578209667.0,"You exactly wrote my thoughts. And you're right ; it both matters and doesn't matter, that you save the world or let it burn. Everything is impermanent anyways. The earth is doomed to disappear one way or another, eventually. Now, do we want to work towards creating a space on this planet where very high levels of living life can happen before the Earth does dissapeared? I think it's a goal to aspire to as growing spiritual beings. However, what does matter the most on a daily basis is not necessarily the actions you do but the way you do them, ie the state of being you are in while doing anything at any given moment. What is important, I believe, is being as often as possible our highest self/coming from a place of love: generous, loving, compassionate, patient, forgiving, kind, happy, grateful, etc. And by being these things we do indeed change the world for the better."

SpiritualAwakening,fctj6jh,t3_eiqfib,1577945122.0,I just try to listen and be compassionate and then turn a positive spin on the conversation. Find a silver lining or a teaching or anything that's positive and mention it/discuss it. Practice patience and put boundaries when it's too much
