[https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198113306392/](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198113306392/)

I am a huge Total War fan having played most of the games and i remember playing this one such long time ago and i guess owning it on steam would make me come back to it. My dad also loved this game, I manged to hook him into TW games with Rome 1 way back in 2006 or so but i remember him playing Empire for like half a year maybe. Im 27 and from Montenegro and lets see, i started playing games back in 2001 i think, Commandos Behind Enemy lines was the first one that i remember having on my first pc. I like rock, hip hop, r&b music , also soundtracks from movies/anime. Currently im just looking for a new job ,and i must admit it ain't easy here, so i've been just diving deep into Attila and Medieval 2 TW and so many great mods those 2 games have, given all i have is spare time ;)

&#x200B;

And thanks for the giveaway man!"

GiftofGames,ff8riiy,t3_es96ct,1579693185.0,"I was in a stress test of this game week or so ago, and i literally couldn't get in the game because it was always full server, for entire 3 tests it kept saying i have to wait in a queue and i tried entering as soon as servers opened. That price tag is not justifiable to me. I was wondering how they will price it, considering barely anyone got to test it in that test. Good luck to you, im just saying in general that i think the game should have been under 30 dollars, considering they said price will increase gradualy as they release more early access content"
nba,ff8qysa,t3_es534r,1579692485.0,"Harden when he does that long drible and you know he will shoot a three, he tries so hard to draw a player in to lunge on him and shoot, he does that all the time , when he jumps when taking a 3 point shot he always looks to land close to his defender or into him to draw a foul, i literally havent seen him take a three point shot with someone guarding him where he didnt try to draw a foul, just look at his highlights from last game for example. And when you compare Harden ti Luka , its way more obvious with Harden, Luka does that too but not comparable to Harden in terms of how often he does it. When Luka does a stepback three its slick and clean and he doesnt lunge into his defender, when Harden does it he somehow always lands so close to his guard."

Its still a weird  quiet low key strategy when it comes to new console reveal from them, oposed to flashy like Xbox did.

Same with triple doubles for him, he was very close to it so many times in first half of the rookie season, but once he finally did it in january 2019 he started doing it a lot more easily, and now its basically second nature to Doncic.
