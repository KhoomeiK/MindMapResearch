sex,ff4jqsy,t1_ff3bati,1579565288.0,My bf is uncut and says that because the blood is thick it makes his foreskin sticky and creates friction between the foreskin and the tip which kinda itches for him. We keep baby wipes by the bed so he can do a quick swipe before cuddling for like 10 mins and then we pee and take a couples shower. Lube would also help to break up the stickiness.
sex,ff4j7sn,t3_ere8iq,1579564910.0,"My boyfriend just said the other day “I think of you having your period like me having a runny nose, it’s no big deal.” We put a dark towel down and he’s mostly on top or we do doggy. He’s just as attracted to me when I’m on my period and has even told me he doesn’t mind going down on me on my moderate/light days (though I’m still warming up to that idea). It’s super refreshing and endearing, but also so sad that before him I was conditioned to be secretive and ashamed of feeling sexual while menstruating. It’s helped me be so much more in touch with my sexuality and connected to my lover. That’s my baby ❤️🥰"
television,feslfm3,t1_fen1jde,1579366450.0,"I met her once, she was very nice and complimented me on my outfit and seemed like a genuinely nice person..... so my guess is she’s a loony idiot that believes her own delusions."
vanderpumprules,feops37,t3_eq53ta,1579303663.0,The Crappens guys said he looks like Dory from Finding Nemo. I think it fits.

cats,femo6z4,t1_femnmrr,1579264441.0,"You posted a pic of a cat that wasn’t yours and I commented on it like the mods say we should, it’s not that deep, I wasn’t attacking you. It’s not about “decency,” don’t make this a thing."

cats,femm6sx,t3_epokcb,1579262242.0,This isn’t your cat. I’ve seen this post/meme before. Surprised it’s gotten this many upvotes.

Anxiety,fdt6p2t,t3_emwmv8,1578712628.0,"I am currently battling with anxiety and wondering whether or not I should reach out to my school’s disability services but haven’t for the same reasons you shared. I already have a hard enough time convincing the people closest to me that I struggle with this daily, I hate explaining my illness to people. But I guess I just have to realize that it’s either I trust myself and put my pride aside to get the help that I need or I suffer silently and flunk out of school under the pressure."
cats,fds6w97,t1_fdrdhak,1578695706.0,My aunt and uncle have a cat that was misgendered. His name is Arletta but we use she/her pronouns cuz my cousins were very little when they got him and grew up thinking he was a she.

AskReddit,fca88sd,t3_egroo0,1577564553.0,This fucking Dance Monkey song is so painfully nauseating. Probably playing it 3-5 times would be enough to make me crack.
thebachelor,fca664s,t3_egu2sf,1577563630.0,"I think Tyler is a nice guy. I hate whoever is relentlessly representing him and making him do thirsty stuff on instagram all the time but Tyler, he seems nice."
