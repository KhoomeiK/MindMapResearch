My friends suck, I’m not even a part of the group and I don’t think I did anything wrong, they’re not mad at me or anything. It probably doesn’t help that I wander around through groups at lunch or nutrition because I get worried people don’t want me there even though my presence doesn’t make any difference. I don’t mind being alone but I care about what people think so I have bad friends just to have friends. They dump all there baggage on me and leave. Then this bitch has the fucking audacity to post about all the sad shit she’s experienced in 2019 on Instagram. It’s has 14 year old “depressed” written all over it but instead of billy fucking eyelash it’s twenty one pilots. Then she thanks all the people that helped her through shit and forgets to include me. I was the first person she fucking came out to. I spent hours helping her. I never reach out for help because I don’t want to be like her and seem weak. I kinda ranted at the end but bro that really salts my fucking apples."
