Most of the writing displayed in this post is absolutely fine. I didn't feel that it was written by a non-native. Using the phrase "" **Even writing** this post makes me insecure about my writing skills."" shows an understanding of the language flow in English. Using ""Even"" at the beginning of a sentence to enhance the previous statement is very common.

Idk man, I think you're fucking doing great."

RepTime,fc63qy1,t3_egerzs,1577471592.0,"I assume this is a mechanical watch, maybe even automatic. You need to wind it.

To test if it is automatic shake it back and forth for 20-30 seconds and see if the second-hand starts moving. If it does you can wind the watch using the crown. Normally the first position clockwise.

If it doesn't start moving it could just be mechanical which means you need to wind it.

If winding it does nothing there's a problem."
