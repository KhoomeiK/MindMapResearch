I look at my 40kg Rottweiler x malamute and my 20kg husky, and neither have been sick in 2 days. I did the math, even if the husky had eaten all of them (wouldn't put it past her, she has a sweet tooth), she would have only had the runs.

But where were the individual wrappers?

When you apply the dark shadow avoid bringing it to the inner quarter of your lid, as it can make the brow look heavier. Use a lighter colour from the inner eye to three quarters across and into the crease. Add darker crease colour to outer third and blend inwards after cleaning the brush.


Your face is well balanced, so I would apply blush from just in front of the hairline in line with your lower lid and blend to middle of the eye, in a Diagonal line towards your nose tip."

Take the answer, ""yes or no.""

If yes, show them the 3 and ask them which looks closest. If they say a different undertone, pick up one that matches that, and go to the mirror.

""OK I'm going to pop these side by side on your face.""

Then look at what works. It's going to be the shade you picked, because the other will look sallow or ashy. Then, you can just move on to how to set it, warm it with bronzer, contour, whatever else they need.

I find I'm most successful when I can subconsciously align the customer to what I'm seeing. Showing the two tones side by side on the face is always the starkest way without being, ""actually im the expert here"" even when you clearly are.

You have to assuage their doubts without sounding like you're dismissing them, so just going, ""OK let's try that to see what you like best,"" makes them feel listened to, which is the number one issue I've come across."

relationship_advice,fcm48f9,t3_ehtagh,1577763826.0,"I was in long term relationships from the age of 16, and I learned a lot from it. My advice to anyone in that age bracket of ""an adult but not a grown-up"" is to be aware of what you want in a relationship, and what you want to give in a relationship.

It wasn't until I met my now husband that I really faced what I was contributing as a partner - I had been flighty, selfish and unrepentant in my previous relationships and if I wanted this one to last, I had to really consider him first. I never thought of myself as selfish, I was always doing kind things for my partner. But I wasn't considering how my life choices would affect them. And to a 22 year old, I would still say, ""be selfish now so you can give later.""


I think the age bracket of 16 to 25 is a great time to learn what it means to be in a relationship and I wouldn't discourage anyone, as such, from being in one. But I would always encourage people to learn what they will and will not put up with and stick to it. I can deal with my husband being messier than me, but I would not deal with a partner being disrespectful of my needs, and values."
