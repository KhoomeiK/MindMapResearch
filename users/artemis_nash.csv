It took til I was 28 to go out in public without foundation on, like, *ever*. Now I don't wear it most days, and I'm just like ""look, I have bad skin, whatever, I'm okay with it now"" and it turns out everything remains fine, people still like me.

Yeah, some of it *is* somewhat nitpicky, and truthfully *none* of it is as egregiously stupid as what we got later on, like at Bastards or, *shudder*, Winterfell/for the Dawn. Even though they used the same ex machina style for Tywin riding up as they did for the Knights of the Vale later, somehow in this battle I was willing to accept it, that they'd so cinematically show up in the middle of the battle at the clutchest point.. like it was storytelling short hand for ""this siege went on for four days, until Tywin showed up with reinforcements"".

It really puts it into perspective how much I/we all are willing to overlook when the story is good, how I'm willing to use my own logic to fill in the gaps that they left, because I easily can and think the story and writers deserve it. Like I apparently did for Blackwater, because now that you point some of these things out they seem obvious, but I just went with it back then. The last time I did that was probably Hardhome, and the veil was starting to lift during Bastards, Operation Catch-A-Wight.. and of course all was lost by Winterfell and Kings Landing.

Edit: oh yeah, re: Davos surviving. I know it's more book stuff (which I haven't read but have read lots of wikis and asked lots of questions) but Davos is associated with the Princess, who's associated with Patchface, who's associated with the Drowned God, who can and probably does revive/save people who die in/around the sea.

funny,fcfqp8z,t1_fcfmi4f,1577632795.0,"Thank you, I appreciate that. Getting up every day just feels like regular life until I take a step back and realize where the fuck I actually am, how I thought all was lost, and become very grateful for all the opportunities I've had to be helped and help myself.

But that's a very good question, lol. Fortunately we've been able to come live with my parents, who are just happy we're clean and are very willing to give us a place to live while we start over. So no rent, we sold our car, and when he quit he cashed out his retirement (not smart, we know, but it was the best option because we, and especially he, needed to take some time off for a while). We were able to afford/hide our addictions for so long because we both had good jobs, and weren't the type anyone would ever suspect. So now he's working part-time as a bartender, and I'm back in school for nursing and will soon start working part-time as a CNA.

Compared to, well, *all* of the people I met in rehab, I really recognize how incredibly lucky we both are. Most dope fiends barely have a family, or their families are as bad off as they are, and they don't have educations and work histories to fall back on when they start over. Our families aren't rich at all, but they're there and they love us. On the one hand we squandered the great setup we had, but on the other hand, considering we *did* squander it, we're so fucking lucky we have family, degrees, and skills to fall back on.

Edit: am realizing after describing all that that saying we ""lost everything"" sounded pretty entitled, because yeah we lost our house and I got fired from my dream job (and he was definitely gonna be fired if he didn't quit) but we did still have more than a lot of people do. I guess it just felt like losing everything, like our lives fell apart because everything just felt so, so out of control."

I'm 29 and my husband is 33, and a year ago we were nine years into a horrible heroin addiction that eventually lost us everything, so with nothing left and fully destroyed lives and bodies we quit our jobs, went to rehab, and started working out. I run about 8 miles a day now, he lost 20lbs and has gained back about 30 in muscle so far.. we look and feel utterly transformed. It turns out keeping track of our diets/cooking has become a huge hobby, we *want* to keep going, hell we don't even casually/socially drink anymore because the potential hangover would mess with our gym plans.

So especially if your friend is supportive and wants to help you (which IME gym rats are always excited to do), fucking go for it. It's *never* too late to change yourself for the better."

But if not I bet the dentist can suggest some kind of rinse or something that you could try. I brushed off (lololol) dental care advice for a long time cuz I've always had good teeth and when I finally went back to the dentist this year turns out I had like 6-12 cavities (got a second opinion after I heard 12, apparently those aren't bad enough to require fillings and won't if I start being on top of my shit) so now I have this renewed interest in dental health."

Usually baristas have one practiced hand motion that accomplishes both for convenience, and if you pour from the thing you get mostly steamed, then you can scoop the froth off the top into your coffee if it's a cappuccino or something with froth."

aww,fc2q0jv,t1_fc25geu,1577370588.0,"So I just looked it up because this has all made me curious, and here's what I found:

Charcoal toothpaste is too abrasive for everyday use, it scrapes off your enamel (that's how it gets the stains off) so if you do use it, use it sparingly. Also they often don't have fluoride, which despite conspiracy theorists' rantings is necessary for lifelong dental health and totally harmless. Also charcoal may stain your teeth long term.

""Who Goes There""

""In 1995, Charlie Lange  says he showed pictures of Dora to Ledoux. Hart tracks down an associate of Ledoux's and forces him to reveal Ledoux's operation with the Iron Crusaders, a biker gang out of East Texas. Cohle, who had been a member of the gang while undercover, takes personal leave to infiltrate it, saying he needs to visit his dying father. Lisa reveals the affair to Maggie, who leaves the house with their daughters. Hart confronts Maggie at her workplace; Cohle extricates him from a standoff with security officers. Cohle's contact in the Iron Crusaders, Ginger, promises access to the gang's meth supply in exchange for Cohle's (who is known to the gang as ""Crash"") help robbing a rival gang. The robbery goes badly, with fatalities on both sides and rising chaos in the rival gang's neighborhood. Cohle is forced to take Ginger prisoner and escape in Hart's car."""
