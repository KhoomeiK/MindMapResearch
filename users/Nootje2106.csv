entitledparents,fei31le,t3_ep3vve,1579129178.0,"I don’t really have a joint account with my parents but they do have access to my account (and thus can withdraw money from it if they would want to). I really don’t have a problem with this as they have never abused this. But even if I hadn’t wanted this, as far as I know, where I’m from it is obligated for a minor’s account to be overseen by a parent (I’m from Belgium btw). I only recently turned 18 and haven’t bothered making a fuss about this, ‘cause as I said, it hasn’t posed a problem. In most cases I think it’s a good idea a kid’s bank account is overseen by a parent, at least until said kid has proven to be able to act responsibly around money."
FuckYouKaren,fei25sf,t1_fehqp9q,1579128635.0,That’s what my mum did too... I’m not a genius by any account but I was quite quick in learning to speak and slow in learning to walk. I believe these are all just things that depend from kid to kid.
FuckYouKaren,fehbfqn,t1_fegcyzs,1579113103.0,I don’t have any personal recollection of this but I trust my mom when she says this happened... So go live your cynist life but it probably wouldn’t hurt you to think twice before you go ahead and accuse people of lying.
news,feey5lf,t3_eols1w,1579043783.0,"Whatever you might believe, please realize that Apple is NOT supporting terrorists when they say they can’t or won’t unlock this iPhone. Cybersecurity is incredibly hard to maintain and they have an incredible team of people working on making sure they stay one step ahead of hackers to protect their users. If they put that team to work in making the hackers’ work easier, they not only risk the trust people put in them as a company but also the security of all their users. A key to get in that phone isn’t a specific key only to be used for that phone: if they continue on this road no ones personal data is safe anymore. So, please, while you stare in outrage at your iPhone screen because Apple won’t cooperate: know it’s you personal data on the line too."

insanepeoplefacebook,fdog8g0,t1_fdofvws,1578604520.0,"There’s money  in selling news, but there’s also a lot of money lost in going to war. Doesn’t that cancel each other out? Or if that doesn’t: what about the lives that are lost in a war? Or does al that just fall under “you can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs”?"
insanepeoplefacebook,fdofdkv,t1_fdmtgx2,1578604047.0,"Arguably, that’s even worse... we should start seeing everyone as people and not just ‘things’ or ‘threats’. If not, how can we expect them to see us differently?"
insanepeoplefacebook,fdmrims,t3_elrc1f,1578562203.0,"Have we forgotten the devastating consequences bombing two cities in Japan during WWII had? There are still people (kids!) who weren’t even alive during that time that suffer from cancer because of the damage the nuclear bomb did to the DNA-sequences of their ancestors. The question isn’t: do we think there are some people in that country we would like to die (which is a pretty f*cked up question anyway, if you ask me), the question is: do we think everyone who lives around there and everyone who will live there in the near future deserves to suffer? I still don’t get how people ar so against building more nuclear power plants, which could potentially go a long way to help our climate, because of safety risks and then casually turn around saying they would like to see an entire country wiped off the map. Newsflash people: that’s way more of a safety hazard than a power plant."
