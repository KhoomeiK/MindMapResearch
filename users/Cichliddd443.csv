druggardening,fevksbo,t1_fe9v5ai,1579398580.0,that's pretty nifty. thank you that was extremely informative
SuicideWatch,feem3zn,t3_eoqgkt,1579036527.0,"it's very strange. it makes sense though, we all have similar problems and when irl humans fail us, screens don't. hopefully the world off the net will catch up morally and we can all be there for each other both on the computer and off"
SuicideWatch,feem03y,t1_feefo2x,1579036465.0,"for real, the internet can be complete crap, but pockets of hope like this pop up. it makes me hope more of the world will interact with them and make them bigger so we will all be on the same page"
MentalHealthSupport,feelrs3,t3_eocn5j,1579036332.0,"it feels like everything was given to me even though i earned it. i'm not fully happy, but another sign of happiness/inner peace in my opinion is being able to defend yourself against anything not terribly lethal that comes your way. You owe nothing, want nothing, and feel good inside and out"
Aquariums,feelj2u,t3_eokb7c,1579036190.0,wooaaaah consider this a surprised pikachu moment for me
weed,fe14dsv,t3_enihzs,1578822352.0,"i'm really high and i was watching a video on salmon in one tab and listening to doctor phil in another tab (but i forgot) and i really really thought that someone was describing how to take care of the salmon. then they started talking about sexual abuse and it had me thinking like 'okay is this because she uses fish as an escape or do these fish have tragic backstories'.

SuicideWatch,fdz23yi,t3_enakk8,1578785861.0,"creative ability isn't necessary to better yourself. it's important to love yourself for everything you do and are (meaning forgiving yourself and accepting what you can't control along the way). maybe start small. even if its something completely fucking stupid, like ""i like how healthy the base of my teeth look"". it's better than nothing. (but also totally hell yea i was there a week ago and some stupid bullshit like the gums thing worked for me, I like how blonde the ends of my hair are and it got me through)"

MentalHealthSupport,fdtc2yw,t1_fdptn5i,1578714642.0,i hope that everything gets straightened out for you. it sounds like you're in a scary place :(

weed,fdsbw1g,t3_dupk7x,1578699054.0,I FEEL THIS TOO BUT I CAN'T GET TOO IN THE ZONE CUZ I'M SKINNY AF AND MY FACE IS UNEVEN AS FUCK SO PEOPLE ACCUSE ME OF BEING ON HARDER DRUGS AND STARE AT ME AND IT BITES MAJOR ASS i CAN'T WaIT TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS
weed,fdsbqw7,t1_f77lv56,1578698957.0,that sounds dope as fuck
weed,fdsbg61,t3_egznvq,1578698758.0,"I don't think so. As long as you can keep the habits when you're not smoking, it's essentially medicine. I don't really know what's wrong with me (because using weed, I've only just figured out how to communicate effectively with a doctor at 22 and haven't started going regularly yet) but I have a low capacity for 'doing things'. I don't feel lazy, it's just I get so angry that doing things makes it worse and I'm not capable of much more than thinking, pacing, and sitting down. Psych meds help, but weed helps a lot more. It's not good to smoke weed every day till you die either tho. It's all about balance and taking care of yourself"
entitledparents,fdrr8zv,t3_emi1qh,1578688482.0,"i genuinely feel bad for the kids that belong to parents like this. i wonder if being a handful was the child's personality, or if she wanted to play with her mom but literally everything in the mom's life had to be perfect before considering time with her child so her child can have her ""fullest most undivided attention"" or something, but the to-do list doesn't end."

dankmemes,fdrpwsz,t3_em1dzc,1578687956.0,"lmaooo so true. one time a teacher tried to physically old me in place by my shoulders because i was tilting the chair. to prove my point, i tilted it while she was standing there. I fell into her, she got mad, I told her neither of us were in trouble because she should have sent me to the office if i wasn't listening. never had a problem at that school again.."

MentalHealthSupport,fdroirp,t3_emuen8,1578687366.0,i hope the best outcome for you
MentalHealthSupport,fdpp89w,t3_emhnr3,1578635386.0,"please for yourself, find within yourself why it is important to keep things like drinking in your life. if it starts the voices, and you feel like you could potentially become a danger to society, laying down in the grass and asking yourself questions about your current state of happiness is always a good but cheezy start."
SuicideWatch,fdpoxy6,t1_fdpd0lz,1578635100.0,i find pedophilia fascinating. there's always a reason for everything. society acts like pedophilia is the worst thing in the world. there is no worst thing in the world. making a competition out of what's bad is a waste of time. what's important is working towards a future filled with more honest goodness individually to create a world filled with those kinds of people
SuicideWatch,fdpom3l,t3_emjsqj,1578634780.0,"to be honest, it sounds like you're being hard on yourself. you're punishing  yourself so others don't it sounds too. if that's not enough, they're not worth convincing. you've never done anything. social media displays young bodies and younger and younger people are using social media behind their parents backs (like the twerps on omegle). whatever happened that made you feel this way isn't your fault. it's good you could sense this within yourself and you got it out of your system before harming another person. get thorough help, and find it within yourself to believe you're still at least a decent person (you must be or whatever you did, you wouldn't feel bad for)"
SuicideWatch,fdpo6ii,t1_fdpfz2g,1578634370.0,"for real. i get picked on a lot 'you can't even take care of yourself how can pets help you' but since i got a lottt of fish, everything's slipping into place. i walk my dog more, i'm less paranoid, i'm keeping the house cleaner, i've improved my hygiene, started working out, and became more active in my other hobbies too. i'm on your side!!!"
schizophrenia,fdpo1z9,t3_emc7pm,1578634252.0,"kudos on coping. not to be sick minded or anything but i like the 'you are god' symptom the most. for me it's just easiest to control because it's the most laughable to me when i hear it out loud. idk if you've found the strength to laugh at yourself but it really helps. it hits my eardrum when i say it and i can't help but start laughing because no one's god, the universe created us equal and for anyone to think that is funny. smiling about it helps a lot"
schizophrenia,fdpmn7o,t3_emj2z9,1578632957.0,I hope your year to learn about yourself was beneficial. I kinda did something like that because I'd have repetitive delusions until I could get to the core of why i have them/why they got so bad. was it anything like that for you?
