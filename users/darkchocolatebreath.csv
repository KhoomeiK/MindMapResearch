childfree,ff481ys,t3_erkdx4,1579557567.0,I think it was more seeing how other people ended up with disabled kids/mentally challenged/ drug addict kids and realising that you have to sacrifice so much of your own life to be a parent. You have to give up your amazing (though you might not know it) life to take care and provide for an actual being that is totally helpless.
TrueOffMyChest,ff47955,t3_erjf7c,1579557075.0,Having a girlfriend will only feel worse when you're not able to live with yourself being alone. I hope you can seek treatment again ;) I know you can do this!
childfree,ff44bzl,t3_erjju1,1579555246.0,Parents and kids should not shop together. I'm 20 and going to the store with my parents it's torture honestly. It's because when you're older your parents think they can take the whole damn day to shop since they don't really have any social lives since the only social interaction is with work colleagues and their children. Guess what? Their colleagues have kids too!

intermittentfasting,ff43gls,t3_erjl3m,1579554711.0,"Deficit. I recall after doing a few 50 hour fasts I couldn't eat more than soups or fruit in small amounts on the first day, unless I wanted to have diarrhoea and cramps. So I'd suggest a deficit for the first 1-2 days."
intermittentfasting,ff437mu,t3_erjmv1,1579554556.0,"Remember that the only thing that determines weight loss, is a calorie deficit. So it doesn't matter how long you're fasting for, if you eat more than what you need to maintain your current weight, you will gain weight. Focus rather on your choice of foods. Increasing the period can help you cut out a meal, but don't be too hectic or you'll just give up. I would suggest just continuing 16:8 but focususing on calories."
fatlogic,ff2v998,t3_ercj4e,1579525500.0,"Yeahh...nope. if you're fat in India, you're still told to lose weight, same goes for China, and also a lot of other countries that weren't colonised."

loseit,fexco89,t3_eqsmm9,1579428732.0,Intermittent fasting! It's helped me because you start to feel REAL hunger. You then can tell the clear difference between boredom hunger and actual hunger. Also you will feel full from eating your maintainance calories in a short period of time.

vegan,fdhqavb,t3_elgpdb,1578428057.0,"You can attribute it to eating more than before (calorie surplus). Regardless of whether something is a carb or not, if you eat too much (more than your maintenance calories) of protein/fat/carbs, you will gain fat. So I'd recommend eating less dense foods. Perhaps after you became vegan you started eating more dense foods like bread/peanut butter, while you can still have these, limit them a bit and try eat more volumous foods like vegetables which aren't calorically dense at all, but ate very filling."
