povertyfinance,fel427r,t3_epi2y6,1579213609.0,I am a former sex worker (stripper and cam girl). Did it for 3 years. I am mentally ill as well and only a couple years older than you so this is validating and relatable. Got tired of it and work a poverty wage slave job now but thankfully with the help of my boyfriend I’m not struggling much any more. I used to be on my own and I was hungry a lot of the time. I’m still dropped out of college but am hoping to reapply here soon and get some things in motion. I feel out of place working a mediocre hourly job but this is just where I’m at in life now. Thank you for sharing this because I still very much identify with the sex work industry and a lot of my story is based around it. I can only hope that speaking more about sex work can break down the stigmatization.

bipolar2,fehu2kz,t3_ep2upd,1579123878.0,"I really hate that you’re being dogged in some of these comments. Medication fucking sucks to take—it’s bad for our organs, causes dry mouth/dental problems, memory problems, etc. so many side effects. I DO understand medicine is a necessary evil a lot of the times and it is life-changing and helpful for a lot of folks. 


With that being said, all of our brains are wired differently and some may be more responsive or manage better with lifestyle changes. Some people need meds. Some needs both. Whatever is OK for each individual.


Basically the take away from this post is, don’t underestimate the power of being in tune with yourself, nourishing your body, being in nature, and doing exercise that feels good for your body. It’s not “fake positive” or bandaiding mental illness or downplaying it or whatever, it can help a lot. Might not be “no meds” level of help, but it’s not like it doesn’t help at all...


I do feel better when I eat Whole Foods plant based, my mind is a lot clearer and my body feels cleaner and I have more energy. It feels good when I stretch my body and do light yoga. I feel so much worse when I succumb to my depressive episodes and eat a whole frozen pizza and refuse to move for days. 


Let’s not attack each other. Mentally ill folk are the most stigmatized group of people. Society fears us and is disgusted by us. We gotta be open minded and love each other."

I will take a class and not come back for months sometimes 😣. I’m usually the one struggling the most in class. I never grew up doing sports or anything active. Just recently in my adult life (about a year and a half ago) I realized I need to exercise, so I’m having to fight years of bad habits...just to give you an idea of my fitness level. 


I took my first Lyra class May 2018. It really is hard. But I will say the hardest part is over which is the first shitty class when you come home just broken mentally. Keep going. I wish I would have taken my own advice because I haven’t taken a Lyra class in probably 6 months so I’m going to have to pretty much start at square one again with that. Push through the next 2 months. 


I am having anxious thoughts about my Silks class tomorrow. My studio was closed for 2 1/2 weeks for holidays and I just hate the feeling of struggling and not understanding how to do anything and I know tomorrow is going to be hard. I feel like other students comprehend moves and steps better. I have to have the instructor come to me and step by step walk me through while others watch a demonstration and just do the thing. But I am still going to go because I want to be a strong and elegant aerialist more than anything. I want to be more than my mental problems and my past self. I want to excel.

Exercise and proper nutrition incorporating all food groups are the way to go. There’s going to be some exceptions to the rule, as with anything, but it doesn’t sound like OP is severely obese. So for the average person a “keto diet” is not necessary whatsoever. The keto diet includes not eating fruit, beans/legumes, or rooted vegetables which is asinine."
bipolar2,fcnpzs9,t3_ei2le4,1577816253.0,"Putting your body into ketosis is not sustainable and is actually quite unhealthy. Your body needs some carbs. What it doesn’t need is an ungodly amount of fats, and very minimal sugar. I eat as whole foods plant-based (vegan) as I possibly can and it has worked well for me. This has forced me to focus on more fruits, vegetables, beans, etc. and it’s honestly done a lot for my mental health as well. I feel proud of myself and nourished instead of ashamed and disgusting like I used to feel with my poor eating habits.


As far as working out goes, I am still a work in progress with my fitness but I would recommend easing into it. Could you start walking/jogging some and do maybe 1 or 2 days a week of HIIT? It’s easy to feel super motivated in the beginning but overloading yourself causes burnout. I dance at home, and recently I have picked up Pilates + strength training studio classes, 2 times a week. 


Lifestyle and diet changes are a journey. Try different things and implement small changes. I have been working on my diet for about 11 months now and have fallen down many times and it’s been a lot of trial and error, but I never gave up. 


Just don’t want to see you fail. Good vibes to you and everyone who reads this."
