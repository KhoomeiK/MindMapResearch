I've never injected and never truely fucked up... have a normal job paying well... my teeth are amazing which is one of the weirdest myths out there IMO.
But of course I can't help but think of what it's taken from me in terms of my potential.

All my friends are in jail that associate with that shit now. It's hard to hold down a relationship, romantic or not. I've been off it a month now or so but I know alcohol for example is a huge trigger for me, damn even my relationship with coffee scares the shit outta me.

Sorry for the rant. I guess there's a shitload of 'functional' addicts out there. No one would ever guess.
