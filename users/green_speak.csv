It belies an instinctual bias against being gay as well as perpetuating the notion that homosexuality=pedophilia. My disappointment really is of the same vein as when someone subconsciously remembers to check their purse/wallet only when PoC walk by.

In the company's defense, their return policy does state that visible creases on returned products may disqualify customers from a complete refund.

Off the top of my head, these colors are Terracotta, Arizona Adobe, and Burnished Copper; and you can even read past reviews of these colors stating that they crease and scuff easily.
