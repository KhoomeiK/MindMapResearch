braces,feyinqe,t1_feyhyyx,1579445964.0,Yeah I never had the chance until now to go. I didn‚Äôt know that about the tooth paste! I‚Äôll push the date back if I can‚Äôt get it done in time.
braces,feyhitf,t1_feyf8kc,1579445657.0,Yeah and I went to a dentist and just got a check up. He said I was good to go and just said I could get them cleaned whenever. She looked at that and looked at my teeth while taking pictures and said that we were good to go. But I never mentioned it had been a long time since I‚Äôve had a cleaning. I‚Äôm going to try my hardest to get in this week still.
braces,feyeuxo,t1_feyeqw7,1579444537.0,Okay thank you this is what I needed to hear!

HaircareScience,fehytz4,t1_fehyr2d,1579126625.0,Then who‚Äôs hair are you combing? I‚Äôm confused about your post
HaircareScience,fehyorf,t1_fehwx6f,1579126538.0,And that‚Äôs why you still got dandruff.
spongebob,fegutmv,t1_fegufzi,1579103028.0,I knew about the creepy pasta of squidwards episode or whatever. I was surprised. I had to say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs so silly why would they make him spooky‚Äù because my 5 year old was wondering why I paused it.
spongebob,fegu8pg,t3_ep09n8,1579102654.0,I just watched this a few weeks ago with my 5 year old. I really was caught off guard so I had to pause an rewind it‚Äôs to make sure. I thought it was neat that they‚Äôd do that lol considering the whole show is trash now.

EDAnonymous,feag9wf,t3_eo8kph,1578948348.0,Yeah I‚Äôve lost 55 & idk if I believe it... like sure my hands face feet are slimmer but why are my hips and gut still huge? If that‚Äôs 1lb then I want a refund because my pounds are not the same.
fatlogic,fdzcsim,t1_fdzarys,1578789028.0,Yeah it‚Äôs kinda sad. I remember as a kid how my mom would always say she could fit into a size 8 in high school. I always wanted to wear a size 8 just to rub it in her face but it doesn‚Äôt mean anything now and she‚Äôs morbidly obese now which is depressing too.
safe_food,fdyfn8q,t3_enad8m,1578779270.0,Amazing
fatlogic,fdyc17m,t1_fdy9jwn,1578778166.0,Wow I love being a petite potato.
fatlogic,fdy6zna,t1_fdy6lbe,1578776750.0,They are American eagle sizes... soo they could be super wrong. In another store I went to the same day I fit into a 13.. I just say 10 because does it even matter anymore. Also I don‚Äôt want to fit into them much longer. I‚Äôm trying to get these last 25 lbs off
fatlogic,fdy4ep0,t1_fdy4490,1578776019.0,Really? I didn‚Äôt think of it that way. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 so that explains it. Thanks for telling me this
fatlogic,fdy3zt1,t1_fdy2xnp,1578775860.0,"Whatever it is, it‚Äôs truly delusional lol"
fatlogic,fdy0fkc,t1_fdxa1n1,1578774733.0,My doctor calls me petite.. I‚Äôm overweight by BMI. I wear a size large shirts and pants. A size 10 in women‚Äôs jeans at 155lbs. But it always destroys me when my doctor who is obese calls me petite.
bluehairbitch,fdvlhq1,t3_en68ri,1578748667.0,She‚Äôs like that kid who went around and begged everyone at middle school for 1 dollar..
EDAnonymous,fdvl4nd,t1_fdvi7gq,1578748520.0,"Thanks I‚Äôm cured! Lol no really though, that‚Äôs the logical way to think about it. But logic is out the window with an ED"

quittingkratom,fdoiqmq,t3_emeab4,1578605964.0,Hey man!! I have been on kratom 3 years as well! Big doses and I cut it in half last week and had anxiety attacks for 4 days straight. So I went back up. I used meth and heroin mostly meth for a long time. I got off the meth with kratom 3 years ago not knowing I was just swapping drugs. I have BPD as well! I have never related to anything so much before! If you wanna talk message me. I‚Äôm hardly functioning myself and I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing but I managed to cut back 1/4 of what I was taking this last week. I haven‚Äôt been completely sober since I was probably 12 so some days it feels hopeless. But nobody said it has to be perfect. Just take care of you. You‚Äôll send yourself to an early grave with the meth. Just look into harm reduction. You know all the same shit everyone has to say. But if you wanna just talk shit shoot me a message. Xo hoping the best for you.
EDAnonymous,fdnsspd,t1_fdmrvt2,1578592114.0,I hope you go get looked at soon! Take care of yourself as best you can in the mean time. Xo

safe_food,fdl77ui,t1_fdl5urf,1578518217.0,Oh right I forget about a scale because mine is broken. I‚Äôm getting a new one soon because my food scale sucks so I‚Äôll have to try it another time. The cream cheese is probably what makes me so paranoid lol

BikiniBottomTwitter,fdjr6e5,t1_fdjjqk1,1578484389.0,They had them all on Hulu and my kid really enjoyed it last year. Once I noticed the plot I was sucked in. It was good and entertaining. I‚Äôd watch it again. I could never keep up with it on regularly scheduled tv though.

holdmyfries,fd90uws,t1_fd90fxd,1578226511.0,I think poverty and a poor upbringing screwed them from the start. They deserved a better mother and education.
spongebob,fd8zj3d,t1_fcymua7,1578225883.0,I found a spongebob pineapple house perfume at the 99¬¢ store and i put it in the bathroom. There was also squidwards house. I regret not getting them both. But they smell awful lol

Tucson,fcz11o9,t1_fcyzwd6,1578091533.0,It‚Äôs still in use I think. Last I saw in an interview she had a few people working from computers while the rest of the shipping warehouse was empty and wasn‚Äôt being used. The life sized characters are what I would love to see in person. They make me just as happy as they did when I was a kid.

EDAnonymous,fcp53w4,t3_eicrd3,1577850752.0,I hope you find the strength to forget about the binge. The purging is rotting my teeth. I‚Äôm so afraid to go to the dentist. Purging hasn‚Äôt helped me lose any weight any way. I gained 6 pounds this month. But that was ~15 binge days. One won‚Äôt do much harm to you. & plus maybe you‚Äôll poop! üëç

EDAnonymous,fcp3zqr,t3_eibpzp,1577849762.0,"I just learned about bobs red mill 13 bean soup mix. It has lentils, wild rice, beans. 1/4 of the bag makes about 665 calories and it‚Äôs kinda a lot of soup! I make it with 1 cup chicken broth (10)  and I‚Äôll add 45g. Chopped onion and 165g chopped carrots or whatever veggies I want. I‚Äôm going to make it tomorrow without any veggies I think, maybe spinach. But god that stuff is SO FILLING and I love beans. It takes only 2-3 hours of simmering. But it can give you gas so bad but it helps my stomach get moving. Your post makes me want to try lentils now! I‚Äôm always so afraid of things like that"
