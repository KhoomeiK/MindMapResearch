NoStupidQuestions,ff0ogk6,t1_fewupwn,1579470787.0,"So, I started as a Digital Content Writer, which is articles and stuff across our 14 websites. We‚Äôd have meeting to generate content and how we‚Äôd adhere to SEO. Google analytics, etc, etc. 

I work for a major healthcare company in the United States. I was promoted to Digital Content Specialist, and my Director of Marketing would come to me for  special projects seeing how dependable I‚Äôd become. 

From that point forward, we had a freelance copywriter, but the Director of Media didn‚Äôt like to ask him for simple projects because it‚Äôd cost a lot for a small piece. I told her I‚Äôm available for anything she needs, and she started submitting me small projects. 

Once they saw that I was better than the freelancer and still completing my other responsibilities, they fired him and fed me copy projects. Eventually I was promoted to Copywriter, then within three months we hired another full-time copywriter, which pushed me to Sr and a nice pay bump. It was a lot of hard work, but now I have that official title for life. It‚Äôs much less responsibility than a director with near the same pay. 

Now I work remotely and took my wife on a four to five month trip through Europe. :)"

I grew up in the SFV, and it is a shell of what it once was. As my Mom has gotten older, she‚Äôs developed agoraphobia because she‚Äôs *that*  afraid our house will be burglarized. We‚Äôve literally dig holes into our foundation to put our valuables. Mind you, I grew up on the west side of town, which has always been known as higher end. I used to see Bruce Jenner every morning at my local Starbucks. 

I picked up, moved to Miami for a year, now I‚Äôve moved onto Nashville. While nothing is perfect, the town Im in (Franklin) has almost no crime. It‚Äôs safe. Police are allowed to do their jobs. Downtown Nashville has its negatives, of course, but overall I‚Äôm much happier with the move I made.
