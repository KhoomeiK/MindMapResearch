>Just... one day when the ice receded, people decided to stay still, start farming, chart the stars, build megalithic structures...and then the culture to decay instead of advancing...

This is extremely well studied and doesn't bear any resemblance to how you've characterized it. Civilization didn't spring forth fully formed one day for inexplicable reasons. It developed very gradually during the late Pleistocene and the early Holocene at various points in time for different peoples as a response to demographic, technological, and sociocultural trends.

The extremely condensed version is that the environmental perturbations caused by the close of the Pleistocene in conjunction with expanded human populations, resulted in the extinction of many species of megafauna. This forced people to pursue smaller and more labor intensive prey items as each became more and more scarce. As large bodied animals declined in frequency, less valuable items picked up a more important place on the menu of foragers. Thus, people moved from mammoths down the line to mass capure of rabbits and intensive processing of grasses which were previously not worth dealing with. This required more stuff (nets for trapping small game, grinding stones for processing plants, storage jars or baskets for seeds, etc.) than hunting big game and it was increasingly difficult to move around with it. It was also less necessary to follow big game migration so more circular patterns emerged, returning to the same place over and over. This process is called the broad spectrum revolution and has been intensively studied and documented on six continents. It's not a mystery. We know it happened.

Over time, it started to pay off to gather the marginally valuable plants that grew in the last site you disturbed. People began making small adjustments to ensure things would grow, and a reliable food source would be present upon their return to an old camp. Typically these species are annuals that are early colonizers of disturbed habitats (a description that fits for every early plant species which was domesticated) which grew in old camps disturbed and cleared by humans during their last visit. Fast forward a few thousand years and people are spending more and more time tending these plants. The plants have been selected for properties like larger edible parts which are less likely to fall on the ground during harvest. People developed technologies (independently of one another both spatially and temporally) to store and process different foods (pottery, mills, etc.) and this allows for storage of surplus foods. It also allows you to feed babies who would otherwise be breastfeeding since you can make mushy gruels. This drastically increases the population and speeds up the process by increasing dependence on agriculture. More farming is needed to support more people.

Storage of excess also allows for wealth disparities. This is novel since it's not possible to gather a bunch of stuff and hold onto it for long periods of time in a hunter gatherers community. These wealth disparities allow for differentiation of classes and specialization. If someone can pay others in food, they can get them to do something other than farming. You quickly get laborers to build stuff, artisans to make specialized stuff, performers, and an explosion of religious and cultural figures with highly specialized roles. Food can get moved around and taken from farms to the people who eat it. Thus, cities form to support the people who aren't farmers. Economic interactions grow more complex and you need a system to keep track of it, so writing emerges. Again, none of this is a mystery. It has been intensively studied and documented in remote and disconnected regions with no evidence of common origin from a prior civilization. We *know* this is how it happened. 

There is still some quibbling over details, but the broad strokes are so well documented and supported that the notions of ice age civilizations being the origin of disparate civilizations is beyond ludicrous. There is a mountain of evidence documenting the standard process of intensification and precisely zero evidence for these civilizations. Whenever this is pointed out, the proponents of these fantasies point to the sea and concoct a completely unsupportable Atlantean fantasy that has swallowed all the evidence which should be apparent. It's nonsense."
MapPorn,fdhitx0,t1_fdhf2s8,1578423557.0,"We know the rates of sea level rise based on the formation of reefs at different depths in different places. You can examine, and precisely date, the formation of these reefs at different depths to determine rates of sea level rise. This is how we know that sea level rose quite quickly leading to the Younger Dryas period, then fell, then rose again. We also know of several periods of very gradual change in the middle Holocene.

At no point would these changes have been perceptible within a human lifetime and there is no potential for catastrophic rises to have wiped out past evidence of civilization. The much simpler explanation is that hose civilizations never existed."
MapPorn,fdhi65w,t1_fdh6b33,1578423158.0,"This is all psuedoscience, though. Dating based on erosion patterns is not at all accurate and also isn't relevant. Nobody disputes the age of Göbekli Tepe. That isn't the point. The point is that it doesn't particularly matter whether it was constructed just prior to the start of the Holocene or just after, because it's consistent with our current understanding of the period. It's a tell site which we know develop over the course of thousands of years. 'Burial' of the site isn't exactly accurate as tells form from the gradual disintegration of stucco which forms a low mound over the course of thousands of years of human occupation. The oldest portions of the site are not exceptionally large and it's not unreasonable to suspect that they were constructed by hunter gatherers. It's not enough evidence to upend the prevalent theories and it is largely consistent with what we already know. There are hundreds of similar sites that developed within the next one to two thousand years.

It's extremely suspect that Robert Schoch has interpreted some water erosion on the Sphinx (which other geologists and nearly ever archaeologist report to be possible given the generally accepted timeline) to be evidence for a civilization in the Sahara during the ice age. Not a single artifact supports this position and the claim is, therefore, not at all credible.

Randall Carlson's sacred geometry claims are insane nonsense that could easily have been taken off the Goop website. There is no evidence to back up any of his claims and he's a psuedoscientist. You may have liked his presentation, but it isn't science and he has no data to support it.

Again, if you'd like to learn about archaeology, a podcast that hosts Sasquatch hunters probably isn't the best place to start. Hancock, Schoch, and Carlson are kooks who have not presented sufficient evidence to support their wild claims."
MapPorn,fdgxe8b,t1_fdgvc5x,1578410675.0,"Domestication is a necessary step in the development of agriculture. Crops are domesticated plants. No, agriculture didn't spring up everywhere all at once and it isn't just because it took a long time to develop. Grains were domesticated and an important staple in the Middle East thousands of years before the domestication of corn even started in the New World. The idea that agriculture just sprang into existence simply isn't true.

It's also not true to suggest that hunter gatherers couldn't build large structures. Yes, Göbekli Tepe is an interesting site, but it isn't revolutionary and it largely tells the same story we know from Catal Huyuk and other sites on the region. We also have megaliths constructed in other regions by hunter gatherers (Stonehenge comes to mind). None of these sites suggest that cities existed in the ice age. They suggest that societal complexity can arise in certain forms in the absence of intensive agriculture, but we already knew this. There is ample ethnographic evidence from the Pacific Northwest which demonstrates large aggregations of people with complex community structures can live in the absence of agriculture given the right conditions. We've known about it for centuries, and these ideas are Incorporated in modern archaeological theories and writings.

Traditional Maya religious beliefs have very little in common with Christianity, and though Catholicism is tolerant of syncretism, that has little to do with the history of the relationship between the Maya and colonial powers.

There were prolonged and bloody fights between the Spanish and the Maya for nearly two centuries before the Maya were fully conquered. After that, there were rebellions against colonial rule that lasted for two more centuries, and which arguably continue today (though in a very different form). 

It's not as well known as the Conquest of Mexico because it's a much more complex story. The Maya were never a unified political entity like the Aztec or Inca Empires. For close to 5,000 years Maya polities have competed against one another for status and power within a framework of regional alliances. This meant that the Spanish couldn't simply conquer the ruler of the capital city (as they did with Moctezuma and Atahualpa). In the absence of a hierarchical leadership, the Spaniards were forced to conquer the highlands of Guatemala one village at a time which took decades. In the lowlands, the Spanish sucked at simply existing in a tropical forest and didn't invest as much in subjugating local peoples in large part because there were few easily extractable resources. They didn't manage to fully conquer the lowlands until the late 17th century.

Even after the formal conquest ended, there were frequent and bloody rebellions, the most famous of which is the Yucatán Caste War which lasted for decades and dragged into the early 20th century. Even today, though the movement is based around socialism and has a Catholic bent, indigenous rebellion continues with the Zapatistas in Chiapas.

As for the diseases in cities aspect, some of the Maya lived in cities, but they were much smaller than the cities of the Inca to the south or the Aztecs to the north. Cities often had catastrophic population collapses due to the large number of people living in close quarters who could easily transmit the novel diseases introduced by Spaniards. Having lived in an area with high rates of disease transmission may have helped them develop cultural practices to avoid disease, but it wouldn't have provided them much resistance against smallpox. Smallpox and other diseases ravaged Aztec, Maya, and Inca cities and did so in a manner which was often more deadly than what occurred in North America."

science,fc2urvi,t1_fc2u38f,1577374608.0,">When it comes to reality, poor and uneducated people see girls as a big burden and expensive due to a lot of rituals associated with them and the cost of getting them married that includes dowries and host of other crap after they are married also. Male children are preferred since they don't have as much cost associated with them and are also seen as someone who will stay with them and take care parents when they are old. Also, traditionally property gets divided among men and since they stayed in a joint family with parents the ancestral property doesn't get divided with outsider who marry the women.

Everything you've described here *is* institutionalized misogyny. Dowries, divisions of property which exclude women, costs of rituals being transferred exclusively to the families of women...all of that perfectly encapsulates a form of institutionalized misogyny. They are emblematic of cultural values which view women as burdens rather than contributors to society."
science,fc2rvfl,t1_fc2rje6,1577372215.0,Exactly. It's likely that female infanticide rates and negative views of lesbians both stem from underlying misogynistic cultural norms. There's no reason to believe one causes the other.
