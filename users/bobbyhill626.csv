GetMotivated,ff4gqjd,t1_ff416x0,1579563211.0,"Unreliable? Aside from Land Rover, high end FCA vehicles, and certain BMWs like the mid 2000s 5 series, they’re all reliable in the sense that you guys are using, that it can transport you from point A to point B. They have that unreliable stigma due to how much more advanced they are compared to base model economy cars. There’s more stuff to break, like your rear sunshade won’t go up, your 12 way reclining seat won’t adjust one position, your DCT transmission is acting up. All of those are negatives when you think about cost to repair, but if there’s no problems then you have a car that’s a step above the rest. As for the price of parts, you’re paying for higher quality parts. A rear bumper for a corolla will be a couple hundred bucks tops, where as a bumper for your Tesla or whatnot will be just under 1k due to the amount of sensors and safety equipment."
GetMotivated,ff4ckcx,t1_ff41oix,1579560430.0,"Ah yes, because a base model Chevy, Hyundai, Ford, or Toyota totally has all the same safety and tech features, drivetrain, power, and build quality as a BMW. You clearly know everything about the auto industry."

television,fensno4,t1_fen71e2,1579290112.0,"This is the exact reason I went from hating psychics to admiring them. There was a Dateline episode about the “Sweetheart Swinddlers”. A pair of psychics convinced a man to spend like 750k over a few years because they made him believe his only way of finding love was through using them. At first I was angry at them, but the more it went on, I just realized that the guy is a total moron. The only reason this was on tv is because the moron had a lot of money. It’s not the psychics fault that he chose to go broke because he actually believed in that crystal ball bullshit. My dream is to do the same line of work, whether it’s making stupid MAGA gear to sell to those gullible mouth breathers, or something like Goops products.
