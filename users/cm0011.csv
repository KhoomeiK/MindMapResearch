SmashBrosUltimate,ffaqhqv,t3_esckti,1579742112.0,You’re missing the many ‘mons in Smash in that picture 😏
NintendoSwitch,ffakb4y,t1_ff9r44z,1579737858.0,"Not all pre-orders are a roomies to buy. EB Games lets you preorder without even putting any money down for it, you could just choose not to pick it up. But that’s also for physicals so different rules."

NintendoSwitch,ffajufn,t1_ff9uapg,1579737526.0,Then the demo would probably be 10-15 minutes.
NintendoSwitch,ffajoi4,t1_ff9hyjs,1579737409.0,"I preorder physical - sure, I can’t play at 12 (unless there’s a midnight release which I sometimes go to), but I usually like waiting until the next day, going to pick it up after work, and just playing all night."

NintendoSwitch,ffajdj3,t1_ffahmus,1579737181.0,"I think they should honestly, especially considering how controversial the game was. “I think this game is crap.” is quite different than “This game is crap.”"
NintendoSwitch,ffaj5e9,t1_ffae6my,1579737013.0,I think people got burnt out by so much of the opposite before and have become defensive - people were ripped apart and downvoted to hell if they said something positive about the game.
NintendoSwitch,ffaiz0t,t1_ffa8ere,1579736881.0,Don’t preloads get fully downloaded and are just inaccessible until time of release?

apple,ff3k1sp,t1_ff37fmq,1579542707.0,"OLED is often not enough to make people switch out of the Apple ecosystem. The iPhone X introduced it to them. It is true that after experiencing it, it is a bit hard to go back. But yes, the iPhone 11 is a great price and the lack of OLED is not a massive deal, but for some people (me included) it would feel odd not having it after having an OLED phone. I have a XS Max and will likely continue with whatever “Pro Max” variant of iPhone exists when I decide to trade in (will skip the iphone 11 series though)."

aww,feldm7a,t3_epli8t,1579219696.0,I've never related to something so much in my entire life.
fireemblem,feldfl4,t1_fekxnu5,1579219574.0,It's literally because they can. They'll be mad because they want to and don't realize they aren't the only smash players that exist.
fireemblem,feld9ji,t1_fekyzb8,1579219461.0,"Smash people have had plenty of time to be won over, they just don't care about FE and never will.   
If you look at the ratio, there are actually more Mario and Pokemon characters than FE characters. Considering it's a Nintendo IP, I think FE should have a large representation for their fans."
fireemblem,feld43p,t3_epkjv9,1579219360.0,Is this real? PLEASE tell me this is real! I am getting overwhelmed with the amount of beautiful Fire Emblem news we are getting today.
fireemblem,felc98c,t1_fejvp8v,1579218792.0,So that's why it was so familiar!
fireemblem,felc7fi,t1_fejv3gx,1579218759.0,I know I cried tears of joy.
fireemblem,felc5oy,t1_fejxqfb,1579218727.0,"It sounded like a fifth route to me. It's like they're asking you (Byleth) to be their pseudo-instructor (""take them under your wing""), and you're supposed to ""get them out""? Maybe it's not a route with a pre and post time skip like the other four, but a fifth route none the less?"

Also I've been waiting forever to understand what the heck the ""Abyss"" was, beyond just getting ""Trade Secrets"" for Anna all the time."
SmashBrosUltimate,fel5fe9,t1_fejt0oa,1579214448.0,That’s your opinion. It’s not Sakurai’s fault that you don’t play Fire Emblem and don’t know that person’s name. These Fire Emblem characters mean a lot to other people.
SmashBrosUltimate,fel59pc,t3_epk0i9,1579214350.0,"Thank you for being the only reasonable person on this sub, and realizing that there are many people that are excited for this release, and that we stood by happily while people like Persona, Banjo, Hero, and others were announced, happy that others got things they wanted, but now have to watch people riot because their favourite character was added."
SmashBrosUltimate,fel4olg,t1_fejsd8o,1579213987.0,I’m happy! I’m so happy!! I love 3 Houses and have been waiting for them to appear as a DLC. We exist 😁
SmashBrosUltimate,fel4kov,t1_feju5tz,1579213921.0,"Oh I’m SUPER excited, I’ve been waiting for this, regardless of what anyone says. And I know plenty of people were too. At least everyone got at least one fighter they’re happy with."
SmashBrosUltimate,fel4eek,t3_epjxqr,1579213816.0,"Guess I’m gonna be in the minority again where I’m ecstatic that they added Byleth and FE 3 Houses to Smash. The Smash community always gets mad when FE characters get added, even when 3 Houses was a huge success, guess I shouldn’t have expected differently."
SmashBrosUltimate,fel48pp,t1_fejsew3,1579213719.0,"No, trust me - they would’ve been angry no matter what."
SmashBrosUltimate,fel43lf,t1_fejsavh,1579213632.0,FE 3 Houses was a huge success. Did you REALLY expect them not to put at least one character from it? You know how many people are happy about this? I don’t think this is a ridiculous option at all.

Definitely a comment that primarily female lecturers will receive, because subconscious sexism. Female lecturers get an inordinately larger amount of comments that have to do with “tone”, “status”, and “authority”. As a female in academia, this frustrates me and I feel the struggle."

It seems to always sync the total amount I’ve spent on the card, but nothing else."
MapleStoryM,fdu7a0l,t1_fdtm54l,1578728827.0,Same. Though I quit pretty quickly. Realized a lot of the fun I had was when I still had people to play with. I don’t have the time to sink 17 hours a day with friends like I used to.
