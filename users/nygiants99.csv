barstoolsports,ff7sf6q,t1_ff6nfun,1579657231.0,Smells like Pres is scared. Sad. Thought Pres would embrace a 4 inch dick pic in pink underwear.
phish,ff3scf6,t1_ff3ro6e,1579547798.0,"Actually I am not trying to confuse the issue, I want to gain some clarity as to your point. 1) Are the Beatles a cover band? and 2) What band, by your definition, is not a cover band? Or are juggling multiple thoughts at once too much for you to handle?"
phish,ff3rd7m,t1_ff3o204,1579547199.0,Were the Beatles a cover band? What band isn't a cover band by your plainly idiotic definition?

politics,ff0s4a4,t1_ff0436o,1579471744.0,"Why hasn't anyone said a peep about this prior to Bernie raising the issue if it was THAT obvious. Either no one cared, or it wasnt some 40 year long campaign."
politics,ff0rg5s,t1_ff00rvo,1579471613.0,"Not commenting on the actual crux of the issue, but it's hilarious how once Bernie brought up the social security thing, it is being repeated NONSTOP here. Like if anyone was actually all so concerned with it and it was such ""life-long dream"", why didn't anyone speak about prior to this?"
politics,ff0h4ol,t3_er2hba,1579468852.0,It's actually comical that democrats have allowed this talking point to gain momentum. Why in the WORLD would Hunter Biden ever testify at Trump's impeachment trial. It's completely irrelevant.

barstoolsports,fevl35i,t1_fev64nx,1579398695.0,Similar to the adderall Trump snorts to ensure that his ill-educated fanboys can't pick up on his end-stage dementia.

barstoolsports,fenc6kx,t1_fenbluy,1579281550.0,Britt. The one who had to compete w Kaitlyn to be bachelorette.

barstoolsports,feka9ns,t1_fek99cu,1579195859.0,I'd remove the borderline. Insane a parent would ever allow their child to look like that.
barstoolsports,fek5ade,t1_fek4qp7,1579192906.0,You must really hold people to some standard then huh? Can't imagine what your resume looks like.

nba,fehvq2m,t1_fehtqno,1579124818.0,"I think he's just referring to what the younger generation gets distracted by. The context is that he has invited people to work out with him and nobody ever takes him up on the offer. Wasn't really a dig at the younger generation per se (at least in my opinion), but more an overall dig at players not putting in the extra effort."
nba,fefl26b,t1_fefkwbs,1579058599.0,You think Goldman doesn’t hire entry level positions? Listen I don’t care to convince you one way or the other. Enjoy.
nba,fefkz5n,t1_fefhlb1,1579058546.0,Yes of course. Not saying it comes close to getting you a job. Just saying that having WNBA on your resume along with a good college degree and some intelligence and you at least have a foot in the door.
nba,fefcydw,t1_fefcoeq,1579053631.0,"I’m talking like JPMorgan, Citi, Goldman, etc. These entry level positions require minimal specialization - especially on like client side of stuff. Not sure what point you’re trying to drive home."
nyc,fef19fg,t1_fef0u86,1579045807.0,"I actually wasn't referring to you not being born in NYC, just the idiots that upvoted you. Additionally, your experiences are absurd and hard to believe. You have never seen a nonwhite person jump the turnstile or walk past the bus driver? Sure. I have to assume you just live and work in a neighborhood that is mostly nonwhite because otherwise it is clear you're lying."
nba,feeo0ug,t1_fee66hv,1579037633.0,"Hard, hard disagree. If you actually have a degree from a good college and are halfway intelligent banks/financial institutions loveeeeee to hire former athletes."
worldnews,feej6v3,t1_fedl6se,1579034833.0,Actually a horrible analogy. More apt would be a bartender over-serving the drunk driver.
barstoolsports,fedyjar,t1_fedxuta,1579022594.0,My favorite part of Jerry's stupid fucking posts is how he thinks of himself as some lawyer when he was basically a court butler.

politics,fedxrvf,t1_fedwvp3,1579022135.0,He made up a lie that the first black president wasn't American. He said he had proof!
nyc,fedmv6w,t1_fedhv1h,1579015391.0,"Yup, a lot of right wing trolls and racists have a bizarre obsession with NYC and their self worth revolves around this made up belief that NYC is some dystopian nightmare."
nyc,fedg0lx,t1_fecccts,1579010518.0,Just take a quick gander through the person's comments. They obviously aren't all there upstairs. Hilarious this idiot is upvoted though.
politics,feddw35,t1_feddaq2,1579008785.0,Lol so your answer is “I won’t answer.” $2800 donors and an entry level job.

politics,fe9ssj6,t1_fe9l2ys,1578941168.0,Definitely think this would be the best idea. How it operates now makes little to no sense.
politics,fe98a14,t1_fe97a1x,1578935270.0,"He's saying they should not be important and he's correct in that assertion. How does it make any sense that any two states, let alone two states as racially/ethnically homogeneous as Iowa and NH, have such elevated importance in nominating the Dem candidate for Pres?"

barstoolsports,fdiii1v,t1_fdif58l,1578443671.0,Just say your feet get a tad bit sore after extended walks.
barstoolsports,fdf4b9f,t1_fdeh244,1578352991.0,What’s amazing is he use to go in on Pres about his hair. KFC’s is approximately a billion times worse right now.
nfl,fdb6b35,t3_ekg3f9,1578254314.0,Is Diggs shadily one of the biggest divas in the NFL? Really think he’d bitch if vikes won the Super Bowl and he went catchless.
nfl,fd75fvi,t1_fd74uxd,1578199668.0,I mean the guy has got a point no? You think Brady is going to get any better? At a certain point it makes sense for the pats to move on.  Brady is on the wrong side of 40. Definitely  arguable if BB wants to undertake a rebuild though.
nfl,fd66z8u,t1_fd48t8v,1578186430.0,Not really though. You’re sort of missing the point. If Sherman really believed in himself you negotiate player options in there. It’s a bad deal.
nfl,fd47bfs,t1_fd46zxx,1578165008.0,"Referring to the structure of the contract as the gamble, not the incentives."
nfl,fd3ykg6,t1_fd320c1,1578162781.0,They have looked like absolute dog shit. No way they make it past next week.
nfl,fd3vsyl,t1_fd3sfrt,1578162077.0,But that’s like saying putting all your money on a number on roulette is a good bet after it hits. It doesn’t make the original bet wise.
nfl,fczjgqa,t1_fczi97m,1578102581.0,I really don’t think players negotiating their own contracts is remotely viable. Sherman is probably one of the more intelligent guys in the NFL and negotiated a bad deal for himself (regardless of his twitter pouting). Reminds me of middle aged men coaching from the couch (or on Reddit).
nfl,fczfvev,t1_fczeual,1578100341.0,"Agreed. Florio acting like a bit of a baby, but stunning so many people are blindly taking Sherman’s side."
nfl,fcze7zg,t1_fczcosu,1578099202.0,"Can someone explain to me why people are killing Florio over this? I agree with him? I guess no need to go at Sherman over it, but still his point is correct."
nfl,fczdr4s,t1_fcykkli,1578098913.0,"Yeah, but there are better ways to bet on yourself no? Good for Sherman for negotiating his own contract, but I’d have to imagine an agent does better there."
barstoolsports,fcyyh3i,t1_fcyxxrz,1578089874.0,Crazy to me so many racist people just can’t admit they’re racist. It’s an Internet forum - may feel good to finally say it into the void. Take some pride in your idiotic beliefs.
barstoolsports,fcywsk4,t1_fcywkae,1578088796.0,Victor right on cue with a racist take.
barstoolsports,fcxhhwq,t1_fcxf7xb,1578063054.0,"I mean pretty simple - the hardline liberals (bernie or bust crew, etc, etc) have always been against these drone strikes and have become especially critical of Obama as time has passed. Just don't think most ""libs"" would be cheering, but to each their own."
barstoolsports,fcxezq5,t1_fcxejad,1578061186.0,Hard disagree.
politics,fcvycv9,t1_fcvxlhs,1578012904.0,But he did eventually say the both sides quote no? And the context doesn’t help the issue whatsoever. How can there be good people walking in step with neo nazis chanting “jews will not replace us”? Any “good person” immediately leaves.

phish,fct4h4d,t1_fcst8ea,1577932642.0,My one thought would be that MSG probably shares/takes majority of liability if anything was to happen while he’s suspended up there and that they would force him down immediately. The reason I lean gag.
phish,fcr4150,t1_fcpgpxf,1577896460.0,Bro you think if there was an actual issue they would have let trey stay up there? And if something happened while he was stuck? MSG brass would have stopped show immediately if it were real. Honestly shocked so many people think it was real.
phish,fcpf7yr,t1_fcpeu4k,1577861368.0,Trey planned to get stuck...
politics,fcnzdx9,t1_fcnvgm7,1577821330.0,Im fine with him.
nyc,fcnngkq,t3_ei0m7i,1577814819.0,Not sure why everyone in this thread is acting like New Years Eve is end of days stuff. Obviously don't do the ball drop. Just try your hand at a bunch of dive bars (and go relatively early because of your ID situation) and hope for the best. Worst comes to worst you get shut out.

todayilearned,fc0ne51,t1_fc0mews,1577295178.0,Not really that good in theory and sure as shit wouldn’t work in practice. Experts are hired to evaluate cases by law firms wayyyyy prior to trial.
