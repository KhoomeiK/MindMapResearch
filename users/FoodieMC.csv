TumblrInAction,ff8xj8i,t3_es96se,1579699314.0,"75% of women suffer from disordered eating?

This article gives about 4-18% for women 
https://www.mirasol.net/amp/learning-center/eating-disorder-statistics.html

This article gives:

When researchers followed a group of 496 adolescent girls for 8 years, until they were 20, they found: 

5.2% of the girls met criteria for DSM5 anorexia, bulimia, or binge eating disorder. 
When the researchers included nonspecific eating disorder symptoms, a total of 13.2% of the girls had suffered from a DSM-5 eating disorder by age 20.

https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/statistics-research-eating-disorders

And this last one says:

It is estimated that 1.0% to 4.2% of women have suffered from anorexia in their lifetime.

It is estimated that up to 4% of females in the United States will have bulimia during their lifetime

https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/information/statistics studies

So it looks like the stats are between 4-18%. 

I found 75% of women here https://abcnews.go.com/Health/Healthday/story?id=4726783&page=1

But it doesn't look very credible, was done by an online poll, said that:

Nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of young American women report disordered eating behaviors, and 10 percent report symptoms of eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder, a new survey finds.

Honestly I'm not inclined to believe a news website that has it's stats from an online poll."
