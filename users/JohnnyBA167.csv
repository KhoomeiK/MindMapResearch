AskReddit,ff9759v,t1_ff954qq,1579706415.0,Well for me there were six or seven plot lines left unexplained that were hyped as very important. Dang turning full Hitler in two episodes was ridiculous. Bran I am the three eyed raven I can’t be the head of the Starks. Oh I’m gonna be king. The long night lasted 12 hours cmon...  I was not upset because it didn’t end the way I wanted. If the night king had killed everyone I would have been ok. But that bullshit ending was just bad writing. “I don’t wan it!!” Jon Snow brilliant!

LouderWithCrowder,ff67j35,t3_ersou5,1579620987.0,I worked at one of the first hospitals to have an EMR. I remember thinking that while our version was self contained and had no connection to the internet it would eventually. I raised my concerns even though I was but a worker bee. I was told that that would never happen no one could get access to the records. Well fast forward twenty years and now it workers are working from home using these records and now these tech companies that only want to profit are getting control. I believe this was inevitable but still kinda worrisome. It will be interestingly see where this ends up.

AskReddit,fetd3uh,t3_eqkf3y,1579374085.0,"I worked at a hospital years ago. I wasn’t in the clinical side I worked medical records. Occasionally I needed to take a chart to the ER and one time I saw a trail of blood from the entrance to a room. I asked about it and was told I didn’t want to know. I did tho. So apparently an older man that had a catheter in had stepped on it when he was walking. The catheter had an inflated bulb to keep it inside the bladder. He yanked that sucker right out, hence the blood trail. I still feel funny thinking about it."

I have been waiting for any politician to finally stand up them. That have been killing our military through proxy terrorist for decades. I for one don’t think they can do much of anything to us except what they have been doing. Ask Gaddafi how that worked out for him in the eighties. Like it or not we are the world’s sheriff. I’m not a huge fan of it but if we are then we should do it in a way they understand.

The Jews because they killed Christ, there were exceptions for Jews that believe in Jesus. But the blacks were going to hell because, get this, Cain killed Able and apparently Cain was black.

I remember the humiliation of the Iran hostage crisis. I remember the dozens of bombings done to our citizens overseas. When 9/11/2001 happened I thought we should of gone after Iran not Iraq. For various reasons I get why we went into Iraq instead. But for forty years Iran has been poking the bear, well the bear finally got tired of their shit. The next target might be the Ayatollahs. Will Iran go to open war with the US ? They’ve already been at war with us just haven’t declared it openly. I don’t think much will change."

He offered to train some people that carried and guarded the church during services. They quickly found out that shooting paper targets is just the beginning. The person shot while tragic could of had more training. After action criticism is for learning not making fun of. Everyone thinking of doing that job dam well better take it seriously. Yes he was brave and his sacrifice is honorable but more training and he might still be alive. One other thing that was an absolutely awesome headshot under stress.
