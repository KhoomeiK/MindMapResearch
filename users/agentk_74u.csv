DnDHomebrew,fezo7oi,t3_equ4s8,1579459588.0,"As others have mentioned I would say you should bring the damage to d8s. That said, I don't see a reason to not allow you to expend all (or a lot of) your charges at once, but here's how I would change it to prevent one hit kills on everything:

""When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you may expend any number of charges up to your CHA modifier. The weapon deals an extra 2d8 radiant damage plus 1d8 radiant damage for every charge spent past the first."""

UnearthedArcana,fek73om,t1_fek69b9,1579193981.0,"If people are saying it could be a first level spell and others are saying it should be a third level one, then you just might have the balance on point!   


My personal opinion is that it could be 1st level because there are 1st level spells that give bonuses to more than one character. Main example I can think of off the top of my head is Bless which gives a +1-4 to all attack rolls and saving throws to three characters (IIRC it does take concentration, however)."
UnearthedArcana,feiqvux,t3_ep4s67,1579144939.0,This could easily be a 1st level spell. Giving someone an effective +5 to their initiative roll at the expense of a spell slot and your reaction is not all that powerful.

AskReddit,fedpbj3,t1_fecslky,1579016961.0,"Yes it was. In California to be specific. 

It is also highly unlikely that any one person be raped, murdered, or attacked by a shark but people are still wary when walking around alone at night or swimming in the ocean. Dismissing a legitimate concern like this by saying it is too rare to worry about is not going to make anyone more accepting or less wary. 

I'm not seeing much hate, but I am seeing people who are wary of the possibility. While I can't say I share the same wariness as them, I can understand their point of view. Nobody wants to be ""tricked"" into having sex with someone they don't want to, transgender or otherwise."

AskReddit,fec63ny,t1_feb0cwe,1578967253.0,"Something similar to this situation happened to a buddy of mine when I was in the service. Went to a hotel with two women he met at a bar. One went to the bathroom and he and the other woman got started. After a few minutes the other woman comes out and it turns out she's a pre-op transgendered woman and her friend was trying to get her laid by luring men with the promise of a threesome. He left immediately without saying a word. 

Just because you haven't heard of it happening doesn't mean it never does. Since it does happen it is not an irrational fear."
