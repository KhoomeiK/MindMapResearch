He's all about ""if it feels good, do it"" (and to hell with everyone else like my 13 year old son).  He abandoned his teen son to go fuck prostitutes in asia.  He was nothing but a sex tourist.   He makes bad choices bc they're easy and he's all about making himself feel good.  I can't stand that disgusting, manipulative fraud.  Only a matter of time until he's non ambulatory and draining the system."

I think the best she has done is $450 in a month.  That's better than nothing but that is gross, not net.  It is very, very difficult to be a successful seller on ebay...you either have to have volume, high end, or unique items.   It also requires a lot of time.  Ebay at one time was trying to position themselves as a way to for an average Joe to work from home, and in many ways, was worse than a MlM.  I would say the average person doesn't really appreciate the amount of time and effort that goes into being a small business owner.   It is a 24/7 job.  I have tremendous admiration for people who can run their own small business, but I prefer being able to leave my work at work"
