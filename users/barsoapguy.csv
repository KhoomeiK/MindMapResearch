I disagree that violence never solves violence , one of the reasons Nation states even exist is to be the sole executioner of violence.  The Goverment should be the only one who has a right to kill anyone and anyone who oppose that right is generally dealt with , this is part of the Social contract and why we have a word for ""crime"" .  You should read the Levithan by Hobbes  sometime , it really clarifies  Goverments and violence etc  

Not all police states are ineffective in controlling violent crime , the regime in Saudi Arabia has the death penalty for several offenses , they will even cut off your hand for stealing . 

Because of the Draconian nature of their laws the society is considered ""safe"" , same goes for Singapore. So there are completely effective police states . Not to mention that even the worst police states have some limits... the state cops can't just go around blasting everyone in sight day after day . Think of Lybia ruled by Gaddafi and then the anarchy that followed after his fall . Those who fought against him now yearn for the stability brought about by his police state.
