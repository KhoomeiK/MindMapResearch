My grandmas recipe is the only one I truly love. As a family we have tried to make ghormeh sabzi 4 times and then we just gave up. It is so hard to make and definitely a polarizing dish. I must say, I think gheymeh is my favorite meal right now, in all of its variations. I wish I could cook anything. I’m so jealous you make fesenjoon and ghalieh sabzi. I bet they are delicious."

SkincareAddiction,ff89xta,t3_es78hh,1579670388.0,"Should I be double cleansing if I’m at home all day and not in the sun? A lot of days I don’t use any product on my face but still wash and moisturize at night. I always use sunblock when going out and I will double cleanse after applying sunblock or makeup. I was using Tata Harper oil, but it was too fragrant and irritated my mild rosacea. Does anyone have a good recommendation? I was thinking of the Farmacy melting balm or Drunk Elephant butter cleanser. Thx"

with all our hearts. You’re going to be sad and you’re going to miss him for a while. But then you’ll remember how sweet he was and how much you loved him and it won’t hurt as much. I don’t think people realize how much you can love a guinea pig. People think dogs and cats are the only animals that we truly connect with. You know that’s not true. They are funny, sweet, silly, cuddly, and loving pets. He’s luck to have had you as his human."
