> The ACA **cut out-of-pocket costs for all families**, but those cuts meant more for families that earn less, researchers found.

[But also](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6077893/):

> We find that the national implementation of the ACA’s insurance expansion provisions in 2014 was associated with improvements in health care–related financial strain, access, and utilization. Relative to adults earning more than 400% of the FPL, the largest effects were observed among those earning between 0% to 124% and 125% to 199% of the FPL after the implementation of the ACA. Both groups experienced reductions in disparities in financial strain and uninsurance relative to the highest FPL group. Overall, the ACA has attenuated health care–related financial strain and improved access to and the utilization of health services for low- and middle-income adults who have traditionally not met income eligibility requirements for public insurance programs.

Foodforthought,feta2ul,t3_eq9m6i,1579373189.0,"This article makes a lot of good points. Particularly the one that says Bernie actually is a seasoned political veteran. He may have taken lonely ideological stands in the past -- and it's what he's known for -- but when his vote was needed for crucial pieces of incremental (and imperfect) legislation, he was there. He knows how the machine works and how to operate it.

At the end of the day, I actually don't have that many concerns about electability of any of the major candidates bar Buttigieg. I think they all have their strengths that play to their advantage against Trump.

What I do worry about, however, is what a President Sanders' administration looks like. I worry that his foreign policy is basically akin to isolationism. I don't want endless wars in the Middle East. But I also don't want the US shying away from international engagement that may involve the military. There are ways to navigate the use of a limited military presence without basically eliminating it altogether. 

His opposition to free trade agreements is concerning to me, and I think it compounds to the idea of an isolationist foreign policy. We seem to be -- on both sides of the ideological spectrum -- pushing more and more for isolationism and I think this makes the world a less safer place. 

This concerns me because a president is at his most powerful when dictating foreign policy. And while this article does address some of my concerns about how flexible a President Sanders would be in domestic concerns, it doesn't eliminate them.

Sanders has been able to play ball when he was basically tagging along for the ride. I feel that he's never actually had to play the difficult work of being *a leader*. He's basically had to consider what others have negotiated and decide if he's going to be a team player or not. When he's the one at the helm, how pragmatic can he be then?

And how much of a unity president can he be? His supporters and proxies are *notoriously toxic*. Frankly, I think he uses it largely to his advantage by letting them do his dirty work and pretending to ""stay above the fray"" by not addressing it in any meaningful way. As much as he wants to, he can't just will the rest of the party or the country away.

I think the end result would be a largely ineffective president hampered by an unfriendly Senate where he languishes from an inability to negotiate. His natural response to ""revolution"" away those in his opposition I think will sow greater disunity in his own party and end up in a weaker Democratic Party. In the end, we'll tilt more towards isolationism with nothing meaningful to show for it at the end. And that's my fear with a Sanders presidency.

changemyview,fdxqqow,t3_enbux2,1578771935.0,"I'm assuming you're talking about the Soleimani assassination, in particular. I think in the grand scheme of things, it is a mistake.

Iran is run by a repressive regime and Soleimani ran a violent operation relying on terrible proxy actors who commit heinous crimes. This is undisputed.

Does that mean we should have assassinated Soleimani? I do not believe so. There are many human-rights abusers in the world. China, North Korea, Saudi Arabia -- you name it. There are many countries that have threatened American lives, like Russia. Should we simply militarily attack all of them? This seems unwise -- especially given the destabilizing and unpredictable impacts it may have. The same applies to Iran.

But beyond that, does this action actually make the US or the world any safer? Again, I would argue it does not. It pushes Iran to retaliation. They have significant cyber-warfare capabilities and still have those extensive proxy networks from which to carry out strikes. Further retaliation may yet be down the line.

But also consider how this makes others perceive us. Our adversaries, present and future, are increasingly losing reason to ever trust a deal with the United States. Why would a nuclear-armed North Korea ever want to denuclearize when a fickle America could simply *tear up the deal it negotiated itself and then assassinate its top leaders*? It sets a horrible precedent.

Moreover, consider our allies. In the current global context, I think a lot of Americans aren't feeling just how angry our allies are at the US. South Korea and Japan feel like they're being squeezed in a protection racket. South Korea also feels additionally aggrieved by the US not just leaving South Korea out to dry during China's retaliation for implementing THAAD at America's request, but then following up with tariffs. Speaking of which, we've waged pretty extensive tariff wars on our allies which fostered ill will in general.

Combine that with the fact that we've taken fairly unilateral action with no warning that could prove terribly destabilizing (e.g. assassinating Soleimani) or have actually left our allies out to die (e.g. abandoning the Kurds). This is not to mention how we've tried to simply extort our allies for petty political gain (e.g. the Ukraine Biden investigation). This has left an overall impression among our allies that the US is increasingly erratic, irresponsible, and cannot be depended upon. You hear talk now more than ever about crafting independence from the US, militarily and politically.

The global alliance system that has made us strong and the world safer is getting weaker, and we're the ones causing this atrophy. 

Does unilateral action without consultation from allies strengthen or weaken alliances?

Does a weakened alliance leading to a more multipolar world generate or prevent conflict?

Does erratic action leading to other nations not wanting to negotiate with us give us the ability to diplomatically manage any conflicts that may then emerge?

None of this makes us safer. We may think now that it was all fine and dandy because we've seen no terrible repercussion in the short term, but this is dangerously short-sighted thinking.

But look beyond that. Every town in the US probably has a Chinese restaurant. Chinese cuisines is globally present and beloved. That's surely a part of cultural power. Chinese tech is also making inroads. Everyone loves Tik Tok, for instance.

Mainland Chinese music and movies may not be far-reaching *yet* but I think the key word is yet. As the nation develops and becomes wealthier, I think you'll naturally see improvements in both.

Immigration reform being a hotbed issue for a long time doesn't really challenge any of my counterpoints I brought up. No one is denying immigration reform having been an issue for a long time. In reality, it's been an issue since the founding of the Republic.

> Also it is idiotic to expand the asylum to everyone willing to immigrate illegally should i buy a ticket and on JFK claim that i felt that i was in danger in Europe and i should be given citizenship on the spot?It takes years to try to migrate legally to the US.Assylum should be given to people escaping communist hell like Cuba or Venezuela not someone coming to the US as an economic migrant primary.

Not how asylum works. 

> Even not changing the number of immigrants per year it would be benefitial to take more experts to the US instead of family members of people that are already in the US.There is an idiotic situation that people finish universities in the US and have to return home because just a small part of immigration pool is directed toward economic migration.Brain drain would help US retain global leadership in various industries.

He literally called for a ban on Muslims entering the country. This is just gaslighting at its finest. The fact that what he passed was what he could reasonably get away with doesn't change what he said.

His exact words:

> Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.

Child separation was not policy for many years. [That's just false](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/21/18700575/trump-family-separation-policy-obama-time-telemundo). And it's arguably a policy borne out of racism when you have a President who started his campaign by demonizing Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers. It's not surprising that someone who dehumanizes a group of people so much then implements insanely inhumane policies like these.

And yes. Women are *huge* victims of the perilous journey to the US. Maybe we should then make it easier for them to declare asylum instead of brutalizing them at the border with things like tearing their children from their arms. And maybe we should keep up important aid to these countries so that these sorts of treks never have to be made in the first place.

Make it so much easier to to immigrate legally that we [cut all legal immigration by half](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/us/politics/trump-immigration.html)? So much easier.

And despite efforts to nitpick what Trump said about Congresswomen of color going back to where they came from, it really is hard to defend that comment. It's racist. Pure and simple.

Let's not play coy. Trump explicitly called for a Muslim ban.

""Shithole"" country or not, the President of the United States should not be denigrating other countries in this kind of way if he (1) has a history of racist remarks and actions and (2) wants to represent *all* Americans -- including the ones with backgrounds from ""shithole"" countries. I guarantee you if Barack Obama called Poland a ""shithole"" country, there'd be quite a lot of criticism heaped his way (and rightly so).

You don't have to insult people. But again, claiming that ""both sides have merit"" just out of virtue of being the other side isn't necessary. What I'm taking issue with is your claim that both sides are somehow equal.

When discussing climate change, climate change denial is not a view worthy of equal consideration. When discussing race relations, obviously racist views are not worthy of equal consideration.

I'm challenging effectively this statement of yours that I keep going back to:

Some ideas are backwards. Racism is backwards. Climate change denial is backwards. 

> Having racism be a problem in america and calling all of the opposing side racist are two completely different things. Racism/bigotry doesn't have an orientation, one side just masks is better.

[Racism *was* a significant factor in Republican support fro Trump.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/polq.12737) Trump is a racist President. Calling out that racism might be in action because of very obvious racism...is well, why I say calling a spade a space is necessary.

We all accept that racism exists in American society today and that it's a major problem. And yet when we see racist displays, calling out people for engaging in or supporting racist behavior is somehow taboo? Where's the logic in that? It seems we all agree that we're a country with a racism problem but can't seem to find any actual racists. Odd how that works out."

From the research, it's actually abundantly obvious that a significant portion of Trump supporters *are* racist. Read up on the research that I provided.

I actually never said that the only way to respond to these backwards beliefs is by insulting the people holding them and calling them ""backwards rednecks"". You keep saying that.

I said it's fair to call a spade a spade. I was simply challenging this assertion in your initial comment:

> As long as you think their ideas are backwards you won't change a thing. Both views are equally valid and though through

No, both views are not equally valid. A backwards idea is a backwards idea. And calling it out as such -- instead of saying it's an idea of equal merit -- is fine. 

> My initial comment was never about Trump or his policies. You can't even look at them without losing yourself to the ""everything republican is bad!"" mantra. That's why I addressed that first. But I guess disagreeing with you means I'm a bigot, an anti-vaxxer and a climate change denier...

Your original comment is in a thread about Trump supporters and was in response to a critique of the GOP heralding backwards ideas. My comments only stay in that theme.

Additionally, I never called you a bigot, anti-vaxer, or a climate change denier. I was again refuting the idea that ""both sides have merit"" by looking at some instances where both sides obviously *do not* have merit.

>  literally said both sides are logical to a certain point and there you go ""omfg dumb backwards rednecks"" like that's the only way someone can disagree on topics like climate change.

No, I said there's no merit in believing that both sides' beliefs have equal merit simply because it's the other side.

Denying climate change is not a valid belief. That's a backwards and *dangerous* idea. It should be called out as such. 

Believing vaccines cause autism is not a valid belief. This is a view that often transcends party or political ideology. Still a backwards and *dangerous* idea.

> You generalize and ignore valid concerns just because an extreme minority is louder. 

An extreme minority? Climate change denial is a basic Republican platform. Family separation wasn't contested at all among Republicans -- this is not some fringe action. It was taken on by the Administration at large.
