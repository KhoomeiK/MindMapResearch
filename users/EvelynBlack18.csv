AskReddit,ff44f83,t3_erc1ft,1579555303.0,"As a person suffering from depression, I'd like to believe my friends and family would be honest with me if my symptoms were becoming too much for them.  If I were in denial of the severity of my symptoms or suicidal, then bluntness and immediate intervention might be necessary.  Otherwise, a gentle mentioning would be enough. 

I try to not talk about my disease, because I know it can be overwhelming for those around me."
AskReddit,feogaw8,t3_eq1wzh,1579299724.0,"If not a cure for my depression, than probably death."
SuicideWatch,fe6896a,t3_enscwk,1578883955.0,I'm proud of you. You've got this.
TwoXChromosomes,fdm76eq,t3_elxiqk,1578541471.0,"Congratulations. I'm proud of you. I'm 25 and still haven't managed to get mine yet. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety, and also vision issues (high risk of additional retina tears and vitreous instability), so my health has simply never allowed me much of an opportunity to get my license. Still, not having my license is a very sore subject for me, especially since both my twin sister and my younger brother have theirs.  I feel like a failure, in all honesty. I'm so tired of being dependent on my family for transportation. It isn't fair that they have to be burdened by me."
depression,fdlv98d,t3_em1i69,1578533302.0,That's one of my main signs too. Stay strong.
selfharm,fdh33ow,t3_elbm4c,1578414341.0,"I've been self-harming since I was 14, and I'm 25 now.  It's an addiction."
AskReddit,fcv16fm,t3_ej2fz0,1577992523.0,"The medication made it so I wasn't actively suicidal, but I still suffered from self-harm, passive suicidality, and general symptoms of depression. I felt numb and hollow quite often, but on rare occasions, I actually felt as I did before I developed depression."
AskReddit,fcv0mt5,t3_ej2gtj,1577992231.0,"Cutting myself. It's been 10 years now, and I still can't stop."
skinsTV,fcv016p,t3_eiyzw4,1577991894.0,I got Effy.
depression,fckl1dq,t3_ehg01s,1577727644.0,I'm proud of you. I'm glad you had fun with your friend too.
selfharm,fcaolc4,t3_egrudb,1577573432.0,Good luck. I hope your appointment goes well.
depression,fc79fj7,t3_egdm43,1577501038.0,"I'm in the same situation. I hope that, somehow, life works itself out for us both. Take care."
SuicideWatch,fc4otqp,t3_eg359h,1577423174.0,"It happens to me too, and quite often in all honesty. I had surgery recently and have been on a few medications to help me heal.  Yesterday, I realized that my course of antibiotics is almost over, and the thought of possibly developing a late post-op infection (which I have in the past)  made me severely suicidal for the rest of the day."
AskReddit,fa9gowd,t3_e867k7,1575872991.0,Rather terribly. Thank you for caring enough to actually check in though. It's appreciated.
