gaming,fek26ci,t1_fek0j6r,1579191016.0,"They don't care, they need flashy, crisp scenes . They don't pay attention to the characters they care about what they do. 

In their words: ""They aren't DOING anything Mr. [Danethegreat24]! Why are you making us watch a boring movie!?""

To this I asked: ""Would you rather we go back to doing maths then?"" 

They surprisingly unanimously responded : ""YES!""

Little buggers wouldn't know a fantastic movie even if it shouted ""as you wish"" whilst tumbling down a hill."

Jokes,fdyno2r,t1_fdxu98c,1578781770.0,"Reiteration 1:

An old man walks into a bar and sees a jar of bills sitting on the bar counter. 

The old man waves the bartender over and asks: 
""Why do you keep $200 just sitting here like this?"" 
The bartender looks shocked but then nods and asks: ""You're Jewish?"" 
Now it's the old man's turn to be shocked: ""Yes! How did you know!?""

""You knew there were $200 in there, but have no idea what a tip jar is."""
