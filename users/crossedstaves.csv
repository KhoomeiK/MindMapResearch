todayilearned,fcpr4l4,t1_fcpbeka,1577870325.0,"vision is complicated, see when light is refracted by a lens, the angle is actually dependent on the frequency of the light, it isn't all focused onto the same exact point. The lens of the eye is the same it can't maintain focus for the entire visible spectrum, generally you're going to focus the green light because it's the peak of sensitivity. 

But we have big fancy brains that interpret all the different data we get from all the different types of eye cells and it makes inferences to clean up the data and produce a coherent image for us.  This is why many color-based optical illusions work because the brain is actually reconstructing the full color image not recording a crisp photograph like the image sensor in a camera. 

I'm going to guess that your issues focusing on red have to do with some sort of structural misalignment of the optical elements of the eye.  

So... talk to an eye doctor probably, I don't know."
todayilearned,fcpj0nd,t1_fcp9hid,1577865489.0,"It's because that's where the rod cells in the eye have peak sensitivity, and the rod cells are the ones most used in low light. If you were losing your vision, you'd probably still have your highest sensitivity there even if it were getting less sensitive."
todayilearned,fcpibau,t1_fcp9uqp,1577865078.0,"Seems like the problem is that if you just implement your own little schema for brake lights it doesn't necessarily help things since the point of brake lights is to signal to *everybody else*. If no one else knows what your lights are signaling, then it's just creating confusion.  

It wouldn't be hard at all to just make the lights do a different thing or to build different lights in, it's just hard to bring all existing drivers up to speed on your unofficial redesign."

mildlyinteresting,fc3goi7,t1_fc3fqww,1577389399.0,Do you think that pacemaker is just a metronome that shocks the heart? A modern pacemaker has a whole bunch of feedback mechanisms and sensors to better regulate heart beat.
mildlyinteresting,fc3g55e,t1_fc3cf9m,1577389055.0,"You do also have to concern yourself with X-Rays, since those are a valuable diagnostic tool, likely more valuable than an MRI.

mildlyinteresting,fc3eqxx,t1_fc3e4oi,1577388180.0,"> at least chaning when the person moves relative to the MRI, which is a usual occurence when the bed moves in and out.

Technically not that much since the magnetic field is constant inside an ideal solenoid so relatively small displacements should not change the magnetic field. 

As for when they get in and out of the thing, being electromagnets the rate at which the magnetic field changes can be controlled to the specifications of the device.

But the most important part is that the device itself is put specifically into a scanning mode during the scan, and reprogrammed after the procedure. 

Because the important point isn't really inducing current in the electrodes. The important point is disrupting the logic and especially the sensors."
mildlyinteresting,fc3czab,t1_fc39sw2,1577387057.0,"Well based on no specific information, I'm just going to guess cost. 

Other possibility is there weren't radiologists with specific training on that pacemaker available."
mildlyinteresting,fc3cpm1,t1_fc3a7o6,1577386892.0,"MRI's don't have alternating magnetic fields on the order of Teslas, they have static fields on that order. The static field is used to align the nuclear spin, then they apply a radio-frequency  pulse which provides resonant photons to excite the nuclear spin state. When the pulse stops the nuclei relax and radiate RF photons which can be detected and analyzed. The RF pulse can be directed reasonably well, also also since they're order of magnitude 10 Mhz, they have 1/4 wavelengths that are relatively long and you're not going to get too much by way of interference with the length-scale of the pacemaker. 

Also a shirt button has a static magnetic field, but the field experienced by something else from it is only going to be static if the relative positions are static."

Perhaps, however it is also response for things like the the genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda. Perhaps it helps them get out from under the thumb of foreign powers, but when it's packaged with genocide we have to suspect there is a better way."
mildlyinteresting,fc370qj,t1_fc352qi,1577382990.0,"Most pacemakers are not *safe* for MRIs they are labeled as MR-conditional. Which means the patient is carefully monitored, the pacemaker has specific settings for use in scanning which is turned on and off after the procedure. They have to be introduced into the machine carefully, with detailed instructions on how the magnetic field should set, and where they should be positioned to maintain as static a field as possible on the device itself. The pacemaker's programming should be checked before and after the scan. Even then the MRI should be considered a last-resort imaging technique."
mildlyinteresting,fc360yj,t1_fc32bkf,1577382308.0,"But you might not think about it in context of a shirt. It's one thing to be aware of the fact that you should avoid arc welding equipment, it's another thing to be thinking about shirt buttons."
mildlyinteresting,fc35w8q,t1_fc34q4d,1577382216.0,"They only need to disrupt the thing a little bit to be dangerous. A reasonably strong magnet placed directly over where the pacemaker is implanted can potentially cause problems. Especially since being on a shirt would cause them to be moving around a decent amount and thus create a changing magnetic field which would induce electrical currents. 

What's more pacemakers are getting more and more sophisticated all the time with a complex array of sensors to deliver better regulation of their pulses, interference with those sensors is bad."
PoliticalHumor,fc34za6,t1_fc33cgf,1577381559.0,"The fact that it is not the definition of ""nation"" that is commonly associated with term by lay persons is relevant because ""nationalism"" is a specific thing in terms of political theory as distinct from ""patriotism."" Because we're discussing the concept of ""nationalism"" we need to understand what the roots of the term ""nation"" is and not just the way it's used conversationally. 

We need to be able to understand ""nationalism"" in this context to make sense of the nationalism of Franco, Mussolini, Hitler, of white nationalism, of British nationalism that has come to dominate in this UKIP/Brexit era, of Hindu nationalism that recently revoked article 370 and has stirred up renewed conflict over Kashmir. 

As to the notion of being an idea that isn't bound by blood or soil, sure, because as with any ethnic identity the concept of who *properly* belongs is artificial and imaginary. But it still exists and it is still inexorably tied up in ideas of ethnic and racial identity and superiority that lead necessarily to *othering*, exclusion, oppression and violence."
PoliticalHumor,fc330vn,t1_fc32a2c,1577380263.0,">nation (n.)

>c. 1300, nacioun, ""a race of people, large group of people with common ancestry and language,"" from Old French nacion ""birth, rank; descendants, relatives; country, homeland"" (12c.) and directly from Latin nationem (nominative natio) ""birth, origin; breed, stock, kind, species; race of people, tribe,"" literally ""that which has been born,"" from natus, past participle of nasci ""be born"" (Old Latin gnasci), from PIE root *gene- ""give birth, beget,"" with derivatives referring to procreation and familial and tribal groups.

That would be how. That's why ""nation-state"" is a term."
PoliticalHumor,fc2yvg3,t1_fc2xmg6,1577377608.0,"Nationalism may have motivated people, but it's never a good thing. Because privileging a *nationality* which is an ethnic/cultural group is not a good thing. Since the semantics bell has been rung, it's important to recognize that 'nation' is not the same as 'state' or 'country.' A nation is a group with a cultural tradition and/or ethnic identity. A state is a political structure that governs. A country is region of land. The point is that nationalism is always about privileging a group of people based on culture or ethnicity and is bad and there is a reason that it is inextricably tied up in world wars and in more than one genocide."
