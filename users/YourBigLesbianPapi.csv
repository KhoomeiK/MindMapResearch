It was never anything serious but if you fins yourself dosing off during the day a lot then I'd talk to your doctor. It could be a side effect of your meds if you take any or it could be that you have a symptom of PCOS impacts you more than the others.

PCOS,fdv9zea,t3_em50r1,1578745167.0,"First off, you're amazing. Second, all you can really do is try to be understanding and supportive. Cook healthy foods, buy the type of bread/pasta/rice she eats if you cook for her, unless she's has a keto lifestyle. I'm not sure if it'll be better but I was told to eat whole wheat grains to minimize weight gain from carbs. Listen to her rant and compliment her, although it seems like you already do that. One of my biggest challenges with PCOS, besides the physical symptoms and weight, is the toll it takes on my confidence and happiness. Remind her that her PCOS doesn't define her and that she can get through hard days because she is strong and brave and beautiful. If she exercises then workout with her, it really helps to have someone there with you."

I'm sure my other medical issues stem from my PCOS but who knows, I treat those with medications as well."
PCOS,fdv3ktk,t3_en4y16,1578742733.0,"Oh boy have I got some experience with birth control at only 19. I was diagnosed at 12 and put on metformin and a birth control pill to start my period. I had my ""first"" period at 9 and didn't have another one until after I started the pill. Everything was somewhat normal for a year or two then I got these painful cramps but no blood so it got switched again. Another year and it has to be switched again because my periods were too irregular. First year of high school I had to switch to an IUD because the pill wasn't working. 6 months later it has to be taken out because it's lodged too far and in the wrong spot. So we put the same brand of IUD in and it moved again 6 months later. Then I had a 9 month long period, most alternating between spotting and heavy flow but it was constant pain and cramps. Turns out my body had decided to grow around the IUD and it was stabbing me. My gynecologists, I had 3 because I was the worst case of PCOS they had at their pediatric office, said that if this next form of birth control doesn't work then they can't do anything else for me. So they put the bar in my arm and thats the only thing that worked. Hopefully the pill works for you, everyone is different. I just happened to have very bad luck. I didn't have many side effects and I've not heard too many horror stories. It's definitely scary because you have no idea how it'll affect you but the best thing is that there are so many options out there that if that doesn't work then something eventually will. Just don't stop taking it. Its ok if you miss a pill every now and then, but don't completely stop without talking to your doctor because the bad might outweigh the good of stopping the pill."

lowcarb,fdqr3e7,t1_fdqnveg,1578673070.0,"I found out that I had PCOS when I was 12 because I hadn't gotten my period yet and was gaining a lot of weight. Turns out I had PCOS and insulin resistance. I ended up being the worst case of PCOS for my pediatric gynecologists (they had to bring in 3). It was especially frustrating because I was a tiny child and had no idea why I was gaining weight so much. My sister and I think our dad passed it along because she also has it, luckily it's more mild for her. I'm glad that women have an easier time being diagnosed these days and can know it isn't that their workout routine or diet isn't working but that there is a medical condition making it harder. In a way it makes it much more fulfilling when we do lose a few pounds because it means the hard work is paying off."

My doctors have told me to go on a low carb diet but it's a work in progress right now since I just moved home from university and now have more access to healthier foods. People don't really realize just how hard it is to lose weight with PCOS. I've had people tell me to just eat more salads and go on walks of jogs but that's just simply not enough with PCOS (or anyone trying to lose weight permanently in a healthy way). My friends understand how difficult it is for me lose weight because of the PCOS and other health problems and often help me find better alternatives to things I eat now and will go on walks with me when I have the time and energy.

He was the cutest and most loving giant but my grandmother is very frail and he is very excitable and doesn't know his own strength. He did well and was very gentle with her until one day he was outside on his leash and he accidentally tripped my grandmother. My aunts made us get rid of him after that (they are her power of attorney and have the power to do that). We tried everything to keep the big guy and looked everywhere for a foster. We found a family with three kids who agreed to take care of him and even the kids understood that he would eventually go back to us. We even explained it might be a year until we could get him back and they were happy to help. Sadly, one day the neighbor's kid walked into their house unannounced and Max tried to bite him because he didn't understand that it was the neighbor's kid, whom he also loved. We had to take him to a shelter and legally give him up after that. I like to think he went to a good family but I try not to think about it too much. Don't misunderstand, Max was very loving and only violent when it came to the safety of kids. He was abandoned and abused by his previous two owners, who were our neighbors and we fought hard to get him. I miss him every day."
