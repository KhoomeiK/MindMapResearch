shittymoviedetails,ff485pp,t1_ff440jd,1579557631.0,"Please. The number of Oscar nominations is a bit over the top, but you cannot honestly put this on the same level as those generic Marvel popcorn superhero movies (or most other recent DC movies for that matter). And how‚Äôs this an action movie? Just because there are on screen gunshots or murders?"
Whatcouldgowrong,fez7znb,t1_fex83e2,1579454637.0,Well she does seems to occupy quite a bit of public space herself.
boxoffice,fey1os1,t1_fewlia5,1579439641.0,"Lol, yeah I don‚Äôt have much faith in the executive thought process, but no way do they greenlight a completely unrelated 100+ million threequel based on thursday to saturday estimates from another studio‚Äôs surprise hit."
LifeProTips,fekc2r8,t3_epbo8d,1579196924.0,"I have been firmly behind the stance to never pay for something like reddit, but I welcome the opportunity to spend coins donated to me in the past at least partially for a good cause."
NostalgiaFapping,fehmmw0,t3_eoy8o9,1579119627.0,"It‚Äôs amazing how I felt as if her body and face had been ingrained as an image in my brain for almost 2 decades, yet seeing this behind the scenes footage for the first time makes me realise I never had a clue what she actually looks like."

AskReddit,fdut0oc,t1_fdudvc4,1578738352.0,"Every scene with Michael Caine in it is reality, or at least he has claimed in an interview Nolan told him that."
movies,fd227gl,t1_fd1q62w,1578140525.0,"Just stop it already. The movie is too long. That has nothing to do with the viewer‚Äôs attention span. Scorsese basically could not decide between telling a story in movie or miniseries length so he ended making a ridiculously long movie. A good one, most agree, but too long. Stop apologising it or insulting people who state the obvious."
politics,fcx2zq4,t1_fcx2qz5,1578048963.0,Thanks for your answer. Yeah that is basically unlimited military power it seems.
politics,fcwy4j9,t1_fcway75,1578042626.0,"European here who honestly does not care about US politics whoever is in charge, but what you guys do make me wonder about: if I understand it right the president is the commander in chief, which I interpreted as that he is the boss of the military. Does the president need some kind of political approval to commence military operations?"
dataisbeautiful,fcnpc4r,t1_fcnailq,1577815884.0,"Trust me, watching all South Park episodes in a short amount of time would also influence your rating behaviour. I have long periods of usually a couple of years in which I don‚Äôt watch the show and then I binge 4-5 seasons in like a week. It becomes repetitive and it negatively influences your perception even if an episode is inherently or objectively great."
television,fcnl3oa,t1_fcnimfq,1577813615.0,"I admit that‚Äôs pretty cheap, but honestly except for some promo for other content before or after a program I‚Äôm against the idea of paying for a subscription."
WatchandLearn,fcnjp58,t1_fcn1gth,1577812964.0,That is because the whole thing IS completely nonsense.
WatchandLearn,fcnjghf,t3_ei1yri,1577812854.0,Congratulations on ending the year with the most bullshit meaningless graphic of 2019.
television,fcndgwo,t1_fcna907,1577809383.0,Ads for their own shows or for third parties? Because to me there‚Äôs still a difference and I am willing to accept the first one.
television,fcnd7x8,t1_fcnbwoe,1577809221.0,"That still is pretty shitty to have a paid option that still has ads.
Anyway thanks for informing me and happy new year ü•≥"
television,fcnd0kv,t1_fcn3qnn,1577809086.0,"Of course I was never going to like everything they produce/buy, that was never my expectation. But given the budget they‚Äôre spending, I don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre getting their money‚Äôs worth and I as a viewer am struggling to find new good original content to dive into. And I am not looking for solely Oscar or Emmy worthy material. Once you start to flip through the content, it starts to feel really limited (admittedly part of the problem is that their user interface is pretty bad and keeps showing the same 5% of stuff that is available). And no matter how much they currently produce, they do not have decades of back catalogue like the Hollywood studios. I sincerely hope they can remain a competitor to those studios but if those studios take back all their content and launch their own streaming services in my region, I will have to reconsider what I am willing to pay for."
television,fcnbrd1,t1_fcnaznr,1577808252.0,"Wait, I knew Hulu had commercials but I thought that was only the free version, even the paid one has it?!?
Okay well screw that, I‚Äôll stick with Netflix hoping they won‚Äôt do that.
Seriously what do these companies not get, I will pay more a month if you don‚Äôt show me commercials."
television,fcnash4,t1_fcn5gp8,1577807596.0,"Oh thanks for clarifying, didn‚Äôt know that. Hulu is not yet available in my region either.
Also how typical Disney is that, buying up all content and dividing it over several streaming services..."
goodvibes,fcn68ic,t3_ehufwl,1577804355.0,"Yeah sorry nice video but that is NOT a safe way to cut and I don‚Äôt care how trained you are, this is not how you do it or should learn other people to do it. The knife goes way too high and the cuts are all over the place. But I assume this is filmed in a kebab joint so I guess evenly cut vegetables aren‚Äôt essential anyway. But let at least try to keep our fingers long term."
television,fcmzi63,t1_fcmjha5,1577798709.0,"Lol, yeah for like the first year maybe."
television,fcmyx0z,t1_fcmu832,1577798115.0,"I agree with everything you said but I wonder if the catalogue of Netflix Originals is strong enough if you take away all the licensed programming. In the beginning Netflix Originals were also seen as a quality brand while now it‚Äôs a very mixed bag. Personally I hate Disney but if they bring their streaming service to my region and it holds among other things the entire 20th Century Fox catalogue of movies and TV shows, I might consider switching."
Wellthatsucks,fclmf6y,t1_fck8973,1577751212.0,"Yeah the comments in this thread are more awkward and out of touch with what they‚Äôre watching than the reactions of that North-Korean audience. Cultural exchanges like this are very important and a good sign. It‚Äôs like when people were laughing with the North-Korean supporters at the Winter Olympics in South Korea. Yeah they act weird in our opinion and they think the same of us, but that kind of exchanges are positive and important for both sides."

belgium,fcl3806,t3_ehiahi,1577738832.0,"Interesting. While I am not (yet) in favour of such a system (it feels like parliament would be even less of a reflection of the people), at least we would have had a government months ago. We‚Äôre coming to the point that having a government is more important than exact representation of the people‚Äôs vote in parliament."

movies,fccs0h2,t1_fcc8bod,1577601945.0,"I had a boss that had as one of its objectives (which determined his bonus) to organise 3 team events a year. No quality objective or productivity increase afterwards or anything. Since then things like premiering an unfinished movie do not face me anymore. Respecting timing and quantity is more important than quality, and somehow the higher-ups of the higher-ups (shareholders) agree. As long as overall profit targets are reached."
MiddleEasternHotties,fccm0xa,t3_eh0k0u,1577599966.0,The shapes really don‚Äôt make sense.
belgium,fcak8tx,t1_fc9jred,1577570828.0,"Theoretically it‚Äôs not impossible, certainly if the money amassed is only for the acquiring costs of the house and not the further down payments on a loan (and given that banks have been throwing loans at people up to the point that their own lobby is installing rules on a maximum percentage of the value of the house that can be loaned, getting a loan and low initial acquisition costs on a house isn‚Äôt impossible either).

Of course, all that said, even if this has occurred, we must be talking about a fairly exceptional phenomenon that I would feel is an abuse of the system, but should not be the focus of an argument to change the system. The more important part is ignored: should benefits retroactively be awarded for a period in which the state provided already in the needs for which the benefits exist? Maybe it is justified, maybe not, but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with asking that question. It just would have looked a lot better without the Vlaams Belang style caricature example."
AbsoluteUnits,fcaher9,t1_fc95sma,1577569295.0,"In Europe almost everybody would presume you‚Äôre talking about a 1,5 litre bottle if you say ‚Äúfull size‚Äù, although to be fair ‚Äúfull size‚Äù is a very misleading term in the context of fluid containers, the only real opposite being ‚Äúminiature‚Äù as in hotel or airplane bottles."

movies,fbz2lcz,t1_fbz134e,1577233189.0,"On the contrary it seems like they‚Äôre really going all in, spending even more money on a movie that is is already one of the biggest box office bombs ever.

God knows why, it‚Äôs a horrible abomination no matter what format you put it in, but it has been running non-stop for almost 40 years. It‚Äôs no surprise at some point some studio was going to make a big budget movie out of it. It still is baffling that they put 100 million into it and what they got for it in return.
