AskReddit,fff5kf9,t1_ffeljxg,1579876267.0,"Ugh, I've never been a big sports guy but I'd choose playing over watching any day if I had to pick one. I don't know why sitting in front of a TV, drinking beer and getting fatter while screaming at some dudes on the TV is such an insanely popular past time here for just about half of everyone I encounter. I work in a club that's also a restaurant and bar (I'm on the restaurant side) and there's dozens of TV's around the place for customers to watch. they're ALWAYS on sport except for the couple that have prize/member draw numbers on them. Then you get people asking to change the TV from one sport to another because the sport they want to watch is on the TV behind them instead of the one they're facing and they just chose a dumb orientation to sit. Then I have to hear ""it's on channel xxx"" or whatever while I'm searching for it - like these people can't comprehend that anyone wouldn't pay for cable just to watch this crap all day long (hint, I don't so of course I take a while to find the channel)

It's such a big deal in my country (Australia). Every TV in every bar and club has sport. A disproportionately large segment of the afternoon news hour is about sport or its players. TV ads for betting on sports every commercial break. Sports is treated as the biggest deal at schools when it comes to extracurricular activities and bigger trophies are handed to the athletic kids than the academic ones. We put our athletes on pedestals and worship them like gods and essentially let them know they're above everyone else and then act surprised when they display shitty behaviour and bad role model material to all the kids who worship them like gods (this is so foreign to me, neither I, my brothers or my friends though athletes were a big deal when we were growing up but damn a lot of kids apparently do and I regularly see even children who'd rather watch the cricket than watch cartoons) I don't get it man, sports is everything in this country and while I admit playing it could be fun, I will never understand how so many millions of people in my portion of the nation alone can be so invested in just... watching it."

starterpacks,ff84h6s,t3_es03ow,1579665749.0,"I have a lot/hate relationship with the cats in my house. they're my brother and his fiance's cats - all three of them (one being a kitten they adopted a few weeks ago, guess they weren't getting enough cat out of the first two) Since they are renting a room in this house (which belongs to both me and my mother, we went halves in the mortgage and both live here too) so it's a full house with four adults, four cars (and soon his motorbike he's getting... fucking fantastic) and now three cats. It stresses me out, there's too much activity going on in a little old suburban house that could cater to maybe a couple of parents with a couple of kids and maybe one pet, but not all of... this.

Now I like cats more than any other pet, including dogs. If they wanted dogs in the house that would have been an absolute no. Not even in the yard since I take a lot of pride in my garden and dogs just ruin those. But cats were fine, they spend most of their time sleeping anyway and I get to pet and cuddle them.

But they've destroyed so much of my furniture which was all bought brand new just 4-5 years ago. Even when provided with appropriate scratch-pads they still go after the lounge. The new kitten still being at the playful stage is jumping into my houseplants and wrecking those, if not knocking them completely over making more mess to clean (thank god I didn't buy that nice carpet I wanted) their cat toys and multiple food bowls are scattered about and if my brother/his fiance aren't home I will often come home to the smell of the litterbox. I feel like I'm coming home to to a stereotypical poor person's house which is not how I want to feel after coming back from my second job that day. The place smells and my furniture which I was hoping to have for at least ten years isn't even in a condition where I feel like I could sell it after they move out, not for any more than a couple hundred bucks - a fraction of what I paid for it not even 5 years ago. I like cats but not when it's someone else's pets ruining my stuff. When they finally move out and take their cats with them I'm gonna have to buy pretty much a new everything (no, your'e crazy if you think they'll give me anything towards it, this will be out of my pocket) and I swear to god no-one is living with me again after this and absolutely no pets!"

Very low effort, just requires diligence for the first growing season or two.

AskReddit,ferdnps,t1_feq00gq,1579352679.0,"I love the aesthetic of modern and futuristic inspired architecture. When I was a kid I dreamed of a typical sci-fi future where all cities looked like this and old era buildings that are so treasured in the west just remind me too much of a darker age of history of which I'm glad I didn't have to exist in. The giant steel and glass towers of today just fill me with awe of how far we've come as a society, and from a practical point of view are more relevant to what society needs now than some two century old sandstone building occupying a city block that could be far better utilized today if it had something different on it. 

&#x200B;

But I'm torn on the morality of visiting a place like Dubai because of the methods they used to get these amazing buildings in the first place. The sheer and shameless exploitation of foreigners occurring during a time where westerners had already long deemed that to be inhumane (people complain about how racist and unfair western society it is but I say we have a better attitude towards ensuring foreigners have equal rights than anywhere else in the world). I love the look of the place - from the architecture to the landscaping in between. But culturally I don't know if I could support it. Then again since I'm not a billionaire it's not like I'm the demographic they'd give a crap about anyway, and I'd imagine many billionaires are totally fine with exploiting the poor so they can continue getting shit they want.

&#x200B;

Then again, the Great Pyramids were built by slave labour and millions of people per year still pay to see those. Is it less immoral to support that simply because the slavery happened longer ago than the construction of Dubai's skyscrapers?"

Yes after Googling ""Hermosa Beach"" (the only one of those names for the place I feel like I've heard of before) that's more like what I imagine California living is like (I'm guessing you have to be rich to live there though, Australia has many places like that here too but if you want to be in or close to that kind of scene here you gotta have money)"

funny,fephavf,t1_feoiexf,1579320481.0,Yep. If you know your size then online presents way more options.

I'm still fairly young, or at least still feel it. Still got my health - no aches, pains or medications. I'm sane even if a little weird at times and I'm at least not-ugly. So I as a person feel fine... But it's my living situation that completely sucks out the ass.

&#x200B;

I'm 32 years old working two part time jobs that physically and mentally exhaust me to the point it's killed my passion for just about anything besides sitting on Reddit while recovering in my free time, much of which is spent waiting for my next shift to begin. Late nights and early mornings with big gaps in between that are not long enough to do anything of substance but too long to do nothing. Between both I still only earn on the lower end of the average income and get no paid holiday or sick leave. I've dragged myself into work when I feel like I'm about to collapse. This isn't to say I'm living in poverty, I can still get myself something nice once in a while (which is good because I like fancy clothes) but it's always at the expense of something else. Picking up extra work on my day off or skipping meals etc. Someone doing well wouldn't have to go through that just because they saw a costly pair of sunglasses they liked.

I live with my family despite being 32. My mother and I bought this house together so she lives with me just as much as I live with her. Thought I'd better clear that up before people start screeching ""basement dweller"" at me (like we even together could afford a place with a fucki'n basement) My mother is good company and pretty absent for the most part so she isn't the problem. But my brother and his partner are. My mother suggested they live with us until he finishes university... that's three years. I still got over a year left to go of putting up with this arrogant, lazy, selfish, messy nerd or a brother, his control freak of a fiance and their three cats destroying everything I paid for before they were invited (by my mother, whose rarely around to put up with it by the way). Lounge was bought brand new only four years ago - it's already a throwaway now because the cats they refuse to set boundaries for have scratched it up. Curtains are torn, will have to replace those too. A broken vase and damage houseplants. Place is always a mess - they leave shoes, papers, DVD's and shit everywhere and throw a fit when I move them back to their respective spaces just so I can spend a few hours feeling like I live in something nicer than a zoo. I'm treading on eggshells every day with them around since they anger so easily and nothing's worse than coming home from your second job of the day to a place your'e paying most of your wage away for that's looks like a dump and constantly smells of cat pee.

&#x200B;

I want out. I hate my fucking food service job (the other job is OK but if I didn't need to do that anymore either I'd be happier still) I hate working evenings and weekends having to pretend I'm happy to be running meals out to people when I could be doing something I enjoy. I hate having to get up early the next morning after finishing late the night before. I hate sharing a house with family and animals I barely can even bring myself to care about anymore because they are ruining my home. I hate skipping meals and picking up extra shifts every time I see something I want to buy just so I can feel like I'm working for more than just food and bills. I hate how I haven't had the right mental state to work on my art or even touch my videogames in over a month. I hate how exhausting and disappointing each and every day is, only to end most of them with nothing more than what I started with.

I want to win the lottery. I want to have enough money to actually live life indefinitely. I want to travel, rediscover old hobbies and find new ones. Eat something that fills me *every* night and still be able to buy that nice thing I saw online. Have my own place with no family or fucki'n animals ruining it for me. Somewhere I wouldn't be embarrassed to bring a date home to. I want to live in a part of the city where I'm not the only one like me for miles so I can actually find at least some friends with common interests beyond ""we work together"". I want to not have to spend another evening, weekend or public holiday working and actually go to these fun things that happen on said days. I want to chase my creative dreams even if they don't turn out to be profitable. I just want out of this fucking hamster wheel man. I can do everything else myself but I NEED FUCKING MONEY! Like...

The differences between a top tier beaver and a lower tier one probably aren't as strong as the differences between a top pick human and a ""lesser"" option. The top choices in our species which are often the most attractive or wealthy have so much availability and choice that they are probably less willing to be monogamous. Even when they try to make it work (celebrity marriages) they often fail (how many partners has Leonardo DiCaprio had by now?)

Think of it as like a kid with a toy. Some poor kid in some third world village somewhere probably has one falling apart doll they'll cherish more than anything. Meanwhile some spoiled brat elsewhere expects a Christmas tree loaded with gifts after every one of Santa's visits , and they'll be bored with them after a few months. I still reckon how prone to monogamy a person is comes down to how much choice they know they have. I'm not saying everyone who isn't ""bottom of the barrel"" is like that.

Religion doesn't have to be Christian. Many religions seem to promote monogamy and having kids and condemn ""sleeping around"" as sinful behaviour, even if it's consensual.
