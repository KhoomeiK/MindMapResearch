Liverpool’s front 3 are also doing a lot more off the ball to create chances for the rest of the team. They’re also more fit to play 90+ than Man U’s.

Rashford, Man U’s best forward is not a better player than Mane. He’s not better than Salah. He’s not as good as Firmino. This article is trying to compare the two attacks and claim that Man U’s front 3 are not only at the same quality as Liverpool’s, but somehow better.
