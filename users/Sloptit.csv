MechanicAdvice,fdykj9o,t1_fdyfkem,1578780736.0,Jump the car and use a volt meter to see if you have more than 13v on the batt terminals while the car is running. If you have less than that the alt is toast. It's a Honda so you may need to watch it a bit. Some of the newer models the alternator is commanded to around 12v at times. But in hindsight it should be a problem since the batt will be weak. Alternatively you can go to a parts store and have them check the system on their machine.

All plastic is supposed to be melted into pucks and offloaded during a replinishment or port call. If there's plastic in the paper/food trash then some dickhead was being lazy when they threw their plastic into paper trash like in the galley or their work enter or something. All the paper trash gets thrown into those boxes in the hanger and they just dump them. Ive seen people get caught and then they had to sort all the trash for a while. One shitbag chick got caught throwing either trash in the cig bucket on the smoke deck, or the other way around. They made her sit outside the smoke deck and sort trash out the butt cans and butts out the trash. Shit was hilarious."

That box with the plastic around it didn't go in."
trashy,fdotnvf,t1_fdospnf,1578612620.0,Oh yeah. We had some issues with our incinerator often on E and they would make us hold trash for a long time at times so night ops was def a thing.

In all seriousness good luck, I know it ain't easy, specially when youre not deployed. When we were decomming the Enterprise I would literally just show up to the boat to muster, then go home. A few times a week I'd literally walk off the boat before colors after getting liberty. Some days we'd have to go check some spaces my divison was responsible for. On a busy day I was home before noon. I was drinking almost a fifth of Jack a day at that point. I cut down after I switched commands and then quit basically for a year after I got out. I started smoking though so that helped a bunch. My ole lady gave up the sauce cold turkey a little over a year ago. Just take solace in the fact that you ain't got to worry about an ARI anymore."

MechanicAdvice,fcbcm3w,t1_fcb97ww,1577585226.0,Correct. That's why they are rated in cold cranking amps. Since it stopped I might hazard a guess that your alternator did a good job of bringing it's charge up but you still may have a dying battery.
