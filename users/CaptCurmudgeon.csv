In terms of taste, there are salty or mild oysters which are less pronounced than when eaten raw.  The breading usually carries a strong flavor. Usually, fried oysters are served with other items, so it's not like you're focusing on the flavor of the oyster alone.  Typically, I eat my fried oysters on a po'boy sandwich, so the flavors complement each other."

Bad: pay a vehicle property tax higher than NC and FL, lots of open space that was formerly farmland will eventually turn into neighborhoods and thus more people, not a very diverse community, not a ton of public spaces utilized.
