COMPLETEANARCHY,ff118m5,t1_ff0xqdo,1579474251.0,"Yeah man it was horrible. Like I don’t think if you haven’t gone through it you can get it. I’m 15, this was literally my first sexual experiences EVER, and I’m having to go in front of all these adults over and over again and repeating in graphic detail all the things he did to me. And, I’ll be honest, there were some things that were so humiliating that I’ve never told anyone, not even then - they’re just kindof at the edge of my memory. And if you get things wrong in your story then they get angry at you and you know that they’ll doubt you. You have to describe the position, the act, the order. And to go through literally all of that and to get nothing? I have so much anger at all these adults in my life that should have done more to protect me and take care of me and didn’t. Whew BOY this is some therapy. 

I do really appreciate your sympathy, it means a lot."
COMPLETEANARCHY,ff0wfr1,t1_ff0fa49,1579472918.0,"Oh i know, don’t get me wrong, I didn’t anticipate literally anything else would happen.

In the interest of full disclosure, when I was 15 I was forced to file charges against an older kid that went to my high school because he had been sexually assaulting and raping me for a few months. I told a friend, who told the resource officer at my school, who made me talk to the guidance counselor AND the principal AND called my mom. So we filed charges. Of course, after months of going through that mess, nothing happened. 
When this last rape happened, I was 24. I didn’t even bother calling the cops. I knew what would happen. When I was arrested, I broke down in front of the cop who was escorting me out of the store and told him I had been raped and hadn’t been handling things well. He and his partner went into a back office with me and we talked for like an hour. To his credit, he was actually great with me. That is like my one positive experience with the police. They filed a report. I also told the court and my lawyer about the rape. I was just really hoping they would go easy on me. Nothing happened. I didn’t officially filed CHARGES, just made the report.

The whole story didn’t fit so well haha."

As for target, it sounded like they actually have great loss prevention but they don’t really do anything until you reach at least a hundred or a couple hundred. Things like electronics shouldnt be touched, they’ll go after that. 

Learn local laws regardless of the store. I worked at urban outfitters for a little bit - if we caught someone stealing, just made them give it back and kicked them out. However, in my city at $500 it went from like a misdemeanor II to the next level up. That’s when that store would call the police. 

Also, don’t be black, regardless of what store or what city you’re at. Try not to be a teenager or 20something."

COMPLETEANARCHY,fezs0yc,t3_eqxhes,1579460906.0,"After I got raped I had a breakdown. I ended up getting caught shoplifting $52 worth of bralettes from a local high end department store. They made me strip down, took them from me, and called the police. I was arrested. I had to pay hundreds of dollars to go through a diversion program which included a class on Making Adult Decisions. In the class there was a woman who had been arrested for stealing formula for her baby. There was another woman who worked for Walmart - at one point, she had no money, was supporting herself and her bf who was here illegally. One day at work she took a Snapple and a bag of chips to eat. The next day her check came through and so when she clocked in at work that day she took a bag of chips and a Snapple, bought them, then put them back. She was also arrested. There was a young woman who walked out of Walmart with a pack of water bottles on the bottom of her cart - not only did Walmart call the police, they also called her current employer and arrested her. 
For anyone wondering, no, my rapist wasn’t arrested."

Yeah I’ve crept back up over the years, but I just have to start caring about my diet again, and it goes back down. Been 3 years.

ShitMomGroupsSay,feoap28,t1_fenjrur,1579297427.0,"I’m still in training. It’s interesting seeing how different doctors try to handle this mess. I think a lot of them are just fatigued.

One very satisfying story was this damn wealthy, white, stupid woman who brought her teenage kids into the clinic for their annual check ups. She informed us she had been doing her “research” (nothing, NOTHING makes my blood boil like when some wealthy woman with a communications degree tells me she’s been doing “research” - I have spent years of my god damn life actually learning this, you’ve been reading bullshit on google) and she “wasn’t sure” (that’s the other thing they always say) about the HPV and meningitis vaccines. I hear the HPV one all the time. It’s insane. Like, you literally prevent cancer in your child. But I hear it all the time. I had NEVER heard someone refusing the meningitis before. Meningitis is horrifying. I have never seen it but I’ve heard the stories and I’ve learned about it. 
ANYWAYS the doctor I was working with listened to her and then went “oh okay. Well do you understand that the meningitis vaccine you’d be getting at this visit is important because it covers these strains? Which peak at these ages? And then these strains are covered under this shot?” And she just had this surprised, blank look. 
“Oh uh... no I didn’t know that”
“Okay well there are actually five strains we vaccinate against, did you know that?”
“Uhh no I didn’t know that.”
He talked to her some more. In the end she gave her kids the meningitis shots, refused the HPV. It was just satisfying to be able to call one of them out and really REALLY show what they didn’t know. Shows to go how thorough her research was."

About mental illness. 

It’s always weird when they talk about things you have. I also have fibromyalgia. I had an immunology PhD announce to us like week 5 of med school it was a made up disease. (He was an anomaly.) When we learned about it in rheumatology, they talked extensively about the link between fibromyalgia and prior trauma which was dead on. In psych when they talk about BP it’s weird because it just - it sounds so scary. Like is that really me? Psych is also challenging, I think for everyone, because it’s soooo easy to self diagnose with all sorts of shit.

It’s challenging. I think i struggled with mental health a lot more than my peers, but I think most people are anxious and depressed and a little OCD. One thing about med school that is weird is You’re with a lot of adult students. Like I came here straight out of undergrad and I think I’m in the minority. Lots of kids who took at least a year, or have masters, and/or who have a spouse with a steady job or maybe who still live with their parents. I felt so often like I was behind, like my life was so unstable and that I didn’t have nearly a good enough support system. I struggled, I won’t lie. I started hurting myself again. I considered suicide on more than one occasion. Just on the trauma side, I was in a really abusive relationship for my first year. Then I was raped in December of my second year, while studying for my board exam. 

The hypomania was helpful at times. Getting that late night energy to finally clean my apartment felt so good. On the other side of things I picked horrible fights and blew up friendships. The stress of my life compounded the irritability of BP. 

I found a really good therapist through my school like my second year. She had been incredible. Got me through so much. I have a best friend who is my rock. We wouldn’t be here without each other. 

I new something was very wrong, I saw a psychiatrist end of second year after boards, got the BP diagnosis and got in really good meds. I still cycle. It’s hard. I’ve been so miserably depressed lately, I don’t want to get out of bed and then I feel guilty because I don’t have the motivation to study which just makes me more depressed.

But like somehow you just DO it. You don’t stop. This is what I wanted my whole life. I can’t imagine doing anything else. I get the opportunity to work really hard and eventually I get to genuinely help other people. Like, how could I do anything else? I got accepted into a fourth year class that will let me go to Rwanda for a month and work in a hospital there. Rwanda! Do you know how amazing that is? And how much I’ve wanted to do that? Not some bullshit, pad-your-resume voluntourism shit but going and working with very vulnerable populations and making a difference. I’ve learned my coping skills. Yeah they don’t always work, but that’s ok. And for all the trauma in my life - the sexual abuse, the rape, the abusive relations, the many abusive relationships, the abuse growing up, being around substance abuse, the mental illnesses - they are horrible but they help me be a better doctor. I understand  my patients better. I volunteer at the free std clinic my school runs and we had a girl come in who had been sexually assaulted a year prior and wasn’t handling it well. I sat with her for an hour and talked about things. Instead of being triggering it felt incredible. I got to take this horrible thing that happened to me and use it to understand and help someone else. I am so grateful that I get to use my traumas to help others.

I want to do emergency medicine. Love the pace of it, love the variety, love the culture, love the patients."
bipolar,femt865,t1_femdalz,1579268937.0,"The first two years of med school are lectures. They fucking suck. It is a massive amount of material. Your individual lectures are all taught by different people (or you’ll have like say 6 over heart physiology all taught by one guy.) The way the years are arranged differ by school. You also have things like small group. Small group is usually a waste of time. Even worse are required wellness events. They are a bigger waste of time. Med students have horrible mental health, an hour of yoga once a month won’t fix that. When the PhDs teach the lectures it can be so bad because they don’t understand clinically relevant material. If you go google the Stanford metabolic map, we learn that entire thing (you have to enter an email but seriously they have never sent me spam). I have never once in my life has to use the Krebs cycle in the clinic. These years are demanding. You never stop studying. Ever. You have mental breakdowns. I failed my first anatomy practical and I seriously wanted to kill myself (not exaggerating, I seriously wanted to hurt myself.) You end up isolating yourself. It’s also challenging because everyone in your class is used to being the top of their class in undergrad. Suddenly you’re WITH everyone who was top 5% and it is so jarring to study super hard and then get the average. It’s just - it is the more demanding coursework of your life. 

At the end of two year you take step 1. It is a cumulative board exam. It is horrible. It’s score literally determines the rest of your life. If you get below a certain cut off, well, whole specialties are now just off limits. You should go to like r/medicalschool and look at what people say about it. It is archaic. It tests over outdated and irrelevant material and diseases and techniques. I didn’t get questions about like how to treat a cold - I got questions where you had to like figure out an infectious disease based on symptoms and then remember the gram stain and shape of the bacteria. That has no clinical relevance. And the whole thing is kind of a scam - you should read some of Bryan Carmody’s threads on twitter about it. But whatever - you do it, you survive, ok. 

Third year are clerkships. Everyone in your school takes the same clerkships in different orders. These are hard for different reasons. You go out and you work in hospitals and clinics, interview patients, review charts, come up with assessments and plans, present them. You don’t actually have much power, the residents and attendings make all the decisions. You’re learning. The thing is your time is not yours and the experience is a crapshoot. When I was on surgery, my service was hell. I got yelled at and berated all the time, I was there from 5 AM until 5 PM minimum M-F then like 6 AM - at least noon Sa or Su. My friend was on a different service and loved all the doctors she worked with. You take a standardized exam at the end of every clerkship. A huge part of your grade, however, is evals from the docs you work with which is so subjective and very frustrating. At least first two years you could study hard and know you did objectively well. Third year you can kill it on the shelf but if you had shitty doctors well, sucks to suck. Like I have gotten subpar evals out of literally nowhere. 

Fourth year you pick your month long selectives. This is going to be more tailored towards your future career. You take step 2 CS and CK during this time (pls go read about CS - it costs like $1600 and is only offered in 5 cities and has a 90++% pass rate - it is all for the profit baybee). You also apply for an interview at residencies. Then match day. I obviously can’t say anything about my personal experience."

Premed/applying 

Pre-med at my undergrad was basically just a 4 year seminar you took alongside your normal courses. First two years, it was mostly these seminars every few months or so that we pretty much worthless. Third year, which is when you apply, the seminars were then monthly and covered relevant topics like how to write you personal statement, timelines, etc. Applying is very expensive. What I, and basically everyone I knew learned, is that getting in is all about who you know and where you are. I got into what was at the time the 5th best school for primary care and it was probably in large part due to me living in the state (yes, I had a great application, but I don’t think it would have mattered without my residency.) You take MCAT between junior and senior year, also apply that summer, then interview through the fall and winter of senior year. I applied all over the country and only got two interviews, got into both. That broke my heart because I felt so stupid and like such a failure that I didn’t get more interviews. Realized after everything that the only students I knew from my school who got more than like 3 interviews (the state they were from, the school we went to, this one shitty med school in St. Louis that interviewed everyone) had connections. One kid who interviewed EVERYWHERE - daddy was in charge of a big pharm school. The girl who got into Mayo - her parents were both doctors who worked at Mayo Clinic. I had actually been her TA, graded her tests, and I knew she had worse grades than I did.  And once I talked to all these other kids I knew who only got, ya know, 2-3 interviews it made me feel a lot better about where I was. 

I guess for my application, I had double majored in chemistry and art history with minors in biology and studio art. Had taken like 17+ credit hours every semester. Got like 5 B+s total, all else were As (spring of freshman and fall of sophomore). Was in a sorority, did philanthropy through that, was in a club that worked with adults with intellectual +/- disabilities and ended up on the exec board, in chemistry club, 2 years of research without a publication (only published my first med school year), in 2 honor societies, worked three jobs, was a TA for 3 different courses, was a tutor. I think that’s about it? That was the big stuff. lol was actually in a communist group on campus for a year that had an innocent name and spun that into something something supporting the workers at the university (which is mostly what we did.)"

JustBootThings,feie0r7,t1_feiansv,1579136316.0,"The VA system has pros and cons. There’s a difference between paying for things and having access to services. One thing that was nice about working at the VA was most things were just COVERED. I don’t think people understand how much time is eaten up by haggling with private insurance companies. When you work at non-VA facilities, the insurance specialists, the nurses, even the doctors are constantly having to spend time either arguing with insurance companies or changing plans because something isn’t covered. Honestly, that happened way less at the VA. (I can think of some like $10K/dose meds that were hard to get?) A lot of things WERE paid for. The problem was access to those resources. The hospital I worked at was horribly outdated and understaffed. The wait list to get into the GI clinic was like 4+ months? I think? Guys came into the ER all the time for non-emergent complaints because the wait time for a clinic appointment would be weeks out. Or like we didn’t have a functional cath lab anymore so when someone came in with a heart attack we had to frantically try to call the university hospital nearby and get them transferred. The hospital was constantly reaching capacity because there weren’t enough nurses. And god don’t get me started on the psych floors and how much money needed to be poured into them. There isn’t enough money and resources to provide adequate staffing and facilities. I think it’s probably cheaper to pay for a million prescriptions than to have sink probably billions of dollars into new facilities and new staff."
