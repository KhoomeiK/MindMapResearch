Or what if I forget to blow out a candle or my dryer catches fire while I’m not home? I take all the precautions necessary to make sure this doesn’t happen… But the idea of my pets hurting scares me!"
AskReddit,ff9wqse,t3_esc8vq,1579723180.0,"I’d give her money to sign up for whatever sport/dance/ music class they wanted. I’d take them to buy some decent clothes, a hot meal and let them shower. I’d tell myself to enjoy my teenage years even though they were the hardest years, and that living in poverty will change you for the better... and once you get a job, take advantage of the income and go travel with friends. And omg stay away from Will when you meet him. He’s a waste of money and time."
CsectionCentral,ff54kt3,t3_erim8b,1579580059.0,"Thank you so much! My heart isn’t set on a VBAC, and I’m definitely not wanting to risk anything... just want a healthy baby and a healthy me! Y’all have made me feel better about having them so close together and that maybe the second C-section won’t be as traumatic 🙈"
CsectionCentral,ff41gg4,t1_ff3zsc4,1579553470.0,"Oh my goodness! These little breech babies not wanting to turn! Lol. I’m not like... SET on having a VBAC, but ya know, the recovery of a c-section isn’t fun. I have so many questions on how you handled having a second C-section and babies 13 months apart because honestly I’m so scared of the idea of having mine 12 months apart! And how did you manage to give your baby the best care while dealing with pregnancy tired/sickness with your second baby?? It’s been emotional for me!"
CsectionCentral,ff1dp6g,t1_fe5r1mi,1579477853.0,"My baby was breech too! My water didn’t break before, so I got a full nights sleep, did my hair and eyebrows, and gave birth at 12:30pm lol. I do feel lucky for the before experience, getting rest and all. Of course after the c-section is rough!"

offmychest,feri4ci,t1_fer4sdq,1579354172.0,"I actually am a little upset... I’m 8 weeks pregnant and not much sounds good, but chocolate ice cream does and that’s why I bought it! Lol"

obgyn,fedm659,t3_eom2c5,1579014928.0,Every time I’ve gone in they do a pee stick test... is your doctor different? I don’t see why any of their tests would come back negative if you have such a clear positive and you’re 4 days late.
millionairemakers,fbilrg0,t3_edhj2m,1576904946.0,"Just had squirrels come into our house from our chimney, they went up our tree, on our counters, peed on our table, destroyed a bathroom(one got stuck in there)  and literally got inside of the fabric of our sofa, we could see a little squirrel body outline in the fabric... it was insane. We threw out a bunch of stuff so cash to help re-furnish our home would be so nice! And we just had a baby, who is the most adorable little bundle of joy!"
