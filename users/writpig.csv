Trying to speak up on the topic gets you lumped in with them, both in the socially negative connotations and in your message getting lost.

The second is a very harsh pushback from third wave feminism. There's a lot of critique about third wave specifically, and it has become quite sexist in its own way. Tolerating comments like ""All cis-white men should die"" happens too often.

It's social suicide to be a male rights activist as a male. We need women, who can use their gender as a claim to unbiasedness, to step up because the social condition of this current time makes men unable to advocate for themselves.

This is unfortunately a result of feminism's impact on society. I hope someday we can have a strong egalitarian movement to replace feminism and aim at addressing issues for everyone instead of having narrow focuses."

Non-functioning nipples? Not enough evolutionary pressure to create a more unique system between men and women, so it's maintained. Throwing out a guess, genetic lines with less developed male nipples probably cause issues with properly developing nipples in the females.

Aging and death? We're not entirely certain, but we think it's related to your next point.

Cancer is considered to be a trade off. The genes that are most dangerous for cancer are related to wound healing. Turn certain ones off in rats and they become immune to cancer (I actually worked as a summer student in a lab that did this). They will also die from the first scratch they ever receive.

Cell apoptosis is viewed as a ""quick and dirty"" solution for dealing with cancerous cells. Evolution is *chock* full of quick and dirty solutions. Malaria resistence and sickle cell anemia.

The ER is for something killing you now. Walk in clinics are for something killing you soon. Urgent care is effectively a walk in clinic with faster access to the ER if you think it's serious.

Which is why we get ""6-8 hour"" ER waits in my city. Those people shouldn't be there, but the ER can't discharge them to go home without seeing them first just to be sure. Also many people don't realize you can just decide to go home yourself if the wait is looking long and it's clear you're not considered at immediate risk.

Guess the homeless in my town are a bit more vicious? I try to talk to them sometimes when I'm buying them a lunch and I get to hear the stories.

Either way, homelessness is horrible and I hope Finland's model inspires other countries. The ""Housing first"" approach has been very successful elsewhere in studies as well from what I've read."

Backpacks. If you ever see a scruffy adult carrying a backpack, there's a high chance they're homeless. Specifically beat up worn out clothes that have been around the block.

They can't wear too nice of clothes or it gets stolen from them."

hoi4,fehp3jf,t1_fehmz6y,1579121047.0,"No? There can be more than one type of mod. 

I like kaiserreich because it scrambles the allegiances/balance of the game to make a more interesting playing field. Less about historical accuracy, more about giving the player room to have impact.

It makes HoI4 feel more like EU4 when it comes to freedom of play. Vanilla HoI4 feels very constrictive to me. For me, that's the most important aspect of a mod."

That is not common practice in Canada at least. I was reading this paper about it:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4657773/

And it seems that while it does happen, it's actually restricted to a specific set of epilepsies caused by genetic mutations. However:

Having the flu itself also lowers seizure threshold and/or causes seizures in some people with epilepsy.

TIL, neat reading."
