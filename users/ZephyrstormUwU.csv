SolidWorks,feghx0o,t3_ep1j32,1579093298.0,It should already be installed if you have student edition. You need to go to the add-ins menu (tools>add-ins I think?? Don’t remember off the top of my head) and enable it.

Our intake prototype is pretty good and we have a good idea of what to do for our climber.

FRC,fcwewg1,t3_ej9ckp,1578023863.0,"First of all, as a rookie (and a veteran as well) one of the best things you can do is ask questions. Ask as many questions as possible about things you don’t understand or want to strengthen your knowledge on. 

Secondly, if you’re feel comfortable doing so, go around to different subteams on your team asking if you can help them do whatever they are doing. The best way to learn quickly is to learn by doing, without a doubt. Rotating through different subteams will help you find your place on the team and will help you understand how everything goes together to create a completed robot.

If you’re like me and you’re a little more reserved and introverted you can ask a mentor to help you find something to do. They might seem scary but they are there to *mentor* you. Also I know veteran team members may seem scary as well, but most don’t bite. They are living the chaotic life of a teenager as well and can empathize with you, since they were once rookies too!

I know you may feel lost right now (I’ve been there, I’m actually a rookie too lmao), but once the season starts I have a feeling you’ll find your place on the team!

SolidWorks,fctfam2,t3_eippu5,1577941417.0,"Mouse gestures are by far one of my favorite features in SolidWorks. If you hold right click and move the cursor in any direction, a circle with four commands will pop up and you can choose between them depending on which direction you move your cursor. You can map them to whatever you’d like and you can even make it so there are 8 commands in the circle rather than 4.

Another cool thing is if you press alt you’ll see that the first letter in File, Edit, etc. gets highlighted. If you hold alt and press any one of those letters the corresponding menu will open. This works for all of the submenus inside of those menus as well, so if you remember the letter combinations for certain commands you can navigate to them super quickly. For example, by holding alt and pressing T, T, and K sequentially it opens the Check Sketch for Feature command, which is one I use a lot. 

One minor thing I’d say is to keep things uncluttered. The only toolbars I have showing are a few in the row above the command manager and the heads up toolbar in the graphics pane. This means that my window is only populated by the commands I use the most, which has the added benefit of increasing the size of the graphics pane. Plus, you don’t really need much at all in your window when you can navigate to anything with shortcuts. 

Lastly, if you have the money and you find yourself dealing with large assemblies a lot, invest in a space mouse. They’re a little tricky to get used to, but once you’re proficient with it you can navigate around assemblies super fast. I don’t have one myself, but my school’s robotics team has one and I love using it."

3Dmodeling,fcs4opd,t3_eiln8y,1577911421.0,"(TL;DR at end)

So I don’t know how well this will be received since this is a 3D modeling subreddit and not really a CAD subreddit, but I’d honestly say you’d be better off using a parametric modeling program such as Fusion 360, SolidWorks, Onshape, etc. The difference being that in CAD programs you create solids and surfaces procedurally with sketches, dimensions, etc, and in direct modeling software such as Blender the 3D modeling is more free form and doesn’t really have a timeline like CAD programs do. In the tech industry, CAD is almost always used to design products since you usually have to do deal with tight specifications and tolerances. The concept artist you cited uses Rhinoceros 3D, which is itself a CAD program. Does this mean you can’t programs like Blender and Maya for product design? Absolutely not! Both kinds of programs are just as capable as the other, and direct modeling software is often better when dealing with super complex surfaces. 

If you’re going to go the CAD route, know that there isn’t really a free program that’s super powerful and as capable as the paid variants. 90% of the programs in this category are very expensive, with prices ranging from ~1000 USD to over 10000 USD with the top tier programs. But that absolutely doesn’t mean you have to spend that much. There are some pretty capable free open source programs such as FreeCAD and OpenSCAD. Fusion 360 and Onshape both offer free licenses to students. Solidworks also has a student license, but it’s not free. If you want the best of the best for cheap, I’d go for Solidworks Student Edition, because it offers everything Solidworks premium (which is $8000 normally) has to offer, and includes Dassault Systemes’ rendering software, Visualize. 

TL;DR: If you’d like to use direct modeling software, absolutely go with Blender. If you’d like to go the CAD route, go with Fusion360 student license, FreeCAD, or Onshape student license. If you can spend a little bit of cash, I’d go for Solidworks student edition. If you can spend a lot of cash, the standard version of any of these programs will be great.

Good luck!"

I mean obviously it wouldn’t prevent people from getting rabies, but it could prevent you from dying. The treatment they use right now for late stage rabies patients is to put them into a medically induces coma and just hope their body can fight the disease (while providing the necessary fluids of course). Even then most people still die, but it’s the only successful treatment that they’ve been able to reproduce."
