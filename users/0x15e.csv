2016 brought a big flood and took out everything. The MPV got scrapped and I sold the Protégé to a friend for $100. I kept the Miata, however, since I figured it would be much easier to get right again. I replaced the other two with a 2004 Volvo V70 2.5T that had seen some serious abuse.

I managed to limp the Volvo along until this past spring when someone in a Fit totaled it. After attempting to daily the Miata (daily driving your project can be, uh, stressful) and having it break down one too many times, I picked up a 2014 Mazda 2 to replace the Volvo. It's not as luxurious by any stretch but it's a great car. 

So I'm starting 2020 with my 1993 Miata project and 2014 Mazda 2 daily."

Cartalk,fcstteh,t3_eie4se,1577924933.0,"I owned a Valentine One. Everything about it was great but ultimately (after many years) I decided the whole tech was useless. There are so many false positives that you just end up doing the limit everywhere which, honestly, is what you should be doing anyway. 

And you know what? I still got a couple of tickets in the early days after I got it (before I slowed down in general). Not because I ignored it or missed a warning but because the police are using non-radar and non-laser speed tech now. They pace you, there's VASCAR, and there are police in helicopters timing you going between landmarks. If you live in a state with a lot of speed enforcement / velocity taxation all a radar detector will do is annoy you. 

So my recommendation is to save your money and just drive the limit. Did it save me a couple of tickets? Yes. I know for a fact that it saved me at least one laser ticket and probably a couple of Ka band tickets in my younger days, but when the time came to install the wiring in my new cars, I decided it just wasn't worth the noise and let it go."

The main advantage to using the arcade hardware is that you'll actually be able to afford games that aren't multicarts or flash carts. Do a price comparison between the MVS and home cart versions of Mark of the Wolves as an example. Other games, like Shock Troopers, never even got a home release."

neogeo,fck5pmj,t3_ehf9m0,1577717337.0,"I should open up my League Bowling cart and see if there's an obvious comm chip there for the link port. 

Other than that, no. None had chips like that other than the endless game of cat and mouse they were playing near the end with security chips / bootlegs.

The reason for that was it just didn't need it for the most part. It could already do its own scaling and between the fast processor and huge rom sizes it could fake nearly anything else that was appropriate for the platform. Want to render something 3d looking? Just pre-render every possible angle and put it in the rom. Want music that the YM2612 can't do? Just render it all out as one pcm file and put it in the rom. (Both examples from Blazing Star)

The thing about the Neo is that it wasn't competing with the home systems, not even a little bit. It was made fast enough from the get-go that it didn't need a million dsp chips like Nintendo did. It was made with an arcade audio synth chip so it didn't need a cd peripheral to do get clear voices like Sega did. And when people thought they wanted grainy, low framerate 3d that necessitated the Super FX and SVP chips? The Neo didn't do that because it's a 2d arcade machine. Operators would just use other hardware for that, and eventually the Hyper Neo 64 would do those games for SNK."

Miata,fcgrkot,t1_fbru3v7,1577643347.0,"> These cars are old enough that even if they're not leaking externally, age can degrade the o rings inside the master cylinder and reduce their ability to effectively seal, and therefore push fluid to the brakes.

I really appreciate the detail and thought you put into your response and it made me put some more thought into things as well. 

My pads and rotors aren't performance parts but they're also definitely not bargain basement either. When I replaced them years ago I used the same brand and model as I put on my Mazdaspeed Protégé and it could stop so hard the back end came around. Different cars from different eras, true, but I don't think *those* parts are bad, unless you think it's possible for a ceramic pad to just lose grip over time while the car is parked (it spends a lot of time parked). 

All that said, I'd completely forgotten about brake lines (woops). Those have never been changed and they're now 27 years old. For that matter they were about 17 years old when I got the car. It's probably a great opportunity to get some speed bleeders and flush the whole system while I'm at it. I've done some reading and everyone suggests OEM rubber or, for some cost savings, SS lines from FM or 949. Do you have a recommendation there? 

After that, and after some new tires, I may look into a master cylinder brace, but I expect those hoses are exactly what I need."
