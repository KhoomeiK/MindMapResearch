cats,fdmhc0s,t3_em5aga,1578549918.0,Maybe try getting him his own bed or put a cat condo in your room for him to sleep on. It should at least cut down on the frequency of his vicious attacks lol

CatTraining,fd55xtm,t3_ejy2vl,1578174516.0,"Since you said your litter boxes are clean, and the vet cleared him for any issues, here's a few things that are worth a try:

-steam clean carpet, and wash anything he has peed on (also try a cleaning product that removes pet urine odor)

- get rid of the cardboard boxes since they are unnecessary (some cats are weird and like to pee on cardboard or other paper) 

-keep him out of your room to prevent him from peeing on your bed

It might seem kind of strange, but try putting litter boxes in the areas he is peeing- like put one in the bathroom (or the bathtub). For some reason it helps too if there is not a lid on top of the litter box. It also helps to have multiple boxes. I'm talking around 3-4. So one near the dog's beds, one in the bathroom, and the rest ANYWHERE he is peeing. 

Some cats get stressed with change, so it is more than likely he will stop ""spite peeing"". But until then, it is important that you reinforce the hell out of good litter box habits. As he shows improvement with using the boxes, you can slowly reduce the quantity of boxes, and slowly move the boxes over a number of days towards the permanent location you'd like the litter box to be. If you see him use the box, give him a treat and tell him how good he is.

It can be a lengthy process, but it should work. It is just important to remember that cats do not respond to negative reinforcement, being locked up, and sometimes even the word ""no"", so all you can really do is put boxes everywhere until he stops throwing his little tantrum, and reward him when he pees in the box. I had a cat with this issue once, so I can assure you there is hope lol"

cats,fc4x40n,t1_fc4sung,1577432121.0,"Every time I would let her outside I would shake the bell so she would associate it with the door opening, and getting to go out would be the reward. Eventually she just kinda got it. You just have to make sure the bell is hanging low enough that they can reach it by standing on their back paws."
cats,fc4rsk5,t3_eg657l,1577426040.0,"My previous senior cat had cancer which made it painful for her to eat. Shortly after, we decided to lay her to rest. Before we realized her condition, the best way we discovered to get her to eat was to water down wet cat food so it was soupy and easy to lap up. Another method we used was tuna. It can be used as a snack when they aren't eating much of anything else, and you can also drizzle the wet cat food with the juice from the tuna which gives it a strong appetizing smell for them. 

I hope Smokey feels better soon!"
cats,fc4ra04,t3_eg65go,1577425522.0,"We used to have a little bell hanging from the handle on our patio door and when my cat wanted out she would reach up and ring it lol and when she wanted inside she would usually just sit on the deck outside the glass door and glare into the kitchen until we noticed her.

Thankfully she was a sweet old lady cat and never left our yard. Otherwise I would have been to afraid to let her outside."
cats,fc4qkgy,t1_fc4pyd7,1577424822.0,"Yikes that is a steep price... I don't know what kind of apartment situation you're living in, but maybe if you asked your landlord you could get a discount on the additional deposit. Strictly because it is only a second cat and not some massive dog. Never hurts to ask lol but I am glad to hear you guys are willing to do what it takes for her happiness! It sounds like she won the forever home lottery :)"

cats,fc4pevv,t1_fc4o5jm,1577423721.0,Absolutely can confirm that the cat will ruin the carpet by scratching. My boyfriend's cat used to do this when he wanted out of our bedroom in the morning and it does not look so great lol but I agree with what you said. Playtime followed by mealtime is key!
cats,fc4oz0y,t3_eg6hhq,1577423313.0,"I adopted a kitten recently (about 3 months old) and she also was keeping me up. One of the ways I found to help her to sleep was to play with her for a decent amount of time before bed. But in all honesty, the best decision I made for her that helped her behavior SIGNIFICANTLY was adopting another kitten. Now she has a brother who is slightly younger and they spend their days entertaining each other and keeping each other out of trouble. They also cuddle up together every night. 

I understand your cat is a bit older than mine, but I still consider a year old cat a ""kitten"" since they still have all of that wonderful energy. Having two cats isn't always much different than having one, and the benefits of it are completely worth it. Plus, ya know, twice the cuteness....üíïüíï"
CatTraining,fc3moi5,t3_eg0edz,1577393364.0,"Although I personally do not have experience with this, I do have cats and volunteer with cats at an animal shelter. The best thing I could suggest would be to call a shelter near you and ask them for advice. Volunteers are usually more than happy to offer advice over the phone in my experience. They would much rather try to help you than have your cats possibly end up at the shelter if their behavior doesn't sort out. It's worth a try! Your vets office might even be able to provide some insight over the phone."
