Noticed Sunoco in my town started carrying Social (formerly Select) CBD patches. 60MG delivered over a 24 hour period. 2.5MG per hour doesn’t seem like much to me but I don’t know. I’ve heard good things about the brand. Sheetz (I’m from Pennsylvania) sells Select disposable CBD Vapes, but they’re a bit pricey I believe."

Like I said there was no way to transport her to an animal hospital, she was flailing around, breaking the quills off inside of her making the situation much worse.

Edit: I’d like to see you guys try removing porcupine quills from a dog that weights almost 100 lb and is flailing around without somehow sedating them. This was the same dog that needed sedation to clip her toe nails, and still freaked out on the vet tech AFTER being sedated, leading to her spraying her anal glands on the tech. People are acting like I gave her a whole bottle of everclear. A sip of mouthwash would be more harmful than 12oz of light beer.."
dogs,fc2wqxn,t1_fc2d9qe,1577376083.0,"Had to give my GSP beer once. We were at camp, and she had free roam around the property. At night she would usually stay around the camp, but one night she wandered off in the woods. Now she did have a shock caller on, but very rarely did she ever need shocked (there was a vibrate function as well, and she always responded to that). Opened the door to let her in, and she wasn’t there. Vibrated her collar, no response. Shocked on the lowest level, no response. Kept turning it up, got no response. Finally we heard a loud yelp from way back in the woods that clearly wasn’t because of the shock caller as I wasn’t transmitting anything to it at the time of the yelp. Eventually she ran back to the house just covered in porcupine needles. Now keep in mind we are at least an hour away from any animal hospitals or anything like that, and she’s in a ton of pain. She wouldn’t let us remove the needles, so we had to sedate her somehow. Poured some beer in a bowl, she drank it up, after just a few minutes she was calmed down and we were able to remove the needles."

Took me a minute to figure that one out while reading it. My mind  kept repeating mac-hine."
