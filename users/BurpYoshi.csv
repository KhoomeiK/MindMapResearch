AskReddit,fek52qs,t1_fek2qcb,1579192778.0,"I know that's what he was saying,that's exactly what I was disagreeing with. Sorry if I wasn't making that clear. I'm saying in most places, men and women in the same car together won't usually have the man driving almost always - at least for the reason that there's a stereotype that men should be the driver. I can understand maybe this occurrs for the older generatoon, but the context was a question aimed at redditors who - let's be real, 90% are under 30. I'd say more than that but it makes no difference."
AskReddit,fek0kxt,t1_fejzs9x,1579190033.0,"Not sure where you're from but I think it's unlike most places. I'm from the UK and I'm pretty sure most of europe and the USA don't have the expectation of a male driver. There's a difference between expecting someone to do something and expecting them to be good at it. I know logically in most cases you'd expect the better person to do a task they're better at, but in this circumstance I don't think at all that some people thinking women are bad drivers has any meaningful impact on the expectation for them not to drive at all. That's like saying if you're bad at a subject at school you just won't show up for any lessons. Doesn't make sense."
