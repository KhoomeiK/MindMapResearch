trashy,feujb1q,t1_feo8jhf,1579387051.0,"An inventory management system centers around a SKU (Stock Keeping Unit, also known as an item number, part number, product number, BOM number). Every single thing transacted on has to have a unique SKU. Pink Oral-B Model X toothbrushes, purple Oral-B Model X toothbrushes, orange Model Y Target Brand Toothbrushes, etc etc for every single thing the store sells or wants to track.

A SKU has any number of different attributes which can be set to help organize transactions and build reports for management. Usually there will be some kind of text description of what the item is, a business unit/product line to check on how different families of product are doing, accounting codes, tax info, country of origin, etc. One very important attribute is product price-- what you sell one unit of a product for. One SKU has one price. So a convenient way to track your display unit is to set up a separate SKU for it, to make sure you have it for inventory counts but also to make sure you don't accidentally sell it. Since you're not actually selling your display unit there's no sense in wasting resources determining a selling price. So it either defaults to one cent or the company has a process to just punch in one cent during SKU setup in the system."
