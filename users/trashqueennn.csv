trashy,ffa9c3o,t1_ffa8bnr,1579730411.0,"I remember when I was 15, and this 25 year old dude suddenly started hanging out with my best friend who was also 15, her little sister who was 13 and myself. We were so excited that an older guy was hanging with us and we thought it made us so cool. It got to the point where this guy was spending the night at my best friend’s house and her parents were completely okay with it. Another time, we were at the public pool and I was eating nachos and some cheese fell on my boob and this dude actually licked it off my boob. 

I’m 31 now and looking back, I’m absolutely disgusted by this man. He was a complete pedophile and we were too young to even notice. And the thought that her parents were letting him sleep at their house? Absolutely disgusting."
trashy,ffa8rsn,t3_esdti9,1579730095.0,One of my friends shared this guys post on Facebook. I guess she had a ton of mutual friends with him.

Metalcore,fe0jj12,t3_enatet,1578814427.0,"My husband and I saw them on their Graveyard Shift tour. We had VIP tickets, so we got early entry, live Q&A, we got to meet them and get a picture (seriously the nicest dudes ever) and we had front row the entire concert. They’re my favorite band, so I was so excited. I caught one of Ricky’s guitar picks."

RedDeadMoonshiners,fdzth29,t3_emlfry,1578795412.0,I’ve been searching and haven’t found it either. I’m a bit confused on what to. Am I supposed to do a Moonshiner mission and then wait or can I just hope I stumble on it without doing anything?

Edit: I found it."
trashy,fdzl5qd,t1_fdzeksc,1578791223.0,"Thank you. It’s been 7 years and it still sucks, but she’s not in any sort of pain anymore. I’m thankful for that part. Seeing her after chemo was awful. She couldn’t walk up the stairs to lay down and would just collapse on the couch and sleep for hours. But she was the strongest and bravest person I know."
trashy,fdz4i8l,t1_fdxxrxp,1578786634.0,"My mom used to do whatever she could to try to get rid of her colon cancer. She once had my dad and I go to a woman who said that reading your palms/could tell you what was wrong with you. In the end, my mom ended up buying tons of colon cleansing stuff. All it did of course, was never let her leave the toilet, poor thing. Then doctors told her that IVs of some type of fruit extract would help a little. So she tried that.. nothing happened. She went on a complete vegan diet, buying cereal that cost $11 from some hippie shop in our town where the owner refused to drive a car and rode a bike, had dreads and didn’t wear shoes while working. 

The cancer finally spread to her lungs, a tumor ruptured and she died."

relationship_advice,fdklatq,t3_elu3tc,1578505903.0,"My parents used to do things similar to this. When I was a teen, my best friend and I had a notebook that we’d just pass back and forth with notes to each other in them. Once it was finally full, I’d stuff it under my bed and get a new notebook for us. Well one day, my parents went in my room while I was gone and took the notebook and read it. It had things in it that I didn’t feel comfortable talking to them about. They also took notes from my first boyfriend (the boy I lost my virginity to) and would read them and hide them. Any time they would get mad at me, they would throw all of this stuff in my face (ex. they’d be like “oh, well we know you did this and let’s just say we’re pretty disappointed”)

I had zero privacy as a teen and that made me sort of rebel and find other ways to keep things from my parents."
StraightPegging,fdiex9w,t3_elgf8o,1578441358.0,"That’s awesome to hear! My husband and I are going to be having our first pegging experience soon and I’m pretty excited. My husband is opening up to new kinks and that makes me happy. Ive never been one to talk dirty (I never know what to say and kind of a bit shy with that), so he’s always been the talker. Maybe this new experience will help me open up more myself."

aww,fdf0jne,t3_ekxxoo,1578350577.0,My husband’s parents feed the squirrels in the neighborhood. The little things will run up to their back door and just sit there until my FIL comes out to feed them. They’ll run up to him and take nuts out of his hands. They’re very trusting of him and my MIL.

StraightPegging,fdcta38,t1_fdcszuc,1578283689.0,"Thank you! I’ve only ever used one finger one him, but he has a prostate plug he really likes using. I’m just nervous because it usually takes him a minute or two to get the plug inserted and we use lots of lube. I don’t know if he’s just not relaxing enough or if something else is wrong. Also, what’s a good lune to use? We currently use AstroGlide and it seems to dry pretty quickly."
StraightPegging,fdcq17d,t1_fdcp03i,1578281166.0,Thank you! I agree that we should start out with a smaller one. I’ll talk to him more about this.

Edit: I only read the header and not the tweet. I apologize. I think what she’s doing is awesome and it’s really shitty that people are scamming her."

She grew up and is now into Pop and theater stuff, like Hamilton. It sucks that she didn’t keep listening to metal."

RedDeadOnline,fcb23zx,t3_egqurp,1577581247.0,"I was playing a few days ago and a posse showed up as red on the map. I tried to avoid them and then the next thing I know, they ran up and shot my horse and then killed me. I respawn and they come right back after me. I ran off and not even ten minutes later, there they are again, killing me and my horse. At this point, I’m on my third horse and annoyed. I switch lobbies and get a message saying “No matter where you go, we’ll find you.” And of course they found me in another lobby. I shot one with a shotgun and they message me, telling me that they’re reporting me for harassment. Wtf."
