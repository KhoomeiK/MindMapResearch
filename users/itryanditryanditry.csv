povertyfinance,ffct6yq,t3_esv6lr,1579806759.0,"I help me dad out because he's done a lot for me and we have actually bought a house with a fully self sufficient basement because we plan on him living with us sooner or later. I don't begrudge having to help him because he's done a lot for me but sometimes it's hard for us to do so I only do it when we can. He isn't expectant or demanding about it and I know he hates asking.

Honestly it would be more beneficial financially if he did move in with us because he could help share the bills and help with babysitting. The down side is the loss of freedoms and privacy for everyone.

All of that being said my retirement fund is not looking good and I refuse to put the same burden on my kids. As another user said if I get to the point I can't support myself that's when I check out."

headphones,ff6p0qt,t3_ep8ftc,1579631881.0,I was given a pair of Bose Soundsport Free headphones and I was wondering about the fit. Are they supposed to fit into your ear canal like other IEMs or do they just kind of point into and seal around the opening to your canal? These don't block nearly as much sound as other IEMs I have and I was wondering if I just had the wrong tips on or if they just are not as sound isolating. They seem to stay put well so the fit as far as that goes seems good.

Also it's not a requirement, if you look at the system requirements there is literally no mention of SSDs. 100% disk utilization or such a degradation in a performance that makes it a pain to use after only 3 years is not acceptable.

I'm not arguing that there are a vast improvement but if this is the case manufacturers really need to stop shipping machines with HDDs and Microsoft needs to commit to saying they are required. This whole ""sure you can run it on a HDD but it will run like garbage"" loophole is nonsense. Is 10 really that much more r/w intensive?

These computers are 3 year old i5s with 8GB RAM and they are running like they are 10 years old after the update. It's frustrating. Between this and the Windows 10  updates breaking stuff every time they are released is really making me dislike Microsoft. Thankfully all of our students are on Chromebooks now."

The economy had a much steeper climb during the Obama years and Trump is just riding the wave to shore. I hope that you at least look at these figures and don't just dismiss this because it does not fit your narrative because there really is absolutely no arguing that Obama did far more to better the economy than Trump. Also if you look at some of the figures you will see that Trump is digging us a hole not counting the consequences of some of deregulation you spoke of.

 So now you have a bunch of people in need shooting themselves in the foot every day fighting against socialism giving up a chance for a better life because maybe one day the American dream will happen to them and they will be damned if they will give up a dollar of it to help someone else.

So we could pay $3600 at the doctor or $60 at the health department.

 We complained to the health provider and they said they do not negotiate prices because their prices are fair. How does that make any sense? It's not just Texas it's the whole country that is screwed up."
