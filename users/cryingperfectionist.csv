When I was 7, my teacher used to say this to me in front of other students. I was extremely embarrassed of being known as the shy girl who could never say anything. I learned that shyness is wrong and something is wrong with who I am. I needed to change.

I tried to change for years but I failed. I couldn't get rid of my shyness and it developed into social anxiety disorder. And how am I now? Full of self-hatred, struggling with self-harm and suicidal thoughts. I still believe that something is wrong with me. 

Some students just aren't so talkative and they don't want to raise their hands in class. Teachers should be more understanding. Shy kids have other ways to show that they learned something, they can write for example. They can do well in exams. I never raised my hand even though I knew the answer. I was extremely angry at myself for not being brave enough."
OCD,fefms7z,t3_eow8jt,1579059716.0,Same and I feel like no one understands. The world is a dangerous place. It's better to avoid living my life.
OCD,fe6a8jf,t3_enriba,1578885287.0,"I used to have this fear as well. It got easier with time and some days I was brave enough to watch youtube videos about schizophrenia. Those videos made me understand how this illness can be treated.

Now I know that if my fear came true, there would be people who can help me and take care of me. There's medication too. So it doesn't mean that this illness would last forever."
selfharm,fdryp1a,t1_fdrsgqp,1578691744.0,"I was talking to a counsellor. It was one of those days when talking about my problems makes me feel worse. I think I'm okay now, thanks!"
OCD,fdk2uia,t1_fdjy9r7,1578494699.0,Sometimes talking to a pastor might help too. They are not mental health professionals though. I talk to my pastor but he isn't familiar with OCD. The only thing he can do is to reassure me that I'm safe and my fears and thoughts are not true. I have to try my best to believe he is right. I need a therapist too though.
selfharm,fdjtgt2,t1_fdjbbki,1578486907.0,My parents found out and they want me to stop but I don't want to. I hate being in this situation.
OCD,fdiy6lr,t3_ellr11,1578453740.0,I've had similar thoughts. Religion should be something positive but my OCD makes it so difficult sometimes that I have to distance myself from it for a while to lessen the obsessions.
socialanxiety,fdix9rp,t3_elhrwe,1578453130.0,Medication (beta blockers) was the only thing that helped me.
BPD,fdf0tg5,t1_fdek0wb,1578350748.0,"I can relate. When I told my psychiatrist that I think I might have a personality disorder (possibly ocpd, but I also have avpd and bpd traits so I don't know), she judged me immediately. I felt like I wasn't taken seriously, she said I'm ""too young"" to be diagnosed. I'm 21. I think it has something to do with the stigma of personality disorders. I don't care, I just need help. I have been suffering for years and it would be nice to get appropriate treatment so that's why diagnosis matters to me."
