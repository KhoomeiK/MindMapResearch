On another note, this is why I've stayed clear of p\*rn for many years. Regardless what justifications people give to watch it, it's damaging.

Often, we can't really know the condition the people performing are in."
offmychest,fcx6w23,t3_ejcacb,1578053688.0,"Hey, thanks for sharing.

Being bullied is awful, it can have very long lasting negative consequences mentally. I'm sorry you had to go though this. Many of us have and it's not nice.

Sometimes, people only change when they go thorough life altering situations, such as being terminally ill. This is often a time when they reflect back and many regrets (many that they didn't know) resurface. Sometimes they may want to rectify some wrongs but maybe they can't do to many reasons.

Looking back, we can all probably understand why you did what you did. I do. Some may even justify. But, in all honesty, if we're being honest, what you did was also ""bullying"".

You kicked a person when they were already down. And this may haunt you because you know what you did wasn't good. In a sense, you became the bully.

I'm not judging. I may have done the same thing.

Now that the situation no longer exists, maybe it's a good time to reflect back and use this as an opportunity to grow. And it may hurt.

The only way you can truly move forward is to let go of the resentment that you still may have for this person. If you don't, you'll be a slave to these feelings for a long time.

A few good steps may be to:

\- admit that your actions where not justified and were wrong

\- admit that this person did not deserve to die (you've done this, well done)

\- admit that if you could go back in time, as the person you are now, you would have done things differently

\- forgive the bully

\- forgive yourself

&#x200B;

Perhaps you'll find peace."

LiverpoolFC,fcuag5b,t3_eixt54,1577976397.0,"Hendo is a very good midfielder if we appreciate what he brings. He can play pretty much all midfield positions but the holding mid is probably the one where he excels. Trouble is Klopp has played him everywhere in midfield.

I think Fabinho is the best mid we have, but Hendo is close second.

In terms of greatest ever...absolutely no chance. Let's not get sentimental here, Hendo is a very good player but not to the standard of Souness,  MÃ¸lby , Gerrard, Kenny etc.

I've never liked that he was made captain when Gerrard left because to me a captain has to be on of the best players in the pitch. But over the past few years Hendo has reached that level.

I don't think he has the greatest technical ability but he has a presence."
