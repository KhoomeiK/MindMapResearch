I know you mean well, but the ""you are loved"" routine is overused and not helpful, we understand you are trying to help us but an answer like that doesnt help us.

Often we know people care about us, for example in my case, i have a girlfriend a relatively active social circle and loving parents. And yet still i attempted to commit suicide. Next time try incorporate personal experiences, facts about life or something like that. We well and truly apreciate you looking out for us, dont get me wrong i dont want to discourage you from trying to help us, in fact i really want to encourage it. But try to take this advice to heart, go out looking on the internet for more information, contact proffesionals, talk with people who suffer from depression and suicidal ideation. 

Best of luck to you"

I found the easiest way quite fast.

Ofcourse i dont want anybody to commit suicide, but if someone attempts it the worst thing that can happen is that they survive and are permanently damaged because of it.
If you are gonna go through with your plans please please wait, wait one day or 2, make sure this isnt an impulsive reaction on an event. Try to contact someone, a friend, a family member, and tell them about your feelings, if you are going to go through with this they will find out anyway. 
If you are looking for it its here [for you](http://lostallhope.com) but before you do act on your urge i insist you wait for a set amount of time, dont make an impulsive decision on something of this caliber.
If you go through with it make sure you do it right, you will often only have one shot at this and if you fail the consequences can be disastrous.

1. Try to get therapy or some other form of proffesional help, noone can get through this alone and come out the otherside happier and healthier.  Noone will look down on you for going to therapy.

2. Another redditor already said this but, its possible that you can get (partial) custody over the child if you file for divorce and state that its due to her cheating.

3. The current job market is very competitive, its going to be hard finding a job, but not impossible. This is not your fault, you cant blame yourself for not finding a job. Try to keep aplying and see where that lands you, eventually someone will say yes.

4. Your daughter will not be mad at you for divorcing your wife later on in life, she might not understand now but when shes old enough she will understand your decision making.

Blue collar fields do not pay as well as higher level jobs do, yeah it was a bit of hyperbole to make a point but there is definetly a core of truth in there.

The claim about it being a job of passion does not negate my claim that they are jobs that people choose because they are easier. Cars are somethung you emcouter everyday, you far easier develop a interest in something you come in contact with regularly and cars definitely fit that description. People that dont come into contact with fields like biology, law, chemistry, physics or economics will rarely develop a passion for it, if you dont give people the knowledge about other options ofcourse they will choose the option they know. Its like giving someone 2 plates of food, they have to pay for them both one is a bit cheaper and they know it will taste alright, the other one is unknown to them and costs a little more, though it could taste much better. They will nearly always choose the one they choose, its the safer bet, however if you let them taste both plates in a small way before hand they may sooner choose the other plate as they already know that they like it (or ofcourse not) 




My other point was trying to say this,


The immigrant basis of the nations you mentioned (australia and canada) are in my mind inconsequential to the higher test scores of those nations. The percentual difference between immigrant ratios is far from enough to explain the higher scores in testing. 

Have a nice day, and goodnight (for whenever you finally get to sleep)"

American education is objectively worse, ofcourse you can say they prepare people for blue collar jobs such as electrician, but that limits the potential of humans. If people aren't pushed to be more and do more they will choose the easier route, and in this case manual labour is the easier road.

There is no big shortage of labourers in most other western nations and so it makes no sense to ""prepare"" them for their future job in an underpaying overworked field. Equipping people with general knowledge about the world, including history, economics, mathematics, physics, chemistry and so much more allows people to later choose for themselves what path they want to go down with a more educated way of looking at the world.

[though the US spends more per capita on education its still lacking behind alot of nations](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/07/us-education-spending-finland-south-korea&ved=2ahUKEwj9-9fQzPLmAhURIlAKHeOTBFAQFjABegQIDxAJ&usg=AOvVaw3W-2M90KPqSqugfN3zihsD&ampcf=1)

All of this combined might lead one to think that the US school system is defficient in many ways. Ofcourse its not as horrid as this sub likes to paint it, but there is no question about it that on avarage americans are more ignorant about the outside world and how it works than citizens of other western nation. I also find the excuse of they have more immigrants then we do lacking in basis, it would not explain the higher scores in testing then american citizens without taking the education system in account."
