Also all jokes aside, *holy snot* that is gorgeous."
dogswithjobs,fctau8v,t1_fcta27i,1577937579.0,Definitely.
dogswithjobs,fct9wi2,t1_fct9gld,1577936816.0,"Yeah it's a combo of handler know-how and the dog's own training. I'd bring a backup plan but i can't think of a flight where a combination of knowing how to prepare + the dog's own training wouldn't take care of it. 

I like contingency plans, but still."
dogswithjobs,fct9saa,t1_fct84sp,1577936719.0,"What I would have done with my small service dog for a long-haul flight:
1. Restrict food and water intake before flight if feasible
2. Toilet dog before flight, as immediately as possible
3. Bring potty pads and scented trash bags
4. If she started signaling a need to go potty, take her to the bathroom, put potty pads on floor, signal dog to use potty pads
5. Wrap those in like six layers of scented trash bag"
TrueOffMyChest,fct80ob,t1_fcsqsfi,1577935311.0,">it's important to never do something that contradicts a trainer 

Bless the pants off of you. As a service dog handler and hopefully future service dog trainer, BLESS YOU."
SubredditDrama,fcsaj49,t1_fcs8yju,1577913814.0,"Yeah, it just REALLY confused my first college roommate lmao. I've heard so many stories of a dumbass getting drunk and lost IN ANCHORAGE that I don't risk it."
SubredditDrama,fcr79so,t1_fcr603s,1577897798.0,Yeah no kidding.
SubredditDrama,fcr5903,t1_fcr3eq8,1577896962.0,"Yeah, nah, one of those things I like about the lower 48is that my disabled ass is not SOL in winter."
SubredditDrama,fcqyvpv,t1_fcqy83o,1577894278.0,"Yeah, I think I'll stick with SW CO. I've never felt homesick for a place right up until I graduated and had to leave there. Like, there were things I missed about AK but it was easy to find solid reasons I hated living there. Thanks for the suggestion though!"
SubredditDrama,fcquzmi,t1_fcqtzib,1577892624.0,"Depends on what part of AK you're in. Anchorage is where I was at, and we were basically where anything shipped up ended up first. I've heard a regular-sized jar of mayo costs like $10 in the bush, which is basically the definition of BFE. 

My personal experiences are from living in the most lower 48-like part of the state."
SubredditDrama,fcqsiiw,t1_fcqr73p,1577891527.0,"Oh my god I looked at going to grad school at UAA and GCI's fucking third-world cellphone-ass internet prices and remembering the shit I hate about living up there made me  go ""...fuck it, no, FUCK this place.""

I think to some degree people born in Alaska have an affinity for vast wild places coded into them. Big cities in the lower 48 hit me with the kind of terror I think being lost in some of the more wild parts of Alaska hit other people with. Like, you get used to the idea that nature is mechanically inimical to human life and that you have to take care, but big cities have tons of people and those people are *capable of malice*.  Nature's indifference to your life is just that, indifference. Malice is scarier to me. 

The only place I found that seemed like it has enough similar to Alaska for me to satisfy some of what I still miss about that place is Southwestern Colorado, weirdly enough. I think Alaska just put mountains and snow in my blood."
SubredditDrama,fcqp9f4,t1_fcqog3m,1577889957.0,"AHAHAHA I'm the rule-breaker then. I could not wait to get the fuck OUT of Alaska for all the reasons you describe. Like, Anchorage is fucking weird and a town with a malignant growth, I'm too fond of internet and not paying $2 for a hand of bananas that costs $0.75 in the lower 48, and the idea of being able to drive to pretty much anywhere big is revolutionary. 

I admit there are things I miss but they're things I can 100% get down here in other places."
SubredditDrama,fcqlziv,t1_fcq6s0e,1577888357.0,"As someone who grew up there, I present to you the fact that people legitimately go missing and die in Anchorage city limits. I was raised on stories of dipshits like the guy who wants to pull this stunt *dying* because they are dumb as hell and do not respect that Ma Nature is an uncaring bitch and will crush you. 

I still have a habit of telling people if I'm going somewhere unscheduled because I was raised to think that's how you keep Alaska from killing you."
JUSTNOMIL,fcp9ar5,t1_fcov9k0,1577854883.0,"Yeah I would seriously consider having a recorded conversation where i got them to confirm they laid a violent hand on my dog without my consent. 

As I am currently in Texas and my dog was a service dog, and my next one will be too, that's [against the law here](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.42.htm#42.091). An attack is a misdemeanor, injury is a state jail felony if injured, 3rd degree felony if it causes the loss of the service dog's life.

This is one of the few things I like about Texas."

*you kept checking in on her*. Like. If I had been there I would have been looking at HER to see if it was ok to laugh. I have a pretty dark sense of humor myself and I have two relatives that were murdered and lemme tell you, I woulda dropped that one on you if you had done that, and I would have yukked it up hard with you over it only so long as you kept checking on me, because that shit can go ""fuck you hit a nerve"" real quick."
