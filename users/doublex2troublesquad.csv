You might want to draw a hard line between work and personal life considering you're posting ALL of you online, that may not go over well with HR.

A good manager should be approachable, you want your employees to trust in you and feel like you can help them solve any problems. E.g let them know you are there for them, keep your door open when you're in your office (open door policy)

If you don't think you are aggressive, defensive etc, Ask for examples of what you may have done in order to remedy the situation. 

it sort of sounds like people want to get to know you better in order to like you as a manager."
