HaggardGarage,fep99tf,t1_feolkdx,1579315007.0,I was considering painting my car calypso red but ended up opting for Brilliant rot.
HaggardGarage,feo50i3,t1_feni5y0,1579295196.0,What a sick color that is. I'm also a big fan of Mazdas red.
GreenBayPackers,fej4308,t3_epdgup,1579156135.0,Championship match with record setting performances in this weather would be legendary.
gaming,fej27n2,t3_epamd8,1579154182.0,I trace this habit back to Halo for me.
todayilearned,fe52xju,t1_fe3aadw,1578865190.0,Reminds me of a WW2 vet in my  small little town. He flew several succesful bomber missions only to be taken out by a rogue propane tank in our tiny local dump/waste facility.
HaggardGarage,fdzmde6,t1_fdyx5vg,1578791667.0,"Dakar yellow would look great, especially with an LTW wing. Beautiful."
HaggardGarage,fdvmbcd,t1_fdtx6s4,1578748975.0,Thanks for answering my question.
HaggardGarage,fdpks5r,t1_fdpjllc,1578631360.0,"Totally agree. I don't know if that red is vinyl or reflection though, but if its vinyl I'm not a fan at all. The spokes on the wheels seem a little too thin and lacking also. Little lower too, yeah?"
classicwow,fdnre7r,t1_fdn3gvf,1578591338.0,Me too :P
todayilearned,fdmhqkg,t1_fdm6vks,1578550323.0,As I read the comment I'm thinking the same thing and am pretty surprised by the  amount of downvotes. I guarantee you everyone downvoting pronounces something wrong or makes somewhat comment grammatical errors. We're not perfect - big deal.
todayilearned,fdmhj3d,t1_fdlwgzz,1578550113.0,"""Pizzaguy"" is too stoned LOL"
classicwow,fdmh29m,t1_fdmcw2t,1578549654.0,Let's just keep things civil.
classicwow,fdmbt6f,t3_elx72o,1578544975.0,"I'm astonished that the talent tree ""Beast Mastery"" didn't pique his curiosity lol."
classicwow,fdmbmqg,t1_fdlmyjs,1578544829.0,People misuse the boomer insult so much its ironically funny. Calling him a taco would make as much sense as calling him a boomer based on what he said.
HaggardGarage,fdk9c4c,t1_fdispcm,1578499014.0,"The irony of you calling me a snowflake is way too rich coming from the guy who gets his panties in a bunch over a random bald guy in his mid thirties. ""Hijacked our sub"" lol boohoo."
HaggardGarage,fdhguc1,t1_fdh905y,1578422358.0,"I know WHY you hate him, that wasnt the question. The question is: Why bother spending your time hating on some nobody? You criticized some Donald Trump hater per your comment history for essentially doing the same thing you're doing - wasting your time hating on someone. There are people I really dislike on YouTube, like a lot.... but I just don't watch their channel and avoid them like the plague. Besides, I think you're just in it for the memes, because any true Tommy hater would give a lot more reasons than the basic scammer/bald stuff. Why don't you guys do something productive with your anger and try to do something about him scamming his viewers then?"
HaggardGarage,fdh7fhb,t1_fdgacrm,1578417009.0,To be honest I don't see why people hate YouTubers. I say that because generally if you dislike a person you stop watching their channel before letting this weird hatred build up. If you take a step back and look at the entire situation it's strange that a bunch of men in their 20s partake in a subreddit that is essentially dedicated to hating on some random 30yo guy in CT.
HaggardGarage,fdg1by7,t1_fdflqb6,1578376416.0,Gotta figure out a way to involve Tommy in something that has absolutely nothing to do with him lol
aww,fczttqd,t3_ejlerp,1578108503.0,"Puppies sure are fun, huh? Lol"
aww,fct3p8f,t3_eill3r,1577932067.0,"I'm sorry, but at this point whenever I look at a puppy I'm reminded by how often I have to get up in the middle of the night, the last time it went outside, where it's at and what its chewing on, and scanning the house to see if it went potty in the 2 minutes I took my eyes off it."
funny,fclvl3i,t3_ehtvb6,1577757533.0,"Hey, this looks like El Paso!"
nottheonion,fbza3gm,t3_ef3sfg,1577239873.0,Imagine posting an article that defended George Soros in any capacity. That is fucking crazy to me.
GreenBayPackers,fbxts8i,t1_fbwwrjk,1577200306.0,"I messaged my Viking fan friend before the game and told him not to blame the refs if we win. His response ""The refs wont be on your side this time!"". Heheheheheheheheh...."
minnesotavikings,fbwwgn2,t1_fbwsq2a,1577161296.0,Go Pack Go. This loss is mostly enjoyable after seeing how salty you all have been in your sub this past week.
HaggardGarage,fbt5loy,t3_ee0jw6,1577068912.0,I came to the comments to see what I was looking at... other than kiwi.
