I think the gist of the matter is that you want your vestibulat system to be ready to recover. Benzodiazepines mask the symptoms, but also keep you from improving. it goes without saying that you shouldn't take my word for it and do your own research if you are concerned."
StopSpinning,ff8vmbi,t1_ff8tqef,1579697601.0,"Thanks. I would steer clear from benzodiazepines since they are vestibular suppressants. The same applies to alcohol, which I understand is part of your life.

Whether someone agrees with him or not, Singer is one of the few contemporary philosophers who 1)has really made a difference in the world 2) who is willing to be proven wrong. And I'm no utilitarian myself.

&#x200B;

>Badrillaurd suggests the real has been dead for a long time and it seems confirmed by the fact there is no longer a difference between charity which takes passion time and effort and that which does not.

It still takes passion and effort. Unless you've inherited that money, it's probably the product of your hard work. It takes a certain kind of man to go to work every day in order to give money to the poor. Singer only pointed out that a lot of charity work is virtue signaling and that if we really care about poor people there are more efficient ways to help them.

&#x200B;

>I don’t know what to do with the information that we could so easily solve all of life’s problems and simultaneously collapse capitalism that you can right now save lives while lying down

I'm not sure I understand this sentence, but 1) one can fight against capitalism while still living within its its boundaries. Giving your money to charities doesn't help capitalism anymore (and, actually, probably less) than buying your groceries. 2) if the utopia of another mythical economic system stops you from being a good person in the present, maybe you should reconsider your goals 3) anyone has yet to prove that dismantling capitalism is net good. Until then, give your money to charity."

AskReddit,fetutc4,t1_fetgpl1,1579380242.0,"And no increased anxiety on trintellix during the first weeks? Thanks for your help, man. Take care."
AskReddit,fete5zz,t1_fet6cnc,1579374467.0,"I see. Do you think it doesn't work for your anxiety, or that it's just less effective? I understand you don't have panic attacks anymore? So no sides on Trintillex? That would be great news if it worked better. I think I'll give trintillex a shot and if it doesn't work maybe I could come back to lexapro or maybe effexor. By the way, didn't you experience increased anxiety/insomnia when you started lexapro? Sorry for all these questions, but Trintillex is a new med so I'm very curious. Also, I work with people and I'm a bit afraid of making the switch since I don't know if it would increase my anxiety or something like that. Thanks again."
AskReddit,fesy5l8,t1_ferm9zb,1579370103.0,"Thanks for the thorough reply. I'm sorry that Trintellix is not working for your anxiety. Maybe you need more time or you need to up your dosage. They say it's milder than lexapro. I still don't know if I want to change med, but I know that 5ml is not doing much anymore.

A couple of questions if I may:

&#x200B;

\- How come did your doctor prescribe Trintellix? Were sexual sides discussed?

\- Did you consider other meds?

\- Have you experienced any sides during your first weeks on Trintellix? More anxiety? Nausea?

&#x200B;

I want to get rid of my anxiety, but sex is an important part of my life and I'd like to try something that works for both. Lexapro is fine so far, but I need to increase my dose and I'm not sure if I want to do that. I respect you for living with those issues without being bothered by them."
slatestarcodex,fenm4ih,t1_fen03j0,1579287626.0,"Thanks, I appreciate it.

Let me comment on the fact that only on SSC would someone suggest LSD as a possible cure for anxiety haha. But that's why I like this community."
Effexor,fenkp8f,t1_fen05zq,1579286753.0,"Ah, I see. Can you describe to me how you did the switch from one med to the other? Did you take them both for a period of time? Any effect on your anxiety?"

slatestarcodex,femvc38,t1_femu0n6,1579270583.0,"so you're still taking it? How long did you live with the dizziness prior to the med? Escitalpram helped me for some days, but it's too low a dosage right now. I still don't know what med I should take, but it's clear to me that meds (and therapy) are the solution"
Effexor,fempbkm,t1_fel9f0e,1579265548.0,so it gives you basically the same sides?
slatestarcodex,femjv4b,t1_felwna9,1579259275.0,"Tell me more, please. Was your dizziness constant? How did it start? was effexor the only thing you tried to address the problem? How long did it take in order to work? Any sides? Thanks."
AskPsychiatry,fekwejy,t1_fekulpj,1579208989.0,"I know that it's new, but since I seem to do well on ssris maybe it's worth trying. I doubt that effexor will have fewer sides being a stronger medication. I could try remeron or wellbutrin, but the first is not recommended for people with anxiety and the second is too sedative (according to my doc). Since trintellix is very simlar to an ssri and seems to be pretty mild maybe it's my best bet. I think that if I've had sides on escitalopram it'd probably be the same on prozac. Frankly I don't know. They all can potentially give sexual sides. Wellbutrin, bupropion, trintellix and remeron appear to be the only exceptions."
AskPsychiatry,feku4ep,t1_feks3ja,1579207642.0,"Thanks. My target dose is 10mg actually. Is there a chance for sides NOT to increase when you increase your dosage? My doc didn't think that prozac was a good idea since I'm taking escitalopram because of my anxiety. Anecdotally, people do seem to have fewer sides on trintellix."

I thought you were skeptical of its claims, judging from your posts. Since I mainly take it for anxiety, do you think it's a viable option? Wellbutrin seems to worsen anxiety. We don't have Bupropion here. I've heard Remeron is too sedative. What would you prescribe to someone who wants to minimize sexual sides ansd who seems to do well withSSRIs? Thanks a lot."

The original title of the book was supposed to be ""The Gral"", which IMO is a nod towards Eliot's the waste land. In both book, as in Yeats's the second coming, a new future appears. Both McCarthy and Eliot seems to be hopeful that a new humanity, or a new culture, is possible. This is likely to be a culture where people and god are close together once again. McCarthy is a pessimist and a gnostic though. If there is hope it's inside the kid and the family that adopts him.
