Showerthoughts,feoujac,t1_feotlnt,1579305740.0,"The idea of community policing started in Alberta Canada in the 70s or 80s iirc.  There is a city near I live where they have implemented it pretty well and among the citizens of the city, they have something like a 90+% approval rating.  However it should also be stated that the city has a large caucasian and middle income population which tends to have a high approval of police in the first place so there is that to consider.


One of the major things stopping community policing from becoming mainstream is many police forces only adopt some of the ideas of community policing so it is not nearly as effective as well as the lack of support behind it from officers.  Many people who join the police tend to be young and hot blooded so the idea of doing something so opposite of what many people believe police do makes community policing less desirable.  Not to mention a decent section of police officers are older and may not want to change.  There are a few other things that officers don't want to do that aids in community policing such as doing more foot patrol(as they are more approachable by citizens) or being by themselves during patrol for the same reason."
Showerthoughts,fenbj6i,t1_fenaiuh,1579281152.0,"I'm talking from a Canadian perspective so I'm not entirely sure about the size of each US city but in Canada most cities are not more than 1mil.  But you are right about size, it would be hard to build a community with a large population.


 Now bear with me since I don't have all my sources in front of me but in one city where community policing has been very successful and implemented it very well.  They have set up zones set up where officers are assigned where they have a kind of ownership.  This ownership helps officers feel more connected and accountable to their zone because they are not able to pass blame and can mostly only rely on themselves.  The separation of zones is kinda like if an area like Chinatown had their own police.  Each zone has their own community and things that make them different from other zones.  Since each officer is responsible for their zone, they get more used to and learn about their zone where it becomes like a second home.  Think of it this way, you would care more if your room or house was messy than you would about your work's break room.  At home only you can clean it up but at work other co-workers or staff could clean it up to so you may not bother to clean up the break room.


This is theoretical but it has worked before, but I am not sure how applicable it would be in the US due to the difference in laws and culture."

Showerthoughts,fena33w,t1_fen6fy2,1579280253.0,Maybe traditional policing but in Canada we are trying to be proactive by introducing something called community policing.  Traditional policing is what you mainly see in the US and in movies where they are chasing bad guys and stuff; that is reactive policing.  Community is proactive where they try to interact with the community and build a relationship so that they are trusted and something the community can rely on.  One strategy of community policing is to go to schools and talk with students to try and help them before they start to commit crimes

manga,fea8iba,t1_fea7juo,1578945615.0," As far as I can tell, or at least it was a few years ago, translators would get money from patreon in exchange for getting a couple chapters ahead.  right now in the chinese novel circles at least, there is a chinese comapny shutting down fan translations for licensing.  I dont know how much manga scan groups make but one of the top translators was making something like 6 figures on patreon.  Dont quote me on that, i feel like i read it in passing so there isnt really much evidence.  However with novel translations you typically only have one person, maybe two for editing grammer and stuff, but with manga scan groups there is a whole team, so any money is divided."

pokemon,fdr74eh,t3_emnjm5,1578680400.0,"I think the reason why pokemon is able to get away with being behind is that they are marketed to a younger/more casual audience.

His only response was something along the lines of ""it's graphics are better than the 3ds so it's fine"".  


Nintendo has always done their own thing, they never seem to be too involved with things like E3 and they have their own announcements via Nintendo direct.  And because pokemon is one of the most profitable franchises in the world they don't need to follow the industry standard because they know they will have fans who will only buy their stuff and have nothing to compare it too."
