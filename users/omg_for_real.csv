But I have 2 kids and a cat and was looking in a more desirable area. And needed to be close to transport and schools.

What is of more concern is the fact that children were out. They could see, and that is not appropriate. But it may have been more sinister. 

It is worth a mention to the police. It may come to nothing. But normal people understand that having a wank in full view of children is inappropriate, even with kink in play."

Also the connection between Joon Gyeom and Shi Wol, and who covered what up. I have a feeling the judge will be in in it and ‘father’ we keep hearing about will make an appearance in this mess at some stage.

Oh, and I remember that it was mentioned that Joon Hwi was the major share holder T some stage. Which is why the evil ceo lady
Is so concerned about him working at the company and thinks he is trying to take it over. And I’m not sure he know it. SonI t honk that will come into play at some stage. Maybe he will use that to protect people or use its power or we will see full on power tripping Joon Hwi.

Adelaide,fepkvpv,t3_epvy1t,1579323165.0,"I have a big age gap between my two, 13 and 7, and we do the following pretty often. 

There is the botanic gardens, the central, and the ones down south, plus the ones up at mount lofty. You can combine the ones at mount lofty with a visit to Hahndorf. 

There is the Hahndorf farm barn and beerenberg may still be picking berries at this time both at Hahndorf. 

Along the coast is a bike path that is good to ride or walk along, and you can do the same along the Torrens. There are playgrounds along both too.

Henley beach is a fun place to go, even without swimming. There are the seats every kid plays in, the grass for a picnic to play on, ice cream, birds to chase, and some weekends there is live music or markets etc.  it’s a nice atmosphere to just hang around. There is a bit of a water fountain or bubbler to splash in in the main square too. Kids love it. 

Semaphore has a bit of a carnival at the moment, a few show rides, live music on weekends, food, and there are places to eat up jetty road. Plus there is the beach and jetty to walk on and play on. 

The public library has exhibitions. The last one I saw was the Phill Cummings one, it was interactive and it was lots of fun. There was a light box full of sand the kids could draw in and clay that were the kids faves.  Not sure what they have on at the moment, but you can check their website.

The museum and art gallery would be worth a visit, even for just 1/2 and hour. They are free. So you can go and look and something different every time. 

Along north terrace is some art and a fountain for playing in. Some of the art has buttons that will give sound bites, I can’t remember if they are out front of the museum, library or art gallery though. The statues are traditional and will be fun for the kids to find and touch. The fountain is fun to splash in. 

Port Adelaide has the street art, they have a map, you can walk to most of it, some will be a drive by.  The harts mill palyground is a good stop there while you are out there. There is a map of all the street art with the artists info available.

The central markets is good to visit. They sometimes do their market trial, check eventbrite for tickets, and do other events, cooing displays and classes etc. it’s worth a wander anyway. 

Ona warm night the kids are all in the fountain at Victoria Square.  It’s great, all the kids play together and I’ve never seen arguments or anything. It’s a nice place for a bit of a game of chases, or catch, a bit of a snack, and a play I the fountain. When there aren’t any events in the square.

Make a trip out to Pasadena foodland to have a look. It’s a bit of an experience. The guy at the salumi bar is super nice and love to see kids enjoy good food. We stop to pick up some bits and pieces for a picnic. It’s fun for the kids to go to, a piano in a shop? A cafe in a shop? They love it. Or maybe my kids are just easily amused.

Hope there is something on here you haven’t done."

If you started at a higher weight then you can loose a lot before people notice, especially if you ‘high restrict’, which is restrict to a higher amount of calories, so 800-1200 whatever is your target.

C: you can always improve. Study, find a mentor, work tour way slowly out the chain, get more experience, whatever.

The big battery is out that way too. If you just want to make a day trip you can drive to the pink lake and then over to the whispering wall, which is a dam that has a cool parabola effect. You talk into the wall in one end and people hear you in the other. It is pretty and fun. The drive is pretty, and there are places you can stop and explore. 

Gawler is up north too, and so is Tanunda and Nuriootpa, and the Barossa.

In the hills you have Handorf and some of the smaller towns along the freeway that are great to visit. As well as Mt lofty and even eagle on the hill. There is Mt Lofty botanic gardens too."

He was not to bad for dad to say stuff, but we could still see that he didn’t get what normal Aussies went through. I mean, this is the guy who had to hire an empathy consultant to help him do his job. If that doesn’t say I’m out of touch, I’m not sure what does."

Adelaide,fd7r2zm,t1_fd7ozcb,1578208770.0,"Are you for real?! 

Read your comment back and see how arrogant and sexist it is. 

You don’t like what I have to say, or that I wont agree with you, so you decide I’m emotional. Since any logical person would clearly agree with you. Right?  

Fuck, next time just ask If I’m on my period. Same diff man."
Adelaide,fd7nyz2,t1_fd7noo2,1578207403.0,"Can you tell me why we must change the way we do things now? 

Why do you absolutely need to park a vehicle on a space designated for pedestrians instead of a space designated for vehicles?

I have not seen a compelling argument yet."

In never said not parking near disabled spots should not happen, just That doing it by itself is not helpful, as it would not help overall. They would only have access to their vehicle, but access to the footpath would be hindered. Or actually using the footpath .

Also people with mobility issues don’t just use wheelchairs. Walking aids, scooters and assistance dogs are all walking aids. So too are canes, for people who can’t see and struggle to walk. 

I’m not sure you have a very good grasp of the issues around parking in the footpath beyond I want to donut to make my life easier. Just part somewhere else and walk like those who drive a car."
