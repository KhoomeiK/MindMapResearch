lupus,ff9kyem,t3_esefb5,1579715191.0," I take a beta blocker daily to prevent migraines. I also take riboflavin in the morning and magnesium at night. I’ve really noticed a difference in my migraines. These were all recommended/prescribed by my neurologist.
Check with your doc. It’s really helped me keep my migraines down a lot. Hope you get some relief soon."
lupus,ff3ze0o,t3_erfibo,1579552183.0,Ew. That’s not ok.  I’m so sorry that happened to you. Similar happened to me at urgent care where my doc told me to go. I however have a big mouth so when the medical assistant started being rude I talked back to her. Did you get any help in the end?
makeuporganization,ff25a6k,t3_er6f7p,1579494195.0,Love it!
Fibromyalgia,ff253rr,t3_er62l1,1579494054.0,Ah that’s great! It’s not legal where I am and I have a clearance so it’s outta the question for me however I wish it wasn’t. I’m so glad you got some relief!
makeuporganization,ff0tbkp,t1_ff0dkc8,1579472060.0,"I love their bubble wrap, lip gloss and the vinylic lip. I want to try more stuff including the perfume. I went to the nyc store which was pretty nice. I’m not trying to buy more either lol."
makeuporganization,fezk9u2,t3_eqy3fs,1579458236.0,I see a glossier bag 🙌🏾
fibro,fewi6nr,t3_eqmtgo,1579411027.0,"Keto diet definitely keeps my inflammation down and helps my flares. I do cupping therapy and workout and those definitely help me mentally, physically and emotionally."
RedditLaqueristas,fewi2pj,t3_eqn4ml,1579410963.0,I would just go naked.
RedditLaqueristas,fewhtlj,t3_eqf4v5,1579410835.0,Love.
lupus,fewhrgh,t3_eqpehk,1579410806.0,My labs are always border line but I have so many symptoms so we just go with that. It’s frustrating but my blood tests just don’t show what we would like in order to get a legit diagnosis but we go ahead and treat what needs to be treated and go from there. That’s all you can really do.

zerocarb,fev1gjs,t1_eyfp0xj,1579392059.0,I have a fibromyalgia and got really sick with it last year and can’t seem to get 100% better and get all the weight off I gained during that time.
Fibromyalgia,fev1cm3,t1_fejxqqg,1579392018.0,It is hard to be consistent. I try hard too then bam I just can’t.
depression,fev1arx,t1_fejyniq,1579391998.0,Yea it is easier to stay at home but maybe even just getting some fresh air whether alone or with someone will help but I get it.
depression,fev16c7,t1_feshyxh,1579391949.0,"Yea, not just sleepiness. Like there’s sleepiness then there’s exhaustion. I think being mentally ill at any level just puts your body in a different way of exhaustion than anything else. Depression just messes with everything :(."
makeuporganization,fev0r3s,t1_fetmzgf,1579391853.0,Ah man :(.
makeuporganization,fev0ple,t1_fery2oy,1579391846.0,"I might god look, thanks. Oh cool didn’t know IKEA had smaller ones, thank you."

makeuporganization,ferc3tx,t1_feozq7z,1579352260.0,My daughter had me order the small drawer set from michaels and then they cancelled my order :(. Guess they aren’t available anymore. Your set up is amazing. I’m glad she can’t see this because I would go broke lol.
depression,ferbl5x,t3_eqcju4,1579352075.0,Yep. I was just crying and saying last night that no one understands me and no one every will :(.
BeautyBoxes,ferbb7k,t3_eqb6rd,1579351970.0,I bought the blue box one from Sephora. A couple of them and was disappointed and returned :(.
depression,ferb6of,t3_eqc90a,1579351918.0,"I say that every day: I’m tired of being tired, and then people tell me to rest. Ugh...I guess they mean well. I’m sorry your feeling the same."
depression,ferb1ko,t3_eqf3of,1579351854.0,I totally understand. Basically felt so alone last night because of this and felt like no one understood me. I’m so sorry your dealing with this also. My therapist always tells me that people are afraid of what they can’t see (depression).
zumba,fep7r70,t3_epty60,1579314030.0,"Yes being a ZIN member is expensive so you would have to think about that. I’ve been a member for over 10 years and teach with friends so have never had my own class, however if you cancel your membership you loose your status and would have to get re certified so definitely something to think about. If you plan to do fundraisers once a month you can pay for your membership that way. Otherwise maybe a fellow instructor would be able to fundraise for you every now and again."
running,fenxr3d,t3_eq4g9d,1579292399.0,Commando!
running,fengswn,t3_epyy9n,1579284369.0,I normally buy an older model which is normally just a different color. I wear my normally for a year. I used one pair and did 2 marathons with no problems but every person is different. Look for sales online.
keto,fengg6j,t3_eq0ik4,1579284152.0,I don’t look at the scale anymore. It’s BS. I go by my clothes and how I feel. Great job!

lupus,feks3gv,t3_epnliy,1579206448.0,Keto seems to keep my inflammation down and so does regular exercise.
depression,fejr6bv,t3_epemgf,1579183796.0,That is so awesome! Baby steps & your taking adult steps! Good for you! I’m taking tiny baby steps. Washed my bedding finally and started organizing a bit in my room. Slowly but surely.
Fibromyalgia,fejr2z1,t3_epg5ch,1579183726.0,Totally get it! I don’t ever want it to be bedtime because I know I’ll toss and turn even though I’m so exhausted. I’m actually on leave from work for the second time in about a year and a half. I just get soooo exhausted I can’t go on anymore and need a break. My doc always says to have a routine at bed. Have you tried that?
depression,fej00ya,t3_ep842q,1579152121.0,"I’m so sorry. It’s so hard to feel that way, I totally get it. Are their any groups or clubs or sports you can get involved in near you. Maybe you’ll find your important person and they’ll find you!"
lupus,feizphg,t3_ep92dw,1579151839.0,Honestly if I were you I would get another opinion. You don’t seem to be doing well with this doc and the medicine combos he’s giving you. Research specialist in your area and see if you can get in with one and explain your frustration. It can’t hurt to try! I hope you get some relief soon!

zumba,fegiigx,t3_eozz1c,1579093828.0,"If you can do the class you can do the training class! It’s just like a class but with more talking and explaining! It’s fun! Go for it! As instructors we sometimes get discount codes, check with your instructor to see if she has any and go get you certified 💪🏽🙌🏾👊🏽"
Fibromyalgia,feftfs3,t3_eoq5la,1579064667.0,Probiotics have helped me and also I did whole 30 to see what I’m sensitive to and so lots of the foods I cut out that I didn’t realized had bothered me have helped a lot.
lupus,feftc2p,t3_eovewj,1579064577.0,It’s normal to feel all of your feelings when just being diagnosed with a chronic illness. Totally relatable and understandable. Hang in there! It will get better!

zerocarb,eyex7zh,t3_cwssek,1567040299.0,People who don’t approve of the keto diet always make up some stupid crap about it 🙄.I was at my best body weight and had the most muscle when I was on keto.
