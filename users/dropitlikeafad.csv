INTP,ff39eh0,t1_ff36pwp,1579536781.0,"It's tough without a mentor. Basically any situation that you want to get into or try but tell yourself ""no i really shouldnt"" or are afraid of so you rationalize reasons not to do it , go for it. But you dont HAVE to do that. The safe path is still a path at the end of the day. Its not fun to live in discomfort and confusion. Plus, taking risks can fuck you up in other ways. Especially with INTPs. There was one time where opening up to my emotions in a really vulnerable and stressful situation almost made my body crash and faint. My body shut down and I felt naked. Its hard to explain it when its not in person and you dont have a reference experience, but that's the best short way of explaining it. And also, youre caring too much what people think. The people giving you advice, you dont even have the reference experiences to call them out on their BS. Someone can be admirable in certain aspects of their worldview and ignorant in others. Life is a mindfuck. All I can say is, if you're not about that ""wtf is reality"" lifestyle, then yea just exist. Youll settle into a path, which wont be your best potential, but its safe and its still a path. Half-dipping because you think you can cheat reality or live in a safe world while growing mentally noticeably in comparison to others will just stress you out needlessly because youre not commiting to a path and way of life."

INTP,fee1dya,t1_fedyfiu,1579024368.0,"I read through this but there's so much to unpack, and I'm not in the mood to bother, so honestly do you. If it gives you gratification then go for it, but you're doing yourself a disservice not to unpack your emotions and figure out why you're actually doing it, since you have nothing to stand to gain of substance from doing this.

The issue with trolling online is that it's not a challenge, but it gives the person trolling the illusion of being a master manipulator. Poe's law. Online you can't read body language or get a vibe from someone. Real life is different, even sociopaths can be unmasked. There are people who are REALLY deluded and would make a post like yours, which is sad, but you mimicking that isn't particularly being creative. You're not acting, you're just writing text. Someone who interprets situations positively will take the post on good faith. Someone who's overly paranoid and cynical will interpret it as a troll post. This even happens on real posts, by the way. Text is just ambiguous like that. You therefore have nothing to stand to gain perspective-wise, doing it online at least.

I ended up skimming again through your post. Small talk is like heating up a bath before jumping in. No one particularly loves it, it's a human way of signalling ""hey, we're both human, we relate"" and slowly getting comfortable with opening up.

 Also,  why do you assume that I want to conform to society, that I consider myself better than you, or that I want to be liked by everyone? Seems like a bit of projection is going on here if I'm being honest."
leangains,fee01if,t1_fedzi1u,1579023498.0,"So you keep a 250 cal surplus? Just logically I can't see how it would be feasible. Imagine your maintenance is around 2600 calories. I don't stay in my room all day. Some days I walk for hours. Others I don't. That doesn't factor into a TDEE calculator. So maintenance would be plus/minus 100 cals.

asktrp,fed2cf8,t3_eoefpa,1578995238.0,"My qualifications: I went from 260 pounds and unproportionate to 163 pounds and ripped and proportionate in one year, while only hitting the gym 2-3 times a week, and eating mostly whatever I wanted at a deficit.

Getting shredded fast will likely increase your chances of loose skin and will likely lead to a yoyo or relapse.

If you still want to go through with it, let me just tell you that maintaining a routine and doing SOMETHING will automatically lead to results over time. You just need to keep doing it. There's no ""best routine"". Also, the scale isn't linear, but over time it will budge. All you need to do is keep doing something. 

The goal of a cut is to maintain muscle while losing the fat covering it. How do you do that? Increase your calorie deficit to whatever is maintainable (1500 a day at the lowest) and hit the gym 3 times a week doing full body work. 1-2h per session is all you need to hit everything pretty thoroughly. The more sessions, the more fat you burn, and the faster the result. For the most bang for your buck, 5 sessions a week would probably be the best. 3 works really well though to get a routine going.

1 pound lost is about 3500 calories. Assuming your maintenance calories for your weight is 2500 calories, AND you hit the gym, then spread out over the week, you'd probably be burning an average of 2700 calories per day. If you eat 1500 cals a day, you're losing 1200 cals per day. That's about 2 pounds lost per week. If you're hitting the gym, then most of that is fat because you're maintaining muscle. If you're getting newbie gains from the gym, you may even be losing fat AND gaining muscle, which is a win-win.

Based off of the most thorough research out there, you only need 0.6-0.8g protein per pound of your total weight to maintain and/or gain muscle. I'd stay on the higher end of that just to be safe. You can do 1g of protein per pound if you want, but no significant research supports that statistic. You do lose more calories when consuming a higher proportion of protein because it needs to be processed, so there's that.

If your intention is for aesthetic purposes, I'll give you aesthetic-based advice. Make sure to hit traps, and shoulders. For the rest, most compound upper body exercises will work (bench, pull-ups, dips, chin-ups, bicep curls, rows etc.). 5-15 rep range, with  4 sets usually works. Don't overthink it. If you do less reps, just do a bonus set, if you have that push left. Even then, going to the gym frequently with a decent volume is already good enough. Increase the weight over time, and you're good. On a cut, aim to maintain the weights you use at the least. DON'T SKIP LEGS. If you hate squats, go for leg press and lunges. Just don't miss them or there'll be a new chicken in town. Also, this isn't mentioned but 5 minutes of training neck per session is worth it. You can be small, but if you have a good neck, it'll make you look jacked. It's usually the only exposed body part too. Some body builders train up their bodies but the lack of developed neck makes them look like aliens. It only grows significantly from isolated exercises. Measure your neck circumfrence. Aiming for 17 inches is usually ideal and also looks good for most. DON'T GO PAST THIS. Above this circumfrence, you increase sleep apnea risk. At 17 or under, you're totally safe. Use isolated weighted neck exercises (check athleanX), and NO neck bridges. With neck bridges, there's risk of injury long-term. With the right exercises and caution, you'll be safe. For upper abs, weighted sit-ups on those ab chairs that have a part at the end for you to put your feet (for isolation and good form), and for lower abs, hands under butt, and lift your straightened out legs up and down (with a weight between your feet). For overall core, weighted planks. The point of using weight in all of these is for the ability to grow the muscle, since you need to increase load over time. For your v-line, cable pulls. 3 sets of all of these. You can do weighted hanging leg lifts too for abs, and twist your hips while doing it for your v-line (hang on like you're doing a pull-up and left up your straightened out legs, possibly with weight between your feet). Depends on your skill level, strength, and how much time you have.

If you do these, by April-May, you'd have lost around 20-30 pounds, mostly fat. You may have even gained sone muscle, despite the deficit, and your body will look better proportioned. Good luck."

He may have played things up a bit and treated parts of this as a joke, but I'm confident that this situation is at least partially true. The reason why trolls exist is because they lack the ability to naturally integrate with society (probably due to a shit ton of unexplored baggage), so they exaggerate parts of themselves and try to treat it as a joke by being extra so that they feel like they're the ones in control of their self-image and that they're being treatly badly because of being a troll rather than because they have issues or a lack of social understanding. Kind of like those ""cuck"" copypastas. They come from a place of insecurity and possible partial experience. No person with a genuinely good life would waste their time trolling.

INTP,fecuiup,t3_eofk1k,1578985150.0,"INTPs can be REALLY great mentors. They tend to learn things slowly, so they learn the entire scope of a topic and recognize patterns. They can become the bridge to teaching others in the most efficient way possible.

INTPs can be VERY independent. This makes them highly self-sufficient and capable of surviving in a world with mostly codependent people (to varying degrees). This also gives them a perspective that most others will never have full access to.

INTPs with well-rounded life experience can read situations for what they are. Due to the struggles they have with overthinking, they gain a complete understanding of the scope of their past experiences. Their weakness becomes a strength. As a result, they can find the best applicable solutions to other peoples' problems, when the help is sought for. This can be used in businesses and other relationships.

Most INTPs don't seek fame, and prefer to stay behind the scenes. This is a HUGE strength and requires a humbleness that most others don't have. This lack of need for outer validation for their actions allows them to reap the benefits and experiences from their hard work, while still being able to remain under the radar and remain free and grounded, while continuing to gain knowledge and experience.

When an INTP loves a subject or hobby, they can easily immerse themselves and reach flow state. This is THE most difficult thing to do for the majority of people. All an INTP needs to do is find something interesting. From there, they can shut off the rest of the world and create/learn."

Not to play that card, but you're still too young and if you go somewhere like the seduction or red pill subreddit, you won't have the life experience or knowledge to seperate the truth from the bullshit. At least not for now.

Google what I suggested before. Trust. I'll make things simple for you: Don't act overly nervous (ex. fidgeting, looking down, feet pointing away like youre trying to run away). Have somwhere fun planned that YOU want to go to. Don't ask for her permission to go places, just bring her. You're the prize, so don't try to qualify yourself to her or act like something you're not. Remember, she already likes you dude. So keep being you and act relaxed like you would at home with your family, but add in some teasing (not putting her down, but just be playful). Teasing is what flirting is. It's as simple as that. Think of the banter your friends have where you guys mess around with each other and laugh. Do that, but naturally. Like if she drops something, stop and check her out and say something like ""you can take your time"" in a joking way.  Expect nothing and just have fun. Once you guys are comfortable together, at the end of the date you can go for a kiss. I'd have suggested earlier but you likely have no experience so just doing that will probably take balls from you.

This will be a good life experience for you. Think of it as evolving yourself and getting out of your comfort zone. Good luck"
INTP,fecrtof,t3_eognnd,1578982201.0,"This reminds me of myself in HS. I was so clueless, shy, and naive that I didn't notice that someone liked me even if they said it to my face. And if they did, I doubted their intentions and became paranoid. Because I was so clueless, I also attracted weird stalker types because they felt power from taking advantage of my lack of social awareness and boundaries. I was a mess of unexplored emotions and so I pushed people away, called things ""weird"", and acted fake and treated people like NPCs because I knew nothing, about the world, myself, and in turn, others.

Good luck, you have a long road ahead of you. I don't have enough real life info like her tone of voice and body language to give you complete advice, but your negative interpretation of a potentially positive situation tells me most of what I need. Most likely she's a very forward girl, but your lack of self-esteem, insecurity, and paranoia is making you want to avoid the discomfort because right now you have control over the situation. You get that ego boost of knowing she's chasing you, and you get the cred for making posts like these. In reality though, once you make that jump to go on a date with her, you have no control and that scares you. It's a deep end you're afraid to explore emotionally, so you rationalize away the fear by projecting your negative paranoid views onto her. What is she going to do? Kill you in a movie theatre? Be honest with yourself.

If I could go back to where you are right now, I'd learn about: body language, boundaries, assertiveness, insecurity, IOIs, how to confront people correctly, neediness and validation, how to understand your wants/needs, and authenticity. This will expand your social toolbox like you won't believe. It's like a tonic for self-growth. With these skills, it doesn't matter what someone's intentions are. You could literally hangout with a sociopath, and if you know what you want, even if they try to manipulate you, you know what you want, so you can find a way to benefit from the situation while protecting yourself because you have boundaries.

INTP,fe0td2j,t1_fe01sjn,1578818427.0,"You wouldn't worry about a sense of self if you were the only living person on earth. You would just exist and do your own thing. People make it confusing because we ALL have a sense of self to an extent. Maybe not the best self if you don't have a purpose, since you have no sense of direction, but there's still something there. We live with others though, so the self has to be framed in the context of social interaction, since we live with others. Developing a sense of self is harder in that context because of our insecurities, overthinking, and caveman genetics from being killed if you dont get with the tribe. So to recap, you have a self, but it's just not your best self. That self is also harder to express socially when others are involved. The goal? Better your ""self"" through having direction (so you make choices that suit you better, and get you to where you want), and to exist as yourself around others without it making you self-conscious.

What's worked for me: getting consistent self-made values from experience and not giving up on them regardless of who it is, developing boundaries, finding a general purpose, not seeking validation from others, and becoming assertive. You're basically just existing as you would alone, but with self-respect and a general sense of direction in life (since when you're social, as opposed to alone, you're exposed to outer social forces which can manipulate you). Developing this is key. Those who don't evolve stay at a lower level of awareness where they become paranoid and insecure, detach, and cement themselves as socially anxious adults with broadcasted social insecurity and avoidance (unless they go through some trauma that shows them the light). They end up self-pitying and in recurring bouts of self-hate, overthinking, and depression. Like a yoyo diet. Anyways, the rest is just you having conversation with people. Since you're not seeking validation, you're therefore not acting needy or mimicking. If you reach that point where you start to cement that self, the mimicking ability that the INTP has then evolves into framing your social value as what the other person wants/needs in their life, without having to overly act fake ""nice"". The end result is even better than basic mimicking because you end up as the center of social validation for the other person, rather than being the tag-along, while still gaining the social favour you need to meet your needs. 

This comes from social experience and observation. Think of it as a high level player in a game vs. a noob. The high level player knows what he needs to level up, what the map is like, and how the game works. The noob is clueless and needs to suck up to veterans for help in the game. Some players will level up, and others will get resentful and just detach and play random mini-games alone. Same thing socially, kind of. Hope this helps"

socialskills,fdicsis,t1_fdhjotj,1578439975.0,"It's not always particular topics.

Like for example, if a friend told you ""fuck I hate this class"", then you ask why and they tell you why, so then you laugh or sigh and say ""damn, ive had profs like that before. It sucks"". Imagine them continuing on about the course. Youve already used the ""asking a question"" and ""damn that sucks"" card. So there you are, listening to them ramble and then you guys are both silent with them expecting you to respond. The only option is changing the subject but you can only do that within reasonable limits because it comes off as dismissive or rude. I dont mind silences, but a 20 second silence pretty often is like okay whats going on here."
AskOldPeople,fcjgrv3,t1_fcjecbe,1577687025.0,">  Stop asking other people what they think of your choices.

I agree with your point. However, if a choice is being made from a position of insecurity or lack of perspective, it would be a damn shame not to know that. If you never ask for perspective, you stay ignorant. It's a trade-off. Come off as insecure and learn, or don't ask and seem or feel ""confident""."
