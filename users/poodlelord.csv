audioengineering,ff7dxgq,t1_ff573vr,1579647320.0,"Fair enough on dreams, it is just my standard test for a system because its consistent and well mixed. 

I always feel like tipper tries to push the bounderies glad you found them a little interesting.

As for the phish, sorry about the cat noises haha. My understanding on them is that they have gotten very weird as the decades go on.  As for a better live recording look for 12 31 99 seems to be a bit more tame and funky.

As for studio jam band I have always thought touch of grey by the grateful dead was well done. 

Anyway, thank you for taking the time to listen and give me your thoughts! Some day I will have a system like that, just takes time."

Maybe some phish would be interesting because they take great care in their live recordings. I'd go for something from the 90s, they kind of suck now.

I'd also be interested in how something like Tipper would sound in a system like that. It is psychedelic electronic music."

yuumimains,fel717c,t1_fel529z,1579215433.0,"I don't play ranked because people get way too toxic and are meta slaves, the elo of people I play norms with is typically gold to plat. I am not a particularly good player but i play enough of yuumi to get her kit. 

I played 79 games of her before the new year and it wasn't till about 50 in i really started to win more. I think people struggle the most with choosing when and where to dismount, it is essential because it is how she gets mana, it's also what makes her survivable. 

I think her skill shot is powerful enough, and if you made it have a slow again yuumi would be too good at too many things, her ult and speed boost on zoomies gives her strong chase and run away potential as is.

The q is still important because the damage adds up and it helps you stack spell thiefs in a timely manner."
yuumimains,fel3qmf,t1_fel0djl,1579213411.0,"Stop trying to change her. 

She has a low pick and win rate because people don't understand her. Give it till the end of the season and those things will start to change. 

I think she is really strong because she can give 100 ad/ap to a champ, has really good ratios on the heal and gives a pretty ludicrous attack speed buff, especially when paired with ardent censer, also gives really good move speed buff. Her ult is actually pretty strong when you consider how easy it is to land on multiple people."
yuumimains,fekzqf4,t1_fekzdgb,1579210980.0,"The community is the problem this time.

I would really like to see no changes made vs most the ones suggested here, but hey, I actually play the champion in her current form.

Like actually the whole point is to have an expert listen to your track on a good system and make sure it is as perfect as it can be. No amount of machine learning does this. 

A good example of a good use case for this technology is izotopes ozone which will dial in a good starting point for a master, it however let's you adjust parameters afterwords.
