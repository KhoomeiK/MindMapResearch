ImaginaryStarships,ff757eq,t1_ff753ai,1579641355.0,I thought it was also to do with heating or weight or something but could be wrong.
ImaginaryStarships,ff6e2sv,t1_ff6dqjh,1579625186.0,But it's rather minor compared to this. And the far older Y wing had little changed when it would have been logical for it to have had some armour added to the back (and whatever problem that caused the removal of that armour to be fixed).
comedyhomicide,ff6dnf0,t1_ff6dd17,1579624921.0,And when it did it decided to simplify it hence why American English is simplified English and not proper English.
comedyhomicide,ff6bref,t1_ff6bmil,1579623728.0,No it is English spoken in England. Hence why it is called English and not American.
comedyhomicide,ff6ak58,t1_ff69j97,1579622961.0,I'm talking about proper English not simplified English.

ImaginaryStarships,ff5w96h,t3_eroo52,1579612366.0,They should have used design upgrades like this for the sequel era as it makes logical sense that the design would evolve a bit.

blursedimages,ff2pksq,t1_ff2j3cq,1579518058.0,Super market sandwiches are great and M&S is not just some Super market it is the high end supermarket with the high quality expensive food. It also does nice clothes.
blursedimages,ff2phwp,t1_ff284dc,1579517933.0,What uncivilised land are you from that you don't get the glory of super market premade sandwiches?
TheExpanse,fetnkz7,t3_eqhp48,1579377256.0,I don't have a problem with sci-fi that is not trying to be realistic such as star wars as long as that kind of sci-fi doesn't break it's own rules. However it had made me get annoyed at sci-fi that tries to be realistic but gets bits wrong like the fact that in Ad Astra the space ships were constantly burning towards their destination without any effect inside the ships and them they just stopped when they arrived or were able to just pull over to answer a distress call.
ShittyMapPorn,fesiqvg,t3_eqhq8j,1579365653.0,There is nothing shitty about this. It looks perfectly accurate and informative to me. It clearly shows no countries have a population greater then China and the map looks correct.
netflixwitcher,fesicnk,t1_fesg6cs,1579365468.0,It depends on if they do one book a season. I think it would work best to have the ending of season 2 be the coup as blood of the elves doesn't have any big cinematic ending that we are used to with tv shows.
netflixwitcher,fes2bv5,t1_fes1d7o,1579360664.0,An episode maybe while being mixed with other stuff?

AskReddit,fer29kx,t3_eqfh41,1579348797.0,Because Google maps isn't connecting.
AskReddit,fer26vk,t3_eqfh6i,1579348765.0,"My first shit of the day is the post breakfast shit. I will sit there for about 10 minutes relaxing on my phone on reddit or something. I sometimes bring my cup of tea in with me.

My second shit is normally after dinner (this habit was originally made to get out of tidying dinner but I live alone now and still do it). I spend another 10 minutes or so enjoying myself.

My third shit is just before bed which is another 10 minutes of enjoyment.

I may take other shits during the day if I need to go or am bored."
AskReddit,fer1j98,t1_fer0ip7,1579348566.0,Could be worse. I also pre-ordered and played no man's sky. I don't pre order anymore
AskReddit,fer18zo,t3_eqfhmp,1579348496.0,Rules are not made to be broken. The intention of all rules is for them to be followed otherwise the rule would not have been made in the first place. Saying rules are made to be broken is just an excuse to break rules even though the statement makes no sense.

netflixwitcher,feqwgho,t1_feqveht,1579346890.0,I hope they get to some time of contempt stuff as blood of the elves is too slow passed and has too much set up and not much pay off to spend an entire season on.
netflixwitcher,feqjt4r,t1_feq7ckw,1579342657.0,I doubt he will be in it until season 3 at the earliest depending on how many books they do each season.

gallifrey,fe54vz3,t1_fe54p5x,1578865692.0,But if it's not made explicit enough it can seem like it's a big continuity error
gallifrey,fe53s27,t1_fe4rtf8,1578865420.0,Could it fit into the ark in space thing and the star ship UK as those were either two different mass exodus's from earth or both part of the same one
gallifrey,fe4nwvm,t3_ensr61,1578861216.0,The actual episode and most of the writing was extremely good and it was really enjoyable right until the earth reveal. It was a clear attempt at a political message which isn't in itself bad however the twist goes against pre established cannon were future earth becomes fairly prosperous and humans colonise the universe. The smallest implication of this twist is that time is in flux a lot more then previously established but the largest is that they have decided to completly remove all the future human stuff from cannon.

AskReddit,fdnjwvl,t3_embyh2,1578587355.0,Countries having different rules for a zebra crossing. In the UK it is your right of way so cars will always slow down for you if you crossing. However in other countries such as France they are completly ignored and are no different to any other part of the road meaning you can almost get hit by a crazy French motorist which is rather annoying.

InsanePeopleQuora,fcjvb2g,t1_fcjv7r9,1577706489.0,I am not pissed at all. I just find it rather funny that you are getting pissed off at a simple slightly anti America joke and then say you are not a textbook American when all I have seen from you says that you are.
InsanePeopleQuora,fcjv5c6,t1_fcjv142,1577706272.0,I am not offended at all just amused at how offended you are. Do you want me to say that America is the greatest country on earth as it clearly isn't. Neither is Britain anymore.
