It‚Äôs likely that she will continue to get more hook ups and you will continue to struggle getting dates.

Giving the cold shoulder is also unhealthy. It seems like you both need to grow and learn how to communicate and be healthy partners

Do you really want a man that can‚Äôt even text you? I was in a relationship just like that and decided that‚Äôs not what I want so decide if you want that or not because there‚Äôs a possibility he may not want to change."

Talking to you, I know why you‚Äôre with a 14 year old. Because you‚Äôre on the same level of maturity. You refuse to acknowledge that your girlfriend is A CHILD THAT YOURE ATTRACTED TO.

So I‚Äôm not too sure about your statements saying they‚Äôre subconsciously doing it to their partners. There‚Äôs also different porn available. There‚Äôs soft porn that‚Äôs slow and passionate as well. Porn is just a film. People just have to have a balance.
offmychest,feh9cht,t3_ep4sa6,1579111846.0,"Reading your post history, you need to get a new therapist and a new team.

Anxiety,feh7h2r,t1_feh6wwk,1579110739.0,Yeah I‚Äôm a therapist for people with autism/aspergers. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd pick it if she wasn‚Äôt able to do so.

You can also work on desensitization. It can take a long time but it can work, I do it with my clients. You just start very slowly exposing yourself to it and continue. (Example for you: allow water to run on you for 10 seconds and go from there)."

relationship_advice,fe2lt20,t1_fe2gmoe,1578840167.0,"I respect your opinion. But that has not been the outcome for myself. I had never been able to explore my bisexuality in fear of being shamed. My family does not believe in being bisexual. When I disclosed those feelings to my boyfriend he was supportive and nonjudgmental about it. He told me I can explore it if I want. I wanted him to somehow be apart of it because he‚Äôs my partner.

To us it wasn‚Äôt stepping outside of the relationship. I understand that in your relationship it would be considered stepping out and that‚Äôs fine too. We all shape our relationships to how we see fit."
relationship_advice,fe2lgk1,t1_fe2em30,1578839950.0,"Have you thought of therapy? I did not start therapy until last year at 23 and I wish my parents would‚Äôve put me in it as a child. For some talking about it to someone they can be vulnerable with is very beneficial. I‚Äôm not saying he cannot be vulnerable with you or your wife, but sometimes a different person can bring about different responses. 

My ‚Äúthing‚Äù as a kid was watching WWE. I found an escape in the drama and action on the show. Maybe your son has a thing that isn‚Äôt a sport or doesn‚Äôt so heavily rely on large social interaction. My ‚Äúthing‚Äù was also reading and writing. My dad tried to get me into running, didn‚Äôt work. But writing? Oh boy I could write non stop! Or read non stop! So maybe his ‚Äúthings‚Äù aren‚Äôt yours, and that‚Äôs totally okay! Meet him where he is right now. Remember he‚Äôs a kid and the world is scary, with anxiety it‚Äôs even scarier. See if you can figure out if he already has a thing you haven‚Äôt noticed. Talk to him about it and engage with him. Then maybe introduce newer things."
relationship_advice,fe28cpc,t1_fe1zo57,1578835527.0,"That‚Äôs not true. Im like OP‚Äôs girlfriend. My boyfriend was all for me exploring with another woman. Was I promiscuous? No, my boyfriend was aware and in agreement, also it was one woman ( bf even hopped on FaceTime to watch). Do I still respect myself? Yes. Maybe it‚Äôs not what you‚Äôd do in your relationship, but don‚Äôt put a girl down because she‚Äôs trying to explore herself."
relationship_advice,fe2713t,t3_enn1st,1578835129.0,"Kinda sounds like myself as a child but I had depression and anxiety which caused me to doubt myself nonstop and withdrawal socially. Maybe work on those inner things first before exposing him to these things that bother him/that he doesn‚Äôt like. Not saying he‚Äôs got depression or anxiety, but maybe a lack of confidence? I believe that needs to be brought up in order for him to feel like he can try and is capable."
relationship_advice,fdv9tqk,t3_en6oly,1578745099.0,"I think it‚Äôs normal to use your partners stuff. But if it bothers you maybe have him get back up travel size bottles of his stuff for when he does run out.

relationship_advice,fdv9bsi,t3_en6phz,1578744843.0,There‚Äôs probably nothing you can do. If I were your wife I‚Äôd leave as well and wouldn‚Äôt want you anywhere near the kids.
