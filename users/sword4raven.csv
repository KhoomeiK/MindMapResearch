They want them for organs. 

Their entire reasoning is based on them being apes not humans. So it's fine in their eyes apparently to breed and kill them for organs."
facepalm,feh0zie,t1_feemejg,1579106868.0,"From my perspective, you told the victim off for standing up for themselves. That's certainly not bystander behavior. 

What I'm suggesting isn't that the bully fully believes they didn't do anything wrong. But that they feel they are allowed to do wrong and claiming they weren't meanspirited because they think the other party deserved it. It is still meanspirited, what makes it meanspirited or not isn't whether you think it is meanspirited, but instead the behavior you have.

>mean-spirited mēn′spĭr′ĭ-tĭd
>adj.	Having or characterized by a malicious or petty spirit.
>adj.	Having a base, nasty, petty, or malevolent disposition.

The definition is definitely not, ""person think they're being meanspirited so they are"".

Having a base, nasty, petty, or malevolent disposition. fits you to a T"
facepalm,feecfmt,t1_fee9m01,1579030887.0,"Who knows, yours is arguably worse as you assume I think you need an intention to be mean spirited. So that when the bully beats up some guys, but he considered it to not be mean spirited it stopped being it? 

Oh please, you thinking something isn't mean spirited doesn't mean anything."
facepalm,fee55sx,t1_fedxgtf,1579026609.0,"It's ""verbal abuse"" in itself to suggest something, in a way that is mean spirited. Suggesting someone needs to seek therapy without any actual helpful intent or advice definitely qualifies, as much as anything the person you originally wrote to.

In other words, you're the same and absolutely no better. Which would be fine since it's rather the classic internet tone towards others. But you made it not fine, by suggesting it is wrong in a way where you used it yourself.

Clear enough?"

I definitely shouldn't have fired back at a barking dog I can't reach. It'll keep barking on and on forever.

The fact you don't have any insight into how history has unfolded for those who beautifully believe every word of a professional to be ironclad truth is pathetic though. If people only were half as competent as in your fantasy bubble all the world's issues would be instantly solved."

Honestly, your comment comes off as something you'd expect from an immature teen 13-15 years of age.

You're bragging about your age? You don't care when you're clearly emotional? You think your opinion matters from just claiming you have some background, which seems extremely shallow in the first place. 
You think hearing something from professionals means it must be true. Regardless of how society has always been full of flaws, there's plenty of professionals who don't know what they're talking about. 

Either you took some severe brain damage from those beatings or you're a kid, pretending to be an adult. Hoping on the later. Anyways have fun, mr bad ass."

facepalm,fe4dcy2,t1_fe4ap0o,1578858055.0,"You just seem very sure it won't work, so I was wondering if you had some personal experience that led you to believe that.

Because I can't really see why it wouldn't work, or why you'd only account for the effect on female victims and not male victims?

For example, the use of actual victim in reference to female victims makes it look like you only consider females actual victims in this case, despite plenty of males having committed suicide over false accusations. You seem to consider the effects it could have on them insignificant. 

And more importantly, the assumption that simply stating 

>Say a girl cries rape, police look into it and conclude shes lying.... and charge her, can you imagine the law suit after?

Which I simply cannot follow you on, what's so wrong about this?

Then concluding

>The whole point of my ""this makes zero sense"" is what seems like a no brainers at face value isnt always a realistic solution. And realistically in I'd bet 95% of false accusation. Theres would be no way to prove the girl is lying. I'm not saying I think there should be no punishment I'm saying realistically theres is virtually no way to successfully prosecute.

Which I really cannot agree with."

facepalm,fe3zq0a,t1_fe3qvjw,1578854407.0,"Innocent until proven guilty. I thought that was the standard. 

If you cannot prove a guy guilty of rape he shouldn't be punished for it either?

So why does it make a difference if it's a woman? If you can't prove it you can't prove it.

As for length, doesn't seem hard to figure out either. There is the idiot teen who got stressed out when confronted by her family, and the manipulative housewife who'll probably be an accomplice to murder in the future, and did so out of hate.

I don't believe in punishments for dumb teens who withdraw their claims in time after realizing the severity. of course."

It also matters a lot what the size of the army was and what tactics were used. It's one thing leading an army into battle, and another to command an army that doesn't revolve around 2 forces marching into each other.

A right to live only exists when protected, either by that being itself or others. That is just the way this sometimes cruel world works.

You deciding these sharks have an arbitrary right honestly just seems to be a dishonest way to abuse certain sentences that are hard to refuse because they sound like the ""good"" side.
