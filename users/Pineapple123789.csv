facepalm,fdhcz6b,t1_fdhboqe,1578420161.0,"Surely they are beings. Heck I love animals, all of them. 

Read some of my other comments. I explained how I dislike the current meat industry. People are definitely eating too much meat and animal based products. This has to be reduced. 

In my opinion all domesticated animals should live a life with big enclosures and with lots of time in the outdoors. They should be kept happy and healthy. 

If an animal has lived a happy life, I don’t see the problem of eating it’s meat. But in order for the animals to be having a good life our consumption habits need to change drastically."
facepalm,fdhcl80,t1_fdhbpsa,1578419965.0,"Because in western history dogs were domesticated to be pets or guards etc.

If our history took a different turn we might actually be eating dogs as well. And view it as something completely normal. But we don’t view it as normal as it isn’t a tradition here.

In fact, owning cats, dogs etc as pets hasn’t been so common for a long time. Before people also viewed dogs with more of a use in mind, also in Europe. But then times changed, people didn’t rely on dogs anymore and they became pets. Similar as horses. They had a purpose before and were used. Now they are technically pets and considered family members. They are a hobby. 

In many other cultures, such as some Asian ones, they just aren’t as wealthy and developed as we are. A sense for owning a pet and not giving that “pet” any use is absurd and weird for most. They don’t understand the bonds some people have to their pets. They just few them as tools, we did exactly the same, just a little while ago.

Did people hate animals back in the day? I don’t think so. Sure I can’t guarantee, but I’m pretty sure people liked animals back then as well and there were surely some people who had bonds to animals. It just wasn’t a cultural thing to be owning pets as most people couldn’t afford owning something that didn’t have a use."

facepalm,fdhbdg6,t1_fdha4sa,1578419341.0,"But they are animals and they aren’t being hurt if it’s done right.

Do I agree with industrializing animals? Hell no! It is not ok when animals are crapped up in narrow spaces and being slaughtered in a factory like way. That needs to stop.

Humanity needs to lower their meat consumption and consumption in general. It’s not doing us or the animals any good. All animals and all of nature’s gifts should be treated with respect and love. 

In my opinion it would be great if we just had small farms again who would keep their animals in big enclosures with lots of outdoor space. Those farms should slaughter their own animals and produce their own products. Therefore the animals would have great, long lives and we would have great products.
Prices would definitely become higher but therefore consumption would become lower. Sadly, for this to work we would all need to change our consumption habits and we would probably also need less people on this planet. 

In my opinion there is nothing morally wrong with using the meat, wool, fur, eggs or abilities of an animal for certain needs, as long as the animal is safe, happy and healthy. 

Can you agree with this or am I still a bad person that only cares for themselves and doesn’t give a fuck about the world?"
facepalm,fdh9xiv,t1_fdh9q83,1578418549.0,What justification? Finding a use in an animal is literally the reason why domestication started.

But yet, this doesn’t change the fact that they ARE domesticated animals with a use. And people still want to drink their milk, eat their cheese and have their meat. Myself included.

I feel that you are saying all farmers are bad and only exploit those animals for their meat, fur etc. well no. Most (good) farmers love and respect their animals. They know without them they wouldn’t be able to have an income and that’s why they take great care of them. Yeah, sadly they don’t have the time to play with them or teach them tricks but that’s just the way it is and I don’t see a problem. The cow is still happy never the less. And far and foremost it’s healthy."

That’s how it works. And again. The animal is an animal. It’s not gonna complain about its situation because it simply doesn’t know anything else. It’s not gonna start a petition or anything.
