SelfAwarewolves,fdsgws8,t1_fdsb1nl,1578702509.0,"Frederick Douglas was talking about blacks in the reconstruction era, not millennials trying to afford their Disney+ subscription. The fact that you can read about a time of lynching and voter disenfranchisement and being forced to make your kids work at your boss' house, and you can go ""oh that just like my shift at Starbucks!"" is galling 

I know that you're solely talking about class conflict, *that's what I've been calling out this entire time* in case that wasn't explicitly clear"
