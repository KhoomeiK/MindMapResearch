fordranger,fezub7h,t1_fezes1b,1579461748.0,"Depending on your style of tire needs, I‚Äôd go with the general grabber, nitto terra grappler, falken wild peak, or even the Tokyo open country. If I‚Äôm needing more aggressive, then a mud terrain tire would be in order. The bfg‚Äôs are always more expensive and offer the lowest mileage warranty when compared to any of these mentioned tires. A random guy has a good comment on a tire comparison video I saw a while back. ‚ÄúIf your going for looks with your truck and just want a great looking tire, go with the bfg‚Äôs.‚Äù"

Look into what it would cost to fix the transmission. It could easily cost 2-3k and would therefore make the cost of that vehicle 3-4K. To some, that might not be a bad deal. Due to age and mileage, it might have other warn out parts that you should consider. Transfer case, u-joints, brakes, wheel bearings, etc...
