I wanted: teleportation powers, to be a famous singer, to be a fashion designer, to be a famous artist, to be able to dance (ballet), magic to be real, to be Harry Potter (I am a girl), fairies to be real, ancient Greek gods to be real, pets to live forever, to be able to shrink myself to the size of my Playmobil house so I could live there, to have a unicorn or pegasus, to have siblings/a twin, to have twins, my parents to get married (they technically are just boyfriend and girlfriend, because they never married. Still together and happy though), to be a dog, to play the saxophone... and many many more cool and questionable things.

I'd say I would pick magic, the HP kind, to be real, because that would be so convenient, and I wanna go to Hogwarts."
