What was on the video (note that part of it wasn't released by Magnotta, namely the execution) was a grotesque snuff film. Can you not see a difference? Also note that Montreal is very civilized so it's possible she hadn't seen gore before."

RedditCrimeCommunity,fe8zz0e,t1_fbvcihf,1578932773.0,"I think the mom was paranoid at very least. She was mentally ill and contributed to Luka's mental illness. She was weak when she accepted his manipulative nonsense about ""Manny,"" a schizophrenic delusion which manifested Luka's violent side. Look at his background:

>his mother was obsessed with cleanliness, would routinely lock her children out of the house, and once put her children's pet rabbits out in the cold to freeze to death. His father was diagnosed with [schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia) in 1994, after which he divorced Magnotta's mother, leading Magnotta to move in with his grandmother, Phyllis. 

So yes, she's coping with his crime by accepting his schizophrenic delusion, but she also played a major role."

That's called negative self-talk. Obviously you've been listening to that too long because you're not that happy. Maybe challenge it a little more and start loving yourself.

composer,fdransg,t1_fdom4c8,1578681774.0,"Yes, but in Op.25/12, the repeated notes are passed from 5 to 1 as it changes octaves. You have multiple places where the repeated notes seems to require 1 - 1 (example is the low C in measure 6). I think a careful practicing of this where you try to bring it up to speed will reveal all those spots."
