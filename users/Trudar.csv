Proxmox,fdcb889,t1_fdc4rxj,1578270805.0,"I have stupid switch. QoS works on OS level too, but it's basic logic, prioritize packets with lower TTL, and like I said - turn off RDP, and it works much faster.

Proxmox,fdc3z2e,t1_fdbrle6,1578266646.0,"Bandwidth is one thing, latency is another. If you have mixed set of mostly TCP packages - encapsulated SATA requests for lots of small chunks with MTU 1500 (which is below 4k mind you, and that what Windows is optimized for), RDP stream which is low latency high priority, internet connection (I was downloading one driver and installing some program), VM metadata, things that can get pushed back in the packet queue gets pushed back. If disk activity falls off the perfect timing you get spinning platter penalty (head missing read and waiting for next revolution), which adds latency even more. Raid Mirror helps here a lot, by the way. Removing RDP, which is time critical service helps a LOT since it brings back flexibility to the packet selection.

In such a diverse selection of packets, timing, etc., not only you won't get maximum speed, the total maximum speed will be far below full 1G link capacity, and many time slots will get wasted.

By extension 10G WILL help a lot, because it still has MTU of 1500! This means every single packet takes (roughly) 10 times less to process and send/receive, and it also brings back flexibility to the scheduling."

It has to carry storage packets, RDP, all communication of both host and VM, and internet traffic. It's too crowded, on top of the storage being on HDD.

There are spikes up to ~60 MB/s if I close RDP connection, and latency improves to sub-300 ms. As soon as I put back 10G cards and direct storage to work over it it will become much better."
Proxmox,fd9rvm1,t3_eke4z6,1578237233.0,"As a fun little experiment, I set up HA cluster on two nodes, with separate storage, using only GbE connections: one to storage using single uplink on a switch which houses my entire home network (30+ host), and single direct host to host cable for corosync (otherwise it'd crap out).

The resulting system is virtually unusable in Windows 7, somewhat usable in Windows 10, as you can see from 3 seconds disk response time you wait a lot. It's surprisingly responsive, though, no freezes, just waiting.

homelab,fd6ei4j,t1_fd60ysc,1578189750.0,"Ah :)

I have several kilometers of QSFP DACs at work, 1m each, often going from one device to another in same rack, usually in next U. This is NOT pretty, and amount of cables ripped out at the end of the plug is trough the roof. Same goes for things in top Us, where simply weight of the cable is enough to damage it, you have to manage tension and hook them up. Not big issue in production, but in dev/testing site where people move things around racks all the time it is royal PITA.

SFP is easier to manage than QSFP, and good quality DACs are imo more sturdy than RJ45 patchcords, but these somehow break more easily inside the cable, and don't take well twisting the ends. Also they are akin to 'wire' UTP (not the 'cord' with soft copper), and shouldn't be moved much.

Finally, in the same space that 4-5 SFP or RJ45 cables fit, you can stuff like 50 fibers."

Also building up, multi level is so damn troublesome, and on top of that you get the jetpack very late in the game, when your building habits are already set. Still, animations are pretty, and most things are pretty well prototyped.

Yeah, that's deep alpha. I'd definitely regret that $13, if it was finished game, but for EA game of this scale made by proper, experienced studio it's a steal."

This looks like an expensive display, why does it has dead pixel?"

I'm looking for new place, and flat I'm partial to buying, has electrical system made in late 80s. 230 V (Europe), but power runs on 0.75 mm sq. (20 awg, if my conversion is correction), with two 16A breakers - one for all outlets, including water heater, stove, etc., second for light fixtures. Not a single grounded plug, and wires are aluminium wrapped with oiled cotton. I have trouble negotiating price down for that, as seller says, that no one needs more power, and I am not up to current times, as things use less power now than ever.

Well, my homelab has 750W idle consumption with everything up... I might need to scale down my HL down for a bit, as if I move there it will be good year before I can afford to basically lay down complete new wiring in the whole apartment.

Good luck, and don't forget about good UPS..."
