A not boring person would either engage with the conversation or steer it themselves to something they think is interesting. Just being passive and waiting for it to end or go in another direction is boring.

Be the change you want to see in the conversation."

>A Bone Apple Tea is a malapropism, which is the mistaken use of a real, dictionary-defined word or phrase in place of another real, dictionary-defined word or phrase that sounds similar, resulting in a nonsensical, sometimes humorous utterance. An example is the statement by baseball player Yogi Berra: ""Texas has a lot of electrical votes,"" rather than ""electoral votes.""

It was so cool knowing that your retina was receiving photons from a supernova 11.5 million light-years away. Totally awesome!

We were told that it was almost certainly the furthest thing we would ever see in our lives (with our eyes)."

Is it that they aren't giving it to those in more need (e.g., through charity)? Is it that they aren't leaving their own house and money to their children (who will likely be 30+ when they die)? Or that they are taking out another loan just so they can enjoy themselves?

Orrrrr is it the ad agency that's scummy for trying to convince old people to get more loans?"
