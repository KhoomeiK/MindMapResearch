GoogleFi,fefunc1,t3_eosr4d,1579065743.0,"This happen to me a few weeks ago.  I noticed some of my status said disconnected under the phone/sim status regardless if I was on wifi or not--i say this because this was someone's explanation on Reddit to me which turns out to be false.  So here is what I noticed, after I toggle airplane mode, I would get a connection for less than a min and then I would notice out going text messaging works, but right after the first one sends/works, anything right after would be stuck or pending.  Yeah, I tried toggling wifi and airplane mode but the outcome was on repeat. The next day, I notice when I am in a different area of town, I then finally have connection status regardless if I was in wifi or not; therefore, it is independent of wifi status. After some research, I understand more on how to switch between the carriers with the dial codes.  I did, and my connection status stays permanently this far, where as others say, the switch code only works for two hours then reverts back--false for me.  So I thought it was just a bad day, it was but more so, to do with the failure to have mobile network status be connected.  I have a pixel 4."
