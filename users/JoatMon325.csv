Why wouldn't they word it in - at the very least - an neutral way, like, 'Everyone in the building is a mandated reporter when any abuse is suspected. It's not our job to investigate, only to voice concerns for children in our care.'
Or something besides that lame excuse.
You did the right thing. Better to be safe than sorry and have anything come back to haunt you."

Teachers,feykrhx,t1_fewg8pj,1579446908.0,"Ugh, I'm now remembering an event that I want to promptly forget forever. My first year teaching, I traveled for each class (different classroom for each class since the school was overcrowded and there were no extra classrooms). My prep period was spent either in the library (with mean, non helpful librarians) or the break room in my main hallway. It's an old building and there were 2 small bathrooms in it. I imagine this is where..... *shudder*...... It happened and I didn't even know til I got home.

I go to undress after work and on my thigh is a dark spot. I immediately freak out and swat at it and it's not going away quickly. *trying not to vomit now* It was a roach... A BIG ONE... and it was dead, crushed on my leg. At some point it crawled up my pants leg and I must have itched or something and I just didn't know it was there most of the day.

I am so grossed out... Feel like I need to go shower and scrub my thigh now thinking about it and it was 12 years ago."

It happened today, as a matter of fact. Last week I had a thought about a Law and Order SUV episode. I was busy all day with my daughter - bringing her home from the dentist, going back out for her meds and soup. When I returned, she invited me to sit and watch TV in her room and that exact episode was on. I was previously about to eat at the restaurant and take her some soup afterwards. If I had, I wouldn't have stayed to watch TV with her.

1. You graduated from the school you apply to.

2. You personally know the principal.
Or
3. You go to church with the superintendent.

Bigger towns still difficult, especially in Social studies and RLA. But basically, it's WHO YOU KNOW.

Teachers,fdp90ur,t1_fdotk28,1578622830.0,"Pretty sure it's a possibility. My mother has limited teaching experience and a degree in communications and just retired as an Instructional Designer. She got into it as a technical writer. She ASSURES me that with the teaching experience I've got (no Master's either) that I'm very hireable - that they train you on the system(s) they have.

Definitely look into the programs used (Storyline, Captivate - online research can show you the programs used most) and seek out job listings. Remember that HR posts jobs and descriptions that you don't have to be 100% matched for. If you can fit most of the requirements and are capable of computer functions (as you would be in a classroom) then apply and see what happens!

When I tried 'easy going' 'team buidking' days, the games and tasks I had were sometimes ruined by a smart asses student... Taking away from the purpose of the task. And I KNOW when they tell me that my methods are stupid, not working etc. that they just don't understand that while THEY may not need those things, OTHERS in class do need them. But, still, to have your work shit on 50 to 80 percent of each day... It's too much.

My new location is in a prison and it's fantastic! I definitely love Adult Ed and will never return to secondary school.

I wanted to put what coins we had into his cup so I asked my husband to hand me what we had in change. I did it quickly - almost in one quick motion and kept walking. For some reason we quickly noticed that the Loch Ness flat penny was one of the coins we gave him.
I was torn - do we go back and relay the situation and offering to exchange the flat penny for a paper bill instead? - because, this guy does not want or need a freaking tourist item! We didn't go back and now this guy probably thinks we're shit tourists who gave him a useless coin. And I have to go back now to get another one."
