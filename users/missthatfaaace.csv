socialanxiety,fdrtyvc,t3_emst6p,1578689626.0,"I tried to talk to my parents about my anxiety when i was about 13 years old. Their response was “what do you have to be anxious about”. If the problem was addressed when I was 13, I truly believe I wouldn’t have escalated into what it is now as a 20 year old. My parents are finally starting to accept that I have depression and social anxiety but they still don’t truly understand what i’m going through. It’s frustrating. Other than that they’re great, loving parents. I also believe my mom has undiagnosed general anxiety but she’ll never get any help for it. I blame on the way my parents were raised."

socialanxiety,fclh2yj,t3_efzphg,1577747633.0,i HATE confrontation as well. as we speak i am actively avoiding a text from someone because i know when i answer it it’s going to be a difficult conversation.
socialanxiety,fcl114w,t3_ehlgmp,1577737480.0,i feel this every time i order food. i feel like the person taking my order is judging me on what i choose to get and the people around me are judging me as well. i work at the counter at a pizza place and I never find myself judging anyone else on what they get so I don’t understand why i think other people are judging me.
socialanxiety,fcl0d9f,t1_fcl04ca,1577737070.0,"i’ve known my best friend since we were 5 and now we’re 20, so I know that she will not judge me and she’s the only person i feel 100% comfortable with. i’m extremely grateful to have her but it’s a lot on her knowing that she’s the only one i feel comfortable around."
socialanxiety,fcl03f8,t3_ehoq01,1577736900.0,"couldn’t relate more. when texting, i often reword what i was gonna say 100 times until it doesn’t sound “weird”."
socialanxiety,fcl009g,t3_ehmwkr,1577736846.0,"i have the exact same problem. when i’m with my closest friends, i have no problems sparking up conversation and talking about my day and what’s been happening in my life. when i’m with anyone else though, i freeze and have nothing to say. i can’t talk about myself to other people because i think they don’t care and don’t wanna hear it."
socialanxiety,fckzko5,t3_ehqgiy,1577736579.0,me anytime i’m talking to anyone who isn’t my 2 closest friends
Temple,fbrh0s5,t3_dxo4vd,1577042824.0,"I got 2 incompletes this semester due to mental health reasons and I had no problem getting them. I just emailed my teachers about my situation and they were very understanding and willing to work with me. Also, I am not registered with DRS."
