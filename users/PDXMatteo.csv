They would see the forums as causing tensions which distorted their negative peace so the easiest way forward isn't too vote for more progressive action until we have a just peace, but to vote out the progressive until the uproar in their negative peace quiets again.

No, you don't and no you aren't. You are equating child and infirm care as life support, and now are trying to smash two unrelated arguments together. You're hitting new levels of bad faith.

Let's roll with your idea, child care is life support. Why does the mother need to do it? Why can't another person do it?

It's not semanti games, you're trying a bad faith redefinition just as you tried to squeeze in that leading opening argument.

Your debate strategy seems to be take the most ludicrous position. Get the other to accept it by omission with a baby Gish gallop and then claim victory.


But no, the mother is not necessary. We have formula, milk banks, and other humans exist. There is no requirement that the mother be the direct and only person to care for the child after birth.

The fetus being dependant on the mother for survival during gestation doesn't remove her bodily autonomy either. To suggest as much would mean any person can legally compel another to sustain their life. I don't really think you understand the argument at all. You don't even seen to grasp just what ""compel"" means.

If your version of the world existed I could make a medical slave out of you to provide me and other patients with the bone marrow or skin graphs or any other medically necessary procedure. I could compel you to provide the life saving medical support I needed and you wouldn't be able to claim any right to your own body. That's the consequence of declaring that a fetus is a person and the fetus has a right to compel the mother to carry it to term. That right destroys bodily autonomy.

Feeding an infant isn't life support. That's not what life support means.

If E. Coli exists ___at all___ that there isn't a good growth medium is irrelevant as you simply need transference.

That you're gross and don't wash shit says more, in connection to that username, about your general hygiene than about the ""sample size"" which is again... Irrelevant because that's not how statistics work dumbass.

Shall we continue to illustrate just how gross and stupid you are?"

So exercise that right to shut the fuck up."

Cause that'd be sad.

Your paper can still be summarized as ""I don't understand statistics""; and I'm being kind."

You clearly don't understand how statistics work and think ""it's not happened to me so it can't happen"".

Bacteria do not need ""optimal"" conditions either. Unless 40-140° is optimal and then sure, as long as you're storing your flour in conditions humans can survive in so can the microbes.

You are literally trying to state ___all___ of the food safety you learn in the industry is bullshit because you think your grade school understanding of biology trumps 60yrs of research.

If E. Coli can live in raw flour it can live on the cap. I really look forward to your ""well actually"" so I can again show you that you're not nearly as intelligent as you think you are."
