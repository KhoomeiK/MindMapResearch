He has taken a lot from you, but at least now he can’t take anymore. Remember you have control now and once you get back up there will be nothing stopping you. If you ever feel isolated my DM is always open.

I also want to give hugs :)"
SmashBrosUltimate,fev3wa2,t1_feu3wxs,1579392834.0,I just want to play with pyra. Rex can come along if he wants. Did I say with? I meant as.
wholesomememes,fem4a3c,t3_eptmwp,1579239263.0,"Get out of here with that, “does it even matter” bs. Andrew knows he got destroyed. Tryn to act like he let him win. I’ve seen these video game martyrs before and tbh I don’t buy it."
offmychest,fehy3tu,t3_ep5d4a,1579126188.0,"I’ve been in situations were advice makes things worse so I understand. I will not give advice. I know you don’t believe you deserve praise for this, but you do. You deserve a freakin gold medal I don’t care if everyone is doing the same thing in your situation. They all deserve praise. I would like to believe if I loved someone I would be with them no matter what, but if my wife became a man I really don’t know if I could be with them. What I do know is that it would be hard as hell on me and to get painted as the bad guy the whole time as I’m doing everything to make things right would be brutal. I cannot believe she said she couldn’t be with you because of something she did and you accept her, but she couldn’t accept you. I truly hope things turn around for you.

Edit: Idk if it is because you’re in such a defensive position right now that you can’t see it, but I don’t believe the people in the comments are attacking you or disrespecting anyone. In fact, I feel they are being extremely nice and understanding. Just wanted you to see that."

RetroPie,fdd3m40,t3_ekpsr1,1578293393.0,Super Mario World shouldn’t be a MAME rom if I’m not mistaken. That’s only for arcade games right? SMW in only on the snes.
pokemon,fd09ft4,t1_fd027eo,1578115603.0,"Honestly, I thought the same thing. One time it took me forever to get it to purpled and I thought I was doing something wrong. Eventually it worked but it took at least 30 tries. Then I found out the den doesn’t have the hidden ability I wanted and I wasted my time. :("
pokemon,fczq6w3,t1_fczpm63,1578106677.0,"Nice, ok I’ll think about it. I’m gonna build an offensive one for my shiny for now then a defensive one for my other eventually. Thanks for the help. Have a good one. :)"
pokemon,fczhuls,t1_fczfy49,1578101587.0,"Interesting. I wasn’t even thinking about airstream. So if I go that route what moveset would you go with? Bounce, waterfall, earthquake, and ice fang/stone edge? Also I hate bounce. Would it be a good idea to just have it for airstream?"
pokemon,fczf0w4,t1_fcz7uny,1578099784.0,"There’s the Pokémon uranium fan-game. I Never played it, but I remember everyone talking about it so I’m sure it’s good if you can find it."
pokemon,fczdoi6,t3_ehjsjn,1578098867.0,Would it be better to use intimidate or moxie for gyarados? I am probably going to try and set up with dragon dance so would It be better to survive longer to get off more dragon dances or just dragon dance enough to out speed and use moxie to increase his attack more? If u have any cool unique ways to use him I’d love to know. Thanks.
offmychest,fcsaqfa,t3_eifjb1,1577913898.0,"Awesome! I’m glad staying home worked out. I might have got the wrong idea and jumped to conclusions, but it sounded like they were abusive and they did that so much you just gave up trying to fight or fix it. I hope things work out for you."
offmychest,fcq2tti,t1_fcq0yzc,1577877507.0,"Thanks. To be honest I just remember the times when I was down and I had no one to talk to. I feel even if the problem doesn’t get solved just having someone to talk to helps a lot. This is the time when people will reflect on the past year and I don’t want them to feel depressed if they had a bad one. Most people will be partying so I wanted to be their if they needed help. Seriously, Thanks for taking the time to write that. It made my night."
offmychest,fcpz5lr,t1_fcpxhx5,1577875286.0,It’s always the sweetest people that others try to take advantage of. It’s disappointing. I’m sorry imma stop talking before I rant and turn this into something else. I wish you the best of luck.
offmychest,fcpwtni,t1_fcps5bg,1577873843.0,"You cannot give up. No one has the right to call you up and disrespect you like that. He’s your ex. He’s no longer part of your life. Therefore, he should have no affect on your life. No one can handle someone trying to ruin their life ever chance they get. I hope you feel better and have a happy New Years!!!"
offmychest,fcpt2a2,t3_eigfi3,1577871521.0,"I don’t really have any friends either and have been fighting to stay interested in even the things I like to do. The best way for me to work past it is to just find someone to talk when I’m down and to put effort into taking care of myself and working harder on things that I’m embarrassed about myself. Honestly, if my gf was that upset because she thought she ruined my New Years because she was acting weird and/or down it would melt my heart. I wouldn’t worry too much."
offmychest,fcpofpl,t3_eig0cl,1577868688.0,"Honestly, I don’t find that weird. In fact, if someone went out of their way to comfort me like that it would, in your word, intrigue me.

edit: Also it sounds like the start of a beautiful love story so I say go for it :)"
offmychest,fcpnic7,t3_eig3fn,1577868126.0,"Hell ya. I was down a lot this year, but I’m back up excited to take a crack at this new decade. I feel like this is my time and nothing’s stopping me. Good luck my friend."
offmychest,fcpmg6p,t1_fcpi46e,1577867489.0,"If they are texting you wondering were you are and you are ignoring them it sounds like they are already worried. I don’t know the dynamic of your family, but if there is someone who is close to you who you can tell I would. This path of not wanting people to worry will not end well. I know, I’m the same way. You need people you can talk to during these times or they will sallow you. Then the people that you were trying not to bother will feel even worse than they would have if you just told them. It can be really hard to talk about, but you need someone. You got to live for yourself sometimes.

I would try to tell your partner how you feel and if they don’t want to listen than fuck them. They don’t have the right to make you feel like you can’t see your family on New Years. I would go and try to cheer up and avoid them. I just don’t want you to go back home just so they can make you feel worse there. I just can’t see you being happy going home. I might be getting the wrong idea, but it seems like you get abused often by your partner. Whatever you decide I would definitely rethink your relationship afterwards as it sounds like it’s taking a toll on you. Please, tell me how it goes."
offmychest,fcphvbf,t3_eifjb1,1577864742.0,"I understand. I say it would probably be better to go spend time with your family as I’m sure your family would want you there sad or not. However, if you really need a break from everything after the fight I would at least let them know what you are doing. Is your partner going with you?"
anime,fcocznw,t1_fcmu0ru,1577829220.0,"Dang, no black clover. I thought they had some of the best opening music."
offmychest,fcb0ofh,t1_fc9243x,1577580362.0,"Same. I keep feeling like I’m not good enough to be in a relationship. Not that no one will accept me for who I am, but more like I can’t accept myself. I don’t know why I’m so hard on myself, but I’m working to get to a point were I can love myself and feel good enough. It’s tough because sometimes I just feel stuck and I’m not making any progress. Like I will never get there. Also seeing people in a worse position than me in relationships makes it feel pointless at times. This post and these comments make me feel a lot better though and make me want to try even harder. We will get through this and we will become better people for it I know it. Kumbaya and all that."

This is late because I’ve been very busy, but man what an episode! I haven’t had time to comment on most discussions, but I had to for this episode. The most beautiful and moving scene I’ve seen in anime is the scene were taiga runs outside screaming for ryuuji. Right when you see the tear hit the scarf it gets your emotion flowing then it just hits like a train when she runs for the door crying. It makes you happy that she finally accepts her feelings for ryuuji, but I rips your heart out knowing she just let him go and you can clearly feel taiga’s pain. It just gives me a weird feeling of joy and despair that I rarely feel with other shows or at least never to this level. Any first timers that made it this far I’m glad you were able to experience this."
offmychest,fbffklf,t3_ed0358,1576809368.0,"Man this hit so close to home. I just turned 24 and I feel the exact same way. Like I should be doing more in my life and compared to others I’m way behind. I use to be the friendliest, talkative person, but in middle school I got depression. Even though I should have been the happiest person in the world I just couldn’t feel happy anymore. My parents would yell and make me feel stupid when I tried to tell them so I tried to handle it myself. It affected my dating life much like yours and it’s frustrating having everyone else wonder why you’re so far behind. I had a problem with forgiving my parents as well as, without going into detail, messed up a huge part of my life. I hope it helps you to know that you are not the only one going through problems similar to yours. If you want to chat just dm me. I promise I will not ghost you. I know how important it is for someone to be their for you when you’re going through a rough time."
