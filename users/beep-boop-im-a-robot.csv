Something just clicks when you notice that dudes like Cartier-Bresson and Adams and Frank mastered something that isn’t so much about technical intricacies (sure, that’s part of their craft.. for Adams it certainly was), but about the mental efforts you put into your photos. Especially Bresson just f-ing mastered composition, but this goal, it’s so vague and so confusing in the beginning that I knew, if I ever want to be happy with my photos, I *have* to change my approach. I have to take distance from digital. It’s one big distraction. Start with the most immediate and simple camera you can think of, make mistakes that make you suffer, no shortcuts. And it worked..I’m still far off from being happy with the outcome and at times it actually keeps me from taking photos, but whenever I shoot and develop, it’s almost meditative, being focused and relaxed at the same time and the slowness.. oh, that’s the greatest part. 

I love messing with the medium, developing, reading into film- and camera-related topics, the capabilities of the medium is still astonishing to me, all of that is great, but the reason I adore it, is that it’s a counterbalance for the hurried days we live in. And if I say that, being in my mid-20s, I really think something has changed since then, but something important and meaningful and relaxing has survived through analog media and is gratefully taken up by a younger generation now."
bestof,fdlvwkv,t1_fdkynf3,1578533765.0,"This gets even more complicated if you take into consideration that the way you develop the film will have a drastic influence on the outcome in terms of resolution. 

This is one of the things that made me become so interested in film photography: it’s a scientific method (densitometry and sensitometry) that yields the best quality possible even by today’s standards IF you know what you’re doing and some of the great photographers (OP of this comment mentioned Ansel Adams already) have mastered this. 
Besides that, experimenting with it is fun and makes you appreciate old photographs even more. 
For everyone who’s interested in the whole process..I’m about to leave you with a novel about some of the quality-defining variables that play a role here (all in bold type). Have fun.
It’s the stuff I learned so far..I’m not very good at developing, but it’s fascinating. I hope some of you might enjoy reading about it:


————

CHEMICALS

Let’s take a look at an example, starting with the **choice of chemicals to develop** the film:
There’s a b&w developer called ""Rodinal"", let’s start here. It was first patented in Germany in 1891 (ffs..) and is still available with barely any changes in formula till this day, this is how good this stuff is. Why? It’s famous for being cheap, it allows for a fast development (rapid developer) and it has the tendency to push edge contrast, almost as if it emphasized silhouettes (Eberhardt-effect). Take this, vibrance filter in lightroom.. anyway..

Such a developer usually comes in liquid form (stock solution) and is diluted with water to your liking, either to work fast (smaller dilution) or to work economically + more precisely (more diluted). Even at this point, making a **decision on which dilution to use** will influence the grain, hence the quality of your developed negatives: Rodinal is most often used as a rapid developer 1+25 (meaning 1 part Rodinal, 25 parts water) with the benefit of very short development times. Or you use a 1+50 dilution, which will slow down the chemical interaction in a way that not only takes longer to get the negatives developed, but also creates finer (""less emphasized"") grain, resulting in higher resolution. 


FILM TYPE

Alright, what about the film ISO thingy?
As mentioned by dcviper above, the higher your film speed (light sensitivity of the film emulsion) the more grainy your photo. Chemical engineers of big photographic manufacturers have worked for decades to produce and improve a vast palette of film emulsions, but the two main factors are **grain size** and **grain structure**.
Think of the first as if there was a cluster of light sensitive crystals: increase the crystal size and you increase the likelihood of photons to ""hit"" a crystal (which is what you will see as a small black dot on your developed negative, if you have a microscope..thousands and hundred thousands of these form your image). 
Grain structure on the other hand is less about the size but the shape of these crystals. Kodak and other manufacturers have invested huge amounts of money to come up with improved crystal structures in the 90s: T(abular)-grain. They’re bigger at the same time, but it’s more about the surface structure and the way they absorb light. But what do I know? The whole chemistry of silver halides and light interaction and sensitizing dyes is getting complicated and we haven’t even started using dye couplers to capture colors at this point. This is all just b&w, keep that in mind!
Ah, and there are different formats. The equivalent of a full frame sensor is 35mm film, but that’s actually very small compared to medium format or large format photos and both were (and still are) used by professionals. The emulsion that is used to create a 35mm film is from the same batch as the one that is used for medium or large format negatives..so, the crystal size is the same, but the image dimensions are different, leading to larger/more visible grain for smaller formats, i.e. less image resolution/quality. 
But there’s one more thing with film ASA/ISO: it’s more of a suggestion on how to use the film (or: how to expose the film to light), but film is amazingly versatile in its ability to store information. Depending on the film and it’s ability to handle over- and underexposure, you can take photos with only 1/8th of the intended exposure time and compensate by developing longer. Let’s say a journalist was forced to take indoor photos at some point. He could use a 400 ISO film treating it as a 1600 ISO film, develop it longer and would end up with okay-ish results instead of black pictures. This is called **push process** and has been used for decades. If you expose with more light and develop for a shorter amount of time, it’s called **pull process**. Some films are famous for their ability to handle all sorts of light situations..think of the moon landing. Kodak designed a film emulsion for this purpose, specifically. 

FILM PROCESSING

The variables mentioned above are all set before you even started developing..so now the part where we’d start processing the film. No need to talk about the other steps, since they don’t influence the quality too much, but let’s just give an overview: develop the latent image, (use a stop bath to stop this process), then use fixer to stabilize it. 

We know, chemical reactions always depend on **temperatures**. The higher the temperature, the faster the chemical interaction and that’s exactly what we have to take good care of. Rodinal is usually prepared to be 20°C / 68°F. You can de- or increase the temperature to either speed things up or slow them down, but again, this will have an influence on the image quality as well. If you decided to develop a film at 18°C / 64,5°F and corrected the development time to be slightly longer, you could end up with slightly finer grain. So that’s another variable. 

Alright, we got our film roll in a developing tank, which is a cylinder you can hold in your hands and you got your timer right beside you. You’d usually look up the film-developer-combo in a chart and correct for temperature discrepancies, if needed. To make sure that the reaction of developer and film emulsion is as regular as possible and that there’s ""fresh"" (chemically potent) developer covering the film surface ever so often, you want to keep the liquid in motion. But you also want to give it some rest..to interact. You end up with alternating phases of rest and motion, called **agitation rhythms** and it’s up to you, whether you softly turn the cylinder 2 times every 15 seconds or 5 times every minute. But guess what: it influences the quality of your negatives. At least, some people have made very different experiences with certain combinations of developer and agitation rhythms. 


So, to recapitulate..those are the most important quality variables:

**Film**
- ASA/ISO (grain size)
- grain structure (original film emulsions vs. modern tabular grain)
- shoot at suggested speed vs. push/pull process

**Film Processing**
- choice of developer (rapid vs. fine grain vs. specific T-grain developers)
- developer dilution
- temperature
- agitation rhythm

Edit:
As you can see, the photographic process has always been about resolution and yes, a medium format photo (as it was used by almost every camera throughout the first half of the last century) has a resolution that leaves you with an amazing amount of detail, even if earlier lens designs couldn’t resolve the scene too well or without a number of aberrations. They did good, film emulsions on the other hand are next level bullshit even by today’s standards."

blender,fczbrot,t1_fczaxsd,1578097732.0,"Prior to 2.8, there was the Blender Internal Render engine. It’s been outdated for years by that time, but back in the day, it was also nice if you knew how to fake stuff. It always depends on your take on shaders, textures, lighting, settings and some of the older entries in the blender gallery show what the early masters achieved with that stuff. 

Cycles is still. My engine of choice, since it’s somewhere between working in a physically based workflow and simplicity and yet allows to fake all sorts of stuff. 

The other one you could mean is workbench, which is just a viewport representation of simple shaders to model in, etc. 
Or you mean third party engines like luxrender (is that even what it’s called nowadays? I’m getting old :>), which is amazing btw, or octane or dozens of others."
blender,fczavsq,t1_fcz9d7l,1578097210.0,"eevee is taking as many shortcuts as possible to represent reasonably realistic results in real-time.

Cycles on the other hand simulates the distribution of light rays (photons) in a way that is somewhat close to actual laws of physics. But since this a very good representation of how light actually works (leading to possibly photorealistic results), it takes a long time.

However, you need to know what you’re doing to achieve photo-realistic results and it’s definitely possible with both engines."

How many samples should be used would always depend on the scene and image resolution, but usually at least 500+ will result in okay-ish results and you’d have a workflow that will adapt the samples as needed."
