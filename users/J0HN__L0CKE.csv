RedLetterMedia,ff9geaa,t3_es5adl,1579712450.0,DS9 is my favorite Trek series
youtubetv,ff7yhrc,t3_erx4yo,1579661382.0,"Awesome.

But I almost can't believe there's less than 10 days left.

It's been an honor to serve with you."
playstation,ff7um7f,t1_ff7tfcu,1579658748.0,"You sound like a dad who always turns off the lights or won't let you run the AC haha.

I'm sure it's negligible to my power bill, and I keep other electronics on nearly 24/7 too. Either way I couldn't imagine worrying about that."
playstation,ff66hla,t1_ff65shf,1579620298.0,"Yeah, I'm not getting what the downside of rest mode is? It's a positive feature... Am I missing something?"
playstation,ff66dgl,t3_ertuf8,1579620219.0,I don't understand this. I never not put it in rest mode... Why wouldn't I?
startrek,ff61kbj,t1_ff60kti,1579616783.0,"I know, it's lame since it was really just a great service. Hopefully YouTube TV isn't much worse"
startrek,ff5yu45,t1_ff5xgux,1579614627.0,"Not a boomer, under 30, watches live TV here (granted, not cable but PS Vue... soon to be YouTube TV when Vue goes away)

I couldn't live without live TV as an option. First of all- sports. And sometimes I just want to flip to something to just have on that I may not be super invested in. 

Going into a streaming service and manually picking something isn't the same for that purpose. 

For example, I own every season of every Star Trek series and it's surely available on more than 1 of the nearly 10 streaming platforms I sub to... yet I'll never actually watch it that way... but I passed by DS9 on BBC America last night and ended up watching it for 3 hours."

PSVR,fep7p48,t3_eq0rmh,1579313995.0,Delays don't matter anymore. Multiple games I want come out every month on top of an already massive backlog. Back in the day the wait for games felt agonizing and there would be droughts with nothing worthwhile coming for months at a time. This is no longer the case.
anime,fep3ccf,t3_eq1mje,1579311206.0,Loving this

anime,felbj5k,t3_epj379,1579218315.0,This show is sweeter than I expected it to be
anime,feki3bv,t1_fek7a2m,1579200503.0,"I go to a decent amount of anime movies that play about an hour from me and almost never have a bad audience experience. This was the worst by far. I'm proudly a weeb, and yet know how to conduct myself as normal functioning human. The dudes at my theater seemed like they were making their annual trip from out of the basement. 

Promare was actually the second worst, had a dude a couple seats over from me very noticeably snoring the whole time lol."

anime,feij485,t3_ep6nod,1579139715.0,"There were some absolute cunts at my theater talking the entire time, making noises and whatever during silent moments on purpose. Those losers need to take a beating."

startrek,fe4z79b,t3_emb1vl,1578864187.0,Good lord this is awful. I didn't think I could be less hopeful for Picard but here we are. The people in charge of trek now should be tried as the criminals they are

anime,fdom9er,t3_em9e13,1578608017.0,Very comf. This seems like it will be a adaptation that's better than the source material.
anime,fdom36g,t1_fdolyyg,1578607914.0,"So far, no."
depression,fdnjsi2,t3_emaxm4,1578587283.0,"I gave myself until 30. Got less than half a year left. Still miserable. I hope I don't bitch out, but it's a fact I will üòû"

depression,fd6owyx,t1_fd6ktsz,1578193957.0,"Look, I'm not one to just willy nilly say dump a friend- maybe you don't have many others or it isn't easy for you to make friends and you'd rather have a shitty one than none at all. 

But if you can afford to drop this dude, you should do it, because he clearly doesn't value the friendship as much as you do. 

If you're gonna date your best friends ex, you ask and get a clear OK first. And then still don't do it because it's gonna be fucked situation 9/10 times."

television,fcc0560,t3_egsye5,1577592912.0,"Disney+ is very limited by it's own nature. I'll never keep it for more than a month at a time (whenever the full season of X Star Wars show is out). I just finished watching Mandalorian in 2 days with the free trial and will now cancel it.

I barely use Netflix, for example, but I'll always keep it just to have the option. It has the potential to put out anything and has a ton of original & non-original shows on my backlog. But Disney originals are basically going to boil down to just Star Wars and Marvel and I don't care about Marvel. And it would all come out at a much slower rate even if I did care. Having a back catalog of Disney movies I've already seen does nothing for me either."
