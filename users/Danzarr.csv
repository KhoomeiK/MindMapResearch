todayilearned,ffeq2k5,t1_ffepipd,1579859811.0,"He was a bank teller, and the world ended with everyone dying but him in an instantaneous nuclear holocaust. There's a lot of ways to take that episode, it's main theme is solitude vs loneliness, the world's streak of antiintelectualism towards reading, and the protag's antisocial behaviour. I don't think he was a bad person, just beaten down by a world that didn't understand/tolerate him, and then punished for thinking he could exist without other people.

The episode and short story it's based on is: Time enough at last by Marilyn Venable."

The main reason would be the extra stop of light, but from what i have seen, both versions ([Art](https://www.pentaxforums.com/userreviews/sigma-30mm-f14-dc-hsm-art.html) and original) are sharper than the 28 (unless its on FF) and have somewhat better AF, with the legacy having sharper corners but the art having better center sharpness and overall design.  The older 30 you can generally score for less than the 28,150-250usd, while the art used goes in the 3-400 range. Alternatively, if you want to bite the bullet and get some range, the sigma 18-35 1.8 is fantastic and goes for 4-500, so probably out of budget, but I thought it was worth a mention.
