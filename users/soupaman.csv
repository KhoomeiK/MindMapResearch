I woke up after my flight left and called my mom to admit my stupidity. While pacing around my apartment talking to her on the phone I see my passport between the wall my entertainment center. I then immediately had a flashback to drunkenly whipping out my passport to show some girl all my sweet stamp and visa. Thanks for listening."
