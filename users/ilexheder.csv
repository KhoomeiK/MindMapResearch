news,feo4i2c,t1_fenl5ty,1579295024.0,"Oh come on. Yes, she could certainly be lying about never having been disciplined. But I think it stretches credulity to suggest that she forged a bunch of commendations and awards in her own name and sent them to a journalist for no apparent gain apart from a brief mention in a news article. People who are on thin ice with management don’t generally get numerous awards from the management at the same time. There’s also the fact that the supervisor who told her she could go was also fired—what are the odds of both of them simultaneously being on the cusp of firing already? 

Second, of course nobody thinks the bank is going to release a statement to tell the press about all the fuckups they’ve had to discipline her for. But cases like this where the public is furious on behalf of a fired person do usually provoke a diplomatic statement saying something along the lines of “It is XYZ Corp’s policy not to comment on individual employment decisions. However, we assure the XYZ customer family across America that customer service is at the heart of our corporate philosophy.” The distinction between even a non-statement like that and actual silence is pretty significant, and suggests to me that national communications may be struggling to figure out how to deal with this.

I have no doubt that she and her supervisor did break policy. But reacting with immediate dismissal for both of them seems very unusual and makes me immediately think of two possibilities: either both of them were incompetent in general (which seems unlikely to me for the reasons I’ve mentioned) or, given that the woman named was a “senior banker” and her supervisor was presumably even higher-ranked, somebody had been asked to keep an eye out for opportunities to dismiss high-paid employees “for cause” to make it cheaper to replace them with lower-paid ones."

Because the country’s population is still slowly growing (which is a good thing) school districts have to do that every few decades and it takes a long time to save for and/or pay off. And let’s not even get started on the costs in between—reroofing, HVAC system replacements, redoing the parking lots after they heave in bad winters . . . And that’s just the stuff I’m familiar with. What does it cost to heat and cool a building that size? To get internet service? To pay for insurance and other benefits for all those employees? Probably a shit ton.

Put it this way: if you could actually run a school on $3000 a year, private schools would be undercutting other private schools on price and at least some would end up being significantly cheaper than they are. Why don’t any of them try to do that? Because they can’t.

Catholic schools—which tend to be pretty damn bare-bones—still cost anywhere between $7,000 and $50,000 per child per year in New York. If having faculty who have taken a literal vow of poverty can’t get your costs below that, it probably can’t be done."

Public schools spread that cost over your entire tax-paying lifetime (plus the tax-paying lifetimes of people with fewer or no kids), making it possible for people to send five kids to school without ending up in the poorhouse. 

BTW, nobody exactly loves paying taxes, but I don’t get too upset about it since—because of the job I pay the taxes on—I frequently see the numbers for just how much the government has to pay to do things like replacing 70-year-old bridges and building new train stations.

Uh, no, 4 is definitely old enough to notice and be hurt if your father is reluctant to acknowledge his relationship to you.

What happens when he and his son run into one of his friends at the grocery store and the friend says “Oh, hey, this is that kid you called your ‘little buddy,’ right? So are you doing Big Brothers Big Sisters now?” Even in the best-case scenario, if Dad’s willing to go “haha, well, actually . . .” and explain to the friend rather than lie again in person, the kid will still see that Dad’s previously chosen to somehow give people the impression that he isn’t his son.

First-aid training is not that uncommon, and there’s an excellent chance that there was someone on the plane who had it less that fifteen years ago and would have been a better first-aider; by getting up in response to a call specifically for doctors, Fred effectively “jumped the queue” ahead of them. 

It doesn’t sound to me like OP picked a fight—she reacted with surprise (“Wait, what?”) to a story of someone she knows doing something she has enough medical training to be aware is a bad idea. (Five years in the medical field including three years of medical school isn’t “experience related baggage,” it’s . . . experience.) Then they talked about it. She even mentioned that she thought his intentions were noble—the only thing she criticized is his judgment. How can it possibly be an asshole move to express disagreement with a friend’s judgement on the basis of five years of training and experience on the topic of a serious situation? This is her actual job, something she’s presumably passionate about and knows about—if her husband wanted to continue the conversation (which it sounds like he did) she’s not going to just go “never mind, I guess you’re right” if she knows he’s not."

As you’ve mentioned, the flight attendants are trained for this situation. So the friend should have adhered more closely to their actual request: they asked specifically for a doctor, not for someone trained in first aid. If it was the kind of emergency situation where the crucial thing was to immediately get anyone with even basic medical training to the scene as soon as possible, that’s what they would have asked for. Nothing wrong with mentioning to a passing flight attendant that you have (15-year-old) first aid training—but the thing to remember is how much of a slowdown even one person out of their seat on an airplane can cause. If there’s a medical emergency going on, that’s a very good reason to err on the side of waiting for a more general request or waiting to ask a passing crew member *before* getting out of your seat and, as is unfortunately inevitable on an airplane, becoming a bit of a roadblock."

You mentioned that you value the long-distance friendships you have with close friends whom you’re not frequently in touch with. I also have friendships like that, am happy with them, and value them highly. But when I’m doing that, I tend to think of the friendship as effectively “paused,” like a movie. I’m confident that we’ll pick right up where we left off when we see each other again, but I also wouldn’t think of us as having been part of each other’s lives for the intervening six months or whatever.

Most people treat relationships a bit differently, precisely because they’re not willing to “pause” a relationship. The majority of people who feel strongly enough about each other to be dating would find it a serious hardship to not be part of each other’s lives for a few months, even knowing when the separation would end. This is why most people in long-distance relationships take steps to continue being part of each other’s lives, such as regular phone calls or letters—they still want the other person to play a day-to-day role in their life.

If two people in a relationship are equally willing to “pause” it during a separation, there’s nothing wrong with that. But to me this sounds like an indication that your girlfriend may not actually be as okay with it as she thought she was. Being surprised by your weight loss is a big, visible indicator of just how much you weren’t part of each other’s everyday lives, and it seems like she’s feeling that pretty deeply right now."

worldnews,fcwjt6d,t1_fcvumo7,1578027559.0,"This is actually one of the interesting differences between impeachment and a standard criminal proceeding. In a criminal trial you have to figure out the specific name of the crime you’re accusing the person of committing, as defined under your state’s penal code, and then charge them with it. In an impeachment you don’t. (This is in general, not specific to Trump.) You just draw up articles of impeachment that *describe* what you’re accusing the President of having done, and then everybody argues about (a) whether he did it and (b) whether it counts as “High Crimes and Misdemeanors” as mentioned by the Constitution. If you could get enough members of Congress and Senators to vote yes, you could impeach and remove a President for supporting the New England Patriots, without needing to locate a definition of that crime in a statute of any kind. Of course, making your accusations sound like the kind of thing that everybody knows is illegal generally helps your case, but in terms of legality it doesn’t actually matter.

“Obstruction of Congress” wasn’t intended to be the name of a crime Trump had allegedly committed; it’s a header introducing the overall *type* of actual crimes described in the article (some of which are very specific, like defying subpoenas). Similarly, the other article of impeachment for Trump is titled “Abuse of Power,” which isn’t a crime either, but is then followed by a list of things that are probably crimes. Nixon’s articles of impeachment didn’t have titles at all, they were just “Article I,” “Article II,” and “Article III,” all followed by a bunch of long descriptive sentences.

If you think about the context, it makes sense to organize it this way, because it’s pretty unlikely that you’d ever end up impeaching a President for just one act. First, Presidents generally fuck up by telling various people at various times and in various situations to fuck things up on their behalf, each of which is a crime, or part of the crime, depending on how you want to look at it. Second, by the time enough information has trickled out and enough political momentum has built up, you’re almost invariably going to be dealing with a whole network of shit (a.k.a. “the coverup” that one proverbially gets fucked by). Third, the people writing up the articles of impeachment want everyone to keep in mind the overall big picture of why these actions, if demonstrated, are a problem. Think of them as chapter headings."

Or to put it another way: little boys need protection and care from their parents just as little girls do. Do you think parents are constantly keeping a subconscious eye out for a good woman to take on the mommy role for their son? Do they inwardly feel a sense of relief as the young man’s mother hands over the duty of sheltering and nurturing him to his new wife? I certainly hope not. 

If you’re still inclined to confuse the type of one-way support and associated protectiveness appropriate to a parental relationship with the type of mutual support appropriate to a marriage, consider that almost all societies have powerful taboos against mixing those relationships even when technical incest is not an issue. It’s generally considered repulsive to have a romantic relationship with someone you had a protective, parental relationship with in their childhood, even if all parties were aware the whole time that you had no blood relationship.
