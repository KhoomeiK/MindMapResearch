LifeProTips,fdmxex2,t1_fdmopov,1578570129.0,"But, I believe those numbers could be much higher IF we trained the public to perform high quality CPR propr to EMS's arrival. That study just showed ""CPR done prior to EMS's arrival"" and who knows what kind of actual CPR that was. That is also CPR that's done pripr to EMS's arrival which includes unknown down time. So a witnessed arrest out of hospital could still be much higher than that study that shows 10.5 percent."

books,fdlyk10,t1_fdlxlno,1578535568.0,"Sorry, not gonna give any spoilers, I hate accidentally reading them, lets just say that the movie may be a little more believable and the book a little more fantastical.  But the book focuses much more switching point of views from the characters and you get some more insight into the motivations of the characters, especially Magua (who was the 'bad guy'?) from the movie.  Also just the general layout of what everyone is doing is different, it retains some 'lets go rescue people' but in very different setting/ reason/ characters"
