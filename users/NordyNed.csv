Hall developed nasty altitude sickness shortly after beginning down from the summit, which is common on Everest, where 1 in 10 people who attempt the summit die. His party, too weak to rescue him, left him for dead and even tried to build a grave, but could not and so went back down and informed his family he had perished.

The next morning, a climbing party on the way up to the summit found him sitting in the snow without a coat, hat or gloves (in -50 degree temperatures) organizing his empty oxygen bottles, and they abandoned their own summit attempt to rescue him. His survival all night at that altitude, believed to be medically impossible, baffles the world.

Edit: fact checked the death statistics

Edit2: title inaccuracies:

- he lacked a coat, hat, gloves, or sunglasses, but he was not naked

- he was the person to survive at the highest altitude overnight, but not the only person to survive in the death zone. Beck Weathers, who survived at 27,000 feet  during the 1996 Everest Disaster (immortalized in the awesome Jon Krakauer book *Into Thin Air*), is a notable example. Hall was at 28,600 feet, however.

- people debate the numbers but deaths are anywhere between 2-20%

- Hall didn‚Äôt spend the night at the summit, but at the top of the Hillary Step, just below the summit"
