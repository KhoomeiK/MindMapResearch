You are teasing the hell out of him and if one of the ladies is in estrous/heat, and you aren't aware, he can and will mount and mate before you can pull him off (it takes a few seconds). It's not worth the litter and not worth stressing him with the hopes of a good time. 

Honestly, I would not even have him within a room or two of them. Mice communicate by smell and ultrasonic calls. You can't hear them but males will sing to females and he will know they are around if he is close enough. That is just more stress for both as every time the girls go into estrous/heat, about every 4-5 days, they will try to get to him and he to them. I'd just keep them separate, wash hands between cages (they will want to sniff your hands a lot) and spoil him with lots of time just between you two. 

Good luck with the new ladies when they arrive."

PetMice,ff27j58,t1_ff0u81v,1579496056.0,"I have owned hundreds of mice in as small as 10gallon tanks or CTs, without oodles of 'enriching' items in their cage, and never had a mouse that spun in circles. I had a curled tail or two but that was because the wheels were a smaller diameter than ideal. If I used wheels, I used wheels, and I never used discs. They were barely a thing then.

[This](https://old.reddit.com/r/PetMice/comments/6dlvd4/flying_saucer_stereotyping_behavior/) is my my post on the same issue, show multiple mice doing it with a very slanted and larger wheel.

Tagging /u/gdenofa, first so I don't double post that link, and also so they can see that old post and that larger wheel and multiple affected mice.

Blaming saucer discs is a hypothesis, but one I back strongly based on what I've seen. I am open to other theories with evidence or studies of course. If someone's mouse or mice is unaffected then that's fine and I am not trying to scare them. It's up to them to watch and take whatever precautions they feel comfortable with in any aspect of their husbandry."

I blamed the flying discs then and still do, whether it is too small or too neurologically damaging running in a tight sideways circle, I'm not sure. There is no literature on the device because these wheels are new to the market and no one has had a reason to investigate it. 

Waltzing mice are not common in the pet trade as it is a bad genetic condition that should not be passed on, so the odds it is a waltzing mouse probably low. It could be an ear infection, but it looks more like stereotyping to me. The fact that this has been documented in multiple box-store mice with the same small discs is pointing it more to being a disc issue. An inner ear infection or genetic inner ear defect would leave the mouse with a constantly tilted head, while a stereotypic behavior will be more random with a normal head carriage when not spinning."
dogs,fepk69k,t1_fen936h,1579322615.0,"I quote from what I've read from veterinarians and scientists, it is the general rule and would not include outliers.

Forcing an older feral to be a 'pet', all that stress and pressure, just so he can follow you around as a now semi-feral, is a debatable practice and one I see highly discouraged regardless how well meaning it might seem. I would not attempt it with the feral I mentioned and would find it cruel to lock him up and force human interaction he very clearly does not want. It's like making a wild animal into a pet, it makes the person feel good and the animal often miserable.

Your few examples are hardly enough justification to do it often and actually reinforces why it usually is a failure, especially with older cats. Most people don't want a house cat that claws at them or is so aloof or has such a low chance at being a stable loving pet. Those cats often end up being dumped or sent to a shelter due to their behavioral 'problems' that people just can not deal with. 

Often it is kinder to just accept the ferals for what they are, 'wild', and admire them from afar. If they want to interact, cool, if not, that's fine too. I admire my neighborhood feral, named him, say 'hi' to him from across the street, leave him food occasionally, and hope that he isn't harmed while he lives his own life out there. He once liked the rare petting session, but then he decided he just isn't that kind of cat. I don't take it personally and just pet my house cats who crave it instead."

It has to be the base so that you do not accidentally deglove the tail. You can pick them up by their tail briefly and then support them on your palm while still holding the tail for those that are a flight risk. The tail is also the fastest way to move them and the safest with a mean mouse that wants to bite. 

Most things done to mice can be considered mildly stressful, as they are a prey animal, but that doesn't mean it is cruel or harmful. Life is full of stressors and some stress can be good for the immune system so don't let it bother you too much. Be careful with becoming too compassionate or taking too much time to bond to these mice, as it is a job (like livestock) and they are not personal pets. Try to keep that distinction.

PetMice,fe6fr6n,t1_fe5du9o,1578889552.0,"Not all feeder mice come from some massive 'farm' or large-scale breeder that breeds only albinos*. Some come from hobby and show breeders that need a way to get rid of those that they don't need for their breeding projects. It is very hard to sell mice so for some it is easier to just sell them to (especially) private pet shops. It seems even the bigger shops are getting these types so their might be large-scale breeders using colors to increase pet sales/demand.

I got most of my best mice from just such a situation, a hobby breeder's castoffs at a local small shop. Great selection and good health and temperaments.

*Albinos are popular for feeders and laboratory due to selection bias by their keepers and breeders. Humans are naturally drawn to unique colors and markings so when they look all the same, the bias is heavily reduced. I was guilty of this when I bred my mice and rats."

Give a least two hides and spread the food around to avoid anyone 'protecting' it from the others. Two water bottles might also be good on opposite sides of the cage.

Allow them to be together in that new environment. Watch for excessive sparing or blood being drawn. It should only take a week or two for them to settle in if all is well between them. Their status as feeders or not makes no difference, mice are very territorial, and females will even kill a new suitor if he invades their cage/territory ( that's why females are always put in the male's cage, not vice versa).

PetMice,fd7xetw,t3_ek609t,1578211445.0,"The many dilution genes* (most common are B-liver and D-dilute) can cause the eyes to be so lightly colored as they appear red (the blood vessels are showing through). This is different from albino which is a double recessive gene where the white covers all color, including the eyes, and the true color is a mystery underneath. Pointed/'siamese' or 'burmese' marked mice have a version of albinism, the C series, that allows color to come through the albino on either cold body points(sias) or a lighter colored body and darker points (burms). For the albino series there are Siamese mice, Himalayan mice, Reverse Siamese, and Siamese Sables, with points being any color. 

Go through the colors [here](http://www.afrma.org/fancymice.htm) to see some of the many colorations, dilutions, and how they can affect eye coloration/appearance. So a blue mouse is a dilution of black, and liver/chocolate a dilution of agouti/sable/fawn, etc. [This](http://www.informatics.jax.org/wksilvers/) gets into the deep science genetics of color, which often applies to all mammal coloration as seen in so many domesticated species. While originally the colors were given genotypical names (Aa, Bb, ...) they are now able to pin point and confirm many of these with gene sequencing and mapping. Very cool stuff. If you like dogs, [this](http://www.doggenetics.co.uk/) is another site that is great for examples and explanations by a fantastic artist. Again, lots of overlap for all mammals. Have fun.

*These genes are known as a 'series', such as the albino series ""C"" with some of it's examples as (C, cb, cs, ca, c). The capital letter is the dominant allele, the lower case the recessive, and the third is a modifier on the recessive that marks it as a different version of a recessive (these can vary between sources even if meaning the same color, take note). So a mouse with cc as it's genotype is a pink-eyed albino, a CC mouse is normal colored, a cscs is a Siamese mouse, and a Ccs mouse is a normal colored mouse that carries the Siamese gene hidden."
gargoyles,fd6y5dh,t1_fd6s99s,1578197167.0,"I do not have Disney+, and I am not a watcher of GF, but with your description I can agree with censoring that episode if the rating doesn't match or is aimed at little kids. I'm honestly surprised the episode was allowed to be made with that if it is so graphic.

Even the animated movies and cartoons, like Deadly Force, that I can think of with more than a drop or slash of blood use it or violence as part of the story and a plot device. It is not just there to make a horror story or just to be gory. In Deadly Force, it is a deep story about the real issue that comes with playing with firearms. The blood is a small pool next to her hip, a small bit under her body when lifted by Broadway, and a fair bit on his hands seen from the side and back, so lessened (his palms on the other hand would have been more shocking). It is just about 8 seconds worth total of blood on screen.

This is a very cautionary episode for the Gargoyles series, probably the most so. I mean our leading lady Elisa, which most fan adore, almost dies to one of the most passive and sweet of the Gargs, by sheer accident of his enthusiasm and carelessness and Elisa's lack of forethought by leaving her gun out. Kids and even adults will remember that and it is a Aesop-like lesson that might stick especially with the emotional impact there. She might not have died, but for a while there it was Bambi's mom all over again, gripping for 12 minutes of uncertainty. The doctor at the hospital really laid it on that it wasn't just an in and out shot and she was just going to pull through effortlessly. ER shows have shown me that when bullets start bouncing around the torso the person rarely survives. The episode is intense and is just the same scenario that can and has happened in real life to exuberant kids and careless parents.

The creator talks about the episode [here](https://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?rid=59), a good read.

If D+ is censoring, then they have that right, it's their syndication if you will, same as Fox or CBS. If it bothers the fans well I guess they can buy the show unedited otherwise I'm not sure anything else would change it. I don't see the need to censor Gargs as much due to the above case for why there was blood in that episode. I watched DF on TV and dealt with whatever censoring they did back then, and now I own it so I don't worry as much as I see it as intended. Good discussion."

Much like the recent poster, it's the downfall of people letting them loose or letting them escape. It's sad.

I've decided that if I own rodents, which are unusual pets as it is, that I am happy with long time domesticated mice and rats over trying to tame yet another rodent species whose bite is rather awful if they are mean. It's not worth the headache of all the rules and caution one has to take. We only have ASFs available because Ball Pythons are so picky about what they eat to the point of starving if they don't like their prey.

[Here](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/pet-travel/bring-pet-into-the-united-states/pet-travel-rodents-into-us) they discuss that rodents from African origin, even if not born there, are illegal to travel at least into the States. I only found [this](https://nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/R43170.pdf), on page 8 (the species is named on page 22 from the 1960s ban), where it mentions that interstate travel is also under the ban, but it also mentions that changes to that might have been made. I can't find those changes but you could try and call and double check that such interstate travel is allowed. The states might also have their own laws to look into too. I know we had a redditor a while back that wanted to transport some in from Canada and the law is strict against that as 'international' importation, I'm just not as sure about say from TX to IL.

I can see why such laws exist, mainly because we have so many invasive animals and plants in the USA that I am sure they don't want more (especially as ASFs are so fecund). There is also the disease risk which is probably the CDC's main issue as there have been some diseases [spread](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/12/12/06-0812_article) by *M. natalensis* in Africa.

Read, read everything you can get your hands on; library books on species and herps in general (beardies, snakes, lizards, your species of snake, geckos, cresteds, etc.), internet sites, videos, forums (reddit and others). Read deep, take notes, soak it in and *look for patterns, not absolutes*. See what works and what doesn't, what issues are commonly had and how to fix them or better yet avoid them. Even older books are full of great knowledge and you will figure out what is tried and true over something that is considered out of date for husbandry.

Certain species of snake, like Balls, are temperamental about their food and feeding habits and there are tricks to get them to try to eat. Unless it is a skinny adult or baby, snakes can fast for weeks without really much harm so use that time to figure out what is causing the refusal (hides, temps, furniture, location of cage, disturbances, etc.) and keep trying.

Elbows, heart conditions and seizures are other breed specific threats to know about. Follow the basic giant puppy protocol for raising them that the Newfs also need. Delayed spay/neuter is like the other giants should be considered and it might be best to wait until their second or third year if possible so they finish growing.

Coat on a rough is less in length than a Newf. Smooths shed more often due to the short life cycle of the hairs despite less deep grooming or matting that the rough coat has to deal with. Other than that coat length and color are personal preferences.

Almost all Saints are bred to have immense flews that drool a lot. They are also getting very brachycephalic in many lines, especially show, and that leads to lots of snoring, wheezing, and overheating in hot weather or climates (some Newfs are getting to much like this too these days). Some Saints are so brachy they are getting wrinkles on their muzzle bridge and even a Boxer-like upturned muzzle. Also watch for very heavy boned parents, dogs that lumber and pound when they trot, as dogs like this will not be able to be as active and might be prone to early joint issues. This [dog](https://www.nbcsports.com/video/saint-bernard-2019-national-dog-show-working-group) has all the head issues mentioned, a good body, and while his movement is better than many I have watched, he still pounds a bit on his trot.

Temperament wise most state that Saints are a little more protective and watchful than Newfs and some more willful but that can also depend on the dog's own confidence and drive. Well bred Saints should be reliable, sociable, and stable, and beware or neurotic, aggressive, or shy parent dogs. Otherwise they are considered fairly similar in temperament to Newfs.

Some Pei and Chow show prey drive but I know of no East Asian spitz breeds that are used as hunters like say the Laikas, Hokkaido, Kishu, and Kai Inus are. Some European spitz breeds are herders and hunters. Anywho, that woman was a bit silly to try to make a Pei something it is not.

You can use a medium/large sewing needle or a pin.

If he eats the ointment he'll be fine and you can always reapply. If the abscess fluid is thick and chunky it might not drain without physical help (think pimples). Mice are tiny so you must be very careful and delicate. There are videos out there that show others lancing human and animal abscess for an idea of what is going on and how they are treated.

I have used them and the only issues I had was pushing bedding through the bars and the tubes getting gross (stuff gets stuck in the grooves).

To your main worry, it looks like a massive abscess on the rampage. Probably came from a scratch that got infected, and that's not uncommon. Tumors would not appear in 2-3 days but an abscess sure would. It needs to be drained and preferably one that big would need oral antibiotics given. Looks like it has affected the skin of his cheek and jaw (affecting his left eye) and his right shoulder and arm. It's a doozie."
PetMice,fcd5lzq,t1_fccx4kp,1577606646.0,"*Mastomys* is genetically closer to mice than rats, regardless of common nomenclature.

I have never kept them, and with their iffy reputation and inability to cross state lines by APHIS I have decided they are not worth it as pets or breeding projects to me. There are keepers of them on here and threads you can search for on them from our sub in the past. Just search ""natal, ASF, African Soft Furs"", etc on the sidebar."
PetMice,fcc7cu5,t1_fcc3yhd,1577595217.0,"Not a 'breed', as they are a completely different species (*Mastomys natalensis*) and not closely related to either Brown/fancy rats (*Rattus norvegicus*) or House/fancy mice (*Mus musculus*). Another common name for them is Natal rats/mice, from their species name."

It is truly is up to you if you feel he is the 'I will kill with dignity' type and don't mind letting them go as feeders, or if you'd rather they go out as pets only."
