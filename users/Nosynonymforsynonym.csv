yoga,femh98d,t1_femc9rc,1579255439.0,"My best advice is to start easy: don‚Äôt jump right into your long practices. The best thing right now as a beginner is to build yoga into a habit. It needs to become as everyday to you as brushing your teeth. 

At the very beginning, I would do five sun salutations every morning, just to get my body into a rhythm. Then build up from there. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre going to want to give up before the month is up: it‚Äôs going to feel like such a chore to come to the mat.  Remember, new habits are HARD. And that‚Äôs ok!

From there you can build up new skills. Don‚Äôt be like me and try to push yourself so hard that you feel dejected. A great thing in Yoga is learning to be thankful for where you are now, what you can do today, your body as it is. Your strength will grow slowly but soon you‚Äôll be impressed with just how far you‚Äôve come!"

I recommend metal infusers over those novelty silicone ones. I don‚Äôt find it influences the taste, but... they‚Äôre so much easier to clean! Metal ones last longer, too. Just make sure you get the mesh ones, not the ones that are just metal with holes drilled in - I find they don‚Äôt release as much flavor. 

People keep gifting me silicone ones, but I would rather display them than use them. I‚Äôve had the same tea ball infuser for a decade and it‚Äôs been impossible to beat!"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdq9pm2,t3_emlgof,1578660427.0,"Let me start by saying I'm in the same boat as you: 24 with a BF of five years. I'm echoing what everyone else here is saying - everyone has their own timeline. Think about the milestones you're proud of and cherish them! It's your life, and you shouldn't have to feel pressure to live by anyone else's rules. Not to mention we're SO YOUNG. Sometimes I feel like that song in Tangled, When will my life begin, but I remember all the exciting things I've done and still get to do and it makes me feel better.

Here's some WILD advice: move to a different country or culture. I'm bicultural (France/America) and only feel this pressure when I'm in the US! All my American cousins are married or engaged by now. Some have kids. All of them own their own houses. Heck, everyone in my family was married before they turned 22! My grandparents are ALWAYS bringing up how I should be getting married, and how much I'll loooove being a mother. Um, no, I'm busy.  

And then you have France. NONE of my HS friends are married, let alone have kids. NONE have their own house. Some still live with their parents. I have a great apartment, I'm studying for my PhD, I have a wonderful BF and love his family. Not ONCE have his parents asked when we're getting hitched.

So while my FB is flooded with my American friends living their timeline (and sometimes trying to make me feel bad about mine), and wedding dress advertisements and other bridal stuff ( I hate this target demographic thing)  the pressure abates as soon as I close the app. Social media is the worst.

You mentioned feeling isolated from not being in that same stage of life as your friends. That's the part that must suck the most.  My non-US friends are also working/studying/long term dating so I have people to turn to who relate to what I'm going through. Have you got any way of making new friends who have the same interests as you? change your social circle?

Or you can just turn to science: people who marry and have children later tend to be more successful. You'll probably be further ahead in your career, which means more family time, better pay, and of course more life experience. And you've gotten the opportunity to see what life has to offer before you get tied down with children. How much of your bucket list can be done with kids in tow? Personally, I've got a 'pre-family' list, and I won't tie the knot until I've done them all. And if my grandparents want great-grandbabies that much, they can pay for my trip to New Zealand themselves."
