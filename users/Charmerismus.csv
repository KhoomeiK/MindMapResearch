And just for perhaps some additional insight - it gives you the ability to do something like study intensely - it doesn't make you. It's similar to how steroids work when it comes to studying - it gives you greater potential during a study session (like a big workout) and then after that session you can go right into some other typically mundane task (like how steroids make you recover and able to work out again sooner). But just like steroids won't make a sedentary out of shape dude ripped, speed alone won't make a shitty student into a great one. It enables someone who cares about their grades to take a shortcut to get more out of studying. 

On average, a non ADD person taking adderall has a pretty massive advantage over a student who doesn't - but in any particular case it can effect different people differently and to varying degrees. For example, when I took this during college I became aggressively social to the point that I was less inclined to study while on it - but i was very inclined to clean - my room, my friend's room, pretty much anything. The drug completely removed the tedious nature and made it constantly incrementally rewarding as my target got ever so slightly more clean. 

You also tend to not notice time passing, so a 20 minute cleaning session could instead take 3 hours and you finish your entire house. A 20 minute studying session could go 3 hours before you even want a break. And since you're all wired and focused, these are a VERY productive 3 hours - not a 3 hours where you keep looking at your phone."
iamverysmart,felfzv6,t1_felc3ga,1579221288.0,it's people who don't have ADD that use adderall to study extra / more - people who do have it don't get that crazy productive speed high that people abuse the drug for

quityourbullshit,fdz5y1z,t1_fdxg30b,1578787053.0,"it's encouraging to hear that there are other places where different bullshit exists than the trump supporter bullshit, it feels omnipresent to me. 

I'm not sure if extreme progressivism really devolves into the misandry and racism I'm hearing about in the same way that authoritarianism and hyper conservatism trends towards racism and misogyny. Being extremely equal rights is not equivalent to being extremely racist / feeling as if some people deserve less rights. The most extreme 'progressive' voices i hear are radical feminists and it's hard to call misandry progressivism the same way you can logically extend racism to deprivation of rights. The point at which a progressive stops advocating progressive values they cease to be in the category you are assigning them to. A racist has no such issue, nor an authoritarian. The idea that you need to violate the very definition of progressivism in order to find an extreme example suggests to me a reason why I don't hear extreme progressivism much / ever. 

I like the idea of there being extreme progressivism out there as a counterbalance to authoritarian and conservative extremism we are faced with in everyday life. That's why I'm encouraged to hear it."

quityourbullshit,fdppojy,t1_fdplsqy,1578635838.0,"you write well and raise some good points but equating the hyper progressive to the trump partisan is distracting from the rest. all your arguments are sound but this jumps off the page as untrue and I think it's due to the frequency and penetration the trump partisan has compared to these 'screeching progressives' which I rarely / never come across. It's impossible to escape trumpist bullshit and it's very easy to never hear a 'screech' from a left wing anyone - at least in other parts of the country from where you're at.

the point you are raising about the parallel between partisans is completely valid but hard to stomach. An analogy would be if I explained something to you in a metaphor that likened a person to a child abuser. No matter how solid the reasoning the strong negative associations of 'trump' and 'child abuser' subsumes the argumentation."

I used to love the Sims and will always like it. The reason there aren't competitors is because The Sims is so unbelievably good + it's an incredibly niche game. 

To make a competitor to the sims you'd need to come up with a way to add something to the game that the Sims doesn't already do while also doing what the Sims already does to near perfection. Then on top of that there is the fact that everyone is so familiar with the 'sim city' and 'sim earth' and 'the sims' already that you'd need to somehow also break into that market and get known. 

Eventually someone may come up with a way to add a dimension to the sims that's so compelling that there will be competition. I'm not betting on soon and might not bet on ever, but competition in the market is the only thing that would make EA decide to collect less money."

As for what you said...

I think what you are trying to argue is that your point that 'size doesn't matter' still stands even if you concede everything that was said as some other non-legal argument?

If Supermac and Big Mac were not similar there wouldn't have even been an article, so declaring that confusing doesn't help the discussion much. I imagine most people in this thread immediately understood the gist of the lawsuit in one sentence. 

Lastly - of course it matters how big the company is. If a single location restaurant takes another single location restaurant to court very few people care. If one of the parties is one of the most famous restaurants in the world, you get the article. Our common frame of reference - knowing about Mcdonalds - is quite valuable. I understand wanting to protect the value of your brand. Somehow, at the same time I can understand a single owner continuing to run his same restaurant as he always has. It's strange to get this far into a discussion / thought experiment without addressing that the funny post that inspired our talk was by a TRUE competitor of Mcdonalds - Burger King.
