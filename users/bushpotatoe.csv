Pathfinder2e,fc3wwhx,t1_fc3w2h0,1577400724.0,"As I said before, they already fulfilled that role perfectly in the playtest, with the _massive_ buffs and the addition of a host of magical abilities, they ended up getting out far ahead of other classes damage output. They can do more damage, yes, but dealing outrageously more damage makes everyone else dealing damage feel worse, especially early game, and especially against anything with a hardness value above 8. Barbarians are incredibly accurate, super damaging, and also get decent saves. On top of that, the absolutely mitigal defense penalty is directly countered by their temporary hp and high class hit points. They have a host of feats that allow just as much build diversity as any class, since they have one of the higher feat counts, so saying they have less options is moot. I've played 2 full campaigns since release, and all the players in both campaigns noticed the barbarian performed a little too well early game.

Additionally, no one said that this is a problem, they're not so overpowered they break the game, however, they absolutely are overtuned compared to other classes, especially in combat, and especially early game when 1 shotting almost every monster is commonplace. Barbarians turn 3-4 round encounters into 1-3 rounds, since early game they one-hit kill most enemies their level with _only their damage modifier_. If your class does so much damage that you no longer have to rely on dice to kill things, that's not good, and a little overtuned."
Pathfinder2e,fc3veru,t1_fc3v98z,1577399621.0,"They don't have any less out of combat utility than fighters or monks, and yes, although barbarians are meant to do more damage, in this case they took it a little too far. Barbarians were dealing the most martial damage in the playtest, and that was before they quadrupled their rage damage for the full edition."
Pathfinder2e,fc3oipu,t1_fc3o7cq,1577394681.0,"Yes, just barbarians in general. There's some fights in game (such as construct fights, ESPECIALLY early game) that go from severe to trivial simply because of the presence of a barbarian. Monster hardness even seems designed to require a barbarian to overcome in some cases. They're not so violently overpowered that they turn other classes useless, however, every single group you play with will always point out that barbarians don't really die any more than any other class, but dish out significantly more damage, especially early game. Some instincts are less damagey than others, but not by much."
Pathfinder2e,fc3o3xf,t3_efzyw8,1577394381.0,"The only thing in game that could be considered overpowered at the moment are barbarians. They pretty much wipe the floor with everything else damage wise, and the defense penalty while raging is so miniscule it hardly makes a difference. I've completed two campaigns with barbarians, and they were by far the hardest to kill and they did the most damage for most of the game."

TwoXChromosomes,fbxqy97,t3_eezw0g,1577198044.0,"For the most part I've always found that to be a compelling plot point, especially considering that for many women, the inability to have kids is absolutely a curse. It doesn't paint women in a bad light, it brings to light a real life possibility and turns it into a compelling plot point. I've never considered it insulting or offensive to women, only a strong plot point that allowed me to empathize with that particular character about her problems.

Such as the case with the Witcher... both Yennefer _and_ Geralt are sterile, and it paints it negatively for both of them because each of those characters would have wanted children. This brings them together and gives them the strength they need to protect Ciri and form a strong parental bond with her. That ends up being the foundation for the entire plot up until the third game, and it was absolutely incredible. Just my thoughts."
