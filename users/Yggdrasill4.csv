CollapseSupport,ffad7yr,t3_esb1gq,1579732794.0,"Society doesn't invest in the future anymore, in fact it is taking money from the future in the form of debt. Not only debt in the form of fiat money, but debt owed to the environment that sustained us. The future generations cannot afford to pay back the debt. Every human would need to plant 1,000 trees a year to neutralize our carbon footprint. Carbon capturing technology is unfeasible as it takes more energy acquiring CO2 than the energy used that displace it into the atmosphere. Their is a 10-20 year delay lag on carbon's effect to the atmosphere, so essentially we are feeling the repercussions of early 2000's. Even if 100% of all carbon output stopped immediately, within weeks the dimming effect would cease and temperature rise will increase an additional 1c. Events like permafrost melt is happening 70 years earlier than expected, releasing methane that will only add to a ever increasing feedback loops. Even solar activity is increasing to a point were it might make an event to the magnetosphere \[I suggest Suspicious0bservers' youtube channel for more information\]. A lot of bad things will happen simultaneously at a certain point in a geometric scale. At this point it would take a miracle like fusion energy to begin having hope again, but that is like winning the lotto when you know several months from now you will go bankrupt because you cannot afford the payments to the environment."

2. That is reckless as one mistake and baby gets lifelong brain damaged for a little bit of laughter.
3. That is not hope, that is a habit for something so common, that people sleep and wake up. From all the days you have woken up, worrying about dying in one of them is superfluous.
4. We plan because we need to survive. We don't have zero knowledge of the future, we work with patterns, it is not %100 pure chaos.
5. That is not love, that is bringing your child into the suffering that you see in this world. We seek companionship because we want to alleviate our own suffering by not going through it alone. Why place the burden on another being not of your own consciousness?
6. The old man may say that, but the morphological degradation from all those years will certainly prevent him from acting like a teen. Those 64 years of experience will overshadow what a true 16 year old teen would feel, which is the freshness and novelty of new experiences. Conversely, I can say I am a 3 year old with 24 years of experience. Nonsense attitude, accept your age even if you act like a teen, and I act like a toddler."

They have the best chance of surviving a year to five years, maybe even more. All we can do is stockpile on food that will last a year with a continuation of rotation to avoid spoil before their is a collapse. Rotate water as well, it is more expensive, but essentially a crate of glassed water will hold up, I have about half a crate of glassed water ""Selters"" that I rotate. Water in plastic bottles with bpa or bpa-s will eventually leak into the water causing undrinkable contamination. You need a lot of self defense, maybe even body armor, which is very costly, and plenty of guns and even a hidden combat knife for close encounters. You need to have a means to carry your supply if things become so dire you cannot stay in one location, but this means abandoning most of your food supply. If you live near people, you can expect them to become desperate enough to kill, and their wont be anything to enforce law and order. Maybe the Military, but they will most likely round up people like cattle for transportation into a camp of some sort, and not everyone either.

It's just a word to them, an abstract thing they know happens some time in the future of their lives. When they experience it first hand, or directly witness it happening to others, then they become more aware and try to live 'the best life they can'. Running away from death through life's novelties, because they now have a lingering deep fear of the great unimaginable despair that is the end of their existence. Like children, an adult's conscious perspective is incredibly limited. Billions of different lives on Earth and they can only grasp a handful. They cannot understand how a lifelong blind person lives their life because they themselves never experienced being blind all their life, let alone experienced the death process."
2meirl4meirl,fedg90u,t1_fed2h7u,1579010702.0,That is still not nightmare mode. My fellow higher dimensional bros on the other side bragged about playing through nightmare mode several times without quitting their game.
2meirl4meirl,fedfbg7,t1_fecz7oc,1579009964.0,"I always selected girl and easy mode in the menu selection interface, but my fellow higher dimensional beings kept on nagging me to try a different challenge for once. Told me about how they played on nightmare mode before. Being me, I caved and selected boy in expert mode. I'm almost ready to just quit game. I'm going to kick their asses when I'm finish with this playthrough, they are probably laughing their ass off seeing me getting my ass kicked in this game."
AJelqForYou,fed7yp2,t1_fed7i5m,1579003029.0,"Sorry man, I've been going through similar issues about this too, which has lead me to feel dehumanized and suicidal in utter ruin. I was just trying to gain perspective from the optimism of comments by telling them the reality."
smallpenisproblems,fed7qkp,t3_en656r,1579002765.0,"That shit only works when you are 40+ years old looking into relationships that doesn't have sex as a be all end all. At that age, your youth and most of your sexual energy decreases substantially were it would feel ok to have less sex in a relationship. Thing is, those people already filled their cup in the past. How can someone, who didn't get that opportunity to experience that level of intimacy in the past, move on."
SuicideWatch,feccgnh,t1_fecaopz,1578970701.0,"After experiencing that crap several times, we eventually just get jaded about relationships. I can't devote so much of my hopes and emotions into something so unstable. So what is left for us? We defensively care less about relationships, so we never devote long term commitment while in one. Being broken in a twisted world is too much to bare."
SuicideWatch,fec771u,t1_fec5obh,1578967828.0,"I hate that shit. Just like you, my girl was anxious that I might leaver her, she would cling to me. She talked about promises of being together forever and having a baby. She left for another guy like it was second nature and told me that she was just playing with me and never took me seriously. Eventually the guy left her, and she is yet with another guy. Now everyday for nearly a year now, I still carry this sinking heart feeling. I think some people come to this world to not experience relationships, and no matter how hard they try, relationships always evaporates. Then you have others that don't even put effort into finding relationships, yet hundreds of options come to them. It's a twisted world."
SuicideWatch,fec5dnr,t3_eo97qt,1578966901.0,"Do you want to talk about it? I've went through that too. Girlfriend lied about her love towards me, made me believe in her love, so I fell in love. She was just playing with me, for nearly a year."
antinatalism,feb2u74,t3_eo53pk,1578954949.0,"The death process alone makes living not worth it. You develop consciousness, experience existence, then you have to give that away. It's an existential dread so profound it is beyond description. I've been close to death and the fear alone from the void is beyond any pleasures on Earth."
