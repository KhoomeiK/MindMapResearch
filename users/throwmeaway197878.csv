insomnia,ffdne7j,t3_et1476,1579824577.0,"I used to nap a lot because I was so tired from lifelong insomnia. I had IBS and was in a lot of pain as well as had anxiety from PTSD. 

My ""naps"" were me passing out for like one hour after sleeping zero hours at night. 

Trying to sleep enough and sleep on a schedule has taken away my ability to take naps. I benefitted professionally from sleeping on a schedule but I'm struggling with nighttime sleep as well now.

When you were napping, were you sleep deprived from not sleeping at night?"
insomnia,ffdmsll,t3_esy2qt,1579824213.0,"I'm really struggling right now too. The thing that keeps me going are the series of good days that I have. I think of how good those days are and how I'd certainly not want to give up having experienced those.

It's tough. I haven't been suicidal. But I have had days of hopelessness.

Let others know what's going on with you. Keep experimenting. Keep trying new doctors. (I had to go through a series of doctors before I found my current doctor who I like; she's a trouble-shooter and will give me what I need while she's working on identifying root problems. Pretty sure it's hormonal at this point.)"
acne,ffbacce,t1_ff9m0o2,1579757245.0,"Exactly my thoughts. Not only is she beautiful to begin with, she's got some serious skills. They're just jelly."
acne,ff5fkji,t1_ff5feof,1579590693.0,"Yes, and I've worked with a therapist and a psychiatrist. Personally, I've noticed that the issue is more nutritional for me. If I don't take magnesium supplements, I can feel my thoughts starting to race more. So I've been approaching the problem as 1) what I need to do as far as supplements and 2) what coping mechanisms do I need. 

It doesn't matter how much CBT you do if your brain is missing something. Some people are totally unable to switch off their brain to sleep because something is happening/ not happening chemically."
acne,ff5f7gh,t1_ff5etv0,1579590258.0,"Thanks. I've realized that I most likely have an anxiety disorder. (I was already diagnosed with PTSD.) I've recognized that I get anxious about everything. If it's not my skin, it's something else. So I need to target that first. I'm working on taking supplements to address deficiencies. Magnesium and GABA help with the obsessive thoughts, and I'm taking other things for the inflammation.

 I'm struggling with insomnia right now. I had an intrusive thought come into my head after I slept for an hour and then woke up. Hopefully, I can get back to sleep. Right now, I'm just focused on controlling my thoughts. 

But I definitely feel you on the self-forgiveness aspect. I need to work on taking it easier on myself."
acne,ff51zhk,t1_ff50pm3,1579578053.0,"Thanks for your response. Yeah, I'm struggling with stress right now from problems with insomnia and decreased income and feeling kind of helpless with all of this combined. 

How exactly did you change your mindset?"
acne,ff4ptxc,t1_ff08o47,1579569541.0,I think there's a time and place for each approach. I'm definitely for holistic for mild issues but sometimes you gotta bring out the big guns for more severe/persistent cases.

AskReddit,felbwyw,t1_felazqi,1579218566.0,"Hell, yeah. I love teaching and I get really involved. I love seeing them work hard and I tried to model some techniques for them to learn how to better motivate themselves. I hated seeing some of them waste student loan money on courses and not put in any effort. But I focused my energy on the students who really tried. 

I know how frustrating it can be when you're lost in a system and struggling, so I made sure I was there for my students as an advocate. As the instructor, I had the ability to take a few extra steps and take care of problems that the students would have had a much more difficult time solving. Our university class system would automatically kick financial aid students out of courses at the beginning of the semester so I'd be on the phone for hours getting tech support to put them back on the enrollment list. I gave one student my personal number to text me whenever she got kicked out of the system (pretty much every other day). Of course, this is frowned upon by teachers who are all about being inaccessible when not in the classroom, but I don't care. It doesn't take much of my time, and I've never seen students abuse their ability to communicate with me easily when I gave them this option.

I had to hunt down one head professor at one point because he went on vacation and didn't leave anybody with access to another system when students got kicked out there. And there are always students who will start writing about mental health crises if you give them a writing prompt, so I tried to encourage those students to seek mental health support.

Basically, I have no qualms about coming across a hardass. I fully support my students as long as long as they're trying. And I will cut a bitch in the university system if your lazy ass hinders my student's progress."
AskReddit,felawwb,t1_fekv5gr,1579217904.0,I feel you. I've documented and reported things to Child Protective Services before. A lot of people think that showing proof of some major issues will cause automatic action. Nope. CPS don't care.

datingoverthirty,fe3cjj8,t1_fe2o4i6,1578848032.0,"I typically prefer to meet guys in person, so I'll go to group hangouts and social events and see which dudes I click with and then go out with them on a date afterwards. One guy got my number for a date and then started texting me DURING the mixer event  while we were still both there. I could see him."
AskReddit,fdzygl2,t1_fdzcibp,1578798870.0,Agree
datingoverthirty,fdzxodb,t1_fdzx4a5,1578798323.0,"I think it's different for each person though. I never understood the advice to refrain from texting because you'll run out of things to talk about. I'm the kind of person who gets into random conversations with strangers and end up talking to them for four hours about their experiences in the Vietnam War. 

For me, I have found that someone who's a good conversationalist in text is always a good conversationalist in person. But I know that making conversation in person is a strength of mine, and so it comes down to what I value specifically. I need someone who is a good texter too. After dating dudes of different text-ability levels, I found that that's a big deal for me. I feel stifled if I can't talk with someone a lot (both in person and via text), and I really jive with guys who are very communicative and love to converse a lot too. I have tried dating guys who didn't text much, and I wasn't really feeling it."
Ebay,fdxrzyl,t1_fdw4pyq,1578772316.0,I agree. This is what they often do to try to get some money back while keeping the item. They'll come up with some mysterious thing that they don't like about the item; yet it's somehow not bad enough to return the item.

Side note back to you: don't you get annoying people especially trying to get after you about the Gideon Bibles? ""They're supposed to be freeeee!"" 

Well, yeah. With stuff like that, you're not really paying the seller for the item but the convenience of having the items available to obtain and for having the items sent to you. 

Same with free samples. I don't care if people resell them if I want them and now have access to something I couldn't normally get."

I dont know why but there are some really weird guys on there. I joined a lot of professional networking groups and would constantly have weirdos messaging me (somehow even a dude in a Girls' Night Out group). I say weirdos because nowhere else have I had a marriage proposal sent via PM from a profile with an avatar and had the dude get huffy that I wasn't interested apparently because I was against interracial relationships.  Wat?"
Ebay,fdrtweq,t1_fdrtdsv,1578689595.0,"Lots of libraries around here have bins with free Bibles (in the Bible Belt). Regardless, it's the shop's decision whether or not they offer free Bibles--not his choice."

I had a crappy roommate try to keep my deposit and I had to threaten to report her to the government for a scam she was trying to run to get her to pay the deposit back.

People like her ask for a security deposit just to have extra money. She's not legitimately holding on to it to see if you clean the room when you're done."

Accutane,fdmh39d,t1_fdmgsyo,1578549680.0,Thank you so much.  It's been a struggle. I can take comfort from the fact that searching for a solution to my skin led me on a long journey to search for a magic cure and to address other health problem. I feel proud of myself for the things I have done while I am certainly frustrated and upset at the things I have missed out on. I'm taking me time this year to focus on dealing with this. It's been a long time coming.

SkincareAddiction,fdmbap7,t1_fdmag0t,1578544561.0,"My first major problem was chest acne which left open gaping sores in my breasts that turned into a staph infection. I was abused as a child and in a lot of pain with other health problems so I seriously checked out mentally from a lot of stuff if you're wondering why I didn't do anything about it. The chest acne healed up at 19. 

Yes, I did Differin first in my late teens for mild chin acne. The dermatologist told me to put that all over my face for some seborrheic dermatitis on my forehead. (I don't know if I misunderstood him.) All of my skin peeled off and I used cocoa butter to moisturize. Everybody said my skin looked great but I was really depressed due to chronic pain from IBS which I have dealt with successfully.

In my early 20s, I tried Differin again but it didn't work for me. I feel like my acne started changing in structure. I was living in Korea at this point and started going to weekly laser sessions for scars and esthetic treatments. These just made my acne worse.

I tried Spiranolactane in my early 20s as well and this just caused non-stop bleeding. I've always been super regular with my period, so this was abnormal. 

In my mid 20s, I was traveling in Europe and started getting bad cysts on my neck after catching some type of sickness. This persisted for about a year. 

The neck acne then came back about three years later and has persisted since.

At this point, my acne is getting worse and worse. I would guess that the problem is a bacterial one more than a hormonal one but I didn't see any differences in the past with being on courses of antibiotics for various things (like with the skin infection on my chest).

The one positive I have is that my skin heals quickly and I have never had a pitted scar (only PIH). I just have a lot of swollen redness to deal with now and am getting to the point where I can't manage this myself."

I left all my belongings in my room for two weeks after I told her I'd move. (I moved out halfway through an already-paid month and let her keep the month's-worth security deposit as I knew she'd never be able to pay me this back.)

insomnia,fd4xtv8,t1_fd4tis2,1578172168.0,"Yeah, Klonopin absolutely helped me but it was tough being reliant on it and not having definite access. I never had any withdrawal issues from benzodiazepines--even at high doses and for long periods of time. I would just end up back at square one with the original insomnia.

What has helped me with anxiety is taking l theanine and magnesium citrate. Also, I have stopped drinking entirely and have increased my sodium levels. (I never was much of a drinker but even a tiny bit of alcohol was starting to affect me as I started feeling anxious if I felt the slightest bit dehydrated.) My blood pressure is also on the low side and tends to tank so I know I need to focus on getting electrolytes.

While everyone has a different reason for insomnia, I think it is worth it to try troubleshoot the underlying reason. And absolutely get what medication works for you in the meantime so you can sleep. I compare my insomnia to severe digestive issues I used to have that I have mostly managed to conquer. Doctors would get after me for frequent laxative use while not figuring out why I couldn't go to the bathroom. The laxatives were overkill but they were necessary and I'm glad I used them as I did to be able to go #2 while I solved my digestive problems. Nowadays, I pretty much never need laxatives. I remind myself that I solved a problem as severe and that I will eventually solve my insomnia as well.

I would suggest running a blood panel and seeing what you're missing so you have a rough idea of where to start. For example, are you low on magnesium, sodium, etc? WebMD the shit out of your symptoms; forget the bias against this; it's good to have an idea of what's going on so you can be your best advocate during meetings with healthcare professionals. I would also suggest finding a healthcare professional who is open to experimenting and guide you through this. I've had way too many doctors try to diagnose me on sight and get pissed when I didn't ""respect their expertise."" You want someone who can work with you to figure out what works for you."

insomnia,fd4i0um,t3_ek0wa9,1578167662.0,"Yeah, I do but I pee a lot to begin with. Anxiety makes it worse so I have focused on dealing with the anxiety primarily."
insomnia,fd4ht67,t3_ejw55k,1578167591.0,"Why not focus on solutions or troubleshooting? If there's a kid who is freaking out, I don't care if they want some suggestions.

For me, this sub has been helpful for griping about people who are dismissive about insomnia and for receiving suggestions. For me, as a teenager and young adult who had severe insomnia and just lived with it, that was no life. I'm doing so much better although I'm still struggling. I'm dedicated to doing better. This sub and my insomnia friends have been a good support group for discussing problems I've had with people's reactions to my insomnia and for suggesting medications to bring up with my healthcare providers when most of my healthcare providers wouldn't mention these on their own."

But if I tell you that I haven't slept and don't feel comfortable driving, don't ducking compete with me, Pamela. Accept my explanation and let it be."
datingoverthirty,fcwfbyh,t1_fcvpxsy,1578024171.0,"Yeah, I met a guy who was attractive but extraordinarily boring, and I couldn't figure it out since I find most people to be interesting and love hearing about their lives. I realized it was his lack of wanting to talk about or learn about anything other than his two hobbies. He just wanted to talk at someone and would zone out if the conversation changed slightly to something he didn't like and know about fully. Now THAT is boring."
funny,fcvq7y2,t1_fcu88hh,1578007635.0,"I feel so proud of myself that I'm getting good at distinguishing between a Kiwi and Aussie accent. The moment he says ""yiss"" for ""yes.""

For those who know enough of all four accents, is the difference between a Kiwi and an Aussie accent greater than the difference between a fairly standard US accent and a Canadian one? As an American with a pretty generic US accent, I can't pick up on Canadian accents right away unless it's really rural Canadians."
AdviceAnimals,fctfbbb,t1_fctf6c3,1577941436.0,"Oh, okay. So yeah, I guess it has been pretty common in the US over the years"
AdviceAnimals,fctezhc,t1_fcteshr,1577941134.0,I think it's kinda hard to prove and I did grow up around the Francophone ex-pat community since my mom speaks French. Every get together had charcuterie. That might be the common denominator more.
AdviceAnimals,fctefej,t1_fctd8yd,1577940632.0,Georgia and I've been aware of charcuterie most of my life (in my 30s).
badroommates,fctd79o,t1_fctcw5m,1577939566.0,"Yeah, it's been three days so far of absolute non-functioning toilet and off-and-on before then. The maintenance guy has been trying a lot of different things and has determined that there might be air or something down in the pipes. At one point, some black sludge started coming up that looked like rust flakes in brackish water so I don't know if there's rust in the pipes.

His plan of action now is to remove the toilet and check down into the pipe. But it's three days of peeing in a bucket and IBS pooping at Dunkin Donuts and I'm paying a pretty penny to live here so I'm not sure how much longer of this I can take."
