polyadvice,fen9u2q,t1_femn45e,1579280099.0,"I feel like polyamory only sounds like a good idea to people until they clue in that it means their partner would also be sleeping with other people too. Sharing those tender moments you hold dear with someone else while not even thinking of you, having sex, literally watching your S/o build up a whole relationship with someone else. Of course there is going to be jealousy, it’s going to hurt, probably feel depressed sometimes. So the fix is the forget about the pain by sleeping with someone else and having those “honeymoon” feelings to ignore the hurt. People say polyamory helps their partner be “free” or whatever the stupid reason is but how good of a relationship can you build with someone when you aren’t the main focus because they have however many partners on the side? The jealousy must only go away when you stop caring. What a horrible way to have a relationship with someone. If that’s what you want then be single and see people. Don’t date multiple?! What if you’re (random names for example) what Chris thinks is his “main” partner, but you actually feel that way about one of your partners Jason? Honestly sorry but these relationships are so disgustingly unhealthy and I have seen them for myself this ISNT an empty opinion. They fail literally every single time but they don’t even realize it because they have backup partners so who cares if you lose one am-I-right? Everyone always acts like they’re so “modern” and happy but then I would always get messages at ridiculously late times from friends in these relationships about how hurt they really are. OP said he had been with his partner for TWO MONTHS! When he posted this! What ! The! Hell! Poly is selfish and you won’t change my mind."

It requires surgery and is very painful and it will never go away. I suggest doing some research. And yes, if I’m having bad cramps or something I tell my partner and usually he HELPS ME and makes me feel better. 

Also you aren’t married, it’s her money, it’s her animal that she loves, why do you care? Are you jealous of the attention she is giving towards the cat? Or is it because your mentality is “it’s just a cat” so you expect her to feel the same? People love their pets and as you mentioned before this cat was a stray, she’s trying to help him. 

You seriously lack empathy. The cat and money thing sucks but the lack of regard towards her health is mind boggling. You clearly have a focus on you and you alone so you can’t begin to understand why she cares about a cat, and thinks she uses illness as an excuse. 

Chances are she genuinely can’t have children, it’s not just something she’s “saying”. Not going to lie, I kind of hope she breaks up with you.

I do think McCain is more democratic than republican, but that’s the bad thing about only having two major political parties, you have to choose one or the other. I personally would fall right in the middle, as I agree and also disagree with things on both sides. Enough so that I would have a hard time as an American and having to choose one.

I’ll be honest with you when I say that the protests happening in your country have hardly even been covered over here. A lot of people didn’t know that was happening until Soleimani was killed, and now people need reasons for arguing why they’re for or against what trump did. 

Personally, I think Soleimani was not at all a good person. Both governments are corrupt in their own ways, but governments killing their own civilians will obviously always be a bad thing. My whole issue with it is that it seems to have been handled poorly by America, assassinating someone that isn’t just a “terrorist” but also a high ranking official and member of government. Trump didn’t even try to get approval from congress he just went and did it. 

People in the US are really really divided on this topic (and I’m sure Iranians are too), so I think that’s why this sub is seeing an influx of foreign people coming here, like me. I just want to get perspective, and coming straight to the source (this sub) seems like one of the easier ways to get that. Talking to the citizens is much more trustworthy than any government or news source."
iran,fdky1fk,t1_fdgd3y0,1578513505.0,"You seem to be so blind about “ah terrorist dead!” That you can’t see the bigger picture here. As previously mentioned it’s always the US starting these wars then claiming their citizens have to go “fight for their country”. 

Yes Soleimani killed Iranians and was not a good man. But he wasn’t just a terrorist he was a huge political figure in that country. What if another country killed the American Vice President because they’re locking up innocent people crossing the border? The good ol US of A is not that perfect. 

Iranians want peace and have been protesting the streets, risking their lives to get the rights they deserve. Let’s not make things worse for them by bombing the fuck out of them?

I feel like a lot of people who support this don’t understand the reality of war, which is crazy considering the amount of war and conflict the US has seen. The only reason that America has been safe from air raids and invasions is just because there is a nice big ocean separating them from most of the people they are fighting. Well technology has advanced like you wouldn’t believe, and if someone really really wanted to, they could hit the US hard. 

War is hell and I don’t wish it on anyone. I don’t care if they had a terrorist in government. That doesn’t mean innocent men women and children should be used as a ploy. 

I’m sick of old men sending the youth of their country to die for wars they didn’t start."
iran,fdkvzg3,t1_fdkqekk,1578512298.0,"The impeachment thing is a whole mess that I don’t really understand. Basically what was explained to me is that they have determined trump is considered “guilty”, but there is still a process to actually remove him as president- almost like a sentencing where they say if you go to jail or not. I don’t really know, it’s super confusing lol. 

I think it is still important to not label everyone as democrat only and republican only, because as you’ve mentioned even though someone may identify with that party that does not mean they will all agree on the same thing. 

Most Trump supporters are republican however and most people who do not agree are democrat.  That’s part of the reason I think the “RINO” term is so weird for trump to say, especially in a country where freedom of speech and views are something they take so much pride in. 

You can’t blame one party or the other for whatever is right or wrong with America as they have both heavily contributed to what the country is today."

We see it happening in the United States as well, although not as extreme, most propaganda is Republicans vs. Democrats where both sides will share false information in order to get more people on their side. Two major news sources in the US are Fox News (republican) and CNN (Democrat) and both of them are pretty untrustworthy. Also lots of fake articles and stuff like that shared on Facebook. Some people literally see Trump as a god and the saviour of America and will follow him regardless of the things he says and does, whereas some people think Trump is the same as Hitler lol. Even if he does something good they hate him. I personally am glad I’m not in the US because either way I don’t feel like I fall under either category, more so “I’m between” with a lot of my views."
iran,fdkq9rr,t1_fdkkcr1,1578508907.0,"This is interesting. 

I wouldn’t say republicans are more peaceful than democrats in the US, both governments are responsible for starting war. Violence can also be seen at protests when right and left people clash heavily, as both groups have members with more “extreme” views than the average folk. I do understand however how Iran would be more pro-republican, a lot of the same views are shared. 

Many many people agree with what trump did, but many also are totally appalled so it’s pretty even on both sides in the US. Republicans are cheering for it, saying that trump killed a terrorist and is protecting America. A lot of Republicans actually seem to WANT the war, whereas majority of Democrats don’t (I’m more so referring to civilians here than actual members of the parties). Democrats believe he acted foolishly and is trying to start a war for the sake of it. Which, considering statements trump has made in the past (used to claim Obama would invade Iran to win re-election), it’s making people think Trump is desperate to stay in office now that he has been impeached and Iran was an easy target. Basically the country is super divided 

As for the nuclear deals between US and Iran I can’t give you too much information on that. I haven’t seen many Americans bring that up, most conversation now is geared towards either the attack on the embassy or the death of Soleimani when it comes to what actually has started all of this. However I know Iran and the US have had conflicts for a while. 

I’m sincerely hoping that no war will come of any of this, however I won’t make any promises. I feel like Trump can be rather unpredictable and I know Iran is angry. I guess only time will tell

Obviously I don’t hate gay people, and I don’t hate women, I am one. 

A lot of right wing people say that Trump’s assassination of Soleimani is a great thing because of how he has treated the people of Iran. I agree that Soleimani was a horrible man, but he was also a high ranking political figure of Iran. Trump had no approval from Congress, is bragging about his “military might” and has threatened to target cultural areas of Iran which is a war crime. His intention may have been good but the way that the situation was handled is absolutely horrible and the results can be catastrophic for many innocent people. 

The US neglects the poor of their country and you can’t deny that. They also neglect the sick, unless you’re willing to pay. The difference between the wealthy and the poor is absolutely staggering, racism is still prominent, kids get shot at school, people in power abuse that power.  The country is growing more and more divided by the day, with extreme right wing and left wing propaganda everywhere. They are locking up children at the border who are following their parents for a new life, coming to the country for safe-haven, only to be rejected, mistreated and locked away. By all means, I know Americans are (generally) accepting of LGBT people and women have equal rights. But there is A LOT of shit that is not so “great” about the US, and I don’t know why so many people refuse to talk about it. 

Why should a country, with a large population struggling to eat or get their medication, follow a moron who tweets about committing war crimes into a war he so desperately wants to start because he was too trigger happy? 

And yes I know about what happened at the US Embassy in Iran. But that doesn’t mean that things couldn’t have been handled in an, I don’t know, lets-try-not-to-start-a-war type of way? 

I’m Canadian and I love my neighbours to the south. But my own country has many issues of its own too, the difference is that we actively talk about those problems, and try to change them. We love our country dearly and we take great pride in it. Part of how we got here was realizing our wrongs. Put aside your pride for a moment and truly ask yourself, what is wrong with my country? Because no matter where you are, nothing is perfect. 

Iran has a lot of work to do to be on-par with the rest of the world. My heart breaks for Iran and seeing many of their people suffer. Let’s not make it worse by killing them, maybe? There is a better way to handle things than instantly jumping to weapons. I don’t want to see history repeat itself. 

Probably the grossest tweet I saw was someone calling on their fellow Americans to bomb Iran like they did Dresden. Disgusting."

They are used to hearing the numbers, not seeing the lives first hand that were lost. Not understanding the fear and isolation, like this little girl was feeling. People in the US should be afraid though- technology has changed drastically since the last world war, and they are now very very vulnerable. It seems like many people are supporting war for the sake of war, which is extremely dangerous.

offmychest,fddkvpg,t1_fddeft7,1578316182.0,"War is real to many Americans. The US fought in both the world wars, and were a huge help amongst the allies in defeating the Nazis. They also are familiar with war in the Middle East, which many do not support, although some do. People in the US still lose family members that serve on a regular basis. The difference between the US and other European or middle eastern countries is that many civilians do not witness or live through the war for the sole reason of where they are located geographically. Otherwise they would have also been invaded during the world wars and would experience more combat on US soil with who they’re fighting in the Middle East. It’s unfair to assume that US doesn’t know war, when any veteran can tell you otherwise. 

Also I’m not from the US I’m Canadian. I agree Canada and our neighbours have been very lucky not to have gone through what others have, but with how far technology has advanced it is a real possibility now and I think that’s adding to people’s fear.

WhitePeopleTwitter,fd42y12,t3_ejz6j9,1578163886.0,"I really wish more people would start piecing that together, but for anyone who isn’t aware of the history, a brief run down into the beginning of WW1:

Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary. In June of 1914, he and his wife Sophie were assassinated by a member of Young Bosnia, a group of mostly young school-age men who were pro the unification of territories including Bosnia into Yugoslavia and members who promoted Serbian nationalist aims of unification into Serbia. They assassinated the Ferdinands in Sarajevo with the help of the Black Hand, a secret military society formed by officers of the Serbian Army, that provided them with weapons. This quickly lead to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia, and by August of 1914, that same year, the world was at war. 
The assassination was not the sole reason the war began, but it is exactly what “got the ball rolling” so to say. 


The assassination of Qasem Soleimani is all too similar to this. Although different in execution, the message is the same, as Soleimani is seen as one of the most powerful figures of the Islamic Republic, with thousands attending his funeral to mourn his death. This isn’t just the elimination of a terrorist, this is politically extremely important for the world to pay attention too, since for obvious reasons Iran is PISSED. Lets not forget that Iran is allies with two of the most powerful countries in the world, Russia and China. This could very easily trickle its way down into another world war, if people are not careful enough to ensure history is not repeated. However day by day, history is repeating itself, so please educate yourself on the events of both the world wars as the only way to prevent the same things from happening is to be knowledgeable of the past and the affects it had on the world. 


Perhaps the worst of it all however is how president Trump, before his election and while Obama was still in office, kept predicting that Obama would invade Iran in order to win re-election. I guess he decided to save that trick for himself : https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/01/03/before-qasem-soleimani-killing-trump-warned-of-iran-war-by-obama.html

I’m living next to crack dealers and my other neighbours had a gun pulled on them yesterday outside our building. Can’t afford to move though, so have to deal with it for now. And I don’t even live in a very big city."
AskReddit,fculydr,t1_fcug2n6,1577983882.0,"Cost of living in Ontario is outrageous. Don’t even think about moving to Toronto. Drugs have become a huge problem in a lot of cities and crime rates have increased. The government is pretty horrible to the indigenous communities. I’m from Saskatchewan originally and it is so painfully boring out there and the winters are horrible (my parents got married in December and it was -50°C outside). Lots or racial tension with indigenous communities out west too that you don’t really hear about. The 401 is also absolute hell and of course our winters are very rough. Also you’ll see a lot of people complaining about immigrants. 

I can’t bash my country too much though. Canada is beautiful, with many sights to see. From the mountains of BC and Alberta to the plains of the prairies, the east coast to the great white north (although mostly inhabitable) Canada is without a doubt one of the most geographically beautiful countries. Places like Quebec City still have a lot of buildings standing from when people first settled there and it feels like walking through villages in Europe, but then we have such modern places like Toronto. Most Canadians are generally peaceful, hardworking people but there are still some that abuse the system and take advantage. However, Canadians are always looking out for eachother. When the Humboldt Broncos bus crash happened (bus full of hockey players was hit by a 18 wheeler) the entire country practically stopped to mourn them and support. Our healthcare system is absolutely fantastic, and if you’re struggling there are usually resources there to help you. Canadians are very accepting of people and we are very liberal in a lot of our views. Canadians are proud and strong people. My mom always said that being born in Canada was like winning the lottery, and I believe that to be true."

relationship_advice,fcufmoo,t3_eiyhsn,1577979800.0,"You endured extreme mental and financial abuse. I’m glad her friends have started to see her for what she is too, and they don’t even know about half the stuff she put you through. No wonder you have been so stressed. OP, when you start dating again, I hope you put yourself first next time. Relationships shouldn’t be continuous sacrifice of your happiness and needs for someone who does not do the same. Maintain your individuality and do not think you have to prove you are worthy to anyone. The right person for you will love every aspect of you regardless of your weight or whatever other thing you don’t see of yourself as adequate. Don’t let someone else become the centre of your universe, instead wait until you find someone to walk the journey with you, not have you walk it for them while they sit on your shoulders. You sound like you have a good heart and I’m sorry that she took advantage of that. I highly recommend therapy, I don’t want you to second guess every other person because of what you experienced here. You handled this with grace and you were not at all too harsh. Surround yourself with the right people who love you. I am proud of you  OP keep your chin up."
AmItheAsshole,fcucu3q,t3_eiyrxo,1577977973.0,"NTA. you did something that I think takes a lot of courage, and that is standing up to your family. No one can manipulate and berate quite like your own family, and telling them when enough is enough is quite difficult. They were taking advantage of your contributions to their happiness and didn’t recognize your efforts at all. Instead they ignored them and brought up something that is, literally, no ones business but you and your husbands. You are more than the children you can or can’t provide, and if that is all your family wants to think about, then fuck em. I’m glad you have a supportive husband you can lean on. Keep your chin up OP, nothing feels worse than being bullied by family."

It almost feels like OP is kind of being targeted for no reason? Like someone being arrested for jaywalking. Does it break the law? Technically yes, but do millions of people do it every single day without issue? Yep. There’s bigger fish to fry than a photoshopped staple"
mildlyinteresting,fcr3mtu,t1_fcqx2pt,1577896305.0,Someone above said it counted as OC as they fixed the mistake in the original photograph. Expecting to never see reposts or unoriginal content is unrealistic
mildlyinteresting,fcqt1o4,t1_fcqqcus,1577891766.0,"Why are we giving OP a hard time here? I see things posted all over reddit from multiple different sources, and things being reposted on a regular basis. OP photoshopped the original photo to fix the annoying staple that was out of place, I noticed it right away and gave an upvote. OP may not have taken the original picture but fixed the thing bothering everyone, so I’m failing to see the issue other than making a big deal out of nothing."
