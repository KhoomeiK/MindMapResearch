AskReddit,ff7uysp,t3_es2wnl,1579658980.0,"I’m an American that enjoys traveling internationally. Getting my American friends to travel with me is like pulling teeth because of their work situation or a lack of knowledge/comfort with traveling. I’ve listed the most common reasons I’ve heard below. 

Vacation time is probably the most limiting factor. Taking a week off in the States can be difficult. On top of that, a week is not enough time to appreciate another country. Especially when factoring in travel days. 

Americans generally do not travel with small children as often as Europeans or Asian tourists. 

Partially related to above, American are generally not comfortable with traveling to places without English speakers readily available. 

A majority of Americans will not travel to place if it’s had any bad news in recent memory/news cycle. 

Americans think international travel is more expensive than it really is. This is due to higher price of domestic flights in the US that we have grown accustomed to.  From personal experience a flight from DC to TN (700 mi) costs the same or less as a flight from DC to Bangkok (8500 mi)."

ThailandTourism,fciloop,t1_fcidrw9,1577664654.0,"Each island had its own vibe. Koh Tao was was probably my favorite as it had a good mix of developed areas and easy access to more secluded beaches/excursions off shore. If you wanna scuba, do Koh Tao. Koh Samui was nice too for the same reasons, but Koh Tao felt more like you were on an island in the middle of nowhere. Koh samui also had more “local” feel in some areas and had the best food options. 

Koh Pha-ngan beaches were not as great. Mae Haad was really course and basically ran by a resort so the food options were limited (resort restaurant/overly expensive). We also visited Haad Rin for the full moon party on Christmas. It was super dirty and painfully obvious the entire area focused on the party aspect only. Every store sold full moon merch and/or buckets of cheap liquor. That would of been cool and all but the party was lame af. There were only a few bars that had a crowd, and those crowds were heavily male. Also, tourists can be shitty so I saw many drunk dudes piss on the shore while chucking beer bottles in the ocean. This appeared to be condoned by the bars since they did nothing to curb this behavior. Lastly, the roads on Koh Pha-ngan are set up in a way that you have to travel 45 minutes or so to get to a different area on the island. It’s hard to explain, but the main roads go around the island with only a few cutting through the middle."

ThailandTourism,fcdycvx,t3_eh3tck,1577615090.0,"The Eight Ratvithi House. It’s a boutique hotel so it’s very cute and only had a few guests. My wife and I just stayed there last week. It’s a great location within walking distance of everything in the historic square and the weekend market. The lady who operated was super friendly and made great recommendations. She also set us up with her friend for a private guided tour of Mae Rim at a decent rate (1800 baht for a private car for the day). We stayed on several hotels in Thailand and this one was the cleanest, nicest looking, and had the best water pressure.

Edit: $50 usd per night. There is a free breakfast available but you’ll wanna check out some of the awesome cafes within throwing distance."

todayilearned,fc152ff,t1_fc131nh,1577308481.0,"Yep. I looked into Ireland’s requirements after you posted the link in the chain below. It’s definitely more complicated than the Schengen work permit laws, but easily doable if you’re willing to take any job to live there. Ireland’s work permits appear to favor labour intensive work and highly skilled individuals. People with credentials in good career fields don’t appear to be very welcomed."

todayilearned,fc0yamj,t1_fc0w8r7,1577302969.0,"I think it’s easier today. Transportation is significantly cheaper and more convenient that it was back then. Same goes for finding work. In the   US with no credentials, one easily pick up a job in the service industry (restaurants, Uber/Lyft, janitorial etc). A place to live shouldn’t be hard either, but you won’t have your own apartment. Renting a room or long term Airbnb would be a cheaper option."
