offmychest,ff2ehu7,t3_er71dd,1579502815.0,I am so sorry for your loss.  It does feel like losing a part of your heart when you loose a beloved pet. Every time it happens to me I cry and mope and focus on my missing baby. Then one day I am smiling about something he did instead of crying all the time.  I have gotten through the really hard part. I have had to go through this 23 times in my life. ( I am older than dirt as my dad would say). It never gets easier and I would never change anyone of those marvelous dogs and the time I had with them in exchange for not having to go through the pain of telling them good bye. Because the love I give them is a thimble full compared to the buckets of love I received in return.  Your baby loved you unconditionally  and will always be a part of you. And at some point you will meet again. In the meantime when you are ready there's another little soul out there who would love to have you be their human. Be kind to yourself.  You have just lost a large part of your world...you need to grieve. Again I am so sorry for your loss.
drawing,ff1h9mw,t3_eqz60u,1579479199.0,I love them and I think that if drawing helps with your depression then start a notebook of designs you like. Just for you. And later down the road if you ever want to share we're all here.
Dogtraining,ff18sq5,t3_er16ft,1579476393.0,"Yes! My pug does this, while obviously he's small and not hurting me.  The problem is he punches everyone in the throat when they hold him. He's getting a bit of a rep in the family as a tough guy ."
dogs,fewjix3,t3_eqpoak,1579411898.0,"We had this problem one time only. My son adopted a dog who had been abused and then chained up and left to die so she had horrible issues with always "" needing "" food. One Christmas season I laid out 3 pounds of butter on the counter to soften for Cookies.  We took the kids and did some shopping. When we got back she had eaten all 3 pounds of my butter. She left the wrappers all on the kitchen floor.  She gained a new nickname ...Butterbutt and I gained a new habit. All my butter stayed up high in closed cupboards."
LifeProTips,fepst9d,t3_eqa3om,1579330065.0,"I actually sat all my kids and grandchildren down and said "" Okay, I have just been hit by a truck and I am dead"". And after all the squeals and eww Grandma! I  had everyone go through the entire house and tell me what they wanted. It gave me a chance to tell them about the articles and make out a list of who gets what. Some of the items went to them right there. I can add to the list as someone desides that they would like something after all.  Makes it so much easier, plus the reaction when I told them I'd been hit by a truck was hilarious and it's become a joke in the family."
drawing,fej5w1o,t3_ep9c4c,1579158158.0,This is AWESOME...
aww,fecws16,t3_eoai6r,1578987735.0,I am smiling! It worked and what a handsome doggo too.
aww,fe6gzvn,t1_fe5oq3h,1578890617.0,Absolutely! My late husband and I would always root for the dog...and sometimes pretty loud!
aww,fe0wo04,t3_engal7,1578819620.0,Ahhhhhh. I've been attacked by the cuteness...I'm going down.
Dogtraining,fdl1ye1,t3_elvj4c,1578515653.0,"I agree with the person who said that pooping is a very vulnerable position for a dog. I have a pug who is partially blind and he has a large fenced yard but I still have to stand and reassure him. I'm sure that the neighbors think I am quite mad because I stand and repeat "" it's okay, mama's here"" . All the while he's finding an appropriate place to go.  But it makes him feel protected, I am the head of the pack, and so are you.  Maybe find a way to reassure your new addition and things will work out. He wants to please you."
dogs,fdjay39,t3_elmrg3,1578463715.0,I know it sounds silly but be sure and allow yourself to grieve...don't be ashamed of tears that come from the loss of your companion. You loved him and he loved you with his whole being.  That's what dogs do. Then find a special place to put his collar ( I have a Black dog statue with 7 collars beside my bedroom door). Now find another special little soul who needs to love you with his or her whole being.  It isn't being disloyal. It's being a dog person and your last little soul would want you to share your love again.
drawing,fcw2z5z,t3_eiypzk,1578015945.0,So wonderful. I love 'Alice in Wonderland ' and the Cheshire Cat is particularly well done.
dogs,fcvzchb,t3_ej2bgr,1578013555.0,"I have had dogs my entire life and I have had all sizes and breeds. I have lost 2 big sweethearts in the last 14 months. I decided that my pug ( who is a rescue ) needed someone to play with, the pack's getting kinda small. 

 I am retired with a huge yard, my dogs sleep with me, they get the best food and treats, and I live nextdoor to my son and my grandkids who adore my dogs. In fact I still drive over an hour away to where I used to live to take my dogs to their groomer because she loves them and they love her.

I signed up with a couple of local rescue groups to see if I could find a new addition.  WOW I couldn't believe the prices they wanted! $500 to $800 plus transportation if the dog wasn't local. So I will be going to the local dog pound...I have never gotten a bad dog and they don't charge enough to make a car payment."
aww,fctg6uo,t3_eiryvi,1577942230.0,Those eyes are mesmerizing! And he's a darling.
self,fctfs4o,t3_eisu2v,1577941856.0,"I'm so sorry for your loss.  You lost a big part of your life. Let yourself grieve and don't be ashamed. Sometimes people will say "" awe, it was just a dog."" Well we know better, that's like saying the Grand Canyon is just a hole."
aww,fctem4z,t3_eintfp,1577940800.0,So beautiful! Be sure and tell her that she is beautiful.  Fur babies love to be told just like we do.
dogs,fctdkjc,t3_eiqudc,1577939886.0,"I am so sorry that your fur baby and you are having to deal with this. I have a little old girl who has some brain damage and I knew when I adopted her that she would have problems.  One of them is she is incontinent. 

I solved the problem with a bit a work but it worked for us. I have my bedroom floor covered in puppy pads and she goes in there. I also take her out every couple of hours to potty. She still has an accident occasionally but I tried diapers and she was so upset by them that it broke my heart.  Good luck with your baby, just love em and have patience...with them and yourself."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fct29l5,t3_eimvyo,1577931001.0,That's an amazing shot...had me laughing instantly!
LifeProTips,fcs5539,t3_eik26d,1577911604.0,That's a great idea. Too often we are hard on ourselves because we set a HUGE goal for the year and then beat ourselves up if we ' fail '. In reality life's  a journey and we should be happy when we accomplish things. I make 2 lists...my big goals list and my regular goals list. And I add and cross off as I go through out the year.
aww,fcs3jxy,t3_eiiimg,1577910944.0,That was epic! I just laughed so hard I woke up my pug who was asleep on my lap. He's still looking at me like I lost my mind.
relationship_advice,fcmkoqg,t3_ehlwqh,1577779265.0,"I lost my daughter to murder and I thought I would never be able to function again (I also found her body). But God bless her friends they pulled together and every year for the last 14 years we celebrate her life on the date of her death and on her birthday.  We go to her favorite restaurant and have one heck of a party and tell wonderful stories about her.  Do this... start as soon as possible. The first year was a lot of tears. It keeps my daughter alive for her daughter and all her nieces and nephews.  It helps to spread the pain and each year we look forward to seeing each other and celebrating her.  Everyone will have a different view of his Girlfriend, something new to share, a story you didn't know. And over the years the child will get to know mom just as the children in my family know my daughter. My prayers are with you."
dogs,fbx5kl0,t3_eesfjg,1577170302.0,"I adopted a dog that had been badly abused and he didn't know how to play...seemed afraid. So my Mom and I decided to try to get him interested. Now he was BIG, (great Dane and rottweiler) so we tried to kick a ball around as a last resort because nothing else had worked.  He loved it! Only problem was he popped every kind of ball we got him. So my Mom showed up with one of her old bowling balls. Sparky went nuts, he loved it. I finally had to limit his time playing with the ball because he was rubbing his face raw. Heck of a dog."
