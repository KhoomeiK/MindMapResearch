bipolar,feahafx,t1_feaa681,1578948725.0,"I am not fully disagreeing however OP's statements about being uncomfortable can be taken as a request to have someone else in the room and once that request is made the physician/ psychiatrist / whatever must bring someone else into the room. What if this was an office that only has one doctor? Does that mean he would have to send his patient away if they request someone else to be in the room during a physical examination? 

No, it means he would have to ask a member of his staff to come into the room whether it be an aide, a tech or even someone from the front desk (confidentiality still applies). This person does not need to stand over the physician watching while the doctor is examining a patient, they simply need to be in the room for the comfort of the patient and/or as a third party to witness that everything was 'kosher' during examination."
bipolar,feaeok0,t1_fe9r4lv,1578947785.0,"     Please know that I am not disagreeing with your feelings in any way in fact, I can relate to quite a few of them and I can tell you from experience that just because they have the education/experience/credentials does not always mean that a professional and patient are a good fit. 


     I once had a psychiatrist that was very educated but perhaps should have been teaching in a lecture hall instead of dealing with clients 1-on-1. She doubled (from1000mg to 2000mg) one of my medications within minutes of my very first visit, despite the fact that I had only started the medication two days before. She refused to lower the dosage or change my medication despite months of my pleading and trying to explain how bad the side effects were but I was determined to follow my doctor's instructions. I finally came out of the FOG when she accused me of being a drug seeker ... While this whole time I'm F**k**g trying to get her to reduce the dosage ... but her accusation left me feeling horrible and small as if I had done something wrong by questioning her in the first place.


    I went to my family doctor and explain the situation I told my doctor that I am not looking for her permission but I am asking her for the safest way to slowly reduce the medication. I have never seen my physician with anything other than a poker face or a smile but when she saw the dosage I had been forced to take, her face literally dropped. She discouraged me from stopping the medication completely (I know she did this because doctors do not like to encroach on another doctor's territory especially if it's from a different field of medicine) before talking to the psychiatrist but she did write me two prescriptions for different and lower dosages. 


    I was still experiencing side effects when I was visiting someone in the hospital and happened to come across a notice for a 'Mental Health Medication Review' clinic being run temporarily in one of the major hospitals downtown. At the clinic appointment I told them everything that had been going on with my medication and that I had taken it upon myself to reduce the dosage from 2000mg to 250mg since my psychiatrist would not listen, the student doctors did not hide they're shock and disbelief at what I was saying but I let them know that I had also talked to my family doctor about this and that she was the one who wrote the prescription for the reduction of dosage. I also requested that they send their final report to both my family doctor and the psychiatrist.


    Later that week I had an appointment at my family doctor and she reviewed the report from the hospital with me in which they agreed I was on the wrong medication and highly over-medicated (they also noted that I had taken it upon myself to lower my dosage) with some suggestions for replacement medications and I confirmed that a copy was sent to my psychiatrist.


    At my next visit to the psychiatrist, she was visibly PISSED and demanded to know who sent me to the clinic then got even more agitated when I told her that I took it upon myself to go and have my medications reviewed. She started to make excuses saying that the review was done by medical students and therefore cannot be taken seriously, I responded by asking if they would not have a proper medical professional overseeing the report ... She did not respond. So I continued and told her a copy was also sent to my family physician and I had already reviewed it with her and that she agreed with the report. She had the audacity to hint that she knew me better then my family doctor that I had been seeing for >15 years while I hadn't even been visiting the psychiatrist for less than year. That was my very last visit with her despite my fear of not knowing when I would be able to find another psychiatrist (my family doctor changed my medication to one that was suggested by the clinic until I found a new psychiatrist)


   I apologize for the long winded story but my point is I don't think that this is the right psychiatrist / psychologist for you. You will have to be proactive and vocal if something doesn't feel right and if the response/action taken also doesn't feel right, let it be known sooner rather than later.


   Talk to your referring physician and/or your counsellor (it sounds like you have a good one) because it is very important that you have someone to talk to you that you are comfortable with, especially if you are detailing trauma or your feelings ... Or being over-medicated. 


Wishing you the best.

I'm wondering what action you expected to be taken when you expressed your discomfort to him, are you trying to let him know that you're looking for another psychiatrist?


 Otherwise I'm pretty sure he did exactly what he was supposed to do, you expressed being uncomfortable with him as a male (directly told him that he triggers you and makes you scared)  so as a professional he brought in a female co-worker to put you at ease. 

There is a note in my physician's office stating that if you are uncomfortable during any appointments or physical exam you can request to have family member, friend, or another member on staff to be in the room during your appt/examination and I believe this to be the law. 


Due to the reasoning for your discomfort he may have felt this is what you wanted / needed, and due to your situation it may be best if you ask him for a recommendation or a referral to a female psychiatrist / psychologist

JUSTNOMIL,fe6qm5r,t3_enrns9,1578900802.0,"••Way beyond OVER REACTING•• If I am reading this correctly OP was asked to remove a photo from FB to please her MIL and she chose to delete it rather then making the effort or taking the time to change settings for individual photos or restricting SO's family member's access, and in exchange for this great sacrifice OP has made consisting of the hardship of pressing delete ... 

OP has cancelled (quite possibly a very large) wedding ceremony representing SO's faith and culture  and swears that she will never be by his side when he walk through his parent door and never even sit down to a meal with them? Does this also mean they are not welcome in OP's home? 

I am very confused with the comments I've read, did everyone just stop reading before the last paragraph? OP is literally asking if she is over reacting and it seems no one is addressing it, everyone's more concerned with the photos on her Facebook page.

educationalgifs,fdkrttn,t3_elndln,1578509833.0,"I remember doing this on a class field trip, in Toronto we have Black Creek Pioneer Village which is open air heritage museum set like an old pioneering town. It has ""over 40 19th century buildings decorated in the style of 1860s with period furnishings"" and a few original restored structures, ""buildings include Dalziel Barn, period Houses, the original Strong family farm buildings, a water-powered Grist Mill. a general store, a blacksmith shop along with 10 other trades building, a hotel, a church, and a one-room schoolhouse"" all of what you're free to roam.


When I was in grade school we had class trips three to four times a year and Pioneer Village was always one of those trips (as well as the Toronto Metro Zoo) and over the years I remember pulling wool, using a loom to create a blanket and learning how to make and bake biscuits using a stone oven, all hands on. 


It's unfortunate that kids only get one class trip every year now, they miss out on so much.

Original Post: This is a gathering of members of your family to celebrate your 19th birthday in a public setting and if an unrelated nine-year-old is unable to sit still for more than 30 seconds (illness, mental health issues and/or side effects from medication being the exception)  and/or does not listen when spoken to by her guardian, she does not need to be there. She will not be missing anything and will not be missed.


 Why is she (from your uncle's wife's side of the family) being towed around by your uncle's wife to your family events especially if she's known to be disruptive, uncooperative and unable to follow basic instruction? Does she live with her grandmother?


I can relate to the situation 100% as my mother used to bring my father's niece to family functions for her side of the family because, ""she doesn't get to go anywhere, it's only home, school and church"" (not true - but her parents are ridiculously 'back-home-3rd-world-mentality' strict) ""and she doesn't have anyone to play with"" (also untrue she has two younger siblings- though they are complete terrors). After an incident of fingers in a birthday cake before the birthday girl even got to see it (her parents were pissed, it was not a grocery store bought sheet cake) followed by this teenagers makeup being destroyed in her bedroom, we told Mom to stop bringing her around until she got a little older. This year she joined us in a restaurant for my mom's birthday with absolutely no problems."
nextfuckinglevel,fckkpmr,t1_fckh5xy,1577727442.0,"I know right? But the truth is, from this video we can't really confirm that this Muslim woman is IN the United States of America (she is a visible minority after all) so we don't know if that blue-eyed police officer is standing there writing lies in his notes as he stands across the street, with his hand placed casually over his camera.


And it seemed that you forgotten, RAPED. There are news reports and court documents  detailing many instances of police officers across the United States of America raping women while on duty and getting away with it despite incredible (audio and/or video and/or bodily fluids) evidence.  And if this is what's going on with regular citizens of the general public who have access to the media, social media and other ways to file complaints/press charges, can you imagine the abuse and mistreatment of the women and children that are being held in the latest round of US 'camps'?


So yes I agree, she should be very careful while stunt driving in the United States of America, it only takes one racist to call in the PIGS and we've seen countless videos of the,""Look there's someone who looks guilty (translation -not white), shoot now ask questions later"" with zero consequences to the officers/shooter.


EDIT: So I come across this post of a very talented, hijab-wearing female showing off her driving skills and my first thought is that some asshole is going to try to make a racist, prejudiced, misogynistic and/or ignorant 'joke'; and lo and behold I find it without much effort, maybe three comments down.


This person stereotyped this woman and places her in a country where women are not allowed to drive or they will be 'beaten, arrested and jailed with no trial'. SIDENOTE: up until 2018 there was only 1 muslim-majority country out of 50 that didn't allow women to drive and now there are 0.


So what I did was, place that Muslim female driver in a place where, often without reason, police arrest, lie and frame visible minorities. American police officers can get away with rape and murder despite very clear and concise evidence, whether that be video and / or audiotape, photographs or collection of bodily fluids.


And can you believe it? I was actually downvoted (gasp of shock) for bringing up facts about police officers in the United States of America, while the original racist, prejudiced, ignorant comment has been upvoted. 


Are we surprised? Sadly no because as Donald Glover said, ""This is America"""
