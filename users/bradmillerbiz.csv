Tried both before posting and unfortunately neither works. I did try just ""gr fog"" on your recommendation though and it comes back that it must be 1 or 0.

It seems to be a relatively obscure setting. I've only been able to find one or two mentions of it outside of the official tweak guide. Hopefully Bethesda will respond to the support ticket I've submitted. That might be the only way I'll find an answer to this, if I'm lucky.

WritingPrompts,ff0itc6,t1_fezrq3f,1579469253.0,"I know you didn't ask for any advice or critique, but if you enjoy writing and plan to continue, this will help you.

There are a lot of lines of dialogue that are not attributed to anyone. For example:

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Kim said quickly.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine being here without you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe...neither,‚Äù Kim said. ‚ÄúIt scares me to think about.‚Äù

This reads as though Kim is saying all three lines. It's not until you read the third line that it becomes evident that the second line is actually being spoken by Roy. In school (in America, when I was growing up, maybe you're not from here or are from a generation that was taught differently, I know these things can change) we're taught that anything for which context isn't provided, it is to be assumed that it follows in continuity with whatever came immediately before. It works the same way with dialogue. If a line is not attributed, it is to be assumed that whoever was last attributed is still the one speaking.

The reason this is a problem is that instead of just reading the story beginning to end, the reader is being interrupted at points by the realization that the dialogue they just read was not being spoken by the person they thought it was. And the more immersive they are as a reader, the more this breaks immersion, causing them to have to completely reread the last few lines to get that immersion back.

Not saying this to be critical or rude, so I hope you don't take it that way. My hope is that you'll appreciate having learned something new, and use it to improve your writing in the future. Keep it up! Take care :)"

Besides, (based on wins) white (non Hispanic) people are pretty accurately represented (just over 62% compared to the just under 62% that make up the total population). If you count all white people, then yes, whites are a little underrepresented at just under 69% compared to just under 77% of the general population. But then, there have only been 16 winners in all, not a large enough number to really paint an accurate picture.

So, other than eliminations, why should I believe that Ru is racist?

UPDATE: After rewatching the episode, paying careful attention to the challenges, I do think there are other queens whose runway were as bad or worse than Porkchop's, however, Porkchop and Akashia were the only two who did badly in *both* challenges. They both deserved to be in the bottom. Granted, we don't have access to the raw footage, so we can only go based in what they've shown us, and from what they've shown us, Porkchop underperformed on the LSFYL. Akashia had the words down and even lip sync'd the backing vocals, which Porkchop did not."

BTW, managers hate it when an employee's personal drama winds up in the workplace. Like when jaded ex's call the store to harass the employee multiple times a day. I've heard a lot of stories of people getting fired for that. Just saying ;)"

Canned response with list of possible reasons, none of which applied to me. When asking for clarification, I was just sent the same response over and over. That one, at least, is a waste of time. They're simply not honoring that offer, at all, so don't bother."
ExplainMyDownvotes,fc8meqi,t1_fc8jccu,1577537911.0,"Alright, let me put in in the exact same context then. And this is not hypothetical, it's something that happens very frequently in real life. A guy assumed to be attracted only to women says ""no homo but that's an attractive dude."" Most people are going to take that exactly as it's meant, that the guy is good looking but not *sexually* attractive. 

Also, ""cute"" is used in much the same way as ""attractive"" in that it's sometimes used to mean ""sexually attractive."" By your logic, everyone who says a kid is cute wants to fuck that kid, which we know just isn't true.

Furthermore, when pressed about *why* they were attracted to kids, they went on to list several reasons, not even *one* of which was remotely sexual in nature. So even if certain assumptions could be made in a more ambiguous situation, this was not one. *Specific statements were made to the contrary.*

At this point though, if you still don't get it, I don't think you ever will. So *I'm* done here."
ExplainMyDownvotes,fc8idur,t1_fc8btmd,1577535555.0,"No, it isn't. If someone said ""that's an attractive price point"" or ""I'm very attracted to this handbag,"" no reasonable person with any decent language skills is going to assume that the person wants to literally have sex with the price point or handbag."
