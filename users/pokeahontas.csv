vegancirclejerk,fem97sb,t1_fejohbx,1579244433.0,"The sad thing is I can actually top that. I was raised in a very small town in Eastern Europe, like where my neighbours all grew their own meat and animals. We didn’t grow animals, so my dad bought our annual pig from a neighbour. Like a living pig. I was about 5 and it was fall. He brought me to see and feed him, and I remember thinking  “I always wanted a horse or a dog but I’ll take a pig he’s cute”. I named him Chi chi and legit thought he was my pet because my parents told me “he’s ours”. 

Months later, near Christmas, I remember playing in the living room and my dad came in with this big hunk of stuff wrapped in paper, and he said “look honey, it’s Chi Chi!” Queue me quitting meat, then being lied to and force fed my own friend for Christmas."

TrollXChromosomes,fdidv5l,t1_fdhch91,1578440670.0,"Now that I have genuinely not heard of. Do you have a normal middle/mother’s maiden name? Like would you ever go by it? 

For instance my mother goes only by her middle name. I realized her first name was something else when I went to university and had to use her banking information. So when I think of middle names I think of them as a second option in case you don’t like your first name haha"
TrollXChromosomes,fdh2q4t,t1_fdgium4,1578414107.0,"My parents did this, and then someone fucked up and didn’t hyphenate in my passport when we immigrated to Canada. So now, I have 2 separate last names they are totally unpronouncable, one of which always gets mistaken for my middle name. 

Best part is, my parents divorced and now they each have new last names ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
vegan,fdfocgb,t3_el3p5q,1578366337.0,"I appreciate you taking the time to post this! I will say though, it isn’t really what the person said so much as you yourself being open to listening without allowing your preconceptions to hold you back.

Your story reminds me of a TED talk I saw where the speaker was describing visiting a dog meat factory in Korea, quite vividly describing their horrors in a way that forced you to imagine your own pet in those conditions, until he turned it around and said it was actually a completely legal and “humane” pig farm in the UK. I sent it to my mom (quite anti-vegan) and she said “haha ok”. 

I’m not even sure if she really watched it, but if she did she clearly wasn’t open to actually listening. 

That’s the big difference here, between you and someone who “could never go vegan”. It’s not what you ate before or what you like, it’s your openness to accepting change. At least that’s the way I see it"

Instagramreality,fdec2b7,t1_fddv559,1578335751.0,"While I don’t know if it’s the same for fashion, I do have an art page on insta and have 2 groups of about 10-20 people, where we support eachother by giving likes and comments when we post. 

The purpose is to work around the Instagram algorithm that highly favours those with above 50k followers, and get our stuff seen and noticed.

At the same time though, I’ve made lasting relationships with people I talk to nearly daily, we support eachother by giving real feedback, sometimes even buying each others’ work."

They don’t get close, they’re wild animals and were hunted to near extinction in the region by poachers. They tend to be standoffish and untrusting of humans as a result. They were curious but from afar!"
interestingasfuck,fch9dsd,t1_fcgg7b8,1577648505.0,"You mean like physical/health risks? There were botflies, malaria, chiggers, and a happy amount of other diseases to be weary of (I was taking malaria medication and had my typhoid and yellow fever vaccines beforehand). 

There was also the fact that my research required me to trek off-trail areas of the jungle alone from dawn to dusk - basically following the tamarins. So I had to be weary of various animals like snakes, Jaguars, ocelots, etc. In reality, I didn’t see any scary animals but I did pass by the same area as a Jaguar 4 minutes apart (we set up motion cameras) though this was a record for the field station. 

The worst things that happened to me were: I fell in a mud pit after a heavy rainfall, I got peed on by tamarins, and got bat parts thrown at me by an overly eager capuchin"

todayilearned,fch6sgr,t1_fce107q,1577647777.0,"Definitely there is some cultural influence there, it was initially written down by a Spanish priest since before the story was passed down through oral tradition. However, it is widely accepted because surviving Mayans contend that the book is accurate, and there is material culture from the archaeological record to support it - depictions of the underworld, the various deities, etc. So it doesn’t all come just from this one book. If you read the Popol Vuh, it doesn’t read as 1:1 similarities, and it wasn’t written down for any religious agenda. It is actually regarded as a nice example of early anthropological practices. 

In any case I’m not a Mayan expert by any means, but I did work fairly closely with my Mayanist professor during my undergrad and this was one of the more widely accepted theories for why Mayans were among the more successful in adapting to colonist lifestyle"

todayilearned,fcd2eue,t1_fccgv3i,1577605512.0,"Mayans have their own book of creation stories/myths about their god, similar in a way to the bible - there is a creation story, a kind of heaven and hell (underworld) that are accessible by people and are linked to one’s behaviour throughout their lives. There is one overarching god that created the world, animals, and people over numerous periods of time. There are also a lot of similarities drawn between Jesus and Kukulkan, one of their numerous deities.

There are of course many tangible differences, it is a different religion, but they were similar enough at least initially for the Mayans to accept Catholicism as another version of the same story, whereas other native groups didn’t have any relevant comparison. 

If you are interested, their book of creation is the Popol Vuh, it has a good English translation and it’s pretty short."

todayilearned,fcc6i55,t1_fcbwvgs,1577594965.0,"They are “extinct” in a global context as a nation/political power but they are still a culture much like North American natives with their own languages, traditions, communities, etc, but they live in a Spanish speaking country/government. 

They were assimilated like other natives from the Americas, but because of many religious similarities between Mayans and Christians, the European adaptation went much better and with less bloodshed. 

At the same time, if I recall correctly because  Mayans lived in more densely populated cities, they were exposed to more diseases and suffered less population collapse when exposed to the Spanish compared to North American cultures"

But they’re so dark, thin, and slender that when they move (and hover in really weird positions) they come off as a bit creepy. I think the biggest thing is that they’re up to 5 feet when fully erect so they have a serious presence.
