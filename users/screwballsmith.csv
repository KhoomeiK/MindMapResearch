ottawa,fd79mob,t3_ejy77q,1578201241.0,"I disagree. Less weird places are needed. We don't have a big enough population for each culture or subculture to be properly supported. We have tons of bars that diversify their entertainment in an effort to do that, but there's no guarantee you're going to get a steady crowd on any given night. This obviously isn't good for an establishment's prospects for long term success. What we need is one well known establishment for each major culture or subculture in Ottawa. One place that you know will have a steady stream of entertainment on any given night that will provide the content you enjoy most. It would be a hell of a lot easier than tracking which bar is now hosting your favorite drag night on the third Wednesday of each month. Another reason to have one specific well known club or bar for a specific type of entertainment is the bigger prospect for high end performers. Famous clubs attract famous acts. Think Zaphod's, or hell even the Bronson Centre. It's been around so long and is so well established, that despite its age and location, it still attracts some pretty big names in rock music. We used to have a Jazz club called Tuscons. It was the only place you could go to see jazz legends perform live on a nightly basis. Now it's a shawarma joint which I don't think has ever been full to capacity, if even half that. The EDM scene, would benefit greatly from having a place like that. As far as I know there is one place in town which has an electronic night on the third Saturday of the month and only brings in local DJs. Unfortunately we still have to look to Toronto or Montreal to see most of our favorite acts in whatever subgenres to which we subscribe."
