fucking truth"
depression,fcph5b9,t3_eh6aac,1577863824.0,"Look, we have to be honest with what we're dealing with. Depression isn't a realization. It's a disease, *it is a disorder*. We only feel the way we do because of it, it's cancerous and infectious in it's nature. It's corrosive and conquers our very way of thinking, changing it to suit it's' ultimate goal. Which is, of course, our deaths at our own hands. 

> But society wants us to think otherwise because they are the privileged or ignorant, so they put labels on us and says we need ""correction"". We're just realists.

We're the opposite of realists, we're delusional. We're victims of a vicious disorder that bleeds into every single thought and action. Deluding us into believing.. shit that isn't true. It makes that shit feel true, but it isn't. And honestly, we all need help, and I don't mean to say that in a negative way, I say it because it's true and lending credence to the idea that we're realist allows our depression to further sink it's claws in, because we've already lost the will to fight at that point."
