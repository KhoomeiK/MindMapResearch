An example could be someone who has no children, being killed because they decided to test a live power outlet with a fork."

facepalm,fexkqfl,t1_fexiuk6,1579432566.0,"We don't know anything about them or their background. They could have been old white males feeling guilty about privilege and on a social justice crusade for all we know.

The point was not to berate you for name calling - I apologise if it came across that way. The point was that people don't change their behaviour because a stranger has labelled it negatively.

Many people have misguided views and beliefs, and these can change over long periods of time through self reflection. Only education and patience can feed into this process."

facepalm,fexd4fa,t1_fexclot,1579428968.0,We don't have enough data points to know for sure if they're both of those things. All we know for sure is that they said some bad things on this occasion. It's also well understood that it's generally not helpful to escalate name calling with more name calling.
