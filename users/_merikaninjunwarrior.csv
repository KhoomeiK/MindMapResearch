BlackPeopleTwitter,ff6rlf0,t1_ff65hot,1579633415.0,"even so.. i'm not into powwow at all but it is powerful and interesting if you get translations or learn the groups. ive been to indian music festivals, like in colorado and nM and i'm not into powwow or flute, etc, but liked it and the crowds.cuz that is not our tradition.. though we do have single drum blessings and ceremonies/crafts, but it is kind of rare and mostly for churches, feasts and in traditional medicine use

e:so i meant if you want to hear native music it mostly tells a story or about their tribes and the usual covers, there's everything from variety band, metal bands, and blues/rock groups like Indiginous, who are well known and tour. some bands play originals that talk about rez chicks and rez ghettoness life. or there's good books out there, i've read most of sherman alexie(young adult/poetry)"

trippinthroughtime,ff54cur,t1_ff539nm,1579579882.0,"the fingering/plucking is the only technique IMO, you could hold most the chords and finger around it, and i think there's only like 3 different verses that pretty much do the same kind of thing. with bowies song, some of the chord changes are not in the usual scale for the key(offkeys). yeah i'd guess stairway is a little harder for a beginner, but it's really just the usual minor upward scaling notes(like salsa music or the main verse to *Hotel California*), which i could probably play most by just holding the full key that the melody is playing. but then again it mite just be cuz it was one of the first songs i learned just to say i know it. i agree tho
