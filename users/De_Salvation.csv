horror,ff94e9r,t3_es54hr,1579704571.0,"Me and my brother went to see the remake of the hills have eyes, he was 17 i was 12, he had forgotten his id so we got tickets for a different movie and snuck into the theater, nobody and i mean absolutely nobody else was in there so already i was like 'fuck' and then the movie started and every jump scare and every tense moment was esclated by the fact that we were not supposed to be there. Thats when being scared became a goal for me. 

It started out small, scary movies and progressed into watching gore videos online. I couldnt get enough of them, two guys one hammer, funky town, honestly name it and ive prob seen it. That kept me satisfied for a while but just was never enough, i mean it wasnt the gore i was interested in, it was the feeling of fear i would get watching them. 

When the feeling died down i realized i wasnt going to get the thrill i wanted behind a computer screen. I ended up finding this guy through my buddy, a big fish in the drug industry. I started off buying small amounts of cocaine, see just carrying the package on me omw home would hold me over the rest of the day. After that grew too expensive and a little boring i started pushing it, but not to anyone i knew.

Man what a rush, having no idea whether or not the person you are meeting is a undercover is intense. That held me over for a couple years, when it would get stale id just start pushing more. It was great but it just wasnt enough. I decided the next logical step would be selling bunk shit to people and ive been dealing with some for a while now so i took the leap. 

Boy did that go sideways quick. After i sold it to, well lets just call him Ricky, I decided to lay low, i mean it was a decent amount, nothing to bankrupt yourself over but enough to prob kill over to some people, but i digress. After a couple weeks of dodging him i decided it would be best to bring him the real stuff and his money back, i mean i was a junkie for fear but not suicidal. 

I met up with him at the local basketball court and after a heated exchange the unthinkable happened. 
You see, i ended up getting into one little fight and my moms got scared, well next thing you know im on my way to my aunt and uncles in Bel Air."

Ive worked many fast food jobs and have seen numerous homeless people come in to buy food, again thats also anecdotal though. I personally have a firm belief of who gives a fuck? If my 5-10 gets spent on a bottle of booze or whatever their vise is and it makes living underneath underpasses or on the street a little bit better for them then who the fuck am i to judge. But to assume most homeless are like that by choice is dumb, for a lot of homeless those addictions didnt happen until they lived on the streets, a large number are war heros, another large percentage are special needs people. I cant remember where but theres a program in the US called 100,000 homes for homeless where this organization partners with lanlords to set chronicly homeless people up with actual homes. The change is almost instant and i believe they have around an 80% success rate of keeping these homeless 'druggies' on the right path, this program proves that sometimes people just need a fucking hand and honestly in my opinion only a monster can look at another human whose down on their luck and just say oh well fuck em, they choose to live like that.

I would have followed suit with them honestly if Bernie hadnt asked us to vote Hillary. The issue is itll happen again if its Biden or that Pete guy, because a large portion of voters are tired of lying two faced politicans, and when youve got a 70yr old jewish man who was getting hosed down with black people in the streets during his youth, someone who hasnt majorly changed his political stances throughout almost his entire career, well then he becomes the only viable option to get us out of this corrupt government stronghold. Nonetheless i think it is a good thing that a huge chunk of these voters do hold out in times, i honestly believe that if they wouldntve we wouldnt have had canidates like Sanders, Yang, and Gabbard in elections to come, at least not until the cycle repeated itself. To reiterate though, chances are if its biden or pete (i cant spell his fuckin last name right now) then we will have 4 more years of trump, unless the first 4 scared a lot of these bernie or bust people to vote blue no matter what, but thats not really the way most hardcore bernie supporters feel and it shouldnt be the way any of us feel.
