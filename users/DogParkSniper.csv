But now? I might be less likely to go kaboom and catch Hep C getting said drugs at the pharmacy. Kinda important when you've got a legit need for them. It's just a bitch and a half to pretend you drink as little as an AA fanatic.

I went the legit route, but holy hell is it a motherfucker after you turn 18. I'd have saved thousands in psych bills by just cooking my own. And I was lucky enough to get a prescription, after a diagnosis. It's pretty batshit how adult ADD is treated here.

If you think you have ADD, get tested. As it turns out, I've got it in spades. Same as my kids. And I didn't even believe it was real until I saw them turn around with treatment. Suddenly, I knew what normal people must feel like. If you don't have ADD, amphetamines will give you the problems I used to have.

My first time around, I was thankful not to have a set schedule, but I squandered it on not working. When I had an office job again, I got a hard case of the sad brains. It might have been the kick in the ass I needed to keep it up after working my way to a second chance, as well.

Not having to take a job that requires antidepressants to show up regularly sure seems to be a good motivation for me, though. The work isn't more enjoyable now than it was back then, but the negatives are a lot more tolerable, knowing how much I hated every office and factory job I've had.

If only because there's no fear of starvation to make me put up with folks I want to cuss out. Not that you should if you have the chance, but it won't mean lodging in a cardboard box if you go off on someone. Sometimes, that's enough to keep you from going off on said rant. And then feeling angry as hell after holding it in, making your family's life suck, because a customer or supervisor had unresolved rage they wanted to pass off on you.

My work ethic has changed between now and 2015, because I'm not going back to that shit. Knowing the freedom I'd lost, it took some industrial-grade antidepressants to get me back on my feet.

But I get to take my kids to school and pick them up. Plus, I'm not as hostile as my old boss was. Dude's own wife hated him. Her biggest mistake was being his secretary and hanging around. I was the first person to stay on as an office assistant for more than six months in years. Fucker caused me to get a therapist, and my divorce letter was just not showing up one day. And he was the third worst boss I've had.

After figuring out what gets myself motivated, I'll fight like hell to keep working for my best boss: Myself. I just wish I'd figured out how to be that the first time around."

eroticauthors,fcswvzw,t3_eid8vw,1577927161.0,"**What Went Well**

- I got back to being consistent again. Backing off on insane daily/weekly/monthly goals helped here.

- Redoing my keywords and upping my cover game gave a steady increase to the lifespan of newer titles over time.

- I quit obsessively outlining everything in advance. Yeah, it works for some people, but once I know how a story gets to the end-point, it's dead to me. Having only a premise and a conclusion to write toward meant better enthusiasm and results, personally.

**What Didn't Go Well**

- I never got much done on the non-erotica pen name. Partially because of the outlining hiccups mentioned above. And it's an ambitious project that may flop. My enthusiasm died pretty fast on that one.

- The first six months was all bursts of new releases and weeks of nothing, until I settled back into a decent pace. What I earned over the course of 2019 reflects that.

**What Did I Learn**

- A big rush of new content in a short period is great, but it doesn't mean long-term gains.

- Now that I'm settled in on my ADHD meds and have figured out how they affect me, it's much easier to focus on what I need to get done. Early on, I fell into the trap of doing what I *wanted* to get done. If you take any kind of amphetamine, that's a dangerous trap.

- Steady, incremental improvements beat all the hype-talk and motivation in the world.

- An extra hour or two refining the first cover for a series is like spending more time on titles, keywords, and blurbs. You get the benefits from that early work over every part, so it's beyond worth the added time."

Truckers take their jobs seriously, and you should be thankful they do. If they treated their work half-assed as the average person, we'd have a lot more deaths on the road."

They're the new targets of hate speech and genocide, in case you haven't noticed.

Yeah, I laugh at them too."

Par for the course in Kentucky when it comes to industrial contamination. The further east you go, the less they have to pay, and the less likely the companies are to get caught to begin with. People are scared shitless to report anything in the eastern 1/3 of the state, because the companies own every politician, from the county reps up to the federal level.

Reporting a company dumping waste is a great way to get charged with trespassing on said company's land."

Same punishment. They're touchy."

That was a total win on my wife's part. Even discounting the hours I'd have to put in building it at $1.00/hr, I couldn't have built the same thing myself and came out on top."

Not to excuse the guy, but it doesn't absolve modern evangelical leaders of the same thing. There are religious blowhards of all stripes.

Been there, done that. Some of us just took the next step and dropped the dogma, while keeping the message. It pisses everyone off."
eroticauthors,fc2akis,t3_efovlc,1577348781.0,"Reviews are a single person's opinion of a story. Unless they point out a glaring issue you missed, erotica reviews are the one loud guy who throws a fit one way or the other.

Pay attention to how much money a title makes, and write more of what pays. Not many people review erotica, so they're by far the loudest. Pay attention to what they say and adjust as you can, but dont risk a steady revenue stream to make them happy.

And someone's always gonna bitch if you give a title enough time, no matter what you do."
