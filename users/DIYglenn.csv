I thought this was a one-time thing, but started noticing more and more of these little things, but couldn‚Äôt quite understand it. 

Then I talked to a relative there, and he bluntly responded ‚Äúit‚Äôs ‚Äòcause you‚Äôre white and they‚Äôre black‚Äù.

He makes a lot of racism jokes (‚Äòcause racism IS a joke, in his words), but I felt really bad after seeing people be differentiated out of skin color, and some people kept being segregated by choice as well. 

This was 2015, and I started feeling that a lot of people were still living in the 60‚Äôs.
