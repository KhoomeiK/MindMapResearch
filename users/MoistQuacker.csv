Going forward there will be an internship and graduation from college, should be nice since the internship should keep me busy throughout the day. There is a party the 25th where I will be going to so that is also nice. Has been a long time since I have been at one.

I do agree that whatever happens next is for a rather large part in my hands. There will always be events which I can't influence but that's okay.

Thank you for the reply, I do hope all is going well with you as well."
