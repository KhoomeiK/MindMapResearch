Oh and how are these kids going to be prepared for regular 9-5 work days when they're adults if we train them their whole childhood to only function for 5?

Where are these kids for the rest of the day and who is watching them? Who's providing the day care? What would they be doing that's more beneficial than school would be?

marvelmemes,ff3jlir,t1_ff2opgc,1579542433.0,"They didn't really have time to talk about it, but that was kind of the plan. Thanos attacked almost immediately after Hulk snapped. They had to find the stones (which they would have done regardless of whether they'd use them), decide who would tank/sacrifice themselves with the second snap, get them to that person, all while trying to stay hidden from Thanos and his goons. Even that almost didn't work as Hawkeye was playing keep away the whole time and evil Nebula almost got them. 

I'll bet either Thor Hulk or Cap would have volunteered to take the lesser snap if it came to that. But once everyone else showed up and they had a fighting chance they didn't necessarily have to snap his army away. If they could have returned the stones without using them and just had a regular battle I think they would have preferred that. It wasn't until both time machines were destroyed that Tony was forced to use the stones to keep them away from Thanos.

So it's not like they were just sitting there with ample opportunity to snap Thanos's army and were just not taking it. Almost all their power was being used just to keep the stones and survive."

Plus you need to have a franchise willing to take on the extra media circus that comes with hiring the first female head coach. And if she's smart she won't take an abysmal situation like the Knicks or Kings and wait for an opening with a higher floor. I doubt (hopefully) that she's getting passed on for sexist reasons, more just ancillary ones that come with hiring her, let alone anyone with no experience in the role. But I wouldn't be surprised if there were one or two owners still left that wouldn't hire her just because of her gender."

Maybe I'm just naive, but I do believe that he didn't have the extent of the information about that dude, and he believed that the situation was handled when that's what he was told.  To say ""he changed when he was caught"" to me implies that he had some hand in the harassment, which I don't buy. I think he learned the extent of it around the same time the media was. That's certainly negligent and bad enough on its own. FWIW, while I appreciate his enthusiasm for the team, I don't think he's the best owner in the league even based solely on the basketball side of things.

The guy who directly reported to him about these exact kinds of things was in on it and Cuban fell for it. Cuban was not a part of this scheme, but it's his job to know it was happening, and he fucked that up terribly. Now they have a new woman in that same job who based on every source I could find is a great person and candidate for that kind of role, and I believe she was even given more authority than the last guy had to fix things like this. Based on what I've seen from Cuban over the years as far as billionaires go he's an alright guy. I don't see why we should assume he's going to continue to be negligent."

nba,feppsts,t1_fepo2xi,1579327262.0,"Ideally maybe, but in practice the onus is typically on the defender to not get in the landing space of the shooter. That's the same theory behind charges and blocks. Once the guy is airborne there's nothing he can do to change where he lands. If you're going to leave your feet on defense, you need to make sure that it's not going to put either you or the opposing player in danger. Maybe it's not equal or fair, but that's typically how it's called. At least, as typically as something can be with this wildly inconsistent officiating."
