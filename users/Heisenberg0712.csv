(been reading a lot of George Herbert lately)

 This is only the second time I've shared my poetry. I quickly jotted this poem down yesterday as I was feeling somewhat creative. Typically I only write prose, but here goes nothing! I hope you like it, and look forward to the help of you experts :)

\------------

Yesterday it happened that I was in a story

As I stood alone in the snow.

I made a purchase there,

In my mind, where

I bought a precious thing.

&#x200B;

I saw love in dress I’d never seen before,

Glory like a drunkard under the moon

Or a bloody sky turned white,

And I longed for a little bit more.

&#x200B;

He spilled paint on the floor

That by the pour was a banquet;

I sat at the table,

eating and singing,

and brushing the snow from my boot,

And though I forget the rest I know there’s more.

&#x200B;

I went back and bought the canvas

For the price of a confession. 

And I uttered it there in the store

With all those people watching;

And some of them laughed at me.

&#x200B;

But I felt lighter even with it against my chest,

Gilded, though they blushed for me,

I was unharmed:

Shining under a charm, as it were,

For it held my core."
