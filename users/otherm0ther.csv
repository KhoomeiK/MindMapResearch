I recently bought one for my daughter and when it arrived it was too small for her.  So I contacted the company and asked if I could exchange it for a larger one.  They responded right away and asked what size we would like.  They said they'd send her a new one the next day!  We don't even have to mail the small one back to them.  The next day I got a notification that the new belt had already been sent!  I'm a customer for life now!

I don't measure anything but this is roughly the recipe of how I made it if you're interested...

Indian Rice:
1 cup white rice
1 Tbsp olive oil
2 cups boiling water
Onion powder
Ginger powder
Chili powder
Coriander powder
Yellow curry powder
Turmeric powder
Salt
Pepper

Once the water is boiling add all ingredients stir, cover then simmer on low for 18-20 minutes.

Lentils:
1 Cup lentils
5 cups vegetable broth

Bring broth to boil then add lentils.  Simmer for 45 minutes.

In a deep pan add Indian rice, 1.5 cups lentil ""soup"", 1-2 Tbsp coconut cream, a few splashes of hot sauce and more curry powder if desired.  Cook on medium heat for about 4-5 minutes."
