grandpajoehate,ffb1gkg,t1_ffa92m8,1579749424.0,The Kim family was just as cutthroat as any businessman. They got a few people intentionally fired using dishonesty for their own personal gain. Those people actually wanted jobs unlike Grandpa Joe but were taken advantage of by less scrupulous individuals. It seemed like they might even be worse than the rich family if they had that money.

Also starting a diet doesn’t necessarily even mean you’re following someone else’s diet, could just mean you’re cutting down on eating or all sorts of stuff. Following proven diets is a great idea as well, even Tom Brady listens to his coach."

Anwar Al-Awlaki was a big part of it. The government controls and spins the narrative while creating terrorists by killing innocent people. Blowback is something Scahill is trying to get people to consider. The places and the stories he covers shows the highest level of journalistic commitment."

KeepWriting,fcs7hgp,t3_eiirr9,1577912516.0,"I really liked this poem. Throws enough of a rope for the audience to understand but still challenges the reader. The line starting with Lethargy seems to be a declaration of the theme, like “if you didn’t understand before let me complete the picture”; which helped me out. If I had to change one thing I might not use as much punctuation, some of it feels like unnecessary clutter."
