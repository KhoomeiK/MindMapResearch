Being a woman in ancient times sucked. Without modern hygeine/waste disposal, periods are more of an issue. Most of a womans time was spent pregnant, which brings obvious physical limitations. Women died in childbirth (or complications) frequently. Post partum depression wasn't understood or acknowledged. 

A monarch with access to medicine/laundry/servants etc would not be subject to many of the physical hindrances that common women would have. 

For many people, including noblewomen, it was ""clearly evident"" that the sexes weren't equal, just that the elites had an easier time taking care of things."

In old lore they said a heavy stubber was .50 cal, and had the same stats as a bolter. 

A lasgun is the same strength as an autogun, which is slightly stronger than a modern assault rifle, so more like a 7.62."
