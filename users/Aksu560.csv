UpliftingNews,fcpbkyv,t1_fcp930u,1577857275.0,"Not all depression is due to chemical inbalance. Also, what helps and doesnt with depression depends entirely on the person. 

Depression meds in themselves are really scary (FDA requires the 9 most used depression meds to all have warnings of possible suicidal thoughts, and that extends to this side of the world. That was a fun thing to read on my pills)

Im by no means an expert here, but my point here wasnt about the high itself, but about the act of it. My main way of dealing with spiraling is programming. But it isnt really about the result, but simply the act. And exercise, friends, the usual did not help with that. Because what helps depends entirely on the individual.

What comes to increased scitzophrenia chances, if that is the case, then yes, weed isnt an optimal solution. But like I said earlier, wrong meds on the wrong person can have horrible side effects. And if you dont know of anything else that helps. If youve tried the options you have, and youve found that weed helps, I wont blame anyone for taking the risk.

If they are using it to justify an addiction, they are lying to themselves. And they know it. And then weed will only fuel their depression. And it will be extremely obvious to those close to them that that is the case.

Dont get me wrong. Im not going to suggest weed to a friend who asks me for help. Im not gonna suggest anything. Ill tell them that the best option is to go see a doctor, and be there willing to listen to them whenever they want to talk. Because thats the best I can and should do as someone who does not have training in treating mental health."

Im personally currently dealing with depression, but Im making progress. I have a daily ""ritual"" that keeps me sane, and specific actions I take when I can feel that Im spiraling. I can totally see weed being part of that. And those rituals can be extremely important.

Yes, it can absolutely be used to justify addiction, but that doesnt mean it cant be the other way around.

I guess this would fall under medical, but thats a tricky subject in itself. AFAIK getting a license for medical marijuana can be quite difficult in some places, and here in finland, is just not possible. But legal or not, if you are smoking to stay functional, thats a pretty medical purpose."
