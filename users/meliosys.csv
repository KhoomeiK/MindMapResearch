Some low level insiders working at the stadium would have an unfair edge, so the max bet ensures that nobody would be making millions on inside information."
college,fdo5vi6,t3_emd7yg,1578599438.0,"Since you are at a T20 school, if you can just get your diploma then it's really no biggie. I will say that if you are a business major (or a graduate school intent), then you should get your gpa up, but otherwise I would say just get your diploma and do internships."

poker,fc1sxh4,t3_efk3kp,1577328704.0,"A good chunk of players that are active on poker forums are close to break even or marginally profitable, but the typical casual player who stops by a home game once in a while or maybe plays cash a couple times a year is likely to be a losing player. 

My friends and I play .25/,50 and most of them (including me) are losing players when factoring in online play and casino sessions. It's not too big of a deal since we manage our money and we don't go broke, we play poker for the social aspect and thrill of the game. 

The advice here that is based off of math (odds, ev, ICM), assuming that the math checks out is likely decent advice. The problem most players have is applying GTO theory into real life games which takes a lot of practice.  If you just like poker, I wouldn't worry too much about your profit as long as you're not out of control and missing rent because of poker."
college,fbrgxbm,t1_fbq6sr8,1577042797.0,"I went to a CC with a decent hs gpa, I wanted to work while living at home and take some classes so I could have money and credits when I went to a state uni. 

It was a good choice, I've got more spending money than other students and I only have two years left to get my BS."
