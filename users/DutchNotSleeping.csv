IAmA,feworts,t1_feumsen,1579417202.0,"My dad had something similar happen. When he was quite young he got a big promotion at work, which included a company car. This company wanted to show their costumers they were doing quite well, so all company cars had to be reasonably high end (not a Ferrari, but also not a VW Polo). As I said, my dad was young and he was in no position to afford such a car if the company wasn't paying for it. He went car searching, but the first 4 car dealerships basically ignored him as just some kid looking at cars for fun. The 5th car dealer basically just asked ""What are you in for today"" and when my dad explained he was very helpful and nice. My dad has bought every car he owned when working for that company from that dealership"
assholedesign,fepr6jm,t1_fepe99e,1579328520.0,"75%? Don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware there is an unfair pay gap, but not 75%. Depending on the country you live in it's somewhere between 25 and 15%.

Also two wrongs don't make a right. I'm a male feminist who is politically active, and volunteers for an organization that has a goal to get more girls interested in STEM studies. This pisses me off and can potentially allianate people like me. Let's make the world more fair together by investing in the youth and leading by example"

AmItheAsshole,fefyo45,t1_fee6fou,1579069699.0,"A lot of people say therapy is for the weak... Fuck those people. I've had therapy and it improved my life greatly. 

You went through a traumatic experience. The fear of losing a child is not something that you just shake off. The weak thing is to not recognize that you need help. So I'm glad that you are considering therapy, to stay strong for your wife and kids.

As for your 'apology', I think telling your wife you'll work on it, is better than any meaningless gesture. You can of course make some kind of gesture as an added bonus (won't hurt)"

DutchFIRE,fbzz71l,t1_fbzvy4k,1577269813.0,"Het is maar wat de klant wilt. Het meeste is VBA inderdaad. Ik ben begonnen doordat ik een vakantiebaantje had waar ik software zou testen. Nu had dat bedrijf net een hoop naw gegevens binnen van een klant maar die waren net allemaal verkeerd (naam, Ipv voornaam tussenvoegsels achternaam etc.). Ze vroegen of ik in plaats van testen, de eerste week ze kon helpen met die gegevens juist formatteren. Ik heb 4 uur gedaan om een stuk of 20 van die sheets te formatteren in tegenstelling tot de volledige werkdag per sheet die de vaste werknemers erover deden. Sindsdien stond ik onder een nul uren contract van dat bedrijf, zodat als ze iets van excel hadden dat ze mij dat konden laten doen, maar door de 2 jaar regel moest dat stoppen. Ze vroegen me toen of ik niet een bedrijf zou willen oprichten zodat ze me konden blijven inhuren. Ik heb nu 3 klanten en werk gemiddeld 15 uur per maand aan dit soort klusjes. Ik verdien €55,- per uur ermee dus dat is naast mijn studie prima verdienen.

Het is verder echt netwerken netwerken netwerken. Ik hanteer met die €55 per declareerbaar uur dat ik elk uur dat ik betaald krijg 2 uur besteed aan niet betaald werk zoals mijn website verbeteren en naar netwerkbijeenkomsten gaan."

DutchFIRE,fbo2ebe,t3_ee2f7g,1577005901.0,"Ik ben recent ook m'n eigen bedrijf begonnen. Je kan gewoon een afspraak maken en dan zullen ze je helpen. Het kost 50 euro, dus dat zijn de kosten niet, en het voorkomt eventuele boetes.

Verder is het handig om te kijken of je stad of regio een ondernemersplein heeft. Ik weet toevallig dat Enschede en Nijmegen er een hebben, maar veel andere steden ook. Mocht je studeren, dan ik de kans groot dat ook je universiteit of hoge school iets te bieden heeft.

Veel succes met je onderneming!"
