MMA,ff80vra,t1_ff6zweg,1579663082.0,I believe it's because Meltzer doesn't have a contact in Disney to get figures but it's trending similarly to the Khabib Conor PPV based on the numbers he does have access to
MMA,ff805i3,t1_ff5hlgu,1579662557.0,">That doesnt make any sense.... if conor is a naturel lightweight, why fight at 170? That would just have a negative effect on his performance....

Yes it does...so he doesn't have to cut...quite the opposite.

>You dont seem to understand the point let me explain, i dont care who conor fights at 170, i am saying that he shouldnt get a titleshot at 155 for fighting at 170, he must fight 155ers to get a shot at the 155 belt. Is it clear now?

I don't ""understand the point"" because you didn't make that point lmao. You might have said it elsewhere in this thread but that's not the point I was replying to. You didn't say any of that in your comment. So no, it's not clear.

>cutting isnt a huge issue in the ufc, only a few occasions where fighters really cut down to fight for example darren till when he used to  fight at 170, but he moved up,or maybe joanna, but that was due to her nutritionist.conor and gaethje dont have any of these problems so why fight at 170?

Ohhhhh, you don't know anything. Now it's clear.

>Cutting is part of the game. If you have a problem with cutting then you can move up in weight divisions, but winning in one division shouldnt have any impact on other divisions you potentially can fight

Cutting is part of the game but it's super dangerous and bad for you. It's probably the biggest issue in the sport. 

Conor fighting Cowboy at 170 doesn't really affect 155 division, however Conor beating Gaethje at 170 would still impact the 155 division because you can't ignore Conor having a win over him (if it were to happen) when talking about who deserves the next title shot."
MMA,ff5f8bb,t1_ff583ck,1579590286.0,"Conor is a natural lightweight too, so not sure what big advantage you mean. They would be within a few pounds of each other naturally. The reason 155 is easy is because that's his weight class too. He just said he likes fighting at 170 because he doesn't have to cut. And isn't that a huge issue in the sport we are trying to fix? Why give him a hard time. It's not like he is a natural WW trying to call out smaller dudes."

Interestingly, while Conor always brings a bunch of fans with each fight, many have stayed and many have also turned against him for various reasons. So there is a not insubstantial amount of band-waggoning morons here who first come along because of Conor and then starting shitting on him, the whole time thinking they know more than they do, and have since joined different fan bases and being just as clueless for them.

The issue isn't Conor fans (myself being one), the issue is clueless bandwaggoners who jump from ship to ship looking to sound smart despite having zero knowledge by validating themselves through their superior fandom. Oh, you like that team that always wins? Guess you know what your talking about... 

You would be surprised how many Conor bandwagoners are still here sporting Khabib flairs (and others, not singling Khabib here) who talk shit about him being washed up and have absolutely zero knowledge of the sport other than keeping track of who wins in the top 5 of a few divisions and watching some gifs here and there."

Adelaide,felxayx,t1_felwg9c,1579233280.0,"That's the problem with oversimplifying things such as passed = movement and past = time and then saying there are some exceptions, because when those exceptions arise, such as now, you are both wrong and confident in your wrong amswer.

This is one such exception. Because she wrote ""rode past"" and not ""I past"" its correct as rode is the movement and past in this case is an adverb. It is explained below for you to learn. The area to pay attention to is at the bottom and I have put it in bold for you.


https://writingexplained.org/passed-vs-past-difference

What does passed mean? Passed is the past participle of the [verb](https://writingexplained.org/grammar-dictionary/verb) to pass, meaning to move on or ahead; proceed. It can function as both a [transitive and intransitive verb](https://writingexplained.org/grammar-dictionary/transitive-intransitive-verbs). For example,

The car passed me in the left lane.

I unknowingly passed by her in the crowd.

The train car passed through the mountainside.

The different tenses for to pass are as follows,

I pass (present tense)

I passed (past tense)

I have passed (past tense)

I will pass (future tense)

The verb to pass usually implies movement of some sort and can sometimes cause confusion because it often means to move past.
For example,

The hunter passed by the deer without even seeing it.

Some people will mistakenly write a sentence like this as,

The hunter past by the deer without even seeing it.

In doing so, people confuse passed, which is a [verb](https://writingexplained.org/grammar-dictionary/verb), with past, which is a [noun](https://writingexplained.org/grammar-dictionary/noun) or adverb. If you take a look at the second sentence, you will notice that there is no verb for the subject hunter because past is not a verb.
A good way to tell which word to use in sentences like these is to rewrite them using the present tense. For example, you would rewrite the above sentences as follows,

The hunter passes by the deer without even seeing it.

The hunter is passing by the deer without even seeing it.

**However, you could write the following sentence,**

**The hunter walked past the deer without even seeing it.**

**In this case past is correctly being used. The verb in this sentence is walked and past is acting as an adverb.**
**A good rule to keep track of troublesome sentences like these is that if a verb indicating motion is already in your sentence, you will always couple it with past not passed.
For example,**

**He passed us by.

-but-

He sailed past us.

He flew past us.

He blew past us.

He ran past us.**"
Adelaide,felvdua,t1_felubyo,1579231882.0,You are wrong. What the said was correct and you can't use passed there instead. It isn't a case of both being acceptable. Past is correct and passed is incorrect there.
soccer,fek59mu,t1_fek50cw,1579192893.0,What? Grain of salt? If your saying I don't automatically believe everything people say then yes. If your saying you have to believe every untested accusation or your are a rape appologoist then go nuts buddy.

With that said though, why would you say no, stop it at a bar? It's definitely something that could be said playfully in the bedroom. And no where did they say she said it for 5/7 minutes. If your argument is sound you don't need to twist things like that. 

Also why would Cristiano describe in vivid detail raping someone to the police. That's what makes me think the words could be out of context. Not saying he's innocent, but I need some actual evidence to go around calling him a rapist every time his name is brought up.

I'm saying it's possible he's innocent, you are saying he is 100% guilty without having any real evidence."

The first seems easier since his hand was clearly slashed. The second is harder to quantify. I would expect he would have had a stronger case if he didn't fight. He can clearly point to the loss of income from pulling out. The fact that he still fought means he still earned part (half?) of his purse and felt healthy enough to still fight. It's harder to quantify the likelihood of the win bonus and career boost when he still might not have won even if 100% healthy. Could he not warm up properly because he had less time? Or could he not use his hand while it dried? This is much more into the nitty gritty of the specifics of US case law than simply pulling out of the fight. It will very much come down to precedent, though perhaps this is all for a settlement and a favourable matchup from the UFC to make up for it?"

All the intellectuals on here were quick to distinguish themselves from the lowly casuals and say that Nate is actually a natural 155er, and it's 1 weight class apart and in fact Conor is such a big 145er they are pretty much the same. 

So it started out as correcting the initial exaggeration but then swung too far the other way as barely any difference at all. This was also due to Conor bringing in so many new fans and many of them were rooting against him, so they would see people say the size difference wasn't as big as initially presented and then go around parroting the meme so as to demonstrate their new-found MMA knowledge."
