I cannot imagine how confusing it must have been for you to navigate all those conflicting feelings as a child. We all have unique ways in which we process things. I hope you are doing well and continue to do better."
Dogtraining,ff0mzlx,t1_fezjv2g,1579470403.0,"For sure, I agree CC is a complicated process and not something to be done by inexperienced people. You don’t want to push the so much that he becomes scared of training, of rewards, and/or of you. This is especially important with dogs that are fearful, anxious, or skittish. The aim is to make the dog more comfortable with handling and touching, not to flood the dog or make training sessions stressful for the dog.

ETA: I just noticed you deleted the content of your post! I wish you had kept it up, it was a good post. Most people think all dogs want love and attention all the time, and IME some people get *even worse* around fearful dogs. As soon as they hear “sorry, my dog is shy” it’s like logic is thrown out the window. Everyone wants to be a dog-whisperer Disney Princess or something. It’s so important to remember not all dogs want attention all the time, especially from strangers!"
Dogtraining,ff0le7h,t1_feyxpzd,1579469953.0,"Yes of course, anytime you are attempting to fiddle with a dog’s emotional response to a stimulus, you want to make sure to be really careful with the process. If you are not careful with counterconditioning, you can end up shifting the emotional response to the reward, meaning the reward is no longer a reward and instead causes the dog to get scared. This is the reason I always encourage people to talk to a trainer before they attempt CC!"
Dogtraining,feydsay,t3_eqrxtd,1579444218.0,"I agree that consent petting is important! However, regarding “treat bribing” and petting - I really would never say “absolutely not.” I’m not sure if your behaviourist was including training in her explanation, but treats are a good way to train/desensitize dogs that are head shy or really skittish. You reward the dog for coming towards you, you can lure and reward the dog for letting you touch his head/neck, and eventually you reward the dog for letting other people touch his head/neck. It doesn’t mean you let any stranger touch him and make him uncomfortable. But I think working on changing your dog’s emotional response to handling is important and beneficial to most dogs. At the very least, veterinarians are going to handle your dog. People are also going to be handling your dog if you board them, take them to the groomer, hire a dog walker, or take them to daycare.

EDIT: so to anyone who is reading this, *please do not attempt to CC your dog if you have never done it before.* You should only attempt it under the guidance of an experienced trainer. Remember that thresholds are extremely important during training and that each dog is an individual and each case is going to have its quirks. If your dog’s reaction to being touched is fearful or aggressive, *contact an experienced trainer or behaviourist.*"
cookingforbeginners,fesml8p,t1_fesfh56,1579366827.0,"I make them with zucchini so I am not sure if they would freeze well or if they would get too soggy when reheated, but they do last in the fridge for a couple of days.

cookingforbeginners,ferx8c7,t1_ferpxwz,1579359287.0,"The short answer is “it depends.”

Carbs and fats are macronutrients - your body needs them. They become unhealthy when you eat too much or too little of them (assuming you aren’t doing keto or something similar), or when you consume too many refined carbs and fats that pack a lower nutritional value.

Oil is not intrinsically bad for you, and neither are flour, eggs, or corn. Whether this particular recipe is healthy or not depends on your body, your mental health, your goals, and the portion size. You shouldn’t be worried about pan frying unless you’re using crazy amounts of oil. You don’t need that much, especially if you’re using a non-stick pan.

I personally would skip the corn because I don’t like the chunks. I would instead use a “meatier” veggie - my favourite is zucchini, shredded and squeezed through a cheesecloth. And I would pan fry them in olive oil for sure. If you are not looking to lose weight, you can add parmesan cheese to the mix - it’s high in calories and can be tricky to portion if you don’t count macros, so don’t add it to the mix if you are trying to lose weight (you can add a little bit on top after you finish cooking them if you really want parm). The fritters have eggs in them, but the ones I have made before had a relatively small amount of protein and veggies, so I don’t count the fritter itself as a complete meal. To complete it, I would eat a medium/small fritter with a veg soup/salad on the side (maybe topped with a small amount of avocado) and a some chicken breast for protein."
dogs,feofn6s,t1_fejzs1w,1579299547.0,"This is exactly the issue with the word ""dominance"" being thrown around in training.

You said that Dr. McConnell ""has succumbed to popular pressure and changed some working \[*sic*\] to avoid making waves,"" but this is not the case. The issue here is that you (and the person who wrote that entire website you cited) are conflating the following:

* “Dominance"" in dogs and as defined by ethologists
* “Dominance”  in dogs and as defined by the average person
* ""Dominance"" in dogs and as defined by (some) trainers

None of those groups have the same definition for that word.

According to Dr. McConnell's book, *For the Love of a Dog*, “dominance” is one of the most misunderstood words in the English language. ""Dominance describes “who gets the bone of two individuals who want it” without specifying *how* the winner gets the bone. ""Dominant"" and ""submissive"" as defined by behaviourists do not describe a learning/teaching/training style, let alone a dog's inclination to listen to their owner and behave appropriately. If you want another source, [here](https://rogerabrantes.wordpress.com/2011/12/11/dominance-making-sense-of-the-nonsense/) is an article from Roger Abrantes on dominance as it relates to dogs and wolves - I am pretty sure I saw this in the site you linked as well, by the way. Dr. Abrantes defines dominant behaviour as ""a quantitative and quantifiable behavior displayed by an individual with the function of gaining or maintaining temporary access to a particular **resource** on a particular occasion, versus a particular opponent, without either party incurring injury."" No mention of leadership or training methods either.

Why am I pointing this out?

* Because some people will see the website you listed with all its out-of-context quotes and say ""see? science agrees!"" without understanding that there is a huge difference between the definition that researchers have vs the definition that ""dominance""-based trainers or old school trainers may have.
* Because those training schools use *their* definition of ""dominance"" and *their* (mis)understanding of ""natural behaviour"" as a big push for their training methods, even though the term does not mean what they say it means.
* Because those training schools encourage owners to view their relationship with their dogs as being based on a constant struggle for being the ""alpha""; this perspective facilitates misunderstandings and miscommunication between owners and dogs, and can aggravate or directly cause behavioural issues (not to mention that it can also sometimes build resentment from owners towards dogs).
* Because some of those training schools perpetuate outdated training methods and some (not all) even encourage owners to use tools that should only be used by experienced professionals.
* Because some of those training schools argue/complain that positive-based trainers (or even LIMA trainers or vet behaviourists) are weak leaders who coddle dogs and have zero control over their pets, and that modern dog training has created spoiled and entitled dogs who have no discipline and therefore rule the home. (EDIT: I put the link on the wrong bullet point) As an example, just look at [this link](https://dogtraining.world/dominance-in-dog-training-debunked-or-is-it/), which is used as a citation in the website you listed even though it literally contradicts what plenty of the other sources say.
* Because those training schools claim that basic training concepts, like mental/physical stimulation, structure, leadership, and consistency, are equivalent to ""dominance"" and are unique to their training style. This is obviously not the case and it blows my mind when people (including owners or trainers who ascribe to R+) believe this is the case. ~~As an example, just look at~~ [~~this link~~](https://dogtraining.world/dominance-in-dog-training-debunked-or-is-it/)~~, which is used as a citation in the website you listed even though it literally contradicts what plenty of the other sources say.~~
* Because [dogs do not see humans as dogs](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/canine-corner/201310/do-dogs-know-the-difference-between-dogs-and-other-animals), so it is not practical/helpful for humans to try and establish ourselves as part of the social hierarchies that occur between dogs.

Also, can you expand on what Cesar's ""very important trick"" is? I hope you are not talking about ""alpha rolling."""
dogs,fejxvyk,t1_fejpgzl,1579188348.0,"“It works” is a really lousy way to defend a point. Just because it “works” doesn’t mean it’s okay. It also doesn’t mean you are addressing the underlying issue that the dog may have. Old school training styles also “work,” that doesn’t mean it’s okay to hit your dog until he stops chewing your shoes.

Reddit loves science and academia until it directly opposes their personal beliefs. Please cite a reputable source that says Cesar Millan’s methods are humane and are supported by ethologists and research.

dogs,fe2kig2,t3_enk921,1578839518.0,"Yes, it is normal. Dogs can RG space, food, treats, chews, toys, people, etc. For now, remove all the chews and toys that your dog has, and teach the dog a cue to go into the crate so that you are not physically moving the dog yourself. My friend uses “kennel up,” another friend of mine uses “go home.” Teaching “off” so that the dog gets off the furniture or off the bed is also a good trick to have in your arsenal in case you need it. If the dog has something he shouldn’t have and is guarding that item, call him over, get out the leash, or throw a couple of high value treats away from where the dog is so that you can grab the item while the dog is distracted.

*Mine!* by Jean Donaldson is a good book to read regarding the issue. In order to work on resource guarding, I really encourage you to find a trainer who is knowledgeable on the issue, understands the root of the problem, and uses methods like *counterconditioning* to treat it. Punishment is most likely only going to make the behaviour get worse and is gonna stress out the dog even more."
MadeMeSmile,fe0abpp,t1_fdywiie,1578807612.0,"Yep. Hate to be that person, but you’re right to say that adopting two puppies at the same time is a risky move. It’s called “littermate syndrome.” *It doesn’t happen to everyone,* but it’s important to watch out for the signs regardless. What ends up happening is that two puppies who are around the same age and are raised together (they don’t need to be littermates) can become co-dependent and may not focus on bonding with their owner or with other pets. It’s like they become each other’s security blanket. This has a negative impact on socialization and training. Eventually, the puppies mature once they reach 1-3 years old (depends on the breed). Sometimes they still get along (but now they are extremely bonded to each other to the point one cannot be removed without the other one having a meltdown), sometimes the siblings become intolerant of each other and end up fighting.

Keep in mind that littermate syndrome hasn’t been formally studied/researched very thoroughly, so it is unfortunately the kind of thing that is only brought to awareness by trainers or behaviourists who have observed it. This is common in the dog world since ethologists had not bothered studying dogs until around 30 years ago. If I had to make an educated guess, I would imagine that the impact/severity of littermate syndrome has a lot to do with the breed and temperament of the puppies, the manner in which the puppies are raised, and the owners themselves."

He’s still a busy, active cat, but he’s manageable and a lot more loving / cuddly.

If you’re really worried, a certified veterinary behaviourist would be able to tell you if the kitten’s behaviour is abnormal. They can be pricey though."
CatAdvice,fdw219o,t3_en7bzp,1578754193.0,"*My Cat From Hell* has plenty of episodes on YouTube where people had the same problem you do. Jackson Galaxy has his own channel on YouTube as well.

Most kittens (and puppies) are crazy and require hard work. What your kitten is doing sounds like normal behaviour to me - he just needs exercise and mental stimulation.

Are you guys playing with the kitten? Even if he has toys, you can’t expect him to entertain himself all the time. You need to be attached to one end of the toy in order to really engage him and tire him out. Da Bird is a life-saver, I don’t know any cat who isn’t at least somewhat interested in it. Play with the kitten 3-4x a day for about 10-15 minutes (or until he’s panting) each time. Focus on mornings and evenings since that’s when cats are the most active.

As for the nails, get some treats and feed him the treats while you touch his paws. You can also start to introduce him to the nail clipper (make sure to get one for cats). Eventually you should be able to trim his nails yourself. It’s easy, just catch them when they’re snoozing, be patient and gentle, and don’t force the cat to stay."

dogs,fd3y832,t3_ejvtgr,1578162678.0,"What type of training methods are you using, how much exercise does she get per day, and what type of exercise is that?

This will sound harsh but I really don’t mean for it to be harsh: your dog sounds bored and under-exercised - this has a big impact in her impulse control, which was likely not great to begin with. Often, “stubborn” dogs aren’t actually stubborn, they’re just less interested in doing things just because. Your dog probably also doesn’t understand what you expect her to do, plus she is bored and full of energy.

In regards to her going nuts when she sees other dogs/people, check out r/reactivedogs.

For basic training, Kikopup and Zac George are good training resources in YouTube. Kikopup’s videos don’t have all the cool music and camera work that other videos have, but she’s a fantastic trainer. You can also enrol in Fenzi Dog Sports Academy - they’re online classes and are pretty good.

For exercise, do you have access to a fenced area that is not a dog park? Maybe a friend’s yard or a family member’s yard? Some people use long leashes (like 40ft+) in an open field, but *be careful* and don’t give her the entire leash right away (the leash can snap and she can gain so much momentum from running that she can hurt you from pulling), and only use a long leash with a harness.

For walks, look up “Silky Leash” by Grisha Stewart (there’s videos on YouTube); this should help your dog learn to move with the leash, not against it. Don’t move if your dog pulls. Reward if the dog is not pulling (bits of boiled chicken breast work great). Kikopup and Zac George have videos about leash walking. Denise Fenzi also has a leash training method that I haven’t had a chance to look at but that is apparently very effective.

For mental stimulation try feeding her through training, in puzzle toys, and/or using snuffle mats. Anything that is not a mindless activity can be mental stimulation. Trick training for 5-10 minutes several times a day is mental stimulation. Nose work is fantastic for mental stimulation (Fenzi has classes online). Walks where the dog gets to take her time sniffing everywhere are also mental stimulation. If she likes to play fetch, you can make it more challenging by doing a “blind” fetch, or asking her to do a trick before you throw the ball. Teach her the names of her toys, play hide n seek, practice “barkour” (get her to go above or below obstacles while out on a walk), go on hikes, take her swimming or snowshoeing (anything that teaches her to be aware of her body), etc. This is all mental stimulation, and it is super important for dogs.

Impulse control usually comes naturally from all of these exercises added together. If you want to put extra effort into it (and I think you should, it will make life easier), ask your dog to sit or lie down for *everything.* Leash on/off? Sit. Want a toy? Sit. Want supper? Sit. Want cuddles? Sit. Want attention? Sit. Want to get on the bed/couch? Sit. Etc etc etc. Most importantly, *ask your dog to sit before going through doorways.* I usually only do this with our entrance doors, but I had a particular dog that had to do this whenever I was about to open any door inside or outside the home."
dogs,fd3eitb,t3_ejyxag,1578157575.0,"I’ve used martingales a couple of times for prior fosters who were/are most likely sighthound mixes. Martingales are commonly used with sighthounds since their heads are narrow and their necks are thick enough that the collar can slip off.

For a reactive dog who is at risk of attacking another dog, I would use a properly fitted basket muzzle instead (there’s a sub for this, can’t remember it off the top of my head....r/muzzledogs?). Since your dog walks well on a leash, I’d also use a harness with a handle. If the dog pulls to try to get at another dog (and you are in a pickle), it is  easier to pull the dog upwards and throw off her balance, meaning she won’t be pulling as hard and everyone can get away safely; you’d be choking the dog if you pulled upwards with a collar. If there’s a fight, it’s less dangerous to reach for a harness with a handle than it is to reach for a collar (it’s still dangerous though). Note that a harness and a muzzle are not a substitute for training, just strategies for extra safety in case shit hits the fan.

ETA: I’m not sure if the last part is applicable to your situation since your dog isn’t reactive? I don’t let my dogs meet unfamiliar dogs on-leash, and definitely don’t let them sniff other dogs for more than a few seconds while on leash either.

dogs,fczoskj,t1_fczgx6j,1578105888.0,"I am sorry, it is hard to say goodbye when you get attached. Instead of finding the dog a home by yourselves, I do encourage you to surrender the dog to a *reputable* rescue agency. If I were in your shoes, I’d search local rescues, thoroughly read their websites, and check out their reviews (especially the negative ones). Rescues have the capacity, knowledge, and resources to find this dog a good home. The rescue I volunteer with asks for: an application, a phone interview, personal and veterinary references, and a home visit. It’s a lot of work, and sometimes apps fall through during the last stage because we find out the applicant lied to us - ask me how I know.

My advice for you is that you use this sucky situation as a learning opportunity. You already know it is unwise to get a puppy under 8 weeks of age. Next time try to go through a shelter/rescue or a reputable breeder. Tackle foundation training from day one with the guidance of a reputable, positive reinforcement trainer. Lastly, find a breed or an individual dog that matches your energy level and your family’s lifestyle.

I agree with your husband that the dog has a chance to be a great pet, *but* it will cost (more) money and it will take time, consistency, and effort. You have a big move coming up and will need time to get adjusted to your new home, plus you got the kids coming soon as well. Major changes like those will most likely stress the dog out and cause a regression in training (not that training is a linear process anyway). Your kids are pretty young and it will probably be stressful and difficult to manage the dog and the kids at the same time.

I guess what I’m trying to say is that it’s okay to surrender this dog, just don’t forget about this experience. I understand that this is a very difficult situation and I get why you have made the decision to surrender him. Ultimately, your kids and your mental health should come first."

I’ve used a bunch of different chews for my fosters. The most common ones are:
- Dentastix. They don’t last long but they’re approved by vets. I stick one in a Kong with kibble and something that will freeze.
- BusyBones/Jumbones. They’re controversial, also don’t last long, and are high-calorie. But the dogs like them and we get them as donations every now and then.
- Braided bully sticks. Smelly but they work.
- “NoHide” chews. Controversial (digestive issues, possibility they’re actually made with animal-based rawhide) but they work.
- Benebones. Also controversial (potential to cracking teeth and dangerous if big chunks swallowed) but they work.
- Raw carrots/cucumber. Don’t last long but they’re low-calorie and cheap. I haven’t tried freezing them but they may work best for teething if frozen.

Chews I’m interested in using in the future:
- Yak chews
- Raw non-weight bearing bones (like beef kneecaps)
- Tree root chews (not to be confused with gorilla chews, which are hard wood and will splinter)

Chews I have no interest in:
- Any smoked bones
- Anything from the dollar store
- Nylabones (they’re usually smaller/thinner and don’t last as long as benebones IME)
- Gorilla chews

I like hard chews (like benebones) for dogs that like to lick and gently gnaw or scrape chews. I would not let a dog who chomps on chews have one unsupervised.

Here’s the thing: I honestly don’t think I have ever read of a perfectly safe chew. There’s always a story of a dog who died, got injured, cracked some teeth, got sick, or needed surgery. Just supervise your dog, get appropriately-sized chews, watch for recalls, and remove them when they’re too small/broken."

Here are some puppy things to keep in mind:
- Puppies are babies too. They don’t know how to control their strength or exuberance. They need training, and training requires time and consistency.
- Puppies bite *hard* during their teething phase and have needle-like teeth. It hurts. You need to train bite inhibition so that the puppy learns to control their biting. Are your kids going to be playing with the puppy during the teething phase? It usually lasts months. You can limit the puppy’s interactions with your kids, but are you going to be able to give the kids *and* the puppy enough attention?
- Potty training can be a PITA. The rule of thumb with puppies is to take them out every hour, after meals, after playtime, and after naps. It’s a lot of work.
- Most puppies need to get used to being alone - occasionally you get a unicorn who settles with no issues but you should not expect that this will happen. Will you be able to deal with crying/whining when you leave the puppy alone? You can’t (and should not) be with the puppy 24/7. Remember that maybe *you* can deal with it, but your spouse and kids have to listen to the crying and howling too. Will they be okay with that? Are they going to give in and go give the puppy attention (meaning the whining is being rewarded and will be much harder to stop)? Will this bother the kids or disturb your spouse’s sleep?
- Will you be able to manage the kids and the dog’s training? What happens if your puppy develops a behavioural issue, especially one that is difficult to deal with while having children (resource guarding comes to mind)?
r/puppy101 is a good resource if you’d like to hear more stories or see how much work can go into puppy raising.

Your kids are young. Focus on them for the next couple of years and wait until they’re both old enough that you can all take the puppy to puppy training classes together.

An *adult* dog would be fine with your family. If you rescue a dog, I highly encourage you to go through a foster-based rescue organization and look for dogs that are fostered with kids. If you want a purebred, you can contact a reputable breeder and ask if they have any adults available. There’s also breed-specific rescue agencies, but those tend to have crazy waiting lists and are usually picky with their applicants.

You will need to teach your kids to give the dog personal space, and you’ll need to teach the dog to behave politely around kids. Look this up on google - there’s plenty of resources that will give you guidance on child-dog interactions."

foodscience,fcouhl3,t1_fco30ht,1577841898.0,I just didn’t want people to focus on that and make assumptions :)
HumansBeingBros,fckagc1,t1_fck6qwg,1577720855.0,"Don’t mind them. It’s popular to hate on all parents/kids for whatever reason right now. Chances are high they have never had kids, they’re edgelords, or they’re kids themselves."

AskReddit,fcizb7z,t1_fcib5bt,1577673427.0,No joke. I knew a girl in college who was majoring in music and played the oboe (and some other wind instrument). She got drunk one night at a party and ended up playing a game where she put her hand flat on the table and someone else stabbed the space between the fingers. She ended up with a serious hand injury that required surgery. Apparently she had serious nerve damage and lost a lot of strength/mobility in her fingers. She tried to stay in her program but ended up dropping out of college.

dogs,fbwu00o,t1_fbw8rk5,1577159395.0,"I agree with you, getting a dog ”for your dog” is a valid choice **as long as it’s done in a responsible manner.** This is not always the case, but some dogs do benefit from a companion. Some dogs take cues from other dogs and really benefit from watching them interact with their environment in a confident manner.

I currently have a foster dog who needs another dog in the home. He is a street dog who spent his entire puppyhood with his siblings and has only now been separated from them. He’s really shy and skittish. He only began to open up when we introduced him to our other foster dog. They didn’t particularly care for each other (they have completely opposite personalities) but now that she’s been adopted, he is hesitating a lot more during walks. If we walk him alone he freezes and refuses to move when something scares him. If we take him out for a walk with my MIL’s dog he still pauses but will watch for the other dog’s reaction to the scary thing. He would be okay by himself in an experienced home, but he truly is a different dog when we have other dogs around. Friendlier, more playful, a bit bolder, etc."
