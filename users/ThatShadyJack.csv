Now I‚Äôd implore you to check this site specifically dedicated to disproving myths about climate change. This list covers many of the misconceptions.


https://skepticalscience.com/argument.php

Here is some NASA data on the human effect too. Note that the CO2 levels rise during the industrial revolution and beyond.


https://www.google.com/amp/s/climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus.amp

Here is a scientific piece from many scientists outlining methods for policy makers.

https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf

Now I‚Äôll give you a little summary there on my own words but please look at it for yourself I beg you.  CO2 along with other greenhouse gasses have doubled in the past 50 years of human development. These include methane and nitrogen too which are even worse in these high amounts for the ozone. All of these play a role in keeping the heat we receive from the sun. They cause a positive feedback loop because of the lost of albedo when snow is lost. After that you may have heard of things like permafrost melting releasing more methane into the atmosphere. 

Climate change itself works on many fronts. For example another large concern is the acidification of the ocean because it absorbs all this extra carbon dioxide. This damages sea life greatly because sea life has their shells dissolved. As you can imagine this would destroy the food chain. Which will affect us heavily. 

Another useful analogy I‚Äôd like to use is this. So there is a cycle of carbon dioxide in nature. It‚Äôs effectively breathed in and out throughout the seasons and some is stored in the soil. Now we emit roughy 3% of the carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. This is a net increase. Like say you have a 100 dollar budget and 100 dollar expenditure but every year you ad 3 dollars to it. That at first doesn‚Äôt sound like much but this is year after year with in reality an increase in the net ‚Äò3$‚Äô. This build up is not something nature is prepared to deal with. It doesn‚Äôt help either when massive deaths of land are turned into farms so there goes another carbon sink. 

If you‚Äôre curious for precedent for high carbon levels there is some. Now through ice cores and old tree rings it‚Äôs actually possible to extrapolate the historical carbon levels on earth. The thing is they have been higher and the earth has been warmer. However there is no historical precedent for this rate of warming at this speed. 

Here is an excerpt from this similar mass extinction.

Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum

The warming, which lasted 200,000 years, was caused by the release of massive amounts of methane or CO2. It was thought to have come from the thawing of methane clathrates in deep ocean sediments, but the latest theory is that it was caused by a massive volcanic eruption that heated up coal deposits. In other words, the PETM is an example of catastrophic global warming triggered by the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Yes the establishment is against him, but he still didn‚Äôt get enough votes in the caucus. This is a fact. It wouldn‚Äôt have made a big difference back then. Even if he wasn‚Äôt hindered. 

The corruption on the dems is still nothing compared to the GOP it‚Äôs no contest. So yes you are being a bit of an ill informed centrist. That said it would be great if there were better options but that‚Äôs not realistic right now unfortunately."

PewdiepieSubmissions,fdqe77y,t1_fdqdbrb,1578664340.0,"What? He definitely does even more drone strikes than Obama and pulled back more of the civilian casualty reports and precautions. 

During Mr Obama's eight years in office, 1,878 drone strikes were carried out, according to researchers. Since Mr Trump was elected in 2016, there have been 2,243 drone strikes. The Republican president has also made some of the operations, the ones outside of war zones, more secretive. As a result, things have different today: under Mr Trump, there are more drone strikes - and less transparency.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-us-canada-47480207

They both did both of these things... so what is your point? Because one of them did it less and it was Obama. 

Doesn‚Äôt make it less bad for either bare in mind. But didn‚Äôt threaten war crimes and start fires for himself to try and put out.

Still preferable."
