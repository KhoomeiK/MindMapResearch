Baking,few4wo9,t1_few4bgj,1579405419.0,Itâ€™s pretty good! I shouldâ€™ve waited for my bananas to ripen more before I baked this though.
Hair,fev0iur,t1_feutgqp,1579391805.0,Every other day
Hair,feun838,t3_eqnt7t,1579388153.0,"My hair is a little wavy but I donâ€™t mind spending time to style it with heat in the morning. I mostly want to cut my hair because it is extremely damaged and doesnâ€™t grow anymore, but also wanted a new hairstyle from what I usually have. I also want my hair to be long enough to tie back for sports."
piercing,fefr9lp,t1_fefpf2p,1579062899.0,Iâ€™ll definitely continue with the aftercare and hopefully itâ€™ll get better with no issues.
piercing,fefr7dt,t1_fefqedy,1579062850.0,"Thereâ€™s no fluid coming out of it but it is pretty warm to touch, hurts a little bit, and is swelling up. Hoping itâ€™ll be a little better once wake up tomorrow."
piercing,fefox76,t3_eox3pc,1579061170.0,"So my piercing is about 3 weeks old. Iâ€™m a member of my schools swim team and also work as a swim instructor. I got this piercing knowing that I would be in a pool for many hours a week. Anyways, I keep my piercing clean by spraying it with a sterile saline solution after exiting the pool and once a day on top of that and I havenâ€™t had any problems until now. Iâ€™m just a little worried that the piercing will become infected from all the bacteria in the pool. Hoping someone can help me identify the problem?"

bulletjournal,fcmc2s5,t1_fclxi6z,1577770093.0,Try to use a large brush and make sure your layers are relatively flat! It also helps to start with wet paper so your colours are more even.
