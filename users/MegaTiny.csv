howdidtheycodeit,ff38z35,t1_ff36l2v,1579536505.0,No worries. Sorry it wasn't more detailed. I only really know the theory behind random generation and none of the actually useful code.
howdidtheycodeit,ff362q5,t3_ere54l,1579534555.0,"It will just be a random level generator. They have sets of rooms and corridors and it sticks em together as you said.

Likely there's rules about how many of each tile type can be used. 

The rooms aren't necessarily huge, though it seems some of the rooms are quite large. The reason the seams aren't obvious is because it's tiled pixel art, which has the side benefit of making it really easy to create unique rooms once you have your tiles.

In order to make the walls/floor have some variety in each level they likely used an autotiling system i.e. if I'm this tile I can pick from these tiles to go beside me. This a function handily built into engines like unity."

gamedev,ff2x0xr,t1_ff2w1w4,1579527300.0,"You might be surprised at how bad the code you learn on those udemy courses is. 

I got started coding a couple of years ago using the gamedev TV courses there and thought it was great. Nowadays I see their bad practices sticking out of my old code like a sore thumb.

For me they were still worth doing , as they get me over a lot of coding speed bumps (even if their videos need a serious edit). Plus if you never write bad code when you're starting out you won't get the satisfaction of improving it later and feeling very clever indeed."

Turns out the doctor had literally sat me in the wrong room. That was the first of three times that night I had to go and find a nurse myself whilst barely able to walk from pain in my abdomen, only to find out that 'whoops my notes hadn't been passed on' or some other mishap of communication. I can see why this woman might have felt absolutely desperate."

If the modern US army turned on it's citizens, you could have all the privately owned guns you like; they'll still have tanks, planes, drones and a highly sophisticated logistics network.

Much like the rebels in Syria or other similar nations, the citizens would rely on support from other nations to fight against their own army. Like Russia/China."

This drives me nuts. I'm from Cambridge and every single restaurant in the town centre bar about five are chains of some kind. And the ones that aren't chains think they've got michelin stars and charge a fortune for what amounts to steak and chips (£4 extra for the chips btw).

We get the odd unique place, but renting a restaurant property is prohibitively expensive, so most individual businesses shut down pretty quick."

Have you been here for the past five years? It's been oven hot for long periods, at least in the south.
