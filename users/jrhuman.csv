dankmemes,ff8vakh,t1_ff8usac,1579697294.0,i know it is a joke but saying youre homophobic only to certain types if people is actually equivalent of saying i am a vegetarian person but i occasionally eat eggs. it was quiet relevant.

facepalm,fe7lont,t1_fe4lsqb,1578916237.0,"The thing is, 382 so people were named Abcde from 1950 to 2014 in the USA. So yes its an unpopular name but it is a name, some names might not make sense but still you cannot say that something is un-allowed. Like I said, the child can talk to their parent if they want the name changed. And im not debating over the name being obnoxious or not, its only a matter of opinion. And the name ""Abcde"" is not in the same league as names like Vagina or Asswipe, theres a difference between Obnoxious and Inappropriate."

You might find Asian names weird but that does not mean the parents cannot name the child a certain way. They are allowed to do so. If the child has problems with it, they can tell their parents about it and im sure most will agree to get it changed otherwise as an adult they can do it anyways without the parent."
