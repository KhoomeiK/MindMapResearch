I would love if you did this. Please PM me and update me when you get things started."
flowers,ffarktq,t3_esb83b,1579742843.0,"Oh god don't walk through a large shrub of these. They're super sticky and will attach themselves to your hair and clothes. I grew up with a huge one of these plants in my backyard. They're like the glitter of plants. Pretty, though."
cats,ff47d03,t1_ff3hadv,1579557142.0,"Please, next time you're at a pet store that has an affiliated pet charity, just buy and donate a couple of cans of wet food for the kitties they take care of. Our cats are being so spoiled because the humane society I volunteer for has given us so much. I just want the same love for all the kitties waiting for homes. -OPs wife"

homestead,fe3m2ow,t1_fe229wk,1578850570.0,I guess. The insurance adjuster said it was likely the age of the fireplace settling and creating cracks in the chimney to let whatever heat escape into the attic.
pho,fe0cyl0,t3_enj68f,1578810263.0,Where? Was it worth going back? I shop at Buford hwy farmers market all the time but don't make the effort to eat out there
homestead,fe06yta,t1_fdzvsqw,1578804672.0,"Right. Also I got carbon monoxide poisoning from a wall heater about 12 years ago so when we moved in, I made sure we got one."
homestead,fdzg0z5,t1_fdzdj3h,1578789893.0,Close! Georgia.
homestead,fdz2c82,t1_fdyiwwq,1578785941.0,All mustaches. Every single one. It was like being in the air force again.
homestead,fdz26h5,t1_fdymv2b,1578785886.0,Lol
homestead,fdz1k5h,t1_fdyy4g6,1578785771.0,"It was a fireplace insert seemingly from the early 90s.

The wood a lot of the time was ""wet/green/unseasoned"" but the fire was always hot (also another thing we've learned- seasoned wood is important for things other than burning better). The trees used that night specifically had been down and dead for long, but rained on.

We cleaned with a chimney brush from the top and bottom.

So, you know- I just want other people to learn from our mistakes. 

BUY A CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTOR if you don't have one already. Those are what woke us up, not the smoke detectors."
homestead,fdyx71p,t1_fdyip5g,1578784465.0,"Mmm, that cleaning doesn't mean there aren't cracks in the chimney and just cleaning it didn't really matter.  So... Get someone to inspect and make sure the chimney is sound (a thought that had never occurred to me) and clean however often is necessary I suppose. 

But really though if we ever have a fireplace again we're getting it professionally done."
homestead,fdy0sm9,t3_en88ud,1578774866.0,"Yes this is my house. We swept this chimney last year ourselves. Obviously we learned our lesson. Both humans are okay physically. We were able to get some cats and a dog out. Some died. The livestock was far enough away that they're all okay.

I saved all my meat birds from the freezer in the crawlspace though!"
homestead,fdh6ia3,t1_fdgtow8,1578416431.0,Yeah we're 20 miles off the state line
homestead,fdfipen,t3_ekw3wa,1578362627.0,i'm about 2 hours southwest of you- about 15 minutes away from carrollton if you know it.

redneckengineering,fc7nfyq,t1_fc7hnw3,1577513310.0,"um... got any of these tire-hinges nearby you can take a picture of? asking for a friend...

i just removed 8 tires from my property and then found two more. hinges are expensive :("
ChronicPain,fc1u14a,t1_fc10gmi,1577329695.0,">Iâ€™m planning my flight and visit to Monterrey, Mexico to get 2 of my meds over the counter and go see a doc for the others

I don't want to write my whole spiel of why I feel like I gotta do this too, but... why didn't I think about this before? It just never occurred to me that the Soma and Tramadol I used to be blessed with might be OTC somewhere else."
