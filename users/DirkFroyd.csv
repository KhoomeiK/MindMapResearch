The middle port is for every other function, like smaller current measurements, voltage measurements, resistance, and frequency.

Note that the middle port is fused, which means if you measure something over 200mA (like if you short a large capacitor), it'll blow the fuse. You can replace the fuses with some work. The left port has no fuse, so if you measure something with more than 10 A (like shorting mains power), you'll destroy the device."

Each project gets about 100 drains, and it gets knocked out in an afternoon. I've helped on 3 of these projects.

The best one was the beautification of a park project. The guy had 40 people helping, split into 8 groups each with a truck and trailer. We installed new tables at each of 20 pavilions, geotagged them, stenciled their number on the concrete, and cleared the roads leading to them. We also installed a dozen park benches and geotagged those. The guy was using walkie talkies to coordinate all the groups and sites, and didn't have any major issues.
