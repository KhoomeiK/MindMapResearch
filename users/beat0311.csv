\- Are they are interested in growing? See if they have any other opens. Ask about their long term growth plans. If I asked my previous employer, I would have been told no (or they are happy with the growth they have). At my new employer, they are 125 employees and have over 60 openings (and two recruiters). These positions were open due to growth. 

\- Office Space. Is it nice? My former employer had no interested in making the office space nicer. Not, even painting it. It was in a shitty building with a landlord to match. During my first two years of working there, the office roof leaked whenever it rained. Always ask to use the bathroom to see the conditions. At my new company, they moved into a very nice office and offer drinks, snacks, and supplies to make your breakfast.

\- What is their plans with your role, long term? If I was smart/brave to ask my former employer, they wouldn't have an answer. Because of that, they did not know when to promote me or when give me a raise to match that promotion. I was their ""guinea pig"". The people who had the role previous to me never care about advancing. If they don't have an answer to this question, I would be cautious to work for them if you are interested in developing yourself or be more proactive and take the lead. In my new role, my manager told me when X happens and Y happens you will get promoted. As long as I work hard, I will get promoted within in a year. She hired me based on their current needs and future needs. You want an employer that see you helping them today and in the future. 

\- How long has the people who are interviewing with you stay at the company? Be afraid of people who haven't left the company or the current company has been their only employer. 

\- Leadership experience. My former company had many people in their specific roles for the first time. Again, a sign that they had no experience and did not look to the outside for experience. Lack of experience means the employer can give them a lower starting salary. 

Be mindful of repeat questions being asked by the different people you are being interviewed for.  For example, in my former employer we always asked ""How do you feel about working with difficult people?"" It depends on what are they are concerned about. Can you deal with an asshole (which was the case in my company) or a person that does not say  thank you or please before asking you to do something. Usually, at interview, they will try to tell you the worst case to see if you can okay with working with them."
orangetheory,fcodlhf,t1_fcnv83i,1577829646.0,Love this mindset.
orangetheory,fcodign,t3_ei4ps4,1577829585.0,You can do it. Weight journey isn't perfect or straight. Weight loss is 80% diet. I only use OTF to deal with stress.
fatlogic,fcisqrg,t1_fchplow,1577668919.0,I would take it and then throw it in the trash later (without them knowing it).
fatlogic,fcisiih,t1_fcga64z,1577668771.0,I love this.
fatlogic,fcirgsv,t1_fcg16wt,1577668067.0,"I am experiencing the same thing and F\*)\_ hate it. If I decide to not drink alcoholic, no one would ask me questions on a regular basic about it. If they do ask you about it, it would one or two times."
orangetheory,faydgi9,t1_faon70y,1576398930.0,My last OTF class did this and I loved it. The two coaches even switched role each block (so the one that calling transition was checking form and the one checking form was calling transitions). I wish they do this for 3G classes (or at least the evening classes).
