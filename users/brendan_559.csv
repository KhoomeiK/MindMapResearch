gatesopencomeonin,fehvj6c,t1_fehuwe7,1579124710.0,"Well that also means you have to pay teachers a good salary ($45,000 starting salary is not going to attract most master's degree graduates) as well as reform the entire way the way schools teach to allow for more engagement with the material, all of which would require years of experts testing, costing lots of money.

Also, the bigger issue is with higher education, not K-12. Higher Ed is a much more difficult thing to deal with as many of them focus heavily on profits, even if they're ""non-profit"" companies."

gatesopencomeonin,fehmhn3,t1_fehle2p,1579119543.0,"I think that we should double the minimum wage slowly over time, not all at once. Also, why shouldn't you get paid more? You're a licensed professional getting paid $30,000 a year? That doesn't make sense. Average, middle-class Americans have been getting fucked by the upper-class for years as they increase medication prices, healthcare costs, and education (just as the main issues) to increase their own profits. I don't give a fuck if Purdue pharma shareholders turn a 300% profit, but I do care if people can't buy insulin. I think you're getting mad at the wrong people here"
gatesopencomeonin,fehm2tn,t1_fehklla,1579119305.0,"Firstly, many other countries have raised their minimum wage in the past few years including Sweden, the UK, Canada, and many others. All of them saw economic growth and a decrease in unemployment and poverty while keeping national costs of goods about the same. The idea that increased minimum wage causes inflation makes sense, but it simply isn't true according to the data.

Secondly, you don't need to increase the wages of higher-level workers. There is absolutely no reason why university administrators need to make the amount they do. I work for an admin at a public university who makes an annual salary of about a half million a year. She comes in around 10am, leaves around 3pm, and has a full staff of grad students who do most of her daily work for her. She really just sits down with other wealthy people and asks them for their money as ""donations"" to the school. She also didn't work very hard for her job as she is the daughter of the school president's beat friend. She was given her position after she graduated with a master's degree in Asian cultural studies at the age of 26. Fire her and the countless people like her, plus all their staff, and reduce the insane salaries of these people in admin positions. You'll quickly find the money to cut the costs of higher education."
gatesopencomeonin,fehkxzu,t1_fehk8yj,1579118647.0,"I agree. We shouldn't pay to send people to universities. That was what my first comment was about. Students should get less federal aid. I think that a better way to get a better-educated workforce is to increase minimum wage and place restrictions on the cost of public universities. That way the taxpayers don't have to pay for college for random people, but anyone who is willing to work a part time job can pay their way through school.

I currently work a full time job for $10.50 an hour and I'm a full time student taking 18-21 credits a semester at an in-state, public university. I'm still over $25,000 in debt after 2 years. In my opinion, students shouldn't have to work full time and still go into this much debt."
gatesopencomeonin,fehk0wv,t1_fehjj6q,1579118120.0,"Unfortunately, issues like this are by state. The federal government has no major restrictions on the price of university tuition, and the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. The states are allowed to determine restrictions on public university costs and minimum wage, and most states simply aren't doing enough"
gatesopencomeonin,fehjvhk,t1_fehjihc,1579118034.0,"Which often doesn't supply people with a bachelor's degrees, and some of them don't even supply associate's degrees.

gatesopencomeonin,fehiz9x,t1_fehickr,1579117508.0,"That's just not true. Countless studies have proven that increased minimum wages don't lead to the same level of increased inflation. A study by the Upjohn institute shows that for every 10% wage increase, inflation increases only by 0.36%. if we doubled the national minimum wage from $7.25 to $14.50, inflation would only rise 3.6%.

To put that in context, a current worker at McDonald's could buy about 7 cheeseburgers after a 1 hour shift. If we doubled minimum wage and adjusted inflation, they would still be able to buy 14 cheeseburgers for the same amount of work.

[Source](https://www.upjohn.org/research-highlights/does-increasing-minimum-wage-lead-higher-prices)"
gatesopencomeonin,fehgteq,t1_feh4752,1579116241.0,"Yes please. Rather than trying to make college free for everyone or even those who qualify for federal aid, why don't we just raise the minimum wage and restrict the price of public universities? Instead of giving just some people help with college, let's make it so anyone who's willing to work 20 hours a week can afford to pay for school. This way it helps any young people who decide to go to college or not, and the only people really getting hurt by this are slumlords, college admins getting paid a half million a year, and corporate admins getting paid even more. Education should not be made for profit, but for creating a generation more fair and educated than the last.

Edit: It is clear to me that people aren't reading my comment at all, and are instead just assuming that I support publicly-subsidized college. Please just read the comment I made before claiming I'm going to take your hard-earned money or something."

AbandonedPorn,fdkidra,t1_fdkbac1,1578504446.0,"While you're right about mixing various forms from different eras, that isn't uncommon. Even during the Gothic period there was countless variations of the Gothic style, mostly depending on the region of Europe it was created in. Most people just associate the Gothic style with the Early Gothic in France, like Notre Dame. The biggest thing here is the windows. They are definitely not from the Gothic period for the reason you said: they don't depict any kind of nobility or Christian theme. I don't completely understand what you mean by mixing Gothic and Roman Catholic  style, since the Gothic cathedrals were made by Roman Catholics, so they would put statues and depictions of Catholic saints everywhere, including on the outside of many Gothic cathedrals like the Chartres Cathedral. I think that this image is real (even if slightly altered) and it's most likely a neo-gothic structure from the late 1800s. After the reconstruction of Notre Dame during the mid 1800s, people loved the Gothic style again and tried recreating it with tons of different stylistic changes like adding gargoyles, more elaborate reliefs along the outside of the building, and stained glass without depictions (like these ones.)

It's probably not fake, but it's definitely not from the Gothic period
