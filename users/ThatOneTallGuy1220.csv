offmychest,fco6l3o,t1_fcna0b8,1577825055.0,Posting on here or the struggles of being alone? I think I'm confused lmao.
offmychest,fcn55hy,t1_fcn4e0m,1577803539.0,"The human touch is something powerful and I crave it. I give high Fives and fist bumps to everyone at school and they just think I'm being nice but I'm holding back my desire to just bear hug someone. I want to cuddle with someone every night and it kills me. I hate that I'm so awkward lmao. I don't like talking to them, but I feel safe around them. Which is weird because technically your the safest when your alone but it's just so comforting to have someone there."
offmychest,fcn4asl,t3_ei1sau,1577802874.0,"Tbh, I can relate. I hate being alone. But yet I'm an introvert. I like being alone in a room with other people if that makes sense. I like listening and being by myself with other folks around. I guess it just love the comfort and sense of security humans bring but I don't like interacting with them. I think about cuddling with my pillows sometimes. I want to hold someone so badly."
offmychest,fcn3a57,t3_ei2wvt,1577802065.0,You have the courage that I'll never have. I hope everything goes okay! I'm proud of you nevertheless!
offmychest,fcn2yve,t3_ehxvgw,1577801814.0,I'm so proud of you! You made my day. Please keep it up!
offmychest,fcn05qw,t3_ei1h4z,1577799348.0,Take control of your situation and get proper help before you do something you (might) regret buddy. Please.
offmychest,fcmzdof,t3_ei0z2e,1577798586.0,"Thank you for clarifying that. People don't realize that a few people that can mess up or create a stereotype of an entire group or people and racists, homophobes, masojanists, etc. Eat this stuff up. Then they can have a reason to hate a group of people. ""I hate black people because they are all violent "" Or ""I hate homosexuals cuz they are all loud and obnoxious"". These are common misconceptions that are labeled onto African Americans or the LGBTQ+community. Not all of them are violent and all homosexuals are loud. It's just mind boggling how people are so quick to hate and judge. I'll never understand it lmao."
offmychest,fcmxa10,t1_fcmw2of,1577796348.0,"Woa, how did u go on that long without them finding out?"
offmychest,fcmx7s7,t3_ei1wcd,1577796280.0,"Everything u said is so true. The world is rigged and there's not much we can do to stop it. I've lost my faith in humanity, as in now it seems like everything is about selfishness and money. We are literally killing the planet and not enough people care to actually do something about it. I wish we would hurry up and wipe ourselves of the face of the earth already. Extinction seems like the best option rn tbh."
offmychest,fcmwpqt,t3_ehzzpr,1577795692.0,"I hate it when gamers get mad at people for being bad. It's not right, not everyone is supposed to automatically have the same skills as you like wtf. So inconsiderate. So ignorant. If it makes u feel any better, most of my friends are gamers and I'm not nearly as bad as they think I am and I use this to mess with them when they are being jerks lmao."
offmychest,fcmw8u5,t3_ehjuor,1577795130.0,"It's not the fact that his child is a girl, it's the fact that's it's a child.  Some of y'all women just love starting sh*t when it comes to gender like damn. I also fail to see how watching porn isn't respecting women. People in the porn industry do what they gotta do and it doesn't make them any less human or any less important."
