OldSchoolCool,ffalo8q,t3_esedzg,1579738857.0,I used to do the same as a little kid. Then I ended up 15yrs old with DDDDs and had to get a reduction. It was a little bit of a self fulfilling prophecy 😂
GestationalDiabetes,ffaldoq,t3_esgqgs,1579738652.0,I am 33 weeks and have GD and mild poly hydraminos. Today I saw the OB and my fundal height was measuring at 41 weeks 😳 they didn’t seem very concerned about it though. I told them my BS numbers and they weren’t worried about it even when I have a few high ones. I can’t give much more advice other than try to think positive and know that it’s all going to be ok.
Parenting,ff9v01i,t1_ff9oh7w,1579722048.0,You’re totally right. I don’t want to make a rash decision and my hormones are raging right now plus I’m in a lot of pain all the time. My husband just wants me to be happy. It’s a lot of extra work on him to take care of me so I definitely think he has a say but maybe our minds will change.

tifu,ff9bx6x,t3_es97f2,1579709458.0,Hahahahaha funny story: when my husband and I first started seeing each other casually before we were official I used to leave my hair ties at his place on his night stand to mark my territory.  There was this other girl who was really into him and I wanted to make sure if he brought her home she knew I’d been there first lol. I’ve since told him I did that and he thought it was hilarious. He also said the other chick never stood a chance 😂
atheism,ff9bj56,t3_es3kvn,1579709201.0,Tbh I feel the same. I’m tolerant in the way that if they choose to be willfully ignorant then I’m not going to stop them or say anything but deep down I’m silently judging them because their beliefs are so asinine to me.
Parenting,ff9819j,t3_es9dr0,1579706987.0,I’m worried the same will happen to us. I’m currently 33weeks with our first and it has not been an easy pregnancy. I’m in pain constantly since 20 weeks due to SPD and now I have GD. I am slowly losing my mind bc of the added stress and discomfort. I’ve said it and my husband has agreed we’re going to be one and done. But I know that my hormones and ovaries might try to convince me that it wasn’t that bad in a few years and I might be tempted to have another. We’ve discussed my husband having a vasectomy bc I don’t do well on birth control and refuse to get an IUD but I’m worried if we go through with the vasectomy we will regret it. We never thought we’d be able to get pregnant in the first place so we’re very happy to be having a baby but I seriously didn’t think it would affect my body so severely. No one thinks it’ll happen to them until it does. Sigh. I guess I have time to figure it all out.

There’s not much they can do. It’s the hormones and pressure from the weight of the baby that are making the bones spread too much and putting too much tension on the ligament. I have a prenatal massage scheduled for Friday that I’m desperately looking forward to."
GestationalDiabetes,ff7pf63,t1_ff7bim4,1579655134.0,Mine was a fluke they picked up too at 30 weeks. I had passed the 1 hr and all my urine tests were normal. They noticed how big my son was measuring on the ultrasounds and had me do the 3hr which I failed the first two readings. I know how frustrating and emotional it is when you think you’re clear in the home stretch and then this happens. I won’t even pretend I have it all figured out. I’m just trying to survive the next 6 weeks till they induce me!

Documentaries,ff3r0ge,t1_ff2z5b4,1579546982.0,"I don’t think the body positivity movement is about trying to get people to become overweight. It’s more so about not shaming people simply because they’re overweight. Most people who same those that are overweight use the guise of concern about the health of the overweight individual as a cover for their disgust at their outward appearance. There are a lot of factors that come into play when it comes to how excess weight affects an individual’s body. Some people are considered morbidly obese on the BMI scale but because it is a flawed system and doesn’t take into account having more muscle it classifies these people incorrectly. Clearly this woman is a testament to what can go wrong when you’re morbidly obese. She did choose to live her life the way she did like you said, however, that has nothing to do with the type of person she was. That’s what the body positivity movement is about- not tying your self-worth or how good of a person you are to your outward appearance. Health is whole other can of worms. But most of the time people are criticizing the appearance, not the health of individuals and their judgment is totally unwarranted and unhelpful."

Parenting,ff2uctp,t3_er8hoo,1579524506.0,"Don’t. You. Dare. Feel. Guilty. 

Next time someone calls you that you say “at least I’m not a stuck up breastfeeding mom”!

I had a reduction when I was 15. I don’t know if I’ll be able to properly breast feed either. I’ve also had a really stressful pregnancy dealing with gestational diabetes and SPD pain on a daily basis. They have both consumed my life in such negative ways. I was told recently that I am definitely going to be induced by 39 weeks (which I was always super against but I guess it’s what happens when you have GD) or if my son continues to grow at the rate he is (6lbs at only 32 weeks) that they’re going to do a csection so he doesn’t have shoulder dystocia. I don’t want one more negative thing to happen surrounding my body. I don’t want to resent my son. Part of me doesn’t even want to try breast feeding bc I’m tired and just want to enjoy my son. My husband is SUPER helpful and has even said if I can’t breastfeed he looks forward to being able to get up and feed him so I can sleep (I married an amazing guy). But I got my free pump so I’m going to at least give it a week or two. But I’ve decided I’m not pushing myself. If it isn’t working I’m switching to formula and anyone who gives me a side eye or snarky comment will be promptly shanked!"

My only solace is that they won’t let me go past 39 weeks bc I have GD (hence his size) and I’m genuinely hoping they pull me even sooner for a csection bc of his size.
