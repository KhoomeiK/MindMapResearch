0.4% of his HP would be worse than the prior minimum damage requirement (to achieve 1% shock) at 296,000 damage. Edit: That's better than the old requirement for 5% shock, but as a new minimum it would not be good, hence the ""Ailment Threshold"" multiplier which shrinks the HP pool from 74,000,000 to some unknown value as far as determining the strength of ailment afflicted is concerned.

Also they just increased armor values across the board by up to ~2700% (27X) in some cases, which would reduce the magnitude of physical hits."
PathOfExileBuilds,fep2bx9,t1_fep0g6k,1579310563.0,"> 3.9 introduced different ailment scaling values separate from boss HP so builds could more reliably shock and chill.

They also raised the minimum shock effect you must achieve from 1% to 5% while lowering the required damage to compensate. 

>We've added an Ailment Threshold to monsters. In the great majority of cases, the Ailment Threshold matches the monster's Maximum Life. It primarily differs for especially high-life monsters (such as The Shaper), where the threshold is reduced to allow ailments to be applied with hits that wouldn't ordinarily reach the required Life thresholds.
The minimum Shock and Chill value is now 5% (from 1%). To reach the minimum, you must deal 0.4% of a monster's Ailment Threshold with the associated element in a single hit.

Without knowing what these ""Ailment Threshold"" values are, it's difficult to speculate how much damage is now required.
 
> that shock value progressively increases as your new damage is able to meet higher and higher thresholds as the fight continues while the enemy is shocked.

That kind of blows the theory that you can easily model shock in PoB by adding a damage modifier to Starforge out of the water."
PathOfExileBuilds,feozynr,t1_feovgtk,1579309066.0,"And if you care about more than 1 boss you'd need one per HP pool/resist profile/armor.

According to the wiki, Shaper/Elder have ~74,000,000 HP, and with Starforge equipped Don's build does 32,214 average non-crit damage, so only crits (132,080 average crit) can shock, and many are going to be too low to even meet the minimum shock threshold. That's assuming the (newly buffed) armor values are already accounted for, which I don't believe they are according to the note on the boss dropdown and accompanying ""phys damage reduction"" box.

PoB shows his MH dmg range caps at 42,917 with a 4.1x crit multiplier, or 175,960 *max* crit.

In conclusion, with comparable gear and this build, you *might* get 1-1.5% shock on end-game bosses assuming no phys reduction.

This is all predicated on me having some understanding of the shock mechanics and PoB, which is admittedly sketchy. Feel free to look at the numbers yourself.

Edit: To get the 5% shock you mentioned earlier, you need to be critting the boss for 1% of it's HP, or 740,000 in the case of Shaper/Elder."
