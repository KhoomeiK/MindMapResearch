Dreams,fcis4b2,t1_fcht7jn,1577668506.0,Wow. Way to go! Dreams are amazing. This is a great example of that. Also do you mind if I draw the scene you described? And would you be able to give some more description to the aliens?

LucidDreaming,fbc9zkh,t3_ecd2t7,1576719155.0,"I ask this question every single day! I've kept dream journals for 10 years and have been Lucid dreaming regularly for about 6. Dreams in general fascinate me that's why I made a YouTube channel for dreams. 

Here's an example: https://youtu.be/f6DqA42Vv0E

But I doubt that it'll get popular because I don't plan on monetizing it, and I have a full time job.

But I really love talking about dreams and Lucid dreams to others. 
I even talk about dreams to random people.
Such as waiters, baristas, or even people on the bus, or in the park. I'm kind of known as the dream guy to my friends and family.

Let me know if you have any interesting dream creatures you'd like to see drawn."
