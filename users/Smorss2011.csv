KindVoice,fdeux9i,t1_fdef8k0,1578347120.0,"I don't know if you are male, female, or other, but there IS hope. What city are you in? You are posting for a reason, and that reason is that you have some semblance of hope."
KindVoice,fdeupes,t1_fdef31a,1578346990.0,"Eviction is common. Reacting by ending your life points to a bigger problem. Do you have a job? Family or friends? Education? I agree with others, look up county, city, state, federal resources. Contact charities. Call 911 and tell them you are suicidal, they will get you medical care, because often this is depression, which is a medical condition, just like addiction, a broken arm, or cancer. No shame."
KindVoice,fdby1em,t3_ekgegw,1578263618.0,"People operate out of their own heads, and most people cannot be bothered to change their perspective, thereby changing their behavior. They are the losers, not you. 

Be your own self, I promise if you are your best self and get out into the real world, you will meet people who appreciate you. 

Do whatever sociable things you enjoy, volunteer, take risks. And never give up because someone else is not able to be a better person. That is not your problem."
maninthehighcastle,fdbwkdk,t1_fd65nsf,1578262960.0,"Haha, hilarious that someone needed to downvote my perspective. People crack me up."
maninthehighcastle,fdbwfe6,t1_fd65nsf,1578262880.0,"I think HE cost them those things. He ignored his own moral compass, and could have saved Thomas, by leaving with the family. His ego was bigger than his love. Good points, however."
KindVoice,fcyp8r9,t1_fcx7dam,1578084310.0,You never know what people are going through in their private lives. Especially around the holidays.

AmItheAsshole,fc6w4t5,t1_fc6tqic,1577491028.0,Did she value HIS feelings?
AmItheAsshole,fc6nvbe,t1_fc1d2ns,1577485047.0,But they didn't move on. She still thought it was no big deal. That's a fail.
AmItheAsshole,fc6my75,t1_fc39w9l,1577484399.0,Selfish? How?
AmItheAsshole,fc6mt7u,t1_fc2k8zf,1577484302.0,"We all see the world through our own glasses. His wife said she did not think it was that bad. And I doubt I could tell the difference between identical twins I did not know well. But that's really the point, this is their daughter's husband, and they should be trying to get to know him as much as he's tried."
AmItheAsshole,fc6mlhq,t1_fc1avpg,1577484150.0,"They won't. But you'll always have Christmas '19. If they don't think it's funny and thought-provoking, you don't want to waste your time on them. I don't think their lack of social skills necessarily equates to not liking you. They don't even know you! I've been there, and know that people get wrapped up in their own heads when they are around family, and that is a universal human failing. However, for your marriage, you should definitely do whatever your wife wants you to do in order to normalize things.

(just a fantasy) I would want to make a life-sized cardboard cutout of myself, and have my spouse bring it through the door at the next family gathering, a couple of minutes before I walk through the door. Spouse could tell them they now have a likeness to ignore, but please talk to me. It might make them laugh and break the ice."
KindVoice,fc52enz,t3_eg195q,1577439584.0,"You are handsome! You need to build up some self-confidence and drive your social life. Volunteer, use online dating, take a class. You will meet people, and don't be afraid to ask them to have coffee, lunch, etc. try meetup.com for activities. You'll be fine."
Chriswatts,fc2d35g,t3_d6merk,1577353121.0,"The most riveting art is immediately after they anger the house. On the left, you see a partially formed person walk quickly down the stairs and disappear. Plain as day."

offmychest,fc0zmvt,t1_fc0zfzt,1577304055.0,It is devastating when you realize you are considered an object by your own vapid parents. But having so much less abuse really helped me thrive. You will too.
offmychest,fc0yt7g,t1_fc0nktd,1577303386.0,"Do you want to reconcile? Maybe it's a day to send a note of gratitude. I know I am a stranger, but I have depression to, it is quite severe. Ketamine is the only thing that helped pull me back into life. It is now covered by insurance. More than 50% of treatment-resistant depression cases are relieved with this treatment. My best to you."

offmychest,fc0y9is,t1_fc0tuhi,1577302944.0,"I did it with my dad. Best decision ever. He was so bothered by losing his favorite punching bag that he ""disowned"" me in his will. Hilarious as he had nothing to give but debt. Well, he's dead now, and all I have to do now is navigate my mom. It is lonelier being with people who don't love you than it is being alone."

You could always pick up a pie and say ""I'd like to swing by to give you a small gift"", and they would certainly want you to stay. Most people probably think you have plans. We all get so wrapped up in our own heads that we forget to ask about others. I wish you a new year filled with love."
