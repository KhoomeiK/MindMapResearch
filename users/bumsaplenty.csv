A lot of things became surprisingly easier for me, especially compared to how I was at my highest weight (like I don't get thigh chafing anymore and honestly the first time I climbed up the tube escalator stairs after weightloss, I felt like I was flying) but it did bring unexpected problems too.

Like, I wasn't used to my new body and would throw myself around like I was still big. Badly bruised my coccyx once from hurling myself onto a chair as I didn't realise I had lost adipose padding that was my giant arse. It also became really obvious how being overweight had ruined my posture - nerd neck, tilted back, awkward gait. As I didn't initially try to sort it out, I ended up with some ongoing issues. Losing that last bit of excess weight did make exercise soooo much easier, especially when it came to exercising the muscles needed to fix my posture.

From a purely mechanical point of view, I'm sure losing the extra weight will lessen the load bear and thus the friction too but I do also recommend checking if there are other things that can help with that as well.

For example, my friend was very big when she went to have her knee pain examined and they found that her kneecaps were not in the right place, causing her to walk on the ball of her foot and so bringing on a whole host of other joint issues as well. They said that the misalignment shouldn't have been an issue if she was healthy weight (unless she fell hard on her knees or something). Thanks to the physiotherapy and the three stone loss, she says she's the best she's ever been."

I had a friend that I went to Japan with for three months and though she was big, she was not unusual for the UK. She said it was a shock seeing the pictures we took in Japan and realising how big she really was in comparison to all our friends there. Just to point out, the ridiculously skinny image most people have of Japanese people is actually quite rare. As my friend noticed too, it's more like the average person is healthy weight but just without the extra flabby rolls we're used to seeing on people back home (stuff like back fat poking over bras, muffin tops, bingo wings etc - all of which I have despite being healthy bmi). When we eventually got back home, it was a big shock to see how much bigger the average sized British person is, and my friend (who lost a fair amount of weight in Japan) is now starting to resent the subtle, though well-meant, encouragement she's been getting to stay as big as she is. For both her physical and mental health, I hope she can stay strong against that kind pressure."

Even with the bmi scale, people don't realised how wide the healthy range is. It was the same for me when I was made aware that at bmi 24 I was still overweight for my ethnicity, my aunt just couldn't wrap her head around the fact that at my then weight, I planned to get even lighter (to be fair I'm also really short). Having lost what I needed, I honestly don't look that different. I'm a healthy bmi and all it did was just shave some blub off my hips (and more significantly, off my organs)."

fatlogic,fc4k2wg,t1_fbqrspy,1577418970.0,That piece of misinformation got me too as a teen. Had been told at school that  women (I swear they didn't specify the average woman) need 2000 cals but I failed to realise that for my short arse that's a fast track to obesity.
