environment,fecvj71,t1_fecs8vk,1578986298.0,"Lmao. It doesn‚Äôt matter that your individual contributions amount to nothing compared to producers, because they average 10x as much as the rest of the world. It doesn‚Äôt matter that you‚Äôre a broke college student (so am I) because you and I and nearly every other American use way too many resources, despite being ‚Äúbroke‚Äù. 

I highly doubt that you‚Äôre doing as much as you can. If you are, that‚Äôs fucking awesome. I‚Äôm happy that you care enough to help reduce your carbon footprint and waste. Most people are too selfish, or like you, they feel the impact from a single person is not enough to make a difference that‚Äôs worthwhile. 

And those are exactly the reasons that it‚Äôs almost too late for individual changes to make an impact. If every individual who had even a shred of guilt 30, 40 years ago really did as much as they could to reduce their resource use, waste, and carbon footprint, then the world would be a very different place. Simply by reducing the amount of water that fills your toilet can save thousands of gallons of freshwater a year. Re-purposing food containers, water bottles, changing lightbulbs, growing your own food, reducing meat consumption. Buying used clothes, phones and computers and cars and school supplies. There are dozens and dozens of tiny changes that individuals can **still** make to help the planet out. And if people really started decades ago, the atmosphere and environment would be much better off than it is now. 

Pushing the blame entirely onto mega corporations is pathetic and weak. If you truly cared, there are plenty of things to do. But people don‚Äôt care. Or they don‚Äôt feel like their life makes a difference. But if all of those people made a difference, it would show. Consumers influence the market. That‚Äôs why huge companies like LEGO and Subaru are trying to be carbon-neutral/negative now. Others are beginning to follow suit. 

Yes, unregulated hypercapitalism is fucking corrupt, greedy, and disgusting. But those big corporations only got big because of apathetic, lazy, dispssionate consumers who chose convenience over care. It‚Äôs a bit different now, seeing as these companies basically control the entire political landscape. But you and I and everyone else can still make an impact. It‚Äôs not as if companies will keep producing things that don‚Äôt sell. And those that do produce ethically and responsibly will grow, so long as consumers care enough to buy from them. Eventually, things will get cheaper. But for now, we have to spend more on things that aren‚Äôt cheaper, despite being better for the environment. 

Corporations are greedy, but regular people encourage that greed."
jobs,fecuezd,t1_fecrxil,1578985027.0,"Yeah, school sucked. I have a feeling it‚Äôs less the teachers‚Äô faults (most of them, anyway) and more how the school system works. Teachers can be very restricted in both scope and quality, and because of standardized testing, they have to make students memorize a lot of things very quickly before tests, and then move on to the next topics. It‚Äôs quantity over quality, and the quantity only lasts for so long. The knowledge never gets integrated, so most of it lasts all of two months. 

Most teachers would probably be memorable and impactful  if they could actually teach, rather than tell, if that makes sense. I‚Äôve had a total of 2 or 3 teachers leave a visible impact on me, and one‚Äôs name I have trouble remembering most of the time. But he gave me a copy of Fight Club and introduced me to my first girlfriend (most definitely knowing that we would end up together), and that‚Äôs enough, really. He also made me realize how smart I was compared to the majority of kids in my grade."

People don‚Äôt give enough of a shit about where their things come from. They don‚Äôt care enough to sacrifice the convenience and ease of access. Regular people buy unethically sourced products. They don‚Äôt give a shit. Convenience is King. That‚Äôs it.
