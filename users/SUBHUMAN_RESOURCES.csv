AskReddit,ff57uj5,t3_erili0,1579582788.0,I wish I had the kind of job that actually had enough downtime to make this a reality.  They're killing me.

todayilearned,ff12qqs,t1_ff0wxxw,1579474659.0,Yep.  External market almost always outpaces whatever is going on internally.  Just don't hop too often unless you have such a hot skill set that it doesn't matter.
todayilearned,fezri99,t1_fezp08u,1579460724.0,"No, I don't think anyone has that as an objective.  It's just more practical since without a retirement benefit there is no reason to remain in one place longer than a few years."

AskReddit,fet3t3j,t1_fepyvhd,1579371556.0,"Absolutely.  Trying to put together a cover of their hits makes it pretty apparent what was going on, lol"
SeriousConversation,fep700h,t3_eq3bao,1579313550.0,"I’m sorry for your loss.

You might just need time to process this.  Sometimes I have no reaction to things like this and then later on it will hit me all at once.  Everyone processes things differently.  I don't think anything is wrong with you."

AdviceAnimals,fdvw3bg,t1_fdviqv5,1578752285.0,I don't think it's a greed thing.  People are very complicated and sexuality is weird.  I don't think you can just make a measurement of someone by their temptations or even if they have given in before.  We don't know what is going on in their life or what has happened in the past.
AskReddit,fdvuf23,t1_fdvdus2,1578751632.0,Well.  I've seen that movie an embarrassing number of times to not have noticed that.  That's pretty awesome.

I don't know how they arrive at this conclusion but they are so mad at the portrait of Washington DC as a center for corruption and misrepresentation that they ignore everything else, including the reality of who the president is."

PoliticalHumor,fdck9b1,t1_fdbjn1h,1578276985.0,"No, I'm not being hyperbolic.  Cutting people off from programs they benefit from is indeed harming them.  And YOU committed the straw man by moving my argument about people who benefit from social programs specifically to homeless."
PoliticalHumor,fdbhj90,t1_fdbgnap,1578257485.0,"Well I was going to call you out for implying only homeless people benefit from social programs, but since you outed yourself, sure."
PoliticalHumor,fdbe8c9,t1_fdb7m8f,1578256555.0,"Cutting the existing programs is indeed punishing them.  Especially when you are increasing spending elsewhere.  Entitlement programs aren’t a bad thing, we should be taking better of our citizens."
PoliticalHumor,fdb5xq2,t1_fdaxuac,1578254160.0,Punishing the elderly and poor under the guise of saving money while spending rampantly elsewhere is inhumane.

I hate the guy and want him out too but I really don't give a shit about the stupid pee tape idea.  We are dealing with people who are completely shameless and will justify ANYTHING this administration does."

They're pretty helpful if you are booking any type of big vacation that involves a flight or two, transport to and from hotel/resort, etc.  I tried to coordinate our honeymoon myself and it got real complicated real fast.

SeriousConversation,fcqxumm,t3_eifoff,1577893845.0,Stay off those platforms.  They don't do anything but waste time (lol as I browse reddit) and bum people out.  We have to find ways to spend our time on things that make us feel good.  I'm guilty of not doing this as well.

It can be people I know very well or hardly at all and I have no idea why certain people get ""selected"".  In my head I tell them stories about things in my life that are kind of interesting, stuff about weird or interesting jobs I've had, etc.  Maybe I just need to socialize more."

findapath,fc9hjzf,t3_egp0kh,1577552773.0,"Yes, everyone needs to evolve with chasing conditions in their field.  Technology, medicine, law, etc all change with time.  A career is something you build over years and years.

You might as well get comfortable with change.  I work someplace that has been resistant to change for many years.  There are people there who have done the same thing for decades without updating their skills or growing, and let me tell you, these folks have the hardest time when change does come.  You never know how it will happen but it will.  At some point there will be a big business change, new executives, a merger that turns everything upside down, a big deal falls through and you get laid off, something.  We have to be able to adapt and keep up while still growing.  I say this as someone who has their own challenges with change and is doing just what I described, trying to adapt and keep up."

wallstreetbets,fbye4pt,t1_fbydyhm,1577214613.0,Reddit told me you need at least 2M annually to afford a studio apartment in the tenderloin
wallstreetbets,fbybfar,t1_fby9tgj,1577212711.0,It may depend on industry.  In my experience it is much smaller than that but I don't know anything about teachers.

wallstreetbets,fby2bg8,t1_fby20n1,1577206381.0,"That is interesting but I have a lot of questions about whether the two jobs in those locations are really the same.  ""Intermediate back end engineer"" isn't really enough information.  Most companies I have worked for account for something like a 15% differential on base salary and maybe some added levers like bonuses or equity to be more competitive but I have never seen anything to the tube of 63%."
wallstreetbets,fby1zla,t1_fby1ri1,1577206155.0,"Right.  That's not passive, that's a job.

There is nothing to indicate they needed to stay in the area to ""manage"" that passive income.  Plus you got fucking robbed on that Nebraska salary or you were hideously overpaid in SF."
wallstreetbets,fbxyaa9,t1_fbxxwu9,1577203607.0,"Read it again.  They had 250k in income from PASSIVE sources.  No salary.  They could have set up shop in literally anywhere and had the same amount coming in.  Duh.

Plus the differential in salary between SF and most of the country is not that drastic.  There is a difference but it's not fucking double or anything crazy like that."
wallstreetbets,fbxxbdk,t1_fbxl8dt,1577202914.0,He laid out a lot of reasons but if you can't make it work at 250k/year you're an asshole.  Even with kids.  Just move out of the Bay Area for starters.  He could have lived very comfortably in just about any city with that kind of change.
