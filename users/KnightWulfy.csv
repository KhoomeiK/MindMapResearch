facepalm,fce3e86,t3_egv2jm,1577616515.0,"Not a facepalm. I've worked retail. They do this on purpose and people fall for it.

Edit: The grocery store I worked for would have ""5 Dollar Fridays!"" Where they would have a table set up full of products ""On sale for only 5 dollars!"" Which were normally 5 dollars anyway. Sold out every time."
