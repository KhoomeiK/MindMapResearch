I noticed the strange eating habits a little bit after I stopped the drinking. Initially I convinced myself it was to lose a little weight I had gained from the psych meds, and then it turned into the numbers. The scale number, the calorie number, the number of time I eat a day, the numbers lost, it just became an addiction of that. I am dumbfounded how it even happened.

I am trying to truly stop things before it gets out of hand. I do not want my mind to do that ‚Äúflip‚Äù where suddenly I‚Äôm not aware of it anymore. I see it a lot on this sub, the little comments and posts where people have truly lost it to their disordered thinking.

AnorexiaNervosa,fdosz69,t3_emh9gj,1578612189.0,"I‚Äôve never been hospitalized for disordered eating.

I eat one meal a day (omad) religiously, and I will not change that regardless of what is in front of me. My omad is never over 600 calories. I also exercise.

That‚Äôs all besides the point.

I have been hospitalized. I have been involuntarily hospitalized which is what they do when they see no other solution for a crisis. I have also been told that I should seek hospitalization by my psychiatrist and therapist, when given the option I always choose no. In my mind if they feel it‚Äôs something that won‚Äôt pass, I can‚Äôt handle on my own or will end in serious harm or death they will make the ultimate decision. If they just feel I may be heading in that direction and I‚Äôm not quite there yet I think they‚Äôre obligated to say something so they can document it.

So those are my opinions. I‚Äôm sure you are incredibly ill, but they see something in you that leads them to not involuntarily commit you. I would seek outside services and help before you‚Äôre committed involuntarily. Or commit yourself voluntarily, and don‚Äôt let it lead to an involuntary commitment.

I have a 9-5 job, bills, and responsibilities that I can‚Äôt just up and leave, but have been forced to do in the past and it seriously affects work and your self esteem.

recovery,fdliz0l,t3_elyqv3,1578525057.0,"I‚Äôve been inpatient several times and my favorite activity was always making collage and vision boards. I loved going through every magazine page and finding the perfect quote or word and then neatly cutting (yes they gave us kindergarten scissors but one place I stayed at made us rip the pages) and then organizing and gluing then onto my board. I still have them. It was my absolute favorite. I also loved if we went around the room and everyone go to share their goal board. It‚Äôs a great leisure activity and really helps to create a visual of what you‚Äôre trying to achieve. 

I also loved physical activity. When you‚Äôre inpatient you are extremely limited when it comes to physical activity and even outside time. When I was inpatient during the summer I always begged our activity therapist to just let us play outside. We would shoot hoops, hit the volleyball, throw the football and even play tag lol. We had a bags/cornhole set that we could also play with. One time we did yoga inside and while I enjoyed it most of the class hated it because yoga is far more intense that most people realize.

Things I disliked - printed ‚Äúfill in the blank‚Äù pages, anything with a ridiculous amount of reading, anything where the instructor talked more than the group, anything involving beads, and ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a giant pile of board games and cards entertain yourself‚Äù days while inside. I mostly hated that because no one could agree on games and it kind of gives the option to participate or not and most people wouldn‚Äôt participate because there was no structure.

In some of the groups the instructors allowed us to decide how we wanted the lighting (more often than not the majority preferred half of the lights off), what scent we wanted (they would bring in those oil mister things and send around different oil scents for us to smell and even put on if we wanted), and whether we wanted music or not playing.

I also loved when the instructors would take time to talk to me before or after class or even during. Just walking around asking questions about what I was doing, how I was doing etc. Learning my name etc. Our activity therapists would find us individually the day we got there or the day after we got there and sit one on one and ask us about our leisure activities, hobbies, what we enjoyed. I liked that.
