moderatepolitics,fewcara,t1_few9alu,1579408283.0,"I disagree, because electors are supposed to be based on the number of Representatives plus senators a state has in Congress. The issue is that representatives are supposed to be proportional, and they are not. The largest Congressional district has nearly twice the population of the nation's smallest, meaning that the voters in that district get half the representation of the largest district. The house of Representatives is not representative, and thus the electoral college is flawed.

Furthermore, there is no reason the electoral college needs to be a winner takes all system in each state, and this was not how it was designed. Electors were meant to be elected on a district by district basis. This is the solution I prefer over the much discussed interstate compact.
