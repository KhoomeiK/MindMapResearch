It shouldn't be an obvious mechanic or one that players intentionally abuse, I think it should be something subtle that helps out players who struggle fighting small and/or fast targets."

I've got no problem with hetero relationships, but I hate how they're always just forced in there when they're so unnecessary. This would be true of either kind of relationship. On the other hand, I can also understand wanting more representation for the LGBT community. What's being resented here is that it's always the same thing: a relationship being forced in there when it adds nothing to the show/movie, as if it's some unwritten requirement that every movie must have one. I actually was happy that there was no forced relationship at the end of Into The Spiderverse and they ended with ""Friends? Friends."" because it was a movie which, FOR ONCE, did it right by not throwing in a romantic subplot where it didn't belong."

asexuality,fe2twcj,t3_engld9,1578842758.0,"I was 17 when I found out I was ace. I had always felt like there was something wrong with me, probably starting at about age 14, until I learned about asexuality. It comes in many flavors, so don't be quick to assume much - many aces still have sex, most still masturbate, and as long as they're not aro as well,most still want to be in a relationship.

Good on you for being so supportive of your daughter. My parents were supportive too, but I don't think they went so far as to do their own research on it, and my mom seemed to have that parental panic and kept telling me ""it might change"" which made me feel like she wanted it to.

This community is for asexuals and allies, so of course you're welcome here! It's always heartwarming to hear about parents who care enough about their children to do research on their sexuality rather than try to change them, belittle them, or shut them out. The best way to support your daughter is to keep doing what you're doing. Keep an open mind, don't make assumptions, and don't be afraid to ask questions if you're confused about something - either your daughter, or in this subreddit. Aces are a very little-known sexuality/community, so we love being recognized and having people be interested in knowing more. If you really want to go the extra mile, maybe you could help show your support by getting your daughter an ace ring? Even if she decides not to wear it, it would help cement the idea that you fully support her."
