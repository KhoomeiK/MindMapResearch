newborns,fen7c3o,t1_fel7zsp,1579278563.0,Then no worries we just used it when she was constipated and with a doctors guidance. We only do it weekly now because she’s eating solids and her tummy tends to have a hard time with the new foods. If your baby’s happy and her tummy’s soft then she should be just fine. Congratulations btw! 😊

Edit: breastfed babies can go a for week long stretches without pooping so you don’t really have to worry unless baby’s tummy’s hard or they’re acting uncomfortable/irritable."
