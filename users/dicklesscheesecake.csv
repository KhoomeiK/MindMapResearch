depression,felbnvf,t3_epmgz5,1579218399.0,"I agree. I dont care because no one else cares. I dont care because I'm not going to force myself to have to charge a car battery up for 8 hours to only be able to drive to the shops and back home before it's dead. And the reason I wont do that is because other aspects of life prevent me, like time, and needing time to do other things like go to work, which takes time to drive to, and so on.

I only care as much as the governments in charge force me into caring about what I need to care about.

If you want climate change to stop... start voting in serious governments that will actually change things and pump bucket loads of money into new technologies that help against climate change and also improve our lives...

I dunno something like... a car battery that takes 2 mins to fully charge and let's me drive 700 miles. You know... what my gas car already does."
depression,fela7wx,t3_epm2ch,1579217457.0,"I believe aliens colonised the earth and made alien humanoid hybrids to force us to slave ourselves for them.

I also see them sometimes and hear them. They're all around us.

Doctors.. politicians, surgeons, military commanders.. everyone who is in high power with lots of money is one of these aliens.

They appear to be just like humans but they dont act with empathy or care for any of us.

And they never lose their power. They keep the majority of us under control... poor... scavenging for medication or drugs or booze to take away the pain they endure on us.

Even reddit was built by them. To let us go somewhere and vent our feelings or beliefs is also a form of control over us, because after venting... you never do anything about it... u just carry on, just like I'm going to after I press submit on this.

But I tell you one day... I'm not gonna let them win.

One day I'm gonna have the courage to kill myself and end the pain they bring on me.

Fuck I'd even argue that my wife and my kids are also aliens. Just some other form of control....

Like oooo dont die... what about your family... they all love you. Bah fuck off aliens. I'm done being a slave."

All the things they say they do for privacy now, google does none of them. Despite the s10 plus being a better piece of hardware in your hand, I'd argue software and features and ethical privacy obligations are a better thing to have than the absolute best piece of hardware.

Google is a destroyer of your privacy by default, and even when you turn off things to stop them knowing so much, they still know so much.

Apple it seems at least now... doesn't do that. That's something I value in an expensive smartphone.

PickAnAndroidForMe,fekp3x9,t1_fekkz2l,1579204681.0,"I'd argue to get the phone tested and fixed by apple if you still have warranty, and then do what you want like sell it or trade in for a newer iPhone.

Or just ditch it and get a newer iphone like the XR.

I only say that because you're an ios person and you're probably used to what you are used to so... why change?

You're welcome to change and people will help you find an android phone. But tbh you aren't gaining much in my opinion.

You'll have to deal with a slightly worse app store than the apple app store. You'll have delayed updates to your phone unless it's a pixel. You'll have probably worse battery life performance than compared to a brand new iPhone XR.

You'll also definitely be subject to being ditched by your chosen android manufacturer around 2 years after your phone you buy was released. So goodbye updates and goodbye security patches. Plus if there were bugs in the software that were not fixed after the hypothetical 2 years of support... those bugs will stay with you.

Whereas on ios your device is of course not guaranteed a lifetime of updates but you know... certainly way better than 2 years like we get Samsung and other android makers.

Up to you. I have an s10 plus and I'm sticking with it because I'm already invested into android. I have lots of apps and purchases on my account and I have my headphone jack still and fast wireless charging and access to my actual files so I am not willing to just throw it all away and go apple.

And I dunno.. you might want to think about that before switching to android. Like... how invested in the apple ecosystem are you and your wife? How many apps have u bought? How much music did you buy? Any movie or TV shows purchased? Did you buy extra apple only hardware like charging cables, apple TV, air pods? All your passwords and docs saved? Youd be throwing that all away by switching (the purchases)."
PickAnAndroidForMe,fejfewx,t3_epelyq,1579171572.0,"just out of curiosity, is lag the only reason why you want to switch to android?

because i can assure you, whether its android or iphones, your devices will lag if you have not been upgrading to later models maybe once every 2-3 years.

how old are your iphones? when you complain of lag you make me think you are using model 5 or lower.

you can have an iphone that doesn't lag... it's anything from model 7 or 8 and upwards.

however, if you're going android im just going to recommend what i know - s10 or s10 plus.

PickAnAndroidForMe,fcpvqi2,t1_fcpuvcq,1577873178.0,"Well aside from being a highly decent mid range phone.. you're losing:

IP68 dust and water resistance
Lower spec camera than s10
Samsung pay
Worser GPU so games may not run at full res or settings like on cod mobile, but if you dont play gfx intensive games much and mostly indie or old consoles ports you'll still be fine.

So if you can live with that and a cheaper bunch of materials like more plastic less glass and metal, then I'd say go for it. Its comparable to using the s10 in terms of most other specs.

Plus if you use a good protective case like from spigen you aren't going to see or feel the body of the phone anyway. Same with me on my s10 plus.. always in a case.

A50 is pretty good. 👍 also due to lower specs in the phone and having only 100mah difference from the s10 plus you'll get a longer screen on time likely, depending on usage of course.

Edit: forgot to mention elephant in room.. worser camera. If you can live with that you gain allot of other benefits. The camera itself isn't bad at all but without OIS you'll have quite a few photos not as sharp or crystal clear as on the s10."

6000mah battery, great camera but not super great.

You cant get a flagship Galaxy with a battery that large. S10 plus has 4100, note 10 plus has 4300.

You can try other gamer centric phones like asus rog 2 which has a super great camera and large battery but you'll pay a lot more than  just the phone if you want all the accessories that make that phone worth it such as the case, controller grips, stand and so on.

I'd argue go with a Samsung s10 plus because despite the battery being smaller than you want, the optimisation of one UI 2.0 and the firmware now is very good, it sips battery slowly and I am getting 6 hours SOT combined with weaker gfx games and 5 hours SOT combined with 2.5 hours cod mobile.

You get arguably one of the best cameras currently around as well and its the brand you said you were thinking about.

It's also not depreciated in price since its launch, still £899, which imo is good because usually only iPhones keep their value over time whereas android phones dont - but the s10 series is currently doing well in a lack of depreciation which means if you want to sell it you could get roughly all you paid back."

i believe world war 3 is already here. its just not bombs and people dying... its random girls or women claiming our favourite celebs and comedians fucked them the wrong way or when they were too young, or the cancerous LGBTs making careers end over stupid comments once said in the context of comedy or some other subject.

its turning into the result of some bitch like hilary clinton almost becoming president.

i dunno what happened to society but, somewhere along the way, it changed from a balance to an absolute. you nowadays cannot be in the middle. you are either hard left or hard right. she lost but trump won. jeremy lost and boris won.

so the right is currently winning but thats still a bad thing. its the result of a big fuck you to anyone not indeginous to a country. its the result of a break up from a union formed to stop europe always going to war. its the result of ultra capitalism and the end of workers having any say on how their boss treats them or their employment contract.

but if the left had won... or will win... all men will have to take estrogen pills to become more feminine and thoughtful of womens soft feelings. men will have to pay a max tax, a tax extra just because we have a dick and balls, and each presidential campaign anywhere in the western world will include LGBT candidates, where a T might win and become in charge of everything.

really? a T? someone who is clearly so fucked up in the head that they had to cut their dick off and become a woman, except biologically theyll never be a real woman, but they demand they are called that, and thats the piece of shit thats now telling me how much tax i pay and what all my laws and rules are?

lastly, if you want more storage, buy an sd2vita 6.0 and a 256gb or less micro sd, insert it into your vita, and THEN follow the guide, in order to setup sd2vita as you go through the guide. if you dont, you will have to set it up AFTER completing the guide with assumption you chose the option of official mem card only that is being used.

finally, chances are, doing this will result in the need for a total wipe of the vita, so yes you will lose all your data but you dont lose your purchases or save data from the cloud. you WILL NOT however be able to access any cloud saves, so you can reinstall a purchase from the ps store like usual, but you cant use cloud saving - the version of the Enso and the system UI prevent that. your future saves after a hacked vita are all on the vita itself.

also recommend to connect to the vita using the recommended way in the guide which is via FTP, you can use USB to the PC but i personally ran into issues in getting the vita recognised. you might not... however they recommend FTP and i recommend FTP. use filezilla.

DarkSouls2,fcg9cz4,t1_fcejrks,1577637787.0,"dsr is the only pc souls game to have dedicated kb and m support, and all the prompts on screen of what to press when playing or when in menus have the keys or mouse clicks showing, all the other souls games on pc show the controller button prompts, so even if you assign all your keys and mouse clicks before starting the game, the game still says for example to press A to pick up an item, or shows the triggers of the controller to move across UI menus.

just dont get why they didnt just at least say that the games can only be played with a controller.

leaving the original console version as is, throwing in keyboard and mouse support on the side and leaving all the UI and on screen prompts as controller on a PC game is just in my mind a way of saying ""heres the game, we just released it here for extra money, fuck you, dont care"""

i stopped playing killzone merc when cod mobile came out cos its just more easily accessible and matches are fun and millions are playing it where killzone most matches have some bots and not full players."

depression,fc9jchs,t3_egptaw,1577553517.0,"for me its stress and anxiety. i have the fatigue but after 10 years ive learned to just accept it.

i get stress and anxiety and i blank out throughout the day due to basic problems in life. like... a letter came and now i have a job to upload it to somewhere that wants to see it.

or i have to take the wife and kid to the shops and get shit and go back to the car and go home.

also problems occuring one after the other. i solve one and i get 2 more... i solve 2 and 1 more, solve one and get more and more. it never fucking ends. i keep wishing for a peaceful life where everything is working at 100% and all i have to do is my routine of work and take care of family and rinse and repeat, but it never happens. im always fucking solving problems... and when something gets in the way and i cant get rid of the issue i go fucking nuts."
PickAnAndroidForMe,fc6sb1p,t1_fc61un8,1577488217.0,"The battery is pretty decent so long as you use the device care app to auto optimise for battery saving and set it to auto sleep apps you rarely use, all that sort of stuff.

I also personally find better battery life by manually setting the top 3 apps showing in battery usage to sleep regardless of the auto sleep setting, and all that means is they never run in background when not in use.

My screen on time during the day is around 6 hours if I dont play call of duty. If I played cod from 100% to dead battery It would last around 4 hours.

I stay connected to 4g mostly all the time because I have an unlimited data plan and where I live the 4g is pretty good where ever I am. I switch to wifi only when I have issues with 4g in bad places like inside large buildings with concrete walls or supermarkets that have metal roofs which usually blocks outside data towers.

The power setting i have enabled all the time is optimised. There is maximum performance which increases cpu speed and resolution but I find the phone still performs fast and 1080p is fine for what i do. If you wanted to watch a movie you bought digitally in the highest res then I guess changing the phone res higher like on max performance is an option but I'm just usually watching old movies like predator and die hard or stuff on Netflix.

The only nitpick I have with the phone is the fingerprint sensor. You have to press on the screen harder than you are used to on a dedicated sensor where you likely just light tap it. You also have to pres on the right position or it doesn't work. So it's more fiddly to get used to but by now I have muscle memory of where exactly to slam my right thumb to get it to work, I've had the phone for a month now.

There is however the option to show where the sensor is with the always on Display or by tapping the screen once when it's off to show the time and date and stuff and it shows it there on the bottom, so if your having trouble unlocking by just tapping with the screen off you can tap once in the middle to at least see where it is. Failing that you always have face  scanning and unlock via pin or password.

Camera is... excellent. I wont bother comparing or whatever with other flagship cameras... all I can say with today's tech is that almost all expensive phone cameras are very very good. They are all almost identical in what they produce with very small differences in photo quality. You should buy the phone you want for its feature set and design, not the camera... what I'm saying is like it doesn't matter if you get this phone or an iPhone or a google pixel or whatever else... the cameras are all great and all the photos look almost all the same. The camera on the s10 plus is excellent from my experience.

Another great thing about the phone is Samsung stars. It's a separate support department in Samsung that specifically supports s10 plus users, and remotely access your phone while you watch them at all times and they can help diagnose anything wrong with your phone and book any test centre appointments for you and all free because you have an s10 plus. You get it via the Samsung members app, if you go onto the live chat with a tech issue and need support the agent will offer you the Stars support, and then they call you up and you speak to them while they remote diagnose your phone.

They helped me quite a bit recently and I gotta say that was way less stress than driving down to a Samsung experience store and standing in line to talk to some jackass face to face."

PickAnAndroidForMe,fc588zs,t3_ega4vl,1577448241.0,"The s10 or s10 plus are exactly what you are looking for. The secure folder itself is encrypted and accessed only via biometrics.

The whole phone can be encrypted if you want.

The secure folder can be set to have its content only on the phone, so no uploads to anywhere.

I'd personally recommend the s10 plus because the extra battery life is seriously needed. I used to have the s10e and the battery was garbage. If you have any further questions about the s10 plus reply back and I'll help to answer. I have it myself."
PickAnAndroidForMe,faczh1c,t3_e8hani,1575950906.0,"what i'll do is list the benefits for me having android (Galaxy S10 Plus) over an iphone 11 and you can read and see if those benefits are something you would be missing out on if you switched. i'll also list a few specs from this comparison:

 [https://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=9535&idPhone2=9848#sm-g975f/ds,a2221,\*](https://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=9535&idPhone2=9848#sm-g975f/ds,a2221,*) 

1. bandcamp FLAC downloads of purchased music. FLAC listened to using the PowerAmp app from the Google Play Store is vastly better than listening to music on an iphone 11. You also lose the benefit of a DAC (digital audio codec) with an iphone 11, the s10 plus has  32-bit/384kHz audio 
2. no emulators, period. unless you trash your apple warranty and jailbreak your iphone 11, yet you can do it under warranty on an s10 plus. So many games on phones suck. You could play tomb raider anniversary on a PSP emulator on the s10 plus for example, and no mtx or in app purchases. if you like playing games on a phone, but despise the way actual phone games monetise themselves, then android is the way to go.
3. s10 plus camera is way better than the iphone 11. it has these added specs which the iphone 11 is missing from gsm arenas comparison:  12 MP, f/2.4, 52mm (telephoto), 1/3.6"", 1.0µm, AF, OIS, 2x optical zoom  
16 MP, f/2.2, 12mm (ultrawide), 1/3.1"", 1.0µm, Super Steady video 
4. no headphone jack on iphone 11. s10 plus has one. my wireless only earbuds recently broke, good thing my phone allowed me to use a wired headphone until i got new ones. on an iphone 11 you have no choice, wireless or nothing. you ""can"" use wired headphones with the lightining to 3.5mm adaptor, but your sound quality will be worse than with native 3.5mm jack, plus on an 11 with the lack of a DAC, even worse.
5. iphone 11 is face ID or nothing, and its insecure compared to fingerprints. s10 plus gives you a fingerprint sensor (under the screen)
6. the stereo speakers on the s10 plus are louder. heres the specs:  [Voice 74dB, noise 74dB, ring 83dB](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s10_plus-review-1901p3.php#ls) 
7. far better build quality. nicer feeling glass and edges, nicer to hold. a more elegant device. iphone 11 feels like something out of a general motors factory, not bad but not ok either - just borderline generic, and definitely feels just like every other previous iphone. also has gorilla glass 6, the comparison on gsmarena shows the iphone 11 as having NONE. so a drop test would probably show the 11 cracking and the s10 plus surviving better.
8. more screen on the s10 plus.  88.9% screen-to-body ratio) , almost 10% more than the iphone 11, and its AMOLED. there is ZERO contest against an iphone 11 lol.

&#x200B;

so there you go, theres a breakdown of a far better and larger device thats probably now cheaper than an iphone 11.

the only thing i can say about your friends is, if they are unwilling to install whatsapp to talk to you from their iphones, then they ARE NOT friends. true fact. a real friend wouldnt find this small extra app to chat to you a hinderence to their life, so if these people do, then they arent worth bothering with, especially not worth the justification for a largely inferior phone.

the iphone 11 is not a BAD phone, it's decent, but it's cost is unjustified still. the s10 plus however does have a justified price. it isnt dicking around with mediocre specs and asking for a fortune, it packs the punch and is delivering you the ultimate experience, thats why it cost as much as it did. its cheaper now tho. i got mine for £830 and BEFORE black friday.

whatever decision you make, good luck."
