PrequelMemes,fengiqr,t1_fenfc33,1579284196.0,Once people get enlightened and educated they found that it was bad but during the events it was not and it was seen as a justified action. This would justify the actions of killing the young-lings because technically speaking (even if they were in training) they were jedis and jedis were seen as bad. Either way this topic is most interesting and it all depends in the point of view of the beholder

CompTIA,fcyxtve,t3_ejk1vx,1578089457.0,Your over thinking way too much. I have applied to jobs that ask for a degree and  still some how got hired. Most of the time they look for skills and experience as well but skills and character. You walk into the interview like you own the place and walk out leaving a great impression. Ive made most interviews leave an imprint to the employer and we always end up laughing and talking about hobbies and try to find what connects you. I only have an AA as well and just recently got an A+ but that never stopped me and keeping my skills fresh and up to date really got me into most jobs
ShinyPokemon,fcyt226,t3_ejk30o,1578086467.0,Not really since the catch rate is crap

CompTIA,fcxznms,t3_ejh41h,1578072699.0,"Best bet to help you enter without doing free work is applying via a agency. Agencies are not the best at times but if you can find a good one they will get you in the door for interviews and talk to employers on your behalf towards your strengths. As for the 10 year gap, unfortunately there is not much you can do, its a gap and a very big one. The A+ will hopefully help you in covering the gap and showing employer that you still got it"

CompTIA,fcuvi6t,t1_fctoqdz,1577989393.0,"I would highly recommend a homelab specially since this is going to be your field and your degree reflects that. You can get some practice and do what ever you please and learn from your mistakes their before doing major ones at your workplace. Plus you can always expand you knowledge. A+ is not bad at all its mainly all intro, you must have done most of it in school, I would just use some practice test before going in to take the exams. Also I took both exams in the same day because they will tell you on the spot if you passed or not so if you take both youll know if your certified or not after you finish them. Either way try really hard to get a job that will help you grow, they are hard to come by but they are out there because some just place you in a role and dont let you wiggle around. If you cant really find one, then apply for a role that interest you and stick to it for a year to gain that ""work experience"" so to say and then go after the big fish, just make sure the work experience is relevant to what your planing to apply for.
