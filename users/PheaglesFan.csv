funny,fd5j6up,t1_fd0ygvx,1578178178.0,"Trucks tear up the state and local streets faster than an averaged size vehicle, they are less fuel efficient, they emit more pollutants than economical cars and their oncoming headlights in our eyes as well as in our rear view mirrors are blindingly dangerous. Truck owners can justify their purchase until pigs fly, but there is no purpose for a 22' pickup truck on today's roads unless you are hauling horses, cattle or hay to market. Look at the body of the next pickup truck you pull up to. It hasn't seen a hard day's work in its life. It's just bigger than the guy's little import next to him and that makes him feel good about himself."

Ive got three other reasonably sized vehicles to take to the grocery store or Target. If the 22 footer is your only family car, you have my apology. If you need 22' truck to run errands, it is clearly a statement about someone's (lack of) masculinity or even worse, sexual identity. Leave it at home."

exmormon,fd01zu5,t3_ejpt5c,1578112463.0,So sorry to hear that. You should take that horse next to you home with you and ride it down the street to visit everyone who won't let you stay with them. TBM families can be real tools some times. I guess knocked up unmarried pregnant women carrying the son of God are to be pitied but actual family members should just fuck off. Sorry again.
