truscum,ffeassf,t3_est73e,1579841535.0,I don't get it - sociology is very fact based so to me that meme is basically incorrect. Definitely agree that you need dysphporia to be trans tho.
germantrans,fdsd8mq,t1_fds6wgh,1578699982.0,Hatte den gleichen Gedanken. üòÇ
germantrans,fdetru5,t3_ekynpd,1578346435.0,"Wenn du ohnehin fast 18 Jahre alt bist, ist es meines Wissens nach definitiv die schnellste Option zu warten, bis du vollj√§hrig bist. Du hast schon so lange gewartet - diese kurze Weile wirst du auch noch rum kriegen. Halt einfach durch."
germantrans,fdcfedf,t1_fcuz8kp,1578273550.0,"Ah, interessant. Vielen Dank f√ºr deine Erkl√§rung!"
germantrans,fct3kj0,t3_eipv8j,1577931971.0,"Da kann ich dir leider gar nicht weiter helfen, tut mir leid. Ich habe noch nie von der Methode geh√∂rt, von der du redest, w√ºrde mich aber ganz gern etwas informieren - hast du eventuell einen link zu einer Seite, wo die Methode beschrieben wird oder √§hnliches?"
lonely,fcowzpk,t1_fco7vii,1577843879.0,Just saw that now but thank you so much for your offer anyways!
lonely,fcowy9l,t1_fco15jo,1577843847.0,I'm sure some day it will! Don't give up hope.
lonely,fcoww0f,t1_fco13jx,1577843797.0,"Thank you, you too"
bulimia,fckog4d,t1_fckhqf7,1577729741.0,Maybe it's a lack of magnesium or something like that.
bulimia,fckdirr,t3_ehmeq1,1577722898.0,Concerning what muscle groups?
germany,fckd7ce,t1_fckb0ll,1577722697.0,"Then that's your impression, which is totally fine. I think everyone feels different about this.

Also maybe ""Kult"" would be a more fitting term."
Ghosts,fckcpye,t1_fck4y86,1577722382.0,Exactly! I feel like especially on reddit so many people are so mean and rude without any reason and I sincerly do not understand that in any way...
germany,fck2p0v,t1_fck2036,1577714786.0,"For instance when we talk about the tv Programm on new years eve. Or potential activities. Even when we just want to mock people (as in 'i bet their life is so boring they are watching dinner for one). Also in general when it comes to such classic movies.
As I said, that's just my peer group and everyone I know, but obviously that's all I can judge.

Comparing political and historical events with movies is absolutely making no sense.

Are you personally German as well, who also lives here?"
germany,fcjzgxd,t1_fcjvs7h,1577711646.0,"In my peer group this actually is a tradition - even if we rarely watch it, we talk about it relatively a lot and are all clear that this in fact is traditional. Every German knows about that which makes it traditional, easy."
socialanxiety,fcjz9zl,t3_ehdugo,1577711436.0,"May I ask how you manage to pay for a living without ever having a job?

I also have a lot of anxiety when it comes to working (currently just part time since I study in university) and my only tip is to just jump into that cold water. Apply for the next job you see, grow with your tasks and slowly build the confidence you need.
For me personally it's very very helpful to know what I am always able to quit if it gets too bad."
YouShouldKnow,fcjysnb,t1_fcju6cz,1577710896.0,I'm shocked by this blasphemy.
YouShouldKnow,fcjyntc,t1_fcjsscz,1577710741.0,"I personally was not aware of the fact that the fire is still burning, so I am very thankful that you made this important post."
bulimia,fcjxhoy,t3_ehkmm1,1577709344.0,"Apparently this, however, is not obvious for you but going to the gym is not the only way to do sports... Go running or ride your bike if you own one. Be more active in general by walking, taking the stairs etc.
If it is possible for you try to include more healthy foods in your diet, take a bit care of your macros and eat whatever you are craving in moderate amounts to reduce your binge-cravings."
socialanxiety,fcjp0yb,t1_fcj5ljb,1577697418.0,"Being used from people you thought you could trust is the worst thing ever... Garbage people. I'm sorry dude.
When it comes to parties I also never go, besides when it is a office party, in which case alcohol saves me."
Ghosts,fcjocfi,t1_fcjjwwe,1577696443.0,"Yes, i don't understand it either when people actually get annoyed. You should know where you are browsing on.
What I (obviously) do understand is actual constructive criticism, since this is a place of exchange."
socialanxiety,fciwiri,t3_ehd5yz,1577671504.0,"I also always talk to myself in my head.
In social situations i am usually just so nervous that I appear really dumb."
Ghosts,fcivc14,t1_fcimrtb,1577670693.0,"Well, this whole subreddit is just a question of belive anyways and I always thought it's a platform to exchange your believes to posts like this - which includes disbelieve. Don't let yourself feel down because of this! :)"
YouShouldKnow,fcimseb,t3_ehd5p0,1577665181.0,"Sociology student here - This is one of the first things I've learned in university and you are so right, it's extremely important for a proper understanding of basically everything.
Thank you for that important post."
Ghosts,fcikfnw,t3_ehax4s,1577664050.0,Not to be rude or anything but you can't even really see 'the ghosts' face. With that kind of poor image I would not even be able to recognize my own grandmother to be honest.
bulimia,fcijnax,t3_ehchxr,1577663662.0,"Well, I have never been in recovery and never stopped binging but I did experience not being able to keep anything down - not even broccoli. Since I needed the energy I started to slowly make at least a small breakfast a regular thing.
Maybe slowly making small meals a regular thing again would be helpful for you."
TooAfraidToAsk,fcgmzwq,t3_eh6bnx,1577641824.0,"Why should that not be normal? Like what's your fear? I think you are aware that nobody will tell you, you are sick or anything, so I don't really understand your concern."
bulimia,fcfcs3i,t1_fcdw7bk,1577628700.0,I can't really explain it but it's like contracting your stomach. I just lean over and contract my stomach and that kinda is it.
socialanxiety,fcfcagi,t1_fcey5m7,1577628570.0,Hope you will find people you can in touch with soon.
socialanxiety,fcdw9vc,t3_eh1ugz,1577614463.0,Life. I have been in uni for two solid years without having a proper conversation.
bulimia,fcdw5a2,t3_eh469q,1577614411.0,I also am not able to purge by triggering my gag reflex. I can only purge hands free. I don't know if that works for you. Maybe you could see this as a turning point to try to recover... I know it seems impossible but it would be worth it.
germantrans,fb71ei9,t3_ebmy6i,1576568977.0,"Was sind denn deine Gedanken, weshalb das da anders aussehen sollte?"
