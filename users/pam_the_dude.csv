If there is a deposit/Pfand on the bottles, you are actually supposed to place them next to the container instead of throwing them in. Reason is people who scavenge the trash for those bottles don't go through the actual trash but pick them up from the side of the container. A bunch of bottles now even show that illustrated on them.

Also it sounds incredibly hard to balance. Make it too harmless and it'll become negligible, make it just a bit to hard and players will be punished all the time. Ship combat and fps combat are core elements to the game. You don't want your npc sitting ducks, but you don't want to massacre your players either. Sure, there can be safety in groups but the npc will shoot someone of that group. And if they are not completely incompetent, there is a higher chance of a player dying or getting other punishing injuries.

So yea, I'm really curious how the mechanic will eventually turn out."

I'm planning on getting the 100 to 400 myself as soon as I can. For me the best reason is that 100mm is still usable for a lot of things whereas 200mm gets difficult. Also the 100 to 400 gm has a minimum focus distance of less then a meter, which also makes it amazing for smaller objects. And last but not least it is a lot lighter then the 200 to 600."

Also you don't need to land your Aquila on a landing pad on an outpost in order to spawn the vehicle. Just land anywhere around the outpost and walk to the vehicle console to spawn it in. But it actually should pop up in the vehicle spawn console... so that might have been a bug. From the sound of it 3.8 is not as stable as we had hoped (by any means) as it was said they wanted it as polished as possible. I hope they bring a lot of fixes somewhere in mid/end of January.

On a good side though, you could have decided to also try arcorp. Flying for like 10 minutes straight only to find out that the whole planet is a city and has no area to load up a rover. So that is one pitfall avoided at least."

Yes, you can spawn ground vehicles/grav bikes from the gates in lorville. It is a bit hard to detect them from the ~~ground~~ air though, I usually fly low around the edges of the city until I can make out a gate. You have to land a few hundred meters away and run the rest though.
