This is not how systems work. We have found out time and time again that using legal practice to engage with moral decisionmaking does not lead to good policy outcomes. 

O, let me count the ways:

-The homelessness crisis

-Abortion rights

-The War on drugs

-The AIDS epidemic

-Abstinence education

-Equal Rights Amendment

-The ""tough on crime"" era

-The ""Welfare-Queen""

-The gutting of bankruptcy laws





All of these are instances where laws passed or not passed under the framework of forcing people to learn to make the right decisions failed utterly. The question is: why do people take on so much more debt now-- the answer is not because they're worse decisionmakers or lack some kind of moral or ethical fiber, and to suggest that is just promotes more bad policy."

news,feh431k,t1_fegbi7g,1579108724.0,"""Paradigms for propulsion"" would have been more correct usage-- but the phrase itself makes sense.  If you consider turbines, jets, or propellers different paradigms for how to move a thing in 3 dimensions, it's fair to wonder if there might be some other principle being put to use in the tic-tac. But either way, it's a pedantic criticism.


Most of my comment is dedicated to the idea that this is just sensitive tech, and speculation as to what kind of tech it is. Not conspiracies. My point is that even if it's nothing more than sensitive tech, we can still meaningfully wonder about *what kind of secret tech* is on display in the videos. Just hand waving and saying ""ah y'know the navy"" manages to shut down discussion of the irrational questions, sure-- but also downplays the importance of the rational questions that arise when you see a video like this. 

 I'm literally just curious about what the thing is, not invested in it being aliens or whatever."

news,feek34f,t1_feejdrv,1579035351.0,"Would you be referring to the patents from Salvatore Cezare Pais? Ive read them, and they are *interesting* to say the least. If they're truly viable then I would be quite upset. There are a lot of globally-pressing problems that could be solved with the technologies outlined in those patents. If they're just sitting on this stuff, they are doing a massive disservice to all of humanity for the sake of perserving military hegemony-- a model some factions seem to recognize is outdated and ineffective. Which is *infuriating*



But the question I always have after reading those patents is this: do you have to have demonstrative evidence of the efficacy of the design towards the ends laid out in its patent?



If not, they're liable to be bullshit, elaborate fantasies concocted of unrealized principles meant to demonstrate a goal, but not really corresponding to any capabilities we really possess.

E: fixed phrasing"
news,fee1ofh,t3_eond7n,1579024545.0,"It's interesting to see the complete, almost defiant incuriosity that people always demonstrate on these threads. Is no one intrigued, deeply curious, even a little afraid? 

 If it is a navy vehicle: Can you imagine what kind of incredible metamarerials the surface might be made of? What new propulsion paradigms are being kept from the public?

Imagine they are worried about revealing their optic capabilities: see above

Imagine it's not a navy vehicle: *then what the hell is it?* And if it is what I think we all secretly want it to be-- I can't even think of a followip question because of how crazy that would be.


But locked within that null-space of classified documents, as far as we know the truth could lie in any one of these deeply interesting possibilities.


EDIT: because I forgot to mention the least absurd theory: that the tic tacs are simply illusory/diversionary techniques used by the government to confuse radar and other imaging techniques. Which is interesting enough to be curious about, but no fun at all.

Edit 2: Given the Nimitz's status as probably one of the most advanced ships in out fleet, the theory in my EDIT would make sense. But still, the navy claims not to know what they are, we the public certainly don't, so things are really up in the air at this point."

politics,fe9xnm9,t1_fe9u3pr,1578942336.0,"There's a lot of saltiness in this thread around people qualifying this poll-- but the objections seem fair, especially when considered as comparisons to the Seltzer poll. The Monmouth poll has:

-a smaller sample size

-Fewer first-time voters than seems reasonable given past caucuses 
and the general strategy of Liz and Bernie's campaigns

-High margin of error

But the Joe fans want to run a victory lap, and to be fair he hasn't had a favorable cycle in a bit, so I guess we'll just have to see who gets the egg on their face come caucus day.

However, what does bother me is the fact that none of those reasonable objections make it into the meta-effect of running headlines like this (i.e. people like voting for candidates who look strong)-- so now  off the strength of a headline and poll Biden can safely claim frontrunner status, deserved or not.

Edit: of course other candidates benefit from headlines in the same way-- that's just a problem with primary coverage in general."
