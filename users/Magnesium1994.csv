raisedbynarcissists,fetsi0j,t1_fetah82,1579379536.0,"I cried in the theater during “The Place Where Lost Things Go” from Mary Poppins Returns.  Also, I cried during Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban when Sirius said “The ones that love us never really leave us”.

My mother got mad at me for the latter."
raisedbynarcissists,fetrx8o,t3_eqkb1c,1579379247.0,"It’s funny, “Take a Break” from Hamilton can make me sob my eyes out, but when I saw the play, I hardly cried at all.  Maybe because I was trying to convince myself I was actually watching it the whole time.  My mother and I had a misunderstanding, and I was convinced she was going to leave me at home and see the show by herself …

I need to see it again just so I can try and enjoy it."
Blogging,fedouqj,t3_eojk7a,1579016666.0,"I’m hoping mine will lead to a career, but I think my problem is I don’t stand out much.  Most of the blogs I follow are also about books."

raisedbynarcissists,fe65yw7,t1_fe65gbf,1578882544.0,It scares me too.  Hopefully I can formulate a plan soon.  Hopefully we both can.  :)
raisedbynarcissists,fe65bbi,t1_fe646t2,1578882115.0,"Seriously though.  Even when she says “If you don’t like it here, take your check and go” she doesn’t think I’ll get anywhere without her.  I can go ANYWHERE without her.  Because once I undo all the trauma, I won’t feel guilty about liking the things I do.  I’ll be able to do all the things I want to do."
raisedbynarcissists,fe620lk,t1_fe6162r,1578880005.0,"God, I hate that.  Last night, my mother was like “you know you’re going to be in a home, right?”  She makes moving out sound like the boogeyman."
raisedbynarcissists,fe60qob,t1_fe5yyq0,1578879199.0,True.  I almost feel like my mother uses my disability as an excuse to have more control over me though.  Or as a reason she thinks she should have control at all.
raisedbynarcissists,fe5yr7c,t1_fe5xfis,1578877935.0,That sucks.  I’m sorry you had to deal with that.
raisedbynarcissists,fe5x7ja,t1_fe5w751,1578876956.0,It doesn’t help that my family don’t take it seriously because I’m not making money from it.  How am I supposed to take it to the next level if I feel like I’m “not allowed” to do it because I’m not making money from it?
raisedbynarcissists,fe5w12i,t1_fe5vhyl,1578876208.0,"Yeah, actually pushing myself too hard is the problem.  Either I work so hard I burn out or I don’t do anything at all.  My blog burned me out because it felt like a full time job I wasn’t getting paid for.  I’m just starting to get back into it."
raisedbynarcissists,fe5uhwf,t1_fe5pvig,1578875233.0,I’ll do it for both of us :)
raisedbynarcissists,fe5pbx8,t1_fe5mec8,1578872489.0,"Confused is probably the wrong word.  I know I need a job, but I also know that if I get a job while I’m with my mother, I’ll be settling because all the things getting me towards my dream job will feel off limits.  I don’t want to settle."
raisedbynarcissists,fe3srgk,t3_enoz0k,1578852550.0,"This is EXACTLY how I felt with my old psychologist.  I’d say “I need to get out,” and she would say “but you can’t right now.”  

I’m two sessions in with a new psychologist who is amazing and agrees that I need to get out.  When I told my mother I was working on a plan to move out, she lost her shit and told me I wouldn’t be able to live on my disability check.

I’m so confused right now."
raisedbynarcissists,fe1yhl6,t1_fe0uk6g,1578832353.0,"So … I’m gonna be okay?  I’m really fucking scared right now.  I was able to sleep, but as soon as I woke up, the weight of the situation came crashing back down.

I’m so confused."

raisedbynarcissists,fcu88vu,t3_eixf43,1577974893.0,"Nice to know it’s not just me.  I’m trying to finish reading the Spanish translation of *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, but sometimes when I open it, I get this mental guilt trip of my mother being like “Why aren’t you done with this yet?”

Oh, I don’t know, maybe because she spent so much time telling me “it’s not helping me”.  She’s also obsessed with how long it’s taking me to read and because it’s taken me so long, she thinks I’m not interested in Harry Potter or Spanish, so I end up wondering whether it actually means that I’m not interested.  It sucks."

raisedbynarcissists,fcszqzd,t1_fcswcx1,1577929181.0,I didn’t have much luck reaching out to my uncle.  He still thinks my mother and I should figure out how to get along.
raisedbynarcissists,fcszd9b,t3_eiqrt8,1577928909.0,I really hate how society buys into the notion of “family” and “everyone needs to get along”.  You shouldn’t feel bad for resenting her.

Sometimes I find myself regretting not doing internships and stuff in college, but there’s nothing I can do to change that."
