freefolk,ff6vmbx,t1_ff5lj2g,1579635801.0,"Even TFA was stupid as fuck, though I agree it was the best of the lot.  Where did the First Order come from? Do we really need another Death Star? Do we need a SUPER DEATH STAR? How did they build it?  Is it really necessary to wipe out the entire new republic halfway through the first episode? 

Let's talk about the hero's journey for a moment. How about a hypothetical journey for Finn? Ep 7 Finn gets wrecked by Phasma. Ep 8, Finn still loses to Phasma, but not as badly. Ep 9, Finn finally triumphs and defeats Phasma. Cliche? Sure. But most fiction is formulaic for a reason. 

But we can't have a nice hero's journey for Finn because he has to go on a MacGuffin quest to get the thing, but gets distracted by plot device after plot device, and never accomplishes anything because each new plot device renders the last plot device so entirely trivial that it might as well have never happened. There are zero consequences, just plot devices.

And then he gets preached at, that sacrificing yourself for the people you care about somehow ISN'T noble, just before the person that did the preaching sacrifices themself???

And THEN Holdo just hyperspace jumps into the thing, thus destroying it, which pretty much renders Rogue One and A New Hope moot, because they could have just set up a droid in an X-Wing and hyperspace jumped it into the Death Star and destroyed it, and in doing so, save millions of rebel lives. But wait, ""Equal rights for droids!"" shouts Lando's fembot, so we can't set up a Droid in an X-Wing in ANH, because droids are people too. EXCEPT THEY AREN'T.

I'm done."

The same lady that just a month or so ago bemoaned the fact that the MCU has so much source material to work with, unlike Star Wars (what the actual fuck), and who ironically just so happens to be the same lady in charge of Star Wars WHEN THEY ELIMINATED THE ENTIRE EU.

Instead we get 

Equal rights for robots, and Lando being in love with his fembot. That shit has FAR reaching implications.  Especially because now that equal-rights-demanding fembot is the navigation computer of the Millennium Falcon in the OT.

 Wrap your head around that. 

I know everyone likes to shit all over the prequels, and somewhat justifiably so, but holy fuck the sequel trilogy is an unmitigated disaster in comparison. They literally retcon the lore multiple times WITHIN THE SAME EPISODE. They retcon their own retcons within minutes.

The prequels suffered from an overabundance of world-building and bad dialogue. 

The sequels suffer from an incoherent mess of ideas, zero cohesion, a second director that wanted to subvert the expectations of the previous director, as well as deconstruct an entire mythology, and the first director, back for the third film, trying to deconstruct and subvert and retcon everything that second director did, and all without a single original thought in his head. 

Just give the franchise to Filoni and Favreau already."

He calls himself a gardener, and I get the metaphor. However, good gardeners pull the weeds. GRRM actively encouraged and fertilized the weeds, and the weeds have grown so thick that they've choked out the good growth. 

I've refuse, on general principle, to read all the world building stuff that's been released since ADwD. Backstory and world building is great. I actually love it.  However, when the author actively stops writing the main story in lieu of writing a bunch of lore because he can't shit OR get off the pot, I'm out.
