I would just say that learning is part of a process and we learn as a society as well as individually. I think it's important to remember that as we look back on parts of history including that period of time when aids was the largest story going. It was part of a learning process and I'm as guilty as most others back then on getting sucked into what was being sold by the media. I can now look back and say 'what the hell was I thinking?!?!', but that's how we learn and in this case as a society we were all learning together. I don't think anyone who lived through it is proud of it, but I also hate to see it simplified, because now looking back hindsight is 20/20."

If anyone is to be blamed it's the media; ""it was a disease coming out of the gay community"", and that's what we were told. It was really Ryan white that turned the tables. Your softened approach to history, and expecting everyone to understand what the disease was really about, or that Reagan or either political party was specifically doing this out of spite for anything ""gay"", and how dare they say anything different than what we were all told.... Give me a break! I remember it, I remember the panic, I remember the talk, I remember the news articles.

However even the experts first took note of 'a new disease coming out of the gay community'. Just because it was blood born it made it much easier to transmit via the anus that it's common for micro tissue tears. Reagan might have been morally biased but from what we were all told ""it was coming it of the gay community"", he was describing what we were all told via the media. It took time and research and learning to understand exactly what it was."

Funds were not withheld (even if they were you would have to go back and impeach every president. Countries not doing what we want and then slapping sanctions on them is the same thing). Not only that but it's pretty shocking to me that the Dems couldn't walk across the street and get a judicial subpoena and thereby force Trump staffers to testify, thereby getting a more complete version for there little report. Instead they issued legislative subpoenas that are not enforceable and then pretend to point the finger that Trump was in 'abuse of Congress'.

AskTrumpSupporters,fdnt4tu,t1_fdnoohg,1578592306.0,"Well it's kind of a 2 part question. I love Trump's transparency via Twitter, there isn't much hiding involved there. With Obama I never knew what he was thinking. Financially I've never really cared about any person tax documents. I couldn't tell you anything about any of the candidates in the past or present taxes, it just never meant much to me, not only that, there is no law that requires candidates or presidents to release private tax info. So it doesn't hold much water for me personally. Public finances that my tax dollars pay for I do want to know about, but I don't feel like Trump has been any more transparent or less then any other presidency about that. Things like solyndra, where we didn't realize how much was invested until it was belly up. Every president has had their issues.

I personally think disclosing what is being spent is appropriate. But I have issues with the articles bring written (or what I read). The basic premise is about moving the secret service under the department of the treasury. Which I'm in total agreement with. Holding off on disclosing what is being spent could just be the process of getting everything moved over and then taking a proper inventory.
