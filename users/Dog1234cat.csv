First, he is not Donald Trump. This alone makes it likely he could win the majority of votes. 
Second, he’s been vetted at a national level. We know his skeletons and we’ve seen him on the national stage.

And this is where other front-of-the-pack Democratic nominees will lose in the home stretch. Bernie and Warren currently are polling well against Trump. But a couple of months of attack ads and this lead will evaporate dramatically.

Bernie is the candidate the Republicans want to run against. He’ll be painted as a socialist (which he is) but the attacks will also dredge up decades of gaffes and indefensible positions. Warren: $41 trillion. Eliminating private health care insurance. And that’s just for a start. They’ll both go down in flames.

Let’s go back to where we started. I said it was my observation that the students at an elite UK university (this was 30 years ago) were more “worldly” than the students at a top law school. I’ll stand by this. Hell, I’m still good friends with a dozen folks from each instance and it still hods true. 

Then someone said “hey, what do you mean by worldly”. I’m listing a number of areas of knowledge (language fluency, cuisines, etc.) and including a category of High Culture. As a category itself it’s not in dispute: it’s been around for centuries and it’s defined right there in every respectable encyclopedia. What is in dispute (or perhaps simply overturned) is the high brow is “better”.

You seem to be irked (I guess) by the term itself and then rattle off the current social consciousness buzzwords, while at the same time listing an involvement or knowledge of what is covered under the umbrella of “high culture”.

Would we not be having this back and forth if I just said “the Europeans knew classical music, fine art, history, cuisine, and culture much better than the US students”? Is it just the terminology you’ve got an issue with?

Or is it the entire notion of worldliness itself?

Or do you want to contest the notion that US Ivy League students on the whole are just as worldly as those at European elite universities."
NoStupidQuestions,fetypb8,t1_fetv12u,1579381389.0,"High Culture as a category has long been in place and generally agreed up. As a concept it’s not controversial.

Is high culture identified with the intelligentsia/aristocracy/elite/upper class? Undoubtedly. It’s almost how they defined themselves as different from others.

I’d say pop or low culture has oodles to offer (and that’s how I spend the vast majority of my days). But high culture can be rewarding and it’s there for anyone to enjoy and delve into."

But you can do worse than Wikipedia

So classical music (in all its varieties), opera, the entire western canon, fine art (from painting to sculpture), philosophy, architecture, even history. 

We’d turn in Classic FM and the flat mates would guess the answers to the contests. The number of classical venues in London bests New York easily. We’d walk through art galleries and the could talk knowledgeably about the art and the subjects in the paintings. And they knew the latest French postmodern theorists (dismissing them, but nonetheless knowing them). 

And unsurprisingly the Germans knew Goethe, the Spanish knew Cervantes, the French knew Balzac and Voltaire. And they expected you to have at least a passing understanding.

NoStupidQuestions,fetm7mt,t1_fetc5st,1579376818.0,"You see. Merely mentioning high culture gets you labeled as pretentious.

But in this instance I’m comparing the worldliness of a group of 100 grad students from 30 countries compared with (30 years ago) a fairly homogenous group of American law students.

The knowledge of history, languages, cuisines, customs, etc. was night and day. Me? I was on the bumpkin side of the Susan Sontag scale of high culture knowledge."
NoStupidQuestions,fetlylj,t1_fetgrbm,1579376767.0,"I think your comment is spot on almost all the way through. Consider the text below as mere footnotes and asides. 

I certainly don’t think knowledge of high culture should be the measure of a man, far from it. But, to my mind, one should be aware of it, to have a general sense for what’s out there, to be considered worldly. And some people who are whip-smart and effective simply don’t aspire to that. 

And there’s a notion about the literary canon that I’ll allude to but others do it much better. The King James Bible, Shakespeare, Homer, and the rest are partly very important because many in western culture have spend time with them, creating Talmudic explications and using them as a window to see the human experience through. Why couldn’t you to some extent do the same with, say, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

The argument has limits, but much of it has to do with shared experience. As for myself: my references skew heavily to pop culture with at most a sprinkling of the canon etc.  I see Europeans seeming more erudite because much of their shared experience is more high culture leaning. 

There is a book by David Byrne called How Music Works that savages the notion that classical music is somehow better or more morally uplifting that pop. 

And we are talking about elites, for sure. I’m always amused when Alabama is compared with midtown Manhattan as opposed to upstate New York, for instance."

Was that law school tough? Damn straight. Were the collective IQs tippy top? Uh huh. But it’s the US. Many had never really traveled. Most mastered only one language. Discussing the fine arts (let alone taking pride in it) is seen as pretentious.

There are Ivy League universities that may have accomplished students and high standards. Some bottom of the barrel state and private places. 

And, funny enough, at many of the top universities you might not get as good of an education than at a solid university that focuses on teaching (the Nobel prize winner rarely teaches the undergrads, and if they ostensibly do they still may not in reality).

But as a credential, networking tool, and a buffet of intellectual pursuits, a top US school is tough to beat.
