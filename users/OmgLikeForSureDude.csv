If I let someone in it’s because it’s safe to do so and I use my hand signals to let them know when to stop and when to proceed.

Portland,fezglk8,t3_eqyoc4,1579457139.0,"Be ready. If you live in a tower in the Pearl and request a car then leave your apartment and take the elevator down you’re doing it wrong. Cars are everywhere downtown and the app may say  5 minutes but that’s more like 1-2 minutes until arrival. I hate having to put on the flashers and sit there blocking traffic or circling the block wasting gas. This also includes bars and restaurants. I can’t tell you how many people order a car then send a message “paying the bill now” or “waiting for the check”

Please and thank you."
