A proper ute (aka a pickup truck) would generally be high enough to not even have that happen unless you managed to hit it at the apex of its jump and it was spooked by the vehicle.

[This video shows an average sized kangaroo hitting a windshield, and the windshield doesn't break.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdMJzkIFM3U&ab_channel=DashCamOwnersAustralia)


 [This video also shows how high a kangaroo can jump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kTeoO7IGjc&ab_channel=3AWRadio), so you may very well be safer going at a high speed into a kangaroo since they won't notice you and will still be at travelling hop height, rather than spooked hop height. Note how low it is jumping before it decides to jump onto the vehicle."

Shoot one? Harmless destruction of armament.

The warhead will not detonate without its specific system compressing the fissile material into a critical mass and damaging them externally will just break apart the fissile material and render the warhead inoperable."
