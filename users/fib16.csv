Head brewer at a big label brewery and you’re rich. But In General I think they make around $60-70k. Not bad but certainly not what they deserve for the hard ass work that it is.
todayilearned,ffb1e9m,t1_ffa7cdr,1579749382.0,He talks about society and how we are brainwashed by marketing and we are crazy consumers. We don’t make our own opinions and believe what the media tells us even though they have zero motivation to tell the truth rather they tell us what sells. Etc etc. he is a very good writer and it’s worth reading. He is very right about most things he says and he is incredibly intelligent.

AskReddit,ff4rzrp,t1_ff40f13,1579571032.0,Exactly. Every one of my older family members is a millionaire. What it means for them is they can retire and just do nothing. Don’t have to work for the man. But that’s it. Nothing fancy at all. Regular people in regular houses with regular stuff.

Nothing that would be a crappy job but hey who cares if you stay. Try it for a few months and quit if sucks. I’ve never had a job like that. I’ve always had corporate jobs. 

Other than that I’m not the type of person to get bored. I wounding watch tv at all. I would do the hobbies you’re talking about and spend time with my son. I would be very healthy. Work out, eat near perfect, juice vegetables, wood working projects, and find friends who are off to spend time with people and family. Also take some classes to learn. That’s it.

HoustonBeer,fens67n,t3_eq2okp,1579290028.0,This is kind of you but very odd. Why not just drink them yourself or give them to a friend next time someone comes over. Are they that awful you want them out of your home?
CargoBike,fenrtfp,t1_fend3tm,1579289848.0,I totally get your argument. But just humor me and look at it from another direction. I can buy a brand new quality bike for $200. Add in a cargo area and  an electric assist. Why does that bring the price up to $4000. I figure it’s another hundred for the extra metal for the cargo piece and let’s say $1000 for the electric motor. Where does the $4000 come from?  That’s why the question comes up. What’s the answer to that one?
BeAmazed,fenf1jo,t1_fen6epp,1579283293.0,I agree. Unless his company needs the room for business or entertainment for clients I just can’t see how a person needs to own that. Just rent the sweetest boat ever every time you go out on the water and avoid the hassel of owning that thing.

beyondthebump,fdwihto,t1_fdwf8od,1578758997.0,Working out or doing anything potentially dangerous is a mistake. You can seriously hurt yourself. I have a lot of experience in this world and many people do more harm than good when they jump into workout without knowing what they’re doing. . In no way is it to demotivate her. It’s the opposite. Getting hurt will seriously demotivate you from losing weight because you will be on a couch with an injury and nothing to do but eat your troubles away.

beyondthebump,fdrsmtf,t3_emwa9r,1578689073.0,"Just reiterating. Don’t work out. Seriously. Don’t start by working out. It’s a Mistake. If you don’t enjoy working out you will never do it and it’s dangerous when you’re over weight. You think you’re out of shape now? Wait til you pull a muscle and can’t do anything. Start in the kitchen. Cut calories. You can lose 20-30 lbs in 3-6 months just by cutting calories. Once you’ve lost some weight and have reached a milestone (maybe 10lbs) , Add in some simple walking every day. Then reach another milestone (20lbs) and pick up your workout a little. Then just keep doing it. Trust me...I’ve done this. This is personal experience and tons of time working with other people. Do not start working out until you learn how to eat or not eat actually. Cut calories now!!"

They sent a pretty sad email when they went out of business. They said the home brew world is dying off and fast bc you can get such good craft beer now days. I agree but I can still make my beer for a third the price of the grocery store so I’m going to continue doing it. Plus my beer is better than what I can buy and it’s fun.
