For a school project where we had to interview a senior citizen she asks the teacher whether she should just call or go Visit her grandma who “lived in Spain” (we went to a low-middle class school in SoCal.) When we came back from Christmas break, she asked our friend group what we got for Christmas...then she proceeded to cut us off and say she got a huge TV, game system, 12 games, and a cell phone (she had none of those.) She claimed guys were always falling in love with her and she always had a new bf but I never met any. She would lie about little things like grades on tests and papers, or getting complimented by other girls when she would hear girls compliment someone in our friend group. 

She was pretty mean to me and I was her ugly dumb friend that made her feel better about herself. It wasn’t until several years later that I realized how sad her life must have been.
