Paranormal,ff6713n,t1_ff5ksda,1579620651.0,"I’m a sleep talker. I need this!

Not too long ago I had a dream that I was in the guest bedroom with my bf (we actually were in there sleeping) and my parents were getting ready for bed (they were not in real life cuz it’s 3 am in real life) and our doorbell rings (we don’t have a door bell in real life) and I hear my mom say “that’s weird, someone is at the door at this time of night?” And I got this deep sinking feeling that someone or something really really bad was at the door. And my dad says “I should go check whose there” and in my sleep I yelled “Please don’t!!” And suddenly I’m being woken up by my bf whose saying “are you ok babe? You just yelled??” I was like “the door bell rang... wait...”"
firstimpression,ff4cz7f,t1_ff112y0,1579560692.0,The color didn’t stick. I just wanted to try it. They are shaved now lmao. Blue armpit hair sounded super fun. But long armpit hair that’s just regular blonde was boring and felt a little weird. It was super soft tho. But it’s all gone now lol.

It looks like you've only ever had very serious relationships that have lasted awhile or you've had casual relationships that never really went too far or got too serious. You seem very ambitious although maybe hesitant. If you're hesitating anywhere in life I'd say go for it and if you put your mind to it you'll go far :)"

firstimpression,ferx5v4,t1_ferwkyw,1579359262.0,I’m sorry I remind you of such shitty people. I care about the environment but just in the sense that I recycle and use reusable bags (but we got a ten cents fee for plastic bags in my state so you gotta bring your own bags anyways). And I’m far from racist lmao. BBC/interracial porn is my favorite 🤫😂🤣

cats,fepusc3,t3_eqbdyu,1579332045.0,I showed her the picture and all the upvotes and nice comments and read them to her. She didn’t seem impressed at first but she started pawing the screen and upvoted it!! Ik it was an accident but omfggggg how perfect and amazing is that?!
firstimpression,fepun3f,t1_feptslx,1579331908.0,Maybe it’s just the picture?? Lol idk.

Like to the bar or maybe even a club"
firstimpression,fepskam,t3_eqcvij,1579329825.0,"You look like fun! I think you might like grocery shopping while stoned. I think you’ve had dyed hair for most of your life. I think you prefer to stay in for a night than go out, but that you occasionally do. You like to dress up sometimes but for the most part you like sweatpants and sweatshirt. Staying in, staying comfy, and cuddling with your dogs and SO."
firstimpression,feps2yg,t1_fepr2jx,1579329364.0,We’re both pretty big stoners but he’s way bigger of a stoner than me. Like I’ll go a few days without smoking cuz I try to keep a low tolerance. But not him. Idek the last time he’s missed a day lmao.

firstimpression,fephmv2,t1_fephe60,1579320726.0,It didn’t stick sadly. I tried a few times and it didn’t work. I shaved it cuz it wouldn’t stay colored. But I don’t shave my legs. The hair is blonde anyways.
firstimpression,fephi2v,t1_fephc46,1579320625.0,I love his grunge. I hate it when he shaves.

GoneMildCD,feph9ha,t1_feph65m,1579320453.0,So are you! I like you a lot as a person. We should chat!
curledfeetsies,feph7l1,t1_fepgqpk,1579320416.0,She’s got lots of strange coloring like that. She’s named Ginger cuz I was in 5th grade and she had lots of ginger spots on her. I remember when she was soooo little. I wish I had pictures but it was before iPhone. And my other cat was adopted in his adolescence so I don’t have any cute kitten pictures of my cats.
GoneMildCD,feph1rt,t1_fepgyo8,1579320298.0,I understand. There’s a lot of little nuances to CD that takes time to learn. You’re off to a great start!

cats,fepg914,t1_fepfyxm,1579319733.0,Thanks. I picked her out as a kitten from one of my moms coworkers when I was in 5th grade. I’ve had her for so long. She curled up in bed with me today and wasn’t looking so good.

firstimpression,fepav2t,t1_fepaebf,1579316055.0,"Lol I wouldn’t say that. Honestly I’m always nervous about the attention I’m going to get from things I do but I try really hard to not let it bother me and try things I have an interest in. I don’t think I’ve ever said anything along the lines of “free spirit”. When I get asked why I do things like trying to dye my armpit hair I shrug. I wanted to so I did it. The picture was one I sent to my friend, I thought my hair looked nice in it. It wasn’t supposed to be about the armpit hair but that’s really all I’m getting from it. I think I’m gonna try again later. 

Btw the color didn’t stick :("

firstimpression,fep3dyd,t3_epqmgi,1579311234.0,You look like you post risqué photos on Instagram and like the attention you get. You want to feel pretty but you’re afraid you’re just average. A string of bad relationships. Experimented with drugs but never stuck with it really. You have “friends” but you don’t actually feel like you can be close with any of them. Goes to the club to feel alive but you still feel empty deep down.
firstimpression,fep348p,t1_fep314a,1579311060.0,"Yay!!
What about the other comment I posted. How close was I?"
firstimpression,fep31m0,t3_epxlvi,1579311014.0,You look like you are very tall and maybe dutch.

firstimpression,fep2xbm,t3_epcsse,1579310940.0,Cute. Very pretty. You look like you are struggling with something. Maybe your view of yourself or drugs or maybe a boyfriend/girlfriend or home life?
firstimpression,fep2tqj,t3_epwn22,1579310878.0,Amanda. Katie. Rachel. Or Hannah. ?? Please respond I wanna know your name lol
firstimpression,fep2qp6,t3_epwn22,1579310824.0,A nice woman. A mother if not now then some day. You look like you’ve got good morals and feel the need to help people. You’ve got a good heart but are a little self conscious. You’re worried about something but trying to not let it bother you but it’s been in the back of your mind for awhile.
firstimpression,fep2eu7,t3_epsfew,1579310615.0,Super cutesy. Quirky. I feel like you’re dating someone who is also Asian. Doesn’t have a lot of friends. Big on Instagram. Likes cats. Might play an instrument. And needs glasses but wearing contacts in this picture.
firstimpression,fep2261,t3_eposs0,1579310390.0,You look like a pretty but average girl with a small group of friends that you’re only really close to one or two if any at all.
firstimpression,fep1xyn,t3_eptr5f,1579310318.0,I would want to be friends with you
firstimpression,fep1x96,t3_eptr5f,1579310306.0,You look super silly and like to be yourself but secretly deep down are worried if people don’t like who you really are.

I think some people would be uncomfortable with your nipples but I myself am an advocate for free the nipple, so if I saw you in public I’d say you’re approachable. But maybe not to others who that might make them uncomfortable."
firstimpression,fep1b6m,t3_epusui,1579309918.0,"I ducking love your hair first of all. 

Second you look like you have a close knit group of friends that you are really open with and bubbly and funny around, but outside of that group you are kinda shy and worry what people may think of you. Like you would probably wear a hoodie with the hood up out in public."
firstimpression,fep14qg,t3_epx0on,1579309804.0,You look like you care too much what people think of you and take quite a few pictures before you settle on one you like and are going to post.
