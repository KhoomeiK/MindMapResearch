Yeah except that he hyperextended his knee senior year and it was recommended that he get it surgically repaired, but he never did, and it's thought that that contributed to the ACL tear. 

>As for Foster he cost the Skins nothing more than money. It was worth the risk even if he never plays.

It's just another injured guy who was taking up a roster spot that we had to scramble and find a replacement for at a later date than we really should have. I don't disagree with the signing at the time, and maybe he works out, but all in all my point is that we tend to sign and draft guys who fall because of injury concerns and other issues.

I never suggested such a thing, but it's not like we're ""average"" in terms of injuries. We're one of the most injured teams every single year. At this point, it's more than fair to say that this is a big fucking problem and not just bad luck.

It's *really* dangerous at evening rush hour going eastbound down the hill between Leonard Sandridge drive and the Garth/Barracks exit. You have all these people in the right lane going like 35, then the passing lane is going normally around 55-60, and all it takes is one person to decide that the right lane is too slow, and they don't bother to check their mirrors, and they just mosey right into 60mph traffic going 35.

This right here. You never fucking know what's gonna happen. The incessant stopping and waving people in just to be ""nice"" really makes me wanna slap someone. The #1 rule of the road is, don't be *nice*, be *predictable*. You don't get any brownie points with the Gods of the Road because you jammed up traffic just to ""be nice"" to someone else...because, while you might be being nice to that one person, you're doing the opposite to the people who you've stopped up behind you. Just follow the rules of the road. 

I've also had people stop at a *green* light (at 250 & hydraulic) to make an illegal U-turn, waiting for the opposite traffic to clear up. Just sitting behind him laying on my horn, and he's oblivious. Fuck is wrong with you? 

I also love it when these upper-middle-class jabronis in their Audis stop at a green light and block traffic in order to give money to panhandlers. That should result in immediate revocation of your license, no questions asked.

The selection is not great (though it's definitely gotten better). *However*, the nice part is that since they're a government agency, they can't gouge you on rare bottles - they have to mark everything up the same % - so you can get some stuff for a lot less than you might at a private shop in another state. I once bought a bottle of Pappy Van Winkle 20 year for like $225 and sold it to some moke from up in NoVa for $900. Of course, now it's rare enough that they do an online lottery for it, which I never win, but still, it's nice that they can't gouge us. 

There's actually been a push for a long while now to privatize it, but I think that it's such a good revenue stream for the ABC (alcoholic beverage control, which also enforces all the liquor laws in the state) that they're loathe to let it go."

About a decade ago, they decided to finally open certain stores on Sundays. Ever since, the state has been a hotbed of crime, lawlessness, and drunken mayhem. 

Just kidding. Nothing happened, other than me being able to grab some bourbon on Sundays if I want. 

Fuck blue laws."

Talent is talent, athleticism is athleticism. And it’s very rare to have a Haynesworth type situation where the guy has the talent and the athleticism but just says fuck it. These guys almost always give it 100%, but no matter how much effort Montae gives, he’s never gonna be a great safety. As you said, the fact that he sees the field, outside of an injury to a starter, is an organizational failure, and it’s a big reason why when people praise our drafting prowess over the past 5 or 6 years, I just smdh."
