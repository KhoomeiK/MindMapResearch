gratefuldead,ff1ksd3,t3_eqzzhc,1579480780.0,"For the record: NOTHING wrong with 80s hair metal!! I know you can like both of course. He just loves heavier music that gets his adrenaline goin, whereas the dead are more relaxing and that’s the music i tend to go to (Pink Floyd is my second favorite band). He’s just never really given the dead a chance, so this was a historical moment. His body language completely relaxed and he was just lost in the sauce. It was awesome"

depression,feff3od,t3_eorigf,1579054985.0,"A few things i have learned is that 
1. Money DOESNT buy happiness. I don’t care who has to say it. It doesn’t. I come from an upper middle class family and i have gotten a lot of wonderful things. Yet i still suffer from depression and i have since as early as 12 years old. It doesn’t mean i’m ungrateful, i am *extremely* grateful honestly for every little thing i have ever received. But we have a chemical imbalance in our brains. That’s what it honestly comes down to. We can be given the world but it doesn’t take away that rain cloud that follows us around. You need to remember that and it’s sad your dad doesn’t even understand that.

2. Whether you broke your leg or stubbed your toe, it’s okay to say “ow”. Yes, it’s undeniably true that people *do* have it worse, but that doesn’t change the fact that you’re going through something as well. Big or small, you have every reason to feel the way you do. I just had a 14 hour day and i just laid in bed and cried. Are there people going through worse things? Absolutely. Do i have a right to cry because i’m just emotionally exhausted? Oh yes. It doesn’t matter what the situation is. What you feel is what you feel. Don’t let other situations belittle that."
