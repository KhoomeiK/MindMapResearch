dogpictures,ff6g3a5,t3_erhtu1,1579626438.0,look how happy you both are. I lost my dog of 16 years and four months to the day on the 17th. I wish the years would just go by already so I can be with him again. But I heard it get easier with time and I’m praying that it really does. Although it’s never easy losing a four legged family member he is always going to be with you 💙🐶👼🏻 so sorry for your loss
