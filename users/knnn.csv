dresdenfiles,fek38ao,t3_elble2,1579191664.0,"**1)** ""The whole shape-shift too far and you lose your own personality"" is a mechanic that appears in the Amber Diceless roleplaying game Jim Butcher used to play.   From the rules:

> One of the most common problems facing a Shape Shifter is losing their own personality, their own sense of self.  Usually this is a result of the character attempting to imitate another character, or trying to take on the form of some psychically powerful entity. When this happens a player may lose control of the character making it necessary for the Game Master to take over. In the best of cases, the player character's persona returns to control whenever the body goes unconscious. However, it is possible that the ""foreign"" personality can take over for extended periods.

**2)** re:Bonnie as having a divine connection (as opposed to Bob) -- this was actually one of the questions you guys asked Jim when he was on your show.

**3)** re: the trope of sacrificing your offspring, see the Binding of Isaac in the Bible (though of course he doesn't actually end up going through with it in that example).

**4)** Re: Butter's Sword, do you think the Sword might lose some of its power given how bad the last few movies have been?   Oooh, maybe it becomes more ""Disney""?  

- Also, in Wheel of Time, Rand Al'thor makes a Lightsaber out of Power, though everyone points out to him how stupid it is (he can just shoot people with the same energy)."

dresdenfiles,fegmej0,t3_eov9gm,1579097174.0,"**1)** ""Empty Night"" is used by Lara, Thomas, Madrigal and Mother Winter.   If it weren't for Madrigal in the list, I would have said this has something to do with the Oblivion War.

**2)** The Bible literally starts with: 

""Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.""  (Genesis 1:1).

Note both the words ""empty"" and ""darkness"" are used here, so ""Empty Night"" as the primordial state of the universe is not a crazy solution.

**3)** See also Thomas' quote:   

> ""When every star in the heavens grows cold, and when silence lies once more on the face of the deep, three things will endure: faith, hope, and love.""   

Thomas says it's from First Corinthians, but it's really an amalgamation of Corinthians, the aforementioned line from Genesis, and something that looks like it's taken from the Necronomicon (or maybe Milton's Paradise Lost).

**4)** I've personally got this WAG that ""Empty Night"" is actually the name of the primordial ""monster"" that made it into Creation.  A sort of super-mantle that encompasses all the energies of every monster in the Dresdenverse.   Thus, Thomas saying ""Empty Night"" would be the equivalent of a mortal saying ""Jesus"" (or maybe ""Adam"").

**2)** re: Grey, we have a kinda WoJ:

> He is a scion of them, he made a deal to keep his free will and that was what he meant by paying rent.

Note that while we don't have explicit confirmation, the fact that Kincaid is implied to still have a soul suggests to me that he might be in the same category as Grey.
