You have to also look for certain gods that counter you and get those out of there. I often times leave Bacchus in the mix. He used to have an insane ban rate, and he unjustly does still.

So what I'm saying is... If you're gonna try to sneak a Bacchus through, have the foresight to ban ganesha. However I'm 200 IQ so if you ban ganesha against me in a means to pull the fleece over my eyes and get bacchus, you're shit outta luck. I'd take bacchus right from under your nose. Unless you have first pick in which case I'd just ban him lol.

worldpolitics,fe6b7n6,t1_fe61nho,1578885997.0,"Eh. Not really. Anyone who says that a candidate like Hillary would have won in a popular vote is wrong.

For that matter, anyone that says that a candidate like Trump would have won in a popular vote is *also* wrong. They're both wrong because we've never actually *had* a popular vote in the United States, so that kind of assertion is essentially baseless. We've had some *proxy* votes based off of total of all the state votes, and those can often give a good indication of *'who would have won in a parallel universe had there been a popular vote.'* but for a lot of these close races, like the ones mentioned here, that's not the case. To claim with certainty that ""such and such *would* have won"" is downright dishonest. It is *literally* moving the goalposts. 

>""Sure, the other team got more touchdowns, but we ran more yards! That SHOULD be the metric, and if it was, we would've won!"" 

>...or... you know... the other team might've focused on their running game instead of scoring and you still may have lost. 

Let's take the most recent example since that's obviously what's being alluded to here, and mentioned elsewhere in the comments. Trump vs Hillary.

Hillary got more in the 'popular vote' at about 49% to Donald Trump's 47%. Donald Trump meanwhile won the electoral vote 306 to 232.

First off, the problem with calling it a 'popular vote' is that it's nonsense. Out of over 230 million eligible voters we had ~120 million vote. More importantly, the average voter participation is something like ~~45%~~ *55%* average per state, while *Battleground* States - states where people may feel their vote really matters - see participation levels more like ~~55%~~ *65%.* That's over a ~~20%~~ *15%* increase in voter participation. We have no way to know how many Republicans stayed home in California because they knew the Democrats would win and their vote didn't matter. Or how many stayed home in *Texas* because they knew the Republicans would win and their vote didn't matter. And vice-versa for the Democrats. We also don't know how Hillary and Trump would have changed their campaigning strategies and what effect that may have had. Now, sometimes those differences don't matter much. When Obama beat McCain by something like 10 million votes - we can be pretty certain that had a popular election been held, Obama still would have won. But Trump vs Hillary? With at least an expected 20 million more votes on the table, and under a 3 million vote margin? That's *way* too close to call.

The best way to demonstrate that is to show how we can get an *opposite* indication by looking at another proxy. For instance, instead of just taking the entirety of how everyone voted, and project that onto the entire eligible voting populace, instead let's partition people up into groups by their state. Then we'll take the voting pattern of the state and project that onto the eligible voting population of the state. This is more granular and will likely give a more accurate proxy. (That doesn't mean it will always be right, or it will never be wrong at the same time the 'popular vote' proxy is right, but simply that it's *more likely* to be right if we were able to survey thousands of hypothetical parallel universes where a popular vote takes place after a popular-vote based campaign.)

Not only is this an okay proxy, but it's easy to analyze because we get the results straight from the electoral college results. That's what it does after all - award votes to the candidate based off of voting patterns of the states, plus some distorting offsets. Yes, it's winner-takes-all, but that doesn't mess with our results. The minorities of each state are balanced by the minorities in other states that swing the opposite way.

So first, let's remove those distortions. First off is the +2 distortion for the senators of each state. Trump won 30 states and Hillary won 20. So subtract 60 and 40 points from each. Then, because the electoral college works in whole-numbers, let's presume something *ridiculous.* Let's assume that *all* of Trump's states unfairly had their electoral votes rounded *up* due to statistical flukes, and let's assume that *all* of Hillary's states unfairly had their electoral votes rounded *down*. So that's -30 points from Trump and +20 points to Hillary.

Final Tally: 216 to 212. Even with nonsensical assumptions, Trump still wins, and by about 1%. A similar margin by which Hillary won the 'popular' vote.

Actually, that kind of rounding error isn't just nonsensical - it's basically impossible. At most it should only be half-a-vote error for each, which would put the final tally at 231 to 202 - a *7%* margin. And reality is more closely going to say that with 20 on one side and 30 on the other, the rounding errors more or less balance themselves out and you have more like a 246 to 192 result which is a whopping margin of 12%+. 

So you can go ahead and say that according to the 'popular vote' Hillary should have won. And I can turn back around and say ""according to an arguably *better* proxy, *Trump* should have won by a *landslide.*"" And now we're down to arguing how well proxies compare and properly predict alternate universes. Great.

So none of this is to say that ""Trump *would* have won"" (or that I wanted him to, for the record). The point is there is no telling *who* would have won in different circumstances with a different system. Whenever someone says that, the implication is: 

>""If we had a *proper* system like X, candidate A would have won. But in our current system Y, Candidate B won instead. So in a *just* world we would have Candidate A and thus candidate B is a farce and doesn't belong there and it's unjust that they won.""

And that's a terrible implication. Because it ruins social adhesion and gives people an excuse to try to de-legitimize our election. And most importantly, as I've demonstrated above, it's completely unfounded. There's no way to tell for certain how an alternate series of events would have gone - especially in systems this big and complex - and you can slice and dice the results any way you like to argue for whatever result you want.

We don't live in a democracy. And thank goodness for that. We live in a Republic with varying degrees of democratic mechanisms for choosing our representatives and executives. We have that system, and while we can argue about the merits of a system and debate changes for the future, it is nothing but unproductive and socially destructive political posturing to argue about how a past election was 'stolen' or 'unjust' based on how well the statistics align with some different arbitrary criteria."
