I'm a Democratic committee person and poll worker for 15 years. If you think that people in the swing states are going to vote for a progressive candidate you're dreaming. They'll vote for Trump or stay home. That's not the way it should be, but it's the way it is."

It's a phrase that is meant to be easy to engage visually with and be slightly humorous. Incidentally, regardless of accuracy, many mechanics still refer to real oil instead of synthetic as ""dino"" and Sinclair, the defunct oil company, used a dinosaur as their mascot."
