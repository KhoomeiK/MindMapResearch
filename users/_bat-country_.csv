I've made my own pizza for years (or go to sort of bougie hipster places that use really quality ingredients and hella vegetables) and never get delivery type pizza, so I always do a double take in this sub when people list in under junk food. Then I think about the pepperoni pizza at a friend's party that was so greasy it soaked through its box into the box of the pizza it was stacked on, and remember that's what pizza is to most people."

fatlogic,ff3g08p,t1_ff1kmds,1579540280.0,"I know an absolutely massive amount of people who smoke, but only in one specific area of my life, and it's always so weird to me - they're all mostly about my age, grew up with the same anti-smoking rhetoric, and are in general very smart, educated, and well off people.  It's kind of a mindfuck, because in my everyday life, I don't know anyone my age who still smokes."
fatlogic,ff05xwp,t1_feznztc,1579465556.0,"Omg. I bring my bike inside my work, and it's really really hard to maneuver around people when they're holding the security door, but really easy to get in when I can badge myself in and use the automatic door, and people get SO OFFENDED when I tell them I don't need help, and wait for them to get out of my way."
fatlogic,fetbcou,t1_fesq3ed,1579373602.0,"I'm really uncomfortable talking about running to my non-running friends, because a) it really is a sport for introverted nerds who love data and I really don't want to bore people, and b) basically all I ever get back is a list of why running is bad, they could never run because -insert minor inconvenience here-, or OMG YOU'RE KILLING YOUR KNEES!!!!!.

Bitch, my knees are in the best shape of my life."
running,fep902l,t3_eq9k14,1579314830.0,"Are you aiming to run the whole thing, or do a run/walk type thing? 

If I were you, I would 100% not sign up for this race, I'd find a 5k in a month or so, a 10k in summer, and a half in fall or early winter, but I love a long training cycle and being overprepared (NOT overtrained)."
fatlogic,femse19,t1_fempupy,1579268259.0,"But diseases like HIV and hepatitis C are reasonably manageable, and it's important to reduce the stigma surrounding them. People are more likely to get tested and know their status, and more importantly, communicate their status to their partners, if it's seen as a really really shitty inconvenience that you can still live a normal life with, rather than if you have it you're a diseased dumpster fire that no one will ever love and you have the spectre of death at your back always."
running,femrkpq,t3_epyy9n,1579267579.0,"I'm part of my local running shops club, so I get a discount with that. Around black Friday they had a wicked good sale on a shoe I love for training and everyday running, so I used some birthday gift cards to pick up a couple pairs, and I just used xmas gift cards to buy a specific pair for my marathons this year. I doubt I'll need to buy shoes the rest of the year. 

The shop also has tons of group runs with raffles and stuff to get people excited to come out, and I've won shoes that way, too.

Edit: as far as brands go, I tend to stick with Brooks and occasionally Saucony. My new Ghost 12s that I got for races are wonderful."
loseit,fejojne,t3_epid66,1579181699.0,"When I started losing weight and counting calories, I didn't tell anyone about it. I just made small changes, like portion size control and healthier choices in general when out with friends. I don't really care about anyone's opinion of my diet, and it's such a potentially drama filled topic that it just wasn't worth it to bring up.

I lost weight for mostly vain reasons, tbh, but was kick started by the majority of my direct family going from no heath problems to everyone having heart problems in one year, and me realizing I'd rather have my body fail in my late 80s rather than my early 60s. I know I don't have any actual control of that, but anything I can do to improve my chances, I'm going to do."
running,fehj2q8,t3_ep6wm4,1579117564.0,"I'm super goal oriented, so making really hard time goals for myself for races helps me! Also I have a decent run streak going, and the thought of breaking that gets me out the door even when I don't want to. 

Last night I did a really tough 6 miles, and the whole last 3 I just kept repeating ""keep showing up"" in my head, and thinking that even though the run wasn't going great, I'd feel better if I did my whole planned run rather than giving up."

running,fdztxgq,t3_enfymw,1578795706.0,"If you train consistently between now and the race, you should be able to squeak in under an hour if you race smart and don't fly and die.

My average, just running a slight tempo pace, 5k is between 24 and 25 mintues, and my 10k PR is 50ish mintues."
notliketheothergirls,fdzsxbg,t1_fdx1l5p,1578795042.0,"I legitimately actually do not like the color pink (or any yellow besides neon, or brown). When I was a kid I had pink stuff forced on me just because I was a girl, and now I'm expected to ""reclaim"" pink and subtly accused of being unfeminist if I don't (pussy hats for the women's marches, etc), and I just can't fucking win.

I love a lot of ""girly"" shit, and I'm feminine af, and I love that other women like pink, I just don't. It does nothing for me aesthetically."

loseit,fd33wjo,t3_ejxr4c,1578154507.0,"I'm 6"" taller than you and am really happy at about 135 (and could be as low as 126 and still be in the healthy BMI range), you should have no problem hitting your goal weight. 

I was bigger my entire life, and it was a huge mental adjustment to realize that just by eating better and watching my calories I now weigh less than I did in high school."
running,fcsukxm,t3_einw64,1577925492.0,"Couch to 5k is an awesome way to start. 

Recognize that it's going to be hard. It'll probably really suck at times. But you just have to work through it. I tried to do C25K twice before I finally finished it on my 3rd try, because I didn't realize how much of it would actually be mental training."

One thing to consider is maintenance once you hit goal weight, you can't really stop doing all the things that helped you lose weight or you'll gain it all back again. If you're not into yoga, maybe find another activity you're passionate about?"
running,fc9vid6,t3_egu3t9,1577558820.0,"It's harder, but you also get the fun of running downhill! I also live in a very hilly area, and when I go run races in flat places it's so weird. Part of my marathon training this year is going to be more running in flat places, since I'm so used to using different muscles for up and downhill, my legs get super worn out during miles of flat."
loseit,fc9uz3q,t3_egu5a0,1577558602.0,"I just either say no, take a small piece of chocolate or whatever if it fits in my calories and I actually want it, and when I cook, I make healthy food to share.
