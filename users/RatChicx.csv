queen,fdmwmlc,t3_em84ec,1578569179.0,"“Mick Rock's album cover photograph was frequently re-used by the band throughout its career, including the music videos for the songs ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" (1975), and ""One Vision"" (1985). “
[Wikipedia]

I’m sure there may be a reason, but all I know is that BohRap reused it.


MORE INFO:


“Through Kobal, Rock came across a black and white photo of Marlene Dietrich from the 1932 Josef Von Sternberg-directed film Shanghai Express.”
[Huffpost]

This is the photo that inspired the shot. It could hold some importance.


""the theme was it had to feature the group and it was going to be a gatefold. Freddie was already a star,  even though he wasn't. He was a master of projection like David. So they said black and white theme, featuring the group in a gatefold. That was my brief."" 
[Huffpost]


In conclusion, my theory is that Freddie wanted to revisit the theme of ‘not a star...yet’ for Bohemian Rhapsody, since perhaps he felt this would be the song to make him a star. Or, perhaps he felt he was already a star after the American success of Killer Queen."
