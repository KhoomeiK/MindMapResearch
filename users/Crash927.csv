clevercomebacks,fejxg07,t1_fejwa1b,1579188067.0,"The future of Brexit was and is far from certain, but that’s beside the point.

I still see the outcome as essential:

1776 was the first year the US started _acting_ as an independent nation, and it became retroactively true that they _were_ an independent nation at that time. As a result of the outcome.

In 1861, the South started _acting_ as an independent nation, and it became retroactively true that they _were not_ an independent nation at that time. Again, as a result of the outcome.

It’s like in a post-mortem on a chess game: we can often say something like, “that’s the move that lost the game for him” even though the outcome of the game was not known at the time of the move."
clevercomebacks,fejnntf,t1_fejm3om,1579180940.0,"I think of it a bit like Schrodinger’s Loss: the outcome tells you about the past state, and the past state can’t be known until the outcome is known. 

As another example, the English took an L in 2016 with Brexit, and that hasn’t even happened yet. (Edit: and many English citizens view it as such)"
clevercomebacks,fejljjd,t1_fejidbp,1579178977.0,"I think the outcome matters in these cases. 

If the south had won, then 1861 would have been their first year as an independent nation, so it would have been an L.

But they lost, so it was failed independence and not an L. 

It’s similar with the Revolutionary War: had England won, then 1776 wouldn’t have been the first year of an independent America."

> Going up to someone and saying ""Hi, how are you?"", and getting a disgusted look of shock in return

This scenario is what I’m talking about. And I’m speaking as someone with self-worth issues.

Regardless of being bullied by others, if a person ever wants to be be able to walk up and talk to a person, then they actually have to just walk up to people and talk to them. Nothing else will be effective.

But are those experiences you describe generally representative of the context of this conversation?

I was talking about approaching someone who you’re interested in getting to know better, and I don’t think most of those types of interactions end in the circumstances you’ve described. 

Being awkward in conversation is a far cry from being bullied. I’m not sure I understand how they relate in this instance."

The reason I point it out is that it seems like it could be used as justification by the people who most need to step out of their comfort zones.

When we think about awkward social moments as trauma, it makes the problem seem much bigger than it actually is."

I’m certainly heartbroken and angry, but I believe in Canada’s role as peacekeepers.

Military action should be a last-resort response, and our armed forces should be used mainly to support allies and to keep peace in areas being rebuilt after conflict.
