hoarding,ffe4i6l,t1_ffe1ej6,1579836481.0,"Adding to this, it may depend upon the country, but if you get pushback from the doctor and they don't sign saying 'patient is incompetent' instead make them sign something that says 'patient is competant and perfectly ok living on their own' or similar. Why? Once you mention that the patient was unable to use their glucose meter, no good doctor will sign the latter, so they will reconsider and sign the former. If they do sign the latter, see a lawyer once something goes wrong.  One thing I cannot stress enough is TAKE PICTURES OF THE ISSUES! If things are worse over time, start looking for signs of frontotemporal dementia and other forms of dementia. They are really subtle in the beginning. They often cannot be officially diagnosed until a few years of degeneration, but if you know there's something there, you can get the patient into care, maybe a retirement home or similar. I know a lot of people hate homes, but there's a lot that are really similar to living on a luxury cruise ship, they're pretty nice. The nurses available have seen every type of age related condition and know professionally what to do."

I can see why nurses are into it. Then there's the legit uses - Eucalyptus really does open the sinuses when you have a cold (e.g. vicks products), peppermint will help a sore stomach.
