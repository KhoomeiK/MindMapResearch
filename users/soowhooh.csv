Idk it's kind of funny how we all feel so terrible but we still try to comfort each other. Anyways the kitten story you shared made me feel a bit better, so thank you again. Hope you have a good day/night wherever you are."
SuicideWatch,fe60at3,t1_fe5yiaa,1578878920.0,thank you❤️
SuicideWatch,fe5vmd9,t1_fe5okwk,1578875946.0,"Thank you for responding. I like the world tbh; I mean it sucks a lot but it's beautiful too, as cliche as that sounds. I just don't deserve to enjoy it."
SuicideWatch,fe5vbx2,t1_fe5i9wi,1578875767.0,"I'll never amount to anything tbh. Sure, I could get help or something and make my parents spend thousands on medical bills trying to prop up a failure, but I'd rather not. Anyways, thank you for your concern."
SuicideWatch,fe5uf9t,t1_fe5kx9u,1578875183.0,"Apparently I'm on academic suspension, so I can't access my courses, but apparently I'm also not suspended because I still have my tuition statement for this semester, and some of my professors have already emailed me. My parents don't know anything; they think I'm doing fine, thanks to my lying. Everything's a mess and I don't want to deal with fixing it.  I know I'm a coward, but at least I'll stop wasting more of my parents' money. They can probably retire earlier with me out of the picture. Anyways, thank you for responding."
SuicideWatch,fe59vhr,t1_fe54zwp,1578866922.0,"I mean I'm already being selfish by killing myself, but I'll be more selfish if I make her spend a bunch of money for nothing on top of it."
SuicideWatch,fcp0mdl,t1_fco8fkl,1577846843.0,Yeah tbh I still respect them for volunteering their time to suicide prevention.
SuicideWatch,fco9c99,t3_ei137q,1577826705.0,"Even when you reach 18/19/your 20s, I think many people are still dismissive. I can sort of understand why: I mean to a 50 year old, a 20 year old's problems probably seem trivial, but it still hurts to be dismissed. Sometimes it seems like you don't have the ""right"" to be depressed or have any serious emotional problems until you've stepped out into the real world: have a job, mortgage, taxes, etc. Idk, sometimes I agree, and sometimes I don't."
SuicideWatch,fco2r51,t1_fcm75or,1577822979.0,"Idk honestly. Just I have been planning for a long time, and I can't believe I'm still alive."
SuicideWatch,fclwlau,t1_fcls40g,1577758230.0,"I guess you could try to focus on stuff they can/like to do to distract them from their suicidal thoughts. For example, instead of saying ""think about how your family will feel,"" ask them if there's anything they want to do, like watch a movie, or anything they're looking forward to in the near future. I understand why you would talk about their family/friends, but in the end, it will just make them feel guilty, and they probably have thought about them a lot too anyways."
SuicideWatch,fcljpn7,t3_ehm013,1577749381.0,"Whenever I read  r/SuicideBereavement I feel guilty, but I still think it's better off if I'm gone."
SuicideWatch,fcljkhf,t3_ehonx2,1577749285.0,"Yeah same. I feel like I'm living on borrowed time, like each day I'm alive is actually a day I'm supposed to be dead. Honestly should have killed myself months ago. 

Happy birthday though. I hope you can at least have a good day/find some joy on your birthday."
SuicideWatch,fclj8q6,t3_ehqc1d,1577749068.0,"Yeah I don't want to ruin New Year's for them either, but I'm running out of time."
SuicideWatch,fcj3qzn,t3_ehdwka,1577676528.0,"hey just fyi, the suicide hotline also has an online chat. if you go to their website, you can find it."
SuicideWatch,fcgrzop,t1_fcbw9eu,1577643494.0,"The semester is already over so it's kind of late for that. Tbh I know how to do well, but I fell back into bad habits mid-semester. But I guess yeah school/the future are my main problems. My mom brought up law school today and now I'm panicking b/c I cannot even fathom that anymore."
SuicideWatch,fcbu1ay,t1_fcbpuyl,1577590972.0,19
SuicideWatch,fcbtzm0,t1_fcbqgor,1577590957.0,I'm failing at school but I do help some around the house. I don't think it's nearly enough though. One day my parents will be sick of me. They're already afraid I'm going to be a failure to launch.
SuicideWatch,fcbp5h9,t1_fcbmeuo,1577589424.0,"just don't really see a future for myself I guess. I've been isolating myself this past year, burned a lot of bridges."
SuicideWatch,fcbopr4,t1_fcbn874,1577589287.0,"I'm 19 already and I read a lot of stories about how at this age I should be kicked out/at least contributing rent... I'm not the happy, loving, successful kid that my parents deserve."
SuicideWatch,fcbk5w5,t1_fcat095,1577587813.0,yep
SuicideWatch,fcbk14y,t1_fcauut9,1577587770.0,Thanks for understanding. I just feel reaching out for help will make everything more dramatic and stressful because it will have to involve my family. The community on here is really nice and supportive though.
SuicideWatch,fcbje0u,t1_fcavcrf,1577587558.0,"a little better now, thank you for asking :)"
SuicideWatch,fcbjaeu,t1_fcb07db,1577587526.0,"I mean objectively I have a good life. Loving family, warm home, etc."
SuicideWatch,fcbiz5n,t1_fcb4c6c,1577587428.0,Oh yeah I understand. I was asking it more rhetorically. My dad asked me it yesterday and it just made me feel like more of a burden. Thank you though.
SuicideWatch,fcamnl9,t1_fcalv3v,1577572274.0,">just failing at stuff (school, social relationships, etc.) kind of feel like a leech on my family."
SuicideWatch,fcajyb4,t1_fcaiz4t,1577570653.0,not really. thanks for asking though. how about you?
SuicideWatch,fcagl98,t3_egukih,1577568869.0,"yeah same. freshmen year of college I thought I could have a future, then I ruined it."
SuicideWatch,fcag2ww,t3_egwcs1,1577568618.0,"hey I'm also a 19 year old girl, and I feel the same. spent the morning halfheartedly applying to jobs but I want to be dead before I get a response (like I'll get hired at all lmao). we can talk if you want."
SupportandAdvice,fc6hrdj,t3_eg9s9k,1577480873.0,thanks for creating this sub :)
MMFB,f78ghk2,t3_dne4ty,1573492748.0,"Hey, I was an XC runner too! Even though I was the slowest on the team, I really enjoyed it. Honestly, you're 14, you have a lot of time to improve your speed. Just enjoy the run, enjoy the scenery around you if you're going on a long run, and keep at it, and you'll definitely improve, even if you don't notice it at first. 

I 'm also kind of socially anxious, so I can relate to what you're feeling about people judging you. Honestly though, people really don't care what you do; no ons is watching your every move. Don't think too much about what other people think, just continue being friendly/polite when needed and let yourself relax a little. Can you talk about your anxiety to your parents?"
