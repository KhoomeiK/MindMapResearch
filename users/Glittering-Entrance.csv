aww,ffb06i9,t1_ffadhjk,1579748559.0,My cat loves the smell of alcohol. I have to hide my vodka martini from her and also right after I brush my teeth and use listerine if I put my face in hers and she gets a wiff of it she tries to eat my mouth and make out with me. She’s special.
relationships,ff9wo90,t1_ff96o75,1579723138.0,Bahahahahah I so needed this laugh. Thanks.
Parenting,ff7rztu,t1_ff7qaes,1579656935.0,"Exactly. Then they can articulate what they want to wear (hot sweater/jacket in 85 degree weather, etc.) and argue with you using actual words. And sometimes they have solid points."
bipolar,ff7j73k,t3_erzwgw,1579650810.0,It looks really good! I can’t even sew a little hole together lol I bet that is a great creative outlet keep it up.
Parenting,ff72ono,t1_ff6vc56,1579639916.0,"I wish I was more stern about this but I just can’t/won’t. I HATE arguing. It’s draining. I’ve had a long day. The last thing I want to do is fight over food at the end of the day with a 5 year old. Also, I think my main excuse for being lenient on this topic is that my son is a really good kid.  No behavioral issues. He’s a sweetie pie to be honest. So if he gets me every time at the dinner table..whatever lol if he was an absolute terror across the board and there were issues at school, etc. I would be second guessing my parenting."
AskWomen,ff6wyi3,t1_ff60g1h,1579636593.0,This is such a cool story and it sounds like you found yourself a really cool guy! Best of luck.
Parenting,ff6vr25,t1_ff6vgja,1579635878.0,Yea I was just saying in another reply that it’s a control thing. I’m confident he’ll outgrow it. He’s only 5 I got time lol thanks for the encouragement!
Parenting,ff6vicg,t1_ff6n623,1579635737.0,Same with my son. Honestly I think it’s just a control thing most of the time. He’s only 5. They want so desperately to be independent and I refuse to make dinner time a fight every night. I never make him finish something he tried and said he doesn’t like. Oh well. It’ll get better. I hope!
Parenting,ff6us6v,t1_ff6eu2v,1579635308.0,"That’s what I say to him! I’m like “seriously! It’s SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS” lol really hoping he snaps out of this phase this year. As I was saying in another response, he is a really good snacker and eats raw veggies with dip. My issue is strictly dinner. He’s just not a dinner kid I guess? Who knows. But goddamn it’s frustrating when they won’t eat what you’ve prepared after working hard all day and rushing home to cook."
Parenting,ff6uhho,t1_ff6rh03,1579635135.0,Yea I’m aware of this helping a lot with that but my issue is that I work and don’t get home until around 5:30 and by then I’m in a hurry to get dinner on the table before 7. I do let him help me on the weekends though and he loves to help. I guess I could give him little tasks even though I’m pressed for time during the week. He is actually a great snacker and will devour raw veggies with ranch and stuff like that. My only issue with him is dinner. I dunno what his deal is but 9/10 times he takes one bite and says NOPE. And I’m not strict about dinner time. I don’t want to sit there and fight at the dinner table every night and force him to eat something he has tried and claims he doesn’t like. So I always end up finishing my dinner and then making him something quick that I know he’ll eat like a cheese quesadilla or crackers and cheese or a quick hotdog (he would live on hot dogs if it were up to him and I try to keep hot dogs to a minimum but it’s hard)
Parenting,ff6cxjg,t3_ervp3h,1579624470.0,"I was the same for “terrible twos”. I thought the toddler years were hilarious. I know a lot of moms who would freak out about the tantrums but I always laughed at them and was able to reason with my son or just let him throw his fit and he was usually over it in a matter of minutes. 

Now..you wanna talk about the 4+ stage of getting him to eat what I’ve prepared for dinner? I HATE this picky eater phase and I internalize it and dread grocery shopping and cooking now. And I don’t even make “weird” stuff! He won’t even eat spaghetti and meatballs wtf."
Parenting,ff4ue1g,t3_erjp7v,1579572674.0,"I’m into fashion, though not a slave to it.  But I think I have sort of a Parisian/NYer kinda style. My son wants nothing to do with jeans or dressy kinda “cool” shirts. He lives in sweatpants/athletic pants and shorts with tshirts and sneakers. But they HAVE to be wide super soft comfy sneakers. I’ve never introduced him to sports since I’m not into them but he’s naturally showing an interest in them now. It’s like he’s a little jock in the making and I don’t like sports or do yoga or anything athletic so it’s kind of an opposite style thing going on too. I don’t even own a pair of yoga pants or running shoes."
Parenting,ff43cta,t1_ff38sem,1579554645.0,This is so cute.
aww,ff38sdx,t1_ff32n6q,1579536384.0,This. But his face has such a humble confidence to it. I love this dog!
BreakUps,ff36h5r,t1_ff2kq0u,1579534833.0,I’m really happy I could help you. It was like a light bulb went on in my head and I had to write it.
AskMen,ff1t1nc,t1_fepo5jz,1579485539.0,"Exactly.
If you look back at my dating history, I was all over the place in terms of looks. To me “hot” is “hot”. It’s about a man’s mind and his confidence and how he treats people. Don’t get wrong, there has to be a little physical attraction too but even then I don’t really have a type.  I dated an Egyptian guy before who looked very middle eastern, a Venezuelan, a blue eyed Ohio boy, a Philippino guy."
bipolar,ff1r9nu,t3_eqye8y,1579484434.0,I love all the art threads. Makes me feel like we bipolar folks really add our own special piece of glitter into the mix of this world. People like art.
bipolar,fevsktk,t1_feu3j4x,1579400947.0,Same!
bipolar,fevlt6u,t3_eqjg95,1579398860.0,Love.
Parenting,fetivd9,t1_fes5p22,1579375895.0,It’s positive in that everyone is supporting OP and sharing experiences but I’m learning that A LOT of teenagers reach a point where they’re embarrassed and ashamed of their parents’ jobs and in general. Really hope mine doesn’t have that phase.
AskMen,fep4ozg,t1_feowy1d,1579312067.0,That’s not true for me. I’m a blonde white woman and I wouldn’t say I love or hate Asian men. I’ve seen some hot Asian guys before and I’ve seen some ugly ones too. One of my mom’s doctors was this young hot Asian guy I had a big crush on him. Would bang 10/10.
Parenting,feoslki,t1_feo1cop,1579304830.0,Yes I’m loving the responses. Mine is 5 and I’m having a mid life career crisis lately and possibly going to school to become a nurse. I want to be able to provide a little better for my son and be able to find work anywhere and I want him to be proud of me. And then I stumbled onto this thread and thought “shit...”
aww,feoeyun,t1_fenwql0,1579299162.0,I love you.
relationship_advice,felogv0,t1_fcgywt0,1579227067.0,"“And if you want to do all that stuff as a parent, you still can. Literally nothing is stopping you”.  Hahahahahahah.  Hahahaha hahahahaha ha"
bipolar,felnu2l,t1_fek1v37,1579226636.0,There’s a funny cartoon meme that says something to the effect of” I love it when I tell a guy I’m “bi” and leave out the “polar” lol. Damnit now I have to go find it.
Parenting,fel463u,t3_epldut,1579213674.0,"This is such a beautiful post and I know exactly what you mean. I stayed home with my son the first year and we were so poor because of it but I would do it again in a minute. By the time he was around 1.5 i realized we (me and son) were starting to get bored with each other and I went back to work and he started daycare. First day of daycare he didn’t even cry or look back at me he was like “SEE YA!”. It was bittersweet. 

Is there a way for you to play hookie for a day and just hang out with your son at home and cuddle and play? It sounds like that’s what you need. Use a sick day, fuck it!"
Parenting,fegqote,t1_fef2ub7,1579100279.0,Aww sorry! Didn’t mean to give you feels. I get what you are saying though and I do enjoy him immensely. I’m not always snapping at him or annoyed by him. Even though inside I’m thinking “ugh...legos? Again?” I don’t say that. I’m always hugging on him and kissing and snuggling with him. He’s a big snuggler and I love every minute of it:)
bipolar,fefamw9,t1_feelqtz,1579052104.0,You don’t necessarily have to announce you have bipolar in those conversations but you can certainly say things like “well I hope she gets the love and support she needs. That’s a very tough and stigmatized illness”.
AskWomen,fedsjy3,t1_fed89l6,1579018979.0,TJ Maxx and Marshall’s always has great PJ pants selection. This post made me realize I need to treat myself to some. I saw an adorable pair over the holidays they had pink flamingos all over them and I stopped and admired them for a minute. I can’t believe I didn’t buy them they were so cheap like $12 or something.
AskReddit,fedj8ae,t1_fedidju,1579012911.0,Ok that makes sense. Thanks!
Parenting,fedhq1j,t3_eoiuhx,1579011818.0,"You’re not alone. I have a 5 year old with only child syndrome who wants undivided attention all the time. I don’t always enjoy “playing” with him. I’m not into legos and little boy stuff. He really likes being at home and playing with toys with me right there giving him constant attention, and I’m more of a “cmon let’s go to the beach! Get your suit on” kind of parent and we’re kinda clashing. I hope as he gets older he’ll be a little more spontaneous and want to get out more. But in the meantime, I struggle like you with the guilt. I know that I’m a good mom though. I tell myself that whenever I have a negative thought. You should do that too. It helps. You immediately interrupt the thought with “I’m a good mom and I love my kids”. I can tell by your post that you ARE a good mom. Because you give a shit about being a good mom."
AskReddit,fedfx2c,t1_fecbcg3,1579010439.0,May I ask what the difference is in transgender and cross dressing? I’ve never fully understood that or had the balls to ask.
bipolar,fecaozu,t3_eo9xly,1578969705.0,That thing is fucking cute. And looks very well crafted. Nice job. Try to sell them!
Parenting,fecafkv,t1_fec8pku,1578969558.0,Thank you so much for the info!
AskReddit,fec99ow,t1_febgs2n,1578968918.0,"I always thought transgendered just meant they identify with the sex they weren’t assigned, surgery or not. So I guess I was right."
Parenting,fec8fag,t3_eo9a40,1578968460.0,"One time while I was driving, my son (4 at the time) said to me, “Mommy...we don’t say SHIT and we don’t say FUCK, right?” And I was like ummmmmm... lol I decided to go a different route with bad words. Because I know that once in a while I slip and he probably hears me say one, I call them “grown up words” and I say kids aren’t supposed to say them it doesn’t sound nice they are just expressive grown up words."
Parenting,fec7qx1,t1_fec6taj,1578968111.0,I’m lost too. I’ve had 2 people tell me “YOU HAVE TO HAVE HIM TESTED it’s very important!” And I was like “for what?” And apparently you can request the school to test your kid like a placement test? I don’t know but the school certainly never talks about it at the conferences and meetings and stuff.
Parenting,fec7k40,t1_fec6axs,1578968017.0,Yea he’s a fun kid for sure. I haven’t gotten the 2nd report card and I don’t know what MAP testing is but I’ll look it up. I’m new to all this he’s my first (and last) kid. His teacher loves him and says he’s doing “just fine” and he’s a pleasure. But she hasn’t said anything about him being amazing or too advanced for the class. But he’s in a public school and we don’t have the best public school system to be honest.
Parenting,fec76p6,t1_fec5x3b,1578967823.0,I don’t see him as being some child genius but he is a very interesting and smart kid and I get complimented all the time by how “cool” and “smart” he is. He’s very artistic and loves to draw and also loves nature.  I encourage all of his interests but I’m guilty of not pushing him hard so that’s why I wanted some input. We practice sight words a little and I try to read 3 books to him every night but he likes Where’s Waldo and hidden picture books more and I cave a lot.
Parenting,fec5y0e,t1_fec5ml4,1578967176.0,"Yes, kindergarten. He’s also really good at legos and can easily do the ones meant for 7 and 8 year olds."
AskMen,febtggf,t1_febmwmr,1578962516.0,"My ex husband never respected this about me. I get so overwhelmed and filled with adrenaline in the beginning of a fight, and have a hard time regulating my emotions. I’ve learned over the years that I need a fuckin minute (or 30) before we can talk/argue like adults. I literally can’t argue right then and there when it begins and I can’t explain it. It’s like I turn into a hedgehog and just “NOPE” out of an argument and shut down."
