I even anticipated a few of the ""twists"" until the very last one.  Holy crap it did not end at all like I expected it to and it made the movie much darker in retrospect."

Damnthatsinteresting,fdp0lck,t1_fdowrwy,1578617158.0,Subsonic rounds are designed with a heavier projectile and lower powder load to keep the bullet below the sound barrier to prevent the supersonic crack that is usuallyassociated with firing a gun. They are generally used with suppressors to lower the decibel output even further.

DMAcademy,fdgb1ut,t3_el7kwx,1578387983.0,"A swarm of book mimics. 

 I'd Treat this as a hazard/trap instead of a straight combat encounter.  

They look like books, but when disturbed fly off the shelves flapping their covers like wings in a gargantuan swarm like bats.  A perceptive PC can spot that a few actual books and scrolls are left on the shelves.

Every time a PC ends their turn in one of the swarms squares d6 book mimics attach to the PC. At the start of the swarms turn each PC takes 1 acid damage per mimic stuck to them.  A PC can take an action on their turn to remove all book mimics currently attached to them

The book mimics are vulnerable to fire, and any PC holding an open flame like a torch can travel safely through the swarms squares.  

just nuking the swarm with a fireball is a solution, but not the best one, it will destroy the real scrolls and books that remain on the shelves."

MonsterHunterWorld,fcbrqea,t1_fcbmpnx,1577590233.0,"Every time you land a shell near it triggers and adds secondary explosive damage per shell so if I full burst lvl 7 normal shells near it I deal 6×65 for my shells, and then 6x50 for the WSB, nearly doubling my damage. I can also trigger another GL users WSB, but only for about 10% extra damage.

non GL things can trigger it for 8-10 extra damage, pretty much anything that is blast based, so sticky and cluster ammo, a kinsect blast cloud, bomb pods, mega bombs, etc."

Gunlance,fc6t3s7,t3_eghqp8,1577488798.0,"So far I've definitely seen sticky and cluster ammo and kinsect blast element clouds trigger it.

I think a blast cb discharge may have triggered it? I'm not sure about that one, it was a really hectic battle.  

The best synergy hunt I had was against a rajang, me (GL) another GL, and 2 hbg gunners.  Both GL would plant the WSB in the head, and the gunners would unload sticky ammo while we shelled it.  The rajang spent a ton of time staggered."

LifeProTips,fbyfkwg,t3_eevtso,1577215654.0,"I'm an adult and I have set up a few code phrases between myself and friends and family to extract myself from unwanted situations, or send out an emergency signal without tipping off anyone who may be watching.  

For example, my friend L, she hates it when people shorten her name in a specific way, because it sounds childish to her.  As a result if I text or call her and use that nickname, she knows that I need a polite excuse to exit my current situation, and will call me back in 5 minutes to give me that excuse.  I reciprocate the deal, if she ever texts or calls and uses my full first name, I give her an exit excuse in 5 minutes.

We also have a straight up emergency phrase that sounds innocuous, but if we ever hear it we should call the cops immediately to check on the person who says it because it means they are in serious danger.  We've never had to use it thank goodness, but it's nice to know we have it just in case."
