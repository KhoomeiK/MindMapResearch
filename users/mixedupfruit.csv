fo4,ff9lut1,t1_ff9ljur,1579715719.0,Tell me about it. I can't even keep my kids uniform that clean after one day at school. This dudes outfit survived nuclear warfare looking like he came out of a laundry ad.
Damnthatsinteresting,ff8e245,t3_es53oe,1579674583.0,"Question about the trees that were burnt in the fire. As long as they weren't totally obliterated to cinders, will they be able to recover and grow leaves again? Or are they literally done with their growing?"
CasualUK,fept7x8,t1_fen7e08,1579330461.0,It wasn't actual his car or him who crashed it.
AmItheAsshole,fenyk0d,t3_eq2ljg,1579292639.0,"Nta. A nice haircut and a change of colour can do wonders for a person's wellbeing. It can make you feel nice and fresh. On another point, it's just hair. Whatever you do to it ultimately is temporary. It'll grow back and the colour can be removed or will eventually grow out. It's not a big deal what she's had done but it probably feels it to her"

insaneparents,feh9x9k,t3_ep25ke,1579112197.0,My son doesnt play games behind my back. He plays them with me.
AmItheAsshole,fed7wwk,t3_eod3yu,1579002972.0,"Nta. You're not a taxi. You're not required to drive anyone anywhere. He didn't ask, he demanded and he saw how far that got him. Nowhere."
wholesomememes,fecx08g,t3_eo6yk4,1578988006.0,"I'm a mom. I've played games since I was little. My 5 year old saw me playing the new spyro and wanted a go. I started him his own game. He gets upset and cross when he gets it wrong, but I understand how it feels and know he needs to just learn. So i try to tell him where to go, what buttons to press and do the mom thing of getting him past the hard bits. I love the time we have doing it."
AmItheAsshole,fecwslx,t3_eo86ne,1578987753.0,"Yta. You're supposed to sit in the corner dressed as a nun, silently rocking until your daughter, YOUR WORLD, comes home so your life again has meaning. 
Really, Nta, you have a life still. You're allowed to do what you want on a 'free' day. If you just want to chill and have sex, so be it."
AmItheAsshole,fdpvgxa,t3_emimf3,1578642158.0,Nta. That was good foresight on your part. You just saw something in your house was running low and restocked it. Just shows you think about others when the item was something you don't use but your wife does. If she's that bothered though just let her run out and comment after you noticed they were running low but didn't want to seem 'creepy' in getting her some.
PublicFreakout,fdhx564,t1_fdhoya3,1578431755.0,Carrie Fisher was my second thought. Shirley Temple was my first.

AmItheAsshole,fc7yyqr,t3_eglpnh,1577522391.0,"Nta. You're not being unfair, you're actually being very very reasonable. She needs to learn there are consequences for her actions and needs to pay for what she breaks. She should also feel the affect of her actions and what your younger daughter feels. I don't think it would make a big enough impact if you just made her pay it back. You keeping hold of the bracelet until its paid back will be the lesson itself. She shouldn't get to keep nice things and be mean and break things, she broke it to upset her sister. Your younger daughter will also feel like her feelings are taken into consideration with this and probably not hold a grudge against her older sister at the end of it."

CasualUK,fbypdjn,t3_ef6ho2,1577222825.0,"""Do you want me to peel them? I mean we're only going to incinerate them, why not just bung em straight in the bin?"""
AmItheAsshole,fajgqxu,t3_e9bilu,1576136962.0,"Nta. I think your son sounds quite a reasonable sensible person and it will probably be because of you doing such things like this. He's now had experience with drinking alcohol and knows what his limit is. Yeah underage drinking is illegal, not suggested blah blah. But realistically they're going to do it. So your son goes into the party knowing what his limits is and with a game plan, but whilst being able to enjoy the party at the same time."
