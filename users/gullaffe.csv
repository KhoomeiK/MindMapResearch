Use quake or cleave on webshield and quickly switch to shield to get in a resonance from the reflect.  


During top path use devotion when killing spiders to extend duration.  


In p4 try to finish the last 25k as quickly as possible. I usually do devotion at around 40k build up to 100% and then do onslaught. Before i had onslaught i did deathswiftness drank a adrenaline potion and built up to a rapid fire."

Then there is more ground from the corner to the centre than there is from a point at the centre on one of the faces.

This makes the corner get pulled in and the eventually it will reach a state where the gravity is mostly equal everywhere.

So I think hypothetically a cube planet could be achieved with different density rocks to make it equal."

Im not arguing that its cruel just that this is obviously not weighting of a puppy."

Also stealth on a 4 health minion is boring since it's too hard to remove.

If I run up to you and say I'm buying your hat, it would make sense that you would(wanna) know the price offer.
It doesn't make sense for me to not have a price offer for an item that someone isn't actively selling.

nathanwpyle,fcx7oe0,t1_fc46ka6,1578054547.0,"10/4 is not infinitely repeating. Nor is 10/8.

Infinite repetion happens when the two numbers have factors that are relatively prime. 10 is relatively prime with 3 and 7 hence 3,6,7,9 are repeating.

Meanwhile 12 has 5,7,10.

16 Only having 2 as a factor means every odd number is infinitely repeating."
