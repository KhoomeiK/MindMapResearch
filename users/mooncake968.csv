relationship_advice,ff5zrvf,t3_ertsws,1579615387.0,"I always wear boxers they’re so comfy. If my boyfriend asked me to wear nice underwear to bed I’d tell him to fuck right off. Bedtime is comfy time it’s not a fucking fashion show. It’s dark, the covers are on, you’re about to go to sleep who cares. If he doesn’t find them attractive and wants to have sex then he can just take them off right away. Boom. They’re gone. Plus you literally brought up getting a yeast infection which is another valid point. It’s kinda controlling too if he won’t allow sex if you’re wearing something specific. Do what makes you feel comfortable"
relationship_advice,ff5yu0n,t1_ff5wlqe,1579614625.0,Ya she became nuts too. I remember she would try to close the door on me. I’d always want to play with her and she’d always make me wait and if I asked again she would scream at me and say she’s not going to play with me anymore because I bugged her. She decided to stay at her moms when she was younger though because life was way easier there because she never had to do anything. It’s crazy how much parents can influence their kids badly.

rant,ff5vivc,t3_ernr7m,1579611688.0,I had to do a little personal survey thing for my bio class and one of the questions asked me to say something interesting about myself. I couldn’t think of shit so all I said was “I have 5 cats” she probably read that and thought that was the stupidest response ever

relationship_advice,fepkyt8,t3_eqap9q,1579323233.0,If that works best for you guys then who cares. If you’re both happy and it’s working for you guys then go for it. Sleeping good is so important

cats,fep35ux,t1_feowo5d,1579311090.0,"That’s not it. It’s that you said “you’re way too young, this is a place for adult content” on this subreddit. It would’ve been different if it was a NSFW subreddit but it was kinda stupid to refer to adult content when OP posted on a subreddit about cats. I just thought it was funny and tried to make a joke out of it. Sorry lol"

ottawa,fe02et1,t3_en1s4v,1578801371.0,"I go to uOttawa so I was driving in one morning, about to get off at Lee’s and there was an accident. It was pretty bad the entire car was destroyed, they were lucky to be alive. I stopped right away to make sure everyone was okay. The guy driving asked me to give him a drive. I told him I couldn’t because I was late for class. I checked on the girlfriend and she was in shock, then she was brought to someone else’s car so she could wait for the cops and paramedics to show up. 

I went to check on the other people involved because their car had a bit of damage. They asked me who was driving and I told them the man was. Then they asked me where he was. I pointed at the Nicholas/Lees exit and said “umm he’s over there”. He was running away down the exit away from the accident! 

Then I went to go check on his girlfriend again. Other people who stopped to help told me she said that she’s pregnant and doesn’t know where she is. That was a great morning before class."

Another place I really like is bad dog Ottawa. I think I saw a few stores for vintage stuff downtown too, but I can’t remember the names. Value village and Salvation Army usually have lots too!"
