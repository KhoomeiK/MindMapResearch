ThriftStoreHauls,ffe6tay,t1_ffe65c5,1579838237.0,I agree about the BFE. I have found one really nice old piece of folk art since I moved here. An old chest with square nail hinges and a carved decorated front that looks like an African Mud cloth pattern. I keep meaning to post it to r/antiques and get their opinion. May do that tomorrow.  Supposed to be from Virginia. Please look if you have time.
ThriftStoreHauls,ffe35u7,t1_ffe2bp8,1579835486.0,"Thanksüêù I do look at the glass cases in the front first and then the items I'm hunting. You just seem to be finding amazing things. For me, it comes in waves and there are days I leave with nothing. I will admit to a primitive furniture fetish."

tea,ffdo5l5,t3_et1ylu,1579825038.0,"I'm a chai tea fanatic and I have had tea with and without sludge. I think it's the fiber from the spices and the way the tea is introduced into the water. A tea bag will help filter out the fiber residue while loose leaf, of course, is not always filtered. Temperature may also play a role. I would just ask next time you have some chai there-if they're amiable."
ThriftStoreHauls,ffdhp9r,t1_ffc2gca,1579821096.0,"Well, I think you're very gracious to take all the criticism so well. You might try r/antiques for something like this. They have a lot of dealers on that sub who can help you. Awesome find-thanks for sharing."

AskAnAmerican,fewlgj6,t1_fewk5d3,1579413597.0,"Wow! I can't believe someone told you that. It's inflammatory, incorrect and was designed to scare you. Follow your dream and come back over and visit anywhere you want in America. Most people will ask you where are you from and then tell you about their travel experiences. Also, please remember, the world has changed so much in the last 15 years-You have your cell phone and camera. Really can't go anywhere without some kind of surveillance if that makes you feel any safer."
AskAnAmerican,few7t8b,t3_eqkvgm,1579406590.0,Gotta ask where are you from that you would believe such inflammatory nonsense!  How many reports do you have of foreigners visiting small southern towns being murdered by christians? Are you aware that a lot of the nationalities that you listed move to southern states to take advantage of the warmer weather and the cost of living?
AskAnAmerican,few6n3p,t1_fetlkst,1579406048.0,Yes. It is.
AskAnAmerican,few596s,t3_eqlegc,1579405588.0,"When I lived in Texas I took my 4 dogs and rented a cabin for a week in the Arkansas Ozarks. Best vacation I ever had-hands down. There is also a highway in the western part of the state where you drive through the Boston Mtns. The highway is ABOVE the treetops and it looks like you are driving through miles and miles of green broccoli. Hot Springs is quirky place, like Austin Tx before the rest of the world discovered it.
Edit: Forgot to mention taking a drive through the mountains on hwy 7. Lots of twists and turns and great views."

AskAnAmerican,fetfgun,t1_fet24lw,1579374925.0,"Yes PALS!!. Moved to East Tennessee from Texas 4 years ago. Love my PALS burgers. They come with mayo only-no must or ketchup-cheese, lettuce and tomato. It's a little box of a restaurant in blue with a giant burger, fries and drink on top. YOU order on one side and pay on the other-no eating in! Best ice tea I ever had not from home. They're (29 stores)only in the east tenn/southwest va areas. They also serve bbq on a hotdog bun and a 'chipped ham' sandwich. The line usually runs out of the parking lot onto the highway frontage at all PALS during peak hours. My order: Double Jr with cheese and a plain tea with lemon. Heaven!!https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g55135-d1572730-Reviews-Pal_s-Kingsport_Tennessee.html"

When our relatives visit this is an absolute must stopping place along with Dunkin Donuts-coffee and pastry.

cats,fet2c81,t3_eqjfie,1579371183.0,I also think she likes the rug. If there was a bug in there she'd be after it. I used to have a cat that broke it's leg and the whole time the cast was on she lay in the litterbox. They are so tactile. When I curl up in my chair to watch tv they ignore me until I break out the blanket and then it's on.

intermittentfasting,fen8yvy,t3_eq29h4,1579279571.0,My opinion-if this is all you are eating and you are ill that would cause your stomach to growl-it's using up calories trying to battle virus etc. Please eat something light along the lines of whatever you eat when ur not fasting. Can you please tell me why the stomach growling means you broke your fast? Thanks

Call the clinic that you plan to use and ask about aftercare-they should be happy to help. Some places use a patch for pain relief. When you get the carpets cleaned-lock them in the bathroom. The carpet cleaners will stress them out.
EDIT: law require rabies shot that they can give at time of surgery"

That goes on a roller with chemicals-I think- and then you hand crank them out. Eventually uses up the carbon and that's why some copies are lighter and fuzzier. Ref: Mr Hand's class@Fast Times R H.
