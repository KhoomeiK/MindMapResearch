sydney,feekadt,t3_eopp08,1579035467.0,"I worked for a family-owned retail IT store in the mid-2000's that was like this.  Sadly, well outside the 6 year statute of limitations for wage claims, but I'll share for the sake of adding weight to the sort of practices that go on.

They had a brick and mortar store as well as an online presence.  Effectively there were two separate teams.  I was in the online team, processing orders and payments, and picking and packing goods.  We all worked in the same building, and the online orders were fulfilled from the floor stock.  So there was a fair bit of interaction between the two.  To get in and out you needed to walk through the retail section.

They required everyone to turn up half an hour early for work, but didn't pay us for that.  We were reprimanded for being ""late"" if we didn't comply.  They argued that the floor staff needed time to set up before opening.  Those of us in the online section were expected to come in at the same time out of ""fairness"", even though our setup was basically just turning our computers on.  When I asked what I should do with the other  29 minutes before my official 9am start time I was told that I shouldn't be sitting at my desk doing nothing.  When I asked whether I could either be paid for this additional time or be exempt I was yelled at and fired.

The store closed at 5pm, but the shutdown wasn't allowed to start until the last customer had left.  No-one was allowed to leave in this time, including the online team, who had to walk through the shop floor to exit.  We were told to ""look busy"" while we waited.  So effectively we were all routinely working an additional, unpaid half-hour (sometimes more) each day.

Each month there was a mandatory evening of stocktake.  We all had to stay until every last item was accounted for, which could take 3-4 hours.  They gave us dinner and an extra half-hour break to eat it as compensation.  The hours themselves were never paid, and we couldn't take it as time in lieu."

Australia has a reputation for being racist. It's also apparently the most multi-cultural country in the world.

My theory is this: we're perceived as more racist because we are openly trying to work through our feelings towards and interactions with cutures from across the world *at the same time* as we're trying to find our own place in the world as a relatively new nation.

There are plenty of modern nation states that had the luxury of closed borders while they developed an identity. Australia did not. White Australia is only a few hundred years old, and heavily influenced by its British roots. Anything we've done in our own right has happened at a time of world-wide flux (e.g. wars), which has brought it's own impacts of change and waves of migrant intakes. As such, there wasn't much that was culturally ""Australian"" before we started to take on people from elsewhere.

Contrast this to some of the major mono-cultures of the world. Japan and China, for instance. They are notoriously low on ""foreign"" residents, yet they don't seem to get the same hate for being racist. That's just how it is there. Isn't it quaint that they have their own ways, and that other racial groups are so uncommon that they warrant unsolicited touching and photos? /s

I'm not denying that individuals can behave horribly. I'm also not denying that we have a proven history of racist policy (*terra nullius* and poor treatment of Aboriginal people, the White Australia Policy, detention centres- none of which I condone). But we're certainly not as backwards as some people make out.

We're actually living multi-culturalism. Surely we deserve more credit than places that have all-but closed their borders and buried their heads in the sand?

We're trying to work out how to all live together and get along. We're having the difficult conversations. Granted, not always civilly. And it sounds like people from non-white backgrounds are bearing the brunt of our teething pains on a personal level (sorry!).  But we're trying, and we're slowly moving forward.

We are unique. We are better and stronger and richer together. You just might have to bear with us while we work out the kinks..."
