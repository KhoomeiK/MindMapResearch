Ya its recyclable but we already have a sand shortage and this would only make it worse. I would love a better solution but have no idea what would work.

todayilearned,fevdwdx,t1_fev7g7v,1579396303.0,But the problem is they are not meant to fill a roll. They were bred to be non aggressive they succeeded . cows are domesticated yet they do not possess all the things you described. The experiment was not created to make pets the experiment was created to see how domestication works by picking a trait and breeding for it. They succeeded . if the experiment now switched to breeding foxes to pee when told for the next 50 years I am sure theunwpuld succeeded as well .

todayilearned,fetd15o,t1_fetby19,1579374058.0,Not exaxtly many apples are exactly the same as they were 150 years ago. You cannot breed a specific Apple to be different. Each type of apple is genetically identical. More modern apples might be less nutritious but many apple varieties we have are over 150 years old.
todayilearned,fers064,t1_ferkigo,1579357696.0,"It has not failed at all. Plus its a ongoing process. I wish to see where ypy found that they ""failed"""
todayilearned,ferrtwy,t1_ferj5jp,1579357628.0,You clearly have not read anything about this. Its a research project into domestication. They are domesticating the foxes its a ongoing process. The have released papers and given great insite into domestication. According to the papers thr foxes seem to have or be gaining all the traits of a domesticated dog. This is not a random process its very selective breeding so it will be a much faster process than the origional random domestication of wolves.
DisneyPlus,ferq55i,t1_ferkkux,1579357066.0,Yes i know they all do. The point is that the episode is not really about makeup. At all. Also i have no problem with anything anyone does or how anyone is. Only that the episode has nothing to do with makeup. Watch it before commentinf something back.
DisneyPlus,fephzq0,t1_fep29nr,1579320992.0,The make up one sucked the most. Its was more about drag queens than make up. Barely anything about normal women wearing makeup either even when they talked about makeup.

Naturewasmetal,fenda14,t1_fen42fv,1579282218.0,Exactly we can maybe tell when a female nearing egg laying time was a female due to increased bone mass in a particualar bone. But even that is a guess. Also the current largest t rex scotty does not have that bone build up. Another thing may be that males died earlier having to roam farther into other territories to find and fight for females. While females could stick to a single area just waiting for males. So the males were more likely to get in a accident  or suffer a injury durimg battle for a female. Just a theroy.
