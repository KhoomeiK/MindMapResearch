Marriage,fdhtr44,t3_el2xs1,1578430000.0,"Just got married, but my husband and I always find time to hang out at home, smoke weed together and either watch something stupid or play video games as a way to destress. I also love giving him head rubs after a long day or we cook for each other at home.

We also love traveling so whenever we have a chance, we go on hikes or just explore. I find that nature + us together really makes us feel more connected ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Marriage,fdfxp7h,t1_fdf7w2m,1578373102.0,Thank you so much for this!!
Marriage,fdegakx,t3_ekqcpi,1578338390.0,Yes ‚ù§Ô∏è
Marriage,fdebi8z,t1_fddgf0k,1578335399.0,YES!
Marriage,fdebhpg,t3_ekqcpi,1578335390.0,YES!!!
Marriage,fdebgew,t3_ekqcpi,1578335368.0,I like that a lot and I get it. I‚Äôm more empathetic than my husband so I sometimes absorb his emotions as my own. Takes a conscious effort to not to and also not base my happiness on him!
Marriage,fdebbin,t1_fdeb754,1578335282.0,I love this so much and this is what we‚Äôre trying to do as well. Thank you for sharing!
Marriage,fdd4cn9,t1_fdd487d,1578294252.0,Emotional?
OCD,fcgyjoh,t3_eh5c19,1577645360.0,Omg yes
depression,fc67wu3,t1_fc67o88,1577474319.0,"I think balance is key because you‚Äôll need to trust one way or the other. Yes safer alone, but dont be afraid to take risks also. Eventhough I am down right now, I still do believe that there are still people worth trusting left in this world."
depression,fc67ep2,t1_fc673r9,1577473988.0,"Ideally yes, and I understand. I trust too easily and it never works out lol"
depression,fc66rax,t1_fc66j08,1577473553.0,"I can only speak for myself because Im generally a happy person but some days when I‚Äôm not, people can‚Äôt believe or I should be over it right away because I‚Äôm strong.. sometimes though I need a day or two."
depression,fc66dvb,t1_fc6603i,1577473308.0,"I know, the funniest people are the saddest ones. It‚Äôs hard. Goodluck to you, we got this."
depression,fc617d0,t1_fc60n1h,1577469962.0,"Hope you‚Äôre well, and it‚Äôs glad to know I‚Äôm not alone."
depression,fc5ph5u,t3_eg9dzt,1577463195.0,"I feel this still every now and then even if I‚Äôm already with someone who loves me. If it‚Äôs something you‚Äôve struggled with for a while, even being with someone will still make you feel like you‚Äôre not the one. It takes time and effort, but you have to choose yourself first and it wouldn‚Äôt matter who chooses you. You got this, it‚Äôs hard I know."
offmychest,fc4s9a7,t1_fc42dqk,1577426505.0,"I cannot disagree on this, the world is so different now. I was living in Los Angeles paying $1700 for a studio apartment. It‚Äôs a waste."
offmychest,fc4s3ie,t1_fc4p046,1577426345.0,"True, some days are darker than others but there is a glimmer of hope."
offmychest,fc4kjyk,t1_fc4ifvx,1577419375.0,"Omg yes. It just never feels the same, as adults all we do is work - time has hardened us, trust is harder to give. Although I do love who I am now, I miss the ignorance and being naive. It‚Äôs easier to be happy that way."
AmItheAsshole,fc4071d,t1_fc3znpn,1577403180.0,"Thank you so much and dont worry, I know I‚Äôm being the asshole here. Seriously thank you for the bluntness though because I needed to hear it. I‚Äôm hoping that over time I also don‚Äôt feel or even think about those things anymore, I just needed to talk it out to someone without feeling dumb about it.

I hate that I feel the way that I feel and I need to do something about it. I just don‚Äôt know how to start."
AmItheAsshole,fc3zwv6,t1_fc3zmx8,1577402968.0,"Thank you for understanding, I‚Äôm trying to get counseling or maybe even find a group online which is why I thought of posting on reddit. I know but I think he just feels frustrated, unfortunately he‚Äôs not very proud of his past and I understand how it can feel having to explain it.

I do want to really get over this, accepting is the first part."
AmItheAsshole,fc3zkph,t1_fc3zapp,1577402715.0,"I know, it‚Äôs harder than it seems lol but I really am trying. And yeah, I grew up in a country without divorce and people are so close minded. Although I remind myself that I‚Äôm no longer part of that, it creeps up on you sometimes. It‚Äôs really just a big insecurity I have that I need to get over, hopefully soon."
AmItheAsshole,fc3zd8n,t1_fc3z5t3,1577402561.0,"I am looking into therapy and also reading as much as I can and being more aware of my actions, I think I‚Äôve improved a lot since being with him. I guess I needed to rant out here even if I do know I‚Äôm being the asshole in this situation. 

And I agree. I will do my best to control and stop these thoughts until one day hopefully it becomes just white noise."
AmItheAsshole,fc3z4ta,t1_fc3yy57,1577402387.0,"I want to, but I dont have insurance now. Im working on it. Now, I try to read and meditate as much as I can in hopes of being able to control my emotions better."
AmItheAsshole,fc3yvi1,t1_fc3ypa7,1577402188.0,"I know and I try not to, but he knows me so well that even a slight difference on my face already tells him I‚Äôm reacting. I want to be completely over this and accept this new culture Im in, it‚Äôs just so hard when I dont have anyone to talk to this honestly about because I already know how stupid it sounds."
offmychest,fc3ym1h,t1_fc3tq87,1577401992.0,"I moved countries and had to start from scratch. And coming from knowing everyone to no one, I‚Äôve seen how people are I guess.

I always thought that if you‚Äôre nice, nice things happen to you. But even if I try so hard, it seems like life always challenges me to be harder instead of nicer."
offmychest,fc3ifk3,t1_fc3ht0x,1577390495.0,"I know, it‚Äôs unfortunate. And the grass is always greener on the other side, no matter how we look.

A lot of the darkness I have seen in my 20s when some people already had good boundaries and learned from their mistakes. I think no matter how we are, everyone deals with different shit."
relationship_advice,fc3hrtg,t1_fc3ewra,1577390082.0,Thank you for the advice.
relationship_advice,fc3eei4,t1_fc3dtxo,1577387960.0,"I‚Äôm usually good at making sense to my feelings. And since I cant go to therapy now due to finances, I go on websites like reddit reading and venting. Thank you for the concern and that is very valid. I know this issue is mainly me and this is something I am ok working on in my own and know that I value my marriage more than my ego. I‚Äôm looking to going to therapy sometime soon and my husband as well, both separately then together if needed. I love him and I know I am willing to work on this."
relationship_advice,fc3citj,t1_fc3c9n9,1577386776.0,"There are a lot of issues, I agree."
offmychest,fc3ccrr,t1_fc3b415,1577386669.0,"I had an overprotected childhood, so for me it‚Äôs been a drastic difference. And I am left with appreciation and a bit of resentment with my parents. They loved me and sheltered me, I wish they told me how cruel the world could be cause I found it out all on myself.

Sending you positivity in this dark world."
relationship_advice,fc3c5kf,t1_fc3aryb,1577386541.0,"Thank you so much for this. I think I need to talk to someone or let this out even if it sounds stupid lol

And yeah I know. And I know that he is happy with me, no doubt. Im hoping letting this is out is gonna slowly help me. Thanks again"
relationship_advice,fc39znm,t1_fc39q2o,1577385060.0,"That‚Äôs exactly my point, I know it‚Äôs stupid to assume that. I am asking for advice to cope and how I can fix it from my side because they are not doing anything wrong.

I guess growing up in a culture with no divorce it‚Äôs weird for me to be so open about it. I recognize that this effort should come to me, just have no one to talk to about it. So, hello Reddit."
relationship_advice,fc39nwj,t1_fc38n8c,1577384831.0,"He has never given me a reason to believe anything, which is why I know it‚Äôs me that needs to work on this."
Marriage,fbz4kpt,t1_fbykx86,1577234885.0,I‚Äôm a very committed person and I‚Äôd rather be upfront with him than ever go out for anyone else‚Äôs attention. And he‚Äôs doing better üòä
Marriage,fbz4h0e,t1_fbyju5r,1577234797.0,"I think everybody has insecurities, I myself have days when I need reassurance. My fiance has his, but he works on it and we deal with it together. I wouldn‚Äôt marry someone that I don‚Äôt see is willing to work on being better."
