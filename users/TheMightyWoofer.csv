worldnews,ff6jjgj,t1_ff5l1g5,1579628554.0,"I had this. It was in Canada. one of the infected had been holidaying in Mexico and came back to Canada for work: he was a blood technician at a city hospital and was fevered and coughed a few times. He did my mom's bloodwork and while they were talking, she found out he had been to Mexico (this was before the outbreak was an *outbreak*). So she came home, got sick, I ended up taking care of her, I got sick, we both ended up almost dying, my dad took care of us (he and my two brothers didn't get it, which was interesting), and we *eventually* recovered. I coughed up some weird-ass massive blood clot that had a vein in it and once I did that, I felt 99% better."

She kept sitting on the male and trying to smother him. I had to keep lifting her up or carefully pulling him out from under her. He survived and turned out to be a big boned 20 pound male who chirps and is a lap cat and has poops the size of a corgie and purrs and drools when he's happy."

I let her out one morning in the summer so she could go pee and got caught up with something else so she just curled up outside in the orchard eating fallen fruit and digging up grubs in the ground but then around 9pm I asked my parents if they had seen her since dinner. Nope, none of us had seen her so I went outside and called her and she emerged from the orchard happy as a clam. She was find outside, but we couldn't trust her with her coyote/shepherd minion because they would get into trouble together."
