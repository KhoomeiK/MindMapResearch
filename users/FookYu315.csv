[Cold shock response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_shock_response)

>In animals, cold shock response is perhaps the most common cause of death from immersion in very cold water,[1] such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning."
Whatcouldgowrong,fdbr3lr,t1_fdb8k85,1578260598.0,"This is completely false. You can drown immediately due to the cold shock response. Fall in, gasp and inhale water, done.

You're being pretty irresponsible talking out your ass like that."

After that, he ate more than 250 shits for his job and also began enjoying eating it in his private life. This curry is based on real experience."
