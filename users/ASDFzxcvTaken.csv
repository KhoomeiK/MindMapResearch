playingcards,ffcu3ju,t1_ff7og9c,1579807285.0,"A brand that gets no love on here, but seems to catch the eye of older generations who just play to pass time is Piatnik. Their artwork tends to be old school. The quality  is fine for casual play but definitely not for cardistry or marathon high intensity use."
playingcards,ffcsa8w,t1_ff83ya9,1579806224.0,"While you are right about how they are marketed, I think you will agree there's a big difference between the quality of stuff you get at like souvenir shops or other inexpensive ""playing card"" decks.

  Yes, USPCC is the standard and generally perform fine, and to get much ""better performance"" is a personal preference, but you can certainly get worse. Heck there are some of the real cheap quality decks that certain cards will stick together when the texture of the cards line up."
Darts,ffcraao,t3_es89q3,1579805627.0,"I've been on and off since I was like 10. This is what makes darts challenging and fun. 

I hadn't thrown a dart in years, walked into a pub and was casually shooting around with a random pickup of 301. They asked me to play in their league game that night.  I did really good. Turned out to be beginners luck. I joined their team and sucked the first few weeks back, but eventually it comes back, the Thousands of darts thrown over the years, and finally I hit the board."
Darts,ffcp0vx,t3_esednf,1579804148.0,Baseball. It's great for all skill levels especially beginners. It forces you to aim at more of the unused spaces on the dartboard. It keeps you moving all around the board and helps you learn the numbering as you play.

AskReddit,ff742la,t1_ff6zi7i,1579640707.0,"Presumably the parents could/should already know her answer, and its a question to ask for confirmation from him... if she said our plans are to do x and my intention is to date him. And the boy is ""like uh, IDK we're going to Y and my intention is uh I don't know to have her home and happy"". You have two stories.

AskReddit,ff6xzjl,t1_ff6u8as,1579637201.0,"It's not always confrontational but it is a test of wits and and respect, the response will be judged and the parents response to your response is also important. 

If your response is ""well I intend to do what she and I discussed, which is x, y, and z (all above board) and have her home by hh:mm. Does that work for you?(smile)"" 

the response from the parent will be very telling of the relationship they have and you will have."

SluttyConfessions,fdrf6mf,t3_emv28a,1578683662.0,Girl when I was in college had a picture of her favorite female pornstar on the inside of her folder. She casually would open it like she was looking for a piece of paper. It was a great conversation starter. She said something along the lines of liking to keep a reference to women who can own their sexuality and how she can too. Needless to say we banged in the parking lot and I gave her homework to bring a new role model every week. That was a fun class.
