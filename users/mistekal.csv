Wouldnt do NYE there again, but was a great trip with great moments 🙂 might be a ""do it once"" type of deal"

books,fck7aca,t3_ehit8g,1577718572.0,"There's no reason why you can't try to mix both, my friend! 

I read and love Stephen King. I'm also re-reading Harry Potter for the 3rd time. They're fun, you get lost in the world...IT by Stephen King was an amazing journey, I actually kissed the cover when I finished lol.

No shame in reading what you enjoy. Getting lost in a story is beautiful in its own way.

Now that being said, I also enjoyed Brave New World, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, 1984, Albert Camus.....which might be considered more ""literature"" with commentary on society and humanity.

I've also read classics that I absolutely hated and couldn't finish. I say read what interests you, ignore the snobs! but definitely feel free to check out the list of classics...you'll find some that you'll love for sure!"

Some books I will always keep for life, like I'd cry if I lost them : 

• The Great Gatsby

• The Little Prince

• Jonathan Livingston Seagull

I love their stories. Also will always have Harry Potter with me for life!"
AskReddit,fcbrltu,t1_fcbqdyt,1577590193.0,"Yeah, for instance someone above commented they were happy that people stopped by and dropped off  food.

I would have HATED that. After I lost my brother this year, trust me I was not eating, not sleeping. My house got messy.

The last thing I would have wanted is someone coming over, making me get up and socialize. That would have stressed me out like no tomorrow. 

And food? Well like I said, wasn't eating.

I understand vague isn't fun, but make sure your offer is also something the person truly wants."

Or chased them with a knife.

Now most people are good and wouldn't ever dream of doing this, but it's possible.

The job of the police and justice system is to evaluate if this can be proven. That's why we have innocent until proven guilty and reasonable doubt."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fc6p867,t1_fc5tud7,1577486012.0,"This is just my feelings on the topic, so obviously just one person's point of view I'm trying to articulate...and I don't know your life and what you do with it.

When you go outside things tend to happen, good or bad.

You slip on ice. A cute little squirrel runs up to you. You get lost. You strike up a conversation with a stranger. You find a new restaurant by chance. You hear someone sing and they have an amazing voice. You bump into an old coworker. A bird shits on your head. Etc etc etc.

What I'm trying to say is that life tends to happen outside, that's where you get memories, funny moments, stories, things to remember. 

Don't get me wrong, I've had great super enjoyable nights alone at home too - i used to chat with people all night long in my early 20s, it was great.

Last new years I drank rum and coke alone and watched Shrek, perfectly timed where they start singing and dancing at midnight lol.

I value being quiet and reading a book. 

It's not that it's boring, but there's also that little part where staying in too much means not experiencing something new or breathtaking. Missing out on memories that would have happened if you stepped outside rather than eatch a rerun of The Office."

But!! What if you have a choice?

http://imgur.com/gallery/9p0MrxJ

You go to the store and see these two Neil Gaiman books with different covers. There is one I love and one I find hideous. Of course I'll grab the one that will look nicer on my shelf.

Same story, but you can experience joy in having a nice bookshelf and appreciate the nice design too."
