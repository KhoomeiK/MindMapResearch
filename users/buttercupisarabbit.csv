aww,ff54l5g,t3_erp6q5,1579580066.0,Sounds about right
Rabbits,ff4li3m,t3_erlk3v,1579566507.0,"I recommend just kicking her off the sofa entirely until she can handle it. Buttercup (my rabbit) always goes pee on the bed/duvet, but she’s good on the couch and is entirely potty trained now. It takes time and patience!"
progresspics,fermuri,t3_eqgnr8,1579355921.0,You look really good- congrats!
relationships,fehr2to,t1_fehqx05,1579122187.0,Yeah girl- sorry you gotta let him go.
Rabbits,fec7fvk,t3_eoehgd,1578967956.0,Absolutely adorable!!! Beautiful markings.
Rabbits,febpdp4,t1_fe6kwsm,1578961286.0,"She was spayed when she was barely a year old- she's just a straight badass rabbit. I call her my alpha cat-rabbit, seeing as I have an alpha cat, and a beta cat, but the alpha cat rabbit controls everything."
Rabbits,fe6grpp,t1_fe6c4fh,1578890419.0,"Thank you for the feedback-this is my first bun. She has always challenged me and still likes to growl, lunge, and nip when she doesn't get her way. The other day I got a video of her hopping over to both cats while eating, nudging the girl cat out of her way, and eating her dry food. Crazy!"
Rabbits,fe685zt,t1_fe606qf,1578883904.0,My cats have minimal survival or hunting skills. So this helps as they see the rabbit as essentially a cat.
Rabbits,fe67s5x,t1_fe5zp0h,1578883681.0,"Interesting jnformation- thank you for that. I have two cats, a 9 yr old male and 3 yr old female. The rabbit is 5. The rabbit has established dominance through growling and lunging. The older cat is afraid of her, and the younger female cat loves her. The rabbit will purposely dominant the cats whenever she can. If the cats are getting pets- she runs over, hops on the couch, and pushes the cats out of her way to get pets. The cats seem to have an attitude that if they leave her alone she will leave them alone.

Its very strange behavior and everyone that witnesses the phenomenon agrees."
Rabbits,fe5vpyn,t1_fe5iwt1,1578876008.0,I suppose how the home set up is- potty box/hay box set up. Looking for ways to improve/sustain positive behavior traits. Im particularly curious if anyone else has cats with their free roam rabbit.
RATS,fe48dcn,t1_fe47ziw,1578856749.0,"Maybe it’s scar tissue or an issue with the tumor being from the same gland area. I think as long as she’s eating and energetic you are fine. I had 4 removed from 1 rat, and 3 removed from her sister. It was kind of ridiculous one of them was always getting a tumor removed from they bounced back and seemed just fine. I’d say keep your hopes high and ride it out."
RATS,fe47qzo,t3_enrspy,1578856529.0,Was it not a mammary gland tumor? Females frequently get them. I have several removed from my girls when they were alive.
