trashy,ff8h1ny,t1_ff8gtwk,1579678141.0,Exactly. I got fired from a company called defenders who installs security systems for ADT. I refused to install a system in a guys house who was black out drunk. He called and complained and I got fired. I fought it and won my unemployment case.

AMA,fevxnx8,t1_fevwiqt,1579402815.0,Wish you a speedy recovery brother. I can deal w a nut punch feeling for few more days if it means no more babies. We‚Äôve had our fill lol.
AMA,fevw7p4,t3_eqqmuy,1579402206.0,"How‚Äôs the recovery? I heard that‚Äôs where you can tell people were chopping up things in your sack. Some guys say it‚Äôs fine, others get elephant balls"
AMA,fevut1w,t3_eqqmuy,1579401791.0,"How was the procedure? We are pregnant with our 4th now, so as soon as he is here I was going to smash the boys on a rock,  but a vasectomy might be a better option haha"

Hunting,fdiwk82,t1_fdiuebl,1578452662.0,"I love being in the woods. I fish now, and have tagged along hunting w friends just to see it, but have never gone w the intent of bagging something. I‚Äôve been saying the last couple years ‚Äúthis is the year,‚Äù but then haven‚Äôt gone. This is hopefully the year."
Hunting,fdiu0s9,t1_fdit5c6,1578451017.0,"Hope you‚Äôre safe from the fires. I have a friend in Sydney and she has sent us pics of how bad it is. It‚Äôs terrible.

AskReddit,fdf3m0o,t1_fdf0h6y,1578352536.0,I hope to god this is sarcasm. Working a set schedule is how the real world works. Having the respect to keep that schedule and not blow your employer off is what adults do. A no call no show is a slap in the face.

todayilearned,fd50qni,t1_fd3gwb1,1578173031.0,"It‚Äôs like wrestling, all about hip control. I learned from my wife, you use one hand to hold down their belly and hips and use the other hand, then lift the legs and do the business and slid the diaper under. Then back to the hip control. Works great."
todayilearned,fd50fm2,t1_fd45ntp,1578172926.0,... May have to try the ol pile driver changing technique

AskReddit,fd2l38w,t1_fd2j0w2,1578148757.0,Holy fuck. My wife and I dealt w a miscarriage when I worked in the oil field and my company was amazing. My bosses gave me their truck (as we were on a pad in the middle of nowhere) and I drove the 5 hours home in 3. If I ever found out my wife‚Äôs employer was doing this I‚Äôd flip out completely. People can be such shit.

AskReddit,fd2ijsf,t1_fd0q80w,1578147750.0,"I like this. I made pizza baskets for everyone this year, home made dough, sauce, everything, and then wrote funny instructions and told them they had to do it with their SO and send me a pic. I‚Äôm trying to get away from giving just ‚Äústuff,‚Äù and trying to give things that people will create memories with. The lessons are a great idea."

&#x200B;

1.) He KNOWINGLY kidnapped himself and Joe. He set it up. There is no trauma at all in that for Forty.

2.) Drugging someone is never ok. Ever. Doesnt matter the intent."

CFB,fchjgwq,t1_fchj2id,1577651049.0,Haha I know a few of those as well. I live in PA so I get shit from my friends all the time for not being a PSU fan.
CFB,fcglhw5,t1_fcgkoko,1577641366.0,"Agreed, most buckeye fans are bad. I pride myself on not being one of the gloating ones. I sure hope so, the big 10 is gonna be tight the next couple years I think."
CFB,fcft7jc,t1_fcfrz7z,1577633490.0,"I agree it‚Äôs not all the refs, they let Lawrence march down in 4 plays. I disagree w the roughing the punter call though. I‚Äôve watched it a few dozen times, the defenders pulled up and are leaning backwards. The punter literally jumped into them, finishing his ‚Äúkick‚Äù in the cannonball position. I don‚Äôt think they should be calling for a punt block regardless,  but I really don‚Äôt think they should have called that roughing. Oh well, you live and learn."
CFB,fcfrter,t1_fccub7v,1577633151.0,"As an OSU fan, I Love this response. I try to be humble and show empathy when we win too. Haven‚Äôt seen much of it from Clemson fans, so it‚Äôs nice to see. Thanks for being a good sport."
CFB,fcfqoh2,t1_fceyb7p,1577632787.0,You know damn well there is footage out there of Cris Carter or Jerry Rice messing up an assignment. It happens. His route running on most plays is top notch. He just fucked up.
OhioStateFootball,fc73na0,t1_fc5uv4x,1577496661.0,"This is what we need. JK needs 25+ touches.Fields needs to get the read option going a little, and just grind them out."
PublicFreakout,fby8ldh,t1_fby6drr,1577210728.0, I'm not saying I agree with it. It's just that bird law in this country‚Äîit's not governed by reason
