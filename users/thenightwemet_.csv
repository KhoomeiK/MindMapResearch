AskReddit,feknel3,t1_fekn7gg,1579203669.0,It ain't extra to throw a seasoning or two and some hot sauce in your shitty every day noodles. You get sick of the same old shit after a while

That was a kid with potential. She didnt deserve to die. I wish I would die today. I wish I didnt make any of the mistakes I made in my life, I wish I didnt hurt anyone and I wish people didnt hurt me, I wish I was still good and something to be proud of but that's not her fault.

depression,fecupuk,t3_eo71t2,1578985369.0,"I feel this. So I bought a mini cat calendar and hung it near my bed. I write the dumbest shit on it that excites me. I write birthdays of family, friends, celebrities that I dont even care that much about, I write days when I have to go to the store, anniversaries of good days in my life, i remind myself to check the mail bc that's exciting for me, i write when my packages are coming, i write when my favorite artists are supposed to release songs or albums and I write when the next season's of my favorite shows are supposed to come out, I write ridiculousthings from the nationals calendar, like the 21st this month is national banana bread day and ima treat myself. So like when I wanna die i say ""You cant die, it's almost national banana bread day or it's almost Nana's birthday. It's honestly about the small stuff and living in the moment. I know that sounds corny but it's only corny bc everyone says it and obviously people only say it bc its sincerely true. You're always gonna be miserable if you sit and wait for something amazing to happen or wait for someone to tell you the meaning of life. Life will throw you the big good things when they throw it to you but for now, get excited about your cats birthday coming up or simply getting to check the mail"

depression,fectxaj,t3_eofgj0,1578984471.0,I feel you dude. I would have taken my life a thousand times if I could have but I cant stop seeing my little brothers face when they tell him I killed myself and I wonder if anyone would feed my cat enough or love him enough to always keep him safe and make sure he comes in every night and I can't stop seeing my big brother who has worked so hard for the great life he has completely shutting down when he gets the call. And I hear my little sister who wont even remember much of me bc shes so little asking my mom what I was like some day and I think of my grandparents who I've never really gotten to be around getting the call and them feeling lost and guilty and not being able to understand. And I swear not many people in this whole world would care if I died but I'd protect some people with all I have in me and imagining hurting them when I know there are so many other resources and things i haven't tried yet is horrible. Suicide to me would be a dream come true but I cant pretend that it's not selfish if I haven't tried every single fucking way in my power to help myself

AskReddit,fbd8el8,t3_ecr96t,1576752124.0,"It's sorta hard to say but I make sexual jokes here and there and then I'll say ""just kidding"" but its just to get him thinking about me like that for a second.

And surprisingly enough, using certain emojis can definitely do the trick. Just throw a wink in there and he's yours.

Also I like to bring up a story about like someone's weird kink and then I'll ask him about his kinks but make it seem super innocent, and  casual, and then later I'll slowly use that information against him haha.

For example: this man I was talking to a while ago had a daddy kink thing so I would like mention how I like to be babied and eventually I turned it up a notch and I would call him daddy every once in a while as a joke and just laugh it off and tell him i call all my friends that as a joke sometimes.

Basically teasing goes a long way!

Also I'm very bad at relationships and flirting and making men want me but none of these approaches have ever failed me."

Decide that you're not allowed on your phone until you do it. Buy a snack you want and tell yourself you cant have it till after you shower. Purposely get yourself so filthy that it would disgust you to lay back in your bed unless you showered. You gotta do something. You cant keep living like that. We both gotta get better
