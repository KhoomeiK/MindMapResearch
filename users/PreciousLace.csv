college,ff6dbz7,t3_eruvps,1579624722.0,"the Iliad is very short in comparison to the Odyssey, so unless english isn't your first language you should have no problem reading it in 3 days. I'm an English major and if I find a reading to be particularly dry, I'll listen to the audiobook and either watch a crash course on youtube or read the sparknotes."

povertyfinance,fe6sqa8,t3_enz8lx,1578903625.0,"Honestly, don't buy meat. It's sooo expensive and healthier for you too. Stock up on beans of all kinds (black, kidney, garbanzo, etc), rice & quinoa/couscous, whole grain tortillas and lots of fresh produce. Try to buy the rice and quinoa in bulk with reusable sacks to reduce waste."

hamsters,fdxhe91,t3_enb3rn,1578768747.0,This is horrible. Hamsters are way too small to properly regulate their body temperature and can easily get pneumonia and die. Never do this again.
college,fdxgrj4,t1_fdwqpwz,1578768538.0,"Okay so, I was/am sort of in the same boat as you. For as long as I can remember I've loved writing and wanted to be a writer and my mom was very supportive of that idea. But as I got older and entered uni people began to tell me that English degrees are useless and I need to find a major that will make me lots of money and ensure I get a job. So I thought about becoming a lawyer and took a sociology class with the intentions of being one. And I HATED it. I was not happy at all and did very poorly in that class.

So I guess what I'm trying to say is if you do what your parents want you to do, not only will you likely do poorly but you will be miserable. Like the other poster said, life is too short to hate what you do, you know?"

For clean up, I keep a thing of baby wipes on the bedside table, I take a few and put them between my legs and go immediately to the bathroom to pee. Then I just wipe it away with toilet paper."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdlz5bh,t3_elzt0q,1578535972.0,Vaginas are self cleaning so only water is needed. You can use an unscented body wash to clean your vulva.
college,fdftwq3,t3_el4808,1578370110.0,Some classes you can get away with skipping class but others you will fall weeks behind even missing one. That class is probably the latter.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdapmmr,t3_ekc0f0,1578248752.0,"I don't know if this is the best way but when I wanted to get a stubborn red out of my hair, I went to Sally's and bought a box of hair stripper and some toner. Then I washed my hair with hot hot water and dish soap to get rid of most of the dye, let it dry and applied the bleach.

This turned my hair a brassy blonde which I turned silver with toner. You could then use your pastel purple on top of that."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fckzpvs,t3_efgnge,1577736666.0,"Birth control is a blessing from the gods. 

Wash your face TWICE a day with a cleanser containing salicylic acid. Don't squeeze your pimples. Use pimple patches overnight for particularly big ones."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fckzh0c,t3_efrdha,1577736515.0,Snickerdoodles!! They're literally just soft sugar cookies dipped in a cinnamon sugar mixture then baked. Sooo yummy and look way more difficult than they actually are.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fckysgu,t3_efsam5,1577736095.0,"On a daily basis, I typically only wash my face with an oil-free facial cleanser and apply a moisturizer with salicylic acid. 

If I'm going out or doing something that requires me to wear makeup, I will use a liquid foundation and fill in my brows with a dark brown eyeshadow. Sometimes I'll do a simple eyeshadow with a few colors that match my outfit. Then I line my eyes with liquid eyeliner, curl my lashes and apply Better Than Sex mascara. After that I put a powder blush to the apples of my cheeks, swipe on some highlighter on my cheekbones and the tip of my nose. Moisturize my lips and put on a lipstick that matches my eyeshadow/outfit.

Finish by spritzing my face with a finishing spray.

It usually only takes me about 15 mins."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fckxcdc,t3_ehgsje,1577735211.0,Trimming it with scissors is a good idea as trying to shave long hairs can clog and dull the razors very quickly... I personally use the Schick Intuition razor with an Eos shaving cream.
