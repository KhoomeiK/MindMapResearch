PublicFreakout,ffdql3r,t1_ffcsnv0,1579826560.0,"I like hearing people speak in foreign languages. It's nice to hear human voices without the distraction of actually understanding a conversation. They could be talking about farts and ass for all I know.

I listen to a lot of foreign music for this reason as well. There's nothing that can copy the power of the human voice, and without knowing what is being said I can focus fully on the music and emotion being expressed. I also ""know"" the words to a lot of these songs, as in I can approximate the pronunciation well enough to satisfy a fellow English-only speaker. I bet I sound like an idiot to a native/fluent speaker."
facepalm,ffcr9y1,t1_ffcapll,1579805621.0,"You're just repeating bullet points from media.

Here's what doctors are saying:

* Like the flu, this virus is dangerous for the very young, very old, and immunocompromised.
* If you're a relatively healthy adult that wouldn't die from the flu, then stay home, keep hydrated, contact a doctor if symptoms worsen. It's the same advise they give for most Class B viruses. It's the same advise my doc gave me last week for bronchitis.

Fun fact: In an unhealthy adult, allergies can lead to upper respiratory infection and can worsen to pneumonia. But you're not freaking out over the pollen count like it's a potential death sentence, are ya?"

facepalm,ffcp9m1,t3_esp0f9,1579804300.0,"Everyone is freaking the fuck out over this.

Lemme ask you - how many of you didn't get your flu vaccine this year and are continuing life just fine not worried at all? Influenza kills on average, 30k-50k per season *in the United States alone.* Most of those are the very old, very young, and the immunocompromised.

This virus has repeatedly been reported to only be dangerous for those very same groups. Doctors are not at all concerned if you're a relatively healthy adult - their recommendation is the same for the cold and flu: stay home, keep hydrated, contact your doc if symptoms worsen. And they want you to do that so that you don't spread it to the risk groups.

""Oh but it has the potential to mutate!""

No shit, it's a fucking virus. Influenza mutates ALL THE FUCKING TIME. That's why they have to make a new vaccine every year - that's why some years the vaccine is less effective than other years.

The world is not gonna end, y'all people are only freaking out because one of the most populous countries on Earth (that also happens to be most people's boogeyman) churns out a new virus every couple years. Statistically, this is normal, perhaps even below normal for new-disease generation in a population that size and dense. 6ish people died? Yeah that's the average number of deaths from *THE* Plague in the United States and yet I don't see y'all screaming like ninnies over that. The Wuhan virus is Class B. If it were Class A like Plague or Ebola *then* you'd have cause to freak out. 

Calm y'alls fucking tits.

**Edit:** I have been informed by a coworker that  the death count is now up to 17. Still statistically tiny. If you're freaking out over this, then I want you to solemnly swear that ALL your vaccinations are up to date because otherwise y'all are nothing but a bunch of overreacting bimbos."

netflix,ff9ppf1,t1_ff9o0t4,1579718181.0,"Disney's most valuable animation IPs are in film, and they all fall under the Disney formula.

Netflix's animation IP however is so much more diverse. They have the distribution-rights content (mostly anime) but also their own exclusive content produced with Dreamworks, and the more adult-oriented shows like Bojack and Big Mouth. I think ultimately that gives Netflix the edge (in Animation) - people prefer to stream television, and the texture of Disney films gets pretty tiring. Disney musicals for example, are basically broadway-esque, and that can be exhausting. Sometimes you don't want a musical. And when you do, sometimes you don't want something loud and grand or necessary for the plot, you just want a sweet and simple song that can be sung anywhere and anytime. Or you want the music to be more modern and/or diegetic like in Spider-verse."

AskReddit,ff8ax6v,t1_ff70b33,1579671321.0,"So I was 15, looking for a summer job, going from place to place picking up and dropping off applications. On the strip by the local university was a building that said ""Scientology."" I had no idea what that was, but it sounded like it had the word ""Science,"" figured it was some kind of camp or learning center given it's proximity to the university, and that'd look pretty good on a resume.

I was in and it was pretty sparse, and there were two guys manning a table who just like, stared at me. Super weird. I can't recall exactly how the conversation went (I remember feeling it was kinda lame and awkward) but I left a few minutes later with an ""application."" When I got home and looked them up, I found out they were a cult. I found it hilarious that I pretty much presented myself as naive enough to apply, open to being dragged into membership and all the effort they was some half assed conversation. Hope those guys stuck around for a long time, giving off lame-o vibes to other naive teens.

I did end up working at the local nature center that summer, so still got my desired science job."

unpopularopinion,ff7v6j6,t1_ff6dxof,1579659123.0,"That's really demeaning, to just say people are mad about Christianity because their parents ""made them go to church."" 

That's you saying, they are incapable of reading the news, talking to people and forming opinions about homophobia in churches, about how Christina churches in America are more and more aligning with a political party most young people find distasteful. That's you saying kids can't form valid opinion about rampant pedophilia in the Catholic church. That's you saying kids can't form opinions about racism and authoritarian levels of control in the LDS church. That you saying kids can't read shared stories about abuse suffered at the hands of parents who used religion to subjugate and control, and decide for themselves that they don't like the organizations that gave those parents that level of self-justification to exert that power over their children. Organizations that at times, directly *helped* those parents exert that power and control over their children.

That's you saying ""those kids are stupid and don't have valid opinions until they turn 18."" If you have children, it's unfortunate that they got stuck with you."

unpopularopinion,ff7tzry,t3_erx2x0,1579658322.0,"**TL;DR Christianity-dunking is the gateway drug for someone in a Western country to eventually become a full on atheist. Stop trying to play victim, y'all ain't special.**

Most atheists are in Western countries, where Christianity (and all its sects, including Catholicism and Mormonism) is the more popular religion. Because of this, atheists in those countries do tend to have a basis of their dislike for religion based off *personal* experiences with Christianity, and that eventually leads to dislike of all religions. Atheists do plenty of bashing on other religions - I don't browse the subreddit myself, but enough of their posts pop up in my /popular feed that involve bashing what some Buddhist/Hindi/Islam representative did or said. 

Another issue is that, because most atheists are in Western societies, it is easier to find/obtain news coverage in English - there's not a lot of non-English news that gets translated, or English-based news organizations reporting on the going ons in bumfuck nowhere India like those reporting on the going ons in bumfuck nowhere Alabama. There is certainly as much, if not more messed up shit happening religion-wise in those parts of the world, a lot of it just gets artificially filtered out.


Edit: One more thing, no religions are as organized and controlled as the Catholic and LDS churches; both have very well known, visible, and heavily reported-on leaders. Again, it's all about English/translated news access, but there's a reason why atheists are able to easily name (and happily dunk) on Pope Francis and Russel Nelson, but naming/remembering the leader(s) of other religions is much harder."

College is one possibility, but then how does going to college solve his problems? I don't think Sugar would leave it *that* open ended."

movies,fefqx9g,t1_feefnuh,1579062634.0,"I would imagine that unless they're actively filming, all live props would at the very least sit up. They need to pay attention to the director and other crew to see if there are any changes/relocation to be done. Also, for safety reasons, you wouldn't want to be mistaken for a manufactured prop."

AskReddit,feca5ds,t1_feb6oqa,1578969406.0,"I'm not sure we as a K2 Civ would completely destroy our own planet, but I could see us destroying others outside of our own system. The gravitational impact of planets on each other and our star are not insignificant, so if we're not keen to have our planet destroyed, we can't just destroy our system resources. Historically, we have always as a species sought to deplete foreign resources before we resort to depleting our own.


Edit: Also, imo, the Kardashev scale isn't a good/complete scale. The difference between K1 and K2 is minuscule compared to the difference between K2 and K3. It's like saying there's three types of dinosaurs: hummingbirds, sparrows, and T-rex."

Give us what feels like eternity that lasts a second in real time, and god damn it make sure it has Pokemon."
