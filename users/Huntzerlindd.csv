hearthstone,ffabcfb,t3_esatb8,1579731565.0,Thank you so much! I’ve been monitoring this closely but I guess I thought I had one more day.
hearthstone,ffab1fl,t3_esbq1f,1579731391.0,Nice
hearthstone,ffa82la,t3_es7w1z,1579729705.0,"I just really wish they made it harder. Every boss just felt like the first few bosses of a dungeon run, where you’re just guaranteed to win and just making plays on closing out the game as fast as you can. Heroic mode was also incredibly easy. It’s very possible that it’ll get harder as time goes on, because those chapters aren’t free, and if so then I’ll be happy"
