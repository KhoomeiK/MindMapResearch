Slipknot,ff86iw1,t1_ff715ia,1579667381.0,"Man that's sick! I never got to see them starting 2000s, cuz i never heard about them back then. The fact that i grew up listening to beyonce, rihanna, and katy perry didn't help either :P

Missed almost everything from the band haha Luckily there are still vids lying around of them playing back then, doesn't make up for the live experience you would've had tho.
I'd like to see them live at least once since they know how to put on a show. 

U know if this will be their last year performing or do u think there could be one more time after this?"

Wish my mom would turn out like that, not a chance! Reason i brought them up in the first place was because, i found out today that they're coming to my country next week.

Desperately tried to get some tickets but it was (obviously) already sold out, sadly.

Have you seen them live before?"

relationship_advice,ff1igh4,t1_ff1fq0a,1579479731.0,"Yeah I've been putting it off for a reason tbh.
I'm sorry if this sounds creepy, but there was this one time during out friendship where she acted rlly insecure about her body. She brought up sending nudes and i talked myself into thhinking it'd be okay since i could help her self esteem out by complimenting her.

Anyway, after she was done sending it to me she decided that it'd be a great idea to brag about it in the group chat we both were in, i felt angry and used. Still feel like she manipulated me into accepting it just so she can talk about it with some friends.

Now I'm actually afraid the same thing will happen if i have sex w her, so late 2019 i distanced myself from her which maybe explains her behavior rn.

I'm sorry if this is tmi i just felt like getting it off my chest since I've been keeping it to myself for so long and I'd rlly like to get it off my chest."
relationship_advice,ff1dqnv,t1_ff1a9o3,1579477869.0,"Well the thing is that sometimes i tell her I'm not sure if i wanna do it, and she tells me it's ok and she doesn't wanna make me uncomfortable. And whenever we meet in person and i say the exact same thing it's like she gets impatient. It's just weird how she contradicts herself and I'm not sure what to make of the whole thing."

relationship_advice,ff18efz,t1_ff156c2,1579476258.0,"Thx for clarifying it.

relationship_advice,ff0ykfz,t1_ff0fgi6,1579473537.0,"Yeah you're right. It felt kinda off how she was checking my phone if she was mocing away the time before that.

Also, about the passive-aggressive comments when she brings up wanting to have sex. Wording was kinda off, idk if it's the same thing but she also sounded kinda impatient. Is that normal or is it still as passive aggressive?"
