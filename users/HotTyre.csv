AdviceAnimals,fdx378a,t1_fdwxo9z,1578764818.0,"Yes, it's psychological. When you don't have cues about the other person getting the message, something you have a lot of in face-to-face conversation (something kids these days don't have enough of), then you tend to naturally raise your voice to get ""heard"".

My little jab at ""kids"" is tongue-in-cheek. It's disappointing to see peopl eimmediately referring to age groups or generations for a fact this trivial and widely shared amongst several groups. Fucking kids these days."
oddlysatisfying,fdwodgf,t1_fdv7qlq,1578760818.0,"Confirmed, my rental apartment has a kitchen like this and that area is just empty space anyway. They did put rotating drawers in mine, they're half-circles that rotate then slide from the final drawer before the corner. They don't optimise the space as much as this design, but at least that gives a large space to put larger items if need be. The small water heater for the kitchen sink takes the rest of the space."

I'm looking for the technology and medicine that would allow me to live the current 80-ish life expectancy, but with an OK functioning body and mind. Not necessarily the one I had back when I was 20 (otherwise it would be sad to go…), but anything that isn't a sad, pitiful, cognition-less sack of bones."

theocho,fdqxx9v,t1_fdql06q,1578676438.0,"I don't get it. If I put 10 dollars, and you say ""I see your 10 dollars and I raise to 20"", you're just effectively betting 20 in one move. It's the same as straight out saying ""bet 20"". The link you provided talks about actual string bets, which are other tactics like putting chips slowly, or starting an ambigous/misleading sentence then changing it mid-sentence."
askscience,fdqrxw4,t1_fdpcytl,1578673589.0,"That's what irks me a little bit about some improvements that are proposed by laymen in any field, they never factor in the cost vs benefit trade-off, which sometimes keeps ""old-school"" robust solutions in place instead of the latest innovations. People got used to seeing the latest technologies thrown at them when it comes to telecom and home entertainment, but industries can't all be like that.

It's a legitimate question that of OP though, and good ideas can come from an outside perspective, it's just sometimes decorrelated from reality but I guess ths is why we have this sirt of sub and threads :-)"

IdiotsInCars,fdgzptq,t1_fdfkm9e,1578412203.0,"Don't you guys have third party insurance for damages like this? In my country your home insurance also covers accidental damage you may cause to someone while walking, cycling, etc... This would definitely fall under that sort of thing. Obviously like with any insurance, you have a minimum paiment to make but nothing like 10 grand.

It's mandatory to have as well, so nobody is expected to pay for full damages out of pocket, unless there is deliberate damage or if you're tried in civil court and found guilty of negligence. But base case is if you mess up and hurt someone or something, you call your home insurance provider and file a claim."
