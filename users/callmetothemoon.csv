Give your kitty extra kisses please! 💜"
AmItheAsshole,fesksfq,t3_eq6l5a,1579366255.0,"NTA. I’ve spent the last ten minutes reading through your posts and comments and holy hell, man, RUN.

I’m female, and I have insecurities too. Sometimes I even get jealous, but that’s never any reason to physically abuse (you mentioned her slapping you) or emotionally abuse (men don’t need compliments?! wtf. Manipulative af everywhere else) a partner.

You need to get out and go far away from this chick and her numerous issues. She’s toxic, and she’s holding you hostage because of her own shitty self-worth."

WitchesVsPatriarchy,fddoq7x,t3_ekkaoo,1578319787.0,"I was cleaning out my childhood bedroom a couple weeks ago and rediscovered an ornate little chest that said “Dreams” on the side, meant to keep little trinkets and snap-on earrings I think. What did I put in there as a kid? Exoskeletons of cicadas and water nymphs, and one half of a pair of eyelashes from a doll I swore I would get my dad to glue on again someday.

Maybe I’ve always meant to be a green witch..."

FemdomCommunity,fd6iufy,t3_ek27qb,1578191701.0,"I always like having a casual conversation as they sit naked in front of me, randomly grabbing at their waiting cock as I please.

My favorite though would have to be running my index fingernail along the underside of their cock, base to top. Your Domme can try it at varying speeds and see which she most prefers. It adds a bit of variety to an average handjob."

There’s also this thing going around where guys aren’t allowed to stay in NSFW servers unless they get a certain amount of girls to join. V annoying."
bisexualadults,fcj4e5h,t3_eh1mwn,1577676991.0,"Shot in the dark here - but maybe it’s less about gender and more about trust... Maybe you feel like you’ve forgiven him for his dishonesty but deep down your sexual brain can’t get over it and sets up a mental block. This girl you were with was a clean slate, no dishonesty there, so no mental block. It’s a protective mechanism."
