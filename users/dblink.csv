How about this focus on your own politics and country, and let us run ours. That seems a hard task for people that complain about every single action the US takes, even if it doesn't effect them. 

The fact that your true intent was thinly veiled doesn't relieve you of the guilt of having made that association. You think you're so clever trying to finagle words around to show the true meaning while leaving yourself an out when you're called out on it. You're a disingenuous person, or have been lied to and brainwashed. Either way, it's sad. 

As to some of your rambling, walls do work. Hungary installed a wall and it helped stem the flow of undocumented refugees straining their systems. Mexico is building a wall on their southern border. Walls have been used to protect cities and countries for thousands of years, suddenly it won't work because it's America doing it? If you build a wall that people can't dig under or scale without 100 times the effort of just walking across the border, it will cut down on the people that can cross. How is that not effective? 

Final thought to you: It's not racist to say we don't want people in the country illegally. We are unable to take as many legal immigrants because of the amount of undocumented ones. Stop that tide, and the amount of legal immigration where people are vetted and get social support once here can rise. 

I hope you become a better person without as much thinly veiled contempt in the future.

Edit: I should have looked at your profile earlier. ""As someone from the UK"" Like... this is laughable. You bash our media when UK media is known for being biased and sensationalist. You elected Boris Johnson, and voted through Brexit to stop the brown people from coming to Britain. See, you are nothing but a pathetic keyboard warrior who will say anything to push their viewpoint. 

In conclusion, go fuck yourself mate."

For your last point though, the embassy attack was another escalating step in the US-Iran hostilities. There has been a lot of posturing, talk, shadowy operations by both sides that they have been able to explain just enough to avoid open retaliation. Attacking an embassy is the same as attacking the US itself, and Iran has shown what they would do if they weren't rebuffed by security forces. 

Beyond just this one example, if countries don't enforce the safety and sanctity of embassies, then more countries would remove embassies from dangerous countries. This would hurt diplomatic relationships and most likely cause each side to dig in more."
