worldnews,ff63h76,t1_ff5ylch,1579618194.0,"I don't think they were trying to excuse us, just saying that it's true in both cases.

Also, remember that there are always two sides to each story. I'm not trying to excuse any of the people responsible for acts like this, they're obviously wrong, but just remember that those people weren't evil, they thought what they were doing is right, they really didn't know what they were doing was wrong, many of them thought what they were doing was for the benefit of the people they were oppressing. If hypothetically we later found out in the future that dogs were completely sentient and being let's was equivalent to torture, we'd be seen as monsters and future humans would wonder how we could even think holding animals that try to run away often to be fine.

Obviously I don't believe this hypothetical is anywhere near realistic, but I'm trying to demonstrate how it could equally happen to us, if you or I were born as British colonists, we would have done things just as horrendous, because we wouldn't know what we're doing is wrong.

The same logic even applies to Hitler. Of course what he did was HORRIBLE, I cannot stress that enough, but if you think his motive was just being evil, you're dead wrong. He genuinely believed that was he was doing was for the betterment of humanity, even if its obvious to you and I that his methods were horrible."

Showerthoughts,fev4pg8,t1_fer3kqg,1579393044.0,"ahh yes, how dare people be annoyed that one group of idiots is inconveniencing everyone else by forcing us to convert for them and have to convert everything that comes out of them, instead of it being automatically understandable like it is for everyone else, just for some stupid sense of 'national pride', as if using an incredibly outdated system is something to be proud of, and then acting superior, it's the very incarnation of karen like behaviour, acting superior while being a nuisance to everyone else.

Also yes fine technically the US is not the only country that uses the imperial system, theres also liberia and myanmar, two countries small enough that i bet I could go out on the streets of america and ask epople to place where they are without google, and none of them would ge tit right, at least not the kind you are because:

You are so incredibly caught up in how superior u delusionally believe America to be, that you missed the fact that there are SIGNIFICANTLY more native mandarin speakers than there are native english speakers. Yes overrall there are more people that can speak English, but that's only because all the other countries are forced to take care of you like little babies because instead of learning the language of places you go/people you interact with, you insist on everyone else catering to you, like a bunch of babies demanding attention from their parents. So yeah why don't we all convert over to speaking mandarin? I mean I think it'd be fine, but I'd guess you'd throw a tantrum over it because you couldn't handle the idea of not being the superior country? I mean shit I didn't even intend to make that one analogous to a toddler, it just happened to line up that way, really demonstrates how toddler like the behaviour of people like you is.

Also, I think it's hilarious you're still acting like it's just Europeans that are using metric, because literally EVERY SINGLE country in the world, including Asia, and Africa, and South America, and Canada, and Oceania also use metric, minus the again small countries of Myanmar and Liberia. It's extra ironic I'm not even European, I'm from Oceania, you ignorant seppo crybaby.

Also who the fuck even calls Europeans ""Euros"", did you just make that up yourself? It sounds incredibly stupid, you realize that Euros is the name of the currency, not the people, right? Or are you ""Dollars"" that fucking stupid?"

teenagers,fenlopa,t1_fen20re,1579287355.0,"yep, to make this a proper double blind study we'd have to:

Pour water into two cups.

Put sugar into one of the cups and dissolve it.

Have someone else shuffle them around and label them A and B, and keep track of which one has sugar, they should be the only one to know

Now we have a guy dip their balls in A, and then B, and say which one had sugar.

Repeat this process with many different guys, and in the end record how likely they were to guess correctly. If the result is statistically significant (the percent of correct guesses would depend on the amount of guys in the study, but obviously above 50), then your theory has been affirmed, and if it's not significantly significant, *then* it's disproven.

At least, that's how I'd do it"

AskReddit,fek40qp,t3_epj100,1579192140.0,"Outer Wilds. No, not the obsidian RPG, Outer wilds the an insanely good game from Mobius Digital. It's really hard to explain what makes it so good/why you should play it without accidentally spoiling it and ruining the fun of playing the game for yourself. If at any point in this you feel like playing the game, please for the love of god stop reading and just play the game, the less you know about it the more fun it will be!

What makes it so hard to talk about without spoiling it is that you don't progress in the normal sense, the only progress you get is learning more about the in-game universe and it's mechanics, solving the many smaller puzzles which all come together into bigger puzzles as you slowly try to unravel the mysteries of the universe. It also has a really cool exploration aspect, there are a few different hand-crafted planets to explore, each of which are incredibly diverse in their landscape and appearance, and in their mechanics, and you can go anywhere you want right from the start! Do you want to go to Brittle hollow, the crumbling planet with a volcano moon, or maybe Giants Deep, a gigantic ocean planet covered in tornados, how about the hourglass twins, one starts as a pure sand desert while the other is a large rock with a maze of caves in it, but as time goes by, the desert planets slowly loses sand to the rock planet, allowing you to explore the desert planet, but blocking your access to the rock planet, and how about dark bramble, a mysterious planet which the characters warn you about pretty much from the start, but may hold the secrets you need to continue on your journey, you can even go explore the moon! And shit I'm not even getting into the Quantum moon because that's a whole wild ride of spoilers but also an incredibly cool mystery in and of itself!.

But if it helps to further the point that you should play it, pretty much every game design/review channel on youtube (Errant Signal, GMTK, Adam Millard, First Five & Chris Davis to name a few) gives it EXTREMELY high praise, and yet I've so far not met someone who's actually played it.

For the love of god PLEASE play this game, it's insanely good and had me thinking about it and only it for like three straight days because I binged the hell out of it, it's easily my game of the year 2019, but it was sadly overshadowed by big budget AAA releases and just other more well known games.

EDIT: Okay and to be fair I do know that all these game design channels giving it high praise technically means it's not underrated, but since I've yet to run into someone that knows of the game, I'd say it's unknown enough to be included regardless"
teenagers,fek1zhb,t1_fek1j4n,1579190899.0,"""According to the HuffPost, children attend school between 8 and 9 a.m. each day and finish around 1 to 2 p.m. For every 45 minutes of learning, the children get a 15-minute break. This equates to an average of three hours and 45 minutes of educational instruction each day.""

two things to note though:
1. I think this was based on primary school, and from what I've read in Finland middle school has more hours than primary school, and High school more hours than that, still less than the US though

Do you believe that morally it is unacceptable to do anything that could hark someone even if they want you to and are thinking rationally and with a full understanding? If so are you also against euthenasia?

I mean if so that's fine and that's your own philosophy which you can have. However if that is your philosophy, then how do you feel about drawings of sexual acts with children, or even hypothetically photorealistic but not real depictions of sex with children? What about deepfakes of children or sex dolls modelled after children? To be clear I'm not trying to argue with you I just want to understand how you think about these situations and what your moral system is, I'm quite curious about it since it clearly differs from mine

Edit: also forgot to ask, how do you the feel about a 30 year old having sex with a 30 year old in the body of a teenager that is still under 18, but post-pubescent, say 15-17 maybe even 14 if they completed puberty that quickly.

teenagers,fdi8atb,t1_fdi6496,1578437527.0,"It's honestly so dumb, the entire reason child sex is illegal is because they are too young to properly consent. Child porn is illegal because it usually causes trauma to the child involved and they can't consent to the porn being made. But drawings have no such risk. This is also why I defend the classic anime ""well she's technically a vampire that's 400 years old"" thing, because that SHOULD make it okay, the issue is not their body, it is their brain. I think if theoretically u had a 25 year old in a 9 year old body and a 9 year old in a 25 year old body, it'dbe okay to do it with the 25 y/o in 9 y/o body but NOT the 9 y/o in 25 y/o body. I mean to be clear I wouldn't want to because I'm not attracted to pre-pubescent children, but if someone was attracted to that there's no reason they shouldn't be able to in this hypothetical

Obviously in real life that doesn't really happen, but the point is we need to remember the actual issue with child sex, it's not bad because we don't relate to a pedophiles attraction, it's because even if we did find the kid attractive, they do not have the proper understanding or intelligence to consent to sexual acts."

facepalm,fbyeyut,t1_fbydp7r,1577215215.0,"I have literally only stated facts here, everything I've said has been well verified, so unless you're implying there's a massive rich person conspiracy where they change the details of the case, I'm not sure what you're getting at.  


And if that is what you're trying to say, why would this rich person conspiracy even let the news of this homeless person going to jail get out? Or why wouldn't they fabricate the length of time this guy went to jail? Why would they let the guy responsible for 97% of the 3 billion dollars get 30 years in prison?

Sorry, I don't deal with people who believe in baseless conspiracy theories, so unless you can give me some proof, I'm not gonna respond to you any more"
facepalm,fbxse6p,t1_fbxq8yj,1577199221.0,"that's kind of the thing with reddit, nobody reads articles, which makes it very easy to tell half-truths and have everyone believe it. still don't worry about it, listening when someone corrects you is much more important than being right in the first place, I can't even say myself that I always listen when people correct me"

facepalm,fbxmrdx,t1_fbx9exi,1577194191.0," there's a massive difference between  joining an ongoing scheme, assisting in the arrest of the main guy  responsible for  97% of it (no that's not an exaggeration, I did the  math), as well as being only one of 6 people responsible for the  remaining 3% and it was  completely non-violent, vs making a woman fear  for her life by threatening to shoot her with a gun as part of violently  robbing a bank

Oh and also, the  main guy responsible for 2.9 Billion of the 3 Billion dollars \*did\* get  30 years  so the sentence for that was double the homeless guys sentence  anyways,  even though the large scheme was completely non-violent and  the homeless  guy **threatened to kill a woman with a gun**
