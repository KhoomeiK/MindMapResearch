politics,fe4hdxf,t3_ennzq1,1578859321.0,"As an early-childhood education teacher, this article resonates with me tremendously.  


I work at a high-quality ECE center alongside a team of talented, motivated individuals who are passionate about providing the highest level of education possible for small children - [and research by a Nobel Prize-winning economist has found](https://heckmanequation.org/resource/the-heckman-curve/) that providing quality education and support to this age group yields a higher societal return on investment than any other investment in education.   


The majority of my co-workers (myself included) are college graduates; some have or are working on their master's degrees or higher. They show up each and every day, not merely to change diapers and pour juice, as the tired stereotype goes: We plan and implement curriculum through circles and small-group activities that are designed to help children develop key core social, emotional, physical, and academic skills during this sensitive period of their development; we perform periodic in-depth, individualized assessments of each student's growth every six months, we write daily and weekly missives to families updating them on their children and the classroom as a whole; we hold team planning meetings; we consult with parents about issues with their children, providing our own expertise in addressing all types of concerns; and we also manage the classroom, ensuring we're stocked with necessary food supplies and other resources. Despite the high cost parents pay to send children to our program, we're paid a ridiculously low wage; some of my peers with children rely on government aid to pay their bills.  


I expect some people will dismiss the above as whining, and that if I and my ECE peers just worked harder, we could find more lucrative jobs elsewhere. (Truth be told, many do use ECE as a stepping stone to a different career working with children.) But I think that's a short-sighted attitude: Just like with any other school, it's ideal to have at least of core group of veteran teachers in an ECE program know how to work effectively with their respective age groups and their families. This job isn't easy, especially if it's being done well, and the goal should be to promote retention of high-quality ECE teachers, which includes providing them with financial security.   


I don't have a solution. I think the idea of universal ECE, which politicians have increasingly pitched in recent years, could address the issue. So, too, could providing more resources to ECE programs that demonstrate they're operating at a high standard."

ECEProfessionals,fd7gxgf,t3_ek7pgw,1578204332.0,"I took a near-identical path to ECE and have faced similar levels of patronizing, belittling, and outright rude comments from people with obvious superiority complexes and/or a very narrow understanding of what teaching ECE entails.  


I think my least-favorite criticism is along the lines of, ""It's glorified babysitting."" Well, I spend as many as eight hours per day with some of these kids, more waking hours than they spend with their parents. Are parents glorified babysitters? No. I'm not just in charge of a more than dozen small children's health and well being on a daily basis; I am finding ways to inspire them, ignite their curiosity, foster in them resilience, and through circle time and planned activities, I teach them the necessary foundational skills - emotional, social, physical, and academic - to flourish in pre-school and beyond. My co-teachers and I track each child's development, collecting evidence to complete intensive assessments for each child every six months. I talk with worried parents, providing guidance on how to address mistaken behavior and other concerns; I also negotiate with parents, walking the line sometimes between being respectful of the parents' culture and preferences and the needs of the child.  


I applaud you for choosing this path, and I empathize with having to deal people being demeaning or belittling of what you do. I deeply hope that the importance of ECE will become a prevalent political talking point; I know that both Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren advocate universal ECE."
