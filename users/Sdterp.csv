I mean we weren't crazy holy rollers like some of my relatives on my paternal side. 

Then came our lesson in transubstantiation. We were taught that the blessing (magical incantation) LITERALLY changes the host and wine into body and blood. I clarified, ""Symbolically, right?"" My CCD teacher, Mrs Armstrong (mom of a high school friend who I shared this story with at our 30th reunion and he said she'd be devastated if he shared that with her) said, no, it literally changes to Christ's body and blood. I again challenged and said that it still tastes like (stale, tasteless) bread and (cheap) wine. Mrs Armstrong replied, ""Well, that's the miracle!""

I've been an atheist since."

But she is in a perfect place for confirmation bias. They do get a lot of pitties, but some are there because a family was forced to move and couldn't find a place that would allow pitbulls. They weren't allowed because of breed prejudice. She also discounts all of the other dogs they put down. 

I've known dozens of pitbulls that were all gentle, loving, softies that loved playing with other dogs and cats and bunnies and all sorts of animals (human and otherwise). If you only read the the headlines to know pitbulls, you'll only see them one way. All dogs have a potential to bite or attack. I'm not down voting you, but you're wrong, dead wrong.

I guess I'm a bad owner, per your definition. Three pitties now passed on one 2-year old still with us, zero incidents despite having multiple cats, at one time mice and rats, a friend's bunnies that lived with us for almost 2 months."
