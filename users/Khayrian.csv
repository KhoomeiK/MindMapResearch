It isn't super extensive but I am able to see my monthly expenses, divided by person per week, track the contributions we've both made towards those, list my personal expenses and how much per week needs to go towards those before due date.

Everything left over goes towards flex/groceries/gas in the car. I'm literally calculating what needs to be set aside, and what dollar amount I can put into my free spending account. 

I copy the prior month and paste into the new month. Only a few amounts change month to month (utilities). Also added a tab for vacation savings as well as a check register/bank balance for the joint account."

I had a lot of members of my church turn their back on me and literally had a deacon call me to say that my non attendance meant I was kicked out of the church. I was crushed. I was a member all by myself seeking love and guidance that I wasn't getting at home and ""God is love"" was a back burner phrase to condemnation. Being handed a book that was making me feel like my innermost thoughts were evil was just too much. Oh, and they thought debit cards were the mark of the beast. This was the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches. My aunt who is still in the church thought Trump would herald in a new era of Godly love. I'm sorry, I just can't.

personalfinance,fekxctl,t1_feklbjl,1579209554.0,"TL:DR: College is for grown ups and you're an adult so you have adult consequences for adult decisions.  

Right, this is an admissions issue. How did friend drop classes without going through admissions? Wouldn't anyone in admissions who is processing the dropped classes have mentioned this?

Granted, when I was in college 2000 - 2004 we still did things in person on paper. Wouldn't an online admissions account still have this information?

Sometimes you learn a hard lesson.  I decided during my first semester that being in the orchestra was too much and stopped going. It wasn't a class that I had enrolled myself in. When I received an F in band my investigations let me know that a verbal conversation before I even started school enabled the director to enroll me himself. I had to appeal to the dean of the music department to waive the F.

Unfortunately (knowing from a somewhat similar experience) ""not knowing about the refund policy"" lies under the fact that this is college, your friend is an adult, and it was her responsibility to be informed on such important matters as dropping all of her classes and thinking she'd get a massive amount of money back. 

For me it was an issue of not knowing the class was on my roster and needed to be dropped. Not assuming I could drop without telling anyone and no one not telling me about the refund rate schedule. But in both situations, the lesson of ""being a grown up and making big decisions"" applies. 

ETA now that I think back on it, I was probably charged and paid full price for the course despite me not ever agreeing to be in it."

**TL:DR Great plan and service. I want to do something similar down the road.** 

I understand exactly what you're trying to do and I would like to do something similar. Parking cars, event planning, auto salvage dealership, commercial property management, and construction contracting.

Skills are industrial recycling, warehouse design, process flow, physical logistics, process design and training, legal compliance, property management, construction, operations management. 

Basically no matter the industry, I can understand how things should be designed, setup, run, improve and be taught. I apply the same principles in theory to many different types of businesses.

I would love to market myself to entrepreneurs and small businesses to help them grow. I'm not actually selling myself here as I don't want to consult right now, but I agree with your concept and see how a person like you can be valuable.

The more time you spend away from the danger, rage, and toxicity you'll realize that your new normal is a safe, calm, happy, and healthy space. I am proud of the person you are and 5he parent that you are.

Now that we are all glad that he is getting help and treatment, let's not forget his refusal to do this on any point in your marriage until you were thinking about leaving. He wouldn't be the first abusive spouse to conveniently attempt suicide when they get caught, or might be blamed for being abusive. I'm not accusing him of faking anything, but a lot of people do. Being ""sick"" is easier than facing consequences, accepting failure, or feeling guilty. 

Being sick and getting treatment is not a free pass nor does it absolve him for the damage that has been done day by day, year by year. 

Mental illness may cause abuse, but that doesn't justify it. Abuse is more than just hitting someone. Check out loveisrespect dot org. It helped me a lot when getting out of a toxic relationship.

A new life means setting and holding to boundaries, like you did when your child was hit. Keep that up. And when they are crossed, enforce consequences.

We sell commercial concrete and run an industrial park renting warehouse space to small businesses. 

Now we're selling swimming pools and he just started a floor coating company with my mom. My dad wants my sister and I to not necessarily take over his business (which we may or may not) but to have businesses of our own. My sister wants to do gym/tan/laundry somewhere and have a food truck. 

I want to buy my own building and rent cubicle space for artists, start a custom welding business with my fiancé because he's a master welder, as well as getting certified in project management so I can get a job for a larger construction company running projects.
