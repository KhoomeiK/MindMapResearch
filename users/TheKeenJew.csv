NativeAmerican,feuamxb,t1_feo8t5q,1579384759.0,"I'm personally not interested in ""converting"". Salesmen are everywhere, however. Especially in the Eastern mystics field. Reminds me of an experience where a woman came to our Buddhist temple, and made it all about her and tried to get the ""Buddhist Bible"" for her to study, regardless of the fact the person leading the seminar tried telling her - it's simply a lifestyle and inner beliefs fostered through Being. Later, I found out she runs a blog which sells worksheets. 

But - I see what you mean, somewhat. That Native spirituality is a personal experience, in my native religion of Judaism, the experience of God is from the self. Connecting with oneself, and ""Being"" - while also acting with humility. There's some parallels, and as of recently, a growing Jewish Shamanism sect."

college,fdw0cpm,t3_emrlt6,1578753636.0,"College is probably one of the biggest risks you’ll ever make in your life, at least until you’re 40 when you realize what you want to do vs financially feel obligated to do are two vastly different things and you’ll die one day. Thus you’re introduced to the midlife crisis.

The “average” student loan debt is 30k but I don’t think that’s accurate as the average tuition is over 17k (after aid) PER semester, so that’s over 34k a year. Lots of fellas I went to highschool with and have worked with are in about 80k to 120k worth of student loan debt, and they can barely live their lives because the 5% interest rate on it. I think it’s about $1,000 per mo. Which takes up a sizable amount of their check. 

I remember some big entrepreneur fella said, “Unless you got a good entrepreneurial mind, don’t got to college.” But id even argue some of the “lesser” (can’t find the proper word for it) is better than college. Like becoming a Barber, going into dental hygiene as an assistant. 

Because remember, just because you have a college degree doesn’t mean you’ll get a job. I was able to make about 20k because of my advertising skill, and I recently landed a job as a marketer for a e-commerce shoe platform (I can’t say the name but you know it.) because I had functional skill, and versus a college degree fella, he just has a fancy piece of paper.

My other friend did copywriting for himself and became kind of successful at it. At about 5k a month. He got tired of getting leads and everything so now he writes copy for a company, which generally asks for a degree in writing, marketing and 3 years of experience"

Simply starting out and saying Hello or thinking nice things about someone, genuinely is a good start and then practice saying them as you pass by.

The pit fall is that people think that people don’t want to talk to them. That they’d be rejected or viewed as creepy. But in reality the opposite is true. That it’s weird NOT to want social interaction, because we’re social creatures.

Plus why does it even matter what people you’ll never see again think?"

The age of worthless wars for the elite needs to come to an end. The young, we don’t want to die for this pointless war, risking not only our lives, but the lives of potentially millions of PERSIAN citizens. Which include the elderly, & children. They are our elders in culture & history, and should be respected as such. 

But the tyrant in office threatens that beautiful, eons old culture. The price of those rockets he fired? $1.5 million dollars.

You want to go to The Middle East and tell them you want to kill them? Go ahead, see what happens. They have their entire lives, and families to defend, while you march upon their doorsteps as our elites spends trillions of OUR TAX DOLLARS whilst thousands of Veterans who no longer are any benefit to this bloody war machine sit in the cold of our “Great” metropolitan, and while our Forests burn to the churning wheels of industry.

It’s definitely an unpopular opinion, I completely see you eye to eye on everything you’ve said. In rural Kentucky for example it’d be difficult not having a car.

For me however, it’s a financial burden, where I’m from I can basically take the train or bus to anywhere I’d go, have USPS pick up my packages, and use Amazon Fresh to deliver groceries or numerous other grocery delivery apps.

I guess when I grow my business out a little more I’d save up for a safer car like a Subaru and still primarily use it to drive across towns."

socialskills,fcsqioe,t1_fcsp11d,1577922557.0,"Please do not straw man my argument by grossly over simplifying what I’ve said. I did not state anywhere, “if we cut our budget by 5% the world would suddenly devolve into warfare.”

Just “100 billion” is a massive cut in the military budget. You make bold statements, but haven’t offered a conclusion in what you’d do with the spending, other than maintain “world peace” which you passively put in quotations.

America placed itself responsible for Asia, Europe, Africa, The Middle East, because economic stability effects regional stability. If Saudi Arabia collapsed, for example. What would take its place, ignoring the eventual civil wars that would erupt in the region? Which has advanced weaponry. Not only that, but it would economically effect The World & cause the effect of instability in other countries.

Completely disregarding the fact we control all global trade routes.

Other countries, such as China & Russia are actively growing their military & along with it, their spending. Russia invested 150 percent more into their military in 2018, for example.

[why we need a military ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/believe-were-spending-too-much-on-defense-think-again/2019/01/27/4cad190c-20c1-11e9-8b59-0a28f2191131_story.html%3FoutputType%3Damp) 

Feel free to tell me what you’d do with the reduced military spending. I’m not explaining this anymore."
socialskills,fcr0oug,t1_fcm1d0d,1577895042.0,"The issue with our military - is that it’s not there to kill people (I’m aware, very aware of the wars our boys have been involved in the Middle East & Vietnam), however most of our money is involved in maintaining Naval fleets & airship carriers, and the planes themselves.

The reason behind this is: America controls all important trade routes in the world, through the Ocean. And also - the fact that Israel is smack in the middle of the hornets nest of people wanting to kill them, and countries like Russia salivating at the chance to reunite the Soviet bloc countries, and pour into Western Europe. 

The philosophy is “The threat of violence can deter violence”. 2 Great Wars in one century, killed hundreds of millions of men. Americas military is very useful to deter war in Europe, or China taking even more of Asia. 

It’s much less devastating to economies if countries can stay where they are, and War takes a toll on population. A healthy population is necessary to run an economy.

So let’s say we save the billions from our military? Next thing we know, we’d need to spend a couple trillion $$$ & millions of lives potentially on going overseas to a war that could potentially now involve Nuclear Weaponry.

My last point is: It was war that destroyed the British Empire in the end. Britain was in so much debt and in tatters after the effects of World War 1, its empire began to crumble. Especially with the looming loss of India with the influence of Ghandhi. that World War 2 finally struck the island empire into profound debt, which destroyed the English pound.

Roosevelt utilized Britain’s need for tanks & America support to weaken the British pound, and explode the worth of the U.S. dollar, leading to the new American golden age."

I agree, it’s pretty BS how wealthy America is (NYC has a higher GDP than Canada and Germany for example) yet we have such an issue with poverty. Would you recommend we cease sending financial aid (well over 30 billion dollars) to countries such as:

Israel (3.1b), Egypt ($1.2b), Kenya (1.1b), Iraq (5.3b), Nigeria (718m), Ghana (732m), Zimbabwe (261m), Haiti (377m)"
socialskills,fck9usw,t1_fcivngw,1577720440.0,"If an incentive wasn’t involved to making the stove in the first place, there wouldn’t be a stove. Just as a Tesla. A lot of entrepreneurs were born into this world with it against them. If I create a business generating millions a year, I then generate jobs generating a safety net for thousands. 

However without the financial incentive, there’s little reason to push. Why make these amazing, world changing products if you won’t be rewarded for it? Elon works nearly 80 hours a week, sleeps at his desk, etc. While his workers do the normal full time shifts, get paid, and go home. They don’t need to worry about the company going under, shareholders getting upset, or one of the employees getting hurt and the possibility of getting sued.

Workers are people, and workers have just as much ability to stop being the “working class” and be upper class. Capitalism enables this. I was poor, in debt, autistic, and traumatized severely. But I changed my life around with a simple business idea, I can employee 4 guys out of college who probably wouldn’t have a job otherwise, and guarantee them rent money, food on their table, and insurance when they turn 26 and no longer can be on their parents’
