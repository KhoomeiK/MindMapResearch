I needed to hear that"
AskReddit,ff60d4l,t3_ero8mj,1579615863.0,"My 13 year old self wouldnt understand why I wanted to work with homeless drug addicts just yet so they would probably be confused about that.

She wouldnt have found out she may struggle to get pregnant yet so the fact that I'm a step-parent and not a parent-parent may also be confusing.

I know she would be relieved that I do learn to love my body - even if it takes another 15-16 years from that point. 

She would be impressed that I have a number of tattoos and that my boyfriend is covered in them."

Calgary,febng1y,t1_febli0o,1578960665.0,"Definitely good thing. 
The 200k that was redirected from the speed limit project and the 42k from Tom Jackson's Huron Carole helped a lot, but the team is still scrambling.

Lost funding will mean decreased services and a loss of some of the outreach pilot projects Alpha has started in 2019.

Like I said - utilize this service people. The benefits are beyond merely getting homeless people out of the cold. The doap team saves time and resources from emergency services."
Calgary,feb6lg2,t1_feaiieu,1578955866.0,"Also very true - the huge budget cut isnt due to take effect until the next fiscal year. Alpha/DOAP are doing their best to fund raise the budget they lost so that they can continue to have multiple teams on the road 24/7.

Use them. Show the city that they are beneficial."

AskWomen,fe0a3ar,t3_encl38,1578807394.0,"When I was single I did a lot of puzzles, coloring, reading, journaling.

My job requires me to be outgoing. As an introvert it is exhausting so my hobbies are mostly solo activities. 

Nintendo switch is great. Rug hooking and diamond dotz are guilty pleasures."
