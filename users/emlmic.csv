Weddingsunder10k,fecf0vr,t1_fecet6p,1578972358.0,Yay! I got some more too!
Weddingsunder10k,fecf02v,t1_fe6aafn,1578972342.0,It was probably an hour all together but spaced out over a day and a half to allow for drying time!
Weddingsunder10k,fecexr0,t1_fe8yj2s,1578972298.0,I got some peony packs yesterday too!!
Weddingsunder10k,febmkdj,t1_fe8yygo,1578960440.0,Thank you! Fianc√© was not about the pink when I picked it out but now he‚Äôs a fan!
Weddingsunder10k,febmiax,t1_fe8mg70,1578960416.0,My coworker has used them for bridesmaids dresses and she highly recommends them. They also do try at home for bridesmaid dresses I think $10 a dress?
Weddingsunder10k,febmfe9,t1_fe8eqsu,1578960384.0,Thank you!
Weddingsunder10k,febmeqh,t1_fe8a2zr,1578960375.0,That‚Äôs what I did! I just got two smaller batches to test first. I ordered bigger ones after I did these. I‚Äôm excited!
Weddingsunder10k,febmbl0,t1_fe84z8z,1578960338.0,Exactly! ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a glass of wine. Just dip.‚Äù
Weddingsunder10k,febm9wj,t1_fe84wsq,1578960316.0,Yeah! Thanks! Everyone is really boosting my confidence!
Weddingsunder10k,fe7p1i6,t1_fe6a2we,1578917556.0,Thank you! I‚Äôll definitely document once all are finished.
Weddingsunder10k,fe7oujp,t1_fe6vqiz,1578917469.0,Thank you! Dresses will be the Cabernet color and dusty rose primarily for flowers!
Weddingsunder10k,fe7op6d,t1_fe6sibg,1578917433.0,Thank you! I was very pleased.
Weddingsunder10k,fe7of4w,t1_fe6a5ji,1578917400.0,"Thank you! Greenery is from Hobby Lobby. We just got a few picks to start to assist with the coloring. We‚Äôll get more this week and as they continue to go on sale throughout the year. You can also rain check at hobby lobby! So if you find something you want you can bulk order it when it‚Äôs on sale and get it for the sale price when it comes in on the next truck. 

Fianc√© and I met working in the frame shop üòÖ"
Weddingsunder10k,fe7o3ew,t1_fe65wdi,1578917304.0,I think some of them straightened out more than others. I‚Äôll have to watch for this when I do more. I ordered a few more larger ones like peonies so hopefully those keep their shape!
Weddingsunder10k,fe7nylm,t1_fe67wij,1578917243.0,They got a little stiff. I‚Äôm not sure as time goes on. Someone above recommending spritzing them with water and covering in a plastic bag to help them retain water.
Weddingsunder10k,fe7nuy5,t1_fe6a5h4,1578917195.0,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking of doing! Some bridesmaids are nearby and willing to help. I want to tailor the paint ratio and coloring so I could have them come over and we bust it all out.
Weddingsunder10k,fe7nq8v,t1_fe6k04w,1578917129.0,"I saw you can purchase dye from the company but we decided to try with acrylic craft paint. I read a tutorial that mentioned this instead. One part paint, two to three parts water. This is a brand we used [Folk Art Paint](https://www.hobbylobby.com/Crafts-Hobbies/Stencils-Craft-Paints/Acrylic-Craft-Paints/Acrylic-Paint/p/PT50110) the paints were 30% off at hobby lobby last week"

Weddingsunder10k,fe7ncbp,t1_fe6gtju,1578916960.0,This batch got a little dried out but not very brittle. Definitely not as soft as the original flower. I‚Äôll be trying this suggestion!
Weddingsunder10k,fe7na6p,t1_fe6ly1k,1578916924.0,That‚Äôs a great idea
Weddingsunder10k,fe7n8y6,t1_fe6b2tw,1578916905.0,I love Azazie! I‚Äôll be purchasing my wedding dress from them. I‚Äôve done the try at home option with a few gowns and have been really impressed with the quality for the price. This is the one I‚Äôll be getting!

Weddingsunder10k,fe653zc,t1_fe62e3s,1578881983.0,"Awesome! I mentioned it to my friends and they said the wood flowers seem ‚Äúso us.‚Äù We build wood projects together as a hobby, his ring is wood, and we met working together in a frame shop. He‚Äôs just as excited about these as I am!!"
Weddingsunder10k,fe64xl8,t1_fe6131v,1578881873.0,Thank you! I appreciate it! I‚Äôm eager to fine tune and draw up our real plans.
Weddingsunder10k,fe64tf4,t1_fe611ux,1578881799.0,I believe it will be more cost effective! I wanted to Ted them out and then estimate a budget for all the floral needs versus real flowers. I‚Äôve seen images of bouquets I like that would be $200 dollars or so and I should be able to make them for $25-$50.
Weddingsunder10k,fe64nyr,t1_fe610pg,1578881704.0,"Fianc√© was not happy about my pink request but he wound up liking them all together. Dresses will be the Cabernet color! 

I colored the cream roses with a paint color similar to the natural color. I think it helped them look better!"
Weddingsunder10k,fe60omr,t1_fe5zo5c,1578879163.0,"I purchased an assortment a few weeks ago from Sola Wood Flowers. They had a big sale! I got about 150 smaller flowers for $30 to test run. We mixed acrylic craft paint in our colors with warm water and dip dyed each flower. One coat, set aside to dry for 24 hours, and then additional coats as needed. Each flower needed at least two coats. You can buy dye from Sola or use craft paint. Sola also has pre-made kits you can purchase! 

The flowers come without stems. I got some metal stems from Hobby Lobby and hot glued them. I‚Äôll probably do a felt covering of some kind on the real deal to hide the bottom. 

In all, this batch is probably $15 worth of supplies including the filler greenery. More work, but we wanted something we could plan ahead and repurpose later!"
Weddingsunder10k,fe6095u,t1_fe5ymqc,1578878890.0,Thank you! We do woodworking together and the wood flowers seemed like a perfect fit for our interests and budget. We‚Äôve got a year and a half to go so plenty of time to fine tune!
Weddingsunder10k,fe606gw,t1_fe5w300,1578878840.0,Thank you! That‚Äôs partly why we want to use wood - we can repurpose!
Weddingsunder10k,fe6057e,t1_fe5uyy8,1578878818.0,"Not too bad. I used plastic bowls and my own craft paint I picked out to match our colors. Put some in, mixed with water, and then dyed. I recommend waiting 24 hours to do a second coat."
Weddingsunder10k,fe5tr4w,t1_fe5tenk,1578874749.0,Thank you! I‚Äôm really excited about them!
Weddingsunder10k,fdn2iwx,t1_fdmpns8,1578575350.0,Neat! We both grew up here and still live/work here! Fianc√© is finishing graduate school at SIU in spring 2021 and then we may venture out. We both agreed we needed an outdoor wedding to have the beautiful fall trees as our background!
Weddingsunder10k,fdm7hsi,t1_fdm6yvd,1578541694.0,[Havisham House](https://havishamhouse.com/about/)
Weddingsunder10k,fdm7fhk,t1_fdm6yvd,1578541648.0,Havisham House! Built in 1892 and sat vacant for a few years until the new owners bought it in 2017 and brought it back to life. It‚Äôs been a bed and breakfast primarily but they‚Äôre expanding with a new 200 person pavilion on the lot. The pavilion should be done by May of this year and we‚Äôre planning for fall 2021 so we are excited to see it in person this fall!
Weddingsunder10k,fdlrgqc,t3_em1vhr,1578530740.0,Wedding will be 125-150 guests in Southern Illinois on the wine trail. Lots of cabins nearby and beautiful views of the Shawnee National Forest. Cannot. Wait.
relationship_advice,fd7h7id,t3_ek8ueg,1578204459.0,"Coworker and I had similar limbo three years ago. He was a bit flirty and we talked about both wanting to go to the gym. I got the courage to ask for his number to arrange to meet up. The gym was super awkward but we texted every other day or so about a similar interest. a few days later we went to a bar with some coworkers. I told him I thought he was cute. We‚Äôre engaged now - so it‚Äôs worth the shot! We don‚Äôt work at the same place anymore but we did for about a year of our relationship and kept it very hush hush.

Definitely keep things at work strictly work. If you get a chance to spend time with them outside of work, that‚Äôs a safer environment. I also wasn‚Äôt sure if feelings were real so getting into a more natural environment in public was helpful. Good luck!"

dogpictures,fc0yzwv,t1_fc0ydy9,1577303537.0,His dad suggested Kermit the Dog or Linkin Bark. We were going for a pun. Linkin Bark won the popularity vote of our friends!
dogpictures,fc0xts0,t3_efhc5l,1577302592.0,Adding: this look is brought to you by the final treat in the Aldi dog advent calendar. He saw how big it was and immediately started performing his tricks.
dogpictures,fc0xjms,t1_fc0x7jc,1577302366.0,He is! And he knows it! Those puppy dog eyes are our weakness. We couldn‚Äôt have gotten a better rescue pup.
dogpictures,fc0wd99,t1_fc0swym,1577301433.0,"We did a DNA test. When we got him from the shelter he was labeled as ‚Äúterrier mix.‚Äù His doggie DNA came out to be: 12.5% Beagle, 12.5% German Shepard, 12.5% Shar Pei, 12.5% Shiba Inu, and 12.5% Boston Terrier. The remainder was ‚Äúterrier mix.‚Äù We can see each of those breeds in his physical characteristics and personality!"
dogpictures,fc0e56s,t1_fc0e0vq,1577288352.0,Yep! Fun fact: he doesn‚Äôt bark.
