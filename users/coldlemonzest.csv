>no need to eat every damn hour

do u not see the link here? if u were gaining weight, u didnt need to eat ""every damn hour""

edit: its also a misconception that the majority of vegans think that our ancestors lived vegan like today, but thats not a justification to live 1 way or the other. people 50 years ago were horribly racist. does that mean we should continue to lynch black people?"
