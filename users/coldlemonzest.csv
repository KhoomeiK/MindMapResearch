do u not see the link here? if u were gaining weight, u didnt need to eat ""every damn hour""

edit: its also a misconception that the majority of vegans think that our ancestors lived vegan like today, but thats not a justification to live 1 way or the other. people 50 years ago were horribly racist. does that mean we should continue to lynch black people?"

ive never had to deal with battling medical obesity, but it would be more beneficial to the patient to address the root of the issue while also tackling the weight problem too."
