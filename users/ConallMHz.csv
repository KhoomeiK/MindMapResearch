memes,feooeaw,t1_feo1re6,1579303012.0,"Depends, in the case of sociopaths people are get it because they experienced a traumatic experience as kids, most commonly one were they got abused, which leads to them losing the ability to empathize. Phycopaths, on the other hand, are born without the ability to empathize because of a mutation. It's commonly said that phycopaths are born while sociopaths are bred, as phycopaths or sociopaths are likely to abuse kids who turn into sociopaths who abuse kids who turn into sociopaths and so on. So if one parent is a phycopath or sociopath, then their children are likely to be sociopaths. The first sign of someone being a phycopath or sociopath, by the way, is them hurting animals when they are children."

As time goes on this illusion gets distorted, the same way things start to look like they're moving if you stare at them too long, and your brain starts thinking it's someone else's face. At this point your brain starts filling it in with other things, our brains are very good at pattern recognition, even when it's seeing patterns that aren't there, like seeing faces in the clouds. What it fills it in with can lead to some truly creepy results. The idea of Bloody Mary is that if you go in thinking you're going to see Bloody Mary, the brain will fill in the gaps with the description of Bloody Mary provided."

However racism against Muslims in America, and indeed all over the world, is caused by terrorism, mostly because of 9/11. So if I follow this logic here... Racism against Muslims is caused by terrorism which is caused by racism against Muslims which is caused by terrorism which is caused by  racism against Muslims which is caused by terrorism which is caused by... So where did it start? Also this is wrong, terrorism is caused by extremists, not because of Muslims immigrants get treated unfairly. The reason we have Muslim immigrants is because they where escaping their homes because of religious persecution from those same extremists, so completely different people to begin with."
insanepeoplefacebook,fdg54l9,t3_ekynpn,1578380394.0,"I don't get his point, ""this does not happen at an alarming rate considering all the other shootings that don't get coverage."" So your saying that there are more school shootings than there is coverage for, which would imply it is happening at a more alarming rate than we see. BTW it is happening at a very alarming rate, approximately 5.4 per year (from 2007 to 2019), compared with the previous statistics of 1.6 per year (from 1982 to 2006). And from 1949 to 1998 there was only 1 shooting every 5 years. So not only is it happening at an alarming rate, it is becoming more and more frequent."

Secondly, wars in the Middle East where not so that people would praise white people, they where because they wanted to stop the people who flew planes into their buildings, and the people associated with them They didn't raise a war against the Middle East, they raised a war against the terrorists factions, and worked with the states in the middle east that were also against thoes factions."
