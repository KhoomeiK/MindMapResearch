My favorite Baptist joke- 

Once I saw this guy on a bridge about to jump. I said, “Don’t do it!”

He said, “Nobody loves me.” I said, “God loves you. Do you believe in God?”

He said, “Yes.”

I said, “Are you a Christian or a Jew?”

He said, “A Christian.”

I said, “Me, too! Protestant or Catholic?”

He said, “Protestant.”

I said, “Me, too! What franchise?”

He said, “Baptist.”

I said, “Me, too! Northern Baptist or Southern Baptist?”

He said, “Northern Baptist.”

I said, “Me, too! Northern Conservative Baptist or Northern Liberal Baptist?”

He said, “Northern Conservative Baptist.”

I said, “Me, too! Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region, or Northern Conservative Baptist Eastern Region?”

He said, “Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region.”

I said, “Me, too! Northern Conservative†Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1879, or Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1912?”

He said, “Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1912.”

I said, “Die, heretic!” And I pushed him over."
todayilearned,fdpeu6w,t1_fdot4x8,1578626806.0,"Gentle ribbing over doctrinal differences. I've been around all these different groups. The quickest way to explain is that Baptists believe only a select few (them) are ""saved"". Most people think ""Southern Baptists"" when their denomination comes up, and SB folk are extremely strict on ""public"" appearance (while being hypocritical af). Catholics believe strongly in ritual and there's a fair amount of tolerance in their doctrine for sex out of marriage, drinking, drugs etc because they believe in confession (sincere repentance matters but people are only human). Methodists tend towards a middle of the road approach but are often asually confused with Baptists because both have  a large penchant for covered dish ""fellowship"" dinners but Methodists like their alcohol like Catholics and they ordain gay ministers*.

*Controversial inside the United Methodists and the current (like right now, today) cause of a potential schism (personally, I would support pro-LGBT clergy).
