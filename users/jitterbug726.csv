Thanks for your prompt reply!

It's a relatively new hotel (under one-year) and is a single-property location on a popular resort island. As it's not part of an umbrella like the Hilton or Shangri-La, the brand isn't as strong as those.

Would you happen to have any advice on that? Would it be somewhere in the area of 5 to 1, 10 to 1? I've seen some agencies claiming that their ROAS for hotel clients is 21 to 1 but I feel that to be unfeasible for a new property."
