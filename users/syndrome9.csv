Never take advice from someone who doesn't have what you want. If your parents have a good, strong relationship, and that's what you want, then most definately talk to them.

She probably gave you that ""boy who takes advice"" line because she knows if you talk to them, they're gonna tell you to leave her."

To each her own.

But if you want to make 100% sure that this never happens again, using pads will eliminate the risk."

Things like this happen sometimes, and yes, its gross, but put yourself in her shoes, you said she was already sensitive about things like that. So try and picture how embarrased she is, plus the frustration of knowing it was something so small causing all that problem.

And if you have kids, there's gonna be a lot more than smells to deal with. 

Its a psychological block, you can get past it. You can suggest she stop using tampons but that's about it."
