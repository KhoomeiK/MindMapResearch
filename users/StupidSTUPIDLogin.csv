But not at the expense of intelligent action that actually makes a difference & doesn't sandbag everyone involved.

I can direct you to a young man, right now, a man that works for a meager paycheck & inserts almost all of it into a slot machine. He borrows from his friends, which is fine, but don't expect to see that money repaid. You can feel sorry for him & give him your money, and he'll blow it on alcohol, smokes, & slots.

I actually can't direct you to him until April; he's in jail for frequently violating his probation. Drinking alcohol & posting pictures of it on social media.

When I see our special, premium land being taken up to hold a bunch of dead bodies that people rarely visit, I can't help but think...what a waste.

Land is for crops. Land is for buildings, and roads, and parks, and developments...with a world population of 7.7 billion people and climbing, we simply cannot afford to continue this practice of worshipping & enshrining our dead. Land is life! Land is for the ***living***. Land is not meant for the dead.

Please reconsider your casket & plot (and probably headstone) plans. They're needlessly expensive, and there is no benefit to be gained. Let your final acts...be acts of selflessness. Of thoughtful, considerate action. Of love & practicality.

All that said, I am so sorry you have to go through this. We'll all be joining you soon enough! Be at peace, eat some great food, and hug your loved ones tight. It's almost a small blessing in a way, knowing your time & saying your goodbyes...I've almost died a dozen times in very sudden ways, each time I wouldn't have had the chance for closure that you do!"

Those children in cages at the border, lots of opinions & good points to be made there. What came of all that talk, awareness, and negative political fighting? Probably nothing, I'm sure it's just business as usual.

Topic of the month is Iran. Iran's kind of a shitty place to live, especially if you're a woman. What's going to come of all this talk? What am I, Whitebread McGee Midwest USA farmer boy, going to ***ACTUALLY DO*** about Iran? Nothing. I'm not in a good position to do much of anything. Geographically. Financially.

I've got an aunt that likes to stay focused & involved on a global scale, talks about things happening in different countries & wants to talk about it. A lot. I don't shy away from the discussion, but yeah I'm not always ""clued in"" to the latest happenings in Ooga-Booga-Stan. I've got 2 jobs. I donate plasma. I have a property that needs cleaning & revamping. I'm a super busy dude. I don't have the time to dedicate to researching & learning about overseas situations that, at the end of the day...I can only talk about.

I want to do more than just talk. I want to be an active, physical force of good in my local community. I think that's the better path, for me anyway."

LifeProTips,fc2vv6j,t1_fc1yo32,1577375423.0,"UPS guy here, it's not that they don't want to leave the package, but it requires interaction/a signature. I'll admit, I've  knocked loudly & rang the doorbell then *immediately* started filling out a 'Sorry We Missed You' note probably a dozen times. Then the customer actually comes to the door, and I'm pleasantly surprised.

It's a shitty situation, a 'shituation', if you will...I'm delivering a package to you that requires a signature. I'm working. You're not home, because you're also working...what's to be done??

Here's things I've done: I have routed the package to an Access Point (new program), so you can sign for it/accept it at a local store. If not AP eligible, and not a 21+ signature (booze/other), I try to grab a signature from a neighbor & leave it with them. Note on your door, hey, your package is at Neighbor Bob's & he signed for it. Finally, if I do leave a note & it's not 21+ sig req, you can sign the back accepting responsibility for the package & I can leave it the next day. Unless it's an Apple package, I think...they're controlling little bitches & I don't leave Apple stuff. That's usually AP eligible.

There was one time, only one time, I broke protocol. This old as hell lady ordered some wine. I ***know*** this lady, right? She orders entirely too much shit. It pops for 'signature required'...this lady is so friggin old, she practically farts dust. ***I can assure you she's 21+***. I was in the middle of faking her signature when she just so happened to pull up, thank goodness, but I wasn't going to not deliver her wine. I'm not an idiot. She orders wine...she gets her wine.

See, as most (good) drivers see it...we don't want your shit. We really don't. You guys order a lot of cheap bullshit, and if we really wanted it, we'd buy it ourselves. What do we want? We want all your packages...off our truck. Quickly. Like 20+ stops per hour quickly. Bing bang boom, stop complete, job well done. That's what we do.

Signature packages complicate that. They can be a bitch. But to not even try to make contact & leave a note, well, that's kind of dumb. See? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ I don't want your stuff!! Please! Come get your stuff!"
