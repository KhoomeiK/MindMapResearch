I have five kids in my house, three of whom are old enough to have jobs and transport themselves. I know their work schedules, but their social plans are often last minute.

AmItheAsshole,ff93pw7,t1_ff8zgu7,1579704099.0,"Not disagreeing with you at all. It's really tough, even if you're genuinely worried about the person. 

What controlling and/or lazy parents don't seem to get, is that there's a huge difference between being critical and mean about someone's weight and being supportive of their health. For example, my mom used to tell me things like, ""You'd be pretty if you lost weight."" (I was clinically underweight at the time, but that's a whole other issue.) This was not helpful. I already felt ugly and she was confirming it for me. She also made it clear that external appearances (whether voluntary or not) were an indicator of personal worth. So not only was I ugly I was bad. Cue more emotional eating, not less, and eventually I really was overweight. It took a long time away from my mom for me to feel like I was worth being healthy. 

Having learned what not to do, I have struggled to find the best way to help my child who is overweight. Even though they're a kid, I've found the only thing that works is keeping healthy snacks in the house and no bad ones. Limiting but not eliminating junk food. Cooking healthy meals together as a way to sneak in education about diet and nutrition. Finding shared activities that are physical, but are not straight up exercise, and being very, very available to listen without judgement or advice (unless requested) when they're upset about anything. I can't control what they eat when they're at school or with friends. I can't stop their dad and his mom from buying them wholesale-sized bags of candy and feeding them fast food for every meal they share. I can only make sure they feel loved for who they are and give them the knowledge they need to make healthy choices when they're ready. And yes, they're still overweight. I've not discovered a solution at all; I'm just hoping the middle school growth spurt will help. 

It's super hard. If you're a parent, you probably know your child well enough to know how to best approach a weight problem. If you don't, there might be a bigger problem. OP's mom clearly has a slew of bigger problems."

Your sister is TA for bringing a child to an adults only party and your nephew is TA for going where he shouldn't and not being careful. He gets a little bit of a pass for being 9 and getting dragged to a party where he wasn't invited, then ignored. He didn't do it on purpose, but he's old enough to know better than to go snooping around, so still gets the kid version of TA.

So why are you TA? Because you're willing to lose your sister and nephew over this. Fifteen hours of your life is more important to you than your family. I'm happy for you that your time is worth Â£167 an hour-- with the family discount, of course-- but you've let it turn your priorities on their head. 

You could have been the good guy here. You could have conveyed how big a deal it was to lose this work without sending a bill. You could have asked that your nephew help you with chores or canvas prep or anything to ""repay"" what he damaged. That would have taught him both accountability and forgiveness.

I'm thinking about building a window shelf enclosure for my cat that has epilepsy, so I recently priced out the materials.

Also, a few hidden sleeping places, especially at least one that's really warm, maybe even with a heating pad. Again, treats to get him to check it out, then let him decide. 

You might try a harness and leash for outdoor excursions, but honestly I've never had any luck with those unless they're introduced in kittenhood. 

If you have the money or someone who's handy, you can build an enclosure with a sitting shelf outside one of your windows or even freestanding in your yard. That way he could be outdoors, but still be safe. There are super fancy ones for sale, but a simple home-built one would probably work just as well. We had a chicken coop with two rooms and runs on both sides so we used one room and one run for kittens one year when we had a bumper crop of pregnant strays show up.

What makes you both suck is that neither of you is willing to put your partner first. It's normal to want the world to stop when you're grief stricken, but it doesn't. Sometimes you have to set aside your own feelings for a few hours to make someone else happy. It doesn't mean you aren't sad. It doesn't mean you'll enjoy the party. It means you're willing to take some discomfort in order to spare your partner. 

Your bf is also focused on his own feelings. He's not thinking about how the mood of a party or being in a crowd isn't compatible with what you're going through and is interpreting your refusal as a sign that he isn't important to you. In return, he's sending you the message that getting what he wants is more important than how you feel.

needadvice,feht0ly,t3_ep878i,1579123284.0,"Your best bet is just to ask straight up. 

As the parent of teens, I'd think you were:

1. Just not wanting to interrupt a text conversation or a video you were watching (ok, whatever), 

2. Watching porn and masturbating in the shower (maybe worth a conversation about porn, but as long as you're not leaving a mess, no big deal), or

3. Sexting (kind of a big deal and time to put on my mom hat because it's my job to protect you).

I don't know your mom. I don't know how comfortable she is talking about private stuff, but her giving you ""the look"" suggests she's not able to just ask what's up. So I guess it's up to you to be the grownup and initiate a mature conversation."

The good news is, in just a few years, you'll be able to do this in a controlled way that gives you the benefits of ""escape"" without the downsides.

Sometimes a drive in the country listening to music will do. 

Sometimes a spontaneous roadtrip fits the bill. Just a couple of years ago, I was burned out from grad school and general life stress, but I had about 36 hours in which I didn't have to be mom or work. I jumped in the car and drove 8 hours to one of my favorite places, went for a hike, rested a little, and drove home in time to pick up my children. It was amazing. 

When you're an adult (sooner than it seems!), you can plan longer road trips, travel to whatever random place you choose, or take a week or more at a solitude retreat (highly recommended!). 

Taking a break from your everyday life can be both normal and healthy. Everybody needs a little adventure. You just have to be creative and find a way. 

Since you're young and don't have the freedom to do as you please yet, you might explore online/read about travels that appeal to you. Read about people who really did walk away from it all, even if only for awhile. You'll get new ideas and find out what you *don't* want to do, as well. 

Good luck, hang in there, and happy adventures!"

Btw, Asperger's (with or without anxiety and insomnia) doesn't make you mentally disabled. Neurodivergent? Sure. But that's not a bad thing. Yes, you have challenges that neurotypical people may not, but you also have abilities they don't. 

Given how your mom acts like she's a martyr and uses your uniqueness to get attention, it's not surprising you've come to see it as a flaw. But your post also shows you know at some level that she's wrong. You're stuck with her for a while and that's a *real* handicap, but you'll get away eventually and you'll figure out what works for you and how you can live your best life.

AmItheAsshole,feagbl3,t3_eo6j73,1578948375.0,"YTA. But you also have my sympathy for your pain. As both an adopted kid and an adoptive mom, I understand your feelings, but would like to suggest a different way to look at this. 

Adopted kids, no matter how loved, are missing a part of their history, which in turn makes is harder for them to figure out their identity. It isn't a reflection on your parenting for your daughter to want to know about this part of herself. 

Your daughter isn't rejecting you. She asked you to go with her. She wants you to be a part of this major experience in her life. She's asking for your love and support. And you're telling her she can only have them if she feels what you want her to feel, if she ignores an significant part of what makes her who she is. That's a huge rejection. She's asking you to help her heal from a foundational rejection that underlies her whole life. Instead of help, you're giving her another wound. 

I understand that it feels bad to hear her call a stranger her mother. But it isn't the same version of ""mother"" she applies to you. Mother who gave birth is not the same as mother who raised you. It would be great if our language had different words for those roles, but it doesn't. Constantly saying ""birth mother"" is awkward for some people. 

And saying ""mother"" also may reflect her hope that this woman will actually love her, will somehow undo hurt of having been given away. It doesn't matter that there were good reasons and she's had a great family. The idea that the person who is supposed to love you the most was capable of giving you away is hurtful at a very primal level. This hurt doesn't mean she doesn't love and appreciate you. 

I do not mean to downplay your very real pain. Your feelings do matter. But you are the parent. It's your job to put your child's needs first. She needs to know you love her, even if she wants to know her bio history. You need to talk about your feelings, but not to her. Get a therapist. Join an adoptive parents group. Get all the support you can. And then hug your daughter. Tell her you will go with her. Be kind to the bio mom. You're not going to have to talk to the bio mom much. This meeting is about your daughter. Just be there for her and reassure her of your love. 

Your relationship with her and your place in her heart will not suffer from this visit. You have the chance to strengthen both immeasurably. Or you can destroy your relationship and deeply wound your daughter where she is already hurt. It's up to you. It may hurt more than anything you've ever done, but that's what we do as parents. We take the pain so our children don't have to. 

You can do this. You are strong enough. You are a good mom and you love your children."
