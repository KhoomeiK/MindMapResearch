ihavesex,ffc5in0,t1_ffbqzh6,1579792009.0,You didn't miss out in the slightest it's like regular sex but you're also depriving yourself of a day of education.
fatlogic,ffc49xi,t3_esu14w,1579791170.0,BMI is a perfectly fine tool for your average person and only really becomes an inaccurate measure of health if you're goal is to put on muscle.
dndmemes,ff4ue54,t1_ff4t1y8,1579572676.0,"Omg yes, DMing sucks when you're depressed I can not count the number of times I've had to pull shit out of my ass because I've been to depressed to prep a session."
dndmemes,fetfcec,t3_eqknn6,1579374885.0,"I had a DM who would constantly find a way to keep my character coming back because I was 1 of 2 characters left from the original group but the only competent one of said 2. It always came with some fun story development for my character mind you like the first time it happened I made a deal with the Literal Devil, Asmodeus himself which was later leveraged to bring a new player in the second time I was resurrected by the willing sacrifice of the Paladins sapient, telepathic,  flying Celestial Elk which changed my sorcerers Bloodline from Abyssal to Celestial along with a change in looks which included a pair of silver colored antlers that extend 2 inches from the top of my head and were growing."
bisexual,fegs1yi,t1_fegqo09,1579101211.0,I honestly have never experienced disdain from anyone or been hypersexualized. Had someone been disbelieving that Bisexuality even existed but it wasn't disdain just stupidity.
ihavesex,fe0hd4e,t3_enkgql,1578813456.0,Buddy those condoms go on your finger not your Johnson you're looking for the Family Planning aisle next time you go just so you're aware.
bisexual,fduxeyw,t3_en52vv,1578740504.0,The Building blocks of some Futa hentai are why you're Bi? I mean as good a  reason as any I guess.
DnD,fdkp615,t1_fdirysc,1578508249.0,"I've met few Good DMs that are so strict as to say ""everything works this way only this way and it can never be changed"" and by few I mean none. their's a reason why one of the best tools in a DMs  toolbelt is Adaptability. Honestly of all the lore I write my players only ever see a small fraction of it so editing can be a thing and even things already established can have exceptions"
dndmemes,fdiu1lz,t1_fdiddn0,1578451032.0,I honestly wish I could it's been so long I've long since forgotten where I read it
dndmemes,fdhbdov,t1_fdh7dsv,1578419344.0,"Last I read humans have pronounced breasts due to our walking up right. As they serve the same function in sexual attraction as our butt cheeks but are more visible at a distance. Where if you were in a more stooped position as our other primate cousins tend to spend most of their time, they wouldn't stand out much to be worth while. Although an interesting change in human behavior recently seems to be a trending preference towards smaller breasts."
dndmemes,fdh9z1b,t1_fdh7iza,1578418574.0,Isn't that everyone on deviantArt....

ihavesex,fdh9pzm,t1_fdh6bu2,1578418420.0,This is going to sound like a brag I promise it's not but as someone who has hit a partners cervix several times even just hitting it can hurt her going through it just isn't going to happen I don't care what kind of dick you've got but in the fantastical world buddy is living in I'm betting it's going to be hospital time considering there isn't a sphincter in the body you won't damage just by ramming something through it.
DnD,fdh84is,t1_fdh4y5c,1578417435.0,As a DM I'd say it's up to player creativity it never confers any mechanical advantage it's always flavor but I honestly want my players to really connect with the world I've created and that's much easier if I let them craft a sliver of it.
DnD,fdh7ke6,t1_fdh6bzh,1578417092.0,I mean with the right invocations and pact you can totally do it without clearing with the DM.
polyamory,fdh72lb,t3_ele4ff,1578416786.0,"Exactly how are you exploring your poly side? Because usually(read always) Poly involves the informed consent of all parties involved this would include your husband if you're sleeping with other people and he doesn't know or hasn't agreed to it, it's just cheating even if you're so much as carrying on a non-sexual relationship that's still an emotional affair. I'm not saying that's what you're doing but it reads like what so I've got to ask."
DMAcademy,fdegkwc,t3_eky7ct,1578338568.0,"Let me break it down as a DM does by narrating the tale of timmy.
Timmy had been restless for the past few weeks when he slept even the sweetest of dreams would turn sour sooner and sooner into the night until his eyes would close and he would see nothing but scenes of horror and woe. It was only just last week that the horrors followed him out of his dreams as he woke he could hear the whispers coming from the shadows in his room and as the week progressed they  grew louder and followed him away from home whispering something that seemed just to distant to make out clearly even as the voices sprang from every shadow or dark spot  he could see that is until tonight when something seemed to finally break through and the whispers became a discordant roar of sound, the voice of a dark and terrible god it's power driving him to his knees as he began to weep half in terror half in exhaustion from the weeks of restless nights. As the being spoke it offered solace if he only served it and in a moment of weakness and desperate need for reprieve he accepted the offer.

And that is how Timmy became the leader of a demon cult working to fully release his dark master."
ihavesex,fdedj3a,t3_eky800,1578336665.0,I don't need to know your back when it's only been 15 seconds mate.
fatlogic,fdedfgy,t3_eky9fe,1578336603.0,"Yes because ""I can be 400lbs and be healthy"" isn't anti-science or stupid nope not at all apparently."
polyamory,fdd64qy,t1_fdcumkx,1578296469.0,"As someone whose made the mistake of being the other person in a similar situation(and being rightfully set straight on it by this Sub and some friends) I can tell you love fades away when you don't water it but the regret takes time and effort to fix. So to Echo abz here, Don't be an accomplice to cheating."
bisexual,fdd4sao,t3_ekp7w6,1578294783.0,Communication for one it's doesn't matter if you have no experience if they have an idea of what they like and can tell you it.
bisexual,fdd4mfy,t3_ekp9f1,1578294585.0,That's rough mate. My dad still thinks it's funny to use faggot as an insult (he's about your age) despite the fact His wife(my mum) and both his kids (my sister and myself) are all out and open Bisexuals (well Pan in my sister's case but it's under the umbrella).
bisexual,fdd49ak,t1_fdd1znb,1578294140.0,Awww thanks Bi-der dad. Live Long and Prosper mate.

bisexual,fdaa1t5,t1_fd9uqoy,1578243502.0,"I got really feed up with the PUA shit really fast. All I could think was even if this shit worked having a lot of sex isn't worth me feeling like scum to get it. Honestly I haven't found a decent book on the topic of attraction other than Models: Attracting Women Through Honesty. Which isn't really a PUA  it's more of a self help book that says ""if you want to have more dates, these are the aspects of your life you need to improve"" and then basicly focuses  a lot on Strong vulnerability which is actually such an important skill for having strong relationships be they Familial, Platonic, or Romantic."

fatlogic,fcxze51,t3_ejgni9,1578072562.0,"Not a rant really but a progress report I've convinced my sister (who handles the households main meal: dinner) to join me at the gym and to start eating better with me as well. The difficult part is she's a recovering anorexic so calorie tracking is a big no and risk of a relapse, so I'm going to focus on us just eat healthy food and reasonable portions. Actually if anyone has any advice that could help me in this please let me know and recipe sites would be helpful as well thank you."
polyamory,fcxwavc,t3_ejhre2,1578071373.0,Well this friend isn't very judgmental at all....I guess it's one of those times false advertising works in your favor.

bisexual,fcw6gcl,t1_fcv6tdy,1578018240.0,I mean to some degree I was . I just wasn't expecting there to be such a wave of absolute thirst so bad it was like they were all walking through a desert.

ihavesex,fcv8m3b,t3_ej3lux,1577996915.0,Just because it's big doesn't mean you can use it after a certain point you kinda need to learn some technique or you run the risk of hurting your partner. I've yet to meet the woman who enjoys constant cervical bashing and  perineum tears.
ihavesex,fcv7g7q,t3_ej204x,1577996219.0,Ahhh emotional fragility at its finest like a ticking time bomb ready to explode the moment you get some prospective and realize you've been a horrible person.

ihavesex,fcv42pr,t3_ej2pma,1577994223.0,"Wait let me get this straight...your religious beliefs stop you from swearing...something that at worst is going to offend someone, but it doesn't stop you from cheating on your wife multiple times...an act that betrays the trust of your partner can seriously effect their mental health let alone what divorce can do to the development of children......yes buddy I think you are the asshole and from the sound of it you still are an asshole. Some fucking people I swear how is it that they manage to make be consider my moral position on burning for eternity being bad."
fatlogic,fcup44l,t1_fcuogxl,1577985680.0,Also she says she runs 9 miles a week but that doesn't nessisarily mean it isn't a walk/run/walk sort of deal.
ihavesex,fcuoidv,t3_ej0nam,1577985341.0,What a scrub can't break the spacetime barrier and do all of that in one fuck how pathetic.
fatlogic,fclt8db,t1_fclpysp,1577755898.0,Depends what you mean by diet if we are talking a fad diet generally they aren't sustainable for most people so while they'll lose the weight they usually don't have the knowledge or skill set to maintain their new weight. If we are talking about  learning the basic nessecities of weight loss from proper portion control to even just basic cooking skills that honestly a chilling amount of people lack than nothing really but I think the big difference is the toolkit you're left with afterwards the problem is because of the diet industry not actually doing what it claims to be doing they've basically grown a frustrated fungus that just keep churning out dumber and dumber ideas growing more and more unwieldy and that fungal byproduct of the diet industry is what we now see as the Fat Acceptance Movement.
polyamory,fcjkuim,t1_fcjkdr2,1577691721.0,"That's good to know....I can deal with awkward personally, that was basically all my highschool and a bit afterward experience."

polyamory,fcjk856,t1_fcj6x16,1577690940.0,Wait my first time was mildly soul crushing please tell me it's just a level of awkward communication the first time or so.

polyamory,fc1ek5b,t3_efm195,1577316408.0,I can think of an easy one....one or both partners in a relationship are Bisexual and would like to persue an open relationship that would allow them to explore that... and that's just one reason of the many varied reasons people may choose to make a decision about their relationship that doesn't involve you or anyone else not in direct association with the relationship.
ihavesex,fc1e0p8,t3_efm6z7,1577315945.0,How is it that tinder seems to function for everyone else but when I've got 87 likes I can't find a single one of them....
