Brawlstars,fe9obhj,t1_fe93kwd,1578939929.0,They were shooting eachother plus it isn't teaming if both of them decided you were the biggest threat and temporarily focus you. If they were really teaming you would have probably shown it.
Brawlstars,fe93el0,t3_eo69oq,1578933769.0,They aren't teaming tho.

I definitely still like Penny, and I like playing her more than Barley (I'm terrible with him) or Tick (way too passive gameplay imo) but overall she is just my least favorite."

But if they increase price that's fair game, even if they don't change the skin. If you wanted it cheaper, you could've bought it earlier."

AskReddit,fe34l5w,t3_enoc62,1578845851.0,I'm still new to diving (about 20 logged dives and currently going for my deep dive degree) but I managed to lose my instructor during one of my first dives. I wasn't completely freaked out but I had to go to the surface by myself when I didn't really have a clue what I was doing. Someone I know has encountered something that made her quit diving alltogether. She was at 30m depth and got issues with breathing. She got scared and wanted to go up but her instructor held her down so that she wouldn't rise too fast and then calmly went to the surface with her. She hasn't dived since.

I think it teaches you how to study and gives you a slight advantage for learning certain languages but I think the most important thing is that you like doing it. As for the three languages I would choose I would probably go for Dutch (native language), French (also an official and important language in my country) and English (probably the most useful language in the world)."

Brawlstars,fe18mh8,t1_fe0v2lz,1578823802.0,If they backstab immediately and don't use teaming to their advantage then it's actually fine imo but if you're the guy that teams during most of the match and then backstabs you're even worse than the teamers.
AskReddit,fe18aww,t1_fdy1juf,1578823671.0,"I mean, empire was a good movie on ig's own imo. They didn't pad the runtime or split a story that could perfectly be told in one movie. Look at it this way: it's fine if the pay off of a story comes in a sequel but it's not fine if the first one doesn't have anything to tell because of it or ends at a very boring point. In that case you just feel that you actually got to the middle of what should be one movie."

Brawlstars,fdzfguy,t1_fdz8a2x,1578789683.0,Yeah I get it. I was just looking forward to some big boxes but apparently matchmaking isn't a thing in the championship challenge meaning that I get paired with players below 3k whilst playing against players above 10k. (Im at 15k but 3v1 when your teammates are feeding the enemies supers isnt easy)
Brawlstars,fdzdt7k,t3_enex9k,1578789303.0,I don't know if there is skill based matchmaking in the tournament. I'm at 15k and only got matched with players under 3k.

If party member vote against their party for a legislation or a law or something then they are fired from the party so the only real positions of power are those of minister and prime minister which are chosen by the parties after the voting.
