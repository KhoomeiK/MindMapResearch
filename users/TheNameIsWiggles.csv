AskReddit,fei4xi8,t1_fegs4al,1579130368.0,"This is what happened to me about 8 months ago. We're still hugging but we've found a way to make it work. We've both got our dominant hands extended past each other's shoulders right now, holding our phones. I'm redditing and he's on Facebook. Our mutual friends come and feed us as needed. Mostly fast food, so we've both gained a few pounds since April. When we get tired, we maintain the hug and just lower each other to the ground where we sleep on the sidewalk where the hug started. Some local homeless people occasionally come by and provide blankets and pillows. The police have dropped by and laid out some traffic cones to help foot traffic maneuver around us. Altogether, life hasn't been that bad since the long awkward hug began. The community has been very supportive. Some people have gathered around with signs, supporting it as some sort of political act. We've tried to explain but they wont listen, thinking it's all a part of the show. We don't mind though. We're just here for the hug. I know he needs it and I'm not fucking letting go until he begins to pull away first.

Edit:

pokemon,fef2npy,t1_feepq2h,1579046742.0,">Technically, ice could beat fire given that fire melts ice, which then becomes water and puts out the fire.

My response to that would be, yes, fire will cause ice to shift in its state of matter to liquid, losing its advantage against the object. But Pokemon don't do that. Using fire on an ice-type doesn't make the ice-type turn into a water-type.

It's like saying Charizard will use Flamethrower against Glaceon, causing Glaceon to turn into Vaporeon, thus rendering Charizard's move ineffective."
