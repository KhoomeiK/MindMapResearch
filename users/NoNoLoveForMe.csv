depression,fdbx4oq,t1_fd9k492,1578263291.0,"Thanks, I know I need to do it, I have been putting it off for such a long time due to low drive and motivation, also I don't like making phone calls and I am a big procrastinator on top of my depression. One problem is that it can take a long time here until you get a therapy because they have very long waiting lists, might be a couple of months before I can go to one.

But I am determined to do it now. Yeah I know, it won't take away the depression, but at least you can learn new ways to fight it, right? 

I live in Germany, so we are basically neighbours!  How long have you been living there now? 

Thanks, I will definitely keep you updated on how it is going!"
depression,fd951fi,t1_fd4jfhb,1578228542.0,"Really I would advice for you to get CBT because sometimes a third person or a professional can help you better to assess things from another view point. You will still have to get out of it by yourself, it's just that you will have someone to report to and held accountable for progress. I need to do it myself too but I havent managed to make an appointment yet.

Well it's good that you still do stuff. I just fear that with each passing year if you don't change anything, it could get worse, that's what happened to me basically. And it will be even harder to climb out of this. As for hobbies, I used to produce music and also went to the gym, but I am able to do both at the moment because of the state of my mind. 

I hope you get better!"
depression,fd93nrn,t1_fd4fny8,1578227892.0,"I think you need to be proud of yourself, not everyone would have to courage to do what you have done, break free of your old place and start a new life. I am proud of you for all it matters.
As for the world, I know it is really overwhelming because we are constantly bombarded with bad news everywhere we go, people hate each other for petty reasons. Violence and crime is high. I just want to live in peace but humanity is such an aggressive and often narrowminded species it seems. 
Good that you go to therapy, I really hope it helps you, I will also start to go to therapy soon.
In which country do you live now?"
depression,fd929h3,t1_fd6n8ux,1578227261.0,"Hello there. 
Yeah I have tried to stop multiple times over the last years but failed every time. If you never have a partner it also seems so hard to stop as the sexual energy needs some release.

Very good that you have an appointment. I will also call and make an appointment tomorrow. Keep me updated."
depression,fd419lx,t3_ejzrj0,1578163483.0,"Maybe it can help if you take some time off, if you feel that reddit has a negative impact on your life quality.

But I agree the world is in a pretty bad place, just as I am. I think the root of your depression might be another one though."
depression,fd4004r,t3_ejztct,1578163128.0,"I struggle with similiar thought patterns.. it all started that way. 

I don't have a solution unfortunately as my drive got so low that I literally just vegetate on my bed all day. My thoughts and intelligence took a huge hit, I almost can't have structured thought patterns anymore.

I advice you to look into CBT if you still have the energy to do it, it might just save your life!"
depression,fd3yukh,t1_fd3r196,1578162859.0,"Depression destroys your life more than anything else.
If there is medication that can improve your well being, even certain side effects are better than being suicidal."
ForeverAlone,fd3y20i,t1_fd2i838,1578162624.0,"Totally agree, good point."
ForeverAlone,fd2fv1b,t1_fd20y8n,1578146623.0,"Very good point. They want to act as if they have worked hard for their success, and to admit that they just won the genetic lottery would render their ""achievements"" void."
ForeverAlone,fd2fcfi,t1_fd28bs8,1578146402.0,"These people always confuse cause and effect. They think we are lonely BECAUSE we overthink and have no self confidence or are socially awkward or whatever.

But the reality is, we have no self confidence because we learned that we were never of enough value for anyone to choose to be with us.

Besides that, people like that usually posess all the physical traits that causes them to be attractive enough to get a partner, while we just don't. And they can't grasp the fact that they just got lucky. They want to feel validated for their success, so they act as if they have ""deserved"" it by being a certain way. And in their worldview we are just mentally weak and need to get our minds right. It's totally bs."

ForeverAlone,fcz6yh7,t1_fcy7u3m,1578094919.0,"I can understand that... Allow yourself to indulge in food for like 1 or 2 days a week, and try to stay in a caloric deficit the rest of the week and you can still get there. But I know how hard it is to do something like that especially when your mind isn't right. So don't stress yourself."
ForeverAlone,fcxqh95,t3_ej8mwq,1578069028.0,"I also feel like an NPC.

It is the worst feeling.

I don't know, you should try to lose weight just for the sake of your own health and wellbeing. At least weight is something you can entirely control yourself! In my instance, I am 5'8 and nothing I will ever do can make me be taller. But you could get an attractive body if you want.

But then again, there are many overweight girls who don't have a problem finding a partner. I really don't know."
ForeverAlone,fcxpr8x,t3_ej7wun,1578068578.0,"I don't have the balls to do shit like that and to be honest it is self protection because I would only receive rejections but I still think you did the right thing. 

The pain of regret and not knowing if it would ever have worked out is greater than the pain of rejection, at least in the long run. I at least think that is the case.  

But you should probably stop hanging out with her.."

Certainly interesting! I have also seen the opposite, a friend of mine is like 5'6 and his parents are really tall. It's weird."
ForeverAlone,fcxoril,t1_fcwvwl2,1578067956.0,"Lol same here. My dad is like 5'1 too and I turned out to be 5'8. My mother is 5'7 though. 
My mother was quite goodlooking when she was younger, and didnt have any problems finding someone. Unfortunately she had very low self esteem and a helper syndrome. 

Funny story is my parents almost considered getting me on growth hormones administered by my doctor when I was a child but when they found out I was going to be >170cm tall they decided not to do it because of the risks. My life could have been so different if I had a few extra cm.. but then again, maybe not.."
ForeverAlone,fcxngi3,t3_ejfo0m,1578067115.0,"I can relate to what you wrote. 

I was also the smart kid, but I got so tired of living and I am also a fuckup, and a bad professional because of my clinical depression. There is no hope of life getting better."
ForeverAlone,fcvzfro,t3_eiww7g,1578013614.0,"Could have been written by me. Life itself is already hard, even for the average joe, but for us, we never even got to enjoy good times, all we have is misery. 

I hate this life, I can't even sleep at night, I can't even have a single minute where my mind is not tormented by depression"
ForeverAlone,fcvyv05,t3_eiyess,1578013232.0,"I am in the same boat as you. Just as in your case, it probably is a mixture of reasons.

&#x200B;

Funny thing is, I wasn't always like this. 10 years ago, I was almost the opposite, I spent money on a lot of things, I wasn't really frugal. But with the development that my life has taken, I have become so frugal and I don't want to spend anything on me. It's almost like I don't want myself to have a good time.. I am not sure myself, need to reflect as well."
ForeverAlone,fcskoxr,t1_fcrh3wj,1577918534.0,"I had a bed before, still no gf. 

You are confusing cause and effect. I don't love myself because I realized I am not worth loving, apparently. Since no girl ever loved me.

Also, nobody can know whether I have a bed or not, it is not written on my forehead."
ForeverAlone,fcskerz,t1_fcrvacg,1577918350.0,"I tell you, it was an interesting episode in my life. I was still young and made lots of money by doing relatively little. From 2006-2010.

I usually played online and made more money than I make now! Psychologically it's weird though because I am older now, and should make ""more"". 

I wasn't clinically depressed back then though, although I already had many issues. With my current state of mind, this would be impossible."
ForeverAlone,fcsk2yz,t1_fcrsic4,1577918148.0,"Thanks! Bugs contain lots of protein and healthy micronutrients though! 

Well I have always had a low opinion of myself, and the last couple of years I had lots of rejections and I feel that I am just worth less than other guys, can't help it. I am clinically depressed as well."

ForeverAlone,fcsjjap,t1_fcrh1lb,1577917836.0,"Same here.. 

For me, it is the lack of self respect, I also genuinely stopped caring about myself. I just exist at this point, I don't live. It is torture."
ForeverAlone,fcsjei6,t1_fcruykd,1577917751.0,"I can relate.. maybe get a bed too? Or do you have no interest? 

I  stopped caring about me, still don't do.. I don't even know what caused the impulse to buy it, but I don't regret it. It's comfortable."
ForeverAlone,fcsj852,t1_fcrh7y7,1577917626.0,"I feel you.... I feel the same, escapism/distracting myself is the only reason I am still alive. My real existence is too sad so I watch youtube etc. Sometimes I can't even do that though, because I feel to fucked up in my mind and can't concentrate, have no attention span. I swear this depression has made me so much dumber than I used to be.

I just sleep my life away whenever shit like that happens."

ForeverAlone,fcqsrhu,t3_eif3of,1577891642.0,"I am scared of going back to work because I will work in a new project and don't know anyone there yet, also I don't know the exact type of work that I will do there. I am an anxious person and have social anxiety so I have my doubts that everything will work out. 

I wish I could just feel valued and have meaningful relationships, but I don't like myself and I assume other people don't respect me.

I don't really like working but staying at home all alone is even worse, which I have done for almost a decade.. I wish I could find a way to work independently but maybe this would actually be worse for me. Why does everything in my life have to be so dreadful and I always have to force myself.. fuck man."
ForeverAlone,fcqrvio,t1_fcqpe1p,1577891240.0,"This post hit me right in the feels. :/

I am sorry for what you have had to endure during your life. My life certainly is a complete desaster as well. 

I have also developed a very negative world view, in my opinion it's not even negative, but objective. The world is objectively a shitty place full of suffering. We are just here on this shit planet to compete against each other in any form. This doesnt stop at us humans, animals and all lifeforms have the same problem, but luckily for them they have limited intelligence to truly reflect how shit life is.

The evolution of higher intelligence must have been a fluke, and a shitty one as well."

One year ago I was still a long-time student with no ambitions, depressed as hell, no job, no drivers license, no money etc.

Now I improved so much on the surface, finished my engineering degree, got a full time job, have license and my own car.

But I am feeling more hopeless and broken than ever before. I get no female attention whatsoever, I only got rejections and I am not even trying anymore. I am truly dead inside, nothing excites me, nothing can spark emotions. All I feel is brain fog and depression from day to day.

 I just know deep down that nothing can ever help me, I even spent a month in a psychatric ward this year. 

Why even bother? I will probably not live to see the next decade to be honest, I am 33 but I feel like I am 80+, I am just sick of living(existing in my case, my life is not a real life)"
