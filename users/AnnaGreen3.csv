>Its not going to be perfectly 2% of males have the national average of 5* inches (*not sure exact average), with 49% above and 49% below that.

Nobody said this. I don't think you understand what I wrote, please read it again.

>You could have 50% of men above average(barely) and 3% average and the 47% well below average, and vice versa.

That's not how average works. Average is literally in the middle. 

If there are 3% average, that means there are 48.5% on each side.

If 20% of the men are average sized, that means there will be 40% of each side of the spectrum. 

>just because they're ""above average"" doesn't mean they're hung like a horse

Nobody said that. If the average is 10cm, even 10.1cm is above average.

>it's so inconsequential that it's not worth mentioning and is still considered average

That's not how measurement, averages or math works."

Edit. From Wikipedia: In colloquial language, an average is a single number taken as representative of a list of numbers. Different concepts of average are used in different contexts. Often ""average"" refers to the arithmetic mean, the sum of the numbers divided by how many numbers are being averaged. In statistics, mean, median, and mode are all known as measures of central tendency, and in colloquial usage any of these might be called an average value

Is there a way of defining average I'm not aware of?"
