He worshipped the Sun disk (Aton, or Aten), which was supposedly pulled across the sky by rays of sunlight in a gilded chariot, and changed his original name to Akhenaton which means ""son of Aten"", and was hugely controversial for turning Egypt into a monotheistic religion for a time. He was also very interested in supporting astronomers of the time looking at the sky. Coupled with the strange looks he and his progeny showed due to the excessive inbreeding and you get a recipe for weirdness. Conspiracists love to say the guy was an alien or had alien contacts, for example like the book called Chariots of the Gods."
