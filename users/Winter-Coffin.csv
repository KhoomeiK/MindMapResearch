The debt relief company talks to the banks or whomever the card is with. They get to an agreement about how much money is actually owed (trying to get to the lowest amount of debt that is allowable)
Then the customer makes payments to the debt relief company instead of paying to the creditor. 

This is for like, people that owe lots and lots and lots of money and not for like, if you have 8K spread out on a couple cards.

AskReddit,fdc5c7w,t3_ekkjpr,1578267406.0,"Downstairs neighbor would call on us to tattle that we were being loud nearly constantly. 
We are a young mid-twenties white couple and he was a middle aged to older black gentleman. 

When we moved in, in the morning he came outside to see what was going on. We introduced ourselves and he didn’t give us his first name, just said “I’m Mr Neighbor.” 
We actually got a slight discount from the apartment complex because the previous tenants in our unit had left their lease early. 

My partner is about 300lbs so we sometimes got called if he or I tripped over our own feet.

Once, and my second favorite story of this neighbor- is we got a visit from a security guard.
It was 10:30pm, I thought the ‘quiet time’ started at 11pm. My partner had tripped over his own foot, or dropped something. Something small.

The security guy rang the doorbell, I answered the door. 

Security: “Can I speak to whosever’s name is on the lease.”
Me: “Speaking. How may I help you?”
S: “May I speak to whosever’s mans name is on the lease.”
M: “....”
S: “....”
M: “Donny! He wants to talk to you!”
Donny, my partner, was not wearing either shirt or wasn’t wearing pants and was in a shirt and boxers, which is why he initially didn’t answer the door.
Additionally, the security guy let our kitten run out and I had to chase after her down the hall while all he said was for us to be quiet.

The pièce de résistance is the day after christmas. The first year in our building.
Donny and I were building new drawers from Ikea in the early afternoon. We were done by 2pm.
I then receive a call from the leasing office an hour later asking if we were doing any hammering. 

Me: “Oh yeah sorry. We were done by 2pm? I thought the quiet time wasn’t until 10pm?”

Girl from leasing office “oh, no youre fine! We just received a complaint about the noise and we’re only calling to tell the complainer that we did in fact talk to you about it! Lol”

Me: “thats a little silly but alright. We’ll try to be more quiet?”

Leasing office: “Right? Don’t worry about it youre fine!! Have a great day!”

The neighbor moved out very shortly after the new year. We haven’t had a noise complaint from any of the other people that moved in and out of the unit below us. 
We also got a puppy to play with the cat.

I kind of miss “getting in trouble” over stupid shit, but at the same time I do not at all.

It might be something to where the FBI is trying to build up enough solid evidence. Like how you can allegedly shoplift some stores all you want until what you take amounts to felony theft.

In Shiloh’s interview with Hansen she mentions that the hotel she was staying at were the ones that called the police.

Most likely an event report either has been or should be filed about the malfunction of the product. The hospital system, product manufacturer, and FDA should/have been notified about the event. 
The hospital is liable for damages, but is insured against a certain percentage of times of things going wrong to negatively impact patient care.

I would discuss with a malpractice attorney, and whomever is in charge as a legal liaison at the facility about what happened and if any compensation can be had from it.

If it was a product malfunction, an investigation should be done as to to why the product malfunctioned and if someone willingly/knowingly used an expired or out of service item when they shouldn’t have, or if the product manufacturer is at fault. 

If it was because of an unknowingly malfunctioning product that caused damages, this would be something that would/should be brought up to the manufacturer.
