Oxygennotincluded,fetuxh6,t3_epnv3x,1579380281.0,"Okay so i make it to like cycle 300 regularly (restart-itis) before any major issues. I also have some pretty big weaknesses of I often forget about oxygen production early on (cycle 100 and im still running on a single oxygen thing), and i SUCK at heat (which leads to be doing alternative lighting and stuff), and i suck at automation (but i know how the game will process what does what first in like the plumbing system). A lot of this is kinda basic in description so if its confusing just ask me to explain something and ill try to do it more clearly later.

1. Find water source and put down pump
2. build outhouse in area off to side (also place basin there so they have to wash up when they leave).
3. Place wheel and battery for basic power.
4. Research station
5. IMMEDIATELY go for food production. In that time dig out area for mealwood
6. Oxygen thing because i generally forget about that until mealwood tells me there isnt enough pressure
7. A lot of the time i skip the mush food bar thing (name escapes me) and go directly for the grill but that isnt always possible with setup. Anyway, disable mealwood as a consumable and only turn it into either the bar with the mush thingy or pickled meal cuz its better food.
8. My farms are always ALWAYS overkill. Im talking 12\*8 (which is max size i believe) with 3 rows of mealwood plants each (so like 36 ish plants) and then I build 2 of them. I dont pay attention to decay because i over produce.
9. Upgrade power! Almost never use coal or wood generators until later game because of the CO2 production is dangerous for me because i forget oxygen is a thing until its almsot too late. I mostly research power for the double battery. 
10. Research airlocks (it gives you more freedom to place quarantine areas). Anyway, I do this so I can lock off a place to dump polluted water and 2 composters so the polluted oxygen doesnt get into the main base (at least in excess).
11. Research water and plumbing, but I dont use it quite yet. I wait to get the water sieve to start proper plumbing and bathrooms. When I get the sieve I link up all the bathrooms to send to the sieve and then loop back around. The thing about the sieve loop is when dupes flush they actually ADD polluted water to the system, so it cant be entirely closed because then it will backup. So i link up the sieve to send the newly cleaned water to the bathrooms and then any excess goes to the farms to water the plants (normally bristle berries at this point because this is about the time i try to move away from mealwood. I always keep mealwood on hand in case, but bristle blossoms are better. The reason it takes this long is because i try to move shine nymphs into the farm so i dont have lights). 
12. Probably make a messhall at this point because i suck at that stuff and my dupes hate me
13. also probably make a barracks or something because theyve been sleeping on the bathroom floor this entire time"

Basically it amounts to faking it. This can be in the form of ignoring certain emotions (stress and similar ones) or just pretending you know what your doing. I do this but damn if being able to do this didnt take 12 of my 20 years to do it. Also it just might not be possible for some people depending on how severe their amxiety is.

Or you can go the classic route of spend every morning saying at least 1 thing you like about yourself, or repeating a mantra (same affect). 

Or you can find a place or situation in which you are comfortable and confident even if you might not realize it (normally talking about a favorite topic or playing a favorite game. In my case its mythology and tomb raider). Sometimes seeing oneself as confident in one area is a great help in others.

One major thing i think is super important (especially public speaking) is 100% LEARN TO PROJECT. If anything it forces you to sound more confident. If you like this alley id also say do a theatre class or just perform on stage regularly. Push yourself and your comfort zone"

Oo! I just went through a big brainstorming session fpr my final this semester(also research project). Mine will bre physically shorter and for psychology but the steps for brainstorming are the same!

1. Write down anything that comes to mind! Likes, hobbies, favorite movies, anything. doesnt have to be related to the field at all. Just dump everything on the paper!

2. Done? Great! Now throw it ALL in the trash. First ideas are always the worst. Do number 1 again! This time go for 20 items, but dont worry if you get stuck.

3. Biology student? List all your favorite lessons and terms! Like cellular respiration? Put that down. Electrical pulses? That. The mitochondria is the power house of the cell? Am i out of examples because i personally dont like biology? Also yes.

4. Go look up what is popular in research today. Dont let it determine what you pick but it can help see whats out there. (I use the NSF awards search).

5. What of steps 2 and 3 stand out now that theyre on paper? Anything attract you? Lets say you do, if not thats alright it could take some time. Put those ideas in a sentence that describes  ""the focus of your study"". In my case its trauma and media, so its the effect media can have on recovering from traumatic experiences.

6. Now take that sentence you made and make it a question. What are you answering with that question? Taking mine once more: Can popculture be used to treat various forms of trauma?

Heres the easy part if you made it this far (the lesson words the better). Answer these questions

Who: who are you going to be dealing with? People? Animals? Other organisms? What kinds? Do they have to be special in some way? (Ex. In my research i will be looking into specifically victims of emotional, mental, and physical trauma).

What: what are important key elements that are associated with your topic? Literally just list off every synonym, search word, vaguely related term you can think of. Think of it like tagging a blog post.

Where: where will this take place? What setting? A lab? In the field? Where is the field? In your grandma's basement?

When: when does it occure? On a certain day or hour or season? Is it a normal interval? Is it after a specific event? (Ex. Mine is after a traumatic experience).

Last step! Youre almost done!

What are your expectations for the research? This isnt a formal hypothesis, so dont worry about formatting. Think of it like the hypothesis's baby brother; he's really scrawny and little vague. I personally think in my topic that media can be used to help trauma patients recover. What will happen for yours?"

college,fdix1pm,t3_elmjib,1578452987.0,"Welcome to bullshitting 101! Im your horribly underqualified professor: an english major who hates literature classes!

1. When reading books of almost anything, you can get away with the 1st sentence of every paragraph (sometimes the last one in the paragraph can help clear things up if its confusing). This also works for articles, textbooks, and like everything else.

2. Graphic novel versions are often very close to the original novel! 

3. There are a bunch of modern movies that are based on old novels (dont take it word for word but they help with the jist). You just might have to dig for them. For instance: lion king is based on hamlet

4. Sparknotes is your friend when youre in a jam. Also a handy site called Shmoop which is like sparknotes but in bullet point form and with some sarcastic commentary that youd really only get if you had read the book (or, you know, a wikipedia page but theyre specific enough).

5. If you are writing essays NEVER UNDER ANY CIRSUMSTANCE CITE WIKIPEDIA. Cite the references at the bottom of wikipedia. 

6. If you need to read a journal article for whatever reason dont bother with reading the entire thing. Read the abstract and conclusion (you just saved like 50 pages of reading and essentially know the same information). You may have to go digging for a graph or something depending on what you do but thats just scroll through until you find it."
GreekMythology,fdirj75,t1_fdipka1,1578449433.0,"I cant either just look up [god] epithets. I specifically use either theoi.com or hellenistic gods (theoi is probably a better source because it is not created for religious purposes but both are cited).

Anyway, zeus' revolve around ""savior"", ""releaser [of rain]"", he had a household form meaning during some things he would be invoked along the same lines as Hestia probably because hes also the god of hospitality, ""shape changer"", ""giver of omens"", etc.

Hades i already listed what i remember. 

Poseidon is all either about earthquakes, trident, ocean, or horses

Hera badically shares all her epithets with zeus partially cuz their married and partially because she shares the majority of his domains

Demeter's epithets are all in relation to Kore (aka persephone), actually. Shes also associated with hecate because of the triple goddess (aka matron mother crone. You see that a lot in celtic mythology and basic witchcraft). 

Artemis is about archery, running, hunting, but also childbirth

Apollo is about archery, as well as uncut hair (hes seen as a boy not a man as some greek tradition had it that boys could not cut their hair until manhood). He also shares epithets with hermes as they are both seen as ambassadors for olympus

Hermes is either trickster, joy bringer, loud, or diplomatic

Dionysus is a fucked up god to the point that its just confusing without some major background and even then"

As for athena being related to Bellona she is more linked to the greek goddess enyo than to athena. Think of it as the difference between war itself and battle strategy."

GreekMythology,fdg6vct,t3_el64h1,1578382445.0,"This here is my jam and i will try my best not to go on a massive fucking tangent.

1st all the gods have epithets which is a fancy ass word for ""other names for""). Think of them kinda like a weird mix between sir and nick names. A lot of the time epithets would be used to invoke other aspects of the god(s) in question.

Ex. Hades is known as hades, altor, aidoneus, zeus khthonios, dis, and many many many others i do not remember off the top of my head. Hades means singer (technically it refers to chanting), altor is to nourish (invoking an aspect that is often associated with Kore), aidoneus (similar in meaning to Hades but is ""singing nightingale""), zeus khthonios means underworld zeus (or king of underworld) and dis is really more an epithets of the underworld because thats one of its names.

Anyway, aphrodite is equally as interesting to me! Dont get me wrong, a lot of it is associated with looks (long locks, fluttering eyes, great buttocks) as well as associated with her birth (of the sea, foam, shell, from Uranus' semen) then theres the weirder ones you wouldnt always associate with her: 
  
Krýphios- secretive, occult, hidden 

Lýkaina-
She-wolf

APATU′RIA-
That is deceitful 

AREIA- the warlike (this was how she was often depicted besides ares or in sparta)

HECAERGE- hitting a distance (artemis shares this epithet for her archery abilities)

MECHANEUS/MECHANITIS- great inventor (shared epithet with zeus and athena)

NICE′PHORUS (pronounced like Nike-forus)- victory bringing"

college,fdg57bk,t3_el6qd1,1578380481.0,"My mother has a dual theatre and developmental psychology major, meaning the normal psych major is even more useless because of how specific it is.

Almost no one will care what degree you have unless you are going into a specialized field. There is a reason so many polysci amd business degrees are flooding the market: its a generix degree. If you cant get a job you arent marketing yourself right. If you cant get a job in that specific field ask yourself if your degree level is possible for that desired field (like if you want to be a professor you cant teach with an AA) and then start getting creative. 

My mother teaches teachers (pre-k-3rd) how to use popculture and informal ways of teaching in the classroom. If your dream job doesnt exist then make it."
