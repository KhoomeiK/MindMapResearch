todayilearned,fejt475,t1_fej59t6,1579185199.0,"If you take more than a few seconds to think about it, Reparations for slavery is stupid and at it's core very racist. The majority of black people in the US have mixed blood, they have ancestors that were slaves, immigrants from Africa, Carribbean and European. How much reparations does a half black and half white get? Does a quarter black person get reparations or pay for reparations? Or are you just going to base it on how they look or DNA? There are tons of white people with slave ancestors that can claim reparations because their great great great great grandfather was a slave but look completely white. 

 What about the vast majority of whites that are descendant from European immigrants after slavery do they have to pay reparations? Think even more about it only 10% of the southern whites even owned slaves before the Civil war, should poor white families who never owned slaves have to pay reparations? As a idea it might seem like social justice but in reality you are going around and estimate the level of blackness a person may or may not have which is unbelievably racist."
