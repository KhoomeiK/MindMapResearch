I cringe every time I see a picture of someone with massive eyes or mouth, especially if it’s a adult. It’s very childish. We want to see what you actually look like to determine if your attractive or not."

unpopularopinion,fdyotl2,t3_ene0tt,1578782086.0,Both are equally abnormal and wrong so both should be dealt with accordingly. casteration is illegal for them so they should both be in jail as far as I’m concerned.

I agree it is being used to influence people though, and identity theft does occur a lot. marketing has never been easier though. Depends on how you look at things really."

depression,fdthkor,t3_en2jqu,1578716867.0,Because education is needed for a good job and a good job is needed for good money.  You don’t have to have these things but your life will get worse and you will be unemployed/poor.  So we do these things because we have to.

I need the mc meth and cocain though."

How can we help online if we don’t know what’s wrong? They just need to speak to people irl I guess or see a doc. Most posts are just whining or vents which are pointless. It’s over petty stuff as well like breakups most of the time, fair enough if you lost your job it’s more understandable."

depression,fdevmdh,t3_ekvkzq,1578347532.0,The fact she did a 180 and ghosted you with no explanation shows how little she cares. You are a second option and she comes back to you then darts off to the next opportunity that arises. I would cut her off completely and look for other girls. Most people are not capable of this though.  stopping pursuing someone you care about must be hard. I would talk to someone about your feelings.

depression,fdetrou,t1_fdesp8a,1578346433.0,I agree walking sucks when it’s cold.  If they care there should be no problem helping you out though. Why do you think people will pity you? It’s none of their concern. If someone does not know you then you should not care about what they think about you as what they think has no impact on your life.

I only have a short commute to college though. I’m driving only if necessary. I’ll probably just get a bicycle. Why do you feel ashamed for asking for a ride? I do not understand.
