politics,ffb2qv5,t3_esigem,1579750313.0,"Assumption is that they care.   The senate knows what a piece of shit Trump is, they just don't care.  They know that their base isn't going to be moved and they know that the masses that /follow/ them only listen to the filter Fox provides.  Nothing to be concerned about.  Just pretend to be upset for the Fox news to display the proper soundbites, rinse and repeat.  To be honest, I'm about done with politics.  All this evidence is so damning but it really doesn't matter since a bunch of racist, misogynistic, bible licking, dick bags have all but strong armed the Democrats.  If one of those fucking hickabillies from the midwest/south actually read the evidence and put a cat litter scoop of thought into any of this, this is a fucking no brainer.  Fuck you Trumplicans and fuck you Trump.   I can't wait until you die so I can come piss on your graves.  </submit>"

TwoXChromosomes,fdky805,t3_eluwox,1578513611.0,I was in your shoes 18 years ago.    Abortion will always be a subject that General Practitioners should never express their opinion about but it just depends on the type of person the doctor is.   Just go to PP and only respond (in the future) to that abortion question if you have medical complications from it or you feel it's pertinent.
