You don't, fundamentally, understand what a lynch mob is if you think Reddit is one. You use buzz words without knowing their meaning because you think it will make you seem edgy.

Real quick, is it propaganda if it's a literal picture of them together coupled with provable quotes?

politics,fdmt3mz,t1_fdl830g,1578564456.0,">The common theme is that people generally vote based on indoctrination not education.

That's silly, I'll explain why.

It is entirely based on education, and converting small town kids into big city liberals. It happens to so many people who go to college, and if we had an even split where you stayed the same political party as your parents, we'd not see so many stories of people switching. 

Couple that with more educated people having less children and tending to be more liberal, and by your common theme, republicans would straight outnumber democrats through birth rate alone.

Every generation down from boomer to gen z have gotten more and more democratic leaning, as our relative education has increased. 

Now wait, you say, I said indoctrination, which can happen at universities, right?

Sure, and I'm sure it does. But unless you are prepared to say that every major university in the country and near every professor is in a liberal cabal to turn kids blue.

I've seen that argument made, but it's sad to see that much delusion in folks.
