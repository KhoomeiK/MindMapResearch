**Commenter**: I don't even eat cereal anymore [*laughing face*] I stick to two meals a day, lunch and dinner, to maintain a healthy weight. I don't feel deprived. With the modern diet, you end up consuming more than the recommended number of calories per day anyways.

**Three things Jesus' love will never do**

[*Image of Rick Astley fused with Jesus*]

**Three things the grace and love of God will never do**: Will never leave you broken-hearted (Psalm 147:3). Will never reject you (John 6:37). Will never leave you nor forsake you (Hebrews 13:5)

So basically, Jesus is never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down, never gonna run around and desert you.

**Anthony**: Well I was having a lot of sex in school and that really threw me off. I must have fingerbanged fourteen girls by the time I got to my sophomore year in high school.
