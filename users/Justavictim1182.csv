You are giving up consistancy for a narrow combo that takes 3 turns to set up and is easily interacted with. I am super happy with my scales list. I play 21 lands and only 1 card over 3 cmc. It just goes under opponents consistently. My only challenge is Phoenix but I am testing more grave hate for it in the board.

PioneerMTG,fei6l79,t1_fei5h1n,1579131421.0,"In all honesty, if we are protecting the combo, [[Blossoming Defense]] is probably a better choice.

PioneerMTG,fei5h1n,t1_fegjuys,1579130710.0,"That's fair. It does give flexibility in its modal design but assuming you run GBw.... what are you taking out in its place? I can justify any of those creatures above. They give alternative wincons that close the game if the combo fails. They also turn on Heliod's devotion. Command doesn't. I will put together my list tonight splashing white because I am playing BG Scales now very successfully and I can tell you the list is very tight. I play 21 lands. That itself is a strain on getting right color combinations to be able to meet curves. My deck also current tops out at exactly 1 spell over 3 CMC, a 1 of [[Vivien, Arkbow Ranger]]. I would not meddle too much with it but I could see [[Hangarback Walker]] or even [[Stonecoil Serpent]] come out for a few white creature. I would need to playtest too. The list I am running has been very successful against every deck topping the meta except Phoenix decks, which grind it out game 1 typically and become 50/50 game 2 and 3"

PioneerMTG,feefjg6,t1_feeaomr,1579032716.0,"Removing black is a mistake. That is the first issue. You literally only need one card in White: Heliod. What does white offer you that black does not fulfill? The only card 3 cards in a GW list I could consider playing is [[Lantern Scout]], [[Abzan Battle Priest]], and Archangel of Thune. 

Black gives you a lot more benefit that white. It gives you the best removal in format. It gives you hand disruption to get rid of things that could stop your combo. It gives life link creatures like [[Gifted Aetherborn]] which can help speed up the combo."
PioneerMTG,fee9g2t,t3_eom5mq,1579029141.0,"The big thing you neglected it twofold: 1) Ballista is an artifact. Which turns on more removal. And 2) you want balista to be at least 3 counters. If at 2 and you remove a counter to shoot, I can play spot removal and it goes nowhere for you. Now you have wasted 3 turns. If at 3, you have to uses 2 pieces of spot removal (tall task) to stop the combo. 

You mention decks here but fail to mention the obvious one: Hardened Scales. Scales has a solid meta share and just had 2 top 16 finishes in Columbus. That GB list could easily altered to accommodate Heliod or other pieces like [[Archangel of Thune]] into that list. This also give you options depending on build to play mana dorks to accelerate the combo. 

Pioneer while only 6 years worth of sets has plenty of interaction for a 2 piece combo that takes 3 turns to set up."

2) Playing less than 3 Arcanist is a mistake. The card serves as reach late game and can steal games for you.

PioneerMTG,fddn0ba,t1_fddfayl,1578318258.0,"I think that cutting Black is a mistake. The deck as constructed will rely too much on the combo. As others have stated, Evolution does not work the way you want it. The X costed creatures count as 0 so tutoring for 2 CMC does you nothing. I would do more to diversify the creatures as well. Going 20 artifact creatures is asking for [[Vandalblast]] to ruin your day. White is good creature to tool box. [Lantern Scout]] is a good fit. Because you are currently on 24 land, some number of [[Archangel of Thune]] would give you another win con.

I would go Abzan with the build. As I said cutting black is a huge mistake. If you are going more for a combo kill, [[Thoughtseize]] and even [[Duress]] protect your game plan. [[Abrupt Decay]] and [[Fatal Push]] are probably the best removal in a deck like this that is looking to win t5ish. I know a lot of people are on [[Assassin's Trophy]] but you should be shooting to win by t5 or 6. Decay kills most of what you need to keep your combo active."
