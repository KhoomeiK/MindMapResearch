SquaredCircle,ffbgod3,t3_esnve2,1579764478.0,"Daniels is amazing. Met him a couple times at TNA shows years ago, and he was as hilarious and quick-witted as you'd expect. 

I went to a TNA house show at a pretty small venue in a small town in North Georgia where he was on the card. During his tag match, a girl about 12 or 13 years old in the audience talked shit loudly to him. Once his opponent was down, he had an amazing back and forth trash talk with her that is still one of my favorite moments I've seen live."

Trump literally campaigned on ""lock her up"". She has been investigated multiple times, including hours of questions from Republicans on Benghazi. No charges filed against her. GOP controlled all three branches of government for two years, yet she was somehow protected during that? What a joke."
