Just a sidenote, you don't need to believe that Jesus never existed in order to see that Christianity is false. 

I'm an agnostic atheist and I believe that there most likely was a person who went by the name of Yeshua of Nazareth at some point, who was trialed for blasphemy and then executed by roman authorities. History is full of such examples of religious ""justice"", with people being killed for their beliefs and idolized/worshiped by their close followers. 

Most religious narratives and legends are founded by (or involve) real people and feature real geographic locations, with supernatural elements getting added to the stories as they spread over time. Stories of virgin births, healings, resurrections, etc were quite common in ancient Middle Eastern narratives, so it's no surprise that they were eventually tacked-on to Jesus long after his death."

Even if evidence were presented? Because you're making it sound like an agnostic is open to evidence, while an atheist rejects evidence. I think most atheists would disagree with that notion.

A better definition for both is that atheism is a stance on belief, while agnosticism is a stance on knowledge. 

Theism = I believe

Atheism = I don't believe 

Gnostic = I know for certain

Agnostic = I don't know for certain

So for example, an agnostic theist might say ""I believe, but I don't know for certain""."

But they fundamentally disagree on their goal/intent and how truth is defined. 

In Creationism, truth comes from the Bible (because it is God's literal word). For Creationists the truth has already been revealed in the Bible, and so the Bible is their sole measuring stick for what constitutes as truth. The intent of Creationism is to interpret all data to fit the Bible, and discard data that cannot be interpreted to fit the Bible. This is an entirely religious practice done for religious purposes, with spiritual salvation in mind.  

Science doesn't even remotely share that intent/goal, and it has a *completely* different method for defining & investigating truth. In science there is no concept of revealed truth and the sole intent is to use a process of investigation to learn more about the natural universe. 

As far as I'm concerned, intent is key here. The rest is semantics in comparison.

When it comes to interpreting scientific data, Creationism only rears it's head when that data throws Biblical truth into question (i.e. throws their religion into question).

But what is happening in Western society over the last ~50 years is completely different. Christianity is fading on it's own without being forced out.  In fact it's fading *despite* efforts from Christian institutions to keep it around. People are losing faith on a personal level.

Churches aren't closing because a tyrannical government is demolishing them, but because they are empty. Pastors aren't declining due to being imprisoned/killed for their faith, but because almost nobody is interested in priesthood. 

This is very different than what happened under Stalin, or what is currently happening in China. It's important to understand this.

Of course atheism isn't a *basis* for anything. Atheism is simply a personal non-belief in God i.e. a response to a single claim. Of course it contains no teachings, no practices, no laws, etc and therefore can't serve as a basis. It's as nonsensical as saying ""non-golfing is a terrible basis for society"".

Not quite. God can also reach out to those who *don't* seek him, including people who have put in zero effort for ""spiritual enlightenment"". Even the Bible has examples of God giving prophetic visions and divine knowledge to people who barely spent any effort pursuing him. There is no shortage of people who have had a hard life (e.g. drug addicts, criminals, etc) who claim to have suddenly recieved a barrage of spiritual experiences by Jesus and suddenly found the light. Plenty of testimonies like that. No effort or diligence required.

Inversely, Christians can spend *decades* (sometimes their entire life) pursuing God but have no divine experiences of the sort that you describe. But in that case you can probably claim that they just didn't try hard enough, and their efforts weren't enough. Bad luck for them I guess.


> truly is like being Neo in The Matrix; being awakened to the true nature of reality that is hidden from us: that the world around us is largely an artificial construct full of meaningless distractions which get in the way of us finding the Truth.

This analogy can easily be reversed. E.g. People who have felt trapped by religion for their entire life (being raised into a religion from childhood), and eventually wake up to realize it's just an artificial manmade construct to keep them subservient and under control (exactly what the Matrix was built for).

Christianity,ff1wo2b,t1_ff0c253,1579487881.0,"> But of course, all this is pointless to describe to you because you'll just dismiss it as being delusional or all a lie.

I think what you're describing is possible. There is a possibility that you may not be delusional, and everything you're describing may have occurred. That possibility is astronomically unlikely and contrary to everything all my knowledge & experiences, but still possible. 

However I can't believe it based on the possibility alone. Extraordinary claims require extraordinarily strong evidence, and everyone has to make a judgement-call based on the information they are being presented. While you believe that your information has come first-hand, any agnostic/atheist listening to you is being given a second hand account to which they can't even remotely relate to. In fact they don't even know how it's possible - they'll just have to take your word for it. They may also have heard supernatural accounts from people from other religions as well. So from their perspective, the conclusion is relatively straightforward - all gods & religions are *most likely* manmade. Not 100% certain, but most likely. 

There is a good reason why in every theist vs atheist debate, both parties do their best to avoid bringing up anecdotal experience as evidence/information. It undermines the whole point of a debate if one party declares ""well I personally have access to special information that you don't!"", which is apparently what you keep doing every time you debate an atheist. In any debate, making such a declaration doesn't score the theist any points whatsoever. In fact it has the opposite effect and hints that the theist has simply run out of arguments (or had no argument to begin with)."

Snoke was killed in an extremely dumb way (god-tier force user dies to a basic force trick?), so it would have made sense if Snoke just faked dying to test Kylo and see how he would perform as Supreme Leader.

What for? There is no point pretending that you're ""open minded"" to information that conflicts with your worldview. You have already assumed that everything that conflicts with your worldview = evil spirits, false prophets, fallen angels, etc who are trying to deceive you.

Why even have a debate with that mindset? No matter what your opponent says, you have already assumed that demons and evil spirits are responsible. You have already assumed that any religion/worldview that *doesn't* align your own is simply the work of fallen angels, and nothing your opponent says will ever change your outlook on that. 

In fact the *better* the evidence/reasoning they bring you, the more you will assume that it's just an extra-powerful evil spirit trying to deceive you. So it's in your opponents' best interests to simply not bother trying to debate you. The moment they realize what sort of person they are dealing with, they will make their excuses and leave. They realize that there is no debate to be had.

Free will is completely irrelevant to this topic because we didn't choose to be here. We didn't choose to be created and we didn't choose our capacity.
