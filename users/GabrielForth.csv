One night I took my wife into the hospital as she was having bad heart palpitations. I didn't need to worry about which hospital, I just drove to the closest.

HermitCraft,fcjmruk,t1_fcjmi7x,1577694255.0,"They convert a constant redstone signal into a single redstone pulse.

A rising edge monostable generates the pulse when the signal first activates.

A falling edge monostable generates the pulse when the signal is deactivated.


So imagine a lever connected to a redstone lamp. The lever when it's on will give a constant signal so when the lever is on the lamp will be on and when it's off then the lamp will be off.

If you insert a REMC in between the lever and lamp, then when the lever is turned on the lamp will flash and then remain off, when the lever is turned off nothing will happen.

If you used a FEMC then when you turn the lever on nothing will happen, but when you switch it off the lamp will flash and then remain off."
