AssassinsCreedOdyssey,ffa4ohx,t1_ffa4gmw,1579727818.0,Ahh gotcha.
AssassinsCreedOdyssey,ffa3bjp,t3_esg97p,1579727046.0,I just dont understand the point....
laptops,ff9xtwl,t3_esfzus,1579723841.0,"Looks like the beginning of hardware failure, especially since it happens as your machine is bluescreening"
bloodborne,ff9mgzn,t3_esa9bl,1579716082.0,Fire paper is your friend
Windows10,ff9lusb,t3_es8ku7,1579715719.0,Get rid of it
StarWarsFallenOrder,ff9jtqb,t1_ff9er0i,1579714526.0,Was wondering the same thing
StarWarsFallenOrder,ff95865,t1_ff8j6do,1579705135.0,"Well, you did have the orange saber long before anyone else as well as the other skins, only because you paid for the game before it came out.  Not like you paid extra for them.  So not sure what your point is here."
StarWarsFallenOrder,ff92omz,t1_ff8ihwp,1579703366.0,Speak for yourself.  I have had weird glitches here and there but never to the point of where it was even close to not being unplayable.  I have gone through it twice now.
StarWarsFallenOrder,ff666qg,t3_erhh7g,1579620089.0,"Looks decent, but you can't really see much.  Way to dark."
aww,feundhi,t3_eqh7yt,1579388210.0,He looks extremely nervous

food,feuhtar,t3_eq7bqi,1579386647.0,Looks fantastic except for that lettuce. Get that off of there lol
laptops,feuec8c,t1_feucdm9,1579385709.0,Possibly. At any rate my guess is the screw holes are stripped not allowing the threads to catch and release the screw
laptops,feubfs5,t1_feu9eev,1579384945.0,"Not sure I agree with that. Things are secured with screws for a reason, so they can be separated when there is a need to service them.  If they didn't want that piece to come off, then they would solder it"
AskReddit,feu9wxv,t3_eqjrvi,1579384603.0,Bloodborne
bloodborne,feu5zti,t3_eqel2o,1579383407.0,"You just have to get passed that learning curve. Once you start getting a rhythm it gets much, much better.  Would recommend starting out with the hunters axe."
aww,feu2zzr,t3_eqf4hy,1579382657.0,Is it force sensitive?
GamingLaptops,fenqfck,t1_femivwi,1579289255.0,Not true.  my yoga C940 IPS 4k has zero lightbleed.
bloodborne,fenj6uh,t3_eq0n1c,1579285837.0,"Mine has to be Maria.  Not the toughest, but it feels the most like a true hunter vs. hunter fight and her moveset is just badass."

StarWarsFallenOrder,fen7eeg,t1_feli0n6,1579278602.0,"I hear ya.  I personally really enjoyed it, didnt take issue with most of the items on your list.  My main complaint is how short it was and that they are refusing to add any DLC content.  Makes me feel like I didnt get my $60 worth.  I am going through it again on grand master, which is fun but isn't the same as the first time."
LogitechG,femyrb9,t1_feml373,1579273041.0,And probably part of the 5% of people that unfortunately had an issue.

laptops,fekto9h,t1_fektjrx,1579207377.0,I am fine. I just make sure people don't get bad information
laptops,fektajn,t1_fekt3v2,1579207152.0,"No, it is about you incorrectly telling people that people only sell laptops when they have issues. That is just simply false"
laptops,fekoivu,t1_feklntg,1579204338.0,You really that naive to think that people only sell laptops because they have problems?
laptops,fekk7yx,t1_feki738,1579201781.0,"Wrong. People can also sell them because they want something different, they want an upgrade, they need to liquidate assets, the laptop doesn't meet their needs.  I can go all day."
laptops,fekhm1q,t1_fekeuwu,1579200215.0,"I agree that looking at a machine that old is probably not the best idea, but not looking at used in general is bad advice."
laptops,fekhe93,t1_fejzfm7,1579200087.0,"Backlight bleed is a common issue across all laptop and monitor manufacturers, it is certainly not specific to Lenovo.  My experience with Lenovo displays actually has been nothing but great."
laptops,fejxczk,t3_epgh4m,1579188013.0,"I wouldnt even mess with it, take it back for an exchange.  No reason you should have to troubleshoot this a day after you get it, and even if you get it up and running there is a good chance it will do the same thing in the future."
laptops,fejsgar,t1_fejs33d,1579184729.0,Hmm.  I have the C940 IPS 4k and I have pretty much zero lightbleed.  The only thing I have is some very minor IPS glow.
aww,fejsdbn,t3_eph3kv,1579184670.0,Great friends until he tries to pet him.
bloodborne,fejrbeb,t1_fej5ska,1579183898.0,"Yeah, it took us a few tries but we did win it. I killed the hunter and then helped him finish off Amelia"
laptops,fejr7zv,t3_epcgvf,1579183829.0,What kind of display is it? IPS? TN? 1080? 4k?
bloodborne,fejqqnp,t1_fejoha5,1579183471.0,We actually won too. We were on voice so that helped. I killed the hunter while he kept Amelia occupied. Then we tag teamed Amelia.
thedivision,feii1gi,t1_feifnlv,1579139005.0,Gotcha
StarWarsFallenOrder,feiby1a,t3_elkk4r,1579134922.0,"Yeah, your friend is wrong lol"

StarWarsFallenOrder,feheohz,t1_fehem1i,1579114990.0,Oh no shit? Nice! Did they give a date on when the update is coming?
StarWarsFallenOrder,fehdczi,t1_fehdb0y,1579114228.0,Lol nice
StarWarsFallenOrder,fehcp7f,t1_fe44s2k,1579113847.0,He wants the orange saber color...
StarWarsFallenOrder,fehcgcp,t3_eorow6,1579113707.0,I am guessing because of the auto deflect force ability?
StarWarsFallenOrder,fehcb2y,t3_eoz4w4,1579113619.0,"Same experience. The tree is my favorite area in the game easily.  Currently going through it on grand master.  A bit disappointed there isn't more though.  Despite the fact that is is a very fun game, I still feel a bit cheated due to how short it is and they are not adding anything to it."
thedivision,fehbt0t,t1_feha3bq,1579113323.0,Put 10 assault rifles in to it like you can in the DZ.
thedivision,fegxpsn,t3_ep1p9s,1579104863.0,Now trying fitting 10 ARs in it.
LogitechG,fegvzo4,t1_fegrapi,1579103771.0,My guess is it is software related. The keys are obviously RGB capable.
LogitechG,fegnuts,t1_fefnkmx,1579098283.0,Same.

Lenovo,featahq,t1_feasxs3,1578952024.0,You should be able to get all of the drivers and software from lenovo.com
Lenovo,feas3ke,t3_eoan2t,1578951749.0,"Havent had my c940 for long, but havent ran into this.  It sounds like a driver issue to me.  Maybe try a clean install of Windows."
laptops,feaq2tz,t1_feakdy3,1578951247.0,Well obviously
HomeNetworking,fe9rhlk,t1_fe9dqxz,1578940876.0,"I have an AX router, and wifi6 on my phone as well as my laptop and the difference is significant.  It is obviously backwards compatible with wifi AC so not sure why you are hating on it.  The industry is going that way.  Pretty much all phones made in 2020 will be wifi 6.  Almost everything will be for that matter."
laptops,fe9radn,t1_fe9ksia,1578940815.0,"Formatting the primary partition will do nothing to a recovery partition.  He can format the primary partition, and install a clean copy of windows on it without touching any other partitions.  So you might want to get your facts straight."

laptops,fe95xiv,t1_fe3k8sp,1578934617.0,Not all of them are.
laptops,fe95rec,t3_enq5k3,1578934547.0,I would go for the C940 personally.

StarWarsFallenOrder,fe8czyx,t1_fe7ss6v,1578924900.0,It came with a preorder of the game
laptops,fe5kw6e,t1_fe5kgwj,1578870732.0,Start it completely over. Format the drive and start again
pcmasterrace,fe46lvc,t3_enocdv,1578856240.0,Not sure what you would do with a second gen i5 anyway tbh. Need something to browse the net and that's it?
laptops,fe3pehq,t3_enn4b0,1578851623.0,"If that doesn't work, full format and reinstall of windows"
Windows10,fe3omta,t3_enmcbs,1578851390.0,Does your machine support bluetooth? If so use that and forget about the reciever
laptops,fe3nufv,t3_ennuc0,1578851180.0,Depends on if the problem is hardware or software. More than likely it is hardware and the laptop is thermal throttling. Are you watching your cpu temps as you play?
bloodborne,fe3nlob,t3_enloms,1578851061.0,Fought orphan hundreds of times and that has never happened to me
bloodborne,fe3e6d5,t1_fe3dnhj,1578848444.0,Gotcha.  The letter will be very weak without fairly high bloodtinge. I would make another build focused around bloodtinge
bloodborne,fe3dhob,t3_enpq80,1578848324.0,I don't believe he even meets the requirements to use it with 0 bloodtinge?
laptops,fe3cc7l,t3_enotnw,1578848012.0,It should be able to pick up where it left off. What is it doing when you power it on? Is it posting?
bloodborne,fe3brf8,t3_enov6v,1578847864.0,Parrying is your friend with him
StarWarsFallenOrder,fe2ful7,t3_enf159,1578837911.0,"You may want to indicate there are spoilers in your title. 

I completely agree about the holocron.... the entire point of the story was to retrieve it, just for him to destroy it in a split second decision? Why even go after it to begin with then and instead just go after the empire? 

Also, as much as I enjoyed the game, and very disappointed about its length and that they are no planning on adding anything else. Feel fairly cheated actually."
laptops,fdzc200,t1_fdzbfmw,1578788647.0,"That is tough to answer. Overall I have had a good experience with ebay, and if someone does try to rip you off you can contact them and they will make it right. I would look at ebay"
