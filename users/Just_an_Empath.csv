But don't listen to me. Since you've brought the Gregorian calendar up, let me quote something from Wikipedia.

  
""The **year zero** does not exist in the Anno Domini (AD) system commonly used to number years in the Gregorian calendar and in its predecessor, the Julian calendar. In this system, the year 1 BC is followed by AD 1."""

What you were obviously going to say is that the first millenium was from 1-999 which would be wrong as that is only 999 years.  
First millenium: 1-1000  
Second millenium: 1001-2000  
Third millenium: 2001-3000

Previous decade: 2001-2010
