VRGaming,fddbwh7,t1_fddaz9u,1578304706.0,Thank you for the quick and through explanation!
aww,fdd3icy,t3_ekkfe7,1578293276.0,You raised him right.
borderlands3,fd7zk9m,t3_ej09vk,1578212231.0,"Four quick questions:

Having played all four characters, I have found each seems to hit their stride at different levels.  When do Amara and Zane start getting good, and with what build?

Is it me, or is the Mind Killer from Mouthpiece far too good?  9*17 is 153 damage and it's all in ONE clump.  I two shot level 17s with a shotgun I got at level 8.

Is there a list of what legendary weapons drop from what mobs, and what's good for the level?

When should I do Moxxi's heist on normal?  I've got characters ranging from 20 to 12."
