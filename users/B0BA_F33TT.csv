\*The Voice of Europe

***Analysis / Bias***

*In review, Voice of Europe reports stories from European media and frames and spins them in a misleading way that always turns out negative for immigrants and the European Union:* [*“Almost 98% of gang rapists in Sweden have a migrant background”*](https://voiceofeurope.com/2018/03/almost-98-of-gang-rapists-in-sweden-have-a-migrant-background/)*,* [*“Sweden reports highest number of murders in fifteen years*](https://voiceofeurope.com/2018/03/sweden-reports-highest-number-of-murders-in-fifteen-years/)*” Voice of Europe also has a* [*poor track record*](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/german-soap-opera-muslim/) *with fact checkers.*

*Voice of Europe’s stories consist of sensational click bait headlines and focus on a variety of topics that are mostly anti-immigrant with emotionally loaded headlines and content such as* [*“Swedish student suspended for telling the truth about migrant sex crimes.“*](https://voiceofeurope.com/2018/03/swedish-student-suspended-for-telling-the-truth-about-migrant-sex-crimes/)  *Voice of Europe frequently uses factually mixed sources such as* [*Breitbart*](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/)*,* [*Daily Mail*](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/)*,* [*Gatestone Institute*](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/gatestone-institute/)*, and* [*Sputnik News.*](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sputnik-news/)

*Overall, this site is Questionable due to extreme right wing bias, promotion of propaganda, conspiracy theories and poor sourcing. (M Huitsing 4/8/2018) Updated (10/24/2018)*"
