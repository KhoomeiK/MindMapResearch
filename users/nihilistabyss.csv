Greyhounds,ff61akt,t3_ersjnb,1579616578.0,"My hound does this too! We call it ""puffy lips"" üòÇ"
SkincareAddiction,fegmbsa,t1_fefwj6q,1579097114.0,What moisturizer and sunscreen do you use?
fatlogic,fdgurvk,t1_fdgmixq,1578408841.0,This made me laugh out loud.
fatlogic,fdgmska,t3_el8kky,1578402548.0,"Idk about you guys but in my experience the #roadlesstravelled is the road lined with discipline, consistency and hard work to stay healthy and fit."
fatlogic,fddtpql,t1_fddki1i,1578323732.0,"It's scary how many times I've seen the statement ""we are born fat and can't do anything to change it."" It makes my blood boil when they compare obesity to race/sexual orientation (things people are still actively discriminated against and even killed for)."
fatlogic,fddomvo,t1_fddla4k,1578319706.0,"But a lifestyle change IS a diet, and don't even think about mentioning health because that's a social construct and LALALA I can't hear you."
SkincareAddiction,fd9226u,t1_fd8tbu8,1578227145.0,I've been using the water bank eye gel for years. Absolutely love it. So moisturizing.

fatlogic,fcyhbvo,t1_fcyfo79,1578080142.0,"Oh silly me. Henceforth health shall only be referred to as ""health."""
fatlogic,fcygycx,t3_ejicib,1578079942.0,"I absolutely despised my body from puberty until a couple years ago (I'm 28 and I've never been fat). That was absolutely in part due to the patriarchy and the way women were portrayed in the media etc. It sucked. Sometimes I even wished I could develop an eating disorder because at least then I would be thin. But GUESS WHAT, I have never had an eating disorder. It is a goddamn mental illness not a common cold with the viruses floating around in the form of diet pill ads."
fatlogic,fcyeap6,t3_ejil8p,1578078830.0,So doing drugs is not unhealthy!?
fatlogic,fcy57cg,t3_ejh2md,1578075000.0,Do they know that they're also still fat if they don't tell us about it?
antiMLM,fcy0g0e,t3_ejf0o8,1578072982.0,Never heard of anyone going broke over a few boxes of cookies ü§¶
childfree,fcuofkc,t1_fcuasqo,1577985297.0,Yep. That was my childhood. Parents had religious beliefs that prevented them from ever getting divorced. It was pretty horrible.
fatlogic,fc3ljpf,t1_fc3dazp,1577392556.0,100% not Alison Brie
fatlogic,fbgv4wv,t1_fbdx652,1576859294.0,Yeah that line really got me. What the fuck.
