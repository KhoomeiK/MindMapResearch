The100,ffefy3a,t3_et4v1e,1579846503.0,I really like Murven but sadly I don't think they will happen :( I don't really see Murphy and Emori breaking up maybe if they would have done it after the 6 year time jump but now it doesn't seem realistic

The100,feacnjp,t3_eo8vbv,1578947052.0,"Wow I didn't even remember that line but it's really good! It's not a quote that I relate to but I really like Jasper's ""they sent us down to see if the ground is survivable but from what I've seen it's not"" because it really shows what the series is about. Sometimes being alive isn't enough."

OUTFITS,fdkg8nd,t1_fdkfz67,1578503221.0,I don't think you should be nervous because it's a beautiful dress and it's not too much so you could wear it to a not so elegant or fancy place too😁

The100,fddpoq0,t1_fdbxhg1,1578320605.0,I think Echo being with a guy who is not entirely in love with her is worse than her getting her heart broken by Bellamy and having a chance to find someone who loves her as much as she deserves to be loved.
bichonfrise,fdbsiih,t3_ekg541,1578261300.0,"Just reading these comments made me cry so hard I can't even describe it. I'm so sorry for your loss. I hope it gets better and I know it will because, even if it's a total cliché, with time everything gets easier. Of course you won't forget about him but after you can accept the fact that he is gone, you will only remember the good things about him, for example the little things he did to make you laugh or just simple things like how cute he was when he was sleeping. It takes a lot of time to accept this but remember you were his whole life and you will definetely meet him in the afterlife! Keep going and everything will get better! ❤️"
bichonfrise,fdbrgyl,t3_ekf2eo,1578260852.0,He looks like a model! 😀😍

htgawm,fc3pky6,t3_efzlfs,1577395445.0,"I definetely think that the show will end in a depressing way. After Asher got killed it wouldn't be fair for the others to live a happy life.
Though I really wanted a happy ending for Michaela and Asher so I'm really sad for them :("
htgawm,fc3pf0y,t1_fc3lu8d,1577395327.0,Well I think Oliver thinks he really killed Asher and he can't live with himself because of that. He was in shock that maybe he was the one who killed Asher (who was a really good friend of his) and that's why he confessed. But I think  the others(Bonnie?) will help him and prove that he is innocent.
The100,fc04dyp,t3_efbj7l,1577278014.0,My favorite seasons are 4 and 6 so for me it just gets better
