dementia,fdxp2sq,t3_ena3rg,1578771397.0,Your priorities are changed. You have to take care of yourself and your babies. This should be a happy time for you. The stress shouldn't be on your shoulders. Don't feel guilty.

MichaelJackson,fdp44c0,t1_fdoccc5,1578619545.0,They must be because there's lots of bands or famous people I don't care for but I wouldn't go out of my way to find their fans and start a verbal war...except for maybe Oprah but that was deserved.
MichaelJackson,fdp3h4b,t3_emg17l,1578619108.0,Is it easy to put on and tighten? Are they originally used for fractures? I used to think I was the coolest kid when I had black boots with buckles on them. I should try to find some.
Botchedsurgeries,fdo28p2,t3_embrv1,1578597551.0,"I was going to say that one girl looked ""familiar"" but I guess that's just the outcome of these procedures where everyone ends up looking like a carbon copy. It's so strange."

MichaelJackson,fdnkezt,t3_elyr8a,1578587655.0,I love how he speaks in a clear and non bullshitting way. If more haters would listen maybe they would understand what we know.
ottawa,fdnk3bk,t3_ema2s6,1578587461.0,Hearing all the CBC interviews yesterday was heartbreaking. I feel for anyone who lost loved ones. Knowing babies were on board is just immensely sad.

MichaelJackson,fcxnot3,t1_fcwwc5k,1578067265.0,I think it was the soft voice
MichaelJackson,fcwdjx9,t3_ej5yrp,1578022932.0,I don't really remember the backlash as people at my school always made fun of me being a fan (except for maybe two kids) so I kept my fanaticism to myself. I just remember people thinking he was gay way back in the 80's. I can remember MJ even then saying not to buy the magazines as they were all lies but if there was a magazine or paper with his face on it you bet I'd buy it. I'm 41 now.

AskReddit,fcw1w64,t1_fcu6456,1578015230.0,I've heard that illegal drugs run rampant in that field (probably due to the pace of work and late night hours in some cases).
ottawa,fcw1lkl,t3_ej76xz,1578015040.0,I no longer live in Ottawa but it was a great place to enjoy the multiple music festivals in the summer. My other favourite place to go for a movie night was at the Bytowne to see things not shown in the big movie cineplexes.  Depending where you are working and such you will likely encounter hockey fans and maybe you'll be able to catch a ride partway with them. From downtown the bus really scoots quickly to the arena. Bus also gets you out of there faster than those with cars. It's always been a zoo heading back Eastbound from the Sens games (and any concerts).
ottawa,fcw0x98,t1_fcvx6a1,1578014594.0,It's hardly been winter yet!
MichaelJackson,fcvlxxv,t3_ej4kw9,1578004939.0,This is great news! Fans were predicting the project would take 2 or more years to see it finished.

AskReddit,fcrdonb,t3_eigp35,1577900430.0,A child said this to me years ago. I still hold a grudge.
unpopularopinion,fcodyki,t3_ei7jrh,1577829905.0,I just find putting on a front annoying and unnecessary. It's taking on someone else's persona. I truly love when people can be their authentic selves.

Anticonsumption,fco3lzl,t3_ehxui9,1577823439.0,I volunteer at my library and as a bonus I can order books. I hardly reread anything unless it's a reference book. Anyone can request a book and DVDs but most people don't know that. The library is wildly underutilized.
dadswhodidnotwantpets,fcnqy4r,t3_ei279i,1577816769.0,"I was friends with someone who was allergic to dogs (saliva) and had to give up his new Italian Greyhound puppy after a few weeks. Fast forward 15+ years he and his husband decided to get another and from what I remember he went to a doctor and got some kind of injection(s) to offset or ""cure"" his allergy. Seems to have worked for him. Perhaps people allergic to cats can also have a cure."
MichaelJackson,fcnqbts,t3_ei3zjb,1577816428.0,Here's to 2020 and maybe a future where we can just go back to being fans and enjoy him for who he was
Anticonsumption,fck5ivo,t1_fcjq639,1577717186.0,Yes if it's acrylic or similar synthetic it's cheap. I see people stamping on brand names on cheap fabric more often than not.
MichaelJackson,fci34zc,t1_fchtpel,1577657191.0,Wow I never knew any of this. I've always admired her. Saw her once in a coffee shop in Reykjavik.
80s,fcho0e7,t3_eh84bl,1577652256.0,Blocked in Canada too. I loved this show as a kid. I imagine driving a Tesla might be close to this.

MichaelJackson,fc65fqy,t1_fc64bqh,1577472691.0,I was in R/Documentaries the other day and reading responses there was a lot better than I anticipated. They were covering the movie Innocence  (there have been a string of anti Leaving Neverland projects that I haven't seen them all). 20K were talking about it when I was there so that's not nothing.
Botchedsurgeries,fc5xtct,t3_egcnba,1577468137.0,Gosh so sad. Wish any girls easily influenced by this person and her family would find some other interesting people to follow.
MichaelJackson,fc5xcb1,t1_fc5uboa,1577467867.0,From what I've gathered the people on here are less easily influenced by mainstream media and more open to learning.
MichaelJackson,fc3zoox,t1_fc3tkfn,1577402797.0,Is this hard to find? I don't wear perfume anymore since I have a bird but would be curious to smell it.
MichaelJackson,fc3tugm,t3_efz593,1577398480.0,I'm fairly new to Reddit...is it normal to not be able to comment on a post when it's a few months old?

AskReddit,fbyhx4c,t1_fbydotd,1577217322.0,Maybe that's the windy path you were meant to take and you'll find your way yet. Just my intuition.

ottawa,fby8lde,t3_ef22rc,1577210728.0,Having had my first real ER experience (North Bay) I was told that Fridays to Sunday are the worst time to go in. Monday - Thursday go in the morning for around 6am/7am for the shift change. My wait time ended up being 7 hours.
