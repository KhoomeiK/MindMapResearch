I don't know the exact specifics of the law (just an armchair commentator), but the basics are that if you can be seen from a public area, you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Again, this is how paparazzi make their money - they sell photos taken from public areas (often with really good lenses), not 'gotcha' cameras in private areas.

&#x200B;

Your hypothetical about ""what if the photos are used for harassment"" is dealt with by dealing with the ""harassment"" part rather than guessing at someone's reason for taking the photo. Harassment can be much more clearly identified than motives for public photography."

You're conflating two different concepts here - 'privacy' private, and 'not owned by the government' private. Your front yard is private property, but it's not private; there is no expectation of privacy there should someone take a photo of it or you in it.

This is how paparazzi make their bread and butter."

australia,fdpsfiz,t1_fdpqya9,1578638690.0,"A lawyer is also likely to have a much, much larger wodge of spare cash, and a far greater ability to both pull credit from a bank and pay it back later, and generally recover from a financial blip. Not to mention that a lawyer - a professional negotiator - is going to have a better time negotiating for a hardship reprieve on various payments.

Meanwhile, doing income tests just adds more paperwork expense and money going into the pockets of bureaucrats rather than the needy. Yes, if you make it a simple ""does your branch have you recorded as working these days"" you'll get some rorting of the system, but it's already such a low payment to begin with and way below what most people would consider tenable in the first place."

linuxadmin,fdphfwh,t3_emcuqm,1578628719.0,">No one really provided a reason for learning BASH scripting when Ansible exists.

Ansible is a configuration management tool. Config management tools are for managing config - setting up software, applying changes.

Shell scripts are for actions. These can be things like ""install mysql and config it"", or they can be things like ""run the sql backup"", ""test this endpoint"", ""compile this file"". You're not going to be running an Ansible playbook to do your nightly database backups.

They don't overlap all that much as tools - shell is bad at config management (because it's on you to remember all the edge cases and deal with them), and config management tools are bad at being general scripting tools (though of course you can shoehorn them into that role)"

The goal isn't to get Scomo personally to have a change of heart. It's to make the LNP's political position so untenable to the public that they are forced to actually do something for a change.

He didn't say it to the press, though. Just because someone happens to be hanging around with the ability to long-mike someone doesn't mean that whatever was said was intended for public consumption. Scomo's stupid comments were said to the press, not just 'near' the press.

And, seriously, fatalism is a standard mechanism for dealing with the stress of dangerous jobs or jobs handling the maimed - see emergency service workers and hospital staff for other examples. 

There's plenty of things that Tones did in full public view, talking openly in public fora and to the public, that we can hang him out to dry on. We don't need to clutch pearls at a bit of fatalism in a private conversation to call him a bad man."
