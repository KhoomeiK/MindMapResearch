We shouldn’t hand over power to a group of people who do not have the skills and foresight to  lead a country, just because we want the incumbent to be brought down. Let’s face it, our opposition is not strong. Even in the coalition, worthy leaders are at most only one or two. If you think this is a risk we ought to take, especially in an environment where international political instability is on the rise, then I guess we share different views on the course that our country should be take.

Look at America, the country’s captain is running the ship aground. Yes, the civil servants are doing their jobs to the best of their abilities but a poor leader with poor ideals and direction can bring the country from one of the most respected to one of the biggest jokes within a term or less. 

What I’m trying to say is that at the end of the day, I don’t see the opposition party as people who have the foresight and aptitude to lead the country towards progress.

singapore,fed6y4f,t1_fectl65,1579001801.0,"I’d like to add a point. 

Friendship like all relationships require investment and effort to maintain. If you don’t bother to upkeep the relationship, then it will go down the drain. 

So it’s not about yearning for the past meaning that your present is not good or your future is bad. It’s about how you can integrate your past into your future. How do you work that friendship from an environment where you see each other every day and have fun together or destress together or go through thick and thin together, to allow that friendship to mature and progress with your current environment and needs. If you fail to do this, then you end up as you said, “yearning for the past”. 

But that said, friendship is a two way street. If your friend doesn’t put in the same effort as you then no matter how much you want to let it mature with times, the friendship will be doomed. And many people are guilty of this - they start work, marry their sweet heart, have a baby and then the whole world revolves around the family. While it’s not wrong, they often forget to have an outlet of old friends. Eventually they neglect the old friendships as they put their focus into the new family and finally the friendships die out. I’ve seen this happen so many times. And then when you reach the age where the child is more independent and you can let go, you find yourself without friends. Then you ask where is everyone and by then it’s too late. New parents, you don’t need to neglect old friends as you build your family. From time to time, drop a message to remind them you’re still around. A cup of coffee with an old friend over one weekend won’t kill your child."

As well as firearms being a highly sensitive area, they only have ATP once a year or two. And as space is limited, they usually reserve for regulars first, then junior officers and specs, then any remaining space is for men. 

My best guess is as you were just posted in, you’re probably a T list and hence nothing to do and no driving details hence available. If you are at HQ, you’re also the big bulk of men. Back in my day, every node was allocated x number of places and they filled them up in the order mentioned above. If you are under HQ then as a T List you highly likely will kena selected for ATP. But if you’re in unit and are a driver, when the next ATP comes you likely will be driving detail and not available to shoot. 

If this makes no sense to you, basically what I’m trying to say is:
- in transport, ATP is hard to come by. This round just over, it would be likely that the next one is in a year or more. 

- you will not likely be selected for ATP again if it comes by, unless you’re going to ORD or you’re not needed to drive. 

- you should be safe regarding needing to shoot again. 

- this is based on information from years back and policy differs from unit to unit. But knowing how rigid the army is, I don’t think they might change the backbone of this system anytime soon. But take this information with a pinch of salt as there’s a Chance it might be outdated."

Instead of having 3 grades of physics (G1, G2 and G3), you already have pure physics and combined science (physics) (okay, just 2 grades to choose from instead of the future 3). Chinese vs higher Chinese, elementary math and additional math. Pure humanities vs combined. 

On paper the student will have the flexibility to choose according to his standard. In practice we all know too well that it depends on the school’s logistical capability to provide the students that level of study, on top of whether there are enough students to make up a class. If it’s just five students who want to take G1, I don’t think the school will open up a class (meaning the teacher must prepare even more resources, a whole new class with different learning style even, to cater to just five students). The school might just force them to take a G2 instead. We already see this happening in secondary schools with the current system (“my school don’t offer this combination”) and it already has less tiers to choose from. I’m putting my money down that it will be made worse in the new system. This system works in JC because there’s only what, 17,18 JCs and the cohort and resources are much bigger so they can afford to have the luxury of choice. There are 139 secondary schools with a population much less per level compared to jc. It just won’t work logistically."

The answer is: Glasses and eyepatch. Eye patch worked wonders in helping me focus. I can relax my eyes and look normally as opposed to trying my best to shut my left eye while focusing the vision on my right. If you go to the indoor range, the instructors there will have this home made eye shield u can clip on to the rifle scope that blocks most of your left eye’s vision. Also helps a lot when you can look out for your target using both eyes when not using the scope, and quickly blocks your left eye only when you view through the scope. This is as opposed to being constantly one-eye-jack using an eyepatch

But the eye patch/shield can only do so much. You will still need glasses for the poor vision. The good thing about the shield is that you can use it even when you’re wearing glasses like I am.

We always say we want racial equality, but yet we continue to condone such instances where one race is put against another. If we really want to deal with the racial discrimination in our society, we should not be tolerating certain instances of racism while getting outraged at the others. We should be calling out and recognizing every instances of it. Just like what I’m trying to do. If we can’t even take this first step to recognize racism when we see it, then we will never be able to get rid of it."

I don’t mind if we can set aside a piece of prime land and build a small but iconic park that can rival the likes of Gardens By The Bay. It will give a break in the concrete jungle that is orchard rd belt, it will give those who want to picnic a proper place to go and it will should be free from any organization or building. They’ve got so many event spaces in orchard now and they’re still gonna build one more at the carpark opposite cineleisure/scape into one more. I wish they won’t build yet another event space closed off to the public most of the time of the year but make something more accessible 24/7"
singapore,fd4lhje,t1_fd49xe4,1578168649.0,">We kinda do expect

That’s the problem here. Expectations often do not match reality. Besides, if you expect the mrt to run full speed every day, without even giving it a chance for maintenance as it is undergoing now, then will you be raising your fists at SMRT when a serious breakdown of the mrt system happens again like the last time? 

Early closure for scheduled maintenance is not new - they’ve been doing this for years already. They chose to close early on fridays and Saturday’s when the crowd is least affected, and also close at 11pm which is only an hour or so early. Most people would be home by 11pm. They announce which stations will be affected beforehand as well. Ample time to make provisions on your end to avoid getting caught unaware IMHO. They put up banners at the stations to inform you, posters on every other doors even. Maybe it’s time to put down the phone and look up once in a while to observe your surroundings."

But the owner labeled the ground floor 3rd and then the other floors in descending until 1. It was very confusing when we were at the ground floor and our hotel room was 301 and the receptionist said it’s just behind you to your right and we were like “don’t we need to take the elevator or something?” And he said no. Then stared at us like we were annoying him with stupid questions. It was very confusing"

singapore,fd0u4ar,t3_ejt6fi,1578123784.0,"Hey man, let me put it this way - you’ve already tahan one year of this shit, you will ord in 9 months. NS is not the end of the world. It’s not worth throwing your life away over three, four, five weekends. 

Your unit sounds like shit, and you think there’s nothing you can do about it. The silver lining is this will not last forever - come October you will be a free man, if you can find the strength within you to ride through these few months, I would strongly encourage you to. 

There’s also a few things you can do that will require less courage and and willpower than taking your own life. Not all senior commanders are the same annoying and demanding asshat, I’m sure there is one who is a bit more approachable for you to raise your concerns with. Find that commander, even if it’s not your direct superior, ask if you can have 5 minutes of his or her time to talk about a personal problem that you need his help with. Then tell him what you’re feeling, how the company policies are affecting you and your own mental health to the point that taking your own life seems to be a valid way out. Even if your commanders are complete asshats and don’t heed your cry of help, they’re already treating you unwell, it doesn’t get worse than this. But I do believe that this world is not as unforgiving and uncaring as it may appear to be on the surface, it’s likely that your commanders have no inkling of an idea of what is happening inside your minds and they build their responses based on their own expectations of you. This is why it is important to tell them first if you cannot come with whatever they are dishing out to you. If you can’t bring yourself to face a commander, find a friend to help you raise your concern for you. 

If you still cannot find a way to bring up your concerns, there is always the NS Hotline. Give them a call. They’re not your superiors and they have the power to investigate every case individually. Their job is to listen to you and act as a third party. They would be able to help you. 

Op, don’t take your life. NS sucks, but the world beyond it is only yours to grasp. Try to look further than the four walls of your bunk. Think about life after you receive your pink ic. Fight for that kind of life, not fight the life you are currently living. If you choose death over life, you’ll merely become a statistic. You won’t even make a dent in the commanders’ lives or career. Nothing is worth taking your own life. I wish you all the best!"
