So I asked him what is 2+2. He didnt want to concede that he knew, so he deliberately said 40. I said thats correct, and how he knows things. So he go more angry and said its not the correct answer, and the correct answer is 4 and finally realized he was trapped !!!"

explainlikeimfive,fe8mt01,t1_fe5jehs,1578928057.0,"There a few other critical things you missed. In times of war, countries in the past have also looted people for their wealth and raped women as a reward for the soldiers. This also serves as psychological humiliation for the enemy country, which the victor is craving for. Some of those things are categorized as war crimes. There have been allegations in the past of the winning countries allowing these acts. War is a time when tension and anger is high.

I remember reading somewhere and dont know if its true, but a lot of Germans today have Russian fathers because German women were raped and impregnated by Russian soldiers after Germany lost the war to Russia.

As to the question, how is it enforced? Generally its difficult to enforce at the time, but after the fact, generally you'll have some hearsay and evidences. Of course, there have been allegations and denials. But there is no court of law where you can sue a country for war crimes."
