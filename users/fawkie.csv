Anything truly valuable gets spammed and you price individually in a separate tab, and you end up with a lot of random sales you wouldn't really expect. Do I occasionally miss out on a few c by not pricing individual items? Yeah, but it's so much faster and I don't care."

You also get a ton of random small sales on stuff you wouldn't bother to price normally.

funny,fdpjepc,t1_fdpak0m,1578630243.0,"You're kind of wrong and kind of right. Ireland is its own country, with the UK being Northern Ireland and Great Britain (which consists of England, Scotland and Wales). Wales was conquered by England centuries ago, and technically incorporated into the Kingdom if England at some point. Ireland consisted of various clans/independent counties which were eventually all conquered and the King of England declared themselves King of Ireland as well. Scotland ""joined"" when Elizabeth I died and the King of Scotland, James the VI, inherited the throne of England (and Ireland). The Acts of Union 1707 combined the kingdoms of England (including Wales) and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain. The Acts of Union 1800 combined the Kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Prior to these acts of Union each Kingdom had its own parliament, laws, courts, etc. and the acts effectively folded them into the English parliament in Westminster.

Ireland and its people were treated generally extremely harshly by the English/British monarchs which lead to Irish Independence war after WWI, in which the majority of the island became the independent Republic of Ireland, and the northern, more Protestant portion, remained in the United Kingdom (now renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland). 

Today each of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland (but not England) each have a devolved government with various powers. In that way they're similar to states in the US. However each has their own history, language, and culture and have been independent countries in their own right in the past.

tldr; Ireland isn't part of the UK."

I generally put 2 points into class per level, which would give you a ton more life and energy, but can leave you a bit lacking on skill points sometimes. What you're doing does make sense though. 

The other thing is that you haven't got any devotion points allocated. If you've restored any of the shrines you should have devotion points. Getting a constellation like the Ghoul or Lizard should help a lot with survivability. If you haven't been doing the shrines, start doing them whenever you see one."
Grimdawn,fcv2t6t,t3_ej2jkg,1577993474.0,"Sorry I don't have a link to a guide, but here's some general advice. 

1. Focus on one type of damage and one or two skills that do that
2. Resistances are extremely important. Get your primary resistances capped and find ways to debuff your enemies resistances. Occultist's Curse of Frailty is one of the best debuffs in the game
3. Make sure you're putting points into your class. This gives you stats, health, and energy. Put all your attribute points into physique.


Also, conclave of the three is part of the latest expansion and that entire area is quite a lot harder than the main story. If you haven't finished up through ashes of malmouth I'd get out of that area for now.
