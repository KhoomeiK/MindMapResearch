> VA hospitals cannot be sued for willful torts that are committed by government employees.

> Lawsuits against VA hospitals cannot pursue punitive damages.

https://www.medmalfirm.com/news-and-updates/veterans-sue-va-hospitals-medical-malpractice/

The ""no punitive damages"" is why VA never changes. It looks like they are cost-efficient but they are not; in reality they should be paying hundreds of millions of dollars per year in malpractice claims. The things Veterans are subjected to at VA would *never* fly in the civilian world.

Trust me when I tell you you have no idea how fucked up Veteran's Affairs is and absolutely *nobody* there is concerned about getting in trouble.

My current psychiatrist is a caribbean med school grad (and damn nice guy). The one before him failed out of the civilian sector by driving drunk, crashing, and then lying about it. He received two sanctions from the Ohio medical board; one for driving drunk, and another for lying about it. That guy lied on me and said I got a dishonorable discharge (an absolutely blatant lie, I had *zero* UCMJ actions against me, nothing even close to that, as *PROVEN* by my Good Conduct Medal [3 years of service with no adverse actions of any kind]) And that's not some kind of ""I cut a deal"" type bullshit I'm telling you. He did that because I told him VA is bullshit care compared to the civilian world and he was wasting my time with an initial intake appointment merely 1 month after I had just done one in another state (the ""tell me your whole life history"" intake). I told him I could've spent 5 minutes of an actual appointment just updating him. Hell, being seen every 3 months is normal in the civilian world. See?

The standard checks and balances that apply in the civilian world do not apply at Veteran's Affairs. That's what I'm getting at.

Where is the class-action from all the Veterans who died on the fake waiting list? The charges of negligent homicide/reckless endangerment? Nowhere.

It took Veteran's Affairs 6 months to find my medical records while I was languishing in a bipolar depressive phase with no money. Do you think anyone got fired for that? I called to complain and all I got was the run around. I called a lawyer and was told ""With VA you need physical damage."" Psychological damage does not apply, thus the gigantic suicide rate.

If a civilian hospital took 6 months to find a patient's medical records while the patient was living at their parent's house intending to submit a SSDI claim, calling every day asking where their records were, that hospital would settle out of court for 50 grand. Half my family does personal injury law.

It's not good for my mental health to talk about Veterans Affairs but maybe later tonight (or another time) I will list all the instances of malpractice I have seen at the VA, from the literal design of their hospital (pharmacy pickup windows are 1ft apart and you have to tell them what medication you're there to request a refill for, I heard a guy next to me say say *embarassed* ""Um, that one for dysfunction."" I complained to the pharmacy manager, when I requested him the nurse looked absolutely terrified. I said ""I'm not gonna shoot the place up, I just want to talk to him."" I told him maybe he could have us write what we need on cards and pass it over the counter. He freaked out and said ""I'VE GOT VETERANS ON 40 DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS (yes, he said 40) AND IT WON'T ALL FIT ON A CARD!"" then looked at the ground and said ""We looked into phones, OKAY?""

That was 2012, I didn't set foot in a VA hospital again until 2018.

That is approximately 5% of what I've been through with the VA."
