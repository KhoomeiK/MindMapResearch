btd6,ff90d8f,t3_esca4i,1579701613.0,"Segmented Co-op makes alot of maps less fun for P3 and P4 because of players like P1 here. Instead of dropping a ship so my sub can be more powerful, or putting his helis on the track, he just hordes the money from the kills and the game just becomes boring. Am I out of line for feeling this way?

I guess all I'm really saying is, I should be able to drop my own boat"
Jokes,fel5835,t3_epq03b,1579214324.0,"Ewan Macgregor told this joke in Big Fish

edit: here are the actual lines from the movie for whoever downvoted me

Edward: Well, I don’t usually remember unless they're especially portentous. You know what that word means? (she shakes her head.) Means when you dream about something that's gonna happen. Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and said, “Your aunt is gonna die.” I was so scared I woke up my parents but they said it was just a dream, and to get back to bed. But the next morning, my aunt Stacy was dead.

Josephine: That's terrible.

Edward: Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, ""Your daddy's gonna die."" I didn't know what to do. I finally told my father. But he said, oh, not to worry, but I could see he was rattled. The next morning, he wasn't himself, kept looking around, waiting for something to drop on his head. Because the crow didn’t say how it was gonna happen, just those words: your daddy's gonna die. Well, he left home early and was gone for a long time. When he finally came back, he looked terrible, like he was waiting for the axe to fall all day. He said to my mother, ""I've just had the worst day of my life."" (beat)""You think you've had a bad day,” she said. “This morning the milkman dropped dead on the porch!""

(Josephine smiles, looking at him sideways for fooling her with this story.)

Edward: Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.

Josephine: Can I take your picture?

Edward: Oh, you don’t need a picture. Just look up the word handsome in the dictionary."

todayilearned,fcjbpgk,t1_fcjaao0,1577682333.0,"It’s actually not. It’s a bit of an eli5 bc this isn’t a science sub, but that’s essentially what happens. 


“In case of over dose of paracetamol, the glutathione reserves may be depleted due to conjugate formation. Above 70% of this depletion, the reactive N-acetylimidoquinone metabolite will begin to react with nucleophilic thiol (-SH) groups that are present on hepatic and renal proteins. This results in formation of covalent adducts which produce hepatic necrosis and renal tubular necrosis.”

I’m on mobile and I don’t have time to really break this down for hours but basically these toxic reactions continue and the pH of the liver gets more and more acidic, which causes burning/death of the hepatic cells."
todayilearned,fcj9xim,t1_fcj9o7h,1577680940.0,"Yeah, esp because there’s a period between ingestion and metabolization, so the person begins to feel better before they start to die. And as some one else mentioned, the only thing that can save them is an emergency liver transplant which is practically impossible because they won’t qualify for any transplant list before this happens (roughly 20-40 hours post ingestion)
 
Edit: to clarify. I have a BS in biochemistry and I worked at an emergency room where I’d witnessed this unfortunate event more than once. Stuff like this actually dissuaded me from pursuing medicine.

Edit2: the 20-40 hours comment was from the suicide attempts where the acetaminophen toxicity was acute and untreated. Meaning the patient took the meds, waited beyond the aperture for activated charcoal or an antidote as the body had already moved the drugs past the stomach."
todayilearned,fcj88pj,t1_fcis5ow,1577679755.0,"So fun fact, the metabolization of acetaminophen by the liver is an exothermic reaction, the liver literally ~~melts~~ *burns* as it fails in an OD.

Edit; “literally melts” is too exaggerated and I don’t want to nitpick every one. In case you don’t want to read below, basically when you break down Tylenol it forms a reactive chemical which is then neutralized by another chemical in the liver. In case of toxicity you overwhelm your liver’s ability to neutralize the intermediate product so it continues to oxidize, which causes the “burning” reaction I was trying to summarize before the pedants freaked out."
