I can check the amount in my bank account. I can't calculate accurate taxes or cash tips I got. Do IRS have to give me code or confirmation to fill tax return with Form 4852?  
Tank you!"

csMajors,ff8a4ud,t3_es6d2y,1579670572.0,"I am CS major. I can share some of my experience how to improve problem solving skills. I had no coding experience prior taking first intro class at university. I used to be lost during lecture and lab. My LAB TA literally gave me the answer for all in-class labs. I struggled lot in my intro CS class. I got A in lab and B+ for lecture. After the semester I knew what I needed to learn. I had to practice functions, loops, pointers, and file input/output. In the winter/Christmas break, I read chapters 1-9 from book (topics for intro class) and did all practice problems. After I learned those basic fundamental I improved problem solving skills. After that I took CS 1 (OOP C++) and CS 2 (Data structure C++), it was not bad compare to intro class. You use those \`basic fundamental\` lot in those classes.   


From my experience, you need good understanding of basic fundamental to advance/success in CS major. In higher CS class you learn new information, if coding practice you use loops, pointers, functions, array ect. My advice would study those basic, they are most important in programming. Feel free to ask any question."

college,fetoxtg,t3_eqihrk,1579377805.0,"4) You have to drop the class to return the book or get a full refund! 

I don't spend lot of money for books. Here is what I do:  
1) Sometimes you can find E-book for $2-10 on ebay.   
2) Google search for pdf book. If you get lucky you can find one. Some professor don't care if you use older edition. Example: You need 11th edition book for class and you found 10th edition online. Some professor wont care if you use it.

3) Asking students who took the same class before. They may have the book or know how to get it.  
4) Rent book from chegg or amazon. It lot cheaper than ranting from University book store.    


I wish you best of luck!"
college,fe99r2t,t3_eo50o7,1578935633.0,"Last semester i had 6 classes on Monday and Wednesday 8:30 AM  to 9:40 PM. 5 days off! I used to take my own food and eat during break. I think its dew able. I caution you, you have to motivate yourself to work during off days. I would not recommend taking all classes on same day. Last semester I had 4 finals on same day. I had to run to different class because there was 15 minutes time gap and exam starts right away. My classes were 10-15 minutes walking distance. It was worst semester for me. Now I am taking class all 5 days and have enough time to work and study. Good luck!

college,fdaqm06,t1_fdahvum,1578249000.0,"I am going speak from personal experience. When I took first **Introductory CS** class, there was a lady ( 30 ish) in lab, she always complied how she hate coding. It was elective class and she needs D to pass this class. 

My major requirement is rigid. I need C+ or better grade in gen-ed and non-STEM elective class. If I take graduate level CS and MATH class for electives, I need B- or better grade. 

I am not saying non-STEM major is easy. There might be hard class in their requirement. The grading standard for non-STEM is less harder than STEM major."

college,fcugwe5,t3_eiuyys,1577980672.0,"Not really. If you take 9-12 gen-ed class and 9-21 main classes, you probably can manage your classes. Taking 21 credits is bad idea imo. My friend was taking  20 credits for last two semesters. He took all hard class ( Math, Physics, Gen-ed) at Community College. He was taking 9-10 at university. The CC was easy A. He manged his class pretty well. If you plan to graduate in four years just take 15 credits each semester and few classes at summer. Good luck!"
