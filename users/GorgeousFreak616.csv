entwives,fdqbr9n,t1_fdpqttx,1578662316.0,Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker changed my relationship with sleep and helped me understand it. I recommend it to everyone. Especially with our technology and such effecting us so drastically.
KitchenConfidential,fdqblq8,t3_emi7se,1578662180.0,I laugh snorted. Thanks for that.

educationalgifs,fdlayy5,t1_fdk44mr,1578520172.0,I currently do not. At least not for yarn. I have used beets and onion skins to dye eggs for Easter though and that was fun!
educationalgifs,fdlawm4,t1_fdk2agt,1578520133.0,Not as absorbent as Cherokee hair tampons!
educationalgifs,fdlaqmb,t1_fdjtd53,1578520037.0,Humans can get a lot of shit accomplished if we stop distracting ourselves with all the shiny things that technology allows us. If you're bored you're gonna do some shit. Lol
educationalgifs,fdjroaf,t1_fdjaqfo,1578484969.0,"The little roll they make it into is roving. With roving you create yarn with a spinning wheel or drop spindle. With spinning you're locking the fiber together. Think of a close up image of a hair and the little thorns or hooks latch together. You can then ply yarn together. Which means spinning two or more yarns together. 

With the carding it's making all the fibers face the same way.

Source: taught myself to knit via YouTube. I now spin yarn and sell hand dyed stuff to one of the local yarn shops. I also have four bags of alpaca fur I need to be carding in my closet."
LSD,fdfessk,t1_fdfef02,1578360009.0,I actually have a a temporary tattoo. It's a tattoo that just says temporary and looks like a stamp. No matter how depressed and suicidal I get it's a constant reminder that this is temporary. So is falling in love and happiness. All this shit flows. Got to just not hold on.
LSD,fdfdvpm,t1_fddw1hs,1578359394.0,Nothing supernatural in the graveyard but I've had a habit of hanging out in them and don't really hold any lore for me. Just a reminder that it's all temporary.
LSD,fddpq0s,t1_fddmf5q,1578320636.0,"I'm down! I tripped on Halloween once. I remember bouncing on their bed and being like, ""So, I don't want anyone to freak but I'm getting to the stage of the trip where I kind of have a panic attack. But it'll pass! So like yeah."" Another friend decided to take a walk with me. To the cemetery. I had gotten caught in a loop of everything has already happened and it's always the same. He thought showing me the gravestones would be enough to help me bump out of it."
LSD,fddpfch,t3_ekof0j,1578320386.0,"So, funny story, one of my first trips I watched Sixth Sense with my bestie. My father who I hadn't seen in like 20 years and had hitchhiked like five thousand miles to show up at how work place, decided to text me that my grandfather had died a couple years ago. I remember perching on my friend's bass amp like a cat."

LSD,fc5381t,t3_eg17iq,1577440819.0,I have that same window cling pattern! I kept seeing raccoons in it.
Journaling,fb8tgtl,t1_fb7proe,1576621509.0,Thank you! Arting it out certainly helps the chaos. If only for a moment.
