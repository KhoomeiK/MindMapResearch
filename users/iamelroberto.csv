Imagine if Joe Rogan didn’t let you know he’s about to give an ad from a sponsor who paid him. It’s one thing when you know someone got paid to advertise something versus someone sharing their honest (unpaid) opinion. 

It’s why when I read amazon reviews and it says “I received this product for free” I give it less credibility. People are quicker to say nice things when they’ve been paid or received something for free (or when they are the company themselves, pretending to be an average Redditor posting a “random video”).
