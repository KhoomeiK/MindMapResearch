SWORDS,ff2sby4,t3_erc019,1579522015.0,"The key to putting two different styles against each other is coming to an agreement as to the value of the sword strike before the match. 

There are a lot of negative connotations to versing another styles which I think comes down to negative comments in videos or threads. The reality is it can be a very valuable experience and can be a great way to meet new people and get more like minded friends who are interested in swords."
