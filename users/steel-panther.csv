kingdomcome,ff9luqx,t1_ff9lp0v,1579715718.0,This conversation had nothing to even do with carry weapons and now you are on about those...
kingdomcome,ff9ljfu,t1_ff9ag6k,1579715534.0,"Well, they are splitting their base between each other. They are the same thing other than he admits he’s a socialist and she’s still in the closet. I didn’t mean to throw it all on him, yes it’s mostly her."
kingdomcome,ff96m72,t3_es9ddj,1579706069.0,"Ok, these are funny but I’m not sure they are apporiate for this forum."
kingdomcome,ff96jv2,t1_ff8zt85,1579706027.0,He’s splitting his base with Warren. And their new tiff is going to galvanize their bases against each other.
kingdomcome,ff96bwk,t1_ff7qtcc,1579705879.0,"buckshot has the lowest penetration of all those weapons. It’s great close range but the lower mass of the multiple pellets loses velocity fast not to mention the wad doesn’t transfer energy as well as if it was a cartridge. Buckshot is less likely to go though your neighbor’s house and hit them.
 You can get a quality shotgun, one designed for home defense even, for around three hundred. Your suggestions run $600+.

In reality every single one of those is going to blow though drywall like nothing, it’s dust glued together. Only an idiot thinks it will even slow down a bullet. Some guy did a video years ago and it took like twenty sheets or more to stop a .22. Same bullet as your 5.56 but the whole cartridge is the size of my pinky nail, and you think drywall will do anything to that same bullet pushed by the powder filling a case about half the size of my pinky? The implication is absurd.  You let your lgs up-sell you into a more expensive glock or a AR didn’t you?

Biden is full of crap, he says stupid things and feels up women and little girls on tv,  but if you take one thing out of context of the rest of the statement he actually gives decent advice, buy a shotgun."

AskAnAmerican,ff1c46m,t1_ff1axyh,1579477372.0,Or you stop making false accusations out of nowhere. You flat out accused me of shit I have had no involvement in and you expect to not get called on it. The shit the media is doing is utterly morally wrong and you accuse me out of know where for no damn reason and no proof of running along with it when my comment literally hammers blind partisans on BOTH sides such as YOU.
AskAnAmerican,ff15ivy,t1_ff0xk6y,1579475445.0,"Reminds me of a old joke. A Texas rancher went to visit his cousin’s ranch in New Jersey. The New Jersey rancher showed him around the ranch and the Texan said, “Beautiful ranch you got, back in Texas though I got a ranch you can drive all day and not reach the end of it.”

The New Jersey rancher responded “I used to have a car that ran like that too.”"

AskAnAmerican,feypdxs,t1_feyoj9v,1579448655.0,It still amazes me how everything with him has to be orange man bad or Cheeto jesus saves. Any sense or reason goes out the door and it’s one or the other period.
aww,feymdx8,t1_feycdr9,1579447549.0,"Stop, just stop with whatever weird you are doing. There was no reason to ask the original question when the person said they just assumed most cats go outside, answering their own question."

gaming,fey6r34,t1_fexw779,1579441462.0,"On that end yes, their delivery people are freaking awful. Spent months when I was at the apartment calling them up and throwing a fit because the new delivery person refused to deliver to me. Never did know where she was taking them.

One guy while I was there, i really wanted/needed this item, and was watching for it, I see him pull up and I go to the door and open it and he is standing there filling out the missed you form. Didn’t even knock and he just gaped and said one second and went back and got my package. Had no intention of delivering anything. And they expected me to run half way across town to go to the Post office to pick them up. Glad I’m away from there.

Not that the Amazon delivery people are any better. Won’t use the mailbox most of the time and fuck with the shit on my deck."
gaming,fey4wcq,t1_fexaa1z,1579440832.0,I’ve found the USPS to be pretty cheap for international shipping. Spent ten bucks where UPS wanted a hundred and ten to ship the same one pound package to England.
windows,fetr6nb,t1_fetcfr9,1579378718.0,"I haven’t kept up lately, and it seems to bounce around bit I’ve found these subs to be pretty polarized on OS opinions. Love/Hate relationship. And I’ve seen it downright uncivil from both sides though it mostly came from one side."

AskAnAmerican,fdo87hx,t1_fdo6u5o,1578600581.0,"I don’t know the actual number, it’s the same tax bracket though so your wrong.  But not a lot of good it does to talk about such things with irrational and angry people looking to rage at others across the internet."

AskAnAmerican,fdo6grn,t1_fdnezg3,1578599721.0,Semis pay assloads in taxes and road tolls. Hell they are double taxed on fuel alone. Taxed at the pump then they have to keep track of every mile to pay it again to every state because the others want their share. Thats just one aspect of it. Then add in the time cost to keep track of all that.
AskAnAmerican,fdo5ni5,t1_fdng4dl,1578599326.0,I didn’t say otherwise.
AskAnAmerican,fdnctay,t1_fdnah0p,1578583040.0,Not falling for any of that gibberish. It’s fair if you are using a third or more of a service and vastly more than anyone else that you pay for it.  You buy three gallons of milk you don’t pay the same as the giy paying for one.
AskAnAmerican,fdncicx,t1_fdn33q7,1578582845.0,"So why should the ISP pay for it when an entire third or more of their bandwidth is taken by one business? Thats all your doing is pushing it onto the isps and therefore, the consumer again. Flatly I’d want it pushed on netflix as I don’t use it and have no desire for it. Make the people that use it foot the bill."
AskAnAmerican,fdn2c1d,t1_fdmynhf,1578575177.0,It was more the other side paying more. You can’t expect netflix using a third of the internet bandwidth to pay the same as someone else. It wasn’t an end customer thing to begin with.
