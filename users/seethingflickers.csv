bipolar,ff26t2v,t3_er7o83,1579495445.0,"I'll say it now, I'm gonna sound defensive as hell but hey I wanna say something too: you probably have no idea what is going on behind the scenes for people who seem ""stable by some miracle"". Shit is hard fucking work. People generally aren't magically blessed with having no symptoms, I guarantee they have found meds that work with them, take them daily, go to therapy, have support systems and keep themselves best in check as they are able to. Just like cancer can be dormant for a period of time, people can be stable from bipolar. Doesn't mean they don't have it. 

Also this is a community support group. You are bound to find that """"cringe shit"""" here. Not everyone has to be tight lipped and buried in shame about being bipolar."

bipolar,feny0nw,t3_eq3wwe,1579292532.0,"If you ""grow out"" of bipolar, I'm inclined to believe that someone has been misdiagnosed. I've had symptoms of depression/bipolar disorder since I was 12, am now 24 and I didn't grow out of it, just the way I presented my symptoms changed and my manic symptoms showed up in my 20's."
bipolar2,fenwt42,t3_eq40b3,1579292060.0,"I noticed that in the last week I'm shutting down more and more, almost like I'm physically incapable of saying out loud how I feel. I mentioned in passing to my family how I am probably falling into a depression again but there wasn't much of a reaction there. My therapist cancelled when I really needed to see her today. I'm angry and depressed and I just want to be left alone but I can't cause I have family responsibilities. I hope things get better for you soon."

bipolar,fekvjwf,t3_epntae,1579208483.0,"I feel this way. I was with my ex for 3 years and I really thought we had the most solid relationship I'd had, until we had a harsh break up. It had to do with my last manic episode and a relationship I had during that. Now I feel like I can't be in a relationship, cause I'm a lot to handle. But I suppose that goes hand in hand with my insecurities."
ptsd,fei70b6,t3_ep7vvt,1579131690.0,"I often have to explain to new people in my life that I feel everything too intensely. If everyone's scale is 1 to 10, mine is like 1-100 all the time. When I was with my last partner, I was very deeply in love with them, to the point of codependency. I'm getting better at regulating and introducing logic to my emotions. For example, at the moment, I think I'm in love with one of my good friends and I reaaaally am taking a step back to be like ""Okay, why are you feeling this way all of a sudden? Do you really love him or just cause you know him and he gave you attention, you think you are in love with him?"" I try to sort of think through my decisions a bit better. Cause I would hate to ruin my friendship or make my good friend uncomfortable over this weird crush of mine. I know your situation is a lot different from mine but that's my thought process in it :)"

ptsd,fdeubtn,t3_ektbv3,1578346766.0,"Probably dumb but my eventual answer to this question (for me, at least) was these meds are the reason I'm alive. I'd be dead without these meds. So I learned to be harsh to the people who thought they knew better about my own health. 

Nothing quite like someone being a little high and mighty trying to tell me I'm ""too young"" to be on so many meds and me telling them sternly that I need these meds to live a good, fulfilling life. I want to be happy and healthy. Nothing wrong with that."
quityourbullshit,fcvw8kt,t1_fcvuce7,1578011508.0,"No harm done! I was curious myself to see if I was in the wrong at first, which is why I googled it. My apologies that I got snappy with you"
quityourbullshit,fcvta6l,t1_fcvsllw,1578009605.0,"Okay but generally processed sugar is worse for your health than just whole fruit is. They have the same components, more or less but processed or added fructose is worse for your body than natural fructose. Also glucose affects your body different too and the ratios are different in processed food as opposed to fruit"
quityourbullshit,fcvs7hv,t1_fcvs04o,1578008915.0,I mean a quick google search shows that's blatantly not true but hey go off
quityourbullshit,fcvqe4x,t1_fcvpcis,1578007746.0,"Yeah, I've been told that too many times to count. I'm overweight, granted, but I know for a fact I got fat from eating fast food, not strawberries and whip cream. This was at a time when I worked a physical job too, and the strawberries were my lunch for the entire day. Oh well lol"
quityourbullshit,fcvp3og,t3_ej5vh1,1578006919.0,I got shit for the same thing?? My boss at the time teased me asking me how it was healthy when I was eating like strawberries with a small thing of whip cream. It was in those portioned Tupperware and the majority of my food was just strawberries and the small section was shallow and I filled it with whip cream. Like I guess sugar = bad? But natural sugar and processed sugars are different. Idk sorry for the long comment it just bothered me since forever.
