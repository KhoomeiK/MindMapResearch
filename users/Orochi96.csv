I understand there are situations where a woman never wanted to get pregnant in the first place (e.g. rape) and those are exceptions. However, in many other occasion, it’s just failure to use proper protection, thinking about precautions, or lack of pre-contemplation resulting in pregnancy while being ill-prepared psychologically.
Ideally, every pregnancy should be planned, but it’s not an ideal world.. still, unfortunately impulsive/irresponsible habits result in majority of unwanted pregnancies, and the easiest way to avoid being a responsible for being purely instinctual is to get rid of the fetus before you deem it “alive”.

Bottom line is, if you’re not prepared to get pregnant, there are many ways to decrease the risk to near 0%. I wish everyone understands that, and doesn’t assume the astounding number of yearly abortions are purely from those that “protection didn’t work on”."
