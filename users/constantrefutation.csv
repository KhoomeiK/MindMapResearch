bipolar,ff7vcl6,t1_ff7uzjd,1579659236.0,"shes a psychiatrist yes. I asked for seroquel the first visit but her reasoning was to wait and see what the sleep study said. and she wanted to see the ""real"" me without me using weed to cope. I'm sure she will prescribe something eventually but I dont see the hold up since I'm in compliance. I'm on lithium and she prescribed gabepentin to ""help with cravings"" while I stopped smoking. I'm going to keep my next appointment but if the situation doesnt improve, I'm definitely firing her and finding someone else to help."
bipolar,ff7qbfq,t1_ff7puiz,1579655768.0,walk my ass straight into her office and ask her if shes for real ugh
bipolar,ff573j4,t3_erks6a,1579582130.0,"I was never told this by my many psychs over the years but you're not supposed to use ibuprofen, take tylenol instead. I started throwing up and getting dizzy when I took ibuprofen without knowing I shouldn't!"
bipolar,ff56g1w,t3_ermiyb,1579581576.0,"I recently spent a lot of time on google trying to figure out how to filter myself. theres some pretty good tips but hard to put in practice. the worst part is that I truly feel right about my feelings but feel horrible about letting them out while emotional. it's like a pressure building in me and I have to say whatever awful point I have. 

lately I try to think of my thoughts as clouds. just let them pass by if it's not kind or if it doesnt improve the silence. I also try to think of how person might respond to the thought I'm thinking of saying. if I can prevent a huge ordeal then I'll try to just shut up"
bipolar,ff53gpe,t3_erl770,1579579188.0,"I've been listening to 90s/2000 era country music. I grew up listening to it and it cheers me up a little. it's the only ""happy"" music I can stomach"

bipolar,fdp4np6,t3_em9k7l,1578619905.0,I stopped smoking weed on the first and I'm so ecstatic to say that I dont feel cravings anymore and I think the hardest part is over!
awfuleverything,fdly2ol,t3_elzviq,1578535240.0,like how out of it do you have to be to do this in public like it's a normal fuckin thing
bipolar,fdlgnps,t3_elzs9s,1578523612.0,some people can smoke with meds and have no issues for sure. I recently had to stop (been smoking daily for 4 years) because my psychiatrist wanted to be sure it wasn't masking other symptoms before prescribing me something new. be aware that a lot of psychiatrists aren't a huge fan bipolar patients smoking weed and that might affect how they prescribe you medicine.

depression,fdktq76,t3_elvipt,1578510963.0,"hey there, girl here. 

girls dont necessarily want ""bad guys"". they dont crave to be disrespected or want to be treated bad. theres a million reasons why a lady might choose someone else over you, just like theres a million reasons a guy might choose someone that's not me. I can tell you one thing though, if all you want is a girlfriend and not much else to the point where you ""dont get why"" it hasn't happened yet... well that can be sort of unattractive. you can be nice as can be but you also need hobbies, other interests. activities. your focus can't only be getting a girlfriend. you gotta flesh yourself out more, yeah? of course everyone wants to love and be loved, but attraction works on multiple levels and you need be the kind of person you think is worth dating.

I really mean this as a tip, just my perspective of a girls thoughts. please disregard if this isnt helpful to you, I'm not trying to upset you at all. I've struggled with depression and other mental issues my whole life and let me tell ya, not many find it attractive and I totally get why. I hope it gets easier for you, just be yourself and I guarantee theres someone out there for ya"

depression,fdhu4db,t3_eleg3u,1578430184.0,"I used to try to draw, but even though I practiced for years I only got a little better. I would get so frustrated I'd cry and tear the paper up. I found acrylic painting was waaaaay less stressful because of how forgiving of a medium it is. with me, brush strokes dont have to be as precise. in fact in my art, the less precise the better. while drawing is super neat to me, painting is like drawing with colors. it have me a certain freedom I couldnt get from drawing and I could make paintings that looked pretty close to the image in my head! maybe this is something you might explore? 

I get the frustration with art and not being as good as you want to be, trust me. whatever you do, just know theres a whole lot of mediums out there that are just waiting for you to experiment with :) my high school had a clay and ceramics class and I did that instead of drawing, and that was like my hot new thing. 

just hang in there, drawing can be tough but you're in a class to learn how to do it better right? all you can do is try your best, even if it's just showing up. I'm rooting for you!"
bipolar,fdhgand,t3_elf3ru,1578422023.0,"baking is so fun to me, I love making cookies or bread or even a simple box dessert sort of thing. it's like doing an activity, then you get a super delicious reward at the end ♡ these buns look real tasty, good job!"

bipolar,fdetug0,t3_ekzl5r,1578346480.0,I like how colorful it is. and how the watermelon is cut!
depression,fd79tku,t3_ek5e2z,1578201316.0,"when I was cutting, I did it to make it so there was a physical reason for me to be in such emotional pain. I guess in my mind it was like I was upset about the physical pain rather than my feelings. at the same time I saw it as way to release my feelings and a distraction from suicide."
bipolarart,fd5dg8g,t3_ek1554,1578176539.0,I love it
bipolar,fd3oodh,t1_fd1hx23,1578160351.0,"thanks for your nice reply, it made me feel a little better. yesterday was pretty hard, I hope today is better for the both of us, we deserve it. ill try walking around today, I didn't much yesterday and that's a good point you made ♡"
