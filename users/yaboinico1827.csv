I’ve also learned to disconnect how Christians treat me from God themself. If it’s not following the concept of love God and love your neighbor, then it’s not of God. So if a Christian is clearly breaking that rule by being hateful, their actions are not condoned by God. 

I could also never leave my faith, in all honesty. I have spent hours in pain wailing at the sky and feeling a presence of pure love and just a feeling of ‘it’s going to be okay, I’m here’. I don’t know if it was some sort of placebo or Divine, but I want to believe it’s God. I’ve never felt such intense love before.

It makes no distinction between artistic nudity and pornography, and it’s flagged everything from sonic the hedgehog to emperor palpatine as nsfw while multiple porn blogs remain. It also passes up posts tagged as sfw, which means the sfw tag is mostly porn. There seems to be few if any human moderators in the process, and the appeal system is slow and ineffective. I have no idea why they didn’t stick to the system they had before, where porn was blocked off to minors but free and easy to access to those over the age of 18. 

Also if they had an easier report system the cp problem would mostly sort itself out imo.

PublicFreakout,fdy79jq,t1_fdy4avr,1578776847.0,"I saw a stat researching that stated pit bulls were around 22% and mixed breeds were around 21% of the bites studied, however I don’t feel like actually grabbing that rn because I’m tired

I can see why you would think that would be contradictory, however I was simply commenting on the number of bites in a controlled experimental environment, which I stated multiple times. However the real world is not a controlled experimental environment, and given the amount of reckless ownership and abuse of the breed they would obviously bite more, which I stated earlier. Again like I stated, it’s not the breed perse. 

Again, I don’t disagree that you should be careful around them, the same as around ANY strange dog. But yes, due to external factors the breed does need much more care. 

I hope you can see why I was upset, it felt like you were deliberately warping my points, not reading what I stated, or that you believed that the breed in itself was inherently bad, all things I take offense to.

PublicFreakout,fdxzoa1,t1_fdxyy6t,1578774563.0,"It most likely would be either pit bulls or mixed breeds. However AGAIN this is due to multiple risk factors. I don’t understand how this is proving your point, I CONCEDE that pit bulls attack more MULTIPLE times, however I do not believe it is due to breed itself, at least not the attacks on humans. They are a breed that should be kept from other dogs, as they are more likely to be dog aggressive. However human aggression was bred out of the breed as it was being developed, since as fighting dogs they had daily close interaction with humans. It’s like you can’t even read, I tell you the same damn thing and you completely ignore it to ask me the same question over and over again. Where’d you get your debate tactics from, Ben Shapiro?

If we lived in a perfect world where owners were actually perfectly responsible though, I’d say wolfdogs. Because they are very prone to aggression towards anything.  However if we also lived in a world where owners were perfectly responsible, wolfdogs wouldn’t exist so kinda a 🤷‍♂️"
PublicFreakout,fdxvimj,t1_fdxu9ar,1578773366.0,"No, that’s not irrelevant considering pit bulls bite at the same frequency as other dogs in a controlled environment. Since they do not bite more inherently based on the fact that they are pit bulls, because if they bit more based only on that factor they would bite more than other dogs in a controlled environment, (see! I’m spelling things out so you can read them properly!) there has to be a reason why they bite more. That would be not being spayed/neutered and irresponsible owners. It’s not the breed in itself, it’s the owners. Do they bite more? Maybe. But it’s certainly not due to the breed being more aggressive towards people than say...a husky. Or a Malnois. Or a Shepherd. Or a Cane Corso. Or any dog with the same or higher bite psi. 

Either you’re purposefully not getting the concept of different factors causing a problem when before there was none, or you’re really, really stupid.

Also the first and second stats you showed has the same problem with misidentification of dog breeds. Dog bite statistics are notoriously unreliable. 

Also I’m also not even disagreeing with you that they might bite more to a certain degree, why do you keep pulling up studies that act like I do? It only makes sense that the most abused dog *would* have higher bite stats, I’m simply stating that there are other factors involved, as the breed is not inherently more aggressive than other dogs with the same bite strength.

Also I would’ve liked that second stat you sourced if it actually had the other dog breeds that attacked listed. A pit is gonna have a stronger bite than say....a golden retriever. Or a labradoodle. But both can throw you in the hospital.

Also why do you hold on to dog bite stats as being this great reliable bastion? Self reported statistics by laypeople in a position of great stress and pain doesn’t seem like the best way to collect data in *any* situation, and you’d be a damn idiot if you thought they were. You’d also be kicked out of stats 101."
PublicFreakout,fdxthuz,t1_fdxreev,1578772760.0,"Sigh.....it’s amazing when people don’t actually read or respond to what I write. I *addressed* the severity claim. My POINT which you so kindly ignore is that other dogs cause bites as severe and at the same rate as pit bulls under a controlled environment. Thus if the reactions and bite severity is the same, there must be another reason why pit bulls bite more often. I ACKNOWLEDGED THAT PIT BULLS MAY BITE MORE, EVEN THOUGH BITE STATISTICS ARE UNRELIABLE AND I THINK THE AMVA KNOWS MORE ABOUT DOG AND THE RELIABILITY OF DOG BITE STATISTICS THAN A FINANCIAL PAPER. Your reading comprehension is really in the pits! Guess you read what you want to see. In order to address the fact that they bite at the same rate as other dogs WITH THE SAME OR HIGHER JAW PSI BECAUSE APPARENTLY YOU NEED EVERYTHING SPELLED OUT FOR YOU, I stated other factors on why they bite, such as that 97% of fatal dog bites are done by dogs that are not neutered and 84% of bites in general are from mishandled dogs. A sourced claim which you so conveniently ignored. I cited ways to keep dogs from biting, and legislation that would lower bite statistics. Another thing you ignored. My grandma bred dogs and worked with them her whole life and is generally a reliable source, also have you never heard of using a saying to show a point and then backing it up with statistics? Also I stated evidence to back up her claim (97 and 84% statistics) which AGAIN you ignored. Your source on dog bites stated the exact thing I did, which is that the bites are due to irresponsibility of the owner! It’s like you don’t even read your own source and realize they’re agreeing with my point that you have to be a responsible owner! 

Reread what I said. ALL of it, not just what you see."
PublicFreakout,fdxo63d,t1_fdxlldl,1578771155.0,"I’m a poodle owner, actually. I also come from a dog raising family, my grandmother bred german shepherds for confirmation and obedience and I have been around dogs and learned about them since I was tiny. I just have done my own research and know how statistics work and that there are always more factors to a stat than what is shown. That is where further research needs to be done to figure out why it is, and golly gee! It’s been done! By some of the greatest veterinary institutions on the planet and the CDC no less! 

The fact that pit bull type dogs are not more likely to bite than any other breed completely fucks with that stat that you said claiming they’re inherently more dangerous imo. Also a pit is hardly the most dangerous dog to be bitten by, that belongs to the Kangal. Several other dogs exert more jaw pressure than a pit, such as the German Shepherd dog, Cane Corso, Rottweiler, and Husky. The amount of bites and fatalities are clearly due to improper training and the seven risk factors shown by the AMVA. These factors, not breed, are what causes bites, as pit bulls perform the same as other dog breeds in controlled tests for frequency of bites. This is stated by the top group of veterinarians in the US, and possibly the world. Wether or not more bites happen to that degree is up for debate, especially given as breed identification is ridiculously fucky and there are around 10 or so dogs plus mixed breeds that can easily be misidentified as an american pit bull terrier. However I am willing to concede that more bites might happen from the breed, since it’s a common dog and doesn’t tend to have great owners a lot of the time. 

There is no question that the stigma of the breed means it gravitates more towards bad owners. There is also no question that the american pit bull terrier is one of the most abused dogs in the US, with the chihuahua coming in second. Abuse in itself is a risk factor for bites, as anyone who’s worked with an abused dog might know.  Abused dogs are also less likely to be spayed or neutered, yet another risk. It’s the fact that people abuse, mishandle, and don’t take responsible actions towards their dogs that causes bites towards humans, as the breed had human aggression bred out of it in its development. 

They’re also not dogs for beginner owners. A lot of people do get them and then don’t train them. At all. That’s something you can get away with on a beagle or a poodle, but not a large dog. Mishandling is another huge factor in dog bites. 

Anyways, to paraphrase my grandma on the subject: its the owners, not the dogs. I rarely trust dog owners I don’t know except when the dog is behaving properly in public, and I feel like that should be the case for everyone. There should be a license to own a dog and required dog training classes, requirements to spay/neuter, and leash laws. Now that would cut down on bites, far more than breed specific legislation. Especially since 84% of dog bites were from reckless or abusive owners and 97% of dogs in fatal attacks were not spayed or neutered.

PublicFreakout,fdx3fgi,t1_fdx0cq1,1578764901.0,"https://www.nationalcanineresearchcouncil.com/ineffective-policies/visual-breed-identification

A study was done to identify how accurate breed identification by sight was. They had trained professionals come in and determine the breeding of dogs, and to see if they were pit bull type or non pit bull type. One out of three non pit bull type was labeled as a pit bull type dog. These are trained professionals under no state of duress. I imagine the accuracy is much lower when you’re a layman under shock from a dog bite. The breed that someone was bitten by is self reported btw. 

https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/literature-reviews/dog-bite-risk-and-prevention-role-breed

Pit bull type dogs are also not more likely to bite than any other breed under a controlled environment. However due to the stigma surrounding the breed, irresponsible owners who want a ‘tough guy’ facade are more likely to own the breed. I’m assuming they’re also less likely to pay attention to the risk factors of a bite, and more likely to abuse or leave their dog intact.

Also idk man...I don’t think citing an lawyer vs the AMVA  and the NCRS is gonna get you super far."

PublicFreakout,fdwzp02,t1_fdrzf5d,1578763815.0,"It’s far more likely for a pit to attack a dog than a child. I’m pretty fond of the breed, but they were bred to be fighting dogs against other dogs. However fighting dogs had a lot of socialization with humans, and if one bit a human it would be immediately put down. Dog aggression and human aggression are two far different things. There were also two strains, one for companionship and one for guarding/fighting. These are both under the classification of pit bull terrier.

Also the National Canine Research Council put out a very interesting paper on bite prevention. They stated that several risk factors were more likely to cause a bite than breed. These include: Victim not knowing the dog, failure to spay or neuter, victim having a compromised ability to properly interact with dog (due ti age or disability), prior mismanagement, and abuse. Four or more of these factors cause bites in over 80% of cases. There was no evidence that breed was more likely to cause a bite. 

It’s interesting to me because the video has at least two factors. The victim does not know the dog and the victim is also compromised in interacting with the dog properly due to age. The other factors are unknown, but I wouldn’t doubt that such a crappy owner has mismanaged the dog and has not spayed or neutered their animal.

agedlikemilk,fdwavcs,t1_fdunzhm,1578756851.0,They totally did though. They had a filter based on the age you put in and it said ‘you can’t look at this because it’s adult oriented’ if you were a minor. They have the same filter on up and running porn blogs which tumblr hasn’t taken down even though there’s an nsfw ban. But no age filter on the images anymore. For some reason.
agedlikemilk,fdw9y43,t1_fdub2u0,1578756593.0,Also it didn’t even work. I still have a running porn blog and there’s still cp blogs. Tumblr has no idea how to make a functional website.
