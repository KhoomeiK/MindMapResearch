Feminism,ffd90sq,t1_ffbsky4,1579815784.0,"says who? I just googled it and there were absolutely zero sources saying that. the closest to that number was 0.62? the fake cases are incredibly rare and there‚Äôs stuff that would push a real case into being seen as fake 

also with ‚Äúfake‚Äù cases you need to keep in mind that almost every single case is somebody who was close to the victim like a boyfriend, friend or even a family member and there is a power struggle of some sorts since rape isn‚Äôt about sex, it‚Äôs about control and is a form of abuse. so a rapist will try everything to silence the victim from blackmail to public humiliation so a lot of victims are shamed into silence or forced there through fear. that‚Äôs why a shit ton of rape victims don‚Äôt report it or report it and then say they‚Äôre lying to protect themselves from the abuse that they would be put through from not only the rapist but all of the people who will pity the rapist and belittle / harass the victim. I‚Äôve seen that kind of horrific behavior with my own two eyes. she lost all of her friends, was publicly humiliated multiple times and shunned by all of his friends since he was popular. and after being raped you‚Äôre already in an emotional and fearful state so that kind of horrific backlash can cause severe damage. 

and not to mention the justice system itself cause also this whole idea that rape is taken seriously in the court system enough to have the adequate amount of evidence to send fake cases to jail is hilarious considering how the justice system treats rape cases. there was a case in which the victim‚Äôs underwear was shown in court to prove she was ‚Äútempting‚Äù even though he could‚Äôve only seen it after beginning to rape her. so even if you have evidence they will *try* to make it either your fault or make the evidence seem useless. she killed herself after the trial by the way. if you want to read about it her name was Lindsey Armstrong. she was only 17, the man was 27 and is still walking free 

so like between these factors and a bunch of others what looks like a fake case needs to be taken with a grain of salt and looked into way further to make sure there isn‚Äôt anything behind the scenes like an ignorant judge or a horribly abusive boyfriend that‚Äôs threatening her."

and yet when we stand against the horrific treatment and try to bring attention to how common it is a woman being victimized by men they say ‚Äúnot all men‚Äù (as it that was ever the argument. that statement is just a weak straw man and yet because people who say it refuse to listen they think they‚Äôve won)

Feminism,fekp8le,t3_epk64l,1579204758.0,"oh men are uncomfortable?

what about me? I‚Äôm uncomfortable with the rape and domestic violence statistics that show a clear imbalance between men and women 

I‚Äôm uncomfortable that three women die DAILY because of domestic violence 

I‚Äôm uncomfortable that men think they can tell a woman what she can or can‚Äôt do with her reproductive system even though most of them don‚Äôt even know what a Fallopian tube is or that period ‚Äúblood‚Äù isn‚Äôt blood. its uterine lining or even know the cause of periods or why women get emotional during them or that they can even say what I can or can‚Äôt do with my body. why does a corpse and an embryo that has no brain (which means no brain activity, which means no life) have more body autonomy than I do? 

I‚Äôm uncomfortable with rape culture and seeing a woman in my school lose most of her friends, get harassed and humiliated in public and online because she was sexually abused by a popular student. a psychopath he was, he abused women constantly and everybody loved him and shunned and shamed her. his only excuse was ‚Äúshe bled because my dick is big‚Äù  and on that note I‚Äôm uncomfortable with the fact that a rapist who caused permanent bodily damage to a woman and gave her PTSD undoubtedly for the horrific things he did to her got three months in jail. and he later said ‚Äúmy life was great until *she* happened‚Äù blaming HER for HIS actions 

I‚Äôm uncomfortable with the fact that women are taught from a young age to fear men and fear what they could do rather than teaching young boys to fucking control themselves and respect women as human beings and not objects that only exist for their pleasure. on that I‚Äôm uncomfortable with parents telling little girls ‚Äúhe hit you on the playground? he has a crush on you‚Äù because it not only teaches girls that violence = love but also teaches young boys that they can hit women or physically hurt them

I‚Äôm uncomfortable with incels as a whole because they are violent and can turn murderers. literally go onto any incel forum and see the hatred, violence and disgusting bullshit they say.

and that‚Äôs not even HALF of the reasons I stand with feminism, it‚Äôs not even a quarter or even 1% of why I fight for equality

the human body in all of its glory is still a part of nature and nature fucks up more often than not. depression can be caused by so many things and doesn‚Äôt even need a trigger. the brain is run by chemicals and if one of those chemicals starts not being transmitted to sections of the brain properly for whatever reason shit hits the fan. and also I‚Äôve been mentally ill all my life, I‚Äôve been in therapy since I was 8. therapy is extremely helpful, even for non mentally ill people I think. mental health, despite it affecting the most vital organ in our body, the very thing that keeps us alive and experiencing life is out of wack, isn‚Äôt taken seriously. don‚Äôt think of a therapy evaluation as a ‚Äúyou‚Äôre for sure a crazy‚Äù think of it as a physical check up. like if you were having really bad pain in your right leg for multiple days or weeks you‚Äôd go to a doctor and ask what‚Äôs up, mental health should be taken just as seriously. in fact I advocate that mental health evaluations should be included in the annual  physical evaluation. 
human bodies are stupid. they fuck up without being provoked sometimes and that sucks massive ass but we‚Äôve got to take care of ourselves. and like take it from me, it‚Äôs not so bad once you start recovering. it‚Äôs uncomfortable going in to the first appointment (even for me when I get a new psychiatrist) because it‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre sharing an intimate secret face to face with somebody but in all honestly it‚Äôs the same awkward level as when you go to the doctor for stuff that‚Äôs like GI appointments or when you have to get into a gown for them to examine parts of you that are usually clothed. like yes it sucks, it‚Äôs scary and awkward but you just have to tell yourself that it‚Äôs needed for your health and your safety. depression can very quickly spiral out of control just like any other illness if not treated and can end horribly. I knew a guy that was the happiest, most positive person ever. I hung out with him after not seeing each other in person for a while and he was acting just somewhat off. I caught on to it a little bit but not too much since it was so subtle. in months he was dead. and to think the only symptoms he showed when I saw him were just being himself but a little quieter and a little more aware of his surroundings. illnesses or any should always be checked up on even if it doesn‚Äôt feel like a big deal. keep in mind a little brown mole that wasn‚Äôt there before can be full blown skin cancer, you wouldn‚Äôt risk it with your physical health. don‚Äôt risk it with your mental health either.
I‚Äôm here for you btw and want you to know that there is hope and you are valid and what you are going through is very real. you‚Äôre loved and I don‚Äôt mean to scare you with anything I said I just wanted to really dig in that mental health IS physical health . also if you need to talk I‚Äôm here for you, I‚Äôve been through this for a long time and have learned a lot haha. if you ever need a friend just hit me up ‚ù§Ô∏è"

I vividly remember most of the dream because to this day it scares the ever living shit out of me"
