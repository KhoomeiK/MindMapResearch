BSG,fet750r,t3_eqdra1,1579372403.0,"I agree with most of this, except the, ""without losing his cool"" part. The majority of his scenes are him losing his cool...

Edit: But I feel that's part of what makes him attractive to the audience. The majority of us would be him, always on the verge of losing our shit, in a constant state of panic, etc."
TheExpanse,fet53p8,t1_fesvcbu,1579371876.0,"I will warn you. The first season for the most part is absolute garbage. [This response is a very good guide if you want to condense season 1 down. ](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/6370/what-1st-season-episodes-in-babylon-5-are-required-to-follow-the-main-arc) I would highly recommend it. I started the show like 4 or 5 times and never could get into it. Until I watched only the arc essential episodes. After that season 2-4 are phenomenal. Season 5 is meh but I enjoyed the show so much I watched it anyway. Then I went back and watched all of Season 1. On rewatches though, I still only watch the arc essentials and Deathwalker/Believer."

aww,fe0i330,t1_fe0fj7a,1578813773.0,"Yes they are social animals. My very first pet rat I got when I went off for college. My roommate said she'd get antsy and pyne when I was gone for longer than normal. I noticed it too, as when I'd get home and she smelled me, she'd bite at the cage door for me to let her out. First thing she'd do is scurry up to my shoulder and nibble on my ear and cheek and sniffle in my ear. Sometimes she'd even bring me a piece of carrot or one of her treats. Maybe none of that was her being affectionate, but I always took it as such. 

My others have always done stuff I took as affectionate. One thing with all of them though, once they get to know your smell they were all a lot less likely to bite your finger if you poked it through the cage. If someone they aren't familiar with does that it usually ends in a bite. Now, I will point out that this isn't necessarily because they are mean. Rats don't see too good so usually this is because to them a finger looks like a great/carrot. They also tend to come to you of their own will and have you pet on them, or they'll crawl up to your shoulder and snuggle into the crook of your neck. They don't do this with people they don't know."
aww,fe08b8a,t1_fe02h5e,1578805789.0,"I have 6 cats. But I used to have two rats. The cats didn't bother them. They would play together. Honestly the rats would just be dicks to the cats sometimes, but the cats never got rough."
aww,fdzwqy1,t1_fdzdvg6,1578797659.0,Pet rats can be super clean. Most I've had clean themselves more than my cats.
aww,fdzwnfp,t1_fdzvb85,1578797592.0,"If you litter train them it is much much better. Rats tend to relieve themselves in one particular spot.  Just put them in their cage. Put food in one corner. Water in another and bedding in another. Then, usually, they'll use the free corner for doing business. If they don't, move the food/water/bedding away. The place they choose for their bathroom just put a small plastic box with some litter in it. They'll continue to poop and pee in it. Then you can just take it out and dump it every day. Very easy. Smell problem is solved. Better than cats even."

""I can't let you do that.""

The way when she says that his face and demeanor changes. My God. Such fucking acting. In most shows I'd be hoping for him to stay good on his promise. But with Amos. You know.  You KNOW he will. There is no hoping. There is only KNOWING. You know the moment his demeanor changes it IS happening. So fucking good!"

tolkienfans,fbwzi1c,t3_eeuqjm,1577163868.0,"Evil's defeat is never cut and dried. Destroying the ring wasn't the end of Evil, just the end of our little journey.  

I think Tolkien wanted to show that Evil can exist anywhere, especially where we least expect it, and fighting Evil isn't something that we can ever just stop doing. We must be vigilant. 

That's just, like, my opinion man..."
