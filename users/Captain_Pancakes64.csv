Wildlands,ffcdoic,t1_ffbi9mi,1579797220.0,"Yes. Playing the R6 mission in Wildlands will give you her gloves. They have a cool animation btw.

Her gun is in the store"
ADHD,ff4zqer,t3_ereme6,1579576388.0,Good for you! Bouts of unemployment are not fun. I hope you find something soon. Makes a person feel crazy after awhile
woodworking,ff4zccj,t3_ergx6i,1579576101.0,Mmmm crackers
Wildlands,ff4ww4v,t1_ff3qgmd,1579574392.0,Works with all guns. I'm just curious if ADS spotting counts towards the tactical stat
Wildlands,ff3qbhi,t1_ff3jfft,1579546557.0,Interesting
ADHD,ff0kclb,t3_eqy2uv,1579469683.0,"Definitely. I'd similarly to you in school. Got decent grades often without studying. I guess I just enjoyed most subjects. Once I hit the workforce though, shit was impossible."
Wildlands,ff0jv02,t1_ferl4j0,1579469508.0,Good info. Does ADS spotting count as well?
Wildlands,fenr2pt,t1_fenqnr7,1579289616.0,Cool. Thanks for the detailed answer
Wildlands,fen39kg,t1_femvdv3,1579276004.0,Interesting. Do you mark everyone before you hop in?
aww,fen37ey,t1_fem1lo7,1579275966.0,Thanks ‚úåüèº

Wildlands,fefj6h0,t1_fedudn5,1579057437.0,Interesting. How'd you find that out?
Wildlands,fefiduh,t1_fee1tis,1579056954.0,Buddy held a dude. My longest legit shot is 807m. I wish I hadn't done it honestly
Wildlands,fefi9u1,t1_feerejn,1579056887.0,Take an enemy and put him in a vehicle. Or get a friend and get him or her to hold him
Wildlands,fedsv87,t1_fedqkk7,1579019170.0,I'm taking about Wildlands tactical stat.
Wildlands,fedsp8y,t1_fed4htd,1579019069.0,Yes. Twice
InsaneTechnology,fecw43e,t3_eod71y,1578986954.0,***the US Military would like to know your location***
Wildlands,fecvwdp,t1_fecticr,1578986711.0,That's an epic way to play! But somehow I don't think Ubisoft would implement something so technical.
Wildlands,fecvqls,t1_fectfj8,1578986529.0,"Awesome response and is exactly what I was looking for! Thanks!

So it seems marking and outright avoiding guards will raise the tac stat.  Very cool. Makes for some good homemade challenges."
Wildlands,fecid59,t1_fecgqa3,1578974636.0,"Ok. So. That, combined with a slow and stealthy playstyle I guess"
Wildlands,fechvb9,t1_fech3tk,1578974295.0,"Ah interesting. Kinda what I figured. Now I wonder if ""suspected"" is considered not tactical"
Wildlands,fecefxr,t1_fece6sw,1578971962.0,The hero we need! üëçüèª
Wildlands,fecdxn0,t1_fecdbx1,1578971621.0,"Damn. I guess I'll have to hit up my local bartender

Seriously though. Thanks for answering so fast"
Wildlands,fec67r9,t1_feayrr1,1578967311.0,Yeah patience is a virtue. AC is fun. Black flag and AC 2 are my favourite
Wildlands,feafjyn,t1_fe8pvbg,1578948105.0,Ok. So how are they unlockable then?
Wildlands,feafdx1,t1_fe9p3dv,1578948022.0,Yup. I refuse to buy any future Ubisoft games. Such a scummy company
Wildlands,feaf7ht,t3_enxlir,1578947922.0,Curious about the camos at the bottom of the screen
Wildlands,feaezp5,t1_fe9xkea,1578947850.0,I'm asking about the locked camos at the bottom of the screen
Wildlands,fe9xpc1,t1_fe8bfvq,1578942352.0,Wildlands is super fun and is still very active online
Wildlands,fe9xgfk,t1_fe8tewt,1578942268.0,Thanks man. Got my gold last March ü§òüèª
Wildlands,fe8aqv3,t1_fe6cwcm,1578924305.0,"So if I went to the Ubisoft store and bought the challenge rewards pack, would it give me these camps?"
Wildlands,fe8ajfc,t1_fe7kgf4,1578924254.0,"Not nearly as fun. The final battle at least has you fight the villain instead of just a cutscene, but it feels silly. He's literally guarded by drones that block bullets lol... So dumb"
Wildlands,fe8a77j,t1_fe6rkzu,1578924138.0,Yeah break point is severely limited. I wish I hadn't preordered it. What a waste
Wildlands,fdwh091,t1_fdjreuh,1578758585.0,"Well, you can use helicopters, just avoid trees and SAM launchers"
Wildlands,fdjm0np,t3_elmsz1,1578477342.0,Sync shot is your best friend. Run from combat. Snipe. Use the AI to you advantage. Avoid helicopters
Wildlands,fdgq9o7,t1_fdfpqd6,1578405481.0,Right on! Don't forget to save your file to online storage. Disable automatic uploads first though. Will be in settings
Wildlands,fdfpaqa,t3_ekxld9,1578366967.0,"I bet with a blue hoodie on, it would look even more legit!"

ADHD,fd1bq5x,t3_e9j869,1578129517.0,"This is exactly how I feel. I'm always treated like a child and it's so depressing. The upside is if a person acts childlike around me, I can relate to them so much better"

Wildlands,fct47my,t3_eiq6ku,1577932450.0,Nice find! I must try this!

Wildlands,fcmghtk,t3_edot0x,1577774372.0,"Assault: AUG A3. Really quiet sounding with suppressor

SMG: MP5. It's just classic

LMG: MK249 with all ""handling"" attachments. Plays like a 150 round SMG

Sniper: M1891. Has very little bullet drop. 20 rounds. Sounds cool.

Shotgun: SASG12. A 30 round automatic shotgun? Yes please lol

Handgun: P12. Reminds me of COD4

Throwable: C4 or landmine"
