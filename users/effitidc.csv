You probably haven't touched an animal in your life. You think every animal is hostile. 

Doesn't matter if he's a lion. Think of him the same way as a pet dog or cat. It's no different. Same situation. He is friendly to them. He treats them like they're his. He is an animal lover. He rescues these animals. Just take the time to look at his IG. He is not an idiot like you. Again. Shut. The. Fuck. Up!!! You don't know shit. *You* are an idiot."
