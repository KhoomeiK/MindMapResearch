AskReddit,feys01j,t1_feyqstt,1579449859.0,"Nothing big. Got 2 smartphones fixed(it's matters to me, that's why I shared). Exams are near. Just one month to go. I have to study a lot. Trying to make changes in habits and having some hard time in keeping them up. And surprising thing is that I have started making changes in habits from 1 jan. It is also 2 weeks before. I am trying to quit porn, and games. Doing good in porn part but having hard time with gaming. Also trying to wake up early everyday, and take bath. And trying to study properly so I can get better marks. Also trying to control my behavior with my friends and family, as I told that i am feeling angry and don't have patience to talk with anyone."
AskReddit,feyqga8,t1_feypi9m,1579449287.0,"Seventeen. I think it's anxiety after reading all the comments here. This feeling is here from 1-2 weeks. In starting days it was in very mild form. After reading some comments here, I think i have anxiety because I am also feeling panic most of the time. And in situations where there are more things around me than usual or if there's any kind of pressure with me, i am panicking. It's like my mind picking up fight and flight mode for no reasons. Even between people I know. I am neglecting any kind of real life interaction."
AskReddit,feypp8y,t1_feyomh9,1579448871.0,"Alright! I am going to take some rest. It's the worst as compared to previous days'. Luckily, it's night time. I will sit here and walk here and there for some time and when my parents will turn of the tv in some minutes I will go to sleep. It's unbearable right now. I hope I will see some comments here when i will wake up."
AskReddit,feype3b,t1_feyomh9,1579448658.0,"I also don't want to stand. My head is not paining but want to place hand over it so that I can feel good. Music makes things a little bit better. I mean calm music. But once that gone, everything like it was before. Also feeling fear in my heart."
AskReddit,feyomh9,t3_eqxnyc,1579448379.0,"These days I am feeling something I have never felt before. I have shortness of breath, unable to sleep at nights, feeling angry in most situation but can't point out why. Feeling thirsty a lot. Wanna talk to someone but when someone is with me, unable to talk with them and they start to make me angry. Everything is weird. I was feeling a bit ashamed about sharing this because seems like I am making these things myself. But this is the truth. I am also unable to focus. This is why this comment is not even the 50% of what i am feeling right now, having hard time to collect words and figuring out what i am feeling. Do I have depression or anxiety?

I am having a lots of negative thoughts. I am making situations, even very simple ones look like worst because of my perspective."
pornfree,few9tma,t1_ferpoly,1579407294.0,"Just keep trying. A time will come when we will look back and be happy for the fact, we didn't gave up. Just get in loving with the efforts you are making. I am currently thinking about all the things I am doing about it in this positive way, and it really encourages me to not give up. Also find some activity that replaces this porn thing. I have started doing some study, and playing with my brother and started watching new tv show, I don't even think about porn these days. It's my 5th day without break and longest streak. I wish you luck. Start loving yourself already for all the efforts you are making. Well, off topic but still relevant."
pornfree,feqc8va,t1_feq2nw3,1579340106.0,I would recommend you to use an app called habits. Then you can track your progress and that has really helped me in continuing. Forget about longest streak but try your best to not to break it. I am a lot better than before if I look at my progress.

AskReddit,fdj4i6d,t3_elndwt,1578458222.0,"I just saw a dream. I was in school, not exactly school but there were teachers teaching according to periods. All of my tuition's friends were there and some of the old school friends. It was the 5th period, after recess. A new teacher had came, of mathematics so, we students were trying to do some fun but he was strict.

And out of nowhere, my day and my younger brother came. And he was asking something, and a kid wanted to escape from the class so, he said he knew what he want to know. Teacher allowed that student to go with my dad. My dad and your younger brother and that boy sat on the bike. My dad and me confirmed by blinking eyes that yes, boy is safe(actually I was telling because I was the one who knew about character of boy).

The school was weird. It was on the side of the road like a coffee shop. All glass. Very clear and hard glass. I only saw it from inside and don't even know if there were other rooms or not. It was raining. Just drizzling. As we both blinked , my dad started the bike. And he had just started going, he saved himself from a crazy driver. Crazy driver was coming straight to him from front in high speed of about 60mph. My dad was only about 5mph. To save, my dad accelerated bike and passed that driver. But suddenly another bike came out of nowhere and passed very closely, disbalancing bike. They had a very scary accident.

Because the speed was high, everyone was lying with good separation. But it's no good here. Just as they all fell down. I rushed towards my younger brother to check him. His helmet was lying besides his head. I holded helmet, but what was in the helmet. Brain!! I don't know how I imagined that but that's what it was there. I looked at my brother's face, had tears in my eyes. Genuinely scared and sad. I put the helmet back on his head. And....

The dream was over. I was in my bed. I touched myself. Again and again I touched myself and pinched myself. I looked around myself and was happy to know that they are alive. And......

The dream was over. AGAIN!!

Now, i was hoping it is not a dream now. This time my body was sleepy. I was able to feel myself. Definitely it was reality. And...

It was actually me. So finally dream was over. It made me realise that we will die some day. My parents may die before me, because they are older than me. Anyone can die at any time. My family always trying their best to provide me best. My brother who is 10 yrs old. How many times he tries to be with me. He always asks me to play with him, outside or inside. He asks me to study with him. But I keep ignoring him. Because I am a dumbass who wants to look at the lives of stangers on YT and reddit and on internet. I want to collect information that I will never use. I felt really really bad. I had tears in my eyes. I even ignore my parents too. Now, i am lucky to have this beautiful family. I don't want to waste this precious time. If I kept doing what I am doing I will surely regret it and I don't want it to happen.

Well, it was one of the most detailed dreams of my life. It was just the brief summary of it. Everything was detailed, I could had explained about characters in my dream. And everything was emotionally related. I tried to make it short but keeping it effective. And all of this happened some minutes ago. Hoping I will not wake up again."
