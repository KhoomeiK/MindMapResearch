spicy,ffdj8t3,t1_ffdhcan,1579822033.0,I feel like the Toe of Satan would be worse than the peanuts but I am not brave enough to try any of that so I‚Äôm likely wrong.
spicy,ffdgkj0,t3_esjqey,1579820416.0,Hot sauce and cat. ‚ù§Ô∏è
spicy,ffdgasm,t3_esulxn,1579820261.0,"Is this like the shelf of death? So many stupidly hot things here.

Edit: I bought the death nut  2.0 challenge for a friend. He beat it like a champ but the nuts won the war later on."
spicy,ffdg7t3,t3_esu6m3,1579820213.0,Having Da Bomb and Exhorresco right up front is a power move. Let‚Äôs everyone know your collection isn‚Äôt to be trifled with.
AskReddit,ffaw5pt,t1_ffand1m,1579745883.0,"They are really good about not hovering over you unless you specifically ask for help. I‚Äôve never had to deal with that unlike my other retail jobs where they wanted me to hover around people. Also their replacement/insurance plans are amazing. No hassle and you can pay to get another plan on the replacement so I just keep extending my plans. Love Best Buy and I won‚Äôt buy any electronics, if I can help it, from anywhere else."
DestinyTheGame,ff4a9lf,t1_ff2y3do,1579558955.0,Last Exit code. It‚Äôs still worked on from time to time but not much.
tacobell,fem8rup,t3_epi3rg,1579243928.0,The absolute mad lad.
spicy,fdwv96n,t3_en0qn9,1578762659.0,I've seen this flavor combination fo Wings a lot. It sounds amazing. I've had Mango Habenero salad and I love that combo so in wings should be incredible.
AskReddit,fdu3yri,t3_emu3tp,1578727123.0,GameStop. They screwed me over on Cayde statue from the D2 Limited Edition bundle they were offering. When I preordered it online I was told the statue would ship with the game. Found out about a day later they required all online people to got to a local store and of course by that point every store was sold out. I even had questions about my pre order and they took forever to get back to me. It even took forever to cancel my preorder so I could preorder elsewhere.
DestinyTheGame,fdrxt17,t1_fdr98o8,1578691332.0,These are the type of responses I wanna see more of. Giving us actual answers with detailed reasons why things can or can‚Äôt be done is what I wanna see instead of the usual ‚ÄúWe are listening.‚Äù Great work today!
AskReddit,fdr2mvf,t1_fdqhzt3,1578678696.0,I love Lego. Will buy them till I die. My main issue is cost which severely limits my ability to horde them. Taken me my whole life to amass my collection.
AskReddit,fdr18l5,t3_emqd57,1578678108.0,"Lego. Top quality product, versatile and a ton of stuff to choose from. My one complaint is the price, which is absurdly high, and that limits my ability to purchase it usually."
cats,fdnujye,t1_fdnu9cm,1578593127.0,I love the checkups where you get to be there as they check out the kitty. It‚Äôs interesting to see how they handle it. My cats try to find a way out of the situation constantly. They won‚Äôt sit still and immediately try to find the tightest corner in the room they can get to. Luckily the vet we have is pretty good at keeping them contained so they can do their work.
cats,fdnqky0,t1_fdnl5de,1578590941.0,The hardest part about going to the vet is the trip there. Everything else is easy.
cats,fdnqf1u,t1_fdndmsr,1578590864.0,My cats do the same. They hate going to the Vet. Just gotta reassure them it's for their own good.
raidsecrets,fdli6eh,t1_fdkh6ln,1578524551.0,I dunno. I‚Äôve seen that with other posts on here. I didn‚Äôt login and it marked it that way for some reason. Dunno how to turn it off.
DestinyTheGame,fdiecx9,t1_fdiduz3,1578440995.0,This line made the entire quest for me. So perfect.
DestinyTheGame,fdi3ch7,t3_elevtq,1578434996.0,Shaxx singing is up there with some of the most epic moments in the history of Destiny. That made the entire quest for me.
DestinyTheGame,fdi38su,t1_fdhfo4i,1578434942.0,So is everything now over? ü§î
DestinyTheGame,fdhkrk4,t1_fdhkadt,1578424734.0,Thanks! I added it.
DestinyTheGame,fdhhgc8,t1_fdhhamz,1578422725.0,"New exotic Sidearm quest.

Then you get the gun."
DestinyTheGame,fdhgy9k,t1_fdhgsvv,1578422424.0,I did circles around the map meticulously looking for them then when I found my last few I was dumbfounded because it seemed so obvious. Mainly the one directly in the middle.
DestinyTheGame,fdhftd2,t1_fdhfo54,1578421739.0,Dead Orbit Resurrection and I use an Obsidian Radiance you can get from Ada.

DestinyTheGame,fdhdvcx,t1_fdhdpjx,1578420606.0,"Same. The last one in the middle I walked past so much and when I realized it was there I was like, ""You've got to be kidding me...."" Lol"

AskReddit,fdbqwru,t1_fdav1xi,1578260463.0,I remember reading the original story when it came out and that was funny. This made it even more hilarious. I was nearly in tears reading that. Was also cringing along with the story.
AskReddit,fdbo7zx,t1_fdbdjca,1578259409.0,That's what makes this entire story so brilliant. It's the epitome of laziness.
spicy,fd0omba,t3_ejpgyh,1578121680.0,I really need to try some of the Bravado line. Pineapple Habenero and Black Garlic Carolina Reaper sound incredible.
cats,fcwgxnl,t3_ej3o4g,1578025338.0,This kitty looks so similar to my very 1st cat I had growing up. I miss her. ='(
Whatcouldgowrong,fcvgmdc,t1_fcv78kj,1578001676.0,"As someone who‚Äôs driven through many a snowstorm and the aftermath of those storms, I can confirm the accuracy of this comment. Hell people don‚Äôt know how to drive in normal sunny conditions let alone if it starts to get slick out."

rct,fcuu6eb,t3_eiyhd9,1577988572.0,Love the look of this so far. Amazing detail and work. Looking forward to seeing more.
rct,fcuu3l6,t1_fcujp4t,1577988523.0,"That is about as good as your gonna get. I've dealt with that element, or something similar I can't remember, before and went through multiple iterations, even with help from the community, before I just had to settle for something that was close."

Minecraft,fcnw583,t1_fcnaky3,1577819634.0,That island immediately popped into my mind as soon as I saw this.
spicy,fcm9kaw,t1_fcli8q0,1577767929.0,"I tried a drop of it at my friend's place and you can't really taste the extract. It actually tastes pretty good for an extract sauce. The heat is intense but it didn't kill me like I thought it would(I was legitametly nervous) though I only tried a drop of it. Next time I'm trying more. My friend even made his so called ""death wings"" which featured The End as one of the componets of his sauce. They were tasty and very hot but had no extract flavor anywhere in it.  


Edit: Yea, they are pricey too. Lot of their sauces are $15+ which is just ridicioulous but they make amazing stuff so it is what it is."
cats,fclvg2e,t1_fcls2ut,1577757436.0,She is like those videos I‚Äôve seen of dogs where their owners will open the patio door and the dog will sit behind the glass of the closed part of the door then wonder why there is this invisible barrier preventing them from going outside.
cats,fclvc2c,t1_fcli75y,1577757359.0,"This is my cat. She will come in, spend a little amount of time and then want right out. Sometimes she will sleep on my bed for a while.

tacobell,fcjcq42,t1_fcjckhr,1577683181.0,Yea PP is tad expensive which is why I haven‚Äôt bought much from them but they make quality stuff so if I have excess money to throw at them I‚Äôll probably buy another bottle.
tacobell,fcj9hz9,t1_fch5ufx,1577680619.0,"When the reaper ranch sauce first came out, I mixed some of my [Pepper Palace‚Äôs Times Up Reaper hot sauce](https://pepperpalace.com/products/times-up-tomato-blend-reaper-hot-sauce) into it.

DestinyTheGame,fbz0uad,t3_ef58o6,1577231716.0,"These kinds of quests have been an issue for a long time. They have a bad habit of designing quests that make you play the wrong way, play against your own teammates,use certain weapons and it ends up making everyone‚Äôs experience terrible. Like this Iron Banner quest shouldn‚Äôt have a step that is going to promote camping heavy just to get the kills needed rather than playing the objective. 

These quests also have no creativity to them. Most quests are fetch and/or kill where you do the same shit you‚Äôve been doing forever which basically amounts to chores. I really want to see them put some thought into these quests rather than what they have been doing. I know I can‚Äôt expect fully fleshed out story missions and such but there has to be something they can do.

Edit: Typo that contradicted my entire reply fixed."
