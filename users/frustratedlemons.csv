AskWomen,ffcz1ye,t3_esvgg2,1579810206.0,"I lived with a guy and his family a few years back when I didn‚Äôt have many other options. I was very happy and content and I really loved him. 

He broke up with me twice in about a two month period‚Äîthe first time he apologized the same night and said it was a rash, stupid decision and we reconciled. No issues for the next month or so, then he did it again. I got so fed up with this I told his mother I was moving across the country where I had family and leaving. She supported me in this, and when we told her son he had no reaction externally‚Äîbut holy shit did he go haywire. 

He was already speaking to another girl himself, and I had rebounded, but I was very private about it. We slept in the same bed and lived together for two weeks while I waited for everything to be finalized (U-Haul, work, etc.) He would text me when I was out at night (avoiding the house) and ask when I was coming home/what I was doing/etc. 

Every night he began to ask me to take him back. I told him no, he didn‚Äôt know what he wanted. He claimed he did, but I didn‚Äôt budge. Over the next two weeks, there were a few incidents such as coming home to him drinking straight out of the bottle on our bedroom floor while sad country music played, and one night where I dragged him out of the bathroom with a knife in his hand. I threatened to tell his mother and he begged me not to, so I set an alarm to go off every 30 minutes that night and I would reach over and make sure he was still there in bed (I worked at 5 the next day, too). He was baker acted a few weeks after I had moved away and continued to text me asking me to go back, take him back, offering to give up his entire life. I told him no. 

If I wasn‚Äôt with my rebound at the time I may have given in easily. I‚Äôm never usually the person who stands up for myself and this was one of the first times in my life I did what was best for me. His family hates me now (blames me for his issues) but really‚Äîonce someone leaves you suddenly it leaves a giant pain in the relationship that is hard to come back from. Usually, them breaking up with you at first reveals their true intentions. Now they‚Äôre just scared and want to backtrack but the damage is already done."
