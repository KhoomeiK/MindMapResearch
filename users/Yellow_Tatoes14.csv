You may be confusing me with he guy who made the rude comment towards Bernie supporters, who I also downvoted for a few reasons, one of which is because I support Bernie Sanders. I apologise that my sarcastically saying it's definitely dark out for random individuals, myself included, was too much for you."

Optifine,fehsc3x,t1_fehq68d,1579122901.0,Screen tearing is definitely still a thing. I still only have 60hz monitors and some games have quite bad screen tearing out of the box.
Optifine,fehm8iw,t1_fehklne,1579119397.0,"Right, the power consumption thing was wrong, that's my bad. Triple buffer does render a frame and hold it in a back buffer. With double buffer you're still going to experience input lag, because it forces the GPU to wait to render a frame, still causing input lag. Less than triple buffer, but still input lag. Running with an fps limit will reduce tearing compared to running unlocked. But my screen tearing has never been that bad in Minecraft."
Piracy,fehj9pj,t3_ep22sp,1579117677.0,"I tend not to pirate video games. If I spend my time playing a game, they deserve money. I put time into researching games before I buy them and if they don't seem like something I don't want, or come from a company I don't want to support, I just don't play their games."
led,fehd0lj,t3_ep65iv,1579114029.0,"Salt water likes to fry components. You'll have to test voltages and compare them to expected voltages to find any dead components in order to replace them. It's doable, but tricky."
Optifine,fehbv1e,t1_fehb3qk,1579113357.0,I don't think so. If he had vsync on in the first place his game wouldn't be running at 1500fps
Optifine,fehawqi,t1_fehakss,1579112788.0,"You're right, it doesn't sync your frame rate to your monitors refresh rate. But that's not why he suggested using vsync. He suggested using vsync to reduce unnecessary gpu processing. If that's what you want to do, limit your frame rate so that you don't cause input lag."
Optifine,feh9we5,t1_feh88ep,1579112183.0,"Don't downvote me because you don't know what you're talking about. Vsync uses extra gpu power to create a frame buffer to sync frames up with your monitors refresh rate. Causing input lag. Letting your gpu run 1500fps is unnecessary, and instead limiting your fps in game will safe from extra consumption while not introducing input lag. Look it up for yourself."
Optifine,feh88ep,t1_feh53yl,1579111178.0,Vsync bad. You can limit your frame rate and that will not add the input lag vsync does.

Others are:

Hot Mulligan

Those are all bands I enjoy listening to, you should be able to find some stuff you like in there!"
tinymovingparts,fdr6109,t3_emtuzf,1578679970.0,I listen to music through Spotify. You can really easily create a radio for a band or song and it will play music similar from different brands. I've found some really nice music that way.
