This is all realm of opinion.  You enjoy dune And i would just suggest you entertain the idea and watch the documentary. It is really astounding and he wanted to do it in the early 70’s and his cast was out of this world. I understand your ire, but he paints a beautiful picture in Jodorowarsky’s Dune the documentary, i saw it on netflix.
