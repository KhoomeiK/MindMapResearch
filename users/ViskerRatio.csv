Another way to look at this is that you need to put energy into the system before you can get energy out of the system. You need to first expend the energy to put that ball on top of a hill or to push those two magnets together - and the most you can ever get back out is what you put in."

It depends on how the inverter is implemented.

The diagram itself is 'wrong' in that it mixes circuit and logical components. To make statements about what occurs with those inverters, you have to make assumptions about the implementation of the logical portion of the diagram.

There are three general ways inverters can be implemented - as Vcc/Gnd, Vcc/Float and Float/Gnd. The cheapest (i.e. least transistor) methods are the methods that leave one of the lines floating.

So while I can understand that the diagram might be intending to get at a certain answer based on ideal components, if you actually tried to *build* that circuit you'd likely get a different answer."

The 'head of government' is selected via a coalition of the legislative. As a result, minority parties can join with larger parties to share in executive power.

In the U.S., the unitary executive means that only one party can assume (unshared) executive power. This creates an enormous drop-off in political representation between the two parties swapping control of the executive and everyone else.

However, the two party system can be viewed as 'fixed coalitions'. In parliamentary systems, most minority parties are linked to one of the major parties so strongly that it must as well be part of it."

The reason you only find relatively well-to-do people caring about climate change is because they're not worried about the actual effects of climate change - which they can afford to mitigate on their own. The poor people, who suffered these impacts long before climate change had any impact, continue to suffer from them. At best you could argue it could get mildly worse them.

But those poor people aren't stupid. They look at their richer neighbors and understand that the immediate problems of their lives that are blamed on 'climate change' are already solved - it's just they don't have access to those solutions.

explainlikeimfive,fep6uzy,t3_eq9607,1579313461.0,"The basic notion is that if you have a problem, a good strategy is normally to divide that problem in small chunks that can be independently dealt with rather than having to solve the entire problem at once.

This also translates into military strategy. If you have a set of potential adversaries, it's normally better to engage only one of them and defeat them entirely before moving onto the next. That way, your adversaries cannot support one another while they are individually being engaged.

Likewise, a common strategy for dealing with unitary enemies is to first divide them into multiple enemies. In American politics, it's often been observed that a mechanism for eliminating the political power of poor people is to turn blacks and whites against one another - as long as you can convince people experiencing the same economic conditions to fear/distrust one another based on superficial characteristics, you can marginalize the political power of the combined class.

In Computer Science, 'divide and conquer' is used to describe virtually all simple algorithms.

college,femxg00,t3_epxgm9,1579272128.0,"STEM is a broad field - and a bit overused as a term.

The 'Science' part of STEM isn't actually that great. An undergraduate degree in a science field doesn't give you enough to actually work in the field. At best, it's an opening for further education. Normally, the more math-intensive (i.e. Physics) your degree is, the more useful it is. But if you're pursuing the 'science' route, you're looking to go on for a terminal professional degree (MD, PhD, etc.)

The 'Technology' part is incredibly useful. These are disciplines ranging from IT to HVAC repair and are often referred to as 'trades'. They're highly demanded, pay well given the relatively little academic involvement and will normally give you a career for life. However, they don't tend to lead to the corner office - they're 'working man' jobs more than managerial ones.

'Engineering' varies greatly depending on field. There are four core engineering disciplines: Civil, Mechanical, Chemical and Electrical. Any of those will work out well, especially if you pursue professional certification. However, Electrical tends to be part of a vast spectrum of 'EECS' which extends from the most theoretical math-y parts of Computer Science all the way to running power lines across the country - it is arguably the broadest major field (and thus one of the most versatile).

The 'Math' portion is a bit of a red herring. Actually majoring in 'Mathematics' is like majoring in a scientific discipline - you need a PhD (or an education degree) to do anything with it. However, math *as a skill* is incredibly useful since there is such a high demand for quantitative reasoning skills.

Direct threat comes from damaging enemies and various direct taunt maneuvers.

The second type of threat is healing/buffing threat. This threat is a relatively small amount, but it is generated on every engaged mob. That's why your healer pulls aggro on everything that's not being directly attacked.

The reason your Shadow Priest was pulling threat was either because they were opening with Mind Blast (which is really no different than opening with any other burst damage sequence and is related to poor play) or they were using Vampiric Embrace (which generate a lot of general healing threat)."

Even without such obvious contradictions, many times rights are expressed in glowing, positive terms despite being negatives. The old Soviet Union had a 'right to housing' - by which they meant they'd force you into housing (jail) if you didn't want to live the barely livable tenement in the industrial waste part of town they gave you. The manner in which you provide 'rights' is more important than merely stating them.

Moreover, the article fundamentally misunderstands what rights *are*.

Contrary to how many people seem to regard them, rights are not the childish notion of do-as-you-please. They are foundational structures of a nation and thus must be practical for the aggregate. The only reason we have individual rights is so we can have a well-ordered society - and the importance of those rights is related to how critical they are for the creation of that order. Indeed, that's why 'rights' were considered an outgrowth of the notion of 'natural law' - the implicit law that well-ordered societies must accept to thrive.

Consider gay rights. Now, this is nice to have. But it's not actually a terribly important set of rights. Indeed, it's more reasonably viewed as a luxury of wealth than anything else. It's a bit like having the right to own a yacht. From the standpoint of a society - rather than the narcissistic desires of an individual - there's not really much reason that people *shouldn't* be able to own yachts.

classicwow,fees10j,t3_eoqmvf,1579039975.0,"Elemental Shaman have two main issues with PvE raiding:  
- Endurance. Elemental Shaman simply don't get much in the way of mana management. For a geared Elemental Shaman, it takes a bit under a minute and a half (at the moment) to burn through your entire mana bar. Yes, you do a heck of a lot of damage in that time, but you're still out of mana at the end. You can play some games with downranking, but you very rapidly get into ""might as well just melee"" territory.  
- No debuffs. Fire and Shadow both get a +15% and +10% debuff. Frost gets a +10% critical buff and a +10% debuff. Nature gets... Stormstrike.

That being said, while raiding as Elemental isn't all that practical, raiding while spec'd Elemental is. If you're going to be a pure 'raid healer' (which many Shaman are relegated to because they're better at it than Priests/Druids in most cases), you don't really need to ever cast Healing Wave. If you're never planning to cast Healing Wave, the top half of Resto is considerably less appealing.

Since Chain Heal really takes off with the 3p T2, this becomes a valid approach.

Note: It's entirely possible a casting-focused Elemental Devastation/Enhancement build could put up competitive numbers once AQ40 rolls around (and Flametongue becomes viable). The gear sets available from PvP/AQ/ZG certainly support this approach.

Pensions did not disappear due to 'corporate greed' or 'Reagan era tax cuts'.

The primary reason they disappeared was simple demographics. Pensions were effectively a form of lottery. You took a pay cut during your working life and you got it back in retirement. *If* you lived that long, which you probably didn't. Because so many people died before collecting significant pension money, that meant there was pension money for the remainder.

But when most people are living past 65, pensions stop making sense. It becomes impossible for a company to offer both competitive wages *and* pensions, except to already lavishly compensated employees.

You also have to consider that employment patterns have shifted. Working for the same companies for decades is the exception rather than the rule these days. Chances are that even if your company offered a pension you wouldn't qualify for it anyway because you haven't worked for them long enough.

Minhaj also fails to recognize another key component: home ownership. The third pillar of retirement wasn't 'savings' so much as 'value invested in a home'.

But, again, this falters due to changing lifestyle patterns. People are far less likely to need a home because family formation has diminished. Home ownership is more problematic because they're moving around more often. And, of course, even if you did manage to invest in a home, you're not going to enjoy the enormous increase in value earlier generations did because there hasn't been an enormous surge in home purchases due to increasing population.

Nor is there an easy solution via government programs or eliminating 'corporate greed'. The problems are fundamental and systemic, not some people just being jerks. The truth is that people's productivity rises throughout their life and then starts to fall.

If most people die before their falling productivity makes them too much of a burden, the system works. But increasingly we're seeing 'negative productivity' people - people whose lifelong production is exceeded by their lifelong consumption.

What you're decrying as 'rising above the material' is simply acting. Did you find Anne Hathaway's character arc or her emotions confusing in either Dark Knight Rises or Interstellar? I didn't.

This is a bit more complex than you're making out. There are many women for whom this sort of transactional sex isn't an option. But there are woman who *are* willing to trade sex for getting off the streets and having sex with one guy you know is probably better than having sex with multiple guys you don't.

'Advocates' is a polite way of saying 'people who earn a living by exploiting the misery of others'.

There are certainly decent people in the homeless-industrial complex. But there are also a lot of sleazy people. You're just looking at them from the wrong side.

The key takeaway here is that if you plan on reporting on homelessness, you need to be very skeptical. Many of the visible homeless will lie to you just to get what they need from you. Many of the people who work with the homeless will puff themselves up in front of you while exploiting and mistreating the vulnerable people they supposedly care for.

When people complain about 'fossil fuel subsidies', they're normally complaining about the fact that oil companies need to pay massive public use fees for activities that would be free if they weren't oil companies or that they receive tax benefits available to any commercial interest (including wind and solar). Which stretches the definition of 'subsidy' to the breaking point.

If you want a legitimately 'new technology', you'd be spending on your money on nuclear. Due to the heavy regulation of nuclear activities, government action is necessary in this field (solar/wind can be developed independently of government and without subsidies) and the potential upside is massive compared to the small incremental improvements possible with solar/wind.
