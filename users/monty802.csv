selfimprovement,ff0iqhx,t3_er22mx,1579469222.0,"I have been in those shoes as many of us have, but you have to remember who is in control of your life. Water is the biggest necessity, but also slowly cutting down on the pot, would help dramatically. Working out would be another great step, but baby steps at first, and try rewarding yourself for cleaning, like wait to smoke until you get certain things done, it will give you a great feeling of accomplishment and the smoke will be that much better. Initially cleaning is no fun but after you get into the rhythms of it, it will be a force of habit. Working your way up to drinking your body weight in ounces of water a day is a great goal to have, but baby steps at first will go a long way."

It has helped me get motivated, and focused on what matters to me and my life. Not sure if it is any help or not but just my two cents🙏"
