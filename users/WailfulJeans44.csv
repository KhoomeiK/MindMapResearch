I would probably do much better without SBMM, because I won't get flogged by level 200s. The only reason I survive most of the time is because of luck and having some level 200s on my team.

1. All and all pretty good english
2. Handled yourself well in this situation
3. Worked hard and nearly completed making the game(???)
4. Didn't destroy that excuse of a person afterward
5. Didn't have a backup.

Next time save it on two or three disks."
elonmusk,fdfbjls,t1_fdf0i7b,1578357812.0,"Honestly. Everything argued here is irrelevant in the long run. No, electric cars won't solve climate change or global warming whichever one you want to call it. Electric cars are only going to be that hairdryer up against the flooded basement. But did anyone think of uranium? I know some people think that it's worse the coal but in reality, your wrong. Yes nuclear energy has risks but so does everything. Anotherthing, for a sidenot, is to gradually introduce renewables instead of trying to make it happen all at once. Imagine governments having time to prepare long-term goals for renewable energy, and then being able to apply them. These two things would save the world.
Also, please find a way to help the firefighters of Australia. My country really needs all the help it can get right now. Thank you."
