edit: report says ""BDNF Val/Met PGx Association: Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a protein involved in neuronal development and neural plasticity. This genotype is associated with impaired function of this protein. Exercise has been linked to improvements in cognition and stress response with the Met allele being associated with a more pronounced response, possibly relating to the fact that physical activity has been observed to directly increase circulating levels of BDNF. This genotype has been associated with ethnicity-dependent improvements in standardized depression scores with certain medications."""

Thanks to some online snooping and poor redaction consistency through my adoption paperwork, I found what I thought was their address and I anonymously sent a 23andMe kit to their house. It got returned, unopened and unused. I thought maybe if they got one for free they would take it and then we could connect casually at first through that website. But they rejected the package. I mean, maybe it was the wrong address, the internet is sometimes wrong (shocker), but it felt like another mini-rejection. Yeah, they didn’t know it was from me, but still it felt that way.
