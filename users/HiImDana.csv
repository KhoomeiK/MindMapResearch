pregnant,ff95rtb,t1_ff4wmu2,1579705502.0,"I got a accused of being pregnant many times when I wasn't. The response was ""oh you just have that pregnancy glow!""

...that's sweat Susan. Thanks.

Oh my favorite though when I was pregnant..
""You dont look pregnant. You just look wide.""
Thanks Judy. You're a peach."
TwoXChromosomes,ff4mkd3,t1_ff42sw0,1579567247.0,I pay $650 a month for 8 days a month of daycare. I literally can no longer afford hobbies. Its depressing as fuck.
pregnant,ff4m9t3,t3_erk0rx,1579567040.0,"Stranger: Oh my god! When are you due? Boy or girl? Are you going to breast feed? Have you been drinking caffeine? Are you excited? I didnt want to find out what MY baby was.

Me: üòê"
beyondthebump,ff2uf05,t3_erbhaj,1579524574.0,As a mom of a 9 month old little boy my stomach dropped watching this. I would have turned my ass around too. I'm physically nauseous. Why be a nanny uf you dont whole heartedly love children. Ugh. So glad I have great daycare that let's me see them on camera or pop in any time.
datingfails,fe66few,t3_enxhri,1578882836.0,I obviously dont know the whole story but she might have been just looking for casual dating rather than a relationship? There is nothing wrong or manipulative about that unless she was just going on dates with you and otherwise not communicating with you which doesn't seem to be the case. I'm unsure why having a couple different guys shes seeing casually is an issue if she isn't in an exclusive relationship with any of them. Maybe we need more information on why she is a terrible person. What did she do to lead you on? I'm wondering if this is just miscommunication or misunderstanding intentions.
MadeMeSmile,fe61bix,t3_ennowk,1578879572.0,I love this so much I'm misty eyed. I've watched it 7 time.
AskReddit,fe60vhb,t3_ennt1q,1578879284.0,Probably just a loop of a baby crying and or dogs barking. I'd then connect every 2-4 hours of the night waking him up with baby cries.
pregnant,fe5ph7m,t3_enopqc,1578872577.0,"I too had a very wild active moving baby boy. They commented on it often during ultrasound and even had a couple techs give up on imaging because he wouldn't stay still long enough to get good pictures. So difficult that they were off on the estimate of my baby's size by almost 4 pounds. Unfortunately the movement wasn't as cute at 34 weeks when I had lightning crotch with the kicks to the cervix. Sex was almost painful. Gonna have to rely in that other sexy time stuff which isn't all bad. 

Good news is my baby was pretty chill until he hit almost 6 months! Good luck momma!"
Parenting,fe5om3s,t3_enlvnp,1578872259.0,"Just worrying as much as you do shows how great of a father you are. I'm a mom to an 8 month old boy and even with help it isn't easy. I have no idea what I'm doing either most of the time. 

All that matters is that you're loving him, spending time with him and providing a loving home for him.
I am a complete stranger and I am so proud of you. I couldn't have done it alone. Not a chance. 

You're amazing. You'll be his hero always."
middlechild,fe5n25x,t3_entxuk,1578871545.0,"I remember being a kid and my grandma got my younger sister a real gold charm bracelet. It was so pretty. She didnt get one for me. She gave me a pair of plastic dress up high heels that my younger sister was done playing with.

Love being a middle."
clevercomebacks,fe43ma8,t1_fe3yx1v,1578855484.0,Can confirm. My husband is 5'5 and I am 5'7. I didnt even care a little. It bothered him more than it bothered me. He's a kind soul and that's all that matters to me. Legitimately my best friend ever.
beyondthebump,fdlxc08,t3_elvpg0,1578534740.0,I did this exact same thing. I have to do it. I am his mom but I am still a human with needs and the sooner I get passed each challenge the easier my day becomes. I still let him sleep in my arms from time to time but he's a crib boy. He's stayed quietly and comfortably in his car seat for a two hour car ride and he does so well in the stroller at the store. He's eating about 15 different baby foods. I'm legitimately proud of myself for finding the strength to put myself back together after feeling like I completely lost who I was when I had a baby. Way to go mommas! We got this.
AskReddit,fdlvlf5,t3_elu6v5,1578533538.0,Eating super sugary cereals. Cinnamon toast crunch and captain crunch berries forever.
absolutelynotmeirl,fdca2sh,t1_fdc6g2m,1578270094.0,I ordered a mcdouble once and they didn't forget one patty but BOTH patties. I got a bun with cheese and condiments.
absolutelynotmeirl,fdc8xwt,t1_fdbvpiq,1578269429.0,"I loved when I went there the first time they gave me two of every single sauce they had so I could figure out what I liked. I also love when young people are forced to say ""It was my pleasure"" and you can tell by the look in their eye that they are dead inside."
absolutelynotmeirl,fdc8s76,t1_fdc2ysw,1578269337.0,Lucky! I'm sad ours are so terrible. They sometimes will randomly close and just tape a piece of paper on the drive up order box saying closed. They've kept my debit card before and claimed to have given it back. They just last week charged my husband for two jr bacon cheeseburgers and didn't put them in with the food. I love wendy's so much too. Spicy chicken is like my favorite chicken sandwich. I dont know what it is about wendy's spicy chicken specifically but I'm obsessed and have been for 15 years. It used to be great when I was a teenager.
slowcooking,fdb7q5r,t3_ekfjtp,1578254721.0,"Oh my god. My mom used to make me this as a kid and it was one of my absolute favorite meals. I've asked her 100 times for the recipe she used as an adult and she always says ""if you come over I'll make it for you."" It's been 10 years and I still haven't gotten it. Thanks for reminding me so I can make it my damb self."
niceguys,fdb28e0,t3_eketra,1578252911.0,I am horrified.
workingmoms,fdazscs,t3_ek85if,1578252154.0,"My son is 8 months old. I had the same struggle. I LOVE my job. I love my patients. I love the people I work with. I've excelled in this career for years and almost dreaded maternity leave because I have so many extra responsibilities that I had to trust others to take on. When I got to the 6 weeks until return mark I was crying every single day telling my husband I didn't want someone else to raise my son. I missed working so much but caring for my son was so much more fulfilling. 

The best advice I can give you even though it may sound stupid is take it one day at a time. Dont count down your days. Dont spend time full of dread and anxiety. Just enjoy your little one. Honestly when I got back to work I didn't miss a beat. After about two weeks I was really happy to be back. I missed my baby so much every single day but work is mine. Work is where I go and get to be me. Not just ""his mom"" or ""his wife."" At work I am me, I love my job and I excel. It's not just to financially support him. It's a part of who I am that I love.

I'm not going to lie to you. I held my baby boy for 12   hours the day before I went back and cried nearly the entire time. I got ready to go to work sobbing. Every time someone  brought him up I would cry. It's been 5 months since I went back and I am so happy. He actually loves daycare. He smiles huge when I drop him off. I get art projects and get to see him interact with other babies. It's great in a different way. 

I also asked if I could return to work doing half days for the first week. It made the transition easier and made it easier to figure out a pumping schedule.

Good luck momma. It's not easy but it's worth it. ‚ù§"
pregnant,fdahvp2,t3_ekax1z,1578246265.0,Hopefully she makes her debut soon!! What a great way to start the new year. Congratulations!
absolutelynotmeirl,fdah1t3,t3_ekca4s,1578246045.0,"Unsure if this is just my area but here is a list I have put together of fast food places and how often they get food correct from least often to most often. This includes places I pick up from without drive thru.

insaneparents,fda8r05,t1_fcodca3,1578243095.0,"My dad did this exact same shit. He would be extremely verbally abusive and call me a trailer trash whore (I was 13) ""like my mother"" and tell me I'm not even his. He then has the fucking audacity to post on Facebook that my sister and I ABANDONED HIM and that he doesn't want us to contact him for also acknowledging our step dad on father's day even though our step dad helped financially and emotionally supported us since we were toddlers. My dad paid child support for only a few years until he lied and said he was unemployed so he couldn't pay in court. He made more than my mom and step dad combined. He then pretends briefly that nothing happened. Then returns to toxicity and the cycle continues. Ugh. So sorry you have to deal with this. Its exhausting."
insaneparents,fda1fzr,t1_fcvi3wt,1578240608.0,My dad is the same.. I wouldn't be at all surprised though if I had siblings all over the country that I didn't know about.
insaneparents,fd9mqge,t3_eka54x,1578235411.0,"My mom was a lot like this when I was an adult still living at home, going to college and working full timr. I once stayed at a boyfriends house because it was pouring with tornado warnings. She insisted I still drive home at 2am in the pitch black with rain and tornados. My boyfriend lived an hour away.

 She would say ""This isn't a flop house!"" It was pretty exhausting to deal with. It was ok for me to sleep in my car in the college parking lot between work and class (I worked over nights) but not my boyfriends house. After I turned 21 it got worse. She did NOT want me to go out. When I was 23 I met my now husband and i was so anxious about dealing with my mom when I wanted to stay at his place. It irritated him and we argued about it. Eventually I stayed after 3 months of dating. Her attitude did not change for about 6 months when I eventually put my foot down. I basically told her I would be buying a house and moving out as soon as possible if she was going to treat me like a child. She didn't think I would. Well I did and immediately upon moving in my now husband moved in with me. He even came with to sign my closing papers. Five and a half years later I'm so glad I moved out when I did. I wish I would have done it sooner. 

The thing is it really wasn't about sleeping in the same bed because I was more than honest about my sex life with her. It was just about control which I think makes it worse. To this day our relationship is strained. I dont think it will ever recover."
insaneparents,fd9i7ai,t1_fd9gzl9,1578233654.0,r/petty_revenge I love it.
breastfeeding,fd9esp0,t3_ek7jyb,1578232434.0,Yay!!! It's such an exciting thing when the ounces start to compound like that. Breastfeeding is such a struggle yet so rewarding.
TwoXChromosomes,fd5xhl9,t1_fd47eni,1578182737.0,"This. So much. Abortions aren't a trend. They're a life altering, emotionally draining and sometimes traumatic medical procedure. People focus so much on the kids that aren't yet born and dont even think twice about the ones already alive and suffering."
UpliftingNews,fd5rnfx,t1_fd37hnx,1578180720.0,I completely agree. I was fortunate enough go get 6 weeks paid leave. I ended up having a second surgery 10 days following c section. My husband took 4 weeks unpaid. I took an additional 6 weeks unpaid. At 6 weeks I was still pretty exhausted and in pain following my surgeries. I still had weight restrictions for lifting. We need to work on maternal AND paternal leave. Present parents raise better kids. By present I mean available and attentive. I think if dads had more time to bond and care for their children it would completley change the parenting game and societal expectations of parenting roles. I think maternity and paternity leave should be 3 months across the board paid and up to an additional 3 months unpaid.

creepyPMs,fc7zb5o,t1_fby46zt,1577522657.0,I‚Äôve cuddled with male and female friends since before I was even a teenager. I have a huge extremely affectionate family. I‚Äôve always been a hug and snuggle person. I‚Äôd be devastated if someone I was friends with interpreted my snuggliness for anything other than a sign of our emotional closeness as friends. If I am snuggling with someone I trust them and assume they know me well enough to know that is who I am. I had a male best friend for ten years. We snuggled all the time when we hung out. I even kissed him on the cheek every time I left his house. I did the same for my closest female friends. Nothing ever happened. No expectations were there. If there were my heart would have broke right then. It saddens me that some people can‚Äôt express emotionally close friendships in physical ways. Why does everything have to be sexual? Why can‚Äôt people just love and care about people as humans?
creepyPMs,fc7ybm8,t1_fbycrqo,1577521891.0,Just the fact that he is asking her while she is in a relationship if she is leaving that relationship is gross. The wording just makes it worse.
