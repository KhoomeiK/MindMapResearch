worldnews,ff3aos4,t1_ff3963o,1579537514.0,"No, you came right out of the gate with asking how we punish our criminals without the prison system and it made me realize nothing I can say will change your mind. Most of the people in prison *should not* be in prison. The attitude that punishment should have precedence over rehabilitation is one of the root problems of our prison system. The whole system is basically designed to encourage recidivism to ensure the for profit prison system will always be making big money. The US prison system allows for what is essentially legal slavery, but i don't expect any of this to change your opinions so i would much rather spend that time explaining it to someone who has not already made up their mind."

stephenking,fct3jcr,t3_eiro0w,1577931947.0,"Over 99% of the population died, like you said towing probably was not at the top of the list of priorities. The disease moved very quickly for many once they were infected. It's not unthinkable that many, many people succumbed to captain trips while waiting in traffic and others were just too sick and desperate to do anything about the cars in front of them. So they abandoned their vehicles to continue on foot futher exacerbating the traffic jams. I also always got the impression that the ""military""(The Shop) killed *a lot* of fleeing survivors both sick and uninfected as they tried in vain to contain the outbreak."
