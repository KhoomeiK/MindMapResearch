>>>It isn't...

Okay, then- if abortion isn't your only concern, you have an abundance of reasons to support someone else: starting pointless trade wars, ballooning the national debt to give massive tax cuts to the rich, lining his own pockets with taxpayer money to play golf, pissing off and abandoning our closest allies, rolling back environmental regulations and undermining international cooperation on climate change, separating child refugees from their parents and locking them in cages, backing out of a nuclear agreement Iran was adhering to and needlessly escalating tensions by assassinating their second in command, selling arms and nuclear reactors to Saudi Arabia, pissing off the international community by moving the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, sharing classified information with Russia, taking Putin's word over the consensus of our intelligence agencies, withholding aid from a strategic ally in exchange for investigation of a political rival, letting his children, his son-in-law, and his personal lawyer engage in diplomacy, running a complete shit-show of an administration with a revolving-door cabinet and leaving numerous departments with only ""acting"" heads, repeatedly speaking/tweeting/behaving in ways that are utterly undignified and embarrassing for the nation... and, shit, that's just the tip of the iceberg...

>Because outlawing abortion will not prevent abortions from happening

>>Yes it will

There were [roughly 130k](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2133995?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) illegal abortions performed annually pre-*Roe v Wade* and that was with it being legal in New York, Washington, and Alaska, and also with 12 more states where it was legal if the doctor determined that a pregnancy endangered the woman's health (no doubt many people could find a sympathetic doctor willing to find a reason to claim their health is in danger, and many such doctors would be around otherwise). 

And how exactly would such a law be enforced, anyway? How would the government distinguish between, say, a procedure to remove a precancerous lesion from a surgical abortion performed midway through the first trimester? How is the government even going to know a woman was pregnant to begin with?

>If you create a unique human life through your agency over your body then you can't blame the government for the outcome.

Ah! The good 'ol ""if you don't want a baby, don't have sex"" argument. That's a good one.

>It is the government's responsibility to protect innocent lives.

Above, I said midway through the first trimester because [nearly 2/3](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/ss/ss6811a1.htm) of abortions are performed before the 9th week of gestation. At that point, a fetus is roughly [the size and weight of a raspberry](https://www.thebump.com/pregnancy-week-by-week/8-weeks-pregnant). You might believe that counts as ""a life"" that merits all the protections of the government, but a good half of the country does not agree.

You'd have to be pretty dense to believe a raspberry-sized blob of human tissue deserves such protection to merit violating people's privacy, forcing a woman to have a child she doesn't want and/or doesn't deem herself ready to have, electing a completely unfit craven jackass to the most powerful office in the world... all so that raspberry can be born into a family that doesn't want them.

>>Because improving sex education, access to contraceptives, and social services is more likely to actually reduce the number of abortions

>I'm pro all of those things

Then you'll be dismayed to know that, among other things, Trump has populated the Department of Health and Human Services with [proponents of abstinence-only sex ed](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/377304-abstinence-only-education-making-a-comeback-under-trump), [attempted to cut over $200m](https://rewire.news/article/2018/08/10/trump-administration-will-continue-teen-pregnancy-prevention-program-after-all/) in funding to teen pregnancy prevention programs, allowed states to enact rules to [restrict](https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-medicaid-work-20180907-story.html) poor people's access to medicaid, allowed insurance companies to sell worthless [short-term](https://www.omaha.com/livewellnebraska/health/critics-consumers-should-be-wary-of-short-term-health-plans/article_acc1d584-6236-5b96-a0f2-7b2f34644b5e.html) plans, cut subsidies for ACA plans which [drastically raised](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-rule-changes-expected-to-raise-obamacare-health-insurance-premiums-2019-01-18) premiums, and is [trying its damnedest](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2019/what-recent-federal-courts-rulings-contraception-mean-us-womens-health) to allow employers' to deny their employees coverage for contraception.

I dunno... Because maybe abortion shouldn't be the sole issue deciding your vote? Because outlawing abortion will not prevent abortions from happening, yet would set a precedent of government invasion of doctor-patient privacy and deprive women of agency over their own bodies? Because improving sex education, access to contraceptives, and social services is more likely to actually reduce the number of abortions (things these same ""pro-life"" people generally oppose)? Because the Republicans, for all their talk, recognize that abortion will get morons like you to go along with whatever agenda they really care about and would be absolute fools to give up such a valuable political tool by actually following through with it?

>At a depth of 5 feet (1.5 m), the lateral pressure of grain, as experimentally measured by load cells placed against bin walls, is 0.73–1.02 pounds per square inch (5–7 kPa); at 40 feet (12 m) it is 2.9–4.4 psi (20–30 kPa), which appears to be its maximum.

That may not sound like much, but we're talking a grain bin that might be 20-50' high and 30-45' in diameter holding 10-70k bushels of grain. Adding a door big enough to release such a massive volume quickly enough to be of any use would be adding a big failure point and significant cost just to be prepared for an occurrence which should be fairly easily preventable."

Gold's value is not because of its physical properties or utility, though- more of it is mined all the time and most of it is kept as bullion. Platinum is far rarer, *at least* as useful, and yet it costs 2/3 as much per ounce. Gold's value is still largely determined by fiat, it's just for historical and cultural reasons it's more universally recognized as valuable. If, for whatever reason, people quit believing that and its price were determined by its industrial value, it would not be worth all that much.

I mean, if the shit *really* hit the fan and society collapsed, you'd probably have some people wanting to hoard it in the hope that they'd be rich when civilization returned, but of more immediate value would be food, water, and guns. And land, especially arable land with a reliable source of water on it... but then all of those are only ""yours"" so far as people agree that you own them or you can defend them from those who don't.
