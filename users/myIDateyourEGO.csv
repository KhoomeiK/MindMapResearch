Education.

Boomers. Boomers reaped all the benefits then voted against all the stuff that gave it to them. They voted against the social programs that helped keep their own broke ass families afloat, their parents afloat, or founded after their parents suffered in the depression.

It aint education. Or life expectancy. Crime and safety? Nope. It aint health, or mortality rates. It isn't happiness.

Because I? What?

Have made it clear I absolutely respect victims who are preyed upon, I just don't make excuses for those that - yes - ask for it.

Ask for it.

Ask for it.

NOT like a woman JUST attending a party - to disarm your generic bullshit because you're afraid of a grown-up discussion.

NOT like a woman who engages equally in the right to have a few drinks...

But a woman...

Who walked into an industry...

That literally mocks the abuse of women...

And got abused.

And I'm evil.... why?

Because I don't tolerate you doing fucking nothing real?

Because I don't allow you to equate her to a violent rape victim who was randomly snatched? A child molested by a loved one? A woman drugged and incapacitated?

Come on - answer on point, you fucking coward - why?

Because I ACTUALLY hold her accountable for bad choices and stupid ideas and beliefs?

Someone who puts the needle in their arm for a good time is not the same addict as someone who was prescribed opiates they didn't need in the boom.

This woman is not the same as SO, SO many other victims.

She got there 100% because of her own choice.

She walked into an industry that openly mocks and belittles women.

Why do you think she should have expected different?

Come on - answer.

You can't. You won't. Because you know this is legit.

So - like I said - get off your lazy, do-nothing ass. And do something to actually help women in need.

Because I do. 

And I'm sure I've helped some fucking idiots in my day.

But it makes me happier that I also know I helped people whose shit choices DIDN'T contribute as much to their circumstances.

Now - come on - grow a spine and answer on point:

What the fuck are you going to do to help this person who CLEARLY is in a much worse spot than this one incident who - clearly - from her own post hangs around with some shit people?

You gonna mentor her? Chip in on her education? You gonna help her with her bills?

No. You're gonna post a meme though, aren't you, you big, brave hero!

Go fuck yourself. You disrespect other victims by equating her to them. Now if you care so much, do something, you lazy shit.

My history reads like a manifesto who is tired of weak ass people making excuses for shit and acting like they believe in things they don't do a fucking bit in their life to represent. Go fuck yourself.

It's not all the same - she'd be find with more responsible choices. She didn't JUST go to a party and get raped, JUST go on a date, or JUST be sleeping in her bed when Uncle came in half-drunk and horny...

Oh no - she walked up to that black fucking couch, signed a release. Thinking she had ""ownership"" of her sexuality going to a couch and a place where they brag and broadcast how it's torn from you.

Stop disrespecting THOSE victims by being so fucking incapable of honesty that you think this lady bears ZERO responsibility.

Putting a needle in your arm aint the same as getting hooked after a scrip you never needed.

You know what it represents?

They tell you they'll exploit you, abuse you - they don't value you - they broadcast it and brag about it and glorify it.

So yeah - this lady and the same as someone drugged or violently raped.

What happened to her? Wouldn't have happened had she not walked up to that couch like a fucking idiot.

Cuz that's what this shit was.

She went in looking to fuck for money on tape and then it wasn't all sweet and respectful like her stupid ass thought it was going to be.

She aint the same.

So - one more time - what the fuck are you doing to help her out of what is CLEARLY a much more bad life situation than this?

Nothing is the answer. So shut up with your fake fucking tears and your agenda.

And stop devaluing people that didn't do a fucking thing to increase their odds of being victimized by equating them to this fucking idiot.

The entire industry SCREAMS abuse and devaluation and exploitation, you fucking idiot. Stop putting all that on everyone else and, instead, get off your lazy ass and reach out and offer to get her off of whatever path she's on she ended up there - clearly either desperate or fucking stupid.

So - what are you gonna do?

Nothing. You won't do fucking shit. But you'll type to me, loser.

And you'll devalue little girls and little boys and raped women - violently raped women who were minding their own business - because YOU are incapable of requiring responsibility and good decision making. YOU are unable to accept she walked into a stupid fucking situation and should have known better. YOU haven't done and won't do shit for her. YOU haven't done and won't do shit for anyone else.

But you like reddit, huh?

Unlike SO, SO many victims of rape, sexual assault, sexual abuse - she did a fucking ton to make her odds of being a victim far higher.

You ask her yet what kind of research she did into the company before walking and offering to fuck for money?

Do it. Because the answer is gonna be fucking zero. Don't tell me that shit doesn't matter. Don't tell me she's the same as people who just get fucking grabbed and raped.

Fuck that shit. Get off your lazy ass and offer to help her with something that gets her off this shit track she's CLEARLY on. Nothing in that post says ""my life is in order.""

Are you gonna do a damn thing to help or not? 

Come on. Do something real. 

Or can't you spare enough of your football watching time - which is clearly a fucking ton - to do anything besides post on the internet like a do-nothing judgmental shit?

That's right. Get off your lazy fucking ass and do something. You want her shit to be better? 

DO something. Besides ACTUALLY be the up-vote hunting,  desperate for internet friends, big-mouthed but-idle handed couch-potato you are.

Someone who picks up the needle aint the same as someone hooked of a prescription they never really needed.

Someone who stupidly walks into the black couch room that literally exists to mock that experience... is not the same as a girl grabbed while jogging.

IAmA,fc2iti2,t1_fc16ky6,1577362496.0,"Look - let me tell you what I see here.

A bunch of people crying ""you're a victim"" and offering a shoulder to cry on - not a lot of people offering to help her stop what is CLEARLY a pattern of poor decision making leading to her problems.

SHE - WAS - NOT - VIOLENTLY - RAPED - BY - A - RANDOM - ATTACKER

She wasn't date raped or incapacitated with drugs or alcohol.

She wasn't molested by a trusted, loved family member.

What she did - was walk into an industry that LITERALLY - as in the literal use of the word LITERALLY - mocks the victimization of women as a core component of its market place.

That black couch? It's a warning sign to anyone with intelligence and responsible thought processes. Sorry - that is a SIMPLE TRUTH. All the porn the belittles and diminishes women?

IT'S A CLUE.

All of it. The lack of an average sized dick? Every single woman having to be reamed by some massive cock? That should be a fucking clue.

ALL OF IT - THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY - IS A CLUE

The people who try to do it ""right?""

They go out of business, they have no marketplace, their shit doesn't sell enough to pay the bills.

None of you are offering to help her change that shitty way of thinking that made her think she would - somehow - be different. Special. Going into porn isn't taking ownership of your body or your sexuality, not in the context of the marketplace.

Do you REALLY think a lot of research was done before she walked into that dimly lit porno office? You REALLY wanna go out on that limb. There wasn't.

She's - obviously - surrounding herself with shit people. She - obviously - doesn't have, or hasn't worked towards, a lot of options. This may be a result of a lot of things, INCLUDING weaknesses of HERS.

She is not the same as all other rape victims.

She walked into the bear den with a steak suit on. Now - are you going to get off your ass - you or most the other ""waaaaaaaaahhhhhhh"" people who are JUST providing sympathy - and help her get her life on track, REDUCING her exposure to shit people, REDUCING her need or, possibly inability to aspire to more right now, resulting in having to do porn? 

What are you going to do to make sure this doesn't happen to her again?

Come on - answer - on point.

Here's what I do, for all my judgmental shit:

I take supplies to our homeless shelters locally, including a woman's DV shelter. They are distributed without judgment. But those women ALL have different stories. Homeless people? They ALL have different stories. Homelessness is like sexual assault - sometimes you do a lot more than the person next to you to get you there. Like going into the porn industry like an idiot. Because no one should. Ever. 

It's the difference between a party-person who picks up a needle - and an addict who was prescribed opiates by their doctor. 

What I'm asking you - pointedly - is more than some deflective ""oh look, it's JUST a bad guy"" bullshit - what the fuck are you GOING TO DO?

Nothing is the answer so far.

Now - get off your ass and go volunteer. Go take some shit to some needy people. Be a mentor to you young girls.

Oh - here's a shocker? While I haven't found one in my new place of residence I like - I was, for a decade, part of a young men's mentor program helping at-risk young men in which I, directly, on-point, addressed some of life's hardest shit.

And one of em? Was ACTUALLY respecting women. But one of the other one's? Personal responsibility. These kids?

Some of them had done a LOT MORE of their own accord to land where they landed. Life is complicated. Shit aint black and white.

Grow up and keep your mouth shut until you and all your big-mouthed ""come cry with me"" friends are gonna help this girl out instead of enjoying the ""I feel good"" selfish return of anonymous internet shoulder-offering.

Send her a PM and train her to code. Or is a little bit of your direct, applied time too much to ask, huh?

Because if you'd shut the fuck up for 30 seconds and read her post with even a BIT of critical thinking - what you'd see, clearly, is someone in a MUCH bigger bad spot than ""I was raped after I willingly offered myself up on a platter to porno people with a history of exploiting and abusing women.""

Not a federal government? But a world changing around them in which states had been abolishing for decades and working to the things our Constitution allows - being gimped, by fear on both sides of losing the fight, by things like the Missouri compromise that - for the sake of slavery - also gimped growth of the Union by forcing balance?

It was about slavery. It was about sick, broken people and their sick, broken culture.

They were not heroic defenders of freedom because they explicitly and purposefully denied it to people based on the color of their skin. Forever. Enshrined in their holy founding documents. 

They were racist - cowardly - slaver trash.

Two slave states remained in the Union - they understood the end of that institution was coming. The free counties? Were enemies of the Confederacy despite ACTUALLY holding to individual freedom beliefs... only they dared include black folks, the cardinal sin.

Look - I am sorry for whatever twisted shit you've been fed. I'm sorry for whatever moral failing YOU, as an individual have, for wasting your time and energy for even a MOMENT trying to argue these racist slaver motherfuckers were liberty-lovers - that is, on it's a face, a farce.
