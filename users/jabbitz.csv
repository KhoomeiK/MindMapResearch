ETA on a serious(ish) note, seeing as we’re talking Sovcit ideology and habeus corpus, when I was working in a registry this sovcit got arrested for contempt (if I remember correctly he used a lot of colourful language in court) so his sovcit mates came and filed a habeus corpus application. However, seeing as it was just a small contempt issue by the time they filed it he was getting release anyway so all these morons took that to mean their application was successful and they had a great time floating about beating the system. Very frustrating."

I might not be answering your question properly but the main take away from this person’s transcript was that if you think you need support ask for it. Worst case it’ll get turned down but most unis have a bunch of different ways they can help you out if you’re struggling for whatever reason and there’s no shame in asking.

auslaw,fed4vfs,t1_fed4hzl,1578998974.0,"Well, I’m medicated now ha but if I’m really busy or stressed the medication is not as helpful. I have to be realistic in what I can handle, basically. I have to find whatever process works for me and stick to it. And I also made an effort to go above and beyond with the tasks I knew I was strong with. Is there anyone else in your office other than the solicitor? It helped for me to have a second set of eyes just on tasks that I knew I had a tendency to miss little details on, without nagging them about everything tiny thing. Like you said yourself, if you overthink things you spend too much time on things you really don’t need to. The handwritten journal was really the best thing for me at the end of the day. I would get a few tasks done, then I could flick back and check if there was anything from say, the week before, that I hadn’t crossed off and work out where that was. 

It also helped me to just change my perspective about my role. I didn’t realise how much my boss was relying on me to be on top of things. Once that became more clear I was able to really focus on that being kind of a competition to me. Always being one step ahead. It’s much easier for me to focus on something if I can find a way to make it feel like a a game or a competition or something.

auslaw,fed4ai8,t3_eoi8t9,1578998125.0,"Have been in this position, having adhd doesn’t exactly help. If you want to keep this job, you need to find ways to work these issues out. I hung a little neon banner thing above my keyboard for a mistake I made regularly until I stopped doing it, I always have a handwritten notepad of my tasks as well as bring ups in outlook because I know, for me, actually writing things down and crossing off a physical list is much more helpful than a bunch of notifications on my computer, i identified what tasks would have the biggest consequences for fuck ups and focused my attention on them rather then double handing everything. 

If you’re putting all these little systems in place and still making the same mistakes, the top commenter might be right, it’s maybe just not the place for you right now. In law, people are looking for little mistakes. Not everyone is an arsehole that will take advantage but a typo on a document that is *clearly* a typo can end up costing a firm/client a lot of money if someone wants to fight over it, so the reality is that details matter. 

Details aren’t my strong suit and I have to work hard at things like that and remember to slow down and read things properly. I also have a lot of strengths though, so whatever happens remember those. If you can work on the problem and improve it - great. If it doesn’t work out, don’t get torn up about that when you probably have a lot of positive to focus on."

AmIBeingTooSensitive,feb01rp,t1_fe78drv,1578954057.0,"To be totally blunt, at this point it’s not so much being too sensitive as opposed to being a little self centred. I’m assuming you’re much younger than me (I’m 35) so don’t take offence to that, most young people are self centred. For example, I still have an unread DM on fb that has been there since yesterday afternoon. I’m not angry at the girl I haven’t replied to, she doesn’t annoy me, I just have a lot going on. I had a really terrible day at work yesterday and I’m looking forward to another mentally draining day, today. I just don’t have the energy to give her message the reply it deserves. Im choosing to come back to it when I can reply properly and not like a tired, grumpy bitch because that’s just where my head space is right now. Sometimes I send a message on the train on the way to work and then I get to work and just can’t reply anymore.

He would be going through RA even if he thinks there’s no change you’ll mediate because to start proceedings there needs to have been an attempt to mediate or the mediator can issue a certificate indicating that either a party didn’t attend or that the matter wasn’t appropriate to mediate. It might be worth getting back to the RA person and letting them know you’re situation. They might agree that it’s not appropriate to mediate. That still means he gets his certificate and can file proceedings though, so as the other commenter said, start preparing evidence of any abuse/manipulation etc in case he does.  Typically, grandparents will only get awarded any kind of visitation if they’ve been a part of the child’s life. Having said that, there is a level of discretion in family court so even though it’s unlikely that they would push a kid to spend time with a stranger, blood relative or not, it wouldn’t hurt to have all your ducks in a row.

Granted, I have minimal understanding of human rights law because I am the worst student ever but this to me looks like Iran covering its butt for being sanctioned later if they take more aggressive action. The UN charter (iirc) encourages parties to negotiate before taking aggressive action. This just seems to me like a box that Iran can say they checked before moving forward"
worldnews,fd0lkhc,t1_fcyo927,1578120523.0,"So, I have been studying human rights law (but am very behind, so am probably completely wrong here) but my understanding is that you can take more aggressive actions if all other possible options have been exhausted. Is it possible that this is Iran’s way of covering their own arse from breaking international law by showing that they took a less aggressive approach in the first instance and that was denied by the US?

Edit - I should also add I’ve been drinking FWIW"
worldnews,fd0jf11,t1_fd0jd1c,1578119684.0,Noted with thanks.

worldnews,fd0gxam,t1_fd0crak,1578118625.0,"First of all, the wording “hiding behind the troops” was picked up from the commenter before me. Secondly, sentiments similar to yours have already been responded to so you’re welcome to find those comments for yourself"
worldnews,fczirof,t1_fczhxgs,1578102152.0,Haha thanks. But I’m pretty sure I would fail any psych test! I actually looked into reserves over a decade ago and remember thinking that the maths test for the position I would have wanted to go for looked hard haha

worldnews,fczbb2b,t1_fcza8b8,1578097463.0,This is why I drew the parallel with scomo. No one thought scomo being in Australia was going to magically make the fires stop. No one even expected him to go out and fight them but I do think you have an obligation as a world leader to show some kind of empathy for the affect your actions have on your people or some kind of solidarity. I think scomo being on holiday was a slap in the face to Australians and I think tweeting an American flag from the comfort of your golf resort is a slap in the face to the American people. At least pretend to have some respect for the gravity of the situation.
worldnews,fczaxus,t1_fcza8bz,1578097244.0,I was going to add this also but couldn’t remember their title and was too lazy to google first thing in the morning haha thanks for adding!
worldnews,fcz7haw,t1_fcz7ami,1578095222.0,"Which part of my comment makes me sound scared? I was meaning to convey disappointment, not fear. Maybe I should have been more clear re: “the rest of the world is shitting it’s pants”. That was intended to refer to world leaders/allies reaction. Maybe it was a bit hyperbolic. Does that clear things up for you?"
worldnews,fcz7bnx,t1_fcz7803,1578095132.0,No probs! I think this is actually a good demonstration of how the internet *should* work.

worldnews,fcyuqzm,t1_fcymzh0,1578087512.0,"Hiding behind his troops - from his Florida resort, no less. As an Australian, we’ve had to see our spineless PM think his Hawaii holiday was more important than being with his people while their homes burned. Now you’ve got trump potentially starting wars that none of his family members will have to fight in from the comfort of his Florida resort and while the world is shitting their pants he’s probably got another round of golf lined up

Edit: fixed a word"
