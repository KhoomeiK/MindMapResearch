Damnthatsinteresting,fee5x63,t1_fee10lb,1579027062.0,"This right here. The US healthcare system is flawed and people are being exploited.  The system finally dropped the penalty for not having insurance tho

Just so that people know, Americans can choose a private health plan ranging from $30 to $1400+ PER MONTH.  Basically, the more you pay monthly, the better your coverage and the smaller out-of-pocket to pay.  Mind you, we are still being taxed per paycheck to social services. 

MedQuest or medicare is a government funded free medical coverage for those who qualify. The qualifications vary by state. 

Also in some states, doctors are allowed to do something additional which is sometimes called Concierge MD.  This means that in order for you to see your doctor with an appointment at a certain clinic, office or hospital, you need to drop $3000+ to cover you for the year. 

Mind you, some doctors in some states need to to this in order to pay for their office lease, their staff and maintenance because some private insurance contracts pay doctors the bare minimum for their services.  

I am not a doctor but I work for a few who love to do community service."

Damnthatsinteresting,fee2xko,t1_fee1wko,1579025294.0,"I did not pay all of 10k, because I was eligible for medQuest giving birth. 

However, my uncle did have to pay for both my cousins because he was a business owner. He was a landscaper.  Business owners are sole proprietors and my uncle didn’t realize that his own insurance didn’t cover childbirth and his wife’s complications. 

The first birth had no problems, but the second was a c-section with complications. That was about 15k.

Luckily, the hospital he went to had a financial assistance program to help decrease the amount paid for the use of the hospital rooms ( birthing room, operating room, ICU, recovery room) so he paid about 10k"

The American people need better quality of life and better quality of our surroundings. Not killing our land and allowing big pharma to raise prices of life saving medicines to make a profit. 

I hope every US citizen votes for a president they want.
Please don’t let your right to vote go to waste.

relationship_advice,fcp096h,t1_fcozhr2,1577846534.0,"NTA, while I do side with your wife of not having a large audience with her and babies recovery room at the hospital. I would be cautious with how you word things. She’s most likely going to be worse (emotionally) due to increased weight, pain, and hormones. 

Tell everyone you’d like a Baby Bonding of 2 weeks. Almost everyone will know that this means you want time with just the 3 of you. I hope your family will respect that.

I used to doubt my husband before about his intentions and his love for me.  So you have to remember that the next person you give your heart to is a different person. I know the fear of not being good enough and falling for another abuser. So, I recommend seeing a therapist or try Talkspace a few times to help you navigate your feelings. It is my pleasure to help you. I wish you the best :)"
relationship_advice,fc8gadl,t3_egorvk,1577534260.0,"Please call a trusted friend or family member to arrange for you to stay until you have a place. I say this because being alone in your thoughts isn’t good especially when you’re moving out. 


If you need a self esteem boost/motivation to move on. Try going on a dating app. I was In an abusive relationship a few years back. I was isolated from my friends and family. My friend/coworker made me a Match.com profile with his favorite picture of me. I got so many winks and emails at the end of the day. My friend chose 1 out of the 5 top matches for me to email. We were only supposed to be email penpals, but after 10 emails I broke up with my abuser and went into a relationship with my now husband."

That’s I why I stick to having 2 really good friends. Friendships born from struggling in work and in school together. 


I hope this helps. Good luck"
relationship_advice,fc8bytf,t3_egouy8,1577531475.0,Then couples therapy. First go by yourself. Eventually your therapist will have you invite your wife to a session. It will help as long as you and your wife are still fighting to be married.

He will call and text you to want you back and he’ll say that he changed. It’s not true! It’s all sugar sweet lies. 
These types don’t change over night, heck, he sounds like he hasn’t moved out from his moms house. 

Leave, find your self worth. Love who you are without him. You’ll eventually find someone better. Be brave."
relationship_advice,fc8agsr,t1_fc88qys,1577530513.0,"Ok, sounds serious. And it’s not that you’re selfish. You’re fighting for your relationship. Ask her to attend a couples retreat. Or if you attend church, join a marriage class/group. There’s always couples therapy too.  

Ask her, what changed? Don’t drag it out. Have a real discussion with no excuses. You’re still married and need to resolve it.  If she ignores it, push it. It’s been going on too long."

vagabond,fc897ac,t1_fc87rs6,1577529693.0,"Tbh, It might be difficult as most of the local employees are biased in terms of work ethics/ethnicity.  As long as you show respect to the culture and you’re not too arrogant, you’ll be fine. 

You might fare better in Oahu as it has more mainlanders and bus routes than the other islands. 

I haven’t lived in Kauai, but I know that it rains a lot more than Oahu. So, you might get “rained out” of a construction job more often. 

I recommend that you checkout the hawaii subs to get a feel for the other islands."
relationship_advice,fc87swv,t3_egouy8,1577528796.0,"Your wife is going through hormonal changes where her sexual drive is low. She should come around after your child turns 3.  If you want to speed things up, encourage her to go out walking/exercising with you. 

Disguising some exercise as a date will help her hormones regulate. She won’t have the sex drive prior to baby tho. 

Be patient, play with your wife like how you used to before baby. Help her get rest and take over child care for a day once a week. Take her out on dates with just the 2 of you.

She’ll come around."

I had a BF that would buy me expensive stuff to show he cared. He’d say that he researched for the best one. Totally forgot to ask ME what I’d do with it if he got it for me. We’d argued over it and I finally told him. I don’t like surprises. Sorry, you like surprises huh?"
socialskills,fc7zv10,t3_egnpgd,1577523088.0,"I don’t know what you look like, but you need to stop saying you’re ugly. You’re putting a lot of effort in putting yourself down. Sure one girl honestly said that you’re ugly. She doesn’t speak for all the others. 

I blame mainstream media for the photoshopped lies of how beauty should look. 

Sounds like you need to go on vacation from your self pity. Try going somewhere that is known to have not so good looking people.

Someone once told me that nudist colonies was a good start.

Edit:

I wanted to add that most people don’t fully bloom into the person they’re meant to look like until they’re in their mid 20s. 

High school sucked my first 2.5 years. Focus on developing and building up yourself. You have a free gym, one or two healthy meals (not the tastiest), and free programs to join to get you to interact with other peers. 

If high school doesn’t turn out the way you want it. Aim for something after it. Join Air Guard, be a flight attendant,  or go to college and reinvent yourself. 

Yes, you want to be with someone beautiful or at least on the same level as you to share moments with. I get that. 

The thing is, you’re too focused on the idea that you’ll never get “her”. A girl will eventually come around. In the meantime, focus on you, loving you, and change the things that you have control over. The confidence you get from this will get girl’s attention."
