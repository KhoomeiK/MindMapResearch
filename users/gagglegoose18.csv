McMaster,fdmabf9,t1_fdm7lbt,1578543790.0,"The handbook basically emphasizes the very things you just mentioned though. It guides note taking in that direction. OP, Aldehydee is right, but I do think the handbook can help you follow their advice"

McMaster,fckgwyu,t3_ehobfe,1577725071.0,"I took bio1A03 last semester . It isn't too difficult just extremely time consuming, especially if you're a slow note taker like myself. You'll have two dense online modules to watch per week. Try not to fall behind (that's when everything becomes a mess) and take good notes as you watch them. It will save you so much time when studying for tests. Transcripts of the modules with space for summary notes are provided on Avenue and I found them quite useful. Also be sure to attend all the applied lectures and take notes because 30% of each test is based on content from the applied lectures. 

The lab component is straight forward and interesting so don't worry about that too much. Just show up and complete all the pre/post lab assignments. 

If you have any questions feel free to pm me! 

Good luck this semester :)"
