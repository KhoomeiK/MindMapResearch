AudioProductionDeals,fevgc2s,t1_fepilwj,1579397028.0,"Short answer is no, samples could never encompass the infinite variability in electronic components. But neither does the Arturia modelling.

Long answer is, does it matter, and if so, when does it start mattering? So you can record multiple samples to capture various aspects of the synth, such as the phase of the free-running oscillators, the analog drift, the filter drift and ringing, variability in the envelope behavior, etc.. Or you could sample the raw oscillators and model the rest.

Puremagnetik does not do any modelling, generally no multisampling, round robins, etc.. It's basically one sample per note (they are not stretched to cover a note range though). So for patches with a fast attack, a repeating note can ""machine gun"". Repeating samples are the archenemy of sampled instruments.

With that said, sampled synths in the right context are a good solution. Without the actual synth or a good model of the synth, it's better than nothing, and you can compose around the limitations. For patches played as pads, you can't hear the starting phase anyway, and the notes mask each other especially if they are played by hand with miniscule start time differences. And always ask if it matters in the mix.

Listen to the demos, if you like the patches and don't know how to get them otherwise, as long as you're aware of the limitations ask if they are going to be a roadblock for your goals, and if they aren't then it's fine."

AudioProductionDeals,fejeqon,t3_ep7ib5,1579170548.0,"Welp, I downloaded this to see how bad the instruments were relative to the demos.

The kalimba is odd. It gets quieter the higher up the keyboard you go. There's a 40 db difference from lowest to highest, and a huge dropoff at the E flat above middle C, an 11 db difference. Now, sampling natural dynamic range is nice, but this is ridiculous.

The conceit here is that they've got 4 voices for each instrument, where one is the regular sound, and three are processed in some way. You can adjust the level of each voice, as well as humanize/randomize the relative levels with each note press. 

After turning all but the natural voice off, turning off the two convolution reverbs, and opening up the filters and release, it just doesn't sound like a real kalimba. I don't know what they sampled and how they did it, but there isn't any satisfying pluck and it sounds like it's resonating in an abnormally huge box. Did they use a contact mic? Two different kalimbas with different ranges? I can't think of any other explanation. In any case, I dislike it and deleted it.

The glockenspiel isn't much better. While the dynamic range is much better, there's no crispness you'd expect from striking the key, and there's an ugly resonance as it rings out.

The other main feature is the arp which allows the original note presses through, which is a cool idea. And it's advantageous since you don't want to hit the same key twice. They don't seem to be round-robined and they machine gun rather nastily. I deleted this one too."

If you're happy with the features and workflow then you're set. If you want linear phase then you can grab their LP10 and still have paid less than for Pro Q3. And if you want analog style you can just do it manually. I used to do that before I got Pro Q3. Slower workflow but didn't have the money.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
AudioProductionDeals,fejb19r,t1_fej0js5,1579164957.0,"If you have any plans on getting FabFilter Pro Q-3 then I would suggest putting this money towards it, unless this amount of money is a trifling amount for you.

Babylon is a competent EQ, with clean processing and low CPU. It has 7 configurable bands with 8 types of filters (notably includes an Allpass), and 4 slope settings. The bang for buck at this price is good, but it's got much fewer frills than other EQs, and without oversampling and phase options isn't suitable for mastering. But I don't see any advantage over Fruity EQ. What do you mean about seeing frequencies?

If you want something like Pro Q-3 for less, then I suggest LVC Toned-MAX. It's $50 regularly and goes for less on sale. It's got nearly the same feature set as Pro-Q3 minus the curve cloning but more analog modelling.  So you've got 20 bands (to ProQ3's 24), you can get analog-style proportional-Q, Pultec style shelving, preamp and output analog modelling, and several oversampling options. That's my value pick for a general, go-to EQ.

Pompeii is a basic MB compressor at this price. 4 compression/expander bands, you can choose the cutoffs and the slopes, plus one regular compressor (all frequencies). You can modulate the cutoffs(!) but doesn't do any smoothing which can create artifacts especially in lower frequencies. No configurable oversampling, no phase setting, no lookahead, no sidechain, no mid/side processing, the analyzer is fixed to pre+post and no ballistics, but a low price in exchange. So it's less useful for mastering which is where you would most likely use it."

This was further solidified in the ensuing dictatorial rule where it was woven together with anti-Communism to try to control the people. Today, it contributes to the idea of reunification with a neighboring nuclear state.

audioengineering,fecninq,t1_fe98r8c,1578978371.0,"Can you more specifically describe your end goals? Are you looking to search and find samples to use in a music production? Or are you looking to audition samples then sort them into a folder structure?

If the former, I use XO. It's a couple tools in one. There's the relationship map, where machine classification puts similar sounds near each other. Then there is the drum machine, where you load the samples into once you've found them. There are some processing tools like envelopes, EQs, etc.. Then there is the sequencer. I'd ask XLN for a trial extension if you haven't figured out why it's so good. To me, it's the fact that I can experiment with no penalty. 

For example, I'm searching the map but then realize I want the sample five steps back, but where was it? XO's got a path history. For the sequencer, there is a playground to morph and try all sorts of things, and it's non-destructive until I commit it. Same thing with the drum kit. Once I've got a sequenced pattern, I can try different drum sounds without locking myself in. And the tool overall is very thoughtfully designed and a joy to work with. 

As for Atlas, I don't think their machine classification is as good right now. It's got no sequencer but they've got one planned. It's a relatively basic search drum machine but that may be all you need. The difference with XO is like that between an economically priced car vs a luxury model. XO also comes with a very nice drum library licensed from Samplephonics.

For the latter workflow, I use Resonic Pro. The UI is like a file browser. It's blazing fast, click a file and it plays it immediately. You can tell it to play all sounds sequentially in a folder, which I like so I can compare and decide what to delete. But you can also drag and drop to destination folders, or a DAW.

Bass can machine gun but in the mix may not be noticeable.

For something like a piano, you definitely want round robins and many velocity layers, in addition to pedal position, release samples, and possibly sympathetic resonance.

AudioProductionDeals,fcz9f8h,t1_fcx2d0g,1578096342.0,"NI allows free automated license transfers and it is one of the few platforms that secures sampled instruments in a way that allows transfers. That's what the fees pay for. So you can still blame developers that don't allow license transfers for Player-protected libraries under piracy reasons. There is absolutely no reason these can't be transferred any differently from plugins (aside from the bandwidth costs of a new customer downloading it, which existing customers can already do).

With that said, no is privy to how much each licensing fee is. Any fee takes away from the dev making it cost prohibitive to give away for free, but it's conjecture whether it's fair or not. If NI allowed free Player licensed libs with no fees, they'd have to start instituting fees to support the licensing infrastructure some other way.

NI isn't locking anyone into Kontakt. It's pretty generous anyone with a Kontakt license can make unprotected libraries and distribute them unilaterally. No other market-leading proprietary software sampler platform did this before. It pressured Steinberg to allow Halion licensees to distribute their own instruments. UVI, you need to have a contract with them.

Again, if you want free sampled instruments on a free platform, lobby devs to use a truly free platform. There is SFZ and HISE, SFZ is a lot more mature. Most of the 8DIO freebies could have been distributed as SFZs. There are a few that require scripting, which HISE could handle.

There are several devs that support SFZ. DrumDrops, Karoryfer, just to name some. Show them there is demand for it. Based on how often people complain here about free Kontakt libs, it definitely exists."

Biotek 2 is a performance dream. There are many performance controls on the front page and many presets to play with. It's very strong sound design-wise. You've got traditional VA, 4-Op FM, samples (you can FM with those too), and infinite layers. The modulation workflow can get difficult as targets can be on multiple pages. But if you plan ahead there's little stopping you. And of course, it sounds great.

Waverazor has a similar approach with a performance page and a very deep editor. The central conceit is the patent-pending waveform-chopping oscillator. Each segment of a waveform can be independent in shape, phase, and pitch, and each one can be modulated independently. It's trivial to make gnarly sounds this way. But there are many performance controls (dependent on each preset) to go from pleasant to aggressive. 

The editor is complex because you are basically designing a performance instrument each time, not unlike Biotek. You are deciding what parameters the user gets and how that changes the sound. You can make and save simpler performance-page presets, where you may have used a template and modified the oscillator as well. So you don't have to dive into the editor if you're happy with the many sensible templates. Most of the time I'm using those."

Also, business is unpredictable and even the best of intentions can change when it hits the inflexible wall of market reality. Software in general depreciates, if you are patient you will be rewarded. 

With PA I find it helps to think of a price you are willing to pay and simply wait for that to happen (I keep a wishlist spreadsheet with price histories and targets). If it goes cheaper then you can tell yourself that you paid a personally-determined fair price for it and got the time differential usage. I'm happy with what I've bought from them, no regrets, even seeing them go for less now.

Also, I find their support in general to be good. They will respond, and I've gotten a ticket kicked up and resolved after a civil exchange, and I've also had responses I disagreed with but left alone. I have heard other people being dissatisfied and ignored but I suspect they've been a little too argumentative or maybe they got a response they didn't like.

What is the goal? Is it attainable? People doing racist things in public generally aren't open to a learning moment. Nor is it a BIPOC's responsibility to redeem a white supremacist's soul. 

Do you simply want to let them know you will not accept it? If you're a BIPOC you probably fall into one of two stereotypes. Speak up, and you are the angry one. Don't speak up, and you are the submissive one. You either couch your terms in polite language or you overcompensate, which has its own dangers.

This has to be decided in a split-second. It must be strategic in the face of Catch-22s. Most people opt for safety, for survival.

The only thing that works is when society shows mass disapproval. Are you going to get that in the immediate situation? Would you find it on social media, which is inundated with microaggressions? There is also the safety issue, as recording video is often considered an escalation. But if it makes the news, then people become aware of how often it happens."

Reaper,fcl4zh0,t3_ehqztw,1577739927.0,"I have one of their more basic keyboards. The software expressly integrates with REAPER more than any other manufacturer's. The controls automatically map to things in REAPER, you can change the mapping easily. It automatically knows what track you have selected, what instrument you have selected, it automaps keyboard controls to mixer controls and virtual instruments/FX. This is great, especially if you want to work entirely from your keyboard.

I also have an old Axiom (2nd gen, don't think it applies to the newer ones) and use the community-developed DirectLink driver to map to plugin controls. There's a separate app to manage the mapping. Nothing's automatic, I set the mappings manually the first time I load a plugin. So it's more work but I have it set the way I want. And I can't easily do things far from the computer. Most other keyboards have you do MIDI learn, which also requires you to be at your computer. Then there's things like the NI Keyboards but you need to use Komplete Kontrol to get the same functionality, and not all instruments/FX support NKS.

So if you're looking to work from your keyboard, Nektar is one of the few that supports REAPER natively for that workflow."

Propose, brainstorm, and develop community icon ideas here.

A few guidelines:

* It needs to be clear enough to be recognized when scaled down to small sizes,
* Reddit currently places the icon inside a circle, but that may change,
* We are not an official Cockos or REAPER community, we cannot use their logos.

Feel free to bounce off other people's ideas and run with them.

Some ideas to start with:

* Music / Notes / Composition
* Sound Design
* Grim Reaper / Scythe
* Extensibility / Flexibility
* Rapid
* Environment
* Audio
* Production
* Engineering
* Recording
* Think about how *you* use Reaper and what it lets you accomplish"

>These basic failures of taste and sensibility are a subset of Hooper’s  over-all failure of literal vision: he doesn’t really see what he’s  doing, and the virtual invisibility of his own movie to himself is  reflected in an odd set of metaphors that result from his casting. The  diversity of the cast is admirable, yet Hooper veers toward what could charitably be called color blindness.  
>  
>The result is a transformation of  the story into a two-pronged narrative: the expulsion of a black male  arch-criminal (who’s even responsible for the movie’s drug trade—the  scattering of catnip powder, by his henchwoman Bombalurina, played by  Taylor Swift) and the recognition by a white woman of the virtue of a  poor and despised black woman, Grizabella, who transforms her anguish  and exclusion into music. (Deuteronomy even says that she’s evaluating  the cats on the basis of their “soul.”) What’s more, for the role of  Victoria—called, in the play, “Victoria the White Cat”—Hooper does more  than put the character into white fur. He strangely, pointlessly, and  irresponsibly has Hayward, a light-skinned black woman, wear makeup that  can rightly be described as whiteface.  
>  
>The allegory, of a community  that lets in and exalts the soulful black person and expels the  dangerous one, is solely a result of the casting (and the grossly  misguided makeup). It’s obviously far from what Webber had in mind; I  suspect that it’s also far from what Hooper had in mind. But the movie’s casting, likely undertaken with the best of artistic intentions, is of a  piece with the direction of the dance and the framing of the action:  it’s simply oblivious. Hooper not only fails to see clearly the movie’s  fantasies; he doesn’t see its realities either."
