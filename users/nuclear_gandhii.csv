Stellaris,ffc21ul,t1_ff5fgjs,1579789570.0,"I have read your other comments on this thread and it looks like you seem to dislike the hyperlanes a lot. With hyperlanes, I find it very annoying to continuously recapture the same system because the enemy attacks it with weak but numerus fleets, which is just annoying. I don't think it is unfair to assume this problem of chasing around fleets will be solved if we had to worry about enemies popping up anywhere, or just going around my defences with other FTL in the game.

I am not trying to attack you or anything, I am just genuinely curious as you why you think the previous way of 3 different FTL drives is better. (I haven't played the game before MegaCorp). What are the defences you are talking about back when you had multiple FTL? My dumb brain can't coming up with comprehensive defence strategies for jumping enemies."

india,ff2munn,t1_ff24rsn,1579513860.0,"Having a stable country is more important than having an unstable country in the off chance that people turn against them. Now it is generally accepted that stability leads to economic growth. That growth will get them more money than what they could get off of chaos. 

Now this theory goes out the window if they are playing some sort of 4D chess, of course."

india,fccxo58,t1_fcbpr2i,1577603892.0,"People just love to make excuses. They will have no issues claiming our 'superiority' over Pakistan while dismiss any claims saying otherwise. It suited their narrative to say that people are coming to India from Bangladesh because of India's better economy. But that argument fails when Bangladesh has a better economy than India. 

Comparisons will be made as long as it suits your narrative. The real bad guys (not even in a comic way) is the Chinese government and we never see people comparing ourselves to China. Why you may ask? Because xyz excuse differentiates India from China and that makes comparisons irrelevant. 

Everything you say in your comment is parroted a million times over without really understanding why it happens. You say as if our slowdown is a norm whenever we have a large economy. Our economy isn't even comparable to the largest economies around the world. Did they also suffer from slowdown while they were growing? Are they all an exception and we are going down the 'correct' path?"

Now conveniently, they praise him for his protests but want the most severe of punishments possible to those who want their voices heard, just like Gandhi? Make up your mind people.

CGPGrey,fc0775k,t1_fc06hv5,1577281499.0,"Nope. The new Commander of the Final Order fleet understood what they were doing and he ordered for the ground control tower to be disabled and switched to the control tower on his ship. We are only shown that the control tower was just disabled. It could have been destroyed at a later point during the battle, which makes the entire 'land the ground forces and use explosives to destroy it' plot completely useless."
CGPGrey,fc02ih4,t3_efeqm0,1577275277.0,"I have two concerns about the last battle scene where the Final Order faces the Resistance. 

1. They had one control tower for all of these ship with no redundancy, (which is fine I guess?) but it is never destroyed. So theoretically, when the capital ship is destroyed, they could have just switched back to the ground tower for their navigation.
2. Why did they need ground forces at all? Couldn't a well aimed strafe from the best pilot in the galaxy destroy BOTH of the control towers?"
