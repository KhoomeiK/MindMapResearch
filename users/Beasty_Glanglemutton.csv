>Evidence at the scene suggested Shipe knew he was driving a stolen truck. He had bolt cutters, multiple sets of keys, and a locked case labeled—amazingly—""Crime Committing Kit."" The truck had other stolen property inside. The key Shipe had been using to start the engine did not belong to the truck.

And the court's ruling:

>Chief Appellate Judge Erika Hadlock wrote in the July 23, 2014, decision that the state was asking the court ""to accept too great an inferential leap"" in determining that Shipe knew the truck was stolen when he took possession of it.

So, you can literally be caught in a stolen vehicle with a ""Crime Committing Kit"" (yes, really) and be able to claim you didn't know it was stolen. That is why Portland has a car theft problem."

And with the Beatles, John was running the show at the time, and he said \[dismissively\] ‘I don’t wanna do an animated film.’ Three years later they did Yellow Submarine, so you can see how things change.”
