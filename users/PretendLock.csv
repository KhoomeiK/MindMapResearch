I'm certain there's more to it. If you go on youtube, people have done extensive videos going through their various scandals and what not. They're not insanely popular on youtube at large, but in certain circles they're pretty notorious

Edit: she didn‚Äôt claim Tammy died, she just decided to raise money for an XL casket while she had only been in the hospital for like a day. Where that money actually ended up going is a bit of a mystery because she never fully addressed the situation once Tammy was back in her videos chipper as ever. And then even though she offered to give back the money if any donors wanted it, she didn‚Äôt. So there‚Äôs that. Do with that info what you will"

Some tips for the future when popping pustules that are definitely ready: use a sterile lancet or a tiny sewing pin. You can warm/soften the pimple up a bit with a cotton pad soaked with warm water for a minute, gently lance it, then carefully depress the skin and pull away from the pimple to squeeze out the pustule. I tend to squeeze a little extra for the blood to drain until only clear fluid (lymph) remains, then put a hydrocolloid bandage over it until it heals enough."

And she's not the type to be sitting a lot, she's very much up and doing chores/housework. It's not quite enough though. Formal exercise seems to be the missing piece to all this, since even though she's very skinny and technically underweight, her muscle mass is practically non-existent. I really try to encourage her to at least do some exercises with 2-3lb weights to work on recovering her strength but she doesn't like to because it's ""too difficult""...

So far exercise has been a hard sell on her since she's in her 60's and didn't grow up with formal exercise being a thing. I keep trying though!"

Plus, she's never once slipped up with ""oh just a bite"" either. I don't know how she does it, but I have mad respect for her discipline. 

It was odd because someone we reconnected with recently at a new years party told us that she was diagnosed as prediabetic in the last year. Tey got to talking about it, and this friend seemed like she took it seriously but continued to indulge in lots of unhealthy/sugary food at this party.

xxfitness,feh1xxm,t3_eox1zy,1579107447.0,"If you‚Äôre new to lifting then you‚Äôre going to be making newbie gains left right and center with regular heavy lifting! Body recomp will happen as long as you‚Äôre consistent and eating a good supportive diet. 

I would up your protein. I‚Äôve used a bunch of different macro calculators over the years and the number varies a little but I think aiming for at least 0.8 g/lb of body weight per day is a good minimum. 70 grams seems a little low for someone trying to build muscle and lose fat. However, just to echo someone else who commented, visible abs maybe not be possible unless you‚Äôre at an unsustainably low BF%. That‚Äôs the case for me personally but I‚Äôve made my peace with that. I hope you can get your abs or else just a toned tummy you can be confident with :) 

Also, is it realistic to get a Fitbit or Apple Watch? This is extra and probably unnecessary tbh but I‚Äôve had a Fitbit for years and it helped me find out my TDEE is higher by a hundred or so cal than any calculator has told me. It helps me stay at maintenance (which is important for body recomp!). More importantly, it helped me break free of my ‚Äúdiet-mode‚Äù brain that always wanted to be at a deficit, but that sort of thing is so subjective for all of us. 

I would lastly recommend finding a plan that helps you stay consistent about 3x in the gym. I know college is super busy and stressful with studying and exams, but I think that makes it even more important to give yourself a break just for an hour or so to put everything out of your mind and just exercise your body as a stress reliever. For 3x a week, probably you‚Äôll want a full body workout plan, but any way that gets you hitting all major muscle groups on a weekly basis is good.  I believe there are recommendations in the Wiki of this sub. 

Good luck and have fun in the gym!"

TwoXChromosomes,feew7xa,t1_feepb9j,1579042547.0,"It's good that you are working on communicating with her better but maybe something that will help you to not get frustrated by her stories having ""more details than necessary"" is to shift your mindset about them. [You didn't ask for advice, but I'm giving it anyway] Your example was very very short, but to me none of that was unnecessary detail. You know the people she was with, where she went, and gave context clues in case you didn't remember who Laura was right away. I'm not going to pretend I can speak for every woman but in my experience as one and being friends with lots of them, giving plenty of details is a sign of affection. You like this person and want to give them a complete picture. If I spoke super vaguely, it's a sign that I don't particularly want to be talking to this person in the first place and don't care for them to know many details about my life/experiences. The Guy story you told was super vague and didn't tell me anything besides that you went to a party and got drunk. Who were you with? Who's party was it? I would get a little frustrated myself if a person gave me such little detail all the time, especially if that person was my life partner. But ultimately, it's not about what's better or worse. I don't want to put value statements on whether women or men are better conversationalists. At the end of the day it's just about showing respect, and I assume you do respect your wife.

xxfitness,fdzwbfa,t3_enfjup,1578797352.0,"First off, congrats on working so hard at a healthy lifestyle! I can only imagine how hard it was to deal with obesity at such a young age but I‚Äôm so happy to hear you want to be your best healthy self. (How tall are you btw?)

I agree that this sounds like a lot of volume. You said you‚Äôre following one of Stephanie Buttermore‚Äôs programs? I actually have her Women‚Äôs Foundation guide for beginners (even though I‚Äôm very much an intermediate-advanced lifter) and think it‚Äôs very informative and gives some good explanations on training principles and muscle gain/fat loss. In fact it gives a thorough breakdown of basically everything a lifting/fitness newbie might want to know. 

One thing I want to make sure is mentioned:

Muscle is ‚Äútorn down‚Äù when you exercise them, but they build back stronger on REST DAYS. Sounds like you need less reps/sets on your lifting days as well as 1-2 rest days each week. Don‚Äôt push yourself so that you‚Äôre in pain all the time! You don‚Äôt need to be super sore in order to call it a good workout. 

Consider simply following Stephanie‚Äôs guide for both your upper body days as well as lower body days. It really is a good workout guide!

Additionally, take a closer look at your nutrition. I‚Äôm currently working on a little bit of body recomp myself, and protein takes priority. You need protein to fuel and build your muscles. If you don‚Äôt want to count macros or calories too strictly, you might find Precision Nutrition‚Äôs calculator handy. I‚Äôm using it now and it‚Äôs been helping me to eyeball macro portions. And it‚Äôs free! (Well there‚Äôs a paid option but it‚Äôs absolutely not necessary). 

I‚Äôm not a doctor and I‚Äôm making some assumptions since you didn‚Äôt go too much into it, but if you find yourself in a pattern of gaining and losing weight frequently over the years, you need to know *why*. I was a healthy weight during my formative years and I definitely still grew a bit more from the age of 16. Definitely discuss all this with your doctor to see what a realistic growth curve for you would look like. 

A last note for your workouts, I would start with 5-10 min of cardio as a warmup, put most of my efforts in the weightlifting portion, and then tack on a little cardio/HIIT at the end if I still have anything left in the tank. Doing so much cardio in the beginning will just tax your muscles so you can‚Äôt work as hard or lift as heavy during your lifting workout.  Currently I tack on 10-15 min of walking at an incline or alternating of 1 min running/1 min rest at the end of my upper body days."
