AmItheAsshole,ff8u8c7,t3_es3p8q,1579696260.0,"My niece has a similar back story. Her mother was a piece of work. She was a stripper when she met my brother (nothing against sex workers or dancers, she just happened to be in that line of work), used drugs heavily, and treated my brother like shit. After she got pregnant, she lorded it over my brother to force him to stick around while she mentally abused him. 

When she was 7 months pregnant, she attempted to abort my niece through some form of medication she received from a “cousin” overseas. My brother found her limp in the bathroom and rushed her to the hospital where they stabilized her and did an emergency c-section. 

My niece lived in the NICU for five weeks on a respirator while her mother straight up disappeared three days after she was released from the hospital. When my niece was 4 months old (and living with my parents at the time), her mother contacted my brother with the request to see her daughter. My brother stupidly agreed to meet her at a motel with the baby. He fell asleep while there (my mom is still convinced she drugged him somehow) and she kidnapped my niece. 

Not even 12 hours after my brother had initially met her at the motel, she left a very intense voicemail on my dads phone that demanded that my brother brought all of her clothing and any money he had to an address in the city and the baby would be returned safely. My dad doesn’t fuck around when it comes to his children and grandchildren, so he showed up alone and took my niece by force from what was a very obvious trap house and we didn’t hear from her mother for years after that. 


Every couple years, my brother will get a message on Facebook from her mother asking about my niece, but she has no idea where my parents live now or even what her own daughter looks like. 

She’s nearly 12 now and my parents are planning on telling her an abbreviated version of events the next time she asks. In the past they’ve just told her that some people have moms and dads, and some people just have dads. Some people are lucky and they have dads AND grandparents to give them extra love and attention. I doubt they’ll let her meet her mother until she’s much older and understands more about addiction and why some people just aren’t fit to be parents. She also has several siblings that she’s unaware of and that is also information she’ll learn about at some point when she’s older."

todayilearned,ff6k1iu,t1_ff5rgz8,1579628860.0,I was diagnosed with “exercise induced asthma” and “exercise induced anxiety” by an Army doctor when I was still active duty. 2 years later I found out that I had a torn labrum in my hip and that’s why running was near impossible. I was pushing myself so hard (and also trying to prove myself to my superiors that I wasn’t just another female soldier that sucks at running) that I had made what should have just been a simple three-four weeks of physical therapy turn into a full blown surgery that ended up ruining my chances of ever being enlisted again due to chronic hip and back pain.

Dogtraining,fejlv2f,t3_epeiux,1579179283.0,"I avoid dog parks now because my dogs and I were attacked at one, but I have successfully trained my girl to stop doing what you are describing here. She used to backpedal just as we were nearing the gate and then would growl and lunge at dogs that got too close to her when we entered. 

What I did was pretty simple but also really time-consuming in the long run. 

If your dog park has a “slow” period (i.e. early morning/late evening) take him during that time. Practice walking towards the gate and reward him for looking at the gate while he’s relaxed. Reward for approaching the gate while relaxed. If he offers to walk through on his own, reward with a jackpot of treats and then leave and start the process over again. 

Once you are at a point where he’ll confidently walk up to the gate with no hesitation, start going while there are more dogs around. Ask other owners if they are willing to “gate manage” by body blocking dogs from getting too close and only let one or two calm pups to be near the gate. Reward for calm interactions and casual sniffing. 

It takes time and a lot of patience and the willingness to solicit strangers, but it was very effective for us. Up until we stopped going to the park, my girl would march right in and get straight into playing with no issues. 

Good luck!"
Dogtraining,fe2h4bt,t3_enir0h,1578838300.0,"Seconding the decompression period. Don’t change too much at once. Once he’s home, get into a regular potty/walk schedule and stick to it. Feed meals consistently at the same time(s). Don’t push to hard for him to be playful if he’s not into it. Let him explore his new home on his own while you and your family just observe quietly. 

Things to avoid:
-Dont touch his food while he’s eating it until you are positive he isn’t food reactive/aggressive. It’s a great way to get bit and set yourself back in training


-don’t take him to dog parks, in public, or to friends/family houses for the first couple weeks. He needs time to get comfortable with you and introducing a lot of new stimulus at once is sure to overwhelm him. 


-don’t get frustrated if he doesn’t know how to sit, lay down, come, etc. He might actually know those things, but because he’s in a new environment, he’s too anxious to comply. If he’s not trained at all, then you get to start from scratch and assign your own words/signals! 


Things to get started on immediately:
-take him to the vet! Even if he got a clean bill of health from the shelter/rescue, establishing a relationship with your vet is a great idea. Ask you vet clinic if they do “happiness” visits where you and your pup come in just for the staff to love on him and give him treats. It’ll help with future visits and reduce vet anxiety. 


-touch him all over! Spend 5-10 minutes a day just casually petting him all over his body. Being able to touch your new dogs head, feet, and tummy is a valuable tool if he ever gets injuring after needs to be restrained/checked over. Make sure you have plenty of treats to reinforce the touching. 


-after the first couple weeks home, slowly introduce him to all kinds of people. Children, men, and women. People with hats and beards. Women wearing head scarfs or big sunglasses. A great way to do this is to find a nice public park, have plenty of treats on hand, and just sit down and periodically reward him for looking at new people and staying calm. (The same thing can be done for meeting new dogs!)

Good luck with your new pup!"
Dogtraining,fe2e9ge,t3_enlbgy,1578837390.0,"I would suggest doing some light training with her. Is she familiar with basic commands? Can her down be improved? Or maybe work on teaching her a strong “place” command. 

If you are finding yourself home alone with this dog, take advantage of that time and make yourself an asset to her day-to-day. And, as a bonus, she won’t be as likely to jump and bark when she wants something if you teach her that sitting quietly earns more treats and praise. 

It won’t fix all the issues you’ve brought up, but it’s a start. If the behavior persists, I would look into having her seen at the vet for anything out of the ordinary that could be causing her to lash out due to pain and, barring any physical ailment, consult a behaviorist about her potential aggression. Good luck!

(As a side note, the comment about “feeding the dog yourself and pretending to eat first” is false. Domesticated dogs are NOT wolves and they don’t understand pack dynamic.)"

badwomensanatomy,fddiipx,t3_ekrqlc,1578313669.0,"Grew up in rural Oklahoma for some context. Lots of churches and lots of religious bigots. 

The school I went to didn’t have a single sex ed class until freshman year of high school (ninth grade, 13-14 years old). I wouldn’t even consider it an in-depth class, as there was a separation of boys and girls and each group had a corresponding male or female teacher. 


My group (all girls) learned about menstruation and stds and were taught that not even condoms could prevent stds or pregnancy so abstinence was the only foolproof method of contraception.  There was also a heavy amount of Christian values tossed at us and we were told, in short, that being a virgin until marriage was best. 

The boys were taught about stds and puberty and how to put condoms on correctly and were given a brief explanation about female menstruation and how hormones affect women differently than men (which led to boys mocking the girls about how “emotional” we are). 

Luckily for me, my parents taught my brothers and I plenty about safe sex and different forms of contraception because they were teen parents and wanted to prevent the same for their children."

aww,fcifzm2,t1_fci2374,1577661958.0,"That’s where I typically start. If redirecting isn’t working, take it a step further. Train a command that gets him to either a) grab a toy or b) go to a specific spot (crate is ideal, but a rug or place mat is good, too). 

When he inevitably starts up with the mouthing behavior, stand up, firmly say “no” or “down” Heavily reward *every* positive reaction. If he sits or lays down, jackpot with some high value treats and then give the command you’ve chosen. If he grabs his toy or goes to his spot, jackpot again. 

You want the puppy to make the decision to not bite. It’s hard to justify giving a puppy a treat when it was previously trying to bite, but I promise the puppy will change its behavior over time. 

Training a really solid sit and stay is nice, too. That way you can stop the biting, give a firm “no” and then put them in a sit/stay and walk away and only go back to petting/playing once they’ve cooled off a bit. Puppies need boundaries to follow and being extremely consistent is the key to making sure the puppy knows not to go too far with rough play."

aww,fchc2b9,t1_fcglntg,1577649152.0,"Allowing a puppy to bite at your hands and fingers while they are little can be fun and cute until they get a bit bigger and unintentionally bite your kids face.
