You cannot get better if you keep fighting and blaming yourself.  The reason is because you are actually reinforcing your negative thoughts when you do this.  Instead, you need to calm down and ignore those thoughts.  Find a distraction, any distraction, to keep your mind off the internet and off the lack of relationship experience.  That which you resist persists.  

There is a book I always recommend which has helped me tremendously.  It is called ""Brainswitch Out of Depression"" by A.B. Curtiss.  The first half of the book discusses why anxiety and depression occurs and talks about how the brain functions as it relates to negative thinking, addiction, etc. and how to re-direct the mind to use the cognitive part of the brain instead.  The second half of the book contains a bunch of mental exercises to help stop your automatic negative thinking, de-stress, and re-engage with the world.  

I want you to put aside any regret about the past or any worry about the future.  Tell yourself ""I have no past, I have no future.  There is only now.""

Also, I highly recommend keeping a journal.  Each day, I want you to write down the following:

1)  3 things you are grateful for.  For this exercise, it doesn't matter if you are religious or not.  You don't have to be grateful to someone in order to feel grateful.

2)  A list of things you want to accomplish today.  Make them specific and realistic.  Check the items off the list as you do them throughout today.  

3)  For 5 or 10 minutes, write down any thoughts that come to mind.  Literally anything that pops into your head write it down.  

4)  Write a list of things that you want to feel today.  Productive, happy, attractive, successful, strong, confident, whatever.  

At the end of the day, read back over what you wrote and reflect on it.  Don't beat yourself up if you didn't finish the tasks on the list.  Once you have finished reading it that evening, you can throw it away, burn it, shred it, etc. because that day is now in the past and there is no past.  There is only now."

Secondly, find something healthy to eat instead.  Keep a healthy snack with you at all times.  Apple slices, almonds, rice cakes, whatever.  The more fewer ingredients, the better.  And drink water.  Lots of water.  

As soon as you feel tempted to eat something unhealthy, grab a healthy snack, drink two glasses of water, and then, if it is mealtime, make a healthy decision.  

If you can go two weeks without foods with lots of sugar, fat, and salt, your cravings will subside and it will be easier to make the correct decisions.  If there are healthy foods you don't particularly like, eat them anyway and do so with a neutral mindset.  ""This isn't my favorite food in the world, but it isn't that bad"".  Try incorporating them into different recipes or use different methods of cooking them.  I never liked brussel sprouts until I had them roasted in olive oil and salt.

Also, exercise a little every day.  You don't have to go to the gym.  You don't have to buy a set of weights.  It is great if you want to do that, but the important thing is to get active.  Any exercise is better than none.  Even if you just do some yoga stretches, it will be better than nothing.  Then, over time, you can gradually exercise a little more and train a little harder.

Walking does wonders.  Too cold outside?  Go walk at the mall or do a few laps around the inside of Walmart (just avert your eyes when you walk past the cookie aisle and say ""I'm not even going to think about that"")."

That's because of the effects of dopamine, which is a hormone produced that gives you pleasure.  The neurons in the brain naturally look for the easiest path to getting that dopamine.  Sedentary activities that lead the body to produce dopamine are the easiest way for the brain to get the hit it is looking for.  If you've been watching TV, going on social media, etc. for a long time, there is a strong connection in the neuro-transmitters of your brain between those activities and getting dopamine.  

When you cut out those activities, the brain starts looking for other ways to get a dopamine fix, so, over time, the connection between TV/social media/video games/etc. and dopamine dies off and a strong connection is created between your new, more productive activity and dopamine."

getdisciplined,fczfpzl,t3_ejghm1,1578100242.0,"I used to have the same problem.  Here are some tips I used to de-clutter:

1)  When deciding whether you should keep an item, ask yourself the following questions:

- Is this item useful?  Have I used it in the last year?
- Does this item bring me joy?
- Can this item be easily replaced?

If it is not useful or you rarely, if ever, use it and it can be easily replaced and it does not bring you real joy, then throw it out, sell it, or donate it.

2)  Implement a one in, one out strategy with clothing.  Everytime you buy a new apparel item, donate or trash one that you don't wear often, if at all.  

3)  Also helpful with clothing is to turn all of your hangers backwards and whenever you wear an item, turn the hanger around.  At the end of the year, whatever hasn't been turned around (hasn't been worn) should be donated or thrown away.  Obviously, this doesn't apply to suits/dresses that you'd only wear on certain occasions, such as a wedding, funeral, job interview, etc.

4)  If you have a family heirloom or gift that you feel guilty about selling or disposing, ask yourself ""would the person that gave me this really care if I threw it away?"".  If you don't want to throw it away because it reminds you of that person, take a picture of it (preferably a picture of you using it) and keep the picture."
