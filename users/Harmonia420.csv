oddlysatisfying,ff9qpv1,t1_ff9p8nw,1579718902.0,True. But “Northern” refers to a large area of a specific place while north usually means either direction or the specific north point of a place so one would expect north to be further north.
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff603wk,t1_ff5x71d,1579615661.0,"This is what they mean by money doesn’t buy happiness. Yes, money will fix a huge amount of things that are wrong with a persons life when they have been living poor for a long time, and that might make someone happy for a while, but man will it come as a shock when that person realised it didn’t fix themselves and the damage that’s already been done. 

The same goes for people born wealthy who have shit lives like the one you described. Being poor takes up your whole life, and when it’s relative to those around you it makes you feel like it just can’t get any worse - that those who aren’t struggling with the bills might not have any family to come home to, might be absolutely and utterly miserable every single day in their job (which seriously does affect people. Many people leave high paying jobs to be happy in lower paying ones). 

It’s easy to forget that there are other things out there making people miserable, and often, they are exactly as justified as you are to feel that way."

Showerthoughts,ff4i1i9,t1_ff3e2i0,1579564111.0,"I think the only thing they’re really missing is TV and internet now, that they don’t supplement with magic. Everything else I can sort of understand, they’ve had no reason to change what they’re doing for a long time since it has worked well for them. 

Not only this, JK wanted to highlight the segregation between muggles and wizards. For a long time, they coexisted peacefully, but sometime in the 1600’s it became too dangerous so the Statute of secrecy came about meaning they had to officially hide from muggles, worldwide. This is where their progression alongside muggles stopped and they went off on a totally different tangent in terms of technological advancement. Imagine how handy it would’ve been to have a wizard helping with all the science experiments and discoveries between then and now, muggle technology would actually probably be way more advanced if that hadn’t happened. By now they would’ve found a way to harness magic and use it themselves probably.

To address the actual post, cigarettes weren’t commercialised until the late 1800’s, and since it is so very rare for a kid to smoke before the age of 11 even in the U.K. the chances of cigarettes making their way into a muggle born kids life before they’re introduced to the tobacco free world of Hogwarts are very low."

I already know that indoor cats exist and also WHY they exist but people seem to be focusing on that.  It was originally about the chances that OP’s cat is vaccinated against a particular pathogen due to the chances that it is an outdoor cat rather than an indoor cat.

This reply seemed to be explaining the concept of indoor and outdoor cats which I already understand since I’ve had both, though most of my cats have been cats that go outside when they want and have all their vaccines (even my indoor cat had their vaccines because of the high risk they could escape and because it was a temporary situation). I assumed the majority of other cats in the world who have owners are also allowed to roam freely. I feel like I’ve explained this so many times and nobody’s getting it.

The majority of people who are talking about this are lazy fucks sitting in their rooms on their computers having contributed nothing to their country, meanwhile Harry has served in Afghanistan and is an Apache Pilot among other things. He’s dropping his appointments. “Captain General of Marines, Honorary Air Commandant Royal Air Force Honington, and Commodore-in-Chief of Small Ships and Diving”. Do you even realise how heartbreaking this is? 

Also you’re very mistaken on what titles mean. You seem to be making assumptions when I am using fact. “His Royal Highness the Duke of Sussex” is his only title. He will keep “Duke of Sussex” because there are no royal responsibilities associated with this. This was a dukedom gifted by the Queen upon his marriage to Meghan Markle. Everything else he has been called has been earned throughout his life. The fact you say he has “several real titles” - what are they then? He doesn’t. That’s not what a title is."

He has served the royal family for his entire life, he has been subjected to media scrutiny since the moment he was born, watched his mother die due to it, and he tried to make it work with his new family. The media have, however, treated them very poorly and the royal family have done almost nothing in the way of defending them. 

They are giving up pretty much everything that the other royals who don’t play a major role have given up for a less public life, and more; Harry’s cousins, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, also have normal jobs, don’t receive public tax money, still receive private money from their father, still live in apartments in Kensington Palace and St James’ Palace despite having other residences abroad, and retain the title “princess” - nobody has ever had a problem with this. While they don’t receive security, there is no point pretending they’re at the same risk as Harry and Meghan are. Harry is never going to be king, he should be able to live the same life as his cousins. Do explain why he doesn’t deserve this, while Eugenie and Beatrice do."

Edit; yeah I know it’s still a thing, but I’m talking about a time when this was literally your only option. There’s no point pretending there aren’t pirates movies for free all over the internet now and people aren’t always gonna know that happened."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fen6v1j,t1_fen6ksj,1579278270.0,"Again, you happening to know some people who have similar interests or had similar interests growing up doesn’t make this a generational staple. This is technology from literally 50 years ago and was by then actually too rare to be a common thing. The majority of people your age grew up with a wii/Xbox/ps3 and there’s no point pretending otherwise."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fen6jc5,t1_fen1bkw,1579278066.0,Yeah...just because you happened to have tech from like 50 years ago doesn’t mean this is bullshit. You are an exception. This was not a staple of your generation.

learntodraw,fen33ws,t1_fen2z4n,1579275904.0,"You’re right, but they only need moving down to maybe just past the trouser pockets/upper thigh. Definitely not the knees, it would look like an ape for sure."
learntodraw,fen171w,t1_femoege,1579274676.0,"I would suggest first trying out a bent knee and maybe a slightly bent elbow. These are things humans are the most likely to have posed in a photo. Don’t forget that when an arm is bent, the shoulder also shifts slightly. You can use the hair to cover this if it goes wrong so don’t worry too much. Also, the thigh gap is causing an issue, as the inner lines of her legs are dead straight and are pointing outwards when real thighs have oval-like curves inwards towards the knees. The best way to practise is to do gesture motion drawings, practising initially from a photo or subject and then trying from the imagination. This will help you to become more comfortable with capturing different positions and figuring out how each component of the body reacts to the positions of another. Hope this helps :) looking good though."

Jk but seriously no they don’t, certainly not usually."
