succulents,ff46y6z,t1_ff465p1,1579556885.0,"In winter they become kinda dormant so you don’t need to water them too often, and just do a very tiny bit. I think doing less than what you think they need is usually the better route to go in. They thrive on less rather than more. Lots of indirect sunlight is good and a dry fast draining soil is good. You can try repotting. Spider mites are fuzzy and white and are little plant vampires. They leave people alone but suck the life slowly out of your plant. They’re fuzzy and white and you’ll see some webs and small mites if you look closely. I don’t see any in your pic but the way the leaves are dying as they look healthy just reminded me of it. And the way it’s dying. I put rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and spray my plant down. But I wouldn’t jump to that. I’d try changing the soil and repotting"

relationship_advice,fer4fix,t3_eqfd6x,1579349625.0,"My feeling is if you’re not mature enough or capable of sitting someone down and talking about your feelings then you’re not mature enough for a relationship yet. BUT I am proud of you for being honest about not knowing how breakups work and wanting to know. That shows some real maturity. Planning what you want to say and writing down the main points will be helpful. I think the best thing you can do is be honest and gentle. 

I’d tell him that you’ve been feeling very off lately and that you likely need a lot of time to yourself not dating to work on this feeling. That you have a lot of love and respect for him and are grateful to how he was a bf to you. But something has been feeling off in the relationship and in you. My ex wanted to remain friends and while there is no hate between us I’ve never been able to get past the pain of the heartbreak so be prepared that he may not be ready for friendship right away, down the road or even ever even though there may never be bad blood. And be prepared to honour his feelings.

Since you do have love for him as a person, the way you end things should be done as lovingly as you can."

BUT if chemistry had been strong what you asked might not have come off as strong or bothered him as much. Since the chemistry, from what it sounds like, wasn’t so strong this might have made him realize he’s not feeling it. ALSO, it might not be chemistry.

I’m assuming he wasn’t forced or kicked out of his old residence. You could go the extra mile and be an extra good partner and get him some warm socks and bring him the blanket and wrap him up or cuddle with him. Push him to go to a dr if he’s so worried and maybe keep more easy to make meals like oatmeal, pasta, deli meat, eggs etc. I’m from NJ and lived in Canada for around 5 years and dated a Canadian guy who wore a t shirt and jeans all year long.

Don’t let them walk all over you. If it is causing you distress or you see it causing you stress in the future: cut. It. Off. You can only make yourself available you can’t get them to open up to you. If they don’t take your hand you can’t keep sticking your arm down the proverbial well to help them out.

relationship_advice,feahgub,t3_eoa1tr,1578948822.0,"Pick up old interests and hobbies that you alone love. For me something that helped in the immediate now was listening to dog podcasts.

I didn’t watch any shows we enjoyed together for several months and absolutely no romance films. Didn’t listen to music for awhile but eventually made a breakup / thank u next playlist. You definitely need to filter out what you’re going to be listening to for some time. Leaning on friends and family is crucial and throwing yourself into distractions aaaaand taking car of yourself. Drink lots of water because crying dehydrates you, eat something, go for walks, journal, meditate, work out, do yoga, do kickboxing, get moving, drink sleepy time tea or warm milk or whatever you need to do to get some sleep. When you do things know and expect that you won’t find much joy in anything while you’re hurting. It’s cliche AF but eventually time will pass and heal. It will hurt less and less as time goes on."

thisismylifenow,fdply5q,t1_fdpklgq,1578632350.0,"Yes and no...so there are two groups of biting in my opinion. One would be fear and anger and the other group: want and don’t want biting. When the bird is new to you ive heard that you’re not supposed to react to the bite, to take it. Because if they’re still afraid or territorial and angry then they will bite to get you away from them. Only once the bird is bonded to you, which judging from your picture you definitely are bonded friends, you can react to their bites by yelling in pain and distress even exaggerating and take away your attention from the bird. Turn around, or walk away or move the bird another few feet away. If they are bonded to you then birds crave your attention. Needy conures in my experience at least. My bird was FRANTIC to make things right with me and had to LEARN the strength of his own beak. So in part that may be one issue at play here. 

My GCC is a baby at 10 months old and I found he gets over tired and cranky and more likely to bite when he’s been out for awhile and that takes my noticing how long he’s been out and even though he doesn’t want to go in and rest, I have to put him in. He’s been overstimulated. 

Anotherrr thing in the same vein as this is my little guy is VERY excitable and sometimes he gets so excited he forgets himself and nibbles too hard. And sometimes bites out of being in a frenzy of excitement. So the key is to notice what’s got him so excited and not to expose him to that all at once. 

Also because he’s a baby, he’s very nibbly and curious about everything and would bite me a lot due to being nibbly, curious, excited and overstimulated or some convo of those. The key to that problem was to hold a toy and whenever he starts getting bitey, sub in the toy right away. If he gets you, act upset and in pain AND take away your attention to him. Sometimes I put him back in his cage when he bites or move him far from me and tell him “bye bye”. He hates going bye bye now. 

Also, for putting him back, I’m having a bit of the same problem. There are a few things I would do: one I would try to have your bird do a simple trick or two (like stepping up onto your finger) and praise the heck out of him then put him in. Try to make going into his cage a positive experience. Two I use a mini wooden perch to put him back when he’s being very naughty and biting. Three sometimes I bribe him in with a nutriberry or food. Four I wait until he’s at the end of my hand then tuck my hand under my arm or roll it up into my sleeve so he couldn’t get to it and then put him and my arm into his cage with a perch at his feet and slowly pull my arm out until he has nothing to stand on but the perch in front of him. That was kinda tough to explain hopefully the fourth point made sense. 

I honestly thought I had brought home a little velociraptor at first. We had bonded but he liked to sit on me and just gnaw away on my fingers. Since doing all this and realizing his own limits too and his age is a huge factor aaaaand working with or against what he wants has been HUGE. he doesn’t bite me anymore and we’ve grown closer for it."

youseeingthisshit,fdobfgg,t3_ema1iu,1578602151.0,My little pipsqueak of a parrot does this but with like everything I own
AskMen,fdo6t3j,t1_fdo5weo,1578599894.0,I’ve always been scared of that. I know for a fact I wasn’t for my ex. And tbh he wasn’t my dream guy but I WAS crazy for him. Loved the guy. So I guess we don’t have to be “the dream”
AskMen,fdnu5n3,t3_em9w3x,1578592893.0,I wonder how many of us actually get to be someone’s dream girl
Chameleons,fdnk4ws,t3_em3e5t,1578587487.0,Well I think this is cute. But don’t do it again obvi.
PartyParrot,fdn7nso,t1_fdn0fgk,1578579511.0,I candled (using a flashlight) in a dark room my cockatiel’s eggs and it was fine. That being said yes the very bare minimum of contact is ideal.
AskReddit,fdmk5pi,t3_em2vfz,1578552913.0,Does anyone else vacuum their garage. That was a chore of mine and I always kinda thought my dad just made it up to mess with me. I was the only one who had to do it. It could totally be legit but I’ve never heard of or seen anyone do it too. None of my friends ever complained about doing it either
