Half the country isn’t on fire. There’s large patches. You can look at our various state fire pages to see what is really happening.

Its uncontained and large but it will birth new growth eventually. Like it always does. 
X"
mildlyinteresting,fdfy0e9,t1_fdfvyl1,1578373369.0,"This years fires are larger in size than in other years. That means more hectares have burned, more millions of creatures have been killed, and more fire have been joining up into larger systems.  

Combining that with very high temps and sustained droughts in many states, giant fires have occurred. You can’t put out giant fires. 

People have been saying “half of australia is on fire”.  This is not true. 

Fires are burning out of control. 
Some of these fires are massive. 
So large that they are creating their own weather systems. 
They are insurmountable because they are inaccessible. 
They are too large to extinguish. 
A fire front which is hundreds of kilometres long is fed by wind and air and oil in gum trees. There are multitude of these on each fire and there are many fires. 

There are also many reasons for fires. 
Arson, machinery, electricity, nature, etc etc. 

Just over ten years ago, it was Black Saturday in 2009 in Victoria. That was bad fires (400 plus bushfires in the state I live in, close to 200 died that day). Look it up. There was Ash Wednesday when I was young... over 2600 people were injured by the fires that day. In 1974/75 over 15% of the area of Australia was burnt up in the fiercest bushfire season apparently ever recorded here. That was about 117 million hectares of fire. 

But we live with fire. It’s in our blood. 
Because we live in Australia. 
We live in a country ruled by fire, flood and drought.

I have personally witnessed bushfire. I’ve had to evacuate from it many times. I’ve watched lightning strike an old tree and start a bushfire. I’ve seen nature be her mighty self.

I’m smoking between 0 and .5g daily and occasionally I’ll allow myself 1gram if I need help with pain, mental or physical. It helps with my seizures and arthritis heaps. When I was diagnosed with my mental, neuro and personality stuffs, I realised how much the plant was cushioning my experience and allowing me to exist more “softly” in the world. Instead of feeling constant psychic sirens and non stop painful body prodding, I could be at some peace in my body. In my mind. Not high and silly. Just at peace so I can be more available and present. 

Doctors can prescribe it my state and country however it is  too expensive for somebody who is on a disability support pension. 

I take maybe 30 pills per day. I hate it. Been on medication since I was 5. 
Rolling a smoke two or three times a day, with crushed up plant in it, sitting quietly with the earth and breathing it in, that feels more natural than 30 or 40 pills of varied colors each day. 

These thoughts are mine only.

Are you living in government or community housing? 

Our keyless fobs often stop working. People in wheelchairs get stuck on level 1 through to 8 and can’t get down. The only fire escape is via a crowded bin room that can’t fit larger sized power chairs. The building i live in isn’t managed 
well. People vandalise the communication and access boards that are on the street. This stops anyone from getting in or out until it’s fixed. There is very little soundproofing to the outside world. The unit stays hot a lot. The shower is pretty much unusable for a cripple. 

The benefits of the building are the communal laundrette on the first floor (it is alway empty, nobody bothers you there and it’s fairly priced), it’s proximity to all my specialists and the hospitals, good soundproofing between the levels, and lastly, i love diversity of mob within the building.

My space is about 4m x 9m.
It’s too small for my brain. 

Also if we lose a key it’s $45 to replace. 
A fob is $30 to replace. 
I pay $200 a week for rent. 
No utilities are included.

I’m currently on a waiting list for another advocacy group. It’s been 6 weeks. My carer says I’ve probably fallen off their list. I now have more paperwork and another three diagnoses, so I’ll keep waiting and try and stay clear of the CAT team. 

NDIS has been really disappointing and strange. They’ve written me letters saying my disabilities were permanent or lifelong. I’ve had them for my entire life though. My doctors say they are permanent. But a non medical government person decided that I’m not cripple enough. So messed up. Very broken system. 

Appreciate your thoughts. Go well and keep safe."

Frankston would be a holiday."
neurodiversity,fc5hd4e,t3_ega9pr,1577457629.0,"I want a window. 
And sound proofing. 
I live in community housing in the city of Melbourne and I have one window in my tiny unit. That window faces a giant apartment building full of faceless strangers. I hate it. It disconnects me from anything that is alive or organic. I would do anything for a window that lets me see the sky or a tree.
The unit sits on a state highway and is constantly surrounded by sirens, screams and fights from the outside world and I spend days at a time not sleeping. The building itself is volatile with stabbings and all sorts of crazy shit going on in it. I need soundproofing. Yeah.

First I’d like to get the ndis though. (ASD, BPD, Lupus, epilepsy, arthritis, tunnel vision, etc etc)."

Also, have you read up about borderline personality disorder? It’s similar in some of the ways it manifests and takes a psychologist to determine the difference. I have both."
autism,fc5g2x2,t1_fbaqzsv,1577456581.0,"There are many treatments for it though, including medications to treat some symptoms of the disorder. 

This is why diagnosis is useful. Without a diagnosis, one ambles around wondering what can be done and by whom. 

With a diagnosis, one is able to access peak bodies to support you, to access national disability services, to understand oneself more, to be able to get particular behaviour treated (compulsive behaviours such as skin picking and hair piling) by psychiatrists via medication more readily. 

I’m 44 and female. I was just diagnosed a couple of weeks ago by a psychiatrist. It was completely unexpected. Everything is changing now. Medication Is being overhauled. There will be some help for my social issues. 

Be well, be at peace, good luck with your journey and understand much is to be gained by being diagnosed for most people."

todayilearned,fc4ytmj,t1_fc3i61v,1577434416.0,"Because this is my country. 
Because I wouldn’t move my life for an insect. 
Because I love this place. 
Because I’d rather be harrassed by a big spider than a big person or a big gun. 

I don’t understand why anyone would move because of an insect. 

Each to their own."

BPD,fc4fjm3,t3_eg00ta,1577415195.0,"Yes. 
I have BPD and ASD and lots of cripply body things. I’ve found myself with no friends because I say too much and people can’t relate. They just leave me alone. 
I get it. 
The last new person I met, they just said “wow you sound really f’ed up” after 10 minutes. 
I want so much to be normal-er. 
To have people I can relate to. 
I wish I had something to do on New Year’s Eve. 
I wish I wasn’t alone on Christmas. 
But there you go. I’m alone and I’m fcked up."
todayilearned,fc4duv2,t1_fc2h3a3,1577413808.0,I don’t believe fumes can be an issue. The millipedes use it as a protective feature. Quite a few millipedes have this ability to self protect against other insects with cyanide.
