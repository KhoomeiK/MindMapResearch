EatCheapAndHealthy,ffdn1qt,t3_esnrfw,1579824368.0,"I didn't read other peoples comments, so I don't know if my \*secret\* oatmeal recipe has been shared. My big secret is to cook the oatmeal in the microwave with frozen fruit (frozen blueberries or cherries). Reduce the amount of water you use to cook the oats slightly because the juices from the frozen fruit will be released. The juices make the oatmeal sooo tasty. I also add in peanut butter powder or vanilla protein powder and some cocoa nibs, but that is your call."

socialanxiety,ff8o98w,t3_es7kxf,1579688584.0,"Ugh I have had quite a few jobs like this. The jobs I've had as face-to-face customer service I either quit or was let go at the end of my probation because I wasn't outgoing enough. At my last job, which was in social services, I tried to fake it til I made it, and even though I actually was doing OK, I kept telling my bosses that it was my weak point. I kept saying that I felt anxiety talking to people, which was true, but they began to view me as actually having this weakness even though they had never directly observed me. In the end they let me go at the end of probation, ultimately due to my poor self reporting and low confidence. 

My point is... maybe fake-it-til-you-make-it and outwardly saying you are confident even though both things may not be true. Also another thing that helped me was having social scripts. With co-workers, I try to at least do small talk (weather, weekend, traffic, etc). Then, I also do a convo script that included: Comment, Connection, Question. That means making a comment about something the other person said or has, connecting it to your life, and then asking them a question about themselves. For example.. co worker: I like your bag; me: thanks! (comment) i bought it in Hawaii (connection); co worker: cool dude; me: have you been to hawaii? (question)

OK yeah, sorry for long post. Good luck\~"

I'm sorry about what your partner said, I know it can be hard when you feel like you're a burden. Just know you're not alone in the struggle."
depression,ff8i95o,t3_es7b6m,1579679700.0,"It could've been me who wrote this. I have been feeling like this recently, but I try to think about people who I know who have killed themselves, and how that impacted those around them forever. Then I think about my loved one (yes, just one for me), and try to picture them having to spend the rest of their life in pain. I may not love myself, but I love them too much."
depression,fby4mvr,t1_fbwkn6m,1577207982.0,"I love sleeping for this reason, too. I learned how to do this as a kid because I would often be left at home alone without anything to do and no one to talk to. I would fall asleep just to pass time and still continue to this day."
