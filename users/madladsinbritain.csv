Kenshi,ff78yv2,t3_ers3op,1579643477.0,Good holiday resort after all those beak things. It is strange to find such a popular resort so close to another popular resort in the ashlands (cat-lon's dome).
SuicideWatch,fesxrcx,t1_fespqn1,1579370013.0,"I only think so because if they want to dominate their child, controlling their child's life seems to be the ultimate dominance. Essentially driving you to suicide is letting them have this ultimate dominance

Edit: I am only 14 and haven't had this problem, but I can imagine it is tough. On the bright side you are 17 and won't need to suffer through it much longer. I am not a psychiatrist so I shouldn't really say these things but I hope my words carry some weight."

im14andthisisdeep,fcwh2og,t3_eivs6d,1578025440.0,"I would have helped not to be nice but just cos it would be boring if I didn't help them.

The people who don't help are probably boring. A usual person would help probably for some sort of pay, whether that be the good feeling or material goods. It is hard not to benefit in this situation, whether it is someone like me who just wants drama and entertainment or the average person. The other people are just so incredibly boring.

Anyway have a good one."

im14andthisisdeep,fc2mmhm,t3_efmct4,1577367244.0,"It will only be a matter of time before the father will realise that the mother is cheating on him for a baby,his baby.

Luckily the child can brag in school that he was in a relationship since he was just a year old.

Until the accident occurred where the dad killed the mother by driving a car off a cliff killing the mother. The father then went to court but just said incest is wincest to the judge, then he understood the situation and locked the child up in prison.

Plot twist the child was adopted and the dad was 30 now so he had a real kid with no crimes and it was all good.




Until the DLC comes out
