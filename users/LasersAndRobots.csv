AskReddit,ff96kfj,t1_ff8z1pk,1579706037.0,"Its important to note that honeybees are a single species, and one not native to North America at that.

There also seems to be a pretty solid consensus on the cause of colony collapse disorder: inbreeding. Domestic honeybees have been too intensely managed, and now the problems are starting to show.

While honeybees are significant pollinators, they unfortunately also vastly overshadow native pollinators, which account for the other 80% of pollination services in North America. But they don't produce honey, so nobody cares about them, despite the fact that habitat fragmentation, pesticide use and competition from wild honeybees are causing them to decline at a faster rate than domestic honeybees."
AskReddit,ff961jv,t1_ff8ral9,1579705684.0,"The main logic for meat being more damaging comes from trophic theory. Generally, in any food web, about 10% of the available energy in a food source is passed up to whatever consumes is. 

So roughly speaking, 100 calories of meat requires 1000 calories of grain to produce. While beef is more of a complete food, cattle pasturing is the leading driver for deforestation (somewhere on the order of 40%), to say nothing of all the methane burps (which is 12 times as intense a ghg as co2).

Obviously, it's not as cut and dry as that, since there's a whole bunch of other issues that muddy the waters further, but in general reducing your meat intake does reduce your environmental impact."

We don't have the resources to support 1 billion people at that standard of living, let alone 7. If we did, we wouldn't be suffering the ecological problems we currently have.

The problem is both overpopulation and overconsumption. Problem is, aging people also consume proportionately more resources and contribute fewer, further muddying the waters.

Unfortunately, that expansion also released a bunch of cards that can get very powerful benefits from consuming food tokens. He can also use his +1 to turn food tokens into 3/3s, meaning he can make a 3/3 every other turn for free. Or he can just turn your biggest, scariest threat into a vanilla 3/3. And then steal it in exchange for a worthless food token next turn. And then with all that, he's in Simic colours (green-blue) which are very, \*very\* good at ramping. Meaning that any Oko deck can reliably get him out on turn 2.

Needless to say, he didn't just warp the Standard meta. He \*defined\* it. Oko decks were so common that people were maindecking green and blue hate cards (which do nothing against white, red and black by the way and therefore should not be in the maindeck) to deal with him.

But at the same time, this isn't like the CUPE union at York University. It's not a problematic union that just looks for excuses to strike. The province is being unreasonable and the stuff that it's trying to push through will be far more damaging to classrooms, students and teachers than a period of labor action. 

The simple facts are that the current labour action isn't about wages. It's about class sizes, layoffs, budget cuts and lack of support for special ed students. Larger class sizes are exponentially more difficult to manage (I work in classrooms as a workshop presenter and can attest to this), a reasonable budget is necessary to keep classrooms moving smoothly, and some special ed students (non-verbal autism, violent outbursts, etc) are difficult to impossible to integrate into typical classroom environments.

outerwilds,fdnee24,t3_elkcpt,1578584023.0,"This is a game that very, very much is not for everyone. First, it has a huge emphasis on exploration and figuring out answers for yourself. Some people don't want that. They want objective markers, guidance, something that tells them what to do. 

This is a game with huge amounts of implicit storytelling, and more importantly one that doesn't play by typical video game rules. In any other game, the first time you read about the Sun Station, you'd get a little thing saying ""new objective: investigate the sun station."" But Outer Wilds has a diagetic UI, one where every UI element (excluding button prompts) is physically present in the game world, so the only prompting that it's something to investigate lies in the Ship's Log, which the game also doesn't direct you towards (because why would it? It's your ships log. Duh). 

Every puzzle is also a ""well how do I get here"" thing. The most video-gamey the puzzles ever get is learning the rule of quantum imaging. But people are used to Zelda-esque puzzles, especially in exploration based games.

Lastly, Outer Wilds is a game where your enjoyment depends 100% on your immersion. That's why it utilizes a mostly diagetic UI, and intentionally ignores most of the conventional rules of video game design and puzzles. It wants you to be afraid of dying, even though its inevitable. And most people can't really project themselves like that. And the moment you start looking at it as a video game, the illusion is shattered and the bubble of enjoyment bursts.

todayilearned,fcvsf8s,t1_fcv6yu5,1578009057.0,"It all has to do with osmosis. Osmosis relies on having a semi-permeable membrane: something that only water can travel through. Because water can flow freely, it likes to form an equilibrium as far as ion concentrations are concerned on either side of the membrane.

If one side has a higher absolute concentration than the other, water will naturally flow across the membrane into the more concentrated part, and vice versa. You can test this yourself by taking two raw eggs, plunking them in vinegar to dissolve the shells, and then placing one in salt water and one in fresh water. The one in salt water will shrivel as water flows out of the egg into the surroundings, and the one in fresh water will swell as water flows inwards.

In the case of these birds, the organ in question contains extremely high salt concentrations, which sucks the water away and leaves pockets of highly concentrated salt that is then excreted in a tear-like manner. There's also presumably some ion gates (proteins that separate out ions but allow water to pass) that then bring the absorbed water out of the gland (I'm not entirely sure about this, and the biological mechanism doesn't seem to be fully understood)."
