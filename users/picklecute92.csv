doterra,fc5g7m6,t3_e1c2s5,1577456690.0,Interesting trend I’m seeing here. One of my aunts is a sales rep for doTERRA and I recently came across a post on her FB page stating that her oils have the abilities to restore sensorineural hearing loss secondary to meningitis. Big yikes if you ask me. To think that people representing the company will do or say anything to make money really is something.
