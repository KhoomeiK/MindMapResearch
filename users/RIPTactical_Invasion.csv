depression,fewdmxu,t3_eqc90a,1579408838.0,"Same Ive been lethargic as fuck these past two days - turns out it’s cause I was forgetting my meds and I haven’t had classes because of the snow. 


Just played piano for 3 hours and reached out to some friends I haven’t talked to recently. Force yourself to get started on something and the actions will automatically wake you up. If you didn’t do it today, that’s fine. Don’t beat yourself up, There’s always tomorrow. Set goals and fucking work to cross them off the list. I know you can do it. fight the lies your brain is telling you."
imveryedgy,fefqbn0,t3_eouk7a,1579062179.0,This isn’t overly edgy it’s just a risky joke with social commentary about a fucked up part of American society.

depression,fe3h0ls,t3_enp2m9,1578849171.0,You can’t always understand how I’m feeling right now and that’s ok. The best thing people can do is not act weird when I break out of isolation. That and maybe reach out to me on occasion...

imveryedgy,fclbwhi,t1_fcktvvc,1577744256.0,Tru it’d be better if it was more subtle in its implications. Instead they just gotta be like GET IT SEX WITH THE DEAD BODY IS WHAT HE WANTED ALL ALONG which is just ruining the shock humor with edge
MakeMeSuffer,fcjekvl,t3_ehe4ew,1577684823.0,"Fuuuuuuuuuuuucking hell this is by far the most sufferable content I’ve ever seen on this subreddit. From the racist comments to the NSFL image and implications. 



thank you for this aneurism"

Fuck this disease."
bluehairbitch,fci42to,t1_fci0cbl,1577657534.0,Lmao all good. I like saying hoe cause it’s less misogynistic and it’s more about thirstiness as oppose to making random assumptions about how much sex someone has.
bluehairbitch,fcht9hh,t1_fcg3tes,1577653856.0,"This shirt doesn’t make her a slut, it makes her a hoe. Big difference"
depression,fchsv0e,t3_eh3tww,1577653726.0,"First of all it’s understandable that you feel that way. But you talked to this girl for 25 days in a row. That sounds like serious interest on her part and she sees something wonderful in you. If she is worth your time, getting limp won’t change her opinion of you. 




My first kiss was just clanking teeth and bumping noses.


First fuck was rubbing bodies together tryna stick my dick in her stomach. 


Deadass took me like three tries to finally lose my virginity. You already did the hard part tho!!! (no pun intended) You’re IN there and you have the capability to get to that point again. If not her, then someone else."
depression,fc3x9ie,t3_efyc5z,1577400989.0,"I LITERALLY JUST CAME TO A REALIZATION OF THIS LAST NIGHT. 


I’m pretty starved of dopamine so whenever I hookup with some random tinder thot (like once or twice a year lmao) my illness tells me that I’m in love and NEED to be with this person. It’s not true in the slightest and it makes me feel like a total dumbass after the fact, but at least I realized it eventually. My perceived loneliness is better dealt with regular medication and socialization which is actually much harder than a depression-relationship but is so much healthier."
depression,fc3w2vr,t1_fc3vb4a,1577400113.0,"Accepting that you must make your own meaning is good, but the staring in itself is pointless. Our perception of life is being totally fucked with by a mental illness. Whatever my brain tells me life is, it probably isn’t that. This sucks cause we rely so much on our perceptions, but we can still literally retrain our brain to better cope with falsehoods caused by depression. 


“Oh I shouldn’t call or text this person cause they aren’t my real friend” - bullshit 


“I’m a fuckup who is doomed to repeat the same mistakes so I shouldn’t bother trying” - bullshit


“no one would care if I died since life has no meaning” BULLSHIT


If you can’t tell I treat my illness like some dumbass bully so it’s easier for me to get angry at it and see how it can be dealt with. I wanna get a punching bag with my mental illnesses printed all over it lmao"
depression,fc3v2po,t1_fc3acva,1577399380.0,Yes but telling the vacuum of the void to fuck off and spitefully throwing efforts into it regardless of its apparent infinite depth also beats staring into it.
depression,fc3uksw,t3_efwqy4,1577399015.0,"Pardon my French, but the fuckin universe is going to keep expanding until stars are so far apart everything freezes!There’s still a lot of shit to explore in it before that happens though! If it’s possible for us to discover more galaxies, we should.


What we do know is that it IS possible for us to live a little longer and see what the next year, month, day, or even minute brings. We aren’t born with a drive to want to see this future for ourselves, but that doesn’t mean we can’t make a really good one. 


When I can’t find purpose, I go to a park and read, get some interesting new tea, or see how many sit-ups I can do. None of these things will make me memorable in 100 years, but I can talk to other people about them now. it makes me feel decent when I finally get to that point, but it’s not about that point at all, it’s about taking the first step to do something and making your own definition of life. 


I’m not the best at explaining my thoughts so sorry if this sounds cheesy"
depression,fbx27dd,t3_ees67s,1577166456.0,You are showing an immense amount of stoic strength! Stoic philosophy is all about preparing for those shitty days and not letting the illness control our response. You should look into Meditations by Marcus Aurelius if you like analytical-style therapy.
