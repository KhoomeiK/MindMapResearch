I have a lot of kids with 504‚Äôs/IEP‚Äôs (where their issues or learning disabilities are documented by the school for accommodations).  I also have the kids answer some fun/serious questions at the beginning of the year and I always ask if there is anything I should know (after I go through how the class will be run) and I always get a few who say they are scared to read out loud so I don‚Äôt force them.    It‚Äôs interesting though because once they are comfortable with me and the class, I have only had one kid not volunteer to read (he was non-verbal autistic).  It‚Äôs amazing what a positive atmosphere can do!!

I teach 10th grade world history and the curriculum is document heavy.  Part of the problem is the 1st semester is BORING and the words/style are hard for the kids (think 1200‚Äôs-1800‚Äôs).  Once we hit Imperialism and the 20th Century, engagement goes up because first it‚Äôs easier for them but it‚Äôs also more familiar.  Especially WWII.  They LIVE for WWII.   They don‚Äôt know who Napoleon is but every year every kid knows Hitler."
