unpopularopinion,fdqyw4a,t3_emsqiz,1578677026.0,"I think you misunderstand what open mindedness means. Being open minded doesn't mean not having your own opinions. It doesn't mean not having strong opinions. It doesn't mean that you won't defend your opinions. It doesn't even mean you won't be an asshole to certain people with certain opinions.

It means that you are willing to listen to others opinions and beliefs. Genuinely evaluate them, while doing your best to keep your bias in check. It means being able to change your own opinions and beliefs when presented with sufficient evidence to the contrary. Being able to admit that you are wrong. Being able to let yourself view something from someone else's perspective and maybe understand why they believe what they believe."
