cats,ffe773s,t3_et4h3j,1579838538.0,"I have had 6 cats over the years and none of them have liked being on a lap. They have all been very loving cats that love being petted, one even likes to sleep on the pillow above my head and also likes riding around on your shoulder, but not a single one would sit on my lap. Some cats just aren’t lap cats, you just have to let them decide how much attention and affection they want from you."

I was one of the unfortunate few overweight ones, I’ve been overweight most of my life but do not subscribe to the bullshit that it’s healthy to be fat."

caloriecount,fej64q2,t3_epfe4v,1579158447.0,"You need more food and probably less coffee. If all you ate all day long was what you have listed no wonder you feel sick, that amount of food sounds more like one meal. Also coffee is very acidic especially on an empty stomach. Try eating small meals of 300-400 calories each 3 times a day for 400 calorie meals or 4 times a day for 300 calorie meals, either way totals 1200 calories. I think that will help you feel much better."

mildlyinfuriating,fec6g7x,t3_eoe7dj,1578967436.0,Why do men have such a hard time urinating in the fucking right place? I was using the unisex restroom at the dentist right after an older man and I had to put paper towels down by the toilet and soak up the pee so I didn’t have to step in it. Pretty bad to have to clean up after some stranger.

cats,fea3phf,t3_eo8spf,1578944041.0,"I don’t know that you can actually train a cat but as far as bad behavior as long as you kitten proof your house (any wiring hanging down, window blind pulls etc) they really don’t have any bad behavior other than sharpening their claws on your furniture which isn’t bad just an instinct. Get them a cat tree thing if you can, plenty of toys, keep the litter box very clean ( try the breeze litter box system for a stink free house) and feed them on some kind of schedule you are good to go. Having 2 kittens together is so much fun they are very entertaining to watch and play with. They will learn their names just from hearing you call them and talk to them. Most importantly enjoy!"
Bakersfield,fe3zkpf,t3_enr4c3,1578854356.0,I think they have a sauna in the locker room at InShape at least the one on Coffee Rd does. They have indoor and outdoor pools but not sure about a hot tub.

fatlogic,fe02tgo,t3_enibgq,1578801664.0,"This fat phobia bullshit is really getting absurd. As a few people have already mentioned, if you lose weight you probably won’t need breast reduction surgery but if you still do you will have a much better chance of safe surgery and full recovery. She would be the type to sue if something went wrong because of her weight."

loseit,fdtnhyk,t3_en2qui,1578719331.0,"It’s very difficult to keep that motivation going, gaining weight and getting fatter and fatter is effortless but taking it off is just so hard. It’s hard to go hungry or not have that donut that looks so, so good. Losing weight is a very slow process but you have to take it day by day and not get discouraged. I don’t really know of any tricks to get into that mindset, for me it was being tired of buying my clothes in the plus size department so 2 months ago I started counting those calories and the pounds are slowly coming off and I’m determined to be able to shop in the normal sized section of the store by spring even if I have to buy the biggest size there. Set a date to start and get started. If you slip up just start again the next day."

cats,fdtjqlc,t3_en2rz1,1578717756.0,Cats like to be up high so if you can afford a cat tower (they are rather expensive) get one. I’ve also seen where people put shelves on the wall to be kind of like steps up the wall for them. Also being able to see out if a window or door is good especially if there is a bird feeder where they can see the birds.
