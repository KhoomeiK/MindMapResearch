coolguides,ffbjd91,t1_ffbfdcg,1579768051.0,"There's very few medical implants that keep anyone alive, they're generally more for keeping people from dying or for keeping existing conditions from exacerbating (like most pacemakers). So bricking the vast majority of them would really be far more of a giant annoyance than inherently lethal.

About the telemetry/programming interfaces, I admit I don't know very much about the specific protocols but you would need bidirectional communications. The device is not going to trustingly accept instructions from just any signal that it receives. Even amongst similar units, you're going to need to broadcast unit specific signals (you can't program them en masse) which would normally require you to receive an active signal from them first that you initiate with an electric field (kind of like the way RFID tags work.. but less dumb, in an alien language, and interactive). There's nothing you could do to get a device to transmit with very much energy in any circumstance as that is very tightly and deliberately controlled. 

As for backdoors.. Unless something has changed in the last few years, the elements in these devices don't have or need anything like that. You're going to be using components engineered and designed specifically to be implanted inside a body (from the idea stage) and whose manufacturing, not to mention materials, is very tightly governed and documented. Pacemakers aren't going to be sharing any components with your cell phone, not even simple resistors and capacitors (the ones in your phone would be extremely poisonous inside of your body, the last thing you would want is a capacitor blowing inside your anti-seizure device and leaking some poisonous electrolyte.. inside your brain). Sure a cell phone manufacturer could contract with a medical supplier to source similar components for their phones.. but those phones would also cost five or six figures for them to make.

Medical devices are also not multi-purpose computers and are almost purely hardware. They are ""pure"" devices, purpose designed and built from the idea stage through to implantation.

They're similar to all of the things you mentioned in that they run on electricity and a lot of theoretical and EE stuff, but that's about where the similarities end. Unless you're an engineer whose whole job is designing them, you're not going to know how to work with or interact them. And unless you spend your days interacting with them, you're not going to have the necessary equipment unique to each design, nor the capability to do so.

They're just not something really inside the realm of electronics warfare, short of zapping someone who possesses one with enough current or force to kill anyone."

AskReddit,ffbi7ad,t1_ffb35ny,1579766461.0,In my experience looking intimidating vs inviting is much more about body language and less about muscularity.

AskReddit,ffbh7s4,t1_ffatmu6,1579765163.0,"> work on your conversational skills

In the very early 2000's, before dating apps were ***the*** way people met, I had a somewhat serious gamer roommate in college, and I couldn't second this advice enough. 

I got out of lab late so we used to wander up to another dorm together for a slightly late dinner. This was time of evening when all of the girls were relaxedly lounging around in their pajamas snacking. Invariably we'd sit near a group of ladies (not being creepy or invasive, someone would usually recognise one of us and wave us over) and I'd strike up a conversation, asking questions about what they were studying at the moment or where they were from ect. They always made for great conversation over a dinner of chicken tenders and fries. However, I also was in a long distance relationship so not looking for an invitation back to their room or a phone number. (A relationship which turned out to be a very painful mistake.. who could have foreseen that right?..) So the problem was that I'd end up at the center of some protracted conversation or debate, and my roomate.. not so much. He was somewhat the opposite of me and pretty shy, so I was always trying to egg him on into asking someone out or ask what he thought to almost forcibly bring him into the conversation. He was always eager and kind of like my little birdy that I wanted to learn from observation and hoped familiarity would help him get more comfortable around women. I really wanted him to meet someone so I could have more alone time on the phone with my girlfriend, but also just  to see him soar where I could not as it were. But alas, every time he'd start talking exclusively about himself. About this game or that boss fight that they had no interest in, or familiarity with. Maybe he'd start in about his favorite band (that nobody has ever heard of), whom only idiots didn't recognise was the best band ever. His nervousness would spur him to get going on such a roll, that he would forget to take a breath and leave them enough space to even ask him questions. Like people aren't going to want to hang around and get to know the other awesome qualities you possess if you make it difficult and disengaging for them to interact with you. I tried my best to be a good wingman to him and gave him pointers whenever he asked, but sadly he never really learned. He's married now though so, he must have figured it out at some point.

Remember guys, we all want to be of consequence and interest to other people, at least someone, if not everyone. Everyone finds learning about, being engaged, and getting to educate others on subjects, including themselves, that they're interested in rewarding. People will want to be around someone with not just their own ideas to discuss, but who **also** lets them be heard and contemplating *their* ideas with them will let them feel listened to.

Having conversation skills means having skills in the methodology of relating with one another and in making time spent together feel constructive and compelling. It doesn't mean being hugely knowledgeable or especially authoritative on any or all subjects. Many of the most engaging and inviting conversations consist mainly of asking vulnerable questions and pondering the answers together. 

The best tip I can give, is to just make sure you give inviting and encouraging cues (open up your body language and cues like smiling when someone starts talking to you) and over time just let other people talk. Ask them questions and remember finding a way to genuinely enjoy hearing someone else's thoughts, or about what makes them excited, without needing any kind of victory to keep you interested (that is a debate, not a conversation), is an end in and of itself. Be patient, open to listening, and consistent, that will more often than not lead you where you want to go with someone."

There IS always a non-contact way to adjust the programming as needed, but it sure as hell doesn't run over wifi or anything you're going to utilize without extremely specialized hardware and getting all up in the patient's personal space. Medical implants are hardware circuits built from components specifically designed and approved to be inside of someone (not parts just anyone could order off of Aliexpress and download the spec sheet on off of the web). Any transmitter/receiver is going to be extremely low-energy and wouldn't work from more than a few inches away, and it certainly wouldn't communicate in any commercial or consumer general purpose protocol you're going to know. And even if you communicated with it, you could just adjust things by setting registers, things that the patient would immediately notice, you absolutely wouldn't be able to magically upload some kind of code or virus. That's just not.. not how any of that works.

politics,ffb7bun,t1_ffb5hac,1579753783.0,"In my mind, Obama's biggest failing was not taking a lot of the warnings that were brought to him internally and from our allies, as seriously as he should have. Every retelling I have read in biographies and written accounts of people communicating with his administration about things like the Alt-Right becoming cohesive and/or weaponized, Cambridge Analytica and the entit(ies) that preceded it's efforts around the globe, Those efforts being courted by Republican campaign managers, conservative think tanks, and GOP mega-donors. Involves the feedback that they didn't see it as a real or significant threat to democracy (though to be fair few did), and Obama was too afraid of stirring the pot/rocking the boat with the Republicans to investigate, and by virtue of doing so, allow such allegations to see the light of day. I don't blame Obama for any of it, anyone in his position might have stayed the same course. It's just a failure that tremendously impacted the 2016 election and that we're still dealing with today."
