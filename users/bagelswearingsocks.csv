wholesomememes,feiylth,t1_feiup17,1579150873.0,"Just getting to read your username is enough to warrant a “backatcha,” u/Stoney_McTitsForDays.  at bare minimum you’ve moderately delighted me"
wholesomememes,feirpmk,t1_feiqchf,1579145519.0,"This would be such a stupid thing to lie about lol it was embarrassing as fuck. that was my actual reaction; given that I’m a relatively dramatic person on a normal day, it would seem that I’ve turned positively histrionic either due to my claustrophobia and anxiety or to the handful of sedatives I took to manage them"
wholesomememes,feijdno,t3_epa68l,1579139888.0,never physically reacted to a meme-induced emotion before but I just tossed my phone away and moaned “oh fuck...my heaaaaart” (loudly). I’m on a crowded airplane.
badroommates,fei7rvb,t3_ep9x5o,1579132178.0,"You should talk to your roommate. As a matter of fact, both you and your SO should talk to your roommate since she got the brunt of his yelling. Find out why he was upset - he’s not wrong to say that he needs boundaries. You shouldn’t move or kick him out based on his desire to have them - you need to make that decision based on whether or not the boundaries he’s asking for are reasonable"
AmItheAsshole,fdhp6dy,t1_fdgwb35,1578427383.0,"This is why my lease has a “one additional occupant” clause, which i believe says that if someone moves in with me without being added to the lease, they are subject to terms that restrict their rights to the apartment. Like they can’t continue to occupy the space if I move, they don’t get squatters rights, and they are explicitly not a tenant even if they live here for as long as I do. The way I understood it was that the additional occupant has equal tenant rights as a nanny or house sitter would."
badroommates,fdew8ay,t3_ekxwrp,1578347894.0,"They make kits to test for contamination on walls and hard surfaces. Maybe start there to confirm there’s been contamination. To be honest serious contamination is very unlikely unless you have reason to suspect the place was used as a full-blown meth lab. If you do end up finding [a significant amount](https://www.drugfoundation.org.nz/news-media-and-events/in-the-wake-of-the-meth-testing-scam-practical-advice-for-homeowners-and-landlords/) of residue, the general consensus about how to proceed seems to be:

-	Replace contaminated curtains, blinds, and linens
-	Have carpets professionally cleaned by a normal upholstery cleaner 
-	Wash smooth walls and repaint; remove any textured wall surfaces or wallpaper 
-	Floors: wash tile; sand down wood and reseal. Wash and reseal laminate or vinyl. 
-	Thoroughly wash windows several times using a clean cloth for each wash
-	For a house contaminated by meth **use** thorough, repeated washing with everyday products (Lysol, bleach, and detergent) is sufficient. 
-	For a house contaminated by meth **production**, it’s probably best to hire a professional cleaning service that specializes in drug contamination."
juul,fc21f4s,t1_fc14tsu,1577336645.0,Or even refilling pods. $20 for a bottle of nic salt liquid that lasts me a month (and I was buying 4 packs of pods every 2-3 days)
AskReddit,fbzwsk2,t1_fbzvkt7,1577265867.0,Not LGA right now!!!! It’s under construction and is a literal nightmare. Even JFK is better at the moment. Every other day cars can’t even go all the way to the terminal at LaGuardia so you have to take shuttle buses that are even worse than normal public transit
