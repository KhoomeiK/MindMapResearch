Debt ""repayment"": government steps in, says ""ah, I see an insurance company said that due to a negotiation they made with a hospital which you were not party to and only very indirectly agreed to, you owe $36,000 for three stitches. Sounds like a fair price to me, we just don't think you should pay it. Here's $36,000\*, corrupt business!""

\*this will likely be negotiated down to an amount which is likely to actually be collected. eg: If the debt holder thinks you're only 50% likely to pay $36,000, they'll sell it for a minimum of $18,000.

Because, as far as I'm aware, he's not in a position where he can reliably be said to be the bottleneck, for pure financial reasons, then I'd said that ""he's making bank"" is not one of the reason's why he's focusing on Rick & Morty.

Because, if he were making beyond that specific threshold from it, I presume we'd see more episodes. Because as far as I'm aware he's not currently the bottleneck, and if he were making beyond that specific threshold, he'd be able to get people who are the bottleneck to stop being the bottleneck.

I think about that episode regularly, especially around this time of year, for obvious reasons.

The thing that gets me the most is: the system has no concept of a breakdown in fidelity of the simulation. It has no reason to. If it did, that would be a bug. Once stable, the simulation will work forever. Were a ""real"" human mind trapped in that situation, it would break down, shut down, escape into fantasy, destroy itself. But that doesn't happen here: Every individual moment is *exactly* as lucid as the next, for thousands of times longer than all of human history. Given that amount of time, a single individual could maybe learn to accept their situation, could meditate, could ponder life, could even do great works, solve problems, re-derive every formula and every philosophy from base principles. Could be a god in their own world.

Except part of the simulation's objective is to maintain itself, and it was made in a rush. It's a tiny area, and it maintains itself by ""resetting"" when something goes out of place. A single bug, a simple omission in that ""reset"" code, the tiniest mistake, meant that the audio didn't reset, and played on top of itself. And it took several attempts to realise what was going on.

So instead of an eternity of peace and solitude, even the hope of a potential for quiet, thoughtful reflection, there is all of the endless sea of time stretched out before them, again in perfect fidelity, impossible to escape, and during it all: Impossible to even *think*.

All because of hastily-written code and a split-second decision that wasn't even given a thought of the implications.

But the meetings that lead to those votes? The negotiations that set the text of what will actually be voted on? Those are absolutely vital, and missing those means not taking part in the process, and not actually acting as a representative.

Worse: voting for (or against) something after not taking part in the discussions beforehand, when your input was specifically one of the ones which had been asked for? That's much worse than not voting at all."

television,fc5762m,t1_fc4xcx6,1577446694.0,"I would say that much less than half of the information on most TV shows is visual. Most TV shows are either conversations or monologs, sometimes with a small amount of visual information added to help. Unless it's something like 3blue1brown, the visuals rarely add much extra.

And if the visuals *do* add something extra, you are usually cued-in to this via something audible (eg: musical sting, pause in conversation, or literally someone mentioning that someone should look at something), at which point it's easy enough to look up. Or if something else is distracting, you can easily pause and shift focus for a moment. eg: I just paused Impulse & Skizzleman to finish typing this, so that I can more-easily glance up at the action if something happens.

If I don't want to miss something in one thing ot the other, I'll pause one to switch focus. Switching focus takes very little effort, and it's *usually* easy to tell when something worthy of switching focus is going to happen in the near future.

If I feel like I've missed anything, and I care, then I'll watch it again. If I don't want to watch it again, then it probably wasn't appealing enough to fully focus on once.

television,fc56jgp,t1_fc4u2gy,1577445771.0,"Most TV shows work fine as audio dramas with occasional images for context. My enjoyment of individual shows does go up when they have my full attention, but it is rare that my enjoyment of the moment goes up more than it does by simultaneously playing minecraft.

When I find that I am fully entertained, I don't bother using an additional screen.

Things which are good, I tend to watch multiple times. eg: watching once by myself while not paying attention, then realising it's good, and re-watching, with full attention, with someone else. or the opposite: watching with full attention with someone else, then re-watching while not fully paying attention.

The amount of things that are noticed on a second viewing tends to go up by the same amount regardless of whether that second viewing is in ""paying attention"" mode or not.


tl;dr: If something is worth paying attention to, attention is drawn to it. If you are annoyed by your friends dicking around with their phones while you're trying to show them something, maybe the thing you're watching doesn't appeal to them, or maybe they are just treating this as an initial pass."

AskReddit,fbtwpht,t1_fbtc8ah,1577099925.0,"I am perfectly capable of cooking rice, perfectly, every time, using just a stove and a pot. It's never been a problem for me. I have never thought that cooking rice was ""hard"" or that I needed some device to do it for me.

And yet getting a rice-cooker made life so much easier.

Yes, I am perfectly capable of doing it myself, it's easy, it doesn't take much effort or time. But there's a device that means *I don't need to*, and it turns out that's extremely useful.

I wouldn't go for a $20 one, though. My first rice cooker was a ""cheap one"" to see if I liked it (£35), and it turned out that I liked it a lot... but that it was crap / needed to be adjusted constantly to get it to work / eventually stopped working entirely. Very happy with my ~£140 one, though."
