BipolarReddit,ff362iv,t3_er91wl,1579534551.0,Oh my God! This is the absolute worst. I’ve done this maybe three times in the span of taking lamotrigine (400mg daily) for about 10 years. I’ve had to have my parents come pick me up because all of a sudden I got smacked with double vision. Not. Fun.

childfree,fekvtsg,t1_fekruwg,1579208646.0,"I don’t like admitting it but, intellectually, I know you’re 100% correct. I get annoyed because I so often feel as though procreating is the only narrative we’re ever exposed to in media. I know that affected me; for so long I didn’t even question the fact that I would eventually have children whether I wanted to or not."

AskReddit,fcxh7b5,t3_ejdlbw,1578062844.0,"When my ex progressed from emotionally charged verbal abuse to laying a finger on me. Unfortunately the seeds of loathing were planted far in advance of me actually walking out. 

Domestic abuse is no joke, if you or someone you know needs help, don’t be afraid to seek it, please. In the US, https://www.thehotline.org/resources/ is an invaluable start."
bipolar,fcx4wlm,t1_fcueics,1578051356.0,"Please don’t be nervous about getting back to art.

As far as my process... I kind of just let my hands dictate what I’m doing. That is not at all useful advice but I’ve found that “art play” has been the best approach for me. 

I started small on acrylic paper and sketchbooks instead of canvas since something about canvas was intimidating. I would play with different brushes and other tools (plastic forks and knives make really fun textures!); sometimes I’ll close my eyes and just sweep a brush wherever my hand goes then use that as the framework for what came next. 

I don’t know if this helps but give it a try! It doesn’t have to be a masterpiece to be cathartic and sometimes mistakes turn out to be my favorite pieces. <3"
bipolar,fcx4ker,t1_fcwklww,1578050938.0,"Isn’t it crazy how as kids we refuse to listen to our parents even when it’s positive ?! No lie, my parents message to both my sister and I was “pursue what you love” and yet, all I heard was external chatter “you have to make money, you have to be successful, you need to go to college, get married, buy a house, follow the life script!” I wouldn’t have become who I am if I took a different path so I do appreciate my journey and wouldn’t want to ‘redo’ any of it but man... my parents were right a lot more than I care to admit lol ;p

Please sing. Even if it’s just in the shower. Or maybe join a casual local chorus. You don’t have to be a Grammy winner to find your happiness in it again <3

And keep painting :)"
bipolar,fcveua8,t1_fcuvnf7,1578000619.0,You have no idea how much this comment means to me. I’ve always considered being in a gallery and selling my work to be a pipe dream but when strangers say stuff like this it makes me think maybe it’s not impossible... <3
bipolar,fcugurs,t1_fcu8whr,1577980641.0,"Yes and no is vague but accurate. I never studied fine art in school because my youthful insecurity of my ‘talent’ was exacerbated by “what do you want to be, a starving artist?” comments (ironically, my parents delivered the OPPOSITE message but in my infinite wisdom as a teenager, obviously I didn’t listen...;p)

I am trained in graphic design and minored in art history but in terms of painting, I am self taught. Many of my techniques have developed simply by observing art that inspires me (mostly the abstract expressionists of the mid 20th century) and attempting to recreate similar patterns and textures in a ‘guess and check’ method. 

Your comment really means a lot to me; it validates me in a way I still haven’t been able to find internally <3"
