I literally said I'm European you retard.

>If I provide a source in Swedish or Finnish you are just going to say that you can't understand it and go on to just deny the facts just the same. IT's also available in English though. You have no excuse. 

1. I can use Google Translate.

>I'm not ""making claims"", I'm discussing publicly available unemployment statistics. You are an American trying to deny those statistics. 

Yes you are. You claimed things, and then refused to provide proof for those claims. And I have already said I'm not American.

Why would I need to? I haven't made any claims.

>Why am I able to easily find the statistics but Americans aren't?

What is with your obsession with Americans?

>Why are the actual statistics deleted?

Oh, so now they are deleted? You're resorting to a conspiracy theory now?

>Proves a link? What is that even supposed to mean? 

Well you can provide a source that shows correlation but not causation. I would like a source that actually proves causation.

>This is sealioning. Are you American?

Asking for a source after someone makes multiple claims without a single shred of proof to back them up is not ""sealioning"" (I actually had to look up what that means). I'm not sure why asking for proof makes me American (I'm european btw)."
