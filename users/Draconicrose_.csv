Guildwars2,feg3kim,t1_fefu76a,1579075365.0,"This improved things for me. From 5-10 seconds before patch, to about 20 seconds. Not a complete fix, but definitely better than minute long loading screens, thank you."
Guildwars2,feejd48,t3_eok2wy,1579034932.0,"When Grothmar Valley came out I had some hope that they were still full steam on GW2 but after Bjora Marches I'm just not so sure. :/ Maybe it was just developed by the Kourna team, idk, but it definitely feels like the only thing that is still getting some imagination and development put into it is the gem store."
patientgamers,fe5ugwt,t3_enasbc,1578875214.0,"Yes, I've seen this phenomenon, even with something like shows and comics. It's weird to me. I couldn't care less about a thing's community. Of course, a good community is always a plus, but I won't stop enjoying something just because other people are crappy about it."
witcher,fe4t7es,t1_fe4kumq,1578862569.0,That makes me happy üòÄ
witcher,fe4829t,t3_enqe3f,1578856641.0,Honestly now I just want to see modern day Witchers. Think they'd look for contracts on Craig's List? Be reviewed on Yelp? 4/5 killed an ekkimara for me but fucked my wife.
Sims4,fe43rag,t3_enoo9y,1578855528.0,He looks good! Have you put him on the gallery?

portugal,fd2naze,t1_fd2d055,1578149664.0,"Acho que se queremos energia renov√°vel est√°vel, a solu√ß√£o passa por diversificar. 

Imagina, temos ventoinhas, pain√©is solares, talvez energia geot√©rmica (n√£o sei se √© poss√≠vel em Portugal), e energia mar√≠tima. Acho que seria suficiente, em escala, para manter os n√≠veis necess√°rios.

Se bem que estou s√≥ a dizer por alto, n√£o sei como √© que est√° a produ√ß√£o e armazenamento de energia."
portugal,fd2mhvb,t3_ejv8an,1578149329.0,Muito bom! Agora √© n√£o descan√ßar at√© serem os 100% sempre que poss√≠vel.
bujo,fcymsdw,t3_ejl49u,1578082942.0,"Hello!

I had been looking for something like this but I couldn't really find better layouts online, so I decided to just keep it super simple.

I don't usually have enough events/appointments going on to justify a full line or more per day of the month, so even though it does get a little cramped, it's functional and it gives me a quick overview of everything I have coming up that month. I also have no trackers and do not plan my tasks on the monthly level, so yes, keeping it simple!

I think it's pretty easy to understand and it does follow [Ryder's basic monthly](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/bulletjournalist/monthly-log), but I guess my notebook is just smaller than his? I definitely do not have enough lines for one line = one day."

steelseries,fcub5xm,t1_fcu7r6w,1577976878.0,"Yeah, it does have sound coming through. I got into a Windows PC and configured it to never turn off that way. If this works, maybe it is a faulty device, but I don't think it's enough to RMA it. I don't care about the surround sound gimmick."
steelseries,fcu7k4s,t3_e62blu,1577974428.0,The SSE on Linux. :(
steelseries,fcu771i,t3_ehlmnd,1577974197.0,"I've just gotten an Arctis 7 for xmas, too, and while it works out of the box, the auto-shut off seems to be pre-configured, which is annoying because it doesn't detect that I'm actually listening to a video/game/voice and will just shut off!

Currently trying to get the SSE working through wine, if not I will have to go find a windows PC just to configure this one setting, which I assume will be saved on the headphones."

letsplay,fc9r2nx,t3_egr4io,1577556925.0,"Honestly, at the rate youtube ads pay you're probably just celebrating the fact that your videos will eventually accumulate enough money for you to drink some coffee paid by ads. 

If you'd like to make money from your channel you're better off setting up a patreon or accepting donations through a service like [ko.fi](https://ko.fi) or paypal."
patientgamers,fc1z2nk,t1_fc1lqim,1577334262.0,"It's decent for groups but when fighting a big boss creature, especially if it flies, it's pretty handy to keep it on screen."
Guildwars2,fbvrphr,t1_fbvjwtp,1577135101.0,Anet does need some good will and bringing back S1 would give them that.
