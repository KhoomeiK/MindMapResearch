cats,ff93r7s,t3_es3edv,1579704126.0,Please please please make sure he has a break-away collar if you keep one on him. If anything snags his collar he will easily choke if it can’t break away.

I notice this spell doesn’t have a “cast at higher level” option. 

If you were to add it, I imagine it would start wider and deal a little more damage each spell level increased, but would love to hear how you would do it."

It sucked, but he’s doing much better now!

Your cat is gorgeous! They should be fixing their litter any time now, they look about big enough."
cats,fej03zt,t1_feihrl8,1579152200.0,"In my experience, they grow out of it naturally. Cats are relatively clean animals, and try to avoid becoming gross. 

Your best bet is to watch your kitten use the litter box, and take his paws and use his paws as scoops to cover his poops. Over time he’ll do it. If you have other cats, they may try to help teach good poop etiquette. 

If your cat has slightly more liquid poops, leading to running on the fur or the inability to get to the box, make sure you go to the vet. I had a foster kitten who had worms, and the first type of medicine used didn’t get rid of them. The second type did, and he had much more solid poops after, in the litter box exclusively. 

Good luck! 

Also, I demand the cat tax."
