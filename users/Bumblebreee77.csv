Paranormal,feiwa1i,t1_feipi55,1579148943.0,"I actually didn‚Äôt. I was so stunned. I never thought of it as a spiritual experience or lucky, I think because I was scared. She was scary to me as a person when she was alive. But now that you mention it, I can see your perspective and it gives me peace. 

I did have another exp with her that I immediately considered a spiritual exp tho. I was accepted to her alma mater after she passed and one morn I was sitting on campus with a lot of anxiety about school and all of a sudden a peace came over me that felt like a blanket or water was poured over me starting at the top of my head. I looked to my right and a hummingbird was hovering at eye level about 5‚Äô away. I knew it was her and I knew she was telling me it‚Äôs going to be ok, you‚Äôre going to be ok. The exp felt like it lasted a half hr. I‚Äôm sure it was only seconds. 

I didn‚Äôt mention it to anyone cuz I thought I was crazy. Years later I told my stepdad and he said he had a similar exp w a hummingbird.. stress, sadness and then peace. And he knew it was her."
