borderlands3,fecjxzx,t1_fec7i75,1578975735.0,"Yeah, BL2 did kind of shoehorn you into specific builds. Axton/Gaige suffered from the poor pet scaling Fl4k suffered from in 3, leaving them with limited builds. I never really saw anyone play Maya for her healing tree specifically, but she did have 2 main builds that really just changed based on which capstone you wanted more. Zero had a few builds depending on your playstyle, but melee was notoriously difficult without proper gear so most ran sniper/pistol builds. 

Honestly, the one with the most options was Sal. While everyone else was limited to one or two useful builds in endgame, Sal had like 8 builds. But even then people largely only played one build because it was the most efficient, making you damn near unkillable and still put out a fuckton of DPS."
borderlands3,feciqhl,t1_fec6ssq,1578974899.0,"I always played Maya, so slag was never an issue for me thankfully. Axton had turrets, and Salvador...was Salvador. That was probably the best part of the tiny Tina DLC though. Everybody was rocking magic missiles."
borderlands3,feciifl,t1_fecdqvz,1578974742.0,"Gearbox implemented a mechanic to prevent players from being one shot. If I remember correctly if you were to die from full health in one hit it couldn't reduce you below like 20% or something. So for a while the popular way to play BL2 was to reduce your health as much as possible and have a healing weapon equipped.

So instead of having 10k health for example, players would use -health mechanics to reduce their HP to hundreds. Healing weapons would regen you to full instantly, so as long as you didn't take more than one hit in that split second you were essentially invincible. AKA healthgating. 

If they're referring to something else then I dont know what they are talking about. This is the only known instance of healthgating I am aware of for BL2."
JustBootThings,fe6j22m,t1_fe59p4z,1578892487.0,"That's how I felt. I cared in the beginning, but dealing with S1 was such a pain in the dick I would have rather contracted aids than deal with them. I cant even recount how many times they lost paperwork.

borderlands3,fe60a71,t1_fe0c6qe,1578878909.0,"For real. I just came back to BL3 hoping they had fixed matchmaking. It's been hours and the closest I got to actually finding someone was the game just randomly saying 4/4 players and launching me into an empty lobby. 

At least they had the foresight to add the lost loot box, otherwise I would have been doubly annoyed by that random launch. Matchmaking in this game is horrendous, and should definitely be a priority. People shouldn't be waiting around for hours in hopes of finding a group."

JusticeServed,fcl4c9j,t1_fcl1h89,1577739525.0,"The relevant information you're seeking:

""The system (bots) will not automatically ban you if you participate, it must be triggered by reports or your own doing.""

Basically, if you break the sub rules here *then* the bots will check the subreddits you participate in. If you are reported often enough/use racial slurs the bots will ban you for both breaking sub rules and run on the assumption that you are brigading the post since users from the linked subs brigade here often enough that it's become a noticeable problem.

So it's not proactive, you still have to do something worthy of being reported/looked at for getting banned in the first place."

Edit: to the person who immediately deleted their comment: if your argument is upvote and move on, the counterargument is downvote and move on. That's all I'm saying."

todayilearned,fcg8a3d,t1_fce1hze,1577637513.0,"I dont know whether he did anything inappropriate or not outside of this instance, but as the girl has name dropped people who *actually* did pedo stuff, and the only thing she can say about Groening is ""Epstein made me give him a foot massage this one time on a plane"" I find it a stretch to connect those dots.

This was a reporter most likely trying to drum up some controversy for clicks than it was about Groening being inappropriate, especially after Groening himself said he felt weird about it at the time (assuming what he said was the truth). And of all the things she has accused people of, this one not only doesn't fall into pedo territory, but she would have been more forthcoming with any additional information if it were available seeing as she hasnt been shy about calling people out. 

There is the possibility that he's done something outside of this one plane trip, but trying to accuse Groening of it because that one time a guy made his worker give him a foot massage isn't the way to connect those dots."
