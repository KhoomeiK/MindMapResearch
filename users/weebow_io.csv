mentalhealth,ff842kv,t1_fej4ww9,1579665438.0,How come you don't care about yourself?
depression,ff841cx,t1_ff43z80,1579665414.0,"Ok, good answer. You've acknowledged you would like more social interactions and local friends. Are you taking steps to address that? If so, what?  Next, how long are you stuck in this position for financial reasons for? Is there an exit plan? how are you being stuck there also building towards what you actually want to be doing?"
depression,ff83xj9,t1_ff44j2y,1579665335.0,How come? What do you want to be and why?
depression_help,ff83wal,t1_ff4zass,1579665309.0,"Sounds like you are resenting some folks that are close to you. There may be a valid reason for that. Any thoughts on what that might be? Next, let's address the fact that your not dumber than everyone in the room, that's self-pittying. Chances are you've learned that somewhere from someone who bullied/traumatized/convinced you it's true. Because it's definitely not, you have to re-write that internal narrative and not let the self destructive thoughts win out.  Start small 'I am not the dumbest person in the room' - repeat it 100 times a day, then 1000 and tell me what happens.  When you can let go of that thought and build yourself up and deploy your skills and gifts, you will see and feel why your existence isn't needed...but right now, you are not letting yourself see that. Give yourself a chance to see it, feel it, live it."
MentalHealthSupport,ff83gwe,t1_ff71rt5,1579664982.0,"Holy crap you chatted about the video in the podcast! Love it! You totally nailed it. I have a podcast too, [www.rumpusroompodcast.com](https://www.rumpusroompodcast.com). If you ever have guests let me know! Would love to chat. 

I agree about your thoughts on social media and the staged components, I like how you turned the corner on thinking about social media more from a good light, from a self-reflective perspective. Also liked the idea about giving what you want. Also, thanks for sharing your personal story with depression and your perspective. Everyone's perspectives helps add context to the mental health crisis experience worldwide - self-disclosure is key.  Keep it up!"
MentalHealthSupport,ff82m6w,t1_ff7e3z9,1579664351.0,and it will get better! So keep doing what you are doing.
mentalhealth,ff4z7bt,t3_erlanu,1579576001.0,"do you have anyone else in your life that can be that buffer for you? that support system that could be used instead of the ER? Also, have you scheduled an appointment to see your dr if you think a med change could help?"
depression_help,ff4z3rp,t3_ernxm4,1579575931.0,what are the thoughts that come inside your head that make you want to leave at that hour mark?
mentalhealth,ff4z0gc,t3_ermcjh,1579575865.0,"Hi Mari, looking forward to tuning into your journey! 

keep sharing your story!"
relationships,ff4yxtz,t1_ff430lc,1579575814.0,completely agree..was gonna say the same thing!
Anxiety,ff4yr20,t3_ermpo1,1579575683.0,"congrats! Build off of the small successes, bit a bit more off next time and keep growing! I'm proud of you too."

MentalHealthSupport,ff4ybvs,t3_ermp9c,1579575390.0,"there is a guy you may want to research, his name is mastin kipp, check out some of his videos. I'm not a doc so won't try and diagnose, but I have a question, do you like who you are and the life you live?"
MentalHealthSupport,ff434rv,t3_erj0im,1579554508.0,"your not too fucked up to be a human being. everyone is fucked up. in fact, the ones that appear the least fucked up are often the most and the ones that appear the most fucked up are often the least."
depression,ff430md,t3_ererwo,1579554437.0,"Saw a great quote yesterday that was something to the tune of ""Life isn't tiring, it's tiring trying to be someone you are not."" Would you say that applies to you?"
Anxiety,ff42weo,t3_erdbtw,1579554365.0,"Throw yourself out there!! Look into [meetup.com](https://meetup.com), find things you are interested in. No amount of preparation or anything is going to make you suddenly feel like you are ready, you won't ever truly feel 'ready', you just have to commit to action. Start with 1 thing...go to one social thing, perhaps centered around a shared interest like theater, pottery, painting, sports, music, whatever. Just go!"
mentalhealth,fets4ha,t1_feitgd2,1579379364.0,Are you translating your desire to get help into measurable changes in your behavior? How do you define 'help' when you say 'trying to get help?'
mentalhealth,fetrz9m,t1_fej4ww9,1579379284.0,that makes sense. What would it take for you to care about yourself? Like what are redeemable qualities that make a person careable/lovable/worthy/etc.?
mentalhealth,fesbfrk,t3_eq7t8i,1579363497.0,Great effort!
depression_help,fekvvgy,t3_epnqby,1579208674.0,"you are not alone, breathe deep, it will pass. Whats going on?"
mentalhealth,feirobb,t1_feipye9,1579145492.0,"Could it be because you don't value yourself enough to want to make the right decision? It reinforces your mindset of 'im a piece of shit/broken/mentally ill' or whatever to make those bad decisions...so it's easier and you are 'right'/reinforcing that mentality in your head when you do it. It prevents you from being 'wrong' about who you are by making good decisions that will build you up...because making those good decisions will 'destroy' a current status quo mentality that you are holding on to for some reason. Perhaps because it's offered you solace in the past. Real question is, do you want to keep doing that and playing into that narrative?"
depression,feioj7v,t1_feihcmg,1579143347.0,you will be. but right now focus on yourself as being the most important person in your life. sooner or later someone will recognize your beauty and scoop you up for good!
depression_help,feioblx,t3_epcgsb,1579143205.0,"Peer pressure sucks. They are pressuring you to have sex because it affirms their decision, not because you actually are making a bad one. They are doing it out of insecurity to make you feel insecure so you reinforce their decisions. Fuck that! (but really, it's super natural and you probably won't escape that human trait the rest of your life)  But don't let it get you down! Do whats right for you, you don't owe anyone an explanation or anything and you are not doing something that's wrong or 'worse'."
mentalhealth,feio1cc,t3_ep9qqe,1579143019.0,How come you care about whether or not others care about you?   Do you care about yourself?
depression,feiny1a,t3_ep4bw6,1579142958.0,"Could you be meaning making? Maybe it offered you a way out when you thought your life would end in suicide, so you worked hard because you say the end was somewhere. Now, is it possible you've realized that you won't actually do it and are spiraling? If that's so though, really, all along it's been the exact same, your decision to 'end it' was just offering you a false sense of finality in the end anyway. It was actually shielding you from a bigger realization about the uncertainty of life and the infinite possibilities. It could have been a coping mechanism you've grown out of.  It served you in the past. Sounds like it doesn't serve you anymore, so grow and find something else that gives you that security, or, stop looking for that false sense of security anyway and let go of the need for the beachhead and live free of the self-created shackle, or shackle yourself to a good reason to live - your call!"
mentalhealth,feinf5i,t3_epas6g,1579142612.0,"Hum, I understand your frustration. There is a difference between knowing and feeling, I could know that I'm a good person, but maybe I don't feel it. Is there a disconnect between what you 'know' or can articulate and actually what you feel?"
depression,feibqdv,t3_ep842q,1579134781.0,are you male or female if you don't mind me asking?
depression,feibnzh,t3_eoxun3,1579134737.0,"understandable. depression is safe, it's like a blanket that keeps us warm but at the same time weighs us down from experiencing the joy of being. but to feel that joy often one has to let go of that blanket and be vulnerable. not everyone is always up for that and it's ok. it's also ok to let it go. it's your path. you know what's best for you."
MentalHealthSupport,feibjk2,t3_eozn14,1579134654.0,"been suicidal myself, 29 yr old male in a similar situation but no kids. For me it's hobbies and good relationships that make it worth it. I'm a bit of an adrenaline junky, downhill skiing is my drug, sort of makes life worth living for me I have so much fun doing it. Do you have a hobby or friendships that you can simply let go and feel in the flow of life while with or doing? Those are the moments for me, freedom...when i can let go of the steering wheel a bit and still have my foot on the gas."
depression,fefpsaj,t1_fefpqlv,1579061777.0,"at least, that's what my dad did and eventually he told me why he was doing it and said that."
depression,fefpqlv,t3_eorigf,1579061743.0,"He's probably saying that out of fear that he didn't do enough for you. When he blames you, he protects himself. What he's saying is not actually about you, it's about him and self-preservation. Recognize that as the limitation of his insight and leave it. It's not truth."
mentalhealth,fefkbwz,t3_eoqzo7,1579058148.0,"keep talking, keep walking, keep breathing, keep seeing. you don't know how your grace on this earth is felt by others. not everything is tangible. don't give up because there could be a great tidal wave of light brewing in your life. perhaps you've found the depths and you are ready to come up, it will only make the difference between what once was and what is so much different."

You can be a responsible and reliable high functioning person. Your bad habits are standing in the way, that's ok, everyone has them. It's time to sharpen the tools and make baby steps the right way. You are worth it and capable of it. Don't let yourself or anyone else tell you otherwise."
MentalHealthSupport,fefiugw,t3_eoumzt,1579057235.0,"you know it's time to let go of the relationship if you get the feeling that it \*might\* be time. If it wasn't time to end the friendship, you wouldn't have any thoughts suggesting you should, so you are picking up on something that makes you think it's time. So, it's time. It's time to take the next step. cut social media ties, stop texting, have a conversation if necessary, create space within yourself for something new. You won't be open to the possibility of something new until you create that space."
mentalhealth,feee9n9,t3_eoq82p,1579031963.0,could be that it's a learned defense mechanism to prevent yourself from getting hurt again. Maybe it's time to start peeling back why you've felt it necessary to shield yourself. Could help you understand what you are afraid of and/or what you are really longing for.
mentalhealth,fdnp1in,t3_em8uvx,1578590219.0,"Hey, I'm in the same boat! Tiger parent/grandparent situation and I'm grateful for it as well. For me, starting small was key. I had to repeat in my head ""I am not a piece of shit"" every day, every time I walked outside, eventually, it became ""I'm ok"" and finally ""I'm pretty good"" - I still struggle, but positive self talk taught me the brain and our inner dialogue is plastic and trainable. You can retrain your brain to be supportive of yourself. Here's more of my mental health journey!  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwBHVzAvJqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwBHVzAvJqY)"

mentalhealth,fcuz1dd,t3_ej24qd,1577991351.0,"They sound like you are a human. Those are very human traits that ever person alive experiences. You know exactly what's going on in your life, you are keen, aware, and capable of taking them on one by one. Keep it simple, there is no quick fix to mental health. Even getting a diagnosis doesn't guarantee anything will substantively change in your life, with or without meds - they help some people and not others. The only thing that's constant in life is you and your commitment to yourself & life. Nothing outside of you will change that. Getting a job, relationships, money, social status, whatever else can contribute to your willingness to give yourself credit for living a life worth living, but even still it's not guaranteed, you are in the driver seat for your quality of life and the sooner you take responsibility and make action the faster you'll accomplish all of those things that you've said you want to! And you can do it! Getting the right support system around you is important so keep reaching out!"
