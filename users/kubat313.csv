aww,fez48ao,t1_fez2umo,1579453677.0,I think you dont understand me. I know the cat went to him to get him to go to the bed. I meant that he went to the bed to snuggle with him in the first place. But i guess reading is hard.
aww,feyppbn,t1_feypjzp,1579448873.0,Nope. He implied he went to him so that the dog comes to the bed. Im saying he went to the bed because he knows the dog sleeps there.

And fnatic, even tho i hated fnatic (was a fan of tsm back in 2015) but to see them win the majors in 2015 and taz standing up after a loss while people booed olofmeister for winning stuck to me. Everybody hated fnatic, but no one could stop those motherfuckers."
GlobalOffensive,fcq6rxy,t1_fcq6gx5,1577879958.0,I mean i watched since 2014. So i didnt see them really. But i saw that they didnt win the first 2 majors. and fluked the third (with valve forcing people to play cobble as the third map was random). So i might be biased
GlobalOffensive,fcq5ttz,t1_fcq59v7,1577879371.0,Yes. But its not as impressive as 2018 astralis dumping every team winning 8/11 tournaments with a 32 nuke streak and a (i believe) 17 game inferno streak.
