bipolar,fdyjaif,t1_fdy37m3,1578780396.0,"I wouldn't know about that. I had a bad time on an SSRI. I do attribute that to it being unsuitable for my condition. Were you on an SSRI when you were diagnosed? Whatever your diagnosis please don't feel some kind a fraud. You were diagnosed by a professional. Professional diagnoses can change and that's the world of medicine for you. Don't worry about bipolar disorder being some exclusive club where you have to experience the exact same patterns as someone else. Brains are in themselves, different."
bipolar,fdxzhsl,t3_ence65,1578774503.0,"I think so many of us could have written the same thing. I can have mixed episodes were hypomania isn't easily discernible. When first diagnosed I didn't believe my diagnosis and just thought my hypomania was ""weirdness"" and ""eccentricity"". This is why an outsider's point of view can be very important."
bipolar,fdxy208,t3_encbw8,1578774082.0,"I actually was speaking to a colleague about my diagnosis and he said it was speculated he had the same, but he doesn't believe in it. We're not talking about the tooth fairy here."
Herpes,fdxvif5,t1_fdxfeur,1578773364.0,"Not wanting to contract herpes does not make them a shitty person. Blocking and ghosting instead of a polite bow out unless you are being harassed, is a shitty behaviour. So not blame for the former, but the latter."
Herpes,fdxu4ok,t3_en6t7l,1578772966.0,"I'm sorry you're dealing with this type of rejection. Ghosting really is awful and I have actually taken to calling people out on it before ceasing contact.   


As for that appetite thing, yes that's depression for ya. Right now I'm going through a sad situation and am struggling to get food in my mouth. If you're not in counselling already I'd recommend it. Not just for dealing with herpes mentally but as a sounding board. I've been in and out of counselling for different things and honestly probably will be for quite a while if not the rest of my life. Why? Because I actually consider it beneficial to anyone's mental health, and like herpes, it doesn't devalue you or makes you worthy of shame."
AskWomen,fdek6qo,t3_ekhphw,1578340764.0,"When I was bitterly alone, one female friend reached out and encouraged me to join a group of women. I had already started to understand my internalised misogyny, but it was that shared experience that really changed the way I relate to other women. I am now one of the moderators of that group."
Herpes,fdedre7,t3_ekqny9,1578336810.0,"Whilst you can put forward some resources, encourage people to have a look, and try to answer any questions they may have, you are not obliged to exhaust all of your mental energy explaining every minute detail to someone. I don't know about you, but I'm not a flipping virologist. I also have bipolar disorder and I'll explain my experiences but I'm not going to run through psych 101 for someone who gets involved with me. Dealing with the virus can be stressful enough without having to provide an academic lecture.  


He has definitely reacted this way out of shock, and it's understandable he is angry and sad (if he even has it), however that doesn't make taking it out on you okay. Congrats on standing up for yourself btw. I hope he hasn't caught it, but if he has I hope he can come to the realisation that he is the responsible, consenting party here. Please don't beat yourself up. What you did was fine."
Herpes,fde9ucp,t3_ekxh5u,1578334352.0,"Also contracted GHSV2 from an asymptomatic partner. As far as statistics go, there's a lot of confusing and differing information out there. He may or may not have been shedding the virus, which is partially dependent on how long he has had it for. I honestly would not worry too much unless you start showing symptoms. That is what a doctor will probably tell you as it is advised by the CDC and various health bodies. Whether that is acceptable is up to you to decide. If you feel you must for peace of mind, have a blood test for antibodies a month from now and another in about three months."
