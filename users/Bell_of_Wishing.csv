wholesomememes,ff2sbuc,t1_ff2rbe0,1579522010.0,"That doesn't sound pretty at all. Have you considered getting a pet to keep you company? Dogs will always love you, even if you accidentally step on their tail. Some cats are also very affectionate. This could teach you to provide and accept affection while also giving you a connection!

Reminds me of that time I spent in England. My ~~mom~~ mum, my brother and me would travel from one inn to the next and one owner had a very cute cat. I would lie on the bed, absentmindedly petting her. When I stopped because I thought it was enough, she practically launched at me and *bit my nipple.* It didn't hurt but it surprised me. And it overwhelmed me with the realisation that animals like cats have their ways to communicate with humans ...

There was something very pure about it. A solid communication between that cat and me, entirely without words. She knew what she wanted and how to tell me and I knew what she tried to say. If you choose to follow my advice to get a dog or cat, know that these animals aren't just mindless four-legged organisms with barely enough mind to eat and sleep. They have personalities, quirks, feelings ... and their love towards you is just as good and valid as any that a human could give you, ya got that?"

But you seem to have a clean skin (+2), take good care of your hair (+1), have a healthy-looking body shape (+3), your canthal tilt is slightly positive (+1), your nose is of normal size and shape (+1) and your style is pretty cutesy and unique in my eyes (+2). I like sweaters like the one your wear in bottom-right, for example. It makes you look cuddly. I dislike your skirt, to be honest, because I dislike checked patterns (-1). Plus, the lipstick in bottom-right is too bright. Your natural lip colour is much softer and fits you better. I like your nails, though.

I do agree that you look average. But that doesn't mean you look mediocre. I think you're quite pretty!"

At least with all the replies on this post you know that you're not ugly. That's one weight off your shoulders. I would really like to take care of your loneliness somehow, perhaps by giving some ground-breaking advice on how to socialize ... but I don't know how. I am not too different from you when it comes to friendships.

If anything in my original reply came off as weirdly strict or cold, I would like to apologize. I didn't mean it like that."

ugly,fdnwtz2,t3_eldn14,1578594457.0,"I love your wild hair, your brown eyes and your ear ring. Your face has nice proportions, your shoulders are wide and your lips are full enough to make you look like a kisser. Sure, your eyebrows are a mess but they lack the power to disturb the whole. I also recommend that you go for the beardless look - after that you should imitate this exact image for your Tinder pic, but with the slight hint of a Mona Lisa smile.

Honestly, you remind me of a surfer boy who orders some fancy drink at the beach bar, taking it easy with his life and following his dreams. You turn to the side, only to find two girls giggling with excitement. You look at them and your eyes from the picture seem to say ""'Sup, girls."" You leave a clever remark, perhaps coupled with a compliment, and the girls swoon silently over you ...

... and then I awake from my bizarre daydream about another man and remember that you actually consider yourself an incel. And I become sad about what insecurities can do to with a perfectly good looking guy ..."
shortcels,fdmjbab,t1_fdlrkss,1578551979.0,"I'm also on the spectrum. But that doesn't mean that my personality is set in stone or that any shitty behaviour can be excused just by shrugging my shoulders and saying ""I guess I can't do anything about it anyway so I might as well carry on"".

There is a flood of things that aspies cannot deal with - holding a presentation, making friends, being popular, being a charismatic leader, fitting in, etc. - but the ability to *not say stuff* shouldn't be one of them.

Like ... come on, man. You don't have to be mean. Being nice? That's an entirely different story to worry about later. But being the asshole is cringe and you don't deserve to feel like that."

But I do get how you must feel. It's super scary even thinking about doing that. How about you write your ""sweet"" friend who you mentioned? You only communicate by text but that's at least something, right? Just tell her how you feel, just like you told us strangers. That'd be a baby step you can take easily and without much risk. And then wait and see what happens."
KindVoice,fcv4qmx,t3_eiurja,1577994614.0,"The exact moment where you sabotage yourself is here:

No, they won't. Your problem is loneliness and that's what everyone has to fight with, not just young teens. Literally just tell one of your friends that you feel lonely. You don't have to make it melodramatic if you don't wanna come off this way. But you *know* that this is the solution you're looking for. It's the only way."
