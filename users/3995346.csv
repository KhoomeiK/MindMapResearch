GetMotivated,fej166y,t1_fecxhuz,1579153191.0,"This is a very good question. I think it's a bit of both right. In your mind, you know it's bad, but you keep thinking, tomorrow is the day. Every tomorrow becomes another tomorrow and so on. Each failure, each set back, each pound going up is further confirmation that you should give up. At the same time its subtle like getting taller as a kid. It happens, but day to day is largely( pun not intended), the same. It's a sad, horrible, rut. I imagine it's similar to a drug addict who is always so sure that they are about to be clean tomorrow. The sadness of being a junkie and knowing you  are powerless to stop up is only relieved by that next fix, hit of smack, or in my case, large pizza, fried appetizer, zebra cakes, and sugary drinks."

It allows me to stay in ketosis and it's around 750 calories under what I would need to maintain my weight. I litterally ate this entire thing today. I'm actually stacking muscle while losing fat by eating those macro nutrients and calories daily. If anyone googles tdee ( total daily energy expenditure) calculator, then eats less calories, they will lose weight. Eating high protein helps gain muscle. Being in a state of nutritional ketosis by limiting carbs to 20 or less, further aids in fat loss by my using my stored fat for energy in lieu of dietary carbohydrates.

TLDR: the cauliflower crust makes it low carb and since it's less calories then I need to maintain my weight, I lose weight."

R/keto
R/Omad
And used x3bar daily

In addition to those things, I eat a large amount of protein daily, 180 to 220 grams.

I have some mental wellness and mindful strategies in place as well to help me stay strong mentally.

That's it

I have countless easy recipes and menu hacks and plan my days food intake before I leave the house for work. 

Disclaimer: there are many avenues to successful weight loss but they all start with a calorie deficit."

More than you all will ever know. 

Seeing all these people reacting to my progress and blowing up my inbox asking for advice is overwhelming yet so immensely exciting. Nothing compares to the feeling I get when I get messages from someone who lost 50 pounds emulating me and just buckled their seatbelts on a plane for the first time in years or when someone posts to tell me they arent having any more junk food today thanks to my post. It makes me feel as though all the time, all the anguish, and all the pain of my last 35 years lead to this. Thanks for letting me feel important, fellow redditors, you guys ROCK!"

It doesnt always hold up, but i try to plan for sushi and desserts once every couple months so I have a reward to look forward to and I try to really plot out everything I'm going to eat. I also plan 2 days because just 1 wont let me get to it all and will likely trigger a binge I waited a year before eating cake and pizza and the ensuing binge and sickness made me realize that there is no cure from who we are, but that doesnt me it is the only part of us that defines us.
