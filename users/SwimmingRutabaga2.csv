AskReddit,fel4nah,t3_epj100,1579213965.0,Defenetally Warframe. It's very underrated and while the community is bigger then it was in 2018 there are still not enough people playing as there should be. It's so vast with so many different things you can do and so much content and fun to be had. With massive updates out all the time and it's free to play. I don't understand why more people don't play it and it's also on every console including the switch which is crazy.

AskMen,fe2xdwp,t1_fe2wzwa,1578843942.0,Yeah ok your right defenetally. So I should wait a little while before I do anything. I was planning on talking ab sexual boundaries and such when we meet. In my opinion doing things like enjoying eachothers bodies like grabbing and kissing and just feeling would be a good romantic thing that would draw us closer together especially with the distance. Do you think that's a good idea at this point or maybe not.
AskMen,fe2v7c4,t1_fe2ttfr,1578843231.0,I mean we have been close friends for the better part or two years and have been dating for three months now I think. It's just we havnt gone on many dates because we can't even see eachother and when we meet this time it will be like three am.

relationship_advice,fdqb5nj,t3_emqnat,1578661782.0,This is a hard one man truly. But the best solution to the problem is to talk AB this with her. One of the ultimate and key things to making a good relationship work is communication. Without it the relationships sunk. So as soon as you can talk with her tell your insecurities ok. Ik that you love her bro and ik what that feeling is and when you love a girl like that it's just the absolute greatest. And if you two truly love one another and truly want this then you guys can work on this problem together and move on from it and heal ok. Just talk to her see what you can do to fix this see what you can do to move past this and heal ok. Wish you luck man and all the best brother. I hope you his works out for you.
relationship_advice,fdqaqae,t3_emq7y5,1578661391.0,"So wow this is a very particular and hard situation especially with the former was sexual abuse I think. And before I start I want to say I am so so so deeply and honestly sorry. That that happened to you. Im so sorry that you ever had to experience so.ething like that and my full thoughts and prayers go out to you for that.
So listen at first I though he could have been a player or a f*ck boy. But when you said he was very respectful of your distance. And he was gentle when you kissed and you didn't say anything AB him touching you when you didn't want or pushing for sex. Which is good this means that this guy has a great change or being genuine. So your falling for him and well h sends you cute txts everyday. I mean he could be falling for you. Not many people who don't get attached constantly send cute and flirty txts to the person they went on two dates with. 
Now I'm gonna say please don't get your hopes up I don't want that to happen and then you be let down because I would be the reason for that and I would feel really really bad. But your best bet is to explain yourself first. And then tell him. And who k kws y'all could get something working. That would be your best move for right now. And then see what happens and go from.
I hope that this possible helped and I hope that you guys will get together. He seems like a genuine guy. Which is what you need. It's what any girl needs."
relationship_advice,fdq9de2,t3_emqain,1578660097.0,"Yeah you can be friends with your ex defenetally I am. And I have a gf. The thing is though my gf is friends with me ex. It's alright do be friends but the fact that he's not letting you meet her is pretty weird. I would sit him down and talk to him
 Tell him this hurts you and makes you nervous. And you don't like it and go from there."
relationship_advice,fdp23qo,t1_fdoyy81,1578618172.0,"yeah of course anytime. i mean i guess if thats what he said recently well the decision is up to you. anytime you do need anything just message me and i will do my best to help you with whatever it is, and again im glad i could help:)))"
relationship_advice,fdon0lq,t3_emgx4p,1578608466.0,So this sounds like a mentally abusive relationship. Though maybe not quite as extreme as some. So with all of this with him putting you down treating you like trash standing you up etc. From what I can tell it may only get worse. Ik it's hard when you love them so much but staying in this relationship and just accepting the a use and pain and hurt over and over is only going to push you farther down a road of depression insecurities and love issues. Leaving him may be the best option in this scenario. However before you do anything I would strongly suggest sitting him down and spilling everything. Everything that ab what he's doing that hurts you so much and pains you deeply. If he continues if he doesn't care  if he doesn't listen the best option is to leave him you don't need all that. He may apolagize and try to get better. In this case we can hope for the best. But watch out like you said he's done that before say he will change but in reality he doesn't so if he does apolagize and say he will change you need to give him a warning. If he goes back to his old self it's over. I hope this helps and I hope you and him can work things out. Worst case scenario you guys brake up I'm so very sorry heart take sucks. But also you deserve better and I hope if that happens that you find someone better:)))
relationship_advice,fdom4a1,t3_emgsog,1578607932.0,No how you feel is perfectly fine. I don't fully understand in depth how it works in the mind. However idk what happened in the past relationship but things ending badly or him doing anything to make you feel like your body isn't good enough is more then enough for your body to put up a barrier to protect itself. And I don't think it's a good idea to just say ok I'll push through then rip your clothes off and snap away. That even if your fine with it even if your boyfriend  isn't abusive and is caring and loving and isn't bad that will push you farther into your insecurities. So I wouldn't recommend going all in all at once. Maybe try different things have your boyfriend build up your body ask him to tell you how much he loves it everything great ab it do things to boost that self confidence. Then start small ya know maybe a little we'll actually I shouldn't telling you what to do. Do whatever your comfortable with at first and as he compliments your body and builds your self confidence I think you will find those insecurities start to fade. Also during sex if he doesn't already ask him whenever  during it to just whisper things to you or tell things to you AB how much he loves your body etc. That especially during sex with all those chemicles and hormones going can really boost stuff. I hope I helped some and I hope that it works out and you can get over those self confidence issues. They are tough and hard to get over but I think you can defenetally do it
relationship_advice,fdn6e3v,t3_em08o5,1578578541.0,"So I'm going through a situation man not similer of course I nothing can be as tough as whats happening to you rn man. But my Gf and just started dating three months ago and we had been friends for two years before that. So we started dating immedietally pretty much our parents found out and we have been ripped apart. No contact all that probs for like two three years. Don't get me wrong I love this girl as if she was my wife her and I have talked many times about marriage. We love eachother so much.
I'm guessing you and your wife love eachother the same amount too. I want you to think about the promises you made when you said I do. I want you to remember your vows. Now ik it's hard to remember them and stick to them. And I myself have had times I have them all the time where I think it would be so much easier to run away to just leave all of it. But I made promises to my girlfriend I have a promise ring I have a book of vows I made to her. I have to remember she is my girlfriend your is your wife man. You have to remind yourself ok I love her with all of my heart. She is my baby girl. Why did I make these promises? Because I love her. Man you may not feel like the best ok for having these thoughts. Or you may not feel the best because all this is the worst fear of your wife dying eland everything.  But dude you are going through a situation pretty much no man has gone through or will ever go through. Nothing could ever prepare you for this nothing.
Which means you will struggle you can struggle . Being strong in a situation like this all the time 24/7 is almost impossible. Man don't beat yourself up. It's hard yes but get back up when you fall and regain a little strength and remember why you married your beautiful bride. And be there for her please man I'm begging you don't leave that's not love that's not the vows you made that right there is not strong that is cowardly. And if you do in the future your child will blame you. And if you leave even if your wife were to survive that would kill her you leaving she wouldn't be able to handle that. So man be strong be the lover, protector, and provider your wife needs. Remember the promises you made.
What helps me sometimes listening to songs about love and thinking of my princess or looking at pictures of her or just something like that. It will help man.
I'm so sorry your in this situation man but I am too bro. You aren't alone. We will fight and we will win for our girls ok. You and I will pull through for them because they need that. Please don't leave her maan please stay to fight for her please stay to fight with me man."
relationship_advice,fdlh2aw,t1_fdlgn3p,1578523861.0,Of course absolutly. And I do hope things work out between you and him and you guys can work past this and stay together and stay strong. Remember communication is key.
relationship_advice,fdldqog,t1_fdl89et,1578521840.0,Yeah and you should want someone you can talk to and go on walks with and someone that loves you no matter what and someone that helps you when your down or depressed and just a good boyfriend don't feel wrong for wanting that and yeah like that's not ok that he got mad bc you rejected him that makes me angry that's just not ok he shouldn't be doing that. But like I would talk to him as long as he's calm and tell him you want a real adult convo no yelling and you just want to talk to him ab some things and tell him how you feel and why your upset don't get me wrong you have ever right to be. Just the first thing that needs to happen is you need to talk and discuss things then you guys may be able to work things out alright
relationship_advice,fdl7hsr,t3_elz10b,1578518356.0,So this is tough. However even though you love him you need to leave if he's only using you for pleasure then down the line he will get bored with you and leave you like that and it will hurt you even more. Also he's using you just for pleasure that not ok. It's the beginning of a toxic relationship that will go very bad for you. Please if he is using you get out find a man who appreciates your heart and who you are as a person and loves you for that not just your body and what you have and can give him.

relationship_advice,fdkyr5z,t1_fdkyec0,1578513926.0,Yeah that makes sense I see why you avoided that. And yeah it probs would have been better to tell him but I would recommend telling him as soon as possible. It will be so much. Better for everyone.
relationship_advice,fdkxoyd,t3_elxqh5,1578513301.0,So first I'm gonna say even as a guy he overstepped the line like way way way to much and you have every right to be angry at him. Love is aquired over a while of being in a relationship and you defenetally shouldn't jump the gun a tell a girl you love her just like that. I will say though like I'm not saying everything is your fault or anything I'm just saying if you didn't directly communicate that you are not Interested. It's hard to explain yes most dudes respect space and you gave signs that you don't like him but some dudes like him like clingy and don't respect feelings etc don't pick up on that especially with a crush. Again I'm not blaming anything on you I'm just saying it probs would have been a good idea to verbally communicate that you were not interested. I'm sorry if that came off as rude I don't mean it that way I apolagize if it did. But so you need to sit him down somewhere where you guys are alone and it's privet. Tell him your very sorry but you aren't romantically interested in him and you don't want a relationship. Something simple like that he will be hurt of course but he needs this. I wish you all the best and I'm sorry again if it sounded rude again I do not intend it that way.
relationship_advice,fdkwu19,t1_fdkw6ne,1578512797.0,Yeah man of course I really really hope this goes well for you and you will get together with this girl. Wish you all the best man.
relationship_advice,fdkup20,t3_elxdx4,1578511531.0,So it sounds like she's a bit shy or nervous and it may seem like she's brushing you off Everytime you want to go on a date but it could be she is just busy go on and ask her out again if she does it again and If you want to approach her and just have an adult civil conversation and tell her that you feel she is avoiding dating you or you think she is giving mixed signals and go from there. J wish you all the best bud and I hope this works out for you.
relationship_advice,fdkp7ub,t1_fdkoh1p,1578508279.0,Your welcome and once again I'm so very sorry that this happened to you.
relationship_advice,fdkoc9m,t3_elwev7,1578507754.0,"Hey hey listen this situation is just horrible. I I'm so very sorry for you I can't even imagine what your going through. Have you tried to talk to him to see maybe what's wrong and go to your friends or someone your very close to in your family and cry to them hug them. Rn though what I would suggest taking a hot bath or shower then watching TV or something that you like and try to go to sleep. Break ups ink ow are the worst and hardest things to go through but they are bearable and you can get through this I know it I just have a feeling. With time the hurt will ease a little more the tears will be fewer the depression won't be as bad the lonliness won't hurt as much and maybe if you want to you can and will find someone again and love them again and hold them and cherish them and care for them again. Ik ik it hurts and I'm so sorry I wish there is more I can do for you. But it will get easier ok I promise you just talk to your friends cry to them scream if you have too and then do your best to move on. 
I'm sorry I wish there was just more I could do for you. I'm so sorry you have had to go through this. But ik you can make it through I just know it."
relationship_advice,fdkmtbr,t3_elwa9o,1578506825.0,Well yes because if you truly loved you girl right if you loved her unconditionally FAITHFULLY ya know no matter what through everything. Like if you love someone like that cheating never even crosses your mind because that word is just disgusting IDC what the dude says if he sleeps with someone else and he says he loves you he's lying and he only wants one thing and the best if both worlds.

relationship_advice,fdk8p6z,t3_elu43k,1578498611.0,"My friend just recently went through this almost exact situation just a few different circumstances. Ik especially with being in the same friend group and all that can make it hard to get over him but constantly thinking about him will make it worse. I suggest hobbies painting, music, gaming, paintball like something that keeps you focused and that keeps your brain distracted also don't stay in your house ya know go for a walk while you listen to music or a run get out go to the library or the park. And also none of these things will work 100% it also takes time and you have to do you very best to just not think of him to not even notice him. If your friends talk about him ask them nicely to not because it hurts or it annoys you whatever. But the biggest factor is time. It will take time it will get easier with time. Just do your best rn to distract your mind like I said get into some hobbies paintball I enjoy you can make lots of good friends male and female it's physically taxing it's fun and you never think AB anything else but the game.
I wish you all the luck and i promise things will get better and easier don't worry everything will be alright."
AskReddit,fdk7poy,t3_elu4hp,1578497981.0,A couple months ago I went through the hardest period in my life. And I went through a stage like ya know how sometimes you like a girl but it's not really liking them and it lasts for like a week or two or a month well I went through multiple of those fases in a short amount of time. And Everytime I would always get excited and talk to this one specific friend about it and be like super happy and like oh I'm gonna ask them out oh I think they like me etc.  Fast forward that friend that I talked to ab all that she became my girlfriend. But for the first month or so of our relationship she always felt like I fourth choice like I couldn't get a girl so j jest settled for her type feeling. It made me feel fricken awful and I was awful for doing that to her and I still feel horrible.
teenagers,fdk6ysx,t3_elu53h,1578497494.0,I've gone through the exact same thing man and it sucks rejection is the worst especially from someone you like. In situation however I think maybe the best thing to do would be to ask her if she wants to hang out or go somewhere with you and a group of friends and just hang out and get to know one another and once you talk and hang out for awhile and she gets more comfortable with you and around you then you can ask her out again.
relationship_advice,fdilkj3,t3_eli2do,1578445613.0,Wow handled well with both parties. All parents ik would blow up get enraged and do the worst things possible to teens going through a situation like that. I can't imagine what all that has happened couldn't have been easy especially with h all this but you handled it so very well.
relationship_advice,fdgoo95,t3_ekufeh,1578404179.0,"Ok listen it's love. He loves you more then anything. That's why he's doing this. He cares about more then anything in the world he loves you unconditionally he has a never ending roaring fire in his heart for you that will never ever go out. In this situation you don't need to repay him his gift is helping you and making sure your doing alright and making sure your comfortable and loving you unconditionally through it all.

Ik the feeling like you have to repay someone so just. Go up to him and put your arms around him. Hold him tight and tell him how much you love him. I have a girlfriend and when she does that man it melts my heart. It's the greatest gift she could ever give me. You don't need to get something expensive or do something like that. You just need to show him your affection and love.

Ypur man sounds like one of the few respectful loving caring men out there anymore. I'm so glad you have someone like him. And once again there is no need to buy him something or do something to that extent he may even feel bad if you spent what little money you have on him. Give him a hug or cuddle him or even write down in a notebook everything you love about him. It's the small things not the big or the expensive but the small things that show love, care, commitment, affection. He loves you and this is what he wants more then anything to help you and keep you comfortable and love you. Just remember that."

teenagers,fcq3m4x,t3_eif42h,1577877996.0,"Hey. So I have a friend who goes through the same things you do. Shes insecure because her family calls her fat and says she looks like a slut, whore etc. Now listen don't let ANYONE I tell you anyone put you down for not being good enough, hot enough, athletic enough, thin enough, whatever it may be man screw them you don't need those people.

Listen you are a wonderful girl I'm sure your talented, nice, respectufull, forgiving, caring, you seem like you have a true and honest heart.
That is your most amazing gift. Your heart. That's what makes you you that's what defines who you are. Don't let anyone take that away. IDC what anyone else says you are a very nice pretty, wonderful young lady with so much ahead of you.
As for social anxiety. I havnt dealt much with anxiety. But ji think social anxiety is when you just get really nervous around others and you don't wanna talk to people. Anyone correct me if I'm wrong.

What did to get out of my anti social bubble. Well first the root of the problem was my ""friends"" they made me feel wrong, stupid or not cool if I acted like myself if I did anything that they didn't like I changed so i could be like them. 
This gave me alot of problems like a little social anxiety depression I hated myself and didn't want to talk or open up to people. Cuz I was scared I would be judged or yelled at etc.

I don't remember exactly when or where.  But I relaxed at one point that this was destroying me. I need to be myself. I need to climb out of my shell and be myself around everyone. I did it at a summer camp. It turns out everyone loves the actual me more then the person I was putting on to be. Of course I lost those friends they hate my now. But I climbed out of my bubble 
I became my crazy social stuff I became the guy that went from having three ""friends"" that didn't care about, from someone  who didn't really talk much or socialize much. To someone who was the hype man at a summer camp of around 500 people I went from low and depressed to getting up in front of all those people and getting them hyped up with before the music and everything.
It turns out people like me alot better when I am myself.

Listen I don't know if that directly helped your situation. But it's just a piece of advice to hang on to. Always remember your beautiful, your one of a kind, and no one will or could ever take that away. Stay strong don't let others bring you down. If there are people doing that no matter who get them out of your life. Surround yourself with friends or people who truly love you for who you are and not who they want you to be.
I can tell your truly an amazing, honest, wonderful  girl with so much ahead."
depression,fckgd8c,t1_fcke5cs,1577724722.0,yes it really helped thank you from the bottom of my heart my sister lives to see another day :)))
depression,fcjx97e,t1_fcipu5w,1577709050.0,I just wanted to say. I took your advice last night  I i got your comment I was at a movie I sent her a pretty long text telling that I loved her like she is my only living family. And I love her and I want her to be at things like my wedding to sing and I told her I need her my girlfriend needs her. And we both love her more then almost anything.  and in the end she got alot happier and we managed to beat her depression for awhile. She is better and she realizes that not only do I need her I need my little sister but so does a couple of our friends. So thank you so much for this advice it helped her so much. And it helped me come back as her big brother. The big brother she needs so thanks so much.

relationship_advice,fbyf3gi,t3_ef3avs,1577215308.0,Thats actually great. I'm glad things are working out between you two. And I think that it will be hard as is quitting any addiction but if he really loves you he will and also ya know obviously he doesn't have to stop all video games just set up some limits like he can only be on this long at this time. Things like that. Or maybe he will stop them all together. That's something I and some people would do but just hang in there if you ever have any problems again talk to him he may not realize it fully the extent of his addiction so always remember to talk and discuss things. That is the key to making every relationship work. Communication. I'm glad for you genuinely and I hope it gets even better for you two
AskReddit,fbxsi3a,t1_fbxrzs7,1577199308.0,Yeah I'm aware she's a shit parent this is not even have of the stuff she has done and continues to do. I managed to pretty much ignore everything else that she does but this has stuck with me for a long time. Even though I do have a girlfriend its just hard when I remember it. My brain has been turned upside down and fucked so many times. So like it's hard to let things go and stuff like that
AskReddit,fbxrjp1,t1_fbxak6u,1577198534.0,I mean yeah but idk alot of people found out and made me feel like shit for it and fucked me up for it. My mom a few months ago I'm 15 now btw brought it up again after I pretty much forgot ab it completely and she brought it up and again made me feel like a horrible disgusting person.
AskMen,fbxrdd5,t1_fbx6opj,1577198390.0,Haha yeah thank you I was already planning on that but yeah that does make sense it would get boring
