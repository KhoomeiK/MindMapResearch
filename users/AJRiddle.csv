>Biden’s role at Burisma Holdings Ltd has come under intense scrutiny following unsupported accusations by U.S. President Donald Trump that Joe Biden improperly tried to help his son’s business interests in Ukraine.


None of this means Joe Biden did anything wrong, but his son being hired at an exorbitant salary for something he had no qualifications for does raise a red flag to what was going on.


And Biden's voting record is certainly not a myth as much as he wants it to be.  He has consistantly been on the wrong side of issues his entire career from [segregation](https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-said-desegregation-would-create-a-racial-jungle-2019-7) to [social security](https://theintercept.com/2020/01/13/biden-cuts-social-security/) to [war](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/12/us/politics/joe-biden-iraq-war.html) to [gay rights](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/us/politics/lgbt-forum-2020.html)"

He also has a pretty bad voting recording as well.

Why not suspend them for cheating with the cheater manager?"
baseball,feavfuu,t1_feaebiy,1578952567.0,"Yeah, I'd say a 25 game suspension for any player caught doing it would have more than fair.  Enough to send a message but not make any team a joke for long.

First of all they aren't all on the Astros anymore, secondly the astros got 0 punishment other than $5 million.  Hmm I wonder how much money they made off of winning a World Series - and I wonder how much money all the players made off of having inflated stats."

nfl,fe94q30,t1_fe86525,1578934243.0,"I mean the Chiefs have the 2nd worst playoff win percentage ever behind the Bengals.

Could be worse."
nfl,fe948dx,t1_fe8u0ty,1578934062.0,"Yeah, but other players can fumble too, and INTs can 100% be the wide receivers fault also.

Turnover stats can always have weird things that should be looked at situationally.   And Deshaun only got 1 of those TDs from Tyreek Hill muffing a punt at the 5 yard line - without that he'd only have 2 TDs - stat lines don't tell the whole story."
nfl,fe93spt,t1_fe8t8nl,1578933860.0,"Yeah except Garrett had Tony Romo and Dak.

O'Brien has had 1 season of healthy Watson and a bunch of terrible backup QBs."
worldnews,fe8va44,t1_fe8ro1c,1578931380.0,"Are you saying Americans are justified in killing Iraqis, because they are in Iraq?

Your justification is those Iraqis received training from Iran.   Maybe step back and think why are Iraqis trying to kill American soldiers."
KansasCityChiefs,fe8qf06,t1_fe8o7ry,1578929264.0,Last year I went for $190 each in the upper level endzone.  The cheapest for nosebleed corners is $270 now.

worldnews,fe8mkp8,t1_fe7hj13,1578927971.0,The USA has totally never killed any Iranians or wrongfully invaded and occupied their neighboring country for 20 years...
worldnews,fe8kziu,t1_fe8i3ol,1578927346.0,"What propaganda.  He killed the leader of the equivalent of the CIA for Iran.


""Responsible for the death of Americans"" = he trained some rebel soldiers in a country WE INVADED AND OCCUPIED.

Do you know how many countries would be ""right"" to assassinate the leader of the CIA by that standard?"
