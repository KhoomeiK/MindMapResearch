curlyhair,fdgzmwv,t1_fdg9hle,1578412151.0,"That first hair wash is amazing! You go! My lumps have stuck around, but I'm used to them now it usually took me a while to 6 months to a year to get feeling back in my scalp, so if yours is numb or feels like it's desensitized, don't panic. You have enough on your plate! Rest and recover. Definitely wash your hands before this, but massaging your incision after will help break down the scar tissue. There is swelling and stuff. Most of my lumps are actually from the skull and closure. One hospital used a fat transfer to close up, another used screws and metal mesh, so that probably varries by surgeon. Give 6-12 months for any side effects you're having. Thing change while the brain heals, so if you notice up and downs in the coming months, treat and manage it, but know that it might not be permanent. Most importantly, give yourself rest! Follow your restrictions, especially about weight lifting and pushing when you go to the bathroom, seriously, use your stool softener religiously. Rest often! If a task can be done while sitting, DO IT. I have a bar stool in the kitchen for when I cook and do the dishes. Take naps. Don't push yourself to early! Take it easy brain tumors warrior!

I had an incredibly tough time accepting the fact that I was never going to be able to keep my previous work standards; that resting was okay. I don't have to push myself past my limits to live up to what I thought was expected of me, and had to learn that it was okay to ask for help. 
My cancer hospital made me see a therapist, and that has helped me a lot. Supportive friends and family help too.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fbwrqai,t3_eeozur,1577157688.0,"Makes me so angry. People used to ask me ""what was wrong with me."" like they were trying to catch me faking the dozen brain surgeries I've had and all my tumors, radiation and chronic illnesses. Such a shame that I was actually kind of happy when one of them left me visably disabled because I don't have to worry about that shit anymore. Now I just have to deal with random people who take the ""what's wrong with you?!"" to a whole other level. Most people just want me to hold their hand and reassure them that they Will NEVER end up like me. Newsflash, you are a jerk. don't ever assume anything about someone, and don't demand random people's medical history. I know far more actually disabled folks who are scared to use disability aids than people who are faking things"
