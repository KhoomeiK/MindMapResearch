MonsterHunterWorld,fffcic8,t3_etbus2,1579880943.0,The game isn’t exactly linear. It’s really dependent on how you like to enjoy your game. Just enjoy! It took me longer to get to the end of the story than my bf but I had more cool stuff than him by the end lol
MonsterHunterWorld,fffcakt,t1_fffbpcr,1579880807.0,"This. When I played, bf and I basically completed every aspect of the base game, then moved on to iceborne. Our friend did not do that, and wanted to get right into iceborne. My man still doesn’t have a temporal mantle."

MonsterHunterWorld,ffapfgy,t1_ffao8b7,1579741398.0,Oh shit.
MonsterHunterWorld,ffansi9,t1_ffaky4x,1579740295.0,I’m at MR 53 and defense is almost 900. But that’s also with 5 defense jewels.
MonsterHunterWorld,ff9yzy6,t1_ff9yxxd,1579724532.0,Oh maybe I should learn to read 😂
MonsterHunterWorld,ff9wul2,t3_esgvi0,1579723244.0,Idk. I have a blast charge blade. It takes longer to build up on resistant monsters. But it still goes off. It’s still an extra 120-300 damage. And my god the satisfaction of it going off during my super mega ultimate elemental destroyer obliterator blast.
MonsterHunterWorld,ff9wj30,t3_esgz0y,1579723048.0,"I honestly can’t give you a “better” build as I am noob and just finished the main quest on PC for iceborne like two days ago.

But! I do love my charge blade. And I can tell you that critical eye is pretty important for it from what I’ve gathered. 

Sorry that probably isn’t very helpful but that’s what I got 😂"

MonsterHunter,ff8aoly,t1_ff7gxzj,1579671092.0,I found coral pukei pukei gross for a lot of reasons. I don’t like to look at him. But he doesn’t make my butthole clench like Ishvalda does.
MonsterHunter,ff8aj1p,t3_es1nff,1579670947.0,"It’s definitely a cosmic horror vibe. He brings on an existential dread.

Also if you pay attention when you knock him down his eyes stay open and I hate that a lot."
MonsterHunterWorld,ff81xym,t3_es5x5b,1579663858.0,It’s really not all ruined. Plenty of people just readjusted key bindings or relearned the new ones.
MonsterHunterWorld,ff80c2h,t3_eryg84,1579662690.0," I hit my circle button a lot when it comes to fast monsters. That spin can often times get you out of the way, and if you’re lucky still achieve a hit. 

If you aren’t feeling sure about whether you can make a safe hit, after you hit triangle once, you can hit triangle and circle at the same time for a shield bash. It does damage, and counts as a block if they attack. 

Don’t be afraid to use just the sword part. Sometimes it’s necessary. For fast monsters I’ve found I don’t get to use the big boy weapon until they’re exhausted, downed, or maybe really focused on my palico/another target."

MonsterHunterWorld,ff5akgb,t3_ern3h7,1579585303.0,"I think the game scaled well. And honestly the difficulty ties well with the lore. Fighting monsters you’ve never seen before should give you a disadvantage. It should be harder. I was pleased when the final boss absolutely wiped the floor with me. It took 5 or 6 fights. I need a little push back. 

But I’m also a big dark souls fan so maybe I just enjoy getting obliterated 😂"
MonsterHunterWorld,ff5abtc,t3_ern3jx,1579585073.0,I was just wondering today if this would be possible. Gonna have to try it with the bf! I like to give him the Yeet anyways 😂

Cringetopia,fencvdd,t1_femnc1a,1579281973.0,"Maybe nobody has ever told you you are smart. And that’s why you try to be the smartest person in the room. Sometimes it’s better to not try to be the smartest person in the room. It can make you look very dumb. 

Also recognizing it as mental illness doesn’t shift the blame onto anyone else. It simply explains behavior. I’m tired of people saying “mental health is an excuse” when it’s the literal, physiological cause of a problem. 

“I have a cold.” “Oh you’re just making excuses cause you’re coughing.” Sounds dumb doesn’t it? 

There are literal brain scans proving how the human brain functions differently with mental illness. There are studies about how the reward part of our brains is starting to work less and less, so we need more and more. (It’s currently a hot topic in the gaming industry with games with loot crates)."
