IncelsWithoutHate,ff6rapr,t1_ff6on5f,1579633237.0,"Correct. That YouTube dude had a gf and he's had more after that bad experience and Currently has one more now! Yet he is still bad looking. So thanks for reinforcing my argument that you don't have to be average or above to find someone that wants you.
My life is shitty? Both of our lives are shitty.

Anyway, as I was saying, your first time should be with a person who wants you. And you know this otherwise you'd just pay off an escort but you don't, like many of the people here who don't do it for the same reason. You smash a girl that destroys your self esteem on a daily basis because she doesn't give a crap about you, and you will regret having your first time with a looney."
IncelsWithoutHate,ff6pqa1,t1_ff62p0r,1579632305.0,"I don't know honestly. I have days where I feel pretty good about myself but other times I feel horribly. So i guess I am average at least. I have a big forehead and a bit wide intercular distance if that makes sense. I honestly just think I look like some sort of low life because of my face and my messed up hair, and my anxiety doesn't help much bc I'm always uncomfortable and quiet. I don't dress dirty, but it might just be my face. I don't know. I wish I knew. Could probably even show a picture"
IncelsWithoutHate,ff6nnfx,t1_ff6jlyh,1579631056.0,"Reported because you got butthurt.

""It means he is not a bad looking dude"" , hmm? Do you recall that guy who went viral on YouTube after that ""being ugly: my experience"" video? he lost his virginity with a girl that treated him like absolute trash and just used him for sex several years before.  He was still ugly. It's just some girls just wanna f*k. And you consider that guy lucky which pretty much says it all why you're so unlucky. You're THAT desesperate."
IncelsWithoutHate,ff61alu,t1_ff5dja0,1579616579.0,Nope. No addictions. I work so barely no time for porn either. But yeah I have anxiety so if that makes me a mentalcell. It doesn't change the fact people look at me that way thought.
IncelsWithoutHate,ff614sj,t1_ff4s5b9,1579616457.0,"6ft. So technically not too tall but where I'm from I'm taller than most people. Regardless, I hate that I get looked upon this way."

Nobody's fault you'd lose your Virginity to a fkn tree if it talked to you first."
IncelsWithoutHate,fexsqxu,t3_eqq43d,1579435555.0,Things like that only happen to people who are powerful enough to make the world a better place.
IncelsWithoutHate,feu80j6,t3_eqg5q4,1579384021.0,Don't ask that here. Plenty of other places for people who are actually into stuff like that. But from I know if done right it might.

IncelsWithoutHate,fekm0cy,t1_feklh8f,1579202839.0,And you're an incel who can't even speak to a woman. You think that only your problems matter and that being cheated on is no big deal so the men who faced such are just whining?

Anxiety,feeottn,t1_feeb11w,1579038102.0,"I hope it does.. but I don't know anymore. No one would want a guy like this. At 24 I Just had so many bad experiences with ppl and several opportunities missed to be happy. And haven't had a real friend in almost a decade.  I pretty much gave up with outside and just stayed at my room during most of that time.. Now I work too but not much changed. I feel like one person could change my whole life and I can't even manage that lol. There is not one single person in my life that knows me for me. Not even my family.

Thank you btw. Feels good to know someone is rooting for me."

IncelsWithoutHate,fe4dfe4,t1_fe3jhlh,1578858082.0,So let's keep them here putting other people down for no reason whatsoever.
IncelsWithoutHate,fdyjmv3,t1_fdyhdep,1578780521.0,Maybe you're right. But I still think some people here should get the ban hammer. Some are just here exactly to put other people down
pics,fdybwtw,t1_fdxr5zm,1578778117.0,"Thats because society is forced to not care about men and their feelings. Men are disposible, and women are fragile creatures. That's what the agenda is. Funny how people still have an issue opening their eyes."
IncelsWithoutHate,fdyakqo,t3_en8a69,1578777724.0,"Just people projecting issues. It's so overused and it's even thrown at people who have alot of potential.

It's exactly why this sub is toxic and you should leave it."
IncelsWithoutHate,fdo2zbm,t1_fddfg5n,1578597944.0,"12 downvotes for the most normal question ever. People do just enjoy feeling like trash and refuse help. Maybe we should change this subreddit to ""ventingIncels"" because that's all we do here."

IncelsWithoutHate,fddfg5n,t3_eknjxk,1578309868.0,"Not trying to cope. But maybe you mentioned you had no hobbies or something, and didn't mention a girlfriend. So she asked it that way."
IncelsWithoutHate,fdaatgx,t1_fda74ls,1578243839.0,"Such as it is blind of you to assume society isn't messed up. I don't blame them for thinking they have no chance when the negative people out there are the ones making themselves loud and clear as they put THESE people down as if they were subhuman. And they do it proudly. So how are you make them get up, accept who they are, be confident and focus on their own careers that things will happen naturally? It's not easy when you have nobody to help you out of the hole, even if it's a friend."
IncelsWithoutHate,fda4hvi,t1_fd0f7ib,1578241535.0,You grow when you get into relationships. So it might be exactly what these people need regardless if they put so much value in it or not.
IncelsWithoutHate,fda3htq,t1_fd9qg92,1578241234.0,"Disagree. Women there don't want average guys. They want good looking guys that are highly above them. That pay for dates, cooks, works in well paid jobs, listens and puts them above his friends. Also don't want to listen to their problems. Basically want these guys to treat them like queens and maybe they'll reward with sex. Literally, only thing I see them offering is sex after posting a list of demandings.
They literally tell eachother to dump any guy that treats them less than that. No such thing as mutual love.

Worse people here? Want an average girl or above."
IncelsWithoutHate,fda21qj,t3_ekcynp,1578240780.0,"LOOOOOL that fkg sub. Been following it for months.

Don't take offense from the women there. You're dealing with 40 year olds trying to prove to eachother that they still have value and can still find an husband (slave, actually). No such thing as love."
